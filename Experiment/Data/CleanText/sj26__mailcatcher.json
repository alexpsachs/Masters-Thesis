    "sj26": "Hey Michael,\nThat's just what I was planning! I've cherry-picked your changes a little to keep the bundle config out of the gem.\nThanks!\n. That's cool, I had meant to pop one in -- have done so now. Thanks!\n. Thanks for your interest!\nIt sounds like whatever you're using to send mail is doing some funky things with the protocol. You should only be sending a single \"MAIL\" command which includes the from address, then you can send as many \"RCPT TO\" commands as you like to add multiple unique senders. MailCatcher should handle that fine. Maybe check out the SMTP RFC for details.\n. Glad you've found a solution.\nI don't want to build a workaround into MailCatcher for broken clients, perhaps you can patch SwiftMailer? In the meantime you know how to get it working. :-)\n. @pjb3 you can certainly send multiple MAIL commands, but it should reset the state of the SMTP exchange. The SwiftMailer client was sending multiple MAIL commands for a single message.\nYour issue is slightly different\u2014you should indeed be able to send multiple messages sequentially over the same connection. MailCatcher is set up to do so, the problem is in eventmachine. A repeat MAIL command should reset the state instead of the current error-out behaviour. They haven't fixed it in master either. Send a pull request! Should be simple to slice the state array and send a receive_reset, which should have the same semantic value.\n. Ah, it looks like daemonizing is a bit broken on Windows under Ruby 1.8.7.\nPlease run mailcatcher --foreground for now until I can release a workaround. :-)\n. @kimptoc, yeah looks like 1.8.7 has slightly different precedence rules and had a problem with the windows fix.\nI've tested on all the rubies I have now and it seems fine. 0.4.2! -.-\n. Thanks for the pull request but these things have already been resolved on master and in the latest MailCatcher gem. Please grab the latest gem or pull master on your git repo if you're still encountering issues on your end. Let me know if there are still problems!\n. Merged in 55790a91a41eb3db316217717364def1dc56bf05, thanks!\n. Could you please confirm this? It works fine for me in Chrome 12.0.742.112.\n. What about adding an accurate last-modified? This was always my intention.\nOn 11/06/2011, at 4:18 AM, pnc wrote:\n\nAdd HTML5 shim script so the app renders in IE8.\nSet an expires header for non-Websocket requests. This prevents IE8 from only loading the message JSON the first time the page loads and getting a 304 Not Modified thereafter.\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/sj26/mailcatcher/pull/10\n. Closing due to inactivity. Will integrate new HTML5 shim at some point.\n. Okay, I've merged in something similar which also copes with (improbably) blank sender and recipient fields also. Thanks!\n\nAlso added guard gems in Gemfile and modified Guardfile to use compass instead of sass so stylesheets are regenerated properly. Apologies, the public development process was a bit crufty. :-/\n. Hmm? Where does it asplode? I don't directly require growl anywhere... if it asplodes for you it's a guard bug, or you need to bundle!\n. I was just about to suggest --help. :-)\n. Can you run the second command in Terminal? Do you have growlnotify installed? (It's normally inside the Growl installation DMG, just not installed by default.)\nYou shouldn't need to explicitly turn on Growl. If you are on OS X and have growlnotify installed, MailCatcher will detect it. The switch is there mainly as a guide and gives instructions on how to get it working.\n. Awesome! MailCatcher primarily deals with SMTP, so we're not listing the \"To\" field, but rather the recipients which includes CC and BCC addresses. Perhaps the message view should actually display the \"To\" and \"Cc\" fields? You won't be able to display BCC because these aren't listed in the message itself and will only be present as recipients on the SMTP side of things. Or maybe you can extrapolate who's BCC'd by doing a set exclusion?\n. Closing this; To/Cc/Bcc is actually irrelevant, recipients (\"To\" in the web interface) is a list of all recipients targeted via SMTP.\n. It lists all recipients that the application is sending to via SMTP. Keep in mind the SMTP server doesn't know the difference\u2014they are all just recipients. Perhaps I should rename the \"To\" field to \"Recipients\" and add a note or something.\nYour application or the library you're using to send SMTP messages should be turning your \"To\", \"Cc\" and \"Bcc\" fields into a list of recipients that are all addressed via SMTP.\ntl;dr: yes.\n. As above, cc and bcc fields are displayed when you view an email. This is already implemented.\n. BCC addresses should never appear in an email's message source, they are Blind Carbon Copy addresses so you don't want to reveal them in the message.\nTo, CC, and BCC addresses do currently appear in the \"To\" recipients list in the MailCatcher interface. Although MailCatcher doesn't look in your message to find these, this is the list of addresses that your SMTP client has asked the message be delivered to. The \"To\" list is exactly the email addresses that your message will be delivered to.. Nice, thanks!\n. Yeah, I usually take those as read but should probably indeed be listed as gem deps. Thanks!\n. Nice one, cheers!\n. MailCatcher is not designed to be used inside rails but rather alongside. Use gem install mailcatcher and run with mailcatcher, do not include mailcatcher in your rails project's Gemfile.\n. Thanks Gregor, missed that one. I've been living in 1.9 land recently. :-)\n. Doable! Patches are very welcome. Otherwise I'll take a look when I get the chance.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks! This is exactly what I was after. Fiddled with it a bit, will be in 0.5.5.\n. Thanks to #26 we can now display the fractal analysis in pretty HTML, so no need to pretty-print machine formats.\n. Great idea, I'll do so when I can. Pull requests are also welcome!\n. Offset change merged, made sure only valid dates are adjusted.\nThanks!\n. Perhaps the delivery methods are being stubbed out or you are using some test helpers preventing actual delivery of mail? Keep in mind that MailCatcher is just an SMTP server so as long as mail delivery is configured properly in your application it should work.\nWe use mailcatcher from rspec tests all the time and it works great. :-)\n. Thanks!\n. I'm not bumping the dependency until 1.0 is released, but I'll leave this issue open until this happens.\nFeel free to grab the source, test and post resutls! I don't use Windows.\n. No worries. :-)\n. Unfortunate that EventMachine hasn't released a stable release since 2009. :-(\nMaybe I should just bump the requirement...\n. Can you please check you're running the very latest versions of mail catcher and eventmachine? This shoul have been fixed by a couple of patches and their reaching 1.0.\n. I'm using box-sizing to size the iframe because traditional methods are not fun. Doesn't look like compass thinks opera supports this, I'll have a play when I get a chance to see if it does these days.\nI'm also happy to accept cross-browser patches.\n. Hi there!\nApart from the websocket hole, I'm not keen on adding authentication support explicitly to the project. I'd like to keep the application itself simple, and it's intended to be run by a developer on a single machine.\nI'd suggest firewalling and proxying the application (with something websocket enabled like Pound) if you have such a requirement.\nAn alternative would be to customise the MailCatcher startup script a little and insert your own authentication middleware into the stack, pretty sure Rack provides some standard some-such which should work.\n. Yeah, Debian's ruby scene is pretty broken. Check out http://ryanbigg.com/2010/12/ubuntu-ruby-rvm-rails-and-you/.\n. Ruby is an interesting thing on Ubuntu/Debian. You're probably better off installing some sort of ruby from scratch instead of using the apt versions. gem install mailcatcher should have covered everything.\n. Good catch! Will roll this into the next update.\nThat link's not working any more, but I found the which_s function which seems to be what you describe.\n. I like this idea!\n. Sorry yes, closed.\n. This sounds like a great addition! I'll take a look tonight.\n. Sorry I didn't get around to this yet. I think it underlies some things I wanted to investigate for notifications in general. Mountain Lion's UserNotificationCenter should be supported, and Growl support should be more comprehensive with clickbacks. Doing something on Windows would be cool, also. This is getting high on my TODO list, will keep you posted.\n. Possible that Firefox's websockets have become incompatible, I'll look into it.\n. Sorry this took a while, finally got a chance to check it out. Fixed in 0.5.7.2.\n. Hmm, I disagree about the difficulty of opening the URL\u2014especially with iTerm (try a command+click)\u2014but I like the idea in general. I don't like the inclusion of launchy, that has become very unwieldy where a simple open/start /b works fine. Let me see what I can do.\n. This looks awesome!\n. Sorry, this one slipped my mind! Will merge.\n. Please don't include mailcatcher in your Gemfile, it is a standalone application with it's own dependency set.\nThese changes would break forwards compatibility.\nMailcatcher should be installed as a separate gem (gem install mailcatcher) which is simply run as mailcatcher.\nGlad you're enjoying it, though! :-)\n. I don't understand why you'd use MailCatcher for automated testing? ActionMailer will store your deliveries locally in testing anyway in a way that makes it easy to run assertions.\nCheck the rails guide: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html#mailer-testing\nIf you have a more complex scenario I'd love to know how and why you're using MailCatcher, maybe we can make it easier!\n. You can assert the correctness of css selectors the same as you would asset the html structure and applied css of your normal page views, if that's what you actually want to test. Take a look at email_spec for instance which adds some more comprehensive introspection abilities for email bodies.\nIf you want to test the look and feel of your application I suspect you're trying to QA and you might like to consider something like mail_view which lets you render each email without having to trigger it's generation and sending. You still need someone looking at the rendered emails and checking off a list.\n. If you want to use MailCatcher as the tool to enable this workflow please feel free, but in the same way you wouldn't put apache, nginx, passenger, pow, mysql, postgresql, etc in your Gemfile, you shouldn't put mailcatcher in there either.\n. Haha, yeah I'd rock that Gemfile hard.\nmail_view is probably better for a devsignment workflow.\n. Please don't include mailcatcher in your Gemfile, it is a standalone application with it's own dependency set.\nMailcatcher should be installed as a separate gem (gem install mailcatcher) which is simply run as mailcatcher.\n. I don't really want to tie into Rails at all, there are projects like mail_view for that... but I will definitely add something to the README. Thanks!\n. I don't think this is the responsibility of a process. Your process management tools should be able to monitor a started process' ID. I run mailcatcher using launchd on Mac OS X and using upstart on Ubuntu, both of which are capable of tracking (and maintaining, and stopping) a process in this manner.\nIf you don't want mailcatcher to go into the background use --foreground.\nIf you absolutely want to background the process and keep the pid, consider using something like start-stop-daemon to write out a pid file.\n. @pylebecq the initial line you posted should be sufficient, as long as your ruby environment is set up correctly. I suspect it will be an issue with how your ruby is installed and where you mailcatcher gem is installed. Could you open a new issue with full information with your ruby setup, where the gem is installed, and your full upstart config?\n. Quite right, I always forget how nerfed popen and friends were on 1.8.7. I'll update it to use open3 instead and re-release.\n. Fixed in v0.5.7.1.\n. I'm having trouble replicating this issue. This is working fine on my machine:\nsh\n$ irb -r mail_catcher\nirb> MailCatcher::Mail.add_message <your gisted message hash>\n=> nil\nirb> MailCatcher::Mail.messages\n=> [{\"id\"=>1, \"sender\"=>\"...\", \"recipients\"=>[\"...\"], \"subject\"=>\"...\", \"size\"=>\"...\", \"created_at\"=>...}]\nWhat version of ruby and sqlite3 are you using? Perhaps it's something in there. The exception is unforunately not very descriptive, and googling reveals it's fairly generic, but usually it means the database is missing. Considering this is an in-memory database it should never be missing. :-/\nOn my machine:\nsh\n$ ruby -v\nruby 1.9.3p194 (2012-04-20 revision 35410) [x86_64-darwin11.3.0]\nsh\n$ sqlite3 --version\n3.7.10 2012-01-16 13:28:40 ebd01a8deffb5024a5d7494eef800d2366d97204\n. Mailcatcher is not multithreaded, there is a single reactor thread in EventMachine (afaict).\nIf you can provide a script replicating the issue I'll happily reopen and investigate.\n. Hi! Could you please confirm the version of mailcatcher you're running? The latest version is 0.5.7.2:\nconsole\n$ mailcatcher --version\nmailcatcher 0.5.7.2\n. Ugh, again? I'll take a look. :-(\n. Looks like WebKit got stricter about websocket client protocols. Fixed in 0.5.8.\n. This is the sort of thing I expect EventMachine::Protocols::SmtpServer to take care of, but apparently it doesn't. Fixed in 20cf6e98f1362be06db9b3d83e758ca3af5df8a2, but I'm going to sit on the next version for a little while, but will be fixed for 0.5.9.\n. Mailcatcher binds to the local interface because the default use case is a developer running it on their local machine to test against and they only need local access. Binding to all interfaces could be a security issue for the default use case. Anybody with HTTP access to mailcatcher can clear all mail or quit. Mailcatcher also isn't hardened so running a public service by default could also expose potential attack vectors.\nThere is, however, an option to change the bind IP for just such cases as running a staging box:\nmailcatcher --http-ip=0.0.0.0\nThanks. :-)\n. Ah, that's weird. Looks like I accidentally removed it from the gem's manifest. Fixed in 5f05ea0d5d813e25c04f42f57e19e581dbb81df6.\n. Great idea, not sure how comfortable I am with the gmail integration. I'd be more inclined to just act like a first-class SMTP server, however that raises problems via ISPs. Also want the deliveree's address to be changeable in the web interface.\n. They finally released 1.0! Awesome, I've bumped requirements in skinny v0.2.2 and mailcatcher v0.5.9.\n. Ah, yes... more complex resolution would realise that skinny 0.2.2 is available and sates eventmachine ~> 1.0.0, but perhaps I'm assuming rubygems is smarter than it really is. Bundler certainly had no trouble, but it tends to be more considerate.\nI'll add a proper spermy requirement.\n. These dependencies have been tightened in 0.5.10 and shouldn't be a problem. Thanks, and let me know how you go!\n. This should be fixed by the referenced commit. Let me know if it's still breaking!\n. Hey guys, sorry about this, I haven't had a chance to look at it and have been super busy, but I'll take a look tonight. Looks like something subtle inside EventMachine has changed and broken the WebSocket support.\n. Okay, so I finally got to look at this. It's introduced by this commit in eventmachine. I've added a workaround in skinny and the new versions should be out now. gem install mailcatcher -v 0.5.10\n. Hi! Looks like you've found something kinda gnarly. Can you attach the actual message? Or email it to me if it's sensitive. I need the full message with all parts including headers. <3\n. Without the message I can't investigate this issue, closing.\n. I'd like some specs as well, but given some major changes in the wings there doesn't seem to be much point specing at this point.\nWould merge with some acceptance specs for now, they should remain roughly the same.\n. I've taken some tentative steps toward including specs. There are a couple of minispec scenarios which do basic acceptance testing, I'll add more and get it running on Travis soon.\n. The dependencies have been tightened in 0.5.10, please try that. gem install mailcatcher -v 0.5.10\n. Could you elaborate on the problems you've been having?\n. Awesome!\n. I kinda have a rewrite in the wings that I was planning to implement this with... I do like the approach but stay tuned.\n. This is a bug introduced by the latest version of eventmachine, and was fixed in the latest version of mailcatcher. :-)\n. Thanks!\n. This is what catchmail is for.\nTry bundle exec bin/catchmail examples/multipartmail\nOr, for multiple messages try a shell loop. :-)\n. Nice!\n. Slid by me, but will merge now.\n. Would you be able to provide updated instructions? I no longer use rvm.\n. I've updated the guidelines in 327cd355 after installing RVM on a VM and playing a bit.\n. You don't need to run it with bundler. You've also installed it into an RVM gemset, so you must run it inside that gemset.\nTry using rvm-exec:\nsh\n/var/lib/jenkins/.rvm/bin/rvm-exec @mailcatcher mailcatcher\nOr you could create a wrapper per the README instructions:\nconsole\n$ rvm default@mailcatcher --create gem install mailcatcher\n$ rvm wrapper default@mailcatcher --no-prefix mailcatcher catchmail\nand use:\nsh\n/var/lib/jenkins/.rvm/bin/mailcatcher\nIf you're running with process management (i.e. supervisord) you'll either have to make sure it follows the daemonization, or pass --foreground to mailcatcher.\n. It sounds like an ill-formed message, could you please attach the full source of the message? Feel free to anonymise it a bit if you like, or email it to me directly (as an attachment): sj26@sj26.com\nSounds like you might've found a bug in the mail gem. ;-)\n. Hey guys, sorry I've been a bit flat out, I'll take a look tonight and get back to you, but yeah it looks to me like an upstream problem, probably in the mail gem's parsing code.\n. I actually can't replicate this with the example email you supplied.\nWhat version of the mail gem are you both using when able to replicate the issue? That might be a clue.\n. Keep in mind mailcatcher runs as a ruby gem, outside of bundler, so it'll use whatever the latest compatible version of the mail gem you have installed is. Perhaps your devs have differing versions of mail? Try updating mail and see what happens.\n. OH okay. Your email doesn't have a Message-ID or part Content-IDs which are required in RFC 2822. Normally the mail gem just generates one for any parts without one, but for some reason it seems to be skipping in your case. How are you constructing this email? Whatever is generating it should be providing a content id.\nI think this breaks because mailcatcher use content ids (or CIDs) to load the different parts inside a multipart html and text email. I still can't replicate the failure on my machine. I initially had trouble replicating this because I used the mailcatcher's catchmail script which wraps the outgoing email in the mail gem before sending it off which adds content-ids and such required things before it hits mailcatcher:\n``` email\nDate: Mon, 07 Jan 2013 21:45:08 -0500\nFrom: General Assembly course-from@example.com\nTo: auz1@example.com\nMessage-ID: 50ebb207e14b6_453b3fe1c045c66c366e9@Bumblebee.local.mail\nSubject: Confirmation for Front End Web Development\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: multipart/alternative;\n boundary=\"--==_mimepart_50eb88343c171_57413ffbe1c35ad890373\";\n charset=UTF-8\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\n----==_mimepart_50eb88343c171_57413ffbe1c35ad890373\nDate: Mon, 07 Jan 2013 21:45:08 -0500\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain;\n charset=UTF-8\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nContent-ID: 50ebb207e050e_453b3fe1c045c66c36475@Bumblebee.local.mail\nDear Auz Foo,\n...\n```\n(see Content-ID: <50ebb207e050e_453b3fe1c045c66c36475@Bumblebee.local.mail>)\nI've been explicitly writing out an SMTP session with the literal email you've posted, but still no failure.\nTry adding Content-ID to your source email and see if that fixes the error on your end. If it does, try to track down inside the mail gem why it's not populating content_id on the Part, which part it actually is in the message, etc. Even better, make a failing test case against the mail gem!\n. @thicksoup that's a different issue which I've never seen before. Could you please send me the MailCatcher log output and the full message source you are trying to send?\n. @thicksoup be careful, too, because \"Cannot receive from specified address <...>: Unauthenticated senders not allowed\" is not a message that I can see anywhere in eventmachine's SMTP handling, so you may not even be sending through mailcatcher.\n. @mmrobins without a repeatable trigger we can't really diagnose this. If you come up with a way to repeatedly trigger the error please let me know, but for now I'll close the issue.\n. @amree can you post an example which triggers the error please? Preferably the full source of an email body sent to mailcatcher, and any logs you get from mailcatcher in response.\n. @amree your config/environments/development.rb does not appear to have the mail catcher config as you describe. If you added it then tried sending mail then you may have forgotten to restart rails. That you are seeing the message text in the rails logs means something in your application is misconfigured.\n. @ekurennyy check the various logs involved\u2014both client and server side.\n. @dounan that sounds like a mail gem bug! It should be aware of the content encoding of the message and use compatible content-id. Maybe you could add an issue?. This is a rails configuration issues really, not a mailcatcher issue, but I'll try to help!\nMake sure you've got all of these in config/environments/test.rb:\nruby\nconfig.action_mailer.perform_delivery = true\nconfig.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp\nconfig.action_mailer.smtp_settings = { :address => \"localhost\", :port => 1025 }\nAdditionally, check inside your scenarios that mail is actually being sent. If it's not going to mailcatcher it should be going somewhere else, or being logged, or throwing an exception, etc.\n. Then something in your cucumber environment is overriding your mail settings.\nIs your cucumber definitely setup to use the \"test\" environment, or is it using the \"cucumber\" environment?\n. No, that's the port capybara uses to serve your web application to the browser.\nHonestly it's an environment issue which I can't debug for you without access to your codebase, and is not due to mailcatcher. If you'd like to contact me to have a look at your codebase I'd be happy to, but I'll close this issue.\n. That will not work\u2014websockets will break.\n. You can now proxy websockets with nginx. Here's a complete example configuration file:\nhttps://gist.github.com/sj26/9885403\n. This was fixed in an updated version of mailcatcher. Update and you should be fine.\n. @stefanahman that's a very old version of mailcatcher, please upgrade\n. Just run on different ports and you should be safe.\nOn 16/01/2013, at 7:01 PM, attiks notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI had a quick look at the code, but I'm not really a Ruby man so I might be wrong, but it looks like it isn't possible to run multiple instances (unless I duplicate the directory).

Great point.\n. I'm unable to replicate this on ruby 1.9.3-p374 with foreman 0.61.0 and mailcatcher 0.5.10.\n\nWhat versions of ruby, foreman and mailcatcher are you using? Have you tried editing the mailcatcher gem to add $stdout.sync = $stderr.sync = true to confirm this is a solution to your problem?\n. Closed by #121.\n. I have no idea whether haml 12 will be supported, or activesupport 5, or mail 7.\nWere I to update mailcatcher to support the newer gems you'd like here, backwards compatibility might be broken, and we'd get issues from others in the same vein complaining that it was working fine with their versions of haml, activesupport, etc. but now they can't get newer versions.\nAs always, mailcatcher is an independent gem with its own requirements and you should be doing gem install mailcatcher and mailcatcher on the command line, or using tools like brew-gem. If you're using it in a project with a team, great, but I'd recommend putting it in the README, not the Gemfile.\n. Sorry, would you mind clarifying this issue?\n. I'm sorry but that's far outside the scope of mailcatcher.\n. Please don't include mailcatcher in your Gemfile, it is a standalone application with it's own dependency set. Mailcatcher should be installed as a separate gem (gem install mailcatcher) which is simply run as mailcatcher.\nTo document a dependency I suggest adding it to your README. :-)\n. I've relaxed the HAML requirement in 6605fc26. The put-it-in-the-Gemfile approach is widespread, so I'll adapt things as requested. Sorry for the trouble.\n. You shouldn't be loading mailcatcher with rails. Please don't put it in your Gemfile.\nI probably will upgrade the dependencies at some point when activesupport 4 is released with rails, though not to a prerelease.\n. I've isolated the dependency update in 6605fc26.\n. Nice catch, sorry it took a while for me to notice.\n. Well it needs to run inside EventMachine, and it needs websocket support. What in thin stops it running under jruby?\n. Closing this. We probably won't support jruby explicitly if thin doesn't work. The magic of mailcatcher is that it's a single process doing everything which requires eventmachine, and the easiest way to do web in eventmachine is thin.\n. http://mailcatcher.me/#bundler\n. Foreman is another utility that doesn't really belong in your Gemfile, or at least shouldn't be launched with a bundler binstub. Any ruby subprocess is susceptible to this problem, including things like hub and gh. Vagrant have had such issues with this that they no longer distribute as a rubygem but as a system installable package.\nYou have two options:\n1. Ask bundler to clean the environment before running mailcatcher:\nweb: thin ...  \n   mailcatcher: ruby -rbundler/setup -e \"Bundler.clean_exec('mailcatcher', '--foreground')\"\n(Example in gist: https://gist.github.com/sj26/8f638252ab64b1d0ecbb)\n2. gem install foreman and just foreman instead of bundle exec foreman and bundle exec ... or use bundle binstubs (bin/...) in your Procfile entries.\n. The point is: MailCatcher is a separate application or system utility, like Postgres or MySQL, not a library like haml or rails.\n. Thanks @rocknruby, I've corrected the typo of Bundler. I think the argument was being missed because I had wrapped them in an array, clean_exec seems to function like Kernel#spawn and wants a splat of args instead, also corrected.\nPassing arguments as an list is usually safer and cuts out parsing and subshells. ;-)\n. Do you get HTML when you curl http://localhost:1080\u00a0on the vagrant vm?\nIf it's a port forwarding issue I have no idea, sorry\u2014I don't use vagrant. Are you absolutely sure your port forwarding is correct, and in the correct direction?\nOn Wed, May 1, 2013 at 9:09 AM, Amin Meyghani notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nI have installed the Mailcatcher gem (http://mailcatcher.me/) on my VM managed by Vagrant. And in the Vagrantfile I have set up the forwarding port:\n    config.vm.forward_port 1080, 1080\nI ssh to the guest, run the Mailcatcher on the guest, but when I go to: 127.0.0.1:1080 on my host, I don't see the Mailcather interface. All I get is:\n    No data received.Unable to load the webpage because the server sent no data ...\nAny ideas?\nThanks in advance!\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/sj26/mailcatcher/issues/89\n. You could try running mailcatcher using:\n\nsh\n$ mailcatcher --ip=0.0.0.0\nThis means you can access mailcatcher on your VM host using your VM's ip and port 1080, no vagrant forwarding required.\n. @joeyfrich there is definitely an ip option so you may be using an old version. Try gem install mailcatcher to upgrade.\n. Thanks for the very thorough issue report! I have added a patch to remove mailcatcher's sensitivity to leading periods. I'd swear that EventMachine didn't do this for us at some point, but I couldn't be bothered tracing back into their subversion history.\nThanks again, this will be in the next release.\n. Mailcatcher runs on localhost by default. Try using mailcatcher --ip=0.0.0.0\n. Looks great, thanks!\n. mailcacther will log, so if you want to watch it run with --foreground.\ncatchmail is actually what is generating your error, much like sendmail or your LTA would do when running PHP on the server. RFC 2822 section 3.6.2 requires a From header.\n. Note that the PHP documentation also says:\n\nNote:\nWhen sending mail, the mail must contain a From header. This can be set with the additional_headers parameter, or a default can be set in php.ini.\nFailing to do this will result in an error message similar to Warning: mail(): \"sendmail_from\" not set in php.ini or custom \"From:\" header missing. The From header sets also Return-Path under Windows.\n. Yeah, sendmail on *nix will use the current user and host to generate a From for you, although this is far from correct.\n\nActually, more correct would be adding the -f option to catchmail. I've updated the documentation in that direction.\n. Are you including it in your Gemfile? You shouldn't be.\n. Great idea!\nI think it might be better to simply decorate the plain text view with links, perhaps in javascript land. There's no real detriment. If people want a plaintext copy they can just \"Paste as Plaintext\" or whatever.\n. Great, thanks!\n. No worries, thanks. :smile:\n. Please edit the coffeescript source, not the raw javascript.\n. Sorry, but I don't see any difference in iPad functionality with these changes. Existing MailCatcher seems to work fine.\n. This should have been fixed by 44262f9.\n. I can't replicate this\u2014if you're still having this issue please re-open the issue with some example emails causing the problem.\n. I can't replicate this, the API seems to function as expected for me:\nsh\n$ bundle exec mailcatcher\n$ curl http://localhost:1080/messages\n[]\n$ bundle exec catchmail examples/multipartmail\n$ curl http://localhost:1080/messages\n[{\"id\":1,\"sender\":\"<me@sj26.com>\",\"recipients\":[\"<blah@blah.com>\"],\"subject\":\"Test Multipart Mail\",\"size\":\"631\",\"created_at\":\"2014-03-31T04:44:07+00:00\"}]\n$ bundle exec catchmail examples/multipartmail\n$ curl http://localhost:1080/messages\n[{\"id\":1,\"sender\":\"<me@sj26.com>\",\"recipients\":[\"<blah@blah.com>\"],\"subject\":\"Test Multipart Mail\",\"size\":\"631\",\"created_at\":\"2014-03-31T04:44:07+00:00\"},{\"id\":2,\"sender\":\"<me@sj26.com>\",\"recipients\":[\"<blah@blah.com>\"],\"subject\":\"Test Multipart Mail\",\"size\":\"631\",\"created_at\":\"2014-03-31T04:44:10+00:00\"}]\n$ curl -XDELETE http://localhost:1080/messages/1\n$ curl http://localhost:1080/messages\n[{\"id\":2,\"sender\":\"<me@sj26.com>\",\"recipients\":[\"<blah@blah.com>\"],\"subject\":\"Test Multipart Mail\",\"size\":\"631\",\"created_at\":\"2014-03-31T04:44:10+00:00\"}]\n$ curl -XDELETE http://localhost:1080/messages/2\n$ curl http://localhost:1080/messages\n[]\n$ curl -XDELETE http://localhost:1080/messages/1\n<html>\n  <body>\n    <h1>No Dice</h1>\n    <p>The message you were looking for does not exist, or doesn't have content of this type.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\nLet me know if you're still having this issue and, if so, see if you can provide a breaking example.\n. Closing; fixed by #110.\n. This breaks the failure scenario.\n. Disagree\u2014I want to be able to exactly replicate a problem with exactly the same gems as another developer, or be able to ask people to install from git to exactly replicate potential issues.\n. They're not going to be up to date now either, I'll do a recompile in a sec.\n. Nice addition.\n. The idea was to make it transparent, so no options should be involved really. My delay on this feature was just researching a nice way to find a platform-dependent location for the database.\n. I would prefer a --database=URL argument, using something like sequel, falling back to ENV.fetch(\"DATABASE_URL\", \"sqlite://:memory:\"), and with graceful migrations. This would work but would create a new migration path for which I'm not keen.\n. @fdrouet you can already run multiple instances of mailcatcher using different ports, the content just won't survive restarts. :-)\n. @fdrouet you might like to try https://github.com/mailhog/mailhog. It's written in go, has less dependencies and much less memory usage.\n. Thanks!\n. On ubuntu you will need to sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev first.\n. Have you checked that websockets still work, and that Thin boots correctly within the EventMachine loop? MailCatcher has a tight dependency on Skinny which heavily integrates with Thin.\nAlso, http://mailcatcher.me/#bundler\n. No, and I don't really think it should, although I'd like to know your use case.\n. Ah, that sounds like a simple purpose-built SMTP server might serve you better.\n. Haven't heard from you for a while, going to close this one for now.\n. Thanks!\n. Sorry, I can't replicate this. Could you perhaps attach a test email causing the problem?\n. @sancromeu nice investigation, albeit with frustrating results.\nThe whole point of prepared statements is to prepare them once then reuse them with varied bound data. This looks like an upstream bug that I can't really address except to remove an optimisation which should work for everybody.\nI'm afraid the resolution here is probably to fix the upstream sqlite package in centos, or recompile it, and these things are outside my control so closing this issue.\n. What browser and version are you using? Is there anything in the debug console?\n. Rubygems takes care of loading a graph of dependencies making sure all versions are compatible. Try running the below:\nsh\n$ ruby -r mail_catcher -e \"p(Gem.loaded_specs)\"\n{\"eventmachine\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff6aa44191c eventmachine-1.0.3>, \"haml\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff6a9c902b8 haml-4.0.5>, \"treetop\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff6aa058170 treetop-1.4.15>, \"mail\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff6aa407370 mail-2.5.4>, \"sqlite3\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff6a9c1629c sqlite3-1.3.8>, \"daemons\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff6aa44ddc0 daemons-1.1.9>, \"thin\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff6aa419778 thin-1.5.1>, \"skinny\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff6a9c1abf8 skinny-0.2.3>, \"mailcatcher\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff6aa035030 mailcatcher-0.5.12>, \"activesupport\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff6aa46865c activesupport-3.2.16>, \"i18n\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff6a9c22e84 i18n-0.6.9>, \"rack\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff6aa449c48 rack-1.5.2>, \"multi_json\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff6a9c37168 multi_json-1.8.4>, \"mime-types\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff6aa019448 mime-types-1.25.1>, \"tilt\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff6a9c3f0c0 tilt-1.4.1>, \"sinatra\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff6aa03088c sinatra-1.4.4>, \"rack-protection\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff6aa421ba8 rack-protection-1.5.2>}\nI have tilt version 2.0.0 installed, yet it has correctly selected 1.4.1.\nIf you find rubygems is not doing the same for you then I suspect you have a broken ruby/rubygems install. Linux distributions sometimes do silly things with gems. If you find a fix please let me know, but for now this is not a bug in mailcatcher.\n. I still can't reproduce this issue exactly, but it can't hurt. Thanks! :-)\n. MailCatcher lists the SMTP receiver and senders in the list, but displays the mail body's \"To\", \"Cc\" and \"From\" headers when actually viewing an individual message. \"Bcc\" headers are stripped by your mail client/library so cannot appear in MailCatcher, but we still list all the people a message is actually being sent to. Do you have any suggested improvements?\n. This requires mixing the smtp and mail concerns and perhaps inferring too much. We cannot be sure that such recipients were indicated in a bcc field. We can assume, but such an assumption may be incorrect.\nI'm inclined to leave it as is, I'm afraid.\n. We should actually just append \"\\r\\n\" to every line as stipulated by the SMTP protocol. I'll take a look.\n. Great! That's why the -f flag is suggested for sendmail/catchmail. ^_^\n. Love the idea, but perhaps favcount might suit better so that even when tabs get tiny the count can still be read? I've merged your change, fixed a few edge cases, and added favcount on master\u2014see what you think.\n. I love it. This has spurred me to actually complete some changes I had pending to the codebase, then I'll add a \"Transcript\" tab.\nAnother thought\u2014what about a failed SMTP session? Should I perhaps be exposing failures as \"messages\"? And what about SMTP sessions which submit multiple messages? Requires further mulling.\n. This is more work than it sounds like, and I'd like to deduplicate the data a little which requires a rethink of the database a little. First, I'd like to update the database itself to use ActiveRecord or something. Will put this on the back burner for now.\n. Thin is locked down because skinny hooks deeply into thin and allowing less strict requirements could have unknown effects.\nThe activesupport requirement is less strict and deeply coupled, and has been tested through the 3 series and into 4.0.\nIf you'd like to take the time to thoroughly test mailcatcher and, more importantly, skinny with later versions of thin I'd love to see the results and consider loosening the requirement.\n. Make sure you're just running mailcatcher and not bundle exec mailcatcher, and that you don't have a bundler binstub.\n. Well somehow ruby is loading bundler before running mailcatcher. It might be because of a stray bin stub or a weird environment variable or something.\nCan you check and post the output (sanitised if you like) of:\n1. which mailcatcher\n2. env\n3. Run it from a different directory, perhaps your home directory\n4. Run it in a different terminal\n. Well (1) is your problem. What's bundled_mailcatcher? Looks like something funky in your terminal setup, I've never seen such a thing. You need to follow that rabbit hole. What's which bundled_mailcatcher give you, etc?\n. Haven't heard for a couple of days, hope you've tracked down your problem, but as this isn't a MailCatcher issue per se I'll close this issue.\n. The readme already contains:\n\nCommand line options to override the default SMTP/HTTP IP and port settings.\n\nWhich should lead someone to run mailcatcher --help which reveals:\nUsage: mailcatcher [options]\n        --ip IP                      Set the ip address of both servers\n        --smtp-ip IP                 Set the ip address of the smtp server\n        --smtp-port PORT             Set the port of the smtp server\n        --http-ip IP                 Set the ip address of the http server\n        --http-port PORT             Set the port address of the http server\n        --no-quit                    Don't allow quitting the process\n        --[no-]growl                 Growl to the local machine when a message arrives\n    -f, --foreground                 Run in the foreground\n    -b, --browse                     Open web browser\n    -v, --verbose                    Be more verbose\n    -h, --help                       Display this help information\nDo you think there should be more?\n. sed -ir \"s@;\\?sendmail_path =.*@sendmail_path = \\\"/usr/bin/env $(which mailcatcher) -f local\\@host\\\"@\" /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini\nshould be\nsed -ir \"s@;\\?sendmail_path =.*@sendmail_path = \\\"/usr/bin/env $(which catchmail) -f local\\@host\\\"@\" /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini\n. No worries, hope it's working for you. :-)\n. The table actually lists the SMTP sender and recipients as per the SMTP exchange, the RFC2822 Return-Path header in the actual email is just a way to tell the SMTP client which SMTP sender to use. You can also use the -f option to sendmail, for example.\nI'm not inclined to change it because the list is meant to reflect exactly where an email claims to come from and where it has been sent in the delivery process. The RFC2822 From, To and Cc headers as they would be displayed in an email client are listed in the message body below the table.\n. Do you have the xcode command line tools installed? Mailcatcher uses a gem which requires a compiler.\n. Please re-open the issue if you're still having issues.\n. Sorry guys, I don't have a windows machine to test this on. If you make any progress it would be great to hear your thoughts. Perhaps eventmachine needs an upgrade?\n. Have you tried this with eventmachine 1.0.4? Anyways, I'm going to close this issue, please reopen it if, with the latest gem versions, you still have the same issue.\n. Have you got any logs from PHP or your web server indicating why it is failing?\n. You'll probably need a wrapper like:\nhttp://mailcatcher.me/#rvm\n. Hi kalmanh,\nThanks for getting involed, but I've left the 1.8-style hashes on purpose\u2014mailcatcher still works on ruby 1.8.7 and I don't think changing hash syntaxes is enough of an incentive to break that compatibility yet.\nThanks though!\n. @der-flo that's not related to this pull request. master mailcatcher now has an asset server for development and precompiles the assets for gem publishing. Put MAILCATCHER_ENV=development in your ENV to hook it up.\n. (There's some major work waiting for me to get around to releasing 0.6.0)\n. Holy shit, hi @dirkkelly.\nThanks.\n. Agreed, this is going on the list.\n. This is not for HTTP, but for SMTP over TLS and STARTTLS, for testing your mail settings and libraries.\nI agree that reverse proxying from nginx is better for HTTPS, and I wouldn't recommend exposing mailcatcher itself outside a development environment without something else acting as a proxy with authentication. :-). There's some severe asset reworking in the latest master which might not work out of the box. You'll need to pull it locally and run rake assets or export MAILCATCHER_ENV=development. There will be a release when I can finish the changes.\n. The latest master has a big rework of the asset infrastructure. If you want the assets in a development checkout you'll need to either set an environment variable MAILCATCHER_ENV=true or run rake assets.\n. Not sure what this is about, but please reopen with issues if you need assistance.\n. You'll need those environment variables set in your PHP process which runs sendmail, or you can edit the catchmail shebang to include a --encoding=utf8.\nPlease reopen the issue if you have further problems.\n. Unfortunately because the versions of ruby vary so greatly in their treatment of encodings and it's rubygems creating the shim, not mailcatcher, there's little we can do from the gem.\n. Actually, I tell a lie. We could set the external encoding inside the script. I'll add a TODO.\n. Do you have any log output? It's probably having trouble locating the proper ruby or gem. Re-open with some output and I'll be happy to help you diagnose.\n. @enrichit if you can post the command you're using and the output you're seeing maybe I can help?\n. Sorry not sure what's going on here. Try upgrading all your gems? SQLite had some strangeness a while back. Please re-open if you're still seeing this issue.\n. Technically, characters outisde the ascii 1-127 range are not permitted unencoded in email messages. This will be causing an error when parsing your message and attempting to send. You will see errors in mail servers if you attempt to send them in the wild. Instead, make sure you're using a mail library which can encode these characters correctly using mime or quoted printable encodings.\n. Closing this, make sure you use rbenv rehash or whatever your environment configuration requires to find new gem binstubs. :-)\n. This is a complicated beast. I agree it would be nice to preview what emails might look like in different clients in mailcatcher, but which client? and how? what about compatibility problems between what mailcatcher thinks a client does and what it actually does?\nThere are many services that will do this for you, like MailChimp's inbox inspector, Campaign Monitor's inbox preview, Fractal, etc.\nIntegration with these services would be nice, but requires a lot of configuration which I'm not sure needs to be in mailcatcher. If you can think of a good way to do this please let me know!\n. SMTP doesn't natively support UTF-8 over the wire. This message, if transmitted raw, doesn't actually conform to the protocol. Some servers support an SMTP UTF-8 extension, but this must be negotiated with EHLO and mailcatcher doesn't support it.\nInstead, your mail client should be encoding your message body with  base64 or similar instead of transferring in straight 8-bit. I suspect the body is actually being munged on read then causing transcoding errors on jsonification. For me, this throws an exception at read time. (Encodings in ruby are awful at the best of times.)\nIf I send your raw email body with catchmail then the mail gem picks up the content and correctly encodes it as base64 and it comes out as expected:\n{\n  \"id\":3,\n  \"sender\":\"\\u003ctesting@localhost.local\\u003e\",\n  \"recipients\":[\"\\u003creceiver@localhost.local\\u003e\"],\n  \"subject\":\"R\u00e4ksm\u00f6rg\u00e5s!\",\n  \"source\":\"Date: Mon, 18 Aug 2014 17:51:26 +0200\\r\\nFrom: Testing \\u003ctesting@localhost.local\\u003e\\r\\nTo: receiver@localhost.local\\r\\nMessage-ID: \\u003c53f220fe58644dfb827100d80a00020f@localhost.local\\u003e\\r\\nSubject: =?UTF-8?Q?R=C3=A4ksm=C3=B6rg=C3=A5s!?=\\r\\nMime-Version: 1.0\\r\\nContent-Type: text/plain;\\r\\n charset=UTF-8\\r\\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: base64\\r\\n\\r\\nSMOkbGzDtiB0w6RzdGluZyByw6Rrc23DtnJnw6VzIQo=\\r\\n\",\n  \"size\":\"368\",\n  \"type\":\"text/plain\",\n  \"created_at\":\"2015-01-17T05:44:07.000+00:00\",\n  \"formats\":[\"source\",\"plain\"],\n  \"attachments\":[]\n}\n. Hey there, I didn't get a notice about this issue which is odd, sorry.\nThis is an odd issue. Looks like rubygems isn't doing its job properly:\nirb(main):002:0> Gem.loaded_specs\n=> {}\nirb(main):003:0> gem \"mailcatcher\"\n=> true\nirb(main):004:0> Gem.loaded_specs\n=> {\"eventmachine\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff8e6fcd464 eventmachine-1.0.3>, \"haml\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff8e6a1d0c8 haml-4.0.5>, \"sqlite3\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff8e6e9d2ec sqlite3-1.3.9>, \"daemons\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff8e6b95914 daemons-1.1.9>, \"thin\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff8e6e7dce4 thin-1.5.1>, \"skinny\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff8e6cccf6c skinny-0.2.3>, \"mailcatcher\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff8e69343f0 mailcatcher-0.5.12>}\n(notice activesupport and i18n are missing.)\nYou could work around by using rvm to install mailcatcher into a dedicated gemset and make the wrapper use that, so any conflicting versions installed by other things don't conflict.\n. @CamJN that won't fix the gem. To have the same effect in development mode, start mailcatcher with bundle exec mailcatcher.\n. Yep. Please remove any prerelease versions of i18n if you encounter this issue.\n. @jondoe1337 that looks like you've got activesurpport 4.2.7.rc1 installed which is causing havoc. Can you try:\ngem uninstall activesupport -v 4.2.7.rc1\n. You can run the git version with MAILCATCHER_ENV=development in your ENV. But I want a better solution to this to be sure.\n. Please use bundle exec rake or bundle exec mailcatcher, you don't need to unshift the library directory.\nActivesupport is another issue, will pull that commit.\n. Neat!\nEXPOSE 25 80 won't work because not being bound as root.\n. Thanks, but I deliberately didn't include sinatra-contrib for various reasons though. This has been fixed with some content_type stanzas.\n. Please remove any prerelease versions of i18n to make this work. Mailcatcher works with the released version of i18n 0.7.0+\n. This is pretty old now so I'll close it. Please re-open if you still have this issue. You might like to try running lsof -i -n to see what processes are running on what ports to see if there's a collision.\n. Ah, right. You can always lsof or ps to find the mailcatcher process then kill it.\n. Closing this issue due to age. Please re-open if you're still experiencing this.\n. Run mailcatcher from foreman with mailcatcher --foreground. The daemonised mode is a convenience. I don't want to build service management semantics in -- that's your operating system's job. :-)\n. Ruby 2 is fine, but 2.1.x and eventmachine 1.0.4 specifically seems to have problems per #182. Please track them there.\n. This is very strange as I can't replicate this issue. Does it happen all the time, for every message?\n. I still can't reproduce this.\nPlease try upgading to 0.6.0 with gem install mailcatcher. If you're still having issues please feel free to reopen this issue.\n. This is due to #182. Mailcatcher doesn't seem to quit correctly when asked under Ruby 2.1.5.\nPlease try running mailcatcher in the foreground for now. You can ps aux | grep mailcatcher and kill -9 the process if you run into this issue again in the meantime.\n. This seems to be related to #182, please track there.\n. 0.7.0 non-prerelease works fine. And restricting the gem requirements would just mean that this gem wouldn't update based on other dependency restrictions.\n. Yeah mailcatcher shouldn't be in your Gemfile, but I agree that a release is long overdue. First need to fix the eventmachine/2.1.5 issues.\n. Ah, I just pushed a change to build on latest of each minor version.\n. Ah, this must be something that has changed recently. I'll update the README.\n. Actually it looks like php_value should work: http://php.net/manual/en/configuration.changes.php\nPerhaps there's something overriding your configuration? Anyways, this seems like an administrative configuration issue, not an issue with the general guidelines.\n. No I didn't try it, but without the details you've just provided above there didn't seem a need to change something I had previously tried which had worked. Sorry my skim of the PHP docs didn't pick up these changes at first glance. With these details, though, I'm happy to make the change. Thanks!\n. It's a new feature not yet in a released version. :-)\n. Can you provide a full source message which produces this problem?\n. If you can supply a message which reproduces this problem please feel free to reopen the issue. :-)\n. From what I can see of the source you've posted this should work.\nCan you provide a full email source (like one from MailCatcher's Download button) which produces this problem?\n. I believe this is similar to many other issues about encoding. Your mail library is not correctly encoding these characters as quoted printable or similar. You should fix or update your mail library to get this working. Otherwise they may not appear correctly for your intended recipients, either!. Seems to be a bug in the latest version of EventMachine, sadly. -.-\nThe reason it doesn't daemonise until after the eventmachine loop is running is so that port failures can be reported to the user.\nI'll see what's going on upstream in eventmachine. But honestly eventmachine has become a major pain. May see if there's a feasible alternative, maybe even going back to the standard library with a custom select loop.\n. This does seem to be an eventmachine regression.\nPlease try mailcatcher 0.6.0pre1 (gem install mailcatcher --pre) which restricts eventmachine to != 1.0.4. This is only a temporary release until I can fix the eventmachine problem to fix ruby 2.2 compatiblity, or replace eventmachine with something else.\n. @matthewbarram please try mailcatcher 0.6.0pre1 (gem install mailcatcher --pre).\n. This has been worked around in 0.6.0, please upgrade with gem install mailcatcher.\nThe root cause of this has also been lodged as an issue upstream:\nhttps://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine/issues/569\n. Ah, I see:\neventmachine (1.0.5)\nThey must have released a new version which has broken my fix. I'll look into it again.\n. mailcatcher 0.6.1 is out which works with eventmachine up to 1.0.5, and restricts future upgrades.\n. Localhost should always work, I suspect you have an environment problem. Sorry but I'd like to leave it as localhost.\n. The To field in the list of messages and the message header is the list of addresses that SMTP delivered to, not the contents of the To header in the actual email.\nCheck the Source version of your email for the To header.\n. Ruby 2.2 won't work yet because eventmachine 1.0.4 has bugs preventing mailcatcher working, and 1.0.3 doesn't support ruby 2.2. Will keep you posted.\n. (Make sure you're installing mailcatcher as a gem, not with bundler, and run mailcatcher with ruby < 2.2.)\n. Please upgrade to version 0.6.0 with gem install mailcatcher\n. Good point. Fixed on master.\n. What version of ruby are you using? ruby --version\nWhat OS/platform are you on?\nDo you have the json gem? gem list\n. No worries, sorry it didn't work for you.\n. Please try mailcatcher 0.6.0pre1 (gem install mailcatcher --pre)\n. mailcatcher 0.6.1 is out which works with eventmachine up to 1.0.5, and restricts future upgrades.\n. Are you using the mailcatcher web interface in an automated browser, or treating it as an API?\nIf the web interface, try reloading the page before making your assertions. Maybe the websockets aren't working as expected. If so, let me know when browser you're using.\nIf you're using it via an API then the email should be available as soon as your app has finished delivering it. I'd suggest watching the mailcatcher logs (the standard output, you might like to run it with --foreground) during delivery. There will be a message for every mail received the moment it is fully delivered. If you don't see a message when you expect then your app isn't completing the mail delivery when you expect.\nHope this helps.\n. Please try upgrading to version 0.6.0 with gem install mailcatcher\nIf you're still having issues feel free to reopen the issue.\n. Have you tried refreshing the page?\n. What do the rails logs show? Have you tried running mailcatcher --foreground and watching those logs?\n. Please try upgrading to version 0.6.0 with gem install mailcatcher\nIf you're still having issues please feel free to reopen the issue.\n. mailcatcher 0.6.1 is out which works with eventmachine up to 1.0.5, and restricts future upgrades.\n. @john-999 mailcatcher 0.6.1 should only load eventmachine < 1.0.5. Try running with --foreground and watch the logs.\n. Thanks! 1.0.4 is problematic, but if they fix the bugs we should still be compatible with ~> 1.0.0, so I've added != 1.0.4 to the deps in 7533eb.\n. This isn't really relevant to mailcatcher, but is covered by the Action Mailer rails guide.\nFor instance, my host will be different to yours (I use pow), so a copy/paste will actually confuse things.\n. I don't really want to change the instructions everywhere, but I've added a known issue in the readme:\n\nRuby 2.2 / SMTP not working\nMailCatcher does not currently support Ruby 2.2. EventMachine added support in 1.0.4, but regressed other things so is unuseable, even on earlier rubies.\nPlease use Ruby < 2.2 and EventMachine < 1.0.4. You can gem install mailcatcher --pre for a version which restricts to eventmachine < 1.0.4.\n. Don't include mailcatcher in your gemfile. Please see the readme.\n. Not quite, but close. I have a little script which scrapes the readme, renders it, and rewrites it a bit. Need to set it up with a git webhook at some point. Or use github pages.\n\nIn any case, done.\n. Hi Andy,\nThe \"to\" and \"from\" in Mailcatcher shows how your email is actually being sent; who is being sent a copy of your email via SMTP and where your app is claiming the email is from via SMTP. The headers are actually different.\nThis seems to cause a lot of confusion so I'm going to introduce an SMTP log tab soon showing the SMTP session log, and change these fields to \"recipients\" and \"/sender\"\n. MailCatcher needs to listen on SMTP too, rack is not enough. This cannot be done.\n. (If you would like something more rails integrated maybe try https://github.com/basecamp/mail_view)\n. (There is probably also room for another tool which integrates more deeply with rails and hijack's ActionMailer's delivery method in development and serves them via rack without using smtp at all. MailCatcher was designed as a more general solution to the problem, though.) \n. Can you provide an example message triggering this problem?\nSMTP only allows ASCII over the wire so mail messages as source should still be ASCII. Perhaps it is a strange title encoding or similar?\n. I'll happily accept a patch with test cases. The problem here is incompatibility arising from particular gem versions which is difficult to solve.\n. Please try v0.6.5 and create a new issue with a fresh backtrace and breaking source message if you continue having issues.\n. Mail messages generally have time inside them, or folks pipe output into logging tools which can time-tag lines if they like. Is there a compelling use-case to do so?\n. This will be done as part of #298.\n. Yeah this is a long standing issue. Individual deletes aren't replicated across instances either. Time to react/relay the whole thing? :P\n. By design. MailCatcher is an SMTP tool, so show the SMTP details in the table list. The \"From\" in the message display is the RFC822 From header.\n. From and Sender as you describe are both RFC822 headers, part of the message in the lower pane in MailCatcher. SMTP's FROM is provided in the SMTP exchange, per https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc821#section-3.1. The upper table in MailCatcher is SMTP details, and is how/where the message would be delivered. The message details (the lower pane), like the From header, is how a message will be displayed in a mail client. If you want to see if there is a different From and Sender then I suggest looking at the message source which will show all headers.\n. This is a problem with the addon, not with mailcatcher.\n. I'd be happy to accept a patch improving JavaScript message retrieval.\n. Ah right. This should be fixed by #242, then.\n. This only works on systems with sysv init scripts. systemd, upstart and launchd users will need different configurations, among other possibilities. Adding instructions for how to start on every possible configuration would make the readme very long. Instead I'd rather leave people to google \"how to run service at system start up\" or similar and gain some knowledge about their particular systems.\n. It's been designed for development use, but you could probably use it in production if you really wished. Just be in mind that it uses an in-memory store.\n. Started: https://github.com/sj26/mailcatcher/releases\n. Unfortunately Ruby has a habit of leaking memory. In-memory SQLite and EventMachine probably just complicates the whole situation.\nGiven mailcatcher is intended to be a development tool, and not necessarily running all the time this is enough for me. If you'd like to attack it with perftools then patches are welcome!\n. If you'd like something with a better resource profile, there's also MailHog.\n. I'm not seeing a huge impact locally. If you folks would like to provide some profiling information to identify the source I'll happily address it.\n. Here are some memory profiling tools:\nhttps://github.com/SamSaffron/memory_profiler\nhttps://github.com/ruby-prof/ruby-prof\nIf you can run mailcatcher in the foreground using these tools and replicate the memory issues with profiling data then maybe we can figured out what's causing it and fix it. I don't see a lot of unexpected memory use when I use it, but will try and replicate as well.\n. @alexbowers sorry, as I've mentioned above I can't replicate this and nobody is contributing useful data with the suggested tools. Mailtrap seems reasonable for a hosted option. MailHog is another good alternative written in Go and locally hosted like mailcatcher.\n. Yes, it's probably an eventmachine leak.\n. Thanks for the patch!\nThe catchmail binary is actually unrelated to this change, but you're right about the erb template. Committed in d7a4737.\n. https://github.com/sj26/mailcatcher#bundler\n. Fixed in 134a99c9c1a2f75cbe1c94f75cbb58959a0176dc.\n. The icon count is working in Safari, Firefox and IE for me. The title doesn't have a count. Does it need one? In any case, this isn't a bug.\n. Sure, why not.\n. Sorry this should have been merged a while ago. We were overriding the header. -.-'\n. No, thank you. I consider this a non-feature of mailcatcher. Process supervision belongs to your operating system. See #46.\nTo daemonise as a system service which can be sent signals please use something like upstart, systemd, or launchctl, or start-stop-daemon in combination with mailcatcher --foreground.\n. This is a problem with the system configuration, not something mailcatcher can fix. If you have this issue, make sure you're using an absolute path to catchmail and that it uses an absolute path to ruby. The RVM wrapper instructions should help.\n. Closed in favour of #227.\n. Thin 1.6 breaks mailcatcher exiting cleanly. This will need some more work.\n. Yeah I'm closing this in favour of removing Thin completely as part of #298\n. Nice idea.\n. I just added an --http-path option so you can add --http-path=/mailcatcher to mount mailcatcher with a path prefix of /mailcatcher for example. This has been released as 0.7.0.beta1, so you can gem install mailcatcher --pre. Give it a go?. This seems to pop up on some systems, and we haven't identified why. What operating system / ruby version / sqlite version is your system running?\n. Let's fix this by removing sqlite in #298.. Sorry, this is an error with your ruby/openssl install. Make sure ruby -r digest/md5 -r openssl -e \"puts OpenSSL::VERSION\" works on your system before trying MailCatcher. Re-open if the problem persists once openssl is working.\n. Should be fixed by #242\n. This should be fixed by #258 thanks to @grant-mccarriagher, included in v0.6.3. Please update and comment again if you have issues.\n. There have been plans to add persistence support by setting a database path or something for a while now, so we probably won't do this. Nice idea, though!\n. @kenorb that is not a solution for windows.\n@fede91it, @bezin: it sounds like your ruby and sqlite installations are having some issues, probably best tracked in the sqlite gem. Sounds like that issue has been resolved anyway so maybe try updating the sqlite gem and running mailcatcher again. Otherwise please follow up in the sqlite gem.\n. Odd! Sounds like a threading issue. Please try updating mailcatcher and see if it fixes your issues. If not, please comment again.\n. This is by design. Mailcatcher only keeps mail in memory while running.\n. (You could download the mail if you wish to keep it.)\n. They are being done in decoration and this should be fixed.\n. https://github.com/sj26/mailcatcher#api\n```\ndelete all messages\ncurl -X DELETE http://localhost:1080/messages\ndelete message 123\ncurl -X DELETE http://localhost:1080/messages/123\n```\nIf you have that many emails you may want to consider restarting mailcatcher, or clearing the emails occasionally. I'd prefer to keep it simple.\n. Quite right. Have you tested this across different browsers? Some get finnicky about iframe content.\n. /usr/local/bin (where gems usually install their scripts) may no longer be in your PATH thanks to OS X. Try using the full patch to catchmail (you can find it using which catchmail on your shell) instead of /usr/bin/env catchmail in your php configuration. If this doesn't resolve your issue feel free to re-open the issue.\n. Rvm does strange things to gem scripts. Have you tried following the instructions for rvm in the readme?\n. @tymat do you use homebrew on OS X El Capitan? If so, try:\nPKG_CONFIG_PATH=\"$(brew --prefix openssl)/lib/pkgconfig\" gem install eventmachine -v \"1.0.8\"\n. Please upgrade to 0.6.2.\n. Please upgrade and try 0.6.2. Re-open this issue if it does not resolve your issue.\n. See #210, and please try version 0.6.2.\n. Thanks, this sounds like a configuration issue. Closing.\n. Done on master.\n. Thanks. This sounds like an ipv6 configuration issue.\n. env has not moved in El Capitan:\n``` sh\n$ sw_vers\nProductName:    Mac OS X\nProductVersion: 10.11.1\nBuildVersion:   15B42\n$ which env\n/usr/bin/env\n```\nThe location of catchmail is dictated by your ruby setup. If you have the default system ruby, catchmail gets installed in /usr/local/bin:\n```\n$ export PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\"\n$ which ruby\n/usr/bin/ruby\n$ ruby --version\nruby 2.0.0p645 (2015-04-13 revision 50299) [universal.x86_64-darwin15]\n$ sudo gem install mailcatcher\nSuccessfully installed mailcatcher-0.6.1\n$ which catchmail\n/usr/local/bin/catchmail\n```\nI don't use rvm, so am unsure of the default location. I suggest you run which catchmail and use that instead of /usr/bin/env catchmail in your php configuration per the PHP/RVM instructions. Or you could add your RVM script path to your /etc/paths. But this is a problem with your specific environment I'm afraid.\nSadly I cannot accept this PR.\n. This is because OS X El Capitan doesn't include the OpenSSL headers any more (thanks apple).\nIf you've got OpenSSL in homebrew, please try:\nPKG_CONFIG_PATH=\"$(brew --prefix openssl)/lib/pkgconfig\" gem install eventmachine -v \"1.0.8\"\n. Linking openssl into a standard library lookup location means the binary libraries could be loaded by another application which hasn't been built with homebrew. This could have unintended consequences.\nI'd recommend instead compiling and linking things which need homebrew's ssl explicitly, like with the pkg config incantation.\n. Closing, please comment again if the command I posted above doesn't work for you.\n. sigh\nUnfortunately this is probably a leak in eventmachine somewhere. I am unable to diagnose it locally. Latest mailcatcher for me runs stably and even recovers resident memory after a little while.\nIf you'd care to do some delving with https://github.com/tmm1/stackprof and see what's happening that would be wonderful. Otherwise I have no way to reproduce or fix this.\n. No, thank you. I consider this a non-feature of mailcatcher. Process supervision belongs to your operating system. See #46.\nTo daemonise as a system service which can be sent signals please use something like upstart, systemd, or launchctl, or start-stop-daemon in combination with mailcatcher --foreground.\n. Oh! Nice catch, thank you.\n. (There is a more complicated issue. The MailCatcher UI can get out of sync, especially when multiple copies of the UI are open. Probably should investigate using something a little more resilient.)\n. Gemfile.lock has been removed in 433fad4e and we're now using new travis build infrastructure in 0c1a1e41.\n. Eventmachine has been bumped to 1.0.9.1 in 79e023ef and the Gemfile.lock removed in 433fad4e.\n. Mailcatcher does not support rails. We can't guarantee that MailCatcher will simultaneously retain compatibility with all versions of activesupport so it will track dependencies independently.\nPlease see https://github.com/sj26/mailcatcher#bundler\n. @ACPK sorry, my wording was a bit confusing!\nMailCatcher supports receiving email from rails. But it is an independent gem and should not be included in your Gemfile. Your rails application's dependencies may be entirely different to MailCatcher's, potentially conflicting.\nI hope that's clearer. :smile: \n. The solution is: don't put MailCatcher in your Gemfile. It is an independent tool. Install MailCatcher with gem install mailcatcher\n. For rails you could put it into your bin/setup script. Think of MailCatcher like MySQL or Postgres, or your other application dependencies. :-). If you're running mailcatcher from github you'll need to bundle install. Make sure you git pull origin master first. Does that fix your issue?\n. I think this is because rubygems is terrible.\nI managed to replicate this by installing rails beta (have you done that too?) then installing mailcatcher and running mailcatcher. Thin quite happily activates rack-2.0.0.alpha (installed by rails 5), but sinatra requires \"~> 1.5\", hence why it can't activate and load sinatra.\nRubygems doesn't seem to lock activates gems dependencies before they're required. Mailcatcher explicitly specifies which gems it needs, and what versions they should be. Rubygems should be able to resolve a working set from these. But I guess it can't, and that's why we invented Bundler.\nArgh.\n. Right. So I've made mailcatcher explicitly activate its gem dependencies. Please install 0.6.4 and see if it solves your issues.\n. @NullVoxPopuli please see #267.\n. This isn't quite semantially correct. 4.9.9 is not the maximum version number before 5.0.0.beta1 or any other pre-release. Rubygems pre-release versioning is a bit strange.\nBut requiring ~> 4.0 should work because it converts pre-release versions to release versions for comparison. I've added this as a requirement on master. Please pull and try the latest master.\n. Can you provide an example email, full source, which triggers this error?\n. Please try v0.6.5 and reopen with a source message causing the error and fresh backtrace if you're still having issues.\n. You could do this by wrapping mailcatcher in a reverse proxy. I'm not sure I see a use case for putting it in the gem itself. What do you have in mind?\n. This looks like a rubygems bug, folks. Not sure what, I can't replicate it. What version of rubygems are you using? (Post the output of gem environment).\n. Can you also please post the full stack trace? The meaningful bit is probably in the middle somewhere.\n. Right. So I've made mailcatcher explicitly activate its gem dependencies. Please install 0.6.4 and see if it solves your issues.\n. I still can't reproduce this. It might be based on the combination of gems installed. Anybody affected could you please provide as much information as possible: what is your ruby version, how is it installed, the full output of gem environment and gem list.\n. I've just noticed: everybody seems to be using rvm, and gemsets. Have you tried installing without gemsets?\n. @GuillaumeLegendre I've installed the same version of rvm, ruby, created a gemset, and installed all the same gems and versions, but I don't see the error:\nhttps://gist.github.com/sj26/35dc5e343d45f0177a07\nAre your gems distributed between your gemsets? Which are in global versus investissement_pierre?\n. @jaydorsey thanks! That sounds exactly like the problem. It only seems to occur in rvm with gemsets. Seems rvm does some magic with bundler and bundler-unload. This sounds likely:\nhttps://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/issues/1420#issuecomment-167939914\nThere is a patch proposed:\nhttps://gist.github.com/mpapis/bac6163f8855e12f7833\nI haven't tried reproducing using bundler but I'll give it a go.\n. This is unfortunately a bug in the combination of Rubygems, Bundler and RVM, not something controllable within MailCatcher itself. @charazn's instructions per the README are the safest way to install MailCatcher with RVM.\n. It doesn't.\nIt seems to happen in a particular edge case with rubygems, rvm and bundler. MailCatcher being an independent gem often used within projects with similar dependencies using bundler seems to hit the edge case more often.\n. Please try upgrading rubygems and mailcatcher and open a new issue with a fresh backtrace if you're still having issues.\n. Not as part of the core project, no. I'd be open to a third party packager?\nI'll close this, reopen if you come up with a prototype or ideas.\n. Can you not filter in your consumer?\n. I'd consider adding this, but would prefer to do so carefully. If you'd like something which works already maybe try MailHog \u2014 they seem to have a search endpoint.\n. Ah, I see the use case. Have you tried something like:\n``` ruby\nHTTParty.get(\"http://localhost:1080/messages\").any? { |message| message[\"sender\"].include? \"me@sj26.com\" }\n=> true\n``\n. Hmm, weird! Please try upgrading to v0.6.5, running withmailcatcher --foregroundand see if the error still occurs. If so, please reopen with a fresh backtrace.\n. Please try v0.6.5 and reopen with a fresh backtrace if you're still having issues.\n. Sorry, after browsing the [codebeat page for mailcatcher](https://codebeat.co/projects/github-com-sj26-mailcatcher) there are no quick wins that I consider a problem, or for which I would probably accept a pull request. I like the size, simplicity, and encapsulation level of theMailCatcher::Mail` module, and neither of the two repeated methods would be better extracted, imho.\nHappy to be proven wrong with a compelling change. :-)\n. This is a repository for MailCatcher, a ruby tool.\nFor help getting started with Ruby and Rails I suggest reaching out to the Ruby on Rails community asking your question on Stack Overflow, or jumping on the #rubyonrails IRC channel on irc.freenode.net.\nGood luck!\n. MailCatcher itself hasn't changed and remains compatible with Ruby 1.9. It seems upstream dependencies of the mail gem have precluded 1.9 and Rubygems isn't smart enough to limit its dependency resolution to the ruby version. :-(\nIf you manually install a mime-types-data gem version for 1.9 before installing mailcatcher it might work.\n. Try this, which worked for me on ruby 1.9.3-p551 with an empty gemset:\n```\n$ gem install mime-types --version \"< 3\"\nFetching: mime-types-2.99.1.gem (100%)\nSuccessfully installed mime-types-2.99.1\n1 gem installed\n$ gem install mailcatcher --conservative\nFetching: i18n-0.7.0.gem (100%)\nFetching: json-1.8.3.gem (100%)\nBuilding native extensions.

There is already an issue in rubygems: rubygems/rubygems#968\n. MailCatcher still works on Ruby 1.9, see my instructions above. A better solution requires changes within rubygems which are unlikely soon, and over which I have no control.\nClosing because more +1s aren't useful and its outside mailcatcher's control.\n. To install on Ruby 1.9:\ngem install mime-types --version \"< 3\"\ngem install --conservative mailcatcher\nYou will get an error but it worked; try running mailcatcher.\n. If you have trouble installing mailcatcher on ruby 1.9, please try:\ngem install mime-types --version \"< 3\"\ngem install --conservative mailcatcher\nIf this doesn't work, please file a new issue.. Default behavior for action mailer in development is not to raise delivery errors. This is included in the default config/environments/development.rb:\n# Don't care if the mailer can't send.\n  config.action_mailer.raise_delivery_errors = false\nHave you changed this setting?\n. Oh, you mean you would like a fallback method?\n. I've added this to the README under the Rails recommendation.\n. This feature doesn't currently work. I'll see if I can polish it up for release. This has been a common request, and it probably couldn't hurt.\n. I haven't had time to fix it up yet, sorry. Feel free to take a stab if you like.\n. Neat, thanks!\n. Oh no! \ud83d\ude35\nWhat version of linux, which browser are you using, and what is its version? And what version of windows, which browser, and its version?\n. Internet Explorer 9 does not support websockets, but it should still be polling. Have you tried refreshing the page? Are there any javascript errors?\n. Can you run mailcatcher -f and confirm that the output shows mailcatcher is receiving the message?\n. Just to clarify:\nYou're running MailCatcher on Linux, sending it email over smtp, viewing the web interface on your Linux computer in Firefox and the messages appear, and viewing the web interface on your Windows machine in Internet explorer but the messages do not appear, even if you refresh the page, except sometimes they appear after some time?\nI really am not sure what's going on here, sorry. :-(\nWeird browser caching by internet explorer? Have you tried a hard refresh, with Shift+F5?\n. Yeah, sorry I'm not sure I can fix this one. If you're able to provide some screenshots/logs from IE showing the failure maybe I can fix it, and reopen this if you do, but otherwise I'm unable to reproduce.\n. JSON is included in the ruby standard library, but is 1.8.something now I think. I wonder what is depending on \"~> 1.7\".\nThe docker build is actually broken for me because the ruby version is too old and mime-types-data won't install. I'll update the Dockerfile generally.\n. I've just used the ruby:2.3 base image and installed the gem. Works a treat!\nThanks for alerting to the issue.\n. (Note we can't use ruby:slim because it doesn't include enough headers for gem compilation, or things like sqlite3. We could probably slim down the image by uninstalling ruby development dependencies once the gems are installed then collapsing FS layers, but it works as-is.)\n. Ah, this is a duplicate of #227\n. Please try v0.6.5 and reopen with a fresh backtrace if you're still having issues.\n. Merged (manually)!\n. This is super difficult because your application could send multiple messages with the same Message-ID (although it shouldn't). This feature won't be added to MailCatcher core at the moment, although maybe in the future there will be a better search API.\nMaybe use the MailCatcher API to walk the messages and find the one you're after.\n. Please try v0.6.5 and reopen with a fresh backtrace if you're still having issues.\n. Oh no!\nCan you please provide a full example email which triggers this problem? You can just click Download in MailCatcher.\n. Please try v0.6.5 and see if it solves your problem. Otherwise please reopen with a full message source which triggers the error in MailCatcher. Thanks!\n. That's a very old version of mailcatcher: 0.2.4.\nPlease try upgrading: gem install mailcatcher\n. Nope, sorry, I consider this out of scope. This tool isn't mean to be Gmail, and doesn't purport to sandbox email because there's no hope we could ever get it right. This is why MailCatcher only binds to 127.0.0.1 by default.\n. Yeah, fair call. I've removed the activesupport dependency entirely which fixed encoding behaviour considerably, and also made mail and websocket handling more resilient so hopefully more of the encoding errors go away or at least give useful feedback. v0.6.5 released, get it while it's hot.\n. Thanks for your contribution!\nThese are locked down for reasons. Thin/skinny and sinatra all require pre 2.0 versions of rack.\nWhy does MailCatcher need gem compatibility with Rails 5? It shouldn't be in your Gemfile.\n. Bundler, sadly, is not designed as a generic distribution system, but as a specific application dependency manager. The interplay of installing first with Rubygems, then with Bundler, or magically bundling during gem post_install or something, seems cumbersome and error prone.\nI'm working on a version of MailCatcher which uses no compiled native gems and vendors all dependencies as this is the only way I can think of to remove this category of issue once and for all. I'll let you know when it's ready for beta. :-)\n. Rack 2+ is not compatible with mailcatcher at this time. This pull request breaks things.\nDo not put mailcatcher in your Gemfile. Put it in bin/setup in your rails projects.. Sorry you folks are having trouble. Windows and ruby is always a pain. Please try the latest rubyinstaller. Otherwise make sure you can ruby -r sqlite3 from a console. You can also run mailcatcher in the foreground to see what it's doing if it seems to die silently with mailcatcher --foreground. Reopen this issue with more details from those commands if it's still affecting you.\n. Yeah the API is definitely the best bet. You could write a little mailcatcher cli gem if you like. But I probably won't roll it into mailcatcher core. Thanks!\n. This is more and more necessary given how EventMachine, Thin, and the whole ruby world have moved on.\nRefactoring into a pure-ruby threaded smtp + http server with some basic websocket support would probably be fine. I might take a look at this tonight while I'm on a plane. I've been procrastinating for far too long.. You need to bundle exec:\nbundle exec rake assets\nPackage the gem with rake, too:\nbundle exec rake package\nThere is a major rework in progress which will probably get rid of a lot of these issues.\n. Yeah sorry I pushed a fix for that to master.\n. See https://github.com/sj26/mailcatcher/issues/277#issuecomment-209154903. Try:\ngem install mime-types --version \"< 3\"\ngem install --conservative mailcatcher\n. No worries, it should probably go in the README or something, although I have a longer term fix in the works. ^_^\n. Good idea! There are a bunch of events which should be propagated client side which aren't, and this is one of them. I've got a clientside rework in progress which should fix this.\n. Please don't put MailCatcher in your Gemfile. It is an application in its own right with its own dependencies that can't possibly interoperates with every version of rails.\nSimply:\ngem install mailcatcher\nmailcatcher\nYou can put the gem install in your bin/setup if you like.\nAlternately, I just removed activesupport as a dependency in the latest MailCatcher release. You could try upgrading.\n. That looks like you're sending utf-8 characters as part of a plain text encoding, which mail clients will expect to be ASCII. Can you try something like:\n```php\n$subject = 'Test';\n$headers = \"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8\"\n$body = '\u00e4\u00f6\u00fc';\nif(mail('test@test.com', $subject, $body, $headers)) {\n    echo 'sent';\n} else {\n    echo 'not sent';\n}\n```\nIf this doesn't work please re-open with a full message body as PHP sends it so I can reproduce.. Good point! If there were an easy, compatible way to make MailCatcher bind to the loopback interface addresses automagically I would, but it's not that easy. So this change is a good idea. Thanks!\n. Nice find! Shows how many folks use MailCatcher programmatically, haha. Thanks!\n. Oh no! I'm sorry that's not working for you.\nI've just tried this myself locally and I get the correct result:\n\nCould you confirm a few details for me?\n- What version of MailCatcher are you running? (mailcatcher --version)\n- What version of Ruby are you running? (ruby --version)\n- What gems do you have installed? (gem list)\nThis smells like a ruby version issue. Older ruby wasn't great at encodings.\n. @jbouzekri that's an older version of mailcatcher, and it looks like the docker image has moved on. Have you tried doing docker pull schickling/mailcatcher?\n$ docker run --rm -it schickling/mailcatcher mailcatcher --version\nmailcatcher 0.6.5\n. This should be fixed in the most recent version.. Anybody affected by this issue: could you please upload a message body which triggers this error so I can reproduce and perhaps fix this issue.. I'm sorry it's not working for you, but it works fine for me:\n\nCould you please provide an example message which doesn't work?\nHere's an example I tried using the Ruby mail gem (which is how mailcatcher reads email, too):\nsh\n$ ruby --require mail\nirb> Mail.defaults { delivery_method :smtp, address: \"localhost\", port: 1025 }\nirb> Mail.new(to: \"foo@example.com\", from: \"bar@example.com\", subject: \"H\u00e9llo\", body: \"H\u00e9llo\").deliver\nNon US-ASCII detected and no charset defined.\nDefaulting to UTF-8, set your own if this is incorrect.\n=> #<Mail::Message:70286438842840, Multipart: false, Headers: <Date: Sat, 10 Dec 2016 22:03:55 +1100>, <From: bar@example.com>, <To: foo@example.com>, <Message-ID: <584be11b4fedf_f54e3fecd483f9b8284c8@Bumblebee.local.mail>>, <Subject: H\u00e9llo>, <Mime-Version: 1.0>, <Content-Type: text/plain>, <Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64>>\nAnd the message body it sent:\n```http\nDate: Sat, 10 Dec 2016 22:03:55 +1100\nFrom: bar@example.com\nTo: foo@example.com\nMessage-ID: 584be11b4fedf_f54e3fecd483f9b8284c8@Bumblebee.local.mail\nSubject: =?UTF-8?Q?H=C3=A9llo?=\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain;\n charset=UTF-8\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: base64\nSMOpbGxv\n```\nThis also works:\n```http\nDate: Sat, 10 Dec 2016 22:03:55 +1100\nFrom: bar@example.com\nTo: foo@example.com\nMessage-ID: 584be11b4fedf_f54e3fecd483f9b8284c8@Bumblebee.local.mail\nSubject: =?UTF-8?Q?H=C3=A9llo?=\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain;\n charset=UTF-8\nH\u00e9llo\n```\nPerhaps you are missing a charset in your mail header?. I'm going to close this for now. If somebody has an issue with character encodings in mailcatcher please provide the full message body (with headers and mime) along with the errors it is triggering as a new issue.. Please upgrade rubygems:\ngem update --system\n. What about if the \"Clear\" button confirms the first time after page load, then just works silently from that point on?\nYour second suggestion I think would be covered by #266. I don't wish to constrict folks using newer ruby from running later versions of these gems. They might solve other issues and bugs.\nIt is an unfortunate caveat of rubygems that it doesn't consider ruby version compatibility when resolving dependencies. You can force it to by installing a compatible version of mime-types explicitly first, then mailcatcher:\ngem install mime-types --version \"< 3\"\ngem install --conservative mailcatcher. I'm sorry that you see a fix for your specific situation which you think should be applied here, but I do not believe it is an improvement for the whole.\nMailCatcher works on the latest Ruby with the latest mail and mime-type gems, and that's the way I recommend running it. The dependencies are open because it should work with future versions, given mail follows semantic versioning. The mail gem's message parsing and compatibility is always improving, so using the latest version is not an imagined improvement, but a real one.\nIf you want or need to constrict your ruby version to 1.9, I've made sure MailCatcher itself works with 1.9 and its dependencies have versions which are available there. How those dependencies are installed might be trickier, but there is a way to make it work.. Yes, please remove the gem from your gemfile and install with rubygems and run directly instead.. Sorry, I have no idea why this happens! Maybe you need to recompile your rbenv ruby? If you can figure it out and would like to contribute it would be most welcome.. You could also try: gem pristine eventmachine\nThis seems like a environment issue, closing without further details.. Because bumping minor versions of eventmachine breaks a lot of stuff, historically.\nI'll try out 1.2.1 some time and bump it if nothing breaks.. Thanks for the contribution!\nI don't want to allow all origins at everything all the time for everybody because it's a potential security hole. MailCatcher runs on a known port, so if I can get a visitor to come to a malicious page where I control javascript and probe port 1080 then I can start controlling your MailCatcher instance, and potentially probe for and exploit vulnerabilities.\nMaybe if it were opt-in?. Nice idea!. Ah, I can replicate this! But I had to netcat to mailcatcher directly to perform an SMTP exchange and paste your exact mail message:\n```\n$ nc localhost 1025\nEHLO localhost\n250-Ok EventMachine SMTP Server\n250-NO-SOLICITING\n250 SIZE 20000000\nMAIL FROM:hidden@email.com\n250 Ok\nRCPT TO:hidden@email.com\n250 Ok\nDATA\n354 Send it\nFrom: =?UTF-8?B?Q29tcHRhYmlsaXTDqSBPcm1pZWw=?= hidden@email.com\nTo: Name hidden@email.com\nDate: Thu, 29 Dec 2016 08:38:30 +0000\nMessage-ID: 43670e26007741bdbc30af51fb06d641@compta.local.phea.fr\nSubject: [Ormiel] =?UTF-8?B?UsOpaW5pdGlhbGlzYXRpb24gZHUgbW90IGRlIHBhc3Nl?=\nMIME-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\nhtml PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN\"\n\n\nEmail/html\n\n\nBonjour Olivier,\nVous avez demand\u00e9 un nouveau mot de passe pour le site Comptabilit\u00e9.\nSi vous n'avez pas fait cette demande, ignorez cette email.\n\nSi vous souhaitez un nouveau mot de passe, cliquez sur le lien ci-dessous\nJe r\u00e9initialise mon mot de passe\n\n\n.\n250 Message accepted\nQUIT\n221 Ok\n```\nThe message is received and stored, but then I get the error you quote from the thread sending the websocket message:\nException: \"\\xC3\" from ASCII-8BIT to UTF-8\nThis is because Eventmachine's SMTP server has just read the message as a bunch of bytes and marked it as \"ASCII\" encoded (which is the correct default SMTP network encoding), stored it as such, and when we actually try to use the message for presentation it attempts to convert it to the JSON-compatible UTF-8 encoding, but it has invalid ASCII characters.\nIt took me a little while to figure this out: Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit is an SMTP extension. Eventmachine's SMTP server does not support it, and should be throwing an error earlier in the exchange. Your Mail/SMTP library is submitted an 8-bit encoded message to an SMTP server that is not advertising 8-bit compatibility. It should be formatting as quoted-printable or similar. Running this message through catchmail (which uses the mail gem which sanitizes quite a lot and respects SMTP capabilities) actually changes it to something the SMTP server supports:\n```\nDate: Thu, 29 Dec 2016 08:38:30 +0000\nFrom: =?UTF-8?B?Q29tcHRhYmlsaXTDqSBPcm1pZWw=?= hidden@email.com\nTo: Name hidden@email.com\nMessage-ID: 43670e26007741bdbc30af51fb06d641@compta.local.phea.fr\nSubject: =?UTF-8?Q?[Ormiel]_R=C3=A9initialisation_du_mot_de_passe?=\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/html;\n charset=UTF-8\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\nhtml PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN\"\n\n\nEmail/html\n\n\nBonjour Olivier,\nVous avez demand=C3=A9 un nouveau mot de passe pour le site Comptabili=\nt=C3=A9.\nSi vous n'avez pas fait cette demande, ignorez cette email.\n\nSi vous souhaitez un nouveau mot de passe, cliquez sur le lien ci-dess=\nous\nJe r=C3=A9=\ninitialise mon mot de passe\n\n\n```\nBut the message content is exactly the same.\nIf you'd like to fix the SMTP server in Eventmachine to support 8-bit transfer encoding implicitly (which is kinda incorrect but lenient) then this might go away?. UTF-8 is not valid over the wire for SMTP unless the mail server advertises 8-bit encoding, which MailCatcher does not. If you a receiving errors here then I'm afraid you or your mail library is not correctly encoding your sent email and you should probably make sure that is fixed so your mail is received correctly.. @thebarty please re-open or file another issue if the latest version of mailcatcher and the above fix aren't working for you.. UTF-8 is not valid over the wire for SMTP unless the mail server advertises 8-bit encoding, which MailCatcher does not. If you a receiving errors here then I'm afraid you or your mail library is not correctly encoding your sent email and you should probably make sure that is fixed so your mail is received correctly.. See https://github.com/sj26/mailcatcher/issues/277#issuecomment-209154903. Hi @koalabear974, I don't have a Windows system to get this running myself but if you want to contribute a patch it would be most welcome! Otherwise I'm afraid I'm unable to fix this and will close.. UTF-8 is not valid over the wire for SMTP unless the mail server advertises 8-bit encoding, which MailCatcher does not. If you a receiving errors here then I'm afraid you or your mail library is not correctly encoding your sent email.. SMTP is by default a 7-bit protocol:\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc821#page-3\nSo bodies containing bytes which require the high bit set must be encoded in some other form, usually quoted printable. The mail gem (used within rails) should probably be doing this for you transparently.\nSMTP was only extended later to 8-bit by RFC5321 and then only when the server advertises a 8BITMIME capability which MailCatcher does not. . The message[\"source\"] is not decoded, it should be the literal SMTP transmitted message body which should be 7-bit ascii (which is valid utf-8). If you're getting an encoding error here then the message wasn't encoded properly and isn't a clean 7-bit subset of utf-8, so forcing it to be utf-8 by replacing bad characters is going to munge the source and lie about your message over json.. The only decoded part is that lines with double periods would be replaced with single periods.. The real solve here would be to make sure that the message source when received via SMTP contains only valid 7-bit bytes and raise the error earlier with clearer instructions on how to fix it in the sender.. (or just rewrite the whole smtp server and build in 8bit mime support supporting first-class encodings and again raising errors earlier in the smtp exchange when invalid content is supplied.). That's a very old version of sqlite3 (over 10 years!). Sounds like the sqlite3 gem isn't going to work with that version (\"Note that this module is only compatible with SQLite 3.6.16 or newer\"). Perhaps try upgrading it?. @tesmond you can try installing an earlier version, but it may not be easy to resolve all the interdependencies (ymmv).\nIt looks like https://github.com/sparklemotion/sqlite3-ruby/commit/f87fc04932d56c8d8f51706e511ef16bd5f0b253 documented the dependency corresponding to the v1.3.5 tag. Maybe try v1.3.4:\n$ gem install sqlite3 -v 1.3.4\nThen try installing mailcatcher again conservatively, it should work with any 1.3 version of the sqlite3 gem:\n$ gem install mailcatcher --conservative. Given there's been no activity here for a while I'll close this one.. Weird! Do you have any browser extensions installed?. Ah, lprequeststart, lprequestend and lpsubmit are solid hints \u2014 it's LastPass.. I'm not sure, sorry, but this seems like a LastPass bug. Maybe you can exclude MailCatcher from within LastPass? . This looks like a bug in LastPass (see #331).. Sorry, I don't know or use PHP. \ud83d\ude05 Can you copy the full source of the message from the Source tab and paste it here?. Ah, so email headers finish and the body begins at the first double newline. So your headers are finishing at:\nReply-To: mysite\nSo the MIME and content-type headers are being seen as part of the body, so ignored. Perhaps you need to take a look at how you're calling the PHP mail function, or how you're appending those headers?. Both have open compatibility issues and subtly break skinny and mailcatcher unfortunately.\nIf somebody wants to do an upgrade and fix the compatibility in a PR that'd be great! I'm more inclined to semi-rewrite MailCatcher eschewing the C extensions for something a bit more portable with completely vendored gems, though. I had a wip a while back. I'm on a plane later today, might give it a crack.. (Also note that MailCatcher works fine in ruby 2.4, just issues warnings.). Puma doesn\u2019t use eventmachine so doesn\u2019t fit in event loop for smtp and websockets.. MailCatcher does not have an IMAP interface.\nYou might try using the API, though.. The From is the FROM address supplied when the mail is sent via SMTP, not the value from the RFC822 From header (but the address component is usually the same if your mail-sending library is working correctly). If you want to double-check the From header take a look inside the Source tab. :-). Hi @samdjstevens! Sadly that sounds like it might be your script or mail library might be buffering the messages somehow. MailCatcher should display messages as soon as they are received over the SMTP connection.\nDo you have an example I can run to replicate the problem?. Ah, glad you got it sorted out! :-). I'd love to do this! But I have no idea how.\nI tried a while ago to offer integration with a service that did this, but then they wanted lots of money and this is an open source tool. Something like Litmus would be cool. But they're all paid services which require integration keys and things.\nThe best I could figure out was to offer a Download button and let folks upload to their email testing service of choice.\nI'm going to close this for now, because I don't think we can do anything more, but if you think of a way to do this please comment further!. Does the current docker image not work for you?\n$ docker run sj26/mailcatcher\nStarting MailCatcher\n==> smtp://0.0.0.0:1025\n==> http://0.0.0.0:1080.

I'm curious why it's not working for you, but afaik this is all working as intended, so I'll close this. Sounds like you've got a solve for you problem: using a forked Dockerfile. Thanks. :-). Latest thin breaks websockets. Can't merge.. I don't think the gems are even compatible here, I'm afraid. We've already tried this in #226.. Sadly there is no way to know. The underlying error message is:\n```\n\n```\nIf you can figure it out then patches are welcomed! :-). Mailcatcher is locked to a particular version of eventmachine because it tends to break very easily. Unfortunately rubygems doesn't seem to respect intergem dependencies very well so the wrong versions are often activated. :-(. Your solution here is the correct solution, for now:\n$ gem uninstall eventmachine\n$ gem install eventmachine -v 1.0.9.1\nLonger term this should be solved by #298. mailcatcher 0.6.5 runs just fine for me on macOS 10.12.6 using Ruby 2.4.1. Support for macOS and 2.4.x are fine.\nCould you please elaborate on \"The web portal won't load properly\" - what exactly does this mean \u2014\u00a0nothing loads at all? no messages are shown? the connection is interrupted?\nWhat version of macOS are you running? High Sierra has known problems with programs which daemonise, which MailCatcher does. Try running mailcatcher --foreground on High Sierra and see if that helps.\nIt does look like MailCatcher is failing to listen to the ports correctly or daemonise somehow.. Have you reinstalled ruby or something recently? It looks like your installed version of thin can't talk to your installed version of ruby.\nTry:\ngem pristine --all. Oh dear, that's no good \u2014 sorry!\nDo you have a full message body which when sent to MailCatcher triggers this behaviour? I need to reproduce it to fix it. :-). Hey Michael,\nThat's just what I was planning! I've cherry-picked your changes a little to keep the bundle config out of the gem.\nThanks!\n. That's cool, I had meant to pop one in -- have done so now. Thanks!\n. Thanks for your interest!\nIt sounds like whatever you're using to send mail is doing some funky things with the protocol. You should only be sending a single \"MAIL\" command which includes the from address, then you can send as many \"RCPT TO\" commands as you like to add multiple unique senders. MailCatcher should handle that fine. Maybe check out the SMTP RFC for details.\n. Glad you've found a solution.\nI don't want to build a workaround into MailCatcher for broken clients, perhaps you can patch SwiftMailer? In the meantime you know how to get it working. :-)\n. @pjb3 you can certainly send multiple MAIL commands, but it should reset the state of the SMTP exchange. The SwiftMailer client was sending multiple MAIL commands for a single message.\nYour issue is slightly different\u2014you should indeed be able to send multiple messages sequentially over the same connection. MailCatcher is set up to do so, the problem is in eventmachine. A repeat MAIL command should reset the state instead of the current error-out behaviour. They haven't fixed it in master either. Send a pull request! Should be simple to slice the state array and send a receive_reset, which should have the same semantic value.\n. Ah, it looks like daemonizing is a bit broken on Windows under Ruby 1.8.7.\nPlease run mailcatcher --foreground for now until I can release a workaround. :-)\n. @kimptoc, yeah looks like 1.8.7 has slightly different precedence rules and had a problem with the windows fix.\nI've tested on all the rubies I have now and it seems fine. 0.4.2! -.-\n. Thanks for the pull request but these things have already been resolved on master and in the latest MailCatcher gem. Please grab the latest gem or pull master on your git repo if you're still encountering issues on your end. Let me know if there are still problems!\n. Merged in 55790a91a41eb3db316217717364def1dc56bf05, thanks!\n. Could you please confirm this? It works fine for me in Chrome 12.0.742.112.\n. What about adding an accurate last-modified? This was always my intention.\nOn 11/06/2011, at 4:18 AM, pnc wrote:\n\nAdd HTML5 shim script so the app renders in IE8.\nSet an expires header for non-Websocket requests. This prevents IE8 from only loading the message JSON the first time the page loads and getting a 304 Not Modified thereafter.\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/sj26/mailcatcher/pull/10\n. Closing due to inactivity. Will integrate new HTML5 shim at some point.\n. Okay, I've merged in something similar which also copes with (improbably) blank sender and recipient fields also. Thanks!\n\nAlso added guard gems in Gemfile and modified Guardfile to use compass instead of sass so stylesheets are regenerated properly. Apologies, the public development process was a bit crufty. :-/\n. Hmm? Where does it asplode? I don't directly require growl anywhere... if it asplodes for you it's a guard bug, or you need to bundle!\n. I was just about to suggest --help. :-)\n. Can you run the second command in Terminal? Do you have growlnotify installed? (It's normally inside the Growl installation DMG, just not installed by default.)\nYou shouldn't need to explicitly turn on Growl. If you are on OS X and have growlnotify installed, MailCatcher will detect it. The switch is there mainly as a guide and gives instructions on how to get it working.\n. Awesome! MailCatcher primarily deals with SMTP, so we're not listing the \"To\" field, but rather the recipients which includes CC and BCC addresses. Perhaps the message view should actually display the \"To\" and \"Cc\" fields? You won't be able to display BCC because these aren't listed in the message itself and will only be present as recipients on the SMTP side of things. Or maybe you can extrapolate who's BCC'd by doing a set exclusion?\n. Closing this; To/Cc/Bcc is actually irrelevant, recipients (\"To\" in the web interface) is a list of all recipients targeted via SMTP.\n. It lists all recipients that the application is sending to via SMTP. Keep in mind the SMTP server doesn't know the difference\u2014they are all just recipients. Perhaps I should rename the \"To\" field to \"Recipients\" and add a note or something.\nYour application or the library you're using to send SMTP messages should be turning your \"To\", \"Cc\" and \"Bcc\" fields into a list of recipients that are all addressed via SMTP.\ntl;dr: yes.\n. As above, cc and bcc fields are displayed when you view an email. This is already implemented.\n. BCC addresses should never appear in an email's message source, they are Blind Carbon Copy addresses so you don't want to reveal them in the message.\nTo, CC, and BCC addresses do currently appear in the \"To\" recipients list in the MailCatcher interface. Although MailCatcher doesn't look in your message to find these, this is the list of addresses that your SMTP client has asked the message be delivered to. The \"To\" list is exactly the email addresses that your message will be delivered to.. Nice, thanks!\n. Yeah, I usually take those as read but should probably indeed be listed as gem deps. Thanks!\n. Nice one, cheers!\n. MailCatcher is not designed to be used inside rails but rather alongside. Use gem install mailcatcher and run with mailcatcher, do not include mailcatcher in your rails project's Gemfile.\n. Thanks Gregor, missed that one. I've been living in 1.9 land recently. :-)\n. Doable! Patches are very welcome. Otherwise I'll take a look when I get the chance.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks! This is exactly what I was after. Fiddled with it a bit, will be in 0.5.5.\n. Thanks to #26 we can now display the fractal analysis in pretty HTML, so no need to pretty-print machine formats.\n. Great idea, I'll do so when I can. Pull requests are also welcome!\n. Offset change merged, made sure only valid dates are adjusted.\nThanks!\n. Perhaps the delivery methods are being stubbed out or you are using some test helpers preventing actual delivery of mail? Keep in mind that MailCatcher is just an SMTP server so as long as mail delivery is configured properly in your application it should work.\nWe use mailcatcher from rspec tests all the time and it works great. :-)\n. Thanks!\n. I'm not bumping the dependency until 1.0 is released, but I'll leave this issue open until this happens.\nFeel free to grab the source, test and post resutls! I don't use Windows.\n. No worries. :-)\n. Unfortunate that EventMachine hasn't released a stable release since 2009. :-(\nMaybe I should just bump the requirement...\n. Can you please check you're running the very latest versions of mail catcher and eventmachine? This shoul have been fixed by a couple of patches and their reaching 1.0.\n. I'm using box-sizing to size the iframe because traditional methods are not fun. Doesn't look like compass thinks opera supports this, I'll have a play when I get a chance to see if it does these days.\nI'm also happy to accept cross-browser patches.\n. Hi there!\nApart from the websocket hole, I'm not keen on adding authentication support explicitly to the project. I'd like to keep the application itself simple, and it's intended to be run by a developer on a single machine.\nI'd suggest firewalling and proxying the application (with something websocket enabled like Pound) if you have such a requirement.\nAn alternative would be to customise the MailCatcher startup script a little and insert your own authentication middleware into the stack, pretty sure Rack provides some standard some-such which should work.\n. Yeah, Debian's ruby scene is pretty broken. Check out http://ryanbigg.com/2010/12/ubuntu-ruby-rvm-rails-and-you/.\n. Ruby is an interesting thing on Ubuntu/Debian. You're probably better off installing some sort of ruby from scratch instead of using the apt versions. gem install mailcatcher should have covered everything.\n. Good catch! Will roll this into the next update.\nThat link's not working any more, but I found the which_s function which seems to be what you describe.\n. I like this idea!\n. Sorry yes, closed.\n. This sounds like a great addition! I'll take a look tonight.\n. Sorry I didn't get around to this yet. I think it underlies some things I wanted to investigate for notifications in general. Mountain Lion's UserNotificationCenter should be supported, and Growl support should be more comprehensive with clickbacks. Doing something on Windows would be cool, also. This is getting high on my TODO list, will keep you posted.\n. Possible that Firefox's websockets have become incompatible, I'll look into it.\n. Sorry this took a while, finally got a chance to check it out. Fixed in 0.5.7.2.\n. Hmm, I disagree about the difficulty of opening the URL\u2014especially with iTerm (try a command+click)\u2014but I like the idea in general. I don't like the inclusion of launchy, that has become very unwieldy where a simple open/start /b works fine. Let me see what I can do.\n. This looks awesome!\n. Sorry, this one slipped my mind! Will merge.\n. Please don't include mailcatcher in your Gemfile, it is a standalone application with it's own dependency set.\nThese changes would break forwards compatibility.\nMailcatcher should be installed as a separate gem (gem install mailcatcher) which is simply run as mailcatcher.\nGlad you're enjoying it, though! :-)\n. I don't understand why you'd use MailCatcher for automated testing? ActionMailer will store your deliveries locally in testing anyway in a way that makes it easy to run assertions.\nCheck the rails guide: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html#mailer-testing\nIf you have a more complex scenario I'd love to know how and why you're using MailCatcher, maybe we can make it easier!\n. You can assert the correctness of css selectors the same as you would asset the html structure and applied css of your normal page views, if that's what you actually want to test. Take a look at email_spec for instance which adds some more comprehensive introspection abilities for email bodies.\nIf you want to test the look and feel of your application I suspect you're trying to QA and you might like to consider something like mail_view which lets you render each email without having to trigger it's generation and sending. You still need someone looking at the rendered emails and checking off a list.\n. If you want to use MailCatcher as the tool to enable this workflow please feel free, but in the same way you wouldn't put apache, nginx, passenger, pow, mysql, postgresql, etc in your Gemfile, you shouldn't put mailcatcher in there either.\n. Haha, yeah I'd rock that Gemfile hard.\nmail_view is probably better for a devsignment workflow.\n. Please don't include mailcatcher in your Gemfile, it is a standalone application with it's own dependency set.\nMailcatcher should be installed as a separate gem (gem install mailcatcher) which is simply run as mailcatcher.\n. I don't really want to tie into Rails at all, there are projects like mail_view for that... but I will definitely add something to the README. Thanks!\n. I don't think this is the responsibility of a process. Your process management tools should be able to monitor a started process' ID. I run mailcatcher using launchd on Mac OS X and using upstart on Ubuntu, both of which are capable of tracking (and maintaining, and stopping) a process in this manner.\nIf you don't want mailcatcher to go into the background use --foreground.\nIf you absolutely want to background the process and keep the pid, consider using something like start-stop-daemon to write out a pid file.\n. @pylebecq the initial line you posted should be sufficient, as long as your ruby environment is set up correctly. I suspect it will be an issue with how your ruby is installed and where you mailcatcher gem is installed. Could you open a new issue with full information with your ruby setup, where the gem is installed, and your full upstart config?\n. Quite right, I always forget how nerfed popen and friends were on 1.8.7. I'll update it to use open3 instead and re-release.\n. Fixed in v0.5.7.1.\n. I'm having trouble replicating this issue. This is working fine on my machine:\nsh\n$ irb -r mail_catcher\nirb> MailCatcher::Mail.add_message <your gisted message hash>\n=> nil\nirb> MailCatcher::Mail.messages\n=> [{\"id\"=>1, \"sender\"=>\"...\", \"recipients\"=>[\"...\"], \"subject\"=>\"...\", \"size\"=>\"...\", \"created_at\"=>...}]\nWhat version of ruby and sqlite3 are you using? Perhaps it's something in there. The exception is unforunately not very descriptive, and googling reveals it's fairly generic, but usually it means the database is missing. Considering this is an in-memory database it should never be missing. :-/\nOn my machine:\nsh\n$ ruby -v\nruby 1.9.3p194 (2012-04-20 revision 35410) [x86_64-darwin11.3.0]\nsh\n$ sqlite3 --version\n3.7.10 2012-01-16 13:28:40 ebd01a8deffb5024a5d7494eef800d2366d97204\n. Mailcatcher is not multithreaded, there is a single reactor thread in EventMachine (afaict).\nIf you can provide a script replicating the issue I'll happily reopen and investigate.\n. Hi! Could you please confirm the version of mailcatcher you're running? The latest version is 0.5.7.2:\nconsole\n$ mailcatcher --version\nmailcatcher 0.5.7.2\n. Ugh, again? I'll take a look. :-(\n. Looks like WebKit got stricter about websocket client protocols. Fixed in 0.5.8.\n. This is the sort of thing I expect EventMachine::Protocols::SmtpServer to take care of, but apparently it doesn't. Fixed in 20cf6e98f1362be06db9b3d83e758ca3af5df8a2, but I'm going to sit on the next version for a little while, but will be fixed for 0.5.9.\n. Mailcatcher binds to the local interface because the default use case is a developer running it on their local machine to test against and they only need local access. Binding to all interfaces could be a security issue for the default use case. Anybody with HTTP access to mailcatcher can clear all mail or quit. Mailcatcher also isn't hardened so running a public service by default could also expose potential attack vectors.\nThere is, however, an option to change the bind IP for just such cases as running a staging box:\nmailcatcher --http-ip=0.0.0.0\nThanks. :-)\n. Ah, that's weird. Looks like I accidentally removed it from the gem's manifest. Fixed in 5f05ea0d5d813e25c04f42f57e19e581dbb81df6.\n. Great idea, not sure how comfortable I am with the gmail integration. I'd be more inclined to just act like a first-class SMTP server, however that raises problems via ISPs. Also want the deliveree's address to be changeable in the web interface.\n. They finally released 1.0! Awesome, I've bumped requirements in skinny v0.2.2 and mailcatcher v0.5.9.\n. Ah, yes... more complex resolution would realise that skinny 0.2.2 is available and sates eventmachine ~> 1.0.0, but perhaps I'm assuming rubygems is smarter than it really is. Bundler certainly had no trouble, but it tends to be more considerate.\nI'll add a proper spermy requirement.\n. These dependencies have been tightened in 0.5.10 and shouldn't be a problem. Thanks, and let me know how you go!\n. This should be fixed by the referenced commit. Let me know if it's still breaking!\n. Hey guys, sorry about this, I haven't had a chance to look at it and have been super busy, but I'll take a look tonight. Looks like something subtle inside EventMachine has changed and broken the WebSocket support.\n. Okay, so I finally got to look at this. It's introduced by this commit in eventmachine. I've added a workaround in skinny and the new versions should be out now. gem install mailcatcher -v 0.5.10\n. Hi! Looks like you've found something kinda gnarly. Can you attach the actual message? Or email it to me if it's sensitive. I need the full message with all parts including headers. <3\n. Without the message I can't investigate this issue, closing.\n. I'd like some specs as well, but given some major changes in the wings there doesn't seem to be much point specing at this point.\nWould merge with some acceptance specs for now, they should remain roughly the same.\n. I've taken some tentative steps toward including specs. There are a couple of minispec scenarios which do basic acceptance testing, I'll add more and get it running on Travis soon.\n. The dependencies have been tightened in 0.5.10, please try that. gem install mailcatcher -v 0.5.10\n. Could you elaborate on the problems you've been having?\n. Awesome!\n. I kinda have a rewrite in the wings that I was planning to implement this with... I do like the approach but stay tuned.\n. This is a bug introduced by the latest version of eventmachine, and was fixed in the latest version of mailcatcher. :-)\n. Thanks!\n. This is what catchmail is for.\nTry bundle exec bin/catchmail examples/multipartmail\nOr, for multiple messages try a shell loop. :-)\n. Nice!\n. Slid by me, but will merge now.\n. Would you be able to provide updated instructions? I no longer use rvm.\n. I've updated the guidelines in 327cd355 after installing RVM on a VM and playing a bit.\n. You don't need to run it with bundler. You've also installed it into an RVM gemset, so you must run it inside that gemset.\nTry using rvm-exec:\nsh\n/var/lib/jenkins/.rvm/bin/rvm-exec @mailcatcher mailcatcher\nOr you could create a wrapper per the README instructions:\nconsole\n$ rvm default@mailcatcher --create gem install mailcatcher\n$ rvm wrapper default@mailcatcher --no-prefix mailcatcher catchmail\nand use:\nsh\n/var/lib/jenkins/.rvm/bin/mailcatcher\nIf you're running with process management (i.e. supervisord) you'll either have to make sure it follows the daemonization, or pass --foreground to mailcatcher.\n. It sounds like an ill-formed message, could you please attach the full source of the message? Feel free to anonymise it a bit if you like, or email it to me directly (as an attachment): sj26@sj26.com\nSounds like you might've found a bug in the mail gem. ;-)\n. Hey guys, sorry I've been a bit flat out, I'll take a look tonight and get back to you, but yeah it looks to me like an upstream problem, probably in the mail gem's parsing code.\n. I actually can't replicate this with the example email you supplied.\nWhat version of the mail gem are you both using when able to replicate the issue? That might be a clue.\n. Keep in mind mailcatcher runs as a ruby gem, outside of bundler, so it'll use whatever the latest compatible version of the mail gem you have installed is. Perhaps your devs have differing versions of mail? Try updating mail and see what happens.\n. OH okay. Your email doesn't have a Message-ID or part Content-IDs which are required in RFC 2822. Normally the mail gem just generates one for any parts without one, but for some reason it seems to be skipping in your case. How are you constructing this email? Whatever is generating it should be providing a content id.\nI think this breaks because mailcatcher use content ids (or CIDs) to load the different parts inside a multipart html and text email. I still can't replicate the failure on my machine. I initially had trouble replicating this because I used the mailcatcher's catchmail script which wraps the outgoing email in the mail gem before sending it off which adds content-ids and such required things before it hits mailcatcher:\n``` email\nDate: Mon, 07 Jan 2013 21:45:08 -0500\nFrom: General Assembly course-from@example.com\nTo: auz1@example.com\nMessage-ID: 50ebb207e14b6_453b3fe1c045c66c366e9@Bumblebee.local.mail\nSubject: Confirmation for Front End Web Development\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: multipart/alternative;\n boundary=\"--==_mimepart_50eb88343c171_57413ffbe1c35ad890373\";\n charset=UTF-8\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\n----==_mimepart_50eb88343c171_57413ffbe1c35ad890373\nDate: Mon, 07 Jan 2013 21:45:08 -0500\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain;\n charset=UTF-8\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nContent-ID: 50ebb207e050e_453b3fe1c045c66c36475@Bumblebee.local.mail\nDear Auz Foo,\n...\n```\n(see Content-ID: <50ebb207e050e_453b3fe1c045c66c36475@Bumblebee.local.mail>)\nI've been explicitly writing out an SMTP session with the literal email you've posted, but still no failure.\nTry adding Content-ID to your source email and see if that fixes the error on your end. If it does, try to track down inside the mail gem why it's not populating content_id on the Part, which part it actually is in the message, etc. Even better, make a failing test case against the mail gem!\n. @thicksoup that's a different issue which I've never seen before. Could you please send me the MailCatcher log output and the full message source you are trying to send?\n. @thicksoup be careful, too, because \"Cannot receive from specified address <...>: Unauthenticated senders not allowed\" is not a message that I can see anywhere in eventmachine's SMTP handling, so you may not even be sending through mailcatcher.\n. @mmrobins without a repeatable trigger we can't really diagnose this. If you come up with a way to repeatedly trigger the error please let me know, but for now I'll close the issue.\n. @amree can you post an example which triggers the error please? Preferably the full source of an email body sent to mailcatcher, and any logs you get from mailcatcher in response.\n. @amree your config/environments/development.rb does not appear to have the mail catcher config as you describe. If you added it then tried sending mail then you may have forgotten to restart rails. That you are seeing the message text in the rails logs means something in your application is misconfigured.\n. @ekurennyy check the various logs involved\u2014both client and server side.\n. @dounan that sounds like a mail gem bug! It should be aware of the content encoding of the message and use compatible content-id. Maybe you could add an issue?. This is a rails configuration issues really, not a mailcatcher issue, but I'll try to help!\nMake sure you've got all of these in config/environments/test.rb:\nruby\nconfig.action_mailer.perform_delivery = true\nconfig.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp\nconfig.action_mailer.smtp_settings = { :address => \"localhost\", :port => 1025 }\nAdditionally, check inside your scenarios that mail is actually being sent. If it's not going to mailcatcher it should be going somewhere else, or being logged, or throwing an exception, etc.\n. Then something in your cucumber environment is overriding your mail settings.\nIs your cucumber definitely setup to use the \"test\" environment, or is it using the \"cucumber\" environment?\n. No, that's the port capybara uses to serve your web application to the browser.\nHonestly it's an environment issue which I can't debug for you without access to your codebase, and is not due to mailcatcher. If you'd like to contact me to have a look at your codebase I'd be happy to, but I'll close this issue.\n. That will not work\u2014websockets will break.\n. You can now proxy websockets with nginx. Here's a complete example configuration file:\nhttps://gist.github.com/sj26/9885403\n. This was fixed in an updated version of mailcatcher. Update and you should be fine.\n. @stefanahman that's a very old version of mailcatcher, please upgrade\n. Just run on different ports and you should be safe.\nOn 16/01/2013, at 7:01 PM, attiks notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI had a quick look at the code, but I'm not really a Ruby man so I might be wrong, but it looks like it isn't possible to run multiple instances (unless I duplicate the directory).

Great point.\n. I'm unable to replicate this on ruby 1.9.3-p374 with foreman 0.61.0 and mailcatcher 0.5.10.\n\nWhat versions of ruby, foreman and mailcatcher are you using? Have you tried editing the mailcatcher gem to add $stdout.sync = $stderr.sync = true to confirm this is a solution to your problem?\n. Closed by #121.\n. I have no idea whether haml 12 will be supported, or activesupport 5, or mail 7.\nWere I to update mailcatcher to support the newer gems you'd like here, backwards compatibility might be broken, and we'd get issues from others in the same vein complaining that it was working fine with their versions of haml, activesupport, etc. but now they can't get newer versions.\nAs always, mailcatcher is an independent gem with its own requirements and you should be doing gem install mailcatcher and mailcatcher on the command line, or using tools like brew-gem. If you're using it in a project with a team, great, but I'd recommend putting it in the README, not the Gemfile.\n. Sorry, would you mind clarifying this issue?\n. I'm sorry but that's far outside the scope of mailcatcher.\n. Please don't include mailcatcher in your Gemfile, it is a standalone application with it's own dependency set. Mailcatcher should be installed as a separate gem (gem install mailcatcher) which is simply run as mailcatcher.\nTo document a dependency I suggest adding it to your README. :-)\n. I've relaxed the HAML requirement in 6605fc26. The put-it-in-the-Gemfile approach is widespread, so I'll adapt things as requested. Sorry for the trouble.\n. You shouldn't be loading mailcatcher with rails. Please don't put it in your Gemfile.\nI probably will upgrade the dependencies at some point when activesupport 4 is released with rails, though not to a prerelease.\n. I've isolated the dependency update in 6605fc26.\n. Nice catch, sorry it took a while for me to notice.\n. Well it needs to run inside EventMachine, and it needs websocket support. What in thin stops it running under jruby?\n. Closing this. We probably won't support jruby explicitly if thin doesn't work. The magic of mailcatcher is that it's a single process doing everything which requires eventmachine, and the easiest way to do web in eventmachine is thin.\n. http://mailcatcher.me/#bundler\n. Foreman is another utility that doesn't really belong in your Gemfile, or at least shouldn't be launched with a bundler binstub. Any ruby subprocess is susceptible to this problem, including things like hub and gh. Vagrant have had such issues with this that they no longer distribute as a rubygem but as a system installable package.\nYou have two options:\n1. Ask bundler to clean the environment before running mailcatcher:\nweb: thin ...  \n   mailcatcher: ruby -rbundler/setup -e \"Bundler.clean_exec('mailcatcher', '--foreground')\"\n(Example in gist: https://gist.github.com/sj26/8f638252ab64b1d0ecbb)\n2. gem install foreman and just foreman instead of bundle exec foreman and bundle exec ... or use bundle binstubs (bin/...) in your Procfile entries.\n. The point is: MailCatcher is a separate application or system utility, like Postgres or MySQL, not a library like haml or rails.\n. Thanks @rocknruby, I've corrected the typo of Bundler. I think the argument was being missed because I had wrapped them in an array, clean_exec seems to function like Kernel#spawn and wants a splat of args instead, also corrected.\nPassing arguments as an list is usually safer and cuts out parsing and subshells. ;-)\n. Do you get HTML when you curl http://localhost:1080\u00a0on the vagrant vm?\nIf it's a port forwarding issue I have no idea, sorry\u2014I don't use vagrant. Are you absolutely sure your port forwarding is correct, and in the correct direction?\nOn Wed, May 1, 2013 at 9:09 AM, Amin Meyghani notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nI have installed the Mailcatcher gem (http://mailcatcher.me/) on my VM managed by Vagrant. And in the Vagrantfile I have set up the forwarding port:\n    config.vm.forward_port 1080, 1080\nI ssh to the guest, run the Mailcatcher on the guest, but when I go to: 127.0.0.1:1080 on my host, I don't see the Mailcather interface. All I get is:\n    No data received.Unable to load the webpage because the server sent no data ...\nAny ideas?\nThanks in advance!\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/sj26/mailcatcher/issues/89\n. You could try running mailcatcher using:\n\nsh\n$ mailcatcher --ip=0.0.0.0\nThis means you can access mailcatcher on your VM host using your VM's ip and port 1080, no vagrant forwarding required.\n. @joeyfrich there is definitely an ip option so you may be using an old version. Try gem install mailcatcher to upgrade.\n. Thanks for the very thorough issue report! I have added a patch to remove mailcatcher's sensitivity to leading periods. I'd swear that EventMachine didn't do this for us at some point, but I couldn't be bothered tracing back into their subversion history.\nThanks again, this will be in the next release.\n. Mailcatcher runs on localhost by default. Try using mailcatcher --ip=0.0.0.0\n. Looks great, thanks!\n. mailcacther will log, so if you want to watch it run with --foreground.\ncatchmail is actually what is generating your error, much like sendmail or your LTA would do when running PHP on the server. RFC 2822 section 3.6.2 requires a From header.\n. Note that the PHP documentation also says:\n\nNote:\nWhen sending mail, the mail must contain a From header. This can be set with the additional_headers parameter, or a default can be set in php.ini.\nFailing to do this will result in an error message similar to Warning: mail(): \"sendmail_from\" not set in php.ini or custom \"From:\" header missing. The From header sets also Return-Path under Windows.\n. Yeah, sendmail on *nix will use the current user and host to generate a From for you, although this is far from correct.\n\nActually, more correct would be adding the -f option to catchmail. I've updated the documentation in that direction.\n. Are you including it in your Gemfile? You shouldn't be.\n. Great idea!\nI think it might be better to simply decorate the plain text view with links, perhaps in javascript land. There's no real detriment. If people want a plaintext copy they can just \"Paste as Plaintext\" or whatever.\n. Great, thanks!\n. No worries, thanks. :smile:\n. Please edit the coffeescript source, not the raw javascript.\n. Sorry, but I don't see any difference in iPad functionality with these changes. Existing MailCatcher seems to work fine.\n. This should have been fixed by 44262f9.\n. I can't replicate this\u2014if you're still having this issue please re-open the issue with some example emails causing the problem.\n. I can't replicate this, the API seems to function as expected for me:\nsh\n$ bundle exec mailcatcher\n$ curl http://localhost:1080/messages\n[]\n$ bundle exec catchmail examples/multipartmail\n$ curl http://localhost:1080/messages\n[{\"id\":1,\"sender\":\"<me@sj26.com>\",\"recipients\":[\"<blah@blah.com>\"],\"subject\":\"Test Multipart Mail\",\"size\":\"631\",\"created_at\":\"2014-03-31T04:44:07+00:00\"}]\n$ bundle exec catchmail examples/multipartmail\n$ curl http://localhost:1080/messages\n[{\"id\":1,\"sender\":\"<me@sj26.com>\",\"recipients\":[\"<blah@blah.com>\"],\"subject\":\"Test Multipart Mail\",\"size\":\"631\",\"created_at\":\"2014-03-31T04:44:07+00:00\"},{\"id\":2,\"sender\":\"<me@sj26.com>\",\"recipients\":[\"<blah@blah.com>\"],\"subject\":\"Test Multipart Mail\",\"size\":\"631\",\"created_at\":\"2014-03-31T04:44:10+00:00\"}]\n$ curl -XDELETE http://localhost:1080/messages/1\n$ curl http://localhost:1080/messages\n[{\"id\":2,\"sender\":\"<me@sj26.com>\",\"recipients\":[\"<blah@blah.com>\"],\"subject\":\"Test Multipart Mail\",\"size\":\"631\",\"created_at\":\"2014-03-31T04:44:10+00:00\"}]\n$ curl -XDELETE http://localhost:1080/messages/2\n$ curl http://localhost:1080/messages\n[]\n$ curl -XDELETE http://localhost:1080/messages/1\n<html>\n  <body>\n    <h1>No Dice</h1>\n    <p>The message you were looking for does not exist, or doesn't have content of this type.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\nLet me know if you're still having this issue and, if so, see if you can provide a breaking example.\n. Closing; fixed by #110.\n. This breaks the failure scenario.\n. Disagree\u2014I want to be able to exactly replicate a problem with exactly the same gems as another developer, or be able to ask people to install from git to exactly replicate potential issues.\n. They're not going to be up to date now either, I'll do a recompile in a sec.\n. Nice addition.\n. The idea was to make it transparent, so no options should be involved really. My delay on this feature was just researching a nice way to find a platform-dependent location for the database.\n. I would prefer a --database=URL argument, using something like sequel, falling back to ENV.fetch(\"DATABASE_URL\", \"sqlite://:memory:\"), and with graceful migrations. This would work but would create a new migration path for which I'm not keen.\n. @fdrouet you can already run multiple instances of mailcatcher using different ports, the content just won't survive restarts. :-)\n. @fdrouet you might like to try https://github.com/mailhog/mailhog. It's written in go, has less dependencies and much less memory usage.\n. Thanks!\n. On ubuntu you will need to sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev first.\n. Have you checked that websockets still work, and that Thin boots correctly within the EventMachine loop? MailCatcher has a tight dependency on Skinny which heavily integrates with Thin.\nAlso, http://mailcatcher.me/#bundler\n. No, and I don't really think it should, although I'd like to know your use case.\n. Ah, that sounds like a simple purpose-built SMTP server might serve you better.\n. Haven't heard from you for a while, going to close this one for now.\n. Thanks!\n. Sorry, I can't replicate this. Could you perhaps attach a test email causing the problem?\n. @sancromeu nice investigation, albeit with frustrating results.\nThe whole point of prepared statements is to prepare them once then reuse them with varied bound data. This looks like an upstream bug that I can't really address except to remove an optimisation which should work for everybody.\nI'm afraid the resolution here is probably to fix the upstream sqlite package in centos, or recompile it, and these things are outside my control so closing this issue.\n. What browser and version are you using? Is there anything in the debug console?\n. Rubygems takes care of loading a graph of dependencies making sure all versions are compatible. Try running the below:\nsh\n$ ruby -r mail_catcher -e \"p(Gem.loaded_specs)\"\n{\"eventmachine\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff6aa44191c eventmachine-1.0.3>, \"haml\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff6a9c902b8 haml-4.0.5>, \"treetop\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff6aa058170 treetop-1.4.15>, \"mail\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff6aa407370 mail-2.5.4>, \"sqlite3\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff6a9c1629c sqlite3-1.3.8>, \"daemons\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff6aa44ddc0 daemons-1.1.9>, \"thin\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff6aa419778 thin-1.5.1>, \"skinny\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff6a9c1abf8 skinny-0.2.3>, \"mailcatcher\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff6aa035030 mailcatcher-0.5.12>, \"activesupport\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff6aa46865c activesupport-3.2.16>, \"i18n\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff6a9c22e84 i18n-0.6.9>, \"rack\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff6aa449c48 rack-1.5.2>, \"multi_json\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff6a9c37168 multi_json-1.8.4>, \"mime-types\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff6aa019448 mime-types-1.25.1>, \"tilt\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff6a9c3f0c0 tilt-1.4.1>, \"sinatra\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff6aa03088c sinatra-1.4.4>, \"rack-protection\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff6aa421ba8 rack-protection-1.5.2>}\nI have tilt version 2.0.0 installed, yet it has correctly selected 1.4.1.\nIf you find rubygems is not doing the same for you then I suspect you have a broken ruby/rubygems install. Linux distributions sometimes do silly things with gems. If you find a fix please let me know, but for now this is not a bug in mailcatcher.\n. I still can't reproduce this issue exactly, but it can't hurt. Thanks! :-)\n. MailCatcher lists the SMTP receiver and senders in the list, but displays the mail body's \"To\", \"Cc\" and \"From\" headers when actually viewing an individual message. \"Bcc\" headers are stripped by your mail client/library so cannot appear in MailCatcher, but we still list all the people a message is actually being sent to. Do you have any suggested improvements?\n. This requires mixing the smtp and mail concerns and perhaps inferring too much. We cannot be sure that such recipients were indicated in a bcc field. We can assume, but such an assumption may be incorrect.\nI'm inclined to leave it as is, I'm afraid.\n. We should actually just append \"\\r\\n\" to every line as stipulated by the SMTP protocol. I'll take a look.\n. Great! That's why the -f flag is suggested for sendmail/catchmail. ^_^\n. Love the idea, but perhaps favcount might suit better so that even when tabs get tiny the count can still be read? I've merged your change, fixed a few edge cases, and added favcount on master\u2014see what you think.\n. I love it. This has spurred me to actually complete some changes I had pending to the codebase, then I'll add a \"Transcript\" tab.\nAnother thought\u2014what about a failed SMTP session? Should I perhaps be exposing failures as \"messages\"? And what about SMTP sessions which submit multiple messages? Requires further mulling.\n. This is more work than it sounds like, and I'd like to deduplicate the data a little which requires a rethink of the database a little. First, I'd like to update the database itself to use ActiveRecord or something. Will put this on the back burner for now.\n. Thin is locked down because skinny hooks deeply into thin and allowing less strict requirements could have unknown effects.\nThe activesupport requirement is less strict and deeply coupled, and has been tested through the 3 series and into 4.0.\nIf you'd like to take the time to thoroughly test mailcatcher and, more importantly, skinny with later versions of thin I'd love to see the results and consider loosening the requirement.\n. Make sure you're just running mailcatcher and not bundle exec mailcatcher, and that you don't have a bundler binstub.\n. Well somehow ruby is loading bundler before running mailcatcher. It might be because of a stray bin stub or a weird environment variable or something.\nCan you check and post the output (sanitised if you like) of:\n1. which mailcatcher\n2. env\n3. Run it from a different directory, perhaps your home directory\n4. Run it in a different terminal\n. Well (1) is your problem. What's bundled_mailcatcher? Looks like something funky in your terminal setup, I've never seen such a thing. You need to follow that rabbit hole. What's which bundled_mailcatcher give you, etc?\n. Haven't heard for a couple of days, hope you've tracked down your problem, but as this isn't a MailCatcher issue per se I'll close this issue.\n. The readme already contains:\n\nCommand line options to override the default SMTP/HTTP IP and port settings.\n\nWhich should lead someone to run mailcatcher --help which reveals:\nUsage: mailcatcher [options]\n        --ip IP                      Set the ip address of both servers\n        --smtp-ip IP                 Set the ip address of the smtp server\n        --smtp-port PORT             Set the port of the smtp server\n        --http-ip IP                 Set the ip address of the http server\n        --http-port PORT             Set the port address of the http server\n        --no-quit                    Don't allow quitting the process\n        --[no-]growl                 Growl to the local machine when a message arrives\n    -f, --foreground                 Run in the foreground\n    -b, --browse                     Open web browser\n    -v, --verbose                    Be more verbose\n    -h, --help                       Display this help information\nDo you think there should be more?\n. sed -ir \"s@;\\?sendmail_path =.*@sendmail_path = \\\"/usr/bin/env $(which mailcatcher) -f local\\@host\\\"@\" /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini\nshould be\nsed -ir \"s@;\\?sendmail_path =.*@sendmail_path = \\\"/usr/bin/env $(which catchmail) -f local\\@host\\\"@\" /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini\n. No worries, hope it's working for you. :-)\n. The table actually lists the SMTP sender and recipients as per the SMTP exchange, the RFC2822 Return-Path header in the actual email is just a way to tell the SMTP client which SMTP sender to use. You can also use the -f option to sendmail, for example.\nI'm not inclined to change it because the list is meant to reflect exactly where an email claims to come from and where it has been sent in the delivery process. The RFC2822 From, To and Cc headers as they would be displayed in an email client are listed in the message body below the table.\n. Do you have the xcode command line tools installed? Mailcatcher uses a gem which requires a compiler.\n. Please re-open the issue if you're still having issues.\n. Sorry guys, I don't have a windows machine to test this on. If you make any progress it would be great to hear your thoughts. Perhaps eventmachine needs an upgrade?\n. Have you tried this with eventmachine 1.0.4? Anyways, I'm going to close this issue, please reopen it if, with the latest gem versions, you still have the same issue.\n. Have you got any logs from PHP or your web server indicating why it is failing?\n. You'll probably need a wrapper like:\nhttp://mailcatcher.me/#rvm\n. Hi kalmanh,\nThanks for getting involed, but I've left the 1.8-style hashes on purpose\u2014mailcatcher still works on ruby 1.8.7 and I don't think changing hash syntaxes is enough of an incentive to break that compatibility yet.\nThanks though!\n. @der-flo that's not related to this pull request. master mailcatcher now has an asset server for development and precompiles the assets for gem publishing. Put MAILCATCHER_ENV=development in your ENV to hook it up.\n. (There's some major work waiting for me to get around to releasing 0.6.0)\n. Holy shit, hi @dirkkelly.\nThanks.\n. Agreed, this is going on the list.\n. This is not for HTTP, but for SMTP over TLS and STARTTLS, for testing your mail settings and libraries.\nI agree that reverse proxying from nginx is better for HTTPS, and I wouldn't recommend exposing mailcatcher itself outside a development environment without something else acting as a proxy with authentication. :-). There's some severe asset reworking in the latest master which might not work out of the box. You'll need to pull it locally and run rake assets or export MAILCATCHER_ENV=development. There will be a release when I can finish the changes.\n. The latest master has a big rework of the asset infrastructure. If you want the assets in a development checkout you'll need to either set an environment variable MAILCATCHER_ENV=true or run rake assets.\n. Not sure what this is about, but please reopen with issues if you need assistance.\n. You'll need those environment variables set in your PHP process which runs sendmail, or you can edit the catchmail shebang to include a --encoding=utf8.\nPlease reopen the issue if you have further problems.\n. Unfortunately because the versions of ruby vary so greatly in their treatment of encodings and it's rubygems creating the shim, not mailcatcher, there's little we can do from the gem.\n. Actually, I tell a lie. We could set the external encoding inside the script. I'll add a TODO.\n. Do you have any log output? It's probably having trouble locating the proper ruby or gem. Re-open with some output and I'll be happy to help you diagnose.\n. @enrichit if you can post the command you're using and the output you're seeing maybe I can help?\n. Sorry not sure what's going on here. Try upgrading all your gems? SQLite had some strangeness a while back. Please re-open if you're still seeing this issue.\n. Technically, characters outisde the ascii 1-127 range are not permitted unencoded in email messages. This will be causing an error when parsing your message and attempting to send. You will see errors in mail servers if you attempt to send them in the wild. Instead, make sure you're using a mail library which can encode these characters correctly using mime or quoted printable encodings.\n. Closing this, make sure you use rbenv rehash or whatever your environment configuration requires to find new gem binstubs. :-)\n. This is a complicated beast. I agree it would be nice to preview what emails might look like in different clients in mailcatcher, but which client? and how? what about compatibility problems between what mailcatcher thinks a client does and what it actually does?\nThere are many services that will do this for you, like MailChimp's inbox inspector, Campaign Monitor's inbox preview, Fractal, etc.\nIntegration with these services would be nice, but requires a lot of configuration which I'm not sure needs to be in mailcatcher. If you can think of a good way to do this please let me know!\n. SMTP doesn't natively support UTF-8 over the wire. This message, if transmitted raw, doesn't actually conform to the protocol. Some servers support an SMTP UTF-8 extension, but this must be negotiated with EHLO and mailcatcher doesn't support it.\nInstead, your mail client should be encoding your message body with  base64 or similar instead of transferring in straight 8-bit. I suspect the body is actually being munged on read then causing transcoding errors on jsonification. For me, this throws an exception at read time. (Encodings in ruby are awful at the best of times.)\nIf I send your raw email body with catchmail then the mail gem picks up the content and correctly encodes it as base64 and it comes out as expected:\n{\n  \"id\":3,\n  \"sender\":\"\\u003ctesting@localhost.local\\u003e\",\n  \"recipients\":[\"\\u003creceiver@localhost.local\\u003e\"],\n  \"subject\":\"R\u00e4ksm\u00f6rg\u00e5s!\",\n  \"source\":\"Date: Mon, 18 Aug 2014 17:51:26 +0200\\r\\nFrom: Testing \\u003ctesting@localhost.local\\u003e\\r\\nTo: receiver@localhost.local\\r\\nMessage-ID: \\u003c53f220fe58644dfb827100d80a00020f@localhost.local\\u003e\\r\\nSubject: =?UTF-8?Q?R=C3=A4ksm=C3=B6rg=C3=A5s!?=\\r\\nMime-Version: 1.0\\r\\nContent-Type: text/plain;\\r\\n charset=UTF-8\\r\\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: base64\\r\\n\\r\\nSMOkbGzDtiB0w6RzdGluZyByw6Rrc23DtnJnw6VzIQo=\\r\\n\",\n  \"size\":\"368\",\n  \"type\":\"text/plain\",\n  \"created_at\":\"2015-01-17T05:44:07.000+00:00\",\n  \"formats\":[\"source\",\"plain\"],\n  \"attachments\":[]\n}\n. Hey there, I didn't get a notice about this issue which is odd, sorry.\nThis is an odd issue. Looks like rubygems isn't doing its job properly:\nirb(main):002:0> Gem.loaded_specs\n=> {}\nirb(main):003:0> gem \"mailcatcher\"\n=> true\nirb(main):004:0> Gem.loaded_specs\n=> {\"eventmachine\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff8e6fcd464 eventmachine-1.0.3>, \"haml\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff8e6a1d0c8 haml-4.0.5>, \"sqlite3\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff8e6e9d2ec sqlite3-1.3.9>, \"daemons\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff8e6b95914 daemons-1.1.9>, \"thin\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff8e6e7dce4 thin-1.5.1>, \"skinny\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff8e6cccf6c skinny-0.2.3>, \"mailcatcher\"=>#<Gem::Specification:0x3ff8e69343f0 mailcatcher-0.5.12>}\n(notice activesupport and i18n are missing.)\nYou could work around by using rvm to install mailcatcher into a dedicated gemset and make the wrapper use that, so any conflicting versions installed by other things don't conflict.\n. @CamJN that won't fix the gem. To have the same effect in development mode, start mailcatcher with bundle exec mailcatcher.\n. Yep. Please remove any prerelease versions of i18n if you encounter this issue.\n. @jondoe1337 that looks like you've got activesurpport 4.2.7.rc1 installed which is causing havoc. Can you try:\ngem uninstall activesupport -v 4.2.7.rc1\n. You can run the git version with MAILCATCHER_ENV=development in your ENV. But I want a better solution to this to be sure.\n. Please use bundle exec rake or bundle exec mailcatcher, you don't need to unshift the library directory.\nActivesupport is another issue, will pull that commit.\n. Neat!\nEXPOSE 25 80 won't work because not being bound as root.\n. Thanks, but I deliberately didn't include sinatra-contrib for various reasons though. This has been fixed with some content_type stanzas.\n. Please remove any prerelease versions of i18n to make this work. Mailcatcher works with the released version of i18n 0.7.0+\n. This is pretty old now so I'll close it. Please re-open if you still have this issue. You might like to try running lsof -i -n to see what processes are running on what ports to see if there's a collision.\n. Ah, right. You can always lsof or ps to find the mailcatcher process then kill it.\n. Closing this issue due to age. Please re-open if you're still experiencing this.\n. Run mailcatcher from foreman with mailcatcher --foreground. The daemonised mode is a convenience. I don't want to build service management semantics in -- that's your operating system's job. :-)\n. Ruby 2 is fine, but 2.1.x and eventmachine 1.0.4 specifically seems to have problems per #182. Please track them there.\n. This is very strange as I can't replicate this issue. Does it happen all the time, for every message?\n. I still can't reproduce this.\nPlease try upgading to 0.6.0 with gem install mailcatcher. If you're still having issues please feel free to reopen this issue.\n. This is due to #182. Mailcatcher doesn't seem to quit correctly when asked under Ruby 2.1.5.\nPlease try running mailcatcher in the foreground for now. You can ps aux | grep mailcatcher and kill -9 the process if you run into this issue again in the meantime.\n. This seems to be related to #182, please track there.\n. 0.7.0 non-prerelease works fine. And restricting the gem requirements would just mean that this gem wouldn't update based on other dependency restrictions.\n. Yeah mailcatcher shouldn't be in your Gemfile, but I agree that a release is long overdue. First need to fix the eventmachine/2.1.5 issues.\n. Ah, I just pushed a change to build on latest of each minor version.\n. Ah, this must be something that has changed recently. I'll update the README.\n. Actually it looks like php_value should work: http://php.net/manual/en/configuration.changes.php\nPerhaps there's something overriding your configuration? Anyways, this seems like an administrative configuration issue, not an issue with the general guidelines.\n. No I didn't try it, but without the details you've just provided above there didn't seem a need to change something I had previously tried which had worked. Sorry my skim of the PHP docs didn't pick up these changes at first glance. With these details, though, I'm happy to make the change. Thanks!\n. It's a new feature not yet in a released version. :-)\n. Can you provide a full source message which produces this problem?\n. If you can supply a message which reproduces this problem please feel free to reopen the issue. :-)\n. From what I can see of the source you've posted this should work.\nCan you provide a full email source (like one from MailCatcher's Download button) which produces this problem?\n. I believe this is similar to many other issues about encoding. Your mail library is not correctly encoding these characters as quoted printable or similar. You should fix or update your mail library to get this working. Otherwise they may not appear correctly for your intended recipients, either!. Seems to be a bug in the latest version of EventMachine, sadly. -.-\nThe reason it doesn't daemonise until after the eventmachine loop is running is so that port failures can be reported to the user.\nI'll see what's going on upstream in eventmachine. But honestly eventmachine has become a major pain. May see if there's a feasible alternative, maybe even going back to the standard library with a custom select loop.\n. This does seem to be an eventmachine regression.\nPlease try mailcatcher 0.6.0pre1 (gem install mailcatcher --pre) which restricts eventmachine to != 1.0.4. This is only a temporary release until I can fix the eventmachine problem to fix ruby 2.2 compatiblity, or replace eventmachine with something else.\n. @matthewbarram please try mailcatcher 0.6.0pre1 (gem install mailcatcher --pre).\n. This has been worked around in 0.6.0, please upgrade with gem install mailcatcher.\nThe root cause of this has also been lodged as an issue upstream:\nhttps://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine/issues/569\n. Ah, I see:\neventmachine (1.0.5)\nThey must have released a new version which has broken my fix. I'll look into it again.\n. mailcatcher 0.6.1 is out which works with eventmachine up to 1.0.5, and restricts future upgrades.\n. Localhost should always work, I suspect you have an environment problem. Sorry but I'd like to leave it as localhost.\n. The To field in the list of messages and the message header is the list of addresses that SMTP delivered to, not the contents of the To header in the actual email.\nCheck the Source version of your email for the To header.\n. Ruby 2.2 won't work yet because eventmachine 1.0.4 has bugs preventing mailcatcher working, and 1.0.3 doesn't support ruby 2.2. Will keep you posted.\n. (Make sure you're installing mailcatcher as a gem, not with bundler, and run mailcatcher with ruby < 2.2.)\n. Please upgrade to version 0.6.0 with gem install mailcatcher\n. Good point. Fixed on master.\n. What version of ruby are you using? ruby --version\nWhat OS/platform are you on?\nDo you have the json gem? gem list\n. No worries, sorry it didn't work for you.\n. Please try mailcatcher 0.6.0pre1 (gem install mailcatcher --pre)\n. mailcatcher 0.6.1 is out which works with eventmachine up to 1.0.5, and restricts future upgrades.\n. Are you using the mailcatcher web interface in an automated browser, or treating it as an API?\nIf the web interface, try reloading the page before making your assertions. Maybe the websockets aren't working as expected. If so, let me know when browser you're using.\nIf you're using it via an API then the email should be available as soon as your app has finished delivering it. I'd suggest watching the mailcatcher logs (the standard output, you might like to run it with --foreground) during delivery. There will be a message for every mail received the moment it is fully delivered. If you don't see a message when you expect then your app isn't completing the mail delivery when you expect.\nHope this helps.\n. Please try upgrading to version 0.6.0 with gem install mailcatcher\nIf you're still having issues feel free to reopen the issue.\n. Have you tried refreshing the page?\n. What do the rails logs show? Have you tried running mailcatcher --foreground and watching those logs?\n. Please try upgrading to version 0.6.0 with gem install mailcatcher\nIf you're still having issues please feel free to reopen the issue.\n. mailcatcher 0.6.1 is out which works with eventmachine up to 1.0.5, and restricts future upgrades.\n. @john-999 mailcatcher 0.6.1 should only load eventmachine < 1.0.5. Try running with --foreground and watch the logs.\n. Thanks! 1.0.4 is problematic, but if they fix the bugs we should still be compatible with ~> 1.0.0, so I've added != 1.0.4 to the deps in 7533eb.\n. This isn't really relevant to mailcatcher, but is covered by the Action Mailer rails guide.\nFor instance, my host will be different to yours (I use pow), so a copy/paste will actually confuse things.\n. I don't really want to change the instructions everywhere, but I've added a known issue in the readme:\n\nRuby 2.2 / SMTP not working\nMailCatcher does not currently support Ruby 2.2. EventMachine added support in 1.0.4, but regressed other things so is unuseable, even on earlier rubies.\nPlease use Ruby < 2.2 and EventMachine < 1.0.4. You can gem install mailcatcher --pre for a version which restricts to eventmachine < 1.0.4.\n. Don't include mailcatcher in your gemfile. Please see the readme.\n. Not quite, but close. I have a little script which scrapes the readme, renders it, and rewrites it a bit. Need to set it up with a git webhook at some point. Or use github pages.\n\nIn any case, done.\n. Hi Andy,\nThe \"to\" and \"from\" in Mailcatcher shows how your email is actually being sent; who is being sent a copy of your email via SMTP and where your app is claiming the email is from via SMTP. The headers are actually different.\nThis seems to cause a lot of confusion so I'm going to introduce an SMTP log tab soon showing the SMTP session log, and change these fields to \"recipients\" and \"/sender\"\n. MailCatcher needs to listen on SMTP too, rack is not enough. This cannot be done.\n. (If you would like something more rails integrated maybe try https://github.com/basecamp/mail_view)\n. (There is probably also room for another tool which integrates more deeply with rails and hijack's ActionMailer's delivery method in development and serves them via rack without using smtp at all. MailCatcher was designed as a more general solution to the problem, though.) \n. Can you provide an example message triggering this problem?\nSMTP only allows ASCII over the wire so mail messages as source should still be ASCII. Perhaps it is a strange title encoding or similar?\n. I'll happily accept a patch with test cases. The problem here is incompatibility arising from particular gem versions which is difficult to solve.\n. Please try v0.6.5 and create a new issue with a fresh backtrace and breaking source message if you continue having issues.\n. Mail messages generally have time inside them, or folks pipe output into logging tools which can time-tag lines if they like. Is there a compelling use-case to do so?\n. This will be done as part of #298.\n. Yeah this is a long standing issue. Individual deletes aren't replicated across instances either. Time to react/relay the whole thing? :P\n. By design. MailCatcher is an SMTP tool, so show the SMTP details in the table list. The \"From\" in the message display is the RFC822 From header.\n. From and Sender as you describe are both RFC822 headers, part of the message in the lower pane in MailCatcher. SMTP's FROM is provided in the SMTP exchange, per https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc821#section-3.1. The upper table in MailCatcher is SMTP details, and is how/where the message would be delivered. The message details (the lower pane), like the From header, is how a message will be displayed in a mail client. If you want to see if there is a different From and Sender then I suggest looking at the message source which will show all headers.\n. This is a problem with the addon, not with mailcatcher.\n. I'd be happy to accept a patch improving JavaScript message retrieval.\n. Ah right. This should be fixed by #242, then.\n. This only works on systems with sysv init scripts. systemd, upstart and launchd users will need different configurations, among other possibilities. Adding instructions for how to start on every possible configuration would make the readme very long. Instead I'd rather leave people to google \"how to run service at system start up\" or similar and gain some knowledge about their particular systems.\n. It's been designed for development use, but you could probably use it in production if you really wished. Just be in mind that it uses an in-memory store.\n. Started: https://github.com/sj26/mailcatcher/releases\n. Unfortunately Ruby has a habit of leaking memory. In-memory SQLite and EventMachine probably just complicates the whole situation.\nGiven mailcatcher is intended to be a development tool, and not necessarily running all the time this is enough for me. If you'd like to attack it with perftools then patches are welcome!\n. If you'd like something with a better resource profile, there's also MailHog.\n. I'm not seeing a huge impact locally. If you folks would like to provide some profiling information to identify the source I'll happily address it.\n. Here are some memory profiling tools:\nhttps://github.com/SamSaffron/memory_profiler\nhttps://github.com/ruby-prof/ruby-prof\nIf you can run mailcatcher in the foreground using these tools and replicate the memory issues with profiling data then maybe we can figured out what's causing it and fix it. I don't see a lot of unexpected memory use when I use it, but will try and replicate as well.\n. @alexbowers sorry, as I've mentioned above I can't replicate this and nobody is contributing useful data with the suggested tools. Mailtrap seems reasonable for a hosted option. MailHog is another good alternative written in Go and locally hosted like mailcatcher.\n. Yes, it's probably an eventmachine leak.\n. Thanks for the patch!\nThe catchmail binary is actually unrelated to this change, but you're right about the erb template. Committed in d7a4737.\n. https://github.com/sj26/mailcatcher#bundler\n. Fixed in 134a99c9c1a2f75cbe1c94f75cbb58959a0176dc.\n. The icon count is working in Safari, Firefox and IE for me. The title doesn't have a count. Does it need one? In any case, this isn't a bug.\n. Sure, why not.\n. Sorry this should have been merged a while ago. We were overriding the header. -.-'\n. No, thank you. I consider this a non-feature of mailcatcher. Process supervision belongs to your operating system. See #46.\nTo daemonise as a system service which can be sent signals please use something like upstart, systemd, or launchctl, or start-stop-daemon in combination with mailcatcher --foreground.\n. This is a problem with the system configuration, not something mailcatcher can fix. If you have this issue, make sure you're using an absolute path to catchmail and that it uses an absolute path to ruby. The RVM wrapper instructions should help.\n. Closed in favour of #227.\n. Thin 1.6 breaks mailcatcher exiting cleanly. This will need some more work.\n. Yeah I'm closing this in favour of removing Thin completely as part of #298\n. Nice idea.\n. I just added an --http-path option so you can add --http-path=/mailcatcher to mount mailcatcher with a path prefix of /mailcatcher for example. This has been released as 0.7.0.beta1, so you can gem install mailcatcher --pre. Give it a go?. This seems to pop up on some systems, and we haven't identified why. What operating system / ruby version / sqlite version is your system running?\n. Let's fix this by removing sqlite in #298.. Sorry, this is an error with your ruby/openssl install. Make sure ruby -r digest/md5 -r openssl -e \"puts OpenSSL::VERSION\" works on your system before trying MailCatcher. Re-open if the problem persists once openssl is working.\n. Should be fixed by #242\n. This should be fixed by #258 thanks to @grant-mccarriagher, included in v0.6.3. Please update and comment again if you have issues.\n. There have been plans to add persistence support by setting a database path or something for a while now, so we probably won't do this. Nice idea, though!\n. @kenorb that is not a solution for windows.\n@fede91it, @bezin: it sounds like your ruby and sqlite installations are having some issues, probably best tracked in the sqlite gem. Sounds like that issue has been resolved anyway so maybe try updating the sqlite gem and running mailcatcher again. Otherwise please follow up in the sqlite gem.\n. Odd! Sounds like a threading issue. Please try updating mailcatcher and see if it fixes your issues. If not, please comment again.\n. This is by design. Mailcatcher only keeps mail in memory while running.\n. (You could download the mail if you wish to keep it.)\n. They are being done in decoration and this should be fixed.\n. https://github.com/sj26/mailcatcher#api\n```\ndelete all messages\ncurl -X DELETE http://localhost:1080/messages\ndelete message 123\ncurl -X DELETE http://localhost:1080/messages/123\n```\nIf you have that many emails you may want to consider restarting mailcatcher, or clearing the emails occasionally. I'd prefer to keep it simple.\n. Quite right. Have you tested this across different browsers? Some get finnicky about iframe content.\n. /usr/local/bin (where gems usually install their scripts) may no longer be in your PATH thanks to OS X. Try using the full patch to catchmail (you can find it using which catchmail on your shell) instead of /usr/bin/env catchmail in your php configuration. If this doesn't resolve your issue feel free to re-open the issue.\n. Rvm does strange things to gem scripts. Have you tried following the instructions for rvm in the readme?\n. @tymat do you use homebrew on OS X El Capitan? If so, try:\nPKG_CONFIG_PATH=\"$(brew --prefix openssl)/lib/pkgconfig\" gem install eventmachine -v \"1.0.8\"\n. Please upgrade to 0.6.2.\n. Please upgrade and try 0.6.2. Re-open this issue if it does not resolve your issue.\n. See #210, and please try version 0.6.2.\n. Thanks, this sounds like a configuration issue. Closing.\n. Done on master.\n. Thanks. This sounds like an ipv6 configuration issue.\n. env has not moved in El Capitan:\n``` sh\n$ sw_vers\nProductName:    Mac OS X\nProductVersion: 10.11.1\nBuildVersion:   15B42\n$ which env\n/usr/bin/env\n```\nThe location of catchmail is dictated by your ruby setup. If you have the default system ruby, catchmail gets installed in /usr/local/bin:\n```\n$ export PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\"\n$ which ruby\n/usr/bin/ruby\n$ ruby --version\nruby 2.0.0p645 (2015-04-13 revision 50299) [universal.x86_64-darwin15]\n$ sudo gem install mailcatcher\nSuccessfully installed mailcatcher-0.6.1\n$ which catchmail\n/usr/local/bin/catchmail\n```\nI don't use rvm, so am unsure of the default location. I suggest you run which catchmail and use that instead of /usr/bin/env catchmail in your php configuration per the PHP/RVM instructions. Or you could add your RVM script path to your /etc/paths. But this is a problem with your specific environment I'm afraid.\nSadly I cannot accept this PR.\n. This is because OS X El Capitan doesn't include the OpenSSL headers any more (thanks apple).\nIf you've got OpenSSL in homebrew, please try:\nPKG_CONFIG_PATH=\"$(brew --prefix openssl)/lib/pkgconfig\" gem install eventmachine -v \"1.0.8\"\n. Linking openssl into a standard library lookup location means the binary libraries could be loaded by another application which hasn't been built with homebrew. This could have unintended consequences.\nI'd recommend instead compiling and linking things which need homebrew's ssl explicitly, like with the pkg config incantation.\n. Closing, please comment again if the command I posted above doesn't work for you.\n. sigh\nUnfortunately this is probably a leak in eventmachine somewhere. I am unable to diagnose it locally. Latest mailcatcher for me runs stably and even recovers resident memory after a little while.\nIf you'd care to do some delving with https://github.com/tmm1/stackprof and see what's happening that would be wonderful. Otherwise I have no way to reproduce or fix this.\n. No, thank you. I consider this a non-feature of mailcatcher. Process supervision belongs to your operating system. See #46.\nTo daemonise as a system service which can be sent signals please use something like upstart, systemd, or launchctl, or start-stop-daemon in combination with mailcatcher --foreground.\n. Oh! Nice catch, thank you.\n. (There is a more complicated issue. The MailCatcher UI can get out of sync, especially when multiple copies of the UI are open. Probably should investigate using something a little more resilient.)\n. Gemfile.lock has been removed in 433fad4e and we're now using new travis build infrastructure in 0c1a1e41.\n. Eventmachine has been bumped to 1.0.9.1 in 79e023ef and the Gemfile.lock removed in 433fad4e.\n. Mailcatcher does not support rails. We can't guarantee that MailCatcher will simultaneously retain compatibility with all versions of activesupport so it will track dependencies independently.\nPlease see https://github.com/sj26/mailcatcher#bundler\n. @ACPK sorry, my wording was a bit confusing!\nMailCatcher supports receiving email from rails. But it is an independent gem and should not be included in your Gemfile. Your rails application's dependencies may be entirely different to MailCatcher's, potentially conflicting.\nI hope that's clearer. :smile: \n. The solution is: don't put MailCatcher in your Gemfile. It is an independent tool. Install MailCatcher with gem install mailcatcher\n. For rails you could put it into your bin/setup script. Think of MailCatcher like MySQL or Postgres, or your other application dependencies. :-). If you're running mailcatcher from github you'll need to bundle install. Make sure you git pull origin master first. Does that fix your issue?\n. I think this is because rubygems is terrible.\nI managed to replicate this by installing rails beta (have you done that too?) then installing mailcatcher and running mailcatcher. Thin quite happily activates rack-2.0.0.alpha (installed by rails 5), but sinatra requires \"~> 1.5\", hence why it can't activate and load sinatra.\nRubygems doesn't seem to lock activates gems dependencies before they're required. Mailcatcher explicitly specifies which gems it needs, and what versions they should be. Rubygems should be able to resolve a working set from these. But I guess it can't, and that's why we invented Bundler.\nArgh.\n. Right. So I've made mailcatcher explicitly activate its gem dependencies. Please install 0.6.4 and see if it solves your issues.\n. @NullVoxPopuli please see #267.\n. This isn't quite semantially correct. 4.9.9 is not the maximum version number before 5.0.0.beta1 or any other pre-release. Rubygems pre-release versioning is a bit strange.\nBut requiring ~> 4.0 should work because it converts pre-release versions to release versions for comparison. I've added this as a requirement on master. Please pull and try the latest master.\n. Can you provide an example email, full source, which triggers this error?\n. Please try v0.6.5 and reopen with a source message causing the error and fresh backtrace if you're still having issues.\n. You could do this by wrapping mailcatcher in a reverse proxy. I'm not sure I see a use case for putting it in the gem itself. What do you have in mind?\n. This looks like a rubygems bug, folks. Not sure what, I can't replicate it. What version of rubygems are you using? (Post the output of gem environment).\n. Can you also please post the full stack trace? The meaningful bit is probably in the middle somewhere.\n. Right. So I've made mailcatcher explicitly activate its gem dependencies. Please install 0.6.4 and see if it solves your issues.\n. I still can't reproduce this. It might be based on the combination of gems installed. Anybody affected could you please provide as much information as possible: what is your ruby version, how is it installed, the full output of gem environment and gem list.\n. I've just noticed: everybody seems to be using rvm, and gemsets. Have you tried installing without gemsets?\n. @GuillaumeLegendre I've installed the same version of rvm, ruby, created a gemset, and installed all the same gems and versions, but I don't see the error:\nhttps://gist.github.com/sj26/35dc5e343d45f0177a07\nAre your gems distributed between your gemsets? Which are in global versus investissement_pierre?\n. @jaydorsey thanks! That sounds exactly like the problem. It only seems to occur in rvm with gemsets. Seems rvm does some magic with bundler and bundler-unload. This sounds likely:\nhttps://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/issues/1420#issuecomment-167939914\nThere is a patch proposed:\nhttps://gist.github.com/mpapis/bac6163f8855e12f7833\nI haven't tried reproducing using bundler but I'll give it a go.\n. This is unfortunately a bug in the combination of Rubygems, Bundler and RVM, not something controllable within MailCatcher itself. @charazn's instructions per the README are the safest way to install MailCatcher with RVM.\n. It doesn't.\nIt seems to happen in a particular edge case with rubygems, rvm and bundler. MailCatcher being an independent gem often used within projects with similar dependencies using bundler seems to hit the edge case more often.\n. Please try upgrading rubygems and mailcatcher and open a new issue with a fresh backtrace if you're still having issues.\n. Not as part of the core project, no. I'd be open to a third party packager?\nI'll close this, reopen if you come up with a prototype or ideas.\n. Can you not filter in your consumer?\n. I'd consider adding this, but would prefer to do so carefully. If you'd like something which works already maybe try MailHog \u2014 they seem to have a search endpoint.\n. Ah, I see the use case. Have you tried something like:\n``` ruby\nHTTParty.get(\"http://localhost:1080/messages\").any? { |message| message[\"sender\"].include? \"me@sj26.com\" }\n=> true\n``\n. Hmm, weird! Please try upgrading to v0.6.5, running withmailcatcher --foregroundand see if the error still occurs. If so, please reopen with a fresh backtrace.\n. Please try v0.6.5 and reopen with a fresh backtrace if you're still having issues.\n. Sorry, after browsing the [codebeat page for mailcatcher](https://codebeat.co/projects/github-com-sj26-mailcatcher) there are no quick wins that I consider a problem, or for which I would probably accept a pull request. I like the size, simplicity, and encapsulation level of theMailCatcher::Mail` module, and neither of the two repeated methods would be better extracted, imho.\nHappy to be proven wrong with a compelling change. :-)\n. This is a repository for MailCatcher, a ruby tool.\nFor help getting started with Ruby and Rails I suggest reaching out to the Ruby on Rails community asking your question on Stack Overflow, or jumping on the #rubyonrails IRC channel on irc.freenode.net.\nGood luck!\n. MailCatcher itself hasn't changed and remains compatible with Ruby 1.9. It seems upstream dependencies of the mail gem have precluded 1.9 and Rubygems isn't smart enough to limit its dependency resolution to the ruby version. :-(\nIf you manually install a mime-types-data gem version for 1.9 before installing mailcatcher it might work.\n. Try this, which worked for me on ruby 1.9.3-p551 with an empty gemset:\n```\n$ gem install mime-types --version \"< 3\"\nFetching: mime-types-2.99.1.gem (100%)\nSuccessfully installed mime-types-2.99.1\n1 gem installed\n$ gem install mailcatcher --conservative\nFetching: i18n-0.7.0.gem (100%)\nFetching: json-1.8.3.gem (100%)\nBuilding native extensions.

There is already an issue in rubygems: rubygems/rubygems#968\n. MailCatcher still works on Ruby 1.9, see my instructions above. A better solution requires changes within rubygems which are unlikely soon, and over which I have no control.\nClosing because more +1s aren't useful and its outside mailcatcher's control.\n. To install on Ruby 1.9:\ngem install mime-types --version \"< 3\"\ngem install --conservative mailcatcher\nYou will get an error but it worked; try running mailcatcher.\n. If you have trouble installing mailcatcher on ruby 1.9, please try:\ngem install mime-types --version \"< 3\"\ngem install --conservative mailcatcher\nIf this doesn't work, please file a new issue.. Default behavior for action mailer in development is not to raise delivery errors. This is included in the default config/environments/development.rb:\n# Don't care if the mailer can't send.\n  config.action_mailer.raise_delivery_errors = false\nHave you changed this setting?\n. Oh, you mean you would like a fallback method?\n. I've added this to the README under the Rails recommendation.\n. This feature doesn't currently work. I'll see if I can polish it up for release. This has been a common request, and it probably couldn't hurt.\n. I haven't had time to fix it up yet, sorry. Feel free to take a stab if you like.\n. Neat, thanks!\n. Oh no! \ud83d\ude35\nWhat version of linux, which browser are you using, and what is its version? And what version of windows, which browser, and its version?\n. Internet Explorer 9 does not support websockets, but it should still be polling. Have you tried refreshing the page? Are there any javascript errors?\n. Can you run mailcatcher -f and confirm that the output shows mailcatcher is receiving the message?\n. Just to clarify:\nYou're running MailCatcher on Linux, sending it email over smtp, viewing the web interface on your Linux computer in Firefox and the messages appear, and viewing the web interface on your Windows machine in Internet explorer but the messages do not appear, even if you refresh the page, except sometimes they appear after some time?\nI really am not sure what's going on here, sorry. :-(\nWeird browser caching by internet explorer? Have you tried a hard refresh, with Shift+F5?\n. Yeah, sorry I'm not sure I can fix this one. If you're able to provide some screenshots/logs from IE showing the failure maybe I can fix it, and reopen this if you do, but otherwise I'm unable to reproduce.\n. JSON is included in the ruby standard library, but is 1.8.something now I think. I wonder what is depending on \"~> 1.7\".\nThe docker build is actually broken for me because the ruby version is too old and mime-types-data won't install. I'll update the Dockerfile generally.\n. I've just used the ruby:2.3 base image and installed the gem. Works a treat!\nThanks for alerting to the issue.\n. (Note we can't use ruby:slim because it doesn't include enough headers for gem compilation, or things like sqlite3. We could probably slim down the image by uninstalling ruby development dependencies once the gems are installed then collapsing FS layers, but it works as-is.)\n. Ah, this is a duplicate of #227\n. Please try v0.6.5 and reopen with a fresh backtrace if you're still having issues.\n. Merged (manually)!\n. This is super difficult because your application could send multiple messages with the same Message-ID (although it shouldn't). This feature won't be added to MailCatcher core at the moment, although maybe in the future there will be a better search API.\nMaybe use the MailCatcher API to walk the messages and find the one you're after.\n. Please try v0.6.5 and reopen with a fresh backtrace if you're still having issues.\n. Oh no!\nCan you please provide a full example email which triggers this problem? You can just click Download in MailCatcher.\n. Please try v0.6.5 and see if it solves your problem. Otherwise please reopen with a full message source which triggers the error in MailCatcher. Thanks!\n. That's a very old version of mailcatcher: 0.2.4.\nPlease try upgrading: gem install mailcatcher\n. Nope, sorry, I consider this out of scope. This tool isn't mean to be Gmail, and doesn't purport to sandbox email because there's no hope we could ever get it right. This is why MailCatcher only binds to 127.0.0.1 by default.\n. Yeah, fair call. I've removed the activesupport dependency entirely which fixed encoding behaviour considerably, and also made mail and websocket handling more resilient so hopefully more of the encoding errors go away or at least give useful feedback. v0.6.5 released, get it while it's hot.\n. Thanks for your contribution!\nThese are locked down for reasons. Thin/skinny and sinatra all require pre 2.0 versions of rack.\nWhy does MailCatcher need gem compatibility with Rails 5? It shouldn't be in your Gemfile.\n. Bundler, sadly, is not designed as a generic distribution system, but as a specific application dependency manager. The interplay of installing first with Rubygems, then with Bundler, or magically bundling during gem post_install or something, seems cumbersome and error prone.\nI'm working on a version of MailCatcher which uses no compiled native gems and vendors all dependencies as this is the only way I can think of to remove this category of issue once and for all. I'll let you know when it's ready for beta. :-)\n. Rack 2+ is not compatible with mailcatcher at this time. This pull request breaks things.\nDo not put mailcatcher in your Gemfile. Put it in bin/setup in your rails projects.. Sorry you folks are having trouble. Windows and ruby is always a pain. Please try the latest rubyinstaller. Otherwise make sure you can ruby -r sqlite3 from a console. You can also run mailcatcher in the foreground to see what it's doing if it seems to die silently with mailcatcher --foreground. Reopen this issue with more details from those commands if it's still affecting you.\n. Yeah the API is definitely the best bet. You could write a little mailcatcher cli gem if you like. But I probably won't roll it into mailcatcher core. Thanks!\n. This is more and more necessary given how EventMachine, Thin, and the whole ruby world have moved on.\nRefactoring into a pure-ruby threaded smtp + http server with some basic websocket support would probably be fine. I might take a look at this tonight while I'm on a plane. I've been procrastinating for far too long.. You need to bundle exec:\nbundle exec rake assets\nPackage the gem with rake, too:\nbundle exec rake package\nThere is a major rework in progress which will probably get rid of a lot of these issues.\n. Yeah sorry I pushed a fix for that to master.\n. See https://github.com/sj26/mailcatcher/issues/277#issuecomment-209154903. Try:\ngem install mime-types --version \"< 3\"\ngem install --conservative mailcatcher\n. No worries, it should probably go in the README or something, although I have a longer term fix in the works. ^_^\n. Good idea! There are a bunch of events which should be propagated client side which aren't, and this is one of them. I've got a clientside rework in progress which should fix this.\n. Please don't put MailCatcher in your Gemfile. It is an application in its own right with its own dependencies that can't possibly interoperates with every version of rails.\nSimply:\ngem install mailcatcher\nmailcatcher\nYou can put the gem install in your bin/setup if you like.\nAlternately, I just removed activesupport as a dependency in the latest MailCatcher release. You could try upgrading.\n. That looks like you're sending utf-8 characters as part of a plain text encoding, which mail clients will expect to be ASCII. Can you try something like:\n```php\n$subject = 'Test';\n$headers = \"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8\"\n$body = '\u00e4\u00f6\u00fc';\nif(mail('test@test.com', $subject, $body, $headers)) {\n    echo 'sent';\n} else {\n    echo 'not sent';\n}\n```\nIf this doesn't work please re-open with a full message body as PHP sends it so I can reproduce.. Good point! If there were an easy, compatible way to make MailCatcher bind to the loopback interface addresses automagically I would, but it's not that easy. So this change is a good idea. Thanks!\n. Nice find! Shows how many folks use MailCatcher programmatically, haha. Thanks!\n. Oh no! I'm sorry that's not working for you.\nI've just tried this myself locally and I get the correct result:\n\nCould you confirm a few details for me?\n- What version of MailCatcher are you running? (mailcatcher --version)\n- What version of Ruby are you running? (ruby --version)\n- What gems do you have installed? (gem list)\nThis smells like a ruby version issue. Older ruby wasn't great at encodings.\n. @jbouzekri that's an older version of mailcatcher, and it looks like the docker image has moved on. Have you tried doing docker pull schickling/mailcatcher?\n$ docker run --rm -it schickling/mailcatcher mailcatcher --version\nmailcatcher 0.6.5\n. This should be fixed in the most recent version.. Anybody affected by this issue: could you please upload a message body which triggers this error so I can reproduce and perhaps fix this issue.. I'm sorry it's not working for you, but it works fine for me:\n\nCould you please provide an example message which doesn't work?\nHere's an example I tried using the Ruby mail gem (which is how mailcatcher reads email, too):\nsh\n$ ruby --require mail\nirb> Mail.defaults { delivery_method :smtp, address: \"localhost\", port: 1025 }\nirb> Mail.new(to: \"foo@example.com\", from: \"bar@example.com\", subject: \"H\u00e9llo\", body: \"H\u00e9llo\").deliver\nNon US-ASCII detected and no charset defined.\nDefaulting to UTF-8, set your own if this is incorrect.\n=> #<Mail::Message:70286438842840, Multipart: false, Headers: <Date: Sat, 10 Dec 2016 22:03:55 +1100>, <From: bar@example.com>, <To: foo@example.com>, <Message-ID: <584be11b4fedf_f54e3fecd483f9b8284c8@Bumblebee.local.mail>>, <Subject: H\u00e9llo>, <Mime-Version: 1.0>, <Content-Type: text/plain>, <Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64>>\nAnd the message body it sent:\n```http\nDate: Sat, 10 Dec 2016 22:03:55 +1100\nFrom: bar@example.com\nTo: foo@example.com\nMessage-ID: 584be11b4fedf_f54e3fecd483f9b8284c8@Bumblebee.local.mail\nSubject: =?UTF-8?Q?H=C3=A9llo?=\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain;\n charset=UTF-8\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: base64\nSMOpbGxv\n```\nThis also works:\n```http\nDate: Sat, 10 Dec 2016 22:03:55 +1100\nFrom: bar@example.com\nTo: foo@example.com\nMessage-ID: 584be11b4fedf_f54e3fecd483f9b8284c8@Bumblebee.local.mail\nSubject: =?UTF-8?Q?H=C3=A9llo?=\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain;\n charset=UTF-8\nH\u00e9llo\n```\nPerhaps you are missing a charset in your mail header?. I'm going to close this for now. If somebody has an issue with character encodings in mailcatcher please provide the full message body (with headers and mime) along with the errors it is triggering as a new issue.. Please upgrade rubygems:\ngem update --system\n. What about if the \"Clear\" button confirms the first time after page load, then just works silently from that point on?\nYour second suggestion I think would be covered by #266. I don't wish to constrict folks using newer ruby from running later versions of these gems. They might solve other issues and bugs.\nIt is an unfortunate caveat of rubygems that it doesn't consider ruby version compatibility when resolving dependencies. You can force it to by installing a compatible version of mime-types explicitly first, then mailcatcher:\ngem install mime-types --version \"< 3\"\ngem install --conservative mailcatcher. I'm sorry that you see a fix for your specific situation which you think should be applied here, but I do not believe it is an improvement for the whole.\nMailCatcher works on the latest Ruby with the latest mail and mime-type gems, and that's the way I recommend running it. The dependencies are open because it should work with future versions, given mail follows semantic versioning. The mail gem's message parsing and compatibility is always improving, so using the latest version is not an imagined improvement, but a real one.\nIf you want or need to constrict your ruby version to 1.9, I've made sure MailCatcher itself works with 1.9 and its dependencies have versions which are available there. How those dependencies are installed might be trickier, but there is a way to make it work.. Yes, please remove the gem from your gemfile and install with rubygems and run directly instead.. Sorry, I have no idea why this happens! Maybe you need to recompile your rbenv ruby? If you can figure it out and would like to contribute it would be most welcome.. You could also try: gem pristine eventmachine\nThis seems like a environment issue, closing without further details.. Because bumping minor versions of eventmachine breaks a lot of stuff, historically.\nI'll try out 1.2.1 some time and bump it if nothing breaks.. Thanks for the contribution!\nI don't want to allow all origins at everything all the time for everybody because it's a potential security hole. MailCatcher runs on a known port, so if I can get a visitor to come to a malicious page where I control javascript and probe port 1080 then I can start controlling your MailCatcher instance, and potentially probe for and exploit vulnerabilities.\nMaybe if it were opt-in?. Nice idea!. Ah, I can replicate this! But I had to netcat to mailcatcher directly to perform an SMTP exchange and paste your exact mail message:\n```\n$ nc localhost 1025\nEHLO localhost\n250-Ok EventMachine SMTP Server\n250-NO-SOLICITING\n250 SIZE 20000000\nMAIL FROM:hidden@email.com\n250 Ok\nRCPT TO:hidden@email.com\n250 Ok\nDATA\n354 Send it\nFrom: =?UTF-8?B?Q29tcHRhYmlsaXTDqSBPcm1pZWw=?= hidden@email.com\nTo: Name hidden@email.com\nDate: Thu, 29 Dec 2016 08:38:30 +0000\nMessage-ID: 43670e26007741bdbc30af51fb06d641@compta.local.phea.fr\nSubject: [Ormiel] =?UTF-8?B?UsOpaW5pdGlhbGlzYXRpb24gZHUgbW90IGRlIHBhc3Nl?=\nMIME-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\nhtml PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN\"\n\n\nEmail/html\n\n\nBonjour Olivier,\nVous avez demand\u00e9 un nouveau mot de passe pour le site Comptabilit\u00e9.\nSi vous n'avez pas fait cette demande, ignorez cette email.\n\nSi vous souhaitez un nouveau mot de passe, cliquez sur le lien ci-dessous\nJe r\u00e9initialise mon mot de passe\n\n\n.\n250 Message accepted\nQUIT\n221 Ok\n```\nThe message is received and stored, but then I get the error you quote from the thread sending the websocket message:\nException: \"\\xC3\" from ASCII-8BIT to UTF-8\nThis is because Eventmachine's SMTP server has just read the message as a bunch of bytes and marked it as \"ASCII\" encoded (which is the correct default SMTP network encoding), stored it as such, and when we actually try to use the message for presentation it attempts to convert it to the JSON-compatible UTF-8 encoding, but it has invalid ASCII characters.\nIt took me a little while to figure this out: Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit is an SMTP extension. Eventmachine's SMTP server does not support it, and should be throwing an error earlier in the exchange. Your Mail/SMTP library is submitted an 8-bit encoded message to an SMTP server that is not advertising 8-bit compatibility. It should be formatting as quoted-printable or similar. Running this message through catchmail (which uses the mail gem which sanitizes quite a lot and respects SMTP capabilities) actually changes it to something the SMTP server supports:\n```\nDate: Thu, 29 Dec 2016 08:38:30 +0000\nFrom: =?UTF-8?B?Q29tcHRhYmlsaXTDqSBPcm1pZWw=?= hidden@email.com\nTo: Name hidden@email.com\nMessage-ID: 43670e26007741bdbc30af51fb06d641@compta.local.phea.fr\nSubject: =?UTF-8?Q?[Ormiel]_R=C3=A9initialisation_du_mot_de_passe?=\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/html;\n charset=UTF-8\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\nhtml PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN\"\n\n\nEmail/html\n\n\nBonjour Olivier,\nVous avez demand=C3=A9 un nouveau mot de passe pour le site Comptabili=\nt=C3=A9.\nSi vous n'avez pas fait cette demande, ignorez cette email.\n\nSi vous souhaitez un nouveau mot de passe, cliquez sur le lien ci-dess=\nous\nJe r=C3=A9=\ninitialise mon mot de passe\n\n\n```\nBut the message content is exactly the same.\nIf you'd like to fix the SMTP server in Eventmachine to support 8-bit transfer encoding implicitly (which is kinda incorrect but lenient) then this might go away?. UTF-8 is not valid over the wire for SMTP unless the mail server advertises 8-bit encoding, which MailCatcher does not. If you a receiving errors here then I'm afraid you or your mail library is not correctly encoding your sent email and you should probably make sure that is fixed so your mail is received correctly.. @thebarty please re-open or file another issue if the latest version of mailcatcher and the above fix aren't working for you.. UTF-8 is not valid over the wire for SMTP unless the mail server advertises 8-bit encoding, which MailCatcher does not. If you a receiving errors here then I'm afraid you or your mail library is not correctly encoding your sent email and you should probably make sure that is fixed so your mail is received correctly.. See https://github.com/sj26/mailcatcher/issues/277#issuecomment-209154903. Hi @koalabear974, I don't have a Windows system to get this running myself but if you want to contribute a patch it would be most welcome! Otherwise I'm afraid I'm unable to fix this and will close.. UTF-8 is not valid over the wire for SMTP unless the mail server advertises 8-bit encoding, which MailCatcher does not. If you a receiving errors here then I'm afraid you or your mail library is not correctly encoding your sent email.. SMTP is by default a 7-bit protocol:\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc821#page-3\nSo bodies containing bytes which require the high bit set must be encoded in some other form, usually quoted printable. The mail gem (used within rails) should probably be doing this for you transparently.\nSMTP was only extended later to 8-bit by RFC5321 and then only when the server advertises a 8BITMIME capability which MailCatcher does not. . The message[\"source\"] is not decoded, it should be the literal SMTP transmitted message body which should be 7-bit ascii (which is valid utf-8). If you're getting an encoding error here then the message wasn't encoded properly and isn't a clean 7-bit subset of utf-8, so forcing it to be utf-8 by replacing bad characters is going to munge the source and lie about your message over json.. The only decoded part is that lines with double periods would be replaced with single periods.. The real solve here would be to make sure that the message source when received via SMTP contains only valid 7-bit bytes and raise the error earlier with clearer instructions on how to fix it in the sender.. (or just rewrite the whole smtp server and build in 8bit mime support supporting first-class encodings and again raising errors earlier in the smtp exchange when invalid content is supplied.). That's a very old version of sqlite3 (over 10 years!). Sounds like the sqlite3 gem isn't going to work with that version (\"Note that this module is only compatible with SQLite 3.6.16 or newer\"). Perhaps try upgrading it?. @tesmond you can try installing an earlier version, but it may not be easy to resolve all the interdependencies (ymmv).\nIt looks like https://github.com/sparklemotion/sqlite3-ruby/commit/f87fc04932d56c8d8f51706e511ef16bd5f0b253 documented the dependency corresponding to the v1.3.5 tag. Maybe try v1.3.4:\n$ gem install sqlite3 -v 1.3.4\nThen try installing mailcatcher again conservatively, it should work with any 1.3 version of the sqlite3 gem:\n$ gem install mailcatcher --conservative. Given there's been no activity here for a while I'll close this one.. Weird! Do you have any browser extensions installed?. Ah, lprequeststart, lprequestend and lpsubmit are solid hints \u2014 it's LastPass.. I'm not sure, sorry, but this seems like a LastPass bug. Maybe you can exclude MailCatcher from within LastPass? . This looks like a bug in LastPass (see #331).. Sorry, I don't know or use PHP. \ud83d\ude05 Can you copy the full source of the message from the Source tab and paste it here?. Ah, so email headers finish and the body begins at the first double newline. So your headers are finishing at:\nReply-To: mysite\nSo the MIME and content-type headers are being seen as part of the body, so ignored. Perhaps you need to take a look at how you're calling the PHP mail function, or how you're appending those headers?. Both have open compatibility issues and subtly break skinny and mailcatcher unfortunately.\nIf somebody wants to do an upgrade and fix the compatibility in a PR that'd be great! I'm more inclined to semi-rewrite MailCatcher eschewing the C extensions for something a bit more portable with completely vendored gems, though. I had a wip a while back. I'm on a plane later today, might give it a crack.. (Also note that MailCatcher works fine in ruby 2.4, just issues warnings.). Puma doesn\u2019t use eventmachine so doesn\u2019t fit in event loop for smtp and websockets.. MailCatcher does not have an IMAP interface.\nYou might try using the API, though.. The From is the FROM address supplied when the mail is sent via SMTP, not the value from the RFC822 From header (but the address component is usually the same if your mail-sending library is working correctly). If you want to double-check the From header take a look inside the Source tab. :-). Hi @samdjstevens! Sadly that sounds like it might be your script or mail library might be buffering the messages somehow. MailCatcher should display messages as soon as they are received over the SMTP connection.\nDo you have an example I can run to replicate the problem?. Ah, glad you got it sorted out! :-). I'd love to do this! But I have no idea how.\nI tried a while ago to offer integration with a service that did this, but then they wanted lots of money and this is an open source tool. Something like Litmus would be cool. But they're all paid services which require integration keys and things.\nThe best I could figure out was to offer a Download button and let folks upload to their email testing service of choice.\nI'm going to close this for now, because I don't think we can do anything more, but if you think of a way to do this please comment further!.

Note that the split between CMD and ENTRYPOINT is designed so that you can docker run sj26/mailcatcher and it works fine, or you can override the arguments for more control like docker run sj26/mailcatcher --ip 127.0.0.1.

I'm curious why it's not working for you, but afaik this is all working as intended, so I'll close this. Sounds like you've got a solve for you problem: using a forked Dockerfile. Thanks. :-). Latest thin breaks websockets. Can't merge.. I don't think the gems are even compatible here, I'm afraid. We've already tried this in #226.. Sadly there is no way to know. The underlying error message is:\n```\n\n```\nIf you can figure it out then patches are welcomed! :-). Mailcatcher is locked to a particular version of eventmachine because it tends to break very easily. Unfortunately rubygems doesn't seem to respect intergem dependencies very well so the wrong versions are often activated. :-(. Your solution here is the correct solution, for now:\n$ gem uninstall eventmachine\n$ gem install eventmachine -v 1.0.9.1\nLonger term this should be solved by #298. mailcatcher 0.6.5 runs just fine for me on macOS 10.12.6 using Ruby 2.4.1. Support for macOS and 2.4.x are fine.\nCould you please elaborate on \"The web portal won't load properly\" - what exactly does this mean \u2014\u00a0nothing loads at all? no messages are shown? the connection is interrupted?\nWhat version of macOS are you running? High Sierra has known problems with programs which daemonise, which MailCatcher does. Try running mailcatcher --foreground on High Sierra and see if that helps.\nIt does look like MailCatcher is failing to listen to the ports correctly or daemonise somehow.. Have you reinstalled ruby or something recently? It looks like your installed version of thin can't talk to your installed version of ruby.\nTry:\ngem pristine --all. Oh dear, that's no good \u2014 sorry!\nDo you have a full message body which when sent to MailCatcher triggers this behaviour? I need to reproduce it to fix it. :-). ",

OS/Ruby/Gemfiles? Could this be an encoding issue?\n. Thanks, I do appreciate the help.\nSo looks like latest mailcatcher specifies mail ~> 2.3, rails (actionmailer) 3.2.8 and 3.2.10 specify ~> 2.4.4, so the chosen gem is mail (2.4.4). Current mail version is 2.5.3, about a month old. Looks like quite a few bugs have been patched.\nI'm on ruby 1.9.3p194 (2012-04-20 revision 35410) [x86_64-darwin12.2.1].\nThere are several other devs working on this exact same repo without this issue, so my guess is that it's not necessarily mailcatcher itself. \n.

Fascinating, thanks for digging into this. Everything is generated using ActionMailer, so I'm puzzled why headers would be missing. I'll dig around and see.\nThanks!\n. Just for posterity sake, in my config/environment/development.rb I added:\nrequire 'digest/sha2'\n  ... \n  config.action_mailer.default = { 'Message-ID' => \"<#{Digest::SHA2.hexdigest(Time.now.to_i.to_s)}@example.com>\" }\nwhich resolved the issue. Not sure why this is an issue on some setups of the same rails project, and not others.\nWe can probably close this issue, thanks @sj26!\n. @marktabler, fascinating. Were you able to reproduce the error with the test script? What OS/ruby/rails/etc. are you on? Does anyone else in the group have a similar issue?\nI'm curious to see if we can establish a common denominator.\n. I started getting this same bug today. What's weird is that I didn't have the issue yesterday, and I didn't change the e-mail. @mmrobins or @sj26 any progress?\n. The only thing I can think of is config changes to my system (I restarted this morning)\nI also have a slightly different stacktrace (annoymized):\n.../rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p194/lib/ruby/1.9.1/net/smtp.rb:948:in `check_response': 550 Message rejected (Net::SMTPFatalError)\n    from .../rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p194/lib/ruby/1.9.1/net/smtp.rb:902:in `data'\n    from .../rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p194/lib/ruby/1.9.1/net/smtp.rb:660:in `block in send_message'\n    from .../rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p194/lib/ruby/1.9.1/net/smtp.rb:849:in `rcptto_list'\n    from .../rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p194/lib/ruby/1.9.1/net/smtp.rb:660:in `send_message'\n    from .../ruby/1.9.1/gems/mail-2.4.4/lib/mail/network/delivery_methods/smtp.rb:145:in `block in deliver!'\n    from .../rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p194/lib/ruby/1.9.1/net/smtp.rb:520:in `start'\n    from .../ruby/1.9.1/gems/mail-2.4.4/lib/mail/network/delivery_methods/smtp.rb:144:in `deliver!'\n    from .../ruby/1.9.1/gems/mail-2.4.4/lib/mail/message.rb:2034:in `do_delivery'\n    from .../ruby/1.9.1/gems/mail-2.4.4/lib/mail/message.rb:229:in `block in deliver'\n    from .../ruby/1.9.1/gems/actionmailer-3.2.8/lib/action_mailer/base.rb:415:in `block in deliver_mail'\n    from .../ruby/1.9.1/gems/activesupport-3.2.8/lib/active_support/notifications.rb:123:in `block in instrument'\n    from .../ruby/1.9.1/gems/activesupport-3.2.8/lib/active_support/notifications/instrumenter.rb:20:in `instrument'\n    from .../ruby/1.9.1/gems/activesupport-3.2.8/lib/active_support/notifications.rb:123:in `instrument'\n    from .../ruby/1.9.1/gems/actionmailer-3.2.8/lib/action_mailer/base.rb:413:in `deliver_mail'\n    from .../ruby/1.9.1/gems/mail-2.4.4/lib/mail/message.rb:229:in `deliver'\n    from tmp/test_mailcatcher.rb:36:in `<main>'\nMessage source:\n```\nDate: Fri, 04 Jan 2013 17:53:10 -0500\nFrom: test@localhost\nTo: myemail@gmail.com\nSubject: testing mail\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: multipart/alternative;\n boundary=\"--==_mimepart_50e75d56c7f2e_10d73fcfd8435ad46286f\";\n charset=UTF-8\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\n----==_mimepart_50e75d56c7f2e_10d73fcfd8435ad46286f\nDate: Fri, 04 Jan 2013 17:53:10 -0500\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain;\n charset=UTF-8\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\ntext only e-mail\n----==_mimepart_50e75d56c7f2e_10d73fcfd8435ad46286f\nDate: Fri, 04 Jan 2013 17:53:10 -0500\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/html;\n charset=UTF-8\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nhellowlrldtext\n----==_mimepart_50e75d56c7f2e_10d73fcfd8435ad46286f--\n```\n.

OS/Ruby/Gemfiles? Could this be an encoding issue?\n. Thanks, I do appreciate the help.\nSo looks like latest mailcatcher specifies mail ~> 2.3, rails (actionmailer) 3.2.8 and 3.2.10 specify ~> 2.4.4, so the chosen gem is mail (2.4.4). Current mail version is 2.5.3, about a month old. Looks like quite a few bugs have been patched.\nI'm on ruby 1.9.3p194 (2012-04-20 revision 35410) [x86_64-darwin12.2.1].\nThere are several other devs working on this exact same repo without this issue, so my guess is that it's not necessarily mailcatcher itself. \n.

Fascinating, thanks for digging into this. Everything is generated using ActionMailer, so I'm puzzled why headers would be missing. I'll dig around and see.\nThanks!\n. Just for posterity sake, in my config/environment/development.rb I added:\nrequire 'digest/sha2'\n  ... \n  config.action_mailer.default = { 'Message-ID' => \"<#{Digest::SHA2.hexdigest(Time.now.to_i.to_s)}@example.com>\" }\nwhich resolved the issue. Not sure why this is an issue on some setups of the same rails project, and not others.\nWe can probably close this issue, thanks @sj26!\n. @marktabler, fascinating. Were you able to reproduce the error with the test script? What OS/ruby/rails/etc. are you on? Does anyone else in the group have a similar issue?\nI'm curious to see if we can establish a common denominator.\n. ",
    "mmrobins": "It actually went away for me briefly the other day when I upgraded my Rails app to 3.2.10, so I figured something there fixed it - but it's back today.  Also I reverted the Rails upgrade and tested it and still have this problem.  I emailed sj26 the full message source, and will anonymize the content so I can post it here.\n. @phillbaker That script triggers it for me too, nice.

http://github.com/sj26/mailcatcher/issues\n. @sj26 Thanks for looking into it.  I don't even get the error anymore, so definitely don't know how to get it to be repeatable.  I have a hunch that it might had had something to do with a gemset that used at some point that I'm not using now.  That is I may have run mailcatcher from a directory where there was a problem with the other gems installed in an rvm gemset specified in the .rvmrc, but wherever I run mailcatcher from now doesn't have that problem.  If I figure anything out for how to get this to happen reliably I'll update here.\n. It actually went away for me briefly the other day when I upgraded my Rails app to 3.2.10, so I figured something there fixed it - but it's back today.  Also I reverted the Rails upgrade and tested it and still have this problem.  I emailed sj26 the full message source, and will anonymize the content so I can post it here.\n. @phillbaker That script triggers it for me too, nice.  I think there's an extra end in your script, but after I got rid of that I get the following:\n```\n\u2500 [0]% ruby mailer_test.rb

http://github.com/sj26/mailcatcher/issues\n. @sj26 Thanks for looking into it.  I don't even get the error anymore, so definitely don't know how to get it to be repeatable.  I have a hunch that it might had had something to do with a gemset that used at some point that I'm not using now.  That is I may have run mailcatcher from a directory where there was a problem with the other gems installed in an rvm gemset specified in the .rvmrc, but wherever I run mailcatcher from now doesn't have that problem.  If I figure anything out for how to get this to happen reliably I'll update here.\n. ",

Turns out this error was occuring mailcatcher Net::SMTPFatalError (550 Unauthenticated senders not allowed.\n2. In my environment.rb I was also calling XXXXX::Application.initialize! before setting smtp_settings, which caused the Unauthenticated error above. Initializing after setting smtp_settings took care of the issue and Mailcatcher started catching emails again.\n. ",

Sorry to reopen this up but I am in a situation where I am starting to migrate an app to rails 5 in prep for the release and to enable some actioncable functionality.   I understand your point for not supporting rails dependencies directly but I have to point out that the mailcatcher dependencies have either master or releases that have been updated to deconflict with rails 5 versions and mailcatcher's dependencies are locked t versions that enforce conflicts. \nLong story short,  when working on migrating to rails 5 (which happens in development and where mailcatcher is useful) mailcatcher has locked dependency versions that conflict with the versions of gems that are required for rails 5.   For instance there is a newer version of sinatra that resolves rack version dependency issues but mailcatcher still is forcing an older version of sinatra.\nIt would be nice if the many people working to migrate to rails 5 along with the release could continue to rely on mailcatcher during the rework of their codebase.  Without updating the hard locks on gems the only solutions are really to either personal fork and force versioning or remove the gem and find a different solution for catching mail in dev.\nJust looking for a way to allow this gem to continue working for me while on this migration.
