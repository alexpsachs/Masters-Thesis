Tried this but can't seem to reproduce. If I have fragments on a vertical slide that is not yet visible I can still navigate downwards and the fragments don't start appearing until I arrive at the slide that contains them.\n\nCould you attach the markup for the slides where this happened?\n. Thanks for the addition. I made this a config option and added a listener for 'mousewheel' to support browsers beyond FF: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/commit/38b229a22f3f87038037f160e204953358eb0617\n. Glad you like it! Just tested this in the latest Canary (18.0.1025.5) and can not reproduce this. Think it's safe to assume this was a temporary bug in Canary.\nThanks for reporting.\n. Thanks for the report. Would love to see that presentation!\n. Cool, glad to hear it's been fixed.\n. Great idea, will try his out. Also working on a site for creating slides via an editor.\n. So... I finally got around to integrating data-markdown. Better late than never! :P\n. @jmikola I can see how it would make sense to not limit the height in code-only slides but there's no way of telling if that's a more common case as opposed to also having other content, such as a title, on the slide. That said, I don't think there's any reason to change this (which would also affect the layout of existing presentations).\n. The address bar will hide now. Don't have an Android device to test on but works on my iPhone.\nhttps://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/commit/1013ff7ba5d191fe36e9bd4cca07e6fef2d065e6\n. I'd prefer saying I've postponed it indefinitely :P \nI had second thoughts about using zoom.js for this as it has its limitations. Was thinking a semi-transparent overlay that covers the whole page and can scroll indefinitely would be more flexible. Something to play around with when there's time.\n. Cool, thanks man!\n. Thanks for the base print styles! I adjusted and fixes a few things and added it to the project. The library hides slides that are 3 or more steps away from the current (performance optimization) so that's why they weren't appearing during print.\n. Good stuff, thanks!\n. Won't be doing anything about this myself as compatibility with other libraries is not a priority. Open to fixes via pull requests though.\n. That's a good fix, thanks! Merged with some modifications https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/commit/0cd3b8d4309b20c189cc4c7c8a5e56d7e47d594b\n. I've been meaning to add triggers like this for CSS and just got around to it tonight. If you set data-state=\"something\" on a slide  the JS will now pick it up and apply it as a class on the document element when the slide is in view. This is meant for things like changing the body background color based on a particular slide but should be useful in your case as well.\nMight add JS callbacks down the line as well, thanks for the idea.\n. https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/commit/2c78eea0ca9496d5eb0e72d92b49aef8b220ef1d\n. Glad you like it. There's two ways you could link to specific slides:\n- If you have the 'history' option enabled, you can use href=\"#/5\"\n- Alternatively you can call Reveal.navigateTo( horizontalIndex, verticalIndex ), so to navigate to the 5th slide you would call Reveal.navigateTo( 5 )\n. Been considering this for a while but I think version numbering the filename is superfluous as the version is already stated inside of the file. It's also easier to upgrade by just replacing an old version with the new file without the need for updated references in HTML.\nAgree that it's about time to add a minified version, will do that separately as well as substantially reduce the size of the comment/license in the header.\n. Agree that it should display fragments in the overview. Should probably be possible by adding the following style to the end of the main.css sheet, although I can't test right now.\n.overview .fragment {\n    opacity: 1;\n}\n. Hm, should be possible to avoid the !important by adding being more specific with the selector, something like \nreveal.overview .slides section .fragment { opacity: 1; }\n. There's a site in the works which includes the ability to create decks via a GUI.\n. Nice to hear you'd like to contribute but unfortunately it's a private project for now. Perhaps it will be made public once the initial working version is done.\n. It would be possible with some modification to the reveal JS/CSS but wouldn't it be easier to update the HTML? The differences aren't that extensive.\n. The GUI editor was put on ice for a while as I worked on other things but it's ready for some beta testing now. Let me know if you want to try it: hakim.elhattab@gmail.com\nMajor thanks to @hrj for doing all of the server side work.\nUpdate: Known issues\n- Clicking on preview in the editor results in an error\n.

Yeah, I saw that and added it to the readme examples \u2013 loved the backgrounds! \n. Good idea, agree that this would be a useful feature. I'm not a fan of directly calling a function so I added it as an event called 'slidechanged'.\nCommit: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/commit/19b67aab1314818b71ea39323c74308c6073f52d\nDocs: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/README.md#slide-change-event\n.

Shouldn't be very hard to achieve, I'll give it a go when I have some time.\n. Re-opening. I'll give this a try sometime, though no promises that it'll work :P\n. This has been added in the dev branch. Usage: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/dev/README.md#alternating-transitions\nNote that the page/cube transitions do not work when used only on a specific slide due to their dependency on different parent perspective settings.\n. yeah, that's correct\nOn Thursday, May 2, 2013, Rob Westgeest wrote:\n\nHi,\nIs it me or does data-transition only work in 'horizontal' (top level)\nslides and not in the 'vertical' (nested) slides ?\nCan anyont confirm this..

That readme section was renamed and can be found here: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/dev/README.md#slide-transitions\n. When I try this on master data-transition is working with vertical slides. Source of the presentation I tested:\n\nhtml\n<html>\n    <head>\n        <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/reveal.css\">\n        <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/theme/black.css\">\n    </head>\n    <body>\n        <div class=\"reveal\">\n            <div class=\"slides\">\n                <section>Slides in</section>\n                <section>\n                    <section data-transition=\"fade\">Slides horizontally<br>Fades vertically</section>\n                    <section data-transition=\"fade\">Fades vertically #2</section>\n                    <section data-transition=\"fade\">Fades vertically #3</section>\n                </section>\n                <section>Slides in</section>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <script src=\"js/reveal.js\"></script>\n        <script>Reveal.initialize();</script>\n    </body>\n</html>\nIf you try the same source and it's not working, please try updating to the latest reveal.js and see if that fixes it.\n. That's an interesting challenge. It's definitely struggling to keep the slides smooth with such heavy graphics inline. I believe the best way to combat this is to only render the elements that are slowing the page down when you enter that specific slide. There are events you can listen to that reveal.js dispatches based on what the active slide is (see https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#states) and you could then activate or deactivate rendering of those objects as necessary. \n. Makes sense to wire those up, thanks. Made one small tweak; there's no need to determine how many slides there are at that point as the slide index is automatically capped at the total number of slides later on. https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/commit/eccffbe85930e8305c6c0d3afd712d32096aae7d\n. The versioning is slightly arbitrary so I'm not sure when 1.4 will be out, but it's likely to be soon.\nUnfortunately the editor has falled behind since there's been very little time to spare. Hoping to resume work on it soon and wrap up the last bits but expect its release to be dislocated from reveal.js versioning.\n. Not sure this is a good idea as the reveal.js may already have reserved the requested key for something else. It should be easy enough to go in and change it in the source if it's important to a particular presentation. Thanks for the request.\n. How would you guys feel about adding 'o' as an alternate way to toggle the overview? Would like to do this without adding a config option if possible. (Considering adding a broader config option for all key bindings so wouldn't want one special case for the overview.)\n. Okay I've updated #405 to include this. Going to specific slides can be a later enhancement.\n. Printing support was added pretty recently (#19) so you may need to update your local copy to include the print.css from master. \n. Good idea. Will try to get this in soon.\n. That's awesome. Remote controlling is a very interesting feature...\n. Unfortunately I don't a have a Win install with IE10 to test on so for this to be fixed someone will need to supply a pull request. IE9 doesn't support 3D transforms so it falls back on a much more basic mode.\n. Cool, appreciate it!\n. I used an ID since, well, there should only ever be one per page. Would you prefer rooting everything as .reveal?\nSeparately; it seems like something changed in Chrome 19's CSS 3D or transitions implementation and the default slide animation now behaves differently from what it used to (you can compare with Safari which still looks the same). I believe it's related to my chained transforms such as \"translate() rotate() translate()\" but haven't been able to find a way to work around it, any ideas?\n. Have changed the main container to use a class instead. I'm working on another project where the presentation is only a part of the page so I want to keep it rooted to avoid conflicts with the surrounding page.\nWill try to define a small testcase for transition change.\n. I'll add more variations to the main css. Right now it's only styling nested lists of the same kind (ul ul ul / ol ol ol).\n. Added some very specific styles for this. There must be a simpler way to define it..\n. Great stuff! I'll get to testing and merging this in soon.\n. What's the reasoning behind the API method for removing all event listeners?\n. Gotcha, makes sense.\n. You're welcome! What device were you testing on? It should already work on iPhone and iPad at least.\n. Right, that's a good point. I like the idea of making it more flexible in size.\n. Thanks for the feedback guys. Seeing as a lot of people are requesting this I'll make sure to get it in soon.\n. Nice, looks like an interesting talk! Added it to the examples in the readme.\n. Thanks for pointing that out. Forgot to commit the updated index.html yesterday.\n. There's no page numbers but instead there's a progress bar in the bottom of the page. That only covers horizontal slides though.\n. https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/pull/56\n. Yeah noticed this yesterday as well. It fires a second time when the hash changes (if history is enabled). Will work in a fix for this as soon as I have some time.\n. This isn't current supported but would be possible to implement. Won't have time to get to this anytime soon but will keep the issue open for later.\n. This has been added now, instructions are here: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#internal-links\nEssentially you just add an id to a section and link to it via\nhtml\n<a href=\"#my-slide-id\">link</a>\n. Hey, it looks like you're missing a # in your link, it should be:\n<section id=\"#home\">\n. Thanks for taking the time but I think I want to find a different way of implementing this. Right now it kind of conflicts with  the horizontal progress bar since that also communicates how far into the deck you are. I'd like to further improve on that progress bar instead of adding more UI.\n. Yeah that makes sense. Do you have history enabled on your presentation? That communicates the same data (i.e. /indexh/indexv).\n. Finally had a chance to try this out \u2013 works really well! Presenter notes has been a requested feature for quite some time so I'm definitely interested. My worry is that I want to keep reveal.js as minimal/simple as possible so that people with limited knowledge of JS aren't intimidated or put off. That said I might reorganize things a bit to broaden the use of the current /lib directory and keep the notes code in there to remove clutter from the top level. Also there's a JS error when running the presentation without node now since it's trying to load socket.io but that could be worked around by leaving the JS includes as a comment with instructions. \nI've started a local branch to figure out a good approach. Thanks for the pull request, really is a useful feature!\n. Thanks for the update. Haven't forgotten about merging this in but I need to find a solid stretch of time. Four more days of vacation and then I'm back at my desk :P\n. Have started working on merging this here https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/tree/notes\nThe presenter notes code, amongst other components, have been moved into /lib/. \nAlso added conditional loading of socket.io.js and the notes client.js so that the same index.html can be used with or without node running: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/notes/index.html#L321\n. Is there a better way to do this: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/notes/index.html#L323 ?\n. This isn't currently supported but I like the idea. On the to-do list.\n. There's no roadmap for this project \u2013 I'm just getting to things as I find time here and there \u2013 but I'll let you know once this has been added. Continuing after a video ends is a very specific case so that should be implemented for that particular presentation. Starting the video when the slide activates can be achieved by using the 'slidechanged' event.\n. This has been added now. You'll need to specify a millisecond value (time between auto-sliding) in the Reveal.initialize call. For example:\nReveal.initialize({\n  autoSlide: 3000, \n  loop: true\n});\n. Unfortunately there's currently no way to stop the auto-sliding programmatically so you'd need to add an API function for that as well (in the bottom of reveal.js). All you should need to do is call config.autoSlide = 0;\nNot sure how to best adjust slide forwarding to video playback but it would involved the 'slidechanged' event as well as listening for when the video ends and adjusting the autoSlide property accordingly. Unfortunately I don't have time to help out with that one.\n. Good feedback. Will adjust that soon.\nOn Jun 11, 2012, at 9:00 PM, Aram Zucker-Scharffreply@reply.github.com wrote:\n\nIn the two times I presented on projectors to a large room the code examples were both too small and too darkly colored to be visible to anyone but those in the very front row.\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/60\n.

This has been fixed here https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/commit/1f17bdd5c483cbaf9f833fff48aa186c4dd97d14\n\nControls were changed to off by default in a recent patch.\n. I can't reproduce this in Chrome 20 on OS X, is it still happening for you?\n. Thanks for taking the time to write such a complete feature. While I agree that the concept of fragments should be taken further (parallelizing in particular) I feel that what you're suggesting is too complex. It optimizes for the advanced use case and sacrifices on the common.\n. That's a great idea. I'll work in a few more API methods into the core and define a structure for modules. Thanks!\n. I don't want to force this behavior via JS as I feel it's better to let authors define their link targets in HTML. Some may want to open links in the same tab and hit backspace to return to the presentation.\n. I experimented with this while writing the original version but decided to keep it as is since the transitions look better when all slide titles are on the same vertical line. It might be difficult to add it back in now but I'll have a look and if so provide it as an option.\n. Have tried many approaches for this but the only reliable way I've come up with is to do it via JS. I have a working implementation in a local branch, will push that as soon as I've defined an easy way to toggle it on/off.\n. This feature has been added via a center boolean config option. Remains to be tested in Windows but works in Chrome/FF/Safari/Opera on OS X.\nIf you want to try it out, pull from the dev branch https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/tree/dev\nDev will be merged into master later today/tomorrow once the features that go in there have been tested more thoroughly.\n. Vertically centered slides have now been merged into master. It's available as a config option but on by default.\n. Was considering doing this but I think the use case is too narrow. If there needs to be a change based on the activated fragment, that should be done using the fragment events: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#fragment-events\n. Thanks!\n. You can accomplish this by printing to a PDF (in Chrome at least). The print styles are very basic so it won't look like the online slideshow but at least that way you can get the content out to a PDF.\nI saved the example presentation in this way, here's how it came out: http://f.cl.ly/items/3n462j131Q0o0M0P083D/reveal.pdf\n. Good catch, thanks!\n. Tried to fix this in Safari but to no avail unfortunately. Was hoping the :-webkit-full-screen pseudo selector could be used for targeting but that didn't have any effect.\n. Re-tested this and it's working in latest Chrome and Safari 6. Firefox still doesn't go complete fullscreen but I consider that an implementation error in FF \u2013 a full screen button on a video player should, um, go full screen. Not sure if the previous issue in Safari was fixed by changes to reveal.js or changes to Safari in v6. \n. Good catch, thanks!\n. This is behaving correctly for me but it may have been fixed by this recent pull request: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/commit/54e59d02d4a1903a8f159f100aa1e322866ceddd\nCould you try again with the latest reveal.js script in master and let me know if it's still happening?\n. Good find, thanks for the patch.\n. What was the use case for this? I imagined the autoSlide being used for presentations that would not be interacted with. I'm worried that preventing autoSlide when the mouse is in view may be hard to predict and leave you wondering why it dosen't move forward.\n. Thanks for explaining that. I think this is too specific of a scenario to merit adding graphics indicating pause state etc so I'll just leave it as is for now.\n. Thanks for reporting! I'm not sure what the mid-mouse key does honestly (haven't used a mouse in ages) which makes it hard to test this. If you know of a way to fix this please submit a pull request, if not I'll have to close as I am unable to do anything about it.\n. Which browser and OS was this in? I've had similar repaint issues in Chrome on OS X lately where elements have not rendered until I forced them to by interacting with them (selecting for example).\n. That'd be a bug, thanks for letting me know.\n. It would appear the body is not available for some reason. Is the reveal.js script still loaded at the bottom of the page, right before the </body>?\n. It's not described in the docs anywhere \u2013 I mostly assume people will base their presentations of the sample index page in the repo. Perhaps the docs could do with some elaboration :)\n. The JavaScript only supports one slideshow per window so if you want to have multiple slideshows running on one page you'll need to use <iframe>s.\n. The overview is bound to be pretty heavy when there's dense content (full slides, images, videos) since it transforms so many individual elements. Had a quick look at the overview code but didn't find anything to gain performance from.\n. Thanks for the pull requests today! Will check them out in more detail soon.\n. Tweaked this a bit. The event listeners serve no value in IE8 since the library only falls back on a scrolling page so there's no need to use attachEvent. Fixed up the styles too so it should look better.\n. It's possible to make it behave more like the IE9 fallback but I really want to avoid introducing code to the reveal.js core that are specific to a browser which is (slowly) dying out. Perhaps this can be done in another way:\nThere are two things blocking IE8 now; the use of addEventListener and the feature detection for transforms. I'd be interested in trying to include a polyfill like this and changing the reveal.js feature detection to only be for addEventListener and classList. Not sure if that would work but it's worth a shot.\n. IE8 support hasn't changed since this issue was closed, that is to say it should display the content in one long scrollable page. Unfortunately there are no plans for pursuing a better fallback at the moment.\n. Good catch, thanks.\n. This is very cool, thanks! Will merge this when I have some time to tweak, biggest thing I'd like to adjust is the init code in the bottom of index.html. It's getting to be more complex than I think is necessary for the common usage of reveal.js.\n. Alright this has finally been merged in. Thanks for updating the PR @davidbanham and sorry about the delay. I made a few changes, most notable I cut out the commented out code in the index file and added an example to the readme: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/tree/dev#multiplexing\nIt's currently in the dev branch but will make it's way to master soon.\n. By the way \u2013 is the notes.html file in /plugin/multiplex there by mistake?\n. Good idea to move some of this stuff to the wiki. Been meaning to update the README so I'll do that now and add links to the wiki.\n. Cool, definitely looks a lot better than Arial.\n. Good catch, just pushed a fix up.\n. Themes are now available as separate files under /css/theme/. There's only the default and beige themes there for now but this should make it easier to add more. Also merged the required parts from reset.css into main.css and shifted the print style sheets to /css/print/.\nTook more updates that I had anticipated to get this one in so I hope it hasn't introduced any new issues.\n. Closing this, version # references have been changed to 2.0. Releasing 2.0 is a separate task.\n. Thanks.\n. There's no forum for questions and unfortunately there's no plans for one. If it's only a question now and then, and it's not answered in the readme, you can submit an issue and label it 'question'. \n. Thanks for adding it to alternativeTo, just gave it a like!\n. Not sure what to use a Facebook page for but I created one, at least to reserve the name http://www.facebook.com/revealjs\n. Ever since I swapped to using a MacBook pro I gave up using a mouse in favor of the trackpad. Noticed I was faster with that and the multi-touch interactions are great.\n. Let's hold off on the logo. What's there currently is just a header treatment and not so much a logo design. I'm for having a logo but I'd like to give that a go myself when there's time.\n. Nothing actionable left here so closing. \n. Thanks for updating it, we'll get those 3 likes soon enough :)\n. Two levels of nesting won't be making it into the core as it would introduce more complexity than it would flexibility. I've had a handful of people tell me that it gets difficult keeping track of where to navigate even with only the single level of nesting and I agree with that. \nThat said, there's definitely other ways of adding more depth to an individual slide for a specific case. You could add multiple fragments (http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/14) that are stacked on top of each other via absolute positioning and reveal one of the fragments at a time. Fragments receive a .visible class and there will be multiple visible fragments at a time but you could work around that by adding a background on each fragment so that it covers the previous.\nHope that helps!\n. What browser was this on? y/g are not cut off in Chrome 21 OS X for me, tried both the :hover and normal state of the rolling links. They're inheriting line-height: 1.2em; from .reveal .slides section.\n. Nice, that's a good improvement!\n. Yeah that could be fixed by list-style-position: inside; on the <ul> but for the common case, where items aren't that long, I think it looks better with outside.\n. Added that in, seems like a good tweak.\n. Added this in. socket.io is flagged as a node dependency so it gets installed automatically when someone goes through the instructions to set that up.\n. I think I see what you're saying. It would be possible to modify the presentation to use only horizontal (not nested) slides and make each of those scrollable. Would take a good amount of CSS rewrite. For example, you'd probably want to make the sides full page width/height to avoid having to scroll within the smaller slide area. Not something for the core library unfortunately.\n. see #120\n. Great that you fixed up the unicode characters for Android. However I don't want to introduce built-in support for multiple controls. If someone wants to implement custom navigation there's API methods such as Reveal.navigatePrev() and Reveal.navigateNext(). I prefer it that way since it doesn't add complexity to the core.\n. Tried out the adjusted unicode chars and font but they make the arrows unsymmetrical in Chrome 21 OS X. The right arrow becomes noticeable thinner/less pointy than the left. I'm more concerned about accurate rendering on desktop so will keep this as is.\n. There were many occasions of spaces mixed in with tabs so I cleaned up all of the CSS files.\n. Yeah, this is bug.\n. Suppose it's probably time to introduce unit tests, been thinking about adding a build script too. Will give this some more thought. Main hesitation is quite simply that I want to keep the repo light and easy to navigate/understand for beginners.\n. Renamed from question to be actionable. Will add a test suite when there's time and integrate with the grunt.js build.\n. This has been added in to the dev branch, the tests run as part of the grunt build. More tests will be added over time.\n. I don't believe this should be more noticeable, it's secondary feature to the content and should never compete for attention. Since this is a style it would be possible to provide an alternate theme which has a taller bar though.\n. This is intended. Some events, including the ones you mentioned, use navigateNext() which navigates to the next slide regardless of it's vertical/horizontal orientation. This is useful when you want to step through an entire presentation without worrying about where the next slide is. There's also pure directional methods for navigating left/right/up/down, those are used for the keyboard arrow input.\n. The rolling links are available as an init option (https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#configuration) so moving the transforms out of the core would have unexpected results. Essentially it would mean that you can specify rollingLinks to be on but it would have no effect based on what theme you're using. It's available as an option in JS since it relies on JS to wrap anchors.\nI did move the color settings when links are rolled over to the default.css though so that they be overridden easily. \n. No worries, thanks for taking the time to write a patch.\n. Hah, alright. Thanks for pointing me to that article. Let's keep the default font in the HTML but I'll be using @import for fonts included in specific themes. Nice and easy to package it up that way. \n. I wouldn't mind having 6 or so included as long as they are diverse. Would love to do one or two myself as well but time is lacking right now.\n. Sam,\nI don't believe the font warning is really an issue. Not sure where the offset is coming from but I have a feeling this is related to your OS/GPU in combination with the CSS 3D transforms that reveal.js uses. Unfortunately I don't have anything except Mac to test on so I can't offer to look into it.\n. Closing this as I can't test/reproduce. Please let me know if you find a solution.\n. Great that you found a solution. Will close this then :)\n. You can start the presentation on a specific slide like this: http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/9\nIt's also possible to name a specific slide and link to that: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#internal-links\nIf you want to trigger the overview you can do that via JavaScript like so: Reveal.toggleOverview()\n. That's a good improvement, thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. I've had the exact same issue on many sites. Seems to be a problem with specific GPU's under OS X in Chrome. I reported the bug but it was confirmed to be fixed in an upcoming release: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=144819&thanks=144819&ts=1345910032\n. As far as I can tell this would require moving the repository, don't really want to do that as it would kill a lot of links around the interwebs.\n. Thanks!\n. Not sure why alignment would be off. Would be great if you find a solution but I can't offer to spend time on this one since it's for a very limited use case.\n. I tried FF 15 & 18 and neither had shaky page transitions/transforms. What OS was this on? I only have OS X available to test on.\n. Okay, thanks for letting me know.\n. this should be fixed by https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/pull/141\nlet me know otherwise!\n. thanks!\n. I'm not sure why that is but I'll have a look soon.\n. Hm, but if the default action is prevented doesn't it block links in the presentation?\n. Added in a preventDefault() for touchmove on Android. Can someone who was experiencing this problem give it another try? The latest update has been uploaded to http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/ so you can test there if you like.\n. Sweet, thank you!\n. Good idea, will add this in.\n. This is in master now, you can try it out here http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js\n. I assume this is an issue in Showdown (the JS Markdown parser reveal.js uses). I'll have a closer look soon.\n. After some further testing it seems that the problem is not related to showdown. Instead I believe highlight.js is having a hard time identifying the code block and detects it as HTML/XML (hence the formatting).\n. It's now possible to work around all of these parsing errors by wrapping Markdown contents in an optional <script type=\"text/template\">. Updated the instructions here: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/README.md#markdown\n. Glad to hear the presentation went well! Good feedback. I'll bump up the size a bit to make it more legible.\n. Not sure what caused this but it's not a limitation of reveal.js. Probably something to do with your local environment.\n. Keyboard shortcuts should be automatically disabled when an input element is focused. I just re-tested and it works on a standard <input type=text> but perhaps there are other cases, or browsers, where it doesn't. This is where the check is:\nhttps://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/js/reveal.js#L346\n. I'd prefer doing this without adding new UI. Perhaps by re-using the horizontal progress bar with the following improvements:\n- Add a visual slide-delimiter in the progress bar\n- Divide the progress slot for a vertical stack by the number of vertical slides and increment for each vertical navigation\n- Ideally do the same thing for fragments (divide up the progress slot and increment for each fragment)\nWhat do you guys think?\n. @aseemk I like the idea of simply counting vertical slides towards full slots in the single progress bar, will implement it that way.\n. This is working now, had to edit the showdown source a bit so will keep an eye out to make sure this doesn't lead to any new issues.\n. Haven't tried making it take up the full screen myself but it should be possible via only CSS changes. The transitions live in CSS as well so you can tweak everything there rather than modifying JavaScript. Hope it works out!\n. This one is tricky. Automatic links work in showdown but since the reveal.js Markdown lives right in the DOM the browsers attempts to fix it when the page is parsed. This fix turns the <http://example.com> link into some pseudo-HTML tag that can't be recognized by showdown.\n. Fixed by 25efef8c4f1275db62925ed18bab7282a5b767b2, see revised instructions at https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/README.md#markdown\n. If I understand what you're doing correctly, I think you should be using fragments to reveal the parts of the image on one slide. Here's an example of fragments used to reveal list items one by one: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/index.html#L253\n. The images won't stack on top of each other automatically with the fragment class but you can do that easily by adding a position: absolute; style which targets your images. \nThere was a reply to your question about full screen https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/154#issuecomment-9043443 \n. Seems like this is a conflict with the Markdown parsing. I tried your content on a page where Markdown wasn't parsed and that made it work in Chrome. Will try to fix when I find some time.\n. Found a solution for this. When reveal.js gets initialized (bottom of your HTML) there is a set of dependency scripts, the MathJax file should be loaded through that rather than as a separate <script> so that it kicks in after Markdown.\nAppend this to the dependencies:\n{ src: 'http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML', async: true }\nShould end up looking like:\n```\nReveal.initialize({\n    controls: false,\n    progress: true,\n    history: true,\ntheme: Reveal.getQueryHash().theme || 'sky', // available themes are in /css/theme\ntransition: Reveal.getQueryHash().transition || 'linear', // default/cube/page/concave/linear(2d)\n\n// Optional libraries used to extend on reveal.js\ndependencies: [\n    { src: 'lib/js/highlight.js', async: true, callback: function() { window.hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad(); } },\n    { src: 'lib/js/classList.js', condition: function() { return !document.body.classList; } },\n    { src: 'lib/js/showdown.js', condition: function() { return !!document.querySelector( '[data-markdown]' ); } },\n    { src: 'lib/js/data-markdown.js', condition: function() { return !!document.querySelector( '[data-markdown]' ); } },\n    { src: 'http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML', async: true }\n]\n\n});\n``\n. Yup, @cjsaylor's solution above is the way to go. \n. Good idea to add a none-transition. There was an easier way to achieve this though so I adjusted the implementation.\n. This has been fixed, see revised instructions at https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/README.md#markdown\n. That's an interesting idea but would required some pretty big changes. Will keep it in mind, could be really handy for quick authoring.\n. Moved a couple of styles into the .reveal container but a few global styles will remain. If you want to make use of reveal.js in your site you can adjust the html/body styles in the top of reveal.css.\n. Thanks for the pull request. I really like the feature but I think it conflicts too much with the existing overview mode. Both of them give you a scaled down overview of all slides.\n. There's a config option calledoverview` for this, set it to false and it'll be disabled.\nhttps://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#configuration\n. I'm all for adding RTL support but not knowing a RTL language makes it difficult to test.\n@linuxjuggler From what I could tell in #255, the style changes you made were to add direction: rtl definitions? I've made this available as a config option if you pull the latest from master. Try passing rtl: true where reveal.js is initialised and let me know how it works out, or rather what doesn't work.\n. Thanks for testing. I've change it so that when RTL is active, a system font is used. Also excluded pre and code elements.\nThe implementation now appends a class to the .reveal wrapper so that RTL styles can easily be added here: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/css/reveal.css#L1194\n. If anyone who writes RTL has a chance to test the feature above, and potentially add more override styles as needed, I'd appreciate it.\n. Thanks for testing again. I've added right alignment for ul/ol: http://cl.ly/image/0C1r352T0l0i (text was copied from a random site, hope it doesn't say anything weird). \nClosing this for now but please do let me know if there are any issues remaining with RTL and I'll re-open.\n. Just tried this again in Chrome 22 OS X and it's appearing for me. Even if it doesn't appear in some edge case that's okay since there's a link to the instructions on GitHub below (and the instructions there include an example).\n. Thanks for the patch!\n. Tried the first example using current master in Chrome 22 OS X and seems like it renders correctly: http://cl.ly/image/35393h0J2F0Z\n@rsgranne Can you re-test and if you still encounter it, let me know what browser?\n. closing as it doesn't seem like this one's going anywhere\n. This is really cool! It's a great demo but unfortunately I don't think it makes sense to add it to the core. You should definitely put up a live demo somewhere! :)\n. @OwenVersteeg No immediate plans for open sourcing rvl.io, we're still figuring out where we're going with it.\n. Glad you like it! If you want some persistent elements you can place them directly in the <div class=\"slides\">`` container. That's where I keep the controls and progress bar etc. \n. If you set theoverview` config option to false, pinch-to-zoom will start working.\nNote that you'll need to get update to the latest reveal.js file from the repository.\n. I don't think this is important enough to merit the addition of demo-specific JavaScript. If it is important for someone to try out a combination hopefully they are OK with writing their own query.\n. Was thinking that too so I left the old names in as aliases for now, can cut them off a few releases into the future.\n. As far as I know there aren't any reliable ways to detect when the user is zoomed. You should be able to keep navigating around using two fingers while zoomed in though.\nIf you want to modify your copy of reveal.js for this you could try wrapping the touch event handlers inside of reveal.js with if( document.documentElement.clientWidth / window.innerWidth > 1 ) { ... } although no guarantee that it'll work.\n. I tried adding the styles that @dandv suggested via the Chrome dev tools and they do make the slides take up 100% of the page height. I you might be adding the styles at a point where they are overridden by the default reveal.js styles.\nTry putting them in a new css file that is included after the reveal.css and theme CSS. If that doesn't work, you can hack it with !important.\n. I don't think slidechanged should fire for the first slide, but it'd be good to have another event which fires when reveal.has loaded.\n. There's now a 'ready' event that'll notify you when the framework and first slide is ready: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#ready-event\n. Yeah alt+click on anything to zoom, still needs a bit more refinement but you can try it on the demo page (http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js).\n. You should be able to achieve this using the API/events provided. There's a prev/next method in there which will take you to the prev/next slide \u2013 no matter which direction it's in.\n. @dandv #137 shouldn't affect this, that's just styling for the default controls. If you're OK with removing the default controls for your custom solution you should be able to do so without writing your own hooks. You'd need to mimic the class names though: a .controls container inside of .reveal, and the buttons inside of the .controls container would need to have .top/.right/.bottom/.left classes. Haven't tried it myself but in theory reveal.js should pick up on those class names and handle the event binding/navigation for you. \n. As far as I know this isn't possible, anyone else have any ideas?\n. @kapelskic Were you able to figure out a solution to this? Otherwise perhaps you can share a test case.\n. Merged #187\n. Oops, didn't notice this actually added an image dir in the root \u2013 thought it was just added to the list of served directories. Don't want to clutter the root with an empty folder so I took it out.\n. Zooming applies to the whole page so everything is equally scaled up, not matter what type of UI it is. Scroll bars not being visible when zoomed in and having a lightbox open is a very implementation specific issue so can't help there.\n. Unfortunately I don't have any plans to resolve this in the framework. It's an implementation specific issue with zooming and a lightbox plugin and therefore doesn't affect the functionality of the framework itself. Wouldn't it be reasonable to expect users to zoom back out if they have zoomed in and then tapped a link to open the lightbox?\n. I meant clicking on something, seeing that it's too large to fit in the zoom state that they themselves entered, and zooming back out to see the whole thing.\n. Also what kind of zooming are we talking about here? I assumed you meant mobile safari zooming since you were asking about that in another thread.\nOn Oct 21, 2012, at 5:34 PM, kapelskic notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nIf someone is zooming in to view specific content in a page and then they button or icon happens to be there to click for an image....why would it be reasonable they would zoom back out before clicking the icon and viewing the pieces in light box?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Right. That's a difficult issue to work around since browser-level zooming can't be controlled via JavaScript. Perhaps there's a lightbox plugin out there that's made to monitor browser zooming and adjust the size accordingly.\n. Native mobile safari zooming always affects the whole page.\n. It should zoom everything uniformly. Perhaps if there's an iframe that zooms separately since it's technically another window. Haven't tried that.\n. That's a good idea. The only advantage of running a node server that I can think of is that the notes and presentation don't necessarily need to be running in the same browser/device. \n\n@rmurphey any thoughts on this?\n. Thanks for the input. Being able to run the notes from static sites is definitely a big plus so it sounds like it makes sense to merge this. I'll try this out on a fullscreen presentation to see how it fares.\n. Yeah the only browser in OS X that does full screen well on dual monitors is Safari, Chrome and FF both clear the non-full screen monitor. I decided the leave the node-based notes in there for now but they are no longer included by default in the demo presentation.\nThe new notes system has been documented here: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#speaker-notes\n- The notes window is opened by appending ?notes to the query or pressing the s key.\n- Fixed and old issue where notes would not be in sync when first opened.\n- Navigation now goes both ways, i.e. navigating within the notes window reflects in the main presentation to ensure that everything stays in sync. Would love thoughts on if this makes sense.\n. They're very similar so I doubt you'll have a problem using Sass if you know LESS. I've moved forward with this and the migration is almost complete. \n. This is a really cool concept. I have an idea for how the implementation could be made simpler, will try that out soon.\n. Just implemented this. There's now a set of fragment styles that can be used by appending an additional class to the fragments, like:\n<p class=\"fragment grow\">Growing text</p>\nThere's a new demo slide for this at http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/16/1\n. Yeah, I liked the idea of different styles of fragments but not the part where a flow of fragments is scripted with hidden dom elements. It's possible to repeat different fragments on the same visual element by nesting, like:\n<p class=\"fragment fade-in\">\n  <span class=\"fragment fade-out\">First fades in, then out</span>\n</p>\n. That flexibility is certainly lost in what I implemented but I wonder if it's a common case. Most presentations flow from left-to-right/top-to-bottom so the markup should already reflect that natural order. I'm sure there are exceptions to this but I want to try and provide easy to use solutions for the common case.\n. Good catch, it's definitely a problem that you can't see the fragments. Haven't tried this yet but I assume it steps forward the notes by one fragment at a time? I would prefer having the notes always show the complete slide (all fragments) directly. The notes plugin will be seeing quite a big update as part of #190 so I might work this in at the same time.\n. I'm sold, it makes more sense to step fragment-by-fragment.\n. They could be related, won't know for sure until I've had time to debug this one.\n. This is fixed and working in Chrome + Firefox. Essentially Chrome doesn't re-render when the scaled up element contains other transformed elements so I forced them off. Safari still exhibits the same issue, not sure if there's some random way of forcing it to re-render too.\n. Was fixed a few days ago (551c783b7241760594a31e286822ee5643ecc0e6), update to the latest reveal.js file from the repo.\n. You'll need to update all of the reveal files including JS & CSS. There's been some significant changes to how presentations are scaled so it won't work by just updating the JS.\n. Scrolling is disabled in all browsers by this rule https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/css/reveal.css#L52\nIf enabled, you will most likely see scroll bars appear in undesirable places due to things like the vertical slides.\n. Right, you've convinced me that it could be useful to have reveal.js pick up elements with specific class names (.navigate-right, .navigate-down etc.) and automatically bind click listeners on those. Especially for having elements inside of a slide that takes you to the next slide. I'll re-open #184. \nThat said, I don't think it should be possible to append vertical slides after linking to a unique ID. If you're trying to link to a specific slide using a named link it would be better to name the slide you actually want to link to.\n. Thanks for this! Tweaked it a bit to make the arrow proportions similar to their unicode predecessors.\n. That's strange, the keyboard shortcuts haven't changed recently. And the other keyboard controls (arrows) work?\n. Uh-oh, are you seeing any JS errors in the dev tools?\n. Tried to debug this morning but my VM was screwy so couldn't get IE started. Will try it again tonight or tomorrow.\n. IE9 is stopped by the check for a focused element here: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/js/reveal.js#L1093\nThe check is supposed to be in place to prevent reveal.js keyboard shortcuts from firing when another editable element  is focused.\n. Change the <span class='fragment'> into a block-level element, like <div class='fragment'> and it'll work\n. Thanks for this. I think we have slightly different views on how this should be implemented. I'd like to have less expectations on the HTML/CSS for a custom control. Was thinking we could use classes (.navigate-left, .navigate-right, .navigate-up, .navigate-down, .navigate-next, .navigate-prev) which can be attached to any type of element and then automatically have reveal.js monitor them. That way it would be easy to for example add a single class to the arrow images in the demo presentation to bind navigations whilst leaving the style up to the presentation author. This single implementation could be used for the the \"real\" reveal.js controls and custom controls. What do you think? \n. Went ahead and added this: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#internal-links\n. I don't have a 2.3 device to test on so won't be able to fix this myself. Will leave it open for a while in case someone else and supply a fix.\n. Thanks, that's useful!\n. Tried http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/?theme=beige in the emulator and it works for me. Can you re-test?\n. Tested with a few other themes too with no issues, closing.\n. Alright this has been merged in. I'm OK with dropping the backwards sync (notes > main presentation) for now but will try to add that in later. It's not an important feature but I do think that the two windows should always stay in sync, no matter which of them changes.\n. Just re-tested current master in Chrome 22 and Firefox 17 on OS X and they're both working for me. Not sure what the difference is in our setups\n. You're right \u2013 just tested opening the file directly from the filesystem and the notes appear when I navigate to the second slide but the slides in the notes window aren't progressing.\n. I'm not sure \u2013 not that familiar with it either\n. Been searching for answers to this and it seems that there are security limitations which prevent this (accessing the window object of an iframe that's loaded from the local filesystem)  from working. Closing.\n. This was briefly covered in the readme under the installation section, I've amended it to specifically mention speaker notes as an example of things that do not work without a web server: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#installation\n. The speaker view plugin now works when running directly from the local file system (tested in OS X Chrome/FF/Safari). I rewrote it to work entirely via window.postMessage (5b18c1f308523527566cefc85414170e922bc4a2, 3795ef1599cae8debe161c13a530ad565a767291). Also updated the style to match the Slides speaker view which makes better use of available screen space.\nOnly available in the dev branch so far.\n. The ready event is firing in your example, but it fires before you add the listener. I've added a workaround for this since I guess it's a common thing to do.\n. Good idea, added this in!\n. Not something I'd like to work into the project. I can see the need for perhaps tracking navigations to each slide but that would be relatively easy by hooking onto the slidechanged event.\n. The slideChanged event can be used for this, the event object holds references to the previousSlide (the slide you just left) and currentSlide.\n. It fires right after the transition starts during the same execution cycle though \u2013 if you wanted to trigger a sound when leaving a slide it should be identical to having the event a few lines further up. \n. This has been fixed.\n. Not sure exactly what's wrong but certainly sounds like a bug in the print stylesheet.\n. Been trying to replicate this with the demo presentation but no luck. Any chance you can isolate a case where this can be reproduced? \n. Thanks for the test case, seems like the issue was with vertical slides. Should be fixed in master.\n. Thanks for reporting this. This is actually not the repository for rvl.io, we have a separate private repository for that and I've tracked the issue there already.\n. Thanks for pointing that out. I've pushed a fix to master.\nPDF's are printed with solid colors since I haven't found a way to apply the gradient per page. But at least now it will be the right solid color from the theme.\n. Hah, thanks man :)\n. I've merged in the postmessage plugin from @sithmel which provides this functionality.\n. It's not possible to change what reveal.js writes to the hash (it's always the slide index) but you can add named links by adding id attributes on specific slides: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#internal-links\n. #224 will make it possible to write named links to the URL\n. Thanks for this!\n. This is happening since the markdown parser wraps the contents (\"quote box\") of the blockquote with a p which is block-level. Implemented a workaround but it's not perfect since it causes unexpected inlining of paragraphs if there ar exactly two paragraphs in a block quote.\n. Seems like MathJax is struggling to position itself correctly, probably a conflict with all of transforms that happen in reveal.js. You can fix this by adding the following snippet below the Reveal.initialize call:\njavascript\nReveal.addEventListener( 'slidechanged', function( event ) {\n    MathJax.Hub.Rerender();\n} );\n. Good idea, I've added this to the readme.\n. Hey, not sure why that would happen but I imagine it might just be a local issue. Can you try restarting the browser, or even a different browser to see if it's the same there?\n. see https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/pull/228#issuecomment-10261098\n. Thanks for the pull request but I don't think fragments belong in the URL/browser history since they're too granular.\n. Presentz looks like a really cool service. The only way you can step through fragments currently is by using the navigation methods (Reveal.next()) through the postmessage plugin that was added yesterday, see https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/plugin/postmessage/example.html.\nLooking at your commit perhaps parts of it can be merged in to address this. I'm not opposed to adding a third fragment argument to the slide method, the part I do not like is writing it to the URL.\n. Okay, great. Reopening this and will merge in the third slide() argument.\n. Hey,\nYou could use the HTML5 Application Cache to make the presentation available as well as other pages available when offline. Note that this only works when first visiting the site online and then opening the page again when offline.\nhttp://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/appcache/beginner/\n. Works for me when testing at http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js in Chrome 23.0.1271.64 OS X\n\n. This is happening in my Chrome now too. Not sure what's different from when I tested last night.\n. The problem with missing italics only occurs when using custom fonts, when it's set to a system font it works. It also works if the slide with the italic font is visible upon printing... Will keep investigating. \n. Was able to find a workaround for this by forcibly adding a hidden italic font as a pseudo element. See the commit above.\n. That's cool, thanks. Started collecting reveal.js resources in the wiki https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Resources\n. yw!\n. Since this is unrelated to reveal.js it'd be better to file an issue with the guys at HTML5Rocks https://github.com/html5rocks/www.html5rocks.com/issues\n. Not sure how to improve on this \u2013 any ideas for changes to the print styles?\n. Thanks for the input guys. Closing this as there's no action to be taken.\n. I believe this was fixed a while ago. Tested with your slides in my local copy of current master and it works there.\n. Closing. I can't maintain Window Phone support without a real device to test on. If either of you can supply a fix I'll merge it in though.\n. An option to make slides consume the full page width/height would be nice, will see what I can do. What do you mean by \"Native support for iframes that all themes can inherit\"?\n. Gotcha, thanks for clarifying.\n. Okay, just to narrow this issue down. The goal is to add a helper class that fits a single element into the full size of its slide parent. It's essentially width: 100%; height: 100%;, but when applied to images it will only scale the image as far as aspect ratio allows (i.e. fit inside). Is that what everyone had in mind?\n. Starting to question the point of this. What would a \"fit\" class achieve that can't already be done using relative width/height units? Images can be scaled while maintaining aspect ratio using the same approach as long as the aspect ratio of the image is known. Perhaps it would simply be handy to have a fit (100% width & height) class to have to define your own?\n. There's now a helper class for dynamically stretching an element to consume the space within a slide. More details here https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/561#issuecomment-22837639\n. The class causes an element to stretch to fit the total height of it's container slide after subtracting the combined height of all siblings. Applying it to a nested element would make it difficult to measure that remaining height since the code would need to step through the parent chain and take into account the margins and paddings of each parent to determine how large that innermost element can grow. I'm afraid that would produce many unexpected errors.\n. Bit torn on this, I don't want anyone to use the theme config option since it's better to sub out the <link> directly to avoid initial flicker. The only reason it's still in there is because of the demo presentation links to different themes.\n. Added a section about theming in the README. It intentionally doesn't mention theming param since I am planning on getting rid of that once I have time to make some updates to the demo page.\nhttps://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#theming\n. Tried this on the current release version of Firefox for OSX with Firebug installed and zooming worked when I alt+clicked. Perhaps it differs based on OS?\n. I've tested this and can not replicate. Please re-test at http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/?transition=concave and let me know if it's still occurring, if so let me know what browser and OS.\n. dupe\n. Good find, this has been fixed.\n. see #166\n. The dependencies for server side notes are no longer included in the HTML by default. This was changed when the client side notes were added. If you want to run the server side notes make sure to copy over the two dependencies from here: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#server-side-speaker-nodes\n. The presentation you linked works for me on my iPhone 4. Have not experienced crashes but I'm sure it's possible depending on the content of the presentation, lots of iframes for example.\n. WebGL should have no effect on the presentation but perhaps ignoring GPU blacklist does. Without the flag, do you still see the 3D transforms in the transitions?\n. Okay, so your browser probably falls back on software rendering without that flag based on your system/GPU. This is a general browser thing and doesn't directly have anything to do with the framework. Would be interesting to have an idea about how frequently people are affected by this but I guess it's hard to find info on that.\n. I've added a note about it here https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Browser-Support\nThanks for reporting and testing!\n. Seems like CSS 3D transforms aren't working at all for you, please try going to this page and hover over the thumbnails: http://lab.hakim.se/kort/\nYou should be seeing what's in this image http://s3.amazonaws.com/hakim-static/portfolio/images/kort.jpg\n. It seems another user is having a similar problem (#258), can you try running Chrome with --ignore-gpu-blacklist?\n. I believe the same applies to Chrome as well, try:\nopen /Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app --args --ignore-gpu-blacklist\n. I assume you're referring to the HTML editor issue in rvl.io? There's an issue filed for that already but the project lives in a private repository.\nGonna close this as I think this is a problem with your setup (OS/GPU) which I can't work around.\n. Slides that are three or more steps away are instantly hidden to improve on performance. If you want to, you can disabled this by commenting out the following: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/js/reveal.js#L916\n. The info here is outdated. Try configuring reveal.js with a higher viewDistance instead (it defaults to 3).\njavascript\nReveal.initialize({ viewDistance: 100 });\n. It's two separate files \u2013 markdown.js and showdown.js. Showndown is the JS parser library for Markdown, and markdown.js is a wrapper for reveal.js which picks up the data-markdown attributes and runs Showdown.\n. Just tested this in a presentation with only vertical slides and it looped correctly. Please download the latest reveal.js and test again, if it does happen again please send me the HTML that was used. \n. Opera doesn't support 3D transforms so the ESC-button overview mode won't work. \n. Hey,\nThere isn't any easy way to do this due to how reveal.js transitions work. The easiest way I can think to hack in a custom transition would be to simply override the styles of the specific sections. \nhtml\n<section class=\"my-custom-transition\"></section>\nThese are the three classes that are used to form transitions and where you'd need to override transforms/opacity.\njavascript\nsection.my-custom-transition.past {...}\nsection.my-custom-transition.preset {...}\nsection.my-custom-transition.future {...}\n. This is most likely a conflict with reveal.js' touch event handling. Essentially reveal.js captures all swipe gestures for slide navigation and prevents their default action. If this is the issue the fix should be to add a condition to the touch event handlers that makes them ignore touch actions where the event target has scroll-able overflow.\n. I've tried a few times but not been able to find a workaround for this, closing.\n. The method which converts elements to rolling links in reveal.js reads all of the text content of the original node and hence disregards what styles you had applied to the nested text. This happens here https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/js/reveal.js#L494 (it's the data-title=node.text bit that defines what appears on rollover)\nBest workaround I can think of would be to update that method to never convert anything that has a child node into a rolling link.\n. That could lead to unexpected loss of information if b/i/em/strong etc tags\nare used.\nOn Thursday, December 27, 2012, Dan Dascalescu wrote:\n\nHow about stripping the HTML tags and getting only the text contents?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/266#issuecomment-11722930.\n. Were you able to work this out somehow? I don't believe it's possible to reliably read the position of an element that's not displayed so the only thing I can think of is what you already wrote \u2013 use the slidechanged event. The images should zoom because of their sizes changing, unless there's a broad transition: all applied to them.\n. I'm not sure I think the concept of a master slide lends itself well to the web-based nature of reveal.js. Perhaps I'm missing something, could you elaborate on what you think a master slide would add to the framework and how it would be used?\n. Hi Zach,\n\nThanks for the detailed answer. I understand what you mean but I do believe that content layout should be up to each individual author to set up based on their needs. There are so many different layouts the authors may want and I'd rather not try to predict/implement those in the framework itself. No matter how many layouts the framework would come with, there would always be requests for more and I'm afraid it would quickly grow out of control. \n. Thanks for reporting. Gave this a try with the following markup on my last slide and the fragments worked.\n<section>\n    <h1>THE END</h1>\n    <h3>BY Hakim El Hattab / hakim.se</h3>\n    <ol>\n        <li class=\"fragment\"><code>any type</code></li>\n        <li class=\"fragment\"><em>of view</em></li>\n        <li class=\"fragment\"><strong>fragments</strong></li>\n    </ol>\n</section>\nIs there anything else that stands out about that slide or its contents? Also compare the versions of your local reveal.js copy and the latest in master \u2013 perhaps it's an issue that's already been patched.\n. Printing of background images wasn't enabled since it caused the default gradient backgrounds to render badly. I've fixed this so you can now print presentations including background images.\nThough it might not work very well in your presentation since it relies on state classes (JavaScript controlled) to change between slides.\n. I was unable to figure out a way to repeat the gradient per-page (it stretched over the entire document height instead) so I left it as a solid color. If you want to give it a go feel free too, and I'll re-open. \n. Not sure what's happening there, there are only two ways to trigger the auto-advance mode. Do either of the following apply to your presentation?\n1. Passing in an autoSlide value to the Reveal.initialize() method.\n2. Specifying a data-autoslide attribute on any given <section> element. \n. ID's should not make slides auto-advance so if they are, that's a bug. I'm\naway travelling right now and don't have access to a computer but will test\nin a few days.\nOn Sunday, December 30, 2012, unnamedcrewman wrote:\n\nThanks a lot for the answer. I have not made either of the changes that\nyou have suggested. However, in doing some further checking, I've narrowed\nthe problem to something else.

Any\nnested slides that have an ID automatically advance, and any slides without\nan ID function as normal.

Thanks for looking into it further. The issue has been fixed. Sections with ID's are added to the URL as \"named links\", but internally those names are still converted to numerical indices. That conversion process got offset by one vertically since there was an extra element in the stacks .children list (the h1). That's what lead to the automated auto-advance.\n. I'm not able to test on that system so can't offer to fix this. Can you try adding position: relative; to all <a>'s and see if that helps?\n. Cool, thanks. I'll make sure to add that in to the repo.\n. Can't think of a way to do this. Fragments rely on classes which as far as I know can't be defined using Markdown.\n. Thanks for this, merged it in and made a few small changes (moved it to /plugin/print-pdf).\n. The background and drop shadow are set using :before and :after pseudo elements here https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/css/reveal.css#L795\n\nI had the same flicker issue and the only workaround I could find was the above. You can override those styles if you want to change the background.\n. Thans for the fix @aseemk ! Tested and merged.\n. @gravis Just to exclude the possibility, can you try clearing your cache? I had a problem with the notes window cache not clearing when I last worked on it.\n. Nevermind. I'm seeing this too.\n. I made the same mistake when testing, added an error message in the notes window now when not running on a web server. Also fixed the initial upcoming slide which was no longer being selected due to the iframes loading after the window.\n. There's no way of making the transition continuously proceed in one direction and unfortunately this won't be added as a feature. reveal.js uses a very straight forward class-based transition setup and I don't want to risk making that any more complex.\n. Heya. Never used Travis-CI before \u2013 I'm probably missing something, but what's the benefit of this considering reveal.js doesn't have any unit tests to validate?\n. Thanks for the info, makes sense if it lints the code. And ideally I'll add tests at some point so those can be ran too.\n. The Travis hook has been set up and is working. Thanks for the PR!\n. Doesn't sound like this is an error in reveal.js code, closing.\n. Good call, thanks.\n. Great fix, thanks for the patch \u2013 it has been merged into master.\n. Hey guys. Agree that it would make sense for the home key to reset vertical stacks. Though am I right that the config option in pull request resets stacks at all times, rather than just when the home key is pressed? \nI would love to avoid a new config option for this and lock down one implementation.\nFYI: The reason the framework currently memorizes the selected vertical slide when returning to a stack is to make navigation more predictable. If you navigate back one step you'd expect the slide you were previously on to be there and that wouldn't be the case were it not for the memorized vertical index. Perhaps one option would be to reset the memorized index for all slides that are more than 1 (horizontal) slides away from the current?\n. The pull request for has been merged in, vertical stacks now reset when returning to the first slide.\n. The page down key invokes navigateNext rather than navigateDown, which means that when it hits the last vertical slide in a stack it will navigate to the next horizontal slide and so forth until the presentation ends. If memory serves me right page down was bound to navigate next since that's the signal that some presentation remotes send and the expected behavior then is to go through all slides.\nWhen you hit the absolute last slide, even if it is vertical, page down doesn't do anything.\n. You can use .navigate-next and .navigate-prev to step through all slides including vertical. If that isn't working make sure you're using the latest version of reveal.js. I just tested it in my local copy and they work there.\nhtml\n<a href=\"#\" class=\"navigate-prev\">\n<a href=\"#\" class=\"navigate-next\">\n. Oh, you're trying to make the whole presentation left-to-right? Did you try swapping the contents of navigateNext/navigatePrev as well as the navigateLeft/navigateRight methods? I've never attempted this so don't know if it will work.\n. This should be fixed by #310, once that's implemented.\n. Good find, thanks for reporting.\n. Thanks!\n. This repository is only for reveal.js, I saw that you've correctly posted this to the rvl.io forum as well so I'll be closing this.\nProblem 2 is a feature on our to-do list. It's currently not possible to re-arrange slides using the editor.\n. You can use the config option keyboard: false to disabled all keyboard navigation. There is currently no way to disable touch events but I could see some use for that so will keep this open.\n. Opened a new issue specifically for a touch config option #299\n. Can you explain this in more detail please? Removing slides from the DOM should be OK. Are you using loop? Is that's what's breaking?\n. You can call Reveal.navigateTo(); to forcibly update the progress bar and control arrows. Everything else should work, that's how I do it in rvl.io.\n. IE has a different set of touch events, details: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/09/20/touch-input-for-ie10-and-metro-style-apps.aspx\nI don't have a device to test this on so can't fix. If you're able to put together a pull request that'd be great though.\n. Cool, hopefully it's just a matter of adding another set of listeners next to the current touch events. https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/js/reveal.js#L361\n. Ugh, by the sounds of it then it's gonna make quite a mess in the code :/ Perhaps it would be best to only support swiping using IE pointers, rather than pursuing the more complicated pinch gesture.\n. Thanks for the insight @OwenVersteeg! Hope that works out.\n. I gave this a shot in the dev branch. Essentially listening to pointer events and \u2013 if they are of touch type \u2013 convert them to the normal style of touch events. I don't have the hardware to test on but perhaps someone else can give it a go. If it works it should enable normal swipe events but not the overview-pinch.\n. Boo, well was worth a try.\n. Thanks for testing!\n. See #450 \n. thanks!\n. thanks\n. This is really neat! Great to see a sample implementation of a uniformly scaling presentation too. What do you think about wrapping it up as a plugin and submitting a pull request? \n. Agree that it makes sense to wait for #310 before doing this. I'd prefer keeping this as a separate plugin page rather than directly integrating with the reveal.js core CSS/JS \u2013 just like you implemented it in your version. It can be stored in /plugins and if someone wants to use it they can either point their browser to the plugins folder or move the HTML from there to the project root. Worth giving some more thought, but like I said I'd prefer not making any significant changes to the core for a feature that the majority may not use.\n. Just added the ability to share a presentation with notes visible! This can be turned on by setting the showNotes config value to true. Only available in the dev branch so far but will be released in 3.2.0.\nTime to close the oldest open feature request :D\n\n. I can see the reason for exposing this via the API, but why is the method aliased as resize rather than layout like it's called internally? \n. I like this idea and am also in favor of using horizontal lines to delimit since they are more explicit than newlines. Ideally this feature can be built into the markdown plugin, rather than reveal.js itself. \nUsing a section to specify what markdown file to load is a bit confusing. It makes it seem like it will only load markdown content into that specific slide, rather than replace it with any number of slides. Perhaps it'd be better to use a different element that doesn't have any significance in terms of reveal.js structure?\n. This has been merged.\n. Thanks, I merged this in but shortened the readme section a bit. Wasn't able to get the clojure sample to work with the language explicitly defined (through class attr) but it worked when I let highlight.js pick and chose. \n. Scaling and overflowing content is probably one of the biggest problems with reveal.js at the moment. I'm open to trying a fixed-resolution/aspect ratio (say 960x600) that the framework always keeps in the viewport through scaling. Though I don't want to do this as a plugin, I think it's a fundamental problem of the framework and should be improved on in the core. \nThe part that I do like about the current implementation is that content can flow freely to best suit the display. But I suppose, from an authors perspective, it's more important that content looks the exact same as it was authored.\n. Replaced by #310 \n. A first implementation of this is available in the dev branch. It currently uses zoom to scale the .slides container since CSS transforms led to content being blurry. Has only been tested in Chrome so far.\n. Pushed some further improvements. Looks good on Chrome/FF OS X. iOS has a few quirks to work out.\n. The 'padding' config option was badly named, it's a margin and has been renamed accordingly. I want that to be there by default rather than a padding inside since that doesn't work with most of the transitions. Though if you wanted a 100% fit with padding inside you could specify margin: 0 in the config and define your own padding in CSS. \n. This feature is now complete in the dev branch. Would love help with testing on different setups and devices if anyone has some time to spare. Especially IE9-10 and Android.\n@aseemk Variable sizes on different slides in the same presentation would break the transitions. The sections themselves are sized at 100% at all times now, it's the .slides container that gets set to the configured with/height and then scaled. I prefer keeping it in JS since it lives next to a few other config options that affect scaling. With the new implementation you can at least configure width/height to 100% if you want the entire presentation to always cover the whole browser window.\n. Tried IE9 and IE10 briefly and both seem OK.\n. This has been merged into master (reveal.js v2.3). Has not been tested very thoroughly but hopefully it will be now.\n. No plans \u2013 I know next to nothing about Drupal. Maybe someone else is interested?\n. Glad to hear it. \nClosing this now since there's no work to be done on reveal.js for it.\n. There is no config option for this so you'll need to edit the JS and comment out the following: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/js/reveal.js#L394\n. You can pass progress: false and hide the progress bar altogether, or add a custom style with .progress { pointer-events: none; }.\n. Hm, not sure how to work around that except manually updating the pointer to the notes here https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/plugin/notes/notes.js#L8\nDo you have any ideas?\nNice to see you're using reveal for your meetup btw :)\n. This should be fixed by PR #327 \n. Great addition. Merged it in and tweaked it so that the time doesn't appear until the window has loaded and the time is set.\n. Not sure I understand how your set-up works, but could you not detach and re-attach the slides from the DOM instead of updating their styles? You can call Reveal.slide() after removing/adding a slide to update the navigation state (controls, progress bar etc).\n. You should replace the stylesheet in the <head> instead, this is covered here: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#theming\nJS loading of themes is only there since it's used in the demo slides to show off themes but will be removed at some point.\n. Thanks for the feedback. As you pointed out in the edit, this is the same feature as #244 so I'll close this as a dupe.\n. Thanks for the feedback. Unfortunately there are no plans on changing this, it's intended that you step through the whole presentation and fragments are a part of that flow.\n. Good catch. Adjusted and looks like hyphenation is working in FF now. Please test if you can and let me know if you notice anything wrong.\n. Thanks, good catch. Will merge this in soon.\n. It's in master\n. Sure, if you make the index a php file you can use php in there however you want.\n. This still works as long as your presentation isn't set to be vertically centered. You can go back to the old top-aligned mode by passing center: false to Reveal.initialize({ ... }).\n. You're right \u2013 window.open() returns a null reference when deferred by Firefox's popup blocker. Don't know how that can be worked around.\n. Anyone want to try to fix this? I've had little success.\n. I checked last night in Chrome but window.opener is null in the popup when\nopening notes through appending ?notes to the end of the presentation URL.\nPlease give it a go if you can.\nOn Tuesday, April 30, 2013, jdittrich wrote:\n\nDid you try it with the idea in my previous comment?\n''As the popup window does have an attribute referring to the opening\nwindow, and thus access to it, one could make appending the events a setup\ntask as soon as the popup opens.''\nI think I once sort of hacked it in, and it did work.

That shouldn't get popup block and so this isn't relevant any longer.\n. Great improvement, thanks. I updated the selector as well.\n. Can you submit a pull request with better fallback fonts? Arabic is covered by the rtl config option which also picks a different font but would be great to have better fallbacks for other languages.\n. Thanks for the PR. This has been merged into the dev branch. I moved the example files into the markdown plugin folder to try and keep the root level slim. Also added a note about how to point to external markdown in the readme.\n. Yeah, that would definitely be possible. You'd need to listen for the `slidechanged event, load a buffer of content via XHR and append it to the DOM. You may also need to call Reveal.slide() after appending the new content to make sure reveal is in sync with the current DOM. \n\nNot something I'd like to add to the core framework though so I'm closing this.\n. Thanks, this has been merged in. Modified it a bit as there was an issue with detecting the last slide if the presentation had any vertical slides in it.\n. Nice work, the functionality looks solid. \nIs this pull request missing its styles? I see a failed attempt to load /css/theme/assets/searchicon.png when I run reveal.js with the plugin enabled. Perhaps you could base64 embed the search icon to keep it all neatly packaged under the plugin.\n. There's no way of doing this with the auto-slide attribute and since it's not a very common case I don't think it merits changing the implementation.\nYour best option would be to not use fragments and rather listen to 'slidechanged' to determine when the slide in question is opened and cycle through elements using your own JS.\n. Didn't know about that, thanks for the fix.\n. That's okay, I pushed an updated minified file right after merging.\n. This is great \u2013 nice work. I'll merge it in soon.\n. I have copied over the changes from your branch @IlanFrumer \u2013 it's only available in the dev branch so far but definitely feel free to test it. Good to have better RTL support in!\n. Thanks for the PR, authors using reveal.js should be savvy enough to add their own external styles \u2013 if they aren't they should be using rvl.io instead \u2013 so unfortunately I won't merge this.\n. That plugin is set to load asynchronously in the Reveal.initialize config \u2013 try setting async to false. \n. Thanks! I've merged this into the dev branch. I changed the attribute to be a data-attribute and went for index instead of pos since it's more aligned with reveal.js' language.\n. Thanks, that's a great improvement. Unfortunately I wasn't able to get the margin: 0 setting to work \u2013 Chrome still kept it's original print margin setting.\n. It does automatically set the orientation now, so it's only the margin bit\nthat's not working for me.

Has been merged into the dev branch.\n. oops, thanks for correcting that\n. merged into dev, thanks\n. do you what it is that conflicts with the 'stack' attribute there? the method is only called internally in two places and should always be passed direct DOM element references, curious about how it would have turned into a function\n. There's actually a config property available for this already, there's short description of it in the readme:\njavascript\n...\n// Number of milliseconds between automatically proceeding to the \n// next slide, disabled when set to 0, this value can be overwritten\n// by using a data-autoslide attribute on your slides\nautoSlide: 0,\n...\nI also just pushed an update to the dev branch which lets adjust auto-sliding at runtime via:\njavascript\nReveal.configure( { autoSlide: 0 } ); // off\nReveal.configure( { autoSlide: 10000 } ); // on\n. There's a separate config value you'll need to enable for that: loop: true. If you're on the dev branch I just pushed a small fix to that.\n. I can scroll all the way down to the bottom comments in the example you linked so I assume you were able to work this out?\n. GH actually dropped the static file uploads/downloads a while ago.\nI have some ideas for how to improve on this involving a long overdue dedicated site and domain for the project. There's a lot going on right now though so will take me a while to get to.\n. Bought revealjs.com \u2013 the plan is to build a page there with better setup instructions and migrate the demo from lab.hakim.se/reveal-js. For now it's just a GH page.\n. Still hoping to build out revealjs.com sometime \u2013 but in the meantime I've added installation instructions to the readme. They're linked from the top so hopefully easy enough to find: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#installation\n. works for me in v27 Canary OS X\n. Sure, you can use http://remotes.io/ for that. It's in the default reveal.js index.html, just comment this line out https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/index.html#L371\n. Merged into the dev branch, thanks!\n. I don't want to add that to the core since I don't believe it's useful to many. You could achieve the same thing by adding .fragment HTML elements that are invisible and listening to the fragment events.\n. The npm install should have installed express for you locally, did you set it up in another way? \n. Gotcha. Well the recommended way of installation is to use npm install which automatically resolves all the dependencies, without any separate downloads or installs.\n. Fixed in the dev branch.\n. Has been merged into dev, thanks.\n. Seems like there's no '.reveal' element on the page when Reveal.initialize() is called. Can you check that the markup you're using is correct (.reveal wrapper div with .slides child)? Also double-check that initialize is called when the markup is on page.\n. Can you view the source of the page in question and copy everything (including CSS/JS includes and markup) into a comment here?\n. Which version of reveal.js are you using (should say in the header of the reveal.js file)?\nI see that your markup is <div id=\" reveal\"> whereas in the current version of reveal a class is used <div class=\"reveal\">. \n. I would recommend getting the latest version of reveal.js from https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/tags and update your Reveal.initialize({...}) call to match the current config format: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/index.html#L351\n. Great, glad it worked out.\n. This is a known issue in rvl. All markup is whitelisted on the server to strip malicious code. Unfortunately the module in use only covers the HTML spec, not SVG. There's already a fix in the v2 editor but that's still a few weeks away from release.\n. see #371 \n. The navigatePrev() method calls slide() with no arguments since it updates the indices right before that. It's special cased like that since it needs to go the last vertical slide when stepping backwards and arriving on a stack.\nUnfortunately I won't be merging in shift+arrow key support. It's always a tough tradeoff but I don't think this will be a commonly used feature and merits the amount of code added.\n. Sorry but I don't think this should be added as a plugin either. If the presenter needs to go back to a specific slide quickly they should use the overview mode, which allows them to skip fragments and see multiple slides at a time.\n. Yeah, that's a good addition to the API. I'm making some changes now, will add it in.\n. That's been added to the dev branch.\n. Would be a bit challenging since the slides don't use up the full window size but could definitely be done using some positioning magic, perhaps even JS to position it.\n. I just tested this by cloning a clean version of the repo, running npm install`` and thengrunt``` and there were no errors. Assuming this is an env based error, unfortunately I can't offer any help on this but if you can debug and submit a fix please do.\n. Didn't know that existed, thanks for sharing. Unfortunately it's not something I'm interested in adding to reveal.js since it requires jQuery. Also, going through all text using JS scares me in terms of perf, particularly for big presentations.\n. Fixed in dev branch.\n.

There's a few features that require the presentation to be running through a web server so it needs to be messaged more broadly rather than specifically for external markdown. Will make sure this is covered as the recommended setup for the whole framework as part of #357 \n. Nice, merged this into dev.\n. I saw the same error after seeing your report and giving it a try. Oddly enough I'm no longer experiencing this and it works as expected when I try again. Can you give it a try? Perhaps this is the same as #326 \n. @nalmeida Were you running the presentation on a local webserver or directly through file://?\n. Okay, when does it not work?\n. Ah, I forgot that even existed! I've taken it out of the readme so that everyone opens the notes window via the \"s\" key.\n. Good catch. I'll drop the protocol.\n. Protocol-relative font paths turned out to be a bad idea since it loads from file:// when running without a webserver. Need to change the paths to always be https:// instead.\n. This should already be fixed in the dev branch through the addition of this method: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/dev/js/reveal.js#L402 which resets and re-runs the event binding after the config has changed. #384 is still an issue though\n. they're set in css here https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/css/reveal.css#L567\n. Will do something towards this in #392\n\nOn Thursday, March 28, 2013, ubun2 wrote:\n\nis it a good idea to make it as a config option so it would be easier to\nchange?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/386#issuecomment-15614828\n.\n.

Can be easily be added for HTML video/audio. Not sure about iframed Youtube/Vimeo.\n. I've added this in for HTML audio/video and YouTube, feel free to test it in the dev branch. \n- Media is automatically paused when a slide is hidden\n- Media automatically starts playing if data-autoplay is set on the element\n- Nothing is done if data-ignore is found on the element\n. Updated the readme to include info on this https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/dev/README.md#embedded-media\n. Can you paste the full HTML source of the page where this happens? Or if it's online that would be even better.\n. You need to make sure the reveal.js file has loaded before your external script runs. You can use a script loader like the one reveal.js uses internally for this: http://headjs.com/. \n\nThis isn't an issue with the reveal.js framework so closing.\n. I left this open for a while hoping someone would be able to answer but no luck. I haven't used any USB remotes myself so unfortunately I can't recommend any.\n. someone recommended one in #445 \n. Thanks for the PR but I don't think randomized transitions is a good idea. I like the idea of changing one or two transitions to make them stand out but changing every transitions will make the presentation hard to follow.\n. Transitions speeds are set in CSS and I want to keep it that way. I see how this could be useful though so I'll add predefined speed settings (extra slow, slow, normal, fast, extra fast), which can be set via a data-attribute.\n. Sure, you'll can manually edit the transition definitions here if you want https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/css/reveal.css#L552\n. Closed by #395\n. Thanks for updating. I'll merge this in as soon as I have time to test.\n. This has been merged into dev.\n. Added a few more colors, in the dev branch.\n. You're right that it's supposed to work that way, and it used to, but the code had broken somewhere along the way. I've fixed it in the dev branch.\n. Thanks! This has been merged in.\n. Yes you'll need to set up a web server to do this, it's not part of grunt. The min files depends on which plugin and theme you're using, I'd just upload all of it.\n. Thanks \u2013 I've merged this into the dev branch.\n. There's no way of disabling a select few keyboard events without editing the source (https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/js/reveal.js#L1659). \nMany people have had similar questions so I'll open an issue to make it possible to disable specific internal keyboard listeners. That way you can add your own keyboard listener and call any API method on the Reveal object to navigate.\nThe presentations looks really really great! Add it to the examples if you want :)\n. It's probably going to be difficult integrating due to the transforms applied to reveal.js slides which make it hard for a plugin to figure out the screen positions of elements. Did you give it a try?\nI want to focus on reveal.js features and issues, rather than compatibility with other libraries, so unfortunately won't be taking this on.\n. The state backgrounds which you're referring to in the comment on the old issue can't be printed per slide. There's only one background element which displays this color and it's re-used for all slides. \nThe only way I could see this happening is if JS checks for the print-pdf flag and re-uses the state-background styles to create a local background, within the slide.\n. Yeah exactly. Not sure if it will work, but it's worth a shot.\nOn Monday, April 15, 2013, wdanilo wrote:\n\nI'm sorry, I'm not web developer and I'm not even Javascript programmer,\nbut as far as I understeand, you see a way to create the effect of\nbackground changes by creating \"local background\"?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/403#issuecomment-16391778\n.\n. No estimates unfortunately \u2013 I work on this project in my spare time and there's not a whole lot of that so expect it to take a while. \n. This has been fixed in the dev branch. The syntax for setting per-slide backgrounds has also changed. More info here https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/tree/dev#slide-backgrounds\n. As @coderjoe pointed out this already exists in the speaker notes plugin. Feels good to close an issue without doing any work :D \n. Mavericks is out, so the best fix for this issue is now an OS X update. https://twitter.com/helloanselm/status/392966126302683136\n. I can see how some people may prefer a more traditional grid layout but unfortunately I'm not interested in adding another overview mode. Need to limit the amount of variance the framework provides at some point to avoid overcomplicating it and making the code base hard to maintain. I try to be strict about additions to the reveal.js core, though I'm open to plugins.\n\nThere is a search plugin which feels like the right place to add jump-to-slide-# functionality if you want to. \n. Sure, is the prefixed v a problem or can that stay? I'll limit it to renaming the latest tag and onwards in case any of the prior ones are linked to.\n. All tags have been renamed.\n. Thanks for taking the time to record feedback in a video. It's intended to work the way it did in your demo, let's say we have this layout:\n```\nA B C\n1 1 1\n2 2 2\n3 3 3\n```\nEven though that may look like a grid in the overview it's really not. The flow that reveal.js optimizes for is the same as the order of those sections in the HTML (A1 A2 A3 B1 B2 B3 C1 C2 C3). That's how they are intended to be stepped through when giving a talk. With that in mind the following rules are in place:\n- If you navigate from A2 to the right it will take you to the B1 since that's the start of that group of slides.\n- If you navigate to the left, you're most likely looking to go back to the slide you were on so the framework remembers the slide and shows you that.\nWould a config option to always start from the top vertical slide (not remembering it when going back) be helpful? I'm open to adding other options for this but would ideally just like to perfect one navigation flow so that it's predictably the same for all presentations made with reveal.js.\n. There's now an attribute (data-start-indexv) which can be used to force a vertical stack to start a specific slide. See #427 \n. Hm, could you upload a demo of this? Also make sure you're testing with the latest code from master, I made some updates related to nav a few hours ago.\n. I tried that slide in the current reveal.js master and I can step through your fragment by using the right or down arrow keys.\n. Didn't realize you were only referring to the arrows \u2013 they never highlighted based on fragments, they are purely there to display navigational routes. Not sure how fragments would be represented using the same UI since they have no natural direction. \n. Fragment directions are now highlighted in the controls. Available in the dev branch.\n. This has been merged into the dev branch. \n@oncletom please test against that and report back if you're still running into any issues.\n. Thanks for the PR. Adjusted it to forward all attributes, rather than data-state specifically.\n. The issue here is conflicting script tags, reveal.js wraps markdown slides in a <script type=\"text/template\"> tag to prevent the contents from being parsed. However since you have script tags inside of your code sample, those closing tags will actually close the template tag. \n`````` html\n\n\n        # Markdown Demo</p>\n<pre><code>    ```\n    &lt;head&gt;\n      &lt;title&gt;Jasmine Spec Runner&lt;/title&gt;\n\n      &lt;link rel=\"shortcut icon\" type=\"image/png\" href=\"lib/jasmine-1.3.1/jasmine_favicon.png\"&gt;\n      &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"lib/jasmine-1.3.1/jasmine.css\"&gt;\n      &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"lib/jasmine-1.3.1/jasmine.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n      &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"lib/jasmine-1.3.1/jasmine-html.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n      &lt;!-- include source files here... --&gt;\n      &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"src/Calculator.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n      &lt;!-- include spec files here... --&gt;\n      &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"spec/CalculatorSpec.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n      &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\n        ...start Jasmine...\n      &lt;/script&gt;\n\n    &lt;/head&gt;\n    ```\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p></section>\n``````</p>\n<p>If anyone can submit a fix let me know, otherwise not sure what can be done here.\n. This is a good solution to this problem: http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2013/4/25/Autoescaping-code-blocks-in-Revealjs\n. Should be fixed as part of #432 which is now merged into the dev branch\n. Works for me when testing http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js using latest Chrome on OS X \n. I believe that depends on your browser resolution, due to how the framework is set up to scale slides uniformly it will cap their scale when the slides container outgrows the browser window. Unfortunately that's not something I'm interested in changing.\n. The framework makes no attempt to fit your content into a slide, instead it scales the slides uniformly to make them fit within the browser window. This means your content has to fit within the \"normal\" resolution of the presentation. You can change this normal resolution here https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#presentation-size\n. Thanks, this has been merged into the dev branch\n. Sure, that's a good idea and feels like something that could be turned on by default. Can you submit a pull request?\n. Was working on the code highlighter today so I went ahead and added this. Decided to not have it on by default. To trim code blocks add a <code>data-trim</code> attribute on the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> element. The readme has been updated to cover this: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/dev/README.md#code-syntax-highlighting</p>\n<p>Available in the dev branch.\n. Wouldn't that cause text flowing outside of the code block? I prefer scrolling over that.\n. Wrapped code and messy line breaks are no better than scrolling in my\nopinion. Though its just a style so if you prefer wrapping it's easy enough\nto change locally.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, April 25, 2013, Jason Swartz wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I discovered today that its hard to scroll things properly in the middle\nof a presentation :) maybe wrapping the code block?</p>\n<p>\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/420#issuecomment-16989279\n.\n.

Updates made as part of #411 includes this.\n. This repository is only for reveal.js issues (not rvl.io). We've added an auto-save feature and longer session timeout in the upcoming version of rvl.\n. Not a problem. They're closely coupled so I understand the confusion :)\n. Wasn't aware of that. Can you test other browsers and submit a pull request with the ideal api methods?\n. Check for lowercase <code>webkitRequestFullscreen</code> and prioritizing that sounds like a good approach.\n. thanks!\n. Can you debug this and submit a pull request if you find a fix? I don't have a device to test this on so it most likely won't get fixed otherwise.\n. You can use the <code>data-previous-indexv</code> attribute for this. For example:</p>\n<p><code>&lt;section data-previous-indexv=\"2\"&gt;\n  &lt;section&gt;Slide #0&lt;/section&gt;\n  &lt;section&gt;Slide #1&lt;/section&gt;\n  &lt;section&gt;Slide #2&lt;/section&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;</code></p>\n<p>Slide 2 will be active when you navigate into that stack.\n. I've added support for <code>data-start-indexv</code>, if you set an index there that slide will always be first even when going back and forth in the presentation.\n. My first recommendation would be to what you already mentioned: use hidden fragments and listen to their show/hide events. There is however no way of controlling the progress bar when using fragments.</p>\n<p>If you think it's important that the progress bar updates based on this state, you could go down the route of empty/hidden slides and monitor the <code>slidechanged</code> event to determine the state of your animation. Try this:</p>\n<p>```\n<section>\n    <div>Your d3 viz here</div></p>\n<p><!-- Hidden vertical steps which will update your animation -->\n    <section></section>\n    <section></section>\n    <section></section>\n</section>\n```</p>\n<p>Hopefully that works. \n. This is really cool and obviously very well built out. Unfortunately though, I don't want to move away from HTML as the default way of authoring presentations. One of the strengths of reveal.js is that it doesn't have many dependencies, both in terms of libraries and preprocessors. I want to keep the framework as agnostic as possible so that others can add their preferred way of input around it \u2013 just like you have.</p>\n<p>However. I'm sure there are a lot of people that would find the option of writing slides using Jade helpful so I'd love to at refer to your fork in the readme.

Anyone who's worked with the external markdown plugin care to chip in on this? Not sure what the easiest way is of adding this. \n. This is now possible thanks to @VonC's PR #640 \n. Would love to have some custom syntax like this, especially for code blocks. Fragments too if you can come up with syntax for it that doesn't conflict with Markdown. Can you submit an implementation of this as a pull request?\n. @VonC That looks great and will be a very welcome addition. Will try it out soon.\n. @VonC's pull requests (#640 &amp; #677) have been merged in so this issue is resolved.\n. Thanks for submitting this, look forward to getting it in. Would you mind moving that block to this file https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/plugin/highlight/highlight.js? </p>\n<p>There's already code in there that loops over all code blocks so feels like a suitable place.\n. Thanks. Yeah that's how it works \u2013 future tip is to create a new branch in your fork of the repository and submit the pull request from that. That way you don't run the risk of unexpectedly adding unrelated commits to the pull request after it's submitted.\n. This has been merged into the dev branch, will make its way to master soon.\n. Thought it can be left open till merged, will auto-close then.\n. Thanks a ton. Good idea to swap out the parser.

Done in the dev branch https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/commit/f3f9e5b54600cf9916e82fa27d4d2feb0c5ba68d\n. This has been merged into the dev branch, thanks! Made a few smaller edits.\n. There's nothing like this built in, but you could build one yourself and add internal links to take you to the slide you want https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#internal-links\n. done\n. Thanks for answering, @jonlow \n. Addressed this in a different way with a bit less code change, see #427 \n. Had not considered fragments being used that way, really good idea! Thanks for the PR.\n. That's now how I intended the start-index to work. If a <code>data-start-indexv</code> is set that should always be the start of the stack no matter where you navigate from. If you only want that to set the initial slide once and then let it be overridden by the framework, you can specify the <code>data-previous-indev</code> value in your HTML.\n.

From what I understand this would be very similar to how fragments work currently. Fragments are steps within a slide and are all stepped through before leaving the slide, they also work when navigating backwards. You could do something like the following:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>``` javascript\nReveal.addEventListener( 'fragmentshown', updateVisualization );\nReveal.addEventListener( 'fragmenthidden', updateVisualization );</p>\n<p>function updateVisualization( event ) {\n  var step = Reveal.getIndices().f;</p>\n<p>switch( step ) {\n    case 0:\n      // move to vis state 0\n      break;\n    case 1:\n      // move to vis state 1\n      break;\n    case 2:\n      // move to vis state 2\n      break;\n  }\n}\n```</p>\n<p>That doesn't include a condition for which slide you're on but you get the idea.</p>\n<p>I'd like to do this through fragments rather than adding new functionality that would then need to behave well together with fragments.

Okay, the <code>hidden</code> attribute should now be set for all inactive slides. This has been added to the dev branch and will make its way to master soon.\n. 1. Don't know how to address that, if anyone has any ideas feel free to submit a PR.\n2. There's been a few changes to PDF printing in the dev branch so this error manifests differently \u2013 there's an additional slide printed instead. Same deal here, would love a PR to fix this if anyone knows how to.\n. After much tinkering I was able to find a fix to get rid of the extra page that was being appended to the end of the PDF. Fixed in master.\n. No solution in sight for vertical centered printing, closing.\n. There are two different speaker notes plugins:\nhttps://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#speaker-notes\nhttps://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#server-side-speaker-notes</p>\n<p>The regular speaker notes window (the client-side version) is opened via the 's' key but I am pretty certain that does not work with the server-side version. I'd say two things need to be done here:\n- Figure out why this is not logging in your console https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/plugin/notes-server/client.js#L8\n- Update the server side speaker notes to support being opened by pressing 's' key (though it should open in a new tab, not a popup, so it can live independently of the main presentation)\n. Glad it worked out.\n. I may be missing something, but what's the issue with compiling reveal.js into the rails app's application JS and calling <code>Reveal.initialize()</code> after document ready? The framework shouldn't be doing anything that interacts with the DOM prior to the initialize call. The dependencies also won't start loading until after that point, assuming they aren't baked into the application JS.</p>\n<p>Overall I'm not very happy with the current plugin/dependency structure though. Would love it if the framework's client side plugin scripts like markdown and speaker notes could be loaded independently and then picked up when reveal.js initializes rather than having to rely on the reveal.js script loading.\n. Gotcha. I actually changed it so that those capability tests happen upon <code>initialize()</code> a few days ago, see 8ad81aa1a5fc99f6f70d30e1a7396492e4ff3335\n. Great. The update to the capability test (8ad81aa1a5fc99f6f70d30e1a7396492e4ff3335) is only in the dev branch so far but will make its way into master soon.\n. Sorry but I don't want to restructure the project so extensively to fit Grunt's templating. Want to keep a bit more agnostic than. This probably better suited as a new repo. Perhaps you can include reveal.js as a git submodule somehow, and only have the templating code in your repo. Would make it easier to keep in sync.\n. Anyone want to look into this and PR?\n. @yomguy Scaling of iframes works in Chrome OS X so I assume this is a Win-only issue. Probably has to do with how slides are scaled in reveal.js' <code>layout()</code> function. The framework prefers zooming (CSS <code>zoom</code>) over scaling (CSS 2D transforms) when possible since <code>zoom</code> produces crisper visuals.\n. Closing this as it's gone stale and I'm unable to do anything about it myself.\n. Fix by @rcl33 merged into dev branch, will make its way to master soon.\n. I believe you'll need to explicitly serve your custom directories here https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/plugin/notes-server/index.js#L27 \n. Great, glad it worked\n. I don't want to expose reveal.js' internal event handlers through the API, instead this should be done as part of #405 which will enable overwriting and rewiring of specific keys.\n. The ability to overwrite specific keys to custom functions should cover this as far as I can tell. In your use-case:</p>\n<p><code>javascript\nReveal.configure({\n  keyboard: {\n    [pgDownKeyCode]: function() {\n      if( condition ) {\n        // do your custom thing\n      }\n      else {\n        Reveal.next();\n      }\n    },\n    [f5KeyCode]: Reveal.toggleOverview\n  }\n});</code></p>\n<p>The internal handling of keyboard events will change as part of this too, it will essentially have a default keyboard map in the same format as the above that can then be overwritten by the user-specified map.\n. FYI: #405 added this keyboard bindings option, details: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#keyboard-bindings\n. Thanks for the input but unfortunately this won't make it into the project. It would add a lot of complexity to the code and that is something I'm trying to avoid at all costs since it means slower progress from there on and higher risks for bugs.\n. That is a lot of commits, especially since it comes down to two lines of code changing :P Can you copy the changes over to a new branch and submit from that?\n. Sorry guys but this one won't be making it into the framework. Want to try and stick to features that have a broader use case. I feel like there's too many features that are barely used in the source already and it's muddying up the code which ultimately leads to more bugs.\n. You need to include the <code>classList</code> polyfill, see the top dependency item here: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#dependencies\n. Thanks for the heads up, has been fixed in dev and will make it to master soon.\n. This is a planned feature for slid.es. Since it requires components for recording and storage of generated cue-point files I don't think it belongs in the main reveal.js repository. Though if anyone wants to fork a version specifically for this type of input that'd be great.\n. Thanks for the report, this has been fixed in the dev branch.\n. Thanks for the PR but I'd like to avoid adding things that are very environment-specific to the main repo, especially at the root level where it runs the risk of confusing new users. There's so many types of server side environments out there and I think it's better for reveal.js to stay agnostic. \n. Thanks for the suggestion but I don't want to add this since I think it will clutter up the screen. The numerical index of the current slide isn't as interesting to me as the progress bar, which shows how long I've got left in total.</p>\n<p>Should be fairly easy to add this using the reveal.js API if you want it in your decks though.\n. Fixed by #485 (in dev)\n. Merged into dev, thanks.\n. Is the SVG element you are trying to get the bounding box of visible on screen? I'd imagine those kind of values if reading the bbox from an SVG element inside of a future, currently invisible, slide.</p>\n<p>If not that perhaps the CSS 3D transforms of reveal.js are affecting it.\n. I'm going to assume this was related to the visibility of the measured SVG element as mentioned above. Just tried measuring the rectangle in the following example and it worked as expected in both Chrome and FF:</p>\n<p><code>&lt;section&gt;\n    &lt;svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" version=\"1.1\"&gt;\n      &lt;rect width=\"300\" height=\"100\" style=\"fill:rgb(0,0,255);stroke-width:1;stroke:rgb(0,0,0)\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/svg&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;</code>\n. You should be able to do this using phantomjs and the print-pdf plugin https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/plugin/print-pdf/print-pdf.js</p>\n<p>Haven't tested that in a long time but hopefully it's still working.\n. Your client presentation should not have a \"secret\" key set to avoid them being able to control the navigation of other clients. The secret key should only be set in the master presentation. More info here https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#multiplexing\n. Oh, you should be able to pass <code>touch: false</code> to your Reveal.initialize call to disable that.\n. Opera doesn't support the CSS 3D transforms required for the overview mode and other reveal.js transitions. This will be automatically fixed when Opera 15 is out since they are changing to WebKit.\n. Merged into dev, thanks.\n. If you added an element to the DOM there's only one of those, so it can only get printed in one place. I'm no expert in print styles but perhaps this can help: http://stackoverflow.com/a/6109932/1601643\n. Thanks!\n. Oops, just noticed that this and the other pull request I merged both changed the generate <code>.css</code> files. Those will be overwritten when the themes are compiled from their Sass sources, so this change needs to be made to the <code>.scss</code> file.\n. Cool, merged.\n. Image background support has been lacking and this is something that I've tried to address. The dev branch has an all new way of setting per-slide backgrounds, more info here: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/tree/dev#slide-backgrounds</p>\n<p>This new implementation allows you to control full/partial bleed using background-size cover/contain, it defaults to full bleed. It also enables PDF printing of per-slide backgrounds which wasn't previously possible.</p>\n<p>That said, it doesn't allow you to relatively match the position of overlaying text content. Not sure how that would be best accomplished, but if you're okay with a fixed resolution that should work. See the presentation size options here https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#presentation-size and remember to set min/max scale to 1 to avoid scaling.\n. I don't think images should be scaled up automatically since that would result in big blurry images, and depending on what the image is for it may be intended to be small. </p>\n<p>Fitting images that are too large would be great but I don't know how that would be implemented, technically. It's easy enough when there's no other content on the slide but determining the remaining height in the midst of other content (like the below) is tricky. Multiple images on the same slide are also a challenge. </p>\n<p><code>&lt;h2&gt;Title&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;img src=\"...\"&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Caption&lt;/p&gt;</code>\n. This is now possible to work around using the <code>stretch</code> helper class. The class invokes JavaScript layout code for figuring out how much vertical space there is remaining on the slide. The layout code also ensures that aspect ratios are maintained for media elements.</p>\n<p>Usage instructions here: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/tree/dev#stretching-elements</p>\n<p>Currently only in the dev branch.\n. The 'o' key can now be used as an alternate key to toggle the overview, I've added this to the readme as well.\n. Note that this is only in the dev branch so far.\n. Thanks, this has been merged into the dev branch.\n. You can't fully disable the layout functions but if you set width and height to <code>100%</code> reveal.js will size all slides to fill the reveal.js container element.\n. Sorry but I don't think this would be commonly used enough to warrant adding to the framework.\n. Good catch. Thanks for the fix.\n. sure, added\n. oops, relative paths were broken since my last commit, fixed now\n. Not sure what may be causing it to scroll down for you. The framework is built for full page presentations though, so visible overflow on the page isn't a scenario it takes into account.\n. Anyone that can confirm or debug/fix this? Tried using BrowerStack but the connection is so slow I can't see the transitions.\n. There doesn't seem to be much interest in addressing the vertical slide issue. Not sure what might be causing and can't test that part well as explained above. Anyone have any ideas?</p>\n<p>@anotherwebstorm I've been testing IE10 quite a lot lately preparing for the 2.5.0 release and haven't encountered this issue. There's been a few changes (in the dev branch) so perhaps the issue you referred to has been resolved.\n. Weird, in that video there are no 3d transforms happening at all. It looks like it's just scaling the slide vertically. I can't do anything about this but will leave the issue open if anyone else is able.\n. Fixed by @thcipriani here #591 \n. noted this at https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/dev/README.md#fragment-events\n. I've not interacted much with npm, beyond consuming it. Curious about what amount of change would this involve in the reveal.js repository. Would the plugins need to be separated out into multiple repositories? </p>\n<p>In general, I'm very interested in formalizing more structure for plugins and have also been trying to come with a better approach for the current dependency loading.\n. Thanks for the info, @webpro </p>\n<p>Just publish 2.5.0 to npm https://npmjs.org/package/reveal.js. I agree that splitting plugins into separate repositories is probably not the way to go because of the added complexity. </p>\n<p>Re dependencies: I want to make sure that all plugins, the client side ones in particular, are structured the same way. There's currently a lot of variation. Still need to give that all some more thought but since we're all set with the npm publish I'll close this :)\n. Yep, done.\n. Not sure how a version was published without the archive actually existing on the npm server. It's not possible to replace the 2.6.1 so I had to bump the reveal.js version to 2.6.2 and release that instead.\n. Added this in (dev branch), had made a lot of other modifications to the Markdown code so I copied it in manually. Note that the API method names have changed.\n. You'll need to set the allowFullscreen attribute on your iframe (including webkit and moz prefixed versions): https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe\n. Haven't been able to get this working, can you add an example to https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/plugin/markdown/example.html as part of the PR?\n. Was able to get this working now. It has been merged into the dev branch and will be released as part of reveal.js 2.5.0.</p>\n<p>Thanks @adamhepton !\n. I'm all for making the setup/update process easier. This looks like a good direction, there's also https://github.com/slara/generator-reveal which I haven't tried out yet. </p>\n<p>I believe keeping this in a separate repo is the way to go but they should be covered in the readme to make it easier for people to discover.\n. Doesn't look like any of the styles are being applied judging by your screenshot. Please make sure one of the theme css file as well as the main css files are both included on the page.</p>\n<p>If you're still having issue you'll need to upload an example that I can look at.\n. I dropped in a default line-height to normalize a bit when no theme is set.\n. The framework hides any slide that is more than three steps away using <code>display: none</code> for performance reasons. JavaScript controls that. It seems however that when the next slide is vertical, this logic is failing and all of the vertical slides are invisible until navigating to the stack. Would correcting this be of any help? I have no experience in using a screen reader or working with accessibility.</p>\n<p>Including the PDF print CSS file without <code>media=print</code> would render the presentation in a flat view that should be accessible. However that doesn't seem like a good solution, ideally the regular presentation is accessible.\n. The issue with vertical slides remaining hidden that I mentioned above has been fixed. Hopefully that corrects the original problem.</p>\n<p>Closing this but do let me know if you discover any other changes that could be made to make the framework more accessible. \n. Made some updates but altered the language a bit. Rather than referencing specific example locations for the tokens, I referred to the instructions below that explains in more detail how that part works. Also subbed out the comments that mentioned \"optional\" dependencies in favor of a note about remembering to include them. </p>\n<p>https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/dev/README.md\n. Unfortunately not a setup I can test, will leave this open for a while if you can submit a PR to fix it.\n. Would be best to uncover the issue and fix it at the source, rather than user agent specific code. Do other CSS 3D transforms work in your OpenSuse Chrome? For example, this should display a 3D box: http://hakim.se/experiments/css/holobox/\n. That's a bit specific to merit a change in the framework. You can change the CSS here to any background color you want for your presentation though: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/css/reveal.css#L1189\n. As long as you're using the latest version of reveal.js that works. I just pasted it into an untouched copy of the repo to confirm.\n. I don't know anything about MathJax so can't offer any input on this unfortunately. If it turns out to be a bug and you figure out a solution, please submit a pull request.\n. Thanks. Fixed these up in the dev branch.\n. Yeah Chrome is the only supported browser for PDF export.\n. Not sure what may be wrong there and unfortunately I can't offer to debug. reveal.js is made for full page presentations, so visible overflow isn't a scenario it takes into account.\n. Hopefully SCSS support is added to highlight.js so we can drop it into reveal.js. But yeah, as you said this is is not immediately related to reveal.js so closing the issue.\n. fixed in the dev branch\n. It defaults to 960x700 which nicely matches the common 1024x764 aspect ratio. You can configure this to be whatever you like though https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#presentation-size\n. I don't think this merits a new config option, but would be open to fixing the issue if it doesn't affect performance negatively. Perhaps we can separate the code which hides slides further than three steps away and call that after a timeout.\n. I made some significant updates to the code which measures distances between slides and determines what should be visible. Made it a configuration value at the same time, so you can now pass <code>viewDistance: Number.MAX_VALUE</code> if you want it to be infinite. That'll make long-distance transitions work, at the expense of performance. Mostly an issue if the deck contains a lot of images/videos.</p>\n<p>Edit: This is only available in the dev branch so far.\n. sure, good idea\n. This has been added to the dev branch. Specifying 'none' will avoid transitions.\n. Was looking at #530 and decided to check this out too. I've added a fix to the dev branch and as far as I can tell from some basic testing it's working well. 8dcf324f7a7362fb3bcc758b2d1726be9bcad807\n. There used to be a known bug in Chrome that caused it to stutter every time the hash changed. Just tested locally and this doesn't seem to be an issue anymore so I've taken out the delay in the dev branch.\n. Thanks @pkra, will do.\n. A 1.0 implementation of this has been added to the dev branch, covered here: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/dev/README.md#mathjax\n. @dandv Feedback heard. Though I really don't like having an unstable feature in there, immediately breaking backwards compatibility might not be the right move. Rolling links are back in but turned off by default (deprecated) and the long term plan is still to remove them entirely. \n. Corrected in dev branch.\n. Perhaps the CSS selector isn't specific enough and gets overridden by the reveal.js styles. Can you upload that deck and share a link?\n. The CSS selector you're using isn't specific enough, changing it to <code>.first-down .reveal .navigate-down</code> works.\n. Thanks, this has been merged into the dev branch. https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/commits/dev\n. Can see how that would be useful. Two comments:\n- Should it be <code>data-charset</code>? Not sure if the <code>charset</code> attribute is valid on any element.\n- There should be a null check to avoid <code>charset=null</code> when the attribute isn't defined.</p>\n<p>Would love get this as a pull request (towards the dev branch).\n. Great, will merge that soon!\n. This has been merged into the dev branch. I moved the example to the main readme file.\n. That's an old issue that has since been fixed here in the repository. The demo was out of date but I've updated it now.\n. I misread your question, I thought you were referring to fragment navigations in the main window not reflecting in the notes window.\n. This has been fixed in the dev branch.\n. This all looks like CSS conflicts, i.e. reveal.js styles being applied to the diagram. Unfortunately you'll nee to write custom styles to reset jumly to the way it's originally intended to look. Alternatively, you could place the diagram in a transparent iframe.</p>\n<p>There's nothing that will change in reveal.js for this so closing the issue.\n. I just regenerated the page from the repo readme to bring it up to date. Was very outdated.</p>\n<p>Really want to find time to build out a custom site for the project soon.\n. Most likely caused by whitespace inside of the <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tag. You can try using the <code>data-trim</code> (https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#code-syntax-highlighting) or removing all of the white space and linebreaks around the actual code.\n. That's a cool idea but unfortunately not something I'd like to add to the repo. I'd like to reserve the sidebar space for another upcoming feature :)\n. After step 3 of the instructions (starting the node server) you should see a URL in the console. You'll need to use that URL to access your presentation for this to work. It's <code>localhost:1947</code> by default.\n. Thanks for the PR, a few comments:\n- <code>initializeNode</code> is a little bit too generic of a name IMO, would prefer <code>createSingletonNode</code> which is in effect what it's doing.\n- Please make sure the code matches the reveal.js formatting (spacing around parenthesis, empty lines in start/end of functions).\n- Since <code>buildNode</code> is used exclusively by <code>initializeNode</code> they should be merged.\n. Thanks for updating, this has been merged into the dev branch.\n. A leap motion plugin would be very cool. Maybe pinch can be used to trigger the overview mode too.\n. Merged in, see #554 \n. Just tried this on my iPhone and the address bar is hiding. Are you using Chrome for iOS? It won't work there.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately none of those devices support the full screen API http://caniuse.com/fullscreen\n. Just tried this with one of the sample images in the repo and it worked. Assuming this is a local issue \u2013 make sure your markup is the same as the below and that your image path is correct.</p>\n<p><code>html\n&lt;section data-markdown&gt;\n    &lt;script type=\"text/template\"&gt;\n        ![alt text](examples/assets/image1.png)\n    &lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;</code>\n. Not sure I follow \u2013 can you explain in a bit more detail what this fixes?\n. Thanks for explaining. I've merged this into the dev branch https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/commits/dev efbcab57f74891a060320af1c9e2e3c039febc5a\n. Sorry but this isn't the place for slid.es related issues, this repository is dedicated to the open source presentation framework (reveal.js). If you want to suggest features for Slides you can do so here: http://slides.uservoice.com/</p>\n<p>Multiuser collaboration is on the roadmap but it's a tricky feature and will take some time to build out.\n. Bullet indentation is controlled by the margin value here https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/css/reveal.css#L236\n. Hey. I won't be making this a config option since it's wired into so many places. To make the change manually, you'll need to replace all occurrences of <code>section</code> in the reveal.js and reveal.css files with whichever selector you prefer.\n. @marsch haven't had the time to continue on this one yet, not sure when I'll be able to\n. Markdown doesn't support text color so unfortunately you'll only be able to achieve that through HTML.</p>\n<p>Doesn't seem like any reveal.js issue remains here so will close this. Thanks for your input @tomByrer \n. Thanks a ton for this! I don't have a device to test on but everything looks good in the diff. Will merge it in shortly.\n. Merged into the dev branch https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/commits/dev</p>\n<p>Will make its way into master with the next release.\n. Went ahead and merged this into master, didn't want to wait for dev to be merged :)\n. Made a small change to this, since there were so few styles in the reveal.css file I figure it'd be nice to have it all in the leap.js file.\n. What browser are you using? If you're in Chrome please right click, Inspect Page, click Console and let me know if there is any red error message there.</p>\n<p>This repository is dedicated to reveal.js, when filing Slides issues in the future please go to http://slides.uservoice.com/\n. Did you use the HTML editor to insert any content, like an <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> with base64 encoded SVG or a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag? Our XSS sniffing might be triggering on something that it shouldn't. Looking into the logs and will get back to you with what we find.\n. Can you try going to the slid.es homepage and check if you're still signed in?\n. We can't find any helpful details in the logs, unsure what might have gone wrong. Does saving of other decks work?\n. Okay, looks like it's the big base64 embedded image of Obama that's failing. Try deleting that then saving.\n. No problem, we found the problem and have rolled out a fix so you should be able to save base64 embeds again.\n. I'm assuming you mean the order in which they appear? See the <code>data-fragment-index</code> property. Covered here https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/#fragments\n. You should be able to set the same <code>data-fragment-index</code> for the two elements you want to swap so that both trigger at the same time. Then you'd need to apply <code>fragment fade-in</code> and <code>fragment fade-out</code> classes to the two elements respectively.</p>\n<p>There's no automated way of making the elements visually stack on top of each other, so you'll need to define those styles yourself. \n. You can use the data-transition attribute for this. More info here: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#slide-transitions</p>\n<p>Note that you can only set one transition per slide, so the targeted slide will always appear and disappear in the same way.\n. There's no option for that. You could do it by using state events as described here: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#states</p>\n<p>Add a state to your last slide, then add an event listener for that state, when it fires change window.location to the URL you'd like to redirect to. For example:</p>\n<p><code>Reveal.addEventListener( 'mylastslide', function() {\n    window.location = 'http://google.com';\n} );</code>\n. You'll need to run the presentation in a local web server for external markdown to work. The development setup comes with a <code>grunt serve</code> task for this: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#full-setup</p>\n<p>Let me know if you experience any issues with it after it's in a web server.\n. I believe the best approach to this would be to swap out the styles on the page. If you have the following in your <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>:</p>\n<p><code>html\n&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/reveal.min.css\" id=\"css-base\"&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/theme/default.css\" id=\"css-theme\"&gt;</code></p>\n<p>Then you could do this:</p>\n<p>``` javascript\n// outline mode:\ndocument.querySelector('#css-base').setAttribute( 'href', 'css/print/paper.css' );\ndocument.querySelector('#css-theme').setAttribute( 'href', '' );\nReveal.removeEventListeners();</p>\n<p>// back to presentation mode:\ndocument.querySelector('#css-base').setAttribute( 'href', 'css/reveal.min.css' );\ndocument.querySelector('#css-theme').setAttribute( 'href', 'css/theme/default.css' );\nReveal.addEventListeners();\n```</p>\n<p>Note that this uses the print stylesheet, you'd need to copy that and change it so that it keeps notes visible too.</p>\n<p>Appreciate the suggestion, and I can see how this may be useful in some cases, but I think #304 is more useful and satisfies a similar use case. \n. There's now a new helper class you can use to stretch any element to fit within the remaining vertical height of a slide. The class is called <code>stretch</code> and it only works on elements that are immediate children of a slide <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>. Example below.</p>\n<p><code>&lt;section&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;Custom Events&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;pre class=\"stretch\"&gt;&lt;code data-trim&gt;\n        Reveal.addEventListener( 'customevent', function() {\n            console.log( '\"customevent\" has fired' );\n        } );\n    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;</code></p>\n<p>Note that this is only available in the dev branch so far. Will be added to the docs as well.\n. Update: renamed helper class from <code>remaining-height</code> to <code>stretch</code>.\n. OS X Chrome locks up for 5-10s when holding down the arrow keys on a 100+ slides deck but it didn't crash. The keydown event gets fired very frequently so I'm not very surprised it's resulting in a browser meltdown. </p>\n<p>Was not able to reproduce the looping issue in Safari.\n. When you say \"rebuild the OS\", do you mean your OS crashed so badly it won't start back up?\n. I tried but was never able to achieve vertically centered slides in PDF output. Unfortunately no change since then so this limitation will remain.\n. Thanks @millermedeiros. Hadn't considered flexbox for this.</p>\n<p>Judging by http://caniuse.com/flexbox it seems compatible enough to merit a migration from the current JS-based centering for both normal viewing and PDF printing. Will file a new issue to give that a try.\n. Unfortunately there is no easy way to break out of the defined presentation size for a specific slide, mostly due to how slides are laid out and scaled.</p>\n<p>You could however do the reverse and set the presentation to be 100% the browser width/height, and then use padding on the slides you want to be smaller.</p>\n<p><code>Reveal.initialize({\n    width: '100%',\n    height: '100%'\n})</code>\n. You'll need to override the background on the body element. For example, appending the following to the presentation HTML works:</p>\n<p><code>&lt;style&gt;\n    body {\n        background: url( 'http://placekitten.com/200/300' );\n    }\n&lt;/style&gt;</code>\n. The <strong>notes-server</strong> and <strong>multiplex</strong> plugins are the only ones that run a node.js server. The new plugins in 2.5.0 are <strong>math</strong> and <strong>leap</strong>.\n. Thanks for taking the time to add these but I unfortunately I've decided not to add this to the readme. Serving assets from a CDN is good practice but I don't think it is very important for the typical use case of reveal.js. It also means all those resources would need to be kept up to date as the framework is updated.</p>\n<p>If the reveal.js consisted of single concatenated CSS and JS files I would have been for dropping this in, but as the framework is currently structured you'd need to change so many different paths for this to work that I think few people will bother.\n. Hey. The issue with <code>data-autoslide</code> was fixed in 2.5.0, see #525. Please upgrade to the latest version and you should be good to go.\n. You'll need to store a reference to the function you're adding as a listener to be able to remove it again. Like so:</p>\n<p>```\nfunction onTest() {\n  $('.test').addClass('box-animation');\n}</p>\n<p>Reveal.addEventListener( 'test', onTest );\nReveal.removeEventListener( 'test', onTest );\n```\n. I can see how this would be useful. It should be implemented so that the external .html files load the same way as external Markdown (XHR). This probably belongs in a new plugin, <em>external-html</em>? And it could use data attributes like markdown as well:</p>\n<p><code>html\n&lt;section data-html=\"/my/external.html\"&gt;&lt;/section&gt;</code>\n. Thanks, that's a good catch. This has been fixed in the dev branch and will be pulled into master soon.\n. Yes D3.js would be the go to library for visualizations. </p>\n<p>Not gonna build any custom integrations for these specific libraries though. If there are ant specific bugs that prevent them from being used inside of reveal.js feel free to report those.\n. Good call, just updated.\n. Sounds like the browser doesn't shift input focus back into the active tab after closing the opened tab. Tried this in Chrome with normal mouse + keyboard input and it doesn't seem to be an issue there.\n. I see the problem in Firefox too. When the opened tab is closed, focus is not placed back on the presentation tab. Not sure what can be done about it, if anything, yet.\n. see #617\n. Not sure I follow \u2013 why is the notes windows triggering events a problem? They should be scoped into iframes inside of the notes window and therefore shouldn't conflict with anything in the main presentation. Please describe what you're running into in greater detail.\n. Okay that makes sense and the behavior should not change while the notes are open. What I don't understand is how the evens from the upcoming slide could have an effect on the other instances (the main window or \"current\" slide in the notes window).\n. I'm assuming this was fixed by #609 \n. Just tried this in Chrome OS X and fragments are kept in sync between the notes and presentation windows. Regardless of which one I navigate from. Tested on the demo page http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js</p>\n<p>Please make sure the syntax is correct and if that's not an issue, debug further and let me know if you discover anything else. Perhaps you're using a different version of reveal.js? The one linked above is <code>2.5.0 (2013-08-19, 23:45)</code>.\n. Still not able to reproduce this so closing.\n. See #569 \n. I'm assuming this issue, like you mentioned, is an effect of the iframes, or rather their parent slides, being hidden before navigated to. Not sure why. </p>\n<p>I'd recommend going for something like the workaround you already have, where the source is set once the slide is opened.</p>\n<p>Alternatively you can set the <code>viewDistance</code> attribute to a very high number to not hide past/future slides. https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/js/reveal.js#L92\n. This is still an issue for me when trying Chrome iOS in portrait mode on an iPhone 5. The real problem is how reveal.js hackily sets the body height to 120% to ensure the is enough overflow to hide the address bar in Safari. Perhaps there's a more elegant solution to hiding the address bar, one that means that the body height can be the same for both Chrome and Safari on iOS?\n. Address bar hiding is now enabled in Chrome and the vertical alignment problem in portrait mode is no longer an issue.\n. Fixed by #585 \n. Thanks, your change has been merged into the dev branch. 4ce5c75d19da4f8339a1b318c570e92b1cb8f971\n. This has been merged into the dev branch. Thanks!\n. Sure, I'm all for adding an API to the plugin and using <code>data-markdown-parsed</code> to flag already processed sections sounds goood.\n. Just added this to the dev branch. <code>RevealMarkdown.initialize()</code> will trigger parsing of any new Markdown in the DOM.\n. Thanks for the PR but this amount of integration with one specific type of web server doesn't belong in the main repo :(\n. Which languages were added as part of this? If the languages are uncommon I'm not sure they merit the tripled file size.\n. Sure, the current list is: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Bash, C#, C++, CSS, Diff, HTML, XML, HTTP, Ini, JSON, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, SQL,   Clojure, GLSL, Lua, Scala, CoffeeScript, Go, Objective C, ActionScript, Markdown</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How about adding: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>F#, Haml, Handlebars, Django, Erlang, Haskell, TeX\n. Went ahead and merged this in \u2013 with all languages supported by highlight.js.\n. Thanks for reporting, this has been fixed in the dev branch.\n. I think I understand the setup you're describing but what change to reveal.js are you suggesting? \n. Sorry but that deep a level of integration for a specific type of host, git in this case, doesn't belong in the main repo. Probably better suited as a fork.\n. Great stuff! This has been merged into the dev branch.\n. Glad you guys were able to work this out, thanks @rparree \n. You just need a more specific selector in your CSS, replace <code>.reveal {</code> with <code>.reveal .slides {</code>.\n. I'm not seeing any images in slides 11 or 14 when looking at the normal presentation (http://dague.net/presentations/opensource-openstack-style/). The image on slide 8 appears when printing in Chrome OS X.\n. Finally had a chance to check this out, very impressive! Definitely want to add this to the framework. Comments:\n- This shouldn't be enabled by default on the example presentation. \n- Would love to find another image to use as an example, something that doesn't clash so much with the content. I'll look around.\n- I don't think we need to include the example asset in the repository. I can drop it on a CDN.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's getting pretty hard to demo all of these great features using one presentation but I'm hoping to solve that by building a better site for reveal.js where multiple examples can be showed.\n. This has been merged into the dev branch. Made a couple of changes:\n- The image is now applied to the <code>.backgrounds</code> element rather than <code>.reveal</code>\n- Added a new example image\n- Moved the parallax update code to its own function\n- Change the input from CSS style (<code>url(\"image.jpg\")</code>) to just plain URL\n- Made it possible to configure on and off at runtime (via <code>Reveal.configure()</code>)\n. I this the server side (node.js) or client side speaker notes plugin?\n. I see. This works for me in FF 26 OS X when using the client side speaker notes. Anyone else that can test Windows?\n. Ah, I see. Attempts were made to fix that previously but it didn't go anywhere. The popup doesn't have the same reference to the main window (<code>window.opener</code>) when it's been debounced by the FF popup dialog.\n. I'm guessing this is in Firefox? I'm seeing something similar running FF 26 OS X, probably something they have changed recently.\n. Noticed that this can be fixed by forcing all slides remain transformed. Though it leaves them slightly blurred.</p>\n<p><code>css\n.reveal .slides&gt;section {\n    -moz-transform: translateZ(1px);\n}</code>\n. I've considered this back and forth but decided against merging it in. In environments where reveal.js is loaded asynchronously this patch would cause the layout to change drastically after the script executes, leading to potential flicker of the static layout for JS-enabled browsers.\n. That's a very helpful addition, thanks!\n. Did you download all of the MathJax files and is everything kept in its original folder structure? MathJax loads external files relative to the where the JS file is located. More details here http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/configuration.html\n. Was just going to patch this but noticed this is not an issue in the latest dev version of reveal.js. The dev branch is about 200 commits ahead of master so I'm not sure which change exactly that happened to also fixed this.</p>\n<p>Below is the presentation markup I tested. Let me know if there's anything I missed or if this is an inadequate test.</p>\n<p>``` html\n<head>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/reveal.css\">\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/theme/default.css\" id=\"theme\"></p>\n<pre><code>&lt;link href=\"//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.1.0/css/font-awesome.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p></head>\n<body>\n    <div class=\"reveal\">\n        <div class=\"slides\">\n            <section>\n                <i class=\"fa fa-camera-retro fa-lg\"></i>\n                <i class=\"fa fa-camera-retro fa-2x\"></i>\n                <i class=\"fa fa-camera-retro fa-5x\"></i>\n            </section>\n        </div>\n    </div></p>\n<pre><code>&lt;script src=\"js/reveal.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;Reveal.initialize();&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p></body>\n```\n. Sorry but this isn't something that's going to get added to the framework.</p>\n<p>If you want to do it yourself you'll need to change a lot of CSS since that's where the visual hierarchy is determined. Start by looking at the transitions.\n. I'm not able to test any of those systems. If anyone else is able to debug this that would be great.\n. Not sure I understand this question. If you're trying to disable auto-sliding at runtime you can use</p>\n<p><code>javascript\nReveal.configure({ autoSlide: 0 }); // off\nReveal.configure({ autoSlide: 5000 }); // on</code></p>\n<p>If that's not what you're asking, please provide more details.\n. Good catch. I've added your fix.\n. Added this in but formatted it a bit differently to avoid breaking the bullet order.\n. Can you explain in more detail what this actually fixes, or rather how I can reproduce the original error to test the fix? I don't believe the <code>?receiver</code> flag has any effect in the client side notes.\n. Thanks, didn't know it was multiplex related but that makes perfect sense. I've merged this in.\n. Hey, there are no plans for pursuing support for this outside of a web server. It's pretty easy to get a server running using the installation instructions thought: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/#full-setup\n. I'll move this to S3 instead, read through rawgithub.com and they don't want it to be used for anything but minor one-person dev environments.\n. This is now being served from S3, in the dev branch. Thanks @potomak for pointing out the issue.\n. I think this is a fair limitation, notes should be at the end of slides,\nafter content. This limitation should be pointed out in the readme though\nso I'll update it.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, September 19, 2013, Mike Pretzlaw wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hm.

This was fixed in #721 \n. Thanks for the pull request. I can see the usefulness of keeping track of time remaining but reveal.js already provides a similar mechanic through the notes plugin.

Good spotting, I've removed head.js from the example page.\n. Tested and this fixes the issue for me, thanks @rexxars!\n. If I'm reading the editorconfig page right, this only works if you have their plugin installed for your respective IDE? I think that's a bit too narrow to merit another metadata file.\n. I wonder if this may be related to how the gradients are generated: \nmixin: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/css/theme/template/mixins.scss\nuse: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/css/theme/source/default.scss#L34-L36</p>\n<p>Maybe someone who's on Linux could play around with those settings and see if there's a change that gets rid of the artifact? For example, does it make a difference how the colors are defined (rgb vs hex) and does using either a prefixed or non-prefixed gradient definition make a difference?\n. Added a named link for this instead, in case the slide number changes again in the future.\n. Going to need a bit more info to test this:\n- Please post an example presentation where this happens\n- What tablet and browser were you using?\n- What background transition setting were you using?\n. Hey, I tried adding a background image to the first slide of a presentation. The background loaded and was immediately visible in both iOS and desktop Chrome.</p>\n<p>Let me know if you're still encountering this, and if you've uncovered any more info about it. You could also try a fresh clone of the reveal.js and see if you're able to reproduce the issue there, to determine if it's a project setup or reveal.js bug.\n. This is how it's intended to work, one state can span multiple slides. Can you describe why you'd like to apply the same state on multiple successive slides? I'm sure there are use cases that I'm just not seeing.\n. Gotcha. I'd recommend using the more generic <code>slidechanged</code> event for that, for example:</p>\n<p><code>html\n&lt;div class=\"slides\"&gt;\n  &lt;section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;\n  &lt;section class=\"slide-with-inputs\"&gt;&lt;/section&gt;\n  &lt;section class=\"slide-with-inputs\"&gt;&lt;/section&gt;\n  &lt;section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</code></p>\n<p><code>javascript\nReveal.addEventListener( 'slidechanged', function( event ) {\n  if( event.currentSlide.classList.contains( 'slide-with-inputs' ) ) {\n    // do something for sections with the \"slide-with-inputs\" class\n  }\n} );</code>\n. Thanks for reporting, this has been fixed.\n. I've made some significant changes to the core layout of reveal.js. Individual slide elements are no longer offset to a negative position which used to cause layout issues within the slides. Also vertical centering is now handled using flexbox if the browser supports it, otherwise falling back on the existing JavaScript layout code.</p>\n<p>These latest changes are available in the flexbox branch: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/tree/flexbox\n. Unfortunately it turns out the drawbacks involved with switching reveal.js' layout to flexbox aren't worth it. Particularly want to avoid having the content of all slides be flex children since that changes their layout behavior, disallowing things like inline elements. Related #862\n. Should be fixed by baa6fa45de2c4ebeb9212d1d0f2a692c246fb285 which removes the reset of <code>i</code>.\n. fixed\n. Thanks for the PR. Can you explain how, and in what context, this would be used and why it's built into the notes plugin?\n. Not sure why that doesn't work, but this syntax does:</p>\n<p>``````\n- Basic code fragment for a client:</p>\n<pre><code>```\nSocket client = new Socket(\"localhost\", 1234);\n```\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>Let us send a message from the client, and have the server print it out. </li>\n<li>\n<p>On server, add</p>\n<p><code>InputStream inputStream = socket.getInputStream();\nInputStreamReader isReader = new InputStreamReader(inputStream);\nBufferedReader inputReader = new BufferedReader(isReader);\nSystem.out.println(\"Client wrote: \" + inputReader.readLine());</code>\n``````\n. Merged into dev.\n. Thanks for reporting, @Nocturnaloner. If you can provide a sample presentation where this happens we'll re-open and test.\n. yep, this will be added\n. This has been corrected by b455b0281dfe52dd9a01a0687d44895ff45a2d60\n. Does this mean IE11 doesn't support their former prefixed properties? There's already switches between IE + non-IE touch in reveal.js and I really don't want to muddy the waters further by toggling between two version of IE touch.\n. Thanks for explaining @olivierbloch. IE 11 touch support has been merged.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Too bad they didn't keep the prefixed version around for at least one transitional version so we could avoid having conditional support.\n. reveal.js used to rely on negative offsets for centering slides and I am pretty certain that is the cause of this issue. The latest version in the dev branch has moved to a simpler method of centering so the issue should no longer exist there.\n. see https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#stretching-elements and https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#slide-backgrounds\n. I gave this a try in OS X Chrome but the PDF output size only grew by about 800k when I added a video. The entire demo presentation at lab.hakim.se/reveal-js came out at 1.1mb including a video which isn't bad. Here's the PDF http://cl.ly/110n2x0j2H1h</p>\n<p>I'm using Chrome on OS X, what OS are you using?\n. Hey, please see https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#presentation-size</p>\n<p>You'll need to configure width and height to <code>100%</code>, and set margin to <code>0</code>.</p>\n<p>Here's an example: http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js-full\n. Nice. Can you also remove the debug code (console logs) and add an example to the readme that uses the default slide attribute separator?\n. Thanks man! At work now but will merge this in shortly.\n. I've already pulled this into my local branch but haven't pushed it yet since I'm running into issues. Attributes are working in test but the following simple single-slide test doesn't work:</p>\n<p><code>html\n&lt;section data-markdown&gt;\n    &lt;script type=\"text/template\"&gt;\n        &lt;!-- slide-attributes: data-background=\"#ff0000\" --&gt;\n        ## Hello world\n    &lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;</code></p>\n<p>Also what do you think about bringing this and the element attribute syntax closer together? I'd like there to be some theme to this since there's getting to be a lot of different separator expressions.\n. That's meant to be element attribute syntax. Okay the usefulness of HTML comment syntax makes sense, so how about we define element attributes in the same way?</p>\n<p>``` html</p>\n<h2>Hello world <!-- element-attributes: class=\"fragment\" --></h2>\n<p>```\n. Thanks for fixing that. I've merged this in.\n. No, I'm referring to values in the URI's query string. It should be possible to do things like: http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/?autoSlide=5000&amp;loop=true&amp;controls=false</p>\n<p>Will be useful for debugging and sharing the presentation in a specific mode.\n. Completed.\n. Trying to keep all changes going through the dev branch so I added these in over there.\n. Controls are visible again in the dev branch c7077cf798326d820a520f2692c5ae29e2f7b4dd The controls are very small in that scaled down presentation though.\n. Tried, but it looks like this is impossible to fix. Thanks Apple.\n. Good call, but there's a few of these values that I don't want to display in the readme:\n- width, height, margin, mixScale, maxScale: since they have a separate <a href=\"https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#presentation-size\">dedicated section</a> in the readme.\n- rollingLinks: these are deprecated and I hope to remove them from the project entirely at some point.</p>\n<p>Can you amend the PR to remove those?\n. Merged, thanks!\n. Thanks but I prefer people cloning the repo independently of what IDE they're using, rather than reveal.js steering towards a specific IDE.\n. Not sure what you mean by display time, are you referring to the order of fragments? That can be controlled with the <code>data-fragment-index</code> outline here https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#fragments\n. Gotcha, no unfortunately that isn't possible. If you use auto-sliding all fragments will be given equal time in the slide.\n. That should still be possible though you may need to disable vertical centering in the reveal.js config(<code>center: false</code>). Let me know if that doesn't work.\n. In the latest version of Chrome (30) you can go to about:flags and enable the \"simplified fullscreen\" option to fix this. Another option is to use Safari, or reveal.js' server side version of speaker notes.\n. Support for per-fragment auto-slide timing was added a while back. It's possible throguh the following attribute:</p>\n<p><code>html\n&lt;ul&gt;\n    &lt;li class=\"fragment\"&gt;1&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li class=\"fragment\" data-autoslide=\"5000\"&gt;2&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li class=\"fragment\"&gt;3&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;</code>\n. Without that in place tables would inherit center alignment which is unexpected, so this normalization will stick around. Please use a more specific selector or the <code>style=</code> attribute to override it instead.\n. Can you post a link to an example where this happens please? It might be the <code>e.preventDefault();</code>.\n. Unfortunately that isn't supported. It would be possible, technically, but it's not something I'm interested in adding to the framework.\n. Yeah it works when the metamorph tags are removed. Not sure why but please re-open with additional info if you determine this is a bug in reveal.js.\n. thanks, took care of this while making another readme update\n. Looks good to me. Let's keep it simple to start with and just send those slide:start/slide:stop strings. Can be enhanced to pass any data if need be later on.\n. Closing, fix has been merged.\n. No, this isn't currently possible. This is a duplicate of #552 \n. Sorry but this isn't changing. I use Sass for all of my projects and want to keep that consistent. </p>\n<p>Sass isn't a hard requirement to use reveal.js so I don't see this dependency as a problem. It's only necessary when modifying the source files of the built in themes. Another route would be to just override what you want in a custom stylesheet using your personal preference of preprocessor.\n. Thanks but this has already been corrected over in the dev branch: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/tree/dev#fragments\n. That's a nice little enhancement. A few changes:\n- Change the class name to just 'center' to match the config value name\n- Add spacing inside of the parenthesis to match the reveal.js code style\n- Resubmit the pull request towards the dev branch rather than master</p>\n<p>Thanks!\n. Tried this on http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js using FF 17, 23 &amp; 27 running OS X 10.9 but wasn't able to reproduce. Still seeing the gradient background. Does this happen for you on all reveal.js presentations?\n. I tested and was seeing the same issue in Chrome OS X. Just pushed up a fix in 5e763bc67d140d1a41056c2e63f0fbe80c5d03ab</p>\n<p>Can someone who was experiencing this issue in Firefox give it another try against the latest code and let me know if it works there too?\n. Thanks for updating that, it's been merged in.\n. Not sure I understand what the question is. If it's related to a specific project and code outside of reveal.js, please ask it at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/reveal.js instead.\n. Thanks! Glad you found a fix for that. </p>\n<p>I only merge code changes towards the dev branch but since the delta was small for this I just manually copied it over.\n. Not reveal.js related.\n. I'm okay with referring to workarounds in the readme, but the correct workaround for this issue should be running a local web server. There are already instructions for getting a local server running here https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#full-setup</p>\n<p>Perhaps there's another resource on simpler server setups that can be referenced? The easiest setup I know for OS X is <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080</code>.\n. Updated the readme so that the local web server requirement is clearly pointed out  4068c5221d8550a78cd5ca8a9664b66f2cff1f54\n. Support for separate in/out transitions was added by @jammon in #1106 </p>\n<p>(only in the dev branch so far, will be released with 3.1)\n. Thanks, this is looking good. Two comments:\n- There's no need to check for the <code>data-ignore</code> attribute for this, since it's a custom event it won't have any effect unless listen to by the frame.\n- Please re-submit this towards the dev branch, that's where all changes go before eventually making their way to master as part of the next release.\n. This has been merged! Will go up on Slides with the next deploy, probably in a day or two.\n. This has been merged in. I made a few formatting tweaks and removed the image asset since there were already test images available.</p>\n<p>I also changed the <code>DEFAULT_ELEMENT_ATTRIBUTES_SEPARATOR</code> to match what you had in your test. I'm assuming most people aren't going to change this default value so figured it would be nice to have it be consistent in the repo.\n. Gotcha. So you prefer <code>{. }</code> over <code>{_ }</code> as the default? I'm fine with either. Let's amend the test to try both the default and custom regex.\n. Thanks, this makes perfect sense. Not sure why that's in there to begin with.</p>\n<p>Please re-submit the pull request towards the dev branch and I'll merge it in.\n. Is this still an issue? This isn't an environment I can test so would need someone else to debug.\n. You should be using the new slide <code>data-background</code> system, as opposed to <code>data-state</code>. There's more info about this here https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#slide-backgrounds. Those backgrounds get inherited to the vertical children of a horizontal parent slide.\n. Sure, you can do that by defining a <code>data-background</code> for the top slide in each vertical stack.\n. It's specific to that page, not sure what it does but this works:</p>\n<p><code>html\n&lt;iframe src=\"https://slid.es/#3520\" &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</code>\n. I tried out the markdown example you posted by adding it to reveal.js' markdown test page (e7e941b66363a70e04fd994439f32611a6a0a136) but I'm not seeing the indentation change as it did for you. Can you have a look at the commit and let me know how to reproduce the issue?\n. This was fixed by #721 \n. Thanks for reporting. I've patched this in the dev branch. a119c83f86ab5aed459757553e3aa27313f7c60a\n. I've update the implementation so that vertical slides will inherit the data-autoslide value of their horizontal parent. The priority/preference order is:\n1. Current slide's <code>data-autoslide</code>\n2. Parent slide's <code>data-autoslide</code>\n3. Global <code>autoSlide</code> config value\n. The error with is that your fallback value (<code>'0'</code>) is a string, should be a number:</p>\n<p><code>javascript\nautoSlide: Reveal.getQueryHash().autoSlide || 0</code>\n. Haven't had time to test this, and many other pull requests, due to being busy with other work. Will try to find some maintenance time soon. Code looks good from a quick glance.\n. Thanks for the PR, this has been merged with a few tweaks:\n- Config value renamed from <code>showSlideNumber</code> to <code>slideNumber</code> to match other naming\n- Moved the number to the right side of the screen to avoid it conflicting with the auto slide controls\n- Added the config value to the readme\n. Remove the \"fragment\" and \"cube\" attributes from your HTML and it will work.</p>\n<p><code>&lt;iframe controls data-fragment-index=\"2\" class=\"stretch\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/POVWltmphKc\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</code>\n. Great, thanks for that!\n. Sorry but you're gonna have to be more specific than this. Please open new issues if you can point to specific problems, and include steps to reproduce.\n. Hey, please post a link to an example presentation where this issue can be seen/tested.\n. Thanks for the link. Looks like the problem is your <code>fix-svg</code> class. I changed it like this and can see the svg:</p>\n<p><code>css\nsection &gt; ul &gt; li.fix-svg {\n  position: absolute;\n  left: 0;\n  top: 0;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n  list-style-type: none;\n}</code>\n. Piecon is awesome. Thanks for submitting the idea but I think the current progress bar is good enough.\n. Closing this in favor of #711 since it's the same issue and there's a live example there.\n. Thanks for the PR @ericweikl. I decided to go for a bigger rewrite instead (#721) to take care of multiple open issues concerning fragments, part of this centralizes the event dispatching to one place.\n. The fix for this has been merged.\n. Thanks, this looks good. Can you please resubmit the pull request against the dev branch? \n. Please make sure the test passes too, you can see the error log here: https://travis-ci.org/hakimel/reveal.js/builds/13765492\n. This works in OS X at least, <code>event.altKey</code> always returning false even it's pressed sounds like an issue outside of reveal.js.\n. Added a config value for this, example:</p>\n<p><code>javascript\nReveal.initialize({\n   ...\n   zoomKey: 'shift'\n})</code>\n. This was fixed by @gothma in #1205. The change is only in the dev branch so far but will go out with the next reveal.js version.</p>\n<p>For it to work you'll need to wrap TeX in a code block using backticks <code>$\\sum_{m} \\sum_{d}$</code>\n. Good idea and something I've been wanting to add as well.\n. That's right \u2013 this issue was for adding a preloader while content is still being loaded (lazily or otherwise) to prevent anyone from ever seeing a half-loaded presentation. Reopening.\n. see #721 \n. You'll need to include this script https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/index.html#L23 for it to load the right stylesheet.\n. This isn't a reveal.js issue, here's a fiddle with only the SVG from your deck which still exhibits the same problem: http://jsfiddle.net/EtL3w/. You'll need to define the width/height of your SVG explicitly.\n. Not yet possible but there's already an issue for adding this #572 \n. Thanks for the PR @gturri! There were a lot of open issues with fragments so I decided to go for a bigger rewrite instead (#721). If you can, please do submit the added fragment types as a new PR and I'll make sure to merge those in.\n. Right, if you have content inside of a slide <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> it is difficult to predictably align it to the edges of the screen. The best option is to configure your presentation size (and thus the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>'s) to fill 100% of the browser viewport: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#presentation-size.</p>\n<p>Fixed elements like a copyright notice you should be placed outside of the <code>&lt;div class=\"slides\"&gt;</code> container.\n. PDF exports now abide by the configured presentation width/height. Much of the PDF layout responsibility has moved from CSS to JS here: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/ddfb0aa86fdfc8e92d0b81fbe36dc79c4585dd86/js/reveal.js#L410-L474\n. Thanks for the suggestion, @JohannesBuchner. I think that's an interesting mode of presenting as well but there are already good tools specifically for non-linear presentations, like impress.js, so it's not something I think reveal.js should pursue.\n. This is a duplicate of #717 \n. Thanks @Wachiwi. Can you please resubmit this towards the dev branch? Also there's no need to include the built reveal.min.css file.\n. I see the same contents for both in Chrome for OS X:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"screen shot 2013-11-19 at 08 25 05\" src=\"https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/629429/1572504/2cfe0184-511e-11e3-9875-ed25dded2e2a.png\" />\n<img alt=\"screen shot 2013-11-19 at 08 25 25\" src=\"https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/629429/1572506/2f9aeeb6-511e-11e3-9b68-2d3df3ffebb1.png\" />\n. Sorry guys but I am at a loss with this one since I can't test it myself. Will leave the issue open for a while if anyone else is able to provide a CSS fix/workaround.\n. The fix for this has been merged and is in master.\n. Thanks, this has been merged.\n. Hey, sorry but this isn't the right forum for that question since it's related to jQuery animations. Please try http://stackoverflow.com/ instead.\n. reveal.js is more of a framework than it is a library, so I don't think packaging it in a way where it could loaded like a library makes sense. I'm mostly thinking about the quantity of files required, such as theme and print stylesheets.</p>\n<p>Another option to forking the repo is to use it as a git submodule. Easier to keep up to date that way.\n. Nice. This has been merged into the dev branch https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/commits/dev\n. Just merged this, thanks!\n. This is a great enhancement, thanks. Will merge it in soon.\n. Was merging this in to the dev branch but realized it's not compatible with the changes that have been made there. Namely the <code>cueAutoSlide()</code> method now overrides the <code>autoSlide</code> value that your patch was setting. That said, I rewrote it in a way that works with the new <code>cueAutoSlide()</code> method in 740f472ce247958eed5ae7eca0596f1745030f78.</p>\n<p>Thanks for suggesting the idea, it's a nice enhancement.\n. Hey, thanks for the feedback. I can see how this could be useful to you but it's a very specific use case and unfortunately not one I think merits an implementation in the reveal.js core. Instead I'd suggest writing custom JS for this, using the <code>fragmentshown</code> and <code>fragmenthidden</code> it shouldn't be too complicated.</p>\n<p>Here's a rough outline of what I'm suggesting. This was written from the top of my head so there may be syntax errors.</p>\n<p><code>javascript\nReveal.addEventListener( 'fragmentshown', function( event ) {\n  var audio = event.fragment.querySelector( 'audio' );\n   if( audio ) {\n    audio.play();\n  }\n} );\nReveal.addEventListener( 'fragmenthidden', function( event ) {\n  var audio = event.fragment.querySelector( 'audio' );\n   if( audio ) {\n    audio.pause();\n  }\n} );</code>\n. Good catch. I split that function in two now since the code which adds the \"future\" class to vertical slides should only run during startup. f7b612b1e4a916e5847cdf84be5628bd187a562f\n. See https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/726#issuecomment-29467384\n. You'll need to include the <code>?print-pdf</code> query string. See https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#pdf-export\n. You'll need to use iframes to embed presentations if you want many of them on one page.\n. Yes, you can change the presentation size using the width, height and scale configuration values. These are documented under \"presentation size\" in the readme.\n. iOS is most likely running out memory because of the size and content of the presentation. I recently added support for lazy loading in the dev branch to help address this. Please give that a try, it should help reduce the memory load.</p>\n<p>More info: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/dev/README.md#lazy-loading\n. Tried FF 23 and 27 on OS X but no issues there. Tested with http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/, which is 2.6.0.</p>\n<p>Any chance you are accessing your presentation directly via the filesystem? There are known issues with notes when it runs outside of a web server.\n. Gotcha, running directly off of the filesystem produces varying results based on which browser you're using. The correct workaround for this is to run a local web server. I've updated the readme to point this out and refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/tree/dev#full-setup\">full setup instructions</a>. </p>\n<p>4068c5221d8550a78cd5ca8a9664b66f2cff1f54\n. Merged with some tweaks.</p>\n<p>Sorry about taking forever to review this.\n. Merged this in \u2013 the unified syntax is much nicer and the code looks cleaner as well. Nice job.</p>\n<p>Will release this as 2.6.1 through master soon.\n. 2.6.1 is in master https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/releases/tag/2.6.1\n. Thanks for the suggestions but there no plans for updates to the leap plugin for now.\n. The default syntax for slide and element attributes is changing, see https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/tree/dev#element-attributes &amp; https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/tree/dev#slide-attributes</p>\n<p>If you want to override this default syntax to your own preference you can do so with the <code>data-attributes=\"&lt;regex&gt;\"</code> and <code>data-element-attributes=\"&lt;regex&gt;\"</code> attributes.\n. Good idea for a useful fragment style, this has been added to the dev branch.\n. Thanks for reporting. This has been fixed in dev \u2013 the fragment is now visible before being striked out.\n. All keyboard events are now captured inside of the notes window, so you no longer need to focus the current slide iframe for them to work. Only available in the dev branch so far but will make its way out with the next version.\n. Was considering merging this for a long time but I decided to amend the existing speaker notes instead of replacing it entirely. The updated plugin makes use of a the recently added getState/setState API methods for ensuring that everything is kept perfectly in sync between the two windows. It also works entirely via <code>postMessage</code> which enables notes to work entirely from the local filesystem (without requiring a local web server, #207). Also enabled keyboard navigation anywhere in the notes window, in a way that should work cross browser.</p>\n<p>https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/dev/plugin/notes/notes.js\nhttps://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/dev/plugin/notes/notes.html\n. Hey,</p>\n<p>The framework enforces primary content being horizontal with the optional addition of secondary vertical slides. This can't be changed through configuration.\n. Any idea what's causing this? Does it happen with all themes/fonts?\n. Cool, will close this since there's nothing actionable.\n. Great idea. Would love to have an overlay that shows all keyboard shortcuts.</p>\n<p>The <code>h</code> key is already used for navigation so let's go with <code>?</code> for this.\n. Yeah, but I'm picky about the graphical style of things. I was thinking this should look similar to the shortcuts screen on squarespace.com/logo:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"screen shot 2014-06-05 at 10 10 40\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/629429/3184720/12d21794-ec89-11e3-83ec-626f664c95ad.png\" />\n. Yep, this was released with 3.0 and can be tested by pressing the '?' key at http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js\n. Oh yeah, closed!\n. This is possible through auto-sliding, see the readme: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#auto-sliding</p>\n<p>It's not currently possible to time each fragment separately but there's another issue for that #653.\n. You'll need to wrap both elements in a single container which has <code>position: relative</code>. Then use <code>position: absolute</code> on the second fragment and position it on top of the other.</p>\n<p>This isn't included in the framework since, compared to all other fragments, it requires an additional DOM element.\n. Stepping through all fragments on the upcoming slide won't work since the focused slide may not have the same number of fragments, if any at all. Perhaps all fragments on the upcoming slide should be instantly visible?\n. Yeah I see what you mean. But in cases where the current slide doesn't have any fragments, or a different number of fragments compared to the upcoming slide, that won't work.\n. This behavior has changed in the revised version of the notes plugin which is available in the dev branch. The upcoming slide preview now shows the next fragment, when there are no upcoming fragments left on the current slide a preview of the next slide is shown.\n. Thanks but this was already fixed by #742\n. This looks great. Can you re-submit the pull request towards the dev branch?\n. Appreciate the pull request but I don't think there's a need for this to be built into the framework. Adding a fixed logo could be done by dropping this anywhere in the body:</p>\n<p><code>html\n&lt;img width=\"100\" style=\"position: fixed; top: 10px; right: 10px;\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.slid.es/logo/slides-logo-495x479.png\"&gt;</code>\n. I think this should be piped through the existing <a href=\"https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#slide-backgrounds\">slide background</a> functionality. You should be able to specify video backgrounds in the same way that you can currently specify images. For example:</p>\n<p><code>html\n&lt;section data-background=\"http://clips.vorwaerts-gmbh.de/big_buck_bunny.mp4\"&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;</code></p>\n<p>Backgrounds could also support iframes, which would enabled YouTube/Vimeo.\n. @vitorcarvalhoml The above is just how I'd like it to work. Haven't had time to start building it out yet.\n. I've made a lot of progress on this in the dev branch. Videos can now be defined through the <code>data-background-video</code> attribute and will play in fullscreen. Multiple video sources can be separated by commas, leading to reveal.js creating multiple <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> elements.</p>\n<p><code>html\n&lt;section data-background-video=\"http://clips.vorwaerts-gmbh.de/big_buck_bunny.mp4\" \n              data-background-color=\"#000\"&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;</code></p>\n<p>It's still missing a few configuration options but the core is there.\n. Closing. This is in master since 3.0 was released.\n. Thanks, this has been merged in.\n. Fixed in the dev branch.\n. You'll need to either <code>event.preventDefault()</code> in the toggleContent method or defined a void href such as <code>href=\"#\"</code>.\n. No problem :)\n. This has already been fixed by another pull request in the dev branch. Will get it into master soon.\n. This isn't supported and unfortunately there are no plans for adding support since it conflicts with vertical slides as well as vertical swiping on mobile devices.\n. Strange, does this happen on other systems/browsers too?\n. This and your other PR both look great. Can you please resubmit them towards the dev branch?\n. Great. The contribution guidelines were hard to find inside of the readme, I just separated them into a contributing file to make things clearer: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. Superseded by #766 \n. Superseded by #766 \n. Can confirm that this is an issue too. Hopefully this can be fixed through specificity of the override selectors, as opposed to duplicating the transition styles.\n. That seems to work well, trying it out some more now.\n. Okay this should be fixed now, please test and let me know if you notice anything wrong. Ended up using <code>:not([data-transition])</code>.\n. Thanks for this @Wachiwi. I've merged it in and added just little bit more padding around cells.\n. Add a center class to your <code>&lt;section class=\"center\"&gt;</code>\n. Gave this a try but it's working. This:</p>\n<p>``` html\n<section>\n    <h2>Heads Up</h2>\n    <p>\n        reveal.js is a framework for easily creating beautiful presentations using HTML.

Thanks for the PR but we're sticking to regular HTML compliance.\n. Good catch, this has been merged into the dev branch: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/commits/dev\n. Thanks for resubmitting. I've merged this in and made some smaller changes, in particular <code>isSliding</code> was renamed to <code>isAutoSliding</code> to be more explicit.\n. That's an okay limitation. <code>contenteditable</code> is turned on for those code blocks as an example for how one could make simple code tweaks inside of the presentation. They're not intended for adding so many line breaks that the content no longer fits on page :)\n. No, it's not currently possible to run the Slides editor offline. The intention is to address this with a standalone desktop app, though that hasn't been fully planned out yet.\n. Thanks for reporting, this has been fixed in 26e9ce1ff7d96601a83e2baa02e46699929ceada\n. Just tried this in the same build of Safari and the slide animations work for me when slide numbers are enabbled.\n. This is a good idea. I agree that the upcoming slide area should be used to show what the presentation will look like after one more navigational step \u2013 whether that be a new slide or an additional fragment appearing on the current slide.\n. This behavior has been implemented and will be included in the next release of reveal.js.\n. Thanks for the suggestion but I don't think this is a feature that needs to be embedded in the framework. I think it could be achieved through a bit of custom JS:</p>\n<p>Reveal.addEventListener('ready', function(){\n[].slice.call(document.querySelectorAll('ul li')).forEach(function(el){\n  el.classList.add('fragment');\n});\n});</p>\n<p>(written on a phone, there may be syntax errors)\n. No thanks. I'd rather add new fragment styles than reversing the existing ones.\n. I think it's okay to expect custom fragments to set opacity to 1 if they need to be visible from the start. The default behavior of a fragment is to be invisible and then appear, so it makes for anything that wants to change that behavior to override the defaults.\n. Thanks, this has been merged into the dev branch: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/commits/dev\n. Clicks on the timer inside of the notes window will now reset the time.\n. You mean just horizontally side-by-side? This works:</p>\n<p><code>html\n&lt;section&gt;\n    &lt;img width=\"300\" src=\"http://static.slid.es.s3.amazonaws.com/support/insert-video.png\"&gt;\n    &lt;img width=\"300\" src=\"http://static.slid.es.s3.amazonaws.com/support/insert-video.png\"&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;</code>\n. Looks like the layout is broken for you. The upcoming slide is supposed to be to the right of the current, as pictured here:\n<img alt=\"screen shot 2014-02-25 at 13 39 40\" src=\"https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/629429/2257448/037fd7d0-9e1a-11e3-9a82-4130861d306d.png\" /></p>\n<p>Perhaps your browser window was zoomed in?\n. I think this is the right call and have merged this into the dev branch.</p>\n<p>The minified JS and CSS is no longer tracked or referenced from any of the HTML files. From now on when the framework is checked out you'll be able to make edits directly in the non-minified files without having to recompile.</p>\n<p>Theme CSS is still tracked however, since I want reveal.js to work without running grunt.\n. This is a known issue, covered in #625 \n. There is an experimental and undocumented feature that might fit this use case. Try adding the following link in a presentation:</p>\n<p><code>html\n&lt;a href=\"http://hakim.se\" data-preview-link&gt;Hakim El Hattab&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>\n<p>When that is clicked reveal.js brings up a full screen overlay with an iframe showing the anchor URL. I built this in with the intention of reducing the amount of times one needs to exit/resume the presentation after viewing external resources. It's a hidden feature for the time being since I haven't decided whether or not to keep it. The overlay can't currently be triggered automatically when a slide is opened but that could easily be added.\n. @ahdinosaur took care of this in #869 \n. Anyone interested in trying to write a Grunt task for this?\n. This isn't the case when I test. Can someone refer to a presentation where this problem occurs or explain what's needed to recreate it?\n. Doesn't seem like this is going anywhere so I'm closing. If anyone's able to provide any info about or example of how to reproduce this I'll reopen.\n. Assuming this was submitted by mistake.\n. Thanks for the PR Aidan! This is very cool but unfortunately not something I think has a broad use case and belongs in the main repo. Maybe you could set up a separate repository with the code and link to it from the Plugins page https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Plugins?\n. I've noticed this becoming an issue in big presentations as well. Ideally there is some way on improving this in the core of reveal.js.</p>\n<p>Idea: On load, reveal.js could move the \"src\" attribute of media elements to \"data-src\". Then as you navigate the source attribute is changed back only for the nearest few slides.</p>\n<p>[edited the issue title]\n. Lazy loading support has been added and works with image, video and audio elements. This feature requires changes to presentation markup, more info in the readme: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/dev/README.md#lazy-loading\n. Unfortunately that's the only way to do it. If the presentation markup hits the browser with normal src attributes it's too late, the browser will already have started loading them. Otherwise they could have been replaced entirely via JS.\n. @akaleeroy Thanks, forgot about iframes but that's been added now.\n. @contra It's only available in the dev branch so far. There's still some work getting that branch to 3.0 before it will be merged into master, hopefully I can get back on that soon.\n. Thanks!\n. You'll need to escape those tags:</p>\n<p><code>html\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code data-trim&gt;\nsender = '\"Paul\" &amp;lt;example@address.com&amp;gt;'\nname = \"Paul\"\naddress = \"target@address.com\"\nreceiver = '\"%s\" &amp;lt;%s&amp;gt;' % (name, address)\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</code>\n. Thanks but I prefer the clarity and legibility of the existing mixins over the complexity of these more flexible methods.\n. This is actually mentioned already, see the end of the first paragraph here: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/README.md#speaker-notes\n. I actually don't have control over revealjs.jit.su, it was added as part of #98.</p>\n<p>@davidbanham any chance you could restart the server?\n. That was fast, thanks!\n. You should extend your display to use the projector as a secondary monitor, as opposed to having it mirror your desktop. That way you can keep the notes window open on your laptop screen and drag the actual presentation window to the projector screen.\n. Thanks for the PR but unfortunately this won't be merged. I want reveal.js to stay environment agnostic rather than catering for/suggesting a specific host or means of deployment. \n. You could increase the <a href=\"https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#presentation-size\">margin</a> around your slides, for example <code>Reveal.configure({ margin: 0.2 })</code>. </p>\n<p>Another option would be to offset the slides downwards slightly through CSS:</p>\n<p><code>.reveal .slides {\n  margin-top: 50px;\n}</code>\n. Thanks for the PR! These changes look good but they're being made against an out of date reveal.css. The latest development version of reveal.js is available in the <strong>dev</strong> branch. In there, tables are actually already centered. </p>\n<p>I hope you don't mind but I went ahead and replicated your changes (baa6fa45de2c4ebeb9212d1d0f2a692c246fb285) in the dev branch as opposed to asking you to submit a new PR towards the dev branch.\n. Nice work on the plugin \u2013 I added it to the wiki https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Plugins\n. Thanks for the PR but unfortunately this won't be merged. I had a look at the implementation but I think this feels more like a one-time solution rather than a plugin that would be useful to others.\n. This has been fixed in the dev branch by ensuring that the overview and pause modes are always kept in sync between the notes and main window. Not planning to add a semi-paused mode in the notes window with a special indicator.\n. Thanks for sharing! I'm sure that will be useful to someone else when trying to add a fixed header/footer.\n. There's currently no support for fullscreen video but I just wrote down some thoughts on how I'd like that to work in another ticket: #751\n. Seeing this too, I suspect you're right that this is related to a browser update.\n. Tracked this down. It's related to how the pdf stylesheet gets included. A temporary workaround is to replace the following lines in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> before printing:</p>\n<p><code>html\n&lt;script&gt;\n    document.write( '&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/print/' + ( window.location.search.match( /print-pdf/gi ) ? 'pdf' : 'paper' ) + '.css\" type=\"text/css\" media=\"print\"&gt;' );\n&lt;/script&gt;</code></p>\n<p>with </p>\n<p><code>html\n&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/print/pdf.css\"&gt;</code>\n. This issue has been fixed in master.</p>\n<p>PDF printing in Chrome 33 did not work correctly so long as <code>media=\"print\"</code> was defined on the dynamically inserted PDF stylesheet. The media definition has been removed which should be fine since the styles are only included when the page is loaded with <code>?print-pdf</code> anyway.\n. I tried printing lab.hakim.se/reveal-js using Chrome 35.0.1914.0 and that works.\n. Those of you who are still having issues, please make sure that the fix I committed above (08fb6cb2f96a6d97aaa21c35a925ebb59b0b0070) has been merged into your local index.html.\n. Thanks! I've merged this into the dev branch with two changes:\n- Added some base styles to all <code>pre code</code> blocks so that the layout doesn't change as much after highlight.js has loaded.\n- Removed language definition in index.html. Other people use the same index as the foundation for their presentations and I'd like that to still work out of the box with more languages.\n. I don't think this has a broad enough use case to merit adding to the core framework. That said, the following custom script should work for making audio inside of fragments play. Haven't tested it in a presentation with audio myself so apologies if there are any syntax errors.</p>\n<p><code>javascript\nfunction playCurrentFragment() {\n  [].slice.call( document.querySelectorAll( '.fragment' ) ).forEach( function( fragment ) {\n    var audio = fragment.querySelector( 'audio' );\n    if( audio ) {\n      if( fragment.classList.contains( 'current-fragment' ) ) {\n        audio.play();\n      }\n      else {\n        audio.pause();\n      }\n    }\n  } );\n}\nReveal.addEventListener( 'fragmentshown', playCurrentFragment );\nReveal.addEventListener( 'fragmenthidden', playCurrentFragment );</code>\n. I don't have a retina screen to test on but FF transitions are just as smooth as in Chrome on a MacBook Air. Are you seeing performance drops for a particular transition or all of them? The default transition uses 3D transforms for all slides so everything is most definitely offset to the GPU there.\n. IE9 doesn't support <code>classList</code> so you need to include a polyfill. This is already handled for you in the default index.html of reveal.js: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/index.html#L382\n. Tried IE 9 against the latest reveal.js version and it seems fine. I think there may be JS errors for you since you're initialize call doesn't include the classList polyfill which IE needs:</p>\n<p><code>javascript\nReveal.initialize({\ntransition: 'linear',\ntransitionSpeed: 'slow',\nprogress: false,\ncontrols: false,\ncenter: false,\nembedded: true,\nwidth: \"100%\",\nheight: \"100%\",\nmargin: 0,\ndependencies: [\n    { src: 'lib/js/classList.js', condition: function() { return !document.body.classList; } }\n]\n});</code></p>\n<p>The <code>center</code> option only affects vertical centering, there is no left-aligned mode.\n. 71f1780b50d1a1555aa00a84eeb77bc026249cca\n. This has been merged into the dev branch, see #816 \n. I don't have the hardware for testing this but the change set looks sane so I'll trust you on it :)\n. There's no sensitivity setting, only a threshold for how much time needs to pass before another slide can be triggered again from scrolling (600ms).</p>\n<p>Are you using OS X and have inertia scrolling turned on (default setting)? That setup is tricky since the scroll lasts for so long after you stop scrolling. I haven't figured out a good way of translating those dragged out scroll events into distinct slide steps but am open to ideas if anyone else can think of something.\n. This is already done in the dev branch 2aef97584a2c459d425d3ade55633120972c1ca7\n. Thanks for the PR but I prefer sticking to just the existing type of parallax effect.\n. Is this true when you try the speaker notes at http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js? I'm seeing the notes there in Chrome 33.0.1750.117/Mac.\n. I tried FF 25, 27 and 28 on a Mac but slide numbers work in all of those. Can you try this with a fresh, unaltered, copy of reveal.js?\n. No, you don't need to change anything. Please make sure all the files have been uploaded and check the browser's JavaScript console for errors.\n. thanks, corrected in e8ab2641daf519ea177443ca4fc356c7ff38ecf8\n. This had already been updated in the dev branch, I just cherry-picked the commit (55dceaaa0a6fa02f76384046ae1ba0d792d7f1ef) from there into master.\n. That's a really creative solution. Seems to be working very well.\n. Yikes \u2013 that looks terrible. I wonder what they changed.\n. The transition into and out of the overview mode has now been removed. It was cool and all but it has caused headaches before and now with it being even more broken in Chrome 34+ I think it's better to drop the transition in its entirety. It makes the overview more useful, although less pretty.\n. reveal.js forces the page to 100% width and height (https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/css/reveal.css#L47-L52). I'm guessing that's causing the problem with your footer.</p>\n<p>The idea is to eventually make reveal.js more friendly to being embedded inline on another pages, see #552.\n. This was fixed a while back, please see #808 and 08fb6cb2f96a6d97aaa21c35a925ebb59b0b0070</p>\n<p>Just updated lab.hakim.se/reveal-js with the fix too.\n. Very cool, thanks for sharing. Made some updates to the wiki and added it to the new plugins page: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Plugins\n. There's some info about that here https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Browser-Support\n. I recommend setting the <code>history</code> config value to false in your case.</p>\n<p>This did bring up an interesting issue though and I've made a few changes to restrict which characters reveal.js picks up for named links (a-z, 0-9 and basic punctuation). I've also patched an issue where a malformed hash in the URL would cause reveal.js to thrown syntax errors.\n. Thanks for the PR Ryan! Appreciate you taking the time to set this up but I'd prefer if it were hosted in a separate repository and referred to from the wiki (https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki). Trying to avoid code specific to a certain hosting platform inside of the main reveal.js repository.\n. Closing this since it's not an issue.\n. Hey, were you able to work this out? Unfortunately I can't offer to work on any special integrations for a specific JS library, there are too many out there. If there's a particular problem in reveal.js that prevents it from working with TimelineJS let me know.\n. Thanks for the PR, live reload has been merged and enabled through an earlier request #720</p>\n<p>Sorry about the delayed reply on this.\n. Making your list consume less than 100% of the available width fixes this. </p>\n<p>``` html\n<section id=\"websocket_revealed\">\n    <h2>WebSocket revealed</h2>\n    <div class=\"ulist\">\n        <img src=\"...\" alt=\"Websocket\" width=\"30%\" style=\"float: right\">\n        <ul style=\"width: 60%;\">\n            <li><p>Websocket revealed</p></p>\n<pre><code>            &lt;div class=\"ulist\"&gt;\n                &lt;ul&gt;\n                    &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full-duplex single&lt;br&gt;\n                        socket connection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n                    &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;HTTP request followed&lt;br&gt;\n                        by WebSocket data&lt;br&gt;\n                        Packets exchange&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n                    &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;ws:// and wss:// protocol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n                    &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developed part of HTML5 initiative&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n                    &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specification rfc-6455 (Dec-2011) managed by IETF Task Force&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n                &lt;/ul&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p></section>\n<code>``\n. That's there to avoid having code blocks grow so large that they can't fit on their slide. Can easily be overridden in custom presentation-specific styles (or directly on the element itself) if you want to though.\n. Thanks, this has been fixed by 6936c5029ea99f59dba423a6bc2e295e1ee505e4\n. This isn't something reveal.js supports. I prefer the font size being consistent across all slides.\n. Thanks for the PR. Changing the</code>display<code>mode isn't ideal since it affects the flow of content. I've applied the same fix using</code>visibility` instead: 7529f7eeb880f02bcfa5f8d85bf46d941f8a410f\n. Please paste the complete Markdown source for recreating this and I'll take a look.\n. This has been fixed (3d7c21256cee8dc96ce43b08c3776b277b93f0ba).\n. Specifying a height value doesn't mean each individual slide will be that exact size. The slides themselves are flexible in height and are only as tall as their content. The cube and paper transitions are exceptions to that rule since they both have a 700 pixel min height which is in place since they wouldn't look good with varying height slides. </p>\n<p>There's a bit more info about what the width/height config values do in the readme: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#presentation-size\n. What menu is this?\n. This sounds unrelated to reveal.js, there is no <code>&lt;ul class=\"nav\"&gt;</code> built into the project.\n. Yeah, as far as I know you'll have to stick to space for indentation.\n. Sorry but this isn't something that'll be added to the framework. I agree that in the case of lists it can get repetitive to add the same class repeatedly but I prefer that over adding more complexity to the fragment code/styles.\n. Yeah, definitely planning to merge this.\n. This has been merged into the dev branch and your commits can be found here: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/commits/dev.</p>\n<p>I tweaked where the status div gets updated so that we don't write to it twice for vertical slides. Also changed the ID of the element to something less likely to conflict with a user-defined ID.</p>\n<p>Thanks a ton for the work on this.\n. The video tag example is working for me in the same version of Chrome. It starts playing when entering the slide, and stops again when leaving it. </p>\n<p>The YouTube iframe example is busted, trying to figure out the issue there now.\n. Tried FF 27 too and had the same experience there: <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> works but not the YouTube iframe.\n. This has been fixed (in dev) \u2013 turns out embed URL's are now required to contain <code>enablejsapi=1</code> for the API to work. From now on reveal.js will inspect the presentation HTML and rewrite any YouTube URL that does not already contain the required flag.</p>\n<p>Also added support for Vimeo videos.\n. If you wanted a fixed/global header for all slides that would be best added as an element outside of reveal.js.</p>\n<p>Absolute elements inside of individual slides can only be reliably positioned within the dimensions of their parent slide. By default, the slides don't extend the full size of the screen so there is no way to put an element from within a slide in a position relative to the whole page. If this is important to a specific presentation it would be possible to achieve by telling reveal.js that each slide should consume 100% of the page width and height (https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#presentation-size). The trade-off with that configuration is that you have to handle your own page padding and responsiveness.\n. Good idea, this should exist in the API. The total number should exclude the vertical stacks though, otherwise a presentation with only three vertical slides would return a total count of four.</p>\n<p>Also please submit PRs to the dev branch in the future, thanks.\n. It's possible to have a fixed title for all subsections in a vertical stack. Set the <code>center</code> option to false and use the following markup:</p>\n<p><code>html\n&lt;section&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;Fixed title&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;section&gt;Slide 1&lt;/section&gt;\n    &lt;section&gt;Slide 2&lt;/section&gt;\n    &lt;section&gt;Slide 3&lt;/section&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;</code>\n. Fixed vertical section titles aren't a feature, they're a fortunate accident, so unfortunately I don't plan to try and support them in the overview mode. They also probably won't work with PDF printing.\n. What @dpashkevich described is the best way to drop the CSS 3D effects.\n. This is super helpful and solves an important problem.</p>\n<p>I've hoped to dig into flexbox for some time but haven't yet. I wonder if this could be used for all vertical centering so that the existing JavaScript layout could be removed. Do you know what browser reach it would be possible to achieve through a mix of old and new flexbox syntax?\n. Gotcha. I've added in your styles for vertically centered printing. Will give it a try for the normal vertical centering too (#625).\n. Turns out flexbox isn't a good solution for this since it affects the layout mode of its children (specifically forcing all children, no matter what display mode they are in, to stack in a column). This means that the printed version of a presentation can look different from the original slide layout which isn't ideal.</p>\n<p>Working on a JS-based solution to take its place: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/compare/dev...feature%2Fprint\n. It's mostly an issue with inline elements. For example:</p>\n<p><code>html\n&lt;h2&gt;Title&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;a&gt;Link 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;Link 2&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>\n<p>With normal CSS layout the two anchor tags will end up on one line next to each other. With flexbox the anchors are turned into flex items and stacked on top of each other.</p>\n<p>This might seem like an uncommon case but I'd really like to achieve a perfect match in the PDF output. Particularly in a case like <a href=\"http://slides.com\">Slides</a> where there are over 130k presentations with a wide variety of markup.</p>\n<p>It's too bad because I was hoping to use flexbox for all vertical centering even outside of printing to PDF. That said, the JS replacement for centering is almost complete and will produce the same output.\n. Seems like a good call \u2013 I've merged this into https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/commits/dev\n. Support for per-fragment auto-slide timing was added in the dev branch recently and will make its way to master with the next version of reveal.js. It's described here https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/tree/dev#auto-sliding\n. This should be possible using the <code>current-fragment</code> class which is only applied to a single fragment at a time. You can use that to apply whichever custom styles you want, such as scale and a change in color, and then once the class gets removed by reveal.js the element will revert back to its original styles.</p>\n<p>Not sure if it's relevant, but you can also nest fragments if you want to apply multiple effects to a single element.</p>\n<p><code>html\n&lt;div class=\"fragment grow\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"fragment highlight-red\"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"fragment grow\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"fragment highlight-blue\"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>\n. There's an entirely new JavaScript-based PDF layout in the dev branch which fixes this amongst a few other PDF issues.\n. In your <code>Reveal.initialize</code> call, change the <code>history</code> option to true and it'll start updating the URL.\n. Hey, sorry but I've never built anything for Android so I can't offer any insight as to how their web views are best configured.\n. Feels sad to move away from the more elegant <code>var Reveal = (function(){</code> but I guess one has to go with the times :P This has been merged into the dev branch will make its way out with the next major release.</p>\n<p>https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/commit/613a05f1544d21d5a16ffcefd960c24daec91873\n. This is a new bug, it's been reported in #856 but no solution in sight so far.\n. This would only work with the default theme and break support for the others. It also removes the theme gradient background for those of us who don't currently have any issues with artifacts in exported backgrounds.</p>\n<p>Hopefully there's a way we could apply a static background color for only the affected systems.\n. The default style of fragments is to fade in but there are also other styles of fragments, including ones that change color of text or use a transform to animate. This change would only work for the default style of fragments so unfortunately I can't merge it.</p>\n<p>The next version of reveal.js includes an updated speaker notes plugin which does a better job at previewing upcoming fragments.\n. Yeah, there's small plugin for/example of using phantom for PDF exports here: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/plugin/print-pdf/print-pdf.js\n. This issue has been fixed in the dev branch by dropping the transitions in the overview mode. Wasn't able to find another solution and removing the transitions has the upside of being less likely to crash mobile browsers.\n. Yeah, it stopped working in Chrome 34. More info: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/874#issuecomment-40791944\n. This has been patched in the latest dev version, see: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/874#issuecomment-40791944\n. By disable do you mean preventing all reveal.js interactions? You could use <code>Reveal.removeEventListeners()</code> for that. Let me know if there's something else that you're trying to disable.\n. Thanks for the PR. Nested fragments were a fortunate accident when originally adding support for fragments and I don't think it makes sense to add new functionality specifically around them. </p>\n<p>However we recently added a \"current-fragment\" class which enables temporary styling of a fragment and should satisfy your use case. To replicate your example you'd use the following markup:</p>\n<p><code>html\n&lt;section&gt;\n    &lt;span data-fragment-index=\"1\" class=\"fragment current-visible\"&gt;One&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span data-fragment-index=\"2\" class=\"fragment current-visible\"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span data-fragment-index=\"3\" class=\"fragment current-visible\"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span data-fragment-index=\"4\" class=\"fragment current-visible\"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;</code></p>\n<p>This is only briefly mentioned in the readme, might revisit that.\n. Could you include the HTML of your presentation please? Mostly interested in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>.\n. I see. This is a different problem though \u2013 he's trying to print to PDF, not paper.\n. Filed a new issue for paper.css not being included #881\n. The head looks good. If you look at the browser network logs, do you see any errors when trying to load the pdf.css? For whatever reason that file is not loading at all for you, judging by the screenshot.</p>\n<p>One more thing, the URL you're using when printing looks inaccurate. Try http://localhost:8000?print-pdf (\"print-pdf\" before the hash).\n. @zzatkin Normal or PDF printing? Normal printing was broken but has been fixed in #881. The demo hasn't been updated.\n. Fixed in dev. The new print include script is:</p>\n<p><code>javascript\nvar link = document.createElement( 'link' );\nlink.rel = 'stylesheet';\nlink.type = 'text/css';\nlink.href = window.location.search.match( /print-pdf/gi ) ? 'css/print/pdf.css' : 'css/print/paper.css';\ndocument.getElementsByTagName( 'head' )[0].appendChild( link );</code>\n. No plans for adding a command line utility as part of this project. I'm sure someone else might find that useful but I think it would be better suited for a separate project that consumes reveal.js.\n. Really wish this was possible but unfortunately there's no way to interpolate the CSS transitions that reveal.js use based on an interaction in JavaScript.\n. Sorry but this won't get merged, I don't like the repeated lookups of <code>.print-pdf</code> in each key listener. Also as far as I can tell the current END key implementation already takes you to the last slide.\n. I've updated the PDF print styles to hide slide numbers as well as the auto-play controls. Thanks for the heads up. Does the END key work for you on http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js?\n. Thanks but no need to download again to test if it works in the online example. It's possible that there's an issue in the current stable release of reveal.js that has since been fixed (the version on lab.hakim.se is the latest in-development version).</p>\n<p>As for slide numbers I agree that a total would be great but it's tricky to add with the current slide number format: \"[horizontal slide number] - [vertical slide number]\". I'm probably going to change this to a flattened slide number for both horizontal and vertical slides so that we can use \"[current] / [total]\".\n. Sorry but I don't want to include every possible theme option from highlight.js as a separate file directly in this repo.</p>\n<p>The latest version of highlight.js has already been added to the reveal.js dev branch.\n. No, as far as I know this is not possible using markdown.\n. Sorry but I can't think of an easy way of adding that and don't want to make the existing code overly complex for a niche feature.\n. Custom styles are required if you want to adjust text alignment:</p>\n<p><code>html\n&lt;style&gt;\n    .reveal .slides {\n        text-align: left;\n    }\n    .reveal .slides section&gt;* {\n        margin-left: 0;\n        margin-right: 0;\n    }\n&lt;/style&gt;</code>\n. Grunt and the <code>serve</code> task isn't needed for multiplexing but you do need to have node running the multiplex server as described in the readme. Unfortunately node/grunt setup errors for a given OS isn't anything that I can help with, I'm terrible with anything but OS X.\n. This was fixed just a few days ago. The fix is only available in the dev branch yet but will make its way out with the next release. Also, step 3 in your description shouldn't be necessary any longer as keyboard shortcuts now work anywhere in the notes window.\n. Hey, tables shouldn't have a <code>.reveal</code> class attached to them. The \"reveal\" class name is reserved exclusively for the main container of the whole presentation. The default table styles have been updated quite a lot in the dev branch recently and when I try out the markdown you posted it seems to render correctly there:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"screen shot 2014-05-01 at 09 04 00\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/629429/2850459/d3afb10c-d0fe-11e3-9c16-32645fa186c0.png\" /></p>\n<p>The most recent table styles are pasted below. You can either inject those into your reveal.css or start using the dev branch.</p>\n<p>``` css\n.reveal table {\n  margin: auto;\n  border-collapse: collapse;\n  border-spacing: 0;\n}</p>\n<p>.reveal table th {\n  font-weight: bold;\n}</p>\n<p>.reveal table th,\n.reveal table td {\n  text-align: left;\n  padding: 0.2em 0.5em 0.2em 0.5em;\n  border-bottom: 1px solid;\n}\n<code>``\n. Sure, you can use</code><section ... data-background-size=\"contain\">` to make backgrounds fit inside rather than crop.\n. This is should take care of that:</p>\n<p><code>html\n&lt;section ... data-background-size=\"contain\" data-background-color=\"#000000\"&gt;</code>\n. Thanks for the PR but this is already supported, see this line: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L3\n. Support for this was added in the dev branch a while back. The version on my site is an old version of what was on the dev branch so it could be this has been broken since. I don't have any Windows touch devices to test on so if anyone else wants to take this on, please do.</p>\n<p>Event listeners: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/dev/js/reveal.js#L3418-L3452\nEvent listener binding: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/dev/js/reveal.js#L808-L820\n. Strange that it's not working for you in the dev branch, since that's where this feature was added. Can you try http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/ again? I just updated it to the latest version.\n. Yeah, the overview mode transition broke with the release of Chrome 34. More info: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/874#issuecomment-40791944\n. I've fixed this by relaxing the condition which was used to block keyboard events while certain elements, like input fields, are focused. To be honest I'm not sure why that was checking for the existence of href in the first place so we'll have to watch out for any possible regression.\n. All changes to reveal.js are made to the dev branch before being merged into master with the next release: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/commits/dev\n. Been wanting to fix this in zoom.js for a while and just got around to it. I've updated the plugin in reveal.js so the zoomed viewport is now centered around the target element.\n. Embedding a presentation as only a part of a page without using iframes is currently not supported but there's an issue filed for it already: #552.</p>\n<p>It is possible to hack this through custom CSS as we have done in Slides: http://slides.com/hakim/india-nepal-2014/</p>\n<p>You'll need to set the overflow and height of the html and body elements to auto. You'll also need to wrap the .reveal div in a container and give that container an explicit height (the height of your hero area). That's from the top of my head so it's possible there's something else I've missed.\n. Created a quick example of this: https://gist.github.com/hakimel/9e233239b35cf5247a4e</p>\n<p>The reveal.js background color/gradient gets applied to the body element so I had to disable that and set a solid color background instead.\n. Hey \u2013 this is a known limitation since the backgrounds feature relies on JS and the IE8 mode of reveal.js can't actually run the reveal.js code. Unfortunately I don't have any plans for investing more time in a better fallback for a browser as old as IE8.\n. That's right \u2013 previous/next classes were intended for the one slide that comes directly before and the one slide that comes directly after the current slide. Whereas past/future applies to ALL prior or later slides. </p>\n<p>That said, I opened this in 2014 and haven't needed it since so will close :). The <code>data-background-size</code> attribute for reveal.js' full screen background images supports all CSS background sizing options. The default we're using is 'cover' but if you set it to <code>initial</code> the image will never be scaled. There's no guarantee the whole image will be visible when disabling scaling but I don't think a panning feature has broad enough use to warrant adding to the framework.\n. - Does the /css/print/pdf.css file exist where you're testing this?\n- Did you include ?print-pdf in the URL?</p>\n<p>If both of those are true, could you upload this presentation somewhere so I can debug?\n. Glad that fixed it. Those instructions are outdate since having ?print-pdf didn't used to be a requirement. I've updated the docs to cover this here: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/tree/dev#pdf-export</p>\n<p>Will copy that over to the main readme soon.\n. Answered this on SO: http://stackoverflow.com/a/23539399/1601643\n. @maxmeyer Haven't had the time to test this or review the code yet but noticed the PR is pointed to the wrong branch, all pull requests should be made towards the dev branch.\n. There are no slides in that deck. See the readme: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#markup</p>\n<p><code>html\n&lt;div class=\"reveal\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"slides defaultContainer\"&gt;\n        &lt;section&gt;\n            &lt;img src=\"http://website.com/public/app/img/logo-black.png\" alt=\"\"&gt;\n        &lt;/section&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</code>\n. Hey, this issue has already been reported. Please see https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/874#issuecomment-40791944\n. Thanks, this has been merged.\n. Yeah, all markup will hit the browser before we can pick it up with JS and parse which can have negative side effects. We use highlight.js for syntax highlighting and agree with their recommended workaround which is to escape your HTML entities: https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js/issues/73\n. Did this make reveal.js throw an exception?</p>\n<p>I'd prefer checking for valid selectors and ensuring we don't throw errors. If we drop the <code>hashchange</code> listener when <code>history</code> is configured to false, it'd affect support for internal links to other slides.\n. Turns out I had already fixed this issue in the dev branch and forgotten about it :D</p>\n<p>Anyhow, I've updated the code slightly so that it validates the ID against HTML 4 ID attribute rules rather than try...catching.\n. The dev version of reveal.js is using the latest version of highlight.js and the zenburn CSS was updated as part of that change (d939c4790e25b1a444c416327d568ea9013396e0). I had forgotten to update the file on the my server but that's been done now so it highlights as intended.\n. Thanks for the PR. I think this would better live separately from the reveal.js core. Please see my comment here: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/pull/995#issuecomment-61786262\n. There's already an open issue for this: #572 \n. What you're seeing is on lab.hakim.se is the latest in-development version of reveal.js. The source of that be found here: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/tree/dev</p>\n<p>In the development branch the linear transition was renamed to slide. A lot of other changes have also been made to that version of the framework and it seems that the issue you originally experiencing has been fixed there. Those changes will eventually be merged into master but you can checkout the dev branch and use that in meantime.\n. The table styles haven't been deleted, they are only available in the dev branch so far but will make their way to master later on.\n. PDF printing has seen a major update/rewrite in the dev branch and this issue has been fixed as part of that.\n. I tried adding some GLSL shader transitions through CSS filters a while back but decided to delete them in the end since they looked too gimmicky. I prefer the existing whole-slide transitions.\n. I've never tried it myself but as far as I know it's possible, here's an example from another reveal.js user: http://ptamarit.com/slides-data-viz-web-d3/en/#/example-bind-result\n. This behavior has recently changed in the dev branch. There are no more explicit widths or heights defined in the CSS there, layout is handled mostly through JS instead so that the configured with/height of the presentation can be maintained. It also allows for single slides to spread across multiple pages if they're too tall.\n. The 'blood' theme is now included on that slide.\n. @callahad Thanks for debugging this. I've updated the default slide separator regex as you suggested.</p>\n<p>Closing.\n. Fullscreen iframe embeds aren't supported yet, will added as part of #751 \n. Am I correct in assuming both of these points are addressed by this pull request: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/pull/854?\n. Gonna assume that #854 covered this, it makes content available to screen readers and adds aria-hidden to all non-present slides.\n. The print version of reveal.js runs one-time JavaScript layout code as the presentation loads. It can't be toggled on or off repeatedly within the same session. Also I don't think PDF printing needs to be exposed more easily since it's a feature aimed only for the author, not consumers of the deck.\n. Made small tweak to this, when you configure <code>{history: true}</code> reveal.js will now write the current slide number to the hash. Unfortunately I can't think of a way to clear the hash when history is toggled off.\n. There's an existing ticket for this: #743 \n. The A key can be used to toggle auto-sliding on or off. This shortcut was added pretty recently though, so it's only available in the dev branch so far.\n. Thanks, I don't accept pull requests directly into master so went ahead and fixed this in a new commit towards the dev branch.\n. The reason it isn't set up this way currently is that all future slides are hidden \u2013 which, if I remember correctly, makes it impossible for MathJax to properly lay out equations.\n. It's now possible to reset the speaker notes timer by clicking on it.</p>\n<p>Thanks for the PR and sorry about the late reply!\n. Fixed by @davidbanham in #959 \n. This has been merged with a few tweaks. Thanks!\n. Thanks for the PR @rajgoel. This is a very cool plugin and one that I'm sure is useful to many others. It has a clear use case and the implementation looks great.</p>\n<p>The reveal.js repository has started growing too large and hard to maintain so I have decided not to merge plugins directly into it anymore, and to eventually move out the existing plugins to separate repos. Summarized my thoughts on this here: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Plugin-Guidelines</p>\n<p>That said I'm gonna close this request but I hope you're open to keeping the plugin around in your own repo. \n. Very cool, thanks for the PR. I think this one is better kept as a separate repo considering the amount of code it adds as well as it relating to a specific technology that few people have access to. Feel free to submit a PR that refers to it in the readme if you want.</p>\n<p>In general, this is a direction I'd like to stick to with reveal.js going forward \u2013 there are a few too many plugins baked into this repo right now that should be separated into new repositories to make this one easier to maintain.\n. From the sound of it the iframe is loaded but some elements inside of the frame do not appear? reveal.js doesn't have control over what goes on inside of the frame I'm not sure how to proceed with this. Let me know if you discover a specific issue or limitation in how iframes are handled on the reveal.js side and I'll look into it.\n. Thanks! This is really useful. Merged with two minor changes:\n- The attribute was renamed to <code>data-prevent-swipe</code> to match other reveal.js arguments which are prefixed with \"data-\".\n- The internal method was renamed from <code>preventSwipe</code> to <code>isSwipePrevented</code>. The first name sounded like the method itself was preventing swipes when it was just checking.\n. @maxmeyer Good catch \u2013 it wasn't but I just added it in a151df54be33894a4b06c3a0bc9b51524db77e2c.\n. There's no way to configure reveal.js to do this. The easiest local solution would be editing the reveal.js source. Change \"navigateNext\" to \"navigateRight\" on this line: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/js/reveal.js#L2497\n. This has been fixed in the dev branch by removing the transitions into and out of the overview mode.\n. Thanks for the plugin @e-gor! I've decided not to merge any more plugins directly into the core reveal.js project since it's getting increasingly difficult to maintain the growing codebase. Existing plugins will be moved out eventually as well.</p>\n<p>I hope you still want to keep the plugin around in your own repo so others can use it. If you want, feel free to add a link to it on the plugins page: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Plugins,-Tools-and-Hardware</p>\n<p>Sorry about the late reply. Still have a lot to catch up on :S\n. Great stuff, @e-gor.</p>\n<p>I've decided not to merge any new plugins directly into this repository anymore to keep things maintainable, more info in another reply here: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/pull/956#issuecomment-118035939\n. There's no style for this so you'd need to add your own. Something like:</p>\n<p><code>css\n.reveal .slides section .fragment.grow-current {\n    opacity: 1;\n    visibility: visible;\n}\n.reveal .slides section .fragment.grow-current.current-fragment {\n    -webkit-transform: scale( 1.3 );\n       -moz-transform: scale( 1.3 );\n        -ms-transform: scale( 1.3 );\n         -o-transform: scale( 1.3 );\n            transform: scale( 1.3 );\n}</code>\n. Thanks! This has been merged into the dev branch.\n. This is fixed in the dev branch. All cross-window communication happens through <code>window.postMessage</code> now, as opposed to relying on <code>window.opener</code>: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/dev/plugin/notes/notes.js\n. Sounds like a good idea but not something for the core of reveal.js. Would be best built as a plugin.\n. PDF exports were rewritten in the latest dev version of reveal.js, that rewrite added support for vertical centering amongst other things. Can be tested here: http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/?print-pdf</p>\n<p>Will make it's way to the master branch eventually.\n. Thanks for the PR and sorry about the super late reply. </p>\n<p>I took a different direction with this, there's now a <code>showNotes</code> config value which makes it possible show notes on top of the deck both online and in PDF exports. More info: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/README.md#share-and-print-speaker-notes\n. The slide number format is now configurable using variables. For example, to display \"indexh / indexv\" you would use `Reveal.configure({ slideNumber: 'h / v' })'.</p>\n<p>The default behavior has been changed to showing a flattened index, rather than that \"indexh - indexv\" split. </p>\n<p>More info: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/tree/dev#slide-number\n. I just revised how this works. The variable substitution approach I first implemented wasn't great since it meant it always showed the vertical slide number even if there were no vertical slides. Instead we now support a number of preset formats which are listed here: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#slide-number</p>\n<p>The slide numbers are now wrapped in markup so that you have more control over the style. This also allows you to substitute the delimiter using CSS (:before/:after pseudo elements).</p>\n<p>Slide numbers work in PDF exports now too!\n. Unfortunately no.\n. Ran into this problem when working on the live streaming features for slides.com as well. Should now be fixed by cbef64b860e75e010a383543de3c5f478fc4227a\n. Hey, the slides.com editor isn't open source.\n. I prefer navigation staying the same when going forwards and backwards since there's less logic/special casing involved.\n. There's nothing like this built in to reveal.js. You'd need to write a custom script that monitors all user interaction events on the page (mouse, key, touch), and once there's a been a long enough idle time call <code>Reveal.toggleAutoSlide( true )</code> to resume auto-sliding\n. This has been fixed: 136d27936141586ddd16e78a3bfa44f2ea2f25fb\n. Thanks! This has been merged into the dev branch.</p>\n<p>https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/commits/dev\n. Calling <code>Reveal.sync()</code> will recreate the backgrounds based on the current attributes in the DOM.\n. I tested this in the dev and master branches, in both and Chrome and Firefox, and it worked in all cases. Here's the markup:</p>\n<p><code>html\n&lt;section data-markdown&gt;&lt;script type=\"text/template\"&gt;\n- One &lt;!-- .element: class=\"fragment\" --&gt;\n&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/section&gt;</code>\n. A <code>toggleAutoSlide</code> API method was already added for this purpose. By default it toggles auto sliding to the opposite of its current state. Calling <code>Reveal.toggleAutoSlide(true)</code> will always resume, calling <code>Reveal.toggleAutoSlide(false)</code> will always pause.</p>\n<p>This isn't available in the master branch yet.\n. Closing, IP address/local network config isn't related to reveal.js. \n. The default behavior for this has changed in more recent versions of grunt-connect. They now bind to 0.0.0.0 by default, rather than localhost, which allows you access the server from another host via IP: https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-connect/issues/60. I've updated the version that reveal.js uses and tested from inside a VM to confirm.\n. You'll need to switch to the 'dev' branch to try the video background feature. I don't have the time to finish it's implementation now but will resume whenever I can.\n. Let's stick to referencing the repo like @nmec pointed out, saves us one additional config file.\n. Thanks for the PR. Couldn't find a clean way to merge this so added the changes in a new commit: 1f5369a43ec9d690298c633fcb6c0d595bb1ca04\n. We don't support automatic resizing of text based on the length of the string. reveal.js simply scales the entire presentation down (or up) uniformly to fit the browser window size.\n. You're right \u2013 the existing version of the font was subset. I've generated new versions of these font files and tested with some sample Polish text to confirm that it works.</p>\n<p>The files were updated in the dev branch, it'll make its way into master with #1093\n. Unfortunately that's not possible due to how slides are laid out to only cover a portion of the screen. One workaround is to use states: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#states</p>\n<p>Associate a state with the given slide </p>\n<p><code>html\n&lt;section data-state=\"show-github-ribbon\"&gt;</code></p>\n<p>Then apply custom CSS to show/hide the ribbon based on that class:</p>\n<p><code>css\n.ribbon { display: none; }\n.show-github-ribbon .ribbon { display: block; }</code>\n. Good catch. I've patched this so that the notes window will no longer try to open itself when the S key is pressed.\n. I recently rewrote how PDF exports are laid out and one improvement as part of that is that slides that are too tall are now allowed to be printed across multiple pages. Using the slide you referenced as an example, the image would appear on the following page (I tested by copying your markup).</p>\n<p>Only in the dev branch so far. Hopefully I can get around to wrapping up 3.0 soon.\n. I picked sections as opposed to classes or attributes since I wanted the markup to be clean. This was back when the project started and there weren't any features relying on attributes for configuration. I like the way it works now. There's also a whole lot of content that relies on this staying the same so I don't see any reason to change it.</p>\n<p>They still render in the IE8 fallback, so point 2 isn't a problem.\n. Thanks for the PR. I'd really prefer big optional features like this to live separately from the core reveal.js framework. The more features that are added to the framework, the more difficult it gets to maintain and the more difficult it gets for people to learn their way around. In general, there's already a few too many plugins with very specific use cases baked into this repo that I would like to externalize.</p>\n<p>Some external plugins are currently listed in the <a href=\"https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Plugins,-Tools-and-Hardware\">plugins &amp; tools wiki page</a>, feel free to add this there.</p>\n<p>If you have any ideas for changes to the reveal.js core that would make it easier to build external plugins I'd love input.\n. There are many limitations around when audio is allowed to play, for instance it can not play on mobile without being invoked by a user interaction. Unfortunately this is all outside of the scope of reveal.js.\n. Thanks for sharing!\n. This works when testing against a fresh copy of either the master or dev branch. Can anyone link to an example presentation where it's not working?\n. @darenwelsh The requirement for the <code>print-pdf</code> query is included in the PDF printing instructions at https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#pdf-export</p>\n<p>Everyone who's had problems with this; can you please try printing a PDF from http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js?print-pdf and let me know if it still only prints one page? There's been some significant changes to how PDFs are laid out in reveal.js 3.0.\n. Thanks for testing that @humrochagf\n. Thanks @ISO50, that's really useful. </p>\n<p>Transitions now use a flat transform-style by default, so content should no longer be blurred when using the slide, none or fade transitions. Other transitions \u2013 like concave and convex \u2013 still use preserve-3d.\n. General Markdown syntax is outside the scope of this project \u2013 we rely on <a href=\"https://github.com/chjj/marked\">marked</a> for our all of our Markdown parsing.\n. Thanks for reporting. Just fixed this in the dev branch: f28b380fac76583c1572c82abc229b49f54dc2fc\n. This is the same as #1001 </p>\n<p>Edit: There's an explanation and fix in one of the comments of the above ticket.\n. Nope, this isn't something that's supported. Code gets processed by highlight.js and wrapping tags around that input would interfere with the highlighting.\n. Thanks! This has been merged in with one more change on top: the main reveal.js styles are now SCSS rather than plain CSS.\n. After adding new content you can call <code>Reveal.sync()</code> to make reveal.js recognize it.</p>\n<p>To resume auto-sliding call <code>Reveal.toggleAutoSlide( true )</code>.\n. Thanks for the PR but I don't want to add the additional wrapper inside of each slide so this won't be merged.</p>\n<p>I wish there was a way to vertically center without additional wrappers... Have been experimenting with flexbox but even then I've been unable to make it work, due to the vertical slides and scaling of slides.\n. So, if I understand this correctly, the proposal is to add two new classes that flag if a slide is either horizontal or vertical?\n. There's no formal structure for how to author plugins though that's something that I want to define to make the project scale better. Current plugins are just thrown in a folder (/plugin) and injected via the built-in dependency loading: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#dependencies</p>\n<p>Feel free to use the reveal.js name.\n. Unfortunately I can't offer any platform-specific support, if you discover this is caused by a bug in reveal.js please let me know and I'll reopen.\n. It shouldn't matter what network the presentation is loaded over. Can you include a link to this presentation so that I can test from here?\n. Thanks for letting us know. Can't offer any advice for network issues in general.\n. This was caused by a bug in the method that checks the current fragment index. It has been fixed in the dev branch: cbef64b860e75e010a383543de3c5f478fc4227a\n. Fixed here https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/dev/README.md#parallax-background\n. This has been improved. Going forward only the speaker controls area will scroll when notes are too long to fit.\n. Thanks for the input but I'm gonna stick to a sliding transition. The current version of the new default theme uses the flat sliding transition rather than the previous 3D rotation.\n. Preview of the new default theme: http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js-3.0.0/</p>\n<p>Still tweaking but that's the general direction of it.\n. Fixed in dev in #1844 . Thanks for the PR but there's no need to change those.\n. Thanks for the idea. Unfortunately not something I want to build into the framework. This kind of logic gets complex since slides can contain any combination of content.\n. The upcoming preview works with vertical slides when I test. </p>\n<p>Is this an issue if you try the speaker view on http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/?\n. Duplicate of #1014 \n. Sorry but I can't assist with the integration of specific libraries. I don't know how JXSGrapth works.\n. Thanks!\n. This has been merged, the fix for navigatePrev wasn't working but I rewrote that.\n. Everything should work offline with the exception of fonts loaded from Google and external images used in the default content. The default heading font is included in the repository and other fonts should have decent fallbacks. Other options include using a theme with more generic fonts or installing the required fonts from Google on your local computer.\n. There's no support \u2013 or plans for adding support \u2013 for Prezi-like layouts. I think those can be great for some presentations but trying to add it to reveal.js would risk making the framework too complex.</p>\n<p>It is however possible to zoom in on specific content within a slide. Try holding the alt key and click on the quote on this slide: http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/17\n. So the bug here is what @bennettscience summarized \u2013 as soon as you define a \"backgroundTransition\" value at initialization it can not be overridden via the data-background-transition attribute. I tested and this isn't the case with the slide transitions.</p>\n<p>@aseemk I had the same thought regarding the transition names a while back and gave the default slide transition an alias of 'convex' so that they match up. Though this is not available in master yet.\n. Fixed by #1037 \n. Thanks!\n. No plans for this but anyone is free to create one. Ideally externally to this repo since it's for a fairly specific use case (the leap plugin should be moved out too).\n. dupe of #1000 \n. highlight.js was updated with Handlebars support in the dev branch: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/dev/plugin/highlight/highlight.js\n. That's strange. Sorry but I don't know why reveal.js would conflict with this.\n. Hey \u2013 I'm not sure what the question is here, but it does seem specific to your contents. This place is for reporting reveal.js issues or feature requests. If you think this is a bug please elaborate.\n. This does not appear to be a reveal.js issue \u2013 I tested to be sure. The Firefox screenshot is using the SlideShare iframe example from the default reveal.js index file. Please try restarting your web server and clearing your cache.\n. I wouldn't assume this is a problem for all of China. It could be any number of local network issues.</p>\n<p>Almost all fonts are loaded from Google so there's not much that be done about that except overriding styles and using system fonts. The latter (http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/13872948) is just an iframe I use in the example presentation so that shouldn't matter once you write your own content.\n. Not sure what this means. What would need to change in reveal.js to fix this?\n. Thanks for the heads up @aCandidMind, will close this and refer to the article in the comment above.\n. Fixed by @fehmer in #1149\n. I've addressed this in the new default theme for reveal.js 3.0. The new default uses Source Sans Pro which is also included with the repository. More info: 06ad3bf4c2692baf758c9ed3bd4b3bb8be1940c1\n. If I read your edit correctly, there is no issue with vertical slides in PDFs so I'll close this.</p>\n<p>Edit: May be related to #929\n. It most likely has not changed since then \u2013 searched through issues and I believe #929 is the issue you are encountering.\n. Hey! The reveal.js repository has started growing too large and hard to maintain so I have decided not to merge plugins directly into it anymore. The plan is to move existing plugins out of the repo too. More info: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Plugin-Guidelines</p>\n<p>That said, I'm closing this but please feel free to add your plugin to the plugins list if you're open to maintaining it in your own repository: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Plugins,-Tools-and-Hardware\n. I have no idea what this means. Is it due to reveal.js using an outdated version of node? That was updated a short while ago as part of 3.0.\n. Gonna close this since there's been no indication of it being an issue for anyone else. Also all reveal.js dependencies have update since this.\n. That export is failing because the page is unable to load reveal.js' PDF CSS file. This CSS file I'm referring to is referenced relatively from the index.html: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/dev/index.html#L28\n. The <code>theme</code> config value was only there so that the themes could be shown in the demo presentation. It was intentionally left out of the README to avoid having it be used by anyone else.</p>\n<p>I agree that it would be better to drop it completely so I just did in 7c03d6018617a3430ae10fd855467175ad17c096. The only downside is the demo presentation using a slightly more hacky way to preview the different themes.\n. see https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/pull/1063#issuecomment-66490599\n. Thanks for taking the time to look into this, however the issue has already been fixed in the dev branch (https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/tree/dev).\n. Would love to release more frequent updates. I used to put out a new release around every third month but unfortunately there hasn't been time for that this year. Moving cross-atlantic, starting a company and having a baby consumed pretty much all free time :)</p>\n<p>The next release will be 3.0.0 so it has a larger changeset than usual, including a change of default theme. It'll be released once it's been tested more thoroughly and the docs have been updated to cover migration from 2.X.X to 3.0.0. The framework itself isn't drastically different so the migration notes will mostly be there to assist people who want to stick to the old default theme and transitions.</p>\n<p>After 3.0.0 is out I'd love to get back to smaller, more incremental, releases.\n. The bower.json spec that I found (https://github.com/bower/bower.json-spec) doesn't seem to cover many of the fields included in this file, like _originalSource, _release and _resolution.</p>\n<p>Also two things that affect this have changed since the PR was opened; the minified files are no longer included in the repo and we're at version 3.0.0.</p>\n<p>How does the below look, anything missing or inaccurate?</p>\n<p><code>json\n{\n  \"name\": \"reveal.js\",\n  \"version\": \"3.0.0\",\n  \"main\": [\n    \"lib/js/head.min.js\",\n    \"js/reveal.js\",\n    \"css/reveal.css\"\n  ],\n  \"homepage\": \"http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/\",\n  \"license\": \"MIT\",\n  \"description\": \"A framework for easily creating beautiful presentations using HTML.\",\n  \"authors\": [\n    \"Hakim El Hattab &lt;hakim.elhattab@gmail.com&gt;\"\n  ],\n  \"ignore\": [\n    \"**/.*\",\n    \"node_modules\",\n    \"bower_components\",\n    \"test\"\n  ]\n}</code>\n. @gion got it, will revise and add that as a dependency\n. Just added a bower file in b390e66c270d4fc26755fc4097e02808ea567721</p>\n<p>Give it shot if you can and let me know if it's working correctly or needs to be revised.\n. Hey. If I've understood comments correctly you want to ignore stepping through fragments when navigating through your horizontal slides, and only reveal fragments when pressing up/down? This isn't how I think the framework should behave but you could manually tweak it to work like that. Try replacing the following two lines in your reveal.js file:</p>\n<p>https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/js/reveal.js#L3746 -&gt; <code>if( availableRoutes().left ) {</code>\nhttps://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/js/reveal.js#L3761 -&gt; <code>if( availableRoutes().right ) {</code>\n. I just added support for slide numbers PDF exports. Just make sure the reveal.js \"slideNumber\" config value is set to true and the numbers will automatically be generated for each slide when exporting to PDF.\n. fixed in #1523 \n. Thanks for the PR however this was already fixed in the dev branch a while back: 2cd988a7a347ddad39b4315b2f63e7c1105ecd19</p>\n<p>Hoping to find time to get 3.0.0 out soon.\n. Thanks for figuring that out @juhoffma.</p>\n<p>This should have been mentioned in the 3.0 release notes. I've updated the release notes to cover the renamed attributes. Also added it as a step in the migration 2.0 &gt; 3.0 migration instructions: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Migrating-to-reveal.js-3.0.0\n. Links appear to be working when I export a PDF from the demo presentation at lab.hakim.se/reveal-js using the current stable version of Chrome.</p>\n<p>Here's the output: http://cl.ly/1i0Q3k0r162F/reveal-2.6.2.pdf\n. Thanks for the PR, live-reload has been enabled in #720\n. highlight.js has been updated to 8.6 which includes LESS support.\n. This should be fixed in 3.0 by validating link identifiers with regex, see 8c9c0ab0a64f32e8aa567009a82bac57464f4f93</p>\n<p>I agree that <code>getElementById</code> is more appropriate so I went ahead and swapped that out in 817bb3bf43879009ae445e52d4b6ef88053c5583\n. Thanks for reporting. This transition is being removed entirely in reveal.js 3.0.0 so it will no longer be an issue.\n. This one has been bothering me since backgrounds were first introduced. It's been fixed now in the dev branch and will make its way out with the next release. \n. Thanks for the suggestion but doesn't feel like this is a common enough use case to merit adding to the framework. A small script ahead of reveal.js initializing should be able to do this.\n. No need to have another PDF export option in the readme, but I added this to the wiki: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Plugins,-Tools-and-Hardware\n. Thanks for sharing \u2013 I'm sure that may be useful to others. Feel free to add it to this page: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Plugins,-Tools-and-Hardware\n. That's really strange. Unfortunately not something that I think we can do anything about in reveal.js, short of removing that fragment style. The browser shouldn't crash because of a transform being applied.\n. This has been merged into master! Next up release notes.</p>\n<p>Fun coincidence \u2013 3.0.0 consists of exactly 300 commits. Going forward I'll resume smaller and more frequent releases.\n. Thanks for the suggestion but unfortunately that's not an option. The script wrapping it there to avoid having the browser parse the contents as HTML, which happens before JS has a chance to rewrite.</p>\n<p>If you want to create a 100% Markdown presentation, external Markdown is a better option: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#external-markdown\n. Hey \u2013 The class you'll need to use for C++ highlighting is \"cpp\", not \"c++\".\n. I'm surprised to see that's supported \u2013 figured plus signs in a class are invalid since it conflicts with CSS operators?</p>\n<p>I tested your example and this actually works for me in stable Chrome / OS X:</p>\n<p><code>html\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=\"c++\"&gt;\nvoid C::test() {\n  int var;\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p>\n<p>The parsed result is:</p>\n<p><code>html\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=\"c++ hljs \"&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"hljs-keyword\"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; C::test() {\n  &lt;span class=\"hljs-keyword\"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; var;\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</code>\n. Actually, it's probably because we're testing different versions. I'm using the dev version of reveal.js which has a more recent version of highlight.js. Try copying the highlight.js plugin from dev into your presentation: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/dev/plugin/highlight/highlight.js\n. Thanks but I prefer not having that in the readme :)\n. Hey. I'm sure it's possible to make a plugin for this but unfortunately not something I can help with. I don't know how VexFlow works \u2013 but this is usually a matter of monitoring reveal.js for slide change events and calling the third party library to \"do its thing\" when the relevant slide is made visible.\n. I pasted this into a fresh copy of 3.0 but neither of those are triggering in Chrome or Firefox on OS X. Can you test and see if you can reproduce this in a clean copy of reveal.js master? If you can, let me know and I'll reopen this.\n. Weird. We're both using the same browser and OS but seeing different things then. I uploaded this to [link removed] \u2013 does it fire alerts for you there as well?\n. Ah, seeing it too now. Didn't realize it only triggered when actually stepping through the fragments.\n. Fixed. We were accidentally calling out the <code>innerHTML</code> of fragments for screen readers, it has been changed to <code>textContent</code>.\n. I was unable to merge this, looks like the originating branch was deleted. I've gone ahead and made the same change manually \u2013 though I named the option just \"base\" (rather than \"serve-base\") to match \"port\".\n. Thanks for the feedback. I've gone ahead and changed the default to use https. Didn't go relative since that wouldn't work in file://.\n. This is really great! I'm creating some tests to ensure there's no regression but so far everything is working perfectly. Will merge soon.\n. Merged!</p>\n<p>Should probably also add support for separate in and out background transitions (<code>data-background-transition</code>) at some point so its consistent.\n. Panning when zoomed in with the zoom.js plugin is disabled since it doesn't work together with other reveal.js styling. No plans for trying to make it compatible.\n. That's not something that reveal.js supports. Content needs to fit within the slide area.</p>\n<p>The zoom plugin is for zooming in on a portion of a slide. For example, if you have a code sample on a slide you can alt+click it to bring it up as large as possible.\n. Thanks!\n. If I understand this correctly your example would mirror the markup from section number 2 inside of the section with that attribute? This isn't something I think needs to be in the framework, but could be done via custom scripts before initializing reveal.js.\n. That PR was for removing the minified files that reveal.js generates since those were getting recompiled and committed at every change. That library file is simply static so it can stay.\n. Answered in Slides support.\n. Nope, this isn't something that's supported. You'll need to change the CSS in this file: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/plugin/notes/notes.html\n. Yeah there is, check out the \"lazy loading\" section of the readme: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#lazy-loading\n. Good point, that's a bug and I've opened a new issue for it #1127</p>\n<p>For now you should be able to work around it by specifying a height for your image.\n. Good idea for a plugin, thanks for the PR!</p>\n<p>@maxmeyer Yeah, reveal.js absolutely needs to provide an easy way to\ninclude plugins that live in other repositories. Merging all plugins\ndirectly into this repo isn't scalable in terms of file size and, more\nimportantly, maintenance. Not sure what the right solution is yet.\nOn Sat 7 Feb 2015 at 08:35 maxmeyer notifications@github.com wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>@hakimel https://github.com/hakimel</p>\n<p>Would it be possible to support an \"plugin\" api for external plugins and a\nreveal.js-contrib-repository to give all the wonderful plugins a home, but\ndo not blow up the main repo to much?</p>\n<p>\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/pull/1124#issuecomment-73354073.\n. Yes, moving plugins to live in their own repos is the right way forward. Still considering options for how to best structure that and promote the available plugins from the main repo. There's currently a wiki page where some plugins are listed: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Plugins,-Tools-and-Hardware</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That said, I'll close this PR since it won't be merged.\n. Great! Was gonna add it to the wiki but saw you already did that. I added a link to the plugin wiki page in the project readme as well.\n. @maxmeyer Absolutely \u2013 feel free to.</p>\n<p>I've started a \"Plugin Guidelines\" document which for now mostly states that plugins should live in separate repositories, and explains why. This document is also referenced from <a href=\"https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\">CONTRIBUTING.md</a>.\n. I'm not sure how remotes.io works internally, you can try contacting them via their site at http://remotes.io/\n. That's not part of the framework, they're only part of the demo page at http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/</p>\n<p>If you'd like to copy them you can view the source of the page. It's all down at the bottom, underneath where it says <code>&lt;!-- Everything below this point is only used for the reveal.js demo page --&gt;</code>.\n. Good find, this has been fixed.\n. Makes sense, thanks!\n. This was recently fixed in the dev branch, all theme files in that folder are now automatically compiled 3b45b618b8f2f3c757a4c4645a381791ece71da8\n. Thanks for the PR but those styles were removed instead, so that you can use any highlight.js theme. 523f78eda724006e12a502a7b6d7c8147dc92fbe\n. Thanks for the suggestion but I want to limit the slide container to only containing slide elements. There's other elements, such as the autoplay controls, that are also positioned relative to the <code>.reveal</code> container. I wouldn't want all of that to move one level further in.\n. No unfortunately that's not something reveal.js supports, it would need to be custom built outside of the framework.\n. Merged, thanks!\n. That's not how it's intended \u2013 they should only fire once per fragment step. I just tested on the <a href=\"http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/\">demo presentation</a> by listening to fragmentshown/fragmenthidden via the browser JS console and they're only firing once there. Is it possible that you're attaching your event listeners multiple times?\n. Thanks for the suggestion but I don't think we need to support that. It's feels more straight forward to always expect the print-pdf param to be part of the query string, rather than looking for it in different parts of the URL.\n. Thanks for fixing that.</p>\n<p>This commit has been merged into the dev branch. In the future please submit all pull requests towards that branch. https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/commits/dev\n. You're welcome. No, I'm still supporting it. 3.0 was released just over a month ago and I've put in quite a few commits since then if you check out the logs.</p>\n<p>It's just been impossible for me to keep up with the quantity of issues and pull requests lately. I'm hopeful to catch up more whenever I can find time but there's many days worth of issues and PRs to review.\n. I thought the post message payload was always a string but I guess that's incorrect. Added type check to prevent errors like this.\n. This looks great @EliseWei! However I've decided not to merge any more plugins directly into the main repository since it's making reveal.js increasingly difficult to maintain. Existing plugins will eventually be moved out as well.</p>\n<p>I hope you'll still maintain the plugin in your branch and please feel free to add it to the plugins page https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Plugins,-Tools-and-Hardware\n. There isn't, reveal.js makes lots of changes to the DOM so it would be difficult to roll all that back. Perhaps you could work around this by reloading the page and not initializing the framework.\n. This was fixed a few weeks ago by always loading via HTTPS #1103</p>\n<p>Only available in the dev branch so far.\n. Nope, not that I am aware.\n. Great, merged!\n. Thanks for reporting. I cloned your presentation and turns out it's crashing because of the <code>roll-in</code> fragment style. As soon as that is removed, it no longer crashes.</p>\n<p>Will let you know once it's been fixed.\n. This is a strange one. Reducing the <code>rotateX</code> of the <code>roll-in</code> style from 90deg to 60deg stops Chrome from crashing when opening the speaker view. That's completely arbitrary so it'd be great if someone else can confirm by testing another presentation with the latest reveal.css from dev.\n. Got it -- thanks for testing.</p>\n<p>I don't have any other ideas so I may remove the roll-in style altogether to avoid the crash.\n. The <code>roll-in</code> fragment style has been removed. If anyone finds a way to reintroduce it without crashing Chrome we'll add it back in, if not I think this is an OK sacrifice to avoid crashes.</p>\n<p>@reagle I wouldn't really know how to describe this \u2013 would need to be boiled down to a reduced test case for it to be debuggable by Chromium developers.\n. Fixed by 60457d21b437b66f6bab41ed0ae99391b3946376\n. This isn't something that exists in the framework. Would need to be built separately.\n. Thanks for the PR but this won't be merged. I don't want to switch to EJS and I don't think multiplexing scripts and config should be included in the default presentation. I'm sure others who'd like to use a more template-based approach for their presentations will find your fork useful though.\n. The overview isn't very smooth in its transitions on some devices. It's just a very heavy view to render since it shows so many slides at once, transformed down to a smaller size.</p>\n<p>I haven't found a way to make it any faster but if it's unbearably slow I may revert back to not having any transition at all instead.\n. Sure, makes sense to make that more flexible. Thanks!\n. The fix from @bfritscher has been merged.\n. Good fix, thanks!\n. Those attributes won't be added to reveal.js. They are specific to the Slides editor and wouldn't be useful to non-Slides users. (Side note: we just added a new ZIP export option to Slides which might make your transition to reveal.js easier)</p>\n<p>Good catch regarding the background attributes, will add those to the readme.\n. Makes sense. Are there any side effects from this for non-Browserify users?\n. Cool, just wanted to check. Merged!\n. I'm open to adding an option to the markdown plugin for this. Do you want to give it a shot? It would probably make sense to group markdown plugin options inside one object like:</p>\n<p><code>javascript\nReveal.initialize({\n  markdown: {\n    smartypants: true\n  }\n})</code></p>\n<p>Which the markdown plugin then consumes via <code>Reveal.getConfig().markdown.smartypants</code>.\n. The proposed config option in the comments above was added by @demoneaux in #1765. Thanks @callahad! Perhaps there'll be a good argument for switching parsers altogether in the future but makes sense to be up to date on what we're using in the meantime.\n. Thanks, this has been merged into the dev branch https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/commits/dev\n. This isn't something I think should be built into the framework. Would make more sense to have a custom script outside of reveal.js hide slides according to your rules and context.\n. Thanks for reporting, tracking this issue in #1150\n. This has been fixed. If reveal.js finds \"data-autoplay\"-enabled media on a slide it automatically sets the auto-slide duration to match the length of the media. This logic has now been disabled when there are fragments in the slide.\n. Good find, your fix has been merged into the dev branch https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/commits/dev\n. If you're looking to add additional spacing between the browser edge and presentation content please use the \"margin\" configuration option, mentioned here: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#presentation-size</p>\n<p>For example here's the demo page with an increased margin: http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/?margin=0.5\n. Closing \u2013 this conversation moved to a Slides support ticket.\n. Can't remembe the issue that fixes. Will have to find the original issue/PR.\n. You'll need to call <code>Reveal.sync()</code> after adding or removing a slide.\n. Hm, give this a try instead of sync <code>Reveal.slide( Reveal.getIndices().h, Reveal.getIndices().v )</code>\n. Hey \u2013 this issue tracker isn't intended for personal support requests/how-to's so please only open new issues for bugs and feature requests. </p>\n<p>You'll need to use the API (https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#api) to achieve this but which methods you use depends on the context, like which slide you're on when a slide is deleted.\n. I didn't have any problem with this either but I've upgraded cssmin to 0.12.2 so that no one else runs into this. Thanks for the fix. \n. Thanks for the PR! I'd like to avoid having reveal.js cater to a specific way of deployment. I think it's best if the framework remains as environment agnostic as it can.</p>\n<p>Maybe you can share your instructions in the <a href=\"https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki\">wiki</a> instead? I'm sure others would find that useful.\n. Thanks, looks good. Will test and merge this soon.\n. Merged into the dev branch https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/commits/dev\n. Fixed in dev via #1188, will be released with 3.8.0. Looks good \u2013 thanks!. If you want to change he way the notes look or work I think forking is the right approach.\n. That iframe embed isn't working because the target page explicitly disallows embedding through an X-Frame-Options header. If you open the developer tools when viewing your presentation you'll see the following error:</p>\n<p><code>Refused to display 'https://slides.com/' in a frame because it set 'X-Frame-Options' to 'SAMEORIGIN'.</code>\n. Didn't realize I was, will update that. I used it as an example before our\nupgrade to rails 4 (which defaults to disabling embeds).\nOn Mon 13 Apr 2015 at 20:47 Joseph Reagle notifications@github.com wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thanks @hakimel https://github.com/hakimel, please don't use '\nhttps://slides.com/' as your example\nhttps://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#slide-backgrounds then.</p>\n<p>\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/1190#issuecomment-92457578.\n. @yberol Sorry but there's no workaround for that as far as I know.\n. @reagle This actually closed already, which why you're not seeing the close button :). This is a duplicate of #1150</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's actually crashing because of the \"roll-in\" fragment that appears in the upcoming slide window.\n. You'd have to convert your content to images and insert those as background images behind individual vertical slides.\n. Thanks\n. There's not -- conflicts with he swipe navigation.\n. Thanks but his was recently fixed in another PR #1167\n. I recently added support for this, so far it's only available in the dev branch and it doesn't work in Firefox. You can see it in action by navigating to the following slide http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/10/4\n. Thanks for the PR \u2013 this has been merged into the dev branch!\n. The background actually shows up but it's a low opacity image so hard to see against light backgrounds. I think that's OK since this is demo content designed for the dark default theme.\n. Yeah, that old shadow style was way over the top. I tried to go much simpler with the new themes to make them more flexible. If we're changing this for existing themes, I think the shadow should be removed altogether.\n. Great. Thanks!\n. That's not possible. Browsers don't allow it.\n. All dependencies have changed since this so hopefully your issue has been resolved. A clean <code>npm install</code> currently works without any issues.\n. I think this is outside the scope of reveal.js. To run a reveal.js presentation offline you should store it locally on your computer. All framework assets are already included in the repo so as long as you keep local copies of your images as well it should all work offline.\n. Sorry but it's been ages since I worked with Flash so unfortunately I can't offer any insight on this. \n. This was addressed in Slides by lazy-loading all iframe elements only when their parent slide becomes visible. To lazy-load in reveal.js, swap out the \"src\" attribute on your iframe elements with \"data-src\".\n. Thanks! This was merged into dev https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/commits/dev\n. Neither of those two should be required, all grunt tasks work for me and I use the default Gruntfile included in the project. </p>\n<p>Maybe you can give it another go? Pretty much all dependencies have updated since this.\n. Would be great to make this more flexible than the current HTML 4 validation.\n. This was fixed in #2037. The fix is available from the dev branch until next release.. That's not configurable, the scale factor is based on the size of the element you click. It tries to zoom as far as it can while keeping the whole element visible.\n. The \"current-visible\" fragment style does this but for visibility. Below is modified version of it for growing you can add to your reveal.scss, then use \"fragment current-grow\".</p>\n<p>``` scss\n.reveal .slides section .fragment.current-grow {\n    opacity: 1;\n    visibility: visible;</p>\n<pre><code>&amp;.current-fragment {\n    transform: scale( 1.3 );\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>}\n```\n. This issue tracker is for feature request and bug reports. If you want to ask a general question or get help please try Stack Overflow.</p>\n<p>In short you'll need to iterate over all videos and pause them. When resuming playback you can get the current slide with  <code>Reveal.getCurrentSlide()</code> and then find the current video within that.\n. I don't remember why the regex limiting what links are accepted is there in the first place. It's probably safe to remove but will need to run tests to confirm.\n. There's info about how to add background videos in the readme https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#slide-backgrounds\n. This was fixed in #1250\n. Can you include a link to that presentation or the source code for the slide? This doesn't appear to be a problem in the example presentation at http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/13\n. Just fixed this in the dev branch, see 5dd90671507f8f56b27fe9d8a2fd25c1adb08d6b. Will be released with 3.3.0.\n. Good stuff!\n. @waywaaard is correct. The overlapping content doesn't matter for the final PDF output \u2013 it will only look like that before you open the print dialog. \n. @saimn That looks like a bug, though unrelated to this issue. Would you mind opening a new issue for it?\n. From the look of of the screenshots in this thread, the <a href=\"https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/css/print/pdf.css\">css/print/pdf.css</a> isn't loading. Can you try manually including it in your HTML file and printing again?</p>\n<p>That stylesheet is normally loaded using a small script in the head of the default index.html file: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/index.html#L16-L22. However that may stop working if the pdf.css or index.html files are moved to a different relative path or the script is removed from the index.html file.\n. Thanks! This has been merged into the dev branch and will be released with the next version.</p>\n<p>I updated the controls selectors in the themes as well so that they still work.\n. You'll need to wrap the units in quotation marks, otherwise the JavaScript is invalid.</p>\n<p><code>width: \"100%\",\nheight: \"100%\"</code>\n. That condition for loading highlight.js was dropped in the 3.2.0 release. From now on it's always loaded, even if there is no <code>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;</code> block on the page.</p>\n<p>See #1225\n. Thanks!\n. thanks!\n. Thanks for digging into this. The PR you submitted was merged and reveal.js now uses a more recent version of socket.io.</p>\n<p>However I needed to make some changes to how multiplexing works as part of the dependency update so it's no longer compatible with the version at revealjs.jit.su. I'll file a new issue for asking the person who operates that server to update it once these changes have had some time to be tested and are merged into master.\n. Neither master or dev currently work. Also just saw that the server is moving: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/pull/1357/files</p>\n<p>I'm starting to wonder if it might just be easier to switch the examples in the readme to run the server locally.\n. You'll need to escape the <code>&lt; &gt;</code> symbols with HTML entities. If not the browser will try to \"fix\" the broken markup in the page (an opening <code>&lt;t&gt;</code> without a closing tag). This happens before our JS kicks in so we can't script around it.</p>\n<p>This:</p>\n<p><code>public class FailableValueWrapper&lt;t&gt;</code></p>\n<p>Would be changed to:</p>\n<p><code>public class FailableValueWrapper&amp;lt;t&amp;gt;</code>\n. Makes sense to update but will want to test the potential conflict with the notes plugin that you mentioned in https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/1276#issuecomment-114813103. Might not be an issue at all but want to eliminate the risk.\n. Hey. This was started in #1067 a while back, I just got around to making some revisions to the file and have added it in master. Hope it works!\n. Hey, this isn't something that reveal.js supports so you'd need to write custom code to achieve it.\n. Those transitions were intentionally removed because they had too many issues.\n. Haven't tested decktape myself yet but looks great. Thanks for the PR!\n. Those styles have been removed.\n. Hm, moving the definition further down inside of the same object definition shouldn't make a difference. Was there something in their documentation specifically about the order?\n. You'll need to use backticks to delimit code blocks rather than pre or code tags. Here's a working example: http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/6</p>\n<p>Source:</p>\n<p>`````` html\n<section data-markdown>\n    <script type=\"text/template\">\n        ## Markdown support</p>\n<pre><code>    Write content using inline or external Markdown.\n    Instructions and more info available in the [readme](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#markdown).\n\n    ```\n    &lt;section data-markdown&gt;\n      ## Markdown support\n\n      Write content using inline or external Markdown.\n      Instructions and more info available in the [readme](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#markdown).\n    &lt;/section&gt;\n    ```\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p></section>\n<code>`````\n. You'll need to use JS to add/remove the slides from the DOM. After adding or removing slides you can call</code>Reveal.sync()` to refresh the navigation etc.\n. You can test this to see how it works on the demo presentation. For example:</p>\n<p>http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/?width=500\nhttp://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/?width=1500&amp;height=1500</p>\n<p>Regardless of the specified width/height the presentation should always scale to fit the display (the above links do). The width and height config values represent the original resolution before any scaling is applied. Scaling can be controlled via the <code>minScale</code> and <code>maxScale</code> configuration options.</p>\n<p>If you've got a presentation that's not scaling down correctly please include a link to it and I'll check out what might be wrong.\n. Thanks\n. Good stuff, thanks!\n. Hey, no, that's not something we support.\n. Fixed by @alexbatista in #1376\n. Hey, sorry but this issue tracker is only for bug reports and feature requests. If you've got questions it's better to try Stack Overflow.\n. Can you upload the presentation somewhere and share a link? If everything is shifted half a screen to the left there's bound to be some error on the page. \n. When updating to the latest reveal.js it looks like you only updated the JavaScript file. You'll also need to update to the latest CSS styles, this is the file that's out of date: http://voxx.biz/styles/reveal.min.css.\n. There's no per-slide configuration option so you'd need to use custom CSS for that specific slide.\n. Fixed by @gruber76 in #1320\n. Thanks for taking the time to look into this. I agree it doesn't seem like there's any reason for the string to be forced to lowercase. I've merged your commit into the dev branch: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/commits/dev</p>\n<p>In the future, please submit pull requests towards dev rather than master. Thanks!\n. Nope, that's not something we support.\n. See #1325 . Makes sense to allow this to be configured. Your commit has been merged into the dev branch, and I added the new config value to the docs as well.. Thanks but the cube and page transitions are no longer mentioned there since they are deprecated.\n. Fixed in #1381 \n. Gave it a try but I'm not able to reproduce this in FF 41 / OS X. The numbers are always visible in the beige/sky/white themes, even when the presentation is scaled up.\n. @demoneaux I agree this is not something we need to add to the framework. If the progress bar not filling entirely is distracting, you can turn it off using <code>progress: false</code> in your reveal.js config. \n. Thanks @demoneaux \n. Thanks. This was update to use 4.1.1 a little while ago.\n. Pinch-to-zoom support was added in 10e44aabfcaba104ab52bdc11f2f6963155cdea4. All dependencies have been updated to more recent versions so this should no longer be a problem. Grab a copy of the latest reveal.js and let me know if you still run into any issues.\n. Thanks \u2013 that should definitely be included in the documentation.\n. Thanks David!\n. @xnorme Good suggestion \u2013 I've added a note about using backticks in the readme. Great addition. Any chance you can remove the whitespace changes to avoid conflicts? We basically want these changes: https://github.com/oslego/reveal.js/commit/8bbc2971acafafdb6194efe372663d8ec59b6f0a?w=1\n. Weird, it looks like those whitespace changes still snuck their way in but I went ahead and merged this anyway. Thanks for the PR!\n. Thanks, totally forgot to update that.\n. Looks like a useful addition. Happy to add this but we'll need to mention it in the readme too.\n. Fixed by #1375, thanks @verdurin!\n. Thanks! This commit has been merged into the dev branch: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/commits/dev</p>\n<p>The update to socket.io caused the speaker notes and multiplexing plugins to stop working.

Will release a new version soon.\n. All set. Looks like head.js was using non-semver tags before 1.0.3 so \"0.9.6\" was actually \"v0.96\". I went with 1.0.3 instead.\n. Thanks for the fix!

Thanks!\n. That's right \u2013 the bower.json manifest was just added. I just released 3.2.0 and bower install should work from this release.\n. Thanks for the PR. I was about to merge this but noticed there was a newer release (8.9.1) so I went ahead and updated to that instead. \n. This was a bug \u2013 the background in fullscreen mode should automatically match the theme.</p>\n<p>Just added a fix for this and confirmed that it's working in Chrome OS X.\n. Just pushed a fix for this to the dev branch so all theme backgrounds will display correctly in fullscreen mode. </p>\n<p>Fullscreen ancestor selectors were moved from core <code>reveal.scss</code> to the theme template <code>theme.scss</code>. Check out the commit for a full diff: b7e0d9b1c79a475249777d734a9675b1ba03a47a\n. I agree the readme is getting a bit unwieldy. I'm all for adding a TOC.\n. The page and cube transitions used to be in the readme but have since been deprecated due to how inflexible they were. They're still in the CSS for backwards compatibility though.\n. That was unintentional \u2013 just removed it in 35462a424c4899747aa2079101372c66ac14d211.\n. Good one, thanks!\n. Thanks for the PR. The \"linear\" and \"default\" transitions were renamed to \"slide\" and \"convex\". The old names remain in the CSS for backwards compatibility but should not be referenced in the readme. \n. Cool, thanks!\n. Good call, thanks!\n. The remotes plugin has been removed.\n. Oops, already fixed this one in the dev branch. Thanks though!\n. Hey, sorry but the site that was powering this plugin was taken down bu the original author. I've removed the remotes plugin from reveal.js now since it's no longer working.\n. Thanks. Your commit has been merged into the dev branch and will go out with the next release.\n. Merged a fix for this in #1844, it's mostly the same as the change in this PR but using the explicit page width/height instead of a scaled down page width/height.. Your commit has been merged into the dev branch and will go out with the next release, thanks!\n. The template wrapper is needed so that the Markdown content isn't parsed by the browser before we can pick it up using JavaScript. For example, neither of the following would work without the wrapper:</p>\n<p>`````` html\n<section data-markdown>\n    <script type=\"text/template\">\n        <a href=\"http://slides.com\">http://slides.com</a></p>\n<pre><code>    ```&lt;b&gt;Hello world&lt;/b&gt;```\n\n    &lt;u&gt;test&lt;/u&gt;\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p></section>\n``````\n. Makes sense, thanks!\n. The server side speaker notes plugin wasn't built to sync both ways but I just added that. Changes inside of the speaker view will now reflect in the main presentation view. Only in the dev branch so far.\n. Oops, looks like you accidentally submitted a pull request :)\n. All set \u2013 your commits have been merged into the dev branch. Please submit pull requests directly towards that branch next time, thanks! https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/commits/dev</p>\n<p>Revised the test as discussed above e4634f20e8be5075882b3cc49a169e0fa1ae8f6a.\n. Thanks!\n. Good catch. They shouldn't be blank though, I changed them to <code>null</code> since that's what reveal.js defaults to. 833622edcd45a7721f7a76d93cc12a1284f60a0d\n. Thanks for the PR. This is an interesting idea, though I think it could be made a bit more flexible. What if we made the config option <code>autoSlideMethod</code> instead so you can switch to any navigation method?</p>\n<p>``` javascript\n// Only step to the right\nReveal.initialize({ autoSlideMethod: Reveal.navigateRight })</p>\n<p>// Go backwards\nReveal.initialize({ autoSlideMethod: Reveal.navigatePrev })</p>\n<p>// Go backwards\nReveal.initialize({ autoSlideMethod: function() {\n  // custom behavior\n} })\n```</p>\n<p>Would be pretty straight forward to add, we just need to replace navigateNext here and make sure it defaults to using <code>navigateNext</code>: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/js/reveal.js#L3691\n. That's great \u2013 thanks!\n. Nice! Those look great.\n. Makes sense to me \u2013 I've made the change in 8e3a7f03d189391f88f56b8ac7c96db709d7cba7 and ef137fd01f228c50027c356084a2e69e938e2511\n. Thanks for the idea but this isn't something I think we should add. The overview mode is sluggish and at the brink of being overly complex already so it wouldn't be a good idea trying to add something like this on top.\n. Thanks, I'm sure that'll be helpful to others.\n. That's a good idea. However the variable you added was in local scope and couldn't be queried by plugins from the outside. I went ahead and revised it so the version is now accessible through <code>Reveal.VERSION</code>.\n. Thanks for the PR. I gave this a try but wasn't able to get it to work. When I try opening the Markdown example presentation (<code>/plugin/markdown/example.html</code>) the first slide \u2013 which should be loading external Markdown \u2013 is empty.</p>\n<p>We'll also need to remove the <code>Reveal.slide(0)</code> call at the end since that currently overrides all deeplinks.\n. If I'm understanding this correctly, the issue has been fixed at the source so there's no longer any need for this change. Let me know if I'm wrong and I'll reopen.\n. Merged, thanks!\n. Good idea, however the speaker notes plugin is optional so the shortcut should only be included when the plugin is present on the page. I implemented it to work that way in 06cdd9b\n. Cool, thanks!\n. Thanks! This has been merged and all dependencies have been updated accordingly so there are no longer any known vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>Note that this was merged into the <a href=\"https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/tree/dev\">dev branch</a>, in the future please submit PRs directly towards that branch.\n. Oops, thanks.\n. I added that \u2013 it's there in the source of the page if you search for \"carbon\".\n. @demoneaux yep, merged it!\n. You can disabled scaling by setting both the <code>maxScale</code> and <code>minScale</code> config options to 1. For example: http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/?minScale=1&amp;maxScale=1</p>\n<p>More info about presentation size and scaling here: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#presentation-size\n. Printing the black theme works in the demo at http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/?print-pdf</p>\n<p>Can you try that and let me know if it works for you?\n. I think the problem is you haven't checked the \"Background graphics\" option in the print settings. Not sure what this translates to but I've attached a screenshot where you can see the option in the bottom left.</p>\n<p><img width=\"994\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-01-26 at 10 13 55\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/629429/12576664/a57a4c32-c415-11e5-8e1f-f2a2fb2f9617.png\">\n. It's now possible to configure marked via the new <code>markdown</code> config option, for example:</p>\n<p><code>javascript\nReveal.initialize({\n  markdown: {\n    smartypants: true\n  }\n})</code>. Closing since the original issue can't be reproduced.. Yep \u2013 @demoneaux and @h4xr are right that you should add your new font in a custom stylesheet. Could create a new theme too.\n. Thanks for the PR and taking the time to implement this. I said in #1089 that this didn't seem like a common enough use case, but judging by the number of votes on Stack Overflow I was wrong.</p>\n<p>I'd be happy to add support for random order but I don't think this is the right way to do it. The slides should be moved into random order in the DOM instead, for two reasons:\n- It'll be a lot easier to implement (just a few lines of JS to run at startup)\n- it's a bit strange to have the slide numbers and progress bar jump around as they do when the DOM order remains unchanged\n. Added what I mentioned above in 2625a9292eae1c13c609eabd6d71eef825b55c92</p>\n<p>It can be used as a config value <code>Reveal.initialize({shuffle: true})</code> or called manually <code>Reveal.shuffle()</code>.\n. Yep, that's a typo :S Good catch.</p>\n<p>219a60053a908cba54fdbdaa2cbb28ae596dfe93 was merged into the dev branch. In the future, please submit pull requests directly towards dev.\n. Thanks for the PR! Backgrounds are intended to be non-interactive since they can't always be reached due to overlap with slide content or presentation control elements. For example, the reveal.js progress bar is at a higher depth than the backgrounds so when I tried clicking the video controls it was captured by the progress bar and ended up switching slides.</p>\n<p>I agree with @demoneaux that it's better to place a video directly in the slide in this case.\n. This is a useful addition. </p>\n<p>There shouldn't be any need to dispatch these events from the individual \"navigate\" methods though, right? Those methods all end up calling <code>slide()</code>, and you're already dispatching the same events from within the <code>slide()</code> function.. Hey! Thanks for the PR but we already support printing notes to PDF. This is made possible via the <code>shareNotes</code> config option which was added in reveal.js 3.2.0. With <code>showNotes</code> set to true, the notes will be visible on top of the presentation and be included in exports. https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#share-and-print-speaker-notes</p>\n<p>You can test this on the demo page, slide 10 has some notes: http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/demo.html?print-pdf&amp;showNotes=true\n. You're right that the current notes design doesn't allow for very long notes. We should try to improve that in the existing solution rather than adding a secondary way to print. Perhaps an additional config value that pushes printed notes to a separate page? Alternatively we could move notes to the right of the slide as a vertical column that spans the full height of the page and about 20-30% of the width.</p>\n<p>All config parameters can be set as url params, so you can just add ?showNotes=true to the URL. This works with other properties too, four example you can turn on auto-sliding every five seconds by adding <code>?autoSlide=5000</code>.\n. I like the idea of a layout option for notes. I went ahead and implemented at least the start of it in 3111d3b1ae12af2580cb45a18da208146701a6fd.</p>\n<p>Instead of a new config value, I'm re-using the existing showNotes option. Here's a list of what values you can set showNotes to:</p>\n<p>| Value | Description |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| nil | Notes aren't shown. |\n| false | Notes aren't shown. |\n| true | Notes are shown with default layout (\"inline\"). |\n| string | Notes are shown with the given layout. The layout is added as  <code>data-layout=\"yourLayoutName\"</code> on the <code>.speaker-notes</code> element so that you can easily attach any custom styles. |</p>\n<p>For now, the only supported layout is <code>separate-page</code> which will make notes appear on separate pages in PDF exports.\n. Looks good, thanks!\n. Thanks for pointing out that's hard to find. I think we should make the option to reset more obvious instead of having to explain it in the readme. Perhaps a small reset icon that's always visible?\n. These commits have been merged into the dev branch.</p>\n<p>This includes the new speaker view layout as well, I think it makes a lot of sense to make more room for notes. Thanks!\n. This is a good idea. I'd like to slim down the template a little to make sure it has only the essentials. Will need to test that out a little bit more.\n. The index.html file is now an empty template. This is the content and plugins I settled on: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/dev/index.html</p>\n<p>Hopefully I didn't miss any documentation that needs updating.\n. Makes sense that those should never be overwritten for PDF exports since that will break the export. </p>\n<p>This commit has been merged into the dev branch, please submit all future pull requests directly towards that branch. Thanks!\n. I'm switching servers and DNS seems to be propagating slowly. This should resolve itself over time but let me know if you still have any issues accessing the site in in a day from now.\n. Thanks! Looks like it's working well when I try from here too.</p>\n<p>I merged your commit into the dev branch, please submit towards that branch directly next time.\n. Thanks, it makes sense to note which version is required. I tweaked it and noted which version we do support rather than what we do not; 1efa52486c8712507b8a343b26b227e834da5fe6\n. \ud83d\ude4c\n. Was looking at merging this but felt like the whole section on slide backgrounds was missing a lot of info so I rewrote it instead. The rewritten version includes a full description of all supported attributes, include the <code>data-background-position</code> which wasn't even mentioned before.</p>\n<p>https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#slide-backgrounds\n. Thanks for the PR but you'll need to resubmit towards the 'dev' branch. There's recent changes to package.json that conflict with your changes.\n. Thanks! This has been merged. The TOC grew pretty huge so I might actually exclude a few sub-topics.\n. Can you try it without the iframes and let me know if it's still broken? Could be something outside of reveal.js that's breaking.\n. @jdalton Gotcha \u2013 thanks for looking into it.\n. Thanks! I don't have Edge installed anywhere that I can test but the diff looks good and Chrome still works so I went ahead and merged.\n. Thanks, I use those too but need downloaded them ages ago before Edge. Not\nsure when the release will be. Probably soon :)\nOn Wed, 13 Apr 2016 at 19:25, RopoMen notifications@github.com wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hi,\nThanks, I have used modern.ie virtualboxes\nhttps://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/windows/\nfor testing.</p>\n<p>btw. about that new release, is it coming out soon? :)</p>\n<p>\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you modified the open/close state.</p>\n<p>Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/pull/1550#issuecomment-209554438\n.

I have merged that in now and from what I understand this does more or less the same thing so will close. Let me know if I got that wrong!\n. Thanks for the PR @FuriKuri. I agree with @demoneaux. I don't think reveal.js should be concerned with where or how a presentation is deployed/hosted. There's so many different environments you might want to run it in and we can't maintain configs for all of them in this repo.. This is really nice! Thanks @aspiers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'd be happy to merge this with one change; can you make it so that this is disabled by default? Don't want to make assumptions about how long someone wants to spend per slide (we can suggest 2 mins in the readme though), and I think seeing a countdown there without having opted into it is a bit surprising.\n. Thanks! Yea, I think basing it on the presence of that config value makes\nsense. Matches how other config values work as well.\nOn Sat, 11 Jun 2016 at 22:03, Adam Spiers notifications@github.com wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>@hakimel https://github.com/hakimel Sure, I can do that.

Feels like if you opt into pacing the elapsed time counter is only visual clutter that makes it harder to follow your pacing. Maybe we should hide the elapsed time when pacing is turned on?. Fixed in #1767 . Nice, thanks!\n. Looks good, thanks!\n. Cheers! Fix makes sense, but you added the selection colors to the compiled theme CSS file so it'll be overwritten whenever the SCSS compiles. I went ahead and added it to the theme.scss template so that it'll be automatically generated for each theme.\n. Thanks but I don't think this is useful right now. Most of what's in the doc is internal, with limited detail in the comments. I'd rather stick to the README for now.. This is a good improvement. This message will appear whenever an iframe is unable to load, so I have changed the message a little bit. I really wish there was a way to explicitly detect when an iframe fails to load because of <code>x-frame-options</code>. </p>\n<p>The error message was visible briefly when an iframe loaded successfully as well but I've added a transition to fix that.. This was added in #1955 which has been merged into the dev branch.</p>\n<p>I like this as the default behavior since it better mimics how fragments work. That said, there's a config option for disabling it if you want the old behavior.. Great stuff. Thanks again!\n. Good improvement, thanks!\n. Thanks for reporting. This has been fixed in the dev branch now and will make its way out with the next release. Had to restructure the way fragments are updated a bit, so will keep an eye out for any side effects.. Thanks!\n. Thanks, merged into dev https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/commits/dev\n. Fixed in #1768. Sure, I made a few changes;\n- Increased default font size\n- Reduced default page margin from 10% to 4%\n- Increase default max scale from 1.5x to 2x</p>\n<p>Here's the before and after in a gif:\n<img alt=\"reveal-js-default-size\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/629429/15959510/6585e57c-2efb-11e6-8f18-017756da2275.gif\" /></p>\n<p>Note that if you include the zoom.js plugin, you can alt+click on an element to zoom in on it. This is particularly useful for elements like code blocks. Can try it out at http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/13\n. Thanks, I agree that could be useful in the API. There were a few issues with the PR though (it contains an unrelated video controls change and an unused argument for <code>showHelp</code>) so I added it myself in ca92d22adcf2a5a6c960b2d4a6bdadd13b12385b\n. Hey! That's the right config value, but the <code>initialize</code> method should only be called once and it looks like you're calling it twice. If you want to change an option after initializing, you can use <code>Reveal.configure({ controls: false })</code>.\n. 6bfa48a667fe91bb1de1b680769aeb7260af3a49 adds a check that will prevent repeated initialization\n. Requesting fullscreen on the documentElement looks like a solid fix. Thanks @wanderview! \n. Fixed by a12a17b2d7053fad006ae9914309e8fb56c44329\n. I just pushed a fix for this. If you've experienced this issue, can you please try http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/ again and see if it works better now? You can try a specific transition by adding it in the query string: http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/?transition=convex\n. Looks great, thanks!\n. This looks nice! \"Appear\" doesn't really indicate what the transition looks like, maybe \"slide-up\" is a better name?. Also, there are a lot of complex selectors related to timing. Is there a way we can remove or simplify those?. Thanks! This commit was merged into the dev branch, please submit PRs towards that branch directly next time.. Nice, thanks!\n. Great idea \ud83d\ude4c. ^ made a few changes to this, to make it work correctly when stepping to and from a slide with multiple fragment notes. Also added support for notes in an attribute <code>&lt;div class=\"fragment\" data-notes=\"Notes here\"&gt;</code>.. Makes sense \ud83d\udc4d. Merged your PR, so the number is now hidden when printing to paper.. Appreciate the PR. I had already switched to <code>transform-style: flat</code> for all non-3d transitions in the dev branch for a separate issue. The 3d transitions like concave and convex still used <code>preserve-3d</code> since they need it for the vertical 3d transitions to work.</p>\n<p>I've revised this in 0b9233cf4a1a53297356cbc834c2240a92d20545 so that preserve-3d is only used specifically for vertical stacks, and only when a 3d-transition is being used. This latest version is available to test on http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/\n. Gotcha. Not sure why but I'm not seeing that overview error in FF 48 on OS X 10.11.4. Anything special required to trigger it?\n. Alright, was able to see the overview rendering issue in FF now too. Please give it a try at http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js when you have a chance.</p>\n<p>Let me know if you still see the problem and I'll reopen.\n. Damn. Thanks for testing. I was testing OS X too and things are working well there.\n. Tested FF on Windows here and it seemed okay. Not sure under what exact circumstance the clipping in the screenshot above is occurring, but if anyone finds any new info please file that in a new issue.. Hey, looks like there's an error in that example. There should be an empty\nspace between hash and heading: \"# hello\" rather than \"#hello\".</p>\n<p>On Thu, 4 Aug 2016 at 07:07, David Russell notifications@github.com wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It looks like the rendering of HTML headers using external Markdown is\nbroken following an update of the <em>plugin/markdown/marked.js</em> dependency\nfrom v0.3.3 to v0.3.5 in the <em>dev</em> branch.</p>\n<p>Markdown formatted headers are being rendered by Reveal.js as plain text\nand the <em>#</em> header syntax itself is visible in the output as plain text\ninstead of solely being used to apply style to the accompanying text.

Also adjusted the fix a little bit so that the whole slide function aborts when there are no slides. 0b6585bd44fe86344408d9d3ab8d3c17e254738a\n. Closing this as a duplicate of #1627 \u2013 please try the fix I posted in that thread.\n. Fixed in #2131. The online editor doesn't support charts yet. One workaround is to create the chart using another tool, like http://amcharts.com, and embed it inside of your presentation. To embed content from another site you'll need to insert an \"iframe\" element in the Slides editor and paste the embed code from the original site.\n. I tried this in Chrome 60 on a Mac but am not seeing an error. This is the presentation I used:\n<code>html\n&lt;div class=\"slides\"&gt;\n    &lt;section data-background-video=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.slid.es/site/homepage/v1/homepage-video-editor.mp4\"&gt;&lt;/section&gt;\n    &lt;section&gt;Empty slide&lt;/section&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</code>\nI tried waiting for the video to play a few seconds before navigating, and tried skipping back and forth quickly too. Can you reproduce the error using the slides in my example? If not, can you share the presentation source where the exception is thrown?. Thanks for checking. Didn't realize it was a mobile issue.. Yeah this exists, you can turn it on with <code>history: true</code> when initializing reveal.js: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#configuration\n. Good fix, thanks!\n. Thanks, merged into the dev branch https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/commits/dev\n. Localization seems like a good argument for leaving the default quotation marks.

That's a style choice for the theme that you can override if you want to.. Thanks but this was fixed a while back in 0b6585bd44fe86344408d9d3ab8d3c17e254738a \u2013 wasn't in master until 3.4.0 was released the other week though.. Hey! @simonauner is right that those dependencies are there to support the server side speaker notes and multiplexing functionality.\n. \ud83d\udc4d. Updated in #1743 . Just released this as part 3.4.0 \ud83d\ude80. Thanks for reporting! I tested having a background image on the first slide but it's working for me. Here's the reduced test I used:\n```html\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/reveal.css\">\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/theme/black.css\">\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div class=\"reveal\">\n      <div class=\"slides\">\n        <section data-background=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/hakim-static/reveal-js/image-placeholder.png\">\n          <h2>Image</h2>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n          <h1>The end</h1>\n        </section>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <script src=\"js/reveal.js\">\nReveal.initialize();\n\n\n```\nCan you please give this another try in the latest version of reveal.js and see if it might have been fixed since you reported?\nThe change proposed in the PR will not be merged \u2013 the code you removed is there to intentionally hide the background elements which are not currently in view for performance reasons. If a background is incorrectly hidden, that's a bug that we should fix elsewhere.. Thanks for the PR but those transitions are deprecated, please see my comment in #1774 . Makes sense, thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks. We already have something similar to this in the current-visible fragment style. A current-visible fragment will appear when it is the current fragment, and disappear again as soon as you move to a another fragment.\nWhat you are proposing seems like the same thing, but instead of just fading in and out it would collapse via display none. That said, what do you think about implementing this as \"fragment current-display\" (As in \"only display when it is the current fragment\")?\nAll the CSS this would take is:\ncss\n.fragment.current-display:not(.current-fragment) {\n    display: none;\n}. Good catch.. Thanks but since this is already working and not dependent on another script, I'd rather leave it that way for flexibility.\nreveal.js can be used without head.js, and if you do, you can load the reveal.js plugins any way you like.. We already support this via the mouseWheel config value, try setting mouseWheel: true when initializing.. This is actually already possible \u2013 any non-reveal.js class you add to a slide gets mirrored on the background element. So all you should need is <section class=\"blurred\"></section>.. This is great. Thanks a lot!. Thanks Ben.. This commit was added to master as well.. \ud83d\ude4c. Great stuff! \ud83d\udc4d . Good stuff, merged!. fixed in #1771 . Good catch. That's inconsistent that we were pausing all videos, but only resuming if data-autoplay was present.\nHas been merged into the dev branch.. Thanks for the PR but we need to manually factor in reveal.js' current scale for zooming to work in all circumstances.. Gotcha. It's possible something might have changed since this was opened. I tried out using the element as a target earlier today but it the zoom area was offset incorrectly. I'm using a large display, so reveal.js is at a 1.5-2x scale. Feel free to give it another try if you want.. I actually intentionally removed cube/page from all comments and docs some time ago to deprecate them without breaking existing presentations. I think it's inconsistent how those two transitions make visual changes to the slide (semi-transparent black background and shadow), making them difficult to use in combination with other transitions or with mixed in/out transitions.\nWill add a note about them being deprecated in the CSS to avoid confusion.. Spent some time testing this but from what I can tell, the presence of controls doesn't have an impact on whether or not videos play on iPad.\nVideos definitely weren't playing, but I found another solution for that in 7daa0e04de7d0ab2bae3159faae0b18d4eb3c8d3. I've updated the online demo, feel free to test by going to this link and stepping downwards to the slide with a video background: http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/10. Seems like this makes sense. Using a textarea wrapper avoids the conflict with <script> without any drawback that I know of.\nThe commit has been merged into dev, and the readme was updated to recommend using this over <script type=\"text/template\">.. Thanks for the PR but I don't think it makes sense to set those values via callback. We already have a Reveal.configure() API method that lets you change any config value after initialization. If you have a dynamically calculated width/height you could do something like:\n```javascript\nfunction getWidth() {\n  Math.random() * 1000;\n}\nReveal.initialize({ width: getWidth() });\nwindow.addEventListener( 'resize', function() {\n  Reveal.configure({ width: getWidth() });\n} );\n``. I assume you're referring to the auto-slide controls in the bottom left? Those are painted on a <canvas> element so the only way to change them is to edit this part of the reveal.js source: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/js/reveal.js#L4745-L4759. Hey! If you setautoSlideStoppable` to false, that will hide the controls. The auto-sliding can't be stopped then, but if there's a separate option for only hiding the controls and you do stop the progression there would be no way to resume so that doesn't seem ideal.\nDoes autoSlideStoppable solve what you were trying to accomplish or is there something I'm missing?. I agree this was confusing. Thanks!. Thanks for the PR but this is already be possible via ?showNotes=true, for example: http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/?print-pdf&showNotes=true (first speaker notes are on the 10th slide, titled \"Fragments\").\nOn a related note I recently made it possible to print them on a separate page by setting hte value of showNotes to 'separate-page': http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/?print-pdf&showNotes=separate-page\nGood idea to mention this in the docs where PDF printing is covered. I'll add something.. thanks!. This should be fixed in master. Can you give it a try and let me know if it works for you as well?\nPretty major bug, so I'll put out a new release once the fix is confirmed.. Thanks for checking but turns out that change broke PDF exports through command line tools :/ Reworked it to avoid adjusting the page height and breakpoints.. Reopening.\nI'm seeing the empty pages appear when printing in Chrome 59, but not 57. Have been pursuing a fix for a while but haven't found one that works for both in-browser and CLI printing yet.. This should be fixed in a way that works for both in-browser and command line (phantom, wkpdf etc) printing now.\nGive it a try when you get a chance.\n+@Skyr . Thanks for checking. I forgot to mention the change I made is only available in the dev branch \u2013 did you test master or dev? \nThe latest version can be tested in the live demo too: http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/?print-pdf. Chrome 57 & 59 on OS X are working. I don't have access to 56 so wasn't able to test that.. Whew, thanks!. I've rewritten the script to work with 3.4.0. The updated script will preload the presentation and read the configured width/height from reveal.js directly so that we can use that as the PDF page size. This makes it work with any configured size and removes the old \"width\" and \"height\" arguments from the phantom script.. No problem. There's no new release yet, but the updated script is available in master.. Thanks for the PR! I agree, toggleHelp is more in line with our other API methods.\nAll other \"toggle\" methods support an override argument, which essentially lets you force it to either toggle on or off. Would you mind adding a flag like that for the toggleHelp method too? You can see how it's implemented for toggleOverview here https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/js/reveal.js#L2054-L2070\nAlso please submit all pull requests towards the dev branch. That's where all the work happens between releases.. Thanks for the updates, @Frazer! \nI added toggleHelp to the docs and removed the showHelp API method since it's redundant.. Thanks but those two are actually not identical \u2013 note how one uses lowercase \"s\" in \"Screen\" and the other uses uppercase \"S\". They're both needed to cover all versions of webkit.. You can remove the autoplay query from the YouTube URL and instead add a data-autoplay attribute on the iframe, like this:\nhtml\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sGF6bOi1NfA\" data-autoplay></iframe>\nAlternatively, you can lazy-load the iframe when the containing slide is shown by swapping \"src\" for \"data-src\":\nhtml\n<iframe data-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sGF6bOi1NfA?autoplay=1\"></iframe>. Thanks! Merged with a couple of tweaks: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/README.md#pdf-export. Looks like the example server is back up again.\nThere's a package.json in the multiplex dir specifically for deploying with now. So deployment is as easy as running now plugin/multiple. I've added a note about this to the README in 5565d0861260c62f20f9ad5211aea697b4e8a0cc.. Thanks! Merged with two changes;\n- Switched the value from 'notes' to 'speaker', so it reads more like \"show the slide number to the speaker\".\n- Added a third value 'print' which can be used to only show notes when printing to PDF.. I like the feature and was missing this myself the other day. This option is now available in the dev branch now and defaults to hiding after five seconds.\nWanted to change a couple of different things to make this work when reconfiguring reveal.js and touch the DOM a little bit less so I ended up writing a different implementation in 7b707696b40a98e717d91e24162869f6d9c22957. The new controls (reveal.js 3.6.0) automatically hide the up/down arrows until you get to a vertical slide.. Nice! Didn't know about callPhantom/onCallback.. Tried a few examples and this seems to be working well. Thanks!. \ud83d\ude4c. Thanks for reporting. This previously reported and fixed in #1804. Not sure why it started happening again but I've reopened the original issue and am closing this.. Had no idea that was happening \u2013 thanks for the fix.. Thanks for reporting! A fix (#1866) for this was already merged into the dev branch. I've added that to master now as well and it will be included in the 3.5.0 release.. I've tested the 3.5.0 speaker view in both Safari and Chrome but didn't run into any issues. The speaker view tends to be cached pretty hard, would you mind trying Safari again with a clear cache?. Thanks for the info. Looks like the main window is having issues posting updates to the notes window, although I'm not sure why. . \ud83d\ude4c. This is a great addition. Thanks for a well structured PR with docs, comments and all \ud83d\ude4c. Very useful, thanks!. Thanks but looks like it was already updated to 9.11.0 in another PR.. All set!. Search improvements look great.\nI don't want to remove the zooming based on element bounds, if it's not working correctly we should fix it instead. It's useful to be able to zoom specific elements rather than a point when you want to, for example, enlarge a whole code block.\nHow about adding the point zoom using a different shortcut than alt + click?. This has been merged into the dev branch \ud83d\ude4c\nPlayed around with the point based zoom and I like how it's more predictable than element based zooming, since element bounds aren't always what you expect them to be.\nctrl + click brings up the context menu in OS X so I've made the shortcut platform dependent (ctrl for Linux, alt for all others).. Hey! The correct default separator for speaker notes is note: not notes:. This is correct in most of your md but wrong in that particular slide.. ^ That commit makes it so that both note: and notes: will work in the future. Seems like his would be an easy mistake to make.. Tested and this seems to be working well. Thanks @OleMussmann!. Hi Jonathan. Those styles were used to wait with showing content until fonts finished loading. However we removed them from Slides a few weeks ago so any new export shouldn't include that initial 0 opacity. Can you try a new export and see if you still have the same issue?\nAlso please get in touch via support @ slides.com for any Slides-related questions in the future.. Yeah, exporting any presentation to ZIP and copying over the offline CSS from there should do the trick.. Took a while but I found out how to reproduce that error. It happens when you press the 'S' to open the speaker view, and then go back to the main window and press the 'S' key again while the popup is still open in the background.\nIt's not happening when first opening the speaker view in any browser that I've tested.\nWasn't able to find a way to fix it yet though.. I tested revealjs.com again in Chrome canary/stable but the timer is working every time, except for the issue with pressing S while notes are already opened that I described above. \n2104 looks like a good improvement to make the notes work locally.\nI've moved the timer bug when opening notes twice to a new issue #2229. markdown-it looks like a great option. Would be nice to be able to drop our custom syntax for adding classes/attributes and replace it with a plugin. That said it doesn't seem like the benefit is strong enough to make it worth spending the time switching right now. Happy to re-evaluate this in the future though.. Thanks for the PR but this behavior is intentional. I added a note to the readme that describes why: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/tree/dev#lazy-loading-iframes\nMight be worth making this configurable in the future though, so that you can change it depending on what type of content you want to show in your frames. I tend to run a lot of heavy JavaScript experiments in my talks and don't want them to load before becoming visible since they make my computer fans go \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25. Good catch. The fix has been merged into dev. I ran some tests and\u2013as @reagle already mentioned\u2013data-transition on vertical slides works for the none, slide and fade transitions.\nThe concave and convex transition styles were being applied to the slide but there was an issue that prevented 3D transforms from working on vertical slides, so they ended up looking like the 2D slide transition. I've fixed that in b6ce0a9.\nThe zoom transition setting applies a scaling transform to horizontal slides, but has always used a flat slide transition between vertical slides. Not sure how to best address that when the setting is used directly on a specific vertical slide yet but will think about it.. Yeah \u2013 plenty of those overrides are no longer needed and could be removed. Some of the style resets, like text-shadow: 0 0 0 #000 !important, could probably be removed altogether.\nI don't mind the use of !important on the .reveal and .slide containers since those are all related to laying out content so that it can be printed, but overriding specific element styles (like the pre code font-family) is limiting.. I wasn't referring to normalizing the browser's default styles, we already use reset.css for that. I meant reset as in undoing the styles that reveal.js has set.. Two updates:\n1. The reset style selectors are no longer prefixed \".reveal\", making them easier to override.\n2. The reset styles were moved out of reveal.css to reset.css. This makes it easy to opt out of using them altogether, depending on your use case.. Thanks for reporting. This was fixed as part of PR #1909 that included a few other changes as well. PRs are merged into dev before being released with the next reveal.js version and merged into master.. This looks great\u2013thanks!\nI've merged your commits into the dev branch and made a few changes. Most importantly, this is now enabled by default when printing to PDF. To disable separate pages for fragments you'll need to set the pdfSeparateFragments config option to false.. Good idea, thanks!. Good catch, thanks. This needed to be fixed in all themes, so I applied the fix to the theme template SCSS file and rebuilt all of the CSS in 0c946ae18b3773895bae259802108df11fade6d9. This isn't supposed to be deprecated, data-background-interactive was recently added and is intended to work as described in the docs.\nYou weren't able to find it in the JS source because it's a purely CSS-based feature: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/css/reveal.scss#L450-L453. Thanks! Your commit has been merged into the dev branch and will make its way over to master with the next release. https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/commits/dev. The live demo is the current in-development version; https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/tree/dev\nThe new controls are part of that and will make their way out with 3.6.0.. Thanks for the PR. I have merged #2090 which also adds macro configuration, but in a slightly broader way in case you want to override any other TeX options.. I agree the project deserves its own domain. I've owned http://revealjs.com for two years \u2013 just moved the demo over there now. \nSSL cert should kick in in the next 24hrs.. Thanks for the suggestion but I prefer regular uppercase for the reveal.js themes.. Thanks. Just pushed a fix for this to the dev branch. From now on it'll be possible to call Reveal.configure() directly before or after Reveal.initialize() without any errors being thrown. Please give it a try when you get a chance.. Great. Thanks for testing.. Sure, I'm all for adding new fragment styles.\nFrom what I can see the added test seems identical to the other fragment tests, with the exception of using a different fragment style. If that's the case can you please remove the test from the PR? Also please remove package-lock.json.. Fixed in #2045 . \ud83d\ude4c. Thanks!. Looks great! This has been merged into the dev branch and will make its way out with the next release.. I checked but images are working in external and inline Markdown in 3.6.0.\nLooks like it might be a problem with your relative path to the image. If the images directory is at the project root, try ![Sample image](images/image.png). You can print your notes on a separate page if you prefer, from the readme:\n\nWhen showNotes is enabled notes are also included when you export to PDF. By default, notes are printed in a semi-transparent box on top of the slide. If you'd rather print them on a separate page after the slide, set showNotes: \"separate-page\".\n\nFor example: https://revealjs.com/?showNotes=separate-page&print-pdf. Fixed in #2042. Merged, thanks!. Looks great, thanks \ud83d\ude4c. Thanks, this has been merged into the dev branch @ https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/commits/dev. Looks great! Like you mentioned, this has been requested a few times in the past so makes sense to provide an option for it.\nI've merged this into https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/commits/dev and it'll go out with the next release.\n. Great stuff. Tested with a fresh install and everything looks \ud83d\udc4d. Hi Jonathan. Presentations created with Slides depend on additional styles and scripts on top of what reveal.js provides and you can't get rid of those files without affecting the presentation.\nIf you want to upgrade an old Slides export to a newer version of reveal.js you should be able to replace the reveal.min.js and and reveal.css files with the latest from this repository.. Thanks for the PR. Can you provide an example parallax configuration that shows what these values would be used for?\nI never really use parallax backgrounds myself but I figured the goal of it is for the image to cover the whole screen and scroll slightly with each slide change. That said I'm curious about how it would work with a repeating image.. I see. So you're essentially using the parallax background settings to set a fixed background image? The parallax fields were introduced specifically for the parallax/moving effect so they are needlessly complex for adding a regular background image.\nI like the idea of being able to set a presentation-wide background via configuration options. I'm going to merge your PR but in the future I'm going to rename the configuration fields so make it clear they can be used for non-parallax backgrounds too (parallaxBackgroundImage -> backgroundImage, parallaxBackgroundRepeat -> backgroundRepeat etc).\nCommits were merged into the dev branch: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/commits/dev. \ud83d\ude4c. Thanks @jurca! These changes have been merged in now.. Great update\u2013thanks!. Thanks for the PR but this is intentional. Clicking and navigating inside of the upcoming slide allows you to look ahead without showing your audience. In the slides.com speaker view we also added a button that allows you to jump to the upcoming slide and this is something I want to add to bring over to reveal.js as well.. Looks like a useful addition, thanks!\nI wonder if disableLayout is a more appropriate name. The config option disables the default layout logic, it doesn't really override it in itself. What do you think?. Thanks for updating!. You're welcome! Thanks for the \u00a9 update.. Hey. We're aware and working on restoring access. However this isn't the place for slides.com issues. Keep an eye on our Twitter for continued updates: https://twitter.com/slides. Thanks for the PR. Would be great to fix this \u2013 I've never noticed this since I've always checked the \"Background graphics\" when printing in Chrome. \nCan you check if the following fix works for you as well? It's cleaner if we can avoid !important overrides on a per-slide background basis. -webkit-print-color-adjust isn't needed as we already set that for the whole document in the PDF print sheet.\n@media print {\n    .backgrounds {\n        background-color: $backgroundColor;\n    }\n}. Great, thanks!. I think it'd be best to make the 1-based indexing optional to avoid breaking existing content. If you can revise that I'd be happy to merge this in. Thanks!. Thanks for updating. One more thing, can you change the merge target of the PR to the 'dev' branch? That's the working branch, we merge dev into master when a new version goes out.. Thanks for resolving the conflicts \ud83d\ude4c. Thanks!. Good catch documenting page up/down. I prefer the alphabet keys in uppercase as on a keyboard though. If you can roll that back I'll merge this in. Thanks!. Fixed in #2158 . Thanks!. Thanks for the clear instructions on how to reproduce this.\nI've debugged it and it's failing because head.js has a built-in timeout before it gives up on loading a script. From looking at the source, I think that value is hardcoded at 7s. Haven't found a way to work around/override the timeout but will keep looking.. I just pushed a fix for this to the dev branch. As of next version\u2013assuming all goes well in testing\u2013we'll drop the head.js dependency in favor of a simplified built-in script loader. This new loader fixes the issue when loading scripts on slow connections. Please do give it a shot if you get a chance :)\nNo plans for dropping highlight.js from the repo right now but thanks for the suggestion.. Thanks for the suggestion but I prefer leaving all of the languages in by default for ease of use. Smaller file size isn't a high priority since reveal.js is primarily used to present from your own local machine.\nI agree it's a inconveniently large file when your intention is to host the presentation. In that case you could build an optimized highlight.js version that contains only the language(s) you need.. \ud83d\ude4c. fixed by @sophware in #2340. The video control hit areas are offset from where the buttons are visually on screen. Looks like this only happens when reveal.js has scaled a presentation up. When I disable scaling (http://localhost:8000/?maxScale=1) the controls are working.\nNot sure what changed in Chrome but will try to find a workaround. Doesn't look like other browsers are affected.. Thanks Derek!\nThis issue was introduce with the new video controls in Chrome 67. I've filed an issue report with the Chromium team: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=862063\nreveal.js uses the CSS zoom property to scale content up in Chrome/Safari but the new video controls aren't compatible with zooming. One way to fix this is to switch to transform scaling in Chrome, but that has the downside of content being blurred when scaled up so I really want to avoid that.. As @nakolus mentioned, the Chromium team has fixed this issue. The fix is targeted for Chrome 69.. Hey. We don't have any element with an id matching '#header' as in your change, so I'm not sure what this does. Also if you want to change the CSS you'll need to change the reveal.scss file since reveal.css is generated from that.. Hey! Yes, the best way to do this is to insert the iframe as a slide background (data-background-iframe) https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#iframe-backgrounds. This should be fixed now \u2013 see comment in #2199.. Thanks for the PR but this had already been addressed by someone else in fa8a7334ce2ea99a736dd5e72734b08fc01c6fdca. The change was in the dev branch, but I've released it in reveal.js 3.7.0 now. Please give it a shot and let me know if you encounter any issues.. reveal.js automatically hides slides that are three or more steps away for performance reasons. When you try to pain the canvas elements within those hidden slides your width/height measurements are coming out as 0.\nYou'll need to draw the canvas when the slide is shown instead. Change the bottom part of your code to:\n```javascript\nfunction drawCurrentSlide() {\n   Array.prototype.forEach.call(\n        Reveal.getCurrentSlide().querySelectorAll('canvas.buggy'),\n        function(canvas, ii) {\n            draw(canvas);\n        });\n}\nReveal.addEventListener('ready', drawCurrentSlide);\nReveal.addEventListener('slidechanged', drawCurrentSlide);\n```. Both changes make sense \u2013 thanks!\nThe resume button was added because some people were accidentally triggering the pause mode and getting stuck without knowing how to disable it.. Background images are now applied to a separate node inside of .slide-background. If you expand the background node, you'll find .slide-background-content inside which does have the background image set as an inline style.\n\n. \ud83d\ude4c. I've merged in the fix in #2251 \ud83d\ude4c. Videos can only autoplay on page load if they're muted. As far as I can tell there is no way to work around this since it's a browser limitation.. Makes sense, thanks!. The fix in #2104 has been merged in now. It's currently only available in the reveal.js dev branch, but will be released in the next version.. This issue was previously reported in #1922, and fixed by #2104. The fix is currently only available in the dev branch but will make its way out with the next reveal.js release.. Thanks for pointing that out, I've updated the readme.. Thanks for the PR. I've addressed this in a slightly different way in 6abc6e00581e66690416978de118145e854c3c1e\nBy removing the .reveal prefix we're affecting styling of the page as a whole which might cause styling conflicts with the surround page. Because of that I think it's better to move the reset styles to a separate file so that you can easily leave them out if you want to.. There's slides.com\u2014a presentation platform and editor built around reveal.js. However the GUI editor that we've built for Slides isn't available open source so it can't be integrated into your own CMS. We're looking at options for enabling integrations like that in the future though.. This is great. Thanks for the fix! . upgraded to 2.2.0 in the dev branch baac3413ed2ede52359edcf03d14279bfa5d8ec7. Good catch thanks for the fix!. Looks like the state events are being fired too early, before reveal.js has actually switched to the next slide. So your Reveal.nextFragment() call is received in the context of the previous slide unless you use a timeout.\nWill fix this by adjusting the event order.. This issue has been fixed and I've added some tests for state events: 42e796afb2a4db10772cf0f4b517094c0fbec644\nThe fix is only available in the dev branch so far, but if you look at the diff you could mirror the change in your local reveal.js file.. Makes sense, thanks!. There's no config option for this but you can manually change it in the reveal.js file here: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/js/reveal.js#L2264\nThat line of code aims to scale slides so that five of them can fit on screen at the same time, but never smaller than 150px.. Thanks but getSlides() is the right method in this context. The issue this is trying to fix has already been fixed in another way (see my comment in #2243).. Alt + Click is the right shortcut, but we use Ctrl + Click on Linux systems. This was changed in a PR a few years back because someone discovered the Alt + Click didn't work in Linux.\nSorry about the confusion. I've updated that slide in the demo presentation 82076c5a0b1aebe7acd0db1886be9dd6445fa68f. This is great, thanks!. This has been asked about a few times so I've added a config option for it. In future versions of reveal.js, if you include gridNavigation: true navigating between adjacent vertical stacks will keep you at the same vertical index. More info in the docs here: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/dev/README.md#vertical-slide-navigation\nNote that this only available in the dev branch so far. It'll make its way out with the next release.. I think the fix in #1188 made sense so I've merged that instead. Thanks for providing another option though.. There are a number of restrictions around what videos a browser will autoplay. If the video has sound, the user needs to explicitly request the video to be started via an interaction. Here's more info about how these rules are implemented in Google Chrome: https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes. No problem. Yes, when you press a keyboard button the video is being played as a result of a direct user action so the browser allows it. . Judging by the amount of times this has come up it'd make sense to add some built-in styling for it. Using stacked fragments as shown in the Stack Overflow answer is a good approach. If we combine that with some simple built-in styling for stacking multiple elements we should be able to do something like:\nhtml\n<section>\n  <div class=\"fragment-stack\">\n    <h2 class=\"fragment\">First this</h2>\n    <h2 class=\"fragment\">Then this</h2>\n  </div>\n</section>\nAnd for fixed-size elements like images:\nhtml\n<section>\n  <div class=\"fragment-stack\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 480px;\">\n    <img class=\"fragment\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"img1.jpg\" />\n    <img class=\"fragment\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"img2.jpg\" />\n  </div>\n</section>. Merged into the dev branch, thanks!. Thanks for the PR. I like the idea of a 'navigationMode' config value that incorporates all three of these navigation settings. Gonna take a look at how to best implement it that way.. I've made a number of changes to this:\n1. All options are now part of a new 'navigationMode' config value as suggested.\n2. I renamed 'simple' to 'linear' to try to convey what changes.\n3. When linear is used, the vertical arrows are automatically hidden.\n4. The visible control arrows on screen now follow the same behavior, so clicking the right arrow when 'linear' is enabled will also step through vertical slides.\nHere's the documentation:\nhttps://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/dev/README.md#navigation-mode. Thanks!. Had to revert this, window.crypto doesn't exist in Node.js so this threw an exception that prevented the multiplex server from working.. Makes sense to make that configurable, thanks!. Thanks for the suggestion! I really like the reveal.js.org domain but from what I understand we can only have one domain in the pages CNAME file. That said, I prefer the existing \"revealjs.com\" so I'm not ready to let that go and switch domains.\n . Good catch, thanks!. makes sense, thanks!. Good catch. Thanks!. We don't preload iframes the same way since they are often used to embed autoplaying video, audio, or other similar content.\nIn those cases you'd end up hearing the audio of something that isn't visible yet. Even if it's a muted video player, if it autoplays it would be playing while invisible so that viewers would be missing out on some of the content.\nOne more consideration is that iframes can be used to pull in performance heavy content which you don't always want running in the backgrounds. For example, I embed a lot of visual canvas experiments in my talks and having multiple of those load at the same time would cause the computer to \ud83d\udd25\nThat said it might be interesting to add an option for changing this behavior, on a per-iframe bases.. Lazy loaded data-src iframes aren't preloaded according to viewDistance. They load when their containing slide becomes visible and unload again when it's hidden.\nMaybe we can add a <iframe data-preload> attribute that flags that the given iframe should be loaded according to viewDistance?. Thanks for the PR! The combination of a configured default + attribute overrides looks great. A couple of notes:\n- The diff on reveal.js doesn't actually include the \"preload\" config value described in the readme. Maybe a commit is missing?\n- I suggest renaming the preload config value to preloadIframes since it only affects iframes.\n- Please submit this PR towards the dev branch. That's where the latest code lives and PRs are merged into before a new reveal.js version is released.. Doesn't seem like this is used, can it be removed?\n. You should be able to use currentSlide to reference the present slide and cut back on the condition here. Though a null check for currentSlide is probably a good idea.\n. Cloning a full slide and injecting it into the DOM like this would cause everything in that slide to run twice. For example, if there's an auto-playing video in the target slide two copies of that video would play. Would it be enough to just copy the text contents of the slide (dom.statusDiv.innerHTML = slides[index].textContent;) or are other tags important? \n. Looks like this is giving a false positive. The md file parses into a presentation where \"Slide 1.1\", the code sample and \"Slide 1.2\" are all on the same slide. The selector still returns a length of 2 since \"Slide 2\", which is intended to be a horizontal slide, actually becomes a vertical slide.\n. Got it. Looking at it again I can see the vertical separator test was carried over from the test-markdown.js file, I'll revise it to match the simple.md that test-markdown-external.js tests against.\n. Can we remove this? Feels a little unexpected that disabling the layout is mutually exclusive with setting the display style.. Good catch, just merged this and will fix the typo.. ",

    "jmikola": "@hakimel: Is this still necessary? I often find myself overriding this style (back to max-height: inherit) for slides whose only content is a code block. Without a max-height, very long blocks of code will just hang off the screen, rather than appear with a scrollbar in presentation view (and clipped content with no scrollbar when printing). At that point, I know it's time to reduce the amount of code in the slide :)\n. Noted. It's trivial to override in a presentation's own CSS or a shared theme, so no worries.\n. Interesting.

If there isn't a way to disable exiting fullscreen with ESC then I'm in favor of a different (or at least configurable) key.\n. 'o' as an overview key seems like a good idea as an alternate key. Or, like you said, options for all keybindings (although this may make Reveal.js presentations seem incoherent if everyone chooses different options)\n. Yeah, a +1 from me. I have a responsive site and it'd be awesome to have a responsive slideshow as well.\n. Oops, looks like my pull request hates all non-Webkit browsers. Submitting another one...\n. Bam. Fixed. Sorry about the delay, even robots like me need to eat sometimes.\nNow, all that needs to happen is for @hakimel to accept the pull request... {hint hint}\n. This fixes issue #49.\n. This fixes an issue which would be created if not for my testing: the page would push content all over the place, up, down, and off the screen, thanks to me being percent-happy.\n. You're welcome. I just discovered this and found it to be an exceedingly awesome project.\n. OK, thanks.\n. I can get cracking on it if it's something you'd like and if @hakimel doesn't care about having a bit more bloat. He probably won't mind - reveal.js is quite large - but I'd better check first.\nI've always wanted to add it, and this may be the perfect time. Maybe for 2.2 or 2.5?\n. Well, I can't speak for @hakimel, but I do think that having separate files for each theme might be a plus. I'd certainly be willing to help create some new themes.\n. Okay, awesome! I'll try to produce a few more.\n. More themes in #106!\n. Okay, awesome! I have a few more ideas that I'd like to get in for 2.0 (more themes, 2D compat with more browsers). I'll try to submit a pull request today.\n[edit: #106 is where I'm pushing my themes to, as well as some theme modifications and some other stuff I want to be in 2.0]\n. ahem? @hakimel could you please work this into reveal.js?\n[edit: thanks {it's now worked in}]\n. You could shoot me an email - I'd be happy to help. [owenversteeg] [at] [live] [dot] [com]. I'm not a reveal.js genius like @hakimel, but I do know a fair bit about reveal.js.\nOther than that, I'd follow @hakimel's advice. @piatra's suggestion is a great one - StackOverflow is a wonderful site - but only if your question is related to programming.\n. Awesome. I've liked it. One thing I noticed about reveal.js's page is that it lacks an icon. I'm OK with Inkscape and could make one.\nAny other services that we could promote reveal.js on?\n. Awesome. Should I use the photo from Facebook at http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/228464_315215068575319_1648663581_n.jpg or should I create a new logo with Inkscape?\np.s. You mentioned that you hadn't used a mouse in a while on some other issue. How do you develop on a tablet? Cloud9?\n. @ your first comment Aha. Well, that explains it. I guess I shouldn't jump to conclusions :)\n@ the second comment: Okay, great. I didn't actually make one. I guess that I should just upload the Facebook photo to reveal.js's alternativeto page?\n. I agree with @hakimel that more nesting would be complex and confusing. To add to the list of ways to create extra nesting, I have a few more suggestions:\n- an  with a subpresentation in it inside a slide\n- little tiles that expand when you mouse over them inside a slide\n- Putting a presentation made with another framework inside an iframe inside a slide (maybe embedding an impress.js presentation)\n. Yeah, they were cut off for me as well. Try typing characters like \"y\" or \"g\" (lowercase) as a link placeholder.\n. Awesome. I added this to my copy of reveal.js a while back, but must have missed this improvement while moving my changes to GitHub. Thanks.\n. Huh? reveal.js already has mousewheel support. Simply scroll thru the slides.\nDon't want to be limited by the screen size? What does that mean?\nSorry, I'm a bit confused about what you mean.\n. Aha. So - if I catch your meaning - which I potentially don't - you'd like the slides to be able to be larger than the screen size - so that users could scroll down to read more content?\nAnother idea that I picked up from your comment previously was to let the slides be scrollable with the bar at the bottom of the screen - turning that into a scrollbar as well as an indicator. If @hakimel approves, I could make that fairly easily.\n. Awesome, thanks. I've always wondered whether this is a bug or not. Lemme see whether this speeds up the Overview Mode.\n. Agree with @dandv that beginners won't look at tests - just make them as separate as possible from the normal code and mention that the tests might not be good for beginners and you're good.\n. ```\nI've seen places that say that @import is a bad idea. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1022695/difference-between-import-and-link-in-css is one.\nOH NOES NOT @IMPORT NO NO NO HELP WHAT HAS THIS WORLD COME TO WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE NO NO NOOOOOOO\n```\n. Okay, sounds good.\np.s. I'd be fine with making some more themes - how many would you like to include in reveal.js?\nSample ideas:\n- Terminal (sort of like the Terminal theme in Gmail)\n- Metro (like the Windows 8 Metro theme)\n- Bright (someone I introduced to reveal.js remarked that everything looked a little dark and gloomy - this would attempt to alleviate that)\n. Hmm.\nThe warning about \"Resource interpreted as Font but transferred with MIME type font/truetype: \" is just a warning, and doesn't affect reveal.js. It's just letting you know that Google's WebFonts are a bit screwy.\nTry to inspect (right-click on the black portion and click Inspect Element) the black portion of the screen. Tell us what Chrome Dev Tools tells you - what's it's ID, what is its' width, what is is doing there, etc.\nTry this on a different OS, if you can. I'm assuming you're running Ubuntu, but I can't tell with the low-res image.\n. I agree. Reveal.js seems to be taking off (what with the GUI editor and all) and I love shiny badges.\n[edit: yeah, hakimel makes a great point]\n. I have access to two brand-new Galaxy S IIIs. If anyone has anything they want to test I'd be happy to try it.\n. This seems like an awesome feature. I'm a little swamped with my courseload right now but I'll try to work on one this weekend if @hakimel doesn't have the time/would rather I do it.\n. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this somewhat of a duplicate of what happens when you press ESC or pinch currently?\n[edit: yeah, this is called overview mode]\n. Wow! That's a really interesting bug!\nI'll take a look at the code later this afternoon, but it might be because of reveal.js's markdown parser rather than reveal.js itself.\nMaybe try this with something other than reveal.js that has Showdown, which is reveal.js's markdown parser.\n. Aww, I liked it and I thought it should be added to the core... it's only 315 lines!\nAlthough I can definitely see what @hakimel is saying here, I like it. Maybe create a plugin or a bookmarklet. I'm not sure if this is possible (haven't seen much of the code yet) but I think it's pretty cool and I'd like to use it.\np.s. @hakimel Will the code for rvl.io be put on GitHub soon, or ever? I have a ton of stuff I'd like to add.\n. Awesome. I guess that'll break some things though...\n. I guess this enables zooming on alt+click of something?\n. A loud yay from me if they\u2019re going to be LESS, a smaller yay for SASS.\noh well, I guess I\u2019ll have to learn SASS. Shouldn\u2019t be that hard\n. Wow, this is awesome. I hope @hakimel adds this to rvl.io soon.\nI don't have any improvement suggestions - if you want pretty slides, you have to work hard to get them, I guess. Although your explanation seems fairly simple...\n. This also fixes the same bug in IE10 that I would've reported but I forgot to.\n. @suchetana I'm not sure. This is probably a separate issue.\n. I recommend Mixpanel if anyone's looking for a short-term solution - they've replaced Google Analytics for me. \n(I'm not affiliated with Mixpanel, just a really happy user of their awesome analytics)\n. Replicated on Windows 8 IE10, Chrome 24, Firefox 14, Opera 12.\nI have a fix, might make a pull request later.\n. Works for me on Chrome 25.0.1330.0 canary but I had the same issue when printing a presentation for a robotics team I mentor.\n. Weird. I couldn't reproduce it on Chrome 25.0.1330.0 canary but I saw this happen with rvl.io a few weeks ago when I was printing a PDF of some slides.\n. What OS/browser? WP8? WP7? WP7.5? A dev release?\nI'd be happy to help. I have the simulator installed but no real device, though.\n. Worked for me, Chrome 25.0.1334.0 canary on Win 8.\n. I have three Win 8 computers (a selfbuilt desktop, an Ideapad Yoga + an Inspiron) and I can test this on them.\nFrom my experience with hammer.js (an awesome project) IE10 and IE on WP8 actually are the only two browsers to implement the spec correctly. However, they also support touch events in the exact same (wrong) way as other browsers do for compatibility - they just need some CSS to tell them to deviate from the spec.\nhtml { \n    -ms-touch-action: none;\n}\nI'm testing this & sending a pull request now.\n. Okay, this is a lot more challenging than I thought; I've spent a few hours on it and made no progress whatsoever.\nWeird, since this approach worked with Hammer.js.\n. Sure. I'm off to test it right now.\n. NOOO! It doesn't work in the least in IE10. Chrome works fine.\nConsole doesn't show any errors aside from some XHR ones (which, of course, disappear when not opened locally)\n. Awesome! Looks cool. I love Markdown.\n. Awesome! Personally, I've never made anything that huge but I've seen some presentations that could use this.\n. Looks awesome! I don't use RTL mode but I'm sure a ton of people do want it.\n. The downloads section is good for this, IMHO. \nMaybe a download of only what one needs to get started?\n. I'd say a bug in rvl.io; try to reproduce it by adding it to the exported slides and seeing if it looks OK.\n[EDIT: I meat rvl.io not reveal.js, just changed that]\n. Wow, this looks really incredible! I totally understand how @hakimel wants to keep reveal.js small though.\nWhen you have a separate repo up (or when it's in the NPM registry) let me know!\n. Use an iframe; put the presentation in another page and iframe it.\nOr, use the srcdoc attribute on the iframe if you want to include the whole thing in one page.\n. Sure, I just added it.\nhttps://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Recommended-Hardware\n. Wow! I'll test this soon. Thanks!\n. Works like a charm. Thanks so much!\nIf you see #300 you can see that I tried this via CSS but had no luck. I guess JS was the way to go!\n. aha. Yeah, in hindsight I should've tried the wrapper.\nI know JS/CSS usually does the same thing but sometimes it turns out differently because of CSS importances.\n. @hakimel Yep, moving it to CSS still works. Tested on IE10 on Windows 8 just a few seconds ago.\n. reveal doesn't use jQuery, so I'd use a vanilla JS approach.\n. hmm, I'll try to look into this.\n. Oops, looks like accidentally included README edits. I just reverted those [sorry for the deluge of commits]\n. Sure, I just added it. #487 \n. I think Reveal uses a separate Markdown library. data-markdown (https://gist.github.com/paulirish/1343518) modified to use Marked (https://github.com/chjj/marked). So I'd look into if it's those libraries fault.\nOn the other hand, it might be that data-markdown sections apply a weird font (?) - try webinspecting the data-markdown and changing the font to Segoe UI Symbol, it has a ton of glyphs.\n. #467's older brother with less commits.\n. Okay, new PR incoming.\n. The second PR is to fix the serif theme's SCSS, the first is to fix the sky theme's SCSS.\n. Same as #34 and #42.\nYou can change it if you want.\n. @Schepijs If you've solved the problem, you can close this issue with the little \"Close this issue\" button at the bottom.\n.

How it handles when there is multiple fragments in the same svg file ?\n. Thanks !\nI don't really understand why you need to compile javascript to have another javascript code but whatever :-)\nAnd last, what is a polyfill ?

A simple proposal would be te call Reveal.sortFragments(document.querySelectorAll(\"section.present\")); at the end of each SVG load. But actually sortFragments does not seem to be exposed.\n.

    "sressler": "Thanks...yeah now I'm trying something simpler and am could use a hint ;-) Instead of keeping everything in one big file I set it up to there is a main slide show (main.xhtml) and for those large slides I just directly link to a new file (fork1.xhtml). Problem is that when in fork1.xhtml I want to click a link and go back (there are actually several slides in the fork1 file) to the original main.xhtml file at the slide location where I left it. This is simply emulating the back button but it always takes me to the beginning of main.xhtml because it is all one file. Specifying a #name in the href also doesn't work. I think I need to specify a specific slide number (probably using the navigateTo function) but I'm confused about and I suspect there is a really easy way to do this ...I hope ;-)\n. An inelegant but workable solution: open up a new web page via the target attribute of an anchor tag.

A separate presentation seems to be the way to go, as long as there are \"back\" links to the origin \"main\" slide.\n. Fixed by commit 9747673e06872c3c15ae782e63160a194fb4099a\n. How about margin-left: 1em; instead of margin: 0 auto; for .reveal ol, .reveal ul ?\nThe outer div already has text-align: center. Seems to look fine in Chrome and Mozilla.\n. Arrow position is off in Komodo Edit's internal browser tab (whatever rendering engine that thing runs, Mozilla?), so might as well keep the px-based positioning for the four arrows and have the user deal with resizing the control if they want to.\n. This behavior confused my HTML5-illiterate colleagues too. They thought only the current column should move.\n. Well, beginners just won't look at tests... been there, done that ;)\n. I plan to upgrade form a rather old RevealJS to the latest master. When I do so, I'll be creating a suite of manual tests, mostly regression. Maybe that will help seed the automated test suite?\n. Here's how to do it: have the following CSS rules in your theme customizations, a CSS file you load after reveal.css and the theme CSS:\n```\n.reveal .slides {\n  height: 100%;\n  top: 0;\n  margin-top: 0;\n}\n.reveal .slides>section {\n  min-height: 90%;\n}\n.reveal .slides>section>section {\n  min-height: 100%;\n}\n```\n. Try a separate file (so you're sure the CSS rules are overridden correctly). Also try the zoom transition and the beige theme, so the top margin doesn't appear visible. This setup works for me (I've just tested).\n. That's a pretty cool idea.\n. Sure, but I would still have to do all the wiring and styling myself, and later when #137 is implemented, I'd have to change my implementation.\nAlternatively, I've tried adding this CSS rule,\n.reveal a.down:after {\n  content: '\\25BC';\n}\nand then including in the footer <a class=\"down\" href=\"#\"></a>, but the arrow is rendered twice, and only the extraneous occurrence is clickable.\nHow difficult would it be to support arbitrary user controls this way?\n. I would actually like to keep the default controls, and add other instances of them, like the down arrow in the footer for \"more\" (vertical) slides, the up arrow to go back up, or left/right arrows to the left/right of the slide to simulate the classic carousel/image slider control.\n. @hakimel: I've just tried removing the default controls anyway, and adding the .controls and .down classes (I assume you meant .down vs. .bottom) around a Unicode arrow, but the control isn't displayed. Here's the gist.\nBesides that, I'd like to be able to keep the default controls. Will you accept a patch to support multiple instances of a control if I volunteer one?\n. @kapelskic: these guys have a really cool example of navigation controller that you can drag around, and stays there: http://www.ideapolisagency.com\n. @kapelskic: Which forums?\n. Had the same trouble with Unicode arrows in #119, and this fix would eventually close #137.\n. What I meant was that keys don't seem to do anything any more in IE9. Neither arrow keys, nor Home/End/PgUp and PgDown naviage through slides. Just tried at http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js with IE 9.0.8112.16421.\n. Just confirmed with another IE9 user. No movement on arrow key presses.\n. Sounds good, let me revise my patch.\n. https://app.manymo.com/emulators/17/connect is an excellent Android 2.3 emulator.\n. Agree this shouldn't be core. I was just wondering if a plugin would be interesting. For now, I've implemented a crude solution by doing a GET request in slidechanged for the current slide's path URL, so that it shows up in the server logs.\n. I keep seeing this on forums: don't bump old threads. Why exactly? To create a new duplicate thread?\nI don't think you should be sorry at all for commenting on this issue.\n. That won't help. The problem with slideChanged is it fires too late, after reveal calls updateSlides(), which does the transition.\n. Ah, sorry about the false alarm. Turns out that SoundManager2 takes about the same amount of time to actually play the sound after play() is called, as the transition takes.\n. Same in IE9, actually, at the latest commit that renamed/moved the highligher plugin.\n. +1. Also +1 for pushState() instead.\n. I use the Sky stylesheet and various customizations in a complex presentation. The PDF display has a lot of problems, so I started isolating them by testing on the demo. But it looks like it's going to be quite complicated to get a clean output.\n. @dylang: Before this commit, I've also put together a presentation with lots of iframes, and I wrote a short function to enlarge any element with a class fit to fit the slide area between the top of the element and the footer\nYou can see how it works at Blueseed presentation for startups.\nI need to test this commit. Might do what I've been doing manually; otherwise, @hakimel I could publish it as a plugin.\n. How about stripping the HTML tags and getting only the text contents?\n. Sad to see the rolling links go. If the more common case is to have single-line links, perhaps it would serve more users to keep them and document the issue with multi-line links?\n. Sorry, just got around to this. Here is the deck, and the transition discrepancy can be seen at slide 3.\n. ",

Just tossing in two cents: I agree with @hakimel that keeping the UI uncluttered is nice.\nI personally think that keeping the existing progress bar and just giving each <section> -- whether a regular horizontal slide or a vertical slide or fragment -- equal spacing in the progress bar. That'd actually be nice in particular if you accidentally skip a bunch of vertical slides -- you'll see the progress bar jump forward more than usual.\nI personally think fragments shouldn't be included -- they're for visual effect more than progress -- but that's just a matter of taste.\nThanks for the great framework @hakimel!\n. I ran into this too FWIW, but I also don't have any idea how to fix it. =) Maybe zooming out, but I don't know how to query the paper size, etc.\n. :+1:\nPerhaps this could be consolidated: instead of setting width/height, respect the element's already-set width/height, and just use a zoom/scale transform instead. Because if I want to adjust the layout of the element, I can already set width/height 100% myself.\nThis'll then be the same solution for all elements: iframes, images, videos, arbitrary divs, etc.\n. You're right that this was more important before fixed-size slides (#300). With fixed-size slides, you're right that if you know the aspect ratio of an image, you can scale it to fit yourself.\nIt's still useful for cases where you don't know the size/ratio of images in advance, or you don't want to hardcode that into the presentation.\nFor iframes, it'd also be useful since you'd have to apply a transform. No biggie, but it's more user-friendly if Reveal can easily take care of that for you since it already has code to do this for fixed-size slides.\nFinally, it's actually super useful for dynamic content -- like a code sample. (Edit: by dynamic, I mean where you don't easily know the width/height while authoring; it gets laid out by the browser.)\n. Yes, +1, I ran into this too a while back.

Does the notes window pop open at all?\n. Well, I really wanted/needed this, so I spent some time these past few days crafting a little something myself! =) Check it out in action:\nhttp://aseemk.com/talks/neo4j-lessons-learned#/\nIt's simple/minimal, and it's a little rough around the edges, but it works! And boy, it feels great. I stayed with the route of showing the talk in an <iframe>, but:\n- The notes update on changes to this iframe's navigation, not an opener window. This works without having to inject any extra JS into the Reveal HTML (e.g. to postMessage()), since the iframe is in the same domain.\n- I apply a CSS scale (zoom) transform to the iframe to shrink the slides if needed, and I don't stretch it beyond the resolution I crafted the slides for (1024x768 in this case); I don't want to change the layout.\n- The hash of this page mirrors the hash of the iframe.\n- I ideally wanted to proxy/relay all keyboard events too, but I wasn't able to figure out a generic way of doing so, so the code currently just reimplements simple left/right arrow handling for now.\nI went with a pseudo-fluid/responsive layout where the notes go on the side when your screen is wider than the slides, or below when your screen is taller. It's again not amazing, but it works and feels nice.\nSource:\nhttps://github.com/aseemk/aseemk.com/blob/develop/talks/neo4j-lessons-learned.html\nhttps://github.com/aseemk/aseemk.com/blob/develop/styles/talk.css\nhttps://github.com/aseemk/aseemk.com/blob/develop/scripts/talk.js\nLike I said, this is currently pretty custom and simple, but I hope it helps inspire you to consider creating something similar for Reveal in general!\nThanks again for the great tool, @hakimel. Cheers.\nP.S. FWIW, I couldn't come up with a way for this to work/feel great on mobile, so any tips/advice/suggestions welcome. I also haven't tested this in IE, but did in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox, all on Mac.\n. I'd be happy to, but it'd be nice to think through some of the details first.\n- How exactly should it integrate with Reveal? Like the notes plugin, where you press a key and a new window pops up? Probably not that, since this is meant for sharing. So perhaps a query string option, like ?print-pdf?\n- The current implementation uses the talk wrapped in an <iframe>. This can work, but it means the visible URL would be a generic URL, like share.html, with the specific talk's URL not visible, or in the query string. This isn't a big deal if you're using the entire Reveal directory for one talk, but it's not ideal if you have multiple talks (issue #278).\n- So if we don't want to wrap the talk in an <iframe>, and instead want to have this plugin (when activated) just change the display/view of the talk page (which I think would be great), do I just scale div.reveal? Is it \"bad\" if the notes then aren't inside div.reveal? (div.slides doesn't work because it doesn't include the progress bar, navigation controls, etc.) Should I wrap the presentation in a new div.presentation in this case so the notes can still be inside div.reveal?\n- What size should the presentation be? Great that you opened issue #310 to support \"fixing\" the resolution generally; if you think you'll implement that anytime soon, this plugin could and should use that same config.\n- By having this plugin modify / take over the talk page directly (i.e. instead of wrapping it in an <iframe>), we also solve the keyboard event relaying problem. If we <iframe> it, I'd probably just expose Reveal's key event handler function, so I can call it from the outer window.\nWriting all this down was really helpful, and I think all signs are pointing to the thought this plugin would be best created after you implement issue #310. With that solved, the slides would be in a proper fixed-size container, allowing this plugin to add the notes below/alongside that container.\nWhat do you think?\n. Nice!\n. I'm not sure if newlines are the best way to go about separating slides, but I do agree it'd be great if there were a way to author a whole presentation in Markdown.\nThere's value to being able to specify ids and classes to occasional slides (e.g. for custom styling or linking), so the solution should support that.\nThe popular/mainstream Markdown implementations in PHP and Ruby (PHP Markdown and Maruku, respectively) both support specifying ids/classes for headers, as well as embedding Markdown in block-level HTML elements...\nhttp://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/#html\n...which could both work, but Showdown doesn't seem to support either yet:\nhttps://github.com/coreyti/showdown#known-differences-in-output (second bullet)\nTricky, but agreed, if there's a good way to achieve this, it'd be great to have. Thanks @webpro.\n. Ah, so you're saying don't actually process the Markdown file first -- just manually replace a few things and then treat it as if it were the innerHTML of <div id=\"slides\">?\ni.e. You're not really writing Markdown necessarily, just HTML with a convenience \"magic string\" to separate slides. (To this end, you might not even need to put this content in a separate file then. It could just be the original HTML content of <div id=\"slides\">, maybe with e.g. data-markdown on that slides container div.)\nVery interesting idea. That could work, and then you wouldn't be subject to the Showdown limitations I mentioned: e.g. you could wrap one or more slides in <section data-markdown id=\"foo\" class=\"foo\"> if you wanted.\nGreat suggestion. I think horizontal rules would be a better choice than newlines -- more visually obvious. The rule could also be fuzzy so you wouldn't have to memorize how many dashes (remember: if we're not processing the Markdown first, Reveal won't see any <hr> tags), e.g. \"newline followed by 2 or more dashes followed by newline\".\n. @hakimel, consider not requiring a separate file at all in that case. Here's a strawman proposal:\n``` html\n\n\nSlide 1\n\nSlide 2\n\n\n    # Slide 3\n\n\nSlide 4\nThis'll appear later.\n\nSlide 5\n\n\n```\nYou can see one tricky case to account for: supporting wrapping particular slides in <section>, but still demarcating the end of the previous slide w/ a horizontal rule. Maybe that isn't the best way to go about it.\n. Nice work so far! Tried it on my presentation and things generally work well.\nThe width/height config is interesting. 1024x768 is a good default, since that's the resolution of many projectors, and that was the resolution I needed to match for my presentation too. But, I authored the presentation with those dimensions in mind for the whole view(port)! Not the inner portion (which happens to be a div named slides.)\n(Edit: you can see this in my custom slides+notes viewer by the fact that the iframe is set to 1024x768.)\nIf it's not too late, what do you think of changing the semantics of the width/height config to include the padding (i.e. be derived after it, rather than before it)? This is sort of like how box-sizing: border-box is often more useful than content-box.\nEdit: and with that change, the slides div would ideally be flush with the parent reveal div if the viewport was exactly the width/height you specified in the config. Don't know if this makes some transitions harder to implement though.\n. Thanks Hakim, I'll try that when I get a chance.\n. Another thought that occurred to me: what does specifying the width/height as a config get you that just putting it in CSS wouldn't?\ncss\n.reveal > .slides > section {\n    width: 1024px;\n    height: 768px;\n}\nThe advantage to using CSS would be that I could override it for particular slides. E.g. if my slides are authored for 1024x768, but I'm viewing on a (widescreen) laptop, and one slide has a nice panoramic image.\nWith CSS, I could change that one slide to have 100% width and height instead of 1024x768 (which would get constrained to the laptop screen's height, making the pano just a fraction of the total screen).\n. I'm not sure I fully understand the issue, but I think I'm +1... experiencing this:\n1. Slide A specifies background A with transition slide\n2. Slide B specifies background B with transition none\n3. Slide C specifies background C with transition slide\nGoing from A to B looks good: B snaps in over A.\nGoing from B to C, however, doesn't.\nExpected: C slides in over B.\nActual: B snaps out, revealing the page background color; C then slides in over that.\nSimilarly, going from C back to B looks good (C slides out, revealing B), but going from B back to A does not (again, B snaps out, revealing the page background color; A then slides in over that).\n. Updated my comment \u2014\u00a0turns out this same problem manifests in the forward direction.\n. Oh, this does exist! It's called convex.\n. Perhaps this could be solved by just giving the default transitions their own explicit name also?\nThat would also avoid confusion like #1034: the default content transition has no name, but the equivalent background transition is named convex. Why not name the default content transition convex too? Then you could change the default, but always override back to convex.\n. Awesome @hakimel, thanks!\n. ",

Of course, FontAwesome is optional to reveal.js, so including it even just as a submodule in the repo feels somewhat out of place. Now that I'm slowly learning npm, I guess it would be better to have a separate reveal-FontAwesome package, that could be installed along with reveal, for those who need it. That separate package of course would instead use npm to get the FontAwesome sources.\nMaybe I'll try that at some point.\n. Indeed, when I wrote that post, I had just finally acquainted myself with npm. Immediately after, I went on to bower. Realising that FontAwesome would be a front-end dependency, it is clear that bower is more suitable than npm. Nonetheless, @hakimel  is right, that such a thing is clearly not core functionality to reveal.js, so it should probably be a separate bower-package.\n. How about HTML5 custom elements / web components:\nhtml\n<section>\n  <r-slide class=\"center\">\n    <div class=\"title\" -->...</div>\n    ... content ...\n  </r-slide>\n  <r-slide title=\"...\">...</r-slide>\n</section>\nThen, the wrapper div's would be hidden behind the shadow DOM of the custom element, where css centreing would be possible, without having to explicitly modify the DOM. Particularly, users could apply custom CSS to the contents without having to worry about the slide arrangement DOM elements. Furthermore, the complete theming CSS could be applied scoped to the shadow DOM, possibly relieving us from .reveal all over the theme CSS.\nI see great value in this, I'm almost tempted to give it a shot.... Well, yes and no. II would like to introduce three new classes, \"slide\" (indicating that an element is the canvas for exactly one slide), and two layout classes for the CSS transitions to indicate the relative placement.\nI guess the main conceptual difficulty I have is that I think there should not be such a thing as a \"horizontal slide\" or a \"vertical slide\". I would like to separate the concepts of laying out things on a slides, and the relative placement of slides. So there should only be \"slides\" and then something like slide layout. Things get mixed up because the inner <section> participates in both. From a CSS point of view, I think it would be cleaner if there was a separate element for each function. But writing that additional wrapper would be tedious and existing presentations would be incompatible.\nI have an experimental implementation in my fork's branch simplify-slide-API-ondev. The concept of a \"slide\" is important for CSS based layout on the slide, e.g. CSS based vertical centering, which I tried in css-based-vertical-centering-ondev. A merge of the two is still missing.\n. Very unlikely. The two views you see are completely unrelated documents, JS from one cannot see anything from the other. The only way goes through the socket server, which means you would have to manually serialise your interaction and apply it at the other end: Means, you would have to explicitly code it for each of your interactive charts. Then, reveal.js could provide a generic API to send JSON from one window to the other. Without checking, I assume this doesn't exist either yet, but would be easy to implement. . Fragments are Reveal's concept of animation steps. Also, you shouldn't have to override a global object like Reveal just to do something only locally relevant to a few slides.\nYou can use the data-fragment-index attribute to give an element a particular position in the fragment sequence, which you can use to define the number of fragment steps on a particular slide. Then you can hook into the fragment change events to initiate JS actions based on the fragment state.\nI personally find the current implementation of fragments a bit limited, which is why I made a few modifications.. What you are seeing is MathJax's fast-preview extension. It offers a configuration setting to disable it. However, if I remember correctly, Reveal.js does not provide full access to MathJax's configuration. You might get lucky by using a inline configuration section in your presentation markup. Alternatively, you can try my branch, implementing full access to the MathJax options.. ",

    "davidbanham": "Yeah I was a bit uncomfortable with the init code as well. The way it's set up you can just not touch the multiplex or notes configuration objects and it'll work as expected.\nI really wanted to pull everything out into a single \"options\" object, but the theme and transition options can only be called after initialisation and the multiplex script has to be loaded before initialisation.\nI think the best way forward would be to take the multiplex and speakernotes scripts out of head.js and load them independently after Reveal is initialised. That way all the core stuff is still loaded up front in head and the 'nice to haves' are loaded after. It also allows us to have a single configuration object in Reveal.initialize\nGlad you like it!\n. I've updated this to be compatible with 2.0 and brought the nodejitsu hosting back online.\n.

Maybe it's possible to have something like 1 finger swipe (resp. arrow-down key) vs 2 finger swipe (pgdn key), one does scoll, the other swipe? \nIf it has to be the same gesture, then I'd say make it dependent on the duration of the initial press down, (press - hold - swipe/drag) and give some visual feedback maybe? really a ordinary swipe swipes (hold ~ 0ms), and a press down/ hold some time (> x ms) / then drag switches to scroll mode?

    "bnjmnt4n": "This is because the </script> tag causes the browser to close the initial template script (<script type='text/template'>). For now, you can try replacing that with __SCRIPT_END__ to allow your Markdown code to be parsed properly.. Yup, recent versions of Reveal can use data-transition=\"none\" or even something like data-transition=\"none-in concave-out\".. Flashing seems to indicate some browser rendering issue, maybe you could try to optimize it by accelerating it to the GPU layer - maybe using will-change or translate3d.. Closing this for now as there\u2019s a working demo of this. Feel free to implement this as a plugin.\n. Thanks for all the info! I feel that this issue should be closed after 3 years of stagnation, as we want to keep the Reveal core lean, so we want to offload such code to other tools. Any useful tools should be added to this page to be shared with others. . @calevan\u2019s solution seems fine. Closing this for now since there\u2019s a plugin for it.\n. Due to the amount of work required, this feature probably won't make it into Reveal core. If you do want to experiment with vertical scrolling by default, feel free to release a plugin to share with others.. The Firefox bug appears to be fixed, so I\u2019m closing this.\n. This is probably a problem with the exported PDF or the tool used, and not specifically with Reveal.js. Closing this for now, as Reveal.js now has better support for exporting PDFs.\n. This doesn't seem to be a Reveal issue, more of a Markdown issue. Probably marked doesn't think that a single indented line is part of a code block, causing it to separate it.. Can't reproduce this issue on recent Firefox builds, closing for now.. Closing this at reveal.js already supports lazy loading of images and iframes.\n. Ah sorry, I kinda misunderstood the original point of this issue :'(\n. You can enable the speakerNotes option when printing.. Thanks for all the useful tools and tips! I'm closing this issue for now, but you can add some of the tools to the Plugins page to share it with others!. The slides controls will light up the down button if there are vertical slides, which serves as an indicator.\n. Closing since you seem to have found a solution.\n. :+1: Any update, @hakimel?\n. This seems to be fixed. Closing for now. (Sorry for the rrreeeeally long response time :'). The slides.com output is probably different from just plain Reveal, hence it is difficult for us to help you figure out the issues. There doesn't seem to be a clear error, just formatting issues, so you might have to check out the CSS yourself.. Yup, I don't see how this can be fixed easily, as we have to hide slides until they are displayed. Closing for now.. Maybe you could try positioning the slide itself as position: relative.. I think a simple solution would be to use npm modules, which are now typically used not just for JS files but also all sorts of assets.. Yep, PDF printing still has some issues in some browsers, but most features should be fine in most modern browsers. For now we recommend using in Chrome which is where most features work, including centering for now. I'll try to look at the code for printing to see what there is to do to improve things in Firefox.. I think this can be closed, as it works seems to work pretty well now.\n. Closing this as the print stylesheets already set font size to 20pt.\n. This works for me in Android. Closing for now until there are more details provided.\n. @trcook: seems like one of your data-attributes is wrong. As mentioned here, the attribute for the vertical separator should be data-separator-vertical.\n@anantshri: for the separator regexes, we are using native JS regex syntax, hence we will not be able to add additional features. You will probably need to use lookaheads in your regex, like data-separator=\"\\n(?=#\\n)\".. Can't seem to replicate this now, closing for now.. This can probably be done with:\nhtml\n<section data-background-video=\"http://clips.vorwaerts-gmbh.de/big_buck_bunny.mp4\"\n         data-background-color=\"#000\">\n</section>. This should be working fine currently.. @hakimel opinions? This also seems a bit of an edge case to me, you could do something like modify/remove elements from the DOM yourself and then Reveal.sync().\n. Closing this as there\u2019s already a plugin for this.\n. Ping?\n. Currently, vertical slides are indicated by a change in colour of the down button in the controls. Feel free to create a plugin for hinting.\n. I\u2019m not too sure about this. I don\u2019t have an iPad, so I can\u2019t test. Feel free to ping back with more details/fixes.\n. I don't think this is possible currently, and would require a lot of major code changes. @hakimel do you think this change is necessary?\n. @hakimel what do you think?\n. Closing this as it has since been fixed.\n. See https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/1519#issuecomment-298313406. We probably will not implement this in Reveal core, although it should be reasonably easy to do so yourself.. This doesn't seem to have to do with Reveal, and is more related to the Mermaid parser. On a side note, the next release of Reveal will allow customisations to the Markdown rendering engine, so you can pass your own renderer to integrate Mermaid into marked if possible (as mentioned in the first few comments).. ~~Closed~~ Implemented in #1506.\n. I don't think this is suitable for Reveal core, perhaps someone could make a plugin for this.. I'm unable to replicate this issue in the latest Firefox. Closing for now.\n. Closing this as a duplicate of #1290 which has been fixed.\n. Inserting a diagram should work pretty fine with Reveal. After inserting, try running Reveal.layout() to allow Reveal to reconfigure the display to account for the new content.. Great work, @j13z! :smiley: Would love to see this in, perhaps you could even consider replacing the MathJax plugin! ;)\n. Duplicate of #228. See https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/pull/228#issuecomment-10261098.. @maxmeyer Thanks!\n. We've since added grunt-cli to devDependencies to allow it to be used without global installation. I don't think adding the hostname option is a good idea as using Grunt as a wrapper to serve the code is not part of Grunt's scope of tasks, and there could be unexpected issues when doing so publicly. Instead you should use a specialised library for deployment.. Closing this for now as #1352 has already been merged, and there\u2019s already a plugin for that (maintained by me!).\n(The repo for my plugin is now at https://github.com/demoneaux/reveal-code-focus/.)\n. There is an API for Reveal.getSlides(). Alternatively you can use document.querySelectorAll('.slides > section') for horizontal slides or document.querySelectorAll('.slides > section > section') for vertical slides.. Currently, many plugins define themselves following the style RevealPluginName, following the original core plugins. Personally, that seems fine to me, although defining everything on the Reveal namespace would also be much more structured (eg. Reveal.abc). For passing in arguments or configuration though, I feel that plugins should standardise on using the Reveal configuration (through Reveal.getConfig().pluginName). Any opinions? /cc @hakimel. Can't seem to repro on latest Chrome/Safari. Closing for now. Feel free to re-open if you have more info.. Yep, duplicate IDs will probably cause some issues with slide navigation. Closing for now.. Sadly, the code for hiding the address bar no longer works reliably on modern mobile browsers. If anyone has a reliable method, please feel free to reopen this issue.. I think this is rather complicated, and won\u2019t be suitable for reveal.js, as there are many different elements, both block and inline with different semantics. Feel free to implement a plugin for this.\n. This can probably be done with ServiceWorkers, but I\u2019m not sure if they should be included in the core repository. @hakimel what do you think?\n. As mentioned here, fragments support the data-autoslide attribute to indicate the length of time before auto-sliding.\n. This can\u2019t be helped as each slide has a set width/height, so all text that overflows has to be cut off. You might want to split it into a different slide.\n. You can change the data-background of the slide, then call Reveal.sync().\n. @hakimel any ideas on how to solve this?\n. Yep, you have to use Shift + ? to get the ? symbol on a English keyboard. Alternatively, you can use the new Reveal.toggleHelp() method in v3.5.. This isn't a very good fit for the Reveal.js core library which aims to have a set of essential utilities. Feel free to create your own set of animations and share them here.. The format for Reveal.js slides has stayed mostly the same, so probably just updating the code files should be fine.\n. Closing as duplicate of #1145:\n\nThere isn't, reveal.js makes lots of changes to the DOM so it would be difficult to roll all that back. Perhaps you could work around this by reloading the page and not initializing the framework.. You can see this example from the readme:\n\nhtml\n<section data-markdown>\n    <script type=\"text/template\">\n    <!-- .slide: class=\"center\" -->\n        Markdown content\n    </script>\n</section>\nOr just add the class directly as well:\nhtml\n<section data-markdown class=\"center\">\n    <script type=\"text/template\">\n        Markdown content\n    </script>\n</section>. You can try placing the <!-- .slide: class=\"center\" --> after each --- for each slide.. The slide should be vertically centred, not too sure how to help you with that anymore.. The center class is used in JS to indicate that the slide should be vertically centred. See https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/713702a0ab81d1756a30e6c14ae49afd42135541/js/reveal.js#L1650-L1659.. There isn't a built in way to do that, you'll have to manually figure out the CSS and styles to make it work. The Reveal.js center will only center the whole slide.. This bug should be fixed in reveal.js v3.2.0.\n. This doesn\u2019t seem to have anything to do with reveal.js. Possibly your Sass has errors?\n. Yep, it will be applied to the HTML element. See here.\n. Fixed in #1636.. Not too sure if it's possible (I don't really use Polymer), but it probably won't be landing in this core repository. However, if you do want to experiment with implementing it feel free to do so.\n. I think using a state class is the best way to do that.\n. Couldn\u2019t this be done with text-align: left?\n. Not too sure whether it can be done, reveal.js is more for presentations. Feel free to try though :)\n. I'm not too sure as I personally don't use S3, but uploading the static files should be enough.\n. @hakimel any opinions on the current project structure?\n. I feel that the current structure is fine, with only the core code and a few plugins. Closing for now.. You can try to position all your titles absolutely at the same position.. Closing this for now since it seems that @gothma is right. Feel free to reopen if you encounter other issues.\n. Hi @sam-falvo! I'm not too sure what's wrong with the formatting, this seems to be more of a marked issue than Reveal. Perhaps if you could create a reduced test case showing the problem, it might be easier to solve. Feel free to re-open with more information.. Hi @sam-falvo! Really sorry for the ~~long~~ late response. I recently started contributing to the Reveal project, and wanted to help with the issues. I'm not too sure how you are formatting the Markdown code, which is why I asked for more information.\nAre you doing something like:\n```html\n\ntesting\nIO0  ----o 1   7 o---- IO4\nIO1  ----o 2   8 o---- IO5\nIO2  ----o 3   9 o---- IO6\nIO3  ----o 4  10 o---- IO7\nGND  ----o 5  11 o---- GND\n3.3V ----o 6  12 o---- 3.3V\n\n\n```\nWhat does your \"how I format it\" mean? Is the whole chunk in a code block?. Currently there are slight changes to the controls to indicate that there are slides at the bottom/side. If you want your own indicators, feel free to implement them in a plugin.\n. > \"Currently there are slight changes to the controls to indicate that there are slides at the bottom/side.\"  \n\nNo there aren't\n\nIf you take a look at http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/, as you scroll through the slides, the controls light up when there are vertical slides.\n\n\"If you want your own indicators, feel free to implement them in a plugin.\"\nAce. Presumably you are going to close all enhancement requests with the same response? \"do it yourself\"\n\nCurrently there are over 150 open issues in reveal.js, most of which are feature requests\n It would be difficult to implement all features requested while we only have limited time to maintain this open source project. Thus I think looking for plugins/creating your own plugin for a specific feature which is outside the core usage is fine.\n. It\u2019s possible, although for now you might have to do it manually. I\u2019ll close this as a duplicate of #788.\n. Closing this as a duplicate of #602.\n. This seems like some weird rendering bug in older versions of Firefox for Windows. Closing for now since I can't replicate this anymore.. @hakimel What do you think? IMO this use case shouldn\u2019t be happening a lot, so I would be fine not implementing this. Additionally, a different progress bar can also be implemented simply using the slidechanged event.\n. Hi @mandeeps708! Asking these kind of personal support questions is best suited to stackoverflow. I'm personally not very good at transitions, so I can't really help you. You might get better answers on stackoverflow or elsewhere.. I think this issue can be closed as iframes can be used and it shouldn't require anything from Reveal.js\u2019 side.\n. Closed as #1351 was fixed.\n. Closing this as a duplicate of #1230.. You can use an <img> tag or implement a custom marked renderer.\n. Fragments will have the class .visible, and the class .current-fragment when they are the active fragment. You can also use the fragmentshown and fragmenthidden event.\n. I can't seem to load the page. Feel free to ping back with more details.\n. This probably isn't the place to discuss as slid.es is a commercial product with their own processes and code which are in some cases different from Reveal. Perhaps asking on stackoverflow or their support channels would get you better answers. Closing this for now.. @hakimel opinions? This seems fine to me.\n. This is because your code block is not escaped. The browser interprets the button attribute as \"\", then highlight.js highlights the whole code. To prevent this, escape all HTML code properly.\n. Thanks for creating the plugin! Closing this for now.\n. Please take a look at the docs at https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#keyboard-bindings. You can pass a function Reveal.toggleFullscreen. Alternatively paying in a string will call the function on Reveal, so you can pass in the string 'toggleFullscreen' as well.\n. This is because it is loaded separately in the event loop. I think if you shift the remainder of code to the next script element it should be Able to work.\njs\n<script>\nReveal.initialize({ ...});\n</script>\n<script src=\"abc.js\"></script>\n. You can use a <textarea data-template> instead, as mentioned here: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#markdown. This seems quite specific, and is better suited to a plugin IMO. YouTube and Vimeo are used by a large number of people, while I think much less people use Asciicinema. Perhaps this is better suited to a plugin.\n. IMO functionality which isn't used widely shouldn't have a need to be in the core scripts. Although this might be a 3 line patch, if everyone were to submit small patches like this for every single service, the file would become extremely bloated. In the end though, it's up to @hakimel to make the decison.\n. Can't seem to replicate this issue anymore with latest Firefox 57, should be fixed already.. @hakimel what do you think about this? I can send in a PR for this if you\u2019re fine :)\n. @ducin Feel free to send in a PR. We\u2019ll try to merge it ASAP :)\n. Closed by #1545.\n. Closed by #1522.\n. By default, Reveal.js centers all slides. This can be disabled using Reveal.configure({ 'center': false }).\n. There\u2019s also a KaTeX plugin for Reveal.js at https://github.com/j13z/reveal.js-math-katex-plugin.\n. This will probably not land in the core Reveal.js repository, as it is too specialised. However, feel free to create a plugin for MarkDeep.\n. I think @spidergears is right, it doesn't make sense to lock users out of what they want to do.\n. This is currently not possible with Reveal, as it will try to search for an element with ID thePresentation/1. Instead of providing a deep linking structure, maybe you could use query parameters like #/1?presentation, which Reveal should not remove.. I believe this can be done with something like:\nhtml\n<ul>\n  <li class=\"fragment\">\n    <ul>\n      <li>text</li>\n      <li class=\"fragment\">text</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li class=\"fragment\">\n    <ul>\n      <li>text</li>\n      <li class=\"fragment\">text</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n. For now there aren\u2019t any events indicating when transitions end. You can use setTimeout to start drawing your charts after the transition ends though.\n. You can make two slides with no animations for the first one exiting, and no animations for the second one entering, so it would look like just the image is being replaced:\njs\n<section data-transition=\"fade-in none-out\"></section>\n<section data-transition=\"none-in fade-out\"></section>. Closed as highlight.js has been updated to 9.11.0 in Reveal 3.6.0.. Decktape has already been added to the bottom of the exporting PDFs section.\n. This is better suited for a plugin. Closing for now.\n. I\u2019m not too sure what you\u2019re referring to. Could you give more details/examples?\n. Closing for now due to lack of details. In the future feel free to ask such questions on StackOverflow.\n. This is currently not possible, and would require a lot of code to add this feature.\n. I believe this is because you are placing the Markdown with HTML elements in the <section> tag itself. This will cause issues as browsers will parse the HTML before marked, which can lead to inconsistent rendering. To prevent browsers from parsing the Markdown, you should place it in a script template:\n```html\n\n</p>\n<h2>Markdown</h2>\n<p><span>...</span>\n\n\n``. Reveal.js already has a progress bar at the bottom to show the overall slide progress. If you\u2019d like a mini map of the slides, that sounds like a great idea for a plugin! Feel free to create one and add it to the wiki.\n. @hakimel opinions? This seems fine to me :)\n. @hakimel what do you think? Personally I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very necessary.\n. Should be fixed in #1851..elements do not have thesrcattribute. If you\u2019re trying to load an external SVG, you can use.\n. Based on https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Browser-Support, only transitions are officially supported in IE9, so I\u2019ll be closing this.\n. @reagle currently there is no such way to do so that is built into reveal.js. I will mark this as a duplicate of #1465.\n. This seems like a request for #552, too allow embedding Reveal.js in a section of the page. Currently this isn\u2019t possible, and you should use an` if you need to do so. Closing as a duplicate of #552.\n. Hi @AnnotatedJS, I\u2019m not too sure exactly what you\u2019re referring to. Could you provide some additional details?\n. That\u2019s weird. Could you provide a reduced test case?\n. @WG-\n\nCan I make sure that the progress bar and the total slide numbers will only takes horizontal slides into account in displaying the progress?\n\nThis is currently not possible, as the progress bar takes into account both horizontal and vertical sides.\n\nCan I change the numbering of the vertical slides, that is to say. Slide 3.1 (the top vertical slide) will get the slide number 3. And slide 3.2 (the slide below the top vertical slide) gets the number 3.1?\n\nThere isn\u2019t a built-in way to do that, but you can follow @zionsg\u2019s method of modifying the contents of the .slide-number element when the \u201cslidechanged\u201d event fires.\n. No I don't believe this is possible, as it occurs on the client side and not on the server.\n. Closing, as none-in slide-out should be able to work.. Hi @DeastinY have you looked at the PDF exporting section of the readme? Please try to follow that and see if your slides are printed correctly.\n. Closing for now. Feel free to reopen if you encounter any issues.\n. Just changing the selectors like that isn\u2019t going to completely work, as there are other references to the current slides format within the code. For now, I think your use case is too obscure to implement such a setting, so I\u2019m going to close this. Feel free to modify your own copy of reveal.js.\n. @hakimel this seems like a simple doc fix. Should this be merged?\n. What's the exact code snippet that you used?\n. Closing this until I get more details. Feel free to ask questions like this on StackOverflow.\n. There doesn\u2019t appear to be a simple way to configure that without manually editing the HTML file, so for now I think that would be the recommended way.\n. This makes sense as a reload does not cause the slide to change, it loads the page again with a specific slide. You should probably use React.addEventListener('ready', fn) to initialize your code based on the current slide.\n. @hakimel opinions?\n. Currently this is not in the Reveal.js API, although it can still be retrieved.\n``` js\nvar prevSlide = { horizontal: null, vertical: null };\nReveal.addEventListener('ready', function(e) {\n  prevSlide.horizontal = e.indexh;\n  prevSlide.vertical = e.indexv;\n});\nReveal.addEventListener('slidechanged', function (e) {\n  // use previous slide information\n  // \u2026\n  // update previous slide information\n  prevSlide.horizontal = e.indexh;\n  prevSlide.vertical = e.indexv;\n});\n``\n. This is probably a false positive, also it was only detected by one AV vendor. It's probably an issue on their side and should be reported to them.\n. This doesn't seem to be reproducible for me. Can you provide a reduced test case which fails for you?\n. @h4xr is right, you should override the fonts in a separate stylesheet, so I think this issue can be closed as it isn't really related to Reveal.js.\n. IE 9 is supported in the [second tier](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Browser-Support), so it should work. Could you post a reduced test case?\n. Seems to work for me.. Marking this as a duplicate of #1089 for now. @hakimel do you have any opinions about this?\n. Should be closed with #1649.. LGTM.\n. I'm not too sure what you mean when you want to use Reveal as a website. If you want your website to look like a presentation, then it should work alright. There shouldn't be any security issues, it should just work like other Reveal. presentations.. Are you all using therollingLinksoption?\n. This doesn't seem to be an issue anymore, closing.. I\u2019m not too sure about this. I think the idea of having background videos were to have non intrusive videos playing at the back while having some content on the slides. I think in your case just adding a video into the slide is fine. @hakimel opinions?\n. I think this issue can be closed.\n. I don't seem to see any issues just loading those scripts along with a simple Reveal presentation. Your setup probably is a bit more complicated, and there might be issues with conflicts between your setup of Reveal and those libraries.. This should have been fixed in reveal.js 3.2.0. What version are you using?\n. Not too sure about that. It was mentioned in the change log of v3.2.0, so I thought it would be fixed. /cc @hakimel should have more ideas.\n. Apparently it\u2019s a CSS fix: 5e763bc67d140d1a41056c2e63f0fbe80c5d03ab\n. There aren't any built in features that allow you to limit navigation of slides like that. However, you can probably do something similar by listening toonslidechangedand switching the slide yourself. If you do create such a plugin, do add it to the [list](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Plugins,-Tools-and-Hardware) to share it with others.. Thanks for taking the time to make a plugin! Leaving it in the wiki page is fine, as it will increase views by users.\n. Closing as this has been fixed.\n. LGTM.\n. It's kinda complicated, but perhaps for now you can just explain the rationale of the second commit ~~PR~~?\n. Maybe we could add ablank.htmlfile with just a blank template, asindex.htmlis used to powergh-pages. @hakimel what do you think?\n. Embedding Reveal.js is currently not supported well; you should try putting your slides in a separate webpage, and embedding it in aniframeinstead. Related to #552.. See https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/1530#issuecomment-197401128.\n. This should probably be handled by a plugin. Looking at the [plugins page](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Plugins,-Tools-and-Hardware), there appears to be a library, [external](https://github.com/calevans/external), which allows you to import external HTML files, which might be what you\u2019re looking for.. You should try applying.stretchto the image instead of the figure, which should work fine.. Not too sure what's happening, as your upload didn't seem to work. Next time, try putting it in a gist instead, which would be more friendly to people looking at your code. Closing this for now, feel free to re-open with more information.. I don\u2019t see why this shouldn't use your browser's proxy settings by default as it is simply a normal iframe which is placed in the background. Perhaps you should check your settings again? Creating custom proxy settings is probably not required for most people using reveal.js.\n. Being served via HTTPS shouldn't affect it from being embedded, you should check if the page is allowed to be embedded (viaX-FRAME-OPTIONS).. Closed by #1550.\n. The slides have a default width and height, which are [specified here](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#presentation-size), and can also be customised. reveal.js also automatically scales slides based on the viewport size, which can also be configured.\n. I think this is too specific for the general Reveal.js project. Also, running thegruntscript to serve the presentation isn't recommended for production, and is only meant for development. @hakimel opinions?. I can't seem to reproduce this on Firefox/Chrome, closing for now.. Hmm, I think there's probably an issue with your code.is not valid and might cause some issues.. I don't believe this is an issue (at least not anymore).. @hakimel any opinions on this docs service, or do you think the readme is enough?. @hakimel any opinions? I think this might be quite useful.. You can try using [Reveal.registerKeyboardShortcut('key', 'description')](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/713702a0ab81d1756a30e6c14ae49afd42135541/js/reveal.js#L4737) to change the table.. You can do this yourself by loading a stylesheet based on the query string. For example, [the demo](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/c2997c605d969ae46180f0a714802511bb89dbc7/demo.html#L165-176) does something like that.\n. The docs now [does have that note](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#external-markdown), so I'm closing this issue.. This seems like a pretty good idea, although having to duplicate nodes might cause additional side effects. I think this should belong in a plugin for now: any other opinions?. You can use the [slide state attribute](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#slide-states) to customise the current class for specific slides, and hide the navigation via.[state] .reveal .controls { display: none; }.. The strikethrough effect can't be part of afragment, as it is shown by default on allelements. You might need to create a separate fragment, withtext-decoration: line-through.. Yep, I don't have much experience with Angular, so asking on StackOverflow is probably the best idea.\n. This is currently not possible, given the way Reveal works.. I think you accidentally opened a PR.\n. This seems like a good idea, although the name of the property might need to be changed. Currently we enable vertical centering if thecenter: trueconfiguration is set or the slide has a class of\"center\". Perhaps looking at the class of\"no-center\"might be a better idea for consistency (or maybe a separatedataattribute).. Try adding thedata-prevent-swipeattribute to the element ([see the readme](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#touch-navigation)).\n. The<code>template tags are not required for all usage of Markdown, only if HTML tags are still used within the Markdown, to prevent browsers from parsing it as HTML before Markdown gets parsed.\n. See https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/1614#issuecomment-224667986.\n. Apart from including</code>marked.js<code>, you need to include</code>markdown.js<code>as well. See the [readme](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#dependencies).\n. I'm not too sure. Try adding a</code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;<code>, and making sure all of your files are in the right place. Check the devtools console to see fit any 404 errors.\n. Working on it offline should be fine, I'm not too sure what's the issue\neither. I'll try to debug when I'm free after next week.\n. This is probably not a serious use case and won't impact us much as not many people are gonna use the slides for over 4 days. Closing for now.. This is expected behaviour, as iframes are treated as separate from the main content. If you would like to do that, you can bind to the</code>keypress<code>event on your page and [send</code>postMessage<code>calls to the Reveal.js iframe](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#postmessage-api).\n. The zoom effect on the second slide works. However, if you want the first slide to have the \"zoom in\" effect when moving to the next slide, you need to add the</code>zoom-out` transition to the first slide as well, which gives the first slide the exit animation of the zoom effect.. Not too sure what's happening, but Reveal shouldn't affect animations from other libraries, so I'm closing this for now. If possible, could you reproduce this issue with a JSBin for easier debugging?. These seem like great ways of integrating SVG and fragments into Reveal. If you're interested, you can even add your plugin into the <a href=\"https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Plugins,-Tools-and-Hardware\">plugins page</a>.. Since @rajgoel mentioned that he can't reproduce the error anymore, I'm closing this issue for now. This seems like another one of those specific browser/renderer bugs, since people were only able to replicate this with older Firefox versions.. As mentioned <a href=\"https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#markdown\">here</a>, you can wrap your Markdown code in script tags to prevent browsers from parsing them before the Markdown output is rendered:</p>\n<p>```html\n<section data-markdown>\n    <script type=\"text/template\">\n        ## Page title</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;div&gt;\n        A div with some text and a [link](http://hakim.se).\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p></section>\n<code>``. Not all events which occur in the speaker notes page will be bubbled up to the presentation. If you do want such behavior, you will have to write your own</code>postMessage<code>event handlers and send events to the parent presentation.. Hi @noraj1337! The current core styling is unlikely to change, as we want to provide a minimal set of styling that works well across all our themes. Feel free to add your own styling or create your own theme.. This seems like an npm issue. AFAIK, npm will automatically add</code>node_modules/.bin<code>to the PATH when running, so adding the full path to the grunt executable shouldn't be necessary. Perhaps you could try removing all dependencies and reinstalling with npm, or updating your npm version.. Yeah, currently Reveal.js does not allow overriding the</code>#<code>query hash, but it is possible for plugins to use query parameters instead, such as</code>?option=1&amp;next=2<code>.. Yep, CRLF issues cause a lot of problems everywhere. Glad you found and fixed it!. There doesn't seem to be much of an issue. Just include your scripts and styles in your presentation, provide the code snippets via</code><pre><code><code>, and the klipse plugin should be able to work fine.. Yep, AFAIK script tags are not supported on slides.com. Unfortunately, I can't really help you out there, as this repo is for the open source Reveal.js library. Maybe you could try to contact their support to ask.. Your code is currently calling the alert as soon as the line is encountered. In order to properly attach a click listener, you need to wrap the</code>alert` call in a function:</p>\n<p><code>js\n(document.getElementById(\"img1\").src = \"img1.jpg\").onclick = function(e) {\n  alert(\"Hello\");\n};</code>. Hmm, I'm not too familiar with C3js, hence I can't really help you with this. If you can provide a reduced test case with an error, I might be able to help you debug, but for now I can't really help with this issue.. Older version of Reveal (&lt;=2.6.2) had the <code>concave</code> transition enabled by default.. If you use <a href=\"https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#markdown\">Markdown to render your presentations</a>, the Markdown parser will automatically add URLs as links.. Nope. you'll have to add <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags yourself, or develop a <a href=\"https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Plugins,-Tools-and-Hardware\">plugin</a> to help you do that easily.. Yep, as mentioned, you can include a script in a section with the <code>data-markdown</code> attribute, which will be used as the content for the slide to be parsed as Markdown.. See the readme for an example: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#markdown.. I don't think there's a really fool proof way of restarting GIFs across various browsers. Perhaps you could do what Twitter and others have done by converting them to videos and playing those instead. This doesn't seem to be something Reveal can do much about, so I'm closing this.. Perhaps you could release this as a <a href=\"https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Plugins,-Tools-and-Hardware\">plugin</a>. On a side note, I have a somewhat similar plugin, which only allows people to highlight specific lines of code when a fragment is shown (https://github.com/demoneaux/reveal-code-focus).. @hakimel what do you think about this?. This has been implemented in #1564.. Hi! I'm not too sure exactly what this issue is about, but reveal doesn't work very well with being embedded into a page. A lot of the code requires it to be the only content available. Closing this for now, feel free to reopen with an example presentation.. You should be able to pass in <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> of your slides to allow Reveal to maintain the aspect ratio. If possible, please provide an example deck so we can see the issue.. Currently there isn't such a way, as Reveal.js presentations are just webpages, and they would be difficult to convert to specific proprietary <code>.ppt</code>/<code>.odp</code> slides. PDF printing is currently the easiest way to export presentations.. Yep, as mentioned, you should look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Plugins,-Tools-and-Hardware\">plugins page</a>. In fact, a quick look through gave me <a href=\"https://github.com/soluml/reveal-css-snippet\">this</a>, which you can probably use to provide a real-time editable CSS snippet.. Yep, agreed with @Sonaryr. Using the reveal config would be a great solution. I've got a couple of thoughts on this, and will fill up #1161 with some ideas. For now, closing this for #1161.. @jerdog: the speaker notes have to be placed within an individual slide. Currently, you are placing them within the outermost wrapper which is used for creating vertical slides, hence they are unable to render properly.</p>\n<p>It should look something like this:\n```html\n<section>\n    <section data-markdown>\n    ### Slide title\n    </section>\n    <section data-markdown>\n    slide\n    </section></p>\n<pre><code>&lt;section data-markdown&gt;\n  slide\n  &lt;aside class=\"notes\"&gt;...&lt;/aside&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n&lt;section data-markdown&gt;\n  slide\n  &lt;aside class=\"notes\"&gt;\n  - Notes to tell me stuff\n  &lt;/aside&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p></section>\n<code>``. There is currently no support for that. If you do end up building a plugin, feel free to add it to the [plugins](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Plugins,-Tools-and-Hardware) page.. Yep, there is a \"page\" transition which is similar to flipping pages of a book.. The styles are set [here](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/43eada79901830702bd40dce857831aef8e76759/css/theme/template/theme.scss#L137-L160), as they are the basic default styling for Reveal. If you don't like the default styling, you can create your own theme, by [modifying the</code>quotes<code>property](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/q/quotes/) and changing the</code>font-style<code>.. Personally I feel that this feature is rather extravagant, and not really necessary, as it adds unnecessary bloat to the Markdown plugin, as the YAML front matter has to be parsed. @hakimel any opinions?. Since it is already available in a plugin, we\u2019re probably not going to shift it into the core Reveal.js code, as that would add additional code and maintenance. Closing this for now.. Currently, there are no plans to allow for multiple instances of Reveal in 1 page, hence Reveal is a \"global static\" variable. There would be a lot of code refactoring to do to allow that, but since the primary use case of Reveal is just for simple presentations, I don't think it is worth it.. Currently, it is not possible to have multiple instances of Reveal on 1 page. I don't think this will be on the roadmap for any future release. If you do want to have multiple presentations in the same page, your best bet currently is to embed multiple presentations is</code><iframe><code>s.. Seems like you didn't mean to create this pull request.. This is not related to Reveal.js. The site you are embedding appears to have set the</code>X-FRAME-OPTIONS<code>header to disallow embedding in iframes.. Any updates?. There isn't such a way for now. Perhaps you could build a plugin and share it: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Plugins,-Tools-and-Hardware. Something similar might be this external HTML plugin: https://github.com/janschoepke/reveal_external. Thanks for the report! A lot of the issues you mentioned can be fixed with CSS by designing your own theme/styles. We'll also look into your other points. Closing this for now :). This is probably better suited for a plugin. Doing it on the server side might be harder, perhaps you could develop a plugin which detects the</code>?lastslide<code>parameter in JavaScript for the client side, and automatically shifts to the last slide.. What's the use case for this? Including Markdown within HTML tags will cause it to be parsed by the browser first, hence the resulting Markdown might not be suitable for rendering.. I believe that escaping the</code>` closing tag is enough, using something like this should work:\n```html\n\n</p>\n<h1>Heading</h1>\n<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;&lt;\\/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>\n```. This is not really a Reveal.js issue, and I don't have experience with Bootstrap. Perhaps asking on StackOverflow with more info would be better. IMO, the Bootstrap code you are using for the columns might be responsive, so the grid changes from columns to rows on smaller viewports.. There's no built in method, but you can add an event listener for slide changes to activate the next fragment:\njs\nReveal.addEventListener( 'slidechanged', function( event ) {\n    Reveal.nextFragment();\n} );. The reveal.js styles are for the whole document and are bound to modify some of CodeMirror's styling. Unfortunately, I don't have time to look into it, but feel free to send a PR or more information about which styles are conflicting so we can look into modifying that.. Reveal is always exported as a global, hence plugins should be able to rely on it existing.. This seems to be the wrong place for this issue. Try opening an issue here: https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal. The speaker notes s shortcut is added to the help screen. Perhaps you didn't include notes.js as one of your dependencies?. The links seem to be broken, so I'm closing this for now. Feel free to reopen with another demo.. Not too sure what's causing this, will try to debug soon.. Closing as highlight has been updated to a more recent version and we can't duplicate this anymore.. There doesn't seem to be a reason why search engines don't index Reveal slides. In fact, the top result for Reveal on Google is http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/, which are the demo slides. Perhaps you should modify your meta tags and add some such as description, author and keywords. (I'm not too good at SEO, so you should probably consult some other resources for more help).. You'll need to enable the history option to let the fragment change.. Closed by #1836.. Merging as this seems to be the right behaviour to generate valid URLs for our generated CSS.. There isn't such an equivalent for now. Reveal's slides follows a structured approach as compared to Prezi's free flowing and flexible slides. If you're interested in something similar you can look at https://github.com/impress/impress.js.. For now CSS is a good way to do it.. There's a note about head.js being required in https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#dependencies.. There doesn't seem to be a reason why the filename should affect the rendering. This is probably a one off config error. Feel free to reopen if you encounter anything similar.. This can probably be maintained as an external plugin as we want to keep the reveal.js core plugins small. Feel free to make a plugin and share it!. Using a recent version of Node is recommended as Node 0.10 and 0.12 are already past their end of life. We are also in the process of upgrading our grunt dependencies (#1884), which will require Node v4+ for one of the libraries. Hence I'll be closing this issue.. See https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/1857#issuecomment-298299190.. The head.js library must be defined globally.. Hi @manoelcampos! This is a perfect fit for a plugin, so as to allow the Reveal.js core library to remain lean. Feel free to add it here if you do make it: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Plugins,-Tools-and-Hardware. This is a similar request to #1519? However, we do not have such a mechanism here. Feel free to create a plugin. See also https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/1519#issuecomment-298313406.. Hi @aloupfor! The use of null in data-background-hash allows all the options to be included when comparing between hashes. Although unlikely, there might be cases where concatenation without the null would lead to the same property even when using different options. The use of null will allow us to ensure that this is easily differentiated and unlikely to happen.. You're leaving a line of whitespace between the <pre> and <code> tags. The default Reveal styles only the code tag, hence there appears to be this issue for you. While I'm not too sure what the solution should be, I don't believe modifying the display is the right way to go as it can lead to unexpected behaviour. For now, a quick fix for you is to adjust the whitespace between pre and code.. The class has-dark-background is used internally by Reveal, and will be removed if the slide does not have a dark background. If you use a different class name it should probably work.. This seems to work fine for me: see https://codepen.io/anon/pen/GEZmJX which is a copy pasted version of your code. Closing for now.. This is posible, but you'll probably have to do it yourself. For example, listen to the ready event, then check the conditions (mobile phones, etc.), then modify the DOM, and call Reveal.layout().. Closed by #1917.. Yep, you can use CSS to style text to left align it. For individual slides, you can even use inline styles, like <section style=\"text-align: left;\"> to do so.. @hakimel should we merge this?. This is because the browser will treat the <> brackets as a HTML tags. To solve this, you'll have to either use data-markdown with a script or textarea with type=\"text/template\" or encode the characters using &lt; and &gt;.. Reveal.js presentations are made by editing HTML, using your text editor. Most of the features you seen to be more visual, so you might want to look at a visual editor, such as https://slides.com, which is built on Reveal.js.. I'm not too sure what you're referring to, but if you do want to do extensive styling of certain slides, I would recommend adding a class/ID to the slide/table and styling it in CSS instead.. Yep, as mentioned by @jdittrich, you can create presentations only by editing HTML, using your text editor. Alternatively, if you want a more visual approach, you can use https://slides.com.. As of now there is no such way, you'll probably have to reload the page without calling shuffle to get back to the original order.. I think you can try to fix this by calling Reveal.layout() after plotting your charts/diagrams.. Personally, I'm not too familiar with Video.js and MediaElement. You might want to prevent autoplay on such libraries, then listen to Reveal's onslidechange event, and play/stop the video based on that.. @hakimel what do you think?. This seems too specific for the Reveal.js core library, which we are trying to keep lean. As mentioned, perhaps you could try using an external tempting library or plugin.. This seems to specific for Reveal's core, which we are trying to keep lean. Perhaps you should try to look at finding or creating a plugin for something like that, or using some sort of template engine.. @hakimel what do you think about this? Seems like a good idea to me, although perhaps something like '^\\s*notes?:' might be better. This will have to be rebased though.. @hakimel what do you think?. Duplicate of #228.. Slides.com is not part of the open source Reveal.js project, so if you want them to reconsider their decision, you should probably vote or ask them there instead of on Reveal's GitHub.. Closing since this isn't an issue as notes are meant to be run from a server for postMessage to work properly.. This request is too specific for most users, and seems like something that can be addressed by customizing your own Reveal.initialize call by checking the query string first.. Sorry, I misread the PR. This seems feasible.. Actually looking at it again, this seems to generate edge cases where the user might expect both configs in the URL and in the options to work, which is not intuitive. Since there is already an option to configure this, I don't think this is necessary.. You could change to using the `` syntax for writing your code, as the markdown parser shouldn't modify stuff within the code block.. Hi, you'll need to use a querystring for the url: http://slhck.info/ffmpeg-encoding-course/?print-pdf should be able to work. Note that including the print CSS using?print-pdfwill mess up the formatting on screen, but when printed it should work just fine.. This is probably something that should be decided by the creators of presentations themselves. Opening all links in a new tab is quite invasive and should probably not be a default option. Creators of presentations can addtarget=\"_blank\"themselves, or create a plugin that does that for all links.. Hi, could you create a reproduction case for us to look at?. Hi, sadly I don't have python on my computer due to administrative restrictions. Is it possible for you to try switching to the latest Reveal version (3.6.0), and upload a copy of the live slides online for us to look at?. Closing this for now then, since it's a bug in a rather old version of Reveal.. I think this would be a great idea: markdown-it allows more flexibility and has plugins as well. However I don't think any of the contributors have time to implement such a major change - which might also have significant impact to users' current presentations. @hakimel any opinions on this?. Seems like you have included the socket.io.js in your dependencies when you copy pasted the initial template from a Reveal demo or docs. If you are not using the multiplexing feature, feel free to remove that from your dependencies.. Yup, when sanitizing all HTML like syntax will be replaced, hence the custom markdown syntax will not be supported.. This seems too specific to be included in the Reveal.js core repository. Do feel free to upload your Dockerfile and create a separate repo if there are features you want to share with others.. Yep, Reveal.js should be able to match and load JS files with query strings. Created #2077 to fix that.. Since changing themes within the same presentation isn't common, we don't have any specialized tools for you to do so. You can try usingReveal.addEventListener('slidechanged'), then checkevent.currentSlide.getAttribute('theme')instead.. Looking at http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/configuration.html#using-a-configuration-file, it seems like you should use a full URL when naming yourconfig, eg.config: 'TeX-AMS_HTML-full,https://mysite.com/local/local.js', with no space between the 2 config files. Additionally, instead of usingMathJax.Ajax.loadComplete(\"[MathJax]/config/local/local.js\");, you might have to put the full URL of the config file instead of using[MathJax].. Initializing something twice is a bad practice, and may cause unexpected side effects, especially since Reveal does so much DOM manipulation. In your case, deleting the whole.revealslide is a bad idea as Reveal does not re-attach to the new.revealclass. What you should do is delete the slides and re-add them later and callReveal.sync().. Hey sorry for the late reply, but any idea where you read that it was required to install gulp? AFAIK we don't use gulp, and only use Grunt. If you were referring to Grunt (I get that it can be confusing sometimes), would appreciate a note on where we said it's required. Thanks!. Ah, missed that file because it wasn't in the main readme :'). Will upload a docs patch soon. Thanks very much!. Closing for now, should be fixed in Reveal 3.6.0.. It's currently not possible to re-parse a slide which has already been parsed, but you can try to runRevealMarkdown.convertSlides()to convert a newly inserted slide withdata-markdownenabled.. If you do create a plugin that uses WebSockets or some other method to inject HTML into the DOM, you can callReveal.sync()to cause Reveal to parse the DOM again to render new slides properly. Things like the current slide position should be conserved.. Thedata-background-iframeis used in the background of the current slide, hence the controls won't be accessible. The best case for your scenario is to put the video in the foreground and customise the CSS or play with the [presentation size](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#presentation-size).. Hi! Currently the zoom transition is done mostly using CSS transitions, so you might want to look at the code for transitions: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/65bdccd5807b6dfecad6eb3ea38872436d291e81/css/reveal.scss#L682-L726 and the zoom transition: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/65bdccd5807b6dfecad6eb3ea38872436d291e81/css/reveal.scss#L797-L817 to modify the code to suit your slides.. We've since updated our dependencies which minimizes the deprecation warnings.. Closed as this has been fixed in #1978 and is available in v3.6.0.. I believe you're using the wrong attribute: see https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#slide-attributes. Try using .slide: data-background-iframe=\"...\" .. Sadly, this is unable to work as we don't apply states during PDF exporting as all slides will be shown. In this case, during printing, applying styles to.slide-backgroundwon't work as expected. I'm not too sure if there is any easy way to work around this.. This seems to work, tested in Chrome and Firefox latest. Closing this issue for now.. Seems like an error with Node and npm at that time. Using the latest version of npm for Node 8 should fix that. See https://github.com/sass/node-sass/issues/1991 for more info.. Hi, the videos in the slide background are also lazy loaded, so based on your configuredviewDistance, slides which are within the configured slides away will have their background videos begin to load. If you don't want to buffer so much video at once, you can try reducing theviewDistancealthough that might increase load time of slides. After a video is shown and the slides are changed, the video is then removed. In this case the RAM usage might just be due to the browser engine, and memory usage should decrease in time.. Currently this is possible in Reveal by [overriding the keyboard bindings](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#keyboard-bindings).. This has since been fixed. However, I don't think it's a good idea to just use the reveal demo site as a source of reveal's code as there could be differences between different versions of reveal. Perhaps a better way of building would be to download the source code, as relying on third-party sites has always been a bad practice.. Make sure you are using the right reveal package on npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/reveal.js.. I can't seem to reproduce this,Reveal.getStateandReveal.setState` seem to both exist.. Hi @jreybert! We update the entire version of highlight.js once in a while, so backports like these are not required. Thanks anyway!. This seems to work pretty well for me. Perhaps you could make sure you follow the instructions here when printing: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#pdf-export. Feel free to provide more info if this still doesn't work for you.. I don't believe this is a reveal issue. Perhaps you should look at the generated HTML file to see if there was a space added unintentionally by the program.. Could you provide a reproduction page?. Hi, I've taken a look at your page. The two Schrodinger's are different, you can compare them by looking at \njs\n'Schro\u0308dinger'.length // 12\n'Schr\u00f6dinger'.length // 11\nThis is because the o\u0308 in the first string is made up of U+006F Latin Small Letter O and U+0308 Combining Diaeresis.\nThe \u00f6 in the second string is the U+00F6 Latin Small Letter O with Diaeresis.\nSince the characters are different, it probably has to do with the font not supporting the combining mark properly resulting in a weird alignment issue.. Currently the section itself is positioned absolutely. Since the only element in it is also absolutely positioned, it will not be in the typical layout flow, causing the section to have a height of 0 as there are now elements positioned statically within it.\nBy adding a new element which takes up 100vh, this issue can be solved:\nhtml\n<section data-background-image=\"img/kasiarz_logowanie.png\" data-background-size=\"85%\">\n<div style=\"position: relative; min-height: 100vh\" >\n<p style=\"position:absolute;bottom:10px\">Siema</p>\n</div>\n</section>. Yep, currently the logic of your code such that the same fragment is applied twice will not work as expected. You can, as mentioned, use replications, or create some custom fragment that will better suit your needs.. This is more complex, and can probably be done with your own custom fragment styles. By placing it display: none by default, you can then do something like display: block when the fragment is active, but with a transition (with delay) on some transform such as brightness or scale to achieve such an effect. Currently there isn't such a way to do that, you'll have to individually judge and split your content into different slides manually.. head.js is not strictly required for Reveal to function, only if you are using the dependencies configuration to load your scripts. Otherwise, you can just load dependencies like plugins as normal <script>s, although you must call Reveal.initialize() first.. Yes, previewLinks can be overridden on a link-by-link basis by adding data-preview-link or data-preview-link=\"false\" even if previewLinks is true or false in the configuration. This seems like a good idea to add a note in the docs, and I'll do that in a whille.. The footer element isn't really used in most presentations, hence we decided not to maintain styles for that which could differ a lot between different users. It is simple enough to add a couple lines to your own stylesheet to modify your own footer styles.. This seems to be working fine, this could possibly be something else you added to your slides that might be causing errors.. We've already updated highlight to a more recent version, and we will continue to do so before new releases of Reveal.. You can always avoid loading the dependencies until after page loads, and load them further on using head.js([ /* socket.io, multiplex*/ ]). Note that you will have to add the multiplex configuration before loading those scripts either through initialize or configure.. Fragments are meant to be inherently customizable, so you can just define your own fragment that does nothing, while overriding the default fragment behaviour:\ncss\n.reveal .slides section .fragment.empty {\n    opacity: 1;\n    visibility: inherit;\n    transition-duration: 0s !important;\n}\nhtml\n<span class=\"fragment empty\">\n    Will be shown as usual, and will have `.visible` applied to it when activated\n</span>. @hakimel what do you think about adding another fragment?. IMO this is a little too specific for Reveal. @hakimel what do you think?. Hi, I don't seem to see any issue with the background. Feel free to ping back with more details.. Seems like a good fix to close #1230 and #1346.. When used with the Markdown plugin, the Markdown plugin appears to parse the _ beforehand. One solution would be to wrap the whole expression in <code> to prevent Marked from parsing the code within, or avoiding writing slides using math with Markdown.. Hi what's the rationale for this? AFAIK, package-lock.json should be included in the repository as recommended by npm.. I don't think this is necessary, as we can direct users on tests ourselves through GitHub Reviews. An additional bot commenting could also be confusing for users.. As mentioned in https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#configuration, you can run:\njs\nReveal.initialize({\n    // ...\n    // Enable slide navigation via mouse wheel\n    mouseWheel: true\n});. I've tested your code in a blank Reveal presentation, it seems to work for me. Perhaps you could create a repro for us to see. Otherwise closing for now.. As mentioned at https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#presentation-size, you might want to vary the size of the margin surrounding the content to provide more breathing room around your slides.. Reveal is simply a framework for presentation and other HTML and JavaScript code should be able to work if modified to work Reveal if necessary.. We only include basic styles with Reveal to suit the themes, and more in-depth and complex styling such as numbered lists with subtopics might be too specific for all users, hence we allow them to customise such styles themselves.. @hakimel any opinions on this?. Currently you can set the viewDistance to 0 to cause the background iframes to load only when they reach the appropriate slide.. This seems like a bug, not sure if the effect was accidentally removed in one of the refactors.. It is true that using the same numbering system is less confusing, however the 0-indexed URL system has been in use since the very first version of Reveal and hence it is unlikely that we will switch to a different system.. I like the idea of a navigation event that allows slide changes to be cancelled, although maybe it should use Reveal.addEventListener like the rest of our API instead of using the DOM event system. However the option to prevent horizontal / vertical navigation doesn't seem very useful to me, as part of the core reveal API, seeing that reveal is meant to be a general presentation framework.. You'll have to modify the code of your dynamic page to work with Reveal. Personal support questions shouldn't really be asked here, as contributors to Reveal don't have the time to answer every single question relating to your own code. Please try to use the issue tracker for reporting bugs or feature requests.. If you're trying to deploy your site, you can try something like GitHub Pages or Now.. This is due to our usage of Grunt as a task manager, and grunt-contrib-connect. Grunt hasn't been updated in 2 years, and some of its dependencies are probably outdated. I've created an issue here: https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/issues/1618. Also for grunt-contrib-connect see https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-connect/issues/235. But regardless, both these warnings should not affect users directly.. The way the current code works, you will have to disable mousewheel scrolling inside slides where you want to scroll. You can probably do something like:\njs\nReveal.addEventListener('slidechanged', function(event) {\n if (event.currentSlide.className == 'no-scroll') { // or modify to suit your needs\n    Reveal.configure({ 'mouseWheel': false });\n  } else {\n    Reveal.configure({ 'mouseWheel': true });\n  }\n});. Thanks for the issue, I've added a note to the docs!. Yep, highlight.js takes care of the syntax highlighting. One thing you might not have done is indicate the language in your code block, you should add ``kotlin to your Markdown code blocks to indicate the language.. You'll have to implement your own shuffling algorithm to shuffle the vertical slides only, then call something likeReveal.sync().. Not too sure as reveal wasn't meant to be embedded like that, but you can try runningReveal.sync()to sync the DOM to the slides.. The Reveal code wasn't written for ES6, so there are some complexities you might have to deal with. The markdown plugin depends onRevealandmarked(and possiblyhighlight`) being defined as globals, so you might have to try something like this if you are using ES6 imports:\njs\nimport Reveal from 'reveal.js'\nimport Marked from 'reveal.js/plugin/markdown/marked.js'\nwindow.Reveal = Reveal;\nwindow.marked = Marked;\nimport Markdown  from 'reveal.js/plugin/markdown/markdown.js'\nMarkdown.initialize();. Hi, this is actually an issue in the tests only. Windows uses different line endings (\\r\\n) then other Unixes (\\n) so the regex that must be used should be something like \\r?\\n.. Hi, Reveal currently isn't built to allow initializing and then removing the whole reveal div as we do a lot of DOM manipulation which requires the div to exist. If you're trying to embed reveal in a SPA you might have better luck putting it in an iframe.. This is related to changes made in #1909. Seems like we shifted from an elements based approach to a point based approach as the default element boundaries might not always be as expected. For now you can modify the zoom factor through zoomLevel in the configuration.. This seems more like a personal support question better suited to StackOverflow, as Holoviews is an external library which we can't help you with.. Seems like you saw #1608, but since that hasn't been merged that syntax is not available in Reveal yet. You have to specify the CSS yourself:\n```css\n/ Slide-specific vertical centering override /\n.reveal .slides section[data-vertical-align-top]{\n    top: 0 !important;\n}\n```. This doesn't seem to be related to reveal, instead it seems to be some external plugin since reveal doesn't allow loading external HTML files. Please open an issue in the correct repo or ask personal support questions on StackOverflow instead.. ~~Backwards mousewheel scroll will navigate to the previously navigated slide. Hence if you've moved from 1,2 to 2,1, navigating to the previous slide will cause it to move back to 1,2 instead of 1,3.~~\nMy mistake, I misunderstood what the code meant. I've since confirmed that backwards mousewheel scrolling should go to the previous slide, in this case from 2,1 to 1,3. If you're able to provide a reproduction I can look into this.. Try setting style=\"text-align: left\" for the section.. Try adjusting the width and margin to suit your own needs: \ncss\n.reveal blockquote {\n  width: 70%;\n  margin: 20px 0;\n}\nAlso, the issue tracker is mostly meant for feature requests and bug reports. Try asking personal support questions on StackOverflow instead.. Hi @DaniPani! We currently support all ES5 browsers, so adding ES6 would cause older versions of some browsers to fail, for example PhantomJS. Closing this for now.. Currently the only solution is to remove the whitespace between the pre and code tags. This is due to the semantics of the pre element which displays all whitespace between pre tags as is.. Seems like your code is being treated as HTML by the Markdown parser. Try wrapping your code in triple backticks:\n&lt;!-- code -->\n&lt;foo ... />\n. HI @mccarthyryanc! This is due to Gitlab snippets using the same pre code blocks which are highlighted by the highlight.js plugin. There doesn't seem to be a good solution for this, except perhaps adding the no-highlight class to the pre code yourself. GitHub Gists don't suffer from the same problem as they don't use pre code to display code, instead choosing to utilise a table to display code.. This option seems fine. Any reason why you commented it out?\n. You should do something like:\njs\nvar html = '';\nhtml += '\u2026';\nstylesheet.innerHTML = HTML;\n. IMO you shouldn\u2019t create an alert as it would disrupt viewers. Logging it to the console seems fine to me.\n. You could use head.js, since it is included in Reveal.js for loading of assets.\n. Typo here: \u201cass\u201d should be \u201cas\u201d.\n. That's for the developer only, it would be a bad user experience to create an alert for something the user does not know.\n. Yeah, you should place it in an option which is disabled by default and add docs for it.\n. Can we make this >=4.0.0?\n. ",

If I'm not mistaken, there are already classes: past, present, future. Not a problem. Just to clarify though - for single page apps (e.g. using angular) the param ends up in the search query instead of the hash query which is less natural for adding the param (i.e. via $.param() instead of splicing the url) and it's also little visually inconsistent. Technically, there are two query strings in a url, although the hash one is never sent server side. Anyway and either way, this is an AWESOME PROJECT and I'm sure you have larger items to attend to than this one.

Hi why not update the socket.io in the package.json? I can see that it's still using 0.9.16\n. Uhhhhh-DER. It's just the example that requests online resources.\n. same bug with firefox 45. That's what I thought, too. I dug in a bit deeper, and it seems like the proxy is not the issue - it just often is an issue in my environment, so I prematurely came to that conclusion.\nWhat's _actually _happening is because the page I'm linking to is using SSL (HTTPS), it's not displaying in an iframe. Is there a good workaround for this?\n. I found the problem, and it's not with the reveal.js code. \nThe issue is with Windows use of CR and LF (instead of MacOS and Linux/Unix LF only) to end a line in a text file. \nIf I commit my reveal.js slides and push to gitHub, the CR-LF's (windows) are translated into LF's only. BUT, when I serve the local repo content this (obviously) these CR's have not been removed. \nTherefore, by using:\ndata-separator=\"^\\n>>>>>\\n\"\n                         data-separator-vertical=\"^\\nvvvvv\\n\"\nThe tags will be interpreted correct from the content I serve from my GitHub account, but not be interpreted correctly for content I serve from my local windows machine.  \nTo fix this problem, I needed to add CR's to the tag definition (to whatever char string you prefer):\ndata-separator=\"^\\r\\n>>>>>\\r\\n\"\n                         data-separator-vertical=\"^\\r\\nvvvvv\\r\\n\"\n... complete section is as follows:\n<section data-markdown=\"slides_md/git_intro.md\"\n                         data-separator=\"^\\r\\n>>>>>\\r\\n\"\n                         data-separator-vertical=\"^\\r\\nvvvvv\\r\\n\"\n                         data-separator-notes=\"^Note:\"\n                         data-charset=\"iso-8859-15\">\n                </section>\n.

It just moved the whole presentation from the middle of the screen to the top with like 20px or so of padding between the top of the section and the top of the page.  On top of that the actual section size didn't seem to change at all....\n. I could never get this to work no matter what file I put the above code in.\n. I tried putting the additional css file in and the css DID make changes however it wasn't 100% correct.  Do you think this is because in our file we have overview disabled and thus zooming is conflicting with the CSS?\nIt seems to me that if you disable overview and use the zooming it messes up a TON of functionality.  Any suggestions?\n. dandv,\nWe are trying to accomplish something very similar as we want to create a \"footer\" and use it as a custom navigation bar at the bottom.  However, our presentation allows two finger zooming as we have overview disabled.  Even though you can zoom, we want the footer to remain in the same spot bottom center and unphased by the zooming.  Does your presentation zoom?  Might you be willing to share how you implemented your footer?  \nThanks\nChris\n. We have been working on this since posted and we have taken it about as far as it can go.  We were able to create a custom nav bar and get it to dynamically stay center even when zooming on the document...to a point.  The point where it breaks is if the current slide and nav bar are trying to occupy the same space at the bottom at the same time.  For some reason, even though we have z-index set for the nav bar to be above the slides, the slide will still dynamically bump the nav bar off screen if you zoom.  Thoughts?\n. Are there any plans to resolve this issue?  This is a pretty big issue as far as functionality is concerned...\n. If someone is zooming in to view specific content in a page and then they button or icon happens to be there to click for an image....why would it be reasonable they would zoom back out before clicking the icon and viewing the pieces in light box?\n. The zooming is mobile safari.  We are viewing this on an iPad.  \nIf someone zooms in and clicks an icon to open the lightbox the lightbox is also zoomed what seems an equal amount.  However, if someone zooms out after they have popped the lightbox, it doesn't resize the content within the lightbox....it only changes how big the lightbox appears....\n. I think the true issue here is the fact that reveal's zooming or level of zoom effects everything contained within a slide.  Because of this no matter what the lightbox does reveal will zoom its content.  Am I wrong about that?\n. So basically we are out of luck unless we can add something to the lightbox code to make sure zoom doesnt effect the sizing?\n. And that doesn't seem like that would be true considering that it zooms the content within the container of the lightbox itself and not the actual container.  You would think that native zooming would only zoom the container and not the physical content of the lightbox.  Right?  Or am I wrong?\n. I also noticed certain parts of our presentation not re-rendering after a pinch zoom.  Is this the same issue?\n. Ah thank you!  I searched the forums but somehow missed that...\n. ",

Which means that the secondary monitor goes to \u00bblinen mode\u00ab and is unusable for showing the speaker notes.\nSafari instead is behaving like I would expect from the JavaScript fullscreen mode. One monitor is showing the the current HTML element fullscreen and the other monitor isn\u2019t changing. I\u2019m as happy about that as I am surprised. Cause I thought \u00bbWebkit\u00ab is \u00bbWebkit\u00ab and that there wouldn\u2019t be that difference between Chrome and Safari.\nI didn\u2019t test Firefox in the matter of fullscreen dual monitor support cause I\u2019m preferring Webkits font rendering.\n.

Yep, the current slides within the \u00bbspeaker notes\u00ab window behave exactly the same like in the \u00bbmain\u00ab window. I thought about that before my implementation and this is the behavior I wish to have and Apples Keynote is behaving the same way.\nThe main reason I would expect the notes system behave like that is the following:\nImagine you holding a presentation where you can\u2019t see the \u00bbmain\u00ab window (which is the most common use case I guess). In that case I absolutely want to have the two views in sync, to know exactly what the audience is seeing to know what I have to talk about ; ]\nAnother reason is that I want to have a visual feedback when hitting the \u00bbnext\u00ab arrow on my keyboard.\n. Cool. I\u2019m going to implement that one on the new speakernotes plugin from https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/pull/190\n. You\u2019re right. Keeping them in sync might increase the comfort using reveal.js because you don\u2019t have to check which window has the focus. \nKeep up the good work.\n. Maybe it\u2019s the protocol?

I didn't really come up with anything better yet, so please, if you have improvement suggestions, lay them on me :)\nHere's another explanation, though:\n<div class=\"offscreen fragment css-fragment\" data-add-class=\"zoom\" data-target=\"#makeBigger\"></div>\nThe offscreen class moves the div offscreen so there is no visual impact from the fragment that doesn't really do anything (visually). The css-fragment class is a marker, just like fragment. The data-add-class attributes specifies which CSS classes should be added to the target element, and finally data-target must contain a selector for the target element.\n. If you'd be willing to share your idea I'd be happy to give its implementation a try :)\n. While it is a simpler implementation, this solution seems to be much less flexible. E.g. it is not possible to reproduce my example, nor would it be possible to change a given fragment over and over (i.e. fade in, then fade out again), am I right?...\n. Hmm, I liked the idea of hidden DOM elements because that way you can define the order of effects. In your solution, the order of the effects is dictated by the order in which the elements appear. IMHO, that is too much of a limitation.\n. Well I can only speak for myself, but I have done this several times in my presentations :smile:. Also, given the fact that it is possible to re-order effects in both Apple Keynote and Microsoft Powerpoint, I'd say that somebody out there thinks that there is a use-case for this :D But I understand your desire to keep things simple, and I imagine that your implementation is at least partially based on the fact that it can be easily added to rvl.io (correct me if I'm wrong). However, I think that reveal.js as a presentation framework should not limit itself by trying to be as simple as possible while sacrificing flexibility, whereas imo that would be fine as a design goal for a website such as rvl.io.\n.

What's the motive for this restriction?\n. Ping. Any thoughts on this?\n. Any chance that this requirement can now be loosened? Would still love to use stretch, but my images are rarely a child of <section>.. btw: Did you know pandoc can convert markdown to reveal.js? Of course, markdown is simpler than an actual templating language.\n. @jm3 You can add attributes to headings which then manifest in the sections. My fairly full featured test deck doesn't have much HTML in its markdown.\n. I tend to use Creative Commons images, and WikiCommons and Flickr have \"embed\" widgets, so I just click that and paste the HTML code into my slides. I could convert them to markdown (using pandoc in fact) but there's little incentive to do so since reveal.js doesn't work with pandoc's --self-contained capability. (This encodes resources and places them directly in the HTML file.) I used to use this to put slides on a thumb drive that worked even without a network, which was great. However, pandoc's --self-contained can't presently fetch https resources (such as revealjs's Google fonts) and I don't think it would know that reveal's background image attributes are images either (and hence would not fetch, encode, and include them.)\n\nalso, you linked to the pandoc article because reveal.js uses pandoc to\nparse markdown?\n\n(Does it? I don't know; I doubt it.)\n. I love the full page background images, but for me they only work on PNGs and not JPEGs? (Google Chrome 27.0.1453.110-r202711) Can anyone replicate?\n.

If the presentation markup hits the browser with normal src attributes it's too late, the browser will already have started loading them. Otherwise they could have been replaced entirely via JS..

Hence,  autopause is not working on Chrome and  \"busted\" on FF. :-)\n. Bug still present in FF29. Any news?\n. Thanks!

My version prior to 3.0.0 does it too.\n. Even if that's a short term action for reveal, shouldn't a bug report be filed with Chromium?\n. The roll-in was really nice for images, hopefully it'll reappear some day.\n. Also, it doesn't work in Firefox 37.0.1+build1-0ubuntu0.14.04.1\n. Thanks @hakimel, please don't use 'https://slides.com/' as your example then.\n. If @hakimel isn't using https://slides.com/ anymore I think we can close this issue even though it's probably worth noting in the documentation. However, even though I opened it I don't see the close button.. Duh! Sorry!. Wondering if this is still an issue?. Oh, okay, thanks.\n. They are still useful for changing backgrounds (e.g., dark text on dark background/image) but I find you can still get away with something minimal.\n. This is what I use for backgrounds:\n\n*.reveal section[data-background] *,\n*.reveal section[data-background-iframe] * {\n    text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px rgba(190,190,190,1.0);\n}\n. I'll add that on Chromebooks, when I go to ctrl+click to open a link in a tab it zooms at the same time. Very confusing.. Here is an example, as you browse the slides, the URL fragment ID doesn't change. What could this be?\nhttp://reagle.org/joseph/2017/cda/talks/080-social-know-how.html. Okay, thanks, I will investigate. (BTW: Sorry, I just saw this was discussed on the pandoc-list but I didn't get those email, but see them in the archive.). Can you confirm it is working on unnested versions? Any date-transition beside none, slide, and fade are currently not working for me.. In issue #2237 I documented that my horizontal slide/sections don't work, as well, because pandoc wraps all top level sections -- except the title-slide -- in a superfluous \\<section> element.  So that unnecessary behavior triggers #1947 for all my slides.\nThe issue here, then, is why does @data-transition not work on //section/section as originally asked?. Thank you, I pulled dev and can confirm concave and convex work on google-chrome 70.0.3538.77. \ud83d\udc4dLooking forward to whatever you come up with for zoom! . This will be great when merged, thanks!. Note, the following markdown (with HTML) does work.\nhttps://reagle.org/joseph/talks/2014/exemplar.html#/fragment-styles-old\n```\nFragment styles old\ncurrent-visible\nhighlight-red\nhighlight-green\nhighlight-blue\nfade-out\ngrow\nshrink \n```\n. To clarify, the transition effects work when they are set globally, whether horizontal or vertical. For example, this global convex setting works:\nhttps://reagle.org/joseph/talks/2014/exemplar.html?transition=convex\nThe problem is with per-slide transitions. @hakimel's demo slides don't have per slide transitions (except on the background), so it's difficult to isolate.\nNext step, I will download the demo slides and see if they work there.. When I add data-transition attributes to slides in the official demo set, they work on horizontal but not on vertical/nested. So #1947 is the most important bug. (My slides are generated via pandoc so there might be something there causing a problem too but that is hard to say until #1947  is addressed.). I've determined my horizontal slides are not working because pandoc wraps all top level sections -- except the title-slide -- in a superfluous <section> element. This means all my slides suffer from issue #1947. I'll close this issue #2237, ask about this pandoc behavior on their list, and clarify #1947.\n```\n\n\n\n  <section id=\"title-slide\">\n    <h1 class=\"title\">Habits</h1>\n    <p class=\"author\">John Doe</p>\n    <p class=\"date\">March 22, 2005</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <section id=\"in-the-morning\" class=\"title-slide slide level1\"><h1>In the morning</h1></section>\n    <section id=\"getting-up\" class=\"slide level2\">\n\n```.

    "zachcp": "Hi Hakimel,\nA master slide in Powerpoint/Keynote lets users have some preset options about page layout. A Master slide could specify that the slide will be just a Title, or perhaps a Title with Two Images, or a Title with an image and a bulleted list. In Reveal.js I imagine that such a Master slide could be implemented in CSS.\nA common slide that I use which is currently difficult/impossible to make with Reveal.js is to have a Title, an Image , and a paragraph/ bulleted list explaining the image. I could imagine putting an attribute in the section like <section class=\"image-plus-bullets\"> so that Reveal.js knows to use a special CSS class to  place the title at the top, the image on the left, and the text block on the right. Currently everything is centered and layed out from top to bottom so horizontal separation of Images and content is not possible.\nI just checked to see if RVL.IO allowed you to move images around once they are on the page but this is not possible without editing the html/css. Therefore I think a useful addition to Reveal.JS would be a few common preset CSS classes that define slides where images/content are positioned on preset portions of the page. I think this would be a useful addition to Reveal.js. and would allow it to be substituted for a larget set of presentations, however it would require a consistent html/css scaffold system for defining location/layout on a slide.  So while I think it would be useful I can see that it might be a bit of work to implement/maintain. The beauty of Reveal as it is is that is is quite simple to get up-and-running. The extra features would be beneficial in my book but may add extra layers of complexity\nOnce again, thank you for your great work.\nbest,\nzach cp\n. ",

    "karimsa": "Hey @programmieraffe !\nI have tried this out, and it seem to work for me. But anyways, the reason this may not work for you is because the links actually look like this:\nhtml\n<a href=\"#my-link\" class=\"roll\">\n    <span data-title=\"text-on-roll\">Test!</span>\n</a>\nHere, your text within the <span> tags should be the same as the one in the data-title attribute. When you put up a link like this:\nhtml\n<a href=\"#test\">Test</a>\nIt gets rewritten to:\nhtml\n<a href=\"#test\" class=\"roll\">\n    <span data-title=\"Test\">Test</span>\n</a>\nThis means when you put the quotation marks there, it will mess up the markup like so:\nhtml\n<a href=\"#test\" class=\"roll\">\n    <span data-title=\"\" test\"\"=\"\">\"Test\"</span>\n</a>\nSo now the extra set(s) of quotation marks in the tag make the browser try parsing everything as different attributes, which is wrong. Your best bet to solve this issue would be to either take out the quotation marks, or to have as html entities (&quot;). To achieve that, write the markup yourself:\nhtml\n<a href=\"#test\" class=\"roll\">\n    <span data-title=\"&quot;Test&quot;\">\"Test\"</span>\n</a>\n. I had some concern about this too. How about one of the below two:\n- Having an option within the configuration (options/settings; whatever you'd like to call it) so that you can enable this?\n- Having a key down or button to reset the show?\nBecause in some cases you might not want to have it reset. Comment with the thoughts and I can set up a pull request with the code; since Hakim has 26 other issues as 4 pull requests to worry about. XP\n. This seems to be a functional part of reveal.js:\njavascript\n    /**\n     * Stores the vertical index of a stack so that the same \n     * vertical slide can be selected when navigating to and \n     * from the stack.\n     * \n     * @param {HTMLElement} stack The vertical stack element\n     * @param {int} v Index to memorize\n     */\n    function setPreviousVerticalIndex( stack, v ) {\n        if( stack ) {\n            stack.setAttribute( 'data-previous-indexv', v || 0 );\n        }\n    }\nRegardless, it is a convenient option to have so see pull request: #287 (above)\n(Note: In the request, the option IS enabled by default, but it is still a configuration option so it can be turned off)\n. Firstly, I think you have your rights and lefts mixed up, presentations go from left to right (not right to left), so the next slide show be on your right (not left). ;P\nTo answers this, it's a part of the API, you can run Reveal.next(); from JavaScript. It will automatically determine whether your next slide is downwards (vertical stacks) or to the right. This way you can either do something like:\nhtml\n<!-- Ugly inline events -->\n<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Reveal.next();\">Click me!</a>\n<!-- Or more of bookmarklet style -->\n<a href=\"javascript:void(function(){ Reveal.next(); }());\" title=\"Bookmarklet Style\">Click me!</a>\nOr bind with JavaScript:\njavascript\n// Grab all tags with class '.next'\nvar anchors = document.getElementsByClassName('.next');\nfor ( var i in anchors ) {\n    // Await the user's click on it\n    anchors[i].addEventListener('click', function (evt) {\n        // Stop redirect\n        evt.preventDefault();\n        // And next slide/fragment\n        Reveal.next();\n    });\n}\nObviously, this isn't the best code, but you get the idea. You can also directly link to a slide, like shown here in the reveal.js presentation, for example:\nhtml\n<a href=\"#/5/2\">Skip to horizontal slide 5 and vertical slide 2!</a>\nHope that helps!\n. Seems pretty simple, working on it, will issue a pull request later. :)\nJust for a suggestion, wouldn't it be more efficient and just preferable to have data-transition-in=... and data-transition-out=...?\n. Is this what you mean?\n// Single:\nReveal.config('theme, 'sky');\n// Multiple:\nReveal.config({\n    'theme': 'sky',\n    'transition': 'page'\n});\n. ",

I made a presentation and when I went back to the start to navigate to a particular frame near the beginning I couldn't find it by moving sequentially. ESC works to find a slide, but sometimes you don't want to show everything and it can be quite resource intensive on slower computers. \n. Since I used reveal.js  locally, I wrote a python script to do this exact thing. As a plugin, python is out but I have a working suggestion for slide separation markers.

And if you want to give away your presentation, you can add local_webserver to your presentation-archive. This is a webserver serving the directory in which it was placed.

Cool. Thanks. :-)\n. Wonderful! :-)\n. Perfect.\n. Why not use something like bower + a suitable gruntjs plugin - e g. https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-bower?\n. > @hakimel is right, that such a thing is clearly not core functionality to reveal.js,\nOf course, this was the reason for my recommendation. :-) It would be great if reveal.js itself would contain a bower.json-file.\n. would you mind to use https:// instead of git://? This would make using the url via coporate proxies easier.\n. I think you need to make a PR agains dev branch. @hakimel Correct?\n. Looks good.

BTW: I started to integrate mermaid into middleman-presentation \u2013 a ruby gem which wraps reveal.js + some more additions.\n. @ludwick \nThanks a lot. I will look into your solution soon. \n@velvia \n\nHm, what about integrating mermaid into marked.js? \n\nI don't think this is a good way. mermaid has nothing to do with markdown parsing, so why should it - a diagram/graph parser - be part of a markdown parser? @chjj Any thoughts on that?\nI really like the idea to have it - mermaid - separated and that it looks for HTML-elements which are flagged with class=\"mermaid\".\nIn my (ruby-) implementation I re-use markdown code blocks to generate the HTML mermaid \"needs\":\n~~~ mermaid-graph\n[...]\n~~~\nbecomes\nhtml\n<div class=\"mermaid\">\n[...]\n</div>\nI use a custom code block parser for kramdown to make this possible. Since this is a ruby gem I'm not sure how this could be done with marked.js. Maybe @chjj can help with some hints.\n@velvia \nIf building a custom code block parser is possible with marked.js, you could then build a plugin for reveal.js/marked.js to integrate it into your presentation.\n. @fehmer Great! I wrote an article some time ago about the design issue I still have.\nI would love to see mermaid have an API like reveal.js, something like\nMermaid.initialize({\n  cloneCssStyles: true | false\n})\nUnfortunately it doesn't have such an interface yet.\n. @velvia I wrote an article which describes the design issue.\n. I think this needs to be solved by mermaid.\n. @velvia \nSee  knsv/mermaid#157 for a more complete \"bug\" description.\n. @velvia I tried to integrate it back in 2015, but that failed. After that I didn't work on that code. :-( Unfortunately I had other things todo and forgot about it I must admit.\n. @hakimel \nWould it be possible to support an \"plugin\" api for external plugins and a reveal.js-contrib-repository to give all the wonderful plugins a home, but do not blow up the main repo to much?\n. @hakimel \nShould I open an issue for a discussion about a \"good\" api for plugins?\n.

Yeah, Chrome uses that stupid Lion fullscreen which is only usable on one screen in the moment (the other one gets that linen background).\nOS X Mavericks will fix that and will make multiple fullscreen apps possible.\nUntil that, there's a fixed Chromium version which uses normal fullscreen. You can get it from here: https://twitter.com/jaffathecake/status/302429135832219649\nUse it like that:\n1. Open the Chromium build (don't move it out of that folder, it needs the .dylibs)\n2.

It actually is - HTML5 fullscreen differs a lot from F11 fullscreen:\nOn OS X, Ctrl-Cmd-F triggers the F11 fullscreen in most apps which will use that stupid Lion fullscreen blocking the second display (Mavericks fixes that but anyway).\nHTML5 fullscreen is a nice \"just working\" fullscreen and the way to go. ;)\n. You seem to just have uploaded everything to your Apache web root.\nApache does not run Socket.io - this requires Node.js.\nSo you have to run a Socket.io server on your server or just use the Socket.io server at revealjs.jit.su for multiplexing. ;)\nAlso, you have to create two different HTML files - one with the secret (so you are able to control) and one without (no control).\n. You would just have to run the same node plugin/multiplex command on your server.\nBut that would probably not be possible.\nSo just use \"revealjs.jit.su:80\" as server and obtain an ID and secret from there (open http://revealjs.jit.su/token in your browser and copy them out).\n. You also have to change url: 'huubhoofs.eu.pn:80' to url: 'revealjs.jit.su:80'.\nThen it will work.\n. It's not important from where you run the master presentation as long as you are connected to the internet/Socket.io server.\nWhat does not work? Can't you control it using your master presentation?\n. You can control the client presentation but it won't control your master presentation (so they would just control their own client instance).\nIf you want to disable that, use the option \"keyboard\": false.\n. Apache is a static file server. That should work.\nCan you upload the master presentation somewhere (upload the master.html to your server) for me to test?\n. I need both. ;)\nNo, wait: I found the solution: You have to upload the plugin folder (the multiplex plugin can't be loaded).\n. What? xD\n. Please upload the plugins and the Socket.io script as well - just have a look at your web inspector console and check for any missing files.\n. Not node_modules. You don't need that.\nJust the folder plugin. And include a script tag in client AND master presentation pointing to http://revealjs.jit.su/socket.io/socket.io.js.\n.

I will open a separate pull request at the end of this week.\n. Replaced by #640 \n. @hakimel I have rebased this pull request on top of #677 that you just merged into dev.\nI have also restored the initial pattern for attributes in elements {. xxx=\"yyy\"}, and make sure the unit-test do test the ability to define a different pattern.\nThat means that c472ca3 fixes 080ae79.\nYou will find the same idea in the test/test-markdown-attributes.html unit test file, where data-attributes defines a different pattern than the one used by default.\n. @hakimel \n\nCan you also remove the debug code (console logs) and add an example to the readme that uses the default slide attribute separator?\n\nAll done, and pushed, based on your latest dev branch.\n. @hakimel I have rebased the attributes_in_markdown branch on top of your latest dev branch (7da98d81107): the tests are still good.\n. @hakimel \"element syntax selection\"? Are you talking about my previous markdown patch #677?\nIt yes, those are two different syntaxes for two different use cases. I'll prefer to see them separate. The default patterns are important (for classes in markdown-generated elements, it is an html comment, in order for those classes to not be displayed in an html preview, when using a markdown editor like https://stackedit.io/).\nFirst, I'll include your case in the slide attributes unit tests, and debug that.\n. @hakimel Can you try again you test case?\n<section data-markdown>\n    <script type=\"text/template\">\n        <!-- slide-attributes: data-background=\"#ff0000\" -->\n        ## Hello world\n    </script>\n</section>\nIt should work now just fine. And the test cases have been updated to test just that scenario.\nOnce you have merge and published that on the branch hakimel/reveal.js@dev, I'll open a new issue/pull request to discuss how to merge markdown element attributes #677, and slide attributes (this pull request #640). \n. @hakimel nope: my test purposefully used a different pattern, in order to test the ability for a user to define his/her own element attributes pattern. I would therefore leave DEFAULT_ELEMENT_ATTRIBUTES_SEPARATOR as it was:\n{. xxxx }\ninstead of the test (which again did on purpose a custom pattern just to see if that worked):\n{c xxx }\n. @hakimel yes, I found the '.' more of a reminder of the css '.' notation for classes.\nI have amended it in c472ca3 (for the README.md) in #640, which now can be applied without conflicts, and with all tests passing.\nHowever, the test only test a custom regex right now.\n. @hakimel Coiuld you please consider a 2.6.1?\nThe current release is really not practical regarding the way it clumsily add 2 different syntax for adding attributes on markdown-generated slide and elements.\n. @hakimel Yes!

    "tomByrer": "I was brainstorming with @nachiket about fragments in MarkDown, there are 3 main ways one can build fragments that I know of:\n- tagging an 'existing' HTML element with class=\"fragment\" (eg make each list-item or paragraph animate separately)\n- wrapping a group of elements with a  <div class=\"fragment\">  (eg h3 with the connected paragraph)\n- same as 2., but with <span class=\"fragment\">.\nRequires some care to pick the right way, since this will make the bullets appear before any of the text; usually you want the bullet & text to appear paired together:\n* <span class=\"fragment\">Built-in file tests</span>\n* <span class=\"fragment\">Built-in arithmetics</span>\n. I think that is a good start  @nachiket !\nBut I think you need to remove the list-item flag [*|+|-#.] from the source MarkDown?\n. Good idea; I was also hoping things would be easier.  There are options:\n- online slid.es for people who don't want to mess around too much\n- use git to make new branches, & bash scripts to configure & package\n- just keep using the same reveal folder & make each .html filename unique\n- I would think a Yoman/Grunt plugin would help if you want to automate, but that also requires setup...\n. iframes work well: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/304\nThough using a <div> would be slightly more convent.\n. True; there are pros & cons to both approaches.\nIt is a good request; I hope someday to see it.  I linked the iframe tip for those who need a workaround right now :)\n. 1. <li class=\"fragment\" data-fragment-index=\"0\"></li> works, so maybe try adding an option to insert the class & data-?\n2. CSS?\n. Hmm, sometimes each sub-list-item might be better animated, sometimes you want to animate them as a group, or perhaps bring them in with their parent (eg B & B.1 enter together).... Not sure if there should be a default, or option-flags...?\n. > Latex/Beamer\nOh that explains why you have good ideas for slideshows, but do not know HTML/JS/CSS/MD very well!\nWell, yes CSS can animate any almost any type of visual block (HTML 'element') you want to.  reveal.js uses a special tag to flag individual steps (pause between items), which its JavaScript engine uses to add the animation when needed.\nSo I pushed forward a reveal.js training slideshow preview for just for you!  \"View Source\" will help to to see the HTML results, though HTML beautifier will help you read the nested List-Items (<li>) better.\nSince webbrowsers consume HTML, not MarkDown, the JS transforms MD into HTML.  When you get comfortable hacking on JS, you can add the exact feature you want to the MarkDown pre-processor.\n. New URL, sorry: http://slid.es/tombyrer/reveal-js-training-tutorial\n. I would try with a 'print' or 'PDF' specific CSS rule to make a box around the slide, a box inside the full page, then center.\n. cheers!\n. Thank you!\n. Thanks for your consideration!\n. You or @hakimel can update the files to allow auto-updating.  Sorry I'm swamped now.\n. Couldn't you just 'inject the HTML'?\n. > Also there is the HTML5 iframe seamless attribute. However that is not supported by all browsers yet.\nToo bad; that would be interesting to try out.\nSeems Ben Vinegar of Disqus found a JS workaround: http://benvinegar.github.io/seamless-talk/#/15 (repo)\n. Maybe you can figure out how to trigger how to use the https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#api to trigger graph changes?\nAlso, I would think D3.js might be a good choice for graphing; seems to have a larger hacker community.  Overall a good idea; animating graphs is always impressive.\n.

I would assume the \"text doesn't show up\" because the .html file has not fully loaded?

Perhaps having a catch-all, touchable/clickable toolbox icon in some fixed place, plus a protocol for plugins to register their own icon into the toolbox, would be a general and hackable solution. This could be something like a toolbox drawer. It could even help us get rid of different plugins collisioning on their summoning keys.\nDon't know how many users use it, but the menu plugin could provide a direct way to have such a dispatcher.

The latter would be a cleaner approach but might require changes in how people use reveal.js compared to the README today.

You're right: after removing the \"CriOS\" check, it looks good with Chrome iOS in landscape mode, but it's badly vertically centered in portrait mode. I'm a bit surprised that you have to use a different logic depending on whether you're in landscape or portrait mode, but there's probably a reason.\nOne proposition: as this works well in landscape mode (which is BTW what most people use for reading presentations), wouldn't it be possible to call removeAddressBar for Chrome iOS in landscape but not in portrait (the listeners would have to be added anyway, but then the \"CriOS\" check would be done at the same time as checking the orientation)?\n.

Then they are passed on to reveal.js again.\n2. The hardware remote control we use for presentations alternates between 'esc' and 'F5' as values for one button. To be able to toggle overview mode using this, I catch the 'F5' and send an 'esc' on to reveal.js.\nNeither use case would be covered by the ability to reassign keys.\nI see the point about not wanting to expose interal methods, but the alternative I see seems worse:\nI could catch the keys, and then map any I don't process otherwise to the exposed reveal.js API functions.

'ESC' only exits fullscreen mode when this has been entered into from JavaScript (via 'requestFullscreen'), i.e. via \"f\" from a reveal presentation.\nWhen you enter fullscreen mode via 'F11', then this is also the toggle for exiting fullscreen again.

    "berteh": "Hello. First of all thanks for reveal.js: it's great, nice looking and easy to use!\nTo me a good workflow includes using reveal as a submodule, not simply forking... and including this single instance of reveal.js as the engine for all the presentations you would create (with a global setting of some kind). (Thus a simple location to update).\nI'd typicall suggest to those that want to use github to manage their own presentations to 1) create a new repository, 2) clone it, 3) add reveal.js as a submodule, 4) make a new \"blank.html\" from from Hakim's index.html with their favorite settings, name and 5) duplicate this template for each of their presentation into a standalone html presentation file.\nin code-someting-like (for those wishing to store their own presentation in github)\ngit clone https://github.com/yourUser/presentationsStockName.git\ncd presentationsStockName\ngit submodule add https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js.git reveal.js\ngit submodule init\ncp reveal.js/index.html blank.html\nedit blank.html\nPut in blank.html your name, favorite settings, typical title, content and conclusion sections, and prepend  \"reveal.js/\" to all \"css/\" \"lib/\" \"js/\" and \"plugin/\"\nevery once in a while update your reveal.js engine with a quick  git submodule update\nAnd for those who want a quick means to organize their thoughts into a reveal presentation there's the (brand new) option of http://berteh.github.io/mindslide/ that turns a freeplane/freemind mindmap into a reveal html presentation.\n(disclaimer; I'm the author of this tool and welcome any comment/suggestion for its improvement)\n. @jongd To workaround similar issue I usually ship a tiny webserver along my slides, such as mongoose: http://code.google.com/p/mongoose/  (45Kb  executable on windows, 65Kb on linux)\nbut agreed: would love not to need it ;)\n.

    "bartfeenstra": "As someone who comes from the PHP world (which has become incredibly strict and progressive over the past few years), I find the official authoring instructions counterproductive, as they require me to modify files that are not mine. I would ideally like to create a presentation as a new project, declare Reveal.js as a dependency, and import the necessary components myself while keeping the ability to update the dependencies (e.g. Reveal.js) regularly and easily.\nWriting my own package.json works well, but not for the full install that requires authors to run grunt serve from the Reveal.js project root.\nAs to the index.html file, a good solution is usually to name these files example files, so index.html becomes index.example.html and it would have to be copied to index.html to work. As index.html is not in the Reveal.js repository, I can easily update the HTML page without modifying my dependencies. However, this only improves the basic installation. The full install needs a more thorough solution.\n. ",

We can also think around having a layout where first half of page is occupied by slide and second half contains the slide notes and all that could be css controlled. this way if someone wants to distribute visual style slides it would be very easy for them.\n. i hope my butting in here is not considered rude however @kemelzaidan you might find this project of mine useful \nhttps://github.com/anantshri/automated_revealjs/\nas @hakimel suggested i am consuming reveal.js here to have a simple flow for creating presentations using external markdown features.\n.

    "rparree": "Hi,\nJust our approach to this:\n- Installed reveal as a bower package (left untouched)\n- using assemble.io to relief presentations from having the reveal\n  boilerplate\n- generate presentations using gulp/assemble.io\nI can't share that repo, but have  isolated the solution and push it to:\nhttps://github.com/edc4it/revealjs-assemble\n. slowly getting nearer a solution. The problem with the arrow, was due to text-align. I have meanwhile placed junly inside a div with my own class in order to reset some CSS:\n<div class=\"jumly\">\n  <script type='text/jumly+sequence'>\n    @found \"You\", ->\n      @message \"meet\", \"JUMLY\"\n  </script>\n</div>\nAnd created the following css\n    .reveal .jumly  *{\n        font-size : 10pt;\n        text-align: start;\n        color:black;\n    }\nJust need to experiment a bit more.\n. Yes i am getting most of it to work by resetting some styles. I am not very good at CSS3, but is it perhaps possible to add a class to reveal which is excluded (using not(\u2026)?) and provides a starting point for plugins like these?\n. My few cents on this...\nIs XInclude intended for HTML. I thought it lends itself more for XML (and therefore XHTML). Also i believe the DOM will need to be parsed upon loading. I guess with a data-attribute/javascript we could load it when needed. I have used xinclude extensively in the past, but never with html(5)\nAlso note you can already use something like\nhtml\n<object data=\"some-file.html\"></object>\nHowever there are some issues (like CSS, explicitly having to set width/height)\nAlso there is the HTML5 iframe seamless attribute. However that is not supported by all browsers yet.\n. You could replace the src of the animated gif with a static image, and then when the section becomes active replace it with the actual gif URL:\n``` javascript\n$(function () {\n    // on page load  replace all src URLs\n$('.animated-gif').each(function (i, e) {\n    disableGif(e)\n});\n\n});\nReveal.addEventListener('slidechanged', initAnimatedGifs);\nReveal.addEventListener('ready', initAnimatedGifs);\nfunction initAnimatedGifs(event) {\n    $('.animated-gif', event.currentSlide).each(function (i, e) {\n        enableGif(e)\n    });\nif (event.previousSlide)\n    $('.animated-gif', event.previousSlide).each(function (i, e) {\n        disableGif(e)\n\n    });\n\n}\nfunction enableGif(e) {\n    var src = $(e).attr(\"src\")\n    $(e).attr('src', src.replace('-image.gif', '.gif'));\n}\nfunction disableGif(e) {\n    var src = $(e).attr(\"src\")\n    $(e).attr('src', src.replace('.gif', '-image.gif'));\n}\n```\n. Just place the snippet in the last script element in your html page after the  Reveal.initialize\nand add the following class to your img: animated-gif\n. no worries...just helping out :) glad i could help\n. I am not sure if it is related. However do note that you are setting the CSS class, so you might want to ensure you apply the same style as img:\ncss\n.animated-gif{\n    max-width: 95%;\n    max-height: 95%;\n}\nTry setting the width and height attributes on your img as well (to the actual size of your gif)\nNote: don't edit the reveal.min.css, this file is generated using grunt (cssmin) from reveal.css. Even better use your own css file, so you can easily pull updates from git without having to merge the css files.\n. @eabigelow ref \"available for small coding jobs\".

If I use MathJax's URL, then everything works.\nResults with my local MathJax:\n\nHere are my scripts:\n        \n\n from: http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/start.html \n                When $a \\ne 0$, there are two solutions to (ax^2 + bx + c = 0) and they are\n                $$x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}.$$\n            \n\nHere are the specifications for reveal.js:\n```\n    math: {\n        // mathjax: 'http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js',\n        mathjax: '/home/steven/Github/MathJax/MathJax.js',\n        config: 'TeX-AMS_HTML-full'  // See http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/config-files.html\n    }, \ndependencies: [\n      { src: 'plugin/notes/notes.js', async: true, condition: function () { return !!document.body.classList; } },\n      { src: 'plugin/math/math.js', async: true }\n    ]\n});\n```\n. Thanks to your tip on checking javascript console of chrome, I figured out where the bug was.

At the moment, it's 1 slide behind so it's not a big deal.\n.

I gave a lecture in RTL reveal.js yesterday and it was kinda annoying...\n. Odd! I just gave two presentations this week ad I remembered it worked fine. Thanks though :-)\n. And where are those forums? I only found a knowledgebase and a place to give suggestions, not interactive support like here...\nI also created the skeleton of the lecture online and wanted to move on to edit it offline. I found the output file is unindented, won't pop up the prompter when I run it with \"grunt serve\" and even section tags are not easily found so slides are not evenly distributed, nor human editable. if I run it through tidy, it kills all the \"section\" and other tags and it's unusable. this is really annoying, since editing all this in VIM is already painful, but I use it with Hebrew slides, and that's REALLY not fun in VIM...\nThis time I'll just have to give up and painfully reshape and reindent 40 slides by hand. I hope @hakimel has improvements to offer in the future.\n. well, this is WITH the new editor.\nI ended up exporting the html, getting rid of the embedded JS scripts in favor of the regular linked one from the reveal.js github, using two SED commands to put all section and /section tags on seperate lines, and finally breaking up the settings JSON and indenting everything with VIM's built in indentation logic (works better than any CLI I tried). I can now finally move on to edit this some more. All this had to be done because I'm missing a few features from the slides.com site. sad.\nbottom line - reveal.js with RTL languages is a bit painful, and exporting from slides.com can use some smoother edges.

I found that links were actually focusable (and clickable) even when you couldn't see them. \n. Just a heads up that role=\"application\" and the use of an aria-live region in Reveal is actually making accessibility worse in JAWS and IE, the most used browser/AT combination. Because the text content is duplicated in the page for aria-live, the content of each slide is read more than once (3 times, actually). I'm working on a pull request to make this better, but I think focus management is probably a better way to go.\n. That would be really cool to see properly hidden slides make it into core.

Looks like I removed too much from the original RecordRTC.js file. I will have a look at it asap. \nSo far I only had tested on Firefox 29, but good to know that it works on Chrome 35 as well.\nCheers\nRaj\n. Tamer,\nI just re-inserted some lines that I accidently deleted from RecordRTC.js. It should work now without the workaround (could not test because I don't have Chrome).\nRaj\n. @metamind16 Thanks for your feedback. I'm glad you like the plugin. Can you give some additional info on the compatibility issues you mentioned?\n. thanks for reporting the problem for Chrome/Android. Not sure what is causing this (and Firefox on Android works). I just opened an issue for the Chrome/Android compatibility in my branch.\n. @trueschool The simplest way at the moment is to download the code from my branch audio-slideshow\n. Just updated the plugin, so that it uses the default audio player to control the audio slideshow (instead of the previously used autoSlide functionality). I also updated to the most recent RecordRTC.js version.\nThis should give more intuitive navigation and full control over the audio including (pause, resume, volume control, mute, jump to time). Also playback on Android should work better now.\nIf you migrate slide decks using previous versions of the plugin please check out the updated demo.\n. @idrdex as far as I know Safari does not (yet?) support WebRTC. As long as this doesn't change, Safari cannot be supported\n. @fghaas Chrome support on Android is limited by design decisions of Chrome developers (i.e. audio is only played upon user interaction). The recent update should work better on Chrome for Android now (no autoadvancing without audio), however, the user has to press the play button on each slide. Firefox on Android works.\n. I just moved the plugin to a seperate repository https://github.com/rajgoel/reveal.js-plugins. All updates to the plugin will be made there. \n. yes, at the moment it is normal. Autoslide ends if isLastSlide() is true (and doesn't play the fragments). To play the fragments one would need a function like isEnd(), but this is not implemented. An easy workaround that I use is to add a blank very last slide after the \"last\" slide.\n. I would like to add another point.\n4 - It would be great to be able to prevent the background video from always playing automatically (especially if the video has sound). I managed to access and control the background video using the getSlideBackground( x, y ) function, but it appears impossible to prevent the video from playing automatically when navigating to the slide. I tried it to pause the video when the slidechanged event fires, but at that time it is to early to stop the video as playing of the video is started later.\n. You might want to checkout the audio-slideshow plugin (Pull-request #944) with which you can add audio files for each slide and fragment (instead of having one large audio file for the entire presentation). The slideshow-recorder plugin that you will also find there, allows you to easily create these audio files. A demo can be found here.\n. Hi, \nyou can check out this plugin for animated svg:\nhttps://github.com/rajgoel/reveal.js/tree/animate/plugin/animate \nYou can find a small example from pull request #804 here: http://courses.telematique.eu/reveal.js-animate/index.html#/20 .  In the example the animation is embedded in the svg-file. When advancing to the next fragment, the svg-animation is triggered. There is not much documentation for the plugin, but the source code in index.html and Soccer_ball_animated.svg should be self-explaining. \n. Hi, I just added a link to a small plugin for svg animation that might be of interest: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/1239#issuecomment-121765373, but above solution looks also very interesting\n. It looks like your problem is the same as this: #702 for which there is a fix in the recent dev-branch #1205.\n. Hi Karl, your problem might be related to this issue: #702\nDid you try putting your equation in backticks $$ J(\\theta_0,\\theta_1) = \\sum_{i=0}  $$?\n. +1\n. For me even the fade transition is not working properly in FF48. Thus, transition: 'none' is the only workable solution for the moment.\n. Thanks for the fix, works better now but not 100% fixed for me. On FF 49 / Ubuntu 16.04 I see this\n\nfor a second when going through the slides. After a second or so, the slide displays correctly. This glitch does not happen all of the time and not on all slides. So far I have only seen this on the \"Fragments\" slides, and here I can reproduce it, so it might actually be related to the slide content. \n. Just tried the concave transition and here this happens\n\nIn contrast to the slide transition glitch above, this display glitch does not disappear after a second. It only happens on the first time when moving to the slide. When revisiting the slide, this glitch does not appear again.\n. I think this is resolved with FF57 :smiley: . @potch \nHere's another example http://courses.telematique.eu/mathematics/?session=3 \nThe glitch where the right part is cutoff appears when moving horizontally (left/right), vertical scroll (up/down) works. Using FF48.0 on Ubuntu 14.04\nPlease, note that I might be change transition mode to \"none\" in a few days because I will release the slides to students and don't want the glitch to be there then.\n.

Do you mind providing a PR to fix this URL?\n. Beside a more semantic naming, what would be the benefits over the current nested <section> HTML tags?\n. I agree, these values should not be forced.

    "Leftium": "I tried a few different inlining tools; I think this one might work: html-inline.\nHowever, there is a problem with resources that are referenced inside JavaScript options, for example:\n- Parallax Background\n- Reveal.js dependencies\nParallax backgrounds are no big loss, but lack of dependencies means I can't use markdown slides.\nI tried loading the markdown plugins as regular script files so the inliner would find them (and commented out the dependencies). The file works fine before inlining, but not after. The inlined version gets this error: inlined.html:1868 Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token where inlined.html:1868 is this line from function getMarkdownFromSlide():\ntext = text.replace( new RegExp( SCRIPT_END_PLACEHOLDER, 'g' ), '</script>' );\nAny ideas why? What would be different between loading markdown.js as a script file and inlining it?\nupdate: the error was because the script being inlined had a string with the text </script> in it...\nI'm so close to creating single-file reveal.js presentations that are simple to share!\n. I did it! Here is reveal.js/plugin/markdown/example.html as a single, inlined html file: example-modded-inlined.html. The example.md file is not inlined, but everything else is~\nHere are the steps to inline your own presentations into a single file:\n1. Modify the html file so the markdown plugin JS files are loaded via <script> tags. Like my example-modded.html.\n2. Process this html file with html-inline.\n3. Replace all occurrences of </script>' with <\\/script>' so the HTML is not parsed incorrectly. There should only be two places. (Alternatively, modify markdown.js before inlining.)\n. @hkdobrev I'm not sure if this will work for all the dependencies, but I just replaced the Reveal.js dependency configuration with actual script tags. The order required is:\n1. marked.js\n2. markdown.js\n3. reveal.js\nI don't use that many dependencies, but I haven't noticed feature degradation at all. Touch swipe gestures, zoom, etc all seem to work.\n. Is @s1n trying to inline external markdown files? I write my content directly in the HTML file, and it works fine. Like this:\n``` html\n\n</p>\n<h1>Markdown</h1>\n<p>\n\n```\nAlso see @hkdobrev's example using Markdown.\n\nIf you're trying to inline an external Markdown file, that won't work unless the inliner is smart enough to recognize Reveal.js's special syntax referring to the external file. I opened an issue for inliner.\nIf you need to work with external Markdown files, a work-around may be to use Pandoc:\npandoc -t revealjs -s -o myslides.html myslides.md. The methods documented in this issue don't work quite right anymore, so I have found a new method. The main change is adding the elements to the slide-background <div> (instead of section, slides, or reveal). This <div> is dynamically generated, so we must wait for the Reveal.js ready event. When printing there is a slight delay followed by unnecessary animation of the headers and footers moving into place, but all the headers/footers are rendered in the PDF as desired.\nPseudo-code:\n1. Style header/footer <div> so they are positioned as desired.\n2. Create hidden header/footer <div>\n3. On Reveal.js ready event, copy header/footer <div> into each .slide-background <div>\nCode: this can be copy-pasted into the end of a reveal.js file (right before the end </body> tag):\n``` html\n\n    /<em> 1. Style header/footer <div> so they are positioned as desired. </em>/\n    #header-left {\n        position: absolute;\n        top: 0%;\n        left: 0%;\n    }\n    #header-right {\n        position: absolute;\n        top: 0%;\n        right: 0%;\n    }\n    #footer-left {\n        position: absolute;\n        bottom: 0%;\n        left: 0%;\n    }\n\n 2. Create hidden header/footer <div> \n\n\nHEADER-LEFT\nHEADER-RIGHT\nFOOTER-LEFT\n\n\n\n\n    // 3. On Reveal.js ready event, copy header/footer <div> into each `.slide-background` <div>\n    var header = $('#header').html();\n    if ( window.location.search.match( /print-pdf/gi ) ) {\n        Reveal.addEventListener( 'ready', function( event ) {\n            $('.slide-background').append(header);\n        });\n    }\n    else {\n        $('div.reveal').append(header);\n   }\n\n``\n. @christinakayastha css/print/pdf.css should not be modified. The slide numbers on a PDF export _do_ change and are useful.\n. What about changing the displayed slide numbers to also be 0-indexed? It could be added as an additional option forslideNumber` to maintain historical behavior.. ",

Then, create the following bash script, called screenshot.sh:\n``` sh\nmkdir -p screenshots            # Creates it if missing\necho \"Now open up your presentation and set it to fullscreen.\"\necho \"You have 10 seconds.\"\nt=10\nwhile [ $t -gt 0 ]; do\n      echo \"$t...\"\n      sleep 1\n      t=$(($t-1))\ndone\ni=1000000\npause=1\nwhile true; do\n    scrot -d $pause \"screenshots/shot$i.png\"\n    xdotool key space\n    i=$(($i+1))\ndone\n```\nOpen your presentation, set it to full screen mode, and finally open up a terminal, execute your script (sh screenshot.sh), and quickly full screen your presentation again, on the first slide. After 10 seconds, scrot will capture your screen every second (adjust pause to change this), and xdotool will simulate a press of the spacebar, advancing the slide.\nOnce your presentation is done, just switch back to the terminal and kill the script with Ctrl+C.

    "swill": "Is there a solution to placing a <!-- .element: class=\"some-class\" --> tag with just a markdown table and being able to make it apply to the <table> element?. In my case I needed the auto show to work with a fragment because I have use cases which use the current-visible class to hide fragments as you cycle through.  Because of this, I needed to be able to leverage the fragments features, but also have optional support for having the first fragment preload.\nIn may case, I have to minimize the usability requirements on the slide maintainer as well as support both preloading and the standard functionality.  \nSince I was unable to find an elegant solution for this problem via Google, and this is the first result when searching, I am posting back my solution here and hopefully it helps others.\nMy content maintainers use Markdown, so here is an example using Markdown.\n- Preloaded fragment on slide transition <!-- .element: class=\"fragment preload\" -->\n- Next fragment to load <!-- .element: class=\"fragment\" -->\n- Last fragment to load <!-- .element: class=\"fragment\" -->\nIn my case, I want both the forward direction and backward direction to work.  So when you go forward, the preload fragment should be automatically shown.  When you go backwards, I don't want the preload fragment to disappear before transitioning to the previous slide, so on hide of the preload fragment, I am also transitioning to the previous slide so the implementation feels smooth and obvious.\nHere is the code:\n```javascript\n// automatically load the initial fragment on a slide if the fragment\n// has been defined with the 'preload' class\nReveal.addEventListener('slidechanged', function(event) {\n  if (event.currentSlide.querySelectorAll('.preload[data-fragment-index=\"0\"]').length > 0) {\n    Reveal.nextFragment();\n  }\n});\n// if the initial fragment on a slide has been defined with a 'preload' class\n// then transition to the previous slide if the fragment is hidden\nReveal.addEventListener('fragmenthidden', function(event) {\n  if (event.fragment.hasAttribute('data-fragment-index') && event.fragment.classList.contains('preload')) {\n    if (event.fragment.attributes['data-fragment-index'].value == \"0\") {\n      Reveal.prev();\n    }\n  }\n});\n``\nEnjoy, hopefully this is helpful for others.... @G1305 I put these two functions right after myReveal.initialize({ ... });` call in my slides template file.  I am not sure if this is the correct place to put it, but it works for me.  I am actually working off a fork of this project https://github.com/yusukebe/revealgo, so my implementation is likely a little different from yours.  I have rebased that project to include the latest reveal.js code, so I suspect everything will work as expected for you once you include those calls in your template.  Cheers.... @bnjmnt4n How do you add a class to a markdown table?. Unfortunately that requires that I have predefined the class.  I have already done this in some cases, but I would prefer to be able to do something like this.\n<!-- .element: style=\"font-size:80%;\" -->\nBut there is no way to apply this to a table (or a code block for that matter).\nFor a code block, I often want to do something like this:\n<!-- .element: style=\"width:50%; float:right;\" -->\nThere does not seem to be a way to apply these details to either table or code elements which is really unfortunate..

Still digging...\n. Oh, @ocombe's test actually works just great for me after renaming data-vertical to data-separator-vertical (per changes from https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/commit/015468c3a2d1d4092f33920ac555a0e288e6213f, released in 3.0 on Jan 9, 2015).\nI believe @rhhamburg correctly diagnosed the issue: if I switch my slides.md file between Unix and Windows line endings, it works (Unix) and fails (Windows).\nUpdating the regex to include an optional \\r fixes it for me regardless of line endings: data-separator=\"^\\r?\\n----\\r?\\n$\" data-separator-vertical=\"^\\r?\\n---\\r?\\n$\"\nSimilarly, the following regex works with both line endings: data-separator=\"^----$\" data-separator-vertical=\"^---$\"\n. @hakimel I suggest updating the DEFAULT_SLIDE_SEPARATOR in markdown.js line 29 with ^\\r?\\n---\\r?\\n$ (or just ^---$) and closing this as a configuration issue.\nFWIW, in my own decks I use ^\\s{0,3}-\\s*-\\s*-[-\\s]*$ and ^\\s{0,3}\\*\\s*\\*\\s*\\*[\\*\\s]*$, which let me use a line of three or more hyphens or asterisks to indicate horizontal or vertical separations, respectively, which matches up nicely with Markdown's horizontal rule syntax.\n. Looks like you're still serving up the reveal.min.js from 2.6.1. Did you run the Grunt task to generate the reveal.min.js and reveal.min.css files?\n. No problem, sorry for the too-short response :)\nBasically, when you download the master version of reveal, you only get the basic source files. Others, like reveal.min.css and reveal.min.js can be derived from those base files, and need to be generated on your end if you'd like to use them.\nTo do that, you can use Grunt to run \"tasks\" from reveal.js's Gruntfile.\nIf you're on Linux or Mac OS X and have Node.js installed, the quick way to do this is to cd into your reveal directory and run:\nnpm install\nnpm install grunt-cli\n./node_modules/.bin/grunt\nWhich should, if all goes well, will build minified versions of those assets.\nAlternatively, you could just edit your Week7.html to refer to reveal.js and reveal.css instead of reaval.min.js and reveal.min.css respectively. :)\n.

    "fghaas": "@hakimel, I just came across this and it looks like an excellent addition to me. This seems to not impact existing reveal.js code at all as it's just a plugin, is there any serious holdup to seeing this merged? \n. @rajgoel One compatibility issue that I found is this: in Chrome on Android, the slides auto-advance in step with the duration of the audio, as expected. But as the second slide (and subsequent slides) are loaded, the audio doesn't auto-play. However, the slides still auto-advance as expected per the duration of the audio.\nOn Chrome on Linux, in contrast, both auto-advance and audio auto-play work just fine.\n. @hakimel \u2014 just taking the liberty to follow up with this. This is a really useful feature; could it be merged anytime soon? \n. I've run into a similar issue. I'd like to be able to control a presentation in multiplex mode, with the speaker notes on a phone or tablet. I haven't found a way to get enable a keyboard in Chrome on Android unless there is actually an input field, so I'm unable to hit s for speaker notes.\nMaybe an alternate gesture would work for touch devices? reveal already supports pinch-zoom as an alternate to Esc for overview mode; maybe double-tap would work as an alternate to s for speaker notes?\n. @Enkerli So can you explain how exactly you're enabling this, i.e. how you switch your touch device to speaker notes?\n. Well that seems to apply to slides.com, but what do you do if you host your slides on your own server?\n. Can I suggest you use the fade transition by default instead?\n. @slipring, actually, that's pretty much exactly what I'm looking for. Thanks for pointing me to it! \n. @lordsutch, thanks for the heads-up! \n. I don't modify the original theme CSS, but habitually include this in my presentations:\nhtml\n<!-- reveal.js CSS theme and local overrides -->\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"reveal.js/css/reveal.css\"/>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"reveal.js/css/theme/black.css\" id=\"theme\"/>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/reveal-override.css\"/>\nAnd then you could include what @graffen and @rparree have suggested, in your reveal-override.css.\n@hakimel, can you close this? It's neither a bug nor a feature request. \n. Yes the PR is trivial, but I've noticed that if I use the updated socket.io client in conjunction with the notes plugin, then instead of the next slide I only ever see the current slide in the speaker console. This applies only to the master presentation, i.e. the one where the socket.io secret is non-null, and the speaker console does work as expected on slaves. Is this a new problem, or has this existed before?\n. @jereme-leandev please feel free to do that. I'm not sure if @hakimel has any intention to merge this PR though; it's been sitting in the queue for more than a month...\n. @hakimel Thanks! So to clarify, does this mean that a presentation using current master will not work with multiplexing via revealjs.jit.su?\n. @hakimel I agree. I, for one, wouldn't at all mind to be able to use both notes and multiplex together. :)\n. @Delapouite I'm afraid that wouldn't make sense. Asciinema has an API method that allows playing an asciicast, but not one that allows stopping or pausing it. See https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema.org/blob/master/app/views/api/asciicasts/show.html.slim if you want to take a look.\n. A completely unintrusive three-line patch, and you want a plugin for that? Are you sure? \n. Look, I don't mind, I've had this in my own fork for a while anyway and don't mind keeping it that way. Also, seeing as this patch has been sitting here for 5 months I hadn't expected it to go in. Let's close this.\n. So I had a look at this and it's certainly useful, if not quite as useful as it could be. A few issues:\n- What's a typical reason for not finishing a slide on time? Taking a question. Would you want to discourage taking questions? I hope not. So maybe you'd want to be able to to pause the countdown while taking a question, and intuitively you might want to click on the timer. Currently that resets the whole talk timer to zero, meaning your pacing now assumes that you have an additional buffer equal to the combined time budget of all prior slides. So that's a missing feature (which is fine, can always be added later) combined with somewhat counter-intuitive and illogical behavior (which really should be fixed).\n- What do you typically do to account for that in your time budget? You plan a reserve at the end of the talk. Defining a reserve is something you may want to consider, as in \"you're over time on this particular slide, but you've only used 30 seconds of a 5-minute buffer\".\n- Setting the default to 120s is problematic. The \"2 minutes per slide\" rule gets repeated just as often as the \"no more than 7 bullets per slide\" rule, and both are equally wrong \u2014 the time you spend on a slide is inherently flexible based on a number of factors, just as 7 bullets is way too many. I'd suggest having the default be set to 0, in which case the pacing information should also be suppressed in the speaker console.\n. I'd say for any slide that doesn't count toward the time budget, the onus is on the speaker to set data\u2011timing=\"0\", which should be interpreted as \"this slide has no time budget,\" rather than \"this slide has a time budget of zero, except when massless and traveling at c which would make the time budget \u221e\".\n. I'd say if a slide has data\u2011timing=\"0\" (or \"-1\", whichever you prefer), then just pause the pacing timer as soon as you get to that slide. For the overall time budget count it as zero. Doesn't matter whether the slide is at the beginning or midway through.\nYes of course you should also have an option to pause the timer, rather than only be able to reset it, but reveal currently doesn't have that for the \"elapsed time\" timer either. So that's icing on the cake.\n. You're burrowing deep in a rabbit hole here. I'd say keep your changes as they are for now, except setting the default to 0 and not showing the pacing timer if the pacing value for the current slide (either via data-timing or by default) is <=0, and get this merged. Then add bells and whistles.\nOr, drop this PR and start your own plugin.\n. Point taken. (I've never really understood how some plugins live in the main repo and others don't, but that's a different story.)\n. @hakimel This looks like a very useful feature to me at this point; would you consider merging it?\n. Awesome! Thanks for merging this @hakimel, and congrats to @aspiers for getting it landed. . ",

For the \"reduce\" mode, in order to reduce them and fit them vertically. For the \"scroll\" mode, in order to know the pixels to scroll. Another option to make them fit horizontally would be to reduce the font size, but that would reduce the vertical size also, so I do not think it would be a good solution.\n- \"The footer does not rescale as nicely as reveal.js. On small devices / small resolutions, it can become a bit messy\": The footer and the font of its content do scale, but it is true I have not tried it very much on small devices. And the scaling is done relative to the height, so in a device and resolution such as the one you show, I guess it is normal that it does so. Maybe I should make it scale relative to the minimum of width and height?

I think this info is outdated. Print stylesheet should be supported quite fine in most cases\u2026\nWould you accept a PR to remove this dependency from the Readme?. Yeah, okay, some browsers prevent t6he background from being colored. But that may be deactivatable in the settings (in Firefox it is, AFAIK).. BTW for such style resets you mention (that are used to make the visibility the same in multiple browsers) there exist various small CSS stylesheets that are explicitly created for this job.. That's hard. It is more or less expected. AFAIK it just synchronizes the events such as \"next slide/fragment\"/\"previous slide/fragment\".. It could be added as an option, e.g. named reverseKeyboard, but AFAIK you can already ad custom keybindings (see Readme), so you could emulate the behavior too, now.. A popup blocker? . Why do you want to do so?. I think if one does so, it should be included in reveal.js. But maybe you can use the (additional) head CSS classes in your presentation, or is it not that useful? (I am not sure what this CSS is anyway\u2026 \ud83d\ude04 ). Good idea. It would IMHO be the best solution for https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/2027. You can then still drag the tab out of the current window to another screen, all browsers support that\u2026\nAnd the popup does not really make it easier, as it also just opens on the current screen. So you have to move the window to the other screen, anyway\u2026. No, works fine here\u2026 (at least that is not the issue\u2026). In other words: Can I call Reveal.configure with dependencies and it will load these, even after Reveal.initialize?. That's already how it is configured\u2026. Just tested this again and you seem to be right. Anyway, this is a bug in reveal.js as it should work anyway\u2026. Yep, works for me.. @dyanakiev Any example code or so? Or even a PR?. So why can't you send a PR here to this project to contribute that change back?. IMHO the best solution for this would be https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/2002. See the explanation there. Popups are not great, just open in a new tab\u2026. @hakimel Any news here?. It's harder than one may think, because the slide directions are really built-in, but here is an approach. settingsObject is passed to Reveal.initialize.\nhttps://gist.github.com/rugk/0d3a6684a393f6f3f8ac10716d299dd6\nIt overrides all keyboard buttons for back/forwards, (but not the visible ones) and enter. \nWith data-navigate you can specify which slide to navigate to in the section. You can specify the exact slide number ( 0,0 for the first slide, etc.) or basic \"right\", \"left\", \u2026 commands\u2026\nIn contrast to Reveal.right(), it stays in the same row when navigating right/left. (Note when you use different numbers of rows this may lead to some unexpected results.)\nIt also needs to override the line numbers, to make them match. For this, you need to specify the line numbers via data-number=\"2\" manually in the section.\nFinally, it also overrides going back via the keyboard. It records the whole history, you have visited\nYou may adjust it to your use-case though and only use some parts of this.. Does not seem as if the changes should really be merged into the master though. So if this is the case, you can close this PR.. Just set history to true. Then it should show it to you and reload to the same slide via #/slide number.. Well\u2026\u02ddthe slide said \"Alt+click\"\u2026 but yes, it works with Ctrl\u2026 thanks.\nJust wonder why it does not use Alt there, too. It would totally be possible\u2026. Ah, that is KDE's behavior, is not it? So there it won't work\u2026 \nDon't see any problem why that should not work in GNOME here.. Yeah, I'd rather worry about the standards. I mean, at least, it should be properly documented\u2026\nOr could not you just bind to both keys, so whatever one you can use on the platform works?. ",

To phrase this differently: Is there any reason why I should not use valid links when linking into reveal.js presentations?\nMy use case is as follows: I've got lots of internal links between different presentations and into presentations, and I'd like those links to be understandable by crawlers and search engines. Towards that end, the slash must not be used. Any suggestions or recommendations? In particular, readURL() removes # and / before looking up DOM elements, which ensure that links without slashes currently work. Are there any plans to change that behavior in the future so that links without slashes might not work any longer?. To continue my use case: If I just use valid links without leading slash when linking into presentations, the browser history does not work. PR #2282 fixes this.. In PR #2282, there is a problem with fragments that do not start with #/: In Firefox, on most slides with named ID links, the contents (including the progress bar) jump upwards before being displayed at their correct position, which is very distracting.  Any ideas why this might happen?  (This does not happen with Chromium.)\nAs an example, try moving back and forth between slides 3 and 4 of this presentation in Firefox.\n[Dec. 6: Updated link to sample presentation.]. ",

In this case, there's a slide with data-state=\"custom-state\" having fragments that the event handler will be scoped to.\nIt would also be neat if the value of Reveal.getIndices().f was exposed on the event object for a given fragment, so it's more discoverable and easier to add a simple switch in there.. I would like a generic solution to this as well, perhaps as a data attribute that you can add to both <section> and .fragment? Something like this would be nice:\nhtml\n<section data-state=\"introduction\" data-onshow=\"showSlide\">\n    <div class=\"fragment\" data-onshow=\"showFragment\">\n        ...\n    </div>\n</section>\n```javascript\nfunction showSlide(event) {\n    // The 'event' object will contain 'state: \"introduction\"'\n    // and other things that identify the slide.\n}\nfunction showFragment(event) {\n    // The 'event' object will contain the fragment index,\n    // as well as data identifying the slide (\"introduction\"),\n    // etc.\n}\n```\nWhat's nice about this approach is that it is rather flexible and it will (or at least should) take care of adding and, more importantly, removing event handlers for the functions.

So for convenience I would rephrase my feature request: turn fragments into vertical slides\n. Another presentation tool is https://github.com/pdfpc/pdfpc which added my feature request https://github.com/pdfpc/pdfpc/issues/242.\nIt is realized by a new method of going forwards/backwards:\n\nj/k Go to the previous / next slide, skipping over overlays that have already been viewed, but at most one user slide.\n\nI admit they swapped the meaning of the vi-like inspired keybindings.\nBut a user can map the arrow keys to use them exclusively during the presentation which is actually what I want.\nUnfortunately, macOS support of pdfpc is limited.

    "Hotschke": "@hakimel yes and no. Yes, this would give the speaker a method to resolve the issue of clicking desperately many times to go to already shown slides. Thanks for your code change suggestion.\nAnd no: Most presenter tools (I mean the hardware devices often combined with a laser pointer) have often only left and right buttons because they are not aware of vertical slides which I consider quite an uncommon feature. I guess these devices send keycodes corresponding to the left and right arrow keys. For instance, MS Powerpoint, PDFs and other established tools for talks do not have vertical slides.\nAlso I think to remove any additional burden of a stressed speaker it would be great if the speaker could stick to only next and previous slide actions and do not have to use also down to proceed the talk.\nSo IMHO, reveal.js should remember whether a slide has already been visited. Browser cache or a cookie would offer means to do this. If the speaker actually want to hide fragments again, additional keys are actually necessary. This could be up/down keys. So for this case up and down keys on the laptop have to be used if not available on the presenter device. However, this is the more uncommon case. I myself have not yet seen any talk where someone wanted to hide already shown lines, but speaker always go back to older slides in almost every talk.\nSince no one else is interested in this the wontfix label seems to be appropriate.\n. I just want to mention that there is the presentation framework https://github.com/shower/shower which exactly works like this issue is asking about.

Biting me too, but I think the problem is  present for any percentage value.\n. Any activity on this one? Really a pain.\n. Another data point: the site given above locks up FireFox on my ElCap macbook pro, but Safari (9.1.2) handles it just fine.\n. ?. FWIW, on Safari 11.0.3 in High Sierra 10.13.3, Safari always shows the background, no matter what the status of the checkbox.. I meant that Safari does show the background and the checkbox doesn't affect it.. No help on this?\n. Yeah, I suppose my question has to do with whether Safari is doing this right (and the others wrong) or vice versa, and whether there's another way to do this.\n. Did a quick fork to include both position and repeat. For some values of size these don't work.. Nobody?. Got bit by this again today with a display that was differently sized from my monitor and got a repeated image.. Is it just me?. @hakimel, I believe that the default is to repeat the parallaxBackgroundImage when it's smaller than the window, which may not be desirable. For example, you might want your image centered, or have it as a logo in a corner. So you need to be able to set the repeat and the location for that.\nI tend to use a background image, but leave the parallaxBackgroundHorizontal and vertical at null, so that it doesn't move; it just gives me a nice background. You can already set the movement to be something other than null and reveal.js will respect that. I generally don't want a repeating image though.\n(Is that what you meant?). Either way is fine with me.\nNote that the horizontal and vertical values are set to null by default in reveal.js, so that you get a non-moving image unless you specify otherwise. It might be simpler just to leave it as is, or change the variable's name to drop the \"parallax\" bit, unless the extra code is burdensome. Then users can put in a background image, and move it simply by setting the H and V values without worrying about setting a separate parallax background image.. I'll put up a link to my css when I get it done, but here's how I managed to get full-sized, proportional images via css. The captions are hidden unless hovered over and cover the bottom portion of the slide. Still need to tweak them a bit, but I'm fairly happy with this so far.\n```css\n.reveal p {\n  display: block;\n  margin: .5em;\n  height: auto; }\n.reveal h1, .reveal h2, .reveal h3, .reveal h4, .reveal h5, .reveal h6, .reveal li {\n  height: auto; }\n.reveal figure, .reveal section {\n  height: inherit; }\n.reveal .slides {\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n  top: 0;\n  margin-top: 0; }\n.reveal .slides > section {\n  padding: 0; }\n.reveal section img {\n  border: none;\n  margin: 0; }\n.reveal img, .reveal video, .reveal iframe {\n  max-height: 100%;\n  height: 100%; }\n.reveal figure img {\n  box-shadow: none;\n  max-width: 100%;\n  object-fit: contain;\n}\n.reveal figcaption {\n  position: absolute;\n  margin: auto;\n  width: 100%;\n  left: 0;\n  text-align: center;\n  bottom: 1em;\n  height: auto;\n  display: block;\n  background-color: white;\n  color: black;\n  font-size: small;\n  opacity: 0;\n}\n.reveal figcaption:hover {\n  opacity: .9;\n}\n```\nEDIT: Added all relevant changes.. This is the problem I typically find as well: slides I prep on my laptop (8:5) have too much text for some (but not all) projection systems I end up using for a presentation. And I can't predict what the projector will be able to handle, of course.. These aren't solutions that work well, as I think has been made clear in the discussion above.. Do they need to be? Aren't they legal URI characters?. ",
    "davidjb": "If using Markdown to render images, even adding the CSS like so:\n![Example](img/example.png) <!-- .element class=\"stretch\" -->\nisn't enough because when rendered, the Markdown renderer adds a <p> tag around the <img> which presents the stretch code from applying.  The current codebase is looking for just section > .stretch, which means this won't work.  I worked around the issue by editing the reveal.js source so that it applies like so:\ntoArray( dom.slides.querySelectorAll( 'section > .stretch, section > p > .stretch' ) ).forEach( function( element ) {\nGetting rid of the surrounding <p> tag would be better, but I haven't seen if that's possible.\n.

It will however only show one alert, for the first error. \n. Yeah, I\u2019d like to get rid of that function as well, but if I\u2019m not missing something then head.load would give me no error callbacks.\n. I hope so!\n.

    "Organizer21": "Any update on this issue? Several of my slides (including the first one) received image, text and graph data via ajax and the slide I am on when pressing reload generally sees a vertical offset (too low down), going back and forth resolves but when this also happens on slide one it's a bit of a tricky one :) Is there a hotfix as to set height of the container or something (e.g. slide one got a variable height image, and a text that that is either 1, 2 or 3 lines long so I don't know the initial height).. I just ran into this or a very problem (though having the same issue in FF and Chrome). In essence I'm rendering a highcharts JS graph and the mouse hover does not match the tool-tip making it unusable. Interestingly it only happens if if I render it as spline or line, as a column, bar or pie it seems to work fine.\nI'm not sure I'm smart enough to resolve with the suggestions made in StackOverflow so it would be great to see a bug fix getting into reveal (which is really awesome by the way, just testing it out on my first project). Simple illustration attached, the position is often off with quite a bit.\nFrom what I can see this is one that triggers for me --> if( scale > 1 && features.zoom ) { xxx } which might not be the same as the fallback one that is referenced in the StackOverflow response.\nMy graph is simply within a reveal tag section with the code <div id=\"dashboard_cm_daily\"></div>\n. @mcmcclur Thank you for taking the time to provide additional feedback and suggestions, much appreciated. I played around with percentage option initially and quickly discarded it as in my case mobile and tablet is playing a more important role. \nI did not know that would fix this issue, but yes checking again that does indeed resolve it. I also noticed that it affects my pie chart... only the bar and column seems unaffected for unknown reason. Overall I think i need to find a another solution (not sure if another graph script would work better or if this can happen with any and all SVG options and also not sure @hakimel is around and would be willing to look closer at it, if so I'd do a fiddle if needed for further testing).\nAfter going with this script over some other options I was really happy how well it seemed to work out... now I'm sort of lost :) \nUpdate: Created a codepen that shows the issue, not working perfectly, but resize the codepen preview and all pending on your screen resolution it will showcase a bad offset.\nhttps://codepen.io/anon/pen/MVLazG\n. Thanks, yeah I'm no advanced coder so nor sure what I can do. I guess there's no way to disable scaling on a select element/div  only, in my case the chart script is fairly responsive so that would scale to the rest without the revealjs scaling.. Just in case anyone else is looking here at one point; ended up making my presentation larger by default so that I could disable the upscale (which is zoom based). Then with the help of the code link you provided I now have a working presentation (well it can't zoom up but that's fine for the time being). Thanks again for your help @mcmcclur. Hopefully someone else will improve it further given time.. Anyone ?

In the example below, quizInit targets '#quiz-target'.\nhtml\n  <div class=\"slides\">\n    <section>\n      <h3>Slide 1</h3>\n    </section>\n    <section id=\"quiz-target\">\n    </section>\n    <section>\n      <h3>Slide 3</h3>\n    </section>\n  </div>\n.

Puzzled by your second comment - I'm wondering how it would be possible to press ? on any standard English-based keyboard without pressing Shift?\n. This sounds great, thanks!  @hakimel please can this be merged as a matter of priority?\n. I'm pretty sure you didn't mean to submit this pull request here.  It tries to replace reveal.js with your own presentation.\n. Submitted against wrong branch - resubmitting against dev.\n. > Would you want to discourage taking questions?\nI think there are two approaches to talks:\n1. Insist that people hold their questions until the end (important with large audiences)\n2. Welcome questions at any point (better with smaller audiences, at less formal events)\nClearly, a strict timing plan will not work as well with the latter, but it should with the former.  But having said that ...\n\nSo that's a missing feature (which is fine, can always be added later) combined with somewhat counter-intuitive and illogical behavior (which really should be fixed).\n\nCongratulations for correctly predicting my next plans for this feature :-)  I was thinking of adding +1 and +5 minute buttons to add more time - not just for questions, but also sometimes the event organizer decides to give you more time during the middle of the talk.  But your pause button idea is a great idea - probably even better.  Maybe we can have both.\n\nDefining a reserve is something you may want to consider\n\nAnother excellent idea!  Yes - allocating a 5 min reserve would mean that it could be used up accumulatively at any points during the talk.  Saving it to the end is ideal, but having flexibility to take questions earlier is even better.  Question: should a pause button always toggle countdown between the main timer and the reserve timer?  Or sometimes do you really want to pause everything?  That would have the effect of delaying the end of the presentation, of course.\n\nthe time you spend on a slide is inherently flexible based on a number of factors\n\nThis is of course true.  However in my experience, when averaged out over a whole presentation, 2 minutes per slide is startlingly accurate as rules of thumb go, for my personal presentation style.  Your style tends to use far sparser slides, so I doubt it would work as well for you.  That said, you may well be right that it makes more sense for this feature to be suppressed by default.\n. The other problem I have noticed is that generally we don't want the timer to start until the 2nd slide or so, e.g. if the 1st slide is a QR code or other cover slide which is to be shown whilst waiting for the audience to get settled.  Suggestions very welcome for how best to handle this.\n. I was thinking \"-1\" might be a more apt value, but it doesn't matter much.  The difficult bit is figuring out how to pause the timer when it's on that slide.  Would you say this would only happen for slides at the beginning?\n. Just thought of a second use case for \"pause\" slides: a long session (e.g. hands-on training) where you want to allocate flexible breaks at various points.  So yes, something like data-timing=\"pause\" seems to make sense.\nCurrent thinking:\n- add a new totalIgnoredTime variable\n- add a pauseStart variable which is normally null, but gets set to wall-clock time when either a slide with data-timing=\"pause\" is entered, or a pause button is manually clicked\n- when a \"pause\" slide is exited or the pause button is released, the elapsed time since pauseStart is added to totalIgnoredTime and then pauseStart set back to null\n- calculation of time left for the current slide adds totalIgnoredTime to the time available\n- clicking +1 min or +5 min buttons would add to totalIgnoredTime accordingly\nI still haven't figured out the best UI regarding a \"reserve\" timer though.  Intuitively, allowing setting of a reserve timer to (say) 5 minutes as a buffer for unplanned questions makes sense.  However if the presenter presses the Pause button, that could be either\na) to answer a question, in which case it should start eating away at the reserve, or \nb) it could be for the kind of break mentioned above, in which case everything should be paused.\nSo how to distinguish between these two types of pause in the UI?\nWould also be nice to show:\n- how much of reserve is remaining\n- current ETA for session finish\n- estimate of how long the remaining material should take\nwhilst somehow retaining a simple and intuitive UI.\n. Sure, those enhancements can come in a separate PR to this one.\nIt definitely doesn't make sense to start another plugin though, because it's inextricably linked with the existing built-in notes plugin.\n. FWIW this plugin helped me and a colleague successfully deliver > 50 slides and 2 demo videos within 36 minutes ;-)  https://www.openstack.org/videos/video/high-availability-for-pets-and-hypervisors-state-of-the-nation\n. @hakimel Sure, I can do that.  Do you think it would be reasonable if it was enabled by the presence of the defaultTiming configuration parameter?\n. @hakimel I have just rebased this branch and made the feature optional as requested, so that it's only activated when defaultTimings is configured.  /cc @fghaas. > I wonder if you ever want to have both the elapsed time and pacing... Feels like if you opt into pacing the elapsed time counter is only visual clutter that makes it harder to follow your pacing. Maybe we should hide the elapsed time when pacing is turned on?\nPersonally I prefer to have it there, and the colouring distinguishes the pacing timer from the previous one - but we could do that, or make it optional. .

When the presenter accidentally/unknowingly clicks in the upcoming slide view then later tries to advance using the keyboard they are expecting the presentation to advance. This can be quite distracting when in the middle of a presentation.\nPerhaps there needs to be a clear indication that the upcoming slides view has keyboard focus (or that the rest of the speakers notes do not).. I've been considering something like this for a little while. I would rather see the outer section of the stack used for the common background. For example...\n```\n\n\nVertical slide 1\n\n<section>\n    <h1>Vertical slide 2</h1>\n</section>\n\n<section data-background-image=\"...\">\n    <h1>Vertical slide 3</h1>\n</section>\n\n\n```\nThis would remove the need for the configuration flag, keeping the background scheme easy to understand, and I expect would keep the background handling in the code cleaner. It also provides flexibility to override the common background with a background in any of the individual slides, eg for vertical slide 3 in the example above.. When I tried this code it still resets the stack's video background if there's a vertical slide that also has a video background. For the example below, the first two slides will show a.mp4 in the background without restarting the video (as you want). Changing to slide 3 will start b.mp4 as the background. Changing to slide 4 will again show a.mp4 as desired, but it will be played from the beginning of the video.\n```\n\n\nVertical slide 1\n\n<section>\n    <h1>Vertical slide 2</h1>\n</section>\n\n<section data-background-video=\"b.mp4\">\n    <h1>Vertical slide 3</h1>\n</section>\n\n<section>\n    <h1>Vertical slide 3</h1>\n</section>\n\n\n```\nI think it would be better to keep track of the stack background separately from the individual slides to handle this. Have a look at https://github.com/denehyg/reveal.js/commit/ef097a3696605d65bdbea8af676bda94355ccaf1 and see if that works for you. It leaves the existing background handling alone so there should no concern about breaking other stuff.. It's possible this is the same issue as #2157. The fix for this is in the dev branch but not yet in master. If you're not already, you could try it with the dev branch to see if that fixes your issue.. Or it could be the same as #2119, which still seems to be an issue.. ",

Try out the beta feature extended version. If you did try it out, and it still doesnt work, then download the presentation as a HTML file(go to export -> download via HTML.

I was trying to do this with a handler on the window resize event and using Reveal.getScale(), but had trouble because (I think) it sometimes fired before the reveal resize handling. So this would have been helpful for me. (I figured out another way to do what I wanted.)\nNote though that the name might conflict with this proposal for element resize events.. You can do this by setting data-start-indexv=\"1\" on the middle stack. See https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/427 and the source.\nIf you want to do something more complicated than that, you can do something like what you've done, except instead of calling Reveal.right (which actually slides you) you can set data-previous-indexv=\"1\"  to control where you'll slide into in a vertical stack.. Yes, the ended event is sent. Something like this should work (but I haven't tested it):\nhtml\n<section>\n  <video data-src=\"...\" id=\"my-video\">\n</section>\n<section>\n  <h2>Next slide</h2>\n</section>\njavascript\ndocument.getElementById('my-video').addEventListener('ended', function() {\n  Reveal.next();\n});\nI think this will also fire if the video stalls because it's not loading data fast enough; you could check for that in the event handler.. You can set data-start-indexv=\"0\" on each vertical stack. That is:\nhtml\n<section data-start-indexv=\"0\">\n  <section><h2>Slide 1/1</h2></section>\n  <section><h2>Slide 1/2</h2></section>\n</section>\n<section data-start-indexv=\"0\">\n  <section><h2>Slide 2/1</h2></section>\n  <section><h2>Slide 2/2</h2></section>\n</section>\n(Don't think this is documented, but here's the source; it was added in https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/427.)\nYou can also automate this if you don't want to keep track of it; something simple like\njavascript\nfor (var sec of document.getElementsByClassName('section')) {\n  sec.dataset.startIndexv = 0;\n}\nwill set it on every section, but that shouldn't hurt anything.. It was actually updated recently in the dev branch: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/pull/2305. It hasn't been merged over to master / a release yet, though.. an should be a here. ",

    "ranr01": "same here on firefox 47...\n. I was not working on a presentation for a while so this comment is somewhat delayed :-)\nThanks for the info, it works quite well. A small improvement would be to not having to paste the SVG code manually into the HTML. This makes the editing of the figures very cumbersome.\nMy solution to that is the following:\n\nAdd fragments etc. in  SVG file. \nFor correct scaling you should add preserveAspectRatio=\"xMinYMin meet\" to the svg tag of you file.\nInclude the SVG as an object like this:\n <object type=\"image/svg+xml\" data=\"your_svg_file.svg\">\n   </object> \nAdd the following JS script as a dependency inside Reveal.initialize({...}) (Adapted from here):\nReveal.getSlides().forEach(function(s){\n  s.querySelectorAll(\"object\").forEach(function(e) {\n    if (e.contentDocument)\n      e.parentElement.replaceChild(e.contentDocument.documentElement.cloneNode(true), e);\n    });\n  });\nFor example, if you save this script as inline_svg.js' you include it inside the depencies like this:\n```\nReveal.initialize({\n     ...\n   dependencies: [\n    ... ,               \n        { src: 'inline_svg.js' }\n     ]\n});\n``` \nThe script will find all theobject` elements in the HTML and will replace them with inline SVG elements so that Reveal.js can present them just like any other element.\n\nThe script can probably be more robust (i.e. select just specific objects etc.) but my JS knowledge is very minimal and I was happy just to make it work :-).... I actually have a slightly better way of doing this now (see here: reveal-inline-svg )\nThe main idea is the same but there is no need to insert the fragments into the SVG directly.\nInstead you specify the fragments and other properties of different SVG elements as <param> elements inside the<object> element. \nThe JS then applies these properties when in-lining the SVG instead of the <object> elements.\n.

I didin't know about the possibility of setting config params by the url.\nUnder this circumstances I propose to generalize the printNotes feature and add a notesLayout option.\njavascript\nnotesLayout: 'none' // no notes shown\nnotesLayout: 'default' // = 'none'\nnotesLayout: 'inline' // like the current 'showNotes' behaviour\nnotesLayout: 'side' // Slide size resized to 70% and a notes bar of 30% width on the right\nnotesLayout: 'separatePage' // On the following page\nThis layoutNotes option simply should include a css file from css/print/notes/so the user can create it's own.

The way it was before gave very little importance to the notes themselves (1/4th of the screen minus the \"timer bar\"). As a regular keynote-style speaker (quite minimalistic slides), I find myself wanting to see more notes and less slides.\nThis is certainly very subjective, that's why I didn't want to PR it right away :-/\n\n.

    "bzbarsky": "Looks to me like we end up in a loop in https://play.golang.org/static/jquery-linedtextarea.js in this bit (lines 15-20):\nwhile (linesDiv.height() <= h) {\n            linesDiv.append(\"<div>\" + lineNo + \"</div>\");\n            lineNo++;\n        }\n        return lineNo;\nI just let it spin for a few second and looked at the JS stack, which shows things like:\n2 .domManip(a = <div>58112</div>, c = true, d = [function]) [\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.2/jquery.min.js\":2]\nthat is, lineNo is up to 58112 and increasing pretty quickly; it was at about 54000 a second earlier.\n. OK, so jQuery 1.8.2's .height() does elem.offsetHeight.  That returns 0 in this case, because the element has no CSS box.  Then it tries curCSS which tries to do computed style but doesn't manage to, because the iframe involved is display:none (at a guess; I have not verified this) and https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=548397 is present.  Then it does:\nif ( val < 0 || val == null ) {\n        val = elem.style[ name ];\n    }\nbut of course val == 0, so that block is not entered.  So it ends up returning 0, and the loop never terminates.\nEven if https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=548397 is fixed it's not clear to me that this would terminate, because it's not clear to me whether the div in question actually has any styles specified.  And the obvious fix for https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=548397 would not give the div a CSS box, so if it has no height specified it would end up with something like \"auto\" anyway, and return 0 from height().\n.

Not knocking it, it just has less resources to invest in it, I assume. For example, they don't report the engine.io vulnerable package you're using (see https://snyk.io/test/github/hakimel/reveal.js/).\nIn addition, Snyk (especially with the new GitHub integration) focuses on fixing the issues, not just finding them. It will submit a pull request with the right upgrade each time a new issue is found, and offers patches for many of the issues you can't upgrade away. \nSo, I'm biased, but I suggest you integrate Snyk's GitHub integration instead of (or in addition to) reveal.js.\n.

That would be excellent. Here is an approach that you might want to consider until something like that happens.\nIn your SVG, create a group around your elements and place the fragment class on them.

But @bnjmntn , one of the great things about <q> is that it is semantic; if you don't explicitly set it, it allows the browser to decide which quotes to use. This way quotes may automatically appear as \u201c\u201d for English and \u00ab\u00bb for French.\nRemoving the quotes short-circuits this process. How do I tell the browser to take over again? It looks like a value of initial might work, but that doesn't seem to be supported by Internet Explorer.\nYou see, it's not just an issue of adding back an explicit value --- by default the user agent determines the value, and that's what I want.. The only workaround I've found so far is to change the key bindings for the left and right arrows so they always go to the \"previous\" and \"next\" slides, so that none are inadvertently skipped:\njavascript\nReveal.initialize({\n  keyboard: {\n    37: \"prev\",\n    39: \"next\"\n  }\n});\nBut that's a bit of a hack, and the navigation arrows become a little confusing.

This solved the font and spacing issues for me.\nHowever, it seems that on slide changes equations are not always properly typeset. The equations appear way too small. Reloading that slide triggers a correct typesetting. No clue what the problem is, since the plugin math.js seems to trigger MathJax typeset on slide change events.. I use Reveal for teaching math-heavy courses and found the CommonHTML output of MathJax to be more consistent between browsers and between operating systems than the old HTML output. Since the default output of MathJax is CommonHTML since version 2.7, it would be really cool if Reveal could switch to that.\nHere's the solution that worked for me:\n1) Remove the style reset for .reveal span from reveal.css. I agree that the solution of @NuclearCookie is probably better.\n2) Even then I had problems that with fonts being way too small when I set Reveal's viewDistance to a small value (which I have to for some performance reasons) and then switch to a slide with equations that becomes visible but was not visible at the time of (re)loading the slides. This problem is caused by MathJax trying to adjust its font size in order to match the text's actual, rendered font size. I just disabled the font size adjustment, which also resolved the problem that the same equation on two successive slides might slightly change its size. I had to adjust the MathJax config like this:\nMathJax.Hub.Config({\n    jax: [\"input/TeX\",\"output/CommonHTML\"],\n    \"CommonHTML\": { matchFontHeight: false }\n});\nWith these two adjustments, which could probably be integrated easily, the CommonHTML works like a charme..

Poking around the reveal.js documentation, I found this:\nhttps://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#user-content-presentation-size\nThat indicates that the Reveal.js's too-super-snazzy scale and transform technique can be disabled doing something like so in your Reveal.initialize statement:\nReveal.initialize({\n  width: \"100%\",\n  height: \"100%\",\n  margin: 0,\n  minScale: 1,\n  maxScale: 1\n});\n\nI actually used width and height of 90% which seems to work well.\nThere is one caveat with both solutions. When you do this, you've effectively over-ridden Reveal.js's very well done transformations that make the presentation look great on a variety of devices. From my perspective, this is not too big a deal. When I use that level of interactivity, it's typically an important part of the presentation and it looks great on my computer. It might not look so great on someone's iPhone but I'm willing to sacrifice that. I like this second solution much better because it's just a local change to the presentation file itself so I can leave Reveal.js alone and any presentations that I have that don't need that change aren't affected.. @Organizer21 Yeah, if you're hoping to get it to work well on a table it might be a different story.

I cannot figure out why you put a short JS Code in the hightlight.js file. I think a wrapper around my solution should be a more clean solution. \nFor the CSS Integration the problem seems to be that the Reveal.js loads the style by the id first, so the Highlight.js CSS is overwritten by the Reveal.js CSS. On my perspective it can be interested for users to use a special version of a library, so if you build hightlight.js inside Reveal.js the version is strict fix. If I need for my use-case another version of a dependency I just build this in a dynamic way like my solution. So in general to the flexibility of use-cases my suggestion is to remove the strict dependencies to a more flexible solution, so that I can decide as user of Reveal.js which version I would like to use.

I have created a pull request for this.\n```javascript\nfunction openNotes( notesFilePath ) {\nif( !notesFilePath ) {\n    var jsFileLocation = document.querySelector('script[src$=\"notes.js\"]').src;  // this js file path\n    jsFileLocation = jsFileLocation.replace(/notes\\.js(\\?.*)?$/, '');   // the js folder path\n    notesFilePath = jsFileLocation + 'notes.html';\n}\n\nvar notesPopup = window.open( notesFilePath, 'reveal.js - Notes', 'width=1100,height=700' );\n\nif( !notesPopup ) {\n    alert( 'Speaker view popup failed to open. Please make sure popups are allowed and reopen the speaker view.' );\n    return;\n}\n\n// Allow popup window access to Reveal API\nnotesPopup.Reveal = window.Reveal;\n\n...\n\n```. ",

The README of the project has information on how to manipulate a presentation using the Reveal Javascript API. You can combine that with any library that manipulates the DOM, and wango-bango instant dynamic Reveal.js presentation.. This is way outside the scope of the core reveal.js library. Regardless, it is very likely impossible. Microsoft PowerPoint is proprietary, and PowerPoint slides aren't created using a standardized object format that we could export to.\nIf you're using the external markdown slides method however, you could save a copy of your slides.md file as slides.txt, and then open PowerPoint, choose to open a new file, and change the file type selector to \"All Outlines\", and load the slides.txt file.\nThis of course would lose all styles and animations, and the data-separators and style applicators wouldn't translate into speaker notes, so you'd have a lot of work to do.\nTL;DR: PowerPoint slides can only be created or edited using PowerPoint, and PowerPoint doesn't use html, css & javascript (Reveal's rendering engine) for slide rendering..

The correct piece of code is this one.\nI understand why one wouldn't want to load iframes until they're in view if they contain media, but in that case why are iframes pre-loaded if they're not in a fragment? The thing I'm confused about is why fragments are a special case. I'd think you wouldn't want media iframes loading on non-visible slides either, but they do as per the viewDistance config.\nI'm happy to contribute this feature either way.. > Lazy loaded data-src iframes aren't preloaded according to viewDistance. They load when their containing slide becomes visible and unload again when it's hidden.\nHm, that sounds like an update to the readme is in order as well.\n\nMaybe we can add a  attribute that flags that the given iframe should be loaded according to viewDistance?\n\nI'll put up a quick PR for that and the doc updates..
