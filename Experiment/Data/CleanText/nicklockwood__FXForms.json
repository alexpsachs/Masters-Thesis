    "nicklockwood": "Makes sense - I'll add that.\n. OK, this is fixed in beta 5.\n. can you paste the form properties you are using? I'll try to reproduce it.\n. Fixed in beta 5.\n. Was there a specific feature you'd like to see demoed?\n. The simplest way is:\nSet the base class of your custom view controller to be FXFormViewController instead of UIViewController.\nIn the storyboard, you should now be able to bind your tableView to the tableView outlet of your custom view controller.\nFinally, in the viewDidLoad or awakeFromNib method of your view controller, set self.formController.form = [your form]\nYou may need to call [self.tableView reloadData] after setting the form property.\n. Ah yes, sorry I missed this part when I skimmed the code:\nif (self.valueTransformer) {\n    return [self.valueTransformer transformedValue:[self.value fieldDescription]];\n}\n. That's exactly what it does. \n. Yeah, I thought it was better to localise the title-cased version because that follows the convention of using the human-readable english text as the key in the strings file.\n. In this case you'd just write \"options\": [NSLocalizedString(\"option1\", nil), NSLocalizedString(\"option2, nil)\"]\n. If that's in a JSON file, I guess you'd probably just make the JSON into a localised resource and have a different JSON for each locale.\n. You could use a value transformer to convert the unlocalized version to the localized one fir display purposes, then the value would be unaffected.\n. Yep, this is planned for the next release.\n. No, but I'll probably put a beta out quite soon.\n. It's probably simplest if I just do this. It won't be too long.\n. OK, this is implemented.\n. A PR would be great, thanks!\n. This is now merged.\n. @Ashton-W that makes sense. I'm considering adding a phone number type, but I think this might be better implemented as part of some kind of generic string formatting system.\n. OK, I think this is addressed by the new phone number field. Let me know if not.\n. Yes, you can do this by subclassing FXFormViewController, then in the viewDidAppear, do this:\n```\n- (void)viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated\n{\n    [super viewDidAppear:animated];\n//get first field\nid <FXFormFieldCell> cell = (id <FXFormFieldCell>)[self.tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:[NSIndexPath indexPathForRow:0 inSection:0]];\n\n//select field (assuming it's a text field\nif ([cell respondsToSelector:@selector(textField)])\n{\n    [((FXFormTextFieldCell *)cell).textField becomeFirstResponder];\n}\n\n}\n```\n. How very strange. That's exactly the approach I would have recommended, but it seems that for some reason, UITextField is not KVC-compliant for that key. I'll see if I can work out why.\n. I've put in a temporary fix in 1.0.2 that treats UITextInputTraits as a special case. I'll try to come up with something better for 1.1.\n. Thanks for yet another great PR :-)\nI've decided that int the interests of avoiding duplication, as much as possible the FXFormFieldType should relate only to the data type, not the way in which it is displayed.\nI think that in this case it would be sufficient simply to define the FXFormOptionPickerCell, and then specify that the field should use this cell class using the FXFormFieldCell property.\nIf you'd like to make that change, I'll merge this PR. Otherwise, I can make the change myself if you prefer.\n. Oops, sorry. I merged the PRs in the wrong order, and now can't merge this. If you wouldn't mind fixing the conflicts, I'll merge yours next.\n. The problem is that the type of Cell I'm using for buttons is\nUITableViewCellStyleValue1,     // Left aligned label on left and right aligned label on right with blue text (Used in Settings)\nAs far as I can tell, there's no way to center the text on this type of cell. I'm going to see if I can provide a way to fix this without subclassing FXFormBaseCell, however, if you are willing to subclass FXFormBaseCell you can just do this:\n```\n@interface MyFormButtonCell : FXFormBaseCell\n@end\n@implementation MyFormButtonCell\n\n(id)init\n{\n    return [self initWithStyle:UITableViewCellStyleDefault reuseIdentifier:nil];\n}\n\n@end \n```\nThen if your field description, pass\n{\n    FXFormFieldCell: [MyFormButtonCell class]\n    @\"textLabel.textAlignment\": @(NSTextAlignmentCenter)\n}\nAnd it should work\n. I've added an FXFormFieldPlaceholder value that can be used in the same way as this.\nIf there's anything that FXFormFieldNilOption does that FXFormFieldPlaceholder doesn't, let me know, otherwise I think we can close this.\n. Hmm, ok. I'm not crazy about the idea of having both, but I'll keep thinking about it.\n. It's partly the name and partly the extra complexity. I'm hoping the same requirement can be solved another way, e.g. by using NSNull values or something, but i'm drawing a blank right now.\n. Yes, exactly. The valueTransformer feature added in 1.1 would let you format the NSNull however you want, but it's certainly not as elegant as the solution you've suggested from an end-user implementation point of view, especially if all the other values don't need transforming.\n. I've expanded the capabilities of the FXFormFieldPlaceholder to include the additional behaviour that the FXFormFieldNilOption had. I think this is a reasonable approach. Let me know if this solves your requirement.\n. Yeah, I know exactly what you mean, and I had the same thought.\nBut the problem with having two different properties is that they also overlap; for example, should a placeholder image in the FXFormImageCell be a nilOption or a placeholder value?\nI think perhaps the mistake here is that I use the placeholder for the detail label value in fields that have a disclosure arrow - maybe I just shouldn't do that.\nFortunately, it's fairly easy to override that, so I think I can live with it for now.\nThanks for your work on this, and the thoughtful feedback. I'm sorry I didn't merge your PR, but hopefully you don't feel the effort was wasted.\nI'll close this ticket now, but feel free to reopen it if you think of anything else.\n. Looks good, thanks.\n. If you change a form field value, you just need to call reloadData on the tableView, or reloadRowAtIndexPath if you just want to reload that cell.\nIf your change affects the field layout, you need to call the formController.form setter first, and then call reloadData on the tableView.\nI appreciate that this is a bit clunky - if you have a better suggestion, I'd love to hear it.\n. Ah, I see. The problem is that it would be a violation of MVC principles to have the form update the view directly.\nThe best way to handle this is either to set up a KVO observer for your form fields from the view controller, or have your form broadcast an NSNotification whenever it changes a field, which could then be observed by the view controller. \n. cool - remember to remove the observer again in your dealloc ;-)\n. It's listed here: https://github.com/nicklockwood/FXForms/blob/master/FXForms/FXForms.h\nDo you have an old copy of FXForms? Note that the CocoaPods version is only at v 1.0.2 and this feature was added in 1.1 beta 4.\n. You don't have to, you can just point your pod file directly at the github repo if you want to use the latest build.\n. I don't have any particularly elegant solution to these types of problem right now, but it should be possible to implement as follows:\nFor any control that modifies the forms fields, you can either 1) add an action to the field that will be called on the view controller and tell it to reload the form, or a subset of the form (the action can be either a block or a selector to call on the view controller), or 2) add a KVO observer on the form itself that does the same.\nThe fields method of the form is called whenever the formController.forms property is set, so as an example, your switch action could do this:\n```\n- (void)allDaySwitchAction\n{\n    //reload form fields\n    self.formController.form = self.formController.form;\n//reload table\n[self.formController.tableView reloadData];\n\n}\n```\nThen, in the fields method of your form, return a different configuration depending on the value of the allDay property.\nIf you can think of a better way to do this, please let me know.\n. Probably a silly question, but have you checked that your callback is firing on the main thread?\n. This is exactly the scenario that I added the new FXFormFieldViewController property for in the 1.1 beta. This feature is not completely finished yet, but if you don't mind being a guinea pig, here's how it works :-)\nInstead of a property called cityViewController of type UIViewController, as you have now, make a property called city or type string (presumably it's a string) on your form model. Modify your cityViewController to implement the FXFormFieldViewController protocol, which basically just means adding a field property to it.\nNow, in the config dictionary for your city property, return this:\n@{ FXFormFieldKey : @\"city\", FXFormFieldViewController : @\"CityViewController\" },\nThat will tell FXForms that the city property should not be displayed as a textfield, but should instead display your custom view controller and pass it the field object. Your view controller can then set the field.value directly, which will set the city property on the original form.\nHope that makes sense.\n. Yes the FXFormFieldViewController value should be the class name of your view controller, not the name of a key on the form.\nYou no longer need to haves the searchCityViewController property on your form itself - using the FXFormFieldViewController on the selectedCity property replaces having the view controller be a property in its own right.\n. Hmm, ok we'll that looks correct to me, so it may be a bug. I'll take a look.\n. I've pushed an update that should fix your issues. I've included an example project that demonstrates using a custom controller for a field.\n. Your view controller has to conform to the <FXFormFieldViewController) protocol, so yes, the field has to be called field. Either redeclaring the field property in your form controller header or adding a manual synthesize is sufficient (you don't have to do both).\n. As Broich says, this is the standard behaviour for table views. \nWhilst it would theoretically be possible for me to override it, part of the point of creating your own form viewcontroller is so that you can deviate the FXFormViewController's behaviours, not have them imposed on you anyway.\nFWIW, if you look at the the FXFormViewController's source, you can see how I handle this there (I use [tableView selectRowAtIndexPath:nil animated:YES] on viewDidAppear IIRC)\n. You're right, the documentation could be clearer on that point. I think the behaviour is probably correct as is, but I'll leave this open until I've amended the docs.\n. I've updated the documentation to make this clearer\n. I'm not able to reproduce this either.\n. I think the best option in this case is to create the field conditionally, based on whether mail accounts are available (i.e. in the fields method, make that property conditional) or make the field for that controller be a button that displays the controller using its action method instead of being a property of type MFMailComposeViewController.\n. I wonder if a phone pad is the correct input for a phone number in practice. I think the phone pad is probably just suited for dialling interfaces rather than phone number input. Maybe it should be the alphanumeric keyboard instead?\n. Huh, so it is. Fair enough then.\n. You read it right; this was a bug introduced in 1.1. Fixed in 1.1.1.\n. That is true. It's by design, but I can see that it's probably not what you want in this case.\nIf you want to trigger an action when the value is set, you can do this by overriding the setter method for that value in your form.\nI'll think about whether there's a better way to implement this.\n. I made a few changes to the interface and extended to support controllers too, but this is now merged.\n. Your solution for 1) will work, although you can actually just call becomeFirstResponder directly on the cell and it will call becomeFirstResponder on the textField for you.\nI'm not sure what you mean by default text value. If you mean placeholder text, then use the FXFormFieldPlaceholder value. If you mean you actually want the form to set the text to a default value if the string is nil, you can do this in your form object with a \"lazy getter\" for the field value, e.g.\n```\n@implementation MyForm\n\n(NSString *)myField\n{\n    if (_myField == nil)\n    {\n        return @\"default value\";\n    }\n    return _myField;\n}\n\n@end\n```\n. You can set it with the @\"detailTextLabel.font\" keypath.\n. Hmm. It's hard to be certain, but I think the issue may be that the form object itself is an NSNull instance as opposed to the state property being nil.\nFXForms handles nil pointers just fine (in accordance with standard objective C practice), but It may well not cope with receiving an NSNull in place of a form.\nCan you investigate further and find out if this is the case? And if so, is this expected behaviour for CoreData (in which case FXForms should probably handle it gracefully) or the symptom of a bug in your app?\n. I can't see anything obvious that's wrong with it. Can you send me your project and I'll investigate?\nYou can email it to support at charcoaldesign dot co dot uk.\n. The problem seems to be that When FXForms encounters a nil form object, it instantiates it using alloc/init, which is not the correct way to create an NSManagedObject subclass.\nI'll see if I can find a better approach for this. It would be relatively easy to make a special case for Core Data objects, but it might be better to have a more flexible solution.\n. That might be easier for your case, although you'd have to override valueForUndefinedKey: and setValue:forUndefinedKey: on your form wrapper and pass those values to your core data model property.\nFXForms doesn't have any concept of edit mode at the moment - it's assumed that fields will always be in edit mode. Creating new objects is implicit (if you click on a nil field in your form, it will create a new object for it), which is why you're having the issue with null core data entities being initialised with the wrong constructor.\n. If you can explain how you'd like your form interface to work, I can use this as the basis for defining new functionality. Lack of real-world use cases (aka dogfooding) is always a problem when designing features for a library.\n. I've made an update that prevents FXForms trying to instantiate NSManagedObjects if they are null, which should hopefully fix the crashing.\nThe scenario you've described should work fine if you use a custom form controller and detect if the field value is nil, then show a new or edit button accordingly.\nLet me know if you run into any more problems (or if the original problem has not been solved).\n. Action methods only propagate up the responder chain, so if the delegate isn't a super view or parent controller of the form view controller it won't work.\nIt might be simpler in this case to use a block for your action instead of a selector.\n. The : in the selector is optional, just as it is with IBActions. But if you include the : in the selector, you have to include a parameter in your method as well. If you don't need the sender, you don't need the colon.\n. If you're using an action block to load a view controller, you'll need some way to get a reference to the controller from within your form, which is likely to be kind of horrible from a structural point of view.\nProbably your best bet is to post an NSNotification in your form that is observed by your view controller and triggers the action.\n. Yes, you need an FXFormFieldKey for virtual fields, otherwise valueForKey:/setValue:forKey: won't be called on your form object, and there will be no way to get/set the value.\nIf the field doesn't have a value (e.g. if it's a button or a custom cell with hard-coded content) then you don't need a key.\n. If you look in the BasicExample project there is a Submit button that shows how this is done.\n. Yes, just create a custom cell class containing a button, and use that with the FXForFieldCell property.\n. You can implement the button action as follows:\n- (void)buttonAction:(id)sender\n{\n    if (self.field.action) self.field.action(self);\n}\nThis will then call the standard action selector or block for your field, so you can implement the button action in the same way as shown in the BasicExample project.\n. BTW, If you've added this cell inside FXForms, I suggest you define it in a separate class inside your own project. Instead of overloading the private setUp method, you can just use the normal init method for UITableViewCell, like this:\n- (id)initWithStyle:(UITableViewCellStyle)style reuseIdentifier:(NSString *)reuseIdentifier\n{\n    if ((self = [super initWithStyle:style reuseIdentifier:reuseIdentifier]))\n    {\n        //do your setup\n    }\n    return self;\n}\n. FYI, I've added an example for how to do this to the examples folder. My example uses a nib, but you can do it with code if you prefer.\n. That should work fine. I think you must have inadvertently changed the name of the method or the selector string (if that's a direct copy of the error you got, it looks like the colon is missing from the end of the selector name in the form field configuration).\n. In answer to your first question, about customising buttons, if you make the button a property of your cell, you can customise its properties using keypaths, the same way you can set the textLabel properties, etc.\n. It's not standard behaviour for cells to deselect themselves. I was attempting to follow the standard iOS pattern.\n. Dd you try adding @\"textField.keyboardType\": @(UIKeyboardTypeDecimalPad) to your field dictionary?\n. UITextView doesn't implement any placeholder functionality. I'll have to build something custom. I'll add this to the list for v1.2.\n. I've added this in 1.1.4.\n. The return value of the fields / extraFields method can vary at runtime. You could have an isNewInstance (or whatever) property on the form that toggles the inclusion of the delete button in the fields array.\n. If you come up with a better approach, or you can think of a way you'd like it to work, let me know.\nSomething I'm considering for a future update is to allow fields to be customised via the FXFormControllerDelegate, rather than  methods on the form. Would that work better for you?\n. Yes, I'm aware of this issue. It's on the todo list.\n. 1. No, not currently. I'm investigating a solution for this for the next release.\n2. I'm not 100% sure this is possible. You would need to create a cell subclass that can display a custom data type that encapsulates both the image and text, and register that cell as the default for FXFormFieldTypeOption, but I can't guarantee that you won't need to make additional changes to the library to make this work. I'll investigate.\n. if you implement the methods -valueForUndefinedKey: and -setValue:forUndefinedKey: on your form object, you can use these to set and get the values from your database. \n. The setValue:forUndefinedKey: will automatically be called on your form object with the value of the text field when the textfield resigns first responder. If the user presses submit while the keyboard is still visible, the value may not have been updated yet, so it's a good idea to dismiss the keyboard in your submit button action before saving the data in your database.\n. FXFormTextFieldCell adjusts the textfield frame in layoutSubviews, so it's probably positioning the left-hand edge back underneath your image.\nTry this:\n- (void)layoutSubviews\n{\n    [super layoutSubviews]\n    self.textField.frame = CGRectMake(58, 10, 254, 30);\n}\nIn general though, this is a bit fragile because it makes assumptions about how FXFormTextFieldCell works that may change in future. It would probably be better if I called the setUp method from within awakeFromNib so that you don't have to create it yourself.\nI'll look at changing that in the next version.\n. For now, it might be easier to subclass FXFormBaseCell instead, and copy the FXFormTextFieldCell implementation into your own class. I'll look at a way to make this easier in the next release.\n. Mean you give an example? It should be possible to implement the text field cell using only public properties of FXFormField and FXFormBaseCell.\n. Oh, I see. Yeah, you can't copy it exactly, but you can just put in hard-coded values for those - the functions are only because I need to support multiple OS-version targets without warnings.\n. This is now possible. Also, see the note in the README about the distinction between FXFormBaseCell and FXFormDefaultCell.\n. It's probably a stupid question, but are you sure the address value of your form isn't nil?\n. Ah, yeah. Sorry, didn't think of that explanation. I should probably make it resign responder automatically when you press a button.\n. I don't think there's any way to do this other than manually resigning the responder.\n. It should be possible to do this with a custom action method or cell.\n. You can call [navigationController popViewControllerAnimated:] - would that work?\n. Yeah, I think you'd have to do it like that, which I guess is a little awkward. Let me think about this a bit more.\n. This should be fixed now in 1.1.4\n. This should be fixed now in 1.1.4\n. This isn't a bug, but I can see why it's confusing.\nThe values returned by the form has nothing to do with the enum, it's just the index of the option you select. Enums have no runtime representation - they're just a convenient way of representing constants, but there's no way for FXForms to know what values you've used.\nIf you want non-zero-based, non-sequential option values, you can specify that actual numbers as your FXFormFieldOptions and then use a valueTransformer to convert them to strings, like this:\n{FXFormFieldOptions: @[@(GenderMale), @(GenderFemale), @(GenderOther)],\n FXFormFieldValueTransformer: ^(id input) {\n        return @{@(GenderMale): @\"Male\",\n                       @(GenderFemale): @\"Female\",\n                       @(GenderOther): @\"Other\"}[input];\n }};\n. Nothing yet, as there are a few other issues to tackle first. If you have any suggestions though, I'd be interested to hear them.\nIt seems like I should probably try to tie into the KVC model validation mechanism used by Core Data, but it's not an area I'm very familiar with.\n. This is something I'm planning for the next version, but I haven't started work on it yet.\nThe idea would be that you'd have an FXFormFieldTemplate attribute that would describe the properties of each field, and then the field would be represented as a section with the ability to add/remove and reorder items.\n. Now implemented in 1.2 beta 2\n. I've been considering ways to make this easier, but in the meantime I'll add an example of how to do this when I get a chance.\n. @mrs1987 no, you don't need to do that. You just need to return different options in your fields array based on the current values of the form, and reload the form whenever a value changes that would affect the fields structure.\nIf your options are dynamic, it probably doesn't make sense to use an enum for the values - just use an integer, or the actual option value type (e.g NSString).\n. @mrs1987 Looking at your specific problem, I think here's how you should solve it:\nIn your form object:\n```\n@implementation ProductSelectionForm\n\n\n(NSDictionary *)productList\n{\n    return @{FXFormFieldOptions: @[@\"Juice\", @\"Water\", @\"Coffee\"],\n             FXFormFieldAction: @\"productListChanged\"};\n}\n\n\n(NSDictionary )productOptionsField\n{\n    NSMutableDictionary details = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];\n    details[FXFormFieldOptions] = @[@\"Option1\", @\"Option2\", @\"Option3\"];\n    if (self.productList == Coffee)\n    {\n        //only allow single-selection\n        return @{FXFormFieldType: FXFormFieldTypeInteger}\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        //allow multi-selection\n        return @{FXFormFieldType: FXFormFieldTypeBitfield}\n    }\n    return details;\n}  \n\n\n@end\n```\nAnd in your view controller:\n```\n@implementation ProductSelectionFormViewController\n\n(void)productListChanged\n{\n    self.formController.form = self.productSelectionForm;\n    [self.tableView reloadData];\n}\n\n@end\n```\nHope that makes sense.\nNote, this will only work if you have 3 options in your productOptions field (as you do in your example). If you have 4 options, option 4 would have an enum value of 4 when it's in bitfield mode and 3 when it's in single-selection mode so it wouldn't quite work unless a different approach is used.\n. I've included a dependent fields example in the latest release, including a couple of fixes that are required to make it work as expected.\n. It might be better to add an action to the limitStorageSize field instead of reloading the table from within the setter.\nI'm not sure what's causing the crash, but the use of manual retain/release means it could be a lot of subtle things.\n. This is controlled by the value set in the form object. It should be working, but if not let me know.\n. You'd have a property called \"province\" on your form object that is an NSString, and if you set its value to \"B\" then option \"B\" in the picker should automatically be selected when the form is displayed.\n. If you mean helper text, you can use the FXFormFieldPlaceholder value. If you mean an actual default value, just set the default values in the init method of your form object, as you would for any ordinary object.\n. Try this instead:\n@\"detailTextLabel.font\": kFontNormal(14)};\n. Yes, this is actually the documented approach for customising cells.\n. Looks very cool! It will take a little while to review though I'm afraid :-)\n. Yeah, I did intend FXFormFieldTemplate to work a bit differently, but I'll see if your approach makes more sense.\n. Sorry for the much overdue response to this. I've now added basic support for templates collection fields. There is no doubt a lot more to do (e.g. setting maximum item count), but hopefully this meets at least some of your requirements.\nI'm sorry that I didn't end up using your approach in the end, but hopefully you'll agree that the template system I've used is quite flexible and intuitive.\nIf there's anything urgent missing from this solution, let me know. I would also certainly be interested in incorporating any additional functionality you developed, such as the key/value cell. \n. Sorry for not responding sooner - I didn't think there was much point adding Travis until I'd actually written some tests.\nI've now added Travis support, including some tests!\n. Hmm\u2026 the lack of support for negative numbers does seem like a bit of a dealbreaker.\n. You can style almost any property of the cell by adding properties with the correct keypath in your field configuration dictionary. Eg. to change the font of the cell title, use\n@\"textLabel.font\"\nas the key.\n. I just tried it and the only leak I saw was 64KB leaked by the UIImagePickerController (which seems to be an Apple bug).\n. OK, I've taken a look. It's not actually a retain cycle. The problems seems to be that UITableView caches all created cells up to a certain maximum, so because I'm not recycling them the tableview is storing a large pool of useless objects.\nThis isn't a permanent leak. If you dismiss the view controller then the memory is reclaimed, and if you reload the tableview enough times, eventually it will start releasing cells once it reaches its internal cache limit.\nIt's not ideal though. I'll look at a better strategy in the next update that lets it recycle the cells. It occurs to me that using the field key as the identifier might work, although it may cause problems for forms that modify fields dynamically.\n. Indeed. I don't really want to add the cognitive load of an extra key though. I suppose I could make the key field mandatory, or create a hash for each field based on all the properties of the field dictionary.\n. Maybe something like key ?: title + cellClass is sufficient. It's hard to be certain how people are using them.\n. Why did you close the ticket? Found a workaround?\n. I've implemented a hybrid between your two solutions. Thanks!\n. You need to reassign the formController.form and then reload the tableView in order to update a field.\n. It's working for me in the BasicExample project. Can you clarify what you mean by showing an incorrect value?\n(Note: it was broken in an earlier release, so make sure you're using 1.1.6 or later).\n. Yes. The valueTransformer property is usually only needed if the bitmask values aren't sequential.\n. I've added this in the latest beta\n. There is now a \"phone\" field type that uses the phone pad.\n. You can add a custom action block or selector to the last field in the form.\n. This should now be fixed.\n. Sorry for the delay - just waiting until I get a chunk of time to review this and start work on the next big update.\n. I think this is an issue with UITextField in general, rather than a problem with FXForms.\n. In that case, I guess you can fix it by left-aligning the textfield, which you can do by adding the following to your field dictionary:\n- (NSDictionary *)myField {\n    return @{@\"textField.textAlignment\", @(NSTextAlignmentLeft)};\n}\n. Currently there's no way to enforce this other than to check when the form is submitted and display an alert telling the user to select fewer options. \n. Ah, good point.\n. I've added support for reverse transforms in the latest beta.\n. I'm OK with this idea, but there are a few problems with the implementation that's stopping me from merging it as it stands:\n1) It should be optional - the way this is implemented means that all form fields will get this feature. No Apple forms actually use this toolbar approach - it's used exclusively in web-based forms in Safari, so really it's kind of nonstandard, which means it's not something I would want to force on everyone.\nI need to think of a good way to expose an option to enabled/disable this feature. I don't currently have a mechanism for this kind of from-wide configuration, and I want to add it in a way that will scale for other features\n2) This PR declares a couple of private Apple UI constants, for reasons that aren't entirely clear to me. This seems fragile and possibly risks rejection if that gets flagged as private API usage.\n. This is implemented as of beta 10.\n. You can supply your own UIViewController class using the FXFormFieldViewController key. If you create a subclass of FXFormViewController and set its title in the viewDidLoad method, then supply that class as the FXFormFieldViewController for your field, it should work.\n. I agree, it's not very convenient.\nNow that I think about it, an easier approach would  be to use the FXFormFieldTitle key to specify your view controller's title, and then override the title displayed in the cell using \"textLabel.text\".\n. It depends what you mean by \"change\".\nIf you want to push another form onto the navigation controller, you can just push that as you would with any normal view controller.\nIf you want to load a different form in the sane controller, just set your new form object on your formController, then call reloadData on the tableView.\n. This is expected behaviour (it's how any ordinary textfield/button would work in iOS).\nYou can fix it by resigning the first responder in your button action.\nI can make it so that the responder is resigned automatically when you press a button cell in the form, and perhaps I should, but I'm concerned that would just be masking the issue - for example, if you pressed a button outside of the form, you'd still have the same issue.\nAnother option would be to update the form values live as you edit, but the problem with that is that the field action would either have to be called after every key press, or you might have a situation where the value changes but the action is never called.\nThoughts?\n. That isn't necessary - you can resign the first responder just by calling [tableView endEditing:YES];\n. This is fixed in beta 3\n. Yes, you can add and remove or modify fields dynamically. Have a look at the dependent fields example for how to do this.\n. To make the value appear, you need to ensure that the value in the dynamic form dictionary is an NSNumber with value of zero, not nil.\n. They would have been, but unfortunately, neither of those pads support negative numbers.\n. I was considering adding FXFormTypeUnsignedInteger and doing that. That also has the benefit that I can detect that type automatically from the property.\n. I've added a FXFormFieldTypeUnsigned type that uses a number pad by default. This type will automatically be used for properties of type NSUInteger, or equivalent.\n. I like this idea a lot, but it seems very hard to generalise (i.e. to make it work without dictating the field keys or types for the form).\nThe problem with using a dictionary is that its unordered, which makes it hard to use with templates fields (I currently only support ordered collections for this reason).\nOne option would be to introduce a concrete FXForm class called something like FXKeyValueForm that contains hard-coded key and value fields of the correct type and is designed to work with the FXFormKeyValueCell.\nAnother option would be to make FXKeyValueForm a protocol, but then the developer would have to do quite a lot of work to set up such a form (perhaps it should be both a protocol AND a class, to provide maximum flexibility and minimum effort).\n. The form always knows (or guesses) the class of the collection values based on the FXFormFieldClass key in the template, so that shouldn't be a problem. Instantiating the value automatically is still a problem though, without having an equivalent to your newInstanceFor.\n. Sorry this is taking a while to fix. It turns out that handling nil values in a templates form is incredibly complicated, given that nil may actually be a legitimate value (e.g. if the field is multiple choice with a placeholder value).\nI think your approach of having the form instantiate and cleanup objects makes sense, but I'm going to tackle making nil values work correctly first.\n. OK, I believe I've fixed all the crashes.\n. Actually I was already thinking along the same lines. If the FXFormControllerDelegate protocol replicated the methods available on the FXForm protocol then it would be possible to use existing objects as form models without having to subclass them.\n. This is fixed in latest beta.\n. If you just leave the view controller in our storyboard empty, and set up the code for the controller the same way as it is done in the basic example, you shouldn't have to do anything else.\n. (That's assuming you set the superclass of your view controller to be FXFormViewController, as it is in the example)\n. I'll see if I can rustle up an example tomorrow.\n. OK, I've added a storyboard example, and also included some new features to make using storyboards easier, such as support for UIStoryboardSegues\n. Despite the reference to arm64 in the error, FXForms works fine on arm64 when using Objective-C, so I think it's unlikely that the architecture has anything to do with it. Hopefully just a beta bug in the Swift compiler, but I'll look into it.\nAs a side-note, it's nice to see FXForms still works well in Swift - I wasn't sure if the automatic property introspection would function correctly, since Swift doesn't have the same kind of runtime support - but I guess as long as you are subclassing NSObject for your form objects then declared properties are still inspectable?\n. Try importing the FXForms.h/m files into your project directly. They don't have any dependencies or unusual compiler requirements.\n. Yep, I like that idea.\n. That's odd - I thought I fixed this in the latest beta.\n. If you are using CocoaPods, try linking directly against the podspec in this repo instead of using the public spec. I've added quite a lot of stuff in the 1.2 beta that isn't in the most recent stable release. \n. Problem 1 is a design issue. If you have an index-based options field, and you select an option that isn't in the list (\"None\") then the index is set to NSNotFound (2147483648). Arguably it should be nil if the type is NSNumber and not NSInteger, but for consistency it currently uses NSNotFound for both.\nProblem 2 is not a bug. The default value of NSNumber is nil, which is treated as \"no value\". The default value of an NSInteger is 0, so it matches index zero in the list (the first item). You have to set it to NSNotFound in your init method if you want no item to be selected.\nProblem 3 sounds like a genuine bug. I'll take a look.\n. OK, in the latest update, options values of type NSNumber should be nil if the value is out of range (it will still be NSNotFound for NSInteger fields). That should fix Problem 1.\nI couldn't reproduce the crash mentioned in Problem 2, let me know if you're still seeing that. Option types of NSInteger will still default to option 1 though, as that's by design.\nI couldn't reproduce the bug in Problem 3, perhaps that was fixed by one of the other changes?\n. Sorry, the NSUnknownKeyException was an unrelated bug introduced in the last update, now fixed.\nStill can't see Problem 3 though - can you paste in the complete source for your form object (or whatever subset is needed to reproduce this problem)?\n. OK, I figured out what the problem with #3 was. Fixed in latest beta.\n. Sorry, that was an incomplete refactoring job on my part. Your fix is valid for the old way indexing was handled, but the new way avoids a lot of code duplication. Now fixed.\n. Whoops, sorry about that. Fixed.\n. Actually that's not quite right. You set the default value by just setting the property in your form object (e.g in init). Otherwise all values default to nil, which will display the placeholder if there is one.\n. I don't understand what you mean by that. There is no such thing as an \"enum type\" - at runtime an enum is just an integer.\n. @kbala assuming you are using the approach from the dynamic fields example, to set default values in your JSON, add a dictionary of default values by key and use it to populate the valuesByKey dictionary.\nI'm investigating whether there is a more convenient approach that can be used.\n. @batkru Ah, I understand the confusion. There was a bug causing the gender field to show up as a text field instead of a selection box. This is now fixed.\n@kbala I've now added an option called FXFormDefaultValue that can be used to set the default value in the field dictionary. This should make it simpler for you to set defaults for dynamic forms using JSON.\n. That's because the field type is NSDate, and FXForms doesn't convert a default value of type NSString to NSDate (it couldn't really do this, since there is more than one way to represent a date as a string).\nYou'll have to parse the default value to an NSDate yourself before passing the dictionary to FXForms.\n. I'm planning to at some point. For now you can set the field type to @\"label\" to make it read only.\n. This is a peculiar edge case, caused by the fact that \"class\" is a standard method of NSObject.\nEither use a different key, or change:\n- (id)valueForUndefinedKey:(NSString *)key\n{\n    return self.valuesByKey[key];\n}\nTo\n- (id)valueForKey:(NSString *)key\n{\n    return self.valuesByKey[key];\n}\nWhich, seems to work OK, although it may have some weird side effects later that I haven't thought of.\n. Good point - I'll look into that.\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. How are you setting them? By directly manipulating the cell.textField.text property?\n. OK, I've fixed it.\n. Glad you've found it useful :-)\n. If your form is just an ordinary class, you can set the properties directly. After setting properties, call reloadData on the tableView to refresh the table.\nIf you are using a dynamic form, use setValue:forKey: as you suggested, but remember to reload the tableView afterwards.\n. Sorry, I must have misunderstood what you are trying to do. If you want to set the default value, you can just use the FXFormFieldDefaultValue key.\n. Can you try again with the latest beta? When I paste that exact fields method into the DynamicForms example form it works fine.\n. There's a FXFormFieldDefaultValue you can use, or just set the value in the form object itself.\n. No, you should do it like this:\nreturn @{FXFormFieldKey: @\"yourEmail\", FXFormFieldDefaultValue: userEmail}\nSetting the the textField.text value directly won't store the value in the form, so if the user doesn't modify it, the value might not be saved and could be left as nil.\n. Setting the textField.text value is the wrong way to do that anyway (see my comment in the other thread), but in any case, the easiest way to do this is simply to set the form values directly:\nYourAccountForm *form = [[YourAccountForm alloc] init];\n[form setValue:someDefaultValue forKey:@\"someKey\"];\n...\n//then assign the form to the controller\ncontroller.formController.form = form;\n. Your form either needs to have properties matching the keys you are trying to set, or your need to set it up as a dynamic form by following the implementation design used in the DynamicForm example.\n. No problem.\n. Thanks. Fixed in b9.\n. Thanks. Fixed.\n. There's no way to do this right now except by creating a custom cell class and registering it as the cell to be used by FXFormFieldTypeOption. \nThe options lists just use regular UITableViewCells, which don't support multi-line labels.\n. The only reason that I haven't done so is that I can't currently see a use case for it. Generally you are interested in either displaying the option (for which you can use optionDescriptionAtIndex) or finding out the actual selected value of the field, for which you can use field.value.\nI can see that if the field values were something like colors, it would be useful to be able to display these using custom cells that displayed the actual color. I think that currently, implementing that would involve more than just having access to the field option value though - you'd also need some way to specify that you wanted to use a different cell type for that option, and then make the underlying options field available to the cell, which currently just sees the options as boolean values on the FXOptionsForm.\nSo basically I'd need to re-architect the way options fields are handled in order for the option value to be useful. If you have any suggestions for how that might work, I'd be interested.\n. But where would you call that method from in your code? The option cell doesn't have access to the original form field - it uses a proxy field. You can get to the original field from the proxy, but only by calling private methods.\n. Ah, so you're building a custom controller for selecting the field? Now I understand.\n. OK, I've exposed this method.\n. You can register a custom cell class to use for fields of type FXFormFieldTypeOption using the registerViewControllerClass:forFieldType: method of FXFormController, and then handle the display of the title value differently. I'm not sure if that would meet your requirements.\n. Ha ha, my time isn't that valuable ;-)\n. Why does this cause a retain cycle? The form doesn't have a reference its fields.\n. Yes, if the cellPhone property is an array, set the array value directly, e.g.\n[form setValue:@[@\"Nokia Lumia\", @\"Galaxy Nexus\", @\"iPhone 5s\"] forKey:@\"cellPhone\"];\n. Sorry, I think I misunderstood the question.\nWhat is it that you are trying to do? set the FXFormFieldOptions for the form field in the view controller instead of the form object?\nWhy don't you want to set them in the form object?\n. Why not just return a different value from the FXFormFieldOptions in the form object based on the result from your web API? Why does it need to be set in controller?\n. You can set it in the controller, but the property itself should belong to the form. E.g. you could do something like this:\n```\n@interface MyForm \n@property (nonatomic, copy) NSString resortName;\n@property (nonatomic, copy) NSArray resortOptions;\n@end\n@implementation MyForm \n\n\n(NSDictionary *)resortNameField\n{\n    return @{FXFormFieldOptions: resortOptions ?: @[]}\n}\n\n\n(NSArray *)excludedFields\n{\n    return @\"resortOptions\";\n}\n\n\n@end\n```\nThat will let you set the resortOptions from your controller, like this:\nself.form.resortOptions = //downloaded resorts array\nself.formController.form = self.form;\n[self.tableView reloadData];\n. Yes, fixed in latest FXForms beta.\n. Use :head as the version in your podfile.\n. Currently there's no simple solution for this. The best approach is probably to create two proxy form objects that talk to the underlying NSManagedObject in the same way that the DynamicFieldsExample form talks to a dictionary.\n. The plan is to make field customisation available via the delegate, rather than having to add methods to the form object itself. I'm not sure when I'll get round to that though.\n. I'll update the pod when 1.2 is out of beta. CocoaPods doesn't currently have a way to submit pods for beta versions.\n. Your best bet is just to create a normal numeric field (e.g. using FXFormFieldTypeUnsigned) and then add @\"textField.secureTextEntry\": @YES to the field dictionary.\n. I'll consider whether there is a better approach for secure text fields - it's not an issue that has arisen before so I don't know that it's worth a huge amount of refactoring to fix it. Checking for FXFormFieldTypePassword and @\"textField.secureTextEntry\" should be the only cases you have to deal with. You could optionally create a new type \"FormFieldTypeNumericPassword\" and a custom cell to handle it if you prefer.\nThe code is all in one file because of the how C/Objective-C handles privacy. Currently the components rely on talking to each other's private methods, and there's no particularly elegant way to do this across multiple files (private categories is an option I'm considering). Swift appears to do nothing to improve this, and actually removes the private category option so I expect this pattern to continue. I don't consider having all code in one file to be a big issue as long as class responsibilities are separated.\nI don't have a specific date planned for 1.2 release. Features are mostly locked down now, so once I'm happy that it's stable I'll release it.\n. Can you paste the full code of how you enumerated the field? It sounds like it was enumerating the fields of the options subfotm instead of the root form.\n. Ah, interesting. The FXFormFieldInline is the cause here. I guess this is unexpected behavior, but it may be a little tricky to fix, since it's technically behaving correctly; those are the keys for the fields displayed at those index paths in the form, and if I return the non-inlined field instead then the indexPaths won't match the tableview, which may also be unexpected behavior.\n. Sorry, already fixed this a while ago, just forgot to push it for some reason.\n. You need to include FXFormFieldKey: @\"domain\" in the dictionary if you want to return it from the -fields array, otherwise FXForms doesn't know which field it relates to (it works when it's a standalone method because it infers the key from the domainField method name).\n. I would argue that tapping (or scrolling) elsewhere on screen is a good way to dismiss it ;-)\n. Seems reasonable. Implemented in 1.2.8.\n. Sorry, I missed the part about changing the color, but I'm not sure hard-coding a color like this is appropriate anyway. Maybe it could use the tintColor instead though or something?\n. I guess this could be a configuration option in the form. I'll think about it.\n. It's possible to do all of your cell styling in IB, although currently it's necessary to create a custom cell class for each distinct cell.xib (although the class need not do anything except extend FXFormBaseCell).\nCan you paste in some examples of the classes you've had to write? It may be that in some cases there was a better way, but in the cases where there wasn't, I'll see if I can improve the API.\n. I'll need a bit more context. Is it a dynamic form? What properties have you included in the field dictionary?\n. Try the latest update. It should now treat empty text values as nil for fields of type NSNumber.\n. Have a look at the DynamicFieldsExample - it shows how to create a form from a JSON file.\n. You'll need to download the list as JSON using NSURLSession, and then set it as the options in your form fields dictionary.\n. I'm adding support for this in the next version, but FWIW you can customise the header and footer views using the UITableViewDelegate methods in your view controller, as normal.\n. Headers aren't cells, they're ordinary views. Just create a UILabel with the attributes and text that you want and set it as the FXFormFieldHeader of the field.\n. Note: There's currently no way for FXForms to set the text of custom headers automatically, so you'll need to set the text yourself for each header you create. You can always simplify that by creating a custom view class with a constructor, e.g. [MyHeaderView viewWithTitle:someString]\n. You can't set headers in JSON unless you create a separate class for each header, which would be a PiTA. I suggest you use the FXFormDelegate instead.\nYou don't need to add anything to your JSON, unless you want to modify the title text of the header. If you do, just add\n\"header\": \"Some long title / description text to add to the form and tell the user what the next part is all about\"\nto the dictionary for the first field in the section where you want it to appear.\nTo customise the font, etc, add a method like this to your form view controller:\n```\n- (UIView )tableView:(UITableView )tableView viewForHeaderInSection:(NSInteger)section\n{\n    NSString title = [(id)self.formController tableView:tableView titleForHeaderInSection:section];\n    if ([title length])\n    {\n        UILabel label = [[UILabel alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(10, 5, tableView.frame.size.width - 20, 18)];\n        label.text = title;\n        label.font = [UIFont boldSystemFontOfSize:12];\n        label.textColor = [UIColor redColor];\n        [label sizeToFit];\n    UIView *view = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, tableView.frame.size.width, label.frame.size.height + 10)];\n    view.backgroundColor = [UIColor greenColor];\n    [view addSubview:label];\n    return view;\n}\nreturn nil;\n\n}\n\n(CGFloat)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView heightForHeaderInSection:(NSInteger)section\n{\n    return [self tableView:tableView viewForHeaderInSection:section].frame.size.height;\n}\n```\n. Add the \"header\": \"Whatever text I want\" to the first field in the section it relates to - don't put it in a field on its own. i.e., do it like this:\n\n```\n{\"header\": \"Whatever text I want\",\n \"key\": \"field1\",\n \"title\": \"field 1\",\n\"type\": \"integer\"},\n{\"key\": \"field2\",\n \"title\": \"field 2\",\n\"type\": \"text\"},\n```\n. Alternatively, if you just want an ordinary cell full of text that you can style, use a cell of \"type\": \"label\" instead, then you can customise it however you want in the normal way using keypaths.\n. Yes, that's true. You'll probably need to create a custom cell, as you originally suggested.\nI'll look into making multiline text work with FXFormFieldTypeLabel, as that would be a simpler solution.\n. I think removing readonly properties altogether is too blunt, as it can be useful for things like label fields or info pages. For now, I've eliminated just those properties.\n. This question is a bit confusing. I'm not sure why you've overridden -fields, -extraFields and -excludedFields instead of just returning _dynamicFields from the -fields method.\nAlso, if you are using Swift, why not define your ApplicationForm class in Swift instead of Objective-C? As long as it's a subclass of NSObject, it should work fine.\nThe solution to adding options to your dynamic fields should be to just add the Male/Female/etc options into your JSON file. There are several examples of how to specify options fields in JSON in the DynamicFieldsExample.\n. Note: for the example you've given, you shouldn't need to use FXFormFieldValueTransformer as the values are simple strings. If you find that do need to use a value transformer, let me know as that's a bit more complex.\n. You need to override valueForKey: and setValue:forKey: in your form object (see the DynamicFieldsExample for details) otherwise FXForms cannot record the state of the field.\n. You don't really need the cell in this case, it was only being used to look up the form. You can just do this instead:\n```\n- (IBAction)barBtnSave:(UIBarButtonItem )sender\n{\n    //I'm assuming that the barBtnSave method is in your form view controller - if it's somewhere\n    //else then you'll need to get the form via a different route\n    RegistrationForm form = self.formController.form;\n//we can then perform validation, etc\nif (form.agreedToTerms)\n{\n    [[[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@\"Registration Form Submitted\" message:nil delegate:nil cancelButtonTitle:nil otherButtonTitles:@\"OK\", nil] show];\n}\nelse\n{\n    [[[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@\"User Error\" message:@\"Please agree to the terms and conditions before proceeding\" delegate:nil cancelButtonTitle:nil otherButtonTitles:@\"Yes Sir!\", nil] show];\n}\n\n}\n```\n. You may need to resign the responder on the form. You can do that by calling [formViewController.view setEditing:NO];\n. Yes, this is fixed in the latest beta.\n. Just use :head, or link directly to the pod spec inside the repository. It will be published normally once it's out of beta.\n. Interesting. I think the problem may be that the value isn't being stored, not that the cell is being recycled, but I need to verify.\n. Yeah, so it looks like the problem is that you've not implemented any way to store the dynamic values in your form object. You'd normally do that by overriding the valueForUndefinedKey: and setValueForUndefinedKey: methods and then storing the values in a dictionary (have a look at the DynamicFieldsExample to see what I mean).\nBecause you aren't storing the values anywhere, when the cells are re-created, the value is lost.\nIt's not ideal that FXForms fails silently here: It should probably throw an exception when you try to set a value on a form that it can't store, but other than that it seems to be working correctly.\n. You can include arbitrary key/value pairs in the field dictionary, provided that they match up with a property of the UITableViewCell. So @\"accessibilityLabel\": @\"Foo\" should work for setting a cell's accessibility label.\nI don't think there's currently a way to do this for the fields in an options subform.\n. Currently, I dismiss the keyboard on scroll deliberately because it's the expected behaviour as of iOS 7, and many keyboard variants cannot be dismissed any other way as they don't have a close button.\nI guess I could look at making this a configurable option.\n. You can add an action for when the value in a field changes (which is usually triggered when the done button is pressed). You do that using the FXFormFieldAction key, which can be either a block or the name of a method on your controller.\n. I've added this fix in 1.2.1\n. This is already possible. Just add the FXFormFieldInline option to the field dictionary.\n. Oh, I see. Currently that feature doesn't exist. Interesting idea though.\n. Thanks for flagging this. Fixed in 1.2.1.\n. Yes, you may need to resign the responder manually. FXForms only resigns the responder automatically when you tap a cell, so if the button is not inside a cell then the currently editing value may not yet have been committed to the form when you press it.\n. The FXFormFieldDefaultValue is only intended for use with values that are nillable. A BOOL can only be true or false, so FXForms has no way of knowing if the value has already been set.\nThere are couple of options you could take:\n1) In the init method of your form object, set the value to YES (this is the general way to set default values)\n1) Use an NSNumber for your property instead of a BOOL. That way, if it's nil, FXForms can set it to YES automatically if you set the FXFormFieldDefaultValue to @YES.\n. You can create your own Cell subclass that uses this control, and then register it as the default cell for handling strings.\n. Ooh, nice. I didn't know about that constant.\n. Sorry, this was a bug. Should be fixed in 1.2.1\n. I'm unclear what you mean by  headers and footers now being implicit. Can you send me a screenshot of how your controller looks now, and how it looked before with the older version of FXForms so I can get some idea what the problem is?\n. If you are just trying to get rid of the header text, you can use { FXFormFieldHeader: @\"\" }, but that won't get rid of the gap.\n. @ninokierulf I suspect the effect you're describing is just the normal appearance of tableviews in group mode. You can supply your own tableview created with UITableViewStylePlain to get rid of the gap.\n. This doesn't seem like an FXForms issue. Are you maybe using some iOS8-only feature in your storyboard?\n. no problem :-)\n. Try setting the image to nil on your form and then reloading the tableView.\n. There was a bug in version 1.2.1 that was party responsible for this not working. That's fixed in 1.2.2.\nThe other part is that you need to specify the form types because Swift doesn't provide that information at runtime like objective C for some reason. You can do that like this:\n```\nclass SettingsForm: NSObject, FXForm {\n    var userProfile: UserProfileForm\n    var legal: LegalForm = LegalForm()\ninit(user: User) {\n    self.userProfile = UserProfileForm(user: user)\n}\n\nfunc userProfileField() -> FXFormFieldDictionary {\n    return [\n        FXFormFieldClass: userProfile.dynamicType,\n        FXFormFieldInline: true\n    ]\n}\n\nfunc legalField() -> FXFormFieldDictionary {\n    return [\n        FXFormFieldClass: legal.dynamicType,\n        FXFormFieldInline: true\n    ]\n}\n\n}\n```\n. By the way, you can get rid of these two methods:\n```\nfunc fullNameField() -> FXFormFieldDictionary {\n    return [\n        FXFormFieldHeader: \"User Profile\",\n        FXFormFieldTitle: \"Full Name\"\n    ]\n}\nfunc emailField() -> FXFormFieldDictionary {\n    return [\n        FXFormFieldTitle: \"Email\",\n        FXFormFieldType: FXFormFieldTypeEmail\n    ]\n}\n```\nAll of that is inferred by default.\nEDIT: oops, you still need this bit:\nEDIT2: no, I was right the first time! :-)\n. This is the same problem. In your Legal form, put this:\n```\nfunc termsOfServiceField() -> FXFormFieldDictionary {\n    return [\n        FXFormFieldClass: termsOfService.dynamicType\n    ]\n}\nfunc privacyPolicyField() -> FXFormFieldDictionary {\nreturn [\n    FXFormFieldClass: privacyPolicy.dynamicType\n]\n\n}\n```\n(And there's no need to implement the fields() method)\n. Hmm, I tried the same and it worked at my end. Can you send me your project?\nsupport @ charcoaldesign.co.uk\n. Hi Justin,\nThanks for sending the project through. I turns out that the issue was just that you need to embed your view controller inside a UINavigationController, otherwise there's nothing to push the sub viewcontrollers onto.\nI should probably throw an exception in this case rather than failing silently!\n. FYI thanks to your help, I've managed to find a fix for the original issue. I just pushed version 1.2.3 that no longer requires you to specify the dynamicType for your forms and controllers, so you can take all that out again if you want!\n. @kumargaurav89 Is your formViewController inside a UINavigationController? It needs to be if you want to use non-inline subforms.\n. Create a new ViewController class that conforms to the  protocol, which means that it has a \"field\" property of type FXFormField.\nWhen your controller is pushed, it's field property will be automatically set, and you can return the value by settings self.field.value before popping the controller.\nI don't think the inline array template is the one you want to base it on because your form controller won't appear inline in the form. Instead, you probably want something like this:\n@{FXFormFieldKey: @\"myCustomField\",\n  FXFormFieldViewController: [MyFormFieldViewController class]}\n. FXFormFieldTypeLabel is the type, not the key. Try this:\n@{FXFormFieldType: FXFormFieldTypeLabel,\n    FXFormFieldTitle: @\"Program Version\",\n    FXFormFieldDefaultValue: @\"1.0\"}\n. If you have property already, you can omit the FXFormFieldDefaultValue and it will get its value directly from your property.\nTo intercept changes to homeinit, you can add an action, like this:\n@{FXFormFieldKey: @\"homeinit\", FXFormFieldAction: \"methodName:\"}\nThe action is the name of a method that you want to call on your controller when the value changes. So in your controller, you'd add:\n- (void)methodName:(id<FXFormFieldCell>)cell {\n    BOOL homeinitValue = [cell.field.value boolValue];\n}\nBy the way, FXForms can automatically infer the field title from the property name, so if you give your form properties human-readable names then you don't have to specify the FXFormFieldTitle for every field (e.g. if you call your version property \"programVersion\", then the title will be \"Program Version\".\n. Probably because you've set field type to FXFormFieldTypeLabel. Labels are non-interactive. Remove the FXFormFieldType key and it will use the default.\n. :-)\n. I'll need a bit more detail. Can you paste in your form class and the json for that field?\n. FXFormFieldAction doesn't have to be a block, it can be the name of a method to call on your view controller instead. That allows you to put any model update logic in your controller, instead of having to observe the model directly.\n. You may need to set the FXFormFieldClass for your subforms - FXForms can't infer the type of dynamic properties, so it defaults to text.\n. This is working correctly for me in the latest version. Can you try again, and if it's still not working, please send a project demsonqrating the problem to support at charcoaldesign dot co dot uk.\n. This working correctly for me. Are you using a custom header view? Or maybe it's something to do with the font?\n. Add the table view manually in IB and bind into the tableView outlet of the FXFormViewController.\n. I can't see anything wrong with your code, but the dateOfBirth field is working fine in the BasicExample project, so I don't think it's an FXForms bug.\nCan you send me the project and I'll try to reproduce it? support at charcoal design dot co dot uk\n. Fair enough. I suggest putting a breakpoint in the tap handling method and stepping through to see what's going on then.\n. You weren't doing anything wrong, it's just that the class inference wasn't as smart as it should have been. Fixed in 1.2.6\n(PS, you don't need to specify FXFormFieldCell explicitly, just FXFormFieldType is enough).\n. Ah, you could be right. I'll check.\n. Hmm, it's working for me. Which OS are you testing on?\n. Also, is it the cancel button for the UIActionSheet, or the image picker controller that's not working for you?\n. Hmm, it won't be the UIAlertController NULL method then, because that's only used on iOS8+. I don't have an iOS7 device to hand - can you puta breakpoint in the action sheet callback and see if you can work out what's happening? Maybe the button index is wrong?\n. If you change the structure of the form, you need to reassign it to the formController using formController.form = formController.form, then call [tableView reloadData]\n. You can't do this with an ordinary options field. You'll have to create a dynamic form object using the technique shown in the DynamicFieldsExample, then build a tree of subforms, where each field in each form is a subform containing the fields for the next set of options.\n. This is an interesting problem, and there's a case for me to create a \"tree\" type field to make this simpler, but I can't easily estimate how long that would take.\n. Quite right. Fixed in 1.2.8\n. Is this still happening in 1.2.8?\n. The proxy form seems like the way to go in this case.\nYou can present a field in a screen on its own, but only by building a custom view controller with a bespoke UI for editing the field value. FXFormViewController is only designed to work with fields whose value is of type FXForm, it can't display a single field.\nI could modify FXFormViewController to do this proxying automatically, but it seems like a bit of an edge case, and it's unclear how field properties such as header/footer should be handled in the general case (would they be displayed in both the main form and subform?).\nI'll think about it.\n. You can already make forms within forms - just define one of your root form's fields as being another FXForm object (the example app does this). The OP had a slightly different requirement.\n. What was the logical clarification?\n. Ah, the convention in Objective-C is to write selectors (method names) without the argument names, since they're redundant. So a method like:\n- (void)didSelectWithTableView:(UITableView *)tableView controller:(UIViewController *)controller;\nJust becomes:\ndidSelectWithTableView:controller:\n. You may be thinking of Swift, which has slightly different naming conventions.\n. You can do it, but it's a little awkward. Add an FXFormFieldAction to the field and it will be called when the value is updated. You can then set the field text color to red and refresh the form if it's invalid.\n. You'll need to subclass FXFormViewControllerandset up your custom back button as a leftBarButtonItem. Then add your custom controller class to the field dictionary for the field that displays it, e.g\n- (NSDictionary *)mySubformField {\n    return @{FXFormFieldViewController: [MyFormSubclass class]};\n}\n. from within your submitRegistrationForm method, get the navigation controller using self.navigationController, then call popToRootViewController on it to dismiss all the presented forms\n. If you override the setText method of the cell with your own method, do you still get the warning?\n. Fair enough. In that case it's a spurious warning. You can suppress it like this:\n```\npragma clang diagnostic push\npragma clang diagnostic ignored  \"-Wdeprecated-declarations\"\n\n(void)setText:(NSString *)text {\n    ...\n}\n\npragma clang diagnostic pop\n```\n. There's no need to check if customLabel is nil before setting the text by the way - Objective-C is nil safe. Your setText method can just be:\n```\npragma clang diagnostic push\npragma clang diagnostic ignored  \"-Wdeprecated-declarations\"\n\n(void)setText:(NSString *)text {\n    self.customLabel.text = text\n}\n\npragma clang diagnostic pop\n```\n. Is your customLabel outlet defined as weak? It probably shouldn't be - that recommendation only applies to outlets on view controllers, and even that is unnecessary since iOS6 because views are no longer unloaded.\n. I may have got the deprecation warning string wrong. You can find out what the actual warning you need to suppress is by right-clicking warning in left sidebar and selecting \"show in log\".\n. There is a PR that implements this already. I'm not certain whether I like it or not, but if you need it then you can use this fork until I decide what to do: https://github.com/nicklockwood/FXForms/pull/111\n. How is a \"hidden\" field different from an excluded field, e.g. one not included in the fields array, or that you've put into the excludedFields array?\n. Can you provide more information? Which iOS version was this? What was the crash - what appeared in the console, etc?\n. OK, fixed in 1.2.10\n. Yes, just set FXFormFieldTitle to a blank string @\"\"\n. You can call self.navigationController.topViewController to get the frontmost form controller.\n. Why not just set imageView.image instead of textView.leftView?\n. You can set the keyboard close button by adding the following to the field dictionary:\n\"textField.returnKeyType\" : UIReturnKeySend\nThe picker view doesn't have a close button.\n. Create a new class containing zip and state string properties to use as the form field, and a new cell class containing both fields. Then you'll just be mapping one form property to one cell.\n. Your custom cell would access the composite object by calling field.value and then read the subfields from it directly.\n. That isn't necessary, just set the field on your form object to be of the correct type and FXForms will infer the valueClass.\n. Ah, yes, it would. In that case you will need to specify valueClass. What crash are you seeing?\n. The key you need to set valueClass is just \"class\", are you using \"valueClass\" instead?\n. Can you paste in your whole field dictionary?\n. \"type\" shouldn't be \"option\" as that's used for bool values, also using \"options\" may confuse FXForms since it will think this is an options field where actually it's something completely custom. Maybe call it \"states\" instead.\n. I think the field.value will initially be nil. It would be up to you to create an instance of PPStateZip, either in the cell or in the DynamicForm itself.\n. If you want to send me your project, I'll take a look if you like. I think it can be done without modifying FXForms, but it's difficult to diagnose the issue remotely.\n. Hmm. I think it used to but no longer does because that crashed for CoreData objects. It will work if the custom class conforms to the FXForm protocol, which might actually make things easier.\nI.e. you could treat the field as a subform, but still render it using a single cell.\n. You'd just need to declare PPStateZip as conforming to < FXForm > protocol, but if it's already working for you  without doing that then don't worry about it.\n. It would still be the field.value.\n. There's no easy way to do this right now, sorry. You'll have to hack the tableView:editingStyleForRowAtIndexPath: method in FXForms.h\n. This will give you a left-aligned date:\n@{FXFormFieldKey: @\"dateOfBirth\", FXFormFieldTitle: @\"\", @\"style\": @(UITableViewCellStyleSubtitle), FXFormFieldPlaceholder: @\"Date Of Birth\"},\nTweaking the color of the placeholder text to match the other fields may be more challenging.\n. Well, actually, if you don't mind the date being grey after it is selected, you can set the text color like this:\n@{FXFormFieldKey: @\"dateOfBirth\",\nFXFormFieldTitle: @\"\",\nFXFormFieldPlaceholder: @\"Date Of Birth\",\n@\"style\": @(UITableViewCellStyleSubtitle),\n@\"detailTextLabel.color\": [UIColor lightGrayColor]},\n. You can always subclass FXFormDatePickerCell if you need more sophisticated customisation.\n. There's no automatic way to format currencies in iOS. Just use an NSValueTransformer to manually build the string. Or you can use a block if that's easier.\n. Fields have an optional FXFormFieldValueTransformer property, so you can supply the value transformer along with your other field configuration.\n. Yes, sorry, I was unclear. I meant that there's no way to automatically format a number with a currency symbol. You'd have to concatenate the number and symbol manually, although it would make sense to use NSNumberFormatterCurrencyStyle for the numeric part.\n. @marcelofabri ah, interesting. I didn't realise that.\n. @dformoso this isn't really an FXForms-related problem. If you can figure out how to get the effect you want with an ordinary UITextField, you can get the same effect in FXForms by creating a custom cell.\n. In Objective-C, NSInteger can't be nil. You need to set the value to NSNotFound to clear it - the default value of zero maps to the first element.\n. You could just use an options field and supply an array of NSNumbers in the desired range as the options.\n. NSInteger cannot have a value of nil, so it defaults to zero, which is the first value in your enum.\nThere are various solutions to this. Either use an NSNumber property instead of NSInteger, or set the value of the field to NSNotFound in the init method of your form.\n. The ISO3166 transformer is just example code, not part of the FXForms library. I haven't tested it and don't advocate re-using it in your own projects.\n. If you create a UIViewController subclass that conforms to the FXFormFieldViewController protocol, you can create a completely bespoke interface for setting a field value. In your field dictionary just add FXFormFieldViewController: MyCustomForm to use your VC instead of the default picker interface.\nAlternatively, I guess you could subclass FXTextFieldCell, and implement your autocomplete field as an inline control.\n. You can use FXFormFieldValueTransformer for that.\n. The reason I don't expose the options array is that the indexes/values vary depending on whether you include a placeholder or default value. For that reason, I've hidden the underlying array to avoid confusion and crashes due to mismatched indexes.\n. The newly pushed controller should inherit the configuration from the parent controller. If you want different configuration, you can supply a custom FXFormViewController subclass to use by setting the FXFormFieldViewController property of the field that displays the subform.\n. Yes, check out the DynamicFieldsExample project in the examples folder.\n. You need the string value if you are using it in a JSON file. Fair point about example usage though.\n. Um, no. Sorry. I hard-coded the cell class. I should probably fix that!\n. I'm not sure I fully understand what you mean by \"Send the selected object\"? What kind of object is it? Is it one of the values represented by a field in your form object?\nIf so, you can access the form from within a FXFormViewController subclass like this:\nMyForm *form = (MyForm *)self.formController.form;\nform.someProperty = valueFromSegue;\nThen you can set one of its properties, and then reload the table using \n[self.formController.tableView reloadData];\nTo see the updated value appear. Or, if the object from the segue actually is an entire form in its own right, you can just assign it to self.formController.form.\nIf that's not what you mean, please explain further.\n. Try calling setValuesForKeysWithDictionary: On your form object. If the keys and types match up with the properties, it should work (otherwise it will crash)\n. Are you using Swift?\n. It's not expected. Is it for every field, or just a particular type?\n. This should now be fixed in 1.2.12\n. That isn't how you use a custom cell in FXForms - I'm not sure why you thought it was :-)\nI can't tell exactly from the code you've given me how you're trying to use your custom cell, but take a look at the CustomButtonExample example project and hopefully that will make things clearer.\n. Sounds like a bug. I'll take a look.\n. Fixed in 1.2.11\n. Yeah, subclassing the cell is your best bet here. It should be pretty trivial - just subclass the FXFormsOptionSegmentsCell and override the - (void)layoutSubviews method . You can copy the existing code, but use a hardcoded width.\nThen just specify your new cell class in the form field dictionary instead of FXFormOptionSegmentsCell.\n. The template title was supposed to be used only for the \u201cAdd Item\u201d button, but was appearing inside each field. I\u2019ve fixed that in 1.2.12.\nOnce you upgrade to 1.2.12, if you just want a blank text field, you shouldn\u2019t need to do anything further to customize your cell - you can just use a standard FXFormTextFieldCell.\nThe only thing that isn't supported is making the email fields non-editable after they've been created. You might be able to rig that up using a custom cell, but I'm not exactly sure what the best way to do that would be - maybe replace the strings in your array with some kind of object that has an editable state?.\nNote that if a user edits any existing entries, it will call the setter on your form for the whole list, so you can apply any necessary re-validation logic. It may not be necessary for you to make them non-editable, unless it's particularly desirable for UX reasons.\nIf you want to apply custom styling then subclassing FXFormTextFieldCell as you were doing is the correct approach. The cell has a \u201cfield\u201d property that contains all the available state information.\nNick\n. It's fairly easy to add this with a custom action on the field, but yeah, it's a commonly requested feature - I'll think about adding it.\n. This looks awesome! I was intending to add something similar but haven't had the time. And yes, using the inline property makes perfect sense for this. Can you file a pull request? I can't promise I'll get to it right away, but I will eventually.\n. Set the value on the form object, and then reload the tableView (or just the relevant row) in the normal way.\n. It doesn't include a minus sign, unfortunately, otherwise that would be a good option.\n. I do use the decimal pad if you set the type to Unsigned Integer (there's no such thing as an unsigned float though).\n. Yes, but mostly because that property is rather poorly defined, and has suffered some scope creep. It really needs to be broken up into separate events.\nTo detect every text change, I suggest you add a KVC observer to your form field, or override the setter and have it call an action directly.\n. I don't think the \"self\" is required.\n. The tableView itself tou can just access directly, via the view controller, e.g. self.formController.tableView. IIRC though, cells are opaque by default, so setting tableview background may not do what you want.\n. How would you do it normally if you were calling the segue yourself?\n. If it's a push segue onto a navigation controller, you're probably better off using FXFormFieldViewController instead. Then you can implement the FXFormFieldViewController protocol, which adds a \"field\" property to your controller that can be used to set the field value.\n. Yeah, I don't recycle cells, and that's problematic for performance. I want to fix that, but it's not trivial to ensure that properties are properly reset.\n. It should be:\n[self.formController registerCellClass:[MyFormTextFieldCell class] forFieldType:FXFormFieldTypeText];\nWhich tells FXForms to use your MyFormTextFieldCell for any field of type FXFormFieldTypeText. That seems to be equivalent to the third option you tried though, so if it's not working, have you verified that self.formController is not nil inside your init method?\n. If you subclass FXFormTextFieldCell then it should handle the different keyboards, etc. automatically.\nYou can't get the field type in setUp, but in update you can check self.field.type.\n. There's a +heightForField: method you can override that is called whenever the row is updated.\n. I'm not sure why that wouldn't work, but take a look at how FXFormImagePickerCell works, and see if that's doing anything differently.\nYou might also try using Xcode's view logging features to inspect your cell and see if the imageView is being wrongly positioned or sized, or if the image property has been set correctly.\n. Brilliant! Thank you Donna :-)\n. You can add an action block or selector to the last field using FXFormFieldAction\n. @aryaxt I'm not sure I understand the question. It's included in version 1.2.13, which is the latest version on CocoaPods. It's not included in 1.2.12 because that version was released before that feature was merged.\n. You can set a default value in your form configuration for that field, e.g.\n- (NSDictionary *)myPropertyField\n{\n    return @{FXFormFieldDefaultValue: @3}; // number equal to enum value you want to be default\n}\nAlternatively, in the init for your form object, you can just set the default, like this:\n- (id)init\n{\n    if ((self = [super init])) {\n        _myProperty = SOME_ENUM_VALUE;\n    }\n    return self;\n}\n. @wdcurry thanks, I've updated my original answer.\n(ps, to indent code correctly on github, just add four spaces at the start of each line.)\n. If your View controller has a property called field of type FXFormField, it will be set automatically to the field of the cell that was clicked. You can include any data you want to pass as that field's value.\n. If you set the options value of the field yo be an array of the ids, you can use a valueTransformer to display these as human-readable names.\nThe country select menu in the example app demonstrates how to do this (it maps country names to codes).\n. The slider needs to set the value of it's cell.field when it changes, so if you haven't already done so, you should add this inside your custom cell:\n```\n[self.slider addTarget:self action:@selector(didChange)];\n...\n\n(void)didChange {\n    self.field.value = @(self.slider.value);\n}\n```\n\nTo get the forms values as a dictionary, you can use KVC and say something like:\nNSDictionary *values = [myForm dictionaryWithValuesForKeys:@[@\"field1\", @\"field2\", etc...]];\nOr, if you follow the dynamic form example, you can create a form that stores all its values in a dictionary anyway, which you can access directly.\n. Yes, it's due to reuse. Just as you have to set the cell.field.value when you update the slider, you also have to set the cell.slider value when the field changes.\nOverride setField: on the cell, like this:\n- (void)setField:(FXFormField)field\n{\n    super.field = field;\n    self.slider.value = field,value.floatValue;\n}\n(You can get rid of the seperate float property)\n. You should be able to subclass FXFormBaseCell and save yourself some hassle, but if you're just using UITableViewCell as the base, change it to:\n```\n@synthesize field = _field; // field is part of FXFormFieldCell protocol. This creates ivar and accessors\n\n(void)setField:(FXFormField)field\n{\n    _field = field;\n    self.slider.value = field,value.floatValue;\n}\n```\n. Analyzer warnings generally shouldn't be ignored. I'll look into it.\n. Init a new form object and assign it to the form property, then call reloadData on the tableView.\n. No, that just reloads the same form object. To reset the form you need to also update the form object first, like this:\n\nself.form = MyForm()\nself.tableView.reloadData()\n. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd\n. That doesn't make a whole lot of sense. self.fields is functionally equivalent to [self fields]. Can you explain what effect you believe this change had on the behavior?\n. But self.fields doesn't access the instance variable. It calls the - (NSMutableArray *)fields method. To access the instance variable, you'd have to write self->_fields.\nTry putting a breakpoint inside - (NSMutableArray *)fields and you can verify that it's called when you access self.fields.\nI think perhaps the issue that you're referring to is \"Argument to 'NSMutableArray' method 'addObject;:' cannot be nil\"? In which case the issue it's complaining about is that the field value being added to the array is nil, not the array itself.\nI'll fix this in the next update.\n. Hmm, I can't actually replicate a clang warning on the line you fixed. The warning I'm seeing is on the line a few below that: [self.fields addObject:field]\n. I think maybe the change above just confused the analyzer so that it couldn't parse the logic below anymore \u00af(\u30c4)/\u00af \n. I will continue to support it, but I can't commit to any specific features or timelines.\nI've just submitted version 1.2.13 which works on Xcode 7.0 / iOS 9.\nMost issues seem minor. I'll review them as and when I can.\n. Therr are two simple options:\n1) add headers to separate the table into groups by adding FXFormFieldHeader values (see the registration form example)\n2) split the form into nested subforms, which you can do by splitting your form object up into several sub objects (again, see the registration form)\nImplementing a search filter is possible, but there's no support built in. You'd need to override the fields method of your form and return a filtered list based on a search string.\n. You could use a hex string and convert it using my ColorUtils library.\n. Yes, just use FXFormFieldTypeDateTime instead.\n. Call tableView.reloadData()\n. Make it a readwrite @property of your form object, then you can set it.\n. No, it will automatically use localised versions of your field titles if you include them in your Localizable.strings file.\n. Default values don't work that way. Default values are the value used when a field is reset to null. BOOL values can't be null, so they can't be reset.\nTo set the value to YES by default, just set self.rememberMe = YES in the init method of your form object.\n. You'd need to create a custom cell type backed by a custom class with two fields: NSString *name and BOOL selected. Then you could create a template form consisting of fields of that type.\n. I'm not sure what you were expecting @\"stepper.backgroundColor\": [UIColor grayColor] to do, but it looks to me like it's working as expected.\nIf you were trying to just change the color of the buttons and not the background, that's outside the scope of FXForms since I'm just using the standard control and not doing anything special with it, but here are some ideas:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/8762512/change-appearance-of-uistepper\n. The FieldSelectorViewController should have a field property of type FXFormField, like this:\n@property (nonatomic, strong) FXFormField *field;\nThis will be automatically populated by the parent form (your DynamicForm class) when the Reason field is selected.\nTo update the value from within the FieldSelectorViewController, just set the value of the field, like this:\nself.field.value = @\"New Value\";\nAnd that should then update the value of the Reason property in the DynamicForm. To refresh the display of the field in the FieldSelectorViewController you may also need to call\n[self.tableView reloadData];\n. I think I'm going to have to see more of the code to debug this.\n. @\"textField.textColor\"\n. This works fine in version 1.2.14, which was released on November 2nd. It may be that you need to upgrade your Xcode version.\n. @plandem, I was oversimplifying. You don't need to use the latest version of Xcode, but you do need to use the latest iOS SDK.\nThe reason that FXForms is giving you an error is because you are trying to build using the iOS8 SDK, and the cellLayoutMarginsFollowReadableWidth symbol doesn't exist in that SDK version.\nIf you build using the iOS9 SDK instead, but set the deployment target as iOS8 or earlier, FXForms will still work fine on iOS8 because it checks for the existence of that feature at runtime.\nYou don't need to use the iOS8 SDK to support iOS8, but if you choose to do so for some reason, you'll need to either use an old version of FXForms, or modify the new version to compile using the iOS8 SDK.\n. Which writeup are you referring to?\n. In your form class, add the following method:\n- (NSDictionary *)<nameOfYourProperty>Field {\n  return @{FXFormFieldType: FXFormFieldTypeTime};\n}\n. (You don't have to declare it in the @interface, only in the @implementation)\n. Try\n- (NSDictionary *)<nameOfYourProperty>Field {\n  return @{FXFormFieldType: FXFormFieldTypeTime, FXFormFieldTitle: @\"\"};\n}\n. Er\u2026 that's curious. Maybe an issue with the locale being different for the picker than the label?\n. Swift enums are very different from C enums, and I've not tested FXForms with them, so I can't be sure they can be used in the same way as in my example code.\nWith that said, did you try:\nenum Gender : Int {\n  case male\n  case female\n  case undetermined\n}\nPerhaps that will work?\n. I'm not sure I understand, but have you looked at the Dynamic Forms example? It shows how to build forms from json instead of a fixed structure.\n. Oh I see. There's no built-in control for that yet. You could do it with a template field, but you'd need to create a custom field type that includes both a text input and a tick for selection.\n. It might be easier to go the route of having an \"other, please specify\" option in your enum, and then having an optional text field that is shown only when \"other\" is selected.\nYou could also just have a separate text field for entering a new value which then modifies the source array for the selection in your data model, and reloads the form.\n. You need to nest your form view controller inside a navigation controller in order to push another controller.\n. Makes sense - I'll add that.\n. OK, this is fixed in beta 5.\n. can you paste the form properties you are using? I'll try to reproduce it.\n. Fixed in beta 5.\n. Was there a specific feature you'd like to see demoed?\n. The simplest way is:\nSet the base class of your custom view controller to be FXFormViewController instead of UIViewController.\nIn the storyboard, you should now be able to bind your tableView to the tableView outlet of your custom view controller.\nFinally, in the viewDidLoad or awakeFromNib method of your view controller, set self.formController.form = [your form]\nYou may need to call [self.tableView reloadData] after setting the form property.\n. Ah yes, sorry I missed this part when I skimmed the code:\nif (self.valueTransformer) {\n    return [self.valueTransformer transformedValue:[self.value fieldDescription]];\n}\n. That's exactly what it does. \n. Yeah, I thought it was better to localise the title-cased version because that follows the convention of using the human-readable english text as the key in the strings file.\n. In this case you'd just write \"options\": [NSLocalizedString(\"option1\", nil), NSLocalizedString(\"option2, nil)\"]\n. If that's in a JSON file, I guess you'd probably just make the JSON into a localised resource and have a different JSON for each locale.\n. You could use a value transformer to convert the unlocalized version to the localized one fir display purposes, then the value would be unaffected.\n. Yep, this is planned for the next release.\n. No, but I'll probably put a beta out quite soon.\n. It's probably simplest if I just do this. It won't be too long.\n. OK, this is implemented.\n. A PR would be great, thanks!\n. This is now merged.\n. @Ashton-W that makes sense. I'm considering adding a phone number type, but I think this might be better implemented as part of some kind of generic string formatting system.\n. OK, I think this is addressed by the new phone number field. Let me know if not.\n. Yes, you can do this by subclassing FXFormViewController, then in the viewDidAppear, do this:\n```\n- (void)viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated\n{\n    [super viewDidAppear:animated];\n//get first field\nid <FXFormFieldCell> cell = (id <FXFormFieldCell>)[self.tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:[NSIndexPath indexPathForRow:0 inSection:0]];\n\n//select field (assuming it's a text field\nif ([cell respondsToSelector:@selector(textField)])\n{\n    [((FXFormTextFieldCell *)cell).textField becomeFirstResponder];\n}\n\n}\n```\n. How very strange. That's exactly the approach I would have recommended, but it seems that for some reason, UITextField is not KVC-compliant for that key. I'll see if I can work out why.\n. I've put in a temporary fix in 1.0.2 that treats UITextInputTraits as a special case. I'll try to come up with something better for 1.1.\n. Thanks for yet another great PR :-)\nI've decided that int the interests of avoiding duplication, as much as possible the FXFormFieldType should relate only to the data type, not the way in which it is displayed.\nI think that in this case it would be sufficient simply to define the FXFormOptionPickerCell, and then specify that the field should use this cell class using the FXFormFieldCell property.\nIf you'd like to make that change, I'll merge this PR. Otherwise, I can make the change myself if you prefer.\n. Oops, sorry. I merged the PRs in the wrong order, and now can't merge this. If you wouldn't mind fixing the conflicts, I'll merge yours next.\n. The problem is that the type of Cell I'm using for buttons is\nUITableViewCellStyleValue1,     // Left aligned label on left and right aligned label on right with blue text (Used in Settings)\nAs far as I can tell, there's no way to center the text on this type of cell. I'm going to see if I can provide a way to fix this without subclassing FXFormBaseCell, however, if you are willing to subclass FXFormBaseCell you can just do this:\n```\n@interface MyFormButtonCell : FXFormBaseCell\n@end\n@implementation MyFormButtonCell\n\n(id)init\n{\n    return [self initWithStyle:UITableViewCellStyleDefault reuseIdentifier:nil];\n}\n\n@end \n```\nThen if your field description, pass\n{\n    FXFormFieldCell: [MyFormButtonCell class]\n    @\"textLabel.textAlignment\": @(NSTextAlignmentCenter)\n}\nAnd it should work\n. I've added an FXFormFieldPlaceholder value that can be used in the same way as this.\nIf there's anything that FXFormFieldNilOption does that FXFormFieldPlaceholder doesn't, let me know, otherwise I think we can close this.\n. Hmm, ok. I'm not crazy about the idea of having both, but I'll keep thinking about it.\n. It's partly the name and partly the extra complexity. I'm hoping the same requirement can be solved another way, e.g. by using NSNull values or something, but i'm drawing a blank right now.\n. Yes, exactly. The valueTransformer feature added in 1.1 would let you format the NSNull however you want, but it's certainly not as elegant as the solution you've suggested from an end-user implementation point of view, especially if all the other values don't need transforming.\n. I've expanded the capabilities of the FXFormFieldPlaceholder to include the additional behaviour that the FXFormFieldNilOption had. I think this is a reasonable approach. Let me know if this solves your requirement.\n. Yeah, I know exactly what you mean, and I had the same thought.\nBut the problem with having two different properties is that they also overlap; for example, should a placeholder image in the FXFormImageCell be a nilOption or a placeholder value?\nI think perhaps the mistake here is that I use the placeholder for the detail label value in fields that have a disclosure arrow - maybe I just shouldn't do that.\nFortunately, it's fairly easy to override that, so I think I can live with it for now.\nThanks for your work on this, and the thoughtful feedback. I'm sorry I didn't merge your PR, but hopefully you don't feel the effort was wasted.\nI'll close this ticket now, but feel free to reopen it if you think of anything else.\n. Looks good, thanks.\n. If you change a form field value, you just need to call reloadData on the tableView, or reloadRowAtIndexPath if you just want to reload that cell.\nIf your change affects the field layout, you need to call the formController.form setter first, and then call reloadData on the tableView.\nI appreciate that this is a bit clunky - if you have a better suggestion, I'd love to hear it.\n. Ah, I see. The problem is that it would be a violation of MVC principles to have the form update the view directly.\nThe best way to handle this is either to set up a KVO observer for your form fields from the view controller, or have your form broadcast an NSNotification whenever it changes a field, which could then be observed by the view controller. \n. cool - remember to remove the observer again in your dealloc ;-)\n. It's listed here: https://github.com/nicklockwood/FXForms/blob/master/FXForms/FXForms.h\nDo you have an old copy of FXForms? Note that the CocoaPods version is only at v 1.0.2 and this feature was added in 1.1 beta 4.\n. You don't have to, you can just point your pod file directly at the github repo if you want to use the latest build.\n. I don't have any particularly elegant solution to these types of problem right now, but it should be possible to implement as follows:\nFor any control that modifies the forms fields, you can either 1) add an action to the field that will be called on the view controller and tell it to reload the form, or a subset of the form (the action can be either a block or a selector to call on the view controller), or 2) add a KVO observer on the form itself that does the same.\nThe fields method of the form is called whenever the formController.forms property is set, so as an example, your switch action could do this:\n```\n- (void)allDaySwitchAction\n{\n    //reload form fields\n    self.formController.form = self.formController.form;\n//reload table\n[self.formController.tableView reloadData];\n\n}\n```\nThen, in the fields method of your form, return a different configuration depending on the value of the allDay property.\nIf you can think of a better way to do this, please let me know.\n. Probably a silly question, but have you checked that your callback is firing on the main thread?\n. This is exactly the scenario that I added the new FXFormFieldViewController property for in the 1.1 beta. This feature is not completely finished yet, but if you don't mind being a guinea pig, here's how it works :-)\nInstead of a property called cityViewController of type UIViewController, as you have now, make a property called city or type string (presumably it's a string) on your form model. Modify your cityViewController to implement the FXFormFieldViewController protocol, which basically just means adding a field property to it.\nNow, in the config dictionary for your city property, return this:\n@{ FXFormFieldKey : @\"city\", FXFormFieldViewController : @\"CityViewController\" },\nThat will tell FXForms that the city property should not be displayed as a textfield, but should instead display your custom view controller and pass it the field object. Your view controller can then set the field.value directly, which will set the city property on the original form.\nHope that makes sense.\n. Yes the FXFormFieldViewController value should be the class name of your view controller, not the name of a key on the form.\nYou no longer need to haves the searchCityViewController property on your form itself - using the FXFormFieldViewController on the selectedCity property replaces having the view controller be a property in its own right.\n. Hmm, ok we'll that looks correct to me, so it may be a bug. I'll take a look.\n. I've pushed an update that should fix your issues. I've included an example project that demonstrates using a custom controller for a field.\n. Your view controller has to conform to the <FXFormFieldViewController) protocol, so yes, the field has to be called field. Either redeclaring the field property in your form controller header or adding a manual synthesize is sufficient (you don't have to do both).\n. As Broich says, this is the standard behaviour for table views. \nWhilst it would theoretically be possible for me to override it, part of the point of creating your own form viewcontroller is so that you can deviate the FXFormViewController's behaviours, not have them imposed on you anyway.\nFWIW, if you look at the the FXFormViewController's source, you can see how I handle this there (I use [tableView selectRowAtIndexPath:nil animated:YES] on viewDidAppear IIRC)\n. You're right, the documentation could be clearer on that point. I think the behaviour is probably correct as is, but I'll leave this open until I've amended the docs.\n. I've updated the documentation to make this clearer\n. I'm not able to reproduce this either.\n. I think the best option in this case is to create the field conditionally, based on whether mail accounts are available (i.e. in the fields method, make that property conditional) or make the field for that controller be a button that displays the controller using its action method instead of being a property of type MFMailComposeViewController.\n. I wonder if a phone pad is the correct input for a phone number in practice. I think the phone pad is probably just suited for dialling interfaces rather than phone number input. Maybe it should be the alphanumeric keyboard instead?\n. Huh, so it is. Fair enough then.\n. You read it right; this was a bug introduced in 1.1. Fixed in 1.1.1.\n. That is true. It's by design, but I can see that it's probably not what you want in this case.\nIf you want to trigger an action when the value is set, you can do this by overriding the setter method for that value in your form.\nI'll think about whether there's a better way to implement this.\n. I made a few changes to the interface and extended to support controllers too, but this is now merged.\n. Your solution for 1) will work, although you can actually just call becomeFirstResponder directly on the cell and it will call becomeFirstResponder on the textField for you.\nI'm not sure what you mean by default text value. If you mean placeholder text, then use the FXFormFieldPlaceholder value. If you mean you actually want the form to set the text to a default value if the string is nil, you can do this in your form object with a \"lazy getter\" for the field value, e.g.\n```\n@implementation MyForm\n\n(NSString *)myField\n{\n    if (_myField == nil)\n    {\n        return @\"default value\";\n    }\n    return _myField;\n}\n\n@end\n```\n. You can set it with the @\"detailTextLabel.font\" keypath.\n. Hmm. It's hard to be certain, but I think the issue may be that the form object itself is an NSNull instance as opposed to the state property being nil.\nFXForms handles nil pointers just fine (in accordance with standard objective C practice), but It may well not cope with receiving an NSNull in place of a form.\nCan you investigate further and find out if this is the case? And if so, is this expected behaviour for CoreData (in which case FXForms should probably handle it gracefully) or the symptom of a bug in your app?\n. I can't see anything obvious that's wrong with it. Can you send me your project and I'll investigate?\nYou can email it to support at charcoaldesign dot co dot uk.\n. The problem seems to be that When FXForms encounters a nil form object, it instantiates it using alloc/init, which is not the correct way to create an NSManagedObject subclass.\nI'll see if I can find a better approach for this. It would be relatively easy to make a special case for Core Data objects, but it might be better to have a more flexible solution.\n. That might be easier for your case, although you'd have to override valueForUndefinedKey: and setValue:forUndefinedKey: on your form wrapper and pass those values to your core data model property.\nFXForms doesn't have any concept of edit mode at the moment - it's assumed that fields will always be in edit mode. Creating new objects is implicit (if you click on a nil field in your form, it will create a new object for it), which is why you're having the issue with null core data entities being initialised with the wrong constructor.\n. If you can explain how you'd like your form interface to work, I can use this as the basis for defining new functionality. Lack of real-world use cases (aka dogfooding) is always a problem when designing features for a library.\n. I've made an update that prevents FXForms trying to instantiate NSManagedObjects if they are null, which should hopefully fix the crashing.\nThe scenario you've described should work fine if you use a custom form controller and detect if the field value is nil, then show a new or edit button accordingly.\nLet me know if you run into any more problems (or if the original problem has not been solved).\n. Action methods only propagate up the responder chain, so if the delegate isn't a super view or parent controller of the form view controller it won't work.\nIt might be simpler in this case to use a block for your action instead of a selector.\n. The : in the selector is optional, just as it is with IBActions. But if you include the : in the selector, you have to include a parameter in your method as well. If you don't need the sender, you don't need the colon.\n. If you're using an action block to load a view controller, you'll need some way to get a reference to the controller from within your form, which is likely to be kind of horrible from a structural point of view.\nProbably your best bet is to post an NSNotification in your form that is observed by your view controller and triggers the action.\n. Yes, you need an FXFormFieldKey for virtual fields, otherwise valueForKey:/setValue:forKey: won't be called on your form object, and there will be no way to get/set the value.\nIf the field doesn't have a value (e.g. if it's a button or a custom cell with hard-coded content) then you don't need a key.\n. If you look in the BasicExample project there is a Submit button that shows how this is done.\n. Yes, just create a custom cell class containing a button, and use that with the FXForFieldCell property.\n. You can implement the button action as follows:\n- (void)buttonAction:(id)sender\n{\n    if (self.field.action) self.field.action(self);\n}\nThis will then call the standard action selector or block for your field, so you can implement the button action in the same way as shown in the BasicExample project.\n. BTW, If you've added this cell inside FXForms, I suggest you define it in a separate class inside your own project. Instead of overloading the private setUp method, you can just use the normal init method for UITableViewCell, like this:\n- (id)initWithStyle:(UITableViewCellStyle)style reuseIdentifier:(NSString *)reuseIdentifier\n{\n    if ((self = [super initWithStyle:style reuseIdentifier:reuseIdentifier]))\n    {\n        //do your setup\n    }\n    return self;\n}\n. FYI, I've added an example for how to do this to the examples folder. My example uses a nib, but you can do it with code if you prefer.\n. That should work fine. I think you must have inadvertently changed the name of the method or the selector string (if that's a direct copy of the error you got, it looks like the colon is missing from the end of the selector name in the form field configuration).\n. In answer to your first question, about customising buttons, if you make the button a property of your cell, you can customise its properties using keypaths, the same way you can set the textLabel properties, etc.\n. It's not standard behaviour for cells to deselect themselves. I was attempting to follow the standard iOS pattern.\n. Dd you try adding @\"textField.keyboardType\": @(UIKeyboardTypeDecimalPad) to your field dictionary?\n. UITextView doesn't implement any placeholder functionality. I'll have to build something custom. I'll add this to the list for v1.2.\n. I've added this in 1.1.4.\n. The return value of the fields / extraFields method can vary at runtime. You could have an isNewInstance (or whatever) property on the form that toggles the inclusion of the delete button in the fields array.\n. If you come up with a better approach, or you can think of a way you'd like it to work, let me know.\nSomething I'm considering for a future update is to allow fields to be customised via the FXFormControllerDelegate, rather than  methods on the form. Would that work better for you?\n. Yes, I'm aware of this issue. It's on the todo list.\n. 1. No, not currently. I'm investigating a solution for this for the next release.\n2. I'm not 100% sure this is possible. You would need to create a cell subclass that can display a custom data type that encapsulates both the image and text, and register that cell as the default for FXFormFieldTypeOption, but I can't guarantee that you won't need to make additional changes to the library to make this work. I'll investigate.\n. if you implement the methods -valueForUndefinedKey: and -setValue:forUndefinedKey: on your form object, you can use these to set and get the values from your database. \n. The setValue:forUndefinedKey: will automatically be called on your form object with the value of the text field when the textfield resigns first responder. If the user presses submit while the keyboard is still visible, the value may not have been updated yet, so it's a good idea to dismiss the keyboard in your submit button action before saving the data in your database.\n. FXFormTextFieldCell adjusts the textfield frame in layoutSubviews, so it's probably positioning the left-hand edge back underneath your image.\nTry this:\n- (void)layoutSubviews\n{\n    [super layoutSubviews]\n    self.textField.frame = CGRectMake(58, 10, 254, 30);\n}\nIn general though, this is a bit fragile because it makes assumptions about how FXFormTextFieldCell works that may change in future. It would probably be better if I called the setUp method from within awakeFromNib so that you don't have to create it yourself.\nI'll look at changing that in the next version.\n. For now, it might be easier to subclass FXFormBaseCell instead, and copy the FXFormTextFieldCell implementation into your own class. I'll look at a way to make this easier in the next release.\n. Mean you give an example? It should be possible to implement the text field cell using only public properties of FXFormField and FXFormBaseCell.\n. Oh, I see. Yeah, you can't copy it exactly, but you can just put in hard-coded values for those - the functions are only because I need to support multiple OS-version targets without warnings.\n. This is now possible. Also, see the note in the README about the distinction between FXFormBaseCell and FXFormDefaultCell.\n. It's probably a stupid question, but are you sure the address value of your form isn't nil?\n. Ah, yeah. Sorry, didn't think of that explanation. I should probably make it resign responder automatically when you press a button.\n. I don't think there's any way to do this other than manually resigning the responder.\n. It should be possible to do this with a custom action method or cell.\n. You can call [navigationController popViewControllerAnimated:] - would that work?\n. Yeah, I think you'd have to do it like that, which I guess is a little awkward. Let me think about this a bit more.\n. This should be fixed now in 1.1.4\n. This should be fixed now in 1.1.4\n. This isn't a bug, but I can see why it's confusing.\nThe values returned by the form has nothing to do with the enum, it's just the index of the option you select. Enums have no runtime representation - they're just a convenient way of representing constants, but there's no way for FXForms to know what values you've used.\nIf you want non-zero-based, non-sequential option values, you can specify that actual numbers as your FXFormFieldOptions and then use a valueTransformer to convert them to strings, like this:\n{FXFormFieldOptions: @[@(GenderMale), @(GenderFemale), @(GenderOther)],\n FXFormFieldValueTransformer: ^(id input) {\n        return @{@(GenderMale): @\"Male\",\n                       @(GenderFemale): @\"Female\",\n                       @(GenderOther): @\"Other\"}[input];\n }};\n. Nothing yet, as there are a few other issues to tackle first. If you have any suggestions though, I'd be interested to hear them.\nIt seems like I should probably try to tie into the KVC model validation mechanism used by Core Data, but it's not an area I'm very familiar with.\n. This is something I'm planning for the next version, but I haven't started work on it yet.\nThe idea would be that you'd have an FXFormFieldTemplate attribute that would describe the properties of each field, and then the field would be represented as a section with the ability to add/remove and reorder items.\n. Now implemented in 1.2 beta 2\n. I've been considering ways to make this easier, but in the meantime I'll add an example of how to do this when I get a chance.\n. @mrs1987 no, you don't need to do that. You just need to return different options in your fields array based on the current values of the form, and reload the form whenever a value changes that would affect the fields structure.\nIf your options are dynamic, it probably doesn't make sense to use an enum for the values - just use an integer, or the actual option value type (e.g NSString).\n. @mrs1987 Looking at your specific problem, I think here's how you should solve it:\nIn your form object:\n```\n@implementation ProductSelectionForm\n\n\n(NSDictionary *)productList\n{\n    return @{FXFormFieldOptions: @[@\"Juice\", @\"Water\", @\"Coffee\"],\n             FXFormFieldAction: @\"productListChanged\"};\n}\n\n\n(NSDictionary )productOptionsField\n{\n    NSMutableDictionary details = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];\n    details[FXFormFieldOptions] = @[@\"Option1\", @\"Option2\", @\"Option3\"];\n    if (self.productList == Coffee)\n    {\n        //only allow single-selection\n        return @{FXFormFieldType: FXFormFieldTypeInteger}\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        //allow multi-selection\n        return @{FXFormFieldType: FXFormFieldTypeBitfield}\n    }\n    return details;\n}  \n\n\n@end\n```\nAnd in your view controller:\n```\n@implementation ProductSelectionFormViewController\n\n(void)productListChanged\n{\n    self.formController.form = self.productSelectionForm;\n    [self.tableView reloadData];\n}\n\n@end\n```\nHope that makes sense.\nNote, this will only work if you have 3 options in your productOptions field (as you do in your example). If you have 4 options, option 4 would have an enum value of 4 when it's in bitfield mode and 3 when it's in single-selection mode so it wouldn't quite work unless a different approach is used.\n. I've included a dependent fields example in the latest release, including a couple of fixes that are required to make it work as expected.\n. It might be better to add an action to the limitStorageSize field instead of reloading the table from within the setter.\nI'm not sure what's causing the crash, but the use of manual retain/release means it could be a lot of subtle things.\n. This is controlled by the value set in the form object. It should be working, but if not let me know.\n. You'd have a property called \"province\" on your form object that is an NSString, and if you set its value to \"B\" then option \"B\" in the picker should automatically be selected when the form is displayed.\n. If you mean helper text, you can use the FXFormFieldPlaceholder value. If you mean an actual default value, just set the default values in the init method of your form object, as you would for any ordinary object.\n. Try this instead:\n@\"detailTextLabel.font\": kFontNormal(14)};\n. Yes, this is actually the documented approach for customising cells.\n. Looks very cool! It will take a little while to review though I'm afraid :-)\n. Yeah, I did intend FXFormFieldTemplate to work a bit differently, but I'll see if your approach makes more sense.\n. Sorry for the much overdue response to this. I've now added basic support for templates collection fields. There is no doubt a lot more to do (e.g. setting maximum item count), but hopefully this meets at least some of your requirements.\nI'm sorry that I didn't end up using your approach in the end, but hopefully you'll agree that the template system I've used is quite flexible and intuitive.\nIf there's anything urgent missing from this solution, let me know. I would also certainly be interested in incorporating any additional functionality you developed, such as the key/value cell. \n. Sorry for not responding sooner - I didn't think there was much point adding Travis until I'd actually written some tests.\nI've now added Travis support, including some tests!\n. Hmm\u2026 the lack of support for negative numbers does seem like a bit of a dealbreaker.\n. You can style almost any property of the cell by adding properties with the correct keypath in your field configuration dictionary. Eg. to change the font of the cell title, use\n@\"textLabel.font\"\nas the key.\n. I just tried it and the only leak I saw was 64KB leaked by the UIImagePickerController (which seems to be an Apple bug).\n. OK, I've taken a look. It's not actually a retain cycle. The problems seems to be that UITableView caches all created cells up to a certain maximum, so because I'm not recycling them the tableview is storing a large pool of useless objects.\nThis isn't a permanent leak. If you dismiss the view controller then the memory is reclaimed, and if you reload the tableview enough times, eventually it will start releasing cells once it reaches its internal cache limit.\nIt's not ideal though. I'll look at a better strategy in the next update that lets it recycle the cells. It occurs to me that using the field key as the identifier might work, although it may cause problems for forms that modify fields dynamically.\n. Indeed. I don't really want to add the cognitive load of an extra key though. I suppose I could make the key field mandatory, or create a hash for each field based on all the properties of the field dictionary.\n. Maybe something like key ?: title + cellClass is sufficient. It's hard to be certain how people are using them.\n. Why did you close the ticket? Found a workaround?\n. I've implemented a hybrid between your two solutions. Thanks!\n. You need to reassign the formController.form and then reload the tableView in order to update a field.\n. It's working for me in the BasicExample project. Can you clarify what you mean by showing an incorrect value?\n(Note: it was broken in an earlier release, so make sure you're using 1.1.6 or later).\n. Yes. The valueTransformer property is usually only needed if the bitmask values aren't sequential.\n. I've added this in the latest beta\n. There is now a \"phone\" field type that uses the phone pad.\n. You can add a custom action block or selector to the last field in the form.\n. This should now be fixed.\n. Sorry for the delay - just waiting until I get a chunk of time to review this and start work on the next big update.\n. I think this is an issue with UITextField in general, rather than a problem with FXForms.\n. In that case, I guess you can fix it by left-aligning the textfield, which you can do by adding the following to your field dictionary:\n- (NSDictionary *)myField {\n    return @{@\"textField.textAlignment\", @(NSTextAlignmentLeft)};\n}\n. Currently there's no way to enforce this other than to check when the form is submitted and display an alert telling the user to select fewer options. \n. Ah, good point.\n. I've added support for reverse transforms in the latest beta.\n. I'm OK with this idea, but there are a few problems with the implementation that's stopping me from merging it as it stands:\n1) It should be optional - the way this is implemented means that all form fields will get this feature. No Apple forms actually use this toolbar approach - it's used exclusively in web-based forms in Safari, so really it's kind of nonstandard, which means it's not something I would want to force on everyone.\nI need to think of a good way to expose an option to enabled/disable this feature. I don't currently have a mechanism for this kind of from-wide configuration, and I want to add it in a way that will scale for other features\n2) This PR declares a couple of private Apple UI constants, for reasons that aren't entirely clear to me. This seems fragile and possibly risks rejection if that gets flagged as private API usage.\n. This is implemented as of beta 10.\n. You can supply your own UIViewController class using the FXFormFieldViewController key. If you create a subclass of FXFormViewController and set its title in the viewDidLoad method, then supply that class as the FXFormFieldViewController for your field, it should work.\n. I agree, it's not very convenient.\nNow that I think about it, an easier approach would  be to use the FXFormFieldTitle key to specify your view controller's title, and then override the title displayed in the cell using \"textLabel.text\".\n. It depends what you mean by \"change\".\nIf you want to push another form onto the navigation controller, you can just push that as you would with any normal view controller.\nIf you want to load a different form in the sane controller, just set your new form object on your formController, then call reloadData on the tableView.\n. This is expected behaviour (it's how any ordinary textfield/button would work in iOS).\nYou can fix it by resigning the first responder in your button action.\nI can make it so that the responder is resigned automatically when you press a button cell in the form, and perhaps I should, but I'm concerned that would just be masking the issue - for example, if you pressed a button outside of the form, you'd still have the same issue.\nAnother option would be to update the form values live as you edit, but the problem with that is that the field action would either have to be called after every key press, or you might have a situation where the value changes but the action is never called.\nThoughts?\n. That isn't necessary - you can resign the first responder just by calling [tableView endEditing:YES];\n. This is fixed in beta 3\n. Yes, you can add and remove or modify fields dynamically. Have a look at the dependent fields example for how to do this.\n. To make the value appear, you need to ensure that the value in the dynamic form dictionary is an NSNumber with value of zero, not nil.\n. They would have been, but unfortunately, neither of those pads support negative numbers.\n. I was considering adding FXFormTypeUnsignedInteger and doing that. That also has the benefit that I can detect that type automatically from the property.\n. I've added a FXFormFieldTypeUnsigned type that uses a number pad by default. This type will automatically be used for properties of type NSUInteger, or equivalent.\n. I like this idea a lot, but it seems very hard to generalise (i.e. to make it work without dictating the field keys or types for the form).\nThe problem with using a dictionary is that its unordered, which makes it hard to use with templates fields (I currently only support ordered collections for this reason).\nOne option would be to introduce a concrete FXForm class called something like FXKeyValueForm that contains hard-coded key and value fields of the correct type and is designed to work with the FXFormKeyValueCell.\nAnother option would be to make FXKeyValueForm a protocol, but then the developer would have to do quite a lot of work to set up such a form (perhaps it should be both a protocol AND a class, to provide maximum flexibility and minimum effort).\n. The form always knows (or guesses) the class of the collection values based on the FXFormFieldClass key in the template, so that shouldn't be a problem. Instantiating the value automatically is still a problem though, without having an equivalent to your newInstanceFor.\n. Sorry this is taking a while to fix. It turns out that handling nil values in a templates form is incredibly complicated, given that nil may actually be a legitimate value (e.g. if the field is multiple choice with a placeholder value).\nI think your approach of having the form instantiate and cleanup objects makes sense, but I'm going to tackle making nil values work correctly first.\n. OK, I believe I've fixed all the crashes.\n. Actually I was already thinking along the same lines. If the FXFormControllerDelegate protocol replicated the methods available on the FXForm protocol then it would be possible to use existing objects as form models without having to subclass them.\n. This is fixed in latest beta.\n. If you just leave the view controller in our storyboard empty, and set up the code for the controller the same way as it is done in the basic example, you shouldn't have to do anything else.\n. (That's assuming you set the superclass of your view controller to be FXFormViewController, as it is in the example)\n. I'll see if I can rustle up an example tomorrow.\n. OK, I've added a storyboard example, and also included some new features to make using storyboards easier, such as support for UIStoryboardSegues\n. Despite the reference to arm64 in the error, FXForms works fine on arm64 when using Objective-C, so I think it's unlikely that the architecture has anything to do with it. Hopefully just a beta bug in the Swift compiler, but I'll look into it.\nAs a side-note, it's nice to see FXForms still works well in Swift - I wasn't sure if the automatic property introspection would function correctly, since Swift doesn't have the same kind of runtime support - but I guess as long as you are subclassing NSObject for your form objects then declared properties are still inspectable?\n. Try importing the FXForms.h/m files into your project directly. They don't have any dependencies or unusual compiler requirements.\n. Yep, I like that idea.\n. That's odd - I thought I fixed this in the latest beta.\n. If you are using CocoaPods, try linking directly against the podspec in this repo instead of using the public spec. I've added quite a lot of stuff in the 1.2 beta that isn't in the most recent stable release. \n. Problem 1 is a design issue. If you have an index-based options field, and you select an option that isn't in the list (\"None\") then the index is set to NSNotFound (2147483648). Arguably it should be nil if the type is NSNumber and not NSInteger, but for consistency it currently uses NSNotFound for both.\nProblem 2 is not a bug. The default value of NSNumber is nil, which is treated as \"no value\". The default value of an NSInteger is 0, so it matches index zero in the list (the first item). You have to set it to NSNotFound in your init method if you want no item to be selected.\nProblem 3 sounds like a genuine bug. I'll take a look.\n. OK, in the latest update, options values of type NSNumber should be nil if the value is out of range (it will still be NSNotFound for NSInteger fields). That should fix Problem 1.\nI couldn't reproduce the crash mentioned in Problem 2, let me know if you're still seeing that. Option types of NSInteger will still default to option 1 though, as that's by design.\nI couldn't reproduce the bug in Problem 3, perhaps that was fixed by one of the other changes?\n. Sorry, the NSUnknownKeyException was an unrelated bug introduced in the last update, now fixed.\nStill can't see Problem 3 though - can you paste in the complete source for your form object (or whatever subset is needed to reproduce this problem)?\n. OK, I figured out what the problem with #3 was. Fixed in latest beta.\n. Sorry, that was an incomplete refactoring job on my part. Your fix is valid for the old way indexing was handled, but the new way avoids a lot of code duplication. Now fixed.\n. Whoops, sorry about that. Fixed.\n. Actually that's not quite right. You set the default value by just setting the property in your form object (e.g in init). Otherwise all values default to nil, which will display the placeholder if there is one.\n. I don't understand what you mean by that. There is no such thing as an \"enum type\" - at runtime an enum is just an integer.\n. @kbala assuming you are using the approach from the dynamic fields example, to set default values in your JSON, add a dictionary of default values by key and use it to populate the valuesByKey dictionary.\nI'm investigating whether there is a more convenient approach that can be used.\n. @batkru Ah, I understand the confusion. There was a bug causing the gender field to show up as a text field instead of a selection box. This is now fixed.\n@kbala I've now added an option called FXFormDefaultValue that can be used to set the default value in the field dictionary. This should make it simpler for you to set defaults for dynamic forms using JSON.\n. That's because the field type is NSDate, and FXForms doesn't convert a default value of type NSString to NSDate (it couldn't really do this, since there is more than one way to represent a date as a string).\nYou'll have to parse the default value to an NSDate yourself before passing the dictionary to FXForms.\n. I'm planning to at some point. For now you can set the field type to @\"label\" to make it read only.\n. This is a peculiar edge case, caused by the fact that \"class\" is a standard method of NSObject.\nEither use a different key, or change:\n- (id)valueForUndefinedKey:(NSString *)key\n{\n    return self.valuesByKey[key];\n}\nTo\n- (id)valueForKey:(NSString *)key\n{\n    return self.valuesByKey[key];\n}\nWhich, seems to work OK, although it may have some weird side effects later that I haven't thought of.\n. Good point - I'll look into that.\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. How are you setting them? By directly manipulating the cell.textField.text property?\n. OK, I've fixed it.\n. Glad you've found it useful :-)\n. If your form is just an ordinary class, you can set the properties directly. After setting properties, call reloadData on the tableView to refresh the table.\nIf you are using a dynamic form, use setValue:forKey: as you suggested, but remember to reload the tableView afterwards.\n. Sorry, I must have misunderstood what you are trying to do. If you want to set the default value, you can just use the FXFormFieldDefaultValue key.\n. Can you try again with the latest beta? When I paste that exact fields method into the DynamicForms example form it works fine.\n. There's a FXFormFieldDefaultValue you can use, or just set the value in the form object itself.\n. No, you should do it like this:\nreturn @{FXFormFieldKey: @\"yourEmail\", FXFormFieldDefaultValue: userEmail}\nSetting the the textField.text value directly won't store the value in the form, so if the user doesn't modify it, the value might not be saved and could be left as nil.\n. Setting the textField.text value is the wrong way to do that anyway (see my comment in the other thread), but in any case, the easiest way to do this is simply to set the form values directly:\nYourAccountForm *form = [[YourAccountForm alloc] init];\n[form setValue:someDefaultValue forKey:@\"someKey\"];\n...\n//then assign the form to the controller\ncontroller.formController.form = form;\n. Your form either needs to have properties matching the keys you are trying to set, or your need to set it up as a dynamic form by following the implementation design used in the DynamicForm example.\n. No problem.\n. Thanks. Fixed in b9.\n. Thanks. Fixed.\n. There's no way to do this right now except by creating a custom cell class and registering it as the cell to be used by FXFormFieldTypeOption. \nThe options lists just use regular UITableViewCells, which don't support multi-line labels.\n. The only reason that I haven't done so is that I can't currently see a use case for it. Generally you are interested in either displaying the option (for which you can use optionDescriptionAtIndex) or finding out the actual selected value of the field, for which you can use field.value.\nI can see that if the field values were something like colors, it would be useful to be able to display these using custom cells that displayed the actual color. I think that currently, implementing that would involve more than just having access to the field option value though - you'd also need some way to specify that you wanted to use a different cell type for that option, and then make the underlying options field available to the cell, which currently just sees the options as boolean values on the FXOptionsForm.\nSo basically I'd need to re-architect the way options fields are handled in order for the option value to be useful. If you have any suggestions for how that might work, I'd be interested.\n. But where would you call that method from in your code? The option cell doesn't have access to the original form field - it uses a proxy field. You can get to the original field from the proxy, but only by calling private methods.\n. Ah, so you're building a custom controller for selecting the field? Now I understand.\n. OK, I've exposed this method.\n. You can register a custom cell class to use for fields of type FXFormFieldTypeOption using the registerViewControllerClass:forFieldType: method of FXFormController, and then handle the display of the title value differently. I'm not sure if that would meet your requirements.\n. Ha ha, my time isn't that valuable ;-)\n. Why does this cause a retain cycle? The form doesn't have a reference its fields.\n. Yes, if the cellPhone property is an array, set the array value directly, e.g.\n[form setValue:@[@\"Nokia Lumia\", @\"Galaxy Nexus\", @\"iPhone 5s\"] forKey:@\"cellPhone\"];\n. Sorry, I think I misunderstood the question.\nWhat is it that you are trying to do? set the FXFormFieldOptions for the form field in the view controller instead of the form object?\nWhy don't you want to set them in the form object?\n. Why not just return a different value from the FXFormFieldOptions in the form object based on the result from your web API? Why does it need to be set in controller?\n. You can set it in the controller, but the property itself should belong to the form. E.g. you could do something like this:\n```\n@interface MyForm \n@property (nonatomic, copy) NSString resortName;\n@property (nonatomic, copy) NSArray resortOptions;\n@end\n@implementation MyForm \n\n\n(NSDictionary *)resortNameField\n{\n    return @{FXFormFieldOptions: resortOptions ?: @[]}\n}\n\n\n(NSArray *)excludedFields\n{\n    return @\"resortOptions\";\n}\n\n\n@end\n```\nThat will let you set the resortOptions from your controller, like this:\nself.form.resortOptions = //downloaded resorts array\nself.formController.form = self.form;\n[self.tableView reloadData];\n. Yes, fixed in latest FXForms beta.\n. Use :head as the version in your podfile.\n. Currently there's no simple solution for this. The best approach is probably to create two proxy form objects that talk to the underlying NSManagedObject in the same way that the DynamicFieldsExample form talks to a dictionary.\n. The plan is to make field customisation available via the delegate, rather than having to add methods to the form object itself. I'm not sure when I'll get round to that though.\n. I'll update the pod when 1.2 is out of beta. CocoaPods doesn't currently have a way to submit pods for beta versions.\n. Your best bet is just to create a normal numeric field (e.g. using FXFormFieldTypeUnsigned) and then add @\"textField.secureTextEntry\": @YES to the field dictionary.\n. I'll consider whether there is a better approach for secure text fields - it's not an issue that has arisen before so I don't know that it's worth a huge amount of refactoring to fix it. Checking for FXFormFieldTypePassword and @\"textField.secureTextEntry\" should be the only cases you have to deal with. You could optionally create a new type \"FormFieldTypeNumericPassword\" and a custom cell to handle it if you prefer.\nThe code is all in one file because of the how C/Objective-C handles privacy. Currently the components rely on talking to each other's private methods, and there's no particularly elegant way to do this across multiple files (private categories is an option I'm considering). Swift appears to do nothing to improve this, and actually removes the private category option so I expect this pattern to continue. I don't consider having all code in one file to be a big issue as long as class responsibilities are separated.\nI don't have a specific date planned for 1.2 release. Features are mostly locked down now, so once I'm happy that it's stable I'll release it.\n. Can you paste the full code of how you enumerated the field? It sounds like it was enumerating the fields of the options subfotm instead of the root form.\n. Ah, interesting. The FXFormFieldInline is the cause here. I guess this is unexpected behavior, but it may be a little tricky to fix, since it's technically behaving correctly; those are the keys for the fields displayed at those index paths in the form, and if I return the non-inlined field instead then the indexPaths won't match the tableview, which may also be unexpected behavior.\n. Sorry, already fixed this a while ago, just forgot to push it for some reason.\n. You need to include FXFormFieldKey: @\"domain\" in the dictionary if you want to return it from the -fields array, otherwise FXForms doesn't know which field it relates to (it works when it's a standalone method because it infers the key from the domainField method name).\n. I would argue that tapping (or scrolling) elsewhere on screen is a good way to dismiss it ;-)\n. Seems reasonable. Implemented in 1.2.8.\n. Sorry, I missed the part about changing the color, but I'm not sure hard-coding a color like this is appropriate anyway. Maybe it could use the tintColor instead though or something?\n. I guess this could be a configuration option in the form. I'll think about it.\n. It's possible to do all of your cell styling in IB, although currently it's necessary to create a custom cell class for each distinct cell.xib (although the class need not do anything except extend FXFormBaseCell).\nCan you paste in some examples of the classes you've had to write? It may be that in some cases there was a better way, but in the cases where there wasn't, I'll see if I can improve the API.\n. I'll need a bit more context. Is it a dynamic form? What properties have you included in the field dictionary?\n. Try the latest update. It should now treat empty text values as nil for fields of type NSNumber.\n. Have a look at the DynamicFieldsExample - it shows how to create a form from a JSON file.\n. You'll need to download the list as JSON using NSURLSession, and then set it as the options in your form fields dictionary.\n. I'm adding support for this in the next version, but FWIW you can customise the header and footer views using the UITableViewDelegate methods in your view controller, as normal.\n. Headers aren't cells, they're ordinary views. Just create a UILabel with the attributes and text that you want and set it as the FXFormFieldHeader of the field.\n. Note: There's currently no way for FXForms to set the text of custom headers automatically, so you'll need to set the text yourself for each header you create. You can always simplify that by creating a custom view class with a constructor, e.g. [MyHeaderView viewWithTitle:someString]\n. You can't set headers in JSON unless you create a separate class for each header, which would be a PiTA. I suggest you use the FXFormDelegate instead.\nYou don't need to add anything to your JSON, unless you want to modify the title text of the header. If you do, just add\n\"header\": \"Some long title / description text to add to the form and tell the user what the next part is all about\"\nto the dictionary for the first field in the section where you want it to appear.\nTo customise the font, etc, add a method like this to your form view controller:\n```\n- (UIView )tableView:(UITableView )tableView viewForHeaderInSection:(NSInteger)section\n{\n    NSString title = [(id)self.formController tableView:tableView titleForHeaderInSection:section];\n    if ([title length])\n    {\n        UILabel label = [[UILabel alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(10, 5, tableView.frame.size.width - 20, 18)];\n        label.text = title;\n        label.font = [UIFont boldSystemFontOfSize:12];\n        label.textColor = [UIColor redColor];\n        [label sizeToFit];\n    UIView *view = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, tableView.frame.size.width, label.frame.size.height + 10)];\n    view.backgroundColor = [UIColor greenColor];\n    [view addSubview:label];\n    return view;\n}\nreturn nil;\n\n}\n\n(CGFloat)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView heightForHeaderInSection:(NSInteger)section\n{\n    return [self tableView:tableView viewForHeaderInSection:section].frame.size.height;\n}\n```\n. Add the \"header\": \"Whatever text I want\" to the first field in the section it relates to - don't put it in a field on its own. i.e., do it like this:\n\n```\n{\"header\": \"Whatever text I want\",\n \"key\": \"field1\",\n \"title\": \"field 1\",\n\"type\": \"integer\"},\n{\"key\": \"field2\",\n \"title\": \"field 2\",\n\"type\": \"text\"},\n```\n. Alternatively, if you just want an ordinary cell full of text that you can style, use a cell of \"type\": \"label\" instead, then you can customise it however you want in the normal way using keypaths.\n. Yes, that's true. You'll probably need to create a custom cell, as you originally suggested.\nI'll look into making multiline text work with FXFormFieldTypeLabel, as that would be a simpler solution.\n. I think removing readonly properties altogether is too blunt, as it can be useful for things like label fields or info pages. For now, I've eliminated just those properties.\n. This question is a bit confusing. I'm not sure why you've overridden -fields, -extraFields and -excludedFields instead of just returning _dynamicFields from the -fields method.\nAlso, if you are using Swift, why not define your ApplicationForm class in Swift instead of Objective-C? As long as it's a subclass of NSObject, it should work fine.\nThe solution to adding options to your dynamic fields should be to just add the Male/Female/etc options into your JSON file. There are several examples of how to specify options fields in JSON in the DynamicFieldsExample.\n. Note: for the example you've given, you shouldn't need to use FXFormFieldValueTransformer as the values are simple strings. If you find that do need to use a value transformer, let me know as that's a bit more complex.\n. You need to override valueForKey: and setValue:forKey: in your form object (see the DynamicFieldsExample for details) otherwise FXForms cannot record the state of the field.\n. You don't really need the cell in this case, it was only being used to look up the form. You can just do this instead:\n```\n- (IBAction)barBtnSave:(UIBarButtonItem )sender\n{\n    //I'm assuming that the barBtnSave method is in your form view controller - if it's somewhere\n    //else then you'll need to get the form via a different route\n    RegistrationForm form = self.formController.form;\n//we can then perform validation, etc\nif (form.agreedToTerms)\n{\n    [[[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@\"Registration Form Submitted\" message:nil delegate:nil cancelButtonTitle:nil otherButtonTitles:@\"OK\", nil] show];\n}\nelse\n{\n    [[[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@\"User Error\" message:@\"Please agree to the terms and conditions before proceeding\" delegate:nil cancelButtonTitle:nil otherButtonTitles:@\"Yes Sir!\", nil] show];\n}\n\n}\n```\n. You may need to resign the responder on the form. You can do that by calling [formViewController.view setEditing:NO];\n. Yes, this is fixed in the latest beta.\n. Just use :head, or link directly to the pod spec inside the repository. It will be published normally once it's out of beta.\n. Interesting. I think the problem may be that the value isn't being stored, not that the cell is being recycled, but I need to verify.\n. Yeah, so it looks like the problem is that you've not implemented any way to store the dynamic values in your form object. You'd normally do that by overriding the valueForUndefinedKey: and setValueForUndefinedKey: methods and then storing the values in a dictionary (have a look at the DynamicFieldsExample to see what I mean).\nBecause you aren't storing the values anywhere, when the cells are re-created, the value is lost.\nIt's not ideal that FXForms fails silently here: It should probably throw an exception when you try to set a value on a form that it can't store, but other than that it seems to be working correctly.\n. You can include arbitrary key/value pairs in the field dictionary, provided that they match up with a property of the UITableViewCell. So @\"accessibilityLabel\": @\"Foo\" should work for setting a cell's accessibility label.\nI don't think there's currently a way to do this for the fields in an options subform.\n. Currently, I dismiss the keyboard on scroll deliberately because it's the expected behaviour as of iOS 7, and many keyboard variants cannot be dismissed any other way as they don't have a close button.\nI guess I could look at making this a configurable option.\n. You can add an action for when the value in a field changes (which is usually triggered when the done button is pressed). You do that using the FXFormFieldAction key, which can be either a block or the name of a method on your controller.\n. I've added this fix in 1.2.1\n. This is already possible. Just add the FXFormFieldInline option to the field dictionary.\n. Oh, I see. Currently that feature doesn't exist. Interesting idea though.\n. Thanks for flagging this. Fixed in 1.2.1.\n. Yes, you may need to resign the responder manually. FXForms only resigns the responder automatically when you tap a cell, so if the button is not inside a cell then the currently editing value may not yet have been committed to the form when you press it.\n. The FXFormFieldDefaultValue is only intended for use with values that are nillable. A BOOL can only be true or false, so FXForms has no way of knowing if the value has already been set.\nThere are couple of options you could take:\n1) In the init method of your form object, set the value to YES (this is the general way to set default values)\n1) Use an NSNumber for your property instead of a BOOL. That way, if it's nil, FXForms can set it to YES automatically if you set the FXFormFieldDefaultValue to @YES.\n. You can create your own Cell subclass that uses this control, and then register it as the default cell for handling strings.\n. Ooh, nice. I didn't know about that constant.\n. Sorry, this was a bug. Should be fixed in 1.2.1\n. I'm unclear what you mean by  headers and footers now being implicit. Can you send me a screenshot of how your controller looks now, and how it looked before with the older version of FXForms so I can get some idea what the problem is?\n. If you are just trying to get rid of the header text, you can use { FXFormFieldHeader: @\"\" }, but that won't get rid of the gap.\n. @ninokierulf I suspect the effect you're describing is just the normal appearance of tableviews in group mode. You can supply your own tableview created with UITableViewStylePlain to get rid of the gap.\n. This doesn't seem like an FXForms issue. Are you maybe using some iOS8-only feature in your storyboard?\n. no problem :-)\n. Try setting the image to nil on your form and then reloading the tableView.\n. There was a bug in version 1.2.1 that was party responsible for this not working. That's fixed in 1.2.2.\nThe other part is that you need to specify the form types because Swift doesn't provide that information at runtime like objective C for some reason. You can do that like this:\n```\nclass SettingsForm: NSObject, FXForm {\n    var userProfile: UserProfileForm\n    var legal: LegalForm = LegalForm()\ninit(user: User) {\n    self.userProfile = UserProfileForm(user: user)\n}\n\nfunc userProfileField() -> FXFormFieldDictionary {\n    return [\n        FXFormFieldClass: userProfile.dynamicType,\n        FXFormFieldInline: true\n    ]\n}\n\nfunc legalField() -> FXFormFieldDictionary {\n    return [\n        FXFormFieldClass: legal.dynamicType,\n        FXFormFieldInline: true\n    ]\n}\n\n}\n```\n. By the way, you can get rid of these two methods:\n```\nfunc fullNameField() -> FXFormFieldDictionary {\n    return [\n        FXFormFieldHeader: \"User Profile\",\n        FXFormFieldTitle: \"Full Name\"\n    ]\n}\nfunc emailField() -> FXFormFieldDictionary {\n    return [\n        FXFormFieldTitle: \"Email\",\n        FXFormFieldType: FXFormFieldTypeEmail\n    ]\n}\n```\nAll of that is inferred by default.\nEDIT: oops, you still need this bit:\nEDIT2: no, I was right the first time! :-)\n. This is the same problem. In your Legal form, put this:\n```\nfunc termsOfServiceField() -> FXFormFieldDictionary {\n    return [\n        FXFormFieldClass: termsOfService.dynamicType\n    ]\n}\nfunc privacyPolicyField() -> FXFormFieldDictionary {\nreturn [\n    FXFormFieldClass: privacyPolicy.dynamicType\n]\n\n}\n```\n(And there's no need to implement the fields() method)\n. Hmm, I tried the same and it worked at my end. Can you send me your project?\nsupport @ charcoaldesign.co.uk\n. Hi Justin,\nThanks for sending the project through. I turns out that the issue was just that you need to embed your view controller inside a UINavigationController, otherwise there's nothing to push the sub viewcontrollers onto.\nI should probably throw an exception in this case rather than failing silently!\n. FYI thanks to your help, I've managed to find a fix for the original issue. I just pushed version 1.2.3 that no longer requires you to specify the dynamicType for your forms and controllers, so you can take all that out again if you want!\n. @kumargaurav89 Is your formViewController inside a UINavigationController? It needs to be if you want to use non-inline subforms.\n. Create a new ViewController class that conforms to the  protocol, which means that it has a \"field\" property of type FXFormField.\nWhen your controller is pushed, it's field property will be automatically set, and you can return the value by settings self.field.value before popping the controller.\nI don't think the inline array template is the one you want to base it on because your form controller won't appear inline in the form. Instead, you probably want something like this:\n@{FXFormFieldKey: @\"myCustomField\",\n  FXFormFieldViewController: [MyFormFieldViewController class]}\n. FXFormFieldTypeLabel is the type, not the key. Try this:\n@{FXFormFieldType: FXFormFieldTypeLabel,\n    FXFormFieldTitle: @\"Program Version\",\n    FXFormFieldDefaultValue: @\"1.0\"}\n. If you have property already, you can omit the FXFormFieldDefaultValue and it will get its value directly from your property.\nTo intercept changes to homeinit, you can add an action, like this:\n@{FXFormFieldKey: @\"homeinit\", FXFormFieldAction: \"methodName:\"}\nThe action is the name of a method that you want to call on your controller when the value changes. So in your controller, you'd add:\n- (void)methodName:(id<FXFormFieldCell>)cell {\n    BOOL homeinitValue = [cell.field.value boolValue];\n}\nBy the way, FXForms can automatically infer the field title from the property name, so if you give your form properties human-readable names then you don't have to specify the FXFormFieldTitle for every field (e.g. if you call your version property \"programVersion\", then the title will be \"Program Version\".\n. Probably because you've set field type to FXFormFieldTypeLabel. Labels are non-interactive. Remove the FXFormFieldType key and it will use the default.\n. :-)\n. I'll need a bit more detail. Can you paste in your form class and the json for that field?\n. FXFormFieldAction doesn't have to be a block, it can be the name of a method to call on your view controller instead. That allows you to put any model update logic in your controller, instead of having to observe the model directly.\n. You may need to set the FXFormFieldClass for your subforms - FXForms can't infer the type of dynamic properties, so it defaults to text.\n. This is working correctly for me in the latest version. Can you try again, and if it's still not working, please send a project demsonqrating the problem to support at charcoaldesign dot co dot uk.\n. This working correctly for me. Are you using a custom header view? Or maybe it's something to do with the font?\n. Add the table view manually in IB and bind into the tableView outlet of the FXFormViewController.\n. I can't see anything wrong with your code, but the dateOfBirth field is working fine in the BasicExample project, so I don't think it's an FXForms bug.\nCan you send me the project and I'll try to reproduce it? support at charcoal design dot co dot uk\n. Fair enough. I suggest putting a breakpoint in the tap handling method and stepping through to see what's going on then.\n. You weren't doing anything wrong, it's just that the class inference wasn't as smart as it should have been. Fixed in 1.2.6\n(PS, you don't need to specify FXFormFieldCell explicitly, just FXFormFieldType is enough).\n. Ah, you could be right. I'll check.\n. Hmm, it's working for me. Which OS are you testing on?\n. Also, is it the cancel button for the UIActionSheet, or the image picker controller that's not working for you?\n. Hmm, it won't be the UIAlertController NULL method then, because that's only used on iOS8+. I don't have an iOS7 device to hand - can you puta breakpoint in the action sheet callback and see if you can work out what's happening? Maybe the button index is wrong?\n. If you change the structure of the form, you need to reassign it to the formController using formController.form = formController.form, then call [tableView reloadData]\n. You can't do this with an ordinary options field. You'll have to create a dynamic form object using the technique shown in the DynamicFieldsExample, then build a tree of subforms, where each field in each form is a subform containing the fields for the next set of options.\n. This is an interesting problem, and there's a case for me to create a \"tree\" type field to make this simpler, but I can't easily estimate how long that would take.\n. Quite right. Fixed in 1.2.8\n. Is this still happening in 1.2.8?\n. The proxy form seems like the way to go in this case.\nYou can present a field in a screen on its own, but only by building a custom view controller with a bespoke UI for editing the field value. FXFormViewController is only designed to work with fields whose value is of type FXForm, it can't display a single field.\nI could modify FXFormViewController to do this proxying automatically, but it seems like a bit of an edge case, and it's unclear how field properties such as header/footer should be handled in the general case (would they be displayed in both the main form and subform?).\nI'll think about it.\n. You can already make forms within forms - just define one of your root form's fields as being another FXForm object (the example app does this). The OP had a slightly different requirement.\n. What was the logical clarification?\n. Ah, the convention in Objective-C is to write selectors (method names) without the argument names, since they're redundant. So a method like:\n- (void)didSelectWithTableView:(UITableView *)tableView controller:(UIViewController *)controller;\nJust becomes:\ndidSelectWithTableView:controller:\n. You may be thinking of Swift, which has slightly different naming conventions.\n. You can do it, but it's a little awkward. Add an FXFormFieldAction to the field and it will be called when the value is updated. You can then set the field text color to red and refresh the form if it's invalid.\n. You'll need to subclass FXFormViewControllerandset up your custom back button as a leftBarButtonItem. Then add your custom controller class to the field dictionary for the field that displays it, e.g\n- (NSDictionary *)mySubformField {\n    return @{FXFormFieldViewController: [MyFormSubclass class]};\n}\n. from within your submitRegistrationForm method, get the navigation controller using self.navigationController, then call popToRootViewController on it to dismiss all the presented forms\n. If you override the setText method of the cell with your own method, do you still get the warning?\n. Fair enough. In that case it's a spurious warning. You can suppress it like this:\n```\npragma clang diagnostic push\npragma clang diagnostic ignored  \"-Wdeprecated-declarations\"\n\n(void)setText:(NSString *)text {\n    ...\n}\n\npragma clang diagnostic pop\n```\n. There's no need to check if customLabel is nil before setting the text by the way - Objective-C is nil safe. Your setText method can just be:\n```\npragma clang diagnostic push\npragma clang diagnostic ignored  \"-Wdeprecated-declarations\"\n\n(void)setText:(NSString *)text {\n    self.customLabel.text = text\n}\n\npragma clang diagnostic pop\n```\n. Is your customLabel outlet defined as weak? It probably shouldn't be - that recommendation only applies to outlets on view controllers, and even that is unnecessary since iOS6 because views are no longer unloaded.\n. I may have got the deprecation warning string wrong. You can find out what the actual warning you need to suppress is by right-clicking warning in left sidebar and selecting \"show in log\".\n. There is a PR that implements this already. I'm not certain whether I like it or not, but if you need it then you can use this fork until I decide what to do: https://github.com/nicklockwood/FXForms/pull/111\n. How is a \"hidden\" field different from an excluded field, e.g. one not included in the fields array, or that you've put into the excludedFields array?\n. Can you provide more information? Which iOS version was this? What was the crash - what appeared in the console, etc?\n. OK, fixed in 1.2.10\n. Yes, just set FXFormFieldTitle to a blank string @\"\"\n. You can call self.navigationController.topViewController to get the frontmost form controller.\n. Why not just set imageView.image instead of textView.leftView?\n. You can set the keyboard close button by adding the following to the field dictionary:\n\"textField.returnKeyType\" : UIReturnKeySend\nThe picker view doesn't have a close button.\n. Create a new class containing zip and state string properties to use as the form field, and a new cell class containing both fields. Then you'll just be mapping one form property to one cell.\n. Your custom cell would access the composite object by calling field.value and then read the subfields from it directly.\n. That isn't necessary, just set the field on your form object to be of the correct type and FXForms will infer the valueClass.\n. Ah, yes, it would. In that case you will need to specify valueClass. What crash are you seeing?\n. The key you need to set valueClass is just \"class\", are you using \"valueClass\" instead?\n. Can you paste in your whole field dictionary?\n. \"type\" shouldn't be \"option\" as that's used for bool values, also using \"options\" may confuse FXForms since it will think this is an options field where actually it's something completely custom. Maybe call it \"states\" instead.\n. I think the field.value will initially be nil. It would be up to you to create an instance of PPStateZip, either in the cell or in the DynamicForm itself.\n. If you want to send me your project, I'll take a look if you like. I think it can be done without modifying FXForms, but it's difficult to diagnose the issue remotely.\n. Hmm. I think it used to but no longer does because that crashed for CoreData objects. It will work if the custom class conforms to the FXForm protocol, which might actually make things easier.\nI.e. you could treat the field as a subform, but still render it using a single cell.\n. You'd just need to declare PPStateZip as conforming to < FXForm > protocol, but if it's already working for you  without doing that then don't worry about it.\n. It would still be the field.value.\n. There's no easy way to do this right now, sorry. You'll have to hack the tableView:editingStyleForRowAtIndexPath: method in FXForms.h\n. This will give you a left-aligned date:\n@{FXFormFieldKey: @\"dateOfBirth\", FXFormFieldTitle: @\"\", @\"style\": @(UITableViewCellStyleSubtitle), FXFormFieldPlaceholder: @\"Date Of Birth\"},\nTweaking the color of the placeholder text to match the other fields may be more challenging.\n. Well, actually, if you don't mind the date being grey after it is selected, you can set the text color like this:\n@{FXFormFieldKey: @\"dateOfBirth\",\nFXFormFieldTitle: @\"\",\nFXFormFieldPlaceholder: @\"Date Of Birth\",\n@\"style\": @(UITableViewCellStyleSubtitle),\n@\"detailTextLabel.color\": [UIColor lightGrayColor]},\n. You can always subclass FXFormDatePickerCell if you need more sophisticated customisation.\n. There's no automatic way to format currencies in iOS. Just use an NSValueTransformer to manually build the string. Or you can use a block if that's easier.\n. Fields have an optional FXFormFieldValueTransformer property, so you can supply the value transformer along with your other field configuration.\n. Yes, sorry, I was unclear. I meant that there's no way to automatically format a number with a currency symbol. You'd have to concatenate the number and symbol manually, although it would make sense to use NSNumberFormatterCurrencyStyle for the numeric part.\n. @marcelofabri ah, interesting. I didn't realise that.\n. @dformoso this isn't really an FXForms-related problem. If you can figure out how to get the effect you want with an ordinary UITextField, you can get the same effect in FXForms by creating a custom cell.\n. In Objective-C, NSInteger can't be nil. You need to set the value to NSNotFound to clear it - the default value of zero maps to the first element.\n. You could just use an options field and supply an array of NSNumbers in the desired range as the options.\n. NSInteger cannot have a value of nil, so it defaults to zero, which is the first value in your enum.\nThere are various solutions to this. Either use an NSNumber property instead of NSInteger, or set the value of the field to NSNotFound in the init method of your form.\n. The ISO3166 transformer is just example code, not part of the FXForms library. I haven't tested it and don't advocate re-using it in your own projects.\n. If you create a UIViewController subclass that conforms to the FXFormFieldViewController protocol, you can create a completely bespoke interface for setting a field value. In your field dictionary just add FXFormFieldViewController: MyCustomForm to use your VC instead of the default picker interface.\nAlternatively, I guess you could subclass FXTextFieldCell, and implement your autocomplete field as an inline control.\n. You can use FXFormFieldValueTransformer for that.\n. The reason I don't expose the options array is that the indexes/values vary depending on whether you include a placeholder or default value. For that reason, I've hidden the underlying array to avoid confusion and crashes due to mismatched indexes.\n. The newly pushed controller should inherit the configuration from the parent controller. If you want different configuration, you can supply a custom FXFormViewController subclass to use by setting the FXFormFieldViewController property of the field that displays the subform.\n. Yes, check out the DynamicFieldsExample project in the examples folder.\n. You need the string value if you are using it in a JSON file. Fair point about example usage though.\n. Um, no. Sorry. I hard-coded the cell class. I should probably fix that!\n. I'm not sure I fully understand what you mean by \"Send the selected object\"? What kind of object is it? Is it one of the values represented by a field in your form object?\nIf so, you can access the form from within a FXFormViewController subclass like this:\nMyForm *form = (MyForm *)self.formController.form;\nform.someProperty = valueFromSegue;\nThen you can set one of its properties, and then reload the table using \n[self.formController.tableView reloadData];\nTo see the updated value appear. Or, if the object from the segue actually is an entire form in its own right, you can just assign it to self.formController.form.\nIf that's not what you mean, please explain further.\n. Try calling setValuesForKeysWithDictionary: On your form object. If the keys and types match up with the properties, it should work (otherwise it will crash)\n. Are you using Swift?\n. It's not expected. Is it for every field, or just a particular type?\n. This should now be fixed in 1.2.12\n. That isn't how you use a custom cell in FXForms - I'm not sure why you thought it was :-)\nI can't tell exactly from the code you've given me how you're trying to use your custom cell, but take a look at the CustomButtonExample example project and hopefully that will make things clearer.\n. Sounds like a bug. I'll take a look.\n. Fixed in 1.2.11\n. Yeah, subclassing the cell is your best bet here. It should be pretty trivial - just subclass the FXFormsOptionSegmentsCell and override the - (void)layoutSubviews method . You can copy the existing code, but use a hardcoded width.\nThen just specify your new cell class in the form field dictionary instead of FXFormOptionSegmentsCell.\n. The template title was supposed to be used only for the \u201cAdd Item\u201d button, but was appearing inside each field. I\u2019ve fixed that in 1.2.12.\nOnce you upgrade to 1.2.12, if you just want a blank text field, you shouldn\u2019t need to do anything further to customize your cell - you can just use a standard FXFormTextFieldCell.\nThe only thing that isn't supported is making the email fields non-editable after they've been created. You might be able to rig that up using a custom cell, but I'm not exactly sure what the best way to do that would be - maybe replace the strings in your array with some kind of object that has an editable state?.\nNote that if a user edits any existing entries, it will call the setter on your form for the whole list, so you can apply any necessary re-validation logic. It may not be necessary for you to make them non-editable, unless it's particularly desirable for UX reasons.\nIf you want to apply custom styling then subclassing FXFormTextFieldCell as you were doing is the correct approach. The cell has a \u201cfield\u201d property that contains all the available state information.\nNick\n. It's fairly easy to add this with a custom action on the field, but yeah, it's a commonly requested feature - I'll think about adding it.\n. This looks awesome! I was intending to add something similar but haven't had the time. And yes, using the inline property makes perfect sense for this. Can you file a pull request? I can't promise I'll get to it right away, but I will eventually.\n. Set the value on the form object, and then reload the tableView (or just the relevant row) in the normal way.\n. It doesn't include a minus sign, unfortunately, otherwise that would be a good option.\n. I do use the decimal pad if you set the type to Unsigned Integer (there's no such thing as an unsigned float though).\n. Yes, but mostly because that property is rather poorly defined, and has suffered some scope creep. It really needs to be broken up into separate events.\nTo detect every text change, I suggest you add a KVC observer to your form field, or override the setter and have it call an action directly.\n. I don't think the \"self\" is required.\n. The tableView itself tou can just access directly, via the view controller, e.g. self.formController.tableView. IIRC though, cells are opaque by default, so setting tableview background may not do what you want.\n. How would you do it normally if you were calling the segue yourself?\n. If it's a push segue onto a navigation controller, you're probably better off using FXFormFieldViewController instead. Then you can implement the FXFormFieldViewController protocol, which adds a \"field\" property to your controller that can be used to set the field value.\n. Yeah, I don't recycle cells, and that's problematic for performance. I want to fix that, but it's not trivial to ensure that properties are properly reset.\n. It should be:\n[self.formController registerCellClass:[MyFormTextFieldCell class] forFieldType:FXFormFieldTypeText];\nWhich tells FXForms to use your MyFormTextFieldCell for any field of type FXFormFieldTypeText. That seems to be equivalent to the third option you tried though, so if it's not working, have you verified that self.formController is not nil inside your init method?\n. If you subclass FXFormTextFieldCell then it should handle the different keyboards, etc. automatically.\nYou can't get the field type in setUp, but in update you can check self.field.type.\n. There's a +heightForField: method you can override that is called whenever the row is updated.\n. I'm not sure why that wouldn't work, but take a look at how FXFormImagePickerCell works, and see if that's doing anything differently.\nYou might also try using Xcode's view logging features to inspect your cell and see if the imageView is being wrongly positioned or sized, or if the image property has been set correctly.\n. Brilliant! Thank you Donna :-)\n. You can add an action block or selector to the last field using FXFormFieldAction\n. @aryaxt I'm not sure I understand the question. It's included in version 1.2.13, which is the latest version on CocoaPods. It's not included in 1.2.12 because that version was released before that feature was merged.\n. You can set a default value in your form configuration for that field, e.g.\n- (NSDictionary *)myPropertyField\n{\n    return @{FXFormFieldDefaultValue: @3}; // number equal to enum value you want to be default\n}\nAlternatively, in the init for your form object, you can just set the default, like this:\n- (id)init\n{\n    if ((self = [super init])) {\n        _myProperty = SOME_ENUM_VALUE;\n    }\n    return self;\n}\n. @wdcurry thanks, I've updated my original answer.\n(ps, to indent code correctly on github, just add four spaces at the start of each line.)\n. If your View controller has a property called field of type FXFormField, it will be set automatically to the field of the cell that was clicked. You can include any data you want to pass as that field's value.\n. If you set the options value of the field yo be an array of the ids, you can use a valueTransformer to display these as human-readable names.\nThe country select menu in the example app demonstrates how to do this (it maps country names to codes).\n. The slider needs to set the value of it's cell.field when it changes, so if you haven't already done so, you should add this inside your custom cell:\n```\n[self.slider addTarget:self action:@selector(didChange)];\n...\n\n(void)didChange {\n    self.field.value = @(self.slider.value);\n}\n```\n\nTo get the forms values as a dictionary, you can use KVC and say something like:\nNSDictionary *values = [myForm dictionaryWithValuesForKeys:@[@\"field1\", @\"field2\", etc...]];\nOr, if you follow the dynamic form example, you can create a form that stores all its values in a dictionary anyway, which you can access directly.\n. Yes, it's due to reuse. Just as you have to set the cell.field.value when you update the slider, you also have to set the cell.slider value when the field changes.\nOverride setField: on the cell, like this:\n- (void)setField:(FXFormField)field\n{\n    super.field = field;\n    self.slider.value = field,value.floatValue;\n}\n(You can get rid of the seperate float property)\n. You should be able to subclass FXFormBaseCell and save yourself some hassle, but if you're just using UITableViewCell as the base, change it to:\n```\n@synthesize field = _field; // field is part of FXFormFieldCell protocol. This creates ivar and accessors\n\n(void)setField:(FXFormField)field\n{\n    _field = field;\n    self.slider.value = field,value.floatValue;\n}\n```\n. Analyzer warnings generally shouldn't be ignored. I'll look into it.\n. Init a new form object and assign it to the form property, then call reloadData on the tableView.\n. No, that just reloads the same form object. To reset the form you need to also update the form object first, like this:\n\nself.form = MyForm()\nself.tableView.reloadData()\n. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd\n. That doesn't make a whole lot of sense. self.fields is functionally equivalent to [self fields]. Can you explain what effect you believe this change had on the behavior?\n. But self.fields doesn't access the instance variable. It calls the - (NSMutableArray *)fields method. To access the instance variable, you'd have to write self->_fields.\nTry putting a breakpoint inside - (NSMutableArray *)fields and you can verify that it's called when you access self.fields.\nI think perhaps the issue that you're referring to is \"Argument to 'NSMutableArray' method 'addObject;:' cannot be nil\"? In which case the issue it's complaining about is that the field value being added to the array is nil, not the array itself.\nI'll fix this in the next update.\n. Hmm, I can't actually replicate a clang warning on the line you fixed. The warning I'm seeing is on the line a few below that: [self.fields addObject:field]\n. I think maybe the change above just confused the analyzer so that it couldn't parse the logic below anymore \u00af(\u30c4)/\u00af \n. I will continue to support it, but I can't commit to any specific features or timelines.\nI've just submitted version 1.2.13 which works on Xcode 7.0 / iOS 9.\nMost issues seem minor. I'll review them as and when I can.\n. Therr are two simple options:\n1) add headers to separate the table into groups by adding FXFormFieldHeader values (see the registration form example)\n2) split the form into nested subforms, which you can do by splitting your form object up into several sub objects (again, see the registration form)\nImplementing a search filter is possible, but there's no support built in. You'd need to override the fields method of your form and return a filtered list based on a search string.\n. You could use a hex string and convert it using my ColorUtils library.\n. Yes, just use FXFormFieldTypeDateTime instead.\n. Call tableView.reloadData()\n. Make it a readwrite @property of your form object, then you can set it.\n. No, it will automatically use localised versions of your field titles if you include them in your Localizable.strings file.\n. Default values don't work that way. Default values are the value used when a field is reset to null. BOOL values can't be null, so they can't be reset.\nTo set the value to YES by default, just set self.rememberMe = YES in the init method of your form object.\n. You'd need to create a custom cell type backed by a custom class with two fields: NSString *name and BOOL selected. Then you could create a template form consisting of fields of that type.\n. I'm not sure what you were expecting @\"stepper.backgroundColor\": [UIColor grayColor] to do, but it looks to me like it's working as expected.\nIf you were trying to just change the color of the buttons and not the background, that's outside the scope of FXForms since I'm just using the standard control and not doing anything special with it, but here are some ideas:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/8762512/change-appearance-of-uistepper\n. The FieldSelectorViewController should have a field property of type FXFormField, like this:\n@property (nonatomic, strong) FXFormField *field;\nThis will be automatically populated by the parent form (your DynamicForm class) when the Reason field is selected.\nTo update the value from within the FieldSelectorViewController, just set the value of the field, like this:\nself.field.value = @\"New Value\";\nAnd that should then update the value of the Reason property in the DynamicForm. To refresh the display of the field in the FieldSelectorViewController you may also need to call\n[self.tableView reloadData];\n. I think I'm going to have to see more of the code to debug this.\n. @\"textField.textColor\"\n. This works fine in version 1.2.14, which was released on November 2nd. It may be that you need to upgrade your Xcode version.\n. @plandem, I was oversimplifying. You don't need to use the latest version of Xcode, but you do need to use the latest iOS SDK.\nThe reason that FXForms is giving you an error is because you are trying to build using the iOS8 SDK, and the cellLayoutMarginsFollowReadableWidth symbol doesn't exist in that SDK version.\nIf you build using the iOS9 SDK instead, but set the deployment target as iOS8 or earlier, FXForms will still work fine on iOS8 because it checks for the existence of that feature at runtime.\nYou don't need to use the iOS8 SDK to support iOS8, but if you choose to do so for some reason, you'll need to either use an old version of FXForms, or modify the new version to compile using the iOS8 SDK.\n. Which writeup are you referring to?\n. In your form class, add the following method:\n- (NSDictionary *)<nameOfYourProperty>Field {\n  return @{FXFormFieldType: FXFormFieldTypeTime};\n}\n. (You don't have to declare it in the @interface, only in the @implementation)\n. Try\n- (NSDictionary *)<nameOfYourProperty>Field {\n  return @{FXFormFieldType: FXFormFieldTypeTime, FXFormFieldTitle: @\"\"};\n}\n. Er\u2026 that's curious. Maybe an issue with the locale being different for the picker than the label?\n. Swift enums are very different from C enums, and I've not tested FXForms with them, so I can't be sure they can be used in the same way as in my example code.\nWith that said, did you try:\nenum Gender : Int {\n  case male\n  case female\n  case undetermined\n}\nPerhaps that will work?\n. I'm not sure I understand, but have you looked at the Dynamic Forms example? It shows how to build forms from json instead of a fixed structure.\n. Oh I see. There's no built-in control for that yet. You could do it with a template field, but you'd need to create a custom field type that includes both a text input and a tick for selection.\n. It might be easier to go the route of having an \"other, please specify\" option in your enum, and then having an optional text field that is shown only when \"other\" is selected.\nYou could also just have a separate text field for entering a new value which then modifies the source array for the selection in your data model, and reloads the form.\n. You need to nest your form view controller inside a navigation controller in order to push another controller.\n. ",

I'll close this and make a new pullrequest.\n. Sounds good, I'll try to have a go at it tomorrow :rocket: \n. I rebased this against master, can you forward-merge it now ?\n. I'd say FXFormFieldPlaceholder and FXFormFieldNilOption are complementary.\nFXFormFieldNilOption allows you to select an option that will set the underlying field to nil.\ne.g.:\nIn the BasicExample app, FXFormFieldNilOption allows you to select 'English', setting the language property to 'en', and then allows you to select the 'NilOption', setting the language property to nil again.\nTo give a more concrete example, I have an app that has Items and Categories. An Item may belong to a Category. FXFormFieldNilOption allows me to remove a Category from an Item by setting item.category to nil.\n. Sure no problem.\nAny idea what it is specifically that you dislike about it ? \nI realise every new option adds a bit of extra complexity, but being able to set something to nil is something I need in a project I'm working on.\nI must admit I'm not in love with FXFormFieldNilOption as a name though.\n. Yeah I considered adding an [NSNull null] property to the front of the FXFormFieldOptions array, but then I wound up with not having a good presentation of that value (which is why FXFormFieldNilOption takes a NSString).\nI'll mull over it some more too.\n. It's reasonable, and a valid solution for my current requirement.\nHowever, I can't shake the feeling that this is conflating two somewhat distinct concepts, namely a 'placeholder' and a 'nil option'. \nThere will be some friction when a user will try to:\n- Have an instructional placeholder, like 'pick a language' on the main form, but have 'None' as the first option in the options list.\n- Leave the detailTextLabel.text to be nil but offer 'None' or 'Empty' as the first option in the options list.\nThat being said, it's much better than not being able to set an option to nil :)\nI've been thinking about having a FXFormDataSource protocol, which may be a great way to offer more flexibility in this regard, but I haven't found the time yet to really think things true and write code for it.\n. No worries, happy to help!\n. Hm, that's odd, what version of iOS are you using where this issue happens ?\nI tried to reproduce this in the BasicExample on iOS 7.1 and 6.1, but it seemed to work ok.\nDoes this bug manifest for you in the BasicExample ?\n. @cvconover: I'm using FXForms with CoreData, and the approach I'm using so far is as follows:\n- For each NSManagedObject I create a category that implements FXForm so that I have a Customer and a Customer+Form.\n- When creating a new Customer, I create an ad-hoc FXFormViewController, in my CustomersViewController I have something like this:\n``` Objc\n- (void)add:(id)sender {\n    self.scratchContext = [[NSManagedObjectContext alloc] initWithConcurrencyType:NSMainQueueConcurrencyType];\n    self.scratchContext.parentContext = [CoreDataStack defaultStack].managedObjectContext;\nFXFormViewController *vc = [[FXFormViewController alloc] init];\nvc.formController.form = [Customer insertInManagedObjectContext:self.scratchContext];\nvc.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem = [[UIBarButtonItem alloc] initWithBarButtonSystemItem:UIBarButtonSystemItemSave target:self action:@selector(save:)];\n[self.navigationController pushViewController:vc animated:YES];\n\n}\n\n(void)save:(id)sender {\n    if (self.scratchContext && [self.scratchContext hasChanges]) {\n        NSError *error;\n        if ([self.scratchContext save:&error]) {\n            [[CoreDataStack defaultStack] saveContext];\n        } else {\n            [[UIAlertView alertViewWithError:error] show];\n        }\n    }\n    [self.navigationController popToViewController:self animated:YES];\n}\n```\nI have a readonly CustomerDetailViewController with an edit button, which looks something like this:\n\n``` Objc\n- (void)edit:(id)sender {\n    FXFormViewController *vc = [[FXFormViewController alloc] init];\n    vc.formController.form = self.customer;\n    vc.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem = [[UIBarButtonItem alloc] initWithBarButtonSystemItem:UIBarButtonSystemItemSave target:self action:@selector(save:)];\n    [self.navigationController pushViewController:vc animated:YES];\n}\n\n(void)save:(id)sender {\n    [[MyAPI sharedAPI] saveEntity:self.customer];\n}\n``\n. I haven't usedFXFormFieldActionyet, but my understanding is that the action can only be run on a subclass ofUIResponder, so ifTeam+Formis aNSManagedObject` subclass, I don't think it will work.\n\nTo figure out why your selector turns out to be null, I'd set a breakpoint on the setAction: method of FXFormField and then trace back what the value of action is up the stack. \nHopefully that will provide a clue.\n. @nicklockwood I just encountered the same issue. \nThe cause, as described in the above PR, is that NSManagedObject overrides respondsToSelector: and crashes on nil values.\n. Make sure your subclass conforms to the UITextFieldDelegate protocol, and assign the textField's text to your field's value.\n``` objc\n\n(void)setUp\n{\n    self.textField = ;\n    self.textField.delegate = self;\n}\n\n...snip...\n\n(void)textFieldDidEndEditing:(__unused UITextField *)textField\n{\n    self.field.value = self.textField.text;\n    if (self.field.action) self.field.action(self);\n}\n```\n\nBe sure to check FXFormTextFieldCell for more detail.\n. Upgrading FXFormFieldInline is a decent idea.\nMaybe having a FXFormFieldPresentationStyle bitmask would be nice. That way we would be able to do something like:\n``` objc\n// popover on iPad. New screen on navigationController stack on iPhone:\n@{FXFormFieldPresentationStyle: @(FXFormFieldPresentationStylePopover)}; \n// popover on iPad. Inline on iPhone:\n@{FXFormFieldPresentationStyle: @(FXFormFieldPresentationStylePopover|FXFormFieldPresentationStyleInline)};\n```\n. I'm working on a solution for this problem in an app I'm working on. Once I have my specific solution working, I'll try to make a pull request to solve the general problem.\nMy current idea is to have an option where you can tell a FXFormField that it is a FXFormFieldRelationshipToMany or something like that.\nThis would only work with properties of type NSArray or NSSet, and I'd like to build in support for swipe to delete, and by default show an 'Add ' button.\nIt's still a work in progress though, so I can't promise that I'll be able to come up with a satisfying general solution.\n. Awesome. I'll keep that approach in mind.\nBy the way, since FXForms tries to auto-configure a lot of stuff right now, it might be interesting to test if a FXForm is an NSManagedObject, and if so, use its NSEntityDescription for some more information.\nFor relations specifically, it should be possible to obtain a relationship's cardinality through its NSRelationshipDescription\n. @nicklockwood: do you have a rough idea of how you'd like the FXFormFieldTemplate attribute to function ?\nI've got something sort of working, but it's not flexible enough to my liking at the moment. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on the matter.\n. This is a bit cumbersome at the moment.\nYou would add an action to the productList field, e.g. @\"productListChanged:\" and implement that in a subclass of FXFormViewController to do something like:\nobjc\n- (void)productListChanged:(id)sender {\n    self.formController.form = self.productSelectionForm;\n    [self.tableView reloadData];\n}\nYou also need the list of productOptions to be dynamic in the fields method of your ProductSelectionForm. You  can do this by assigning a method to FXFormFieldOptions:\nobjc\n@{FXFormFieldKey: @\"productOptions\", FXFormFieldOptions: [self arrayOfProductOptionsBasedOnSelectedProductList]}\n. You can do this by implemenig - (NSString *)fieldDescription on your SalesAgent entity.\nIf SalesAgent is a OneToMany relation and already conforms to the FXForm protocol, you should define the field as something like this in your Client+Form:\n``` objc\n- (NSArray *)fields {\n    return @[\n             @{\n                 FXFormFieldKey: @\"salesAgent\",\n                 FXFormFieldOptions: [self salesAgents],\n                 }];\n}\n\n\n(NSArray )salesAgents {\n    NSFetchRequest request = [NSFetchRequest fetchRequestWithEntityName:@\"SalesAgent\"];\nreturn [[CoreDataStack defaultStack].managedObjectContext executeFetchRequest:request error:nil];\n}\n```\n.

Feedback is welcome, hope you find it useful.\n. Thanks for the PR.\n@nicklockwood UITableView has built-in support for an editingmode. I've been thinking about building a form similar to the one in the iOS Contacts.app, and it would be nice if FXForms could make a distinction between edit and readonly mode as well.\nWondering what your thoughts are on that.\n. Hm, haven't given that a lot of thought yet.\nI have a custom cell and a protocol that extends from the FXForm protocol to implement the key-value screenshot I posted above.\nBasically the custom protocol allows me to implement a keyField method which basically returns a NSDictionary from which I can build a form (much like the current fields method).\nI use this approach to declaratively build a list of possible choices, e.g.:\nobjc\n- (NSDictionary *)keyField {\n    return @{\n             FXFormFieldKey: @\"keyProperty\",\n             FXFormFieldHeader: NSLocalizedString(@\"Contactoption Type\", nil),\n             FXFormFieldOptions: @[@(CPContactOptionTypePhone),\n                                   @(ContactOptionTypeMobilePhone),\n                                   @(ContactOptionTypeFax),\n                                   @(ContactOptionTypeEmail),\n                                   @(ContactOptionTypeWebsite)],\n             FXFormFieldInline: @(YES),\n             FXFormFieldValueTransformer: [NSValueTransformer valueTransformerForName:ContactOptionLocalizedValueTransformer]};\n}\nThere's a bit more scaffolding around that, but that's the gist, it's basically 2 FormFields (part of a single model) in a single Cell.\nedit: as for picking a key to associate new values with, this would probably have to be a default value provided in the fields method somewhere.\nI've been holding of on trying to make this more generic, because I'm not sure about where @nicklockwood draws the line between feature and bloat :)\n. I'm gonna go ahead and try to swap out my branch with this solution.\nI'm also closing this pull request because it's a dead end now.\nDon't worry about not using my approach, I'm happy this is going to be a main line feature, and will try to help out with smaller sized pull requests.\nAs for missing features, I've only glanced over the code so far, but I think there's a bit of missing support for CoreData (where you can't just alloc init a new instance), but again, I'll make a new issue or PR for that when I hit it. :truck:\n. Having some way to assign a dedicated key (apart from the field key) to cells will also be useful in the future if we want to delete / insert / reload cells using a UITableViewAnimation.\nI have a bit of code somewhere where I:\n- iterate over the FormController fields\n- assign a new form to the FormController (the fields method is dynamic)\n- iterate over the new FormController fields\n- based on the field key, build a set of deleted and inserted fields, and use those for dynamic updates\nThis will probably fail in cases where a form has fields that don't correlate to a specific field though, e.g. login buttons (which you might want to dynamically show/hide/disable) etc.\n. Sounds fair, although some properties should probably be excluded from hashing.\ne.g. I have a FormField whose FXFormOptions change when the selected option from another FormField changes.\n. What about using something like key + title + header by default, and allowing FXFormFieldIdentifier for people that require more control ?\nSeems like a nice \"Try to be smart about it, but get out of the way when asked\" approach. It would also somewhat sidestep the cognitive load issue for the simple cases.\n. This is sort of what I did.\nI have a User class with a contactOptions property. ContactOption conforms to my KeyValueField protocol which looks as follows:\n``` objc\n@protocol KeyValueField \n@property (nonatomic, strong) id keyProperty;\n@property (nonatomic, strong) id valueProperty;\n/// returns a NSDictionary used to configure a FXFormField\n- (NSDictionary *)keyField;\n@end\n```\nI then have a KeyValueCell that's able to display and bind to these properties.\nThe actual implementation is a bit cobbled together, but in theory this should allow for a very flexible KeyValueCell.\n. Oh right, that makes sense, I must've overlooked that.\nIn that case, using the FXFormFieldClass key inside the FXFormFieldTemplate and instantiating a new instance of that class is likely the right thing to do by default.\nThe newInstanceFor would then only be necessary when initialisation is more complex, e.g. when working with CoreData, or having default values based on context.\n. Thanks! Will try to have a look later today.\nRegarding the form instantiating and cleaning up objects, what are your thoughts on having a delegate protocol next to, or instead of, some of the 'magic' methods ? \nI'm wondering if it might make the use of the library a bit easier for new users, since they'd be able to look through the protocol header and see what they could implement. Just a thought.\n. Nick expanded a bit on the reasons why the code is all in two files in #157.\nBut I agree that FXForms would be easier to work on / understand if the code could be split out in a more typical manner.\n. The ISO3166 transformer is based on the ISOCountryCodes available on NSLocale. I don't think it fully implements ISO3166 in that it only seemed to support the alpha2 part of the standard.\nAs nick says, it's just example code.\n. Sounds great.\nActually you can already use the FXFormFieldValueTransformer on other fields as well.\nYou'd just do something like:\nObjective-C\n@{\n    FXFormFieldKey: @\"name\",\n    FXFormFieldValueTransformer: [NSValueTransformer valueTransformerForName:UppercaseValueTransformerName],\n},\nBut I understand if you'd like to restructure things a bit anyway.\n. Wondering now if it would be useful to use NSValueTransformers in the opposite direction for data normalisation.\n. Ugh, changes from my previous pull request snuck in this one as well. I'll close this and make a new pullrequest.\n. Sounds good, I'll try to have a go at it tomorrow :rocket: \n. I rebased this against master, can you forward-merge it now ?\n. I'd say FXFormFieldPlaceholder and FXFormFieldNilOption are complementary.\nFXFormFieldNilOption allows you to select an option that will set the underlying field to nil.\ne.g.:\nIn the BasicExample app, FXFormFieldNilOption allows you to select 'English', setting the language property to 'en', and then allows you to select the 'NilOption', setting the language property to nil again.\nTo give a more concrete example, I have an app that has Items and Categories. An Item may belong to a Category. FXFormFieldNilOption allows me to remove a Category from an Item by setting item.category to nil.\n. Sure no problem.\nAny idea what it is specifically that you dislike about it ? \nI realise every new option adds a bit of extra complexity, but being able to set something to nil is something I need in a project I'm working on.\nI must admit I'm not in love with FXFormFieldNilOption as a name though.\n. Yeah I considered adding an [NSNull null] property to the front of the FXFormFieldOptions array, but then I wound up with not having a good presentation of that value (which is why FXFormFieldNilOption takes a NSString).\nI'll mull over it some more too.\n. It's reasonable, and a valid solution for my current requirement.\nHowever, I can't shake the feeling that this is conflating two somewhat distinct concepts, namely a 'placeholder' and a 'nil option'. \nThere will be some friction when a user will try to:\n- Have an instructional placeholder, like 'pick a language' on the main form, but have 'None' as the first option in the options list.\n- Leave the detailTextLabel.text to be nil but offer 'None' or 'Empty' as the first option in the options list.\nThat being said, it's much better than not being able to set an option to nil :)\nI've been thinking about having a FXFormDataSource protocol, which may be a great way to offer more flexibility in this regard, but I haven't found the time yet to really think things true and write code for it.\n. No worries, happy to help!\n. Hm, that's odd, what version of iOS are you using where this issue happens ?\nI tried to reproduce this in the BasicExample on iOS 7.1 and 6.1, but it seemed to work ok.\nDoes this bug manifest for you in the BasicExample ?\n. @cvconover: I'm using FXForms with CoreData, and the approach I'm using so far is as follows:\n- For each NSManagedObject I create a category that implements FXForm so that I have a Customer and a Customer+Form.\n- When creating a new Customer, I create an ad-hoc FXFormViewController, in my CustomersViewController I have something like this:\n``` Objc\n- (void)add:(id)sender {\n    self.scratchContext = [[NSManagedObjectContext alloc] initWithConcurrencyType:NSMainQueueConcurrencyType];\n    self.scratchContext.parentContext = [CoreDataStack defaultStack].managedObjectContext;\nFXFormViewController *vc = [[FXFormViewController alloc] init];\nvc.formController.form = [Customer insertInManagedObjectContext:self.scratchContext];\nvc.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem = [[UIBarButtonItem alloc] initWithBarButtonSystemItem:UIBarButtonSystemItemSave target:self action:@selector(save:)];\n[self.navigationController pushViewController:vc animated:YES];\n\n}\n\n(void)save:(id)sender {\n    if (self.scratchContext && [self.scratchContext hasChanges]) {\n        NSError *error;\n        if ([self.scratchContext save:&error]) {\n            [[CoreDataStack defaultStack] saveContext];\n        } else {\n            [[UIAlertView alertViewWithError:error] show];\n        }\n    }\n    [self.navigationController popToViewController:self animated:YES];\n}\n```\nI have a readonly CustomerDetailViewController with an edit button, which looks something like this:\n\n``` Objc\n- (void)edit:(id)sender {\n    FXFormViewController *vc = [[FXFormViewController alloc] init];\n    vc.formController.form = self.customer;\n    vc.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem = [[UIBarButtonItem alloc] initWithBarButtonSystemItem:UIBarButtonSystemItemSave target:self action:@selector(save:)];\n    [self.navigationController pushViewController:vc animated:YES];\n}\n\n(void)save:(id)sender {\n    [[MyAPI sharedAPI] saveEntity:self.customer];\n}\n``\n. I haven't usedFXFormFieldActionyet, but my understanding is that the action can only be run on a subclass ofUIResponder, so ifTeam+Formis aNSManagedObject` subclass, I don't think it will work.\n\nTo figure out why your selector turns out to be null, I'd set a breakpoint on the setAction: method of FXFormField and then trace back what the value of action is up the stack. \nHopefully that will provide a clue.\n. @nicklockwood I just encountered the same issue. \nThe cause, as described in the above PR, is that NSManagedObject overrides respondsToSelector: and crashes on nil values.\n. Make sure your subclass conforms to the UITextFieldDelegate protocol, and assign the textField's text to your field's value.\n``` objc\n\n(void)setUp\n{\n    self.textField = ;\n    self.textField.delegate = self;\n}\n\n...snip...\n\n(void)textFieldDidEndEditing:(__unused UITextField *)textField\n{\n    self.field.value = self.textField.text;\n    if (self.field.action) self.field.action(self);\n}\n```\n\nBe sure to check FXFormTextFieldCell for more detail.\n. Upgrading FXFormFieldInline is a decent idea.\nMaybe having a FXFormFieldPresentationStyle bitmask would be nice. That way we would be able to do something like:\n``` objc\n// popover on iPad. New screen on navigationController stack on iPhone:\n@{FXFormFieldPresentationStyle: @(FXFormFieldPresentationStylePopover)}; \n// popover on iPad. Inline on iPhone:\n@{FXFormFieldPresentationStyle: @(FXFormFieldPresentationStylePopover|FXFormFieldPresentationStyleInline)};\n```\n. I'm working on a solution for this problem in an app I'm working on. Once I have my specific solution working, I'll try to make a pull request to solve the general problem.\nMy current idea is to have an option where you can tell a FXFormField that it is a FXFormFieldRelationshipToMany or something like that.\nThis would only work with properties of type NSArray or NSSet, and I'd like to build in support for swipe to delete, and by default show an 'Add ' button.\nIt's still a work in progress though, so I can't promise that I'll be able to come up with a satisfying general solution.\n. Awesome. I'll keep that approach in mind.\nBy the way, since FXForms tries to auto-configure a lot of stuff right now, it might be interesting to test if a FXForm is an NSManagedObject, and if so, use its NSEntityDescription for some more information.\nFor relations specifically, it should be possible to obtain a relationship's cardinality through its NSRelationshipDescription\n. @nicklockwood: do you have a rough idea of how you'd like the FXFormFieldTemplate attribute to function ?\nI've got something sort of working, but it's not flexible enough to my liking at the moment. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on the matter.\n. This is a bit cumbersome at the moment.\nYou would add an action to the productList field, e.g. @\"productListChanged:\" and implement that in a subclass of FXFormViewController to do something like:\nobjc\n- (void)productListChanged:(id)sender {\n    self.formController.form = self.productSelectionForm;\n    [self.tableView reloadData];\n}\nYou also need the list of productOptions to be dynamic in the fields method of your ProductSelectionForm.

    "timgcarlson": "@nicklockwood Is localization supported for \"options\"? I'm not seeing it done in my forms for non-inline options, though it is being handled elsewhere.\nFor instance, I have a key that has an options type... \"options\": [\"option1\", \"option2\"]. I want to have option1 and option2 localize from my Localizable.strings file.\n. Thanks for the tip! I thought about doing this (localizing each of the options), however then the selection is going to be the localized string, instead of whatever string I pass in (the key). So I'll do it this way for now, but then I'll have to convert the localized selection back to the key for saving purposes.\nPerhaps I'll attempt to fork FXForms to allow passing more than just strings as options. ie. \n\"options\": [{\"key\": \"option1\", \"title\": \"The First Option\"}, {\"key\": \"option2\", \"title\": \"The Second Option\"}]\nAnd then localizing the title strings. Perhaps I'm over thinking it though :)\n. :thumbsup: to both @xergic and @jakelisby for this. This worked for me. You can also get the FXFormBaseCell sent back with the selector method. I'm using this to determine if my options were inline or not.\n```\nFXFormFieldAction: @\"itemSelected:\"\n\n(void)itemSelected:(id)sender {\n    // Option selected, navigate back automatically for user\n    FXFormBaseCell baseCell = (FXFormBaseCell )sender;\n    if (!baseCell.field.isInline) {\n        [self.navigationController popViewControllerAnimated:YES];\n    }\n}\n``\n. Excellent, that works brilliantly! I didn't think it would be that trivial, thanks for the help.\n. It's been a few months since I've worked with FXForms, so forgive me if I'm missing some details in my answer. I was able to validate input by adding anFXFormFieldActionto the field. You do this by assigning a selector string to the keyFXFormFieldAction` (\"action\"). I believe the action will be performed whenever the field is selected and when the first responder is resigned (user navigates out of the field)\n\nHere is an example on validating a date code in the format MMYY.\nWhen building your field...\n// Don't forget the colon after the selector string so you can get the field in your method!\n[fieldDict setValue:@\"checkDateCodeRegEx:\" forKey: FXFormFieldAction];\nNow create the selector method. I put the method in the view controller that presented the form. From the FXForm README, \"...the target is determined by cascading up the responder chain from the cell until an object is encountered that responds to it. That means that you could choose to implement this action method on the tableview, its superview, the view controller, the app delegate, or even the window.\"\n```\n- (void)checkDateCodeRegEx:(id)sender {\n    FXFormTextFieldCell fieldCell = (FXFormTextFieldCell )sender;\n    NSString *inputString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"%@\", fieldCell.field.value];\nNSString *regex = @\"^(0[1-9]|1[0-2])[0-9][0-9]$\";  // MMYY\nNSPredicate *regexTest = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@\"SELF MATCHES %@\", regex];\n\nif ([regexTest evaluateWithObject:inputString] || !inputString || [inputString isEqualToString:@\"\"]) {\n    fieldCell.textField.textColor = [UIColor blackColor];\n} else {\n    fieldCell.textField.textColor = [UIColor redColor];\n}\n\n}\n```\nThis will simply evaluate what was inputed into that field, and then change the font color depending on if the input was determined to be invalid or valid.\n. @confile You can do this by setting the textAlignment property of UITextView, which is a property of FXFormTextViewCell.\nWhen setting the dictionary for the field that you want right aligned, set this key-value combination:\n@\"textView.textAlignment\": @2\n2 is the enumerated value for NSTextAlignmentRight.\n\n. As far as the compiler is concerned, valideFirst and valideFirst: are two different methods. So you need to include a colon (:) at the end of your selector so that the correct method is invoked.\n* Change the action selector to the following when you create the field...*\nFXFormFieldAction:@\"valideFirst:\"\nThen change the valideFirst method to the following...\n- (void)valideFirst:(id)sender {\n    FXFormDefaultCell *yourFieldCell = (FXFormDefaultCell *)sender;\n    NSLog(@\"Cell title = %@\", yourFieldCell.field.title);\n}\n. Change the submitLoginForm selector to submitLoginForm: (add the colon). Then, in the view controller that presents your form implement the following method.\n```\n- (void)submitLoginForm:(id)sender {\n    CustomButtonCell fieldCell = (CustomButtonCell )sender;\n// Now you can access any of the CustomButtonCell properties\nfieldCell.textField.textColor = [UIColor redColor];  // Assuming textfield is a property of CustomButtonCell\n\n}\n``\n. You can set the field's property 'userInteractionEnabled' to NO/false. Assuming you're using the-fields` method to set up your form, it'd look something like this...\nreturn @[ @{FXFormFieldKey: @\"yourProperty\",\n          @\"userInteractionEnabled\": (/*Some check on if the field should be readonly*/) ? @NO : @YES,\n           }];\n. @nicklockwood Is localization supported for \"options\"? I'm not seeing it done in my forms for non-inline options, though it is being handled elsewhere.\nFor instance, I have a key that has an options type... \"options\": [\"option1\", \"option2\"]. I want to have option1 and option2 localize from my Localizable.strings file.\n. Thanks for the tip! I thought about doing this (localizing each of the options), however then the selection is going to be the localized string, instead of whatever string I pass in (the key). So I'll do it this way for now, but then I'll have to convert the localized selection back to the key for saving purposes.\nPerhaps I'll attempt to fork FXForms to allow passing more than just strings as options. ie. \n\"options\": [{\"key\": \"option1\", \"title\": \"The First Option\"}, {\"key\": \"option2\", \"title\": \"The Second Option\"}]\nAnd then localizing the title strings. Perhaps I'm over thinking it though :)\n. :thumbsup: to both @xergic and @jakelisby for this. This worked for me. You can also get the FXFormBaseCell sent back with the selector method. I'm using this to determine if my options were inline or not.\n```\nFXFormFieldAction: @\"itemSelected:\"\n\n(void)itemSelected:(id)sender {\n    // Option selected, navigate back automatically for user\n    FXFormBaseCell baseCell = (FXFormBaseCell )sender;\n    if (!baseCell.field.isInline) {\n        [self.navigationController popViewControllerAnimated:YES];\n    }\n}\n``\n. Excellent, that works brilliantly! I didn't think it would be that trivial, thanks for the help.\n. It's been a few months since I've worked with FXForms, so forgive me if I'm missing some details in my answer. I was able to validate input by adding anFXFormFieldActionto the field. You do this by assigning a selector string to the keyFXFormFieldAction` (\"action\"). I believe the action will be performed whenever the field is selected and when the first responder is resigned (user navigates out of the field)\n\nHere is an example on validating a date code in the format MMYY.\nWhen building your field...\n// Don't forget the colon after the selector string so you can get the field in your method!\n[fieldDict setValue:@\"checkDateCodeRegEx:\" forKey: FXFormFieldAction];\nNow create the selector method. I put the method in the view controller that presented the form. From the FXForm README, \"...the target is determined by cascading up the responder chain from the cell until an object is encountered that responds to it. That means that you could choose to implement this action method on the tableview, its superview, the view controller, the app delegate, or even the window.\"\n```\n- (void)checkDateCodeRegEx:(id)sender {\n    FXFormTextFieldCell fieldCell = (FXFormTextFieldCell )sender;\n    NSString *inputString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"%@\", fieldCell.field.value];\nNSString *regex = @\"^(0[1-9]|1[0-2])[0-9][0-9]$\";  // MMYY\nNSPredicate *regexTest = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@\"SELF MATCHES %@\", regex];\n\nif ([regexTest evaluateWithObject:inputString] || !inputString || [inputString isEqualToString:@\"\"]) {\n    fieldCell.textField.textColor = [UIColor blackColor];\n} else {\n    fieldCell.textField.textColor = [UIColor redColor];\n}\n\n}\n```\nThis will simply evaluate what was inputed into that field, and then change the font color depending on if the input was determined to be invalid or valid.\n. @confile You can do this by setting the textAlignment property of UITextView, which is a property of FXFormTextViewCell.\nWhen setting the dictionary for the field that you want right aligned, set this key-value combination:\n@\"textView.textAlignment\": @2\n2 is the enumerated value for NSTextAlignmentRight.\n\n. As far as the compiler is concerned, valideFirst and valideFirst: are two different methods. So you need to include a colon (:) at the end of your selector so that the correct method is invoked.\n* Change the action selector to the following when you create the field...*\nFXFormFieldAction:@\"valideFirst:\"\nThen change the valideFirst method to the following...\n- (void)valideFirst:(id)sender {\n    FXFormDefaultCell *yourFieldCell = (FXFormDefaultCell *)sender;\n    NSLog(@\"Cell title = %@\", yourFieldCell.field.title);\n}\n. Change the submitLoginForm selector to submitLoginForm: (add the colon). Then, in the view controller that presents your form implement the following method.\n```\n- (void)submitLoginForm:(id)sender {\n    CustomButtonCell fieldCell = (CustomButtonCell )sender;\n// Now you can access any of the CustomButtonCell properties\nfieldCell.textField.textColor = [UIColor redColor];  // Assuming textfield is a property of CustomButtonCell\n\n}\n``\n. You can set the field's property 'userInteractionEnabled' to NO/false. Assuming you're using the-fields` method to set up your form, it'd look something like this...\nreturn @[ @{FXFormFieldKey: @\"yourProperty\",\n          @\"userInteractionEnabled\": (/*Some check on if the field should be readonly*/) ? @NO : @YES,\n           }];\n.

It's a false alarm.\nThe problem was I was calling the following code in my custom cell update method:\n// resize the tableview if required\n    id responder = [self nextResponder];\n    while (responder)\n    {\n        if ([responder respondsToSelector:@selector(beginUpdates)] &&\n            [responder respondsToSelector:@selector(endUpdates)])\n        {\n            [responder beginUpdates];\n            [responder endUpdates];\n            break;\n        }\n        responder = [responder nextResponder];\n    }\n. Duplicate issue. See https://github.com/nicklockwood/FXForms/issues/93\n. Right now, it seems the only thing I can obtain from the option's field is field.title.\n. I guess I'm just looking to customize the look/UI of option cell. What would be the best way to obtain the necessary data to do this?\n. I tried adding  {FXFormFieldViewController: field.viewController} in FXOptionsForm's  implementation, inside - (instancetype)initWithField:(FXFormField *)field\nThen in the cell prototype, \nFXFormViewController *fvc = self.field.viewController;\n    if ([fvc respondsToSelector:@selector(field)]) {\n        id optionObj = [fvc.field optionAtIndex:[self.field.key integerValue]];\n    }\nHowever, with little success...\n. The Field configuration was:\n@{FXFormFieldHeader: NSLocalizedString(@\"Insert Images HERE\", nil),\n                 FXFormFieldInline: @YES,\n                 FXFormFieldSortable:@YES,\n                 FXFormFieldTemplate: @{FXFormFieldType: FXFormFieldTypeImage,\n                                        FXFormFieldCell: [FXFormImagePickerCell class]},\n                 FXFormFieldTitle: NSLocalizedString(@\"Add Image\", nil)};\n. Using version 1.2.5, I was able to reproduce the crash on TemplateFieldsExample Xcode project using following form configurations:\n- (NSDictionary )arrayWithTemplateField\n  {\n  return @{FXFormFieldTemplate: @{FXFormFieldType: FXFormFieldTypeImage,\n                                  FXFormFieldCell: [FXFormImagePickerCell class]}};\n  }\n- (NSDictionary )sortableArrayWithTemplateField\n  {\n  return @{FXFormFieldSortable: @YES,\n           FXFormFieldTemplate: @{FXFormFieldType: FXFormFieldTypeImage,\n                                  FXFormFieldCell: [FXFormImagePickerCell class]}\n           };\n  }\n. Awesome! Thanks you!!!\n. Hey Nick,\nI noticed that the FXFormImagePickerCell's Cancel button is not working.\nMaybe the problem is not setting the handler in [alert addAction:[UIAlertAction actionWithTitle:NSLocalizedString(@\"Cancel\", nil) style:UIAlertActionStyleCancel handler:NULL]];\nDavid\n.

I would send my project to you but it is quite large and it's a mess. It's been in the app store for 3 years and has been abused by unskilled developers and I am just starting to get a handle on cleaning it up myself. If you were really that motivated to help (I don't expect you to do so, since this is all open source) I have the code parked in a private github repo. But onto my progress from today...\nI have been digging into this quite a bit trying different ways to just get the simplest example of this working within my current app. I was finally able to do so using Storyboard, UIViewController and simple FXForm borrowed from one of the examples. So progress has been made - I see the form and it works, (although I will have some questions about dismissing the date picker and other non-keyboard editors).\nThen I took the simple FXForm example class (a subset of RegistrationForm fields) and replaced with my CoreData model class 'team' and the error message is the same but I think I was too sleep deprived yesterday to notice the log message above the exception: \nCoreData: error: Failed to call designated initializer on NSManagedObject class 'team' \n(the full error is listed at the end of this comment). \nAgain this is the same team object I tried before, but this error message indicates that the model object has not be instantiated and populated with data, yet. The reason the field name is different (state vs formal_name) is that I changed the order of the fields in the team class file on this test run.\nThis error makes sense on this latest test because I am not doing anything to select an instance of team from my SQLite db (via CoreData) because I was just testing the simplest of simple examples and just replace one FXForm with another, so there would not be any team record, just the model class as an FXForm.\nThe problem I have is that I am not sure how to use my model class as an FXForm properly. In the original test run from yesterday, I know that I have a team instance based on the fact that I am selecting one from a TableView and passing that object to the details view of the master/detail splitview. But either way, I need to show the form either with a current record populated in the form or a black form for insert mode. So what I don't get, just yet, is how FXForms knows where this data is (or what to do when it doesn't exist).\nDo you have any recommendations on how to proceed? Or possibly advice to stop trying because it won't work (at least not without a lot of effort). I really need a form framework and yours is the simplest yet most powerful I've seen of the few that I have found and played with. QuickDialog was a consideration but I couldn't get that to work at all. Much more complicated to integrate and looks to be a lot of boilerplate code to mess with.\n+++++++++++++++++\nFull error messages;\n2014-04-06 16:47:56.760 Lacrosse-Stats[984:60b] CoreData: error: Failed to call designated initializer on NSManagedObject class 'team' \n2014-04-06 16:47:56.795 Lacrosse-Stats[984:60b] *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSUnknownKeyException', reason: '[ valueForUndefinedKey:]: the entity (null) is not key value coding-compliant for the key \"formal_name\".'\n. If I were to be so bold to ask, I guess if I were to sum it all up, I'd really like to see an example using CoreData and SplitViewController for master/detail form use case, or just some steps. Probably trivial for most but I am still at the copy/paste/modify of developing iOS constructs.\n. Would it be proper to just create a separate FXForm class, get the CoreModel object and pass it to the FXForm? \nI think I am just not sure how data binding happens with respect to FXForms. I don't see any mention of operations or form mode (view, new, edit). I think if I understood that, I'd be good to go.\n. I'm not exactly sure how to describe the form interface but I'll do my best.\n- I should be able to display a list of records from a CoreData fetch.\n- Clicking on one of the records in the list (TableView) would display a ViewController that instantiates the FXForm with the currently selected record and the form would be in \"Edit\" mode. a) Perhaps it could be displayed in \"View\" mode first with option to go into \"Edit\" mode. b) Would be great if the model could just use  as I was attempting.\n- If the ViewController that is loading the FXForm doesn't have any data for the CoreData record (nil model, I guess), then the form displays in \"New\" mode.\n- Ability to show default operation/action buttons for the form based on the mode: New (Cancel Save/Done), View (Edit), Edit (Cancel, Save/Done).\nAs an alternative to all that above, just an example of how to pass an CoreData object (populated or nil) to an FXForm and do the right thing: either show the data in the form for editing or show an empty form for inserting. \nI imagine that the FXForm would just be a copy of the CoreData model class but it wouldn't extend NSManagedObject. However, it would seem that this wouldn't be necessary. I would imagine there is some way to shoehorn the NSManagedObject into the current design so that it can be an  and work properly. It's very possible that it does work but that I am just failing to do it the right way but I can't figure out what I am doing wrong.\nAgain, if you want to venture into my project, I can point you to the right branch and set of classes where I prototyped it and provide \"test run steps\".

I have very little understanding of UIResponder at this point and the responder chain but I thought I had everything setup for it to work.

Assuming the code sample is the proper way since it is in real code but thought I'd point that out in case this distinction is important (assuming it is) and doesn't cause confusion for others. For me, with or without the colon is failing.\nI will try the block route and see if I have success with that. I haven't had the opportunity to work with blocks yet (not the Objective-C flavor, plenty of other language experience, so assume it will be similar) so this is a good opportunity to learn.\nGood stuff though. I have functioning forms now and just need to keep layering in additional features and functionality available in FXForms.\n. Well that didn't take long. I understand the structure of the block, but not the implementation in this context. If what I want to do is load a new ViewController or save my form when my button is clicked. I am having trouble with the scope of objects. Sorry to lean on you guys so much but could I trouble you for a block field action example?\n. Hmm. That could get messy. I'm likely going to have a lot of these.\nStill not understanding why the selector route is failing. I'm sure I'm doing something subtle causing this to fail. I'll keep investigating in that area.\n. So I just thought to myself that maybe I am not creating the virtual form field properly. So I commented it out and placed the field action on a formal form field.\nSo I had this:\n@{FXFormFieldTitle: @\"Submit\", FXFormFieldHeader: @\"\", FXFormFieldAction: @\"showPlayers\"},\nThen I commented that out and moved the action to my head coach form field:\n@{FXFormFieldKey: @\"head_coach\", FXFormFieldTitle: @\"Head Coach\", FXFormFieldAction: @\"showPlayers\"},\nAnd this worked perfectly. So what am I doing wrong with the virtual field field (meant to be a button)? Including my full tea+Form.h/.m files (inlined since attachments have to be pic files).  The code in question is the commented code for the \"Players\" field. What's interesting is that I removed the FXFormFieldAction from the virtual field and it gave the same exception so the selector is not the issue. So is it possible that the virtual field in a category is an issue? Let me know your thoughts on that.\nThanks for both of you for the prompt feedback. Much appreciated.\n```\nimport \"team.h\"\n@interface team (Form) \n@end \n```\n```\nimport \"team+Form.h\"\n@implementation team (Form)\n\n(NSArray *)fields\n{\n    return @[\n             @{FXFormFieldKey: @\"formal_name\", FXFormFieldTitle: @\"Long Formal Name\", FXFormFieldPlaceholder: @\"The long, formal name of the team\"},\n             @{FXFormFieldKey: @\"display_name\", FXFormFieldTitle: @\"Short Display Name\", FXFormFieldPlaceholder: @\"A short name used for display in small places\"},\n             @{FXFormFieldKey: @\"mascot_name\", FXFormFieldTitle: @\"Mascot\"},\n             @{FXFormFieldKey: @\"city\", FXFormFieldTitle: @\"City\"},\n             @{FXFormFieldKey: @\"state\", FXFormFieldTitle: @\"State\", FXFormFieldOptions: @[@\"CA\",@\"MD\",@\"NY\"], FXFormFieldInline:@YES},\n             @{FXFormFieldKey: @\"color1\", FXFormFieldTitle: @\"Primary Color\"},\n             @{FXFormFieldKey: @\"color2\", FXFormFieldTitle: @\"Secondary Color\"},\n             @{FXFormFieldKey: @\"head_coach\", FXFormFieldTitle: @\"Head Coach\", FXFormFieldAction: @\"showPlayers\"},\n\n// This is the \"fields\" version (below is the \"extraFields\" version - don't enable both)\n//             @{FXFormFieldTitle: @\"Submit\", FXFormFieldHeader: @\"\", FXFormFieldAction: @\"showPlayers\"},             \n// if I remove the FXFormFieldAction, as I do here, this still throws the same exception when \n// attempting to create/display the form (crashes when I select an item in the master form).\n//             @{FXFormFieldTitle: @\"Submit\", FXFormFieldHeader: @\"\"},           \n             ];\n}\n//- (NSArray *)extraFields\n//{\n//    return @[@{FXFormFieldTitle: @\"Players\", FXFormFieldHeader: @\"\", FXFormFieldAction: @selector(showPlayers:)}];\n//}\n@end\n```\n. I just decided to put some breakpoints in the FXForms class in a few strategic spots and I figured out where it was crashing and at least why in my case, although the sample app doesn't suffer the same fate, so it must not be the real root cause.\nCrashes at this line:\nhttps://github.com/nicklockwood/FXForms/blob/master/FXForms/FXForms.m#L414\nIf I give my virtual field a FXFormFieldKey like this FXFormFieldKey: @\"players\", or in full form:\n@[@{FXFormFieldKey: @\"players\", FXFormFieldTitle: @\"Players\", FXFormFieldHeader: @\"\", FXFormFieldAction: @\"showPlayers\"}];\nThen it doesn't crash and it works. But your sample app doesn't have a FXFormFieldKey and it works fine. So I'm not sure what else is at play here but might be worth putting in some sore to defensive coding here. I'm sure I must have something else misconfigured, but not sure what. But since it is working, I'll keep moving forward.\n. I want to close this thread off, but just want to understand one thing.\nDo I need to declare a FXFormFieldKey for a virtual field or am I doing something else wrong?\nMade lots of progress with using a list of values from a lookup table (a many to one relationship from team to gender). I have an NSValueTransformer working, which is pretty cool. And I have a better understanding of overriding setValue:forKey/forUndefinedKey.\n@{FXFormFieldKey: @\"gender\", FXFormFieldTitle: @\"Gender\", \n            FXFormFieldOptions: genderObjects, FXFormFieldValueTransformer: \n            [[GenderValueTransformer alloc] init], FXFormFieldInline:@NO},\nI am starting to understand the real power and flexibility, unfortunately, for you guys I guess, I have more questions more around the lines of best practices. I'll try to keep them as atomic and concise as possible. \nI hope I can contribute some sample apps back to this repo about working with NSManagedObject and some other features that are not as obvious or not shown in the current samples.\nGetting the hand of things thanks to the great responses from you two.\nCheers,\nCraig\n. I have a high level understanding that it is possible, just no actual insight on the implementation. I'm pretty good at figuring most things out but still pretty inexperienced with Objective-C and all its MVC goodness. \nI guess I just code up the popover UI details in the FXForm and use a custom action to call it up? But not sure if there is more to hooking it all up to the FXForm properly. Can't see the forest for the trees as they say.\nA workaround is all I need and I'll work on making that happen (not as much of a priority as getting everything coded up first), but just throwing out a request for enhancement to deprecate the FXFormFieldInline and create something like FXFormFieldEditorMode with options like Inline, NewScreen and Popover. \nOr instead of deprecating FXFormFieldInline, have a new property called FXFormFieldPopover. When this property is enabled (@YES) and is an iPad form factor, then it overrides the FXFormFieldInline setting (no matter if it is YES or NO) and uses a popover, instead.\nIf I do end up figuring out a workaround I might continue to refactor it to do the above and submit a pull request, but that might be a bit of a stretch for me at this stage, but sometimes I surprise myself.\n. I have had quite a bit of success modifying FXForms to display in popover with relatively few lines of code added/modified. Speaks well of your framework architect skills, for sure. I'll test and polish a little more then submit pull request. Could be tonight, could be next week depending on the final bits of polishing left to be done but it is displaying a popover with the options. Very cool.\n. Success with first round of popover option. I will do a pull request and let you guys decide to use, enhance or toss. Needs a little more polish on the popover display but did best I could. Definitely room for more configuration options. Only tested on iPad with SplitViewController.\n. I am not sure, but assuming it does, where do I put that code? Do I override setValue:forKey?\n. Just my overall thoughts would be formalized events where values or actions could be altered. \nongotfocus/onlostfocus\nonsetvalue\netc\nSent from my iPhone\nOn Apr 14, 2014, at 2:31 PM, Nick Lockwood notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nYeah, I think you'd have to do it like that, which I guess is a little awkward.

I would send my project to you but it is quite large and it's a mess. It's been in the app store for 3 years and has been abused by unskilled developers and I am just starting to get a handle on cleaning it up myself. If you were really that motivated to help (I don't expect you to do so, since this is all open source) I have the code parked in a private github repo. But onto my progress from today...\nI have been digging into this quite a bit trying different ways to just get the simplest example of this working within my current app. I was finally able to do so using Storyboard, UIViewController and simple FXForm borrowed from one of the examples. So progress has been made - I see the form and it works, (although I will have some questions about dismissing the date picker and other non-keyboard editors).\nThen I took the simple FXForm example class (a subset of RegistrationForm fields) and replaced with my CoreData model class 'team' and the error message is the same but I think I was too sleep deprived yesterday to notice the log message above the exception: \nCoreData: error: Failed to call designated initializer on NSManagedObject class 'team' \n(the full error is listed at the end of this comment). \nAgain this is the same team object I tried before, but this error message indicates that the model object has not be instantiated and populated with data, yet. The reason the field name is different (state vs formal_name) is that I changed the order of the fields in the team class file on this test run.\nThis error makes sense on this latest test because I am not doing anything to select an instance of team from my SQLite db (via CoreData) because I was just testing the simplest of simple examples and just replace one FXForm with another, so there would not be any team record, just the model class as an FXForm.\nThe problem I have is that I am not sure how to use my model class as an FXForm properly. In the original test run from yesterday, I know that I have a team instance based on the fact that I am selecting one from a TableView and passing that object to the details view of the master/detail splitview. But either way, I need to show the form either with a current record populated in the form or a black form for insert mode. So what I don't get, just yet, is how FXForms knows where this data is (or what to do when it doesn't exist).\nDo you have any recommendations on how to proceed? Or possibly advice to stop trying because it won't work (at least not without a lot of effort). I really need a form framework and yours is the simplest yet most powerful I've seen of the few that I have found and played with. QuickDialog was a consideration but I couldn't get that to work at all. Much more complicated to integrate and looks to be a lot of boilerplate code to mess with.\n+++++++++++++++++\nFull error messages;\n2014-04-06 16:47:56.760 Lacrosse-Stats[984:60b] CoreData: error: Failed to call designated initializer on NSManagedObject class 'team' \n2014-04-06 16:47:56.795 Lacrosse-Stats[984:60b] *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSUnknownKeyException', reason: '[ valueForUndefinedKey:]: the entity (null) is not key value coding-compliant for the key \"formal_name\".'\n. If I were to be so bold to ask, I guess if I were to sum it all up, I'd really like to see an example using CoreData and SplitViewController for master/detail form use case, or just some steps. Probably trivial for most but I am still at the copy/paste/modify of developing iOS constructs.\n. Would it be proper to just create a separate FXForm class, get the CoreModel object and pass it to the FXForm? \nI think I am just not sure how data binding happens with respect to FXForms. I don't see any mention of operations or form mode (view, new, edit). I think if I understood that, I'd be good to go.\n. I'm not exactly sure how to describe the form interface but I'll do my best.\n- I should be able to display a list of records from a CoreData fetch.\n- Clicking on one of the records in the list (TableView) would display a ViewController that instantiates the FXForm with the currently selected record and the form would be in \"Edit\" mode. a) Perhaps it could be displayed in \"View\" mode first with option to go into \"Edit\" mode. b) Would be great if the model could just use  as I was attempting.\n- If the ViewController that is loading the FXForm doesn't have any data for the CoreData record (nil model, I guess), then the form displays in \"New\" mode.\n- Ability to show default operation/action buttons for the form based on the mode: New (Cancel Save/Done), View (Edit), Edit (Cancel, Save/Done).\nAs an alternative to all that above, just an example of how to pass an CoreData object (populated or nil) to an FXForm and do the right thing: either show the data in the form for editing or show an empty form for inserting. \nI imagine that the FXForm would just be a copy of the CoreData model class but it wouldn't extend NSManagedObject. However, it would seem that this wouldn't be necessary. I would imagine there is some way to shoehorn the NSManagedObject into the current design so that it can be an  and work properly. It's very possible that it does work but that I am just failing to do it the right way but I can't figure out what I am doing wrong.\nAgain, if you want to venture into my project, I can point you to the right branch and set of classes where I prototyped it and provide \"test run steps\".

I have functioning forms now and just need to keep layering in additional features and functionality available in FXForms.\n. Well that didn't take long. I understand the structure of the block, but not the implementation in this context. If what I want to do is load a new ViewController or save my form when my button is clicked. I am having trouble with the scope of objects. Sorry to lean on you guys so much but could I trouble you for a block field action example?\n. Hmm. That could get messy. I'm likely going to have a lot of these.\nStill not understanding why the selector route is failing. I'm sure I'm doing something subtle causing this to fail. I'll keep investigating in that area.\n. So I just thought to myself that maybe I am not creating the virtual form field properly. So I commented it out and placed the field action on a formal form field.\nSo I had this:\n@{FXFormFieldTitle: @\"Submit\", FXFormFieldHeader: @\"\", FXFormFieldAction: @\"showPlayers\"},\nThen I commented that out and moved the action to my head coach form field:\n@{FXFormFieldKey: @\"head_coach\", FXFormFieldTitle: @\"Head Coach\", FXFormFieldAction: @\"showPlayers\"},\nAnd this worked perfectly. So what am I doing wrong with the virtual field field (meant to be a button)? Including my full tea+Form.h/.m files (inlined since attachments have to be pic files).  The code in question is the commented code for the \"Players\" field. What's interesting is that I removed the FXFormFieldAction from the virtual field and it gave the same exception so the selector is not the issue. So is it possible that the virtual field in a category is an issue? Let me know your thoughts on that.\nThanks for both of you for the prompt feedback. Much appreciated.\n```\nimport \"team.h\"\n@interface team (Form) \n@end \n```\n```\nimport \"team+Form.h\"\n@implementation team (Form)\n\n(NSArray *)fields\n{\n    return @[\n             @{FXFormFieldKey: @\"formal_name\", FXFormFieldTitle: @\"Long Formal Name\", FXFormFieldPlaceholder: @\"The long, formal name of the team\"},\n             @{FXFormFieldKey: @\"display_name\", FXFormFieldTitle: @\"Short Display Name\", FXFormFieldPlaceholder: @\"A short name used for display in small places\"},\n             @{FXFormFieldKey: @\"mascot_name\", FXFormFieldTitle: @\"Mascot\"},\n             @{FXFormFieldKey: @\"city\", FXFormFieldTitle: @\"City\"},\n             @{FXFormFieldKey: @\"state\", FXFormFieldTitle: @\"State\", FXFormFieldOptions: @[@\"CA\",@\"MD\",@\"NY\"], FXFormFieldInline:@YES},\n             @{FXFormFieldKey: @\"color1\", FXFormFieldTitle: @\"Primary Color\"},\n             @{FXFormFieldKey: @\"color2\", FXFormFieldTitle: @\"Secondary Color\"},\n             @{FXFormFieldKey: @\"head_coach\", FXFormFieldTitle: @\"Head Coach\", FXFormFieldAction: @\"showPlayers\"},\n\n// This is the \"fields\" version (below is the \"extraFields\" version - don't enable both)\n//             @{FXFormFieldTitle: @\"Submit\", FXFormFieldHeader: @\"\", FXFormFieldAction: @\"showPlayers\"},             \n// if I remove the FXFormFieldAction, as I do here, this still throws the same exception when \n// attempting to create/display the form (crashes when I select an item in the master form).\n//             @{FXFormFieldTitle: @\"Submit\", FXFormFieldHeader: @\"\"},           \n             ];\n}\n//- (NSArray *)extraFields\n//{\n//    return @[@{FXFormFieldTitle: @\"Players\", FXFormFieldHeader: @\"\", FXFormFieldAction: @selector(showPlayers:)}];\n//}\n@end\n```\n. I just decided to put some breakpoints in the FXForms class in a few strategic spots and I figured out where it was crashing and at least why in my case, although the sample app doesn't suffer the same fate, so it must not be the real root cause.\nCrashes at this line:\nhttps://github.com/nicklockwood/FXForms/blob/master/FXForms/FXForms.m#L414\nIf I give my virtual field a FXFormFieldKey like this FXFormFieldKey: @\"players\", or in full form:\n@[@{FXFormFieldKey: @\"players\", FXFormFieldTitle: @\"Players\", FXFormFieldHeader: @\"\", FXFormFieldAction: @\"showPlayers\"}];\nThen it doesn't crash and it works. But your sample app doesn't have a FXFormFieldKey and it works fine. So I'm not sure what else is at play here but might be worth putting in some sore to defensive coding here. I'm sure I must have something else misconfigured, but not sure what. But since it is working, I'll keep moving forward.\n. I want to close this thread off, but just want to understand one thing.\nDo I need to declare a FXFormFieldKey for a virtual field or am I doing something else wrong?\nMade lots of progress with using a list of values from a lookup table (a many to one relationship from team to gender). I have an NSValueTransformer working, which is pretty cool. And I have a better understanding of overriding setValue:forKey/forUndefinedKey.\n@{FXFormFieldKey: @\"gender\", FXFormFieldTitle: @\"Gender\", \n            FXFormFieldOptions: genderObjects, FXFormFieldValueTransformer: \n            [[GenderValueTransformer alloc] init], FXFormFieldInline:@NO},\nI am starting to understand the real power and flexibility, unfortunately, for you guys I guess, I have more questions more around the lines of best practices. I'll try to keep them as atomic and concise as possible. \nI hope I can contribute some sample apps back to this repo about working with NSManagedObject and some other features that are not as obvious or not shown in the current samples.\nGetting the hand of things thanks to the great responses from you two.\nCheers,\nCraig\n. I have a high level understanding that it is possible, just no actual insight on the implementation. I'm pretty good at figuring most things out but still pretty inexperienced with Objective-C and all its MVC goodness. \nI guess I just code up the popover UI details in the FXForm and use a custom action to call it up? But not sure if there is more to hooking it all up to the FXForm properly. Can't see the forest for the trees as they say.\nA workaround is all I need and I'll work on making that happen (not as much of a priority as getting everything coded up first), but just throwing out a request for enhancement to deprecate the FXFormFieldInline and create something like FXFormFieldEditorMode with options like Inline, NewScreen and Popover. \nOr instead of deprecating FXFormFieldInline, have a new property called FXFormFieldPopover. When this property is enabled (@YES) and is an iPad form factor, then it overrides the FXFormFieldInline setting (no matter if it is YES or NO) and uses a popover, instead.\nIf I do end up figuring out a workaround I might continue to refactor it to do the above and submit a pull request, but that might be a bit of a stretch for me at this stage, but sometimes I surprise myself.\n. I have had quite a bit of success modifying FXForms to display in popover with relatively few lines of code added/modified. Speaks well of your framework architect skills, for sure. I'll test and polish a little more then submit pull request. Could be tonight, could be next week depending on the final bits of polishing left to be done but it is displaying a popover with the options. Very cool.\n. Success with first round of popover option. I will do a pull request and let you guys decide to use, enhance or toss. Needs a little more polish on the popover display but did best I could. Definitely room for more configuration options. Only tested on iPad with SplitViewController.\n. I am not sure, but assuming it does, where do I put that code? Do I override setValue:forKey?\n. Just my overall thoughts would be formalized events where values or actions could be altered. \nongotfocus/onlostfocus\nonsetvalue\netc\nSent from my iPhone\nOn Apr 14, 2014, at 2:31 PM, Nick Lockwood notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nYeah, I think you'd have to do it like that, which I guess is a little awkward.

At other screen i need border for textfield, differ font, colors and padding.\nSent from iPhone\n\n16 \u00e0\u00e2\u00e3. 2014 \u00e3., \u00e2 1:17, Nick Lockwood notifications@github.com \u00ed\u00e0\u00ef\u00e8\u00f1\u00e0\u00eb(\u00e0):\nIt's possible to do all of your cell styling in IB, although currently it's necessary to create a custom cell class for each distinct cell.xib (although the class need not do anything except extend FXFormBaseCell).\nCan you paste in some examples of the classes you've had to write? It may be that in some cases there was a better way, but in the cases where there wasn't, I'll see if I can improve the API.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. another reason - in some cases i would like to use extended subclassing of existing UI controls, E.g. - advanced UITextEdit, but without subclassing(actually rewrite from scratch to repeat same functionalities from FXForm side, but to substitute only one line of code: self.textField= [UITextField alloc] init]) FXFormBaseCell that's not possible. I'm sure that's not very flexible pattern - rewrite FXForm to get same results, but with advanced UIControls.\n. i was sure author will close it :)\n. well...right now i dropped to use it, because it was just testing for me - so i can't remember case for sure. But anyway, there is no any example  how to use.\n\nP.S.: and yes, form was dynamic.\n. ok, i added support for FXForms (auto \"implement\" excludedFields to exclude new properties). There is an example with FXForms now.\nLooks, like the only feature that i'm missing right now - hide fields at runtime.\n. of course i can manually set for each options, but i want to use default controller for this case.\n. i see, it's different type of controllers, but i still want use same class as i used as root without overriding it. now i have to replace:\n- (FXFormController *)formController\n. #426\n. I'm not using Xcode, and how is it connected with method that can't be find? I'm not using iOS9 SDK, so right now i have to roll back to 1.2.13 to use it.\n. i see. thanks.\n. ",

If you were going to set a custom value object in a cell, where would be the best place to do so? setUp?\n. ok, parsing more code. please correct me if I'm wrong, but shouldn't [FXFormField setValue] be alloc-ing custom classes if there is a custom class specified?\n. Is there anything special I need to do in my JSON to let FXForms know that state field will be a subform?\nI got it, now I just need it to render in a single cell\n(by the way, I will probably make an example app for this when I am done if you want to add it to the repo.)\n. one more question methinks. how would I access the subform from the cell.field object?\n. I got it working! thanks for the help.\n. ",

I created a property for an array of dynamicallyExcludedFields and I'd use methods to adjust the contents of this array. \nThen I used these lists and some helper methods to adjust what gets returned by [excludedFields), like so:\n```\n - (NSArray *)excludedFields\n {\n NSMutableArray *excluded = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];\n\n [excluded addObjectsFromArray:[self alwaysExcludedFields]];\n if ([_dynamicallyExcludedFields count]) {\n     for (id excludeMeToo in _dynamicallyExcludedFields) {\n         [excluded addObject:excludeMeToo];\n     }\n }\n return excluded;\n\n}\n```\nSo the above method just adjusts what is returned.
