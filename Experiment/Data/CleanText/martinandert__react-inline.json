    "martinandert": "Just merged this, thank you!\nI wonder what the benefit of generating source maps is here. Do you have a use case?\n. Thank you for your explanation. That made things clear. \nMaybe I should switch from recast to babel for the extraction of stylesheets.\n. > A babel plugin would be great!\nYeah, I already thought about creating a babel plugin. But currently babel doesn't support passing custom options (e.g. to enable/disable CSS vendor-prefixing) into such a plugin.\n. Merged. Thanks!\n. Hi, thanks for your PR. I just merged it and released a new patch version. Enjoy!\n. ",
    "mjohnston": "First of all, thanks for this project!\nMy use case is I have the code run through babel first before transforming styles. I know there is the babel option but since the style transform happens before the babel transform, it prohibits you from using stage 0-1 features such as property initializers (recast chokes on them). So I compose the babel source map with the react-inline source map to keep a sane debugging experience.\nSupporting source maps could also be useful for those authoring in compile-to-js languages.\n. A babel plugin would be great! I had actually started down that path before stumbling upon this project.\n. ",
