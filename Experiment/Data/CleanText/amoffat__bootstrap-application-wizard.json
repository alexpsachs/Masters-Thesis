    "amoffat": "It's by design.  The idea is that progress represents how many of the steps have been finished.  The best indicator of this is the furthest step that has been reached.  Just because you jump back to the first step to verify some info, shouldn't indicate that your progress has been reset, if that makes sense.\n. Submit a pull request for the option and I'll merge it\n. Good work Zach.  I'll update the docs on Monday to reflect the new option\n. Thanks Jeff, there's an MIT license in the main source file https://github.com/amoffat/bootstrap-application-wizard/blob/master/src/bootstrap-wizard.js.  I'll add a note to the readme\n. The mobile version hasn't been tested at all, so I can't guarantee any support for that currently.  I'll leave this issue open if people want to start submitting bugfixes for mobile browsers.\n. It looks like I had trailing whitespace in the original demo file, and maybe your editor trimmed it off.\n. docs updated\n. Good work, I didn't merge because I was able to shave off 3 more kilobytes using YUI minifier\n. Just a hunch, it might be because you have data-cardname=\"\" in both cards.  The syntax of it is weird...data-cardname shouldn't be in quotes...it's an html attribute, like class is.  Assume that's a typo in this though, and you have it correct in the html, setting data-cardname=\"\" would mean that both cards have a \"card key\" of \"\", so one is overwriting the other.\nThe wizard object keeps an attribute, wizard.cards, which is an object/hashmap of your cards, keyed by either the data-cardname attribute, or by whatever is in the <h3> tag.  When it comes time to submit your cards, the wizard iterates over .cards to aggregate the form inputs.  But because you have 2 cards each with the same key, only one ends up existing in .cards.\nTry making all the data-cardname attributes unique and let me know if that fixes it.\n. Any luck @mntdamania ?\n. Hmm..could you just save the html of the rendered page and upload that somewhere for me to look at?  I could probably debug it from that\n. Good catch, thanks Christopher\n. Apologies for not replying sooner.  I think what you're suggesting makes sense and is a good idea.  I say go for it...here are some thoughts on how you might implement it:\nAdd a \"default_buttons\" attribute to the Wizard class.  This will store information on what the buttons will look like by default... things like color, text/html, etc.\nAdd a \"custom_buttons\" attribute to the WizardCard class.  Find where cards are changed from one to the next and test for that \"custom_buttons\" attribute.  If it exists, have the wizard use those button attributes, if not, use the \"default_buttons\" attribute.\n. Sounds great Bagga, thanks!\n. Yep, you got it.  .wizard() should only be called once per wizard on the page.  show() and hide() can be called multiple times.\n. There is no way to add a new button currently.  What kind of button did you want to add?\n. Take a look at issue #9.  Yedi might be interested in working with someone to design a button API for the wizard.  He's trying to make the buttons more customizable, but I can see adding/removing buttons being in this same category.\n. That will work for you, but not anyone else.  If you want to make them more generic, it will need to use some kind of button api.\n. Thanks Ludo!\n. Hi David,\nThis might be fixed by issue #8.  Go ahead and re-pull the sources down and see if it works for you\n. Hey Matt, I won't be able to merge this as-is, because it's allowing the modal to be created, then pulling away its styling and properties after the fact to make it look like its not a modal.  If you wanted to do it as the wizard is created, submit a pull request with the new code.  Thanks!\n. No worries, thanks Matt\n. @Alex-Sokolov sorry for such a long delay in responding.  There is currently some stub code for scrollbar support that looks nice.  Take a look at this line:\njavascript\n        /*\n         * set up slimScroll for our nav, if slimScroll is installed\n         */\n        if ($.fn.slimScroll && false) {\n            var slimScrollArgs = {\n                position: \"left\",\n                height: \"360px\",\n                size: \"8px\",\n                distance: \"5px\",\n                railVisible: true,\n                disableFadeOut: true,\n            };\n            $.extend(slimScrollArgs, this.args.slimScroll || {});\n            this.el.find(\".wizard-nav-container\").slimScroll(slimScrollArgs);\n        }\nYou would need slimscroll installed, and obviously false removed.  But that should work for you.\n. Hi @Ryuja, I will not be porting the wizard to bootstrap 3.  Are you interested in adding this functionality?\n. @Untit1ed I will merge PRs adding this support.\n. @DBSalvia Reading source code is the only way it will happen.  I have not tried the wizard with bootstrap 3, and from what I understand bootstrap 3 was completely re-architected.\n. There exists now a bootstrap-3 branch for development of bootstrap 3.  Thanks to @GJRTimmer for this.  Those of you interested in seeing this happen on bootstrap 3 could take some time to test out the demo.html of that branch and create issues for any problems you see, or features that are missing.  Tag these issues with b3 tag.\nThe current plan is when bootstrap-3 branch is done, it will be come the new master, and what's on master now will live as a bootstrap-2 branch.\n. This is done and on master now.  The old master lives on bootstrap-2 branch.  The current master has Bootstrap 3 support.  Open new issues for an problems discovered.\n@GJRTimmer deserves a huge thanks from all of us, as he took on the entire Bootstrap 3 migration himself and did an excellent job.  His contributions to this project have been huge :clap: :clap: :clap:\n. Hey @bryancallahan, sorry to leave you hanging on this.  I personally don't have much time these days to review/maintain projects I am not actively using, but I looked over your code and it's solid.  How would you feel if I added you as a collaborator with write perms on this project?\n. Done, feel free to merge :)\n. Bootstrap 3 is currently unsupported, with no current plans for support.  However, I am welcoming contributors for bootstrap 3 porting.\n. @che-burashco I took a look at your code...how would you feel about being added as a collaborator on this project?  This would give you the freedom to merge this commit and any other changes you would like to see made.\n. @che-burashco cool, you've been added.  You and @bryancallahan are both collaborators\n. @binarygeek This is good work.  Could you check with the README.md in the bootstrap-3 branch and see if there's anything missing in there that could be supplemented with your changes?  If there is, let's pull those into that readme and close this issue.\n. Hi @GJRTimmer, do you plan to continue to add commits to this pull request?\n. Feel free to leave it up.  This way people can track the progress being\nmade more easily.

Duplicate of #10 \n. @mgufrone Is this request still active ? If so and you are unsatified with the following answer, please re-open.\n@mgufrone can you provide more specifics about what you mean, because you can use Ajax in you validation function. I'm actually using one in combination with a domain lookup, where the server is preforming the lookup. And I call the remote lookup from Ajax.\nWhat I understand from you question is that you simple have to set the async: false on your Ajax call so that your validation function does not return before the Ajax call has been completed.\nHope this helps.\n. We will have a Bootstrap-v3 version ready soon.\n. What would be the reason to have 1 wizard with 3, and only use 1 specific card at the time, why not simply using 3 smaller wizards. That way you also have a separation of concern within you modal view ?\nMarked as won't fix.\nIssue will be reopened based upon the reason why it would be important / handy to have 1 wizard with 3 cards each one acting separate like an independent wizard.\n. wizard.trigger is used to fire an registerd event.\nFor you to reset the wizard, you have to register a reset event, like:\njavascript\nwizard.on(\"reset\", function() {\n    // Functions / commands which reset you controls, like clearing inputs.\n});\nAfter a successful submission the wizard resets and triggers the reset method you registerd. And you are all set.\nLook at the code of the demo in demo.html for an example.\nHope this helps.\n. @shravan116 \nYou could try the following.\nFirst you add the wizard object to the Ajax Object.\njavascript\n$.ajax({\n    url: '/submiturl',\n    type: \"POST\",\n    data: wizard.serialize(),\n    wiz: wizard,\n    success: function(response) {\n        // Use you wizard with this.wiz // wiz.\n        // This way your Ajax call has a correct reference and \n        // you should be able to reset the wizard correctly.\n    }\n});\nHope this helps, If not re-open.\n. Comment placed on stackoverflow, @randytan did not place any reaction to the placed solution of the stackoverflow reaction. \nDemo code is similar to what @randytan is trying to achive. Demo is working.\nIssue Closed.\n. Refactoring of @RWOverdijk is too old, personal Fork of @RWOverdijk is not compliant with current application wizard (bootstrap v2.x)\nno-modal template is completely missing.\nPull Request Not Accepted.\n. bootstrap-3 branch is ready for the switch.\n. The links are build based upon the cards, and the navigation is linked to the cards.\nThe only way currently to achive what you want is to either build your own custom version of the wizard or by injecting your custom link with jQuery.\nI do not know at the moment how the event listeners will react to custom injection when you click a link.\nHope this helps a little.\n. @amoffat Is this something we have to incorporate ?\nDo we want to incorporate this. I have added a comment section of this code to the B3 branch for the disable() function and the enable() to show it.\nWhat do you think ? Hide the navigation by default or do we have let it up to a parameter ?\n. @rajprince \nTo resolve this, first initialize all wizards, and save them in variable.\njavascript\nvar wizard_32 = $(\"#wizard_32\").wizard({\n    show: false\n});\nOn your click event you them only have to do refer to the variable.\njavascript\n$(\".button\").on(\"click\", function() {\n    var id = $(this).data(\"btnid\");\n    switch (id) {\n        case 32:\n            wizard_32.show();\n            break;\n    }\n});\nI hope you understand what I'm trying to show here.\nHope this helps you in the right direction.\n. Tested; this behavior is not present, and unable to be reproduced in the bootstrap-3 branch.\nFixed in B3 Branch, If this still occurs in current b2 (master) branch, please resubmit. \n.

Yes, certainly, I'm acutely planning on withdrawing this pull request because I found out that there is still a lot to be done.\n. Oke, sounds good, just finished updating the demo v3. Check it out, it will be basic. Also don't know if i;m going to keep the bootstrap v2.x.\nCan you tell me if the wizard-no-modal is a required piece, because currently i've dropped that functionality because I don't need it in my project i'm working on. Maybe it's an idea to re-add it later on ?\n. Rewrote the README.md.\nHope everyone likes my proposal for the new readme for the bootstrap v3 setup.\n. Bases upon the comments of the blog of panopta, I've included the default bootstrap modal option 'backdrop' this allows the wizard not to close when clicking on the backdrop of the modal when the option is set to static\n. Closed due to the creation of a bootstrap v3 branch by @amoffat \nAll changes are directly be made into this branch. Personal Fork Removed.\n. Update the CSS with cross-browser vertical alignment of the modal.\nIssue Closed\n. Just found out that when using with a multiple monitor setup in chrome it's not aligned correctly on all monitors.\n. Issue fixed with javascript\nCompleted\n. I'm Working on it.\n. Functionality Copy Done & Tested.\nClosed.\n. I agree with @amoffat this will be a possible enhancement for the future. Right now we first want to upgrade to bootstrap v3.\n. Closed while awaiting test results.\n. I think you could do the following:\n- implement the jquery file upload plugin\n- implement a seperate step where you transmit the file using ajax to the server.\nIn both cases it's maybe an idea to transfer the file to the server with ajax  have it stored on the server  while transferrring you cannot complete the wizard step  and on submit of the wizard you can processes the file further on which is already on the server.\nThis would be one of the solutions I would personally look into when dealing with files in combination eith the wizard.\nI dont want my wizard to upload a file  only a filename so I have control over the transmit.\nHope this helps you a bit.\nGert\n. Closed\n. Interesting, could you please post which browser you are using. With the latest Chrome, I'm using locally, I don't have this issue. Maybe there is a CSS conflict between Chosen and B3.\n. Within the demo page, the data-onload attribute of the 'Monitoring Location' is indeed empty. The cities are hardcoded into the example for demo purposes. You are correct, this a a possible typo error in the demo html.\nThe attribute 'data-loaded' can be used to fire an event for lazy loading data objects into your card. For example by using a basic jQuery Ajax call.\n. ",

    "MaarekElets": "This may actually belong as a separate issue, but it presented itself while I was enabling the code from this issue and is related. Part of the enable code is to add .active to the tab. Depending on where you are toggling the enable, you might not want this behavior (it also causes an issue with items in the card if it is the immediately next card as they will be hidden if you click next). To address this, I added this code to my local version which operates on the same idea of GJRTimmer's change to .disable()....\nenable: function(noactivate) {\n            this.log(\"enabling\");\n```\n        // Issue #38 Hiding navigation link when hide card\n        // Awaiting approval\n        //\n        this.nav.removeClass('hide');\n    //Added activate option to allow for optional immediate activation of the tab\n    if (!noactivate) {\n        this.nav.addClass(\"active\");\n    }\n    this._disabled = false;\n    this.trigger(\"enabled\");\n    return this;\n}\n\n```\n\nI'm new to github, so I'll leave it to others to decide if this needs to be considered for the main code. \n.

Upon testing and further review of the code, I don't believe it operates correctly or at least it doesn't for what I am doing. Using the existing code, when I click next and a disabled tab is the next tab then it appears that the ending index is increased by 1 as well as the current index, which means that the landing tab is run through the validation (and fails obviously if it has any validation on it). Also it appears that the initial card is not hidden as both the card I left and the target card displayed. I'm putting in a pull request from a fork I made of this repo that does a disabled check on just the point where validation is run (and returns ok if it is disabled) which when I test functions as desired.\n.

You need to enclose your wizard within form tags with the corresponding url. It should work.\nFor instance, bearing in mind you want to upload files:\n<form method=\"post\" id=\"myform\" enctype=\"multipart/form-data\" action=\"/myaction\">\n   your wizard markup here\n</form>\nLet me know.\n. I did comment out the \n<form>\ntags in the bootstrap-wizard.js template code. Try it. As you need to do file upload your form must include the multipart encoding. As for ajax file upload, that's a different beast. I didn't need it so I opted for a simpler solution.\n. I'd recommend you too to use bootstrap-fileupload.js from https://github.com/jasny/bootstrap/releases/tag/v2.3.0-p4 as it replaces the ugly file upload button with a nice bootstrap styled button, and offer the possibility of image preview in some browsers as well.\n.

I just return the following code:\n\n<?php\nheader('Content-type: application/json');\necho('{}');\n?>\n\nThis fires the success function correctly.  I can access the posted variables in PHP using \n\n$_POST['variable_name'];\n\nAn alternative would be to modify the js to remove the data-type specification.  It would be worth highlighting that the server response needs to be valid JSON for the default submit method in the documentation.\n. ",
    "bucktower": "EDIT: You can simply use wizard._onNextClick.call(wizard); instead!\n\nI don't think there's a simple command for that. In case you are wanting to do this in order to force the user to do something before they can advance to the next card, an easy work around is to hideButtons() upon load:\n```\n$(function() {\n    var options = {contentHeight: 500,\n                    contentWidth: 750,};\n    wizard = $(\"#apply-wizard\").wizard(options);\n    $.fn.wizard.logging = true;\n// @ first, hide the next button so that user must log in before proceeding past 1st step\nwizard.hideButtons();\n\n$('#open-wizard').click(function(e) {\n                e.preventDefault();\n                wizard.show();\n            });\n\nwizard.on(\"submit\", function() {\n  console.log(wizard.serialize());\n});\n\n});\n```\nOr, if it isn't on the first card, you could use something like this:\n// whenever a user goes to the next card\nwizard.on(\"incrementCard\", function() {\n    // Check and see if it's the card that you want\n   if(wizard.getActiveCard() == YOUR_CARD) {\n      wizard.hideButtons();\n   }\n});\nThen showButtons() at the end of whatever function that will be activated when they complete the action.\n.
