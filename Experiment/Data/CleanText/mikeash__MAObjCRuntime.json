Works fine for me. Can you show your code?\n. I'm not really sure I follow what you're trying to do. Can you post some more complete code that illustrates the problem?\n. Yes, I think I see. Seems to me like this could be done more cleanly by using KVC. Use valueForKey: to get the value, then setValue:forKey: to set it. All problems of argument size, primitives, etc. are handled for you by the KVC internals.\n. I should mention for completeness that there's no good way to do this with MAObjCRuntime directly. The method invocation stuff there is only intended for cases where you know the types in advance. You could do it directly with NSInvocation, but that would be harder than just using KVC.\n. Right. Primitives get wrapped in NSValue objects, and automatically unwrapped on the other side.\n. Glad I could help!\n. Fine by me! Attribution in the readme would be great, if the amount of code you've used warrants it, but anything which fulfills the terms of the license is ultimately fine by me (or else I wouldn't use that license!). No other comments, except that it's great to see someone building something based on the stuff I've made.\n. Neat idea. Reminds me a little of Google Protobuf, but operating at a somewhat higher level.\nThis statement in the readme confuses me a bit: \"Since JAGPropertyConverter uses Key-Value coding to get/set values, it doesn't respect custom getters and setters\" I thought KVC dealt fine with those. Have I misunderstood?\nAnyway, cool stuff, and just the sort of thing I hoped to enable with my code.\n. Yep, that was my point of confusion. I don't know whether KVC can handle custom accessor names, wouldn't surprise me if it couldn't. That could lead to some \"interesting\" behavior if your backing ivar does match the pattern that KVC looks for.\n. Can you explain what it's supposed to do? In particular, I don't understand the point of using dispatch_once to set an associated object like that.\n. I'm familiar with the pattern, but this isn't a singleton. You're using a global dispatch_once to control the adding of an associated object to a single arbitrary instance in your -[UIView sublayer]. This doesn't make any sense to me, and providing an API that takes a dispatch_once_t * in general does not seem like the right approach.\n. That doesn't really address the overall concern, though. What is the point of using dispatch_once to gate access to an associated object like this? dispatch_once is generally used for globals, but associated objects are inherently per-instance, so it seems like a complete mismatch.\n. The thing is that I don't see how the GCD solution works. There appear to only be two cases:\n1. There's a single object, ever.\n2. There are multiple objects.\nCase 1 is basically the standard singleton pattern and can be solved without associated objects, by just using a global variable. In case 2, dispatch_once doesn't work, because you need to run the code more than once (i.e. once for each object). Case 1 can use dispatch_once but doesn't need associated objects. Case 2 needs associated objects but can't use dispatch_once. So I don't see where it's ever useful to have an API that combines them like this. Can you give an example of where it would be useful?\n. OK, cool, glad we figured out what the disconnect was. I think you'd want to use associated objects still, but I'm not sure if there's a good way to lazily initialize them. You can do a check-and-set, but it's not thread safe without external synchronization....\n. Sorry, I didn't see this for a while.\nFinding performance problems with a snapshot like this is going to be tricky, since you only capture a single moment in time. It should be possible to get some useful information, though, assuming that it's likely to be in the middle of whatever is taking a lot of time when you trigger the stack trace. You'd have to look at every thread and see if any of them is doing something costly. In your first image, for example, the fact that thread 0 is in cellForRowAtIndexPath indicates that might be a hot function. (I assume you inserted a sleep just to make it look slow.)\nAny symbolication solution that works on crash reports should also work on these not-quite-crash reports. They still look just like crash reports.\nFeel free to e-mail me directly rather than continuing here, mike@mikeash.com. This is great! Thanks a bunch.
