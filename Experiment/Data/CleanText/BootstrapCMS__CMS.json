    "GrahamCampbell": "Could you make this pull against the develop branch please.\n. Thanks. I'll probs not register the registration routes either like I do when I disable blogging for example.\n. See 04e8a03956e06840b9b66d59a86afa5bf8964da7 and 4e360e3a5267e12d6f4ba9a075249e8afacd4daf.\n. I'm so pleased I could be of help! Thank you for making me aware of that issue. It's made me think of a few other places that issue occurs in too.\nIf you know anyone else that might benefit from this CMS, for production use, or for a learning resource, please let them know. Thanks so much for taking an interest. Feel free to contact me if you have any other issues or questions, whether they are related to my software, or if you need any help with Laravel.\nFinally, the Laravel forums post for my CMS is here if you need it: http://forums.laravel.io/viewtopic.php?id=11910.\n. I'll need to change one or two other things, but otherwise, thanks for this. :+1:\n. I've tagged https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Bootstrap-CMS/releases/tag/v0.7.2-alpha.\n. @apps4u, Hi there Jason. I'd be really cool if you knew anyone, or you yourself, could help out with #78.\n. What I need is the entire CMS to be translated. So all the button/menu text, and every error/success message, and all the emails. Do you speak any other languages well? Unfortunately, I am only fluent in English, which is why I haven't attempted to implement localisation before. Can I get back to you in July once I've refactored the project with the English language files. Note that Bootstrap CMS strongly depends on https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Credentials and it will need translating too.\n. That's not a solution. The id column is auto-incrementing.\n. Thanks.\n. Looks pretty good. Please make that change that I've commented in-line, then I'll merge this. Thanks. :)\n. Squashed an merged. Thanks. :)\n. Thanks.\n. I didn't realise this was not a free and open source tool. Sorry, I cannot allow it into Bootstrap CMS.\n. Thanks.\n. What's the advantage here?\n. Looks like you haven't setup git correctly.\n. The copyright year shouldn't be dynamic. The year should reflect the age of the software running on the box.\n. Thanks. :)\n. Not a typo. \"enabled\" is correct.\n. Can you standardise it all to UK format please?\n. Thank you. :)\n. Sorry this took me so long to get to. Thank you very much for the contribution.\n. https://github.com/BootstrapCMS/Credentials needs updating too.\n. > CI fails due to outdated composer.lock. Not sure it's worth commiting my dev server's composer.lock as it includes reference to jwilson8767/logviewer#Elixir-Support repo and will therefore need to be replaced before accepting pr anyway.\nPlease revert that change to the composer.json and don't depend on your fork.\n. Thank you. I've reverted some of the changes, and manually merged. I'll now fix the other issues.\n. Why have method and _method?\n. You don;t have to. Just send an ACTUAL patch request instead of a post request with the _method set surely?\n. Instead of spoofing it as the link shows.\n. Meh, well if this works, I might as well merge it. Thanks. :)\n. :heart:\n. Thanks.\n. Can you revert all changes to the file permissions please?\n. All the file permissions are still wrong.\n. Also, I can't merge this without translations on the Credentials component too.\n. You've changed all the file permissions to 755. You must not change them please.\n. Example app/Http/Controllers/CommentController.php 100644 \u2192 100755. That can't happen.\n. Probably because you chmoded everything to get it to work on our websever? Instead, just chown it to the correct user.\n. Could you please send all non-language related changes in a separate PR?\n. Thank you, but I don't have the time or energy to support this and keep it up to date.\n. Thanks. :)\n. It is intentional that emails cannot be reused.\n. You should not run these commands as root. Infact, composer will tell you off for that.\n. Same goes for npm.\n. I'm fine with changing anything that's not inside an exception.\n. Thanks. :)\n. Please use php 5.3 style arrays. Yes, I know we're not supporting php 5.3, but I'm still using that style of array for now, for consistency.\n. Can we keep the defaults the same as they currently are please.\n. I disagree. I like UK readable dates by default.\n. cs\n. i'd rather have stricter dependencies than that since bootstrap doesn't follow semver\n. this change is definetely wrong\n. Actually, why did you even pull this in? I'm confused. It's not even used anywhere?\n. Exceptions must always be in english.\n. Exception messages must not be localized.\n. ?\n. ",

I made all the translations, but he wanted the Exceptions in english, can you check the Exceptions, and change those to english or revert my changes on it? \n. He(@GrahamCampbell) have right on this point, no matter what, english is the default language, it is a try of Multiple Languages, the idea is use more than one language in the frontend, ok, but by default all the Exceptions have to be in english. It was my fail, I hope to have time in the next week for work on it, but if you can solve that, it will be great!\n.
