Not sure what you mean.\n. Yeah - it's tough. I need some kind of split point for the regular expression. I've spent a lot of time trying to find a way to make this optional, but no dice.\nThe primary issue is that you can do:\n--schema=\"username:string, age:integer\"\nIf it were just this, then we could make the ,[space] optional. But the user can also pass arguments:\n--schema=\"username:string, amount:decimal(1,2)\nSo, if somebody knows how to split that up into chunks, while allowing no spaces between each field:column,  please do let me know. I haven't been able to figure out how. \nThe regex would need to give me, using the example above, an array with two items:\n- username:string\n- amount:decimal(1,2)\n.
