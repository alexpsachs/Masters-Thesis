This has been added into the card-style branch, and while it is working, it only pulls in data for one page of activity so there's isn't much being shown. We need a efficient way to grab all activity for the past 30 days\n. Now merged into development. We just need that component to retrieve 30 days of data, not the default page amount.\n. This currently exists on the development environment \u2013 but is rather useless since it only pulls in a set number (standard page limit) of records. It should pull in 30 days worth.\n. fixed with 7812b2c500341a38b8781ccb5bdea0bc46b3681a\n. Perfect \u2013 much better! Also, we should focus on making the existing UIs better.

Also, it shouldn't be too difficult.\n. @WellingGuzman Excellent \u2013 is there a branch where I can test this?\n. Closing as a duplicate of: https://github.com/RNGR/directus6/issues/474\n. Awesome, this would be a great small enhancement to have. Priority-wise this isn't critical, so let's work through other first.\n. I'd say this one is done! What we have works well... if there are issues we can open a new ticket.\n. For a callback after items are saved/inserted/deleted in Directus? I imagine a custom callback file (not tracked) that is run after each save... within that you can check which table was saved and run proprietary scripts.  Basically, I'd like to be able to have custom code run after items are saved and I am looking at how this would be accomplished.\n. This looks like it might be (partially) implemented in /api/configuration.php \u2013 but I don't know if it's really been used yet.\n```\n'dbHooks' => array(\n    'postInsert' => function ($TableGateway, $record, $db, $acl) {\n},\n'postUpdate' => function ($TableGateway, $record, $db, $acl) {\n  $tableName = $TableGateway->getTable();\n  switch($tableName) {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\n)\n```\nPerhaps this could be extended, tested, and documented?\n. Looking at the code, this is close to what we're doing now. I think the tablename.php might be really useful too. Since this seems to be working I'll close it and open a new ticket with the tablename.php enhancement for 6.1. Thanks!\n. I can get things ready with some markup when it comes time to do this one.\n. Exactly. Now that we have column delete this should be easier, right @WellingGuzman ?\n. Migrated to FeatHub\nPlease use the Directus FeatHub to vote for features or make new request. Accepted feature requests will be added to GitHub Issues.\n. Haha, no problem! I (sometimes) get the same thing... so let's open this back up! We need to make sure that if the session/cookie is logged out then there are NO errors... it simply should redirect you to the login page.. Also, the TITLE formatting function is not run on these uploads... the title is currently saved as: \"Color-blindness-test.jpg\" but should be saved as \"Color Blindness Test\"\n. @WellingGuzman \nEssentially all this should do is:\nKeep the last_login value as up-to-date as possible so that we have an accurate sense of who is currently logged in. And whenever the user goes to a new page, it saves that as last_page so when they log in next it takes them back to that exact spot.\n. Can not reproduce.\n. Fixed with static CSS\n. @jel-massih Where did we leave things with this? Is it close to being completely removed?\n. @jel-massih Sounds good \u2013 I've assigned this one to you for when you have time.\n. Hey @WellingGuzman \u2013 @jel-massih said that this is complete, can you confirm that the old DB layer is not used anywhere, and that's it is removed from Directus?\n. @WellingGuzman Is this now complete or is there more to do? I'm sure some testing is needed...\n. Missing \"visible field\" in settings for this M2M... those settings need the required/validation to avoid this in the future.\n.

Is this still an issue?\n. @WellingGuzman I'm not even sure I know what the problem is supposed to be. @jel-massih \u2013 do you know if this is still an issue?\n. This was unclear so I reached out to Jason, he said:\n\n\"It's a minor optimization that I don't think would make much of a performance gain. It's basically just re-creating a collection, rather than just resetting the object, so I doubt it will make any differences.\"\nSo I'll close it for now, we might get into this type of work in the future when truly in optimization mode.\n.

Closing, a newer ticket will cover a broader decoupling of auth.\n. @WellingGuzman \nCurrently, this record must be present: cms_thumbnail_url (can be NULL) otherwise it throws an error:\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'get' of undefined main.js:112\nThis should not be a required record since we default to the Directus logo when empty. The framework should not choke if that record is missing. Every record within directus_settings should have a default to fall back on \u2013 so if that table were empty (no settings) everything would still work (including uploads if the directus_storage_adapter is properly set up).\nstorage_adapter and thumbnail_storage_adapter should default to FileSystemAdapter\n. Sorry @WellingGuzman \u2013 I was confused when I did it too. This is referring to the actual database table values (directus_settings) being empty/deleted \u2013 not the values in the Directus GUI. The system should fall back on defaults if the directus_settings table is empty too.\n. Looks good!\n. It seems that column order should be maintained by the schema for performance reasons, and not used for display purposes:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/894522/is-there-any-reason-to-worry-about-the-column-order-in-a-table\nClosing...\n. @jel-massih Is this still an issue?\n. No \u2013 it looks like it's always converted to 0000-00-00 00:00:00\nI don't see this as a pressing issue unless an application called for saving a NULL dae instead of 0000-00-00 00:00:00 \u2013 also, we could always check the datatype after serializing and if it's 0000-00-00 00:00:00 then we convert to NULL. So the date UIs would have an option:\nSave empty dates as NULL [ \u2713 ]\n. Migrated to FeatHub\nPlease use the Directus FeatHub to vote for features or make new request.

Fair enough \u2013 we'll leave it open until we have time to fix it.\n. @WellingGuzman is this the ticket you meant to tag in that last fix?\n. @WellingGuzman Ahh, that makes sense now.

Basically, we want to make sure any mis-configurations give a friendly/understandable alert to let the user know why things are broken.\n. @jel-massih Could you add a description to this issue so we can better understand it and resolve?\n. Hahah \u2013 well it might relate to this one: https://github.com/RNGR/directus6/issues/394 But let's close it until we figure out what's going on here\n. @jel-massih Could you explain why we're using default_status within directus_tables instead of using the table's active column schema default? Was there a reason for this?\n. @jel-massih OK, I agree with your logic \u2013 but since we don't have a interface for editing that setting (and since I'd like to keep things as 1-to-1 with the DB as possible) let's have it pull directly from the schema.\n. @WellingGuzman This should be adjusted so that the default status for a table (if the table has a status column) comes from the status column's default value. So if Table_A has an active column, and the default value for that column is \"2\" then all new items created in that table would default to \"inactive\".\nThis also means that we would remove the default_status under directus_tables and any references to it.\n. Also, works perfectly. Though we should try to incorporate console.log()s for times when settings seem off. For example, it would be ideal (but not necessary) if Directus would send a console.log when the default active value didn't match the status options. Not needed at all for now though... we can always make another ticket later.\nThanks!\n. Should we merge dev into master so we're all caught up? @jel-massih \n. I believe this was taken care of with some of the recent work on the relational settings...\n. Let's chat about how crazy this is... might be 6.1\n. Sounds good \u2013 I'm closing this then.\n. To extend this issue's description: We're looking to create a better drag and drop interface for the item listing page (when the table has a sort column). Currently, dragging and dropping an item causes layout shifts due to the table columns not maintaining width. We'd like to polish this experience. Potentially with a \"line\" placeholder as you re-sort the items.\n. This has been updated to use a new library, and instead of a line, the true element ghost works now\n. We haven't been experiencing this lately \u2013 I'll close and we can re-open if it crops up again.\n. This is now functional\n. Hey @jel-massih \u2013 I'm going to try to better explain this issue so that @WellingGuzman has a better sense of the issue... let me know if I miss anything:\nHere's is how you can replicate the problem:\n1. Go to a table's item listing page and check multiple items\n2. Now a \"Batch Edit\" option appears to edit multiple items at once... click that\n3. Once batch editing, add a NEW item to a relational input (let's call that item \"Foo\")\n4. Upon saving, backbone/directus will save each batched item... but will create a new Foo relational item for EACH item batch edited\nThe reason: backbone doesn't know that all those Foos should actually be the SAME relational item. This causes many duplicate instances of the Foo item all individually linked to their parent items.\n. @jel-massih Nothing has changed since you last saw it \u2013 any idea of how intense it is? It's not critical at the moment, but important later for the usage of bulk edit.\n. Moved this to \"minor\" since it's so complex and relational batch edit is an edge-case feature.\n. Kamino cloned this issue to directus/directus-6-legacy. That's what I thought though it seems to limit differently depending on where we look... @jel-massih \n. @WellingGuzman There's a field to change it in Directus when you add it, correct? Which UIs is this happening for?\n. @WellingGuzman Great \u2013 how difficult would it be to add it in? If more than 30-60 minutes let's just disable it.\n. Great!\n. Closing \u2013 duplicate\n. Can not duplicate in newest version.\n. @jel-massih This is currently based on default_status under directus_tables \u2013 why can this not be based on the default value in the DB schema?\n. Duplicate of https://github.com/RNGR/directus6/issues/410 \u2013 closing.\n. Closing until we have a reproducible example...\n. So it looks like I had to go into the relational overlay (under settings) to change the related table to \"directus_files\" \u2013 however when I try to save that it gives a different error:\n\n. Trying to save a new translation field with a similar error. I was able to resolve the last one by manually adding into the DB, but this one would be a bit trickier: @jel-massih \n\n. This aspect of the issue is resolved. Opening a new ticket for the remainder.\n. added\n. Relates to: https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/1215\n. Yeehaw \u2013 working now! THanks @WellingGuzman \n. We can close this one, yes. There is a big ask to allow Directus to have the option to use a hard-delete policy (actually delete) instead of a soft-delete policy (adjust active flag) \u2013 so I'll open another ticket for that.\nI think what would be best is that if \"active\" exists then it deletes using that, otherwise it actually deletes the item (if that feature is enabled). \n. Closing this issue now that we have a Label for optimization and more specific issues to resolve.\n. The feature/card-style branch has the button (not functioning) already in-place on the Settings>Permissions page\n. No worries \u2013 I think this standard button is better anyway. We'll merge feature/card-style into master tomorrow...\nThanks!\n. @WellingGuzman I'm not sure what happened here either. I think your button (the circle/plus at the top) is better \u2013 can we switch this back to what you had before?\n. This should be resolved on master already, from this commit:\nhttps://github.com/RNGR/directus6/commit/164567bbf75d90b2092187710d0e77dbe5477c4f\nOnce dev is merged in we'll have it across the board...\n. To be more clear:\nIf a column is marked as hidden within settings, it still shows up on the item listing page if it has been saved by that user. For instance:\nhttp://directus.rngr.org/tables/arts\n\nThe unique_key column has been marked as \"hidden\" in settings:\nhttp://directus.rngr.org/settings/tables/arts\n\nBut it still shows up because it's saved within directus_preferences:\n\nWe need to honor the hidden setting even if it's saved as a visible column for the user.\n. @WellingGuzman This seems to partially work, but there are two issues:\n1. The hidden column should disappear from the listing page column select dropdown too  (clicking the gear in the header)\n2. When changing the listing page column select dropdown (clicking the gear in the header) the visible columns should change immediately \u2013 currently you have to refresh the page. This was working before.\n\n. Works perfectly, thanks!\n. @WellingGuzman I'm not 100% sure what Justin meant \u2013 but the issue as I see it is that you can not sort items on the listing page by relational columns. If there's a many-to-one column and you sort on it (clicking the column header) it is not ordered by the relational information... it seems to be ordered by the ID value instead.\nThis would be an AMAZING issue to solve, but I don't know how hard it is.\n. You can see here that ordering this field does not order the results. This is because this is a relational field (saves IDs, not values) \u2013 we should ideally figure out a way to sort by these relational values.\n\n. If any thumbnails are missing in directus we should show a default Directus \"missing image\" icon, not the browser \"broken link\" icon.\n.

Resolved on development (145d53cb01cfc4618be97e68b86bf82ad6f68c71)\n. Adding to this, the framework is not choking \u2013 it is simply not honoring unique composite keys. So if you have composite keys defining unique columns in a table \u2013 Directus should give feedback if a user tries to add duplicate content (conflicting with the unique constraints) and not allow the action.\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/635937/how-do-i-specify-unique-constraint-for-multiple-columns-in-mysql\n. Let's adjust this issue: since the database still enforces the uniqueness, let's just have Directus throw an alert if the user attempts to add a duplicate: \"This item was not saved because its value in [column] is not unique\"\n. @WellingGuzman \nI have added a unique key to directus.rngr.org:\nCREATE TABLE `arts` (\n  `id` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,\n  `unique_key` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,\n  `active` tinyint(1) DEFAULT '2',\n  `header` varchar(200) DEFAULT NULL,\n  `slug` varchar(200) DEFAULT NULL,\n  `subhead` varchar(200) DEFAULT NULL,\n  `body` text,\n  `publish_date` datetime DEFAULT NULL,\n  `image` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,\n  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),\n  UNIQUE KEY `unique_key` (`unique_key`)\n) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=2 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;\nBut when I go to add a new item (or edit an existing item) the framework doesn't give me an alert, it throws a console error (see below), so it seems like this is still not working.\n```\nPOST http://directus.rngr.org/api/1/tables/arts/rows 500 (Internal Server Error) jquery.js?\nERROR: Server Error alerts.js?bust=795fd3d2e2987b6655bae79f4201c4cae345b6c6:53\nundefined app.js?bust=795fd3d2e2987b6655bae79f4201c4cae345b6c6:60\n```\n. Sounds good \u2013 just keep me updated.\n. @WellingGuzman \nTwo issues:\n1. Can we have this alert use the directus alert? (The one visible when you click the logout button)\n2. This is only working for new items, it needs to also work for updated items\n. Looks good! Closing for now, we'll see if anything else comes up...\n. Looks good!\n.

When you drop the item it does stay in the correct spot, but if you have console open it doesn't throw any errors for you?\n. Looks good, not more issue with this. There is a different issue that I'll open in a new ticket.\n. Closing, unless it pops up again...\n. Perfect \u2013 let's move forward with this approach.\n. @WellingGuzman \nIt seems (doing a manual git bisect) that this commit is what breaks it:\nee3ed41b1b953cf5fc45939676b9b19e8d7a921e\n. Looks good!\n. When ordering is not activated the header should display \"ID\" (instead of the current icon) or at least have a rollover title of \"Sorting by ID ASC\"\n. Hey @jel-massih \u2013 I just committed some styling for this (and inverted the active state class) but there is an issue:\nCurrently, this sort feature is activated on click of ANY column header. It should activate only when you click the sort header, and should turn OFF if you click on any other header.\n. @jel-massih Excellent. I had to tweak the code to get the jQuery to work again, but it wasn't too bad.\nThe only problem is when this column is activated, it sorts by ID, not by the SORT column. The only time it should sort by the ID is if all headers are inactive (no sorting). But if you click the reorder header it should show you the results ordered by SORT ASC.\n. I was able to resolve this by adjusting the selector so it could find the data attribute.\n. @WellingGuzman You mentioned 2.0.0 here, but the commit is set to 2.2.0 \u2013 is that intentional?\n. @WellingGuzman Could this be related to the same \"slash instead of dash\" Safari issue you just closed?\n. Looks good!\n. @WellingGuzman I'm getting an error trying to add a field (it adds the field but no record into \"directus_columns\"). I can add the field, but when I go to save the table settings I get:\n<error>\nunderscore.js?bust=921658263a6766b1d8d5fce6c6be45b28bab7381:768 <error>underscore.js?bust=921658263a6766b1d8d5fce6c6be45b28bab7381:768 _.extendunderscore.js?bust=921658263a6766b1d8d5fce6c6be45b28bab7381:813 _.cloneColumnModel.js?bust=921658263a6766b1d8d5fce6c6be45b28bab7381:80 module.exports.Backbone.Model.extend.toJSONbackbone.js?bust=921658263a6766b1d8d5fce6c6be45b28bab7381:1148 Backbone.syncmain.js:337 Backbone.syncbackbone.js?bust=921658263a6766b1d8d5fce6c6be45b28bab7381:289 _.extend.syncbackbone.js?bust=921658263a6766b1d8d5fce6c6be45b28bab7381:492 _.extend.saveTablesView.js?bust=921658263a6766b1d8d5fce6c6be45b28bab7381:617 SettingsTables.Views.Table.BasePageView.extend.saveColumnsjquery-1.11.0.js:4624 n.event.dispatchjquery-1.11.0.js:4292 r.handle\n. @WellingGuzman Probably a similar issue here: https://github.com/RNGR/directus6/issues/645\n. Nope \u2013 this looks like it's solved! Thanks @WellingGuzman \n. Excellent! I'll close this for now and we'll re-open if it shows up again.\n. @WellingGuzman \u2013 I've pulled this change down to my local and I just experienced it again... without even saving any settings.\nSteps to repeat:\n1.

Excellent!\n. Great question @WellingGuzman \u2013 I believe the reason was so that if you do a git pull on the server it doesn't overwrite your configuration file (if you've changed anything). If the file actually exists (instead of a sample) wouldn't it be lost on a pull?\n. I'm going to close this one unless we come up with a good way to not have it overwritten when updating Directus.\n. @WellingGuzman Would you recommend we display some text to alert the user that the database has previous data? We can pause the install and let them decide what to do. Does that sound better for the user?\n. I agree with that \u2013 let's plan on moving forward with your recommendation... but I'll add this as \"minor\" for now, until some of the other items are resolved. Thanks!\n. This is great @WellingGuzman \u2013 thanks for making these adjustments!\n. Perfect!! I'll run some tests today... thanks @WellingGuzman \n. @jel-massih This seems to be working now since it shows the image, however it doesn't allow me to delete the image from that UI any more.\n. @jel-massih Yes, there was a remove button \u2013 this is for a single_file UI (M2O) so it simply NULLified the value in that field.\n. This does not work if the permission has never been clicked (it's new) \u2013 only if it has a record within directus_privileges. It needs to also toggle all permissions on if they don't exist yet...\n. @jel-massih Hey Jason, did you close this by accident? I believe the issue is still present...\nIf you click the row's title before any permissions have been set it does not work properly. Also, it seems to save an abridged set of permissions (either big or normal, but not both).\n. @WellingGuzman If I add a new table to the database directly, then go to Settings > Permissions and click the table name (to toggle all table permissions) I get the following error:\n\n. Closed indeed!\n. @WellingGuzman \u2013 I think this should be a table-specific feature (as mentioned above) since some tables (such as junction tables) might be DELETE while other tables might want to be soft-delete still. Initially I was thinking this would be a global variable, but I think extending the existing permissions system is best.\n. @WellingGuzman The \"magic owner column\" is saved in the user_create_column (previously called: magic_owner\" I believe) field within directus_tables. If a table has a column to track which user created its records, then it should be saved here. This is how we enforce the BIG permissions (BIGedit, BIGview, etc). \n- Edit permission: Means that you can edit only your items (if column saved under directus_tables.user_create_column has your user ID)\n- BIGedit permission: Means that you can edit any users items\nI think it'd be good to switch the naming of these permissions since they seem counterintuitive now. This might be better:\n- AuthorEdit, AuthorDelete, AuthorView for only items you've created\n- Edit, Delete, View for any/all items\nIf table permissions are set to EDIT (not BIGEDIT) you can only edit YOUR items \u2013 so Directus looks for the \"magic owner column\" (which is now called user_create_column) but it's empty, so it throws an error.\nBut you're getting an error with BIGEDIT, which doesn't make as much sense since you should be able to delete ANY records.\n. With BIG permissions things should always work (doesn't need an owner column set) \u2013 since they mean you have permission for all items. \nThere should only be an error if you only have EDIT (not BIGEDIT) since then Directus needs to know who created each item. That way it can check that you're only editing items you created.\n. @WellingGuzman You mention this should be all set \u2013 I'll close for now, we'll continue to test to see if there are any issues.\n. All set\n. Hey @WellingGuzman \u2013 the default for this is currently based on default_status within directus_tables. However, depending on which environment this screenshot is from this value might not be reflecting the correct value.\nEither way, there is another Github issue/ticket for switching this to pull directly from the database schema \u2013 default value for active (or whatever status column is chosen) column.\n. Thanks @WellingGuzman \nThat is odd \u2013 @jel-massih do you have any ideas on what might be causing this? Was it a recent change you made? Would now be a good time to remove the default_status column from directus_tables and instead pull the default from the schema?\n. @WellingGuzman Are you still having this problem?\n. good to hear! \n:thumbsup:\n. fixed with 7812b2c500341a38b8781ccb5bdea0bc46b3681a\n. That sounds perfect @WellingGuzman \u2013 I agree that a user model would help organize some missing methods like getAvatar. Then we can have fewer \"missing\" user photos since it can more easily fall-back on Gravatar's defaults if an upload isn't present.\n. Excellent \u2013 will reopen if it pops up again.\n. This is great, @jmsrngr will be excited about this one!\n. Hey @WellingGuzman \u2013 just so you know, it looks like there is an option in the single_file UI to restrict file types, but I just checked and it seems as though it doesn't do anything. \n. @WellingGuzman The \"From your computer\" should always work, I'm not sure why it is broken. But if you already have an image and choose a new one from your computer then it would replace the current one.\n. The following text should be added to the bottom of any outgoing email from Directus:\n```\nThis email was sent by Directus \u2013 Project Title\nLog in to manage your email preferences\n```\n. Great! Thanks Welling!\n. @WellingGuzman That makes sense. Although I believe there was a good reason for shifting all dates to be GMT instead of server time. For example, some times your server location changes, and then the database would be incorrect. Is it possible to adjust your 30 day check to work with GMT?\n. Ahh, it looks like you already did ;)\nYour fix is great...\n. Migrated to FeatHub\nPlease use the Directus FeatHub to vote for features or make new request. Accepted feature requests will be added to GitHub Issues.\n. Yeah, I wasn't sure for a long time... thanks @WellingGuzman !\n. Yes, but without the word \"TABLES\" at the top \u2013 it would be up to the admin to decide if that should be there.\n. @WellingGuzman Could we add a \"try\" to the JSON decode so that if it is malformed we use the default and show a console.log: \"The nav override JSON for this user group is malformed \u2013 the default nav will be used instead\"\n. @WellingGuzman Looking good \u2013 but all of my links are taking me to /tables \u2013 any idea why?\n. @WellingGuzman You're right. I know this used to only pull in activity for that item \u2013 I don't know when it stopped working. Could it be from the \"30 days\" activity update you did?\n. @WellingGuzman Do you remember if this was resolved?\n. @WellingGuzman This was a duplicate of issue https://github.com/RNGR/directus6/issues/430 \u2013 so I just closed the other one.\n. Looks good!\n. @WellingGuzman This is working for new tables made in Directus, but if a table is added in the database directly and you add permissions then it doesn't move into the sidebar until you refresh.\n. Seems to still have some issues \u2013 when toggling VIEW on/off it doesn't seem to work after the first time.\nBut that's ok... no need to spend more time on this one. Closing and we can re-open if it becomes a more serious issue.\n. @WellingGuzman I agree \u2013 I think the step is confusing and could be handled 90% of the time by defaults and programmatic guesswork. Let's remove the step, and have it insert educated default values.\nGreat recommendation!\n. @WellingGuzman As I mentioned in the comments of the pull-request \u2013 if any of the media paths don't exist or aren't writable, then on the confirmation page we should have the following alert text in red:\n\"The default upload directories are either missing or don't have write permission. You can add these directories/permissions on your server or update the directus_storage_adapters table with new paths.\"\n. @WellingGuzman Perfect!\n. The basic way it works is: if you have PERMISSION to do something to the table you can do it. So even if it's not listed, if you have VIEW permission then it's OK to see the page. But the page should only save if you have EDIT permission.\nSo what you're describing seems OK since your user has permission to VIEW the table. The incorrect UI is unfortunate, but if people are bypassing the provided list then that is expected.\n. @WellingGuzman Technically you should not be able to see that page (since you don't have view permission) so this makes sense \u2013 but we need to make it friendlier:\nRedirect to the table-listing page with a Directus-style alert: \"You do not have permission to view that page or it doesn't exist\"\n. Looks good!\n. Asterisks used to show up for required fields, is it just for this user page?\nIt's working here:\nhttp://directus.rngr.org/tables/arts/new\n. @WellingGuzman Maybe asterisks are not showing up there because it's a system page? I know they work in other places...\n. I see asterisks now!\n. @WellingGuzman Why is that? If you don't have hard or soft delete permission then that option should not be available.\n. @WellingGuzman So for now the soft-delete feature is handled by the EDIT permission, not the DELETE permission \u2013 correct? I think that makes sense since that's what's actually happening.\n. @WellingGuzman If you're saying that soft-delete is currently managed by the DELETE permission then let's leave it as is. Having all delete options (soft and hard) managed by the same permission makes sense.\n. Looks good, I thought there was an issue with adding tables directly, but we can open a new ticket for that if it still exists\n. @WellingGuzman I think we want the process to be:\nNo active column and no hard-delete permission\nThrows warning: \"Please add an active column to this table for soft-delete, or change your group permissions to allow for a hard-delete\"\nNo active column and does have hard-delete permission\nHard-delete\nActive column and hard-delete permission\nHard-delete\nActive column and no hard-delete permission\nSoft-delete\n. @WellingGuzman I think this is a great idea \u2013 I'll mark it as an optimization for now, but once we have all existing features stable then we can look into this.\n. Migrated to FeatHub\nPlease use the Directus FeatHub to vote for features or make new request. Accepted feature requests will be added to GitHub Issues.\n. @WellingGuzman Does the installation do a check to see if those default paths exist? It should, and if they don't exist or aren't writable it should alert the user (not a new step, just an alert).\n. Looks good.\n. This is also happening to the multiple files UI \u2013 for example, you can't delete the image from Slideshow on that same page:\nhttp://directus.rngr.org/tables/fitness\n. @WellingGuzman I am getting a permission error still. \nhttp://directus.rngr.org/tables/accommodations\nIf I change a non-relational item on this page it works.\nBut if I try to delete a relational item I get this:\n\nSomething is either wrong with the permissions (I checked, I have full permissions for that table) or the delete. Once fixed, please update this remote server so we know it's resolved.\n. @WellingGuzman This seems to be resolved now unless you know of any other issues. \nJunction tables should not have an active column (HARD-DELETE only) \u2013 if it does we can always reopen ticket https://github.com/RNGR/directus6/issues/576.\n. @WellingGuzman Half of this has been completed, thanks!\nThere are now checkboxes on the File select, so that's good \u2013 but previously the user could click the entire row and it would select the file (auto-check the box). Not sure when this was removed, or if it's part of standardization \u2013 but it was a useful feature.\n. @WellingGuzman Also, there are two other issues:\n1. Not Saving: Once clicked, save doesn't work. So even if you have an image selected, it won't save back to the UI. Console.log says: \"Save\" but nothing happens.\n2. Single File:Also, when coming from a single UI field only one file should be selectable. Ideally, when you click the image it should auto-save and return you to the UI.\n3. Multiple Files: If a UI accepts multiple files then you should click files to select them, then you'd hit the save button (\"check\") to save into the UI. If the UI has a restriction on how many files it will accept this should be honored by the File Select Overlay.\n. Interesting, let me make sure my local is up-to-date with cache cleared and I'll test again.\n. @WellingGuzman I have updated the remote server with the most recent commits. Does this page work for you?\nhttp://directus.rngr.org/tables/fitness\nClicking \"Directus Files\" beside \"Schedule PDF\" opens the list select overlay... but I can't click items, and it doesn't save.\n. Lookin good!\n. @WellingGuzman It's odd, I am actually not seeing this on my local instance of Directus \u2013 only when I upgraded a client's version to the development branch. So my only thought is something changed in the DB schema or in the settings saved in the database.\n. @WellingGuzman Perfect! Once the current \"urgent\" bugs are resolved let's do this. Ruckusing it is!\n. @WellingGuzman Should we leave this issue open until things are further along or is this first pass looking pretty good?\n. Excellent! Closing...\n. No, this doesn't seem to be happening anymore. I'll close, and reopen if anything comes up.\n. Haha\n. @WellingGuzman For this, do you mean that when you change the permission to \"delete\" (or any other non-big permission) the permissions page would ask you for the owner column? This makes sense, though we'll have to figure out a good way to prompt the user. \nMaybe one of the directus alerts with a dropdown of fields in that table?\n. @WellingGuzman What are you thinking for this one?\n. @WellingGuzman So is there no delete (delete only your items) versus big-delete (delete anyone's items) permission? Only one type of delete permission? Why is that?\n. @WellingGuzman I will close this as a duplicate of https://github.com/RNGR/Directus/issues/893 \u2013 basically you can delete anyone's items still. It would be nice however, if the permissions page warned you if you don't have a \"record owner\" column setup but choose allow_delete=1\n. Yeah, that will be a good use of it! Nice to have these helper systems built in. But #892 also has the special ability to pull straight from a class/data-attribute so it's easy to setup more popup click events in the front-end.\n. I agree @WellingGuzman  \u2013 this is not really necessary since junction tables should not have an active column. Going to close for now.\n. @WellingGuzman insert a value where? In an input on the edit page?\n. This is great @WellingGuzman \u2013 thanks!\nThe only problem is that the sorting of relational items is not saving \u2013 but it sorts correctly on the front-end.\nOn this page:\nhttp://directus.rngr.org/tables/dining\nThings sort correctly, but if you save the page and go back you'll see that the order column (on the junction table) was not saved.\n. Going to close this for now, removal of the active column on the related table resolves the issue and junction table items should always DELETE..\n. Here is an example of an error from the shorter permissions.\n\n. @WellingGuzman You're right! It is fine that this is hardcoded \u2013 but we need to check to make sure the current user is an Admin.\n. Perfection...\n. Lookin good!\n. Your last PR works perfectly @WellingGuzman \u2013 thanks!\nThe only problem is that the sorting of relational items is not saving \u2013 but it sorts correctly on the front-end.\nOn this page:\nhttp://directus.rngr.org/tables/dining\nThings sort correctly, but if you save the page and go back you'll see that the order column (on the junction table) was not saved.\n. This is looking great! I'm not seeing any issues \u2013 I'll reopen if something comes up. Thanks @WellingGuzman \n. @WellingGuzman Was this one resolved by the PR above?\n. The first part of this (displaying in the correct order) seems to be solved, but there is still a small issue saving. If you have 5 items (saved in the junction table) with sort == NULL... if you drag and drop them and save you get:\nNULL, 1, 2, 3, 4\nIt should save:\n0, 1, 2, 3, 4\nI think this orders OK still, but we should correct this eventually. I'm changing this to minor for now.\n. Great!\n. I'm seeing this issue again... can we check to see if the previous fix is still working?\n. OK, fixed!\n. @WellingGuzman On deirectus.rngr.org? Which page? Does that table have an active and sort column?\n. Will re-open if appears again\n. Great!\n. Is there a way to maintain the AWS/Rackspace dependencies commented out in the composer file, or in another \"inactive\" file?\n. @WellingGuzman I like the idea of the complete \"dev\" build requiring those extra dependencies \u2013 but I agree we can deal with that later.\n. Hey @WellingGuzman \u2013 I agree, I think it's important for M2O to be required when there's no ALLOW NULL... but for M2M it doesn't matter since they are individual rows.\nThe only problem is that the settings page still disables the Required option checkbox for M2M (so you have to change it directly in the DB for now:\n\n. Looks good!\n. @WellingGuzman That sounds good to me. Are you only talking about the naming?\nCurrently:\n- Messages are the emails that are sent within Directus (/messages)\n- Comments are messages attached to a specific table-item (seen at the bottom of the edit pages)\n- Notifications are the errors/alerts/warnings/notifications that come up in the bottom-right of the screen at times\n. @WellingGuzman That sounds good. Would the sidebar still update if there are new messages (the green dot next to \"Messages\"? And if you are on the \"Messages\" page would you see a new message appear without refreshing?\nIf so, this sounds good! \n. @WellingGuzman Perfect.\n. @WellingGuzman Do you want to keep this issue open to reference your comment above? Or is there another ticket for this?\n. Two years later!! Finally squashed \u2013 nice!. I wonder about the directus_storage_adapters table too... when deploying a site to production or updating all data in the database this table is always excluded since it's tied to the server directories. Should this storage adapter data move to the untracked config/configuration file? The only downside is that that directus_files references the storage adapter in the DB.\nThoughts @WellingGuzman ?\n. Just another note to change \"snapshots\" to \"bookmarks\" throughout the system. Snapshots seems to imply that the data within won't change... in reality these are simply bookmarks to specific filtered pages.\n.

This is not really an issue \u2013 and will be addressed with the update to the Settings page. https://github.com/RNGR/Directus/issues/997\n. @WellingGuzman I agree \u2013 they should be the same. I think this was part of the SLIM routing... since the slash meant to look for an ID or NEW in the URL... but the routes should still work with what you've added here.\n. Hey @Nokser \u2013 be sure to check out the development branch, it is stable and very far ahead of master \u2013 we'll be merging it in soon. Thank you for your contribution though!\n. @WellingGuzman \u2013 I feel like this is related to:\nhttps://github.com/RNGR/directus6/issues/481\n. @WellingGuzman I added a ONETOMANY and after trying to use it I get:\nServer Error\nRequired column/ui metadata columns on table capabilities lack values: table_related junction_key_right\ndirectus_columns doesn't have a junction_key_right saved, so maybe it's not completely saving?\n. I haven't been seeing it \u2013 I will close and reopen if it occurs again. Thanks!\n. This works perfectly, thanks @WellingGuzman \nIs it possible to include the same feature on other pages (non-overlay)? There are two places I think this would be useful:\nListing Pages: If you go from a longer, scrolling listing page (or the Files page) to an edit page, then save the item... you go back to the item listing page, but back at the top. Would there be a way to return the user to the scroll position within the item listing? Also, if we could briefly highlight the item you're coming from on the listing page... that would also resolve https://github.com/RNGR/directus6/issues/109\n1. On Projects Listing Page\n2. Scroll down to lower item\n3. Click on lower item to edit\n4. Edit the item and hit \"save\"\n5. Directus returns you to the item listing page, scrolled to where you were before\n6. (Bonus) Briefly highlighting the item you were editing for reference (there is an existing highlight/hover color we can use)\nNavigation: If the list of tables in the sidebar is taller than the viewport you need to scroll down to see the lower tables/navigation. Currently, if you click on a nav item (when scrolled down) it navigates you to that page, but also resets your sidebar scroll back to the top. With a longer nav list this would be annoying since you lose track of where you were.\n. @WellingGuzman It seems to be scrolling to the right place now, but maybe the re-render is still causing some issues. The FlashRow doesn't seem to be happening, so maybe that's the render?\n. @WellingGuzman \n1. Click a into an item from the listing page\n2. Edit that item\n3. Hit Save\n4. It takes me back to the listing page (with the correct scroll!)\n5. But it does not highlight or flash the row I was just editing\nI assume that is what RowFlash is suppose to do?\n. Perfection.\n. Migrated to FeatHub\nPlease use the Directus FeatHub to vote for features or make new request. Accepted feature requests will be added to GitHub Issues.\n. Good adjustment @WellingGuzman  \u2013 could we also have any missing user avatars show the default image?\n/assets/img/missing-directus-avatar.png\n. Looks good!\n. @WellingGuzman That makes sense... I'll test later today, but this should be good to go!\n. Good to go, indeed!\n. @WellingGuzman I don't think this is a very useful feature given that most Directus installs will use a dedicated database. Let's comment out this feature from the Installation file and close the issue. We can re-open in later versions.\n. Nice. I don't think the \"prefix\" would be used too often, so it's good to avoid the added complexity until it's more requested.\n. This doesn't seem to be happening any more... will close unless it appears again.\n. Working for me...\n. @WellingGuzman there was a feature built into Directus to \"favorite\" important tables \u2013 this was most useful when there were many tables to make it easier to find the most used ones.\nWe can remove that now since we allow for customizable sidebars and have \"bookmarks\" for the edit pages.\nTotally weird that tables starting with \"0\" are getting that though...\n. @WellingGuzman Sounds good. Let's discuss how we want to approach this.\n. Migrated to FeatHub\nPlease use the Directus FeatHub to vote for features or make new request. Accepted feature requests will be added to GitHub Issues.\n. That seems to have fixed it!\n. @WellingGuzman Should we close this issue or is there more to be done?\n. Awesome.\n. @WellingGuzman This one relates to this issue: https://github.com/RNGR/Directus/issues/694\nHopefully we can remove both these fields (Footer and Junction Table)\n. @WellingGuzman I think for now we can just have the footer default to on (no field level control yet). This will simplify the Settings interface and give useful footer info all the time.\n. @WellingGuzman Much better! Though the footer item itself seems to be displaying in the wrong column. Also, it would be nice if it were below the table (not the last row with highlighting)... is there a way to do this? I know it needs to technically be in the table for column spacing... but perhaps it can appear below by using a negative bottom margin or something?\n\n. @WellingGuzman Yeah, ideally. So that little \"speech bubble\" goes below the table/card view.\n. perfection!\n. Looks great! At some point we should adjust the page padding so the page height doesn't \"jump\" when you roll-over the footer bubble. But that's a small change!\n. Hey @WellingGuzman \u2013 This footer should only exist on listing pages, not on UI/detail pages. We should disable it there if possible.\n. Let's disable the footer for now \u2013 it needs to be column-level (not table-level) which is why we're running into issues with this.\n. I think this is only used for filling in the \"junction table\" input when creating new M2M fields. We can instead just show all tables in that dropdown and remove this junction table param.\nBut maybe we do a quick check to see if it's used anywhere else first.\n. I have commented out the toggle on the Settings > Tables & Inputs page... so we need to get this one wrapped up\n. The toggle is gone, and the settings dropdown no longer limits options to \"junction tables\".\n@WellingGuzman Now we need to remove all references to this in the schema/code.\n. Perfection!\n. Migrated to FeatHub\nPlease use the Directus FeatHub to vote for features or make new request. Accepted feature requests will be added to GitHub Issues.\n. @WellingGuzman It seems that I still can't delete my bookmark, but the error shown above has stopped.\n. @WellingGuzman Odd, it was only the old Bookmark that I couldn't delete... it seems to be working now. Is there a way to highlight that Bookmark item in the sidebar? Currently it highlights the table it's on...\n. An incremental change has been made. We'll sit on this for a bit to see if it helps with contrast, and re-open as needed.\n. I need to wrap up this schema.\n. Hey @liegeandlief \u2013 we've been working on an exciting new Directus platform, but will wrap up a demo site soon (just finalizing a good schema that showcases all the features). I'll follow up here when it's complete.\n. Now that we have a free online trial we don't need a demo. But we should add a more complete example schema into the install. \n. We'll have one eventually, but this is not a priority for our small team of developers. In the meantime, if you don't want to use a credit card you can download the free and open-source version.. @WellingGuzman what's the status of this now that we have an initial version? Can we write up a Wiki (can be \"Draft\" if you want) for this and CLI?\n. Ahh! Good catch, we changed the repo name from \"directus6\" to \"directus\" yesterday. Must have missed this. Updating now.\n. @jwdeitch These links have been updated and should be resolving now. Thanks again for catching this. Also, I've made the Wiki available for editing by the public, so feel free to adjust anything you see as being incorrect.\n. @WellingGuzman I'm not sure why this is showing up as required, it isn't in the fixed schema. Maybe it's being rendered incorrectly?\n/app/schema/fixed/users.js:210\n{\n            \"id\":\"email_messages\",\n            \"column_name\":\"email_messages\",\n            \"type\":\"TINYINT\",\n            \"is_nullable\":\"NO\",\n            \"default_value\":\"1\",\n            \"comment\":\"CMS messages will also be sent to email address above\",\n            \"sort\":6,\n            \"system\":false,\n            \"master\":false,\n            \"hidden_list\":false,\n            \"hidden_input\":false,\n            \"required\":false,\n            \"ui\":\"checkbox\"\n          }\n. @WellingGuzman Great! Should the schema be updated too? Currently that column is ALLOW NULL...\n. Though \u2013 just tested and this seems to be working!\n. @WellingGuzman sounds good. Let me know the options as you see them and we can figure out what's best.\n. @jwdeitch Thank you for this, the styling within Directus is handled by LESS files with variables, so we can't merge this CSS in directly. We've adjusted the contrast through the LESS variable, and will audit your fix for table highlighting. Thanks for your contribution!\n. The query in the screenshot seems to be working fine for me, and I don't see anything wrong with the syntax:\nSELECTdirectus_privileges.* FROMdirectus_privilegesWHEREgroup_id= '1' GROUP BYgroup_id,table_name,status_id``\nThis came from the same user as this issue: https://github.com/RNGR/Directus/issues/720\nI assume this is due to inadequate database user permissions. Will re-open if it occurs again.\n. Thanks @tjmb \u2013 which version of Directus are you running? @WellingGuzman \u2013 I'm re-opening this so we can look into it a bit more.\n. OK, that's what I figured \u2013 @WellingGuzman we can do a merge whenever you feel it's appropriate (good, stable point).\n. I can't see anything wrong with this query \u2013 this must have been caused by inadequate database user permissions. I have updated the Noty Alerts to not wrap text so that the full query can be seen from now on. Closing and will re-open if this occurs again.\n. This seems to be working! Perfect Welling... thanks!\n. Lookin' good!\n. Excellent. We'll close this unless we hear it happening again. Thanks!\n. I was against this level of database ALTER within the system since it could have VERY detrimental effects. But positioning things as a database GUI, I feel that at the ADMIN level only you should have the ability to remove columns. But there needs to be a very clear warning, a recommendation to backup the database, and 1-2 confirmations.\n. Yeah, we have delete functionality now... we just need to add support for aliases. \n. This one seems to be working for me too. Must have been a browser-specific issue with an older version of FireFox. Closing...\n. @WellingGuzman This is pulling in draft items now (when the parameter is on) but it also shows two versions if items that are in the prefetch and the ajax results. We should also find a way to disable the loading screen on keypress. Maybe a \"silent\" parameter for server calls.\n. Looks great! Thanks @WellingGuzman \n. Not getting the error any more, although it seems to not save M2M data sometimes. I'll open a specific ticket with an example.\n. Thoughts on this @WellingGuzman ?\n. Thanks @timovos \u2013 we'll look into this and get it resolved asap\n. I agree, let's figure out how we want to handle trailing slashes once these last few bugs are resolved. We can use the demo server as a good reason to test use cases.\n. Moving this to 6.1 since we're going to (or, already did) comment out the Activity nav item.\n. Migrated to FeatHub\nPlease use the Directus FeatHub to vote for features or make new request. Accepted feature requests will be added to GitHub Issues.\n. @WellingGuzman Hmm, not sure... but maybe:\nWhen you create a column in Directus you choose a UI... and it creates a column with the correct datatype. I'm not sure how it knows which datatype to choose \u2013 but it should use the UI itself.\nSince the UI lists the datatypes it works with, we should say that the FIRST datatype in that list is the best/default. So if you create a field with a certain UI it looks at the UI code (dataTypes: ['TEXT', 'VARCHAR']) and chooses the first one.\nDoes that make sense? Do you think that's what it was?\n. Yes!!!!!\n. No need to do it on the listing page (yet)... but we can still delete them from the detail page. Right? If that's working then we can probably close this.\n. Currently admins can view/delete any users... however, the status column is also available to normal users for their OWN account. This means that a non-admin user can draft or delete their own account. This should be disabled.\nAlso, users should be able to see (view only) other user detail pages.\n. I see the users listing and detail pages as a corporate directory \u2013 so I like the idea of people having view access to all users. We should hide certain fields for non-admins though (token, pass, email_messages, etc)... basically it's a profile page.\nThis will also help with this feature when we're ready to add it:\nhttp://feathub.com/directus/directus/+5\n. Yeehaw!\n. Whew, thanks Welling!\n. Looks good!\n. Good call @WellingGuzman \u2013 This setting exists on the input UI for files, but maybe it is not being enforced?\nhttp://thedirectus.com/settings/tables/articles (then click the gear for Hero Image)\n. Ahh, that makes sense. Can we control those server settings? Or does the user have to implement on their server?\n. I agree \u2013 it can always default to off too. I just wonder about Directus being used for asset management, maybe some people need to manage code files?\n. Oooh, ugly! I'll see if I can take care of that if you don't have time to give it a try.\n. This is amazing @WellingGuzman \u2013 so exciting to have a command-line interface for the install! Thanks for putting this together, and let me know when you think we're in a good place to merge with master.\n. @WellingGuzman \u2013 how would this work? Would we add an \"admin\" boolean field to directus_groups? That seems like it might be best.\n. We can avoid using \"admin\" if we want, but still need to break apart the admin abilities into permissions:\nAdmin special abilities:\n- Can add/edit/delete any user\n- Access to settings (including adjusting permissions)\n- Maybe some other things?\nAll of this could be handled by our existing permissions:\n- add/big-edit/big-delete on directus_users\n- add/big-edit/big-delete on directus_settings, directus_permissions, etc\nSo maybe we just determine it based on that? But what happens if a group only has partial permissions for settings? Would they not see the settings \"gear\" icon?\nWhat is \"super-admin\" for? What can they do beyond the above? Do you think permissions in JSON is better than the fields I mentioned in my last email?\nFor directus_privileges (group access for each table):\ntable_name \u2013 Same\ngroup_id \u2013 Same\nstatus_id \u2013 Same\nread_field_blacklist \u2013 Same\nwrite_field_blacklist \u2013 Same\nlisted \u2013 [0,1] Reverses from unlisted, controls nav and table listing (no need for another navlisting field)\nview \u2013 [0, 1, 2] Separate fields, 0=none, 1=view, 2=big-view\nadd \u2013 [0, 1] Separate fields, 0=none, 1=add\nedit \u2013 [0, 1, 2] Separate fields, 0=none, 1=edit, 2=big-edit\ndelete \u2013 [0, 1, 2] Separate fields, 0=none, 1=delete, 2=big-delete\nalter \u2013 [0, 1] Separate fields, 0=none, 1=alter\n. Hey @WellingGuzman \u2013 this is great. My thoughts:\nIt seems that our existing permissions can handle almost all of this (hiding system nav items, etc) \u2013 which is great! \nFor the settings gear, I think we show the settings they have appropriate access for:\n- Gear => any of the below\n- Global Settings => directus_settings\n- Media => directus_settings\n- Tables & Inputs => directus_ui, directus_tables, directus_columns\n- Permissions => directus_users, directus_groups, directus_privileges\nAs for Super-Admin, I like your thinking \u2013 but it might be overkill. Let's keep it simple for now so it's all based on these normal permissions.\nI also see what you're saying with JSON versus fields for permissions \u2013 but I think fields will be a little clearer from a database perspective (especially if devs choose to edit directly in the DB). JSON syntax is too easy to mess up when editing by hand, and it's harder to write to individually. I don't think we'll be adding new permissions any time soon. We could also add in the \"drop\" field now but leave it unused \u2013 so it's in the schema... but that might be messy. It's easy to add a field later.\n. Ahh, I get it. So would we add an \"Admin\" field boolean to the directus_groups table? Or were you thinking that we would base it on the existing directus table privileges?\n. Thoughts? @WellingGuzman \n. Yes, but maybe it's \"is_admin\" instead of \"show_settings\" so it's clearer what that entails.\n. We've adjusted our approach to this problem \u2013 now we're using \"allow_\" prefixed permissions.\n. @WellingGuzman \u2013 I agree. I'd say let's abandon any old browser restrictions. If we don't need to save the temp file for any reason then let's not save it! Does that mean that we would get rid of that folder too? Is there any reason we would want/need to keep that directory?\n. Based on this (http://caniuse.com/#feat=filereader) I would say that we should be fine to use the FileReader method. At this point it would be good to clean/refine the framework as much as possible... keep it quick and simple. So let's plan on deleting the temp folder and implementing the FileReader for preview (and Title if not supported).\nThanks!\n. @WellingGuzman I know we didn't remove the temp directory, but we did resolve this issue of temp files not deleting. I'll close this until we figure out how we want to handle the temp directory.\n. @WellingGuzman can't we do this by pushing a history state?. Yeah, I think that should do it!. Migrated to FeatHub\nPlease use the Directus FeatHub to vote for features or make new request. Accepted feature requests will be added to GitHub Issues.\n. hidden applies to the table system-wide... as for junction tables, they are completely hidden from the whole system. unlisted means that a specific group will not see that table listed in the sidebar or table-listing.\nunlisted is more useful since it's controlled per user-group... we could keep that and remove hidden if you want. Then we can just hide anything flagged as  is_junction_table.\nThoughts?\n. @WellingGuzman Correct, I think we could remove the global hidden (directus_tables) and only use hidden (directus_privileges)\n. @WellingGuzman I agree with this thinking, and it'd be great to consolidate all of this into the schemaManager if possible. The only issue I see is that you say that hidden will not let that table be editable... but junction tables need to be editable (permission-wise) so that we can adjust relationships.\nAlso, unlisted would hide tables from the sidebar and the Table Listing page.\nWhen we resolve this ticket we'll have control over the system nav items (show_users, show_files, show_activity, show_messages). The original purpose of nav_blacklist was to manage all nav items (Extensions, Tables, Users, Files, Activity, Messages)... but it's only managing Tables. We have nav_override which can be used to adjust the sidebar tables. The only thing not managed is Extensions \u2013 so maybe nav_blacklist becomes extension_blacklist (per group)?\nTo summarize:\n- hidden \u2013 system-level, hides tables but allows for editing (need to edit junction tables)\n- unlisted \u2013 group-level, hides tables from sidebar and table-listing (boolean column)\n- show_users, show_activity, show_messages, and show_files \u2013 group-level, hides system nav items (boolean columns)\n- extension_blacklist \u2013 group-level, hides extensions (CSV of extension IDs)\n- nav_override \u2013 group-level allows custom order/groupings for tables in sidebar (stays the same)\n. That's great! @WellingGuzman \nWhen you say the rest is implemented, do you mean the \"show_messages\" fields too? I am not seeing those here or on the dev server (with git hooks to the dev branch):\nhttps://github.com/RNGR/Directus/blob/development/api/schema.sql\n. Ahh, that makes sense. Let me know when this is up and I'll review!\nThanks @WellingGuzman !\n. Looks great!!\n. If you can update the dev server with the most recent schema I'll review! Thanks @WellingGuzman \n. Yeehaw!\n. This has been updated. Not overridable as of now, but could be extended to allow for this in the future.\n. Style and copy has been updated\n. @WellingGuzman Hmm, I'm still getting this issue on my dev environment after pulling this update. Was it resolved for you?\n. @WellingGuzman I agree \u2013 I think we should implement across the framework, so we should definintely add it into the core UIs!\nThanks Welling\n. Thanks Welling! And I've updated this to match the design...\n. I have commented out the code that auto-adds \"activity\" into directus_bookmarks, but to remove the item from existing installations you need to remove the database entry.\n. Should be all set on dev branch\n. Instead of the smaller nav bar we were using before, now there's a hamburger and full slide-out nav.\n. I imagine this could be saved within directus_columns either as it's own record \"delimiting\" a space between groups (using the sort column), or as a new  \"group\" column in that table that stores the parent group for that input.\n. As for an interface, on the Settings > Tables & Inputs there should be a \"Add New Grouping Label\".\nClicking that adds a row where the user can type a label.\n@benhaynes to design\n.

Migrated to FeatHub\nPlease use the Directus FeatHub to vote for features or make new request. Accepted feature requests will be added to GitHub Issues.\n. That sounds great!\n. @WellingGuzman ... Did it work?!\n. @WellingGuzman \nOK, that makes sense. That parameter was to show the date (on the item listing page) as contextual (13 min ago) instead of the timestamp (8:44p). So it must be ordering by that string.\nIt's nice on that page to see that things were uploaded \"5 seconds ago\"... so hopefully there's a way to show that but still order correctly. If it's too hard, we can just show the timestamp. Thoughts?\n. @WellingGuzman Yes! This makes sense and would be an amazing thing to have. Although, would we need this too:\nValue, Representation, and Sort\nUnless you think the value is always sortable. If they are the same then what you described would be perfect.\n. @WellingGuzman Awesome, that seems like a good plan!\n. @WellingGuzman Any updates here?\n. Sometimes it's there and sometimes it isn't... it seems to be an inconsistency due to the plugin and cascading styles to the iFrame it uses. Closing for now...\n. Maybe this is ordered by ID and it's getting confused when it hits another digit?\n999 vs 10000\nI checked my preferences and they are correct, but images are all over the place in the listing view.\n. All set.\n. Closing \u2013 this requires:\n-webkit-appearance: none;\n-webkit-border-radius: 0px;\nWhich also removes the triangle...\n. Yes! That's much better. So there would be a single datatime UI that changes based on the datatype being: date, time, datetime, timestamp, or year? This is much better because we can really polish up that UI and add more options and it will remove a lot of duplicate code. Great thinking @WellingGuzman !\n. Some Options: (can anyone think of more good ones?)\n- Read Only \n- Datetime Format: HH:mm:ss\n- Show Contextual Date In List View\n- Auto-Populate When Hidden And Null\n- Use Dropdowns (instead of HTML5 inputs)\n- Timezone?\n. (nice, I opened one)\n. @WellingGuzman \u2013 OK, good. I can't remember if I had an issue pulling to a remote server... since this was a month ago. But I will reopen this ticket if I notice that happening. Thanks!\n. @WellingGuzman This sounds good. I wasn't sure if there was a more automated process out there... but I like this.\nSo let's get everything on dev nice and stable and then we can merge into master, increment the subversion, and tag a release version. Perfect!\nWhen do you think we'll be good for another master merge? Is our DB migration up-to-date?\n. @WellingGuzman I like it... that sounds good to me!\n. These have been made... will be merged with others\n. @WellingGuzman  Thanks! I had actually updated the SQL file but forgot to push it up. I will merge it in now since it has the status_id defaulting to NULL (which it should) and adds in comments for the table.\n. Added this extra bit of functionality to this FeatHub ticket.\n. Awesome, I'll take a look at this in a bit once it's wrapped up. Thanks!!\n. @WellingGuzman Maybe because there was no dropdown to select the status type and it needed to show active? I'd say if we add in the filter we should be ok to adjust this.\n. @WellingGuzman Awesome! The only thing is that if you make a user inactive or deleted it should log them out next time the server is polled. Currently it let's them navigate around (and see data) or shows an error from getAvatar()... or an empty/gray page when they refresh the page. \nCan we have it log them out? Maybe with an alert like this (similar to inactive logout):\n\nAlso, it seems that \"Nothing to see here\" is showing up even with active users:\n\nLastly, could we have inactive users show up in a group labeled \"Inactive\" at the end and make them opacity:0.4?\n\n. @WellingGuzman Looking great!! A few small fixes:\nCould the \"Inactive\" group always be last on the users page?\nIs there a way to logout users (who are logged in) when their account is made inactive/deleted?\n. @WellingGuzman \nFor the auto-logout... once the user refreshes the page they lose their ability to see private data. Is it possible to check if the current user is active with each API/page request and force refresh them if they are inactive? Or redirect them to the /logout page?\n. I'll call this a new feature... we can implement in the next version.\n. @WellingGuzman OK, I agree. I can't think of a scenario where we'd want an inactive file... but maybe it's best to soft-delete files and leave the asset on the server. That way an admin could always retrieve the record/file?\n. Yes, I think that's best for now.\n. Hey @WellingGuzman how are we currently handling file deletion? If we're soft-deleting it then this ticket can be closed. My only question is, does it make sense to leave the file in the main media directory or should we move it to an inactive directory? My concern is if you upload a file with the same name it will cause an issue even though the first is \"deleted\".\n. OK, then I'll close this issue since #1004 and #1003 are now open.\n. Do I need to adjust anything on my local machine? I am using the most recent commit... but maybe there was a schema change?\n\nAnd then if I refresh:\n\n. That seems to be fixed... but my uploads are not working. I'll add a separate ticket to figure that out though. Thanks!!\n. @WellingGuzman Does this relate to the other mod_rewrite issue we're seeing here? https://github.com/RNGR/Directus/issues/994\n. Sounds good. \n. @WellingGuzman \u2013 Yes, I agree!\n. Perfect!\n. @WellingGuzman \u2013 Ahh, so is it like this:\n- 0: You can't delete\n- 1: You can soft-delete your own (delete)\n- 2: You can soft-delete anyones (big-delete)\n- 3: You can delete your own (hard-delete)\n- 4: You can delete anyones (big-hard-delete)\nI couldn't remember if we were only using 0,1,2 and the hard was determined by the existence of a status field or not.\nIf that's the case, should we make the default delete permission \"4\"? And yes, I agree that it should fallback on update (soft) if you have hard-delete permissions but there's no status column.\nMeaning, if you have allow_delete=4 with an active column... you should still be able to soft delete items. Just not the other way around.\n. @WellingGuzman Perfect \u2013 I think this is a bit easier to understand, especially when saving permissions. So we'll remove 3/4 from allow_delete and use the existence of the status column to differentiate.\nI like it!\n. @WellingGuzman \u2013 We can use this ticket since it has the comments...\n. Hey @WellingGuzman \u2013 what is the status of the 3/4 states being removed?\n. @WellingGuzman Again, looking good! But I'm having an issue with delete=1 (only delete yours) with the following setup:\n- I added \"user_created\" to Table A\n- I added my user ID to that column for only one record within Table A\n- I added \"user_created\" to \"user_create_column\" under directus_tables for Table A\n- I set the Table A permissions to allow_delete=1\n- I tested and it allows me to delete any items\nAny thoughts? Am I setting up the user_create_column incorrectly? Maybe we should show some sort of warning on the permissions page if they don't have the user_create_column setup with a column?\n\n\"Can Delete Their Items\" could say:\n\"Can delete their items: user_created\"\nor...\n\"Can delete their items: no column chosen\"\n. @WellingGuzman I see the column name under permissions:\n\nBut I can still delete items that are mine, another user, or NULL... I should only be able to delete items that are mine though. I am testing this from the listing page and detail page... and this is a soft-delete table.\nThoughts?\n. I will try to get it happening on the dev server today/tonight so we're looking at the same thing.\n. @WellingGuzman \u2013 OK, I have the dev server setup to showcase the issue:\nThe administrator permissions for the offices table are delete=1 (only delete yours)\nThe user_create_column for directus_tables:offices is set to user_created\nGo to...\nhttp://thedirectus.com/tables/offices\nAnd  you can delete any items (the one created by Justin and all NULLs).\nIs this because Admins have special/all abilities? If so, then we need to remove the privileges/permissions area for them.\n. Looks good!\n. @WellingGuzman \u2013 I'm getting a few errors doing different things:\nNot sure what caused this one:\nServer Error\nset() expects an array of values\nSome things I noticed:\n- It goes to the bookmark URL but immediately changes to this: http://thedirectus.com/tables/offices\n- I noticed that within directus_bookmarks some URLs have a leading slash and others don't\n- I can't tell where it saves the filters you have on when bookmarking (directus_preferences?)\n- It doesn't seem to save the active state for listing pages (View All, Active, Draft, etc) under directus_bookmarks>active\n- I added a bookmark called \"Offices?\" and I think the URL needs to either encode the char or we should probably regex the chars allowed in the Bookmark name\nWhat it's supposed to save when you create a bookmark:\n- Page (this is all it needs unless it's a listing page)\n- Statuses being viewed (all, active, draft, etc)\n- All filters\n- Visible columns\n- Sorted column\n- Column sort direction\n. Also, we need to keep the Bookmark group in the sidebar even if there are no Bookmarks... otherwise no one will be able to add them. ;)\nI can make this adjustment if you want... it's easy enough to remove an \"if\" statement.\n. @WellingGuzman \u2013 I'll test now, thanks! I remember the bookmarks working before, but I hadn't thoroughly tested it in a few months so I could be wrong. I'll see what issues there are now... \n. It seems that creating a bookmark is partially working, but it seems to be saving incorrectly. It seems like it's saving the previous state of the page. For instance: If I create bookmark A, then bookmark B... then clicking A takes me to B, and clicking B takes me to where I went after saving B. Very confusing, I know!\nCould you take a look to see why these aren't going to the correct filters when clicked, @WellingGuzman ?\n. @WellingGuzman \u2013 This is working MUCH better... here are the only two issues I can see now:\nSave Status\nThe bookmark is not saving the status state (in the dropdown in the header) of \"View All\", \"View Active\", \"View Inactive\". So if you save a bookmark with ACTIVE and then go to INACTIVE... when you click on the bookmark it should take you back to ACTIVE.\nNot Navigating After One Click\nWhen I click on a bookmark, it works as expected... but then if I change the sort and filter and click the bookmark again it no longer updates the page. I see the URL flicker, but it doesn't update the parameters again. Everytime you click the bookmark it should take you to that page with the saved parameters.\nBONUS\nIs there anyway to highlight the bookmark in the sidebar when you are viewing it? I know this is probably complex since it's hard to know when you're viewing a bookmark versus a table.\n. Every once in a while I do something that NULL-ifies some of the directus_preferences fields. I'm not sure what's causing it... and I can't replicate now. I will close this and open a new ticket if I can figure out what the cause is.\nThanks Welling... especially for the bonus!\n.

It was noted that we could inspect database tables for auto increment and unique keys to determine this information, which works for the vast majority of cases (notably not all though). We should look into this to see if we can avoid adding a setting to Directus, instead pulling from the schema directly.\n. Also, making a note that we should look into how we'd handle tables with no primary key. Having a dynamic name is complex, but possible \u2013 not having one at all might be problematic with our current architecture.\n. @WellingGuzman I think we need to pull the primary key from the schema (maybe it's id or maybe something else). But Directus needs a primary key, so if the table doesn't have one (or it's a compound key), when you go to the table you would see an alert telling you to set one.\nFor the \"primary field\" that is within tables now, we should either change the name to the \"Reference\" field or remove it altogether (auto-select the first varchar field?).\nDoes that make sense?\n. I say let's require a primary key for all tables. No need to make it more complex by allowing view/insert. \nTo SET the primary key, we should pull the key from the table schema. We can show it as a radio button in the table settings so admins can set it manually if they want. \nTables created within Directus should have an id column by default. \n.

It seems that this doesn't really apply to Directus since it's not Node/JS based. There are other more efficient ways to install Directus: CLI, clone the repo, upload the build version, etc\n. An excellent recommendation. I think that this array might be vestigial, since now Directus takes the opposite approach \u2013 only pulling in whitelisted tables. We ran into issues with some installations where temporary tables were created by services that weren't meant to be managed at all. Now you have to add managed tables into directus_tables to pull them into the system.\nWe will go through and reassess this whitelist/blacklist process to make sure it all makes sense and removes redundancy.

A very good point \u2013 this has been added into the readme. @WellingGuzman can we add the GPLv3 files into the repo?\n. Very true \u2013 that's probably the best way to include it... does it \"need\" to go in the root?\n. Perfect \u2013 done! Thanks @Calinou \n. This can be a simple version to start, then we can add in features as time goes on. The question is, what language would this be written in? PHP?\n. That's exactly what I mean. ;)\n. Should we remove it from here then? Maybe open a ticket specifically for the SDK?\n. We can move it to the SDK repo, but I'm worried it will be overlooked there. If we need to update Directus Core for this then we should leave it here until that's done. Thoughts?\n. Any thoughts on this? If we did an API sprint for a week is this something we could incorporate?\n. Not pursuing this... . Ahh, a very good point! I'll adjust the docs/marketing site now. Thanks for the heads up!\n. Added to readme, marketing site, and wiki pages\n. Ahh, great to hear you found the problem @Pawnerd \u2013 can you think of a way to warn users of this through the docs or framework directly? I wonder if the code can identify when this happens and help the user understand/resolve things so they don't have to search for a solution.\n. I like it \u2013 I'll open a new ticket to add that alert in! And thanks for the Wiki update...\n. This is great, and will certainly help clarify things. Thanks @mickrip !\n. Works great for install... eventually we should make this work for post-install since admins may copy files/db from server to server and bypass the install process.\n. Duplicate.\n. @WellingGuzman should we add alter to the Settings>Permissions page? Or is this more an issue of default values?\n. @ConnorGBrewster @WellingGuzman \nI agree with that \u2013 but also wonder about which groups should have this permission. Admin groups are the only ones who should be able to alter tables... I know previously we had that permission baked-into that group, but now we're thinking an \"admin\" boolean on each of the directus_groups might be better.\nThe question is, can anyone think of a reason why a non-admin group would need an alter command?\n. Yes, closed. I remembered that one but couldn't find it \u2013 this one should include Facebook, and/or other common methods.\n. Good call ;)\n. @WellingGuzman \u2013 How hard is it to include the option to authenticate your email address with Google/Facebook/Github? I'm curious how long it would take to code this since these libraries are so common.\n. OK, well then a total rewrite will be hard, but good. \n.

Thanks @mickrip \u2013 this is a great update.\n. I didn't even know that, I wonder if only I wasn't seeing it since the fonts are on my local machine. Thanks!\n. Destructive table/field level deletes was something we didn't include in the API from the onset due to concerns about massive and irreversible data loss. If we're pushing Directus more as an DB Admin tool then we may need to reconsider this however. @WellingGuzman thoughts?\n. I like the option of a file backup of the table before hard-delete, as well as a two-step confirmation. We could add a database backup path to store table-delete dumps and any other database backups we offer. I'd say we auto-save any table dumps before delete... keep it safe!\n. @ConnorGBrewster @WellingGuzman @mickrip \nMy thinking is that Directus is first-and-foremost a tool for managing database content. I personally have never used it to administer a database, and feel like it hasn't been designed with this in mind. What I would recommend is building out a Core Directus Extension (maybe that even ships within the repo) with a more comprehensive set of DBA tools (including delete). \nThis would give us a clean space to design/develop a proper set of DBA features without commingling them into the \"content management system\" codebase. Devs can then choose to use SequelPro, the Directus Extension, or anything else... but at least it's all decoupled and remains their choice. This direction is also nice since we can support several different DBA Extensions, and then formally adopt the one people feel is most successful.\nDoes that sound like an agreeable path forward? \n. @ConnorGBrewster I do agree with that mentality. If we go the route of a official extension for DBA tools then those features might also shift out of core and into the extension. Although there is a relationship between creating UIs/relationships and creating fields/columns... it will require some thinking but I think we can figure it out.\n. As an update, Directus now allows for the the deleting of tables/fields as follows:\nUser must be logged in as an admin, navigate to the Settings > Tables page, Click the delete button beside the table/field, click a confirm modal (Are you sure? This table, its columns, and all of its content will be permanently removed from the system!), and then type the exact name of the table/field into another confirmation modal (This cannot be undone. To confirm, please type the name of the table to delete: XXXXX).\nWe believe this to be both safe and utilitarian. While our goal is not to become a database administration tool, we do want to make certain schema adjustments possible within the framework. \nStriking this balance will take time, and all input is welcome!\n.

This is excellent @mickrip \u2013 we have some ideas around crowd-sourcing the cleanup and generation of these UIs, but it's very helpful to get these polished up a bit. Thanks!\n. @WellingGuzman Do you need more info to help debug this?\n. @WellingGuzman Is this fetching the relational data on the listing page now?\n. Had to roll-back for stability. A new fix is forthcoming...\n. This data is now shown correctly on the listing page for M2O and M2O-Typeahead\n. This is great, thanks @jwdeitch \n.

Hey @beevelop \u2013 we're wrapping up some new and exciting features for Directus (more info to come) so we're all a bit swamped right now. @WellingGuzman and I will try to get this resolved when we can, but that may be a week or two.\nApologies about the delay... let us know if you have any luck getting this working (pull-request) and we'll review and merge.\nThanks!\n. @mkly \u2013 That's the one! We'd love any support or contributions to the Directus Docker repo \u2013 looks like you have some experience in the matter ;)\n. This will happen, but it's not an issue \u2013 moving this to the roadmap instead (will be published on the repo's wiki soon). For those looking to upvote the new feature (Postgres support):\nhttp://feathub.com/directus/directus/+99\nOr, let us know if someone wants to help add this to the codebase! We sure do love PRs! \ud83d\ude04 . @WellingGuzman is this a big change? (would it take a while to implement?)\n. Cool, good to see it with the ready tag!\n. This is working perfectly \u2013 but we'll need to go through all the UIs at some point to see if anything else needs to be required/validated. Thanks @WellingGuzman \n. Ahh, that is a big issue. Here's what it should be doing:\n1. Password reset request\n2. Saves reset_token and reset_expiration in directus_users\n3. Email goes to user to confirm with URL to reset\n4. If the user clicks that link (with the token) before the reset_expiration time then the framework resets the salt/password\nThis is how it was working previously, @WellingGuzman could you look into what is going wrong? Also, the server error seems to be another problem altogether.\n. @WellingGuzman \nThis is marked as resolved \u2013 is it working? I just tested locally and I never got an email. Do I need to set something specific up?\n. Hopefully now that admins can set up email through mandrill or php this should be less of an issue. But yes, a command to change the password on the server would be good to add! We can close this once that script is available. \n. Even better \u2013 how difficult is this to implement?\n@mrwho \u2013 any experience with CLI?\n. @Wedjaa \nJust out of curiosity (since I haven't used it yet) \u2013 does/will the CLI install ask for setup options (individua prompts) like the GUI install page? (eg: host, port, example content)\n. Excellent! I'll try it out in a few days when I spin up a new client server. This is super exciting, I like how extensible this is becoming...\n. The thumbnail generated is one optimized (dimensions/quality/filesize) for the CMS itself. I assume you are looking for thumbnails to be used by your application? In version 5 there was an auto thumb generator for application use, but it was removed. We've used external scripts that check for a thumbs existence and if present it's returned... if not, it's generated (based on parameters) and returned.\nI'll add a ticket (https://github.com/RNGR/Directus/issues/1028) to address this, thanks for the reminder!\n. Makes sense \u2013 we'll try to expedite that feature (https://github.com/RNGR/Directus/issues/1028), but are in the middle of some big schema tickets that came up during our last marketing push. In the meantime I would recommend looking into an external (on-the-fly) thumb generator. We appreciate your feedback, if I can dig up the script we use (outside of Directus) I'll send it over...\n.

Migrated to FeatHub\nPlease use the Directus FeatHub to vote for features or make new request. Accepted feature requests will be added to GitHub Issues.\n. @WellingGuzman Yeah, I mentioned exactly this... not sure if there's a ticket though. Basically defaults need to be gone through to ensure they are the UI default, not only the settings default... since settings aren't entered in the database until you save the first time.\n. OK, thanks!\n. @WellingGuzman \nDoes it save the defaults into directus_ui or does it just fallback within the UI code? I just created a new TEXT column in the database, then saved it as a WYSIWYG in directus... and it didn't save any options within directus_ui.\n. @WellingGuzman any thoughts on this?\n. Hey @DionTimmermann \u2013 we're checking this out and will report back with a fix shortly. Thanks for bringing this to our attention!\n. I haven't been able to reproduce this one, but my guess is that the Bookmark name was rejected. I think I remember an issue where bookmarks names couldn't start with numbers, or have special characters. Although I just tested this and had no errors. I'll close this as \"can not reproduce\" \u2013 anyone can re-open if it occurs again.\n. I was just informed that this was most likely due to the Primary Key work being performed at the time of this error. We have since wrapped up this refactor and the issue should be resolved. Let us know if it persists.\n. @WellingGuzman \u2013 Let's keep the top (green) button in the header. We can remove the lower one. Then we can come up with a better admin system for when we need two primary buttons (edit fields page).\n. This has been resolved \u2013 it was due to an issue with the implementation of custom primary key. Please let us know if you continue to have problem with this.\n. @WellingGuzman shouldn't any tables added into Directus get alter by default?\n. If it was an issue with the build branch but working on master, then this should be good to go now. I'll close it and we can reopen if someone is experiencing this problem still. \n. Thanks for finding this @WellingGuzman ! I'll fix this asap...\n. Not quite asap ;)\n. @WellingGuzman Didn't you already do this during our sprints a few weeks ago?\n. Why leave the time separate from datetime? Or just for now?\n. @WellingGuzman Removed Testing since we need to figure out the time UI integration...\n. Other than UI option defaults not showing up when created, this is all set!\n. @WellingGuzman \nYeah, this sounds great. I've had 1 or 2 people come to me with issues doing big upgrades because of schema changes... so this will definitely help!\n. Yeah, let's get the dev branch merged into master and get the build up to date. We can close this ticket and reopen if it happens again.\n. Good! But can we not show the ui_files and ui_users tables? They are junction tables and wouldn't be editable. We should clean up this demo table so it's really useful... \n. Perfect!\n. Looks good! I wonder if we should add first_name and last_name to the installation \u2013 or fill in a default. Those are required fields for users, and currently the default user is nameless. I'll open a ticket.\n. I'm getting:\nServer Error\narray_merge(): Argument #1 is not an array\nGET http://local.directus.com:8888/api/1/tables/test_table 500 (Internal Server Error)\nwhen I try to add a table now. Is there a schema change I need to apply?\n. I tried on a fresh install and it worked!\n. @WellingGuzman Also, is there a reason we can't find any tables in the DB (not added to Directus) and show them in the Settings/Tables list... even if we gray them out and put a \"Add\" button next to them? That would be easier for importing tables that you already have in the database. Thoughts?\n. I think that's perfect \u2013 but they should be listed in gray (with an \"Add\" button) only on the Settings>Tables page... not in the actual user interface. Clicking the add button would insert the privileges needed to manage the tables.\nI like it!\n. I think that's a great idea... keep them separate so it's less confusing!\n. @WellingGuzman what do you think time-wise for this?\n. @WellingGuzman \nWhoops! Here's another screenshot. I can test on other relational columns, but it's definitely happening on Single File. If you change a UI type to be relational... it needs to create the right directus_column data for the relationship.\n\n. It works!\nAlthough it's odd \u2013 it's saving \"ui\" in the directus_columns.junction_key_right field... I think it is supposed to save the column name. @WellingGuzman thoughts?\n. Working!\n. Looks good!\n. This might be related, but selecting an image within an overlay also throws an error:\n\n. To clarify, this is when you drag and drop an image to the Files PAGE not the UI...\nIt seems to still be looking for the temp folder... I'm moving this down to major since you can upload other ways. But let's try to get it fixed soon.\n. This was due to a number at the beginning of a field name (3d_image). Close as a duplicate of this new ticket: https://github.com/RNGR/Directus/issues/1078\n. Good question @WellingGuzman \nBut first off, let's verify we still need this. Where is primary_column used? I remember it was mostly in activity and messages. Is there anywhere else? Also, sometimes you need to represent the row with more than one column (first_name last_name) \u2013 so maybe there's a better way to choose columns.\nOther than that, I think that, since it's within directus_tables I don't think it needs to say \"table\". So if we keep this column I think it should be called: item_representation or item_title or item_display\nThoughts?\n. Working!\nFor primary_column \u2013 it looks like you've removed this from the interface (good!) where is this value referenced in the system?\n. If you turn on reordering and drag the first item it works. Any items you drag after that throw an error. If you toggle the reorder off then on, it works the first time again.\n. This works wonderfully now... can't find any issues! Thanks @WellingGuzman \n. Looks good!\n. Thanks for finding this @richjenks \n@WellingGuzman \u2013 all the more reason to get the build branch up to date today!\n. Awesome \u2013 @richjenks  let us know if you run into anything else! We're busy working through a pretty big platform release... but don't want Directus updates to fall by the wayside.\n. Hey @richjenks \u2013 this is a perfectly good way to submit issues like this... and is much appreciated!\n1. By design, there is no way to rename or delete a table (or field) from within Directus. We (currently) see this as a risky feature to have since you could easily lose a lot of data or break connections to existing applications. We're looking into building a stand-alone extension for these DB admin tools \u2013 or adding enough safety measures so that they can be incorporated into the Settings area.\n2. We 100% agree \u2013 there's a ticket open to clear up this confusion. I've moved this to 'major` so that it is resolved more expeditiously. I'll also open up a stand-alone ticket for clarifying the relational options/parameters.\nThanks!!\n. All set.\n. Looks good!\n. I agree, all files should be ordered by date_uploaded... so if something is in the process of uploading, it should be first.\n. @WellingGuzman \nThe user types in their password and then on focus Directus salts/hashes (encrypts) it before saving. The whole thing is blocked (\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022), but I think that's OK.\nDo you think the password and hash should be plaintext?\n. @WellingGuzman \nThe \"loading data\" is really fast (for me) so it doesn't bother me. And the reveal password shows that we don't have access to their original/plaintext password. We could add UI options to disable the \"reveal\" button \u2013 or an option to not encrypt passwords (store them in plaintext).\n. I see what you mean. If you haven't saved then it makes sense to reveal the password you typed. Let's add a quick UI option for disabling/hiding the reveal button (default = no reveal button).\n. Did you hide it or make a UI option to hide it? Either way... this is good.\n. @WellingGuzman \nBy default we have the media path in the root of Directus? Oh, I thought it was one directory \"above\" Directus.\nCan we add a quick comment in the code explaining this? Also, if you add a quick note in the Docs I will clean it up.\n. Looks good! I cleaned up the comments\n. Good formatting!\n. Looks good! Thanks Welling!!\n. This is working for me too now \u2013 @WellingGuzman is this one that you fixed the other day?\n. @jel-massih Thanks again, you're keeping us under 100 issues! ;)\n. Any ideas on this one? It seems like it would be pretty straightforward to add in these fields again... but let me know @WellingGuzman \n. This is looking great \u2013 especially the disabled relational options for Single File and O2M. I know it's manually edited still... we can open a ticket for making this dynamic or any adjustments. Thanks @WellingGuzman \n. Migrated to FeatHub\nPlease use the Directus FeatHub to vote for features or make new request. Accepted feature requests will be added to GitHub Issues.\n. Actually, because the statuses can be adjusted by the admin, it would be difficult to know how to handle this.\nI think what we should do it make a enforce_validation flag for each status. That way, you can set whether each status should enforce validation.\n- active: enforce_validation = true\n- draft: enforce_validation = false\n- delete: enforce_validation = false\nWhat do you think @WellingGuzman ?\n. This would also solve the following Feature Request:\nhttp://feathub.com/directus/directus/+15\n. In terms of UI:\n- User clicks on delete for an item\n- It would show a Directus notification confirmation (Are you sure you would like to permanently delete this item? Yes, Cancel\n- The item is deleted and the user is returned to the listing page.\n. Hey @alketii \u2013 the next full/major release (v7) is probably a ways off... we're moving to smaller, more  incremental updates now. 6.1 will be mostly bug fixes and optimizations \u2013 then we have a whole backlog of other features that will be added in. Is there a specific feature you're looking for or a reason for asking?\nThings have been progressing a bit slower the past three months due to something new/big we're working on for Directus. More to come!\n. Thanks @jel-massih !!! I just pulled and added an API key but am getting a Server Error (Vimeo upload is working). Any ideas?:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxpDa-c-4Mc\n\n. Haha, Hotline Bling is (unfortunately) stuck in my head...\nHmm, maybe it's my local setup or API key? Let me try testing again\n. Welp \u2013 it helps if you enable the YouTube API v3 for that key!\nLooks good and works great!! The only thing (which I found out the hard way) is that if you have a bad API key it just says \"Server error\". Is it possible to give a \"Error: Bad YouTube API Key\"?\n. Yes, just tested now and this is working perfectly. The only questions I have (I can open in a new ticket if the answers here warrant it) are about a few unused fields:\n- url versus embed_id columns. It seems that embed_id is not being used.\n- user doesn't seem to be getting filled in (mine says \"0\" for all)\n- charset isn't being filled in for embeds, is that correct?\n- what does needs_index do?\n. @jel-massih This is awesome!! Thank you so much for the contribution!\n. Hey @richjenks \u2013 is this happening on a specific page?\n. Maybe this is only in the build branch? I am not seeing this on any of the mentioned pages...\n. OK \u2013 assuming this is a fix for the issue. I have added this into the FAQ section of the NEW docs.\n. This one seems odd \u2013 the \"Save and Stay\" dropdown should be a system input... so we don't actually style it. Could you sent a screenshot and browser/OS details?\nThanks!\n. Migrated to FeatHub\nPlease use the Directus FeatHub to vote for features or make new request. Accepted feature requests will be added to GitHub Issues.\n. First, I'm wondering why we're not using the actual \"relationships\" in MySQL to store these relationships?\ndirectus_tables.is_junction_table\nLet's remove directus_tables.is_junction_table and all references to it in the framework. The only place it was used (I think) was when setting up a new relationship... it only showed junction tables. Now we can show all tables in this dropdown.\ndirectus_tables.table_name and directus_tables.field_name\nShould we change these to table and field? Not sure if this is worth it, but it might be nice to simplify before there are lots of people using Directus. \ndirectus_columns.master and directus_columns.system\nWhere are these used? Could we find ways to simplify this... maybe remove them?\ndirectus_columns.data_type\nFor directus_columns.data_type, are we using this anywhere? It seems that most values are empty or in duplicate. We should change this field to be a boolean: alias with values of 0 or 1\ndirectus_columns.relationship_type\nIn directus_columns.relationship_type for consistency can we adjust MANYTOONE to be many_to_one? Also, should this be an enum so it only has three options:\n- many_to_one\n- one_to_many\n- many_to_many\ndirectus_columns.comment\nWould it be possible to remove this and have comments saved directly in the database field comment?\nField Order\nLet's move system, master, hidden_input, hidden_list, and required right before sort in the default schema field order\nMany-to-Many\nSome thoughts around new naming for these fields:\n- related_table (changed)\n- junction_table\n- this_table_foreign_key (changed)\n- related_table_foreign_key (changed)\nThoughts @WellingGuzman ?\n. > Why we're not using the actual \"relationships\" in MySQL to store these relationships?\n\nLet's plan on adding this into future version.\n\nOK, I'll add a ticket!\n\nYou meant directus_columns right? \ud83d\udc30 , I believe this was used as MySQL uses the same names, I like it that way, but we can discuss how confusing can it be. This will rise another question, are we naming it \"Fields\" or \"Columns\"? sometimes the names are interchangeable.\n\nOK, if that's what MySQL calls them then let's leave it as is. We do need to agree on fields/columns though. Is there a preference?\n\nWe can remove it, the use of master it was to indicate the main column/field of a table, the value that represents the table. System is a way to tell when a column/field name was a system field, such as id, sort and status (I think those are all).\n\nCool \u2013 let's remove master (and any references), and let's remove system and just have a conditional for id, sort, and status.\n\nIt's not sure the uses but it's mainly used for relational field, I think it will be best to store the column real data type, ex: INT, VARCHAR or ALIAS.\n\nIs there a need to store the datatype? Don't we have that from the schema (no need for duplicate data). I like the idea of the ALIAS boolean. Datatype from the schema, relationship from relationship_type... \ud83d\ude4f\n\nI like all in uppercase altogether. wanna fight for it? \u270c\ufe0f But I do love that it should be an enum.\n\nHaha, \ud83d\udc4a ...  if you want to leave these as caps that's fine (though I still think they should be lowercase like everything else). But let's make that an enum for sure.\n\nWhat about SQLite? no love? As far as I know SQLite do not support field comment, or does it, can someone confirm?.\n\nGood point! Let's keep this and manage comments in the system. But we should sync with the DB types that allow it.\n\nrelated_table (changed) \u2013 Agreed, it was giving anxiety.\n\nLet's change it! We can leave the other left/right column names.\n. OK, much better. Most of these changes were made \u2013 some were not because they weren't as obviously beneficial. We need to continue to add optimizations here, including Docs and column notes in the GUI... but that will happen over time.\n.

Reminder to format \"friendly\" error responses...\n. @WellingGuzman \u2013 Did we just fix this for Hosted?\n. Great!\n.

Also, it's unclear if we would add an icon for all first level nav items (Files, Users... and also each table).\n\nAre we using the directus_bookmarks.active field? If not, can we remove it?\n\nNot in used (Or it has always seems like it, never found anything related to this field), let's removed.\n\n\nGreat!! Maybe one last search though ;)\n\nAre we using the directus_bookmarks.section field? If not, can we remove it?\n\nThis is the category on where the bookmark, is going to be displayed under, other are system item such as Users and files, search are bookmarks and tables, are well, tables, although, we are going to remove \"Activity, Files, Messages and Users\" from here. I think we can remove this as all this entries are going to be bookmarks.\n\n\nYeah, the table says \"directus_bookmarks\"... I think it'd be good to remove the system ones and have it only be for bookmarks.\n\nShould we add a directus_bookmarks.preference_id field? It seems like it's currently matching the bookmark preference based on the directus_preferences.title field... does that seem correct?\n\nOkay this one can be done this way, it seems more easy to handle, but at the end with will need the title to check if wether or not an entry with this name exists so it wont be duplicated. (or it can be with the magic of icon next to it who knows). NOTE make title field field unique.\n\n\nIf the title is unique doesn't that mean that if I add a bookmark that's the same name as one you added... it would fail/override? Bookmarks are per user (but we should have an option to make them per group/global) so they should only be unique to that user... not the whole table.\n. Another option for Bookmarks being assigned to individual users:\nEach record is either assigned to a specific user (store id) or is global (NULL) for the user column.\nWould this be easier than trying to do all three of these?\n- User Bookmarks\n- Group Bookmarks\n- Global Bookmarks\n. Darkened!\n. All set!\n. Yeah, this was part of the fix, thanks for checking though!\n\n. That works for me. As long as normal users don't see that field (only admins). I thought it would be nice to use the Directus feature to hide it... but I understand that might not work for this. Thanks!\n. Yes, we would remove the field if they request all (*) fields. Perfect!\n. The interfaces for these have been added to Settings > Tables & Inputs and Settings > Tables & Inputs > Table. Let's have them delete on click after 2-3 directus style confirmations.\n. Looks good! Two comments:\nCan we throw an alert if the user types the wrong column/table name when trying to delete? Right now it just closes and says nothing.\nAnd can we add the column/table name at the top of the second alert so they can see what to type? The overlay blocks the name below...\n. This cannot be undone. To confirm, please type the name of the table (\"table_name\") to delete.\n. Actually:\nThis cannot be undone. To confirm, please type the name of the table to delete: (table_name)\n. This looks great!\n. All files are public now, right @WellingGuzman? What would we need to do to allow for making some files private (only accessible through Directus or authenticated API)?\n. Gotcha.

Accepted feature requests will be added to GitHub Issues.\n. https://webtranslateit.com/en/docs/file_formats/json\n. @christophemarois working on this update over the next few days. Should have it up soon!\n. I agree, I think we add some simple input limits/formatting when adding columns/tables (only lower-case, spaces turn to underscores, no special chars). We can also add placeholder text to the inputs with: eg: related_work. If admins want to use a different naming convention that's not the Directus style, then they can do that directly in the database. That way all tables/columns made within directus are all \"properly\" formatted.\nThe other thing we could do it not prettify some of the tables/columns within the Settings area. This might help reinforce the naming conventions.\n. Hey @javiercf \u2013 this is looking great! Here are a few (very small) things I noticed:\n- Buttons go beside editor for wider viewports\n\n- After saving, several nbsps (spaces) showup at the beginning of the text (looks like it's the escaped markup)\n\n{{rawValue}} \\\n- We're trying to give all UI options default values, for example:\n{id: 'rows', ui: 'numeric', char_length: 3, def: '12'}\nYou already had the fallback in the code, but it's good to show it in the options too\nrows: (this.options.settings && this.options.settings.has('rows')) ? this.options.settings.get('rows') : '12',\n- Styling should match the other UIs (which you've partially done here with the buttons) \u2013 ideally we should use the same button styling as the WYSIWYG UI\n- It would be good to have some basic options for formatting (bold, italic) similar to GitHub's editor\n. Sorry, was merged into the wrong branch \u2013 all pull-requests should go into the development branch\n. This would be a great addition to the docs. Nice thinking!\n. Looking into this a bit further...\n. Great! Thanks for reporting the issue @anotherwebstorm \nGood job @WellingGuzman!!\n. Yes, there are multiple ways to adjust the left nav bar, but it to get total control you can use this:\nhttps://github.com/directus/docs/blob/master/04-developer/03-configuration.md#customizing-the-sidebar-navigation-for-user-groups\nYou can also add them individually for users (working on a global option for this):\nTable: directus_bookmarks\nThis table stores all of the left-nav bookmarks for Directus. This includes bookmarks that users create as well as the \"System\" bookmarks at the bottom. Each record is assigned to a specific user.\n- user - [Directus user id] This assigns the bookmark to a specific user (there's a ticket to allow for \"global\" bookmarks using NULL)\n- title - The text to display in the navigation menu\n- url - The path to navigate to when clicked, relative to the Directus root\n- icon_class - Deprecated\n- section - [\"search\" or \"other\"] Which nav section to show the link within. User generated bookmarks use \"search\", while all system links go within \"other\"\n. Reading through your comment again, I see you're asking about adding it to the nav on the Item Listing page. I don't know if there's an easy way to do this, but one way to look into would be creating a custom Item Listing view template (using the default as a boilerplate):\nhttps://github.com/directus/docs/blob/master/04-developer/07-folder-and-file-guide.md#listviews\nThis is overkill, but should get the job done. Otherwise you'd have to fork and tweak the Directus Core code itself \u2013 take a look here to see that code:\n/app/core/widgets/ (eg: FilterWidget.js)\n.

When you install, do you get the copy config text text area?\n. Yeah, I NEVER get the config text in that text area. Are you using build? I am using the default branch (developer?)\n. Is this the new error message?\n\n- Can we capitalize \"Error\"?\n- Can we use our filesize convert function to turn these bytes into something more relatable? (KB/MB/GB)\n- Are we providing a link or info on how to increase this? Even if it just says \"Talk to your administrator about increasing this limit\"\n. Also, is that the size of the file I'm uploading... or the max allowed? We need to clarify.\n. If we change the alert to this we can close it:\n**Error**\nThis file exceeds the server's max file size of: 6.7MB\n. Perfect. I made an adjustment to the text so it fits on one line...\n. @WellingGuzman you said you fixed this one?\n. This is a good database change \u2013  but the interface isn't super clear still. When saving an email address with a duplicate value you get:\nServer Error\nStatement could not be executed (23000 - 1062 - Duplicate entry 'ben@rngr.org' for key 'directus_users_email_unique')\nCan we add a custom error message for these errors? Token has the same message.\n*Notice*\nThe \"email\" field must be unique \u2013 \"ben@rngr.org\" already exists within this table.\n. This is working great \u2013 and works for token too... \nWe'll need to come back and replace the key_name with the column_name eventually...\n. It's happening locally, and also on Hosted Instances\n\n. Can confirm \u2013 this is fixed on master\nThanks @WellingGuzman \n. I'm curious what the best way to implement this would be. Would/could/should this code exist within the file UI, or should we add it into the core so all UIs can use it? Also, we should agree on a good way to handle dependencies \u2013 some UIs will require other libraries and we want to make it easy to include those as needed. \n. Did we finish the new inputs for checking/validating new field/table names?\nIf someone adds a table with a space directly in the database, does that work yet?\n. @WellingGuzman this seems similar to the issue you just resolved \u2013 could it be the same problem? That was caused by empty strings in the directus_tables.primary column instead of NULL, right?\n. @MethodGrab This is great! Thank you for the contribution!!\n. This sounds good. But is this for Directus Core data only? Should the date/time UI allow different formats for user content?\nWould the user pick a timezone for all of Directus \u2013 or per user? If the CMS has users in different timezones, would that still work properly?\n. OK, great!\nMaybe we can request the user's location (in browser) to get/save their timezone for accurate date saving.\n. We don't need it to use the browser check... just a dropdown on each user detail page instead of the config: https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/1206\nIs this one good to close?\n. Good catch @laszlokorte \u2013 looks like a lot of little issues have made it through the cracks while we worked through the Hosted platform. Thanks for all these comments/tickets!\n. It's a bummer to rely on extensions, but maybe that's our best fallback. \nI do agree that it might be best to copy the full SVG file as the thumb (instead of trying to generate a bitmap version). @WellingGuzman is that something we can do under this ticket?\nThanks @laszlokorte \u2013 really appreciate all these tickets!\n. Within Directus, we probably want to maintain all thumbnails as bitmap (JPG). Let's try to create a JPG of the SVG in the thumbs folder. If we can't do that, we can make a copy of the SVG in the thumbs directory.\n@WellingGuzman is there a supported way to get a JPG thumb of the SVG with our required libraries?\n. That works. Not sure if it's better to generate a bitmap thumbnail (when possible) or copy an SVG thumbnail (as a fallback perhaps?)... but either way works for me as long as it represents the uploaded image.\n. @WellingGuzman \u2013 I know we were trying to find the best way to handle thumbnails... but is the error when uploading SVGs resolved?\n. Perfect. Let's leave this open to fix the error... the thumbnail is now in FeatHub:\nMigrated to FeatHub (Thumbnail Creation Only)\nPlease use the Directus FeatHub to vote for features or make new request. Accepted feature requests will be added to GitHub Issues.\n. It looks like there is different code for uploading by:\n- Drag and drop onto Files page\n- Click \"New File\" on Files page\nSame file uploaded both ways, HTML = Drag and Drop:\n\nAlso, does it need to say SVG+XML? Is that important (in terms of meta data) or can it just say SVG?\n. OK, this is working great now!\n. @laszlokorte \u2013 very true! I removed that vendor-specific property so that the autocomplete text is lighter than the actual input text. I also added \"eg:\" to the two inputs with placeholder text to avoid mistaking them for actual values.\nThis is on the development branch, which will be merged into master in a few weeks (big update).\nThanks for opening this ticket!!\n. Thanks @laszlokorte \u2013 yeah, in the future we'll have these major updates on feature branches instead of development. Right now we have about 8 sprints getting wrapped up on dev and are waiting to merge them with master (in a few weeks). \nDead code removal, performance/optimizations, UI/UX, SDK/API, example code, docs, vestigial schema names/columns, etc... are what we're focusing on now. We want to get everything cleaned up and working perfectly before introducing too many new features \u2013 through we do have some great new ones coming out such as multi-lingual support and more SQL DB type support.\nDefinitely submit any issues you see (master or dev) \u2013 and our Docs are in a repo too so feel free to submit PRs for that if you have time/interest. As you can imagine, this is a lot of work for such a small team \u2013 so any help from you or other devs is greatly appreciated.\nI've sent you an invite to our Slack team in case you want to chat about anything more easily. We're working to make more things public (voting on feature requests, upcoming versions/sprints, roadmap, etc)... but until we have a good process for all that on GitHub Slack is good for getting more info.\n. Thanks @christophemarois \u2013 this is super useful! We've actually been talking quite a bit about standardizing table/column names, what's best, and what should be supported. For instance, should spaces be allowed in table/column names (as of now we've decided that creating them within Directus would remove spaces... but that Core would support them when created within the database directly. The same questions arise when looking at case (upper/lower).\nWe'd love your (or anyone else's) opinion on what is best for the framework \u2013 so keep the tickets/comments coming. Also, I've sent you an invite to our Slack team in case you'd like to chat about any of this over there.\nReally appreciate the feedback!\n. Also, I've updated the docs with notes reminding users of the API that the table/column names are case sensitive. Very important to have in there until we figure out about downcasing, etc.\n. Good catch! Field creation (especially relational) is something we're trying to refine and polish. This testing is invaluable \u2013 and I think @WellingGuzman is about to push a hotfix for this one.\nThanks again, @laszlokorte !\n. Hey @laszlokorte \u2013 I remember this came up a while ago (a few years). I forget what the reasoning was for this logic but agree with your recommendation. \n@WellingGuzman do you see any reason why we can't allow unchecking the \"required\" option (currently disabled) for TINYINT() that do not ALLOW NULL? Having a required checkbox seems a bit weird \u2013 and it definitely shouldn't be required...\n. @laszlokorte Did you hover over the options in that UI? The \"X\" appears at the far-right on hover of the item row. If you're not seeing it this is definitely a bug.\nIf you ARE seeing it then we might need to look at the UI to make sure it's intuitive enough how to delete.\nLet us know!\n. Hey @laszlokorte \u2013 so I've added a O2M through Directus (dev branch) and it seems to be working for me. With multiple/many fields it does get pushed far to the right (off screen for smaller viewports) \u2013 but I can see it when I expand the browser... so it should still be in dev tools.\nMaybe give it a try on the dev branch (master should also work since we just merged). Maybe this was resolved with our big push last week.\n\n\n\n. > I just noticed that I am not seeing a delete button in global list views of the tables either.\nDo you mean for the Item listing page? This page doesn't have a delete button, it uses the status feature (clicking on the left check boxes for items). Also, this feature works when a status field is included (default: active) or you have permission for a hard delete on that table.\nLet me know if this helps!\n. Hey @laszlokorte \u2013 we're consistently seeing the remove button over here... let us know if you have time to test again on your side. If the problem persists we'll re-open this, but for now it seems to not be an issue.\nBased on the UI design in the screenshots you might have had an outdated version... but it's hard to say if that was the cause.\n. Interesting \u2013 there may have been a time before the status column when soft-delete was accomplished by unassigning the id so that the item was available as a choice with other OTM fields. \nEither way, we need to decide how to handle this by default and what UI options we'll support.\n- Delete Item (hard delete) \u2013 Gone... forever\n- NULL ID (soft delete) \u2013 Goes back into the pool of choices\n- Use status column (soft delete) \u2013 Is still related to that item, but is inactive (not in pool)\nFor now, it seems that we want to clarify (docs and code) the allow null issue with this UI. Then we could base it on the schema/permissions:\n- Permission = Hard: Delete Item\n- Permission = Soft & No Status: NULL ID\n- Permission = Soft & Status: Inactive\nWhat do you think @laszlokorte and @WellingGuzman ?\n. Ahh, then that is a mistake. All of the relational UIs should have a way to choose from the existing items. This specific UI should also have an option to choose from: null only, or any items (would reassign). \nAre you familiar with the UI options enough to try adding that \"Choose\" option (and have time/interest \ud83d\ude09), or should I add this to FeatHub?\n. Not a problem! Added to FeattHub\n. This makes sense... but the second option never needs to happen. No one chooses \"soft delete\"... it is soft-delete if there is no status column. So the second option above would never happen.\nOther than that... this looks good!\n. @WellingGuzman after testing this, if the FK ALLOWS NULL and you have a status column, it should only adjust it to NULL (it should NOT also change the status). Or we need to at least set a UI option for this.\nRight now, I am testing careers being assigned to offices... and when you remove the relationship it deletes the item from Directus (active = 0) and you can't reassign it or see it at all.\nChanging the first one...\n```\nHAS STATUS COLUMN AND ALLOW NULL\n  status = DO NOT CHANGE, column = NULL\nHAS STATUS COLUMN AND NOT ALLOW NULL\n  status = 0, column = ID\nNO STATUS COLUMN AND ALLOW NULL\n  remove status, column = NULL\nNO STATUS COLUMN AND NOT ALLOW NULL\n  DELETE ROW\n```\n. This is working great now! Thanks W\n. Hmm, yeah. The relational UIs are easily the most complex part of Directus Core \u2013 and can be very tricky to troubleshoot/fix. Intermittent issues like this are the worst \u2013 but we'll also test on our side to try and find a process for reproducing.\nAnyone else experiencing this issue should comment any additional insight here.\nThank you for the heads up @laszlokorte!\n. @WellingGuzman do you think the commit you referenced above may have fixed this issue? Unable to duplicate, but it would be nice to know what might have been happening.\nI agree that it seems like a difference between how directus_columns records are created. Any thoughts on this before I close?\n. I have been testing this one for a week or so, and have not seen either of these two issues happen. I'm going to close it and we can reopen if someone encounters it again or has steps to reproduce.\n. Thank you @laszlokorte!! PRs are like gold around here... really awesome to get these contributions.\n. Just to add to this \u2013 there is a O2M and a different M2O UI... so it's good to clarify which we're talking about.\n. Hey @WellingGuzman \u2013 did you try to replicate with the one-to-many UI (not the many-to-one)?\n. Both of these issues (create>save>click & create>save) are working for me... closing this unless someone else is still seeing an issue. Good work @WellingGuzman!\n. @WellingGuzman It seems that we're loading the child (fresh from db) instead of loading the edited one (cached in app, not db). Again, for the O2M, not the M2O...\n. Awesome schema @laszlokorte \u2013 always cool to see how people structure things within Directus.\nThe nested relational data always get's a bit tricky... @WellingGuzman if it get's too crazy then maybe @jel-massih can help out since he did a lot of Directus relational work.\n. @WellingGuzman Added steps to reproduce on the development server to Asana. Removed testing until this is fixed.\n. Looks great \u2013 works great! Thanks @WellingGuzman \n. Looks good!\n. @laszlokorte Exactly. We actually had this in Directus 5 for relational UIs but they didn't get migrated in. The M2M fields could be displayed as a re-orderable list (how it is now), array of checkboxes, or multi-select list. Then, M2O had display options for dropdown or radio-buttons.\nI think we should add these as options in the existing M2M and M2O core UIs \u2013 and they template get adjusted. @WellingGuzman just created an example of UI as a directory (checkbox is not just a JS file) so maybe that will be easier for managing multiple templates and the extended logic.\nDoes that sound like what you're thinking?\n. @laszlokorte \u2013 we're still plowing through a huge pile of tickets, are you interested in trying your hand at coding this UI? Not sure how familiar you are with Backbone, but I see this as a display option within the existing M2M and/or O2M UIs.\nAny interest?\n. Migrated to FeatHub\nMigrated to FeatHub\nMigrated to FeatHub\nPlease use the Directus FeatHub to vote for features or make new request. Accepted feature requests will be added to GitHub Issues.\n. @laszlokorte any luck replicating?\n. Hey @WellingGuzman \u2013 I'll reopen this until we also have this fixed on M2O...\n. Hey @laszlokorte \u2013 here is what we're updated:\n- We updated the notes for each field to be more specific.\n- Small, Medium, Large adjusts the size of the input field and the dropdown width is auto.\n- TODO: Include Inactive is going to be visible_status_ids (same as M2O proper) ... @WellingGuzman  is working on making this a set of checkboxes instead of a text input to reduce mistakes.\n- The entire UI has been updated to resolve inconsistencies with styling\nLet us know if you see any other issues with this UI \u2013 thanks for reporting on this!\n. Also, this is on the development branch still, not merged into master or build yet\n. Yeah, we can improve that UI option later... At least it's the same option interface now. \n. This is all working now... thanks @WellingGuzman!\n. @WellingGuzman Do you think we should have the Permissions update with a \"Save\" button instead of asynchronously saving? Is that a lot of work? It is currently inconsistent, but I don't think this is a priority.\n@jel-massih did you work on the \"Saving for specific statuses\" (the dropdown at the top-right of the permissions page)? I want to make sure that's all working as expected.\n@laszlokorte \u2013 Saving group permissions for table items of a specific \"status\" doesn't make sense? The thinking here is to allow for workflows...\neg: Intern Group can edit Draft items, but can only view Live items\nOther notes:\n\nRemove the write access of a required field but keep the read access:\nwhen editing an existing record which has the field already set can not be saved because \"error: field is required\"\n\nThis is logical, but we should probably not force the requirement if you can't edit it.\n\nRemove both read and write access: Now the record can be saved without the user seeing the field at all\n\nThis makes sense.\n\nGive back read access but not write access: Now the field can even be edited even though the user should not have access to do so\n\nThis is not good and needs to be fixed asap. Perhaps the permission value is being NULL'd somehow? @WellingGuzman can we look at this?\n. @WellingGuzman \u2013 Did you turn off that message globally or only for this page?\n. @WellingGuzman I'm not getting this \"are you sure you want to leave\" message any more... can you confirm it's still in there?\n. 1. Read and no write = working now, no issues with required fields\n2. No read and no write = Still works as expected, but: You have to refresh the page after changing the permission when adjusting. I don't see this as an issue though since only admins can adjust permissions, and they wouldn't be adjusting for themselves. If they do, they don't even have access to the fields in Settings and need to reset in the DB. (I still think the admin group should ALWAYS see ALL fields/tables in the system, regardless of permissions).\n3. I am not getting this. The only way to see the change in permissions (that I can find) is for the user affected to refresh the page... which fetches everything correctly.\n@laszlokorte \u2013 if you have more insight into what you were experiencing we can re-open and discuss... but as of now this seems to be working correctly.\n. @paragonie-scott \u2013 Absolutely, we 100% agree. We've been chatting with a few folks adept in security (always looking for more!) and are moving into big security update/push over the next few weeks. Security audits/experts aren't cheap and being open-source we're always looking for community specialists who are interested in assessing/contributing to our framework. \nIf you have any interest in providing insight or pull-requests we'd love to chat with you further. Just sent you a Slack invite just in case ;)\nIn the meantime we'll look into adjusting the copy on our marketing site to better reflect the current state of our auth.\n. @jel-massih Have you used Bower? This might be a good (easier) ticket to refamiliarize with.\n. Migrated to FeatHub\nPlease use the Directus FeatHub to vote for features or make new request. Accepted feature requests will be added to GitHub Issues.\n. We couldn't change the media directory because it breaks Hosted? Or backwards compatibility? Or was it just too much work for now?\nIt'd be good to get that directory renamed/reorganized earlier \u2013 so I don't want to push it off too far if we don't have to.\n. Thanks @laszlokorte \u2013 been thinking about this one for years! Especially useful for things like lat/lon or address inputs. I'd love to figure this out, but here are a few things we'd need to consider before moving forward with this update:\n- UIs: Which UIs can support this? All of them? They could responsively adjust to less width \u2013 but some are more conducive to the smaller horizontal space. I wonder if it's easier to only support some (eg: text inputs)\n- Design: Currently the design guarantees that the fields are fairly standardized. It's difficult to miss inputs since they are all left aligned and delineated with a HR. What happens with very different heights between adjacent UIs? Weird gaps?\n- Labels: Each field currently has a dedicated/reserved label area \u2013 this is used for field comments and bulk-edit checkboxes. Fields labels would have to be shifted to be similar to Kirby, so we'd need to rethink some things.\n- Widths: Would 50% be the only option? Would 33.3% also work?\n- Responsiveness: since all the UIs require different ideal widths, at what point (if any) do we break the side-by-side fields to become stacked?\n.

Sorry for the late response \u2013 I agree that formal is probably better. It would be nice for Directus to be more approachable and casual, but I think clarity and professionalism is better for corporte end-clients.\nThanks you so much for your help @katywings \u2013 we're really excited to get more translations in the platform!\n. @katywings \u2013 Any luck with the translation? Let us know if you run into any problems so we can help resolve them. Thanks again!\n. Thank you @RabbitMC and @katywings \u2013 no rush, I was just curious how things were going. If there's anything I can do to help just let me know!\n. Hey @katywings \u2013 sorry for the late reply...\n- Activity: It is for all Activity (things that happen) within Directus. So not \"Activities\"\n- Visit Project: Directus is written to manage any type of database-driven project, not just sites. That's why we used that word. BUT, since that field only links to a URL, what you said does make more sense. Why don't we use \"Visit Project Website\"\n- Directus User Guide: Hmm, good point. But I think that since this is in the Core App and therefore has a noindex to not be tracked, it's OK to translate.\n- Personalize...: I 100% agree, good catch! Let's shift from \"organization\" to \"project\"... so: Personalize this Directus instance to fit your project needs. As for the translation, I think \"Directus Installation\" works just as well as Instance \u2013 so let's use that!\nThank you so much for your recommendations, they are all spot on. Let me know if you have any other questions or thoughts on this.\n. Thank you @TigerHix and @michaelnagy \u2013 that would be awesome! The first comment of this ticket gives an explanation of how to create the new language files. If you have any questions just let us know!\n. Took the words right out of my mouth @TigerHix ;)\n. Thanks @Gfast2! I'll let you coordinate with @TigerHix to get the chinese translation wrapped up.\n. Haha, good to know @katywings ;)\n@TigerHix Did you find some text in the framework that is not in the locale file?\n. @TigerHix and @Gfast2 \u2013 any update on the Chinese translation? Once we have a PR for it we'll merge it into development. We're planning on merging development into master in the next few days... so it'd be great to have that included.\nLet me know, and thank you very much!\n. Hey @TigerHix \u2013 70% is great! Looking forward to seeing the final product. And yes, if there's a big difference in Font quality for Chinese we can look into adding conditionals for specific languages. It needs to be open-source, and ideally from the Google Font library. Since I can't read Chinese I wouldn't be good at assessing the quality \u2013 would you have time to look through those fonts to see if any are styled significantly better?\n@WellingGuzman \u2013 Can we get those last strings into the translation file in the next few days?\n. Thanks @pmichaelis \u2013 we really appreciate the help!\nHey All \u2013 @katywings had a good suggestion, adding you all to the Directus Slack channel might be easier for communicating.

No need to be overly literal, whatever you think works best. \ud83d\ude0a\n@RijkvanZanten \u2013 that's amazing! Thank you so much! You can be more informal if you think that's appropriate. \n. @AeonZh \u2013 almost forgot about that one! You can use these docs to get up and running:\nhttps://github.com/directus/docs/blob/master/01-getting-started/03-installation.md\nIf you create a hosted account I can give you a few free months, but you can't really preview your code there so that doesn't help. \n. That would be great @lapa182 \u2013 BR/PT would be a huge addition to the locales!\nThank you!. Hey @kakuevn \u2013 absolutely! We would be thrilled to have a Russian translation!. Let us know how it goes @alvsconcelos \u2013 we would really appreciate you helping us add Portuguese to our supported languages! :)\nI'll keep this ticket open for visibility.. Thank you @honzabilek4 ! That would be amazing! Each of these new languages opens up Directus to a whole new demographic of users, so we really appreciate it!. Thanks @anatoliayazilim!!! We're only a couple weeks away from releasing 7.0 in beta... so feel free to wait and do that one instead (since it will be quite different)! Either way, thank you so much!. Kamino closed and cloned this issue to directus/directus-6-legacy. yeah! It would be easy to miss these settings... so we should navigate to them after field creation. Do you agree? We could make that a UI option if not all UI types will have required options.\n. @Wedjaa \u2013 Sorry for the late response, but this is amazing. @WellingGuzman what do you think? Anything else this needs before we look at merging?\n. Yeah, this is great \u2013 and I agree that we can open a new PR for the password fetch.\nThanks @Wedjaa!\n. We've never thought about having two translation columns (for different related tables). We designed the UI to store all the data in a single table. That said, I don't know why there would be an issue with this... my guess is:\nThe Edit Page has some hardcoded Translation UI logic that is causing this. I believe that all translations are coded to show up at the end of the edit page... so the logic probably stops after it finds the first one.\nHopefully this is an easy adjustment, otherwise we'll need to move this into a later version (6.5) or FeatHub.\n. This UI is working really well now (two translation fields also work), thanks @WellingGuzman \n. Migrated to FeatHub\nPlease use the Directus FeatHub to vote for features or make new request. Accepted feature requests will be added to GitHub Issues.\n. Excellent! Thank you @katywings for the great start!\n. We could also merge it (incomplete) so that other's can contribute from the bottom up... which was mentioned yesterday. \n. Thanks @TigerHix \u2013 we'll look into this today. Appreciate the bug reporting!\n. This is excellent! Getting some great language files in there already!\nThank you @jonhershon!\n. @WellingGuzman Does this take allow null into consideration?\nIf the INT has allow_null = false and we set it to NULL, will it convert to 0 or throw an error?\n. Hmm, I think it's OK for the API to throw an error if you send NULL to an INT column that doesn't support NULL. But it needs to respond with an error that makes sense:\nThe column \"xxxxx\" does not support the value \"NULL\"\n. Perfect... I added a note to that other ticket.\n. Ahh yes, the cart before the horse...\nI remember we were trying to figure this one out a year or two ago. Not sure how complicated it is, but the related item (hotel_offer) should not actually save until the parent is saved... and we would need a way to get the parent ID first... so we can save it into the related item.\n@WellingGuzman does that make sense? Do you know why the related item is being saved in the DB before the parent is saved?\n. Ahh, not actually trying to save it, but the FK is validating false? That also makes sense.\nAnyon have ideas on how we can resolve this?\n. This is working perfectly now \u2013 thanks @WellingGuzman \n. Basically we need to decide:\nCan a checkbox ever be required (must be clicked)? The answer is, only if the field was marked as \"required\" within Directus. Not because it has \"not null\".\n. Nice, so the only way to make it required is to set the field to \"required\" within Directus...\nI like it. Are you still testing this one or should we close?\n. Sounds good... if you see a problem just re-open.\n. Yes, but I don't think that's how it should be. Do you?\nHow it should work (open to suggestions) \u2013 @WellingGuzman is this what we're doing now?\nEITHER WAY (NULL OR NOT NULL): The UI should save with 0 or 1 and is not required (by default) unless the Directus Settings > Required is turned on.\n\nAs a new feature, if ALLOW NULL is on, then we should have a UI Option that says:\n- False = NULL\n- False = 0\n. Tested, and working!\n. Whoa \u2013 this is amazing @laszlokorte, thank you so much for this PR!\nWill this help with our other ticket regarding stricter typing?\nI really like the idea of of moving (core) UI default values to a variable object... would help clean that up a lot. @WellingGuzman what do you think?\n. Question: With the UI defaults moved to the variable object, doesn't that mean that the UI doesn't have defaults until the user saves the UI Options? For example:\nI create a new column/UI (WYSIWYG) and do not view or save the UI options because I'm fine with the defaults. Now when I see that UI on an edit page it won't have the default values (eg: height = 500px) because no options are saved in the DB. \nIsn't that correct?\n. Ahh, thanks for enlightening me... this is so much simpler! Really awesome @laszlokorte \u2013 thanks again!\n. @WellingGuzman is this something you can do? Are you thinking 6.3 or 6.4?\n. OK, great!\n. Thanks @laszlokorte \u2013 we're rolling out 6.3 and any testing is more than appreciated!\n. Ahh, that's not how it should be. If a TEXT column is NOT NULL, then you should still be able to choose if it's required or not. If not, then it would save an empty string: \"\"\nThe same applies to other datatypes.\n. We can't test on the pre-check since we don't have DB creds yet. But the test is now blocking on the final install page (Confirm).\n. Thanks @mercyg \u2013 that would be amazing! Welling can answer any technical questions you may have... and feel free to join us on Slack for easier communication:\nhttp://slack.getdirectus.com. Thank you so much for your contribution @Alxmerino! Another ticket bites the dust...\nAlways thankful for PRs!. This is no longer an issue with 6.4. Edit interfaces are no longer within this (overflow:hidden) card view \u2013 now they simply exist on the page without bounds.. Just a note reminder that we should try to clean up the \"File too large\" error at some point. Kamino closed and cloned this issue to directus/directus-6-legacy. Hey @Kakoum \u2013 thanks for the ticket! We will get this resolved and pushed this morning...\n. Hey @Kakoum \u2013 it looks like this was an issue with the database being in STRICT MODE. We have fixed the issue and you should be able to install without a problem now. We're working toward better support of STRICT MODE in the next few weeks...\n. Hey @Kakoum \u2013 are you creating the table in Directus or PHPMyAdmin? Do you have any column in it? If you can export the SQL for the table and include it here that might help. Thanks again for reporting this!\n. Hey @Kakoum \u2013 we're having trouble replicating this issue so we're going to move it to the 6.3.1 patch. We'll fix it as soon as we can find find reliable steps to reproduce. Thanks again for reporting! Let us know if you're still experiencing it after upcoming the 6.3 merge and deploy.\n. Additionally, we have opened up a BountySource item for $250 to try and get a quality UI built more expeditiously.\n. Exactly @laszlokorte \u2013 I had included that under Optional Formatting Buttons as I don't think it's required. I think it could be a useful UI Option... or it could be it's own UI module (since it's so useful).\nThe real question is how how we delineate each module. @WellingGuzman and I just discussed this at length for the datetime, date, and time modules... should they be combined, extended, or remain individual since they deal with different datatypes.\nUltimately we're looking to get a WYSIWYG editor, and any other UIs people can dream/code up. I'd love to hear your thoughts!\n. Good thinking @chrisys \u2013 we can add those as optional buttons as well. Typically we try to keep any formatting that borders on design out of the content \u2013 but I too have had clients request this option.\n. Thanks @lukeed \u2013 any and all input is appreciated, especially on this thread as it's a big topic of contention.\nI like your editor: lightweight, simple, and extensible... exactly what we're looking for.\nWe're working on a design and markup refresh for v6.6 so we will start experimenting with your library soon. Thanks!\n. An excellent point @pittkost! \nI agree that this would be the ideal way to move forward and have run into this situation with my own client work. Most WYSIWYG editors have an \"HTML\" view toggle to accomplish this, but it's not an ideal UI/UX. We're overhauling the platform design and UIs now and will be creating a new WYSIWYG editor \u2013 we'll look into libraries that would support this customization and how we would structure the UI Options for setting this up.\nThanks for the suggestion!. We'll have two: Simple (medium style inline WYSIWYG) and Full-Featured (typical editor, with a million buttons options). Most likely using:\nhttps://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor. One of the major updates in 6.4 is the new WYSIWYG editors. We have an Inline version (based on Medium) and an full-featured version (TinyMCE). We are abandoning the existing custom version in favor of these new options \u2013 although it could easily be migrated to 6.4 if you want to continue using it.\nWe will continue to evolve these editors, but the hard part has been done.\nA big thank you to @rijkvanzanten (our Interface Lead) for making these updates \u2013 this also closes the number one issue on FeatHub.. Good catch! As always, we appreciate the testing/tickets!\n. Thanks @laszlokorte! Must have missed this in our datetime/date/time overhaul a few weeks ago.\n. Thanks for the recommendations @kamikazechaser! I agree that supporting both of those would be awesome. We have a small core team right now and are focusing on stability, the API, and Docs... but would 100% support anyone who was interested in creating a pull-request for those ports.\nThanks again!\n. Hey @ibrahimtaguri \u2013 what's going on with this?\n. Thank you @iLama! Always appreciate PRs liek this!\n. Thanks @EmilienCo \u2013 always appreciate PRs! Great update...\n. Hey @YounessTayer \u2013 thanks for reporting this! Any update on this user creation issue? It seems like you might have encrypted the user's password incorrectly, but we want to make sure your issue is resolved.\nLet us know! :)\n. Thanks @niseku! We're looking into this now. Can you go back into the UI options and confirm those checkboxes are still checked?\n. Good find @neosign! We're looking into this now... though it looks like your proposed fix is the way to go!\nThank you very much for reporting this and identifying a solution \u2013 very helpful!\n. Thank you @EmilienCo!! We'll take a look at this asap and get it merged in...\nAppreciate the PR!\n. PR fixes like this are extremely helpful, thank you @EmilienCo!\n. Thank you @neosign! Always some sneaky bugs after a big release. We're looking into this now and will push a fix asap.\n. Good find! Thank you for reporting this @realpablodias! We'll get this resolved asap and push a fix.\nAppreciate the help!\n. Excellent \u2013 thanks again @beevelop... this is a huge help!\n. Thank you @beevelop! We really appreciate you reporting this issue! \ud83d\udc4d \n. Good eye! Small but important update. Thanks @tarkant \ud83d\udc4d \n. Thanks @luissantos \u2013 we're looking into this now! Appreciate you posting this...\n. Hey @KarteekM \u2013 that would be amazing! You can email me at info@getdirectus.com and we'll invite you into our Slack to discuss. We'd love to have a passionate developer working on our UIs... here's where I think you could start:\nAdding a New UI Options\nYou could start by cleaning up and extending one of our UIs. For example, you could add an option to the Single File UI to take a photo through the computer camera (currently you can only upload/choose existing images).\nCreating a New UI\nOnce you understand how the UIs work (pretty straightforward) you can try creating a new one, like a \"currency\" UI. This UI could have options for currency type, showing cents, formatting/validation, anything that you think would be useful.\nGeneral Clean Up\nOnce you have a solid grasp over the UIs you could help clean up and standardize all the UIs. Cleaning up the code, adding comments, converting UIs to directories with template files (instead of escaped JS), adding/renaming options, etc\nI am always available to help on the design side, so if you get a UI working, I'm happy to assist with the front-end styling and UX.\n. Hey @rammy4real \u2013 that's great to hear! Based on your skill set I would say the modular UIs are the best place to start (see info above). You can duplicate one of the existing UIs and then try to create a few of your own. Once you're happy with it just send it over as a pull-request!\nI'll add you to Slack so we can chat over there too...\n. We can close this \u2013 it was more of a placeholder. The only outstanding items here are:\n\ndropdown_relational\nmultiselect_dropdown_relational\nmultiselect_list_relational\nselect_list_relational\n\nBut I've added those to ToDoist for internal tracking with @rijkvanzanten \nObviously, anyone who wants to submit an Interface can still do so even though this ticket is closed!. Thanks for reporting this @Marco1886!!\n. Thanks @timonmat \u2013 we really appreciate you taking the time to report this. We'll follow up here shortly with an update or fix.\n. Sorry for the inconvenience, but appreciate you finding and reporting this @timonmat \u2013 thanks!\n. Yeeessss, thanks @QSDev!!\n. Thanks for trying to replicate @timonmat \u2013 much appreciated! Not a fan of the intermittent issues... \ud83d\ude15  ... but either way, glad it's working for you.\n. Hey @Ronnyrr \u2013 I've invited you to our Directus Slack channel... we can help you figure this out over there. \ud83d\udc4d \n. For all those experiencing this issue... what version of Directus are you using? Is this all for v6.3.4 as posted in the original comment?. Kamino closed and cloned this issue to directus/directus-6-legacy. Yeeesssss!!! Thank you @AeonZh!\n. Thank you @JackNUMBER for reporting this! We'll certainly have to go back and check for any places where longer translations break the initial design. I've resolved these two and checked for others, if any others appear let me know!\nWe're working on a design refresh for an upcoming version... we'll make sure this is considered for that subversion.\n. Looking forward to the cleaned up version \u2013 but this is a great idea/start! Thanks @michieltjuh11!\n. Thanks @andreasotto \u2013 a lot of users were adding table/column names that were invalid so we added a auto-formatter that is a bit too strict. We're resolving this in the next release of Directus. In the meantime you can add/rename tables/columns directly in the database.\nAppreciate you taking the time to report this!\n. Good to hear! The mod_rewrite issue has been ongoing... if you know of a better way to test/check that module we'd love to get this resolved! Thanks @andreasotto \n. Excellent \u2013 thanks @mkly! Any and all contributions are welcome... we appreciate the PR! @WellingGuzman will take a look and merge!\n. Hey @andreasotto \u2013 we can look into this. And yes, you can easily create a new UI... or fix this one ;)\nHere are the docs for creating or updating UIs:\nhttps://github.com/directus/docs/tree/master/05-custom-uis\n. @andreasotto \u2013 Yes! That would be amazing, that's exactly the type of editor we're looking to move to (but have no time yet). I imagine the only complex part would be getting it to play nicely with Directus Images (for inserting images/embeds)... but I'm sure we can figure it out.\nI'd love to see what you come up with (if you have time) \u2013 very exciting!\n. Here's the other ticket regarding this \u2013 it has a bunch of other options for WYSIWYG libraries:\nhttps://github.com/directus/directus/issues/1242\n. Hey @cedricve \u2013 just to follow up on a few of the points @WellingGuzman made:\nWe're in the process of addressing some UX/UI issues in the next visual overhaul of the platform. The admin side especially should be much more intuitive.\nBookmarks are quite useful for the more complex filters:\nActive Projects from 2015 with author containing %cedric% ordered by views, descending can be saved as \"Cedric's 2015 Projects\" for example.\n\nWe are not getting anywhere\n\nWelling means that \"we are no going anywhere\" ;) ... We have a small but dedicated team working full-time and a growing number of open-source contributors. There are a lot of big releases on the horizon and our roadmap extends to the middle of next year already. Ten years in and we are just getting started.\nIf you're interested in custom features you can contact RANGER (the managing entity of Directus) at:\ninfo@rngr.org\nWe'd love any input (criticism or praise) from users like yourself \u2013\u00a0that's how we know what to do next. Also, we can design and develop faster as our team and community grows \u2013 helping us gain exposure through social media (@directus) is a huge help at this stage.\nThank you very much for taking the time to write this post!\n. Hey @frankvolkel \u2013 you're correct, we're storing the full item at each change, as well as the delta (with user for accountability). Activity is shown inline with comments at the bottom of the Item Detail page. And while we used to have an interface for \"rolling back\" we've disabled it due to unintended and far-reaching consequences of relational data.\nThe thinking (for now) is that the data is there and admins can roll items back to previous states using what's in the directus_activity table. We're actually in the middle of a design refresh that addresses this issue which will be rolling out in v6.5! Thanks for keeping us honest, and sorry for any confusion!\n. Could it be a whitespace issue? jpg, png versus jpg,png? Or are we trimming out the whitespace after exploding the values? Also, this option supports MIME type OR extension, correct?. @doughnet \u2013 that's odd... but you said that ONE extension (not a CSV) does work?. @PolywickStudio \u2013 That's exactly what we have planned in the next version \u2013 yes. You can check out the static template preview here:\nhttp://preview.getdirectus.com/settings/tables/new\nYou can see the table name at the top has a checkbox to toggle \"strict naming\" and if you click to create a new column the same checkbox is present.\nIs this what you mean? Then we could maintain \"proper\" casing/formatting by default, but allow for people to override that if they want.. True \u2013 but there's more potential auto-formatting that that: eg entering an Underscore vs Space vs Dash.\nMight be best to have one option where WE auto-format to help keep things standard by default \u2013 or an override option where you can do anything (if you know what you're doing, that is).. Going to close this since it has been addressed in the next version design. Thanks @PolywickStudio!. Thanks @cedricve \u2013 I've been eyeing that domain for a while now. Hopefully we can snag it (we'll see what they are looking for in terms of offers).\nClosing this until I hear back from the owner of the domain.. @WellingGuzman What is the state of this? I know we merged in a PR... . Hey @cedricve \u2013 glad you're liking Directus so far. The drag and drop reordering seems pretty intuitive to us (once you've read the docs on reordering). What about it seems unclear? \nYou need to add a column to store the order value, and as of now need to call that column sort. In the next version you can name it anything you want and \"tell\" Directus which column stores the value. Any other improvements you can think of?. Sorry, this seems to have been a miscommunication. By adding that column it enables drag and drop reordering on the item listing page for that table. Directus saves the appropriate integers into the column, but the user only sees items that can be dragged and dropped. \nDoes that make more sense? I'd that what you were looking for?. Thanks @Radiergummi \u2013 this is perfect! There are a few issues with multi-lingual text lengths, but we're looking to resolve them in the new design we're implementing now (see below). In the meantime, your CSS seems to work great, so I'm pushing that to the development branch.\nReally appreciate the help!\nhttps://preview.getdirectus.com/tables/blog. Thanks @ValonK \u2013 we'll look into this today!. Thanks @duncanhsieh! This is great!. This is awesome @Alxmerino!!!\nThank you so much for this huge PR... we really appreciate it! \ud83d\ude04 . Hey @sanpoChew \u2013 we have not been able to reproduce this, and the drag-and-drop for Item Listings is refactored in the new version (6.4). Let us know if you're still getting this and we'll get it sorted!. Can we test this in 6.4 to see if it's still occurring? If not we can close.... It's been months with no follow-up. This should be working fine in 6.4 so we'll close this ticket. If anyone can replicate this issue in the latest version we can re-open \u2013 but we can't replicate it as of now.. Hey @globallog \u2013 this seems like a DIRECTUS_PATH issue with your config. We;ll close this ticket since it's been a few months without a response. Let us know if the issue persists and we'll re-open!. Good reference: https://restdb.io/docs/querying-with-the-api#restdb\nJust adding these ideas here in case they inspire someone, but the structure is different so this would have to be for v1.2 or be a NEW filter param that sits alongside the current one (so it doesn't break backwards compatibility):\n'filters' => [\n    'or' => [\n        'to' => ['eq' => 1],\n        'from' => ['eq' => 1]\n    ],\n    'and' => [\n        'active' => ['eq' => 1]\n    ]\n],\n'filters' => [\n    [\n        'to' => [\n            'eq' => 1\n        ],\n        'operator' => 'or',\n        'from' => [\n            'eq' => 1\n        ]\n    ]\n],. That's the only place it's been done \u2013\u00a0but it's missing in all the other places within Settings.. Hey @malindamiller \u2013 it's not done, and we'd love the help!\nMost, if not all, of these Settings templates are located here:\nhttps://github.com/directus/directus/tree/master/app/templates/modules/settings\nThanks for the help!. OK, all of these have been updated (title and datatype)... if we find more we should add them. Pinging @rijkvanzanten \ud83d\udd14 . Hey @PolywickStudio \u2013 thank you for submitting this. New features should be submitted and voted on at FeatHub. This has already been requested, so feel free to upvote!\nhttp://feathub.com/directus/directus/+43\nAlso, I should mention that this feature is being added into the next release of Directus (6.4)! So you should be able to review this in a few weeks!. Het @ricricucit \u2013 part of this is a bug, yes. To answer your question, there is a nav_listed toggle that allows you to keep view enabled (eg: inside relational interfaces) but removes the table from the left nav. You can also use the group's nav_blacklist to accomplish something similar.\n@WellingGuzman \u2013 When adjusting group permissions, it should only immediately update the GUI (eg: hide the table in the nav) if you are editing YOUR group (always the admin group as of now, since only they can edit permissions).\nThe error is that if I (admin) update another group (managers) table to VIEW = FALSE ... it updates the nav to hide it for ME too... which it shouldn't since I'm not updating my group.. @ricricucit \u2013 thanks for the update. We're talking about the nav_listed versus permissions over on this ticket too: https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/1625\nI would like to have the permissions control everything, but in some instances it's good to have a global option (so you don't have to change something for every group). I'd love to get your thoughts on all this!. @WellingGuzman Can you give this an hour of research and testing to see if it's an issue or resolved? If we can't replicate, let's close since it's been a few months with no response.. @jhyle \u2013 can you add a schema here (on PM us in Slack) so we can reproduce?\n@rijkvanzanten \u2013 can you see if this is happening for you in the Interface Gallery?. Hello @quadriq \u2013 we can update the docs to make all of this more clear. Apologies for any confusion!. Hey @nmpribeiro \u2013 I think I understand this issue. You're saying that you have multiple language options \u2013 and even though you have the first (id=1) set as the default, you think it should bypass that one because you've deleted it? Instead showing the next active item?\nI actually agree with Welling here. Directus makes no assumptions about your architecture \u2013 including status/workflow. If you set the default to 1 \u2013 that is the default. Since the status (workflow) is completely customizable, \"deleted\" (actually \"soft-deleted\") is just a state. You can imagine if this were \"draft\" instead, then it could be useful to have the draft language be the default until it's ready to publish.\nAs Welling said, certainly open to discuss \u2013 but that's my take. I'll close this in the meantime unless this becomes an actionable ticket. Either way, thank you for thinking this through! :). Thank you for submitting this @tmikaeld. We'll update the \"Directus Files\" button to be brand agnostic asap.\nAs we discussed before, the code (classes and resource names) may not happen so quickly. Our goal is to create a CMS that can easily be branded to match any organization or corporate branding at the admin webapp level. At the developer level we still want to grow awareness for our platform and the best way to do this is to have some way for developers to know where it came from and to learn more about our framework. Since our codebase is open-source you always have the option to fork/change things \u2013 but we would hope that in most circumstances you would still give credit to our team/organization.. I understand the concern here, some responses/thoughts:\n\n\n\"No fixed branding or styling\" \u2013 this means that the Directus framework is not heavily styled with a proprietary design. It is minimal and brand agnostic, using desaturated colors except for color callouts as needed (red = serious, yellow = important, blue = CTA, etc). Other than a very small \"Powered by Directus\" on the login page (that can be removed, but we'd appreciate it staying) there is only a Directus logo that can be overridden with a company logo. This is a \"best effort\" to minimize our brand/impact so that others can apply their own style \u2013 not to \"hide\" the framework.\n\n\nThis is open-source software. You can always adjust the SCSS/CSS files to suit your style needs \u2013 especially easy with the SASS variables. You can also change most text through the translation file (or in the codebase) \u2013 allowing you to remove \"Directus\" if needed.\n\n\nWe won't take this to the 100% extreme because that is less clear for developers. For instance, removing the term \"Directus\" from the code. At a certain point it is useful to know if a table/feature/etc belongs to Directus... and so those things will be/remain appropriately named. Alternate, more agnostic, terms such as \"system\" would be more confusing.\n\n\nWe are free and open-source. Use the software as you will, but we invest a lot of time and energy into building this platform and don't have the \"enterprise\" dollars to market/advertise. So word of mouth, and direct exposure to our free (yet premium) product are our best options. In the end, if clients have tech savvy people that find out the platform is Directus \u2013 then they should still be able to see the value/need for the team that is setting up and extending Directus. Essentially this all boils down to one point:\n\n\nOpen-source Directus is unbranded, not white-labeled.\nHappy to discuss further if needed. If anyone comes across a blatant button or component that says \"Directus\" please let us know and we'll try to resolve that.. Hey @the0neyouseek \u2013 this would be amazing!\nWe try to keep a version of the basic Interfaces in the Core, but are always looking for new and innovative ways to interact with data... especially for more common edge-cases like this. We would absolutely love a PR if you want to create this Interface. I would recommend duplicating the current Select as a starting point \u2013 that way this is its own module.\nYou can look at our 6.4 branch to see the new styling too \u2013 since the next release will be coming out in a few weeks it would make sense to use those style standards.\nThanks again! Excited to see what you come up with!!. Hey @the0neyouseek \u2013 wow!! This is amazing! Really great job!\nHere are some answers to your questions:\n I think it depends on which interfaces it replaces (see below). If it's part of the main select then search should be disabled by default since most people will likely have fewer items. Alternatively, we could have the option be a dropdown with: Auto (default), On, Off ... and for auto it automatically enables with over X items (if that's even possible).\n @WellingGuzman would know better than me... but I would say let's merge it to 6.4 so it's in with all our big changes in the next release. Of course if you want to get it out into the world sooner (than 1-2 weeks) then we can merge it to dev.\n select\n    * OK, so my first question is how well does this work on mobile? The ONLY reason the standard dropdown (with overlay styling) was nice is because mobile devices have system interfaces for these. It'd be a bummer to lose that (maybe we can fall back with a mobile conditional?). Either way, we can have it replace select but let's add a display style option (dropdown) that includes:\n        * Styled Dropdown\n        * Styled Dropdown with Search\n        * System Dropdown\n        * Radio Buttons (?)\n    * My OTHER question is: Would you have the options handle STATIC (eg: CSV of allowed options) and RELATIONAL data (eg: M2O)? If it can handle both use cases really well... then maybe* it's better to merge select and many_to_one. I think another consideration is how much overlap there is for the Options... since we don't want a lot of unused/confusing options depending on the interface style you choose. It's hard to find the right balance between combining Interfaces and splitting them up... so maybe this is worth discussing a bit more.\n    * Multi-select saves data differently (and is also visually different) so I don't think that would be merged into this. I could see multi-select being combined with the \"array of checkboxes\" though... since it saves data the same. HOWEVER, this would save the same as an array of radio buttons... so maybe that's a good interface option!\nHopefully this all makes sense and isn't too crazy! I'd love to hear what you think \u2013 and thank you again, I'm really impressed!!. Hey @the0neyouseek \u2013 we have some good data here, let's keep this ticket and shift it to multi-select! Same things apply \u2013 we just need an option to allow for a system interface, with an upgrade to yours.\nThank you! Good progress here!. That's great @the0neyouseek \u2013 we really appreciate all the help!\nAnd yes, I've been getting ready to post on Reddit/PH once we're super stable within 6.4... it will be a big rush, so I want to make sure everyone is done with normal fixes/updates so we have \"all hands on deck\" available.\nThank you for the PlacesToPost, hadn't seen this! We can ramp up with some of the smaller ones. We were trending yesterday on something called webdesignernews.com and it was a huge bump \u2013 so Reddit/PH could be enormous. One chance for first impressions... and all that. ;). Haha, amazing! I absolutely don't mind \u2013 as I said, it's good to ramp up with the marketing so we can anticipate traffic (etc). Also, there are always more bugs after a new release with lots of changes... so I'm sure everyone saw a more stable version. Thank you so much for doing that \u2013 we can use all the exposure we can get!. Hey @the0neyouseek \u2013 just found a pretty big issue with the current SELECT interface:\nIf you open the select dropdown and then scroll, the menu stays fixed on the page (not attached to the interface). Also, once you lose that menu, the whole page stops being clickable (weird). We'll need to get this resolved or roll-back to the system dropdown unfortunately.\nLet me know what you think!. Not problem @the0neyouseek \u2013 thanks for looking into this! Yeah, it's probably listening to page scroll instead of .page scroll... something odd like that would be my guess.. Hey @the0neyouseek \u2013 any updates on this?. No problem \u2013 busy times all around! Looking forward to the PR! :). Thank you for this contribution @the0neyouseek \u2013 the scroll issue is actually part of the external library (because we can't set the offset parent as a parameter). So there's no reason to keep this open \u2013 and it's not a huge bug (just weird scrolling if it's open).\nI'll close this, and we can revisit if anything else comes up!\nWe really appreciate the help \u2013 these interfaces look great!. This is perfect! I'm glad you found and started with the easiest one (Instructions interface is static). \ud83d\ude04 \nJust like we were talking about yesterday, this would be a good candidate for an Interface merge. We have a new \"Interface\" in 6.4 called Section Break which you can see at the bottom of this page: https://preview.getdirectus.com/tables/blog/1#title\nWe should adapt Instructions to handle all types of static text:\n\nSection Break\nSection Break with Explainer Text\nExplainer Text\n\nThis is already kind of possible since the main option is a WYSIWYG and you can use H1 tags... but it would be good to update the style so it matches the 6.4 preview.\nAlso, you may have figured this out, but there is a Directus datatype called ALIAS that is used when you have a field/input/interface that doesn't actually have a column in the database. Examples would be:\n\nInstructions: No column\nSlideshow (and other M2M): The data is stored in other tables, there is no actual \"slideshow\" column (although we could make a slideshow Interface that stores as a CSV of IDs in an actual column). @WellingGuzman \u2013 is there anything else we can update in the Docs or code comments to make sure this is clear (including for windows)?. Any updates @marc-andrecroteau? . Better still, when and how this updates should be an Interface option. \n\n@rijkvanzanten \u2013 any thoughts on this?. Ooh, I like the check for uniqueness @rijkvanzanten! Good thinking! I think @WellingGuzman is just going to get it working... then you can take over.. Here's my two cents:\naddress Interface is an ALIAS datatype (meaning it's not attached to a specific column) and we have the following options:\n Address Column Mapping (Dropdown of columns in this table)\n Address 2 Column Mapping\n City Column Mapping\n State Column Mapping\n* etc...\nAfter that, I feel like there are two possible high-level directions:\nOption 1: Submit Multiple Values from One Interface\nI like this one more, it feels cleaner. We change the way Directus works (I think, maybe it will just work!). We HIDE all the proper column interfaces (address, city, etc)... but SHOW the address column interface (an ALIAS). This address interface has each input name equal to the column it maps to. When we save the Item, those values all save to their respective columns.\nThe only think I don't know is if there are any issues submitting values from Interfaces that aren't the true \"owner\" of that column. OR what would happen if you DIDN'T HIDE the proper interface and TWO values are submitted with the same name. Maybe the address interface could run a check for this onLoad and throw a warning?\nOption 2: Copy Values Into Other Interfaces\nWe have all the fields nicely organized in one Interface template and onchange each input saves its value into the \"normal\" interface for that column. Then we \"hide\" the normal columns/interfaces so we only see the new address Interface.\n\nThoughts? Hopes? Wishes? Dreams? Concerns?. This is great @ricricucit! I agree, we should make the Interface save as standard lat/lon in the managed column. The Interface can also have options for mapping the geocoded values to other columns.\nIf the other column inputs are hidden then we can display it exactly as you have it sketched out here. Otherwise we can simply add values into the other inputs automatically (based on the mapping in the options).\nThis is exciting! It will be great to have such a thought-through and polished Map/Location interface!. This is an awesome idea @rijkvanzanten! A great solution.\nI question the show_value option for a hidden interface... but I get why it's useful.\nFor the map interface options, maybe we can have a fallback (or duplicate this interface) so it doesn't need an API key? Is there an open-source map that does geocoding for addresses?. No, Directus is a \"headless\" CMS, which means it only manages content/data and tries to avoid anything presumptuous about how you might use that data (website, native app, kiosk, etc). So there are no templates built-in. However we do have an example of how you could setup a website (with templating): https://github.com/directus/webapp-example. Hey @johhansantana \u2013 we're adding a \"public\" user group for just this purpose in the next version (6.4). It should be available for beta in about a week.. It will be a branch (or maybe a beta release tag) like this:\nhttps://github.com/directus/directus/tree/version/6.4. Hey @mpiontek \u2013 our interface lead (@rijkvanzanten) said he likes this idea, and plans to add it into the new Slug interface for version 6.4. The beta for that is coming tomorrow, but the new interface option may take a little bit longer as we cleanup the new release.\nAs for Docs, we've been trying to keep adding more and more info, but are a small team and have been busy with this new release the past few months. If you don't see it in our Docs or API Docs then we probably don't have anything yet. If you open tickets for missing info on the Docs repo then we'll get that taken care of!\nhttps://github.com/directus/docs\nhttps://github.com/directus/api-docs. Hey @mpiontek \u2013 sorry about the late reply! We're actually releasing this feature in the next version of Directus (6.4) which will be in beta tomorrow! It is an accountability option under Settings that lets you choose columns for date_created, user_created, date_modified, and user_modified. We'll continue to optimize this functionality \u2013 but it's a big step forward!\nThank you for posting this request!. Hey @krupper \u2013 we've recently released version 6.4 where we resolved a similar issue. Could you test on the new version?\nUnfortunately, because of our small team (and no real funding) we can only support our most recent version, so we won't be hotfixing 6.3.x any more. Instead we recommend that users upgrade to the newest version.\nI'll close this because the API seems to be returning the correct values on 6.4... let us know if you still see the issue and we'll re-open.. Thanks @studiovlijmscherp \u2013 good catch! I've updated the repo, it will push to the site shortly.\nIn the future, report these to the issues section of the Docs repo (or better yet, send us a PR \ud83d\ude09 ):\nhttps://github.com/directus/docs. This looks awesome!! Great job @rijkvanzanten \u2013 checking it out now!. Thanks @jokmontoya \u2013 glad you figured it out... we appreciate the PR!!. Hey @ajshortt \u2013 let us know if the example Welling provided fixes your issue. It's been a few months with no response, and we've released a new version (6.4), so I'll close this since the example code provided works.. Good fix, thanks @dalbinaco!. Hey @studiovlijmscherp \u2013 apologies for the late response here. We have been very busy getting ready for the release of 6.4.\nYour schema printout is helpful, but could you please send the SQL you're using to help us save time? That also helps because it ensures we're seeing the same thing (no slight differences in column/interface setup).\nMore importantly, could you please try this same schema/issue on version 6.4 to see if the problem persists? There are many differences in the codebases and this issue might have already been solved in the newer version.\nThank you!. Hey @studiovlijmscherp \u2013 we're released 6.4 and the API seems to be returning values correctly now. We're seeing complete relational objects nested within the returned JSON. The depth parameter does seem to have an issue though, so I'll open a new ticket for that now.\nI'll close this ticket, please upgrade to 6.4 and let us know if your issue is now resolved.. When you choose \"No\" on the update modal, it does not take you to the same exact page you requested.\nIf you're on a bookmark and change the status to also show DRAFT, then it asks you if you want to update your bookmark (you say \"no\"), then it should show you the normal Listing page and SHOW DRAFT (like you requested).. Exactly. But right now the NEW change (that caused the modal) is not moving over. Example:\nNormal: published\nBookmark: draft\nUser is viewing bookmark, and ADDS published but does NOT save/update the bookmark. It should navigate to Normal:\nNormal: published, draft\nBookmark: draft\nbut instead it just goes to:\nNormal: draft\nBookmark: draft. OK, this looks good now. Not working for interface options \u2013 but we'll get to this after release. Getting close!\nCan we update that \"Change your preferences\" link to point to THEIR user detail page? Directus will redirect them there after login.\nFor emails sent from Directus Messages... can we include the name of the sender below?\nAnd can these email subject lines have [Directus: Project Name] at the end?\nIt doesn't like that logo for some reason:\n\nHere's an article about why an image might not display:\nhttps://support.google.com/mail/answer/145919?hl=en\nAlso, the Email sender is getting a notice, is there anything we can do about this? Maybe send from a generic address?\n. Also, we should use the Project Logo (image) in the header \u2013 if it doesn't exist then we use the Directus logo (from their instance, not directus.io). OK, SVG Directus logo is not good for email, I just pushed a PNG into the repo... let's use that as a fallback to the Project Image. . $adapter = \\Directus\\Bootstrap::get('zendDb');\n$acl = \\Directus\\Bootstrap::get('acl');\n$table = new \\Directus\\Database\\TableGateway\\DirectusUsersTableGateway($adapter, $acl);\n$user = $table->find(1);. @WellingGuzman \u2013 I am receiving multiple (3-4) copies of emails (notifications of new Directus Messages) from the SENDER. Maybe it is sending one for each reply? Either way, it should only send ONE.. We need a route to open messages. Same page, but should open the message in the right pane:\nhttp://local.directus.com/messages/new\nhttp://local.directus.com/messages/12 (opens message id:12). @WellingGuzman The only problem with using the project log (and project directus logo) is that it won't work on local (not a HUGE deal, but too bad). If we can TEST for local somehow, we can serve the directus.io logo in those cases.. OK, moved \"link to messages\" to FeatHub... the rest looks good!. I'm testing the Welcome Message modal. I created a new user in the DB and logged in... some things seem to be working but I got this error:\nError\nError: Uncaught TypeError: (intermediate value)(intermediate value).callback.call is not a function\nFile: http://local.directus.com/assets/js/libs/backbone.js?bust=8e89cfdcf6d936fb831e7b1a6dade6db7953025e\nLine:205\nAnd then when I finish, I get this error:\nServer Error\nArgument 1 passed to Directus\\Database\\TableGateway\\DirectusUsersTableGateway::__construct() must implement interface Zend\\Db\\Adapter\\AdapterInterface, string given, called in /Users/Ben/Sites/directus/api/core/Directus/Database/TableGateway/BaseTableGateway.php on line 152 and defined\nAlso, the password fields were still disabled so I couldn't update my password:\n\n.

Whew \u2013 finally done! Awesome job Welling.... When changing an interface, the options for the PREVIOUS interface are shown after saving.\nI had a slider interface and then changed it to a M2O... but when I saved the slider options were shown.. Looks good!. Looking good!. Force logout. There used to be a notification that came up with 1 minute remaining... Let's make sure we have that still. \nEventually this issue will be solved by the \"save progress\" feature.... There are a few interfaces (or pages) where I always get this message \u2013 even with no changes made. Let's come up with a solution to avoid this so we can mark this as complete.\nATTN @WellingGuzman @rijkvanzanten . This change ALWAYS hides the tab... it should only be hidden when the user CHANGES the Interface dropdown.. Error re-adding:\n\nIf you have saved relational items\nYou delete one (don't save)\nYou Choose Existing and add it back again\nIt will not show up in the listing or save. Working.. If you go from an empty interface and add one or more items, the table header does not appear. The whole table should be hidden if there are no results, and should show the entire table (header and body) when there are ANY new results.. OK, I think this is finally done!. Perfect!. Yeehaw!. Yes, this is important to have. We could use the outline property \u2013 or  look into a more styled approach. Do you have a preference Rijk?. Ahh, I like that! I haven't used double-box-shadows but will give that a try!. Added! I also updated some of the interfaces to use <buttons> instead of divs with a .button class... we'll want to update all of them in the interfaces though (and give tab-indexes to important non-buttons). This is a great find @lehha! We will make sure that all columns are fully qualified in v6.4 and make sure this isn't happening any more.. Hey @emil14 \u2013 let us know how this is going, I'd love to get it merged in for the new version release.\n\nThanks again! This is looking excellent!. No more error!. Looks good!. Nice!. OK, this is now closing!. Working. That's the active column... \ud83d\ude2c \nCan we remove the active column from this listing view?. Instead of removing this column we're going to create a directus_status interface that shows the status more elegantly (eg: blue circle). This interface should use the status mapping colors/names.. With the checkboxes now disabled, this is OK for now. In the future we should plan on creating a custom interface.. Clicking on status should NEVER do anything.. Done. This is working, but in WORKFLOW mode it's blinking/saving about 10 times (which seems weird). Tested \u2013 working.... Perfect! We can update the ticket to reflect that. OK \u2013 @WellingGuzman and I decided to NOT remove the nav_blacklist because of a complexity in the upcoming \"workflow permissions\" and because we need to control more than just Tables (also: extensions, User Directory, File Library, Activity Dashboard, etc).\nSo we need to do make sure the current nav_blacklist can allow for toggling the following:\n\nTables: eg any_table_name (Working)\nExtensions: eg any_extension_id (Not Working)\nUser Directory: directus_users (Not Working)\nFile Library: directus_files (Not Working)\nMessages: directus_messages (Not Working). It's currently called show files, but it SHOULD be allows_uploads.\nSince that's not controlled by permissions...\n\nOn May 21, 2017 12:14 AM, \"W.R.

Working now!. If \"Allow Profile Editing\" is off, does it still update the info at login? Eg: last_access, last_page, last_page, ip. Needs the placeholder text (use the example above). Yeehaw.... Looking good. Fixed. Interesting. This will also cause issues in the GUI since we sometimes show this as the file-type (when in reality we'd want to see docx). @WellingGuzman any thoughts on how to resolve this? Obviously we can increase the length of that column, but should we try to parse/simplify that document type of leave it as its default?. Perfect. Let's push this change to 6.4. We can also hotfix it to 6.3.x if needed... but 6.4 should be released within a week or so.. Lookin good!. Perfection.... @rijkvanzanten \u2013 can you confirm this is good-to-go?. @WellingGuzman \u2013 Can't we compare the server max upload size with the upload size for the current file? Then we could check if a file is too big BEFORE uploading and still have memory to show a proper error notification.\n\n@rijkvanzanten \u2013 any other ideas?. This is done except for the friendly error, so we're closing this ticket \u2013 follow up can be tracked here: https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/1237. Yeah, exactly. Let's have the currentPage default to one to avoid these issues. We can ALSO have perPage default to the instance default 200 I think. That way either param can be used alone.. Doesn't GitHub do this automatically?\nhttps://github.com/directus/directus/releases\nhttps://github.com/directus/directus/archive/6.4.0-beta.3.zip\nhttps://github.com/directus/directus/archive/6.4.0-beta.3.tar.gz\netc...\nDo we have this for the build branch?. OK, let's add that to our release workflow!. A new issue that has come to my attention: when we expand the rows (one for each status) then there are two columns that don't apply:\nadd (soon to be create) and nav_listed... because they don't depend on status. So we'll need a new interface.. The status is: incomplete.\nThe problem is the workflow (saving permissions by status) is not working. \nThe edit column: eg, an item in draft status can not be edited. (makes sense)\nThe add column: eg, an item doesn't have a status if it hasn't been added yet. (so this needs to be removed)\nThe interface: when you go to permissions on the preview site, and click the \"workflow\" button... Notice the expanded rows. This is the interface referred to. . Kamino closed and cloned this issue to directus/directus-6-legacy. Also, it's changing the q value to \"true\" when you perform a column filter (in the dropdown). Yeehaw!. And it looks like the \"email messages\" checkbox is showing a check even when set to 0. Getting this error when changing NEW user from Admin (default) to a \"staff\" group:\nError\nError: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot convert undefined or null to object\nFile: http://local.directus.com/app/core/interfaces/many_to_one/interface.js?bust=3573d1efffcb5e09def59fa11fc58cb8761c59fb\nLine:13. All good!. I can't replicate this \u2013 perhaps it was something happening to my specific machine.. Better!. Hello @peremp \u2013 which version of Directus are you using when you get this bug?. Ahh, you're right. We'll it should be an easy one for a new dev to implement :). Yeehaw!. {\n    \"this\": \"Great!\"\n}. Sorry this took so long to merge! I was thinking we should make the drop area like the others... but that can wait for now.\nThanks Rijk!. I think that is so any new columns go to the end of the list by default. They should be given an incrementing value from 1 when reordered. We should have an alias DATATYPE... but I don't think we need an alias INTERFACE. Let's remove it and see if any havoc is caused! \ud83d\udd25 . So much changed in 6.4 (code-wise) it may be difficult to find this difference. @peremp \u2013 have you been able to find any differences?. That's OK, we appreciate the testing either way! We'll get everything fixed, just might take a little time. Thanks and let us know if you run into any migration issues.... Can someone test to see if this is still happening on 6.4?. Ahh, I should have read your comment above. OK, well we could/should get this fixed for legacy versions, but due to our core team being SO small I think we're going to have to close this since the new release fixes it.\nIf anyone wants to find the offending code and submit a PR to 6.3.x we will gladly merge it! Otherwise, the official \"fix\" for this is to upgrade to the latest release (6.4).. Hey @krishnam09 \u2013 could you comment on the reason this was closed?. @rijkvanzanten Those screenshots are 6.3.x, so this is the legacy WYSIWYG.... @peremp \u2013 or you can send us a SQL dump with any private info removed. This is the best way to help us replicate it. Thank you!. Hey @peremp \u2013 if you have time, could you please check to see if this is still happening for you? We've been updating a lot over the past month so I want to either get this fixed or close it if it's no longer an issue.\nThank you!. Kamino closed and cloned this issue to directus/directus-6-legacy. After testing this same process in 6.4, everything seems to be working as expected (add multiple images without saving in between). Since we are releasing 6.4 in a few hours we will only be hotfixing previous versions if it's a critical/easy update.\nUpgrading to 6.4 will resolve this issue in the new WYSIWYG editor.. Having read this awesome article, I'm confident it answers all/most questions on setting up Custom Extensions. I'll close this unless there are other, more specific, questions.\nThanks @rijkvanzanten!!. Hey @wittwerch \u2013 I believe what Welling was saying is that we are pretty swamped with updates/fixes for the upcoming release of 6.4. So for issues like this (especially if they need to be resolved soon) we would be looking for contributors to help out if possible \u2013 otherwise it may take a while for us to get to them.\nObviously a simple translation isn't enough, someone would need to get into the codebase and make adjustments at a deeper level to localize date formatting (in a global/standardized way). \nBeing free and open-source, we have very limited resources, so any help from the community is greatly appreciated! Also, for changes like this, it might be best for a developer native to the language formats to make the change \u2013 since our team may not be as familiar with the intricacies. I've marked this ticket as Help Wanted, so hopefully we'll spark some interest and get a PR soon!. @WellingGuzman \u2013 let's resolve these three front-end dates and look for any others. Most of our dates/times are contextual (3 days ago) or within interfaces (which should already have a way to change display formatting, right @rijkvanzanten?).\nI can only think of this Calendar Listing View that shows actual dates/times... so let's localize them into the correct format based on the current_user.locale.. I agree \u2013 no interfaces preferences (for now). Let's focus on having the user's locale determine the formatting.. @WellingGuzman \u2013 could this be related to the Interface Gallery taking so long to load the listing page?. We're researching and working on the root cause over the next few days. We also have a parallel workstream for caching that will (optionally) speed things up.. I am still getting this error when re-ordering columns within Settings:\nServer Error\nThis query failed: INSERT INTO `directus_columns` (`id`, `column_name`, `sort`, `table_name`, `required`, `ui`, `hidden_list`, `hidden_input`, `comment`, `relationship_type`, `related_table`, `junction_table`, `junction_key_right`, `junction_key_left`) VALUES ('activity', 'activity', '12', 'activities', '', 'textarea', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL)\nIt's trying to enter the ID as the column name. \ud83d\udc7b  this phantom bug has somehow fixed itself. I will re-open if it's reproducible. Both are opening the options pane... the left (Column Name) should open the \"Column Options\" pane.. All set!. Different version (luckily!)\nWe can re-open if this is a problem on 6.4 too.... I've experienced this too \u2013 @rijkvanzanten, I know we spoke about this... what were your thoughts?. Is it for you or @WellingGuzman?. I'm getting this error after saving the WYSIWYG Full interface with no align/custom:\nError\nError: Uncaught TypeError: value.split is not a function\nFile: http://local.directus.com/app/core/interfaces/select/interface.js?bust=807d469c0fc1ed6ad5b27143a5ff68f1ec9cd35c\nLine:70. Haha, I have no idea how I got it... but it's gone now. I think I have a magical cache that refuses to be completely cleared despite my best efforts. Working perfectly now!. My assumption here is that you're using the status column and this is a \"soft-delete\"... is that correct? In that case I understand that this would technically be an update... though the system should treat it as a delete.. Thanks! I like the idea of purge instead of making an assumption about which event was intended for soft-delete. What do you think @WellingGuzman?. Hmm, Purge is more of an event/action... Trash is more of a noun. I say Purge. So, are these the options?\n\nBoth are considered delete but they come with a flag for soft/hard\nSoft Delete = remove & Hard Delete = delete. I like the flag approach \u2013 that seems cleaner. I think we should have a soft flag... no need to call it soft_delete because we're already in the delete event.. Perfect. Let's do this!. \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25. OK, let me know when I can test re-order/save for those.... THIS works (though there are other issues with this interface still, in other tickets). This Right Sidebar spacing issue is also happening on Settings>Groups too... again, it's based on previous page settings. This class (body.right-sidebar-open-wide) needs to be reset on EVERY page load to avoid this \u2013 the class should be added if the sidebar is open, and removed if it is closed.. Thanks @mycaravam \u2013 we're super busy (internally) with the 6.4 release right now but will get to this as soon as we have time! . This is a new feature/interface \u2013 so we'll follow our usual workflow process of submitting it for community review before integration. Therefore I've moved this over to FeatHub:\n\nhttp://feathub.com/directus/directus/+113. We can wait until after release for this \u2013 it is NOT super important.. > But we need to then show the Status column (if it exists) in the main content area (first).\nWe would ONLY hide this button for NEW items. And we would force the status interface in the main content area (the sidebar would never be shown on NEW items because there is no useful info there except Status).. @WellingGuzman \u2013 I understand why this is good for \"Save and Stay\", but is there any reason this switch would cause any issues?. Yeah, no rush. I like the method proposed here, or we could explicitly de-select after (which seems like it would still honor \"only save if there are changes\". Let's decide which of these ways is better and merge/implement.\nAny thoughts, @peremp?. Not sure why there are differences in what you two are seeing \u2013 cache issues?\nI am open to either solution... but I defer to Welling for which way we move forward with.. Works!\nBut the status checkboxes in the dropdown are NOT working still. No matter what you choose, all users are visible.\nAlso, we should update this table (directus_users) and the other system tables to use status instead of active.. We should not require the status column on junction tables \u2013 in fact, we should not even use them on junction tables... we should ALWAYS plan on hard-deleting junctions to avoid confusion.. You don't think that could get extremely confusing?\nThis Item: Published\nJunction Table: Draft\nRelated Item: Under-Review\nHow do we represent this in the M2M Interface? Is it draft or under-review?. That use case makes sense... but the interface in Directus needs a way to show the status of TWO things then: the related item and the junction relationship. So for now this needs to be figured out at the design-level.. I agree with this. Event over is important so we should make sure we finish processing before additional interaction. I'll plan on adding a blocker layer back into 6.4. That sounds perfect! Re-using that loading pane seems like the best option.\nThanks @peremp!. This has been updated in 6.4 \u2013 6.3.9 will be fixed by the PR above. Yeah, I agree!. @WellingGuzman \u2013 We can auto-generate through Directus. Does the token need to be required or could it be optional?. NULL/Optional or Auto-generated/Required.. either way works for me!. 1. We need to clean up the dropdown of users as you type the @mention\n2. We need to resolve the undefined undefined issue. Agree on all points. We will be focusing in other areas of the platform over the next 2 months \u2013 perhaps you would be interested in submitting a PR with these updates, @wittwerch?. The style has been updated, but we should remove the ability to mention groups and simplify the syntax to: @[1 Ben Haynes]. There is text in the comment input saying \"Press enter to submit\" \u2013 we could add a checkbox here so that users can toggle this functionality between:\n\n[x] Press enter to submit (Shift-Enter: new line)\n[ ] Press Enter to submit (Shift-Enter: submits). This is true \u2013 mostly the lack of a button was for visual simplicity, but that should not impede functionality. Since comments aren't editable we could switch this to a button.\n\nAlternatively, and perhaps this is more useful, would be to have the comments not be immutable. A pencil (edit) icon on the current user's comments would allow editing \u2013 which would be a great feature to add and partially solves the above learning curve issue.. I should have referenced it here, but I have finished the style and functionality of the comment submit button. This should be all set now on master!. OK, found it:\n{\n    0: {\n      name: 'Delete',\n      text_color: '#FFFFFF',\n      background_color: '#F44336',\n      subdued_in_listing: true,\n      show_listing_badge: true,\n      hidden_globally: true,\n      hard_delete: false,\n      published: false,\n      sort: 3\n    },\n    1: {\n      name: 'Active',\n      text_color: '#FFFFFF',\n      background_color: '#3498DB',\n      subdued_in_listing: false,\n      show_listing_badge: false,\n      hidden_globally: false,\n      hard_delete: false,\n      published: true,\n      sort: 1\n    },\n    2: {\n      name: 'Draft',\n      text_color: '#999999',\n      background_color: '#EEEEEE',\n      subdued_in_listing: true,\n      show_listing_badge: true,\n      hidden_globally: false,\n      hard_delete: false,\n      published: false,\n      sort: 2\n    }\n  }. A great point! The main question is how do we interact with this? Assuming it's global (and not per group as a permission) then it should be managed within Settings>Tables & Inputs.\nWe can add another icon column here to toggle the setting. But this will add visual noise and probably isn't a feature too many people will use. Also, what icon would we use to show this?\nWe could make the current visibility icon (eye) a four-way toggle similar to permissions. But this seems even messier.\nWe could remove the hidden_list option altogether, and have hidden_input be used for both.\nWe could leave it as is where it can only be edited in the database. But this doesn't help Hosted users who don't have direct DB access.\nWe could move this to the Permissions settings and have it managed by each group. But this is annoying if you want to change it globally \u2013 and adds visual noise to the permissions page.\nWhat do you guys think is best?. OK, so I think we should remove hidden_list and use hidden_input for both. \nI think that some M2M interfaces could be useful on the listing page: such as \"relational tags\" that show up. BUT, we need to add a way for the INTERFACE to force the columns not to be visible on listing.\nSo if you had an Interface that shouldn't be on listing (eg: a new M2M seating chart) then it can be disabled. This should/could ALSO be an Interface Option... so if the data isn't good for listing or the Admin user wants to turn it off, then it's done in the Interface Options globally.\nDoes this make sense? Can we all agree this is the simplest/best way?. No, we shouldn't hide it (unless the input is hidden). I think the best fallback/default is to show the count:\n21 Items (general)\n3 Files (if this is a file interface, or related table is directus_files)\nWe should be able to override this in the interface with a specific view though.... * Junction tables should be hidden by default\n* children table should be fake person names, or be called countries\nWhat is the difference between items and children? Curious why we need both.\nCould we add field comments describing each interface?\nIt takes a LONG time to load the Interface Listing view even though almost all the visible columns are non-relational. Shouldn't it only fetch the visible columns it needs to it's faster? (we can open a separate ticket for this)\nThis can wait, but when we have time I'd like to re-open this and add in dummy activity/comments for each item.\nLOTS of Interface ToDos... I'll keep those individual/separate\n. Also, the slug should be directly under the text-input so it's clear how that pulls from the other column.. All section break interfaces should have the same text: \"Section Break\". We can remove single_image since it's the same as single_file\nWe can remove multiple_image since it's the same as multiple_file. Fields should be named after their interfaces (eg: Many to One):\nItems\nItem\nItem Typeahead\n. Let's just call the tables: countries and items.\nOnce this and the other changes are made we can close this one.. A big one!. Thank you for reporting this @nithinga \u2013 which version/branch of Directus is this happening in? The screenshot looks like 6.4 \u2013 are you on the latest?. Also, if you refresh the page it doesn't save this change (the red delete permission). This is solved \u2013 if there are other issues we can re-open.. Thanks @nithinga \u2013 we appreciate you reporting this!\n@WellingGuzman (our lead developer) is away on vacation this week, but we'll catch-up on all of this in a few days when he's back. In the meantime, any information (steps to reproduce) would be invaluable.. Ahh, thanks! We'll see if we can find the root cause \u2013 if you come across it first just send over a PR! :). This was caused by this user's server config \u2013 we discussed on Slack.. I don't remember specifically what the issue was, do you @daddykom? I feel like it was an htaccess issue, but I could be mistaken.... Thanks for the quick reply @daddykom! Hopefully this continues to help people until we get a formal article written about it.. Hey @canyousayyes \u2013 we've closed the issue with forced strict naming through the API. We can't replicate the database defaulting to latin1... if you can help us reproduce this we'll re-open and resolve!. So how does it work now, @WellingGuzman?. I think we should add a comment to the Allow Messaging switch that says:\nMessaging also requires that this group has full permissions for `directus _messages` and `directus_recipients`. Though this is a fix, not a solution (thanks @rijkvanzanten). We should edit all of these features in ONE place (not two), so I recommend having the permissions determine if Messages will exist/function for a user group.\nFor example: if you have VIEW for directus_messages then you can see messages. If you have CREATE then you can send messages. The only concern here is that you would ALSO need access to directus_message_recipients.\nAny other thoughts on this?. OK, so I still think this needs to be based on the permissions. Let's REMOVE allow_messages and change to:\nIf you have VIEW for both:directus_messages && directus_message_recipients then you have access to Messages. But you need CREATE to send new messages, and EDIT to archive them. Let's spend the time to make this use the Permissions system properly.. This is a interesting point @nithinga. In your example, which way are you creating a new Book?\nTopics > Edit Topic > Create New Book\nor\nBooks > New Book. That is odd. So you have:\ntopics table\nbooks table with a M2O interface to assign each book to a topic\nWhen creating/editing a book you will save the primary key (eg: ID) from a topic into books.topic. The group permissions for this should be:\ntopics VIEW\nbooks CREATE, VIEW, EDIT, DELETE\nThe only issue I can imagine is because the M2O interface can have an optional \"Add New Item\" button... but if this is turned off then you shouldn't be getting a permission issue.\n@WellingGuzman @rijkvanzanten @nithinga \u2013 does this all make sense? Can we get a proof-of concept schema for testing/debugging this?. @WellingGuzman Any updates?. Kamino closed and cloned this issue to directus/directus-6-legacy. Hmm... Good question. I think on change, that way if they don't have the string masked (eg password) then they can see the hash. I think it would be better to have access to this on the client-side... other Interfaces might use it differently and need to encrypt before save.\nAs for this interface, I think we can either encrypt on keypress/blur and have it display below the input. Then when you save it saves the hashed value... so if you go back to edit the item later the plaintext value is gone.. I get it.\n\nUser adds plaintext string to input\nOn keypress, gets encrypted hash from backend\nInterface displays hash below input\nUser saves item/page\nHash is saved in column value\nUser views page \u2013 sees hash in the input. Exactly. Not on keypress, 500ms after keypress will avoid most calls.. This interface has been added into 6.4. You can choose your hashing algorithm and if you want the value masked.. This seems to be fixed now... \ud83d\udc7b . Assuming you are talking about directus_settings.thumbnail_size, I don't think we'll be changing this. That size (200) is the system thumbnail, and shouldn't really change. We may keep the quality option since that can be adjusted to alter the filesize on certain systems.\n\nThe main reason this is isn't a priority is because we have a full-featured thumbnail system in the works which should be complete/released in about 2 months. It will allow for more options/sizes and be dynamic.\nThank you for reporting this though, I'm happy to discuss further if you have questions!. Let's add a quick note in the FAQ section of the docs about this \u2013 then we can close it. Later, we can organize all these into the knowledgebase. . Hey @rijkvanzanten \u2013 let's add this as a FAQ item in the new marketing site, then we can close this one I think.. If it's a new install, I would just delete the existing tables in the database. Directus won't install over an existing version to avoid overwriting any of your previous system.\nIt looks like you did delete the tables, but you probably need to delete the generated config and configuration files within /api.\nEither way we're looking into this now! Thank you so much for reporting the problem!. Maybe I'm just OCD and want each user to have one. OK, that works. We'll keep it how it is. It's another security feature since not everyone gets a token by default.\nWe should also add a check sometime to make sure users can't accidentally add \"a\" to the field (or something equally simple) since then the API auth would be too easy to hack.. Thanks for reporting this one @peremp \u2013 we'll get this one fixed asap!. The first issue if fixed, but the relational fields are not showing data after saving:\n\n. Yeehaw!. Operator error. This was working the whole time \u2013 my mistake!. Hey @dsivokhin \u2013 this is by design. Though we can add an interface option to disable this. Here is the reasoning:\nLet's say this is managing tags (or something similar). If you need to query for a specific tag:\nSELECT * FROM vehicles WHERE tag = '%car%'\nThis will return results with car, cart, carriage, etc...\nSELECT * FROM vehicles WHERE tag = '%,car,%'\nThis will only return results with \"car\" but this only works if you have leading and trailing delimiters.. Thanks @JREAM \u2013 we'd love to close this if it's resolved, so let us know!. Any update @JREAM?. Since @WellingGuzman has fixed several issues and @JREAM hasn't responded in over a month I'll close this one. Please re-open if this is still an issue.. I think he means /settings/permissions/1 ... i get the error too. Hey @hybridvision \u2013 let us know about this one when you have a chance! Since it seems to be related to an older OS version we can't seem to replicate. I'm going to close this until we have specific OS/DB versions to reproduce \u2013\u00a0also, these versions should be new enough to warrant a fix ;). Hey @jdblack \u2013 if you have time, could you post a quick comment about this ticket's resolution? Especially given that @cesasol seems to be having a similar issue still.. That's OK \u2013 the intermittent bugs are the worst, but hopefully this was properly fixed by a commit or it was just some strange caching issue. We are still working on getting a Windows machine setup for testing \u2013 but will close this in the meantime since it's resolved.\nPlease reopen this ticket if it happens again or new information arises. Thank you!. We could comment those panels out for now... but I'd rather leave them in as a reminder of what's coming soon (eg: marketplace). Once we have critical bugs resolved we can slowly start turning these features on.. I know you would NEVER forget, Welling, but I'll reopen until those other points has fixes pushed. \ud83d\ude09. Hey @walkwizus \u2013 if you have a chance to test this commit that would be very helpful. I'd like to close this if it's resolved.\nThanks!. Hey @walkwizus \u2013 so that commit fixes the issue? Are all the problems within this ticket now resolved on your side?\nThanks for the help!. That would be great @walkwizus \u2013 you can send a full SQL dump and we'll recreate here, or access to the instance could work too. We really appreciate you taking the time to help us find/resolve this issue!. Hey @walkwizus \u2013 I'm sorry about the late response!\nWe would LOVE to discuss on Slack. A schema ( you can PM it to @WellingGuzman on Slack) would be super helpful in replicating and debugging the issue. Thanks again for the help with this!. Good catch! Thank you @UltraSimplified . It's been a few weeks and we are still unable to reproduce this issue. If anyone encounters it, please send us your server details, commit hash, and exact steps to reproduce.. Very interesting @diegogurpegui \u2013 is your full schema private or would you be able to share it with our developers via Slack? We haven't been able to replicate this issue as of yet so anything would help.\nAlso, was this a fresh install, or have you upgraded/migrated from an existing version?. Thanks @diegogurpegui \u2013 a schema structure would be great! @rijkvanzanten \u2013 any ideas on how we can replicate/solve this?. Is that the proper extension? Or is it .handlebars?. Thank you for drafting this up @wittwerch \u2013 everything but the nav override makes sense to me. Is this just a general feature request or is this something that you are interested in submitting a PR for? I see this change as an improvement \u2013 but one that would likely take some time and would almost certainly introduce many tangential changes/bugs.\nI'll try to start compiling a list of Group related things here:\n Send Messages: You can send messages to groups \u2013 no problem (conceptually) here though\n User Directory: Shows your group overlaying the avatar \u2013 not a big deal, but this would have to change\n* I'll try to think of others.... Hey @wittwerch \u2013 just checking in on this. Would this be something you would be interested in submitting a PR for? If not, we'll want to close this and move it to FeatHub since it's a feature request and not a bug.\nLet me know, and thanks for drafting this change!. Hey @wittwerch \u2013 let me know if you're thinking of creating a PR. In the meantime, I have migrated this to FeatHub so the community can vote for it alongside the other requests.\nhttp://feathub.com/directus/directus/+115. Hey @peremp \u2013 do you have time to give this a quick test?. What is the status of this? Could we check to see if these caching issues are persisting? @Zaelot @hybridvision @peremp \n@WellingGuzman \u2013 are there any other files we should stop from caching? We should make sure that this still allows for IMAGES to cache... so that the File Library doesn't load too slowly.. These caching issues should all be resolved based on the updates from Welling. Caches can be pretty sticky \u2013 so please remember to try other browsers and incognito to debug these issues.\nI'll close this as \"complete\" for now. Let us know if there are additional cache related issues that arise.. Hey @piupiupiu \u2013 we've been testing this one and are able to successfully create the DECIMAL column every time. Perhaps it's something to do with your configuration or server/sql setup? Any detailed logs or other info would be greatly appreciated.\nIn the meantime, we're going to close this one since it is working for multiple people following your exact steps. Please re-open if you submit more details/info. Thanks!. Hey @peremp \u2013 no one here is able to reproduce this one.\nCan you send over more detailed steps? Are you clicking the \"X\" to clear the filter or deleting the text manually? Do you have a schema we can try with?\nAlso, when you get the incorrectly filtered listing, could you check your user's directus_preferences for that table and paste it here? I wonder if this is actually a bug in the code or some weird caching issue.\nThanks!. If anyone is experiencing this issue please let us know (exact commit and steps to reproduce) \u2013 it should be easy to fix but we are unable to replicate the problem.\nIn the meantime, we're closing this because it's been a few weeks with no confirmation.. Hey @peremp \u2013 thanks for checking back in! We've had several issues persist due to cache... even after it's been cleared. Could you give it a try in a different browser or incognito just to be sure?\nAppreciate the help!. Any luck with a schema @peremp? It'd be great to squash this bug.... Also @peremp, a screencast might be good too so we can see exactly what you're seeing. Thank you very much for the help in getting this resolved!. OK \u2013 we'll close this as \"can not replicate\" until we hear back.. Hey @LiamMartens \u2013 if you have a chance, we'd love for you to test/confirm this fix on the develop branch. We believe this has already been fixed and would love to get the issue closed if that's the case.\nEither way, thanks for reporting this!. Hey @trk \u2013 you'd probably have better luck asking around our Slack for something like this. Our next marketing site will have a community page and we'll consider adding in a public forum there too.\nGitHub issues are reserved for bugs so I'm going to close this one.\n. These USED to be magic, along with sort for drag and drop, and id for the primary key. NOW (in 6.4) all these columns are dictated by their chosen interface. One of the hardcoded values must have been overlooked. \nWe're on it! \ud83d\ude09. Hey @jacobzeng \u2013 could you explain this a bit more?\ntotal_entries is the total number of items for the whole table, no filters\ntotal is the count of items returned by the request\nWhat is the attribute you are looking for? when you talk about 10 vs 14... is 10 limited or capped by pagination? If you could explain that difference we can look into this.. If I am correct, and you are sending a request with a LIMIT (or Pagination) and want the total results returned without the limit... I don't know if this is something we will implement. \nI realize it could be quite useful in some situations, but since Directus passes through these as actual SQL commands (including the limit), we would have to either change the core Directus logic (don't pass through SQL) or double the command (with and without the LIMIT):\n\n\nCore Codebase Change\nInstead of passing through the SQL command, SELECT all results without the LIMIT (to get the un-paginated count) and then manually offset the full-dataset to return. This is one query, but it would require a larger overhaul of how we access data.\n\n\nDouble Query\nWe can either run the same query twice (with and without the LIMIT) or we can create a custom SELECT using the command in the StackOverflow post below. This direction is not as performant, and it specific to MySQL (bad, because we're abstracted to start supporting Postgres and MS-SQL).\n\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/12887266/get-total-number-of-rows-when-using-limit\nI would recommend doing the \"double request\" within your app for now \u2013 then at least you can select specific places to have queries take a bit longer. Either way, happy to discuss further, but I'm going to close the ticket in the meantime. If you really feel that this is a good feature to add (despite the performance hit) then please submit it to our FeatHub:\nhttp://feathub.com/directus/directus. Thank you @dsivokhin for reporting this! We've resolved this issue in the commit above. We'll be pushing a patch release this evening to build... in the meantime you can pull that commit to fix the problem.. Just for reference \u2013 the new one is not 100% (shouldn't have \"X\", but I thought this would help):\n\n. He means: click the visibility \"eye\" icon two times, then try to edit the interface (open the modal) and he gets an error. He has a video on Slack that he can share.. @NextrekNet \u2013 we'll also need a little more detail. Could you tell us what page you go to to get the error? Do you have a schema (SQL dump) you can share? We have tables with the same name working fine on our side so we'll need more insight to get this fixed.\nThanks!. @WellingGuzman \u2013 Were you able to test on Maria?. Weird \u2013 I had cleared my cache many times, but now it's gone. Must have been sneaky cache!. Is it possible to not include the sidebar HTML for new items? Or to find a way to avoid the flicker?\nFlicker: When you load the page you see the sidebar on the right for a moment as it slides off the page. This is distracting and makes it seem like there's something over there you should be able to use/see.. Almost! Right now it increments from the max value in the whole directus_columns table... but it should only find the max from THIS table.\nExample:\nProjects\nid = 0\ntitle = 1\nimage = 2\ndate = 3\nArticles\nid = 0\ntitle = 9999\nurl = 9999\nIf I add a new column to Projects then it gets the sort order: 10000, but it should be 4. Hmm \u2013 I guess it will always \"work\" hahah. No one looks at the sort values so I guess this is fine. . If you want a default \u2013 add one.\nIf you want it required \u2013 make it required.\nFor allow_null and no default:\n With Placeholder: Save NULL\n No Placeholder: Save first value\nFor no allow_null and no default:\n With Placeholder: Save empty string\n No Placeholder: Save first value\nPlaceholder should be ON by default (Please select an option). This option should have the following option comment: The first value will be saved for new items if there no default or placeholder is used. A more detailed explanation should be added to the Docs along with this PR.. Fetty Wap thinks this is ready to go.... Hey @ngirardhg \u2013 I know you mentioned that the install went smoothly, but our devs seem to think this is a mod_rewrite issue. Could you confirm that this is working?. We should add this to our \"Installation FAQs\"!. Just to clarify:\nLeave default value untouched: NULL (true NULL)\nChange the default and then type \"NULL\" results in the string \"NULL\"\nWe can do one of two things:\n\nMake \"NULL\" always equal NULL... even if typed by the user. The only problem here is that \"NULL\" (string) can never be the default.\nAdd a checkbox beside the Default label to explicitly set it to NULL\n\nAny thoughts?\n . Hey @Sirjoseph94 \u2013 this is definitely just a configuration issue. How did you install? The build branch?. Are you using a caching service, such as CloudFlare? This would minify the templates, thereby breaking them. . I'm not sure what the specific issue/difference is with your setup, but if you disable the caching it should work. \nIf you're using CloudFlare try this:\n\nOk for anyone that is having issues with CloudFlare, if you create a rule disabling cache and performance, for the url it should fix your issues.. Hey @Sirjoseph94 \u2013 unfortunately no one here can replicate this issue. It seems to be caused by your caching or some other configuration issue. I'm going to mark this as Can Not Duplicate.\n\nIf you can provide more detailed server setup and steps to reproduce the issue we'd be happy to help.. We'll keep this open for a bit (for exposure) but unless we can duplicate it we'll close it. Since it's (most likely) not a Directus issue, I would recommend submitting something on StackOverflow for config/server help:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/search?q=directus. When I manually try to save the M2O options, I get the following error (and it doesn't save):\nError: Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded\nFile: http://local.directus.com/assets/js/libs/underscore.js?bust=2745c2e4d303d2c5ccad30ee1885e5747a805f8d\nLine:811\n\n. OK, it seems to create columns with the newest changes pulled \u2013 but saving options shows \"incomplete\" icon even when complete:\n\nBut it is gone when you refresh the page (until you edit again). Hey @peremp \u2013 any schema we can take a look at to reproduce? :). Thanks Dmitry \u2013 @WellingGuzman is aware of this and in the process of releasing a hotfix.. @MarcinKuder \u2013 could you provide a screenshot of your interface options?\n@rijkvanzanten \u2013 any idea why this wouldn't be working?. What else do we need to do here? Is this an edge-case with a specific/legacy browser? Can we write a conditional to solve it? Let's get this issue resolved, or if there is no resolution we should close it @rijkvanzanten.. So what are you thinking for this Rijk? If we can't duplicate, what are good next steps?. Good catch! We've been overhauling the interfaces and this must have been missed.\n@rijkvanzanten these sizes should be standardized across all interfaces so that small/medium/large represents the same max-width values and interfaces still align vertically. Some CSS edge-cases may be required for \"visual alignment\" if there is a more complex interface.. Thank you for these steps @awbranch \u2013 we were experiencing this before and @WellingGuzman had submitted a fix that resolved it... but it seems you've found a new way to find this issue.\nWe're on it!. @WellingGuzman Didn't you say you were working on this one? What is the status?. @WellingGuzman \u2013 any thoughts?. Hey @m-pire \u2013 you can access Directus content with the API (instead of the SDK). If you're trying to use the SDK, that's not a problem, but I think you're structuring things the wrong way. For example:\nWhat you're doing\n1. Installing Directus and trying to add the SDK INTO the same composer file.\nWhat you SHOULD do\n1. Install Directus\n2. Create a separate project (your \"app\") and install the Directus SDK there\nBasically your app (SDK) should be in its own directory, with its own composer file. You can't combine these two things together as you'll get many issues. For example, you can install Directus in  a directory \u2013\u00a0and then something like this in a separate directory:\nhttps://github.com/directus/webapp-example\nHope this helps!. Hello @jvmejias \u2013 I defer to @rijkvanzanten on these interface issues, but my understanding is this:\nThe new WYSIWYG Full interface parses the data it's given to meet the requirements of its output. This most likely differs from the way that rich content was managed in the previous (6.3.x) WYSIWYG editor. There are a few options:\n\nUpdate your content, refactoring as needed within your applications\nDuplicate and update the new WYSIWYG editor to fit your needs (Custom Interface)\nCopy the old WYSIWYG editor interface from 6.3.x into your new Directus instance\n\nLet me know your thoughts on all this! I understand that changes like this can be annoying, but our goal is to keep the framework moving forward while still supporting as many previous versions as possible.. Hey @jvmejias \u2013 Rijk agrees with my assessment. Since this can be solved to support your legacy content format I'm going to say this isn't a bug and won't be fixed. If others disagree we can certainly re-open!. @rijkvanzanten \u2013 can you respond with your thoughts on these points?. I'd say, the less automatic manipulation the better. Let's keep what the user entered and completely disable the conversion. No need to busy up the options with unnecessary edge cases. . Hey @peremp \u2013 any help replicating this would be appreciated! :).

Ahh, pagination is missing on the overlay listings (eg Choose Item)? @WellingGuzman, are these lazy-loading too?. \ud83d\udc4d . Hey @MartinMekhaiel \u2013 the revisions are stored in the directus_activity table for all changes, but we don't have a GUI for restoring previous deltas yet. You can request it over on FeatHub (as a new feature) and we'll definitely vote it up (we're excited to get this one too). Small team, so we have to prioritize these new features.\nhttps://feathub.com/directus/directus. I upvoted it! Let's get this to the top.... Technically this should be an issue on the Docs repo. Either way, we'll get some docs up for this soon.. I believe @WellingGuzman is working on this now (unless it's dot.notation for a different component). We'll update here soon.... Thank you so much @idelb!. Thanks @MartinMekhaiel \u2013 we're trying to keep all feature requests in FeatHub (soon to be our own tracking tool) so that the community can vote on what features to add next. Sorry, but with our limited resources we need to prioritize...\nhttps://feathub.com/directus/directus. It is in the very early R&D stages still, but we're hoping to have proper support in 4-6 months. Closing this as it's not an issue \u2013 if you'd like to expedite, you can submit PRs or garner support on our FeatHub:\nhttps://feathub.com/directus/directus/+68. Hey @wittwerch \u2013 first let me give a little background on this:\n\nFor security reasons, it is important to stay up to date with the newest versions of any software. Still, developers should be able to choose if and when they upgrade.\nThe other extremely important reason for this check is that it gives us a very basic (and anonymous) sense of Directus usage. Being a free and open-source project, we need a way to gauge how many people are actually using Directus. If that number gets too low, we would need to reduce our development/support. Our goal is to build a world-class framework that can benefit an increasing number of people \u2013 so we need to keep our costs/staff commensurate to the usage. Believe me, Directus is free... but not cheap.\nThat said, you can always adapt Directus remove this. We're trying to find a balance here \u2013 if it's too easy to remove then we have no insight into Directus \u2013 too difficult is annoying too. We're happy to discuss this on Slack \u2013 hopefully we can find a direction that most people are comfortable with.\n\nSecond, we're really trying to keep our issues/requests organized. Since this is technically a feature request, it should be logged at FeatHub so that our community can vote on it:\nhttps://feathub.com/directus/directus. Yeah, it was a tough decision to add this, but it's necessary for now. In the future we'll try to make it easier to disable \u2013 but for now a fork should do.. @adamjgrant \u2014 is this what you're looking for?\nhttps://docs.directus.io/api/reference.html#filter-relational. Maybe related to this ticket?\nhttps://github.com/directus/api/issues/784. The tour is a Feature Request... but this page should show the \"Nothing to see here\" message because it's empty (just like all other pages). So I'd call this a bug.. True!\nI agree, we should add the \"Nothing to see here\" on this page... we can add the \"New\" button too, but only for admins.. Kamino closed and cloned this issue to directus/directus-6-legacy. If it changes the response then we DON'T update the previous versions. Let's fix this (and everything else) and release it under 2.0. The problem is (as Welling Mentioned) that only one \"field\" on this page autosaves \u2013 albeit a very complicated one. So we can't remove the SAVE button because it's used for everything else on the page. I think the better option would be to (eventually) try to find a way to get these complex permissions/column-options to use the SAVE button too.\nWhile this is a nice improvement \u2013 it's a big can of worms and there are many higher priority items at the moment. In the meantime, we could add \"Saved\" notifications whenever you change those autosaving items.. @rijkvanzanten @WellingGuzman @airbenich \u2013 any thoughts on a good resolution for this? The notification is correct... and this is the result of a much more complex issue (saving for two sections of the CMS is instant).. Ahh, this was probably from when we were centering things. If everything will be left-aligned then we should be able to get rid of this! Rijk \u2013 would you do the honor?. Kamino closed and cloned this issue to directus/directus-6-legacy. The issue before was that items were on multiple pages, but now we use lazy-load/infinite-scroll. This script updates ALL items with a new incremental sort value, so it's pretty intensive for large quantities of records. So there are two options:\n\n\nUpdate the notification to say: There are too many items in this table to support reordering\n\n\nCheck if all items are loaded on the page and allow reordering.\n\n\n@WellingGuzman @parnas @rijkvanzanten \u2013 do you (or anyone else) have thoughts on this?. I mean, if we can think of a better way... great!\nThe key is, this needs to work with a basic SQL SORT. We could get into decimals, but that seems more convoluted and not good long term.. Presumably this would ONLY update the values that are currently filtered? Since the sort column is global, that could give unexpected results, but I see what you're saying.. This definitely works, the only issue is that it relies on the existing sort values being accurate and complete. So for instance, if something was added directly in the database, or a sort value was \"off\" for some reason, then issues could arise because at no point is everything \"reset\" (globally updated).\nStill, this direction is worth considering! What does everyone think?. True \u2013 but if there are a lot of NULLs or values that are the same for some reason, this won't do anything.. I'm not sure that we have a global locale/language right now \u2013 but if we don't we should add one into the Config or Global Settings. Then the default user locale and all character conversion (eg: slugs) should match the project default.\nI like having things like this in the config because changing them is a big deal with big consequences. BUT, for our Hosted platform that means that this is not editable (no server access). Thoughts?. It doesn't need to be in the config, my only concern is that if it's in the Global Settings that it's easier to change... but if it's changed then slugs may update and links could break. I'm fine with Global Settings though... we can add a warning note to the column.. Yeah \u2013 I think we should use Global Settings with a warning... MOST things should go into Settings (instead of the config) so that app users can manage things without server access.. Hey @BennerGe \u2013 any luck? We'd love to replicate this so we can fix/close. :). Fair enough. We can start to swap these out, but need to be careful not to break anything along the way. Many of the JS selectors use the element type to monitor events, so this could have adverse effects.. Kamino closed and cloned this issue to directus/directus-6-legacy. Kamino closed and cloned this issue to directus/directus-6-legacy. Good solution! It shouldn't be an issue, but remember that we're using that space for an \"important announcement\" for ALIAS interfaces/columns.. Kamino closed and cloned this issue to directus/directus-6-legacy. Needs documentation. @WellingGuzman . Hey @jvmejias \u2013 unfortunately we can't debug config issues here on GitHub. I'd say your best bet is to head over to our Slack and see if the community/developers can help: https://slack.getdirectus.com/. Kamino closed and cloned this issue to directus/directus-6-legacy. The issue here seems to be that you should be able to choose a default value when adding the column (just like in the actual database). Did you try adding a default when creating the new status column?. I still think that we should use the field default \u2013 which can (and should) be set up when creating the column. NULL is not a good default for this column... unless that's a status key for some weird reason.\nWe could go with using the first status in the mapping, but we already have defaults for this exact purpose, so that direction feels cleaner.. Kamino closed and cloned this issue to directus/directus-6-legacy. Also, does this happen even when using the limit and offset params?\nhttps://api.getdirectus.com/1.1/#Get_Files. Hello \u2013 as of now there is now way to show different interfaces to different users/groups within Core. However, you could simply extend your custom interface to check the current user's group/permission and show a different interface based on the value.\nI've never tried that, but it seems like an interesting approach! If you decide to give it a go let us know how it turns out! If that doesn't work you can always submit a feature request: https://request.getdirectus.com/. Correct. This \"conditional fields\" option has been discussed for quite a while. In order to add it into our workstream we need to get it to the top of https://request.getdirectus.com/\nThen we'll want to discuss the best way to standardize this type of field. In the meantime, you could always create a custom Interface that updates based on the value of a previous field. If that works well then maybe we can add it to the Core codebase.\nI'll close this for now since new features should go to the request tool. Thanks @neocafe!. Kamino closed and cloned this issue to directus/directus-6-legacy. OK, I think there is some confusion going on here, let me clear things up:\nSingle File Interface:\nRead Blacklist= false (the user should see the image in the interface if directus_files are read=true)\nWrite Blacklist = true (the upload/choose/url/remove buttons should be hidden/disabled)\nDirectus Files Table:\nRead/View = true (the user can see all files)\nCreate/Add = true (can upload images)\n@neocafe could you describe your situation in these terms so I can explain how it should be.\n.

The reason is that disabled users are inaccessible, and if you go to recreate or invite that user again it would fail. \nI think the best solution would be to warn that a user with that email already exists and that you will overwrite if you continue. \nI disagree with closing this ticket and moving it to the \"friendly errors\" ticket.

Kamino closed and cloned this issue to directus/directus-6-legacy. My opinion is that we should use the raw SVG as the thumbnail (not generating a bitmap version). The SVG \"thumbnail\" would need to be contained/centered within the thumb dimensions (eg: 200x200) and should not exceed a max filesize (to avoid overloading the page with some crazy blueprint or something).\nThe only issue I can think of is: do we copy the original file to the thumbs folder, or write SVG specific conditional to use the original for this mime type?. We store the filesize of all files in the DB, so if it's too big we can simply not return the SVG file and it would default to the type (SVG) instead of a thumbnail.\nI'm not too worried about someone hacking code into an SVG... we have accountability, so if someone did this it could easily be tracked back to them. Remember, this is a closed-system CMS that is intended for invite-only access. Not random/public people uploading things. If it's setup to allow external uploads, then the user's project application should do sanitization and file checking.\nIn my experience, almost all SVGs are very small in filesize (usually smaller than a bitmap equivalent). I still vote for returning the original SVG if the filesize is less than \"x\".. Kamino cloned this issue to directus/api. Kamino closed and cloned this issue to directus/directus-6-legacy.

Kamino closed and cloned this issue to directus/directus-6-legacy. I think we should 100% honor the permissions system \u2013 so if you want to enable Create access for directus_users for the Public group... then that should work as expected. \nAlso, I don't know if this matters, but perhaps it would be nice to have a specific \"Register User\" endpoint? Would that just be an alias helper, or would it be useful to combine the password hashing into a dedicated endpoint?\nLastly, we could discuss adding a KVP to Global Settings for a \"default user group\". We never thought about this since all User Registration was done explicitly... but it might be useful for registration (if we want to officially support that)..

Basically if you have items that you want to relate to itself, you create a junction table called items_related. So your schema would look like this:\n```\nitems\n id\n whatever field\n whatever field\n whatever field\nitems_related\n id\n item_a\n* item_b\n```\nThen you use the M2M interface to connect it all together (check out our Docs).

Hey @katokalen \u2013 since v7 was released a few days ago and is a significant departure from v6, we've decided to clean up our GitHub organization a bit. Over the next few weeks we'll be removing legacy repositories so that our users aren't confused between the two versions.\nI'll add the final zip of that repo here in case anyone needs access to it:\nWebApp Example Site (for Directus v6.x)\nwebapp-example-master.zip\n. Thanks @christiaangoossens \u2013 this one's my fault... the other devs warned me that I only had US timezones. \ud83d\ude2c \nI wasn't able to (quickly) find a good list of world timezones where there was only ONE in each timezone. Most had every major world city (way too many options). If you or anyone else can find a good list we will definitely update!\nI'll try to find a good one too... or make one.\nhttps://github.com/directus/api/blob/5939dd7423aff65b865b62ece75aed4884fa4f93/migrations/db/seeds/FieldsSeeder.php#L1101. I like the search + dropdown option for the extended list. Another thought would be to simply have a dropdown of the time offsets \u2013 would that also work? In this case the user would have to know their offset, (eg: +5) but it would be a far more simple solution.\nTo make this option a bit more intuitive we could show a list of most major cities (in that timezone) on hover/select.\nThoughts?. I've moved this ticket here:\nhttps://github.com/directus/app/issues/1041\nWe're removing the directus/directus issues to keep all in the main repos. Hey @christiaangoossens \u2013 let us know if that Roles interface is showing up for you on the User Detail page so we know if we can close this issue or not.\nAnd yes, ideally we would have waited for everything to be perfect before releasing, but as Rijk mentioned, we were getting zero feedback on the RCs and we have limited time, resources, staff for infinite testing. Hopefully we can get all these issues wrapped up quickly!. I just did a fresh install from the combined build version (7.0.1) and I do get the Roles interface (albeit in the wrong spot):\n\n. No one here is able to reproduce this on the latest version. How did you install? Did you use the App installer, CLI, or schema.sql file? We're trying to figure out why your boilerplate schema would be different.\nCould you give 7.0.2 a try with a fresh/blank database? We're pushing the migrations this Friday, but in the meantime the best way to test new versions is a fresh database install.. Which version are you using @christiaangoossens ? We just released a version last night that should resolve this. . Hey @christiaangoossens and @Mu9tafa-Online \u2013 just wanted to let you know that we figured this one out this morning. It was a problem with our default Apache .htaccess rules causing extensions to get intercepted by the API. Give it a try on the 7.0.4 release (coming out in a few minutes). Hi @dario30186 \u2013 let me try to answer your questions:\nDocker in v7 \u2013 Instead of a dedicated repo, Docker is now included in the main repos for version 7. \nDocs \u2013 Since we're a small team and have a LOT of things going on with this release, some things are a bit messy at the moment. We do have v6 docs and v7 docs, but they are not clearly delineated. Once we have the initial issues of v7 resolved we will be \"sunsetting\" our core support/repos for v6 and moving full-steam ahead for v7. Once that happens all docs will clearly point to v7 and we'll add notes to new features (eg Works in v7.0.12+). Please bear with us while we get things organized.\nHoooks \u2013 You can find the v6 Docs on Hooks here including all of the hooks you're looking for.. That would be a questions for @rijkvanzanten  \ud83d\ude2c . Hey @dario30186 \u2013 you'd need to open this in a new ticket so we can assign it to a developer. This would be an API question:\nhttps://github.com/directus/api/issues/new?template=Bug_report.md. Thanks @Joshua-Sherer-Bose! Wishful thinking that we'd have all of our domain shifts complete by now... this has been resolved! We'll update it back to the new link once it's working. \ud83d\ude04 . Kamino closed and cloned this issue to directus/directus-6-legacy. @rijkvanzanten \u2013 does the App honor the IP whitelist or does it send the server's IP to the API? If the latter, how can we reliably respect this restriction in the App?\n@WellingGuzman \u2013 can you confirm that the IP Whitelist is working as expected for the API directly?. So I guess this IP whitelist will have to be noted (in the Docs) as an API feature only. Some other alternatives:\n\nAdd a server-side file to the App that can access this info to enforce IP whitelist. This is a heavy-handed solution to a smaller problem, but could be a good \"option\" to have.\nInstead of adding the actual code, we could describe what the code needs to accomplish in the Docs. Then devs can add support for this feature by adding a file to the App themselves. Then we could manually add this to directus.app too.\nMake this work for the combined build only... or if App/API are on the same server. This seems like a good progressive enhancement for those that use a single server.\n\nThoughts? Any other options?\n. Hey @rijkvanzanten \u2013 that makes sense to me. This would be for blocking the entire App, not something specific within it. So hopefully there's a way for us to disable the App based on IP... which seems hopeful based on what @shoaibjdev said (different servers for App/API but still recording client IP).\nIn the meantime, @WellingGuzman can you please confirm that the API is blocking any non-whitelisted IP requests? . This has been moved to: https://github.com/directus/app/issues/1042\nWe'll be reserving this issues area for build bugs only.. I've moved this ticket to the API repo, we'll be closing all issues on directus/directus since it is just the \"combined build\".\nhttps://github.com/directus/api/issues/521. I assume from seeing backbone in the log, that you meant v6.4.9.\nI don't think there is any hard limit, but this could be due to the API getting hit so often with the \"update user\" queries that tell it who is logged in. I don't know if that error dump is showing the actual root cause error... but I might be wrong.. Ahh, in that case it does sound like there is a LIMIT 1000 being passed on one of the directus_users queries. I don't have time to look into this now, but a codebase search for 1000 or even LIMIT 1000 (the latter might not work if parameterized) should help find and increase that limit.. Awesome! Yeah, my guess is we added that to avoid the query from returning too many items and avoid pagination. If you don't see a slow-down I'd say up it to whatever you need!\nI'll close this since it's \"resolved\" and on v6. Glad we got it figured out!. I've corrected the @directus/app and @directus/api repo READMEs... I think this one (@directus/directus) is created from those. Right @rijkvanzanten ?. Directus uses the 403 status code when your user/role doesn't have access too... so it's not necessarily a directory issue.. Sorry... busy day. I finally had a chance to test your zip locally, and it's working fine for me (MAMP). I've outlined my exact steps below... maybe it'll help you figure out what's up!\n1. I downloaded your zip\n2. I created a database and imported your SQL dump\n3. I updated your api.php config which had different database credentials than my default MAMP. This might be the problem?\nYours\n'name' => 'directus_test',\n'username' => 'directus_test',\n'password' => 'directus_test',\nMine\n'name' => 'directus_test',\n'username' => 'root',\n'password' => 'root',\nSo maybe it would be good to double-check that  you can login to the DB with something like Sequel Pro. Here's is what mine looks like:\n\n4. I created a Virtual Host in MAMP\nMy MAMP virtual host was a basic setup: I set it to local.debug.com and pointed it to the /public directory. Then I saved MAMP (restarts servers) and went to local.debug.com/admin in Chrome... and got the login page.\n5. Updated User Creds\nThen I tried the default user creds (no luck)... so I updated them to the defaults:\n```\nadmin@example.com\n$2y$10$KgoMYdA3WeJsWHX7Ros9NOo89dOSrbFwmF5rurSjsndnD7Y/RjLbO\nThe above is a hash for password\n```\n6. Logged in... messed around... no issues!. Someone described their socket connection here: https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/2215#issuecomment-433776538\nI don't know much about sockets, so I haven't been able to write any Docs for them... if anyone wants to take a stab at it that'd be great!. Yaaassss, excellent sleuthing @shealavington!!! @WellingGuzman (API Lead) will be back tomorrow morning and can weigh in on the security side. Until then, it seems like we've figured out the root cause (the hardest part)!. Glad to hear that LAMP is working out... if you (or anyone else) discovers which MAMP settings are causing issues we'd love to know about them so we can add them to our Docs!. I have added a little more info about the App/API/Suite here. Next I'll be add/updating a contributor section.... We can make the repo read-only, but we'll probably have to \"undo\" that each time we want to release new versions. I'll archive it now (readonly) and we can test with 7.0.5 today.. So to make a repo readonly, we need to \"archive\" it. GitHub says this is more for:\n\nrepository isn\u2019t actively developed anymore and you don\u2019t want to accept additional contributions\n\nThis also doesn't allow for issues, etc. So i don't think we want to do this. Perhaps we just say something in the README?. Exactly. I wish they did it last week... when I manually migrated all the v6 in directus/directus to a legacy repo! :/\nBut yes, will be really helpful for moving tickets to where they belong!. I like that! But we'd lose the zip/tar ability for shared servers... and our precious \u2b50\ufe0f count on directus/directus \ud83d\ude09 . Ahh, that makes more sense!. How complicated is this to build?. A few more updates, but this should help clarify things a bit more:\nhttps://docs.directus.io/contributing.html#repositories. Haha, ask and you shall receive! I'd love to hear your thoughts on this @vzool !\nhttps://docs.directus.io/deploying-versions.html\nThe only thing that was updated (yesterday) was something to do with keeping the .gitignore files so that logs aren't tracked. @rijkvanzanten did that make it into the Doc? . That's correct, @anticz!. Thanks @rijkvanzanten! \nIf using a query param is an option that would potentially solve all of these related issues, I'd say it's 100% worth it. Is there a downside?\n@WellingGuzman \ud83d\udd14 . OK, so I've added a bit more context to the \"Deploying Versions\" Docs page: https://github.com/directus/docs/commit/d38e260ce1f757db8f001cd3be55f648de5196fd\nAlso, the new README file for each directory has an intro paragraph that I think helps clarify our three main repos.\n\nDirectus is an open-source suite of software for managing content in projects of any size. Instances of the Directus API allow you to easily connect SQL database content anywhere (websites, native apps, wearables, IoT devices, kiosks, etc) while the Directus App allows non-technical users to intuitively manage that content. You can easily install a build of the full Directus Suite which includes the App, API, and all dependencies.\n\nI''m going to close this one since I'm hoping the delineation is a bit clearer now... but I am happy to re-open if there are other suggestions to help new users understand the architecture.. I'm going to leave this open through the next release because it's a common mistake and not everyone will read through the Docs to understand what to do. Some potential solutions:\n\nUpdate the error message to explain where to go. Maybe this is only valid for combined installs?\nThis instance of the Directus API has not been configured. Install via the Directus App (eg: /admin) or read more about configuration at: https://docs.directus.io/install.html#configure\n\n\nRedirect root requests to /admin\nMove the admin app access to the root (I doubt this would work since it would conflict with the API). I agree. I can make make this change tomorrow.... Is it wrong though? I specifically wrote it as generally as possible to say:\n\nThis API is not installed yet, so...\n1. Use an App to install (for example, /admin)\n2. Otherwise do it manually (Docs)\nI was trying to use the eg as: Hey, try this because it might be where your app is. But you could use directus.app too, right? Any App should do.. Yeah, I can make it more descriptive... I was just trying to keep it shorter.\n\nThis Directus API instance has not been configured. Install using a Directus App (eg: https://directus.app) or, if using the Directus Suite, try adding /admin to this URL. Read more about configuration at: https://docs.directus.io/install.html#configure. There are a few known bugs with the translation interface that came up today... but I've drafted some initial Docs to explain setup:\n\nhttps://docs.directus.io/app/admin/relationships.html#translations. I like both of these ideas!\n\n\nI think the most important (non-relational) info we can show is how many translations have been saved, so 3/3 looks good! We won't know if the whole translation is \"complete\" (we're working on a different interface for that) but at least knowing that there's a record of each language is good.\n\n\nI really like the idea of having an option (not forcing it) to create the translation junction table for translations... or even all M2Ms. We might have a ticket for that already.\n\n\nThoughts on these two points, @rijkvanzanten ?. I know it's not translatable, but I like the idea of being able to say: {{count}} Languages for the templated interface output.. Thanks @andrejguran \u2013 what @shealavington mentioned it accurate, and we don't have any migration scripts planned. There's would be no reliable way to update settings programmatically since they are so different.  However I will write some general steps for upgrading from v6 to help understand this process.. Hopefully this helps anyone trying to upgrade. I wrote it pretty quickly so let me know if there is anything I missed and I'l add it.\nhttps://docs.directus.io/legacy-upgrades.html. Thanks for the input everyone \u2013 we'll get this sorted in the next few days.\n\ud83d\udd14 @rijkvanzanten @WellingGuzman . Hey @biofen \u2013 if the App is working then the issue is most likely just the URL you're using to access the API.\nIf your app is at:\nhttp://localhost/admin\nThen the API would be located at:\n```\nAPI\nhttp://localhost/server/ping\nDefault Project\nhttp://localhost/_/collections\nCustom Project\nhttp://localhost/custom-name/collections\n```\nI'll update the API Reference to be a little more clear about this directory. I'll close this since the App is working and I'm pretty confident this was just a URL misunderstanding... but let me know if it's still not working and we'll re-open and troubleshoot.. I had spoken with @WellingGuzman about this a few weeks ago. We were planning on dropping 5.6 support when it hit EOL in December. That said, I'm totally fine pulling the trigger a month early to avoid these unexpected issues.. Hey @jameswill \u2014 we've updated the Docs to let users know that we are only supporting PHP 7.1+ from this point on. Which is inline with PHP EOL in a few weeks:\nhttp://php.net/supported-versions.php. Also, we have weekly releases on Fridays... though sometimes (like this past Wednesday) we push hotfixes mid-week.. Hey @michaelbriordan \u2013 this is an important issue and one that we'd like to make sure is resolved, but @shealavington is right... we need a bit more info to properly debug this. Could you provide us with some steps to reproduce or a schema.sql file we can use to replicate?. I'll close this for now, @michaelbriordan feel free to post some more details on your setup so we can re-open and help out!. Also, just to clarify requirements: we recently dropped support for older versions of PHP (since they are hitting EOL in a few weeks) so Directus requires PHP 7.1+ now.. I'll close this one since the PHP version seems very likely to be the culprit... and the original issue should have included that info.\nAlso, I will be adding our GitHub Issue Bug Template to this repo now to avoid missing info in the future.. Hey @ybelenko \u2014 we have been struggling with OpenAPI/Swagger for a while, specifically with nested deepObjects used within our filtering parameters.\nGET /items/users?filter[category][eq]=vip\nWe would love to find an alternative that supports this syntax \u2014 do you know if OpenAPI Generator does?\nRef: https://docs.directus.io/api/reference.html#filtering. ## Looking for a Directus API Client?\nPlease consider \ud83d\udc4d this issue: https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/issues/1706\nAs soon as that ticket is resolved then we can generate Directus SDKs in all the popular languages!. No response in months \u2014 I'll close this now (no need to wait for stalebot.. Hello @christiaangoossens \u2014 I sympathize with your situation, but the reality is: free and open-source products don't have the resourcing to support what you're asking for. Therefore this burden falls to the community.\nWe have one full-time staff member (myself, unpaid, front-end only) and two part-time core developers that I personally pay just to keep the project alive. We can not offer any free support for obvious reasons, and paid support is only available for v7 since only one of our devs is even familiar with v6 (and his time is very limited).\nThe v6 Docs are available on GitHub, if someone from the community wants to generate a fancier web-version of those (eg: on Netlify) that would be awesome and we'll link to them. But markdown gets the job done and we simply don't have any free time for this enhancement unfortunately.\nVersion 6 was too complex to maintain, had a steep dev learning curve, and was difficult to upgrade. That is why we created version 7 \u2014 so that we could resolve all of those previous issues at once instead of letting the entire project die a slow death.\nIf you feel that Directus 7 isn't production ready, then my opinion is that it's better to invest time getting it stable instead of maintaining a legacy product. We only have time to do one or the other, not both.\nAlso, in addition to all the Directus work that you see publicly, we're also working behind the scenes on a Cloud service and Marketplace so that this project has the financial means to can stay active long-term. Again, this is all happening with a handful of dev hours per week.\nTLDR: Scope, Time, Cost... you can only choose two. If users need more scope, then they should plan on donating their Time or Money to the project.. Of course! It's an important point to bring up. The lifespan of a product is an important part of due diligence, so it is important to us to support users of Directus. This was actually the main focus of v7 development and it being versionless \u2014 to \"rip the bandaid off\" with breaking changes now so we could make all future upgrades much easier. From Directus 7 onward it will be easy to stay up to date \u2014 and we can support versions much longer.\nWe only took the old Docs website down because we ended up shifting all our domains/servers and didn't have time to port that one over too. And we will definitely review/merge any security PRs to v6.\nI'll keep this open for a bit since your question comes up quite a bit over Slack, Intercom, Email, etc.\nThanks for bringing it up!. I'm going to close this \u2014 but I'm leaving it pinned so other users can easily find it!. Thank you @josdea \u2014 still trying to find all the broken links after the new Docs structure. \ud83d\ude04 . Haha, eagle eye! \ud83e\udd85\nGood catch... just updated those too.. I believe I'm following what you're proposing \u2014\u00a0and it seems that this could be done entirely in the App (not API). It's a significant change, so let's discuss it a bit and if the core team (and community) agree we can start with some design mocks!\n@rijkvanzanten thoughts?. We'll probably want to open this on directus/api but if this fixes that annoying Thumbnailer issue that would be great! Thanks @rjwismar !. Hey @digitaltopo \u2014 thanks for providing so much info on this issue. Could you perhaps also add this:\nDevice: [eg: Desktop, iPhone6, etc]\nOS: [eg: MacOS 10.13.6, Windows 10.1803]\nAre you installing locally or on a webserver? Did you try pinging the API manually?\nCould you paste the two paths here (App and API)? To me this seems like an issue with setting the public directory because you said:\n\nAfter cloning the git repo, and visiting the ../public/admin url:\n\nYou shouldn't see the public in the URL if it's the root, so I want to make sure that's working as expected.. Thanks. Yes there is an htaccess file.\nManually creating the config won't fix this since that only configures the API... but your problem is that the App can't find the API. As I mentioned, this is likely due to the public redirect. If you have your server properly configured to point to the /public directory then your URLs would be:\n\nsub.domain.com/admin \u2014 Directus App used to manage all projects\nsub.domain.com \u2014 Base API Server\nsub.domain.com/_/ \u2014 API for the default project, the one using api.php\nsub.domain.com/server/ping \u2014 Server Ping endpoint to make sure you have the server routing working correctly (doesn't care about the specific project/config). If this is not working then the issue is almost certainly your document root.. Did you try updating the owner of your Directus directory? For example:\n\nsudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/directus\nhttps://docs.directus.io/advanced/requirements.html#permissions. @rijkvanzanten @WellingGuzman \u2014 do we want to add more specific permissions setup to our Docs? Anything we can improve in the Install Docs to make this more fool-proof?. Hey @kroawen \u2013 did Shea's recommendation work for you? I believe all of these datetimes are in UTC... but I might be wrong.\n@rijkvanzanten @WellingGuzman \u2014 should this be closed or transferred to App/API?. Hey @kroawen , Welling is looking for the field info found within directus_fields for publisher_date. Docs! https://docs.directus.io/guides/relationships.html#many-to-any\nFeature Request! https://github.com/directus/app/issues/712\nThis is technically possible, but I'd say we won't officially support it until we have the M2X relation/interface available to make this easier.\nYou're not doing anything wrong with your data model \u2014 that seems like the best way to approach this. \ud83d\ude04 . Hey @tassoman \u2014 agree, but the point of this repo is to offer a \"one-click\" combined build of Directus (including all dependencies). Users looking for a more customizable (or secure, in your words) installation should use the dedicated API/App repositories. The \"suite\" at directus/directus is more for convenience (eg: shared host users with no command line access).. @rijkvanzanten @WellingGuzman \u2014 can we get this figured out and added in for this week's release? Would there be any potential side effects?. Thanks @dev7ch \u2014 @WellingGuzman will review this as soon as he has time!. # This exists now! If you add additional fields to directus_users they will show up on the user page/form by default. . Ahh, the App doesn't show the Collections in the App, but you can add them manually in the database for now and it should work. Here is a ticket you can follow for when this will be possible within the App GUI:\nhttps://github.com/directus/app/issues/830. Thanks @tvld \u2014 we're removing those today to avoid confusion. Our Docker team/community is also going to be working on some Docker Docs to help clarify all of this!\nRef: https://github.com/directus/docker/issues/15. Hey @gnh1201 \u2014 did you setup the \"Listing View Preferences\"? That's exactly what that option is for \u2014 choosing the modal's layout/columns/sort/order/etc\n\nIn other news, we're working on a big refactor that will make this more intuitive \u2014\u00a0but please bear with us as we get that released (lots going on).. I'm going to close this one since it's not a bug... but will reference it here so we can track the UX issue:\nhttps://github.com/directus/app/issues/1254\nThanks for creating the detailed ticket!. If you used the installer then you would have set the email/password ... you wouldn't necessarily be using our defaults. Did you confirm that your document root is set to the /public directory?\nAlso, if you are using our defaults, I assume you used the correct email admin@example.com (with an \"a\") ... you posted here that you used admin@exemple.com (with an \"e\").. Gotcha \u2014 no problem!\nWould it be possible to (privately) share any log files and/or database dump with us? You can send it to us over Slack if there's private info: https://slack.getdirectus.com/\nThanks! I'd love to get this resolved for you!. I'll consider this one closed, let us know if there is additional info that would make this even clearer/easier!. Thanks @honzabilek4!\n@WellingGuzman \u2014 is this a duplicate?. Thanks again @dev7ch! This is known issue (dup of https://github.com/directus/app/issues/1242) ... but we'd love your opinion on that ticket!. Hey @dev7ch \u2014 thanks for the PR! You can see the conversation about why this file is tracked here:\nhttps://github.com/directus/directus/issues/2273. I think you're using the fields param incorrectly (I'm no expert though). To keep things simple, just try this first: ?fields=*.*.*\nThat should get all data three-levels deep. If that works then you can go to two-levels and then try to fetch the specific field.\nI'm certain that this works and you have a malformed query string, so I'll close this. If this really is a bug then we can re-open and resolve!. Hey @jameswill \u2014 I've added steps for manually upgrading here:\nhttps://docs.directus.io/guides/upgrading.html#manually-upgrading-ftp-installs\nHope that helps!. I like that! Looks like it doesn't need an API token, so this seems like a good way to showcase up-to-date versions.\n@rijkvanzanten @shealavington \u2014 should we open up a new feature request for this?. Thanks for this, @tipcircle \u2014 some great ideas in there.\nSince GitHub is our primary source of issue tracking and feature requests, we do need to keep this a bit more organized. Each feature request should be created as its own ticket so it can be individually voted on by the community, specific comments can be left regarding each, and we can close them when one is completed. Also, any questions should be asked on our Slack or StackOverflow. Lastly, if you don't see something in the Docs, give GitHub a search... many of these questions are in here already. :)\nThat said, I will respond to these here and then close this issue. If you have time, I'd love to see some of these added as individual tickets!\n\nUser Registration \u2014 https://github.com/directus/app/issues/788\nThat ticket has them assigned to a group, which can have any permissions you want\nCollections are extremely complex, having an option to duplicate them would be too problematic. In addition to basic settings, each collection has fields, interface options, and relationships. Some of those can't easily be duplicated (eg: relationships). We do have Field Duplication though... which is much easier and helps solve your problem.\nOnly admins can create collections, and admins have all permissions. Do you mean duplicate/create items? (database records) Items can be duplicated with \"save as copy\".\nYou can control what ITEMS a user can create with permissions.\nYou can not limit how many items a user can create... just if they can create or not.\nYou can set users to only see items created by users of their role.\nYou can publish items in the future by setting a date field and only fetching/displaying publish_date > NOW\nI think you can disable the comments, @rijkvanzanten ?. Thanks @wondergryphon \u2014 some really great ideas here! One issue that I foresee with the \"super-admins\": \n\nPresumably we would configure super-admins in a master \"parent\" database (seems we all agree on that). But by default these super-admins could only perform \"instance-level functions\" (eg: create/delete project, see instance details). They could also log into individual child projects to READ/VIEW... but would not be able to to make edits (as admins) unless they are also in directus_users for that project's database too.\nThe reason for this is that all project activity, comments, and accountability needs to know who performed the action, storing that info in directus_activity (related to the user's PK). If we're using a user's PK/ID from a different database (master) we would have conflicting keys, and even if using a UUID user key, I don't like the idea of relating to data in an entirely different database.\nI think we'd need to scope super-users to performing global instance actions and perhaps READ access to sub-projects... but might need to restrict any updates/activity unless they have a matching user within the project.\nDoes that make sense? Thoughts on this?. I like it. There would be no guarantee that those would stay in sync depending on the order you add projects and super-admins... but this could be an interface in the global Instance Settings.\nAs Rijk mentioned, we'll need an App GUI for Instance Settings in the root (/) where super-admins can manage the instance, and then we'd scope projects within that (/[project-name]). We could have a section of that master app interface that shows/manages which super admins are in which projects.\nEventually we could extend this to also manage \"normal\" users across all instances, but that can wait.. Thanks @mattwaler \u2014 we're looking into this now and will follow up here shortly.. Definitely \u2014 we're reaching out to DigitalOcean to get this added now. I suppose that's what betas are for!\nThank you very much for taking the time to report this. :). Thanks @jsprds!!. Hey @maartenvanbenthem \u2014 it seems like this is already an issue. Can you check out this other ticket and see if it's what you're looking for? If it's not I'll re-open this one...\nhttps://github.com/directus/api/issues/576. ",

UI is has a required field for visible_columns now... One we have the new Create New Column wizard this will now longer be an issue since it will ask for required settings when the column is created\n. i'm moving this to 6.1 since it's not critical for SS\n. We need to make it possible to inactivate extensions, right now they show up if they are dropped in the extensions folder\n. i like the idea of giving the option of a unique field to any column.\nmaybe we could add it to the column settings? next to 'required', 'primary' and 'hidden':\n\nthis could be achieved using MySQL constraints...\n. added a unique identifier to the table schema\n. this is most likely because of some modifications i did in the sync routine in order to solve #263. Will have a look!\n. Good catch @maxgsoulcycle !\nWe definitely need a way to define custom relational UI's.\nThere are some conceptual problems though. I'm gonna try to explain how things currently work...\nRight now many-one UI's operate on the MySql INT datatype. The one-many and many-many UI's are built on top of \"fake\" datatypes (ONETOMANY and MANYTOMANY). In the fake datatypes we can have custom properties like \"table_related\" and \"junction_key_right\" in the same way as MySQL types can have \"allow_null\" or \"length\". \nExample:\n...\n {\n    \"id\":\"many_to_one\",\n    \"column_name\":\"many_to_one\",\n    \"type\":\"INT\",\n    \"is_nullable\":\"YES\",\n    \"comment\":\"\",\n    \"sort\":20,\n    \"ui\":\"many_to_one\",\n    \"system\":false,\n    \"master\":false,\n    \"hidden_list\":false,\n    \"hidden_input\":false,\n    \"table_related\":\"options\",\n    \"required\":false,\n    \"is_writable\":true,\n    \"options\":{\n      \"id\":\"many_to_one\",\n      \"table_related\":\"options\",\n      \"use_radio_buttons\":\"0\",\n      \"visible_column\":\"title\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\":\"many_many\",\n    \"column_name\":\"many_many\",\n    \"type\":\"MANYTOMANY\",\n    \"is_nullable\":\"NO\",\n    \"comment\":\"many to many test\",\n    \"sort\":9999,\n    \"ui\":\"many_to_many\",\n    \"system\":false,\n    \"master\":false,\n    \"hidden_list\":false,\n    \"hidden_input\":false,\n    \"table_related\":\"cats\",\n    \"junction_table\":\"junction_table\",\n    \"junction_key_left\":\"ui_gallery_id\",\n    \"junction_key_right\":\"cat_id\",\n    \"required\":false,\n    \"is_writable\":true,\n    \"options\":{\n      \"id\":\"many_to_many\",\n      \"visible_columns\":\"title\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\":\"one_many\",\n    \"column_name\":\"one_many\",\n    \"type\":\"ONETOMANY\",\n    \"is_nullable\":\"NO\",\n    \"comment\":\"test relational\",\n    \"sort\":9999,\n    \"ui\":\"one_to_many\",\n    \"system\":false,\n    \"master\":false,\n    \"hidden_list\":false,\n    \"hidden_input\":false,\n    \"table_related\":\"foreign_table\",\n    \"junction_key_right\":\"related_id\",\n    \"required\":false,\n    \"is_writable\":true,\n    \"options\":{\n      \"id\":\"one_to_many\",\n      \"visible_columns\":\"title\"\n    }\n  }\nIn the many-many and and one-many datatypes the relationship is established when the \"fake\" column is created:\n\nFor the column with the \"fake\" datatype we can then have different kinds of UI's, including custom ones:\n\nSince the many-one UI rely on the INT datatype, a relational UI is just one of many options:\n\nBecause of this, the table_related is a part of the UI-settings:\n\nUI settings are written to the directus_ui table!\nDoes this make sense? \n. Not at the moment, but i think you have pointed out something important. we really need this, especially for custom relational UI's. i'm in the midst of sketching on it.\n. Will be handled by #314\n. #357 takes care of this\n. i removed this feature for now... moving the issue to 6.1\n. allow null on the instrucor_id column was missing!\n. #356 takes care of this\n. i will look for something compatible and lightweight...\n. #356 will take care of this\n. Maybe we can move this ticket to 6.1 once the basic \"scroll-top\" feature is implemented?\n. Messages >  Reading Message should be Messages > \"Subject\"\n. Limit the table to X items.\n. This relates to #363\n. I broke this issue out of #352 \n. Response:\n{\n  \"message\":\"Required column\\/ui metadata columns on table instructors lack values: table_related junction_key_right\"\n}\nStatus Code: 200\n. Inorder to keep this feature in SC we need to make it possible to configure default columns for the user table. \n. This would require a proper search solution. We should probably look into elastic search as a general way of indexing directus.\n. very good idea @freen \n. relates to #395\n. ",
    "WellingGuzman": "@benhaynes can you give more details into this one?\n. we can forget about that jquery plugn and use some native solutions such as: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia\n. @benhaynes I moved this into the current release. any thoughts?\n. any element that has a .contextual-date-updater class and data-date attribute including the date, a date that moment.js can understand, should update that element every 60 seconds.\nAlthough it should be a little bit smart, and update gradually, for example dates that are above 1hour it should update hourly. what about not including elements that are hidden or not visibles?\n. @benhaynes development branch, read my previous message on how it works. and let me know how it turns out.\n. this was done. closing it.\n. @benhaynes we've made something roughly that does this so far, should we keep this open until we optimize it or close it? or didn't it work as expected?\n. @benhaynes this got me thinking, not all columns/fields are actual columns, so right now you can drop a column but what if the column is not real? we should delete the references, even though the column doesn't exists.\n. This issue may has been due to cache. @Radiergummi did you clear the cache after you upgrade?. Is there any errors in api/logs?. Thanks @Radiergummi, we are working on clear all the session, and force the browser to get new assets after and upgrade.\nThanks for confirm, please if you see any more issues let us know.. @benhaynes I know this is old, but how is this should be working?\nEvery time the user \"GET request\" something it should save the last page it was on?\nRight now it's saving any time a route it's changed rather than request it's made to the server.\n. @benhaynes perfect! thanks.\n. I believe it's done, I checked for any reference to old db, and did a quick test and all the pages was working and there's not error. Having in mind that the Old DB object does not exists anymore.\nThere's no more reference to the old db.\n. @benhaynes  can you give me some explanation with this issue?\n. @benhaynes that's odd, I'd check this out again, I tested this one a lot, and the fallback list is like this.\n1. If there's a redirect uses redirect url\n2. if there's not redirect url, use last_page url.\n3. If there's not last_page use default page, \"users\"\nI'd take a look, again.\n. is this still happening, I tested Global Settings out, and nothing it's happening when it's empty and the image url and rows per page does fall back on a default value.\nis there some steps to follow up to produce this issue?\n. @benhaynes this still an issue, I turned strict mode on, and I'm always getting error, (on directus_activity) trying to insert null values on columns that does not accept null or does not have any default value to fallback on.\n. @benhaynes yes, I meant this ticket, at some point some numbers are converted to string, and make it difficult to compare.\n. @benhaynes Oh no, this hasn't been fixed yet. I only meant this ticket to keep on eye on this one as a results of having that type of error.\n. The issue here is far from Directus, PDO converts the number into string so it can store large number in php. one solution could be casting the string into numeric values, BUT the catch here is that the value is bigger than php can store it will be chopped, so that will be a worst result.\n. Hey @davidbwaters, did you have problem installing Directus on a shared hosting? strict mode will give you some issue working with Directus, but it should be less than when this ticket was open, can you elaborate more so we can help you install it (if possible).. Has anyone experienced errors when using Directus with strict mode enabled?\nIt has been a long way trying to solve this issue, we have improved and reduce all the errors this mode bring, hopefully finding the rest of the bugs will allow us to finally close this ticket for good.. I clearly didn't explain myself well,  when you trying to create a column with spaces it throw an error.\nI suggest using adding quote on tables and columns name on any sql query just to create anther secure/protection layer.\nfrom this: \nphp\n$sql = \"ALTER TABLE $tbl_name ADD COLUMN $column_name $data_type COMMENT '$comment'\";\nto this:\nphp\n$sql = \"ALTER TABLE `$tbl_name` ADD COLUMN `$column_name` $data_type COMMENT '$comment'\";\n. I did this way, because there is not way (correct me if I'm wrong) to listen to a key event on a view that does not have any form element focus on it.\nother way to this do is to attach to the gobal app variable which also has all the events attach too, is like this:\njs\n// on app.js\n_.extend(app, $(document));\n``` js\n//Changing from this:\n$(document).on('keydown', .bind(this.onKeydown, this));\n//To this:\napp.on('keydown', .bind(this.onKeydown, this));\n//Change from this:\n$(document).off('keydown', .bind(this.onKeydown, this));\n//To this:\napp.off('keydown', .bind(this.onKeydown, this));\n```\nAnd this way, no matter which object it can always listens to all $(document) events.\n. Well the default value it's 1, but here's the thing, I was working on this issue and I found out that if you do not specify the length, or just use the default values that is there, for example VARCHAR it ends up with a query like this:\nALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN username VARCHAR COMMENT ''\nNotice the missing length on varchar, this would throw an error, it's required to specify the length of a varchar.\nBut if you specify the length even though is one again, it would set the value and the error wont be shown.\nHere is a PR (#495) to the solution.\n. This is a devtools issue trying to find the file, we can either add the map file or just disable mapping javascript at all.\nyou can read more here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/18365316/1772076\n. In the PR #473 I added the map file so the error will disappear.\n. If there's more it would be added using the optimization label.\nClosed\n. it's suppose to be fixed, after we add the active column on each table.\nBut, it is also going to happen on any table that does not have the active column already added to it.\nSo I call it fixed. or Need to add active column on the tables that already exists on previous installation.\nclose issue?\n. Oh, I had not read you last message, before I open my PR.\nI'd take a look.\n. I'm going to open this, dont know what happen really probably when you merge the old code get removed. but this feature is not available on development.\nIf I'm misunderstanding this issue, you can clear my path and close this issue.\n. @benhaynes I merged this PR#634 now when the hidden_input is true on a column it would be hidden from the table listing. let me know if this is exactly what you were referring to with this issue.\n. @benhaynes correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe this used to work back when the page was auto reloaded the browser after a save, this would need extra tweak probably. But I'd take a look back to when this used to work so I'm sure what's the issue.\n. @benhaynes nevermind, it wasn't about the realoading.\n. @benhaynes can you explain to me this one?\n. This one was solved by PR #702 and Improved by PR #762 \n. The way it's handle is by checking if there's the string 'duplicate entry' in the error message, but for some reason on the server it does not return the complete message, I'm looking into another solution for it. Although I do not get the error on my local setup. \n. It's throwing the alert know, Zend DB was outdated, it's working on the server now.\nI'll close it, if this come up again, we reopen it.\n. Exactly @benhaynes \n. I've tried to replicate the issue but it works perfectly for me, it sort modules either already saved or new ones (added by creating or choosing a new one).\n. Thought the same thing, Checking for a relationship property in the column model would be a quick effective way.\n. This is a Slim issue apparently, do not know exactly if it is Slim fault directly, but the latest version 2.4.2 returns an 404 when there a query string on the url, now I downgrade to 2.0.0 and everything went back to normal. 2.0.0 was the version we were using the whole time.\n. oh my mistake, it's actually 2.2.0 the one we were using.\n. I downgraded to 2.2.0 on the development server. the issue is not showing up anymore.\n. I thought I tagged the PR with this issue, but yes, it actually fix this problem.\n. Does this still an Issue? I think I worked on this before.\n. @benhaynes I'm not getting any error, can you give a step by step on this one, and which table are you using?\nIs this happening on the development server?\n. This was solved, does this still happening to you @benhaynes ?\n. Finally got this error to pop up, this issue is related to issue #467 (Table disappear from list) It's happening because for some reason after saving the table gets removed from the collection, and therefore it says the table does not exists. I would take a look into this, so I can kill two birds with one stone.\n. Oh it was my bad that did not test it there just assuming it was directly related, but I fix it in this PR (#494).\nThe thing was that tables that wasn't valid to display, were deleted from the table list. so this is why this type of error came up.\nAnd that's why it was always directus_files as the missing table, all tables prefixed with directus_ were deleted from the list as well.\nI tested it both issues and are working fine.\n. Yes, I think that a better thing to do, as the user can decide to whether or not use a database prefix, or take action and clear the old database or keep using the current one or change to a different database.\nIn resume, let them know what's going on.\n. And I spelled the wrong word, as well. it's files that is spelled wrong.\n. @benhaynes Is this something it shouldn't happens or the problem is that is not setting both (big and normal) permission when it has to?\n. I'm wondering Is this going to be a global feature? or would it be a table specific feature. so far I'm working on this as a global feature so whether you can soft delete or hard delete.\n. There still some pending tasks\n- Update old delete to the new code. (there are some pending)\n- When trying to delete under harddelete permission I got [Group #1 User #1] Table bigdelete access forbidden on tablearts(no magic owner column). I would like to understand better what's going on in here: AclAwareTableGateway.php#L496\n\n- Move the function to change status or delete to the backbone extend model. we discuss here: #548\n. I have a question on this, what happens if the table does not have owner all the users won't have BIG permission, so is this error ok?\n. I know, but when I pull down this commit (624a4d) the problem start and I get draft as default, but not only that, but when I change the status to active and click save, I get this message:\n\nAlthough I made this  PR #504, you can check it out and give me a feedback.\nthe issue is that when you filter, it returns a new array, thus, new array index. \ncc. @jel-massih \n. no, this problem was solved this PR#504 and then fixed again with #535.\n. It seems PR #680 also fixes this. because it's working.\n. @benhaynes I found it, it has that option but like you said it wasn't implemented, in the PR #531 implement the restriction by checking only the mime type.\nbut this would trigger a undesired behavior when it's the correct mime type for not the correct extension. so the file wont be served as the correct type.\n. This issue it's resolved, it only allow images as avatar, and also implements the single ui restriction type.\n. This was solved by #790\nThere's not actually header (content), but can also be included if necessary. \n. I found the issue, the api saves all the activity on GMT timezone, so most of these dates are ahead of the local time, all the activities I am doing right now (Dec 10th, 2014) are stored in the database with next day date (Dec 11th, 2014).\nI think would be best to use local server time instead of convert it to GMT time.\n. @benhaynes I opened another issue also related to this. #518\n. That's right this has happening to me a lot, I thought it was issue with my mouse or something.\nI'd take a look into this.\n. Would this:\njson\n{\n    \"Office\": {\n        \"About\": {\n            \"path\": \"/about\"\n        },\n        \"Events\": {\n            \"path\": \"/about\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"Work\": {\n        \"Case Studios\": {\n            \"path\": \"/case-studies\"\n        },\n        \"Press\": {\n            \"path\": \"/press\"\n        }\n    }\n}\nTurn into:\n\n. This PR, creates the new table column named nav_override, replacing tab with nav is in process, I would wait until DB Changes is done, then change all the code naming with nav instead of tab\n. @benhaynes oh I'm working on all at the same time that I don't know at what point this got wrong... I sent a PR #622\n. Well it was resolved, now I can only see activity from the current item.\n. @benhaynes I'll close this one, I've experienced this warning anymore. I'll reopen if it happens again.\n. @benhaynes Oh, you're right, so, after you add permission (view at least) it should be moved into the sidebar.\nI'll work on that.\n. @benhaynes I really didn't work on removing it after view has being off, it slipped my mind, I could work on that, if it's a serious issue, or something you think it really need to be implemented as soon as possible. let me know.\n. @benhaynes also when you switch hidden on/off.\n. @benhaynes I made a PR (#561) and when there's not /media directory or is not writable it put a message under the installation summary above the config message when there's not permission.\n\n. I was taking a deep look into this and the thing here is the actual \"delete\" (soft delete) is an update changing the status value, so if you have edit permission you can \"delete\" (soft delete). so that why I could end up deleting items in a table where I didn't have any delete permission.\nso should we check for delete permission on this edit only, instead of edit permission?\n. This is already done, with the new hard delete feature.\n. Yes, it's what actually happens, but as it a special EDIT permission on a single field I think it's better way to be handle by the DELETE permission. we can change back this to the previous edit, if you believe this is wrong or it's better to do it with the EDIT permission.\nI see it this way, without knowing how it works behind the scene, when you give the wrong user a edit permission without knowing it can hide from that data. but maybe it just me.\nso should we take this change back?\n. This is done.\n. What you think about this @benhaynes ?\n. I do not what happen there, but I'm testing it right now and it does exactly as you said it should behave.\n- When I click the row it auto select the file\n- Can only select one item on Single UI\n- Can select multiple items on Multiple Files\nI haven't tested the UI restriction, because right now I don't know where's that option, I would check later to see where is it and let you know, but the others are working fine, in my local repository.\nTry again if still happen Let's see what we can do.\n. For an Odd reason I had a version with was part updated, but anyway the issue with this wasn't that you cannot select the image it was an missing part of the file verification method. \nI tested and it works and it should work after this PR.\n. I was thinking about how could be a best or better way to handle this, every time there were a change in the DB Schema, and that new change wasn't applied to the dev server and because it was missing it start throwing error.\nOne way that pop out of my head right now are, DB Update files. But I'd try them out first and let you know how it ends up.\n. So I was looking on how to keep track to the DB Schema and really good solutions it's to use Migrations.\nI found on alternative for PHP called Ruckusing. I haven't tested yet, but I would do it later but I have used migrations in Ruby and it does do the job, so this is the idea we need to implement.\n. @benhaynes this first implementation it's looking pretty great, I haven't had any issue so far.\nI believe we should close this issue? any thoughts?\n. @benhaynes does this still happening? I can access tables that are missing from the directus_tables and I can still see the page with no error, either in settings and listing.\n. @benhaynes  This is awkward, I don't remember exactly why the title, is a bit of confusing, but what I meant, is that a user on delete permission, is allowed to delete all items regardless of being created by that user or not.\nNow what you tried to say, what you mean because now I'm curious about ask for the owner column.\n. @benhaynes I think this is a great idea, would it be great to use #892 also on this one? as a popover?\n. This going to be hard, and probably unnecessary.\nlet's pospone.\n. Exactly in a Input on a edit page, it submits the form, but as right now we are not handling submit, sot it wont do nothing rather than reload the page.\n. will remain closed, in case another similar issue occur I'll open it.\n. It should always have alter permission?\n. Hey @Zaelot Where is the sorting happening? on the interface or table or api?. The problem still that it will translate to a string so it won't be sorted properly as you should expect, We are going to check this issue and get it resolved in some way or another.\ncan you provide a steps on that ticket, or create a new one specifying all the steps logs, screenshot, etc. \nThanks. We prevent initial sorting, as the api returns the values sorted. we may need to prevent sorting from fetch. that's a topic for future release where we are really going to focus on performance.\nClosing it, and this should take place in another ticket.. It was actually that, the number being returned as a string.\nI did what you wrote and when I convert the sort column to string the sorting stay the same.\nIf for some reason the random sorted happens again let me know how it was trigger, but we should be good to go with this one.\nSolving the string as date and we all done with sorting by now.\n. I fixed the issue, in PR#600\n. I was on the Dinning page, but that's the point is trying to get an non-existing column, don't know why yet why is this happening and how because it's random. I'd take a deep look later and fix it.\n. I did this for now, I added all the AWS/Rackspace dependencies but it would be ignored, I thought putting under require-dev but it would need extra options to ignore it, we can jump into this later on.\nhttps://github.com/RNGR/directus6/pull/616/files\n. When the column can't be null, it would be automatically required, what could be a better way t handle this? let the be like this or if it's not required and it's a M2M column, not bother if it's nullify or not, because we store it in tables rows, not in single column.\nWhat do you think @benhaynes ?\n. @benhaynes while working on this I think messages polling should be called notification polling, so it would be more easy to handle whether is a new message, fetching a specific message or just getting info about whether is there a new message or not.\nThis would also help if in the future there would be any other type of notification implemented.\n. @benhaynes exactly, I'm talking about keep thing as they are but the polling system need to be moved to a new object that only handles polling, and by means it would include new messages which would trigger the Notification showing a \"notification\" of the new message.\nIn other word anything that is coming from that object you know is polling for notification activities, which I believe as right now are only message, in the future could be more.\nWhat do you think?\n. @benhaynes Everything would work as it's working now, just the object that listen and trigger the event alerting there's new message would be a new one.\n. @benhaynes there's not new ticket open referencing the commented above, we can keep this open, until the notification object is implemented. \n. Closed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/12c6955fb296caaab80f86e0b89dd92aa1b02dd4. @benhaynes Because json_decode does not throw error, it would work using try, so I used @ in case of any warning and json_last_error and it work good.\n. @benhaynes about directus_storage_adapters this is a little bit extra code, but we can create a php code that runs after we git push to production, and there we can update table with default values or something else.\nBut first, when you deploy to production how do the files and directories are pushed to the production server? via git or ftp or something else?\nI'm still reading more about this so I could give some ideas about the table to JSON subject.\n. @benhaynes I have to ask first, does this need to be fixed? I do not see the point to treat this differently, both url should act as the same.\n. Thanks, but this PR would be pointless, because we are not using this class anymore.\n. @benhaynes this also was fixed already. Does this still happening to you?\n. @benhaynes I submitted a PR #647 \n. @benhaynes let me work something out for this one.\n. @benhaynes is the flashRow not working for you? can you give me a step by step where it does not trigger for you?\n. @benhaynes Oh, you are right, Thanks for pointing that out, I tested it again, and it does flash the row. but at the same time, after the item is saved, not when you go back from the item, the list re render and the flash goes away at that time.\nI'd work on something here.\n. Issue: #649\n. This two PR #661 #665 would fixed/implemented this issue. although the ip being the same I think it because the VPN, the same way when you it used on localhost.\n. @benhaynes like you said this is going to be easy to organize just adding a new field to the table, and then we can parse and format our files list into folder with no trouble.\nIn the front then it would be a bit of more time since we have to handle and specify if the row is directory or a file, or in other word the heavy lifting but at the end it shouldn't not hassle just time consuming.\n. @benhaynes let's chat about this when it's possible I didn't think this well through, so now I got some questions. \n. @benhaynes yes we can close it, this was the only one. (at least the only one I experienced) so we should be good.\n. @benhaynes cool then, for now it would be ALWAYS ON for any numeric field. Working on it.\n. I'll close it, later when we want to implement it by field level, or similar, we can reopen it.\nAny thoughts @benhaynes ?\n. @benhaynes you want it to be separate like, having a space between the footer and the last row?\n. @benhaynes This still on the table but looks like it's out of the table.\nWhat do you think?\n\n. Hey @benhaynes, now I'm seeing this on M2M UI table.\n\nI'm checking why is this appearing on a non-numeric column. But my question is, is this footer also need to be visible on M2M UI  table as well?\n. @benhaynes we should be good now. closing it.\n. @benhaynes deleting (soft/hard) it's always granted no matter what, admin only?\n. @benhaynes Hey, are we still on with this one? or should we close this?\n. This has been implemented: 1.3 Vagrant box [DRAFT]\nI'll close it.\n. Hey @kesal, @cherryade I would like to know if this happened before or after logged in?\n. @cherryade Would you mind removing cookies from that domain, and let me know if that would fix it for you.\nI've experienced this before, and It was related to cookies.\nBut just after the installation is finish, it must redirect to to the login page. I would test it out?\nBy the way which branch did you use?\n. ok, I'm going to install Directus into another machine, to see how it goes.\nThanks for letting us know.\n. What is you DIRECTUS_PATH value in the config.php file?\nI'm trying to find the solution to this one, but I can't replicate the problem.\n. Great that you the issue is solved. @kesal do you still having issue with redirection loop?\nThis issue it seems to be related with this #719 #720 which seems to be related with permissions.\nThe query seems ok, does the user you are logged in has the permission to create tables?\n. @cherryade Thanks for the suggestions.\nI would take a look why directus_privileges didn't add that column on installation?\nI'd close this as it seems that your problem is already fixed.\n. @benhaynes you right, we should do that, but before I did all the we need to talk about how this is all going to be handle so we do not need to do twice the work. editing the value twice.\n. @benhaynes the issue was resolved on development branch also this, and it hasn't been merged yet. also we need to merge development with master to fix this and other issues. \nI almost certainly sure that @tjmb is using the master branch.\nRight now what you can do it's switch to development branch to fix this or wait for us to merge the development branch to master.\n. @tjmb great, hope it helps. Let us know.\nOtherwise We'd be merging the development branch with master branch soon.\n. @benhaynes NOTE: This also happen with any nav item under System.\n. I found a scenario when this is happening, php_value is only available on mod_php. Resulting in a 500 error page in other PHP mode setup.\nPR#725\n. Should we close this one and keep an eye #154 ?\n. This issue is not happening anymore to me, can you check it was fixed to you along the way, or maybe can you remember which version were you using?\n. oh I see, I was hoping this was handle internally automatically, but no. I submited a PR #735.\n. This was already fixed.\n@benhaynes is this still happening to you?\n. Sorry for the late reply @yeahlo \nThere's a lot of thing going on in why it's missing, one of then it's that we are offering a build (branch) which give the Directus ready to use with the directory created. we get to the conclusion we need to provide the directory anyway, because on installation it's configuring as the default media directory.\nSo as right now, the media directory is included and you don't need to create it manually.\nThanks!\n. This was fixed with #747.\n@benhaynes we surely needs to find a global solutions to trailing slashes or just, keeping working that way for awhile, is not that urgent issue.\n. @krisatkinson, @mariusz-kraj We are working on it, we'll soon added the equivalent config files for nginx.\nThanks for the concern. :+1: \n. @krisatkinson @mariusz-kraj we worked on a draft wiki where you can find here 1.2 Nginx Configuration [DRAFT], this would guide you to configure nginx to run Directus 6.\nI'll close this ticket, if you find any issue after using the configuration that is on the wiki, do not hesitate in opening a new ticket.\nThanks!\n. And I forgot to update this later on, and i forget what I was talking about.\n@benhaynes remember any of this?\nI will look into it.\n. I got it, on directus_columns the field data_type can be the ui name, but it should actually be the actual field data_type, such as INT or VARCHAR.\n. Soooo, this is also done, all column stored their data type, except alias should stored ALIAS.. @benhaynes Do we want to delete users from the listing? or this is too much?\n. @benhaynes any user users regardless of group? I believe it will be best too only see your current group users details. what do you think?\n. @benhaynes now that's better Idea, maybe we should do that by default. I have more ideas to bring to this, but I wont think much so we don't get sidetracked.\n\nIn case I forgot, in case you want to open a Group that doesn't need to know there are more groups or who are in the other groups. A group that can see other group information too.\n.

Hello @PavlusTravel,\nCan you provide more info, your server setup, the rest of the pre-installation check, which branch are you trying to install? is it mod_write enabled?\nWhat exactly happens? after you click install, it just send you back to the same page?\nThanks for letting us know.\n. @PavlusTravel Yeah, I see your problem we are using apache functions, and you (server) are using Fast/CGI instead. so there's not apache functions or mod_rewrite enabled on your server.\nWe are working on this issue, but as right now, we need Apache and mod_rewrite enabled, that's why the page stops there, because it throws and error regarding an apache functions that does not exists, but the errors are hidden.\nThanks for letting us know that, We will work on this one.\n. This was resolved by #758 soon on master branch.\n. Glad you install Directus correctly.\nthe issue with php_value it has been fixed in the development branch. So it would be available soon in the master branch.\nThanks.\n. This was resolved by #772 \n. I know there is a setting that enforce this, but if there's nothing or it's empty it does allow the user to upload anything, and after this is not directus problem, it's the server problem, so we need to tell nginx/apache to avoid users to run scripts that exists on the media directory.\n. We can control those settings via htaccess and nginx config, but I still wondering if we should implement some global blacklisted files or something similar, I do not see the point one would like to upload a script to the public that can be easily runnable. or we can just use htaccess/nginx. (well nginx the user has to do it by itself on the server)\n. PR #1026 Should do the trick now, closing this.\n. @benhaynes I know what's the problem, some request to the API are being called without nonce, so the API wont allow this on production environment.\nI'm working on it, I just do not know the right way to implement this without forcing it.\n. This one was resolved. I'll close it.\n. I was thinking of adding a new field on directus_groups, but I've been thinking a lot about how permissions/groups going to be handle, and I was thinking whether or not call a group to be \"admin\" or not, rather than this group has permission to this or it doesn't.\nBut again we need a \"superadmin\" which won't be group_id = 1 and we can take this from the group name which should be unique now, and it's the user belongsTo('Administrator'), it's an admin (superadmin).\nWhat do you think? right now for permissions-related and All about one field with a json/array.\n. By admin I meant what you just said:\nAn user with abilities to:\nadd/edit/delete any user\nAccess settings (including adjusting permissions, also create tables and fields)\n\nAll of this could be handled by our existing permissions:\nadd/big-edit/big-delete on directus_users\nadd/big-edit/big-delete on directus_settings, directus_permissions, etc\n\nSo here what if an user has listed=0, so this way the Users nav wont show up, same with settings and activity?\n\nBut what happens if a group only has partial permissions for settings? Would they not see the settings \"gear\" icon?\n\nas long as it has permission to view => directus_ui  the gear icon (next to the field right?) should be there, what can't be done (inside the settings of a field) is what it doesn't have permission to, (which boil down to add and edit, which)\n\nWhat is \"super-admin\" for? What can they do beyond the above?\n\nBy \"super-admin\" I was thinking about a group which do the same as admin, but a Group with permission to delete user, can't delete \"super-admin\" group, I don't know if this is going to far, but just was a thinking.\n\nDo you think permissions in JSON is better than the fields I mentioned in my last email?\n\nI mean, I like the idea of having a field for each, so we get close to 1=1 with tables, so we can see directus_privileges table and know it has view, add, edit fields and it could be easy to update the permission via Directus.\nI just find that in term of updating/extending to more permissions, etc. this would be easier with json, but would be hard to edit this value directly via edit table without the implementation of JSON editor UI but again, we are going to mange this via Settings > Permissions.\nI was thinking something like this.\n```\n{\n    \"group_id\": 1,\n    \"table_name\" : \"directus_users\",\n    \"status_id\": 1,\n    \"read_field_blacklist\": \"\",\n    \"write_field_blacklist\": \"\",\n    \"permissions\" : {\n        \"listed\" : 1,\n        \"view\" : 1,\n        \"add\"   : 1,\n        \"edit\" : 1,\n        \"delete\": 1,\n        \"alter\": 1,\n    }\n}\n// 0=deny, 1=allow, 2=big-allow, 3=hard-allow, 4=big-hard-allow\n```\nso let's say we want to implement (very risky) but just as an example, drop permission, which let user to drop tables, we don't need to add a new table for it, neither create a new migration which alter the table group, we just need to add a default value to drop=false and we are good to go.\n@benhaynes what do you think?\n. @benhaynes I'm sorry If I wasn't clear, but I wasn't talking about implementing a new user roles system, just not depending on group_id to know if the user is admin or not.\nYou are right, about the superadmin is a overkill.\nbut I think we can close this, as we are not going to keep it simple by now. And we can re-peon it later.\nWhat do you think?\n. @benhaynes so I think we agreed on add show_settings + allow_alter as combination of a \"Admin\", right?\n. Agreed! :+1: \n. Thanks @su-xiaolin, but this was solved already here\nWe should be merging development into master real soon.\n. Hey @aglayamajmunic I already merged, development branch to master, this issue was solved weeks ago, but we haven't had merge the branch yet.\nNow you shouldn't be experiencing this issue.\nThanks, I'd close it, if this happen again let us know.\n. ## TODO's\n- [ ] Multiple Adapter configuration\n- [ ] Better object wrapper structure\n- [ ] Easy way to add more adapter with little code\n. We need to first clean all the remaining reference to the old directus_adapter_storage table.\n. I submitted an PR #812, but this solve half of the problem. we need to find a work around when the file is not saved, so my idea is to not create a temp file, as far as I know this is only being create to show a preview, we can implement FileReader (This won't work on older browser) or we can also return the data of the thumbnail image, don't know how great/bad this idea could be, regarding of more data to be returned. I'd give both a try and see what the best choice.\n. @benhaynes the only reason the temp directory exists there is just to upload the file there in order to create a url to point to the file and show the preview on the file ui, so after this is done, the image should be be deleted.\nI see the advantage of removing the step of uploading the file just to display a preview, we can save the process of uploading a file just to display a preview leading us to a dangling file.\nBut the disadvantage is that when there's not support for FileReader there would be no file preview (but that's ok, that probably what they get for having a old browser hehe), but for real. I think would be a good fallback to show the file name instead of the preview and would be ok, just like any other type of file.\nany thoughts?\n. @benhaynes I believe this could be solve like that, when we open a overlay we should push a history state, silently, we can see if we can push the same, OR pushing a fake one but without reflecting the url, or using hash.\nHopefully this would solve this request/issue?. Closed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/78e4cc831ce80a0863999038c3e95d89d047bab7. @benhaynes now I'm wondering what's the different between unlisted and hidden?\n. unlisted is part of groups/directus_privileges and hidden part of directus_tables.\nWe can update the hidden property on the Table Settings, but we can't modify the unlisted property on User Permission settings.\n. @benhaynes You are right about having hidden as a table system-wide, but is there some other situation where a table need to be hidden to everyone, besides all junction tables?\nWhat if  it's installed into a shared database and there a bunch of unrelated tables, that where should hidden be handy? it wouldn't be to update each group to unlisted those tables.\n. Side note: Also we should filter all the tables in one place, the SchemaManager so it doesn't matter the place we are trying to pull the tables, the manager will filter there.\n. Also we have tab_blacklist (nav_blacklist) which also \"unlisted\" tables from the sidebar.\nI call this, let me know what are you thoughts, having hidden, unlisted, and nav_blacklist as the following:\n- hidden will hide a table system-wise. NO show, editing, listing, etc. any where. (or we can just make it work the same as all directus_ tables.\n- unlisted group-wise. same as above.\n- nav_blacklist you want it to be listed but not in the sidebar, In case you want to use key tables or whatever.\nAnd here we are  talking about \"links\" because you can access to the table, In order to do not let the user to view, edit the table, there a permission option for each.\nHope I made myself clear with the idea.\nAny thoughts?\n. > The original purpose of nav_blacklist was to manage all nav items (Extensions, Tables, Users, Files, Activity, Messages)... but it's only managing Tables.\nI put example in the nav_blacklist and it hid the Example extensions from the navigation so it's working for anything that is part of the navigation.\nThe rest is implemented Would you like to review it @benhaynes ?\n. @benhaynes by the rest is implemented I mean I did everything but add extension_blacklist to the table, because we can hide extensions (including bookmarks and table) using nav_blacklist.\n\nI am not seeing those here or on the dev server (with git hooks to the dev branch):\nhttps://github.com/RNGR/Directus/blob/development/api/schema.sql\n\nOh right, I missed the schema.sql, it was all on migrations. I'm going to send a pull request. We also need to run migrations on git hooks as well, that's why is not on dev branch on dev server.\n. Did I tell you this was up? because it was up, my bad.\n@benhaynes let me know if it work as it expected? \n. This issue is implemented.\nWould you like to review it @benhaynes ?\n. This was working, not with the new implementation, It was my fault, fixed already!\n. This was fixed by #824\n. This was solved already, I'd close it.\nLet me know if this still happening to you.\n. @benhaynes it certainly did, I'd take another look, this solved it in my end.\n. Now images on files module can have a fallback to a image (which can be change a for a new one) when the images has a broken link (or perhaps is not a image).\n@benhaynes what do you think on implementing this on other part, would be useful? on UI like, Single File or Multiple file for example.\n. @benhaynes I'm actually working on this one right now. I was thinking pulling from development for development server and pull from master for the demo site.\nusers/testers test Directus stable which is what master represents, and development is for new features, etc.\nAny thoughts?\n. This has been implemented on both development and demo server.\nI'd close it.\n. @benhaynes yup, it's working. it's pulling every changes made in github.\n. @benhaynes I'd take a look, probably I messed up the timestamp on the new uploader. let's see.\n. While I honestly don't know when this got broken:\nBut disabling this get fixed:\n\nWhen this UI settings is enabled the date value are formatted to \"ago\" format and it hard to sort based on  uploaded date.\nI wonder was this working before? or does the settings wasn't enabled before?\n@benhaynes thoughts? \n. @benhaynes I mean is perfectly fin showing the date as contextual, I mean we should have a way to separate the value of the input AND the representation of the value.\nI believe the value of an UI is get by the method list because was it meant to show its value on the listview, am I right?\nso, in conclusion a suggest a UI need to be capable to have a value and a representation of the value.\nExample: \nDatetime UI\n| Value | Representation of the value |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1437356674 | Monday, 20-Jul-15 01:44:34 UTC |\n| 1437356674 | one seconds ago |\nUser UI\n| Value | Representation of the value |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1234 | Welling Guzman |\n| 1234 |  |\nSo it doesn't matter what's the text being displayed, the value still the same. so sorting it will always end up sorting the \"real\" values instead the representation of the value. sorting the ids of User UI instead sorting the image url or the names.\nNow, while writing this what if we want to sort by names, because should be more convenient, that something to think about, what if we can specify by an options if we want to sort by \"native value\" or the representation value?.\nThis is getting a little bit complex. but it would be better to separate the value from the representation of the value.\nThoughts?\n. @benhaynes exactly, that's what I was trying to say  value would not be always sortable, in some cases is better to sort a user by its name rather that its id, on the user UI for example. so having Value, Representation and Sort is the perfect combination.\n. @benhaynes There's a draft implementation which works, but we need to polish it a bit more, and add the sort and value implementation on some UI, as well as implementing the image list on User UI.\nSo I'd keep updating this. regarding this issue it should be fixed by now.\n. I'd call the rest part of another issue. The file are getting sorted correctly.\nI'll close this.\n. @benhaynes was the previous comment related to this issue or the issue with files being sorted all wrong?\nAnyway, you are right, I'm removing that fields, so if a image is uploaded/set it automatically replace the gravatar.\nI thought it would be nice to have an option where you can choose to pick the image or not, but it was kind of dumb, if someone upload the image as a avatar it is because want it as a avatar.\nSo it's cool to remove it.\n. Option removed!\n. @benhaynes While trying to force Date UI to not display time, because now as an option I can enter HH:mm:ss on date and would display the time, wouldn't be better to merge this two into one Datetime UI? As now the format is open, time can be included or excluded.\n. This is done, but pending on merging the two UI together. @benhaynes should we open a new ticket for merging?\nI'm closing it.\n. @benhaynes we are not going to have any issue here, as now, because the media directory is empty. \nAs you can see the dev server it's pulling from this branches, and it never get file conflicts.\nBut now, a important question here is, @benhaynes did you have an issue with git conflicts pulling new versions to remote servers?\n. @benhaynes I was thinking about if I had not been aware of some automatically versioning, but as far as I know this need to be done manually.\nLet's say, now after we wrap everything up and merge with master, on master with manually bump the version number, from 6.0.2 to 6.1.0 and tagged as a released version, we hash that version number as we get the commit hash, but is not automatically.\nIf we are talking about cache buster we are using from the git commit hash, we can also use the modification time from each file and each file has a different hash.\nWe can discuss more ideas here, like on each commit, we can automatically bump a number into a file and get the hash from there instead of the commit.\nBut I'd vote for using manually change our version into production (master), while we work on cache buster for the assets JS and CSS, and we work on modification time with this?\nAre you thinking on anything more beside assets for the version number?\n. @benhaynes I think we should wait until #921, #893 and #881 are done, and after I clean up the DB Migrations so it's less files, because there's files creating tables that later we delete, at the same migration, what do you think?\nafter this is done, I'd work primarily  on #805 and any related to files. so we can be done with it.\nThoughts? Let's chat. \n. I found the problem here, in schema.sql I used what we agreed to have everything default to 1, which means on update/edit, the group do not have bigedit permission, so it try to look up for a the user column to check if this entry belongs to the user performing the update, so it fails, and wont work.\nThe solutions is to set the the group to big permission. (not altering the default value being 1)\n. @benhaynes great, if this still happen let's reopen it.\n. Fixed! PR #873 \n. Fixed https://github.com/RNGR/Directus/issues/871\n. @benhaynes now it's showing up the status bar above users entry, now /users is not filtering the status. So I'm working on that now.\n. @benhaynes Do you know why the user status is hard-coded to be always active here in EntriesCollection.js?\n. This is why the filter doesn't work. and it always keep showing all the active users.\n. @benhaynes ok, cool, so I'm going to remove those line, so the dropdown works.\n. > Could the \"Inactive\" group always be last on the users page?\nI made it to be last on the users page. but I wonder how did you manage to to be other but last?\n\nIs there a way to logout users (who are logged in) when their account is made inactive/deleted?\nI was trying to sort something out here, but I couldn't without us managing session into the database, we need to have all the sessions belonging to a user in a place we can easily manage, all the session by default are stored as a file and serialized in a different way that php serialize object.\n\nWe must implement a table that would store the sessions, or do have another solutions? I'd look if we have more options here.\n. @benhaynes yes, if we add the ability to delete a file, it would delete the DB record, not the actual file, because there's not way to delete a file either (as of now).\nI also think having active would treat deleting file as deleting records, if there's a active, we inactive the record otherwise would delete the file and the record.\nNow, what kind of scenario we want to inactive a file?\n. @benhaynes seems fair, that's the only thing I can think of now.\ndo we agreed on implementing soft-delete just changing the status of the db record?\n. @benhaynes right now we are soft-deleting files\nNote: (this is how it should work, but now there's a bug in it, couldn't make it work as it suppose to)\nif you upload a file with the same name it would append a number after it. file.jpg is uploaded and save (using file name instead of ids or hash), then you soft-delete it or not, but  if you try to uplaod a file.jpg again it would (or  it should) created a new file file file-2.jpg.\n. There was a change in the setting name record. now there's not file_file_naming now it's named file_naming.\ntry using this:\nsql\nupdate directus_settings SET name = 'file_naming' WHERE name = 'file_file_naming';\n. I tried on the demo site and it was fixed with this, I get the first error, but I didn't get the error after refreshing the page.\n. Hi @gavinappleby,\nFirst I'd recommend not sharing real server information for security reason.\nOk, so let's go to the issue, is this a apache or nginx server? are you using mod_php, php_fpm,etc?\nAll similar issues was reported before was somehow related with the type of server setup. can you give me more information about your server?\nThanks!\n. @gavinappleby as far as I'm concern, using Server API: CGI/FastCGI would display mod_rewrite with a red question mark, but on fastCGI we can't use apache_get_modules() function, but it should still work with any problem.\nDid you double check if mod_rewrite is actually enabled?\nanyways, I'd take a look on a CGI/FastCGI server to see if I can replicate your issue.\n. Can you show me the blank page that it display when you click install?\nCan you check the browser console, and screenshot any warning or error that may show up?\nAre you using master branch?\nI wonder what this may be, because it should work fine as far as I'm concerned, I install it on different machines with php-fpm and apache and I couldn't replicate your problem.\n. Oh I wonder, does api/config.php gets created?, what's was the value of Project Path in the Project Info step. (image below) or in api/config.php file what's the value of DIRECTUS_PATH ( define('DIRECTUS_PATH', '/');)?\n\nI'm asking because someone reported and error before and it was because DIRECTUS_PATH wasn't set correctly. In your case it should be /emjplastics/iceberg/\n. > Is it possible to just copy and rename the config_sample.php file and enter the into into there and the just import schema.sql into the database manually?\nYes, absolutely you could also do that.\nThis is something I'd like to fix, but I'm out of questions.\nThis is something we do not ask, but as me, I'd like to give your installation a try, if you don't mind, just let me know.\n. I'm glad, Of course you can send me the details to hola (at) wellingguzman.com I'd love to help  you solve this problem. (which help us solve our problem)\n. I don't recall if we get to solve this issue before. @gavinappleby did you solve your problem?\n@benhaynes let's close this ticket we have been fixing lots of tickets since, so the problem still happening please open a new ticket or comment here.\n. @Vienneww what OS are you using? apache or nginx? how are you trying to install Directus? From the master branch, the build branch?\n. @Vienneww another question if you go and click install will it work?\n. @Vienneww Thanks for the info. What operative system are you using?\n. Thanks for the info, I checking off item from the list, another question how your api/config.php looks like, you can remove any sensitive data like your server host and database user and password. and share the rest.\n. I will keep asking bunch of questions here, so I've seen so far everything have been all good.\nPHP Version: ?\nApache Version: ?\nAnything on php/apache logs about the HTTP 500 error?\nWe've been informed about this issue before, and we couldn't replicate it, it will be helpful we can help each other here to fix it.\n. Really appreciate the help, It seems the mod_rewrite is not actually enabled, OR there's a issue creating the endpoint.\nOn your phpinfo what Server API and Loaded Modules says?\n. Thanks again, so you are good there then, you should check your apache configuration. and see if you have AllowOverride All under <Directory>? \n. @Vienneww Thanks for the info, isn't there another <Directory> that looks like <Directory \"/var/www/html\"> with a path to your public path or directus path?\nEx:\n<Directory \"/var/www/html\">\n    AllowOverride All\n    Order allow,deny\n    Allow from all\n</Directory>\nCan you do this to make sure .htaccess is working?\n1. Create a new directory test.\n2. Create a new .htaccess file inside test directory with the content below:\n<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>\n       RewriteEngine On\n       RewriteRule ^.*$ mod_rewrite.php\n   </IfModule>\n3. Create a new php file mod_rewrite.php inside test with the content below:\nphp\n   <?php\n   var_dump($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']);\n4. Go to your browser and access the test directory yourhost.com/test/non-existing\n5. If mod_rewrite is enabled and you added AllowOverride All  you should see the value /non-existing being dump.\n. > I followed your steps, and in my browser accessing yourhost.com/test/non-existing, I get this:\n\nstring(18) \"/test/non-existing\"\n\nThat means that mod_rewrite is enabled. still the installation saying \"no\" on mod_rewrite?\n\nHowever after I clicked INSTALL, api/config.php was generated and I could not access the installation page anymore. What I get instead is the content in this file\n\nThis is probably because the api/config.php is wrong. We are working on display better errors messages.\nWe are here to help. @Vienneww were you able to install Directus now?\n. I do not think that the HTTP 500 ERROR problem is related to api/config.php, is there a log file inside api/logs/? or even your php/apache logs (beside access.log)?\n. @Vienneww it seems the user you are using doesn't have the right to INSERT granted.\n\nINSERT command denied to user\n\nCan you confirm and give the user the right permissions or use another user with enough privileges?\n. @Vienneww thanks, we will work on checking for permissions and give the users a better error message.\n. I will close the ticket as the mod_rewrite was resolved.\n. @Vienneww glad that the problem was solved. Anything else just let us know, we are here to help.\n. @benhaynes now file_file_naming is file_naming and there's not more file_title_naming. and did some fixes in the way, and I implemented the hash name option.\nNeed a bit of refactor and cleaning, but I get it to work.\n. I'll close this by now. refactor would be another chapter. what do you think @benhaynes ?\n. @benhaynes This is a small implementation but it does the trick, it open a modal alert when any element with  class toggle-help-text gets a click.\nI;d close this. we can reopen if it still need some more work or ideas directly to how it should work.\n. You are trying to harddelete/bigharddelete a item, which \"allow_delete\" = \"3\" / allow_delete\" = \"4\".\nBut it should fallback to update the status column if it has status column. If you are using the same offfices table that I'm using it does have status column. I'd take a look, because it should update the item instead of delete it.\n. @benhaynes well, you are right we can say if it's hard or soft delete based on the existence of a status column.\n\nMeaning, if you have allow_delete=4 with an active column... you should still be able to soft delete items. Just not the other way around.\n\nIn that case, should we NEVER harddelete on the existence of status column even though we had harddelete?, so we don't need to use 3 and 4.\nAnd was you said we should determine that by whether or not there's a status column.\n. @benhaynes perfect, so that how is going to be.\nShould we open a new ticket for it, or just keep this open for it?\n. This was implemented. so I'd close the issue. if we find something, we'll reopen it.\n. You can review this commits now, I added the column name next to Can Delete Their Items.\nAnd also you can't delete items that are not yours when delete=1 is set.\n. @benhaynes this and #921 is happening to you, but not to me, I tried again, and I can't delete items that are not mine when allow_delete=1.\nI'm going to test a bit more to check if I keep getting the expected results or the issue you get.\n. @benhaynes I found the issue on soft delete it wasn't checking for delete permission but for edit before performing update.\nTake a look, I went to http://thedirectus.com/tables/offices and everything it's working properly.\n. @benhaynes you right haha, didn't notice that. go ahead if you like, otherwise I'd do it.\nIn that case, I knew something was wrong with bookmarks, because I don't remember it working that way.\nDoes it work that way before?\n\nI noticed that within directus_bookmarks some URLs have a leading slash and others don't\n\nYup was my fault, but I fixed.\n. @benhaynes What I'm certainly sure is that it used to save the search query, but now it's not working. I'd check that out.\n. I'd close this one, preferences are being saved correctly. otherwise we'll reopen it.\n. Save Status\nWhen you save a bookmark with ACTIVE and then change it to INACTIVE (this INACTIVE is changed automatically to the actual table), then if you go back to the bookmark it would show you ACTIVE, and then if you go to the bookmark \"original table\" it would be INACTIVE.\nNot Navigating After One Click\nNow every time you click a bookmark it should show you its actual state (preferences).\nBONUS\nNow  you can see which bookmark you are seeing (highlighted), but as soon as you change a preference it would change the highlight to the table. (kind of good, because after you change any preferences those preferences are sent directly to the table and not the bookmark)\nNote: There're some issues creating or retrieving bookmark for any other pages that are not tables.\n. @benhaynes haven't happened to me yet, but I'd work on it as soon as you find a way to replicate it. :+1: \n. Hmm, Let me see what is happening here, because I can send message with no problem.\nCan you check the developer tools and see what error throw the http request? (screenshot)\n. @benhaynes Can you also send me the screenshot of the http request in red \"rows/\" (the first one) response content.\nThanks!\n. @benhaynes do you still keep getting this error?\n. @benhaynes I installed PHPMailer, and tried it again and now it's working.\nNow, can you update composer and the schema? maybe there's a db change missing in your end.\n. In fact we need to escape even more datas, if I create a table and name it \"Active 8/5\", it would create the table, but I  can't access to it.\nI'd work on it.\n. @benhaynes NOTE: Something to keep in mind is that I don't know yet if it is a Directus or Zend DB bug, but querying the rows of an table named \"Active 8/5\" would throw an error like this:\n\nNotice the name of the table after WHERE: \n`Active` `8``/``5`\n. @benhaynes yeah I know, that what I meant when I say we need to escape more data, right now you can create a table with slashes and spaces. but it would throw and error, but if you check the database the tables are there. it returns an error trying to get data for that table.\nNow, what should we do here? sanitize everything, so \"Active 8/5\" will sanitize to \"Active-8-5\"?\nWhat do you think? or better yet, warn that the table can't have symbols just alphanumerics.\n. Also In order to the slashes encoded to work, it needs add AllowEncodedSlashes NoDecode on the apache config file, otherwise it would keep the same error as if it weren't encoded.\n. @benhaynes yeah, I think the warning is better.\nAlso users can create table directly on the database with spaces, slashes and specials characters.\nWe need to at least find a way to wrap this tables names so Directus don't throw an error about malformed tables name.\n. I'll close this, bookmarks are now escaped. (also the tables)\n. @benhaynes I'd like you to help me elaborate a better error message here.\n. Due to the nature of the noty library, or how this works, it doesn't quite it's necessary or a good thing to do a method for sticky and timeout methods.\nand Sound?.. nah, I'll pass for now.\n. @benhaynes A question, so the whole message would resume into:\nRestricted Access\n[Group] permissions only allow you to [edit] your own items.\nRemoving \"please send this to IT:\" text?\n. @benhaynes wouldn't better if we just cut out the \"send this to IT\" part before every restricted permission message?\n. @benhaynes Travis working, now we need to add tests.\nI'll close it!\n. @jomonkj can you provide more information regarding this issue?\n. @jomonkj you're right, I understand the issue now. Thanks!\n. @benhaynes As we talking about, not having a primary key is it problematic, as it would be not having in any scenario out Directus. not having and primary key could end up being a table that can only insert, or we can ask for create a primary key.\nare we going to disable \"Primary\" on table settings as we said we were going to, because it represents the \"main\" field rather than primary field/key. or when it's empty choose what's Directus guess what's the main field?\nCustom keys are working as expected, I haven't had more issues regarding custom key recently.\n. This is related to #938.\nWhat we can do at first is just do not allow anything but insert and view if the table doesn't have primary key.\nHow are we going to let the user create their own primary key name? by specify the default name on settings? or primary key name per table? or both?\n. We made it possible to use custom primary key table name in 6.4.x, what's missing is how to treat table without it, it's not a easy task, as there's not way to reference a record.\nMaybe we create a internal id either way, but that's a different topic, but let's enforce a primary key.. @benhaynes wouldn't be the same library as we use behind the API? or didn't I understand correctly what you mean by helper library?\nAs we talk about abstracting, we can use our current library, and decouple from the API, and make the API use it, it would be the same just taking it out form the API.\nAs an example:\nphp\n$peopleTable = new DirectusTable('people');\n$peopleTable->insert(array(\n  'name' => 'John Doe'\n  'email' => 'j.doe@email.com'\n));\n``` php\n// requestPayload\n// name: \"John Doe\"\n// email: \"j.doe@email.com\"\n$app->post('/people', function() {\n  $peopleTable = new DirectusTable('people');\n  return $peopleTable->insert($requestPayload);\n});\n```\nOr are you talking about something else?\n. This also are going to be part of https://github.com/directus/directus-php-sdk\n. Should we close this and open the ticket on the SDK? or should we keep it here as we are updating the Directus DB package?\n. I've been thinking about it, staying here will be best as it will be in Directus Core anyway, and will be used by the SDK.\n. we already have a php-sdk and a node-sdk, which can be used as library to access the database. @ConnorGBrewster what I found odd is that the table allow_alter was set with 0.\nAlthough we decided to be 0 by default as by default you don't have any permission to a table to prevent a undesired permission to a group.\nNow you are right there's not way to adjust allow_alter. I'd work on that, also I'd check why the table you created didn't have all the permissions set.\nThanks \n. > I feel that the user who creates the table should by default be able to alter it.\nYou're right, this is a bug, if you are able to create it, you must have the permission to alter it. that's how it used to work.\n. But again, those are two separate permission, as normally if you are using admin, you can do both by default that's my concern. so I think, alter would turn into the permission that would say whether or not you can create tables and columns, I'd think it would be much better than check for the group_id, which is how we check if it's admin or not.\nThoughts?\n. @ConnorGBrewster I missed that point, you're right, alter are per table permission, so we shouldn't depend on that to know whether a group can create a table or not. so we were talking about adding a group field is_admin by now, so this would be our quickest solutions without altering too much how the permissions works.\nThanks for all your comments. :+1: :100: \n. @ConnorGBrewster Good catch! Thanks a lot. That's the problem right there, we were trying to make sure only admin users gets alter permission, so if a non-admin user try to add an alter permission we make sure it's set to 0.\nChanging this:\n``` php\nprivate function verifyPrivilege($attributes) {\n    // Making sure alter is set for admin only.\n    if($this->isCurrentUserAdmin() && !array_key_exists('allow_alter', $attributes)) {\n        $attributes['allow_alter'] = 1;\n    } else {\n        $attributes['allow_alter'] = 0;\n    }\nreturn $attributes;\n\n}\n```\nTo this:\n``` php\nprivate function verifyPrivilege($attributes) {\n    // Making sure alter is set for admin only.\n    if(!$this->isCurrentUserAdmin() && array_key_exists('allow_alter', $attributes)) {\n        $attributes['allow_alter'] = 0;\n    }\nreturn $attributes;\n\n}\n```\nwould solve the problem.\n. Or better yet.\n``` php\nprivate function verifyPrivilege($attributes) {\n    // Making sure alter is set for admin only.\n    if(array_key_exists('allow_alter', $attributes)) {\n        if ($this->isCurrentUserAdmin()) {\n            $attributes['allow_alter'] = 1;\n        } else {\n            $attributes['allow_alter'] = 0;\n        }\n    }\nreturn $attributes;\n\n}\n``\n. @ConnorGBrewster it's called insideinsertPrivilegeandupdatePrivilege` methods.\nHere DirectusPrivilegesTableGateway.php#L76 and Here DirectusPrivilegesTableGateway.php#L98\n. @wzyboy oh got catch, thanks you are right!\n. @wzyboy it should be fixed by now. rebuilding and pushing.\nI'll close this.\n. @Ullarah the error seems odd, if I'm correct what it is saying there's a syntax error, but I try to upload a file and it works.\nNow I'm to solve this, which branch did you use, and how did you install it? can you show me a screenshot of what is it at:\nEditView.js?bust=85857a46c9df008e270e16f5a45f6c343d7a0e48:189\nAlso, about jquery-1.11.0.js being loaded without existing I believe this is the jquery.min.map  working its magics.\n. @Ullarah Is the server returning a response after you try to upload the image?\nAre you running under what server configuration?\nI'm concern why is giving and error in that line, please send me any related information with that request as well, that I may be missing.\nThanks!\n. @Ullarah to be honest this have been our biggest issue so far, we have couple of server setups and we have tried install on everything and it's works, but it seems there's so much variety.\nCan you give me all the details, are you using Mac OS, Linux, or Windows? a software such as MAMP/WAMP? apache with php fpm? nginx with apache? \nI'd like to resolve this issue.\n. We have been fixing lots of bugs with uploading files so I assume this was fixed along the way.\n@Mahjouba91 About Class 'finfo' not found, was odd to me, but I found this extension is disabled by some hosting and/or php installation. I added a requirement check on installation this may help a bit.\nThanks, I will close this, if this a issue that still persist I will open it up again.\n. @hrwebasst yeah it's not well documented yet, but when a table is not created by Directus, all users groups doesn't have any permission to it, for example can view those tables.\nTo see those tables you have to go to Settings (gear at the bottom of the sidebar) > Groups Permission > and pick a group and you should see all the tables there and you can change all those permissions by clicking the icons next to the table's name.\nLet me know if that works for you.\n. Thanks @hrwebasst I'd take a look into it, but if you manage to solve this issue, let us know and we'll thank you.\n. @benhaynes we have a ticket for Google Auth #368? so should we close that one?\n. Great, we should also include our friendly neighborhood, GitHub.\n. We should rewrite the authentication code, so we can be extensible and we can add more services easily. but with current authentication library will not be easy to do.\n. hey @mickrip I already merge these commits into development\nThanks :+1: \n. We can also \"remove\" it from Directus, by no giving permission to anyone to see it or interact with it.\nIt's also a dangerous features, but as we move forward into a DB Admin tool, we should implement it, so I'm thinking a user group capable of doing this, as we talked about @benhaynes, kind of a like \"super admin\" or something.\n@ConnorGBrewster in your case exports all the table data into a file would be a great option to you? as for you, what would you rather prefer?\nWe can also alert the user like 2 times before this happen.\n. > I don't want a client changing \"totalPrice\" to \"price\" and have my phone ring at 7am on a Sunday morning ;)\nRight! :100: \nWell I understand your point @ConnorGBrewster and it's something we can implement by just my opinion as well, now I believe in what @mickrip says about focusing on the experience for clients first, (without omitting altering scheme in a future) what do you think @benhaynes ?\nI know we need to drop a table/column we don't want or created by mistake. But I'd see it as doing this in the development process using an Admin tool, and when are set, that where Directus comes in to play.\nThoughts?\n. @benhaynes :+1: Sounds good to me. I agreed with that.\n. Thanks @Pawnerd I'll take a look into this.\n. hey @Pawnerd  can you please tell me what product_id.product_identifier is?\n. From what @Pawnerd  mentioned I found the issue with this @benhaynes \nHere bring the issue we talked about getting related data, when you are editing a page, all the data gets requested (including related) while on table listing is not. at least not the second level deep.\nI can show more details later about how this works and why is not getting the data as it's expected.\n. @benhaynes Yes, it's working on the listing page.\n. Thanks! @jwdeitch \n. Hey @bobmulder we are planning on turning Directus into a docker container, but we have nothing yet, I'll get back to you after it's done to let you know.\n. hey @beevelop, actually there's not version at all in term of git tags, we had talked about this, and how I did not push any tags before, so for the next release we are going to publish releases.\nRight now what I can do is create a tag with the current version, let me know if that helps.\n. Thank you so much @beevelop.\nI'm trying to run this docker container, but after several tries I couldn't.\nFirst I tried this:\ndocker pull beevelop/directus:latest\ndocker run -it beevelop/directus bash\nit seemed to work, I logged into the VM, but Directus didn't get installed, and I didn't know how to access this with the default virtual host or any host I put. What am I doing wrong? with vagrant when I run the box (which could be similar to the container) it let me access the server via the IP/Host I configured right away.\nThen I tried your solution\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/beevelop/docker-directus\nAdapt docker-compose.yml for your needs (update VIRTUAL_HOST / remove nginx-reverse, etc.)\ndocker-compose up\n```\nIt keeps throwing me Illegal instruction: 4 error.\nI tried to reinstall using this documentation, https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/ and just hitting docker-compose --version throw the same error.\nSo I tried to install pip and install it via pip, but then I get a different type of error.\n$ docker-compose up\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/local/bin/docker-compose\", line 9, in <module>\n    load_entry_point('docker-compose==1.5.2', 'console_scripts', 'docker-compose')()\n  File \"/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python/pkg_resources.py\", line 357, in load_entry_point\n    return get_distribution(dist).load_entry_point(group, name)\n  File \"/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python/pkg_resources.py\", line 2394, in load_entry_point\n    return ep.load()\n  File \"/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python/pkg_resources.py\", line 2108, in load\n    entry = __import__(self.module_name, globals(),globals(), ['__name__'])\n  File \"/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/compose/cli/main.py\", line 21, in <module>\n    from ..progress_stream import StreamOutputError\n  File \"/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/compose/progress_stream.py\", line 1, in <module>\n    from compose import utils\n  File \"/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/compose/utils.py\", line 11, in <module>\n    from six.moves.queue import Empty\nImportError: No module named queue\nso I need to understand how really docker works first.\n\nI'll keep trying until I got it, or you or someone can help me make it works, whichever come first.\nThanks again.\n. We already have docker container https://github.com/directus/directus-docker. this is not a big change, but we should clean the installation process.\n.

Hi @ychoucha as right now, the only way to reset your password is through clicking \"?\" next to password field. You can hard code it, if you like by doing this:\nphp\n$composite = $salt . $password;\n$newPassword = sha1( $composite );\nAnd update directus_users.password with $newPassword\nIs your browser console/server response showing some error?\nI'm having difficulties to troubleshoots this type of error, as I can't replicate them.\nAre you using your install at a localhost? \nThanks\n. This issue was happening after we implement phpmailer library, and were having some issues with it, I'm going to try this again.\n@benhaynes there's a huge bug I'd say huge but just medium large? anyway, a bug when resetting password, it would reset without asking the user (by email) if he/she wants to actually reset the password.\n. I lost track of this issue, @benhaynes what happen if we are testing locally, and email doesn't work? what possible solutions should implement? one good one is to add a script that change the password, like this:\n$ directus user:update_password -uid=1 -upass=123456\n. A better solution will be using a Directus CLI.\nSomething like this:\nbash\n$ directus user:update password <user-id> <new-password>\n. we definitely needs to write the Directus CLI to accept different commands, we can write ourself a simple one or look for simple php cli library.\nright now directus cli is basically a way to install directus with three built-in command.\n. I made a hotfix for this issue, hopefully this will better done by @Wedjaa PR.\nClosed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/d8f1bbd0d057ceb8da9f90e4b3690d3dd745daf4\n. I'm going to add In-Progress I'm working on this one, it does work on listview, but I found out it's not working on the UIView itself, neither on UI settings.\n. It does fallback within the UI default variables. let me know if this works for you.\n. @sonyarianto Apologies for a late response, but some hosting service do not allow FollowSymlinks option for security reason, and can expose other users files/directory.\nA solution to this is using SymLinksIfOwnerMatch instead which only will follow the directory if the owner are the same.\nSo try to change FollowSymlinks with SymLinksIfOwnerMatch and see if it helps.\nWe are probably going to change it as well.\n. @sonyarianto Thank you very much for you suggestion, but to be honest we're not aware that some hosting forbid this option, now we are going to discuss the idea of changing FollowSymlinks with SymLinksIfOwnerMatch by default.\n. Thanks @Mahjouba91 I'm taking care of this issue right now.\n. @DionTimmermann we switched to SymLinksIfOwnerMatch this probably should've fixed your issue. \n@benhaynes Although I was thinking to delete this whole line anyways, but maybe not. I'm closing this issue.\n. @Mahjouba91 We are aware that this button is not working, but I think we thought on removing it. @benhaynes do you remember what was the final decision on this button?\n. @Mahjouba91 This is certainly strange, thanks for letting us knows, we are taking care of this right now.\nIt also seems relatad with #1045 ~~and #1046~~\nThanks\n. @romainhe are you using the current version (there has been some changes in the database schema as well)? This was discussed and fixed #998 #1014 \nIf you are using the current version (with current schema) and still happen, I'd take a look at this again.\n. @romainhe did you solve the problem? what @beevelop says resolved your problem? if it does it should be fixed by now.\n. @benhaynes end up merging datetime and date, leaving time as a separate UI. (didn't delete date UI file though)\n. @benhaynes I made datetime extends from date UI, and share the same template.\n. Thanks @zetalevel I'm going to work on this.\n. Hey @zetalevel to make everything sure that this is not happen could also tell me what did you do to this to happen?\n. Still can't replicate this issue, maybe it was the build branch, I'd make sure to keep build up to date, and try it again, if not, we should closed until it happens again. what do you think @benhaynes ?\n. @benhaynes this commit hides ui_files and ui_users tables.\n. @benhaynes we can add an option on Directus to users can enable or disable weather or not they want to Directus to get all tables from the database, and it will be enabled by default. But all these tables will be listed without any permission, so at the end users won't be able to perform any task on none of these tables.\nIt can be in the same list but grayed out, or (What I prefer) being all grayed out but under the main (active) list, and with the \"Add\" button next to them, and when you click \"Add\" it will give the current group \"view\" permission.\nWhat do you think?\n. Exactly it will only be visible on Settings>Tables page, but what do you think about having the tables in a separate list (of inactive or not in directus) under the main/active list, same as we do with inactive users in Users?\n. @benhaynes there's not screenshot below :smile: \nIs this happening on all relational column? I'd take a look and get back at you.\n. Duplicated: #1100\nClosing it.\n. @benhaynes we should define what primary_column means, does it means primary_key_column OR primary_table_representation_column?\n. Fixed in d36ead5234e378f4189a66cc3c757521ae4c5413\n. We end up not throwing any alert but allow leading number exists and fix the issue that it brought.\n. Thanks @richjenks for let us know, I'd look at this one, yeah it actually missing the dependencies on the build branch.\n. @benhaynes Looking back I didn't explain myself well, so the thing is, when you write your password it's all good and how it works it's all good, but my concern is when is \"encrypting\" the page set itself as \"loading data\" (showing the moving square bottom right).\nPlus: When you click \"Reveal Password\" it just reveal the hashed password.\nJust feel that that second of \"loading\" makes it feel slow to me. haha, just wondering if you feel the same on this one.\n. @benhaynes oh, but then it doesn't \"reveal\" you the password, I was expecting at least while, it's not saved, to get the value in plaintext, maybe I'm wrong but that's what I was expecting to work. because seeing the hash doesn't do much for me. but maybe it's just me. but we can have the option to disable the \"reveal\" though.\n. I just hide it. (Commented out)\n. @benhaynes Oh by default we have the media directory on the root. so it should be this the correct way:\n'root' => realpath(BASE_PATH . '/media'),\nWhat we need to specify is that BASE_PATH is the base/root directory of Directus, and it doesn't have trailing slash .\nWe need to move this to the documentation.\nAny thoughts?\n. @benhaynes that's because the default values of the other fields are used.\nshould we default everything to 0?\n. @jel-massih I found out that I've fixed this but I've not push it yet :-1: \n@benhaynes the issue was when the junction table didn't have sort field.\npushing now... :muscle: \n. Fixed by 40c800fd2675670401dee8c57f2e9284513a58e5\n@benhaynes by the way, not, this wasn't the one I fixed the other day.\nClosing it.\n. @jel-massih I haven't fixed this yet.\nIf I'm correct, the issue (what's missing) here, it is that many-to-many doesn't have the option to edit relationship (after it has been created), there's not junction table, or left/right key field.\nIf you go to any table with a many-to-many field, and click on the relationship icon, can you see the \"Junction Table\" field?\n. It actually delete the item if is a delete value.\nMaybe we should add the new options enforce_validation into 6.4?. @benhaynes I tried and it worked, pulling the title, description, tag and size (time) as well.\nmaybe that's what you get for using a drake video haha. jk.\n. @benhaynes did you test @jel-massih PR?\n. @jel-massih I got you. :fist: \n\nwhat does needs_index do?\n\nGood question. Nothing! :no_good: \nif @jel-massih you are not going to work on this one, I can take it now.\n. @benhaynes \n\ncharset isn't being filled in for embeds, is that correct?\n\ntype is the one used to specify is a embedded file.\n\nurl versus embed_id columns. It seems that embed_id is not being used.\n\nembed_id is not being used, url store the id of the embedded url, the UIs are expecting a url, and to make things easy, the id it's kept on the url instead of the embed_id.\nWe should talk about this table structure, will be better to just drop embed_id or make things clear and use the embed_id instead of the url?\n. Adding user_id done here: d1d801445b9b112d459332633db171aff5ac7354\n. Well, well, well, this seems to be somehow was fixed along the way :)\nI will reopen if we can reproduce this issue.. Thanks again for this one. :+1: \n. Thanks! :+1: \n. @jel-massih great! :+1: \n. @richjenks I think there's a ticket open for this issue, but I found right now that's happening on Settings > Tables.\n@benhaynes if you go to Settings > Tables & Fields and click on any table, and hit enter, it will throw the \"This table already exists!\".\n. Plus: it's happening on listing page, go to any listing page and hit enter.\n. @richjenks don't have to be sorry, this is great what you are doing, this helps us and we appreciate it, Thanks.\nI'll look into it.\n. @richjenks Regarding the second issue, it seems you are using PHP 5.6.x, and $HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA is deprecated, but the weird part is not that is deprecated is that we are not using it, and it's a php bug bug#66763\nTo solve this add/use/update this on your php.ini\nalways_populate_raw_post_data = -1\nLet me know if that works for you.\n. @richjenks what Operating System are you using?\n. > - Each UI parameter/option should have a clear title and description\n\n\nLook into better ways to visualize the relationships\nShow examples and placeholder text\nEnsure nothing is missing/broken (see other tickets)\n\n\nWe have been working on all except a better visualization of the relationship, we can add that into the features.\n\n\nWhy we're not using the actual \"relationships\" in MySQL to store these relationships?\n\nLet's plan on adding this into future version.\n\nLet's remove directus_tables.is_junction_table and all references to it in the framework. \n\nAgreed, we have been removing its reference.\n\ndirectus_tables.table_name and directus_tables.field_name\n\nYou meant directus_columns right? \ud83d\udc30 , I believe this was used as MySQL uses the same names, I like it that way, but we can discuss how confusing can it be. This will rise another question, are we naming it \"Fields\" or \"Columns\"? sometimes the names are interchangeable.\n\ndirectus_columns.master and directus_columns.system\nWhere are these used? Could we find ways to simplify this... maybe remove them?\n\nWe can remove it, the use of master it was to indicate the main column/field of a table, the value that represents the table. System is a way to tell when a column/field name was a system field, such as id, sort and status (I think those are all).\n\ndirectus_columns.data_type\n\nIt's not sure the uses but it's mainly used for relational field, I think it will be best to store the column real data type, ex: INT, VARCHAR or ALIAS.\n\ndirectus_columns.relationship_type\n\nI like all in uppercase altogether. wanna fight for it? \u270c\ufe0f  But I do love that it should be an enum.\n\ndirectus_columns.comment\n\nWhat about SQLite? no love? As far as I know SQLite do not support field comment, or does it, can someone confirm?.\n\nLet's move system, master, hidden_input, hidden_list, and required right before sort in the default schema field order\n\nPerfect!\n\nSome thoughts around new naming for these fields:\nrelated_table (changed)\n\nAgreed, it was giving anxiety.\n\njunction_table\nthis_table_foreign_key (changed)\nrelated_table_foreign_key (changed)\n\nOn many to one, junction_right_key represents the current table key.\nOn many to many junction_right_key represents the junction_table key.\nIt can't be this_table_foreign_key because it not always the current table key.\nStill analyzing what can be best regarding the column names, but while we are at it, we can discuss in labeling the way you say, depending on the relationship type, we label it in the form differently.\n. > OK, if that's what MySQL calls them then let's leave it as is. We do need to agree on fields/columns though. Is there a preference?\nThe only thing I have to say, it's that when I say column, I'm thinking about a table columns, but I say field Im thinking about that form field. (which is a column anyway).\nField seems like a more friendly name.\n. We could reduce the code in the api.php file, but the API is not organized into a separate files.\nI'm going to call it organized by the terms we agreed on this ticket.\nThe friendly responses are going to be handled here https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/1226#issuecomment-237451877. I forgot we had this ticket, yes, this was solved by: https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/b8176078ae8d77f7bebf38c79c7c02445143635e\n. Cannot replicate this issue no more.\nThe issue is/was that if you had 2 unread messages and get a new notification the notification will be received 3 times.\nIf manage to replicate this once again, I will re-open this ticket. \n. @crashtainer you can also use the build branch instead which already has all the dependencies. https://github.com/directus/directus/tree/build\nYou can download the zip here\n. @cantstopthi can you open a new ticket with more details? such as the Operative System, and what version of Directus you are using and what are the errors? So I can understand your problem better.\nThanks\n. @benhaynes This is perfect, I think the same, and it turns kind of annoying at first, when it keep asking for an empty fields that was empty at first place. :+1: :100: \n.

Hi @TJProgrammer thanks for letting us know, I'm going to take a look at this.\n. @benhaynes I believe the problem there it has to be with Folder field. I can't find it now, but I think I open a ticket about this, right now not all UIs have the relationship type set, but rather guessed on the server.\nWe need to implement this in a way that the UIs itself provide their relationship type, rather than the server to guess it.\n. I couldn't replicate this before, so we went through different fixes and hotfixes for relationship fields, so this might be fixed along the way.\nI'm closing this one, but if @TJProgrammer still experience this issue, I will open this again and take care of that again.\n. Let's look into Symfony Installer as well.\n$ symfony new my_project 2.8.1\n. > Could we remove directus_bookmarks.icon_class and any references to it?\nAren't we using icon_class to let the user customize with any icon they desired? aren't we going to bring back the icons?\n\nAre we using the directus_bookmarks.active field? If not, can we remove it?\n\nNot in used (Or it has always seems like it, never found anything related to this field), let's removed.\n\nAre we using the directus_bookmarks.section field? If not, can we remove it?\n\nThis is the category on where the bookmark, is going to be displayed under, other are system item such as Users and files, search are bookmarks and tables, are well, tables, although, we are going to remove \"Activity, Files, Messages and Users\" from here. I think we can remove this as all this entries are going to be bookmarks.\n\nShould we add a directus_bookmarks.preference_id field? It seems like it's currently matching the bookmark preference based on the directus_preferences.title field... does that seem correct?\n\nOkay this one can be done this way, it seems more easy to handle, but at the end with will need the title to check if wether or not an entry with this name exists so it wont be duplicated. (or it can be with the magic of icon next to it who knows). NOTE make title field field unique.\n. > The problem with the icons is that they take up a lot of width in the nav... and the tables/bookmarks are already cut-off. Also, it's unclear if we would add an icon for all first level nav items (Files, Users... and also each table).\nIt's true, I also think what you said about taking up the space, and I'm talking about all first level item.\n\nGreat!! Maybe one last search though ;)\n\nJust to make everything sure.\n\nYeah, the table says \"directus_bookmarks\"... I think it'd be good to remove the system ones and have it only be for bookmarks.\n\nThis is a good thing to do, we also need to change bookmarks to referencing the sidebar nav, everything is not a bookmarks, that's what makes confusing, what is bookmarks, and what's not, when table list is stored in bookmarks (sidebar).\n\nIf the title is unique doesn't that mean that if I add a bookmark that's the same name as one you added... it would fail/override? Bookmarks are per user (but we should have an option to make them per group/global) so they should only be unique to that user... not the whole table.\n\nI need to make it unique per user then, but that's going to be the quickest way to fix this. How about implementing the 3 options? and see if it works (Check whether or not is easy to implement) Otherwise we move it to far later:\n- User Bookmarks\n- Group Bookmarks\n- Global Bookmarks\n. We have removed all references of active and icon_class from directus_bookmarks table.\nWe didn't force deletion of these columns, only new install will install without it.. > Another option for Bookmarks being assigned to individual users:\n\nEach record is either assigned to a specific user (store id) or is global (NULL) for the user column.\nWould this be easier than trying to do all three of these?\nUser Bookmarks\nGroup Bookmarks\nGlobal Bookmarks\n\nThis will be a new feature.\nClosed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/63be46defebe95a2f51be426be9f0cd15521561c\nFeathub http://feathub.com/directus/directus/+117.

Perfect, didn't know why it was not working for me. :+1: \n. hey @neyric, that should be a problem with the gulp build task, I'd take a look.\nAnd we would be glad if you step in and document what's missing we will appreciate.\nThanks.\n. I've fixed the problem you get pull the recent version or use the build branch.\nThanks for letting us know.\nIf you bump into any problem let us know.\n. @benhaynes the issue here is that we are trying to select * (all) the fields most of the time (to not say always) and this violates the read_field_blacklist. same with updating violating the write_field_blacklist.\nI recommends we just stripe out the blacklisted fields before perform an action. That will be the job of the API not letting this field to get into the selects or updates.\nIf directus_users.token is blacklisted on read every time a select * from directus_users is performed, the tablegateway will take care of taking this table from the select and convert it into select id, email, password, etc from directus_users but not token.\nMaking sure this can be warned on the admin panel, which will results in a Directus issue if they could've find a way to edit a blacklisted field, or they just add it directly to the api request, which either case we make sure the update or select won't happen on the server.\nwhat do you think?\n. All I said it was that it can work within Directus feature, but we need to update how we force to NOT Select blacklisted fields from a table. (a good behavior) So here is the question:\nif we blacklisted directus_users.token, and a user request \"all\" fields from directus_users, should we a) remove the blacklisted field (what I'm proposing), or b) throw an error because you are requesting a blacklisted field (what currently happening).\nOR\nwe keep doing what's currently being done, but we strip the columns first, on the server.\nAm I clear? I'm being kind of confused here.\n.

Sure thing. how do you want the second alerted to styled or showed the column/table name?\nNote: I was testing the reaction thing. I've never saw that before.\n. seems about right. and without changing much. I like it.\n. Yes, all files are public.\nIn order to serve private files we have to serve it through PHP, so only through the API and Web app can be accessible.\n. This was implemented in 6.4.x, you can change the columns default values.. Hey @talbet, we were aware of that recently and what you can do if you are using 6.1.0 or above is after log into directus, go to users and in any users you would like to authenticated as, is to generate or type any string you like to be the your API key. (see image below)\n\nWith that token you can authenticate to the API without the need to log into Directus first.\nbash\ncurl http://website.dom/api/1/tables/projects -u yc7mGPaQu9mchJf1:\nNotice the : at the end.\nWe are working into update and have a more recent documentations.\nlet me know if this works for you.\n. 404 not found response shouldn't be a json response rather an 404 error page.\nThe rest, should.\n. we should take a look at this: http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/translation/usage.html \n. oh wait. we need one for the front end :) anyway it's something to look at.\n. Didn't quite understand what you mean by capital letter. If you are talking about that Directus display the columns and table name with capital letter and underscore as spaces, it's kind of a \"beautifier\" if this is what you talking about we can have an option to display the actual name without \"beautifying\" the names.\nAnd we can't stop the user from creating names with spaces, because the database engine allow it, what we can do it's work toward making those spaces  not break Directus.\nDid I answer your concern?\n. All tables and columns name are now being converted to lowercase and spaces and symbols to underscores.\n. This was fixed already in here\n. This was closed by https://github.com/directus/docs/commit/88eef3b1e4bab44d3ff2d530ffb84daf52f58b4f\n. hey @iamamused how did you install directus? did you use the master, development or build branch? I tested on master, development and build branch. is there something else I should know to replicate the issues besides the log?\nare the directus_ tables created on your MySQL database?\n. @iamamused perhaps this mode was STRICT_TRANS_TABLES? we have another issue with this mysql mode in here https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/395.\nI want to know if we have issue with that or another mysql mode.\nThanks.\n. @iamamused maybe it was here: https://github.com/directus/directus/blob/master/api/api.php#L120\n. hey @anotherwebstorm, could you tell us which tables did create and what MySQL modes do you have enabled?\n. @anotherwebstorm Thanks, I found the issue, it's an unsupported default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP default value in the migrations library.\nI will let you know as soon as that's fixed.\n. @anotherwebstorm I updated the build branch, can you confirm that it fixes the issue for you too?\n. Hey @iamamused,\nI see the problem here, is actually a issue with the routing path, right now there's a encode \"/\" at the end of the route, I'll take a look into this in a moment. If you go to yourdirectus.com/example_extension you should be seeing the extension.\nThe error You do not have permission to view that page or it doesn't exist has nothing to do with permission actually, but rather that a not found page.\nThanks for reporting this I will take a look at it.\n. @benhaynes Which server specifications were you on? and which brand/version did you use?\n. @benhaynes what user owns directus directory? this maybe happening because the owner could be different from the web server user.\ncan you tell what are the user owner by running this: Second and third column\n```\n$ ls -l directus\nAnd\n$ ls -l directus/api\n``\n. is there a way that I can replicate this? I'm thinking php is running withwww-datauser which doesn't have permission overroot` files.\n. yes, I always get that text, so I'm concern about how didn't you get it.\n. @incraigulous can you help me replicate the issue, I've tried different things so far without any luck.\nWhat Directus version and OS are you using? \n. @incraigulous does the web-server user has permissions to read/write the Directus directory?\n. @incraigulous setting to 775 should works too. avoid using 777 on production. \nWhat OS is your production server? if you are using a linux, you can change permissions using chmod command and change owner using chown command.\n. So I will call it permission issue. solution worked for @incraigulous \nIf this still happening to someone let us know and I will open this ticket again.\n. Hi @vhexs I've tried to reproduce this issue using almost your setup except windows 7 64bit, and I couldn't replicate.\nSo I have some questions:\n- Which tables did Directus created?\n- What's your api/config.php file like?\n- Are you using Directus under a subdirectory in your host/virtual host?\nI'd like to help you resolve this.\n. Another question, is NO_ZERO_DATE or NO_ZERO_IN_DATE enabled in MySQL modes?\nYou can check by execute one of these query:\nsql\nSELECT @@GLOBAL.sql_mode;\nSELECT @@SESSION.sql_mode;\nOr perhaps in your mysql config file (my.ini).\n. @vhexs What happened here is that if mysql has ZERO_IN_DATE enabled it doesn't allow zeros in dates.\nIt was fixed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/62176ac6a68764153201193f65b8668e6fe09b26 and https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/0b25ca1ef5f0061856aedb9338aa73820e8cedcf\n. Hey @DaveBlooman, can please send me any logs, if any, on api/logs?\nAre the rest of the table created? directus_* (What are all the tables prefixed with it)\n. Hey @DaveBlooman,\nWhat was the actual problem, I didn't get it. So you meant that you created the config.php and configuration.php manually and it didn't work until you created Directus using the installer?\nHow did you create all the core tables, such as directus_tables?\nI'd love to see what was the actual issue.\n. Yes, that's the new error message.\nI'm aware of that, I skipped the style of it for later discussion.\n\nis that the size of the file I'm uploading... or the max allowed?\n\nThat's the max allowed.\n. Hi @pinkahd is there is any reason why you closed the PR?\n. Hi @pinkahd, you need to create a new branch, and do all the fixes/changes in there and open a PR. and do what you did, explaining what the PR do, in these case what problem solved.\nPlease feel free to open a new PR, you could also open a ticket and make yourself a PR about it, just incase the PR don't get through at first.\nThanks for submitting and take your time to try Directus.\n. @benhaynes yes, it's fixed.\n.

Thanks @MethodGrab \n. Hi @maximivanov thanks for reporting this. I will on a fix.\nFor future reference, I have one question, do you have any MySQL modes enabled? on Strict mode I get a different error.  1264 Out of range value for column 'date_uploaded' So I wonder which one do you have that gives you that error.\nThanks.\n. @maximivanov this https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/2c835d97b194ccc1e0f0a35143508fd940dc6ada should have fixed the problem, and it will be release on v6.2.6\n. Hi @KailZhang I couldn't replicate your issue, what errors pops up? \"field is required\"? your MySQL server has modes enabled?\nyou can check them by executing one of these:\nsql\nselect @@global.sql_mode\n-- or\nselect @@session.sql_mode\nAre you leaving the field empty or pick an option from it? What's the structure of that field?\n. > I don't know how mysql's mode is related to this.\n@KailZhang now I know it doesn't have to do with that, I was asking as you didn't specified the correct error messages I was trying to get this out of the way, as some issues come from mysql modes.\nChecking if a number is empty using _.isEmpty, it will always going to return false. that was causing the problem.\nThanks for reporting this and let us know if that works for you.\n. > But is this for Directus Core data only? Should the date/time UI allow different formats for user content?\nForgot to mentioned that, yes, Directus core data only, user can format their date as their wish.\n\nWould the user pick a timezone for all of Directus \u2013 or per user? If the CMS has users in different timezones, would that still work properly?\n\nDidn't think through this enough, but good catch, per user will be a even better solution, user can pick their timezone on the editing page. and it will be default to New York Timezone and can be override to whatever the user configure Directus to be.\nUser TimeZone > Directus Project TimeZone > Directus Core TimeZone\n. We can open a new ticket for user timezone.\nWouldn't be too much asking for location, I always feel too skeptical from site requesting my location, or is it just me? @benhaynes \n. yes, and It will auto-close when we merge it into master, thanks to magic \u2728 \u2728 \u2728 \n. This needs API Documentation.\n. Going to be push to the site after the next release.\n. @laszlokorte You are correct, those are the two exact issue. you are welcome to open PR with fixes like this.\n. Hi @nicoonee I'm sorry to hear this but thanks for reporting this.\nDoes the table has spaces or any special character? I could replicate this issue on a table with spaces and only If I click them on the sidebar, it this also your case?\n. This was already fixed on hosted.\n. Hi @laszlokorte we were aware we had this issue before, I tried to upload a svg and it works. no error, no nothing. just no thumbnail, but no thumbnail missing, it says, \"plain\". I wonder what was your error exactly? Just to refresh my mind.\nEither way I will take a look at this.\n. Okay, so I found something related, when the svg has a xml header, it will cause an error, but when it's not presented it will not. (note to self)\n. Would be relying on the file extension to determine their mime type a better option? creating a table of extension and their mime types could be a good reason, although it may not be real.\nit will never be perfect, though, as an example we have an svg and by it's content finfo doesn't know what it is.\nWhat about using finfo and a mime type tables and if they mismatch, use the mime type tables information.\nIs it worth it?\n@benhaynes what do you think about this?\n. Okay so we are having different issues here, I haven't replicate the issue where I get an svg mime type (image/svg+xml) correct instead of always text/plain. what I'm saying here is that apparently svg has not default content. as it will dependent from where it was created. some got xml at the headers some don't. As I never got any svg I have upload to get me the correct svg, so this make it possible of the multiple header it can have.\nSo anyway, I will work on this one, because it's definitely a issue.\nIf you would like as I said you can always open a PR.\nThanks.\n. We can't crop a svg, can we? we should create an image as svg thumbnail, as it may be used as a preview, and most likely to be supported without much hassle.\nAre we really want an svg file to represents itself as thumbnail? we can do that and I see the point, that will add a new level of, this is a svg render itself it's not, look for the thumbnail.\nmaybe I'm wrong, but let's do testing here.\n. @benhaynes apparently GD library doesn't support SVG but Imagick does, but all this library requires to be installed.\nI will do some research about this, but what can be sure it's that Directus upload the svg with no problem, the thumbnail is what we need to look for a solution.\nCopying the same file twice wouldn't be a good idea though. Although we can do it's replace the thumbnail with the same image if the image is an svg, or something similar.\n. it hasn't been resolved yet. Until we figure it out how to do that, let's open a feature ticket for handling SVG thumbnail.\nIn other hand, I will fix the uploading issue, as this is the main issue.\n. I tried to upload svg the one with and witout html header, and no problem uploading, updating the file info method solve this issue along the way.\nIf someone happen to replicate the issue again, let us know.\n. Hi @huyderman, it was fixed on the development branch.\nYou man want to use the dev branch and try it and let us know if that works for you too.\nThanks,\n. @huyderman thanks for letting us know, this will be in master soon.\n. hey @laszlokorte, we are continuing working on development branch, it very possible everything has lots of unfinished works.\nSo Thanks for reporting this I will take a look later, but development branch is not meant to be ready right now.\n. @laszlokorte the best branch you could use is the master, as development branch is all crazy in there right now. I would leave it open until it's fixed on the development branch, so I can remember this is an actual issue before release it.\n. We are working hard on bringing an up to date and complete documentation, while we clean and make Directus and its code better.\nThe state of development is live and in continuing development, expect much more, we are not going anywhere yet.\nAbout the \"dead code\" and \"not quite obvious\" comment, we have been working into that, so in couple of weeks this are going to be all fixed and well documented.\n. hey @laszlokorte I think the issue here may be the composer/vendor packages.\nTry this:\n1. Remove the vendor directory (api/vendor)\n2. Update the development branch with the latest (at least https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/bee32e3a3d9a31d233bfb37f856252a3c5d2cf23 when I pushed an update composer.lock file)\n3. run composer install again\nThis step should fix this issue.\nThere's an old migrations package version that was causing troubles with permissions.\nLet us know if it that fixed it for you.\n. I'm closing this. unless @laszlokorte reports that the previous comment didn't fix it for him.\n. @christophemarois I hope this hot fix works for you, while we work on the API responses we think will be best.\n. @laszlokorte I fixed this issue with this commit https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/b863e1029968a1aba26f00bf45a9e0b7712f0b71.\nLet us know if all good in your side.\nThanks for reporting this one.\n. I bumped into this the other day as well, so wasn't sure what was it, so I let it slide.\ncheckbox shouldn't be require at all, there's not good reason for that. I mean, if it's checked it will be 1 and if it's not well, it's 0 so it will always have value.\nI work around here to keep the \"mandatory check\", will be to add an option, in case this is something useful in some situation that I can't think of right now.\nI'm working on it.\n. This one https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/bf5235156a3d1918ae8c5f4f7b58120e4a130321 should do the trick.\n. > Permission = Soft & No Status: NULL ID\nThe issue there still the same if the column doesn't allow NULL.\nPermission = Hard: Delete Item\nPermission = Soft & No Null: Can't delete Item\nPermission = Soft & Null & No Status: NULL ID\nPermission = Soft & Status: Inactive\nWhat do you think?\n. @benhaynes this should do the fix: https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/93fe685a9f11cce7a9dd38d52bfd22233c989b92\n. I don't know if that's one of the issues he was experiencing, but that one fixed the only one I could replicate.\nWhat's a concern it's how directus_columns records are updated, more than anything, and we had related tickets to this issue: https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/1102 and https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/1091\n. hey @laszlokorte this https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/6a584235b22d6c94819dcd2b1f8ab11fd5ef8d7c should fix this issue.\n. Hey @laszlokorte I'm late on replying but now I'm focusing on the UIs.\nAfter I coulnd't replicate this issue, I want to check with you if after all these fixes lately are you still having this issue?\nwhy is the error on many_to_one UI? is there a M2M UI in that table?\n. I've not had luck replicating the issue, everything works as expected, BUT, maybe how we have been fixing issues on this UI probably it fixed along the way too. (Now that I tested with M2O instead of O2M)\n. Hello, @laszlokorte \nMost of this have been fixed on development (here https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/9ef64764a3c7f057984ef168bccc44338d18f71e), it hasn't been merged into master yet.\nThere has been some different bugs fixed with relational UI.\n. @laszlokorte oh, that's not good. I'm on it.\n. @laszlokorte you can now pull the last commit. it should work.\n. Hey @laszlokorte can you mind in sending me a schema for that, I want to try that. Either way I will try to replicate it on my own.\n. Side note @laszlokorte, is it okay to this be public?, if so, this will be an awesome Schema Template. \n. Thanks \ud83d\udc4d  Want to open a PR yourself if you feel like it, either way I can create one.\n. This was partially solved, as none settings are required. The rest will be addressed in this ticket #1023 \n. @laszlokorte right! this will be great.\n. Hi @laszlokorte apparently it does nothing. so, it's going to be removed.\n. @laszlokorte oh by the way on select it basically just let you choose an empty string as value. not modifying your table structure in no way. UI settings isn't not suppose to be to altering the table schema. or maybe not yet.\n. Hi @laszlokorte I couldn't replicate the issue I followed all your step and it did work as expected.\non a side note  {'10': \"X\", '20': \"Y\"} is a malformed JSON, I used double quote. just letting know. it's has nothing to do though.\n. @laszlokorte I've been trying to replicate this again after the recents changes but I can't replicate the selection failing.\nCan you check and let me know if still happening?\n. @laszlokorte master branch, and let us know.\n. Perfect, closing it.\n. @laszlokorte when you said \"required\" you mean checking \"Allow Null\"? if that was I got the issue.\n. This is related to this one #1181, that one should be also implemented in order to fix this one.\nWe are not actually validating the UI settings. on step closer to that.\n. https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/9868a82646cc33f4927373894a72c07eaa19eae2 is not the solution but it will prevent from crashing the app.\nThe validation will be taken care of in this ticket. #1023 \n. Hey @laszlokorte,\nGood point, I fixed it on one to many before, instead of M2O.\nValidating in the setting page will be addressed with this ticket https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/1023\n. @benhaynes it was fixed on M2O, and then I fixed it on M2O Typeahead that it was missing. https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/f9a422bed42dc11fbdda75a8dd49cb431e0c78b2\n. > TODO: Include Inactive is going to be visible_status_ids (same as M2O proper) ... @WellingGuzman is working on making this a set of checkboxes instead of a text input to reduce mistakes.\nThis will be done in a new UI or Options right now will be done in a Text Input, so this can be closed, and focus on the Checkboxes in a new ticket. @laszlokorte @benhaynes agree?\n. @laszlokorte apparently there's an issue with the wysiwyg library, but the thing the library allowed us to disable the editor, but it doesn't seem to be working.\n. > There is no point in creating a INT(100) column for referencing an INT(11) column. Then that foreign key column should also be made unsigned.\nHi @laszlokorte we are aware of this, so we have no plan to work on this right now, but I will open a new ticket with this information into Directus Wishlist.\nThanks,\n. That's correct, you're right. There's not actual meaning but for padding, but still has meaning.\nWhat I believe this needs to be optional parameter. I'm going to make it optional so the API doesn't required length for numeric types.\nAlthough ZEROFILL can not be set, we plan on doing that, accepting fields options such as ZEROFILL and UNSIGNED.\nThanks @laszlokorte \n. Okay @laszlokorte I decided to remove it as the other numerics value doesn't require it. Thanks for this one. we will implement fields options in the future versions.\n. > > Remove the write access of a required field but keep the read access:\n\n\nwhen editing an existing record which has the field already set can not be saved because \"error: field is required\"\n\nThis is logical, but we should probably not force the requirement if you can't edit it.\n\nI can't replicate this one, but maybe it was fixed along some fixes that was done today. did you get that error?\n\n\nGive back read access but not write access: Now the field can even be edited even though the user should not have access to do so\n\nThis is not good and needs to be fixed asap. Perhaps the permission value is being NULL'd somehow? @WellingGuzman can we look at this?\n\nSo, the catch here was that only blacklisted fields were enforce when the user do not have \"big\" edit permission. I'm working on it to be enforce no matter what.\n\n\nRemove both read and write access: Now the record can be saved without the user seeing the field at all\n\nThis makes sense.\n\nHmmm, what can be done here? it's what it should be expected, but what happen when the only field doesn't have read/write access? the problem is how it looks like an empty page that can lead to think it's hung.\n. Field permissions are saved when you click the switches, I made a fix to not ask if you don't want to lose any data.\n. > @WellingGuzman \u2013 Did you turn off that message globally or only for this page?\nI turned off for model that didn't actually have unchanged attributes. (Still a work in progress)\n\n@WellingGuzman I'm not getting this \"are you sure you want to leave\" message any more... can you confirm it's still in there?\n\nIt's not happening anymore as it's being saved after you click the switch.\n. Hi @paragonie-scott thanks for the recommendation we help us make Directus more secure.\nTo be honest we've been aware of the use of uniqid() and we happen to address all this soon, we have been working on a lot of stuff and bug fixing right now.\nWe will take some time to work on security issues, which is also important.\n. hey @timbuckingham Thanks for reporting this I will take a look at this later today.\n. Sorry @timbuckingham I took too long to push this fix.\n. Thanks @geggleto!\n. @benhaynes should we leave this open until we change the media directory into storage? or wait to a future version?\n. @chrisys Thanks for reporting this I will take a look at this one.\n. hey @chrisys on Table Settings now you will see Hide List and Hide Input which are two separate things, Hide List will hide the field from being listed (ex. at the table listing) and Hide Input will hide it from being displayed on the editing page.\nI hope this helps, and let me know if you have any question.\n. Hey @melfnt Is there by any change STRICT mode enabled in your MySQL server? This is an issue we are having, there's nothing we can do right now, but ask you if it's possible to disable strict mode, it has been reported before #395.\nWe will see what we can do about this as this is an issue that's being reported so many times.\n. Hi @melfnt we will be work on that, I'll close this ticket so this will be solve in #395 \n. Hi @lukasumlandt Thanks for reporting this, but what did you mean by \"set another backend url than productive-page url\"?\nI'm sorry I do not understand the step to reproduce the issue.\n. If I understood correctly what you are trying to do is have the Directus admin in one domain and having your frontend site in another domain.\nDirectus doesn't have any \"frontend\" part. any frontend solutions should be code by yourself.\nThe global settings project name it's just a quick way to jump into your site whatever that could be, which is it's not attached to Directus in anyway.\nAm I missing something?\n. Amazing @katywings that would be a huge help.\nYou can duplicate the English Translation file into de.json and start translating.\nDanke sch\u00f6n :)\n. Good question, I believe formal will be best.\nNow that you brought this to topic we should be considering this for all translation.\nAny thoughts @benhaynes?\n. @TigerHix if you spot some string that aren't for the enduser, let us know. \n. Hey @perazzi we would be happy too :)\n\nDoes directus also provide multi-language support for the content?\n\nDirectus has a Translations UI that let you create different copy of the content in different languages. You can take a look at how it works here: https://github.com/directus/docs/blob/master/03-interfaces/02-relational.md#translation-o2m\nHope it's that what you mean by multi-language support for the content.\nLet us know.\n. Thanks for letting us know. @benhaynes I edited your message to update to paths.\n@AeonZh That would be awesome \ud83d\udc4d  Go ahead! we would love to see new translations :)\n. Hey @lapa182, you can find the json here https://github.com/directus/directus/blob/develop/api/locales/en.json (English). I think I misinterpreted what you said @lapa182, it's all good! \ud83d\udc4d . Great @alvsconcelos! any question let us know!. are we talking about visible_columns? :)\nThis is needed along with #1023 (Validating UI)\n. I will review all the UI to see which one requires to be set before work.\n. Hey @Wedjaa Thanks for this PR.\nI like this, and where this is going.\nI don't know if this is done yet, but it doesn't work well, every time I tried to use the installer module (it should be called Command will fit best, I believe), the user always end up being admin@directus.com with password directus and the database, user and password in the config file there are always directus\nIf you can add some tests it will be great.\nBUT. We actually don't have any Code Style Standard set yet, but we are working on variation of PSR2, so until this is done here are my thoughts.\nThe major issue is that style changes:\n- Sometimes method have the curly braces at the same line, sometimes don't.\n- Indentation change from 2 to 4 spaces.\n- Method and Variable naming convention change from underscore to camel cases.\nI really do like this and I'm giving you my feedback and as we are having more Contributions, we are going to have a time for creating a CONTRIBUTIONS GUIDELINES.\nLet me know how this is going and what are the next step.\nI had some ideas on how this could be done, and one that I think is missing in a way to Register command instead of being auto-loaded directly.\nSomething like this: \nphp\n$commands = get_commands();\nforeach($commands as $command) {\n    register_command($command);\n}\nThis is great, keep them coming.\n. Amazing @Wedjaa, no pressure. We value this contributions.\nYou saved a google search there :)\n. Hey @Wedjaa,\nAs long as you feel that this PR is working, we can add more commands on the go when you got the ideas what else could be a command.\nAs questions are a new feature, if you feel like it you can do it into another PR, but if you want some ideas or inspiration or how someone else did this, you can check Symfony Console Compoenent QuestionHelper\nI will test what's done so far, sorry for the delay but I didn't thought it was ready to test, my bad.\n. That sounds perfect @Wedjaa, I will merge this then. any thoughts @benhaynes ?\n. Hello @RabbitMC,\nCan you give us more information to replicate the issue? Server OS, Directus version/branch/commit, etc.\nYou can read our issue report template\n. Thanks @RabbitMC I'm going to work on this one.\n. @RabbitMC I pushed a fix that will solve this problem.\n. Good catch!\n. Hello @RabbitMC,\nThanks for reporting this, I couldn;t replicate this in any other major browser but on Safari, was it same to you?\nThe commit 6c7fd21 should have fixed this.\n. I've spent some time trying to replicate this issue with no luck, I follow the steps and I get the expected behavior and the icon on the top right corner also works.\nAm I missing something? that's not part of the steps described above?\n. Thanks @RabbitMC, if you happened to bump into it, or something else let us know.\n. Thanks @niseku, remember you can always send a Pull Requests with fixes like this.\nI will take a look at this, thanks again for reporting this\n. A fix have been commited here https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/28fc43c321548175de7c56333dee80d3cdeda636 and it's available on the development branch.\n. Hi @niseku, nav_listed is not used by the web app right now.\nI fixed the toggling issue, it's only on development branch.\n. @niseku Thanks for reporting this, this should fix the problem.  https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/5902327389cf094d00cba2df280347772a10fb99\n. Hi @niseku thanks for reporting this. The issue should've be fixed by 95f0f24\n. This is great, Thanks @katywings.\nAnother option can be let's keep it here until it's done. :)\n. Even Better. Let's merge it.\n. We cannot merge this directly to development via GitHub, let's wait until we merge all into master.\n. @katywings there's nothing wrong. We can merge to any branch locally, but through GitHub, is not possible. If it's possible I really would like to know how to. :)\nKeep the good work, nothing wrong with your PR.\n. @katywings You did it right, I was the one wrong, danke sch\u00f6n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. Thank you @jonhershon for your contribution.\n. Thanks for reporting this, we've moved the locales to the api directory so that's why it was missing. we have been changing how and where we put the locales lately.\nCommit: https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/79403c39504065c0075f39c06ffd653e315a97e0\nLet me know if that works for you too.\n. Hey @christophemarois, no a problem we have change it on the development branch, and I was trying to hot fixes but forgetting that the path was change it all over the place.\nThanks.\n. Good point, thanks.\n. @benhaynes it will throw an error if you do it through the API, but the UI will enforce validation.\nSo this got me thinking we need an output and input formatting, because if we want to avoid the issue we will have to convert it to 0, but that wouldn't work for an API response, because the actual value is null. makes sense?\n. You are right, we talked about making the \"Internals error\" friendly. so I will think about this when we are organizing the API (#1105). what do you think?\n. Commit https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/fd64d1a08b4b45e1f9a53aa31f9dc8f84c54884a didn't work as expected so it was undone by this commit: https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/610790ba9051baa864e4e48c794ee578049596fe\n. I did it through the long way, and make the UI decide it. so checkbox are only required if mandatory option is set to true.\n. I'm testing this out, I've not find any issue so far.\nWe can close it, and if something rises we can re-open it. @benhaynes what do you think?\n. @benhaynes right, checkbox UI should save 0 or 1 and it's not required unless you set the mandatory option on.\n\nAs a new feature, if ALLOW NULL is on, then we should have a UI Option that says:\n\nThis sounds good, @laszlokorte what do you think?\n. Hi @laszlokorte,\nThanks for reporting this, but we've already fixed this in the development branch. https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/c9e6fe5edb09850dc9db30b1ee9d1f8d44ddfbe9\n. > why? I do not think it makes sense?\nHey @laszlokorte, It's a bug. I'm working on it.\n. > 1. introduce a type conversion layer that converts all stringy values received from the API into their correct types in a central place. How about adding a type property to the UIComponent's variables object:\n@laszlokorte care to open a PR for that?\n. > For columns that are indeed numeric the problem that the footer is visible even if the checkbox is not checked still persists because '0' is saved to the DB and then by javascript evaluated to true (because non-empty string)\nI made a hotfix for this solution, as number values are not casting constantly it can be sure when is a number or a string, so we can casting or do your solution. if you mind you could open PR for that.\nThanks,\nLet me know if it fixes it for you.\n. Thanks, @laszlokorte.\n. I will close this as the issue was solved, but you can merge your PR whenever is ready.\nThanks\n. This commit https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/09238f9a1beebcebf042ad85a91b206e7996950b should do it, let me know.\n. Thanks @laszlokorte, closed!\nThanks as always for all this reports, if you happen to find anything else, I know you won't hesitate \ud83d\udc4d \n. Hey @laszlokorte, I fixed the problem the select tag was missing its name. here's the commit: https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/3cde6832cc67de2350ae11a3117f3dc9c2da612b.\nThis should've fixed the problem, tested and worked.\n. Great to hear @laszlokorte.\n. This is awesome, Thanks @laszlokorte can't wait to see this done.\n. > I really like the idea of of moving (core) UI default values to a variable object... would help clean that up a lot. @WellingGuzman what do you think?\nI like the idea, this will a good implementation, and we will always be sure that its default value will be the fallback at the end.\n\nI think such values should be encoded as the correct datatype on the server. But I am really not comfortable with the Zend framework so I could need some help there.\n\n@laszlokorte I can help you with any question you may have.\n\nI saw that the AclAwareTableGateway has an parseRecordValuesByMysqlType method that takes care of it but the DirectusMessagesTableGateway does not make use of it.\n\nTrue, We've plan on moving parseRecordValuesByMysqlType to the schema-specific class, so it can be accessible anywhere.\n. > These need to be fixed for the strict equality checks to work. I think converting those values on the client side is not a good solution. The server should already provide them in the right way.\n@laszlokorte True, that's our main subject to solve regards the strict mode on mysql as well, everything should be handle by the server and the server should provide the right type.\nThe client should trust that the value are in its expected type, before being skeptical and cast it.\n. it sounds right @laszlokorte.\n@benhaynes I'm thinking 6.3.x. this is part of strict mode issue #395.\n. I squash and merged this already here (https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/0dcef772b9528d272f09788c60341c3beb509366), but I don't know if it possible to mark this PR as merged.\n. Still shows that you closed it. It will have been better to be mark  as merged. seems like we rejected it. \ud83d\ude1e \n. For me it looks like this: \n\n. haha, If you're cool, we're cool. \ud83d\ude03 \n. Thanks for reporting this:\n\nThe privileges settings (/settings/permissions/1) do not show the correct privileges\n\nI  checked and the API is returning string instead of numbers.\n\nIn the table settings the \"Required\" checkbox for columns that are NOT NULL in the DB is no longer force checked/disabled (UI: TextField, VARCHAR). Not sure if this is the supposed behavior.\n\nProbably still related, I'm going to look at this one.\n. @laszlokorte the permissions should be fix now.\n\nIn the table settings the \"Required\" checkbox for columns that are NOT NULL in the DB is no longer force checked/disabled (UI: TextField, VARCHAR). Not sure if this is the supposed behavior.\n\nI checked and yes, that's the expected behavior.\n. > Currently I am on the dev branch. Should I switch to master to get the latest fixes?\nNo, we fixes on development too. I just pushed those commits.\n\n@WellingGuzman for Textarea/TEXT the required checkbox is force checked if the column is NOT NULL in the database. And for some other UI/Datatypes as well. For me that looks inconsistent and should be unified.\n\nI'm going through all the UIs to check this out.\n. Hello @mercyg,\nWhat we want is to get all this php files into Twig templates (https://github.com/directus/directus/tree/master/installation/views)\nThose views are all used here: https://github.com/directus/directus/tree/master/installation/includes/Steps\nThanks for the interest, any help we will be around.\n. Make sure to add a warning message that alerts the user when an existing email belong to another existing user when they are trying to create a new user. (Ref #1983). Hello there @jbcoder,\nIs apache mod_rewrite installed?\n. Is there something in your logs? PHP logs or Directus log (api/logs)?\nI will try if I can replicate this issue.\n. Maybe it should've been RewriteBase /api instead. (I'm guessing)\n@laszlokorte is this something required by windows servers?\n. Thanks @laszlokorte. Great to hear @jbcoder \nI will add this into the .htaccess files.\n. Thanks @laszlokorte.\nI will add this in the documentation instead.\n. Thanks @laszlokorte, for helping out, it seems what you told him lead him to fix the server configuration problem.\n@jbcoder I assume you have already fixed your issue, if that's not the case let us know.\n. @Kakoum We've found the bug and fixed it.\nTables were being saved as nav_listed = 0 that prevented the table from being listed in the navigation (sidebar).\n. Thank you so much @TigerHix and @Gfast2.\n. We added a new WYSIWYG Interface https://github.com/directus/directus/pull/1430, similar to Medium, thanks to @rijkvanzanten . Still missing some features, but it's on the way to a more clean less buggy solution.. This commit should've fixed this.\nThe way to set the value list is by typing values separated by comma in the \"length\" field.\n. https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/030a2ec2f940da8520e249e8dd2206065906e9ea should fix this issue.\n. Hello @kamikazechaser, you must open request to http://feathub.com/directus/directus.\nYou can open both request for MongoDB and NodeJS server-side.\nWe have priority on nodeJS, we are polishing our PHP server side first, and making a better API design.\nIf you are onboard to help please let us know.\nFeathub - MongoDB Support\nFeathub - NodeJS API\n. This wasn't solved but was changed in 6.4, where the interface in users not longer hash the input value in the client side.. Thanks @iLama.\n. Thanks @EmilienCo we appreciate it.\nthe translation_x was meant to have prepend the translation word in front of it. I will take care of that, if that's okay.\n. Hello @YounessTayer What exactly are you trying? how are you creating the user?\nHave you tried this: https://github.com/directus/docs/blob/master/04-developer/06-schema-guide.md#manually-setting-passwords\nPerhaps this:\nbash\n$ php bin/directus user:password -e \"<your-email>\" -p \"<new-password>\"\nLet me know if that works for you.\n. Hello @YounessTayer did you manage to solve the issue?\n. Hey @YounessTayer I assumed you solved the the issue, otherwise we will open the ticket.\n. Thanks @niseku, I pushed a patch to the master branch that should fix this problem (7f4937b) let us know if that worked for you.\n. Thanks for reporting this, I'm pushing a hotfix right now.\n. Thanks @EmilienCo \n. Thanks @EmilienCo for the contribution.\n. Thanks again @neosign , I could replicate the issue and push a patch, hoping this would solve your problem as well.\n. Hey there @realpablodias, thanks for the report.\nI tried your steps and unfortunately I couldn't replicate it, is there something else I need to be aware to replicate it?\n. Hey @realpablodias, sorry for the delay,\nI created a new fresh install as well, and I am now replicating the issue, I will fix this as soon as possible.\nThanks for all the information.\n. @realpablodias let me know if that fix works for you.\n. Excellent! Glad to hear. \n@realpablodias anything else let us know :)\n. Not good, @beevelop thanks for letting us know. Working on a fix asap.\n. Hey @beevelop I pushed a fix, let me know if that worked for you. see #1259 \n. Thanks @beevelop, I will push a fix as soon as possible.\n. Hi @luissantos,\nThanks for reporting this, I couldn't replicate the issue can you tell us more about the table schema of both table, Table X and the table is the one to many related to.\nWhen exactly this happen? after clicking save? or when you choose the item?\n. This is not good, How is your server like? Version, Apache/NGINX, OS?\nI'm working on these issues now, thanks again for reporting all this.\n. Hey @luissantos we have been unable to replicate this issue.\nCan you please give us the schema you are using with Directus? (You can avoid all the unrelated tables that aren't directus_)\nThanks\n. Thanks for the schema @luissantos , I'm going to try to replicate it using your schema.\n. Hey @luissantos I finally could replicate the issue, let me know if this commit worked for you too.\n. This should have been fixed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/0ba920ebad760dde85225cb2f6a7b1a8a4b6b126 and https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/0e444e6a943d7054ab0686cd7390915ea2bbe542.\n. Can you confirm this still happening to you? I couldn't replicate it. (lil bit late) but which steps did you do to reproduce this?\nThanks, and sorry for the delay with this one.\n. Hey @luissantos we have solved this issue already it was related to the data_type being set to null. (https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/1d3dedef91680c141d995cfa1f8bfe90e2d357f5)\nIf you still having the issue let us know, and we will open the ticket again.\n. @luissantos after days I could replicate the issue: uppercase and linux. Linux is case sensitive, so Products and products is not the same.\nSomething to notice is that this can be change, but Directus shouldn't care much about it.\nMySQL identifier case sensitivity\n. Thanks for reporting this @luissantos as we have a open similar ticket for vagrant  on his own repo https://github.com/directus/directus-vagrant/issues/16 I will close this and will address the problem over there.\nThis is a odd issue to me, I can't replicate it, I was thinking it was something to do with Windows or Vagrant version, but apparently is not.\nThanks for the detailed report. I will try to find what is causing this issue.\n. @csprance You can get a invitation here: http://slack.getdirectus.com\n. Hey @woodscreative,\nYou are using hosted, which is a \"compiled\" version, we merge all js into app.min.js but all that left are their interfaces html in app/core/uis, you can see an example here: https://github.com/directus/directus/blob/master/app/core/uis/textarea.js\nWe can help you get started creating a new interface, or understanding one. You are welcome to join us in our slack channel http://slack.getdirectus.com.. @woodscreative you probably downloaded from build branch, which has not .js files in app/core/uis only .html. Thanks @laszlokorte again for the report.\nWe've been having a hard time trying to replicate these issues related to relational UIs, it has been reported similar issues recently.\nI will try one more time and see if I can replicate these.\nThanks as always.\n. @laszlokorte I'm not still able to replicate it. Any help on which steps should I take to replicate it will be helpful.\nThanks.\n. Another thing @laszlokorte try get the branch updated and let me know if still happen.\n. hey @laszlokorte we solved this issue with this https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/1d3dedef91680c141d995cfa1f8bfe90e2d357f5 commit\nI'm closing the ticket, if you still having issue let me know and I will open the ticket again.\nThanks\n. Hey @Marco1886, What do you mean? Not showing on the listing or the input?\n. @Marco1886 This https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/50692320c2d28425818241c939339160028fe3b1 commit should have fix the issue.\n. Hey @Marco1886 something to know is that, 00 seconds are not shown on Chrome.\nAnd the numbers being disabled is another Chrome thing. BUT I'm glad you find out. I will push a patch for it asap.\nThanks\n. @Marco1886 This commit should have fix the issue. \n. @Marco1886 Great \ud83c\udf89 \n. Thanks @Marco1886 for the report, we appreciate it.\nI will take a look at the issue.\n. @Marco1886 did this issue still persist? I wonder if only happened when you first try to log in? then the second time works.\n. Thanks @timonmat, I'm working on a fix, I could replicate the issue.\n. @Marco1886 @timonmat something to notice that I haven't told you, is that this is happening because the new group doesn't have permission to read any field from directus_users and this will bring a bug that will select <empty> from any_table\nGiving the current group the right permission will solve the issue.\nWhat I'm working on is making sure the error it's more friendly AND giving the correct default permission to any new users group.\n. @Marco1886 absolutely.\nBut you can give the group permission using the first user (Admin).\n. This commit and this one should at least avoid showing that exception and it will automatically log out the user.\nMake sure that the group has the needed permission.\nWe still will work on permission in the next releases, any suggestion or issue that may rise let us know.\n. By the way MySQL supports JSON data type as for 5.7.8. https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/json.html\n\nAs of MySQL 5.7.8, MySQL supports a native JSON data type that enables efficient access to data in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) documents. The JSON data type provides these advantages over storing JSON-format strings in a string column.\n. UI Options are stored as json in directus_columns in 6.4.x. Thanks for the report I will take a look at this now.\n. Hey @timonmat, I pushed a patch that should fix the issue.\n\nLet us know if it worked for you too.\n. @timonmat Amazing!\n. Hello @timonmat, Thanks for pointing this out.\nThis docs is outdated, we changed active to status\nit should be like this now: https://example.com/api/1/tables/table/rows?status=1\n. @timonmat the documentation have been updated.\nhttp://getdirectus.com/api/tables/rows\nClosing the ticket, anything else let us know.\n. :) Great, any other question you may have do not hesitate.\nPS: We are working on more filters to be implemented soon.\n. Hey @podlebar thanks for pointing this out. I'm updating this asap. @podlebar Fixed with https://github.com/directus/api-docs/commit/3f35b746c70dff3acd244251d990ed04aacafa6e and https://github.com/directus/api-docs/commit/5470bda0233ec275b8daad5dad713425f43b7242, Thanks.. Hello @Zaelot thanks for reporting this, I'm going to take at look at the issue and fix it as soon as possible.\nI will add Helsinki now.\n. @Zaelot Helsinki is already on the list: https://github.com/directus/directus/blob/master/api/core/functions.php#L576\nYou are welcome to add more.\n. @Zaelot Please pull the recent master branch and try again, it should be fixed by now.\nYou error on the screenshot it seems to be related to the configuration.php file not being saved correctly, it should look like this: https://github.com/directus/directus/blob/master/tests/api/Util/Installation/mock/configuration.sample.php#L47\nDoes the installation process worked normally?\n. Thanks @RijkvanZanten we really appreciate new languages support :)\n. Hello @DaveBlooman Thanks for reporting this, I have two question:\n1. Are you using the actual tag at 6.3.3 or an specific branch?\n2. Which browser are you using?\n. This was fix here: https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/f2a06e30bcf6f53ef2b521a8943d9413dbe6651 (probably)\n. @DaveBlooman It's happening because there's a new version, and there's an error there. check the this commit it should fix your problem.\nUpdate your Directus to 6.3.4\n. Let me rephrase myself, there's a new version, and we added a notification that tell user there's a new version available, so there's an error using the notification object, because it was using uppercase instead of the lowercase filename.\nHope that this solve your problem.\n. Amazing! @QSDev Thank you very much!\n. Hello @RabbitMC,\nRemoving the error persists if you removed or add the RewriteBase?\nCan you try this https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/889#issuecomment-249789534?\n. Perfect @RabbitMC, anything else let us know.\n. Thanks for reporting this @DaveBlooman , I'm working on it.\n. Hello @DaveBlooman, I push a fixes for the issue here: https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/9039d68cbf2474660f88b65615c2449467306164, hope it works for you too.\nIt's only on development, but it will be soon release.\n. Amazing @DaveBlooman, great to hear. As always, anything else, let us know.\nClosing it.\n. Hey @DaveBlooman, that's the data the table.update is sending?\nI'm going to take a look at this and get back to you, asap.\n. What's inside the output it seems to be the directus_users update data.\n. Hello @mgkeen, Thanks for reaching out, we have changed it to status.\nCalling /api/1/tables/[table]/rows?status=1 should work, and return only the active rows.\nRead here: http://getdirectus.com/api/tables/rows\n. Thanks for the report @RabbitMC, Working on a fix.\n. Hey @RabbitMC this commit https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/927616443b518ea3059289a9b53ecc9f2d66dc9e should fix the issue.\nThanks again for reporting this.\n. @KingKarrow any specific error? any logs in api/logs?. @KingKarrow can you send me a pdf that I can use to reproduce this error, I tried couple of PDFs without any problem.\nIt seems you have Imagick already installed, so we can take that out of the way.. Hey @KingKarrow, so it happens to be the other way around it was an issue creating the pdf thumbnail, so it was about having Imagick installed.\nI'm working on a fix, get back to you when it's done.. Note: I have experienced another issue, apparently on Mac OS X, Imagick is having issue reading files binary data, while on ubuntu there's not issue at all.. Hi @timonmat, I'm working on it.\n. Hey @timonmat this commit https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/8b726d7cfd8ca2372e493abd43ddabe7c4e293b0 should fix the issue.\nLet me know.\n. Hey @timonmat Closing it. let me know if I didn't work and I will reopen it and work on it.\nThanks,\n. Hey @timonmat when you inspect the input element in devtools does it has the readonly attribute?\n. @timonmat thanks for reporting this, I'm going to work on it soon.\n. The soon about this was to implement it on 6.4.x I will close this ticket as we didn't mean to include it in 6.3.x.\nI'm sorry about not adding it in the recent minor version. I've hide the checkbox in 6.3.x to avoid confusion.. Hello @Ronnyrr,\nDid you commented out RewriteBase /? try to comment that line and see if it works. Otherwise let us know to help you fix your issue.\n. @Ronnyrr is your error 500 or 404? can you show me the message that your server throws?\nYou can take a look at this to test your mod_rewrite: https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/889#issuecomment-249789534\n. @Ronnyrr Oh so there's not issue with your mod_rewrite, the issue is in Directus, which version, branch are you using?\n. @Ronnyrr update your master branch by using git pull and let me know if it works for you now.\n. Click install anyway and try to log in and tell me what's the error, this means that there's still an issue with Directus. Check the logs /api/logs.\n. Doesn't seem that the install creates all the tables, is your database empty? or missing some tables? show me the tables that the database has.\n. Can you please give me more context of what's going on here?\nI see a log that says Statement could not be executed (42S02 - 1146 - Table 'directus.directus_tables' doesn't exist).\nSomething happens before you install? Are you making sure you are looking at the right database?\n. If possible, can you show me a screencast? I have no clue why if the table exists, zend-db (pdo) throws an error that it doesn't.\nCan you also take a look at the network tab while you are installing directus?\n. @Ronnyrr I will close this as this is not directly related to directus.\nI can still help you, if still necessary, on setting up Mod Rewrite.\n. hey @chrisformula any logs in api/logs? try to do the steps in this comment. Thanks @raygers for reporting the issue I will take a look and get back to you as soon as possible.\n. Hey @raygers I pushed a fix for this issue, let me know if it works for you.\n. Glad to heard \ud83d\udc4d , anything else let us know.\n. woot woot! Thanks @AeonZh \n. Hi @RabbitMC,\nUsing MANY TO ONE, you can quite do a One to One or kind of One to one or none.\nAre you having trouble with many to one UI? Because you can add a many to one on item to point to event and event will always be ONE TO ONE, as the event table will always point to only one item (OR None)\n```\nItem\n\n\nid\nname\n```\n\n```\nevent\n\n\nid\nname\nitem_id\n```\n\nin this case an event will always a relationship with one item, but the item can be in more event, unless you make the table column unique.\nThat's the solution that can be done with Directus UI.\nLet me know what you think, either way you can help us shape this new UI.\n. Great @RabbitMC, anything else, let us know.\n. Thanks @JackNUMBER for reporting this. We will work on a fix for this soon.\n. Thank you very much @JackNUMBER.\n. I like the contribution and we appreciate it, as I do not know how well are the update, hope you don't mind if I ask for opinion to @jonhershon and @christophemarois.\nI'd merge it either way, and we can update it later on if necessary.\n. This should've been fixed by now (development branch), otherwise we will re-open it.\n. Awesome @katywings. Thanks!\n. Hello @Rsmith919, I see you are using the build version, can you please use the development or master branch?\nWe are releasing the a new version patching this issue.\nI'm closing it as it's being fixed, but I'm aware of the problem on the build branch, and I'm going to release as soon as possible today.\nThanks for letting us know about this issue.\n. Thanks @michieltjuh11, I assume this all set. \ud83d\udc4d . Thanks @michieltjuh11, I will test this later today and see how it goes. Although it will probably be best to be in the configuration.php but either way I will merge it an take it from there if it's working as expected.\n. Hey @michieltjuh11 did you test this? it doesn't work for me. Am I missing something?\n. It seems there's a type in here and here\nAs well the options don't return any headers cors headers.\nLet me know if I'm missing or doing something wrong.\n. @michieltjuh11 can you please change it to merge with development branch instead of master?\n. Thanks for changing back to development, but still has a typo and it doesn't work correctly to me. does it work for you? if you wish I can merge it and take it from here. sounds good?\nThanks for this solutions.\n. As it is, I tried it but didn't work, then I fixed the typo, and add the header on options requests and worked.\nTrying to understand if there's more than a way to work. As I expected should work as I'm doing it, but I'm more interesting in know why is work for you and it doesn't to me.\n@michieltjuh11 are you on our Slack? we can talk more about it over there.\n. Great, Send me an email to: welling [at] rngr.org and I will send you and invitation. \n. Perfect @michieltjuh11, I didn't forget this PR. I will be merging it soon \ud83d\udc4d \n. Hey @RijkvanZanten,\nThanks for report this, I'm working on a fix right now, it will be pushed soon enough.\n. Hey @RijkvanZanten let me know if this commit 6b58d1c fixed the issue.\n. False alarm, I need to work with JSON as well. as it was to be expected normally.\n. @RijkvanZanten Amazing. I pushed another fix for when the request body was a json.\n. Yes, it's supported, but I'm afraid is not in the docs. Added a ticket for it https://github.com/directus/docs/issues/11\n. Hello @andreasotto, that's odd, we are curious was causing you the issue, I have tried with german characters before and it works, but again, I'm more interested in your issue so it can be solved.\nIs there any log file in api/logs? if so, can you share it?\n. Thanks for the information.\nWhat I can say for looking at the logs it seems you are using the build branch or the last release. \nSo what version/commit/branch are you using? There's s error that was fixed but isn't released yet.\nIm looking at the rest.\n. @andreasotto correct, that's one issue there the build branch has that bug in there, can you please use the development branch? we are trying to make a release as soon as possible, but we keep fixing some minor bugs.\n. @andreasotto also this is a MySQL issue, or probably a configuration issue with our connection.\nHY000 - 1300 - Invalid utf8 character string: 'T`\\xC3`\\xA4`st'\nAgain thanks for all this info, I'm taking care of this right now and see what we can do for this release.\n. That's not good, I'm on it, it should be a fix for this bug soon enough. I will let you know.\n. Hey @andreasotto I pushed a patch for this bug with this commit https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/78b17a2ab536a3e68901f07d056c9009fb921b62\nLet me know if that works for you too. make sure to delete or rename your current config.php and configuration.php if needed.\n. The thing is that it won't work with nginx locations, although it says mod_rewrite it meant for any rewrite available.\nIf you can tell me any steps to replicate it, I will love to fix it.\nWe test by creating a endpoint and if the endpoint return data AND status 200 =, it means it's working, no matter if it's apache mod_rewrite or nginx locations.\nWe probably can add that into the conditions. but don't know if it will make any difference.\n. About the mod_rewrite check, we need to update that title, because it doesn't actually check for whether the module is enable or not, but rather it checks for whether the routing is working.\nIn 6.3.x Directus doesn't allow to create table with special characters, by special anything out of alphanumerics, but Directus is going to support it in 6.4.x.\nAlthough you are able to create the table in the database then add permissions accordingly, and it should be set.. Thanks, forgot the migration use mysqli.\nPS. This is a reminder it should be switch to PDO some day.\n. Hey @andreasotto That looks amazing, any help you may need to get this done as UI, let us know to help as much as we can :)\n. This could also be a good idea for an extension for designing pages :)\n. This interface will replace the current wysiwyg library, which means it's not worth trying to fix it.\nI'm sorry I'm closing this, because as soon as we change to the new interface, this may be not an issue, or this still an issue that we are not longer trying to solve as the library itself has some issue that we are not willing to take time to solve it, but to switch to a new library.. Hey @andreasotto, the /api/1/auth/request-token is a POST endpoint. What are you trying to do? because when you are logged in, you can use the API as expected without any authorization required.\n\nAdditionally the .svg image from the html content in the page above is missing (broken link).\n\nAre you requesting directly from your browser? the file exists on the repo. I'm going to take a look at it.\n. Weird, can you confirm that you have that the file exists on your filesystem? and can you show me the 404 not found requests?\n. @andreasotto understood, it makes sense.\nAlso were you able to use the request token api endpoint correctly?\n. No, it's not possible, when logged in, you can go to you user page and get it from there.\nI will close the ticket as the broken link was fixed and I will add a note in the documentation about the POST request.\n. Hey @cedricve,\nThanks for your interest in Directus, let's help you out as much as I can.\n\n\nmod_rewrite isn't found (but it's builtin in Nginx).\n\n\nIt's built int, but as nginx doesn't support .htaccess, you have to create the locations on your server config file. You can read mroe here: https://github.com/directus/docs/blob/master/04-developer/02-configuration-nginx.md\n\n\nI have to disable strict mode of mysql (but I'm not able to do this).\n\n\nHow are you not being able to disable it? a project requirements?\n. Great @cedricve, that's good news. anything else let us know.\n. Hey @cedricve, glad that you are enjoy Directus.\n\nIs there any way to have public API endpoints? I will have pages or items which should be available for every visitor, authenticating those request is overkill.\n\nYou have to authenticate any requests, but we can work on something about this.\n\nStability: as far I've seen the system is stable, however sometimes I get strange errors (at random times), are you aware of this?\n\nWhat strange errors? You can open ticket about specifics issue and we can address them, sometimes there can strange errors.\n\nUser groups: this is not very intuitive, I've created a new group called Editor, added some rights, and tried to signin. It seems to work but I receive lots of errors (no permissions). I've solved this by granting most of permissions on the directus internal tables. However this isn't intuitive and requires some debugging to setup.\n\nWhat errors? we can work on it if you detailed all of them. Yes, if you are logged in, with a new group there's some internal table that need to be set for the user to work with, we have been working to make some pages clear in the new few minor version.\n\nBookmarks: what's the purpose for this? It's not completely clear for me.\n\nYou can save a state of a listing page, let's say you have a posts table, and you want a bookmark all posts that are in draft for quick access, you save a bookmark of all the posts with draft status.\n\nIs this a funded project, how many developers? If I will start using this I want to have some assurance.\n\nWe are not ~~getting~~ going anywhere, We guaranteed an active development for a long time.\n\nDo you develop custom features (fixed price, or hour rate)?\n\nYes, we do.\n\nCustom endpoints: I'v seen that there is a possibility to add custom endpoints to the API. However this isn't documented so far. Are you planning to do this?\n\nYes, we have planned to update our docs as much as possible in the new few weeks.\n. > Welling means that \"we are no going anywhere\" ;)\nOh boy haha, well yeah, thanks you replied on time..\n. @cedricve I will close this ticket. Any further question please join us on our Slack http://slack.getdirectus.com/\n. Hey @artf,\nThanks for the PR, can you please change it from ../storage/uploads to /storage/uploads so I can merge it?\n. Thank you @artf \n. Hey @airbenich, Thanks for reporting this issue.\nif there's any log files in api/logs, please show me what's inside.\nI tried on master branch without any luck.\n. Yes that's the problem, I have been stretching the days to release the new version with this fix.\nCan you please use the master branch while I work on the release?\n. Hey @airbenich, I'm far from a computer, please use development branch it should be fixed there.\nI will inform you as soon as I fix it today and release the new version.\nThank you for using Directus :)\n. @airbenich master branch is updated and 6.3.5 was released. it should be good to go now. Otherwise let us know.\n. can you share you logs (api/logs) again? I want to see if there's the same issue you are having or another one.\n. Hey @airbenich, looking at your logs I want to see what's on line 513 in this file /var/www/vhosts/domain/directus/api/core/Directus/Bootstrap.php:513 I'm wondering because I do not have a foreach in there, and I want to make sure you have the latest code.\n. Thanks, I just confirmed I wasn't looking at the master branch, I apologies.\n. Hey @airbenich can you join our Slack (http://slack.getdirectus.com) so I can help you over there more personally.\nI want to see what value is $path storing.\n. Hey @doughnet which version are you using?\nI'm taking a look now, at least it should be working on Single File UI.. I've tested on 6.3.5, it worked, and we do not have the options for multiple files. (I will add a note for adding it)\nCan you please give a step by step to replicate it?. you darn right @benhaynes, Thanks \ud83d\udc4d working on it.. also it does supports MIME Type and extension.. weird, what file are you trying to upload? I'm out of ideas what could it be.. @doughnet I want to you let you know I keep trying to replicate without no luck, I will get back to you with a fix as soon as I replicate it.. @doughnet This has been a long way since we were discussing this problem, I'm not still able to reproduce it, and probably a long the way was fixed for you too. can you confirm this?. I will close this, Assuming this was fixed in some way as it seems to be working. (I can't reproduce this error) Please let us know if still happening to you.. Thanks @jhyle, I will take a look at it later today.. Hey @jhyle expect a release soon, probably by tomorrow.. Hey @tdiddi,\nTo request a user token you have to perform a POST request to http://pseudo.url/api/1/auth/request-token with your email and password as data. (email=myemail@mail.com&password=secret)\nLet me know if that works for you.. You can read a similar here using curl: http://getdirectus.com/api/overview/authentication. Great, we will update that part of the docs, so it's not confusing anymore.\nThanks!. We do not support IIS yet, we haven't had the chance to work on a IIS Server.\n@PolywickStudio Do you mind giving us a hand there? I could try to convert it to webconfig, but I will need someone to confirm it is working.. I will follow what you did in a future release and try to make it work under IIS.\nAny other issue you may have let us know. I myself couldn't try it as I'm not on Windows, but I will get my hands in one to try this myself soon.\nThanks.. Thanks @PolywickStudio I will on a fix today.. Hey @PolywickStudio, does by any change the table you are creating has capital letter?. @PolywickStudio we have being peacefully arguing this recently, but some people like using Uppercases and lowercase combine in a table name, and how the database allow it, I think we should. The issue is with MySQL though, but should've a fix for it soon enough.\nYou can try using lowercase and letting me know if that works for you, so I can be certainly sure the issue is with the table name (uppercase/lowercase). Hey @Ronnyrr can you please show me a screenshot of you ONETOMANY column relationship settings. And/Or the record on directus_columns.. Hi @Ronnyrr, What's on your relationship options (see image below with the arrows)?\n\n. I think we both are not understanding ourselves haha. I'm sorry I meant clicking on the arrows and whats the relationship values. \ud83d\ude03 . Hey @Ronnyrr, what I thought, the related column field is a new column where the current table ID is going to save its ID in the related table. so you have to create a new column in categories to stores it.\nAlthough it seems you want a many to many can categories be in more than just one posts? or category unique to one post alone?. Did we merge the PR? I don't think so, the PR wasn't full solution to this one, as this is heavily on the frontend. the PR solved the problem on the server.\nThe state of this is IDLE.. Closed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/bddf1577aed6036852c64bca8556ca9f4dd4eebf\nWe omitted the option to let the user to turn ON the account, now it will enable the user and update the new data.. Hey @cedricve,\nCan you share the logs? (api/logs), also what's the junction table configuration? (it got chopped off in the screenshot). There's possibly your problem The default value is directus_activity.\nYou have to create a junction table, let's say homepage_slideshow with two column beside id to store the homepage table id and the file id.\nYou can read a bit more here: https://docs.getdirectus.com/6.3.6/#Multiple_Files_(M2M). Hey @cedricve, If I understand correctly, Directus supports sorting by dragging and dropping, the table needs to have a column named sort (int) and you would be able to sort.. Yeah, @cedricve, we are trying to address all this in the new redesign in the next couple of versions.\nAny suggestion to make this more intuitive?. hmm, the API seems to not be getting any rows parameter. I will take a look and see if can replicate.\nDid it work at first, but now it's not working giving you that error?. the request data looks correct, thanks, I'm checking the code, there's must the problem. I will get back to you asap.. Hey @cedricve try to pull this https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/2f77f2eb98eb3f1573ce1587ccef927cb0c25590 and let me know if it works.. Hey @cedricve what commit are you on? what's on your /usr/share/nginx/www/production/zwemschooltje/api/api/api.php:741?\n. Can you clear your browser cache? Can make sure the commit (https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/2f77f2eb98eb3f1573ce1587ccef927cb0c25590) is applied.. Glad to hear @cedricve.. Hey @cedricve I will see what I can do with this Editor, it has been a fight with the library.\n@benhaynes is going to create a new one, using a new library that will be a better fit.\nIn the meantime I'll see what I can do.. We apologies, but we are removing this library used in the interface. So we are not longer trying to solve any issues this library may have, which can take up much time trying to see why is broken, which wasn't developed by us.\nPlease go #1242, where are talking about the new interface.. Hey @ValonK,\nI'm working on this.\nThe docs is incorrect it's actually a POST request. thanks for pointing that out.\nTo upload a new file you need three provide three values:\njson\n{\n    \"name\": \"image.png\",\n    \"type\": \"image/png\",\n        \"data\": \"base64content\"\n}\nThe data content has to be in this format data:<mime-type>;base64,<data-content> so it will look  something like this: data:image/png;base64,ThisIsABase64Content\nI'm working to allow just the base64 content, because the mime type must has been already provided.\nHope this works for you.\nI added a response to stackoverflow as well. Yeah, that's a bug on our side, I'm about to push a fix for it on development branch.\nBut you can solve it by prefixing data:image/jpg;base64, to GetBaseImageData()\nLike this: \"data\", \"data:image/jpg;base64,\" + GetBaseImageData() (If that doesn't work on C# at least you get the idea \ud83d\ude04 )\n. Great to hear! In the next version you would've to add that, but still will work if you add it. \ud83d\udc4d . Hey @john-kurkowski, would you care to share the code you are using to trigger this issue/bug?. Thanks for the snippet @john-kurkowski, I will be working on it, some time today.. This has been fixed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/f139bf3110b7d61a5e3574373a523122d86d6064. Thank you @duncanhsieh \ud83d\udc4d . Nice! @Alxmerino I just want one thing before merge, can you send a PR to the development branch?. Great. Sorry I'm on my phone, it wasn't clear to me it was to development branch. I will merge it.\nThanks.. Hey @RijkvanZanten I pushed a fix https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/14a608071579b5cfa4b5e12a04fb18d2b0865855\nLet me know if that works for you.. Hey @cedricve, it's all good, keep them coming :)\nBut what's not good is the bug, so I see the file id is returned but there's not data related to it.\nI'm going to give a look and get back to you.. Hey @cedricve, please pull the last commit from master, it should fix the problem, either way let me know.. Thanks @duncanhsieh, I can't test this, but I will trust it fixes the third-party library.\n. Hey @sanpoChew, thanks for reporting this.\nIt should've created the auto increment id column when you create table from the Directs admin. Is there any warning or error in your logs (/api/logs)?. Thanks for the info, that's expected if there's not primary key, I will try to dig a bit more into this, but I've not been able to replicate this issue under MacOS, Apache and PHP 5.6.\nI will get back to you as soon as I get something.. Hey @sanpoChew I have pushed a fix, try and let me know if that works for you.. @sanpoChew Thanks for the confirmation.. Hey @cedricve , I've not been able to reproduce it.\nWhat's the http request raw data? it is working for me using Postman.. Glad to hear, if it pops out again, let us know.. Hey @cedricve, you can get the /example endpoint by going to your-host/api/example.\nI added a ticket to add documentation on how this work. https://github.com/directus/docs/issues/13. oh yeah, you have to remove the _ from _example so the file is called example.php instead of _example.php. all files starting with _ are ignored.. We don't have any solution for update the core files yet unless you are using git, if so, you can pull the latest commit on any branch. You can also download the latest version replacing all the core files keeping in mind that /customs, /storage api/config.php and api/configuration.php can be overwritten and those are probably all the files that are not part of the core files in your installation.. You are welcome to join our slack channel for any help upgrading Directus.. Hey @jhyle what's the name of your column E-Mail-Adresse?\nThis is an issue with Zend-Db we will try to do our best and find a solution, but feel free to report this on their repository.. Thanks, I will have to take a Zend Db to fix this issue. I will get back to you as soon as I have a fix for this.. @jhyle This has been an unsolved issue  in ZendDB, so as far as I know there's never been solved. \nI did a hotfix for a older version which probably can work for you: https://github.com/WellingGuzman/zend-db/tree/directus\nWhen I got some time I will sit down and try to create a patch for this issue, for now that's the only thing I can do, I'm sorry.. @jhyle we updated to the most recent version of Zend-Db, skipping our hotfix, I will be working on a hotfix soon, so this won't happen in the meantime, until we can try and make an PR to Zend DB.\nI will let you know, so you update the zend db package.. Hey @jhyle,\nSorry for the delay, please check this commit https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/d0ba99fe8db5d0ae6914a21c89542ccf17e0febe and update your composer to install directus-database with an hotfixed zend-db that will allow you to use columns with dashes and spaces.\nRemember to remove the composer.lock file to make sure it installs the new version and not the one on composer.lock\nLet me know how it went.. I will close this, if this still happening I will re-open it.. Thanks for reporting this, I honestly don't know what to do here, as it's probably Wayland, even though I have never used it, but if it's not, and there's a way to reproduce it let me know.\nEither way I'm keeping an eye on it.. Hey @HauntedSmores, unfourtunatelly I couldn't replicate it. Which version/branch are you on?\nYou told me this happen after a column was delete? doesn't this was part of the steps to reproduce it?\nYou create a column with a single file and changed it to single table?\n. @HauntedSmores can you provide me which fields (UI) are on the table?. Hey @HauntedSmores, can you please pull the last commit from master and let me know if this commit 8d3a562 fixes it for you too.. Thanks @Froelund for reporting this, I'm taking a look at this, and I will fix it as soon as possible.. Are sure you are on 6.3.6?, if so, which branch are you using? This should've been fixed. Take a look here: https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/1313 and here https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/2f77f2eb98eb3f1573ce1587ccef927cb0c25590\nIf you just updated to the current version, please clear your Directus page browser cache.\nLet me know how it went.\n. Thanks for letting me know I'm going to try myself and see, I will get back to you as soon as possible.. Hello @Froelund, I couldn't run directus using that docker, so I can't tell if it's installing the right version.\nWould you mind to use this docker https://github.com/directus/directus-docker and see if you have any luck, as I'm thinking that this issue you are having is because you are using an older version, if it's not, I'm having a hard time replicating.\nPlease try with this docker and let me know, I'd love to get this solved.. Amazing! Anything else let us know :). Hey @jhyle can you show me how you configure that UI relationship? (Settings > Tables & Inputs > Teaser > Click on the arrow next to the The Many to One column\nOr look for the record on the directus_columns table.. Hey @jhyle, When this error is happening to you?. I'm not being able to reproduce this error.. Hey @jhyle if you try to access it from the api http://your-host/api/1/tables/Teaser/rows still show you some errors?\nI'm trying to replicate this issue without luck.. @jhyle is this issue still happening to you, we did a clean up and it should working fine in 6.4 and probably on the development version of 6.3, I want to make sure this is fixed to prepare the patch release for 6.3.x.. Thanks @jasonrm, it actually should have a default value, but it does the work. \ud83d\udc4d . Thanks @ryanhalley for reporting this. I will fix this as soon as possible.. Hey @woodscreative, sorry for the late reply, we are aware with some issues with password, but we have never experienced the redirect issue, do you have steps to reproduce it, or is it random?\nAs admin you should be able to update any information without the need to add a password every time.\nI apologize for any inconveniences this may cause, I will get some time to look at this issue.. Hey @woodscreative, can you confirm this still happening? I wasn't able to reproduce some of the redirects.\nDo you mean the token updating itself? or fail when you try to use them?. Hello @globallog,\nWhen this happens is more likely to be a confusion with directus path value. \nWhat's on your DIRECTUS_PATH on api/config.php? it should be / if you copied your Directus files in your root, otherwise the path of the sub-directory.. Sorry for the late response @globallog.\nIs there anything in your logs api/logs? on the first step, what do you set Directus Path to?\n~ Welling. Hey @csprance, before merge can you please change function ( to function( I love it with no spaces in between, I prefer it that way. don't ask \ud83d\ude04 . Hey @csprance, the tree mode, seems to be working, but the style seems to be broken.. @csprance we are going to merge the interface and take it from here, thanks for the PR.. Hey @the-pinky-man, how and where are you executing this endpoint, it's working on my end.. @the-pinky-man you are using api version 1, you should be using 1.1.\nhttp://your-host/api/1.1/tables/directus_users/rows?filters[email][like]=@gmail.com. Glad to hear @the-pinky-man :). Thanks @AwakenTheJaken, I will be adding this option soon. I will let you know when it's integrate.. Hey @AwakenTheJaken, @stevepatter made a PR that implements logical and/or works (https://github.com/directus/directus/pull/1519)\nMaybe there could be a cleaner way, I don't like the 'before' => '(', and 'after' => ')' parts.\nI can't think of any now, but a way to group the conditions/filters without explicitly saying how to group it should be the best bet.\nWe can keep the conversation, or open a new ticket to talk about the possible solutions, but I will close the ticket.. Hey @fabhenrich, this should've been fixed in 6.3.6.\nGive it a try and let us know.. Hey @rijkvanzanten I've tried to replicate this issue and I could get the expected results on both Bearer and Basic authentication, I've been checking what could possible go wrong, but it should only fail on failed authentication, but you got a successful authentication with access_token\nI will see if I can find the problem and I will get back to you as soon as possible.. Hey @rijkvanzanten, could you help me reproduce this issue?. how I can produce it, I was working as expected to me, so I would like to know how are you trying to use it that it failed.. This will need some serious debugging, I still not able to reproduce it. I will review all the alternatives why this could happen.\n. Really true, we have in mind to solve this in the next version.\nIn the next minor version we will be hiding hashed passwords and salt, and about tables it should only be seen the table the user has permission to see.\nThanks for letting us know, and we apologies for any inconveniences this may had raise. . Hey @sanklamm I fixed this and only the current user can see they own private user info.\nThanks for pointing this out to us.\n. There shouldn't be quote, there's an issue on the value being sent.\nWhich version are you on? I've installed Directus recently and there wasn't any issue on creating the configuration.php. Thanks for the contribution, but it seems there's an issue on Directus installation process.. After a long run trying to see where this issue was happening I managed to fix this and we don't need this anymore.\nThanks for the contribution.. Hey @mkleywegt, sorry for the confusion, the API versions are not intended to work together interchangeable YET, they work together.\nWe created the API 1.1 to improve the version 1, but we change all the responses to have the same output format, so that means it won't work changing 1 to 1.1 yet, also won't work because it will change all the current endpoints version, which in the end, you may be using the same version 1.1\nFilters were added in 1.1 for the first time.\nConclusion:\n- it doesn't work yet, we will try to make API 1.1 and 1 interchangeable, otherwise we will deprecate API 1\n- Keep the API_VERSION on config.php be 1\n- Use 1.1 when possible as standalone endpoint, we recommend using this instead of 1, it is faster than 1\nI will close this as this is a information confusion we create and will be resolve in a future release, thanks for reporting this and again we apologies for any confusion.. Hey @hpohlmeyer thanks for reporting this.\n\nI noticed, that there is no .htaccess file in the Directus root directory. Is that right?\n\nNo, that's no right. it should have a .htaccess file.\n. Glad to hear \ud83d\udc4d . Thanks @Zaelot I will give it a look tomorrow. Hey @Zaelot both 1 and 2 has been fixed. This will be release soon in 6.3.7\ncommits:\n- https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/622672d70b8dd053cb6d2b5f7533813ed9bc0a09\n- https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/c9f346070ca36911f8679e60a3180599517aa594\n\nRan into fresh troubles though, WebGL project is returning a null response with error: \"Unknown error.\"\n(on api/1.1/tables/{0}/rows/?filters[project][like]={1} )\nWorks fine in IDE. :/ (Tried both: passing the API token in the header, and with ?access_token=)\n\nWhat are you referring to here? where are you trying to fetch data from?. Hey @Zaelot,\nI'm starting to believe this is a request from another host, because it's an OPTION request, probably you should enable CORS in your configuration.php file /api/configuration.php\nTry that and let me know if that resolve the problem.. hey @Zaelot If this keep happening, please open a new ticket for this issue.. Hey @Zilus, can you update to most recent and try again?\nI wasn't able to reproduce with current release, so this was probably fixed along the way. if still happening let me know and I will work on a fix for this.. Hey @Zilus,\nI finally understood the issue, and commit a fix to the master branch.\nLet me know if that really fixes it.. Hey @ke207, Thanks for reporting this.\nThere's a bug verifying the mod_rewrite using Directus in a subdirectory, you can continue and install without a problem.\nI will work on a fix.. Great to hear @ke207.  I'm closing this ticket.. Thanks @Zilus, I will take a look at this in a moment.. It was fixed here: https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/37084ca122323323d2ff03152695aae11ec1e92e\nOnly fixed on development branch.. I would recommend using MAMP as well.\nIn other hands as there may be different way to install the extension, you can google it how to install it on Mac, or probably try using brew (homebrew), as I don't want to confirm any successful step by step.\nPlease let us know how it goes. I will close it as this is not directly related to Directus, but we can keep the conversion open :). Hello @chrisformula, when are you getting 500 error? anything on your logs (/api/logs directory). Oh, that means you still does not have the php extension mcrypt installed on your machine.\nYou have to install it and install the composer dependencies.. @rijkvanzanten That's true, that's something that happened to me a lot. I will try to add some instruction on how to install it.\nWould you mind to share how did you install it @chrisformula?. Hey @Zaelot I updated the database component, please make sure to install the 0.1.2 version of the directus/database component.. Hey @Faey2222,\nDirectus actually stores those data in directus_activity table. You can filter for an specific table.\nEx below:\nsql\nSELECT `row_id`, `datetime`\nFROM `directus_activity`\nWHERE `type` = 'ENTRY' AND `action` = 'UPDATE' AND `table_name` = 'directus_users'\nORDER BY `datetime` DESC\nLIMIT 1\nUsing the API 1.0:\n/api/1/tables/directus_activity/rows?access_token=<api-token>&adv_where[type]=ENTRY&adv_where[action]=UPDATE&adv_where[table_name]=<table-name>&orderBy=datetime&orderDirection=DESC&perPage=1\nUsing the API 1.1:\nGET /api/1.1/tables/directus_activity/rows?access_token=<api-token>&filters[type]=ENTRY&filters[action]=UPDATE&filters[table_name]=<table-name>&orderBy=datetime&orderDirection=DESC&limit=1\nAnother way using activity, same filters, shorter endpoint.\nGET /api/1.1/activity?access_token=<api-token>&filters[type]=ENTRY&filters[action]=UPDATE&filters[table_name]=<table-name>&orderBy=datetime&orderDirection=DESC&limit=1\nThere's not Interface for this option, but you can add a new record in directus_tables and define your desired table if doesn't exists.\nIn directus_tables there's a column named date_update_column, you can set this column to whatever column in your table you want to store the last update datetime, and Directus will always store that value every time a record is updated.\nI hope it helps, anything else, let us know.\n. Hey @Zilus + @ricricucit,\nI pushed this commit into development branch, it should fix the issue.\nLet me know.. Well if you are using build branch, I apologize, but you have to wait when we release the next version, soon today.\nWhat you can do in the mean time is use the development branch (if possible).. We thought about today after long trying to support 5.5, and not because it stopped support, but we are going to use new packages that requires 5.6.\nThanks for this fix!. Is this issue marked wontfix for 6.3? @ricricucit is this still happening to you in 6.4?. Okay, I checked on 6.4, it actually toggle the visibility of any table on any group to the admin group (which is the only group allowed to edit permissions).\nI removed the syncing part, which will avoid this problem.  It didn't actually change the permission on the group's privilege on the database.\nIt won't be fixed on 6.3. (probably who knows)\nClosed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/696bbdfcee4a56ff4bd98e8ce34422d85b7c8e74. Hey @jhyle, you probably has configured to only fetch deleted items on the UI Options.\nChange Visible Status IDs to a list of statuses you want to use to filter the search\n\n. Hey @jhyle, sorry for the delay, what request is being made to the server? only the deleted records are being shown and nothing else?. This is working, it should've been fixed in 6.4. I will close this. Unless this is a issue that still exists on 6.3 and there's an schema or a way we can reproduce  it.. Thanks @rijkvanzanten . Hey @DaSchTour, it seems like you need to install the composer dependencies.. Hey @DaSchTour at the documentation we point to the build branch which has the dependencies already installed so we omit that step in the documentation.\nYou would have to download and install composer (https://getcomposer.org/) then cd to your directus path. and run composer install you should get all the dependencies installed.\nIt has nothing to do with your setup. You can download Directus from here which already got all the dependencies included. https://github.com/directus/directus/tree/build. I will close this as this is not an actual issue. I will help you get started, either way.. @DaSchTour I apology for the confusion, but only the build branch, linked in the documentation has everything included.\nThanks for pointing this out, we will try to make it more clear.\nDid you manage to make it work?. Hey @quadriq, the documentation has a link to download the release/build zip, which you can unpack and should be ready to use (with composer dependencies already installed). Hey @quadriq, I review the documentation and I see the confusion, we do not link to the zip file directly but to the build branch, we are going to include the zip/tarball in the releases and point directly to those files.. I will close this ticket and we should start tracking this in #1535. Any step by step to reproduce? Unable to reproduce this issue.. Hey @davidbwaters,\nI've push a fix for this issue, sorry for the delay, but I wasn't able to reproduce it until now.. Hey @RabbitMC,\nI'm not able to reproduce, everything looks as expected, is there anything in particular in this table, I created a simple table with id, active and title as columns, and it worked.. Hey @RabbitMC,\nI'm closing this ticket as it seems to be working as expected, otherwise if you are still experiencing this issue please let us know.. Thanks @ricricucit for reporting this one, can you share the database, table and field charset and collation?. Hey @ricricucit, if you go to your config.php file and change DB_CHARSET TO utf8mb4 emojis should work from that point on \ud83d\udcaf \nPlease confirm.. Amazing! @ricricucit, you are welcome to open a new ticket for the WYSIWYG issue, I will have a look at that some time soon either way. . Thanks @ricricucit . @nmpribeiro I believe this is a good behavior, It can be confusing or seem like a bug, but I'm open to discuss this further.. Hey @rijkvanzanten thanks for posting this, but I'm closing it.\nsame: https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/1093. Hey @sanpoChew, can you check your logs (api/logs) any user should be able to edit their own information, what permissions did you gave the user group those users belongs to?. This should at least fix the issue @Zilus is having. @sanpoChew let me know if this one fixes it for you too.. Hey @sanpoChew, this was solved before, I will close this ticket, if you still experiencing this problem, let me know I will reopen and fix it as soon as possible.. Hey @Zilus, I've fixed this with https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/3d5d21713264e83602776b4fb0b4142281b201b3\nLet me know if that worked for you.. Hey @Zilus, Now you can select from Select UI options if you wish to use text or value to be shown in the listing table.\n\nLet me know if that works for you.\nCommit: https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/a00a734bbe7385076cb20a1d225ddaaf53977d43. To solve this issue make sure your connection, table and column are encoded with utf8mb4\nChange your connection charset in api/config.php define('DB_CHARSET', 'utf8mb4');\nOtherwise we can do more, as this library are going to be replaced with another one.. Hey @Zilus, the table was missing a configuration, when a user only has permission to their own item the table needs to specify which table are used to who's the owner of each record.\nThis (https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/3038d80208cbfb681dffb4aa63ce7a1643e5c788) should do it, let me know.. Hey @kaskajp this should do it https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/64929e576e6713c0c889f839ba55b2eeae656b5e as it's a css solution I hope this works across most popular browser.. Closed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/35b9b1adcf8923779cda9037c324dc7321c961eb. Hey @the0neyouseek that look really great! can wait to try it out.. @the0neyouseek Multi-select looks really great, that can be useful!. Thanks @iLama !. Hey @Mio11 sorry, I somehow missed this ticket.\n@eli-oat is there something in your logs (/api/logs directory) ?. @vasiliysmirnov Yes, you can, just make sure to change the DIRECTUS_PATH in api/config.php to /admin/. @vasiliysmirnov let us know how it goes!. Hey @vasiliysmirnov,\nAre you still having this issue? I'd like to solve this issue, It seems to be a mal-configuration though.\nI will close this ticket as this may have been solved, otherwise let me know I will reopen and work on its soon as possible.. what was the change you made @dalbinaco ? what do you mean by normal slashes?. Hey @dalbinaco, what's your stack? I assume the server was running on Windows?. hey @tonimain, if you are going to use the installation, you don't need to import the schema.\nHow your nginx config looks like? it seems that php environment variables are not set correctly, but I may be wrong.\nLet me know.. As far I know this is not a issue directly with Directus, I will close the ticket, but you can still keep the conversation on how to run it under Laravel valet.. Hey @marc-andrecroteau,\nIt seems that some template files are or being served corrupted, this has been reported before, and the files some times are different.\nI've not being able to reproduce this error myself to know what's the error causing it, although from what I know and saw in the previous cases the files are fine in the server but when access through HTTP are chopped or merged with another file.\nIf you could help us reproduce this issue will be great.. Now that I read this again and noticed that @marc-andrecroteau mentioned bitnami which the server probably has PageSpeed enabled by default, causing this type of error.\nThis issue was solved by: https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/8cc6961486874cedbfa4169cd27f9835800d23e1 in 6.4 and https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/8cc6961486874cedbfa4169cd27f9835800d23e1 in 6.3. Hey @gavinbkr, that's really strange, are you using nginx or apache? which OS are you on?. So if you didn't configure anything, so you are on Apache, does you main directory has a .htaccess files, it seems like the parent directory or the virtual host configuration has effect in the subdirectory .htaccess configuration.\ncan you share those files, if any?. please make sure to remove any sensitive data.. Hey @gavinbkr, sorry for the delay, lots going on right now.\nIf possible, please send me the FTP access to me email hola at wellingguzman(.)com or you can join us in slack and send me a private message there.\nI will se what I can do there.. Thanks @gavinbkr, and if there's anything else we can help you with, please let us know.. Oops! :). Hey @benhaynes I got this cover, I will work on this soon. I asked him to report this ticket so I do not forget to add the option later today.\nSorry for the confusion :). Buuuuuut, if @rijkvanzanten have not problem in work with you, if I haven't by then, I'm good.. well, well, well, guess who's here and hasn't done anything yet.\nAgreed, I can do what I promised then @rijkvanzanten can jump in.. Would it help to add button to refresh the slug when the slug are only populate on creation, then there's quick option to update the slug. thoughts?\n. New option added here: https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/2bac1328ced4c243da72c6f2c74d08d2959ee9b8. I'm going to close as it solve the problem in this ticket, we can keep the conversation about the new features suggested by @rijkvanzanten . Hey @johhansantana glad it solve your problem, and thanks for letting us know about that repo, it can come handy for other users! \ud83d\udc4d . hey @johhansantana that seems like a php error, check your server settings.. yeah, that's possible. you can confirm by using phpinfo(); and see the values set.. glad you find the problem, I'm going to remove those lines from the .htaccess\nThanks @johhansantana . Thanks @franctic-aerobic, this is wonderful and just in time for 6.3.9 \ud83d\udc4d . Sorry for the late response, after you all solved the problem, but glad that's all resolved.\n\nPerhaps an exception to this rule could be made for files linked to a table that does have the right permissions in a future release? I don't plan on storing any files that I wouldn't want to be public through Directus, but it'd be great to have the option.\n\nThis is something that would need discussion, we would include private files in a future release, but about permission for specific record, that's something that need to be figured it out first, if you have any suggestion how this may work, please let us know.\nI'm closing this ticket as it has been resolved, if this issue is experienced again please let us know or open a new ticket.. Hey @mpiontek, that could be beyond what we want to accomplish, and this scenario seems to be more specified to your needs, so in your case, you can add a hook to verify that in the API.\nEither way, this should be accomplished with a customized solution.\nhere are the releases: https://github.com/directus/directus/releases. Hey @mpiontek,\nThanks for pointing it out, in the mean time here the actual link: https://docs.getdirectus.com/6.3.6/#Database_Module\nSource here: https://github.com/directus/docs/blob/master/developer-guide/cli.md#database-module\n. Hey @mpiontek, ask as many as you want, If you want to discuss and ask and talk remember you can join us in our slack (https://slack.getdirectus.com)\nBack to your question, if you are upgrading the database, you only have to backup your database. About upgrading the files, we recommend git as it do the job for you, but if you are not using git you can replace all the files, except this:\n\ncustoms all the customs API endpoints, extensions and interfaces.\nstorage/uploads all your uploads files.\napi/config.php and api/configuration.php\nrun composer install, preferably due to cache, remove the composer.lock and /vendor directory and run composer install\n\nIt sounds difficult, that's why is better to use git.\nRemember, try not to remove all the files you created yourself, and you should be in a good place.. We solve the uniqueness that we want to implement, but having a global implementation of slug is not something we want to pursuit now, and the user can implement their own global validation using hooks, not so pretty, but it will do the trick.\nIf this is something that somehow can be really useful, we will hear what you all have to say.\nClosing it!. Thanks @peremp, good catch!. Thanks @WorksDev . Thanks @WorksDev . Great catch! \ud83d\udc4d . Hey @podlebar, can you share the stack trace of that error? or is that the whole error? The relationship seems to be correctly set.. Glad that you found the solutions,\nYes, each should have their own relations table, as they will be the same entries if you are using the same relations (junction) table.\n\nbtw.. here https://docs.getdirectus.com/6.3.6/#Versions_&_Updating the \"Read how to\" link points to a 404 site.\n\nThanks for pointing it out.. Hey @krupper does your table has active field? does the record has active=0?\nEither way it's a bug ;). Hey @krupper, it seems to be deleting when has active column, did you update the status value in your configuration?\nAbout the draft as default, it's because it uses the column default value, which is 2 by default.. Hey @jimborogers, I'm not able to reproduce this error.\nCan you share the schema the installation created?\ntry running bin/directus db:upgrade it seems the schema installed is outdated.. I pushed a fix for the migration upgrade.\nAlthough, based on your schema, it seems you installed directs using 6.3.x schema instead of 6.4.x, the table directus_ui was deprecated in 6.4.x but your schema has it.\nCan you use you the upgrade again, or reinstall accordingly using the 6.4-beta branch?. Hey. @jimborogers and @xorander00, I forgot to update the schema.sql file, please meanwhile install using the installation wizard, or, the CLI (https://docs.getdirectus.com/6.3.6/#Directus_CLI)\nI will update the schema.sql later today!. Hey @xorander00, let me know if this commit fixes it for you?\nAlso @jimborogers, I updated the schema.sql. Thanks @WorksDev!. Thanks @WorksDev!. hey @justkidding96,\nAre you creating and loading a new class named \\App\\Events\\AfterInsert.\nI know it's not clear in the documentation, but that means the class you should've created yourself and the namespace should be loaded by yourself.. Hey @justkidding96,\nI know what's the issue is, thanks to @peremp. The issue is around there, I was trying hard not to make this change, but it better sooner than later.\nIn the mean time what you can do is this:\nphp\n// This is not working\n'filters' => [\n    'table.insert:before' => function($table, $data) {\n        if ($table === 'orders') {\n            $data['uid'] = 'test';\n        }\n        return $data;\n    },\n],\nThis will be changed to something like this:\nphp\n'filters' => [\n    'table.insert.orders:before' => function ($payload) {\n        $payload->data['uid'] = 'test';\n        return $payload;\n    },\n],\nEveryone would be warned about those not backward compatibility changes.. Hey, so I update the hooks behavior, instead of passing multiple parameters, it uses a Payload object which represents the data and has attributes such as the table name.\nIt ended up working this way: (I'm still open to suggestion)\nphp\n'filters' => [\n    'table.insert.orders:before' => function($payload) {\n        $payload['uid'] = 'test';\n        return $payload;\n    },\n    'table.insert:before' => function($payload) {\n        if ($payload->attribute('tableName') === 'orders') {\n            $payload['uid'] = 'test';\n        }\n        return $payload;\n    },\n],\nAn object is pass around to make a little better when multiple filters are going to alter the data.\nLet me know how it worked it out.. hey @justkidding96,\nAre you talking about the example not working, or when you use HookInterface is not working?\nI didn't understand the problem, please can you try to elaborate it a bit more.\n. I re-read it again, did you mean you want the classes to auto load and enable?. Hey @justkidding96,\nI'm so embarrassed, I don't know where was my head at that time while I was reading it, I see what you mean, that's a great idea though.\nI will work on it next week, thanks for the suggestion is a really good one, and sorry for my misunderstood.. After long discussion and testing the suggestion of getting the name of a event from the class name is almost impossible, to not say impossible. If someone got an idea, it's welcome.\nWhat we are going to implement now is autoloading classes in customs/hooks so it's easy to do this 'event-name' => '\\Directus\\Customs\\Hooks\\Class' without autoloading the class yourselves.\nWe were also thinking on doing something like this\n```php\n<?php\nnamespace Directus\\Customs\\Hooks;\nclass NotifyUsers implements \\Directus\\Hook\\HookInterface\n{\n    public function handle($table, $data)\n    {\n        // code to notify the user\n    }\npublic function onHook()\n{\n    return 'table.insert.products:after'\n}\n\n}\n```\nBut this need to instantiate the class without knowing if we are actually using it, so Until we find a better way to do that, we still strongly believe in let the user specify the hooks and the class that would work with that.\nSo we are going to implement multiple classes that listen to one hook/event.\nphp\nreturn [\n  'hooks' => [\n    'table.insert.products:after' => [\n      '\\Directus\\Customs\\Hooks\\NotifyUsers',\n      '\\Directus\\Customs\\Hooks\\GeneratingThumbnails'\n    ]\n  ]\n]\n\nTo play safe and avoid confusion, we are not opting for parsing the class name into hook name, as table can have uppercase or lowercase words, dashes, spaces even underscore, we would spend lots of time trying to squeeze a parser for that. . We have implemented dot-notation for filtering and columns selection in https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/33986f876b70846fce8ba5a70c79cad2c29e9f45. can you provide a schema @studiovlijmscherp? or what the relation of city and code to places? a many to one relationship?. Thanks for the information @studiovlijmscherp .

Hey @ajshortt whats the file where you commented out those lines?. Hey @WorksDev, would you care to explain this commit? what would this fix?. how can I reproduce the issue? I'm able to open the modal, and js-choose-user class, it's only used on the directus_users interface.. Hey @studiovlijmscherp,\nI just pushed a patch for this issue, I hope it resolves the issue, let us know if it worked out.. Hey @GeeWizWow,\nThe authenticated user can always see all their information, you can select the columns you want to see by adding columns=id,email,etc into the url.\nI don't know if that works for you.. Hey @ajshortt,\nYou can solve this problem by going to the M2O column options Settings > Tables & Inputs > Project and type (comma separate) the name of the columns name, by default no columns are selected.\nI will work on a quickfix to at least show the first non-system column (if any) as visible on M2O Interface.. Whoa @rijkvanzanten, this is great! \ud83d\udc4d . Hey thanks @brownpl, someone was just talking to me about this issue earlier today :). Hey @justkidding96,\nThanks for reporting this error, late-night mistake here from my part. I'm going to work on a fix later today. \ud83d\udd28 . Hey @justkidding96,\nPlease, update the database package in composer to 0.1.5 to fix this issue.. Thanks @Emil14, this let us know we need to start using lowercase in the files name and avoid all this confusion.. yeah @brownpl I just realized that today, but there's has been couple of tickets related to this, and the file now it's actually lowercase (https://github.com/directus/directus/blob/master/app/core/basePageView.js)\nSo right now it should be set to work. isn't working for you?. No a problem, thanks for the contribution. I will close this PR.. Hey @ajshortt, what kind of errors are you getting?\nYou can use classes, here is an example. Thanks @dalbinaco . I see flexboxes \ud83d\ude92 . Hey @studiovlijmscherp, I will be working on this, sorry it took me weeks to reply, but I wonder were you using API 1.1 or 1.0?\nA minimal schema to replicate this issue would be helpful. didn't quite understood the schema information you shared.. @studiovlijmscherp Yeah, that would do.

Hey @stevepatter,\nSorry that I've made you doing this twice, now that I'm well rested and rethinking this, wouldn't this be done by any relational column? what would be missing is dot-notation to filter the related data. (See: https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/1419)\nCan you explain if there's any reason this would work over the one mentioned above? just want to get my ahead around your idea.. > My idea's a simple way to let users join extra tables that they can query on, without needing extra \"magic\"\nWe Like it! Thanks!. Hey @raymonschouwenaar, I assume you copied an paste the config examples? Just curious.\nI'm going to change the default DIRECTUS_PATH value to /\nThanks for the info.. Closed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/66fc638b3bf6dcb182960297a0f7747bd509d0db. Correction: Not working for some interfaces, mainly non-native inputs.. Values are being remembered now. another issue that seems to be similar to this one but it actually isn't is https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/1637, which looks like it's one form and saving one will save both, but those are two independent form.\nThe fix will be make it work like one, no matter which tap are enable/open when you click save.\nClosing this as the values are remember when you switch tabs. if one or more interfaces are not working (not remember their value) we can reopen.. @benhaynes I've added the logo from directus.io url, and the design of the footer has too much spacing, take a look and see what you think it's best.\nAbout the logo, should we use the svg from assets directory and fallback to any logo the user use? This follow another question should the logo background be customizable in case the logo and the background don't play well?\n. The directus.io was just for placeholder, the one in directus is a svg, so I need your help on make it work using the svg, in the other hand I will make it work using the project logo (image).. - [x] Inputs should only have checks when the value is valid/matching\nIssue on password; check overlaps due to being wrapped into the same element\n- [x] Password isn't editable (only admins?)\nOnly when it's empty\n- [x] Edit Avatar button doesn't do anything\nIt opens system upload dialog. > I created a new user in the DB and logged in\nwhat values had the user when you created in the DB?\n\nThe password fields were still disabled so I couldn't update my password\n\nI going to update this, it only worked when the user didn't have any password, now will work like this:\n\nUser has password and Input is not empty: Change password\nUser has not password set and Input is empty: Validation Warning\nUser has password set and Input is empty: Pass, keep current password. can you share how you create Mr. Bogus user in the first place?. With an existing password? I thought it was the result. testing now.. Another thing to discuss here is, what happens if there unsaved changes and the user goes inactive for x minutes and the cms tries to log it out? should stay or force the log out?. This has been implemented now, the issue now is that some interfaces mark changes incorrectly or set values by default which make it weird when you just enter into a new item and just leave the page right after.\n\nEx: Creating new users, the first option is set by default because it can set any null values.\nWhich bring to another question, should we let the user group be default to null? and let the admin pick the group whenever they want, this prevent the unsaved changes and creating an user in a unwanted group by mistake.. The interfaces having problem with unsaved changes were fixed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/6d39af7acfe02413ade3c5141cc11e3dc2d0d254. Closed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/2bf7fced7537a103c4c432ba4efcb160803aa95a\nWe still need to keep an eye on updated/new interfaces to make sure we make unsaved changes in the correct way.. It's working as expected to me, can you show me the steps you are doing?\nMine:\n1. Click any column (Options Visible)\n2. Change Interface (Options hidden)\n3. Change back to the original Interface (Options Visible). Never mind, one file wasn't committed. (Closed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/694c4bc97a1074f859d670f69a8eb31501762443).

I was thinking I could avoid this minimal changes and do it myself :)\nThanks for the update @stevepatter . The link did the job, please confirm in your end to close it.. I found out that this seems to only happening when trying to open a modal window.\nSomehow the container of the modal gets removed from the DOM which prevent modals from being opened.\nHow this container gets removed, that's what we need to find out.. When we open a overlay page we insert another view into the main content section, which put the parent view on insert mode, which deletes every child that has been rendered and does not has the keep flag set to true every time its parent render..

We could remove the nav_blacklisted interface and just add nav_listed checkboxes to the permissions interface.\nThis is a good solution, I will implement this in the second batch for the next minor version. what do you think @benhaynes ?. @benhaynes the new nav_blacklist was implement by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/5423c8b8269a07eb9d32a0a8863d6627df834c10. @benhaynes Would this reflect into permissions as well?. it wasn't possible, but now it's bypassed. done here: https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/75771bde1e43956942f1502eef76b98f104547ef. Thanks @stevepatter!. @benhaynes I talked to @stevepatter and the problem here (not tested) it's that the type column only allows 50 characters, but the mime type for docx is 71 characters. After reading the RFC, mime types allow up to 255 characters. \nTo get this fixed, we will have to set the length to 255 to play it safe. Something to notice is that the error is only thrown by mysql when strict mode is enabled, otherwise mysql will automatically truncate the string to fit 50 characters.. These types of problem keep happening this would be fully solved the moment we implement the double binding to check the new data to save.\nThis https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/a5afc8e88c0b4999d12491dc7774d9bb5d9011d7 commit should fix it. After trying different things, it seems be difficult to add a proper message when the error is about memory limit exhausted, which means you almost can't use any more memory to change the message, or are not able to strictly remove memory to use in other way.. We do compare it, but the end result can becomes \"too big\" and hit memory limit.\nI can look for an alternative solution though.. This information could help, let's talk over slack. Last night I did some test and manage to saved 60mb of memory, while uploading a 23mb image that was giving me the memory exhausted error.. We now return a more proper way, it's a technical error, but at least it's error that will give an idea what's going on.\nWe have another ticket dedicated to work on more friendly errors messages here #1237. It seems @benhaynes closed at the same time I was trying to :). Hey @twoSeats,\nThanks for the well explained ticket, I will be working on this today.\nWhat should happen here is that the primary key interface should be set by default when you create the table yourself, and be able to change any numeric field to primary key interface.\nAlthough upgrading the database on automatically create the desired interfaces for the primary key.. Hey @twoSeats,\nIn the first case, how is the relationship of the table looks like? do you have an schema that we can use to reproduce the issue?. Hey @twoSeats, can you share what constraints does your primary have?\nthe second case should be fixed now.. @twoSeats no a problem, let us know when you got the chance. Hey @twoSeats,\ndid you try to see if the error keep showing up after these commits: https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/d57db3d91d3b225c26aa18a0d809071570376400 and  https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/325be196600d190b711e968f5d6d2fff9cc732d4?\nI tried your schema, and changing the primary key numeric interface to primary key and it worked without errors.\nLet me know how it goes.. Hey @GeeWizWow, apparently there's an issue with the docker image no providing a default email on installation. note the {{directus_email}} that's a placeholder that needs to be replaced.. This is indeed a directus docker image issue rather than a directus issue.. Moved to docker repository https://github.com/directus/directus-docker/issues/15. Hey @Hainesy each user group must have permission to update and add information to activity table.\nThis is something we will fix soon, as this is a system level process that shouldn't be requiring the user group permission to perform it.\nIf giving the user group permission to add/update entries in directus_activity doesn't fix the problem, let us know.. I will close this as this is an expected behavior, but we will improve this process to avoid this happening in a future.\nThis will be tracked here: #1532. Closed by e8619d9242e91cd0839613195e503968f916bf50. Hey @benhaynes,\nperPage works, the situation is that limit works alone while perPage always worked along side currentPage\nWhat we should do is make it act as a limit? with currentPage default to 1?. perPage are not being set as limit takes priority and perPage is deprecated\nSo currentPage is definitely is going to be set to 1 by default when perPage is set. . oh right, they include the source by default, then we only have to include the build version in the release.\nWe don't do releases on build branch.. Thanks @stevepatter . @rijkvanzanten Does the junction table has status column? can you share schema of the junction table? I couldn't reproduce this issue. I've reproduced this issue on multiple_files_csv interface. Hey @istvano,\nIf you go to the editing page of the user you changed the token manually, does the token still the same?\nWhere are you getting the token that's not working from? directly from the database or the cms?. Hey @istvano, thanks for the information.\nI had an idea what this was, just wanted to make sure we were in the same page.\nSo what happens here, is that the non admin users are forbidden to see their own token, so this make the interface to generate one every time you visit that user editing page, which give the idea of that that's the actual token.\nSo the bugs goes beyond to everybody hiding the token except for the same user if it's an admin.\nWe've pushed a patch, hopefully we make things work again as expected.\nAlthough this going to be tagged in the next release 6.3.10, in the meantime you could cherry-pick the commit or if understand that the master branch may or may not be broken, use the master branch :). Thanks for reporting this, I'm going to take a look and send a patch as soon as possible.. Hey @jroxendal, that patch should fix the issue, you should be able to use CORS now..

Hey @JonathanKerwin thanks for reporting this, but we have some issues working with the current WYSIWYG, so we are getting rid of it for a new one.\n\n@rijkvanzanten do you think we could bring the WYSIWYG from 6.4 to 6.3?.

Hey @jroxendal,\nThanks for reporting this, can you share an example schema to reproduce this?. @benhaynes it's related in a way with the long fix (fetching all columns issue) could have some effect, which now will take less to load, but still need to figure it out where flatKey helper is taking long to process. I will try tomorrow.\n@jroxendal can you confirm if the request is taking a less time to load now after some fixes we did recently?. The caching layer is currently under development, there's no way to try it out now, sorry.. We took another path and just avoid flatting the whole thing, because why we do that if we are only looking for one value. The slowness is noticeable when you try to get data from a big array.\nImplementing cache after this will be a big hit, but for now this will be faster than before.\nClosed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/71cdaf04363918ffc7ce7d0ea85c5d6002cb9e88. Hey @wittwerch, also I'm curious about that error below in the screenshot? what did you click that it throws that error?. I can take care of @rijkvanzanten, it seems you shouldn't validate fields with default_value. Hey @wittwerch, let us know if this commit solves the problem for you too.. I think @benhaynes may be getting a value that's not a string.. @rijkvanzanten I'm guessing, that's seem to be the only reason that it doesn't have split, and remember that this.options.value doesn't not come directly from input but rather from the model.\nI know you will get it I just wanted to give some ideas :). Yeah, that must be a soft-delete, deleting a item with status column will trigger the update.\nAs ben said it should be treated as delete at least on events, but maybe with a flag that was a soft delete?\nLet's discuss a proper solution for this one.. I do like the event name trash, to me makes more sense than purge, what do you think @benhaynes? . I was thinking the grammar will bite me, any word that resembles more trashing event? otherwise done deal! \ud83d\udd28. Having delete and remove could be confusing, at least to me. Is there a word that represent the \"soft delete\"? probably will trigger both with a flag?\nphp\n'table.items.delete' => function (\\Directus\\Hook\\Payload $payload) {\n    if ($payload->attribute('hard_delete')) {\n        // hard delete\n    } else {\n        // soft delete\n    }\n},\nAn option, in case we don't find a good two word, or if everyone agree those two words can be used without any confusion, I'm all on board.. So it will end up like these:\nphp\n'table.items.delete' => function (\\Directus\\Hook\\Payload $payload) {\n    if ($payload->attribute('soft')) {\n        // soft delete\n    } else {\n        // hard delete\n    }\n},. I was thinking about this now, what happens with older developers that has this set for hard-delete okay I will recommend creating a new name for it remove and we pass it whether is soft delete or not. so we don't break old/current codes..

This will throw lots of interfaces warning if there's a lot missing.\nProbably we should alert once per app instantiate? and flag any interface that has been warning until the page is refreshed again?\nI will close this as the fallback works, otherwise we will continue discussing how this warning should be treated.. Hey @nathanaelphilip, you have to install the composer dependencies by running composer install, if you don't want or can't run composer use the build branch.. We are going to make these steps clear on the documentation soon.. And still happening? Do you have any full php logs?. I've never used nanobox, but I don't think this would make any difference in loading the autoloader.\nWhat's the setup of your nanobox?. What extensions were missing @nathanaelphilip, that's even weird now to me, getting an missing Twig class due to a missing php extension, I would like to know more about this.\nOR all the extensions in the list were the missing one, I've never used nanobox.. Oh gotcha! probably those extensions were required by composers.\nThanks for the information, it will be helpful to someone else having this same issue.. True, I will remove that flag now, we do not have the relational changes that sophisticated, to know when the order changes, don't know if you want to close it or let it open until we manage to get this to the proper solution, or move it to unsaved changes ticket (#1476)..

Hey @peremp, this issue was fixed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/567eadd77e4a64fd00a5db972caa9477ca4ed42f\nPlease confirm.. Awesome! I will close it, if happens in a again or a similar issue I will reopen, hopefully this will solve it, but we never know.. If we disable the button and the user has a small resolution (<1200) it would hide the right pane, and unable to change the status value.. Oh sorry I completely misunderstood this, I thought you meant show it on the right pane.\nAll good!. Hey, I thought I commented on here, sorry. I was testing this, but it didn't work, it just trigger the event for saving (main button, save and leave).\nDo you test this @peremp?\n@benhaynes I know why this should be helpful, though. maybe we should deselect after we \"change\" the dropdown OR do it as suggested which seems more obvious, but it giving me some issue, I could take a look but I've short time the next these few days.. I have test this many times and it just save and leave. I asked if you test it recently because still not doing what expected.\nI think this should be de-select, to me it seems more obvious, right?. I have install it clean so many times, maybe browser acting differently? which browser are you on @peremp?\nI don't want to give up on this just want to make sure why is not working in my end..

Hey @krishnam09, can you share your php memory limit and php max upload values.. @krishnam09 are you still experiencing this error, did you increase your php memory and upload limits?\nI will close this ticket as highly due to php configuration, otherwise I will re-open the ticket.. I removed on interface and leave one, but that one it's used in users interface as internal interface to show the names of each user.\nThese interfaces were meant to assigned the current authenticated user to the interface. This is the same behavior as created user interface, so this is not needed anymore.\n\nWhat we could do is create another interface specific to user: single_user and multiple_users, what do you think @benhaynes @rijkvanzanten?\nThe user interface needs a little make up.\n. Exactly! (change o2m to m2o) pick one user or pick multiple users.. Hey @wittwerch, the column is unique, what we can do is auto-generate the token value, so you don't to worried about it, does that works?\nOtherwise we have to discuss what's best to do.. If we auto-generate the token in interface or better yet we can also auto-generate on API, which doesn't require you to do it, but if the user forgot to do it, it generates a new one for you.\n@wittwerch @benhaynes do you see this as something? good solution or?\nI think this would be the way to go, as that column has to be unique, thinking about whether or not the user is going or allow to use it, that another subject we are open to discuss.. Yes, it can be null, that could work, MySQL allows unique that allows null to have multiple records with null.\nWhat do you think @benhaynes ?.

System columns are not longer hidden from the visible columns list anymore.\nAlthough this will enforce the hidden_list and hidden_input attributes, if both are true the column will be hidden.. That's true, we have been dealing with these attributes since we started working on 6.4.x.\nWe only change hidden_input, we are thinking on removing hidden_list and use the columns_visible instead.\nI'm glad you brought this up, let's see what @benhaynes and @rijkvanzanten has to say about this.\nI'm on board but let's see if no one is planning on adding that button back.. hidden_list removed and use hidden_input instead. Closed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/8edf1be6bd7fa4a892497ca9c4c04938cf318b4a\n. @benhaynes should we force the M2M/O2M relationship to be hidden? I was thinking one possible way to use it, it is showing the count of related items.. We are displaying the count on O2M and M2M on listing page (https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/d1b593f11e1b404be9037156ba8518f9be8982ba)\nThis last commit implement the last thing we discussed.. > children table should be fake person names, or be called countries\n\nWhat is the difference between items and children? Curious why we need both.\n\nI just called it children because I didn't know what else should have been called, these are interfaces record \"children\", if you got better naming and example for O2M records, please shoot! I'm all ears.\nchildren are O2M entries and items are for M2O and M2M entries, as I said couldn't figure it out a good example, so I just created random names, then we can rename it to whatever it's best next.\n\nIt takes a LONG time to load the Interface Listing view even though almost all the visible columns are non-relational. Shouldn't it only fetch the visible columns it needs to it's faster? (we can open a separate ticket for this)\n\nYeah it should only fetch select the visible column, checking it out now..

Hey @nithinga, this issue was fixed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/8730016146d3ebdde322c05cf55d97f72437b2e5. I see you are using the german translation, it seems the translation is a bit outdated, I will fix it in english but this should solve the problem and it will better be solved when one of the people that has help us with the german translation step in.. There we go :) thanks @wittwerch!. This is a good request, it actually looks like one form with two tabs, but actually this is two form in one single view.\nThanks for the suggestion or pointing out my mistake whatever this is, I will be working on it soon.. Hey @nithinga,\nThis commit should fix this issue, or better word: implement a improved saving, avoiding the confusion (https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/70af164c9505284c2bc7df99906c8efd469d345b). Thanks @jlemberg!. Yes, please, provide which interfaces this behavior happens, this probably is related to some specific interfaces, if it's @rijkvanzanten would take care of it.. Thanks @peremp, issue reproduced, I'm working on a fix.. Fixed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/cbc839435cec3c7f97ade674504ee79309e29b86. Hey @daddykom, thanks for the steps. I tried to replicate the issue without luck.\nCan you share the logs in api/logs directory?. There's no log with datetime as file name? Odd, I can't duplicate this issue. can you please provide us that schema, and make sure to remove all sensitive information?. Hey @daddykom, It seems to me this is a server setup or Directus configuration issue.\nWhat's your server stack? how does your config.php looks? Does your have any error on NGINX/Apache logs?. Hey @daddykom, what's your stack? it seems like your http server is trying to get a 403.shtml.\nPlease send us your database schema that helps us reproduce this issue.. Sorry If I didn't make it clear, but the most crucial parts are the data, but make sure to exclude any sensitive data, so we can work with the same data as you.. Thanks for the information, a tip when sharing code try using the code style formatting.\nI tried with your schema, seems all good in my setup, I want to know some more things.\nWhich is your php version and what commit are you on Directus?. can you join us on Slack? I'd like to know more about your hosting/server provider.\nWe've had some weird issue happening on Directus on specific servers due to some modules they have installed by default that didn't play well with Directus.. Does the apache user has permission to write files to the logs (api/logs)?. Thanks for the PR! This may be related to https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/1647\nCan you please tell us more about this, so I don't wanna guess, and everyone are clear what this solves.. Thanks @renjith341 for the contribution!. Awesome @wittwerch, ping one of us when this is ready to test.. Hey @wittwerch thanks, it looks nice, i will give it a shot in a moment.\nAbout the two task, @benhaynes or @rijkvanzanten can help you with that, unless they want to take it from there after merge.. Thanks @wittwerch, it's working perfectly @benhaynes or @rijkvanzanten will work on the styling.. Hey @jorgeflores thanks for the report, I believe this commit (https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/73af8df5e77ed9a298a11a3ea4dc36133bf863e9) should have fixed it.\nLet us know.. Also fixed a bug created by the previous fix by this commit https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/39b701fdec4c34cfc1a272b5b1d50348ec68f53b. What table name are you trying to create and what's the end result?\nThe charset should be working, give me specific example to try to replicate this issue.\nIt seems you are talking about running the migration, but I'm not sure, let me know.\nI noticed that we still clean the names in 6.4 whether or not the \"strict naming\" is disabled, that's a good catch, but still we have been discussing this for long time about wether or not directly support this.\n@benhaynes I wonder if we should allow any table name using the API.. We are ~not~ now forcing hard delete on files until we implement a new option to decide whether to soft or hard delete a file.\n- Hard-Delete: Deletes file and DB record.\n- Soft-Delete: Keeps the file, sets the file status to Inactive. Whoops! I meant to say We are now forcing hard delete on files.... Fixed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/95bc9e8789502a5ef3adf815c03150b97ae16a13. Thanks @martinfojtik, it looks like bug (Directus) while redirecting on windows machine, we would take a look when we have the change to use a WAMP server, in the moment try http://myweb.com/admin/installation/index.php?step=0. @martinfojtik does that change fixed it for you? if it does, please send us a PR with those changes, in my end it didn't make any different and it shouldn't (hopefully)..

Hey @wittwerch, even though they are allow to send message they should also has permission to directus_messages and directus_messages_recipients tables.\nI think if this happen we should force basic permission to messages.\nWhat do you think @benhaynes? we have to give the user 3 permission (toggle, and two tables) in order to read/sent messages. We removed the show_messages column labeled as Allow Messaging and you group must have permission to add directus_messages and directus_message_recipients to allow them to messaging.\nClosed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/fda63e4e93f6152fe943fe66505fc28b0ab6beea. That's an expected behavior if the user doesn't have any permission to directus_users table.. @nithinga we don't want to assume anything, by default if you create a group from Directus it gives the basic permission so all the users can read their own information.. Hey @wittwerch, what do you mean by:\n\nAs a non-admin user I can try to give myself admin permissions. That ends in an error:. Thanks @wittwerch, the issue here is that the dropdown should be disabled too.\n\nWe are working on it.. @wittwerch I disable the select input not to be changeable.\nWould this solve the issues with this ticket?. Awesome @wittwerch.. Did you upgrade from 6.3 to 6.4?\nWhile this would solve this problem, it won't solve the others fields having the same issue.\nThis need to be forced into a migration previous to the token change. If you do would be good.\nYou can read here the fields we changed: https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/8e81ec98509cda2b53ce5b7be89a6aeb532210c1. @nithinga, odd, if you have install it from a cloned version using the installation wizard the token size would've been 128 already, read here: https://github.com/directus/directus/blob/version/6.4/api/migrations/schema/20150204042725_CreateDirectusUsersTable.php#L77-L79\nOr did you install it differently? using the .sql file?. I was thinking into this issue but, don't see to get what's the problem. If the user doesn't have permission to edit, well, it because it doesn't.\nCan you share a schema of these tables and the permission that you gave each group? that would help us to reproduce this issue or better yet to understand it (in my case).. Hey @dsivokhin, thanks for the information I understand a bit more the issue I will give it a shot. I will get back as soon as I get something or didn't get something.. No update, sorry for the late reply, @nithinga can you provide an schema so we can reproduce this issue?\nCan you try again and see if this still happening?. Closed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/57cac36106844df5264619779aa8bc5227dce21d\nPlease confirm otherwise I will re-open the ticket.. These changes were made into 6.4. Also glad you figure it out @eimhin, in 6.4 we are making errors more clear bit by bit.. I think they hash has to be on server side (on save) otherwise we have to create the algorithm function on both client and server side, UNLESS we request a encrypted value on every change.. @benhaynes Having an endpoint means all interfaces can use it.. I don't see point on hashing on keypress, unless there's a good reason for it.\nWe keep calling the server on each keypress, which I think is unnecessary.\n\nOn keypress, gets encrypted hash from backend\n2.1. On second keypress what value do we send to the server we already have the plaintext hashed?\n2.2. Then we need to keep keep a plain value stored, then we should send those instead\n2.3. If that's the case, why don't do that instead, hash only when the user press \"hash\" button, typing will be faster than getting the data back from the server.\n\nWhich mean why the reason to have a client side example, but everything should be best to pass through the server instead.. @rijkvanzanten I was thinking on having a the plain text stored for those case, and calling the server endpoint every x ms after stop typing? @benhaynes . Awesome! no more question your honor!. Fixed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/551e92fc910b42173e52ade9208f7e052e1deb99. Hey @nithinga,\nI tried and I couldn't replicated, can you try to update to the latest commit, and see if still happens?. I managed to replicate the issue. It's not working when it sets to dropdown.\nWe are working on this ticket right now.. Closed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/4360025796ef0e2ebe38010a47ef5267ba47f744. Hey @valgussev thanks for reporting this,\nHow did you install Directus?\nHow did you create the testing table?\nDid you update the global status mapping in api/configuration.php?\nDid you update the table status mapping?. Hey @valgussev, so are you missing api/configuration.php file in api/ directory?. Thanks @valgussev,\nDid you add navigation override to your group? can you share the group record information in directus_groups?. Odd, can you update to the latest build? I fixed two error in the building script, and see if those fixes that problem.. Thanks for all these information, creating another ticket won't be necessary unless this get bigger than I expect.\nHow did you delete the sort column? it seems Directus still getting the sort column information and using to sort the values.. Hey @valgussev, going to directus_preferences and update the sort column for testing table to id would this fixes? if it does, I will work on a fix for a non-existing column name as sorting column.. Hey @valgussev,\ncan you share your logs in api/logs? does your http server user has write permission to storage/*?. Hey @valgussev,\nI didn't any issues in the configuration or logs. Getting a 404 page seems to be more related to nginx or our server routing.\nAre you using MAMP? If you try creating the same item without trying to upload a file, does it work? \nGET http://localhost:8080/api/1.1/tables/testing/rows works?. MAMP is a software (stack: MacOS, Apache+Nginx, MySQL, PHP).\nHow are you trying to upload the files, via WebApp, SDK or Terminal?. I really can't tell what's going on, what's the output of the 404 page? Is Directus or any other service throwing the 404?. Also on what's stack is Directus running in your server?. Just making sure, you install each package independently yourself or used some popular stack or something.\nI believe there's something on your NGINX configuration or setup, because it's not even getting into Directus.\nI will try to replicate this myself on our servers and see what we can get from it.\nIf you have any information that can helps us reproduce this issue is greatly appreciated.. Which nginx version are you using? we recently had an issue, with Apache, that on PATCH throws an 403 error by some apache modules installed. So I'm thinking this could be happening here, because it is not even hitting Directus, but as GET works, I suppose this is a NGINX level issue, and not related to nginx locations.. hey @valgussev, have you try uploading a small file?. Yeah, this is something to do with this, maybe the \"post data\" is bigger than 8MB, so you get to about 10KB free for uploading.\nTry to increase it to the values in php.ini to something like: \nupload_max_filesize = 64M\npost_max_size = 100M\nAnd see if this should solve the problem.\nAs this are configuration problem from nginx and php, and won't be solve within Directus I will close this, unless there's a related issues.. Hey @valgussev, can you increase the php memory_limit value to at least the post_max_size value? I see if still happening.. Someone reported a similar issue last night, but it was giving him 502 instead of 404, and also on NGINX.\nI couldn't have being able to reproduce it. what about upload_max_filesize?\ncan it be possible to teach us how you installed your environment, we haven't had any luck with our servers.. I will close this issue was the reported issue and some posterior ones were reproduced and fixed.\nThere's still one about php max upload size that seems not to be working on NGINX, if someone can report a steps by step to us to reproduce that would be awesome, in the meantime we are going to close this.. Hey @lunacye,\ncan you try downloading the latest build from here: https://github.com/directus/directus/releases/download/6.4.0/directus-build-6.4.0-20170710010648.tar.gz\nAnd let us know if the problem persists.\nThanks!. Awesome!  glad it worked it out.\nThanks for the kind words. please let us know how it went! :). Thanks @trk, we will fix this asap.. Misunderstood the issue, working on it now.. I thought we decided it should be optional and generated only if the admin decided to.. @rijkvanzanten It's highly what's happening, I will review this on the build branch and include TinyMCE or whatever is missing here.\nThanks for reporting this @peXed . The error still happen on the build branch, I'm going to update it soon.\nWhat was fixed was the script that was causing the missing files.. Hey @peremp, I'm curious what release version did you test? just curious if it was the build or the tagged one from master?. Thanks @peremp, We will work on it as soon as possible. Please send me those through slack.. This commit (https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/8fc347d9639218efaf1e04f77598f6dc7ee2a57f) should've fix this issue.. Wouldn't this break the filtering? we should find a way to filter the values OR warn the filter won't work as expected.. yeah, that what I meant, and this is an optional option. so we should be good.. Hey @dsivokhin, does this commit (https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/54a2390b934d7d2636028bb3c454a1782a57cc26) fixes the problem you are experiencing.\n@rijkvanzanten I took the chance as I just experienced this issue (or similar) myself..

Hey @hybridvision, I tried with MariaDB 10.2 on Ubuntu 14.04 x64, and it's working as expected.\nDo you have any specific steps to reproduce this or an exact OS/DB to reproduce this issue?. Hey @jdblack, I have fix how we get the real Directus root path. please get the latest code from the master branch, and let us know if that patch fixes the problem you were having.. What issue exactly are you having @jknigga? Directus or configuration issues?. how you config.php looks like? it seems you have the DIRECTUS_PATH, sets wrong, which means it has to be /directus/.. @jknigga yes, the config file gets generated on installation (last step). do you have the config.php file?. Due to inactivity I'm going to close this ticket until we hear back about the new issue on installation page.. Hey @denno020,\nI do not have a Windows machine now to test this, but on mac and linux it's working, so I assume it may be something related to windows.\nIf you go to directus/api/core/Directus directory isn't there a Bootstrap.php file?. I'm trying to get a windows virtual machine to test this. I'm guessing this must be a windows + composer issue that we aren't manage to figure it out, because we all having MacOS or Ubuntu machines.\nI will get back to you as soon as I get my hands on a Windows machine.\nIn the meantime, If you find what's causing this we would love any help, no pressure.. Hey @renjith341,\nThis commit (https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/fd508cd8d11c7bb0169ed446862b5ff447d6f506) should've fixed the issue. please confirm either way.. Thanks for the confirmation!. Hey @jdblack does Directus redirects you to the install page? when this error happens? as soon as you go to the directus host url?\n. Also do you have a config file generated at api/config.php? Did https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/1685 was solved or still happening?. Hey @kauaicreative, can you please describe your stack?. Did you install Directus in difference version first? It happened twice, I want to know what's triggering this..

Hello @walkwizus,\nFolders in Files was moved to http://feathub.com/directus/directus/+12 as Feature requests (wishlist), we haven't implement it yet, and we did have it on the demo, as the demo was our wishlist of 6.4, some feature like folders were opt out of the way for 6.4.0, but it will be include in a future version for 6.4.\n\nOther question, the three modules (Activity Log, Server Details and Version & Updates) are disabled, is it normal ?\n\nOnce again these are feature we will implement soon, we just leave it there as a sneak peek, it has been getting some confusion, maybe we should add a banner or label that says coming soon. what do you think @benhaynes?\n\nAs this is not an issue I will close it right away. You are always welcome to join us at our slack channel. I believe if we have a badge that says \"soon\" will make easier to think is not \"disable\" but under development..

Thanks @walkwizus, as I mention those error were happening still after the fix, I closed the ticket as the actual issue was fixed but still presenting other issue in translations as the issue were different and I have an internal ticket ongoing working on this issue, I won't get confused.\nBut glad for the bullet points issue you are having I will work on it today.. 2 Weeks later...\n\nWhat translation issue?. Hey @walkwizus, this commit (https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/ed1014d5373cb054a31106815dd98ace93c67a7b) should've fixed all the issues mentioned.\nPlease let us know if it worked for you..

Can you please share these tables and tables' columns information in directus_tables (if any) and directus_columns?. Thanks @aaronaustin, testing now!. Hey @aaronaustin, this commit (https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/645ed69dd61f4401fc503defb42a1430085c4062) should've fixed the issue, please confirm this is working as expected to you too. \nAlso nice looking form you got on those tables :). Awesome, glad to hear!. Hey @lehha, I've not being able to reproduce this issue, can you share more output from the server on dev tools mainly the .html files, it seems one probably be corrupted.\nWhat hosting service are you using? What's the server stack + extension or module installed. any security or cache installed?. Hey @lehha, which version of Firefox are you using on what OS?. @diegogurpegui, does your server has cache/minifier/security layer modifying the html served by directus?\nI will actually going to change .html to .hbs, what do you all think? this will prevent all these possible issues.. I don't think there's an official extension, but I've seen using .hbs and .handlebars but as .hbs is shorter and I'm used to that, I was going to do it, but it's open for voting.. Hey @diegogurpegui, I was just testing this again without any luck.\nIs there a way that you can share an url (demo server) where we can see the error live? or probably screenshots/screencast showing the requests and the network tabs errors/message?. Validation or required? You can make the column required, and it should make the dropdown mandatory if that's what you are looking for.. The stars in the columns list\n\n. @nithinga it must be an interface issue, Which dropdown interface are you using and what's the information on that column, allow null? has default value?. Oh, according to your screenshot you are using M2O, not a dropdown interface.. I see you that you have allow_null to false, which mean you have a value selected by default. which won't bring the required value warning as you already probably have a value selected which will pass the validation.\nCan you please elaborate more about this issue?. It's all good, I will give it a look now and fix it asap. Hey @nithinga, this commit (https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/3fefadd83d79e033ae1e93752e4d6c2ab8dafa9c) should fix the missing validation.\nPlease confirm.. Awesome, @nithinga is this happening to you in other fields? or should I close it?. @nithinga I assumed there's nothing else. please let us know if there's interface not validating.. Hey @jacobzeng, thanks for the report.  this issue was fixed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/dc547af4868b53b50f45d9ceb24126309b445e50. Hey @jacobzeng, what are the tables the installer created? Did you clear all the previous table created? . Hey @jacobzeng, are you using the develop branch or the tar file?\nIt seems it's throwing a different error now.\nIf you go to installation/bootstrap.php and comment out these lines:\n```php\n$emitter = new \\Directus\\Hook\\Emitter();\n$exceptionHandler = new \\Directus\\Exception\\ExceptionHandler($emitter);\n$emitter->addAction('application.error', function (Exception $exception) {\n    $now = time();\n    $path = get_directus_path();\n    $message = $exception->getMessage();\ninclude __DIR__ . '/views/page.php';\n\n});\n```\nAnd try again, what error do you see when you click install?. @piupiupiu exactly what I was expecting to see, but any good information about that 500 error? any backtrace?. @piupiupiu are the errors above thrown when you replace Exception with Throwable or when you remove those lines from bootstrap.php? it seems to be chopped though.\nWhatever it is it seems it's an Fatal Error, but can't see of any logs that has been share with us what was the actual error message.. Hey @Keyes, Thanks for the information.\ndid you try the develop branch? We are trying to reproduce this error. It was suppose to be fixed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/dc547af4868b53b50f45d9ceb24126309b445e50\nWe are still trying to check that configuration is triggering this issue.. Would be nice that you mention that you are going to open a PR, so we don't have too start fixing the issue just to find minutes later a PR.\nWe do love PRs though, just a reminder.. Closed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/ba31626721d1cdc494b4ce29f594e9e4f0f290ab. Hey @peremp, now I'm realizing this probably is one issue that has been reported before.\nIf you go to your GET requests of the data, does it says \"from cache\" in the dev tools network tab?\nDo you have an specific configuration to cache http requests?\nWe are thinking on forcing getting new entries by appending some param on the url, so we get a new data no matter the cache the server/browser has configured.. Hey @peremp, are you using apache? I would love to know if you have some sort of cache configuration in your server, I will try to add a new param on each requests so we make sure the cache is not being made.. Hey @peremp, I've added a new query param with different value for each GET request this will potentially prevent the browser from catching the results.\nLet us know if this fixes the problem. We will implement a proper cache solution server and client side.\nThis probably also fix the issue #1710.. Hey @peremp, did you clear you cache, or what branch are you using? Almost request now (including listing table and editing entry) now has a new query string param to prevent caching and the URL you used as example doesn't have that param included.\nSame with the M2M being empty was fixed on develop branch. Let us know if it doesn't work in develop branch and we can take care of it.. @Zaelot the browser was caching the old files, this has been an continuous issue that I'd have to find a \"force\" solution when upgrading.\n@hybridvision can you tell us what request doesn't get included?\n@peremp I've added a no-cache,no-store header on all GET request, give it a try and let me know if that works, this is a hotfix, until we find a proper way to manage all these browser caching issue we are having.. I only stopped from caching all GET request from the API, again this is temporary, until we implement the cache solution.. @peremp you may still be using old code, there's not reqid param anywhere, in what commit are you working on?\nI still want to know if you have any browser plugin install or any server caching solution or configuration.. After re-reading all this once again and test it more carefully, I see where the problem relies, when we update the related status, we actually update the related data status, not the JUNCTION data status.\nWe've had discussed this internally, how should we handle the junction table? should we have a new button that will jump to the junction table record instead of the related data record?\nSo @peremp if you can go to the junction table and update the status on the junction table does that change get reflected?. Another option would be, having both related and junction table in the same item view, with a separator in between.. As the report of this was a confusion I may call this a missing feature, so I will add it as feature request. https://request.getdirectus.com/r/121\nAs the problem was setting the junction status value, in the meantime any user experiencing this problem can go directly to the table, I'm sorry this doesn't seems to intuitive, but we want to get all the feature to separate from the issues. Although it seems like one.. Anyone can go to https://request.getdirectus.com/r/121 and we can discuss how would be a best way to handle this.. Thanks for reporting this @piupiupiu. This has been fixed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/e65b4ef028fbf761386826f90a6c240e596aaff8\nPlease confirm.. can you explain what you did @piupiupiu as this potentially may have fixed the issue? can you share the logs on api/logs?. Hey @magbeat, I just bumped into that issue last night.\n\n@rijkvanzanten the reason is that the input value is empty when the browser checkValidity function try to valides its value.. Some developers were having some issue where they have to regenerated the composer.lock to their php version, mainly from php 5 (Generated by us) to php 7 (generated by them).\nit was difficult to find out the issue or why some package were missing or an error was showing up to some but not to others. This way people will have a fresh vendor from their php version, which we (Contributors and Developers using Directus) are now going to get a more sense or what going on.\nThis was a long discussing subject that we end it up just doing it, and see what happens after it stopped happening to us.. Thanks @wittwerch, we were aware of the benefits you mentioned, but we are going to let users do it by themselves and see how it goes, depends on it we can bring it back or find better way to handle these issues. we are always welcome to discuss anything that bring improvements to Directus.\nThanks for pointing this out. Thanks for reporting this @martinfojtik. It has been fixed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/adc5685383d1819435e05b368ca50b8679b0002b. Hey @Zilus are you experiencing the same error @dsivokhin is having?. Hey @Zilus + @dsivokhin, does this commit (https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/26968b0c121cf6ab77fa85512e0aed38610538e5) fixes the issue you've experiencing? . This may be related to https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/1719.\nI will give it a spin.. Hey @dsivokhin, check this patch (https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/443e4449d7fe9a4991257f5f9deb8c92ee915286) and let me know if it fixes the other issue.. Great @dsivokhin, thanks for letting us know.\nAny feedback @Zilus?\nWe are decided to remove Allow Profile Editing and only let the user edit their profile based on their group's permission. (Small edit = can only edit their profile, Big edit = can edit any user profile). We removed show_users column from directus_groups (labeled as Allow Profile Editing on groups editing page) to allow any group to edit their own profile must have Small edit and to edit any profile must have big edit permission.\nClosed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/fda63e4e93f6152fe943fe66505fc28b0ab6beea. Yes, it is possible. we are going to update our example extensions to support multiple view and a internal extension menu.. Also to give you a hint or the way to do it, you can add more routes in the Router object (https://github.com/directus/directus/blob/master/customs/extensions/_example/main.js#L55). Hey @Yanlaz, we've updated the extension example, it now uses multiple pages.\nClosed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/68c907264ee9035dc7d3c6e1689ea8e208e1fdfd. Hey @LiamMartens can you test this on develop branch?, I believe this was reported before and fixed, not yet released, it will be on 6.4.1.. Also the columns url, thumbnail_url, old_thumbnail_url and html are just helpers, never meant to be actual columns (created). . What do you mean @Yanlaz? can you please elaborate what warning/error messages you were receiving and when?. Closed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/a33017485c135b1290f12fb176e33618750a6dad.\nNext build release will include this missing file.. Thanks @hybridvision! if someone else can confirm this also work for them would be awesome!. @trk what's on your api/logs directory? any error being logged?. Hey @rgvy Did you give the user group permission to read data from that table?. Great @rgvy, please let us know.\nNote: By default only the tables you create from Directus are automatically managed by directus (admin has permission to it), if you create a table via other way, it won't be visible unless you go to Settings > Tables and click \"manage\" which give the admin group permission to manage and view the table data. I didn't quite get what you were saying... did you perform what I recommend and it didn't work? As Admin you can see any table that you want to manage within directus.\nAnyway I will try to reproduce this myself with your steps, because I'm thinking this could be something else.. hey @rgvy I see you that mentioned it about managing the table, I'm sorry I just didn't notice what it meant.. Hey @rgvy, Thanks for all the information, I finally found what was causing the trouble, Directus is treating the status column as if it were a Status Interface column, and because the value is 0, and the default value for deleted is 0, the records are hidden.\nWe are discussing this behavior, and will come up with a solution soon.. Hey @rgvy this commit (https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/c166d3592b2d1694f00c16f7f3c856c86224bde8) should fix the issue not showing up any data into the users2 table.\nPlease let us know if it did the job.. @rgvy awesome, I can confirm with works on my end. I will re-open if this still happen in some other way.. Hey @xunra,\nDoes the value get saved on the database?. @xunra does it work on develop? can you share a schema so we can reproduce with your same data? I tried on both and it was working as expected.. @xunra does the user has permission to read data from parent?\nThanks for the schema, I will test and see if I can replicate.. @xunra can you share the schema for that table? and why the visible_column option is Parent is that a table name on parent table?. I noticed that you make a many to one, to the same table? is that the behavior you want to accomplish related one record from test to another record from test?. I've been trying to reproduce this without any luck, and it seems to be working perfectly.\nCan you clear your browser cache and see if that solves it?. Hey @xunra, can you test with this commit (https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/443e4449d7fe9a4991257f5f9deb8c92ee915286) on develop branch?. We are aware of the dropdown being without any style, we should be working on it soon.\nIf the issue still persists let us know, please share a reproducible step and we will re-open it.\nThis ticket has been closed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/2ea2b8e4d0f5ce09ce8c486f18d0da6c3c7314a6.

Hey @NextrekNet, are you trying to say that clicking the icon couple of times stop working?. I understand clearly, thanks @benhaynes. it helps to show errors screenshot.\nWorking on it.. Hey @NextrekNet, I have fixed this issue on https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/afe76be8ccfac0f10759a0da2ceba7cefea24922\nPlease confirm, otherwise I will re-open.. Hey @NextrekNet, can you please share your logs in api/logs?\nThanks. I see MariaDB in the error, maybe is only related to MariaDB, I will be installing MariaDB tomorrow and see if I can reproduce this issue.\nThat kind of information need to be specified so we know what environment you are on.\nI will give you an update as soon as I get this running!. Due to lack of information and inactivity this ticket will be closed until a steps to reproduce this is provided.. Yes, I did test it on MariaDB 10.1 10.2 (Ubuntu 14.04 LEMP), I don't know which http server or OS @NextrekNet was using.. Hey @riartem, thanks for reporting this, meanwhile you can rename customs/interfaces/rating to customs/interfaces/_rating to stop the interface from loading.\nI will take a look asap. Can you also try to clear the cache from the browser just in case is a browser cache issue?. Thanks @riartem! I will be working on it asap, one more question, where did you download the directus files from? zip, tar, git, GitHub zip?. @vkrementzoff what MySQL version are you using? and what sql mode do you have enabled?\nDid composer install nothing?. Also @riartem, I reproduced this issue and I've been working on it. we have an alias that map \"customs/interfaces\" to \"interfaces\" which don't place nice on subdirectories. I'm hopping to get this done soon. Thanks for the report!. @vkrementzoff the mode your database is running on.\nOne way you can get the sql mode is by running the query below:\nsql\nSELECT @@GLOBAL.sql_mode;\nSELECT @@SESSION.sql_mode;\nOr you can check your database config file. Probably it can be found in /etc/mysql/my.cnf.. Hey @vkrementzoff, can you please explain this a bit more so someone else having this issue could know how to fix it?. Hey @riartem, the missing interface component was fixed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/b9aabbf807fdc547070ae6ada3efc5bb21831e7b\nI've rebuilt the build zip/tar. Please confirm if this has been fixed or not.. Hello @dieguezz,\nThis is a both API and Docs issue related, you must provide the name and the type (mime type) of the upload.\nfor example name=image.jpg and type=image/jpeg (mime type).\nThe upload should work with those two required information.

Right pane flickering stopped by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/dbc1d8c42b6a561cbf3c6c46396586e2d975eda4. Hey @benhaynes, I implement in this commit https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/f55d50d22efe3cbd1bc0166bf315074fec58fcbd incrementing by one the last column sort value to the new one.. That's because the table last column already have 9999, that values will reset after you reset by sorting the columns.\nOr Am I missing the problem?. I set the new columns value set to 0, 1, 2 (https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/8f549e4c563b457fae17e2fc858646f27635ab70). This is not happening in my end, also we change the fixed information? I hate to keep asking this, but I know it always our issue, cache. did you clear the cache?. Primary column information was set to the fixed schema objects.\nClosed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/bd41318182f33977a2980d866f6aa878cc9da22a.

Hey @selfagency, thanks for the report.\nCan you check and share the Directus logs in api/logs?. Can you please check on dev tools, what that request (throwing server error) has a response data? can you share some screenshots of those requests output.. How do your NGINX configuration looks like? it seems the url rewriting is not working.\nIf you do GET http://jsteamworks.dev/directus/api/1.1/ping do you get pong?. @selfagency if you are using nginx you have to update your configuration to match these locations block like this: https://github.com/directus/directus-vagrant/blob/master/config/nginx/default\n. This issue was closed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/fabd5479836c0b06a0ef20f5916b92e5a06e8987\nYou can go over our slack or I will leave this thread unlocked so we can still discussing how to set the nginx configuration to make Directus API works..

Hey @ngirardhg if you go to http://localhost:8888/_clients/cch/directus/ecole-de-pilotage/tables directly doesn't work, or is it only on refresh?\nAlso can you please share your apache virtual host?. I would like to see how you set up the virtualhost that point to localhost:8888. Hey @ngirardhg, sorry for the delay, does this still happening to you?. You are missing the .htaccess file on the root directus directory, that's why you are getting 404 when you go to http://localhost:8888/_clients/cch/directus/ecole-de-pilotage/tables and not when you go to http://localhost:8888/_clients/cch/directus/ecole-de-pilotage\nPlease make sure the .htaccess (hidden files) exists..

Hey @hybridvision did you type the word NULL into the default? or was this a column created in the database directly?\nI can't reproduce this issue. Hey @hybridvision out of curiosity what browser are you using? maybe doesn't play nice with placeholder attribute.. hey @hybridvision The database can potentially influence this as we get default, using MariaDB 10.1.16 throws the \"NULL\" string issue?. We never tested it on MariaDB but we assume it could have some minor issues, and we probably finally found one. we directly support Percona and MySQL which are the one we actively use.\nI will install MariaDB and test.

Hey @Sirjoseph94, what's your current issue? getting 500 internal issue every time you access the site?\nIs there any errors log (api/logs):. @Sirjoseph94 What was the issue? does that close the ticket?. Thanks @prudolph81, I will close this as this issue is duplicated.\nFollow up here: https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/1742. Hey @aaronaustin thanks for reporting this, do you have mysqli installed?. Thanks for the information. so you are actually able to log in, but can't upgrade? . wait. I think I know what could it be, what's the configuration of your php cli? version and see if it has mysqli installed.\nAlso about the first attempt error, probably is because you have an old database schema. do the directus_users table has a column named active instead of status?\n. so using the mamp php cli does work? Actually the error seems to the connection not missing the mysqli, sorry for the confusion, what's your php cli version?\n\nIn the users table, there's an active column.\n\nThat's the issue with the first time login error, as soon as you can run the directus cli (load mysql). All good @aaronaustin, we appreciate these type of reports (issues) because we get to know how directus behave with different environments.\nThanks, anything else please let us know!. Hey @ngirardhg, sorry for the delay, can you provide the schema so it's easier for us to reproduce the issue and fix it? Thanks!\nAlso are you using 6.4.1 from the release version or a branch?.

Thanks @parnas for the PR, but this will only work on Apache using mod_php.\nWould this solve an specific issue?. I understand, but as this will only work in one case depending on the url, was the better option we remove that line of code you are suggesting long time ago, and because it only work on apache with mod php, what we can do is update the message AND fix whatever was the problem you were having.. Hey @peremp,\nHow does your related (m2m) table looks like? does it have relational column? can you share an schema that help us reproduce this issue?. Thanks @peremp I will give it a shot this time.. Hey @peremp, can you share the payload JSON?. Hey @peremp is that the request payload/body?. I'd really need the schema that we can use to reproduce this issue, there shouldn't any way that the meta data was sent as payload data. This may be a rare bug.. Please note, that I've used the schema you shared with us before, but it's working as expected, so maybe there's something missing.. After looking at this carefully I fixed this bug.\nClosed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/e17d1f5b2cb438bef3ec68485aeae458371c07fe\n@peremp please confirm, otherwise I will reopen..

Hey @Zaelot, this issue has been closed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/0bcc86bdd85c846ab60b4a12bc8a8e5a84e1446f\nPlease confirm us it does works for you.. Do you want to throw errors on Directus? you can throw exception using php and the webapp will catch it.\nfor example:\nphp\n$somethingWentWrong = true;\nif ($somethingWentWrong) {\n    throw new \\Exception('something went wrong');\n}\nLet me know if this is something it works for you, and we will document it for future usage.. this wasn't an issue I'm going to close it! but we can still discuss how to implement this, if the above didn't work.. Hey @dsivokhin,\ncan you give it another try on develop branch?\nThis was closed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/3d7225c1ff05dd3ff1d0acd83515a0f71ccf2841. Hey @dsivokhin can you provide a schema so we can test this with? I tried with the latest code (6.4.2) and it seems to be working.\nThanks!. Hey @diegogurpegui, by default you are getting the first \"level\" of nested data.\nHow Directus work now, is that you can say how many levels of related data you want to fetch, by default the depth=1 which means any related data on the requested table (first level) will be included.\nSo updating depth to match the how many levels you want to include, if that's what wrong, this is a documentation issue, we need to make this clear.\nOtherwise, if that doesn't work, please share a schema that we can use to reproduce.\nThanks for reporting this issue.. Awesome @diegogurpegui, we are going to implement in a dot notation feature so you can pick what columns you want to pick, more in #1419..

Hey @m-pire, thanks for the report, but why are you trying to add the SDK to Directus?\nWhat are you trying to accomplish? so far the SDK was meant to be used outside the Directus repo, most code from the SDK already exits on Directus code.. When does error were happening?\nAlso how are you using the SDK within Directus?. What I meant is, what the use you are giving the SDK within directus?\nYou need to SDK if you are developing outside, although the SDK it's a easier way to interact with.\nDid you update the SDK/Directus vendor?. you should add the directus sdk to the project directory, outside the directus vendors.. @m-pire yes, it should fix that missing hidden_list field column was removed in 6.4. If you are using directus 6.3.x you should use the php sdk 0.1.x and if you are using Directus 6.4, you should use php sdk 0.2.x.. Where did you get the code below from?\nALTER TABLE directus_columns ADD list_view varchar(200) DEFAULT NULL\nALTER TABLE directus_columns ADD hidden_list tinyint(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0'\nCan you show us some screenshot and logs, I'm not following this issue anymore, are you still using the SDK within Directus composer? because it should be out of the Directus composer.json itself.\nYou probably can't use it because those uses the same packages and probably the code from the SDK is older, and they both use the same code, that's why on 6.3, there wasn't any problem, but you should add the SDK to the composer.json, you probably can, and we can probably squeeze it, but it's not recommended yet.\ncan you share your composer.json file too?. Hey @m-pire, I'm sorry, I'm more confused now.\nWhen you are getting the error:\n\nWhich Directus version are you using?\nWhich SDK version are you using?\nAre you connecting to the API or directly to the database?\nWhat's the error you are getting? Only the missing hidden_list?\n\nIf you are getting hidden_list you should run bin/directus db:upgrade.\nWhy can you upgrade using bin/directus db:upgrade? any error?. Hey @m-pire, I've updated the PHP SDK version to 1.0.0, which will fix the hidden_list issue.\nPlease let us know.. I just made a mistake on tagging the version 0.2.0, you can freely update to 1.0.0, which is 0.2.0 with the fixes.\nI will eventually remove it, to avoid confusion.. 0.x is for 6.3 (except 0.2.x) and 1.x is for 6.4.\nConfusingly weird.. I added notes about 1.0.0 supports. 6.4 and 0.1, supports 6.3 etc. This is a expected behavior, not a bug, but we are going to add a feature to sort by the different columns and its data type.\nWe won't mark it as bug, but treat it as a feature request :).

Awesome @parnas, it's working great!. > 1- I've seen that getTotalCount from collection.js always returns the total count without taking into account the search filter (q=whatever). That's why Directus tries to load more items non-stop.\nI can't reproduce because the getTotalCount actually get the total items (after filters)\nCan you provide an schema that we can use to test this? I test it using latest develop (2bddb07)\n. After being reported by someone else, we noticed that this issue was only happening to tables without status column..

I will make develop branch functional again. I will ask you if you could reproduce it on develop branch.. @ngirardhg can you do another test and see if it works on develop branch?. Hey @miguelalvagarcia what commit are you on from develop branch? it's working as expected with the schema you sent.\nCan you provide a step by step?.

Hey @MarcinKuder,\nDid you try using the develop branch? I think that issue was resolved previously (hasn't been released yet).\nAbout the language_code_column sorry for the confusion, but this was, (not is right) but will be the column where the language code will be set, example en instead of \"record id 1\" and option if you don't want to use primary as string.. Hey @MarcinKuder, did you mark the column as required? because the issue No. 2, is kind of by design right now, and we are trying to get to a solution to this one https://github.com/directus/directus/pull/1783#issuecomment-327007307\nDepends on what we decided it will be done in that PR. either way you are welcome to discuss over there.\nI will close this as the main issue is fixed..

Does your database default character set is latin1?\nThis may cause the issue, we don't set any column charset on creation, which it falls back to the default charset set which if that's the case, it will be latin1. Making this clear, as Directus does not create the database, the user has to create a database first, they need to make sure to make the default charset whatever they want, on the other hand we do set the connection charset default to utf8mb4 check the config file (api/config.php) DB_CHARSET constant.\nWe are open to discuss whether or not Directus should use the connection charset value to create any string column with this charset as well.\nAs this is not a bug, I'm closing this ticket, but I won't lock it, to continue discuss this, or perhaps if it's actually a bug that's I'm not getting yet,  I will re-open.\nThanks @chrisbenjamin . @chrisbenjamin what I'm telling you is that if Directus is creating table and columns with latin1 collation is because your database has latin1 collation.\nWhat mysql version are you using? this value should fallback to the database default.\nWhat you have to do is change the database collation to utf8_general_ci then Directus will create any table and column with that collection, we do not support collection on table creation or column creation yet. so we rely on the database default.\nI understand the problem you are talking about, and how you fixed they are all correct, but you have to change the database collection.\nsql\nALTER DATABASE <your-database-name> CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;. The related data must be inside a data key (internal Directus API key).\nAfter seeing this issue, I'm started to think we probably should find a way to add the data this way if possible, we are going to take this as a suggestion.\nI'm going to explain how this would work.\nEx: Non existing \n{\n  \"name\":\"hallo\",\n  \"regions\":[\n    {\n      \"data\":{\n        \"name\":\"New Region A\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"data\":{\n        \"name\":\"New Region B\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\nEx: Existing \nYou would be adding region id = 8 and 9.\n{\n  \"name\":\"hallo\",\n  \"regions\":[\n    {\n      \"data\":{\n        \"id\":8\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"data\":{\n        \"id\":9\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\nEverything in the same level of data will be the junction table structure, such as sorting (if exists).\nI will close this as this is not a bug..

The output seems correct, would you care to share a schema, if possible, that we can use to reproduce this issue?. Absolutely @MartinMekhaiel . I don't think that's possible. I was thinking on Directus Slack. Returning deleted items it's a expected behavior on 6.3.x, although this was changed on 6.4, to only return \"published\" (defined by the user) items.. Hey @MartinMekhaiel can you please share logs and screenshots, and if possible an schema?. Closed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/4a680ec26eaf92a073c7a9b5efb1bd747dfa47ce. Do you mean collapse (hide) the elements of each section?. As now Directus doesn't support this yet. Although this feature you request has been discussed before (internally), you can open one on https://feathub.com/directus/directus.\nAs this is not a bug I will close it.. I added (moved) this ticket to api-docs repo.\nRef: https://github.com/directus/api-docs/issues/10. That's an expected behavior that we are fixing soon, because we haven't implement any validation layer on the API yet, but we are soon.\nThanks for pointing this out.. This will be included in API 2.0, probably won't be part of API 1.x. Hey @m-pire can you share you the m2m column relationship? also if possible a schema we can use to replicate this issue?. The sql dump you share are missing lot of tables. got bunch of warning of missing tables, I'll try to reproduce it based on your screenshots..

This is similar to https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/1752. Hey @chrisbenjamin, please let us know why the develop is too buggy, what parts of the UI is not working properly, that would help us a lot.\nThanks for the updated steps, but the schema are missing the table and columns information (missing directus_columns). Hey did you test it on develop branch, because this bug was already fixed. I'm only experiencing this before the bug as it should have.\nCan you on the other hand tell us what's the issue you are experiencing on 6.4.x develop branch?. As I mentioned before this was fixed on develop branch. This and more bug-fixes will be included in 6.4.3 version release.\nPlease open ticket related to bugs on the develop branch..

I think so, and thanks for this contribution.. Ref: https://github.com/directus/directus/pull/1821. Thanks @idelb . Not able to reproduce this, this is an odd behavior as the status interface is empty.\nDo you have any error in the logs (browser)?\nDoes the record get inserted into the database?\nAre you really using MySQL 5.0?. Something to notice is that I'm using the schema you shared in #1817. We are not experiencing it or it hasn't been reported. Is using an old mysql version has to do with this? if you try to use a more recent mysql version does it works?. Thanks, closing this.. How exactly are you creating the endpoints? You can jump into Slack to ask us question or using the directus tag on stackoverflow, OR create a ticket in the documentation repo.\nThis seems more of a question than a bug report.

To clarify what needs to be done here:\nSteps:\n\nGo to any table listing page\nSelect multiple entries\nClick Batch Edit on header\nClick on any interface input to start editing a value\n\nThis will enable the input for editing, but next to the field name there's a \"Cancel\" button, that's too close (See Screenshot below).\n\nWe want to create a spacing between the field label and the button.\nThe template that contain this piece is located in app/templates/interface-container.handlebars. \nhttps://github.com/directus/directus/blob/d3df3475c76b3eadc78c0956b8765d40b27a0dd3/app/templates/interface-container.handlebars#L9-L11.

We should discuss this in a separate issue, about how we treat uploading php files and such and a way to reproduce and how avoid each possible conditions.\n\nFixed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/4098667afce9571c0d047be02a210b25a3d37e61. @rijkvanzanten I missed the pointed out we should talk what @parnas, was talking about uploading php files and the other extensions that I can run in another ticket, as it's a separate security issue. which is how we prevent future extensions.\nI'm not too much concern as we can add it as they are coming up, and if they can set up weird extensions that out of hands. Again if there's a better way to handle this, I would love to hear it.\nThe problem is that we wanted to serve the file as the original name + extension, if we can skip that we can generate random extensions or new extensions such as change .php to .php.txt and similar.. Thank you @jimjam88!. Now that I'm thinking about this, this has been working like this for long time, don't know if we should keep it that way, to prevent current user for broken results. Expecting the string instead of the JSON.\n\nThis definitely will be part of our new API Version. Should we call it a bug (API 1.1) or feature request for the new API version?. This will be include in API 2, we are not going to update this for API 1.x.. Hey @swttt, this has been fixed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/f2bf1c1eb9b2817f6578f4ea82e61c48bcc85e9d, it will be included in 6.4.4.\nI'm having some issue as @rijkvanzanten mentioned selecting existing one or importing from an url.\nI'm working on getting that fixed now..

Not all Tables are being created in directus_tables\nNot a bug, only table that the user . change information should be created into directus_tables everything else will fallback to default information.\n\n\nif i Add the User created Interface and Name the Column \u201euser_created\u201c it\u2019s Not set in the directus_tables.user_create_column\n\n\nMaybe the bug here is when there's not table information at first. Only this way is the user_create_column not being set? otherwise it's being set automatically? . Closed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/dfc5346b6fcd45d59fa03b6623a27d8a68774c53. Feature request should be added here: http://request.getdirectus.com\nWe are planning on doing this soon.\nThanks for the recommendation.. You can use GET /api/1.1/auth/logout.\nAlso feature request should be added into http://request.getdirectus.com.\nAlso we are probably going to deprecate this functionality (persistent authentication). Which token do you want to invalidate @cgarnier?. Thanks @rijkvanzanten, it makes sense.. We set the access_token to NULL, but the redirection still there, it will be removed in the next API version.\nRef: https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/fa16a6431eff11b7f25e2296bb8538abfb3b514f.

Hey @airbenich, can you please share a schema? (if possible)\nWhen you say backend module, do you mean from the files page? or using a single_file interface?. Not being able to reproduce this issue, that's why I was wondering if you could provide an schema that trigger this bug.\nDoes your directus_files.status has 2 as default value?. Hey @airbenich, I have tried couple of times no luck reproducing this. If there's a schema you can provide to make this debugging faster that would be great. in the meantime I do not have any information on this bug.. Hey @airbenich, I didn't receive any schema. I couldn't reproduce this issue using default to 2, in my end is working as expected. Anyway if you . find a way to reproduce it, it would be great.\nEither way, I'm glad you figured it a way out.. The user are now warned about deleting the last column. Also the \"X\" will be hidden if theres only one column.\nClosed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/f7d403a07242a2bc528d7698ecf1aba4f7fecbab. > Since the table settings are saved on change, pressing the save button doesn't actually save anything\nWhat do you mean by this? the only thing save \"automatically\" is all columns related, that you don't have to click save, as they are saved as soon as you made the change (on change), the rest need to be changed and saved manually (clicking save button). It seems that the warning saying Nothing changed, nothing saved are okay, because adding, removing and updating column throws a notification which makes the user clear that something happened, but as soon as you click the save button it will say that nothing has changed, so nothing saved.. But if you change something in the column it show a notification that something changed. then if you hit save, what are you saving? nothing cause it was already save. so it seems clear to me. What do you all think?. This is not an actual issue, i'm closing this, but we can still discuss what are we going to do to avoid the confusion, but to me, it seems clear, but I'm open to suggestion, but hiding only for columns could be also weird and confusing.. It wasn't related to the table using a text-based primary key, but due to our simple caching implementation on the tables/columns objects.\nWhen you fetch for one column from a table before fetching all, you will always get the first one.\nAlready fixed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/ff9cb1fbe8e96edf9ea28d791072b8fc6f1e9686. Hey @nilsborg, can you check if there's a log in your api/logs directory? also can you show us your nginx server configuration?. Hey @dlaprade, the issue is actually how you are using the UUID library, you have to convert it to string instead of passing the object.\nphp\n$uuid = Uuid::uuid4()->toString();.

I do not have experiencing with these chars, but as far as my knowledge goes, this are how in German are represented, and may be different in other language as @rijkvanzanten says.\nWould it be weird changing it from \u00e4 --> a, etc. I know it may look like another word.\n@BennerGe how do other websites/apps/etc handle this in the german language? translating to its actual sound/value?\nMaybe we can use this against the current localization?. I think we can do the conversion based on the user localization, but this may not work, if there's different people using different localization.\nI think we should at least go for Eszett and other possible german-only characters, and keep improving this as we learn more about all this.. It's a good idea to use something like that. I was thinking on when on how to use the locale, should it be based on the user locale and set default to English?\nFor example, if it's a German project, but my users locale are English, then the umlaut won't be translate to the actual meaning: \u00e4 --> ae but rather \u00e4 --> a.\nShould it be based on configuration (global) or slug interface settings?. > Additionally the slug would change, when a user with another language updates the entry.\nExactly that's a huge problem.\n\nI'm not sure that we have a global locale/language right now\n\nWe can use the directus_users.language default value as the global one, our it will be too odd to find. or should we add another one app level in the configuration?\n\nfor our Hosted platform that means that this is not editable (no server access)\n\nFor hosted platform I always think that we should implement way (same as CORS) to update their their config that will be generated to the current user instance configuration, so I think this could be easily implemented.. > I'm fine with Global Settings though... we can add a warning note to the column.\nNow reading that again global settings, on the admin. that's a good option too. I always can't tell the line between when it should be on global settings or in the configuration files. Agree @benhaynes. Also I'm thinking on implementing a smaller version of the slugify @wittwerch recommended, just to keep it things smaller and use only the translation we support, and we use their data.. That's a concern we need to figure it out somehow for the new API, because the server should be self sufficient. (See https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/1911)\nThis functionality are done using the interfaces and all API user don't have.\nI don't know if this would be a overkill, but it would be good to have the client as \"example\" but the real result would be the API? this can bring confusion if there's a bug in one of them.. too bad we are not using the same code for the server and the client. wink wink. Can you share your logs? (api/logs)?. Sure, on it!. I'm sorry, there's not improvements yet, as far as I remember this happens only on the build version, my suggestion for now, not a good one, but use the non-build version.\nI had some issue figuring out why some plugins works (loads properly) where other, such as  underline, does not work..

Hey @Alekshar thanks for the report, can you provide a schema that we can use to test this?\nNull check for null values only but empty check for both null and empty string.. oh I see what you mean, it should've been OR not AND. Thanks for pointing it out.. @Alekshar we should fallback to a friendly error message OR a better yet, implement this as an alias to (NOT) has for X2M items, which needs to be implemented too.\nThanks, and sorry for my confusion on your concern at first..

On the Input if you remove all the information (say Text Input) it should save a empty value, by empty, I mean a empty string..

Oh you are using the SDK, which version are you using?. True, but this is a different problem, we should move that function somehow to the SDK instead. This would result in a hiding the problem effect which will include no message at all.. Thanks for the contribution, but unfortunately it won't be merged, we will try to solve this in the php sdk, and we will update the exceptions to not use translations directly.. Thanks @airbenich! I was just wondering the reason :) that makes sense.. @rijkvanzanten Flexible width layouts? (probably same with Spanish too). Somehow we gotta have a max-width either way, otherwise a text can mess up the layout.. Hey @zbrox, I've no experiencing working on Google Cloud SQL, but is this a MySQL or similar server? Also don't they provide directly information such as the server host? Finally can you just try using localhost or 127.0.0.1 as the database host?\nWe do not support socket connection but rather tcp connection, give it a shot and let me know.\nI'm going to close this as this is not directly a Directus issue, even if you want to support sockets connection you must create a new feature request here: https://request.getdirectus.com\nWe can continue the conversation on how to set this up with Google Cloud SQL.

This may be an issue with the fact that you can't create a primary key if the column has already data, which may not be unique.\nMaybe the error is not clear,  but this is a expected behavior of MySQL, and probably any other database engine.\nWhat's the error you are getting? any logs or screenshot?. I'm closing this, unless the issue is different from what I understood it is.\nBasically MySQL, doesn't let you put a column that has already not unique data to be primary key.. @toshi38 sure that would make more sense having a clearer error. what error did you get?\nRef: #1237 . oh bummer.

I'm not able to reproduce this issue @mrtopher, would you care to share a schema?\nWhat's the name/title of the bookmark?. Thanks for the video, I'm working on a fix..

Closed by https://github.com/directus/directus/pull/2016/commits/51eba4edad70ffa4fc8e4aa7e9ef78feba1ab35c. This has been already fixed on develop AKA 6.4.5-dev, probably in this commit: https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/1199bcd2367b03a79d12a369f39d52990a08972c. Exactly, this is not an bug, but an actual a confusion with how to use the privileges.\nClosing this, otherwise you are experiencing an issue, please be clear and we can take care of it.\nThanks for reporting this issue.. This has been a discussion we have been doing for long time, but it make sense to not display related data if the user has not permission to view the related table content.. I agree on the button, but with the rest and more confusing because @benhaynes understood something else.\nLet's clear things up.\n\nalso ben I think it better to point out that if a user can see/read/view only their upload files as well.\n\nRead Blacklist= true (the user should see the image in the interface if directus_files are read=true)\n\nShouldn't be the other way around, if the read is not black listed?. @danhipke go ahead!. Thanks for reporting this, I can't find the commit but I'm almost sure this issue has been fixed in `develop, I'm not near a computer now to confirm it, if you can give it a shot before I do that would be great.\nI will come back to either way. This issue was fixed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/2c1135cbb44f4157d5e919527ec7baa8b06876ee. @joelkennedy this will be included in the next version 6.4.5, in the meantime you can cherry-pick this change or fix it in your local install if you will guiding by this commit.. What does the error actually means? It seems odd to me that inserting a new item you get issues with the handlebars files.\nCan you share your database dump?. I'm not being able to reproduce this, I will guess that this has to do with your server, probably intercepting static files.\nWhat modules have you apache install? if it's possible, can you give us a url that we can use and see this issue for ourself?. @adbutler123 hey what are the errors you are getting or what steps are failing?. You need to change config_sample.php and configuration_sample.php and set DIRECTUS_PATH to /directus/ in config.php if you set directus inside a subdirectory named directus.\nand do these steps in your terminal/command prompt: https://github.com/directus/docs/blob/master/developer-guide/cli.md#install-module\n. This actually an expected behavior, it may seems confusing though as it's not self explanatory or give the user any warning.\n@benhaynes may enlight us a lil bit better, I don't know if this was suppose to only work for non active users or all. . I will close this as this is not a bug, but a expected behavior due to email being unique for each users.\nOn #1237 I'm going to add a comment to make sure we add a warning that the users exists and the current data will be overwriting to the existing user.. Thanks @mellamopablo, I will give this a shot as soon as I get my hand into a ubuntu machine. Hey @MeLlamoPablo, this may be too much to ask, but would it be possible that you can send me the urls so I can try to log in and see the issue by myself? do you get any error dump into the response body? the logs you sent me are not directly from directus?. Do you mod_security installed?. I'm currently installing php because of @neocafe said. We haven't tested it yet, but I would assume they would be trying fatal error from 7.1 to 7.2. Exactly, I can update in our fork version and that would do the trick.. Hey, I just want to apologies, I didn't have the chance to use php 7.2 to get the issue replicate, I checked the issue and it was a problem with zend-db, that was already fixed (Ref: https://github.com/zendframework/zend-db/pull/287) in version 2.9.0. But was we are using a clone until they implement flexible names for column and table, we are using our fork.\nTo solve this issue, remove composer.lock and try to install dependencies again composer install and make sure zendframework/zend-db dev-directus is on commit ffccc5c.\nLet me know who it went.. The url seems okay. Would it be possible to see the raw http request? All the response you get is \"Error 404 Not Found\"?. this could likely be one of two things, is running a non-POST request, or the url is incorrectly as @rijkvanzanten says.. @alangv if you request GET <your-host>/directus/api/1.1/ping do you get pong back?. This seems really odd @alangv, can you give access to your url, you send us the url private through our slack channel. Thanks @alangv, glad it was figured it out. Thanks @treechime for reporting this issue, I'm taking a look at it right now.. Fixed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/89f0fb1c6adace1880196b2af5a9eef61c121434. Hey @frappierer you have to set the visible columns.\nSee here: https://youtu.be/rLodHE3e7Os?t=3m7s.

Hey @GaneshKandu, thanks for letting us know, we have changed the message. it will be reflected on 6.4.5. (Ref: https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/358f8653712154376ce4fb24144c603664080147)\nAfter changing this can you install correctly or still having issue?. I'm not being able to reproduce this, can you look into your http request that returns \"Server Error\", and share the response body?. Closed due to inactivity.\nWe will re-open as soon as we get more info to reproduce this.. Maybe this is an issue with your \"directus_path\" in your config.php? I wonder why do you the browser is looking for a main.js which should be bundled into the directus.min.js file.\nWhen you git clone, which branch do you use?\nI'd call cache, but as you mentioned that you tested in different browser, that idea fall behind.. Hey @jedimonkey, are the columns the exact data type? probably there's a bug in the API returning the actual type, can you confirm the API is returning the actual data type?. Hello @shevaroller this issue has been fixed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/2c1135cbb44f4157d5e919527ec7baa8b06876ee. (maybe duplicated https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/1961?)\nWe will be releasing 6.4.5 tomorrow.. I think what this does, but let's bring @rijkvanzanten to review this one.. Hey @BennerGe, How the table looks like? the table must have a  user_created interface to make sure who's the owner of the record.. @u12206050 the table must have an user_created interface to filter the entry by records this field value. (this value must match the authenticated user id). New table with sort are created nullable with null by default.\nClosed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/d758bc5082429154eeb8ef08f48503c77b2db2ad. Hey @dsivokhin, can you please share a schema that we can use to replicate this issue?. I tried @dsivokhin, schema without any luck, I forgot to report back the status of this ticket. If any of you could share a schema that trigger this, that would be great, no having luck with the ones I have.\nSomething this type of issues are due to how some table are structure.. Hey @dsivokhin, I managed to reproduce this issue.\nIf you go to /tables and go to any tables, and try to sort, you get the error, but if you go directus to /tables/<a-table> and try to sort, you don't get any error.. @1zaak Also you can use the response filter to change the output value. But probably have to change the response content type. \nRef: https://github.com/directus/docs/blob/master/developer-guide/hooks.md. Hey @rijkvanzanten, would you care to explain this to me, I didn't understand the issue.. Still don't get it, from where you can enter this information using public group credentials? as Admin in the web app? and since it has no effect where is the issue? You are talking about removing this information from the web app?. Hey @cjstage, @Nicolaidavies  thanks for the report/logs, would it be possible to share the schema (mysql dump) of the database you are using, in order to us replicate this issue?. Thanks @Nicolaidavies. I will give it a shot later today.\n@iKonrad it likely to be that as well, but the logs are different in this case, or can be both.\nRef to sort issue ticket: https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/2007\n. Hey @Nicolaidavies, when you create the multiple files column, you didn't create the correct relationship, and make directus activity as your junction table.\nRead how to the m2m (or any other relationships) works on Directus, here: https://medium.com/directus/understanding-relationships-it-isnt-complicated-35e0dcf78450. When you choose multiple files it automatically pick directus_files as related table, but you would need to create a new junction table, that will make the connections between Places and Directus Files, and that table, ex: places_images will have three columns at least id, place_id and file_id.\nLet us know if this works for you.\nAs this is a configuration issue and not an actual bug I will close this ticket.\nNote: the next version will include a default value (nullable) for sort columns.\nRef: https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/d758bc5082429154eeb8ef08f48503c77b2db2ad#diff-34b430e833d5845fe44fc8956d48de07 .

Hey @mbaljeetsingh, what's that field charset? when you go the database the value is saved correctly? make sure you set the charset to utf8mb4 in Directus configuration (api/config.php) and your fields/table/database.. If you change your database default charset, every new table/column will get the database charset by default.\nTry doing that, changing the table or the database charset to utf8mb4.. Thanks for the information on Strapi vs Cockpit vs Directus.\nWhich databases does this product uses? either way I will take a look at it.\nKeep in mind we are working on optimizing the API response time, any help, suggestion is really welcome. Plus enabling cache should improve the response time.\nAlso, adding ?meta=0 to the url should make a bit more of difference in time response. This will remove the request for items count in the table.. > Directus is using MySQL.\n\nStrapi is using MongoDB.\nCockpit is using Sqlite.\n\nThanks for the info, it makes sense the speed difference though, but we can still make it go down a little bit more too when using MySQL.\n\nTried adding ?meta=0, there's slight increase like 5ms\n\nIncrease? well, that should not have happened. If this is a constant issue. (trying multiple times keep getting up rather than down, please open a new ticket so we can follow up separately)\n\nClosing this as the main issue has been resolved, we can still discuss Directus speed here or any other new threads.\nThanks @mbaljeetsingh . This ticket has been copied from https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/2019#issuecomment-355882447. Hey @rmNyro if it happens again, let us know.. Thanks for the report @iKonrad.. Hey @dfranklinAxon do you have Imagick installed in your server? that php extension is needed in order to create PDF thumbnails.. is Imagick Installed and enabled in the php version you are using? if you go to your storage/uploads/thumbs is the pdf thumb image exists? have you tried with other PDFs?. Are there any generated thumbnails in storage/uploads/thumbs for that specific image, I want to tell if this a loading, a missing data (url) or a generating issue.. Hey @dfranklinAxon, I have not been able to reproduce this issue yet. How your filesystem configuration looks like? (in api/configuration.php)? does the thumbnail path is correct?. > I think thats look right and the thumbnail path is correct too.\nWhen you fetch files using the API, does all the thumbnails links works if you click on them?. Wait, when you click the image url, it downloads the image? This seems to be a configuration issue somehow, the image exists but the doesn't show up at the web app.. Hey @danieljones97 what's the file information in data?\njs\n{\n    type: formFile.type,\n    name: formFile.name,\n    data: file // <-- this\n}. Thanks @danieljones97. @danieljones97 using the imagedata you shared, the upload works correctly, can you check your logs to see what's the error (api/logs)?. Glad you figure it out.\nThe main problem here are with thumbs, in future version we are going to stop using the ID as a thumbnail image name.. Moved to https://github.com/directus/directus-vagrant/issues/26. @dlaprade can you provide a mysql dump that we can use to reproduce this issue?. Hey @kkar Providing a database dump and an specific version for MySQL, rather than \"the one included in the latest XAMPP for windows\" helps a lot. If you have a chance please do it, so we can reproduce this issue quickly.. @kkar Thanks. When this error is thrown? is there something in your logs. Can be found in api/logs directory?. Gotcha just what I thought, Read this comment: https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/1984#issuecomment-357484829\nzend-db had some bugs with 7.2, has been resolved, and you need to remove the composer.lock and reinstall again.. @kkar Either way, the problem is with zend-db and php 7.2.x. if you switch to php 7.1 it will works, without any problem.. can you try Requesting: https://xxxx.azurewebsites.net/api/1.1/ping you should get pong back.\nBased on that you are getting 404, it seems the API is not being \"recognized\", did you check we have the API config in api/.htaccess? \nYou can take a look at out full nginx web config here: https://github.com/directus/server-configs-nginx/blob/6.x/directus.conf. I know it's not used, but I'm letting you know what's the configuration we are using, so you can translate it to web.config.\nIt seems is missing that part, did you take a look at the nginx configuration.. @stoconnor I'm sorry I can't help you beyond that, I have no way to test this configuration.\nMaybe you can try to see how to translate the solution to IIS, and if it works, let us know what the configuration was.\nSomeone commented a tool before: https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/1307#issuecomment-265120119, maybe it helps you.\nAs this seems to be a configuration issue on IIS which we don't support yet, I will close the ticket, but we can continue the conversation going.. @stoconnor remember we have to configuration, one in the root directory and another one in api/.htaccess. If you check the nginx web configuration, that's a complete configuration that works on nginx.. it will be done on 7.0 (API 2.0)\nRef: https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/2035#issuecomment-361042954. We actually are working to make this works as described on API 2.0. We don't know if it will be worth the time to make it work for API 1.x.\nI will add this to the Directus 7.0 list.. @danieljones97 Not soon, we are still developing the API and application.\nA \"quick\" and good solution to implement this into 1.x is using hooks, and throw exception if the data being inserted/update doesn't match a validation set.. @maettyhawk thanks for reporting this issue..

Hey @artur-grzeda, You need to authenticate. Ex: http://dev.creacode.pl/directus/api/1.1/tables/tasks/rows?access_token=<MY-USER-TOKEN>. Hey @studioscholz, This bug has been fixed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/d758bc5082429154eeb8ef08f48503c77b2db2ad\nIt's going to be part of the next version (6.4.6) today, to fix this issue add a default value to your sort column, right now the bug is that doesn't allow null and not value is being set.. Hey @udayn4,\n- What directus version are you using?\n- Can you check your apache/PHP logs?\nThis is an error that php couldn't catch because it got another error (not fund DIRECTUS_ENV). Thanks @magbeat!. Thanks @u12206050, thinking about this, can be a lil be customized in letting you pick, different combinations using checkbox, but that's another topic.. Sorry I don't think we are going to accept this contribution (Thanks for the contribution though), we are looking to implement this using middleware instead.. Again I shouldn't have close it quickly, but the reason was that even this is a better solution than we have we shouldn't go to a different path, then change it back again, user can get confused, and use it as the correct way we think it is.\nHaving this as middleware will work best and will be the best choice.\nThanks for your contribution.. This is an expected behavior, but this is a mid-done feature as I can see now.\nThis was intended at first that the admin were the only group to edit users information, but any other group will be allowed to only edit their info.\nI will take this limitation was it doesn't make sense because the group has actually permission to edit that any user information if the permission is granted.. Closed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/f3b6c17cf72be18cb8962dc76083659b5798a363. Thanks @arboehme, looks good!. Thanks @arboehme!. Hey @u12206050 it's only one colon, table.insert.booking:before instead of table.insert.booking::before.. Hey @mjcella would it be possible to share a schema that we can use to reproduce this issue?. I see what you mean @mjcella while this seems confusing, it was actually as expected. any change you make to the columns are saved immediately and doesn't require to click the save button unless you want to make a change to the other fields.\nSee the warning above the table:\n\nAs this won't be change in 6.x and will be implemented in 7.x, I will close this ticket.. Thanks for this report. We will check the use of salt outside users, when we do a round of tickets or someone else got his hands into this.\nWe recently moved this interface to be used anywhere.. Hey @tiptronic thanks for the report, do you have any logs in api/logs? can you share the schema you are using so we can replicate this issue?\nCan you show us the chunked response? or a screenshot of the error 500?. I see, this is a \"bug\" with zend-db, I will keep this open to remind us to update it on our fork or wait on zend-db to fix it, whichever comes first.. Closed by https://github.com/WellingGuzman/zend-db/commit/ef55371343a85e5cd0937d0ab9d30da7e86f5ab3. \nThis will be fixed in the next version (6.4.10). Hey @DanielRuf I believe the ideal approach will be using the thumbnail otherwise use the placeholder text. (current logic)\nUsing the SVG sounds like a good option, but here lies the problem that the original file (the svg) needs to be loaded and the size varies and can take longer to load, plus may not be a squared dimension.\nWhat do you think?. You are thinking about the web app only, having multiple files (listing page) can take up to loading all files slower, it can be small, but it can be huge, while is likely no matter how many colors or algorithm it uses the thumbnail (say jpg) are like to have a range or size.\nOkay now to the point of using the svg directly, remember this is a xml file, we can't tell what's inside of it. can this be used as attack or break the design? can you just write script inside a svg? My suggestion is: no svg, but an actual file if it's possible.. Thanks @magbeat!. Hey @tiptronic, can you give a little more information, this seems to be a column related to a slug interface? am I correct?. Closed by 8541c39. Hey @tiptronic I couldn't reproduce this issue..

Hey @tchai81, I don't know what you are looking for exactly, but translations is a one to many relationships and it won't have a direct/one value relationship. Also the interface actually only fetch the first relation value, which make the value inaccesible. There's a open ticket for that. currently.\nI will close it unless this result to be a bug not opened before.\nWe can still having this conversation or you are welcome to join us at Slack.

Hey @jroxendal I don't see to understand what's the problem, the expected behavior you are describing seems to be what bookmarks does. or am I missing something? the bookmark store a set of filter information that will reflect the listing when the items changes.. Hey @jroxendal, can you share a schema, I tried to reproduce this on the last commit on master branch and it is working on my tests table.\nAs Rijk asked before, does the bookmark record on your table has the filter column has data?. Thanks for the database dump, I will give this a look as it seems to be an app bug, due to the fact that the bookmark record has an empty filter.\nWe will get back to you as soon as We got something.. Hey @jroxendal, an update:\nYour bookmark are saving filters information in directus_preferences, I realized you were sharing the directus_bookmarks table records, which is just a simple table for creating links.\n(9,1,'table',NULL,'thing','sort','ASC','1,2','thing%3Alike%3Athing2','{\"spacing\":\"cozy\",\"currentView\":\"table\"}');\nthing%3Alike%3Athing2 is the filter.\nI still wonder when you hit ok, on creating the bookmark, you are sent to the actual bookmark, is this something happening to you or was done on a editing process.\nThe issue is related to the bookmark not refreshing the data with the filtering was saved with.\nThanks again for the information.. Are the cropped image the original image or the thumbnail of the original image?\nAre you getting any error? or what exactly is not working?\nAs you mention setFile https://github.com/directus/directus/blob/2c1135cbb44f4157d5e919527ec7baa8b06876ee/app/core/interfaces/single_file/interface.js#L121\nSet the data of the file, but this method expect a File Object\nIn your case what you can do here is set the data as an object and do any validation in the interface (if needed).\nExample:\njs\n// Make sure model is the filemodel\nmodel.set({\n  id: undefined, // make sure the id is not defined, new file, otherwise update\n  name: 'image.jpg',\n  title: 'My image title',\n  size: 200, // size in bytes\n  type: 'image/jpg', // mime type\n  charset: 'binary',\n  data: fileData // file data content encoded in base64\n});\nI will close this ticket as it's not a bug per se, but a lack of documentation.\nPlease if you still having issue with this, we can keep the conversation going here. also you are welcome into our slack or ask on stackoverflow.\n. @Cruddy56 In that case:\n\nCreate a custom endpoint that saves the file to the thumbs directory\nAdd a filter hook that adds the new params: four_three_url, etc. every time you fetch data from files table. (Directus Hooks). Hey @recumbentbirder, if you are not seeing php error on the API this is working as expected.\n\nOn the web app we do not have options to suppress these notification errors yet.\nI will close this unless it's a bug related directly with php displaying errors.. Thanks for the report @EnricoMonese.\nThis has been fixed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/164c09556d60bb0b4b72f4610537c54e0a0d01e6 and will be part of Directus 6.4.9. @lastlink does the user get created? on 6.x we have a issue with Directus that the user must have permission to read to get the data back, otherwise the user get created/updated but the API returns a non-clear error that the user don't have permission, but what actually means is that the user doesn't have permission to read from the table.\nAnother thing to mention is to no confuse directus users with the product/project users.. @lastlink In your example you don't set any user group, which is set to null (the default value)\n```\nPOST https://url/api/1.1/users HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/json\n{\n\"email\":\"me@me.com\",\n\"first_name\": \"test\",\n\"last_name\": \"User\",\n\"password\": \"123456\"\n}\n```. I see this is not a bug but rather a question on how to create Directus users. what you can do is create a hook as @BennerGe says, or set the group column default value to whatever group you want, and set a default user group, or create a custom endpoint and let them create them through it.\nI will close this to as this is not an actual issue, we can continue the conversation on how to implement this.. @ksraghavendra how are you trying to delete users? using the API or the web app?. Hey @MengdanCode, this was planned for 6.4 but it ended up being under development for 7.x.\nAs this is being under development I will close this ticket.. Hey @MengdanCode, this was initially planned for 6.4 but it didn't made the cut. This is being under development for Directus 7.0. Hey @biznlinks does this table has status interface? can you share the schema you are using?. @biznlinks, is the primary key string or numeric? can you share a mysql dump that we can use to reproduce this issue?. @biznlinks I am unable to reproduce this issue, using the database dump you shared. Can you try clearing your browser cache? sometimes that helps dealing with client side issues like this.. Hey @mdbarr73 does the column has null or 0 in the database? or is it only on displaying NULL on Directus?.

Hey @shevaroller thanks for the contribution, I do have one question: I know this is a quick fix, but doesn't this come with a drawback? this runs the router again, rendering the whole module.. Closed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/54a185535e92c3d8e32306311cc9dfa4171c3dc4. Good catch @mvhirsch! Thanks!. Hey @Namide, can you please show us the complete apache virtualhost?. Closes by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/4c71967b983b6088d50bfe38adac73ecb03bbe10\nGoing to be release on 6.4.9. Hey @ninemind The range interface only allow integer data type? did you create the column manually and want the interface to work with floating point data type?. I see what you mean, what I was talking about is that the interface doesn't list non-integer type when you create it.\nWhat you are requesting is to support DECIMAL on the slider interface. I will take a look at this request.. Hey @ninemind I added support for decimal type on the slider interface, and it will be released on the next version 6.4.9. Closed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/87bb231e8c2b9d405d221056f5849aa1721e610a. Hey @levimichael would you like to explain more about this? How will this work? What will be the benefits, etc in your use case?\nSome people have commented about this before, and I want to know more how you all came to the conclusion of this new feature.\nSeeing this is not a bug, it will probably fit best on https://request.getdirectus.com\nI will close this ticket, but lets continue discussing the subject.. Hey @acwhite,\nIt seems you didn't upgrade your database schema, in recent versions directus_users.active was changed to directus_users.status, please upgrade your schema with bin/directus db:upgrade.. Thanks @daniel-upzzle! this makes more sense!. What does this exactly does? because when you are editing a bookmark, you should be back to the bookmark rather than the table.. Thank you @daniel-upzzle!. Thanks @arboehme!. Thanks @Jarwain! \nHas anyone else tested this? I will have to test this out on a IIS server.\nDirectus actually uses the \"basic\" varbs GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE and HEAD.\nOPTIONS is only used on pre-flights request (CORS), but it should actually handle all verbs.\nIs there a way we can help you to get this configuration well tested?. That is correct @spencerbaynton, it makes more sense to set the minimum as default, if it sets.\nCare to open a PR?. It will still needs to fallback to 0\njs\nthis.options.value || this.options.settings.get('minimum') || 0. Thanks @spencerbaynton!. Hey @spencerbaynton can you please open the PR from the develop branch instead of master?. Better! Thanks again @spencerbaynton!. Hey @u12206050 can you be explain a little bit more about this? how can I reproduce this bug and when does the random string get parsed as INT?. @u12206050 I see what you mean, but this is an expected behavior, because this is a random string, not a random numbers function, we allow to include number, but as a string not as a numeric values.\nYou can use any function you prefer on your side to generate numbers.. I think understand your concern. It seems to be a bug with the interface.\nThis needs to be solve with a new function that will generate the random numbers, instead of a random string with numbers when the field is numeric.\nWhich is not related to the randomString function as it does what it is expected to do, generate a random string of  numeric characters.. That's the problem, you are generating string you should expect a string, this can be solve creating a different function for random number (numeric type).\nIf you take the issue out of the picture the function works as expected, the problem comes when you use it on a numeric data type field, which shouldn't happen and there's the bug. The bug is not with the function but what is using the function. What we should do is generate a random number with a different function (for numbers) when the dat type is numeric Ex. randomNumber.\nI will close this as it's not something I am willing to do, because the bug is on the interface.\nI will be open to discuss this bug.. The latest tag has been added to the directus image.. Hello @emresaracoglu,\nWhat is this all about? It doesn't seem to be a directus issue.\nPlease explain otherwise.. It seems to be docker, but it doesn't seem to be related to creating the image nor building directus within our docker image.\nI will wait on a explanation/step to replicate to move it to directus-docker repository.. @BenSegni How does the VirtualHost looks like? can you take a look at the VirtualHost our docker uses: https://github.com/directus/directus-docker/blob/master/directus-base-layer/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf. Oh I see you don't have access to the server. How did you install Directus?. Yeah we actually had experienced this before (See a comment here in the .htaccess). I don't recall correctly what it was but I think it was related to how the VirtualHost was configured.\n@BenSegni Can you show us how you VirtualHost looks like?. Hey @MaximilianUE, unfortunately Ruckusing uses mysqli and some php 7 installation has this extension disabled. You have to enable mysqli on your php environment.. If you are using MAMP take a look at this comment. @DanielRuf probably is disabled on the cli version of your php. Run which php and see which php are you using and php --ini to locate the php.ini. We can keep the conversation, I closed it as this is probably the same issue we have experienced before. The PHP CLI has not mysqli extensions enabled.. I want to add if you run php -m do you see the mysqli extension?. That's correct @DanielRuf. It has been reported before by MAMP users. But at the end the underneath solution is that the MAMP php cli already has the mysqli enabled, that is why changing path fixed it.\nPlease, let us know if that was your case too.. can you try running php bin/directus db:upgrade instead of bin/directus db:upgrade?. I want to ask you to go to /Users/mbecher/Sites/da.localhost/web/directus/vendor/directus/migrations/lib/Ruckusing/Adapter/MySQL/MySQLBase.php on line 1298 and just echo/dump/see the value of $this->conn->connect_error (the actual error)?. I appended the actual exception message from mysqli. That would make things more clear.. Hey @evanzummeren, can you show us the Directus logs in api/logs directory?. Hey @MaximilianUE, Directus checks use these conditions:\n!extension_loaded('fileinfo') || !class_exists('finfo')\nCan you make sure there's a class named finfo by dumping the statement using var_dump(class_exists('finfo')); and if that doesn't work try using the global namespace var_dump(class_exists('\\finfo'));. Thanks @Radiergummi!. Thank you @anatoliayazilim!. Thanks @hal869,\nThe PDO object accepts socket connection, but directus use different naming for the configuration and that's why you started whitelisting the configuration, but the unix_socket wasn't one of them.\nIf someone wants to pick this issue and open a Pull Request, please let me know.\nReference: https://github.com/directus/api/blob/master/src/core/Directus/Application/CoreServicesProvider.php#L679-L689. To any one having issue with the date time described in https://github.com/directus/api/issues/532, that bug has been fixed by https://github.com/directus/api/commit/7245b7aee01e2362e38b9d79d6cc024c568bf276.\nReference:\nTypeError: Argument 1 passed to Directus\\Util\\DateTimeUtils::createFromDateTime() must be an instance of DateTime, boolean given, called in /home/directus/src/core/Directus/Util/DateTimeUtils.php on line 123 and defined in /home/directus/src/core/Directus/Util/DateTimeUtils.php:96. Hey @shealavington, Someone else was having this problem months ago, and I didn't found what was causing this, but they solve it the same way you did. It seemed that the web server were removing the Authorization header and renaming to something else the web server passes that header.\nWhile this is a solution ,I still feel this is a bit hacky, because it doesn't reveal or fix the actual problem, but is a workaround for this specific case.\nDoes anyone knows why the Apache with CGI removes the header?. > I just did a print of $_SERVER in the API web.php and there's no authorization token. \ud83e\udd14 When I do this on my server, it comes though as HTTP_AUTHORIZATION \ud83d\udc4d\n\n\n\nWhat was your setup here? If the HTTP_AUTHORZATION exists it should have been renamed to Authorization by the .htaccess. Everyone using MAMP, would you care to share your generated httpd.conf file? It should be located in ~/Library/Application Support/appsolute/MAMP PRO/templates named httpd.conf.temp.\nAlso If anyone has access to the apache configuration try this:\n```\nThis will try to set the Authorization variable to HTTP_AUTHORIZATION ignoring the case\nThis works if the setenvif module is enabled\n\n    SetEnvIfNoCase ^Authorization$ \"(.+)\" HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=$1\n\n``` \nThe problem with php_sapi_name is that it can return random names from hosting providers, so it cannot be relied on it.. Thanks @mattbisme, providing your httpd.conf I don't see any SetEnvIfNoCase ^Authorization$ \"(.+)\" HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=$1 which that's the reason we have a similar statement in the .htaccess.\nWould you care to add this in your virtual host to see if that fixes the problem. Also can you try to share you $_SERVER variables, Example: var_dump($_SERVER);. Is there any HTTP_AUTHORIZATION or REDIRECT_HTTP_AUTHORIZATION?. Thanks @dev7ch, some people have confirmed that worked for them before. Adding it to .htaccess will be ideal, that will probably reduce the issue with future installation.\nAnyone having this issue can try adding this to their public/.htaccess and confirm it solves it?\napacheconf\n<IfModule mod_proxy_fcgi.c>\n    <IfModule mod_setenvif.c>\n        SetEnvIfNoCase ^Authorization$ .+ HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=$0\n    </IfModule>\n</IfModule>\nIt will only be applied if the server has mod_proxy_fcgi and mod_setenvif enabled.. The problem with having the token in the URL is that it will be logged (access_log, for example) and could get cached, or invalidate the cache on the API when the token change, meaning the url change (something that might be seen as an unexpected behavior).\nIt would be ideal though, but maybe this could be an option in the app? I feel the only drawback for the header in the moment is the bug #2224 that we haven't found a way to solve yet, while in the other hand they are more disadvantages using the query string.\nAgain the most important thing here is that we at least give them the option to use query string, so when someone install Directus but don't have a way to \"fix\" the Authorization problem, at least they can get it up and running, while all the request are made using Ajax, this may not be a problem.. I added a note in the documentation: https://github.com/directus/docs/commit/27817b830433b793ee265bbbdeb5fb4692b68a14.\nAlso make sure to install and run the redis server.. I will close this and keep the conversation over #2224.\nI will try to reproduce this with php 5.6, It's weird how this is only now happening with php 5.6.. One more thing @jameswill, are you running php 5.6 in FastCGI mode as well?. @michaelbriordan we need more info to debug this issue.\n\nWhat's your web server setup? are you using nginx or apache?\nWhere are you getting that error?\nCan you check if there's logs in the api logs directory related to this error?\nCan you check the http request that respond with that error, if any? Example in the developer tools network tab.. Hey @dpejinovic, Is there any errors in the browser and API logs?  You can find the API logs in the logs directory and the browser logs using the developer tools console log.. All datetime fields are saved as is, unless it's a system collection or ISO format.\n\n@kroawen What's the type of the publisher_date field?. @kroawen I think the interface localized options is for how the datetime will be displayed in the app based on the user locale, not on how the api will return the datetime.\nYou will always get the datetime you save without timezone. If you use ISO format, the date will translate to UTC and save it, but will return the datetime back as the format shown in your image above.\nlocalization and timezone are different thing.\nYou will always get the time in UTC. can you share the schema you are using? because if publisher_date is a core interface (datetime_created) it should've return the datetime in ISO format.. What's the problem you are getting exactly? Are you using / or /<project> endpoint?\nAre you trying to increase your upload size?\n\nIs that any reason why we want to use get_cfg_var vs ini_get to get the max_upload_filesize?\n\nWe try to use get_cfg_var to get the php.ini configuration value (for global reference) and ini_get to fetch the runtime value, the actual max size for that execution in specific (real one?).. Hey @cheehau, which endpoint is that? http://domain.tld/_/ or http://domain.tld/?\nFrom php docs:\n\nThis function will not return configuration information set when the PHP was compiled, or read from an Apache configuration file.\nTo check whether the system is using a configuration file, try retrieving the value of the cfg_file_path configuration setting. If this is available, a configuration file is being used.\n\nDo you know what's your stack? This might be the problem, can you confirm this?\nEither way I will fallback the value to use ini_get instead, that way we have a value returned.. Fixed by https://github.com/directus/api/commit/236192e0758b1c312fe07c1f04e738d052a0c915. I don't think there's a side effect by including the file, but @rijkvanzanten is best suitable to get a better response on how to add this to the build process.. I added a short note to the docs about mod_rewrite and AllowOverride with https://github.com/directus/docs/commit/04d75aa6a68d35df186e19e7acd1b8c9711a019a.. @benhaynes do you know why this four lines were here,, I deleted because I could resolve the problem with the news lines. \n. options.minimumResultsForSearch = Infinity; throws an syntax error Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token .. This is my only concern, String.prototype.includes doesn't work on most browsers, including Opera.. Will CHAR allow steps?. @rijkvanzanten Why this options was removed?. could this be a numeric 0?. We prefer the single quote, unless there's a variable inside.. We prefer no space after the operator. Are we still going to use this debounce? We could use the underscore implementation. We use a lot of underscore utils over the place and it's already loaded so it won't make much pain.\nWe avoid to have to functions doing the same thing, and underscore will be proxy/wrapped by Utils some day.\nYou can add a function inside the interface so when it's time to move it, if, then add the code in there and should be good to go.\nOr, use the underscore one inside the Utils, and that should be good to go too.. what harm would that do?. When are these files created?\nbin/composer\ncomposer-setup.php\npackage-lock.json\nWe should be tracking files that we do not generated in some way.. Also this looks good.\nCan you check https://github.com/directus/directus/blob/master/api/routes/A1/Entries.php#L23 and implement it as well for API 1.1 for 6.4 on version/6.4 branch. Thanks, it won't hurt, but we shouldn't be tracking (in this case untracking) those, the person installing should clean the directory after installation, and I believe the composer-setup clean all this.. Removing this line will keep getting 404 page even when the image was found/generated.. By default crop is un supported (config file) the configuration needs to be updated to reflect this.\nFiles that need to be updated to pass the tests (configuration.php):\n\nhttps://github.com/directus/directus/blob/master/api/core/Directus/Util/Installation/stubs/configuration.stub\nhttps://github.com/directus/directus/blob/master/tests/api/Util/Installation/mock/configuration.sample.php\nhttps://github.com/directus/directus/blob/master/tests/api/Util/Installation/mock/configuration.sample2.php. The file won't always be an image/jpeg format.. If the \"not found\" thumbnail can be anything wouldn't this also be configurable?. I know it's not clear, but we use commas, and there's some missing commas.. We should check if the value exists before pushing it into the list, to prevent empty elements.. Whoa the future (present day) is here! I think this may be the first let in the Directus core code.. Oh sorry, but we aren't there yet @sethjgore. Still not using ES6 yet. it was odd to see it :) I forgot to mention changing to var.\n\nAgain we can still talk about this, although let and const if it's well supported I'm all aboard.. It's always open to discussion.. We removed the .html part the templates now must be .twig. Please add the question mark, (/users/?) so it works with or without the trailing slash.. This is a risky step, this may break current user code, it would've been better to write a new method and mark this as deprecated.. You can use $app->request()->get() or $app->request->get() instead.. You can use $app->request->getResourceUri(). Can be replaced with: $app->request->isGet(). Use $app->container->get(KEY); instead of Bootstrap::get(KEY);. What headers does the cache response generated? is this configurable and if it does where can it be?. Can the cache be disable? example on development environment or simple because we want it disable incase we are using a different solution?. Isn't this Middleware working similar to HttpCacheMiddleware (Previous CacheMiddleware)?. We were expecting the new layer to cache the output, so we don't hit the db, but acting everything else as normal, so the user can execute hooks. that's one cache, then we would have a second one that's what you are using and that's the HTTP cache, unless this has not been clear to me, if it's please let us know.. Will this be configurable?. Wouldn't be possible to instead of invalidate the entry, we update it?. What does this line do?. What about $this->$array?. Still not following what is doing, like what would be the result or what we looking for. Adding comments would be better so I don't have to ask questions, I'm sorry just get lost here.. $array param seems not to send an array but rather a string. please add phpdoc as well, and a clearer name.. Can you make this default to storage, and let the user set this value to anything they want?. Having nue only is better than \"new item\"?. @airbenich ping. Shouldn't only the \"checker\" (the method that validates the extension) be the only case sensitive, instead of convert the extension from the original to lowercase? or is there a reason to do this?. supporting .jpg mens supporting .JPG and .jpg those are the same file extension, but we can have FILE1.JPG and file1.jpg which can be different, but it was just something to think about it. because the issue was checking whether it was supported not how the actually fixed was going to be generated.\n\u270c\ufe0f . Hey @nums it looks good, but I will use this.model.id instead.\nIf it's possible change it, otherwise I will merge it and change it myself, if that sounds okay.. Late reply, but it uses the original name, that was were you confusion came from probably. You can read the issue was referring being reported here: https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/1989\nI will take care of this one. . I like this in some level, but hopefully we let the API returns the actual casted value, if this is not working s expected. In fact don't letting the user make relation between two different types.. Reason for removing sensor Reference: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/error-messages#sensor-not-required. Using cooperative gesture handling lets the user control the panning and scrolling behavior of a map when viewed on a mobile device.. @jedimonkey Can you give us a example where the one of the was string? because this is probably a bug in the API then.\nI see your concern, as this may solve the problem now, I'd like to fix it (if possible) from the root.. This can be improved to to concatenated the previous options.\nEx:\nphp\n$numericPool = '0123456789';\n$upperAlphaPool = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ';\ncase 'upperalphanumeric': $pool = $numericPool . $upperAlpha; break;. Yeah, that's better you can make the $pool default to $numeric . strtoupper() . strtolower().\nAll good, please update it so we can merge it! :)\nThanks!. Does this fix a bug? let us know. Can you send this separately?. Is this used somewhere else?. Hey @danhipke curious what does this actually solve?. Any reason why is this using eval?. Does the intention of this is to work with sizes above the requested size? for example if the requested size is 200x200, but it's configured to only allowed 100x100 and fallback enabled, this won't redirect to 100x100, because 200 is not less than 100. but 50x50 will redirect to 100x100.. $config is already  on line 11. no a big deal, but we don't have this officially set but have been sticking to curly brackets on the same line, unless it's a function or method.. also not a big deal, we are sticking to create comment with //.. I believe this should be set to false as default to prevent issue with previous installation.. Why were all these removed?. Makes sense @konradwww!. ",

Quite possible that it was hardcoded however.\nCurrenly it runs the functions as shown there.\nIs their a certain way you want to do it?\nI think might be good to keep way it is now, (so single function called on any update etc...), but also have it run a php file with name == tablename.php (so like documents.php for \"documents\" table). inside a \"hooks\" folder.\n.

This only occurs if you simultaneously try to create a bike ticket which is associated with the new bike. As such it is a duplicate of ticket #239.\n. In fact it doesn't fail to render, but submits the foreign collection item with a default \"active\" value of \"0\", thus that record is not rendered in the foreign collection.\nClosing & opening a more accurate ticket.\n. @coolov @benhaynes would it be unreasonable, if this scenario did occur, to auto-fill (temporarily) the collection in question with the first five or so non-system columns?\n. This can be seen on the classes table as well. I define the room, instructor, and class type, and the only thing which Directus sends in the PATCH request is the Instructor ID:\n\n.

Keeping in mind that Solr and ElasticSearch are \"interfaces\" to Lucene indexes, & how we like to keep Directus as free as possible of required dependencies, we could probably have Directus ship with filesystem-based Lucene search indexes. There is a PHP Zend library to a Lucene index which does not require an additional daemon --- just Apache and PHP.\n\nThis could facilitate typeahead endpoints as well as future advance search needs.\nIn theory, we could also have this gracefully upgrade to a Solr or ElasticSearch interface in the future, if a someone wanted better performance.\n. Column ordering is also an optimization technique. Left most columns are faster lookups. Not sure if it's a good idea to tightly correlate column order and UI order.\n. ",
    "Radiergummi": "It feels wrong to dig this issue out, but it describes what I've just experienced after upgrading from 6.3.9 to 6.4.2: After leaving the page open a while, clicking on any navigation element results in a toast saying Unknown error until I refreshed the page.\nI'll try to gather logs once this happens again.. @WellingGuzman I did indeed clear the cache since I experienced another issue after install - I still had an open session before upgrading. Once I tried to access the site after the installation, it was stuck saying \"loading data\", with an error showing up in the console - I think it was some session object being undefined.\nClearing my session helped here... Maybe all existing sessions should be invalidated after upgrades?\nAnyway so yes, I cleared the cache, and there are no errors in the log file from yesterday.. Weee, the new design looks really neat! Looking forward to update \ud83d\udc4d . Yep, soft-delete. (On a sidenote, a big thumbs up to you guys for being so quick to answer)\nI'd propose creating an additional event Table.purge(:before/:after) that'd be fired on hard delete.. On the other hand, I just thought it might make more sense to introduce an event called Table.trash for soft-deletes, preserving delete for real deletions. Would be more CRUD-like, too.. Well, according to Urban Dictionary, trash can be used as a verb \ud83d\ude43 (Maybe the context there might be slightly different). Hey @WellingGuzman I'm sorry I didn't respond yet, there was just too much stuff going on. Thank you for the explanation, throwing exceptions sounds good..

Just a little note I'd like to throw in: I just moved our Directus installation to a new, clean box. I set up PHP with mysqli and mysql-pdo, installed MariaDB and got Database connection failed. on accessing Directus (tables set up, credentials working).\nThe solution for me was to set the correct path to the mysqld.sock, but it was an awful way to find that out. It would be nice if you'd add the exception message in Bootstrap.php#L409, so users have a clue what's going wrong. There's DIRECTUS_ENV too, so maybe check for development first.. Update - I've noticed this depends on the authentication method used. While all files are visible using the access_token query parameter, they are missing when using the Bearer authorization header... Wat.. ",

Currently directus will NOT load the related item as a model in a many-to-one situation UNLESS the many-to-one or single media UI is selected. \nTableSchema line 9 has this item:\npublic static $many_to_one_uis = array('many_to_one', 'single_media');\nIn RelationalTableGateway, near line 690 is:\n$isManyToOneColumn = in_array($col['ui'], TableSchema::$many_to_one_uis);\nIt is checking against the UI type to know whether or not to load a related object. This should be changed to be more like the other relational types to use the data_type column in the directus_columns table so that custom UI's can be used for many-to-one relations and the DB layer will load the correct related models.\nCurrently this is NULL for all many to one so that would need to be changed, along with additional logic to ensure that this is set correctly/auomatically when a UI is chosen that specifies itself as a many-to-one custom UI.\n. This may also relate to a fix for issue #188 \n.

In the fake datatypes we can have custom properties like\n\"table_related\" and \"junction_key_right\" in the same way as MySQL types can\nhave \"allow_null\" or \"length\".\nExample:\n...\n {\n    \"id\":\"many_to_one\",\n    \"column_name\":\"many_to_one\",\n    \"type\":\"INT\",\n    \"is_nullable\":\"YES\",\n    \"comment\":\"\",\n    \"sort\":20,\n    \"ui\":\"many_to_one\",\n    \"system\":false,\n    \"master\":false,\n    \"hidden_list\":false,\n    \"hidden_input\":false,\n    \"table_related\":\"options\",\n    \"required\":false,\n    \"is_writable\":true,\n    \"options\":{\n      \"id\":\"many_to_one\",\n      \"table_related\":\"options\",\n      \"use_radio_buttons\":\"0\",\n      \"visible_column\":\"title\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\":\"many_many\",\n    \"column_name\":\"many_many\",\n    \"type\":\"MANYTOMANY\",\n    \"is_nullable\":\"NO\",\n    \"comment\":\"many to many test\",\n    \"sort\":9999,\n    \"ui\":\"many_to_many\",\n    \"system\":false,\n    \"master\":false,\n    \"hidden_list\":false,\n    \"hidden_input\":false,\n    \"table_related\":\"cats\",\n    \"junction_table\":\"junction_table\",\n    \"junction_key_left\":\"ui_gallery_id\",\n    \"junction_key_right\":\"cat_id\",\n    \"required\":false,\n    \"is_writable\":true,\n    \"options\":{\n      \"id\":\"many_to_many\",\n      \"visible_columns\":\"title\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\":\"one_many\",\n    \"column_name\":\"one_many\",\n    \"type\":\"ONETOMANY\",\n    \"is_nullable\":\"NO\",\n    \"comment\":\"test relational\",\n    \"sort\":9999,\n    \"ui\":\"one_to_many\",\n    \"system\":false,\n    \"master\":false,\n    \"hidden_list\":false,\n    \"hidden_input\":false,\n    \"table_related\":\"foreign_table\",\n    \"junction_key_right\":\"related_id\",\n    \"required\":false,\n    \"is_writable\":true,\n    \"options\":{\n      \"id\":\"one_to_many\",\n      \"visible_columns\":\"title\"\n    }\n  }\nIn the many-many and and one-many datatypes the relationship is\nestablished when the \"fake\" column is created:\n[image: screen shot 2013-08-18 at 9 12 16 pm]https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/2272019/983037/3f665a10-083a-11e3-8338-f21e3ea32f38.png\nFor the column with the \"fake\" datatype we can then have different kinds\nof UI's, including custom ones:\n[image: screen shot 2013-08-18 at 9 16 00 pm]https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/2272019/983043/ce022434-083a-11e3-933e-135e0e15540a.png\nSince the many-one UI rely on the INT datatype, a relational UI is just\none of many options:\n[image: screen shot 2013-08-18 at 9 21 35 pm]https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/2272019/983061/88e1342a-083b-11e3-955b-812247cfc14e.png\nBecause of this, the table_related is a part of the UI-settings:\n[image: screen shot 2013-08-18 at 9 24 15 pm]https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/2272019/983066/d604460c-083b-11e3-8a88-1812f0e61128.png\nUI settings are written to the directus_ui table!\nDoes this make sense?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/RNGR/directus6/issues/313#issuecomment-22837244\n.\n\n\n\n*\nMax Glantzman\nWeb Developer\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSOULCYCLE\n609 GREENWICH STREET\nNEW YORK, NY 10014\nTEL 646.755.6845\n\nCEL 617.824.0931\n\nmax.glantzman@soul-cycle.com\nwww.soul-cycle.com\nFacebook http://www.facebook.com/pages/New-York-NY/SoulCycleR/64759509591\nTwitter http://twitter.com/soulcycle\nSoul Careers http://www.soul-cycle.com/career.cfm\n*\n.

    "davidbwaters": "Hi.  I know the limitations of PDO make this one tricky and somewhat out of dev's control, but wanted to note how much the lack of hosting support for disabling strict mode could potentially limit exposure for those considering/learning/testing Directus.  \nNot being able to install Directus on shared hosts and cloud hosts like Heroku could be a hurdle for many.  Virtual machines and AWS still work, but for me, and I'm sure many others, the major appeal of Directus is the ability to self-host . For clients, I would use the paid plan to avoid maintenance, but it would be nice to easily test  working with the API with an install on my own server.. Oh, awesome, I hadn't tried it yet, actually.  I have it installed locally and know the installation has warnings about it, so I assumed it would cause lots of problems.  I'd been looking into Docker hosting, which let's you configure my.cnf, but will test it out on a shared service,  I assume I just need make my own config file with DB credentials, etc?  \nSo if I'm building a small site with mostly text fields, files, and no giant numbers, this shouldn't cause any problems?\nI'm really glad you guys are still streamlining this, thanks for the quick reply. I've been following this project for a long time and love seeing it become more and more stable. . Hey, I was experiencing this also.  Just to note, if an inaccessible capitalized table is created and fields are added, creating a table with the same name lowercase let's you access the original.. I created a new table, added a markdown field to it, saved it, and selected the table from the menu to view it.  After the table was created, I was able to add a markdown field.  I think there was an empty entry in the table after creation that could be causing it.\nI'm having another issue that's preventing me from accessing newly created tables, so I can't reproduce it right now.  Investigating if that is already an issue and report or contribute to solving it.. Okay, sorry to be off-topic, but I believe the table-creation issue is the bug from #1308 and will post my experience in that thread to try and help resolve that.  \nThe markdown problem seems to have something to do with the empty entry in the table upon creation.  It was the first table I created and I added the fields before viewing it.   After switching the field type to textarea,  I was able to access the table and noticed the empty entry. \nI am definitely a noob, but if I had to guess, maybe Marked needs an empty string set somewhere when markdown is selected?\nThanks a lot for all of the hard work.  Directus is a very impressive and refreshing approach to one of the oldest problems in web making!. ",
    "Zaelot": "Sorting seems to still have some issues. For example, in M2O if you start with {{id}} in Visible Column Template it'll sort the dropdown values disregarding the numerical value (first everything starting with 0, then with 1, then with 2 and so on).\n(Would also be nice to be able to sort the values by a non-visible column.)\n\n. Hi @WellingGuzman! In the interface. I tested with the API and it works correctly there, with sorting affecting the actual order. It seems that in the interface it sorts them by the string, and that doesn't check whether the number continues. (Noticed at first when the dropdown contents were sorted by alphabetical order, then tried to include both Id and Sorting in front, but as you can see, that didn't quite work out either.)\n(Unrelated question: Are we supposed to be able to add items to Dropdown Enum after it's creation? UI let's you edit the values - in a field still misnamed as \"Length\", but saving causes an error. Current solution being re-creating the field.). Apparently messages threads are not marked as read if you're in one while it receives new replies. One has to actually go through Messages navigation to get it correctly marked.\nHere's a message reply that still has a correct timestamp (that will get corrupted in time). At least when they're all with \"Invalid Date\" they appear to be in correct order.\n\nPS. While I'm at it, the Time Zone's were missing some capitals. (Plenty of +2's but no Helsinki. :) )\n. Yes, thank you. That was indeed the issue, though the resulting behaviour was a bit quirky. :)\n. It seems you can scratch out 3. & 4. as the API was expecting the group_id and not group_name as I had mistaken.\nRan into fresh troubles though, WebGL project is returning a null response with error: \"Unknown error.\"\n(on api/1.1/tables/{0}/rows/?filters[project][like]={1} )\nWorks fine in IDE. :/ (Tried both: passing the API token in the header, and with ?access_token=). We set up the Directus database that we're trying to utilize for our project. One part of the project is made with Unity 3D and there in the Unity Editor the above (GET) call to https://ourdirectusaddress.com/api/1.1/tables/table_name/rows/?filters[column_name][like]=item_name\nworks just fine without any problems, but in the WebGL build, we get a null response to the request with error message of \"Unknown error.\" (Literally that string.) Content length: 0. Status code: \"200 OK\"\nTested with API 1.0 as well, same thing.

Thank you very much @WellingGuzman, that was it!. Encountered another cache related problem when we upgraded to the latest version: Got stuck in a loading screen for /tables after logging in, on Chrome. Solution was to clear the cache (also deleted Directus cookie.)\nConsole log from the situation:\n\n. Hmm, you can see the resetting value (ie, not actually having a value) issue by just refreshing the page. Though the enum issue remains, it seems refreshing the particular page fixes View Options issue. (Both allows to reorder the columns, and shows them in their correct place according to the sorting order.). 1. Created a new table\n2. Created a new broken enum dropdown.\n3. Created an entry to the table to see that the dropdown was indeed broken.\n4. Created a new text input on the table.\n5. Filled a value to the new text input field.\n6. Adjusted Visibility Options, and tried reordering. (Didn't reorder.)\nHitting F5 fixed that - so guess it just hadn't caught up to all that was going on. I have encountered similar kind of behaviour previously (like when working with the same UI in different tabs), somehow part of the changes are there, but the UI doesn't operate correctly unless it's properly refreshed.. > How do I created a broken enum dropdown? \nI meant the user interface Dropdown Enum. For me, they've all been broken in version 6.4.1. (Of course, I do test with enum values such as Another test,2,1,4,01,5.) The user interface shows the values that were inserted into the Length field during the creation of the column, and let's select a value, but apparently does not actually save the selection at any point, and doesn't report any errors either.\nI haven't had the chance to test the updated version yet, I will though, when our admin gets around to updating. . Oh, and can't browse the entries in the tables themselves. the small handy < and > arrows have disappeared.. Workaround is to change the type to Many to One Typehead.. ",
    "wbadrh": "/api/config.php sets:\ndate_default_timezone_set('America/New_York');\non line 2.\nmaybe integrate an option so you can choose your timezone on install.\nand maybe select the current timezone by calling:\ndate_default_timezone_get() ?\n. Yes, I think the easiest way would be not allowing a space (or auto change to \"_\" in the input field when creating a field within Directus (expanding database). And I would personally don't capitalize the field. So the overview within Directus has exactly the same name as the field within the database.\nExample:\nIf I want to expand Directus and I see all the current fields have capital letters, I automatically want to type a capital letter if I add a field.\nThis results in having a database with and without capital letters. Afterwards it's hard to change this field and it's not quite clear within Directus which fields do and do not have a capital letter.\nWhat do you think @WellingGuzman  ?\n. ",

It would be a pain to create a table and then have to go back to permissions to grant myself alter privileges and then go back to be able to add columns.\n. @WellingGuzman @benhaynes I think that if you have the permission to to create a table, you should have permission to alter the table. Wouldn't really make sense to be able to create a table and be able to actually add columns. Maybe when you create a table you automatically have permission to all actions on that table and then you can give access to groups and other people while you create the table. And then have the admin group that has rights on everything.\n. @WellingGuzman I agree, although the  alter permission should still be on a per table basis. You might have permission to create tables; however, there may be certain tables that you have no permission to  alter. I think the best option would be have group permissions and user permissions. If you create a table, you are the only user with alter permissions and the admin group automatically has all privileges on all tables. From there you can adjust privileges on a per user or per group basis.\nWhat do you guys think?\n. @WellingGuzman No problem! Glad to help out!\n. @WellingGuzman Looks like I have found part of the issue. Alter Permission Issue Gist\n. @WellingGuzman looks like a good temp fix. In what cases is the verifyPrivilege function called?\n. @benhaynes Hmmm I understand the thinking behind that, maybe when you delete a table via the online interface it removes the table from MySQL but also exports all the data into a file, that then if space is needed can be deleted from the server.\n. @WellingGuzman I was just thinking that a default export on delete setting would keep people from accidentally deleting a table and losing all their data. That would at least give them a way to retrieve any accidentally deleted data. I think the best middle ground would be having a checkbox on the delete modal that has an option to export the table and then remove it from MySQL.\n. @mickrip I agree with your points and I don't think Directus should try to be a DB Admin tool. But lets say you want to build your data system using just Directus. For example, lets say I want to do asset management with Directus and I install a fresh copy and add my tables for whatever assets I am tracking. If you were to make a typo or weren't thinking straight and added a column that is no longer needed, you have to go into something like Sequel Pro or phpmyadmin to fix it. I view this as frustrating and I think this feature should still be included in a Data Management system like Directus.\nAnd I guess for me, when I see that you can add something, I assume there should also be a way to delete it. But I could see how this could be unsafe, but I don't think you should limit the power of the application just to keep people from accidentally deleting data.\n. @mickrip I see your point, and I definitely agree that users shouldn't have these permissions, but a superadmin I think should. One of the issues of doing it manually is making sure that you cleanly remove the table and any data that references that table is removed from the directus_* tables.\n. @benhaynes @WellingGuzman if you decide to make it for purely managing content, it might seem that the ability to create tables and columns via the core Directus interface would be out of place. \n.

    "mickrip": "My wording was a little wrong ;) .. grabbing fonts over http over a https connection made the browser angry. \n. My $0.02. I think you should abandon this train of thought.\nLets take a step back and define what Directus is and what it's not. (in my opinion at least :)) - I'll take you through my logical flow..\n- Database administration and Data Management are 2 different spaces.\n- It is not a DB Admin tool - a DB Admin tool is something like phpmyadmin/SQLyog. \n- Do you really want to reinvent that wheel? It's not a space that Directus should ever be in and you'll only confuse people.\n- In my opinion, Directus should only wrap around a DB schema using metadata, it should never interfere with the original schema, because: Your developers want to know that they can install Directus and not fear something bad is going to happen to their database. Especially if they are relying on an external app that makes assumptions about your schema!\n. @ConnorGBrewster - Yep, I see your point. But as a counterpoint, I have SQLyog always open - making a schema change is quick and easy. So your frustration can be fixed by improving your workflow.\nIn a real project, modifying schema impacts your models. I don't want Directus being able to change the source of truth. I don't want a client changing \"totalPrice\" to \"price\" and have my phone ring at 7am on a Sunday morning ;) It's a bit opinion based, but Directus is a drop-in client-facing \"superadmin\" and not a dev tool. (regardless of how you define your roles inside the admin) - as said above, you'll confuse the message. \nIn my opinion, Directus should be focusing the time on improving the experience for clients and not developers. (Making the ecosystem extendable is what will make it more awesome)\nAlso, if Directus plan to abstract their DB to include other database ports, might be an idea to forget about this idea anyway.\n.

It might suit your needs, but is still WIP.\n@benhaynes Is there a way to fix Directus' version? Is there some kind of versioning available at all (as you don't seem to use tags)? I'd like to version the Dockerfile accordingly.\n. Hey @WellingGuzman, @bobmulder and @benhaynes \nsorry for the late reply. It took me some time to get a version running that features a completely automated installation (and afterwards realising you already provide an undocumented (?) solution to install via CLI through bin/directus).\nTo give it a shot you can run it with docker-compose (this simplifies linking the containers and defining the ENVs):\n``` bash\ngit clone https://github.com/beevelop/docker-directus\nAdapt docker-compose.yml for your needs (update VIRTUAL_HOST / remove nginx-reverse, etc.)\ndocker-compose up\n```\nYou should then be able to access your Directus installation by browsing the specified VIRTUAL_HOST.\n\n@WellingGuzman: Thank you for tagging the latest release. I fixed the version in the Dockerfile to ensure compatibility between the provided environment (container) and Directus' requirements.\n. @WellingGuzman seems like your docker-compose installation is kinda broken.\nYou can launch the containers manually too:\n``` bash\nCD to a directory where you want to persist the files \u2013 e.g.:\nmkdir ~/directus && cd ~/directus\nStart the mysql database\ndocker run -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=Un1c0rns_4r3_4w3s0m3 -e MYSQL_DATABASE=directus -e MYSQL_USER=directus -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=Un1c0rn -v pwd/db/:/var/lib/mysql/ --name mysql -d mysql:5.5\nStart directus\ndocker run -e ADMIN_EMAIL=directus@example.com -e SITE_NAME=Dockerectus -e ADMIN_PASSWORD=Un1c0rn -v pwd/logs/:/var/www/html/api/logs -v pwd/media/:/var/www/html/media --name directus --link mysql:mysql -p 8080:80 -d beevelop/directus\n```\nYou should then be able to access your installation on Port 8080 (change -p 8080:80 if the port is already in use). Replace -d with -it to watch the logs flowing.\n. @WellingGuzman Sorry to bother you again.

Did you have any luck with Docker yet :wink: ?\n. I can reproduce this bug using the build branch as the mentioned changes doesn't seem to be merged there yet. The issue is resolved in the master or development branch.\n. @WellingGuzman Wow, thank you for the fast fix. By rebuilding the Docker image from master, I can confirm it to be working.

Update: It's not a fixed message, rather it shows every error that has been shown since the page was reloaded:\n1. Control case: Load Directus and press Enter > nothing happens\n2.

I've also had errors shown a few steps after submitting via pressing Enter. For example, on a fresh install create a group with no permissions and then create a table:\n\nI'd hypothesise that Directus is saving things in the database when save/submit buttons are clicked but not when Enter is pressed and this is probably a separate issue from the one above.\nPS Sorry to be hounding you guys with issues, I just see a lot of value in Directus and there are several places I'd really like to be able to use it.

I've run into this problem myself as well (on two occasions..).. @JKdreaming I'm pretty sure that last issue (/users/me) is caused by https://github.com/directus/api/issues/672. Hi! \nI've merged the divider and instructions interfaces into this new Section Break interface. It adds a break in the flow of fields of a table and offers the ability to add instruction/informational text for the next section. It can be used in either full-width or inline mode:\n\n\n. Hi! Great idea! \nWhat will be the available options?\n- always editable (current default)\n- read only based on other field?\n- on creation editable, read only after that?\nAnother thing; is the slug already checked for uniqueness in the table? I don't know if this is currently the case but it definitely should (be an option). \nI think @welling gets to it before I do \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb. I absolutely love this idea @ricricucit! \ud83d\ude04\nThe map / address interface could very well be the same thing in my opinion. . Lets create a hidden interface, which allows people to create columns that have no (or a read-only) output in the admin. That way, someone could create optional hidden interfaces for the different parts of an address to save to different columns.. Options:\nhidden interface:\n- [ ] show_value  shows read_only textinput with the set value\nmap interface:\n- [ ] save_as_json save address values as JSON (toggle)\n- [ ] column_mapping (JSON) map address parts to user columns (optional)\n- [ ] google_maps_api_key (textinput) (required). This has been moved over to the feature request tool, since there isn't an \"issue\" with the current implementation and this being a request/proposal for enhancement.\nhttps://request.getdirectus.com/r/133. @szepeviktor WordPress databases are notoriously hard to convert to a 'clean' database without all the WordPress 'junk' polluting the data. Please let me / us know if you find an easy way \ud83d\ude03 . I believe this is a duplicate of #1352. Could you try adding the following to your .bash_profile / .zshrc?\n```bash\n.bash_profile / .zshrc\nmake sure the php version is the version selected in MAMP\nexport MAMP_PHP=/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php5.6.10/bin\nexport PATH=\"$MAMP_PHP:$PATH\"\n```\nAlso, make sure that you use PHP >= 5 and not PHP 7+. I have noticed this myself as well. I'll post it here if I'm able to reproduce it. Ben, an outline is the most recognizable focus style, but also quite an \"ugly\" one style wise. I recommend a double box-shadow (one bg color, one primary blue) which creates the ring effect but in style. (For later reference) It was fixed in this commit: 72391d470f19e00969e49b951d4e95d5cd3adab6\n. Maybe we could look for alternative solutions to uploading files altogether? I've uploaded way larger images and files on this exact server using two other CMSs in the past.. What is the status of this issue? What is the problem in the first place? What is this add column you're referring to? What new interface do we need?\n. @lastlink Normal users can use the api! You can request a user's token by sending his/her credentials in a POST request to /api/1.1/auth/request-token: https://api.getdirectus.com/1.1/#Authentication. Once you have the user's token, you can use it to authenticate any request just like you would with an admins token \ud83d\udc4d . Luckily this fixed itself.. Ha! I knew you would notice.\nI came across this little info snippet this week so it seamed like a low-hanging fruit optimization \ud83d\ude09 \nhttps://mythbusters.js.org/#/v8-tips/freeing-memory. Not sure if this is related, but the sort column in directus_columns has a value of 9999 for all interfaces. @WellingGuzman Is that a wysiwyg_full interface or a regular wysiwyg? The regular one is a Medium-style editor which only shows options on text-select. @benhaynes I believe @WellingGuzman's screenshot is from 6.4 (notice the grey background) \u263a\ufe0f. At the moment, all core developers are working fulltime on the next major version of the platform, so I'll have to leave this open as a help-wanted. If anyone is inclined to take a swing at fixing this, a PR is very welcome \ud83d\ude04. Yeah, I think that should be doable \ud83d\ude42 . Hi all! I wrote a little article on how to get started with custom extensions! Let me know if this helps you out \ud83d\ude0a\nhttps://medium.com/directus/how-to-setup-a-custom-extension-770d6ea48551. It would be nice if we had a global flag somewhere where we can read out the preferred formatting and format the interfaces based on that. Having settings for each individual interface seems like a bit much.. It's a \ud83d\udc1b which is going to \ud83d\udca5! . I'll handle it tonight / tomorrow morning (CEST) \ud83d\udc4d . Ah, great!. @benhaynes I'm not able to reproduce this issue.. What steps did you take to get this?\nThe value of the select gets split on the set delimiter. If the value isn't set it defaults to an empty string (which can be split) so not sure why you are getting this.. @WellingGuzman How could that be possible from an input[type=\"text\"]? I could implement a check nonetheless, but this issue can than also arise in other interfaces... That sounds like a logical step forward. This would essentially just be a o2m and a m2m for user specifically right?. it won't fit in 80 columns when they're on 1 line, because it has more supported types than any of the others \ud83d\ude09. Hi guys! I pushed a commit which should fix it. Could you please pull the latest and check it out @nithinga @benhaynes? \ud83d\ude42 . Thanks for the heads up @nithinga! I'll fix it asap. Fixed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/98886594dbfce16342fda3434a9af0b2b1497764. Please re-open if this didn't solve it for you. Hi @peremp! Is this an issue with certain interfaces or does it happen with every? . Could you try one of the authentication methods instead of just the session and see if that works? . Ohh, excuse me. I thought you were trying to modify the columns via the API. My bad!. Do you want the interface to encrypt on change or encrypt on save?. @WellingGuzman I meant send the request to hash on change in the interface. We won't hash client-side. Does the encryption endpoint also support checking a hashed value @WellingGuzman? Or is there going to be a separate check-hashed-style endpoint?. We will add in a debounce on the input, so it will only hash after 400ms or so inactivity. We keep the plaintext version client-side as long as the user is editing the item. When the user saves the item, we only save the hashed value.. Hey @marwie! Could you please open a new issue detailing your exact problem and server setup so we can reproduce and debug it? Thanks!. Thanks again @martinfojtik \ud83d\ude04 . I'm not able to reproduce this on master. @WellingGuzman I think the built bundle is missing (or breaking) TinyMCE somehow?. This problem didn't occur again after restarting my machine (twice), so it was probably a bug in caches. (Still very weird nonetheless). I'll close this for now. Hey @dsivokhin! I've made the extra delimiters optional in https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/453f1470a805fa7e2c3c72b169dc87fc4fe8e1d4. This will be merged into master soon, but you could use the develop branch if you need this option now.. Filtering should still work, but it will also show items which match the pattern next to only this with full word. This is different behavior than \"normal\", but could be very useful in certain situations nonetheless. . Hi @dsivokhin, that definitely shouldn't happen. I'll check it out! . Good catch!. This has been fixed in https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/55cce00ec101d1cbabb38149401ac77998ad2f37 and https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/9d4ed0bedb9aed7d72845a944b29698863646101 and will be added in master soon. . Hi @joshas! This has been fixed in commit https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/c3e74f4d7ef1d5c537f27badd495b390f6212a71 which will be merged into master soon \ud83d\udc4d . It seems like this particular error (depth0 is undefined) is a Handlebars error which is thrown when it is passed invalid JSON (https://stackoverflow.com/a/13021078).\nAs it uses the same data across browsers, this doesn't really explain why this happens only in Firefox.. We have been testing this extensively, but hadn't any luck at all replicating this issue. Could you please check if you maybe have any extensions active which could interface with the code execution? I'll close this for now as this issue has been open for a little while without any real progress.\nIf anyone has any specific additional information or a schema we can use to replicate this, we'd be more than happy to re-open and re-investigate this issue.. Interesting, I'll check it out!. Gotta love those sneaky caches\n. ~Hi @textoo, thanks for the report. I have just installed a fresh copy of Directus from the master branch and can't seem to reproduce this issue (also on Chrome 60)...~\n~Does this issue also happen on other interfaces or just wysiwyg_full? Lets try to specify the issue some more :)~\nUpdate: Found the issue, it's being fixed!. Hey @akubheka! It should be solved, seeing it\u2019s closed. Are you having this issue (or a similar problem)?. > I believe you should hide it instead of making it disabled\nYou mean the first option right? Hiding it would auto-set the default option to the first selected. If you combine this with required the user isn\u2019t required to pick an option, as the first one is already selected\n\nwhat would be the different here of having not allowing null\n\nWith allow_null: the first placeholder option is selectable and saves a value of ''\n\nnot being able to select it, but if you don\u2019t you can still select null\n\nI\u2019m not really following here, but you can\u2019t select the first option when you don\u2019t allow_null\n\nAre you suggesting this would be a better option (UI/UX)?\n\nThis is indeed purely a UX choice, as I don\u2019t want to enforce the first item to be the default when there hasn\u2019t been made a selection. This has been updated according to the info above.. @WellingGuzman Could you verify if the TinyMCE is correctly bundled in the minified app bundle?. @michlschmitt @textoo are these happening on the bundled download?. Hi @ngirardhg. Thanks for the info! \nWe believe this is related to https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/1737 which will hopefully be fixed in https://github.com/directus/directus/pull/1738. We'll keep you up to date on the progress here!. (Just speculating here), but could it be possible that it blocks every interaction as long as the column isn\u2019t set up properly? That\u2019s unexpected and unwanted behavior of course, but could be what is going on here. . Hey @awbranch, thanks for the heads up. I have fixed the issue in https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/9f19567dade2bc8f25eca79caa5ad1e745e0237e on the develop branch. It will be merged into master soon.. Hmm, this seems to be a Windows specific issue, as I have not been able to replicate this in Chrome/Firefox on MacOS Sierra. . @MarcinKuder It isn't possible to select from your uploaded files to include them yet. It's on the roadmap however.. @MarcinKuder Do you have some more specific info on which versions this is happening on?\nI've just tested the latest from the develop branch on Chrome 60 and Firefox 55 on Windows 10  and Chrome 56 on Windows 8, but haven't been able to replicate this issue.. I've added @prudolph81's fix in https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/548d5d5142d6803ef6a37b00f11c471549b81472. Please let me know if this commit fixes the issue on your end as well @MarcinKuder . The idea is that the editor changes height to accommodate the height of the content. The max-height option allows you to set the max-height it's allowed to grow, to prevent the page being completely covered by a huge editor.. Okay, just a wild guess here, what happens if you add height: 100% to the iframe as well? It might just limit the bounding box size.. . I'd like go get this fixed, but I'm not able to reproduce it myself... If anyone has a fix, please let me know \ud83d\ude42 . Thanks @podlebar, but that's only for the width right? The fix by @prudolph81 has the same effect I believe. \nDo you happen to know fix for the height not filling as well?. Yeah that's the thing. It does exactly that on Mac on every browser. Even the same versions of chrome and everything. I haven't been able to reproduce this issue via a virtual machine as well... \ud83e\udd14 \nI rather not hack in a fix just for windows.. I feel like there should be a solution to this to get it platform agnostic. Either find out a way to reproduce this, or wait until someone else comes up with a solution.. Since there are more pressing concerns, I guess it's probably the second. This is also on Windows @michlschmitt?. Interesting... \nOn what branch / version is this @michlschmitt @podlebar?\nI didn't have any issues on macOS Sierra or on macOS High Sierra\nFor full transparency, this is expected behavior (shown on Safari 11.0 macOS High Sierra): \n\n. We've been chasing a ghost here. This is already fixed on the develop branch latest which will hit release and master very soon. I just re-installed from pre-build .zip and that has the issue mentioned above.. Ah yes! Missed this.. This might also a great moment to add in the auto option which used the value of length to set the width @benhaynes . This has been fixed/implemented in #1762 on the develop branch and will hit master/release soon.. Hey @sethjgore, looks nice! We might want to keep an eye on https://github.com/directus/directus/pull/1762 to prevent conflicts as it aims to fix the min width issue.. @sethjgore I've merged the text-input size fix so we can focus on getting this branch perfect now \ud83d\ude42 \nYou already mentioned your editor auto-formatting the syntax. Directus uses EditorConfig (rules: .editorconfig) for formatting and xo (rules: .package.json) for linting the JavaScript. \nCould you maybe checkout if your editor has plugins for these?. @sethjgore These should do the trick\nhttps://github.com/sindresorhus/editorconfig-sublime\nhttps://github.com/sindresorhus/SublimeLinter-contrib-xo. Hi @jvmejias!\nThere's an option which allows you to see and modify the actual output HTML. That allows you to paste in your existing markup without having the editor change the values you described above. To add the view source button to the toolbar, you have to activate the View Source option in the interface's toolbar options setting.\n\n\nThe editor is configured by default to remove potentially unsafe HTML tags which can be used for XSS attacks in some specific cases. That means that as of now, it still removes the <iframe> in your markup. I'll create an option in the same interface settings to overrule this, as this is a critical option to have as end user!\nPlease let us know if this works out for you!. The option mentioned above is added in in https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/5464f0e59a8c1c53bdd0efe2680db662c9b6957a on the develop branch and will hit master soon.. The option I created sets the editor to allow all HTML tags and attributes as valid children, which theoretically means it should leave your markup untouched. Other then the white space issue I couldn\u2019t spot any other differences at first glance, but it does need some extra testing still. If you\u2019re able to test out the develop branch (which has this option), I\u2019d love to  get your feedback \ud83d\ude0a I\u2019ll see what I can do about the indentation getting messed up \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb. Hey @jvmejias, I've been looking into this and trying a number of options. It seems like this isn't something we can fix on our side.... \nI came across an open issue over on the repo of TinyMCE itself where the following answer is given:\n\nThis the the only thing about the HTML5 spec we don't allow since block based anchors are problematic in a rich text editor since how do you handle nested links and how do one make a UI to edit these block based links. You need some form of block link editor that can wrap things in blocks.\n\nhttps://github.com/tinymce/tinymce/issues/3142\nSo, for now. I'm afraid that the only option for now is either changing the original markup of your example, or not using the WYSIWYG editor for this purpose.. Hey @flo-f! Thanks for notifying us about this problem! I've moved it over to a new issue ( #1896 ) as it's unrelated, though similar, to this one.\nI'm not sure if an option would be necessary, as I actually can't think of a situation where this behavior is wanted, but I'd love to hear what you think. Lets discuss this further over at the other issue!. Hey @peremp! We all haven't been able to reproduce this.. As @WellingGuzman mentions, the getTotalCount has the right count and I'm not facing any loaders popping up either. JS execution keeps a scroll handler, as that's used for more than just the infinite scrolling. If you have any additional info or a specific schema we can use to reproduce this, we'll re-open this issue and get to the bottom of it!\n\nTotal items: 102, Rows per page: 40, Search query result count: 65. Hi @Sirjoseph94! \nI'm glad you figured it out!\nThis is indeed a duplicate of #1770.\nThanks for the help @jvmejias!. Hey @dsivokhin! Good catch.. The JSON not setting the value on entering just the example has just been fixed on the develop branch in https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/4aa561f5243d78086d4f9f516592974eaeb7a481.\nFor the more pressing multiselect issue.. I'm going to check it out right away!. This was fixed on the develop branch in https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/cf887e848f5cec795d0a720227b0e279d683d56d and will hit master soon.\nPlease let me know if you're able to test this on develop and if it works for you \ud83d\ude42 . I've changed to interface to match on event.key === 'Enter' and event.key === ',' instead of the keyCodes 188 and 33. I guess that should do it. Could you test out the develop branch and confirm @dsivokhin?. Turned out to be an implementation error.. Thanks for reporting this as well. As it's a duplicate, lets move all further discussion to the original issue #1575 . Thanks for reporting this as well. As it's a duplicate, lets move all further discussion to the original issue  #1804.. Hi there @chrisbenjamin! Author of the tutorial article here\nWhile I agree the docs are a little sparse (that's already a WIP), I can't reproduce your issues with the two provided examples.\nHave you followed every step separately or just downloaded the example code from GitHub?\nPlease let me know if you have any additional info on why the Medium article didn't work out for you, as I'd love to get it \ud83d\udcaf. For reference: the columns airline, airport_departure, airport_arrival, stopovers are relational themselves as well. We've moved this over to the Directus feature request tool as this is a feature request and not an actual issue with the current implementation.\nhttps://request.getdirectus.com/r/134. Hi @dsivokhin! Good catch. Just for the record, do the values get saved correctly? Or does it only save the values of the tags no.1 multiple times?. Hey @dsivokhin! Both these issues should've been fixed by my last two commits on the develop branch. Could you please confirm this on your end?. @dsivokhin I think opening a new issue would be best so we won't get confused with the already resolved other problem in this one.\nPlease do include as much specific information as you can, as I'm currently not able to reproduce this error... Closed by #1831. Closed by #1831. Thanks @idelb!. And we try to keep our issue tracker from looking like the one from the VS Code project \ud83d\ude05 \nUpdate: no burn, I <3 vs code.

If anyone is inclined to take a swing at fixing this, a PR is very welcome \ud83d\ude04. Hey @lex111! Thank you so much for your contribution. We'd love it if you could update this PR to merge into develop instead of master, as master is our live stable release.\nAbout the big diff, it seems like only the line endings have changed.. I'm not terribly sure how that's happening since you're using the same build tool as us. It doesn't really matter after all, since the bundled file will be overwritten by future updates and releases anyway. \nThanks again and have a nice day \ud83d\ude42 . Awesome @W01fw00d! Highly appreciated \ud83d\ude04 \nTo get you started:\n- The user listing styles are in assets/sass/_users.scss\n- the file listing styles in assets/sass/_files.scss.\nIdeally, these share the same styles for the general layout of the page\nThe markup is a little more spread out.., and is possibly harder to alter:\n- The cards themselves of files/users are in app/templates/modules/files/card-view.handlebars and app/templates/modules/users/card-view.handlebars respectively\n- The files-cards Backbone model / collection and main view is in: app/modules/files/, users' one is app/modules/users/\nPlease let us know if you need any info or help! For quicker messaging, you are very welcome to join us over on Slack: https://slack.getdirectus.com. The Tiles items view uses the same off wrapping as files used to..  \n\nWe should give all these views the same styling. In what issue? Did you open a new one? @wellingguzman . Hey @cgarnier! Thanks for the heads up.\nFor reference, the same happens for the other ways of passing the access_token (f.e. the param). This has been closed by https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/395c1774e570b7c20ae9075a91ccf93b3ecbc239 on the develop branch and will release with master soon.. Hey @cavp28!\nThank you very much for your contribution!. Interesting\nI'm able to upload a photo but am not able to select an existing one / import an url on develop latest... @hjbarraza Do you have some more specific details about the env? What directus version? What PHP version/server etc etc. Anything we can use to reproduce the issue basically :). I think he's referring to the access_token @WellingGuzman \n. Hey @airbenich! This is fixed in https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/9d3263c89cabc7bbba64433ccdd195725ae81c2c. Please let me know if the problem persists after upgrading to this commit.. Let's just hide the notification on this particular page. It's not a real bug as it doesn't influence the actual saving, but it feels a bit weird from a UX perspective. I changed something -> hit save -> I get told nothing changed -> it has saved. Hey @rande! Thanks for your input. While I understand what you're saying, there are others with different opinions on this. We'll add this in as a user configurable option soon!. This is perfect @nilsborg, thanks!. Could you check the upload_max_size setting in your php.ini? . There might be a similar option for the whole maximum post request size. I think it's something like post_max_size?. Bonus fix: there is some margin to the left of the image box which seems a bit.. off. @WellingGuzman I was referring to this space \ud83d\ude09 \n\n@benhaynes What do you think about this design wise, should it align with the button and the title, or is this the way it was intended to be?\n. I'll \ud83d\udd25 this \ud83d\udc1b with \u2764\ufe0f . Hmm, seems to work correctly now. Let's blame the #cache.. Hey @cgarnier! Thanks for the input. Could you in future issues please state why this change is wanted or required? Thanks!. Hi @mikeful! I'm pretty sure that's the cause of this problem.\nNote to self: check if this.model.set(<column_name>, <set_value>); gets called in the referenced other columns on change in the map. (probably not, which would explain this error). Hey @cgarnier! Thanks for the input.\nNearly every interface has a number of options to pick from. The slider interface for example has these exact options.\nI'm going to move over the request for extra validation options in the numeric interface to our feature request tool and close this issue, as it's not really an issue.\nHave a nice day! \ud83d\ude04 . The Brooklyn problem is solved, but now it shows the most bottom-right position of the map zoomed in fully.....\n\n. Probably because there aren't any visible items in the table. This was fixed in 983c91efe57ff91f9777ad6890c64f95f9514311 on the develop branch and will release in master soon. It seems like it works fine on first load, but after navigating back and forth between tables the problem starts. Could that specific one have been caused by https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/1941 @bratsun?. I believe it is yes @bratsun. At the moment, all core developers are working fulltime on the next major version of the platform, so I'll have to leave this open as a help-wanted. If anyone is inclined to take a swing at fixing this, a PR is very welcome \ud83d\ude04. For future reference:\nDirectus uses native browser validation on the input[type=number], but didn't set the step attribute which causes the browser to return false on the validation method for floats.. This has been fixed by 56301d4e8c42a44576ae21fa02bd0c8af1c92cc9 on the develop branch and will release soon.. @WellingGuzman I'm thinking map is the array method. Can't find property 'map' of null sounds to me like we try to map over an array, but that array is now null for some reason. Temp fix by @flo-f:\nAs I needed the URLs to remain absolute, I modified the file /app/core/interfaces/wysiwyg_full/interface.js by adding a fixed option convert_urls right above TinyMCE initialization (currently close to line 210 of interface.js):\njavascript\noptions.convert_urls = false;\ntinyMCE.init(options); // this line already exists - don't duplicate ;-). This has been fixed by 71abff9f6d4503ad0e0c005894461eebb6cbedf1 on the develop branch and will release soon.. Here you go!\nschema_copy.sql.zip. This was on 56301d4e8c42a44576ae21fa02bd0c8af1c92cc9, but it seems to have fixed itself over the weekend... Lets blame the cache. I'll close this for now and reference this one if it were to happen again. Hey @Hezion! Thanks for the fix. Can we think of a way to know the new order value based on the records above and below the current one? Do we really need the whole list before you can reorder?. @benhaynes This idea swaps the sort value of two items, so it doesn't really matter what the actual sort value was right? For all we know, you swap sort=125 with sort=A5Tx. We're redesigning how sorting works in the next major version (7.0). We have taken this into consideration.. I quite like the idea of auto-hiding blacklisted columns in API responses. Is this something we can spec in the API @benhaynes @WellingGuzman, or are there any major problems we can think of right away which prevent us from doing something like this?. Hey @BennerGe! Thanks for the heads up. Are there more characters we can think of that might cause similar problems @benhaynes @WellingGuzman?. This is probably going to be a way bigger overall thing to fix, since those conversions will probably be different for most languages \ud83d\ude33. @WellingGuzman Are we going to implement the slug logic server side or client side?. Yeah.. The alternative is shooting a \"slug\"-request to the API on input of the slug interface (debounced ofc), but that also feels a bit overkill as the client-side implementation works just as fine (and is probably faster). This has been fixed in ac4ea4db97e5138aa72afaec176be9357c07e0e6 on the develop branch and will be released soon!\n\n. Hey @BennerGe! Thanks for the information. Maybe the PHP config was cached or something had to be restarted in order for the settings to take effect?. At the moment, all core developers are working fulltime on the next major version of the platform, so I'll have to leave this open as a help-wanted. If anyone is inclined to take a swing at fixing this, a PR is very welcome \ud83d\ude04\nPs: This already has been implemented in the alpha version of 7.0. Hey @Alekshar! Could you maybe try out the non-zipped non-pre-built version from the master branch here on github? I'm curious if this is an issue in the actual source code or something is wrong in the buildchain \ud83d\udc4d . Hi @Alekshar!\nThe image-selector-browsing-icon is not an issue, but a not-yet-implemented feature: https://request.getdirectus.com/r/119.\nIt's a nice feature to have, but I'm afraid it won't get implemented soon, since it requires us to write a custom TinyMCE file browser and we have our hands full with more pressing issues.....\nWe'd love a PR with this implementation of course \ud83d\ude04 . @WellingGuzman Could you checkout the bundling script? Seems like there is something missing. @WellingGuzman Any updates on this? Has it been \"officially\" solved in later builds? \nI'll close this for now as I'm not able to reproduce it on the latest version. If anyone else runs into this issue, please let us know and we'll reopen the issue. Ughh this minification vs tinymce weirdness is driving me crazy! We use a completely reworked builchain in the next major version of Directus, so at least it (should) (be/)is fixed there.. Some weeks have passed since this issue was reported and we haven't been able to reproduce it since. We'll reopen if this issue comes up again or is reproduces.. @WellingGuzman We probably should checkout the design reason btw, I'm pretty sure this problem happens in Dutch as well. Yes please. I don't know what happened exactly, but some button probably got a max-width it shouldn't have. It's not something we go in and fix for everything now, but it's a good thing to remind this issue the next time we add max-width: $too-small; to the CSS somewhere :). It has almost been three weeks since this was reported and we've not been able to reproduce it so far.. We'll re-open this and continue investigating once there is more information available. Lightning fast @WellingGuzman \u26a1\ufe0f\u26a1\ufe0f . This was fixed in ba07c00435424254c3e07d6c18e80417472e14d9 on the develop branch and will be released in master soon. Hi @BennerGe!\nENUM values are stored in the length field in SQL, and an empty value isn't valid. That means that this setup works:\n\nThat being said, we should definitely implement instructions and some sort of warning or a better error.. That's understandable, dropdown_enum is the only dropdown interface for which this is the case. . @WellingGuzman Should we add a way to add instructions to this view?\nWe could introduce a instructions or description field to UIComponent which gets shown in this whitespace:\n\nWe can add important notes on interfaces a general description. What do you think?. Hi @mmeester!\nThanks for the heads up, and thanks for your PR!\nWrapping the values of the checkboxes in another set of delimiters is in fact a feature (not a bug) of the checkboxes interface, however, the option should've been turned off for the wysiwyg_full buttons.\nI have just pushed a commit to turn this option off for the wysiwyg_full buttons. I'll still merge your fix, as it introduces a safety net for people who already have wysiwyg_full setup with the delimiter option still on.\nGroetjes!. Hey @moritzw1! Thanks for addressing this. Could you please check (and confirm) if the keys root_url and root_thumb_url are pointing to the right paths in /api/configuration.php?\nphp\n// This is the url where all the media will be pointing to\n// here all assets will be (yourdomain)/storage/uploads\n// same with thumbnails (yourdomain)/storage/uploads/thumbs\n'root_url' => '/<subpath>/storage/uploads',\n'root_thumb_url' => '/<subpath>/storage/uploads/thumbs',\n<subpath> should be your actual subpath. Hmm... Have you any other information we could use to reproduce this error? I haven't been able to reproduce this error on my own install. The only issue I came across was the paths in configuration and config not matching. \nJust to make sure, did you update the DIRECTUS_PATH key in api/config.php as well?. With the core developer team working full time on the next major version (7.0), non-system critical issues like this one unfortunately get put on the back burner.. \nIf anyone feels inclined to take a swing at this issue before we get to it: as always, a PR is very welcome \ud83d\ude04 \nThe overlay gets openend here: https://github.com/directus/directus/blob/master/app/core/interfaces/single_file/interface.js#L67-L110\nThe overlay itself is managed by:\nhttps://github.com/directus/directus/blob/master/app/modules/tables/views/OverlayEditView.js. @philleepflorence The build branch has all those .js files bundled into 1 main directus.min.js.

This has been fixed in ac4ea4db97e5138aa72afaec176be9357c07e0e6 on the develop branch and will be released soon!. @WellingGuzman Is this behavior intentional?. @WellingGuzman Is this documented somewhere?.

This has been fixed in 44e9c81ae12213c8b1a6b37547f7f0a38583835d on the develop branch. Will be released on master soon. Hey @razuro! I actually just wrote an article on this subject yesterday! It's over on our Medium publication:\nhttps://medium.com/directus/3rd-party-authentication-2da642576dcd?source=linkShare-d577fb4926a5-1510195202\n. What does this fix exactly @BennerGe??. Thanks! \ud83d\ude04 . That's the difficult question. It can't be NULL or it they'll be invisible, but we can't just set it to a value as well, since it's user configurable..... @benhaynes We should discuss this a little more seeing that this isn't an implementation bug, but rather a design-problem. Can we / do we want to automatically default to the first status as defined in configuration.php (directus_settings in 7.0)?. Right! . At the moment, all core developers are working fulltime on the next major version of the platform, so I'll have to leave this open as a help-wanted. If anyone is inclined to take a swing at fixing this, a PR is very welcome \ud83d\ude04\nWe'll make sure this isn't a problem in 7.0, but nonetheless: if anyone wants to fix this in 6.x, a PR is welcome!. I'm wondering if the limit on 200 is a bug or a feature.. I can imagine fetching all the related items of so many records will take quite a while to finish.\nCould you enlighten us with some wisdom @WellingGuzman?. @WellingGuzman Can you confirm if this has been fixed in the meantime (in either the current or next version of the API)?. Ah! Thanks :). Could you confirm it works for you on the develop branch @BennerGe?. This might be a duplicate of https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/1941. No that's okay! Rather have multiple duplicates than no report at all \ud83d\ude04 \nI'll close this as we release 6.4.4 tomorrow including this fix \ud83d\udc4d . Hi @tom-wmg \nThis issue hasn't been reported before and I haven't been able to reproduce this myself on a clean local install so far.\nWith Directus being able to be hosted and used virtually anywhere, it's very hard for maintainers and contributors to figure out what is going on without having the necessary information. Could you please update your original post with more information so we can reproduce your env and figure out what is going on? You have left us hardly any info to work with..\nAlso, it would be very convenient if you could either share the table schema, or describe generally what tables are linked in what way. @WellingGuzman There is a zip in the previous comment, isn't that what you are looking for?. Is that requirement documented somewhere @wellingguzman?. This turns out to be a way nastier bug than I had expected.. The Router actually gets the right path when clicking the link, but the main page content view doesn't update to reflect the navigation for some reason..\nAFAICT:\nSteps to Reproduce\n\nNavigate to the extension\nNavigate to a table listing and/or edit view\nTry navigating to the extension.\n\nBehavior\nThe first navigation to the extension succeeds.\nThe navigation to the table / listview also succeeds.\nAny subsequent request to the extension either renders an empty page or refreshes the last view (listing / edit view)\n. @danhipke You're completely right! That's the way we're designing it to be in 7.0 too. Normally, I'd say we should look into this and come up with a solid solution, but since we're already actively working on a complete rewrite of all of this in Vue, lets fix it the way you proposed so we have a fix for 6.x out there \ud83d\ude04 . @danhipke Much appreciated :). I'll close this one as it has been fixed in #2075 \ud83d\ude04 \nThanks again @danhipke !.

Hey @RudolfFussek! \nIt is currently not possible to have the slug interface to check for uniqueness, but I really like the idea!\nIn order to add it into our workstream we need to get it to the top of https://request.getdirectus.com/\nIn the meantime, you could create a custom Interface (a copy of slug) that checks the uniqueness of the value field.\nI'll close this for now since new features should go to the request tool.

Ref #2076 . @WellingGuzman Is there anything we can do to fix / debug this? I haven't been able to reproduce as well... Hey @adbutler123!\nFeel free to join us over on Slack if you keep having troubles installing the platform or have any other questions! As we all know, trying to learn webdev & learning the ins and outs of a new platform can be quite a bumpy ride.\nI'll close this issue seeing it's not a bug or issue in the platform itself. We're hard at work on a complete rewrite of the platform (v7.0) which also comes with completely rewritten docs, so while it doesn't help right away, it should make installing the platform an easier process!\nVielen Dank f\u00fcr Ihre Geduld. is this really expected @benhaynes @wellingguzman?

If anyone is inclined to take a swing at fixing this, a PR is very welcome \ud83d\ude04\nWe've reworked the exception handler in the next major version of the platform (7.0), AFIAK this problem shouldn't occur anymore in that version. @WellingGuzman could you confirm?. Hey @alangv! Could you log the value of apiv1 + 'auth/request-token'? . Could you make sure directus is installed at that location? . We've reworked the nested item saving in 7.0 \ud83d\udc4d \nI'll close this issue due to inactivity. It's most likely that the server timed out during save.. Thanks for the detailed list!. What editor? What are you talking about?. This issue has been closed due to inactivity. If this error pops up again we'll re-open it.. Closed due to inactivity. Ahh! Gotcha. I'll go through it right away!. This looks awesome!\nMinor nitpick tho, should we move this to be an option in the toolbar_options checkboxes? It technically adds another button to the toolbar, just like Tables or Insert Media. Thoughts @jedimonkey ?\nOther than that, great work!. Good call \ud83d\udc4d . I don't know if a permanent note is the best option, since it's not applicable to all permissions, but it should at least be documented somewhere. I should add it as a note to the medium article about permissions. @wellingguzman, could you check if it's in the regular docs?. Hey @rmNyro!\nHave you tried the Hide Table option in the junction table's settings view? That sounds like exactly what you are looking for :) This option hides the table for every user, but still allows Directus to manage it.\n\nIf that's too \"global\" for you, you could also blacklist the table from showing up in the system for this specific user's usergroup or override the nav completely for finegrain control. Our Medium article on permissions goes a little further in depth on setting up user groups: Medium \u2014 Working with Permissions.\nLet me know if that does the trick for you \ud83d\ude04 .

This is fixed by #2039 and will be released into master soon!. @wellingguzman The field for the nav override section is available to enter for the public group. This setting has no effect whatsoever since people can\u2019t login to directus from the public group to begin with. . In the directus admin application when you\u2019re editing user groups you can also edit the public group. The settings you can alter here are useless, since they\u2019re not used at all. To avoid confusion, these should be removed. Therefore, it\u2019s a trivial optimization.\nYou can treat this issue as a reminder for 7.0 that we don\u2019t make the same mistake.

If anyone is inclined to take a swing at fixing this, a PR is very welcome \ud83d\ude04. Update: I can confirm that the next version of the API (under development: directus/api) is significantly faster. This new version of the API will be the default for Directus v7 and onwards. Hey @simonking76!\nThanks for the heads up. I wasn't able to reproduce this issue.. Do you have some more specific info we can use to reproduce this issue? (What browser / how did you install Directus / etc)\nAbout the other WYSIWYG editor, it's a Medium style editor, so the 'toolbar' will only show up when you select a piece of content to edit.. This issue has been closed due to inactivity. Do note that this will be extremely hard to implement in Directus 6, due to the way the API manages the authentication session.. This is confirmed working in the next major version (7.0) \ud83d\ude42 .

Hey @cgarnier!\nAs of right now, there is no way to filter for a specific language. The API will always return all available translations. However, we are working on a new lang parameter which does just this! It will be launched in the next major version of the API (2.0) which is in active development as we speak!. Hey @pedrohh! The next major version of the API is scheduled for release candidate in 8-10 weeks, which will contain this functionality :) . This issue has been closed due to inactivity.

The Caddy example has the redirects setup correctly, maybe that helps out in terms of figuring out the right Azure config as well :)\nhttps://github.com/caddyserver/examples/blob/master/directus/Caddyfile#L14-L29. Hey @ivansf!\nDo you have some more info for us to replicate this issue? I'm particularly interested in the specific version of Directus you're using and how you've installed it (git vs build branch).\nIf possible, could you provide us with a database dump where this problem is happening? That'll help us out a lot in the debugging process.\nThanks in advance!. We're rebuilding the complete sorting / view logic of Directus in version 7.0, which is in active development and scheduled for a (beta) release end of Q2. Since that's taking up most of the time of our developers, non system-critical issues will be put on the backburner..  \nAs always, a PR is to solve this is in 6.x is very welcome!. This has been fixed by #2109 thanks to @shevaroller and will be released to the master branch soon \ud83d\udc4d . This is being implemented in the next major version of the API. Unfortunately, (due to the small core team size) we won't have the resources to implement this in the current version as well. \nIf anyone wants to take a swing at this (in 6.x) a PR is very welcome \ud83d\ude04 . Hey @kkar!\nThis is admittedly a bit confusing in the video. The users group displayed in this video is in fact different from the main Directus Users (directus_users) table that stores the users that have access to Directus itself.\nCreating your own users table can be useful if you want to implement an account system that's separate from the Directus auth system but we recommend to use the \"native\" Directus Users table, since that also gives you the power to manage permissions and use the auth tokens flow.\nIn conclusion:\n\nI mean, is it even possible to use directus' core user table to store users and assign them to groups\n\nYes!\n\nby using a form created with directus?  \n\nNo! The user edit view is as is and can't be modified (as of right now).\nWe are working on allowing the admin user to change the fields that are available in the user table from version 7.0 onwards :)\nHopefully that answers your question. Feel free to join us over on Slack if you have any other questions / recommendations / feedback!. Closed due to inactivity. If anyone else experiences the same issue, please let us know and we'll reopen the issue.. Awesome addition! \ud83d\udc4d . @WellingGuzman Is this expected behavior?. Hey @u12206050! We're adding an additional option to the permissions in version 7.0 that makes this possible.. Hey @ksraghavendra! Could you make sure the PHP user has the right permissions in the Directus folders? Directus is trying to create the storage folder, but seemingly doesn't have the right permissions to do so on the server.. >  It would help if this is indicated correctly in the pre-installation checklist.\nYou're right! The core team is currently reworking the docs for the next major version (7.0) and I'll make sure it gets added in there \ud83d\udc4d \nGlad you figured it out!. Hey @TechnicallyJoe!  \nWe're moving most of the configuration in those two files to directus_settings, which makes them editable from the admin UI \ud83d\ude42 \nWe're keeping certain API internals in those files though (like the PHP hooks). Would having http webhooks solve your issue? https://request.getdirectus.com/r/9 . We're working full time trying to get the next major version of the platform out ASAP. We're targetting for an beta release at the end of april!. We've reworked the complete auth flow in the next major version of the platform (7.0), so this won't be a problem anymore.\nSeeing the core team is working fulltime on this next major version, we unfortunately don't have the resources to implement this for 6.x as well.

There is no way of reproducing the issue now (or knowing what is going on in the first places). Thanks. Hey @ca057! It regrets me to say that there isn't a \"good\" way to actually do this as far as I'm concerned in 6.x. We've redesigned the way extensions / interfaces work for the upcoming 7.0 to use a package.json / npm.\nThe \"best\" way for now would be to include the dependency as a file in a vendor folder and adding it in your interface by importing it with requirejs. Hey @iKonrad! Thanks for the heads up. If possible, could you share an SQL dump of your schema so others can reproduce this immediately? The core team is working full time on the next major version (7.0), so if anyone feels inclined to take a swing at this, PRs are very welcome \ud83d\ude04 . This is a duplicate of #1567 . @WellingGuzman any pointers for @lokers?. Looks like Twig is trying to parse the Handlebars template..? @WellingGuzman . This error comes from the API directly, meaning that we can fix it by either sending over the group on this save as well from the app, or using a PATCH request to save just the status change. The second is cleaner (and what we'll be doing in 7.0), but is probably way harder to implement in 6.x... Oh! That opens up perspectives.. The user edit view uses a regular edit view, so either the interface that is used doesn't call the 'value changed' code or the value is set to nothing.

Thanks \ud83d\ude42 . @AteoMarcel We're working on the next major version of the application (7.0) and api (2.0).

Does the bookmark contain the filters after a hard refresh? \nTrying to figure out if the application state is out of sync or if maybe something goes wrong while saving the bookmark.\nWe\u2019ve redesigned the data flow for directus 7.0 and I can confirm that filters persist correctly in the next version \ud83d\ude04. At the moment, all core developers are working fulltime on the next major version (7.0) of the platform, so I'll have to leave this open as a help-wanted. If anyone is inclined to take a swing at fixing this, a PR is very welcome \ud83d\ude04\nPs. I can confirm this is working as expected in the re-build 7.0 \ud83d\ude09 . Hey @danieljones97! Thanks for the heads up. This is a duplicate of issue #2062 . Hey @recumbentbirder, thanks for the heads up! \nIn the next major version, we\u2019re not displaying the JS errors in notifications at all, but will limit it to something more generic and user friendly. The full error with debug info will be in the dev console. . Hey @tumraja! What are you thinking of adding? If it's useful for everyone, we could also merge it in the main repo!\n\nI want to add custom plugin in the WYSIWYG_FULL by extending the core plugin base WYSIWYG_FULL.\n\nYou should be able to copy the wysiwyg_full interface to the customs folder and customize it however you want.\n\nI want all my custom plugins should be located in the custom directory but still using the core infrastructure.\n\nThis is what the customs folder does. The app itself doesn't differentiate between interfaces in the core folder vs the customs folder. The split is just there to make sure people don't accidentally delete core interfaces that are needed for the system to work properly.\nLet me know if that answers your question :). You\u2019ll be pleased to hear that we\u2019ve redesigned how extensions are built and distributed in the next major version (7.0)! We\u2019re even working on a marketplace to allow developers to host and distribute these extensions in a centralized way \ud83d\ude04\n\nHow the custom plugin can be linked or hooked to wysiwyg_fullinterface to the customs folder?\nWould you be able to provide the example for this? Thank you.\n\n(I might understand your question wrong, but) you don\u2019t. You copy it to the customs folder, so you\u2019re making a direct copy that does the same things. There is no way to extend an existing one from the customs folder. It\u2019s only possible to create new ones there. Hey @EnricoMonese!\nThis doesn't sound like intended behavior!. See #2101 for updated configuration_sample.php. Related to #2100 . @WellingGuzman @benhaynes What are your thoughts on this? . @benhaynes we could / should write an Medium article on how to setup user management for your app using directus. So let me get this straight.\nWhat we (ideally) want is the ability to create new users from the public group. Eg everyone can register as a user. BUT, we want to be able to assign them to a specific group. We don't want to allow the public user to set this group, as that would be a major security risk (the user can register themselves as admin and cause all sorts of trouble).\nDoes that sound about right @lastlink @BennerGe?\nWe never really saw the Directus User table as the table you'd use to manage users in the past, but with all these advancements in permissions, workflow, and auth, it makes total sense to me. Thoughts @benhaynes?. > is this part of the core? how do you set filters?\nYeah! You can add filters to do whatever you want on certain events in configuration.php\n@lastlink . Hey @horngperng-pxs! Have you entered the correct values in the visible columns and visible columns template interface options? \n. Just to make sure, could you checkout the article I wrote on setting up relationships to check if it matches \ud83d\ude42?\n\nmy pages table got a title\n\nSo your visible columns would be set to something like title,id with your visible columns template {{ title }} ({{id}}) or something similar to render the data. Glad you figured it out \ud83d\ude04!. Hey @ksraghavendra!\nI can't seem to reproduce this issue on my latest install.. \nDo you have some more specific information we can use to reproduce this issue? What browser / how did you install / any errors in api/logs / any errors in the devtools etc. Hey @americanblond!\nWhat would you suggest is the best user flow in this case? I'm working on the next major version of the platform and like to get this right in there \ud83d\ude42 \nWe save the view options to the DB, so the screen looks the same the way you left it last. However, if you view the page and add a new column, it still retrieves the old saved settings, which don't include the new column...... I'm not sure if it makes sense to force add the new column to everyones view preferences whenever a new column is created seeing not every user might want that... \ud83e\udd14 \ud83e\udd14 \ud83e\udd14 \nWhat are your thoughts on this? \ud83d\ude42 \n. I'll close this as it's not so much a technical error, but a poorly designed user interaction. Hey @shevaroller! Thanks for the help \ud83d\ude04 \nCloses #2033. @WellingGuzman True, but better this re-rendering drawback than the thing not working at all \ud83d\ude04 . Thanks for the heads up @konradwww!. Duplicate of #1906 I've reopened that one. Hey @mrleblanc101! This is actually not a bug, but the intended behavior. However, I really like the idea you just mentioned. For \"regular\" users, it makes more sense to have the translated value shown, however, for admin users it might make more sense to show the total amount to give a better \"unopinionated\" view of the data. . Hey @GerMcMahon! Good to hear that you figured it out \ud83d\ude42 Directus 6.x indeed uses sessions to manage login state. From the next major version onwards we move away from sessions in favor of an access token based system (JWT), so that hopefully solves problems with load balancers too \ud83d\udc4d . I'm not sure what you mean by \"enterprise token authorities\", but the next version will in fact support SCIM endpoints, so you can manage your users from an external service like Okta. . Hey @dramosBC. The current implementation of the many to many interface doesn\u2019t support setting fields in the junction table as well directly. You could edit the fields in the junction table directly, or copy the many to many interface and create your own custom implementation to support this feature.\nThe core directus team is working full time on getting the next major version of the platform (7) ready for launch. Next to support for many-to-many-many relations (sometimes refered to as matrix fields, I would love to natively support this feature in the next version of the platform.. You can target the elements in the DOM directly, add an eventlistener to your own no.1 input and set the changes in your no.2 interface on change of the first.\nDirectus 6 has no internal way of listening / reacting to other interfaces. . Hey @dramosBC! We don\u2019t have a native way of exporting / importing data between environments yet. You should be good by just copying over the raw DB records from one env to another.. @wellingguzman I think it\u2019s the directus docker image failing the checks. . Hey @BenSegni! Could you confirm the directus_path is setup right?\nhttps://github.com/directus/directus/blob/master/api/config_sample.php#L31. Is apache setup correctly with mod_rewrite? Maybe the API URL doesn't get rewritten to the correct format?. It's most likely a configuration issue on your specific instance... @BenSegni Did you copy over the .htaccess files? That's what controls the rewrites.\nAll requests to /api/<whatever> are remapped to /api.php by those files. I know some FTP clients hide hidden files (starting with .) by default... What is the hosting provider you use? Is there a way we can reproduce the exact same setup? We\u2019ve used the platform on multiple different environments (including shared hosts) but never ran in to this specific issue \ud83d\ude1e\nLove to get it sorted out!. Good to hear @BenSegni!! \n@wellingguzman, I\u2019ve never had or heard of this problem with the htaccess file when using it in a sub folder before. Can we checkout whats up with that? \nThanks for helping out what\u2019s causing this @BenSegni. Heya! Could you try reinstalling the vendor dependencies just to make sure there isn\u2019t anything funky going on in there? You should be good by deleting the vendor folder and running composer install. Lemme know if that helped \ud83d\ude42. > (or perhaps this GitHub issue is enough?)\nNah, people don't tend to look in the depths of closed issues for important information. @blaasvaer please keep in mind that this is a community driven free and open source project. There are many people spending countless hours trying to build a CMS that works well for absolutely nothing in return. \nUnfortunately, the setup process wasn\u2019t user friendly enough for you to be able to quickly get started with the platform. I\u2019ve added an issue to the repo for the next version so we can add a notice to the edit and listing views to make sure the user knows when there aren\u2019t fields setup. \nThanks for the feedback and I wish you best of luck finding a solution that fits your problem best. . Heya! There should be a tinyint column called single in directus tables that controls that.\nHave you seen this error before @wellingguzman?. Odd!

Hey @jasonmarysael! You can set this up with any of the relational interfaces (M2O, O2M, or M2M) see https://medium.com/directus/understanding-relationships-it-isnt-complicated-35e0dcf78450.\nAs @honzabilek4 rightfully pointed out: it\u2019s fairly uncommon to end up with a scenario like this.. Do you have a specific example of what you\u2019re trying to achieve? There might be a better way altogether \ud83d\ude04. I'm not sure what you're talking about @jorgench... Could you try to explain this a little bit more?. Hey @khromov!\nDirectus requires the use of some sort of rewriting engine to operate properly. Seeing that the endpoints are generated based on the user schema, there is no way for the platform to include all possible endpoints in just PHP. You will have to run a webserver alongside PHP that rewrites all paths to /api/api.php.\nYou could try implementing some sort of router script yourself (http://php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php) if you want to run Directus solely with PHPs built in server. Otherwise, you'll have to run it locally with something like WAMP/MAMP, or a local Apache / Nginx / Caddy installation.. Could you check the value of DIRECTUS_PATH in config.php? I think that might be the thing that controls where Directus redirects to on login:\nhttps://github.com/directus/directus/blob/ab5a935073324389db2e3444b5f1272753f7780f/api/config_sample.php#L31. Danke sch\u00f6n \ud83d\ude42 . Ref https://stackoverflow.com/a/2184541/4859211. We're migrating all the 6-related PRs and issues to a new 6-legacy repo and making v7 the main version on the directus/directus repo \ud83d\ude42. Hey @Muphet! I tried your endpoint but I don't see any zdjecia field. Anyhow, a multiple_files is the same as a regular many to many and should be returned when using that depth parameter. Setting it to 1 fetches 1 level \"deep\",\u00a0setting depth=2 fetches 2 levels deep, etc.. I see it now without being authenticated. As soon as you log into the CMS, you're cookie will be send to the API as well. Therefore, when you're logged into the CMS, the \"raw\" API endpoints will return like you're logged in.. Could you check what happens when you install fresh on this server? It looks like the user you're trying to log in with doesn't have permission to read from the directus_files table, but I'm not 100% sure. Could you double check (in the DB directly) what group the user has you're trying to login with and if that user group has the right permissions to read the directus_files table? . Ah! That makes sense. I'll add a ticket to double check this in the upcoming version \ud83d\ude04 . The best way would be to create a Hook. A hook allows you to run any arbitrary PHP which you can use to trigger your static build process elsewhere.\n\nwhen will be released directus 7???\n\nAs soon as possible! We really want to release, but we ran into some issues while testing we'd like to fix before properly releasing it \ud83d\ude42 . You can target nested values using Dot Notation:\nfilters[field.nestedField]=value. > This users only should can login into the vue app. Not into directus\nThe directus users table controls who has access to directus, so what your asking isn\u2019t available. . Good to hear you figured it out \ud83d\ude04 . Why is GPL-3.0 specifically preventing you from using it? . (I'm not a lawyer)\nUsage of the Directus platform itself is not bound by any licenses is it? \nAs far as I know, the license only applies to the code. Only if you were to make your own Fork of Directus to add in some proprietary strictly licensed code and then re-publish it as a new project you would run into the licensing business.\nAlso, Drupal is GPL-2 licensed \ud83d\ude09 . @Chris553 Could you elaborate? How did Directus using GPL-3.0 restrict you from using the platform? . @benhaynes apparently the API has the whole list in it already:\nhttps://github.com/directus/api/blob/6051b07c3f8b5c8c6eb295ce26c3943fbe14d966/src/helpers/all.php#L590\nHowever, just copying this into the interface options will cause a huge unusuable drop down. We might be better off coming up with a new interface to select a time zone. Maybe a map like the macOS settings?\n\n. > Is this an issue with the schema file?\nWe ran into this issue right when we launched 7 :/\nShould be fixed in 7.0.1 though. Could you confirm with a fresh install?\n\nHow did this breaking bug get through the Release Candidates?\n\nCause we have a tiny team working on it and people don\u2019t really bother testing out RCs unfortunately.. \nHoe hard ik \u2018t ook probeer, ik kan niet alles in m\u2019n eentje \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc48\ud83c\udffb. There's an interface on the user's detail page that allows you to set the user's role. I just re-installed from a fresh copy of 7.0.2 and this issue seems to be resolved. @benhaynes The application can't do anything here. The app can't read the the IP address of the user. . @shoaibjdev the activity log is generated by the API and has nothing to do with the app specifically, which is why it's able to show the IP address.\nI'm still pretty sure you can't read someone's IP address in the browsers client side JavaScript, please let me know if you have resources that prove other wise. \n@benhaynes the API can block incoming requests based on IP, which also means it can block the application from accessing the API (which is the feature we're looking for). What I'm referring to is the fact that we can't block things in the app itself based on IP, as we don't have access to it before someone logged in (at which point the api returns it). . It seems that the php user inside the docker's ubuntu doesn't have the right permissions to write the log files \ud83e\udd14 \nI don't know enough about Docker unfortunately to fix it.. @WoLfulus any thoughts?. Moved this to https://github.com/directus/api/issues/523, since it's an issue in the APIs docker setup specifically. Hey @dekyfin! Based on the screenshot, this is actually Directus 6 (which we are currently sunsetting for v7).\n\nI'm submitting a pull request\n\nThanks \ud83d\ude04 . Yeah sorry 'bout that. We just soft-launched v7, so we're about to move it to the master branch as combined build. We ran into some small but important issues we needed to get rid off before we would make it the master branch. Thanks @dekyfin \ud83d\ude04 . LGTM!. @benhaynes the directus/directus one is the API one yeah. We can still update it here though so it's not wrong till net release \ud83d\ude04. MAMP should work too! I know @benhaynes is using MAMP for local development. Have you run into any similar issues @benhaynes? . Can you copy what's displayed in the devtools @mattbisme? When that big red error shows up, it should log the reason why on the browsers JS console. Hmm, that's weird. The app shouldn't even try fetching data at that point. Can you try clearing all caches / try an incognito tab?. It's both good and bad news that you can't reproduce it @shealavington. I'm hoping it's an isolated issue caused by some very specific configuration in MAMP, but I'm afraid there might be a harder to catch :bug: in the app's login flow itself. @blackdoginet that looks like another issue: \nhttps://github.com/directus/api/issues/532\nAs far as I can tell, it's a different error stacktrace than the one @mattbisme provided \ud83d\ude42. > Console is also claiming 403 Forbidden\nI feel like this is because the user you're using doesn't have permissions in Directus (for some reason). > Problem is that the token returned and saved in local storage is incorrect.\nThis sounds like it could cause the problems described. A wrong token would make the app think that you're logged in, but would the make api return 403 permission denied. \nWhat happens if you hit the \"login to another instance\" link when you get the error screen @mattbisme? That will flush the localstorage so it should log in \"fresh\".\nThanks for the help debugging this @benlo123 \ud83d\ude04. @WellingGuzman :bell:. So basically, the app login is correct, the token should be correct but the token never reaches the API?. OH! Yeah I remember having run into some weird issues a long time ago when running MAMP in module mode (or the other one?). I think the default is the one that was causing trouble back then.. The app's version can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/directus/app/blob/790d221059ef9e84ca29b77e9e7fc6f98b73799b/package.json#L3\nDo you need to programmatically extract it from the combined build directus/directus? Right now package.json isn't distributed in the production builds, because it has no other use.. > How can anyone detects which version they are on? \nYou can hover the little \"Powered by Directs\" message on the login screen \ud83d\ude01 \n\n\nAlso if in case in future anyone wants to upgrade the existing 6.4.x installation how will one suppose to upgrade to latest version?\n\n6 to 7 is a complete rewrite and is a breaking change (hence the major version change). We haven't gotten around to creating a migration tool, but you should be able to copy paste your existing (non directus_*) tables from 6 into 7.. > I noticed that there is no any customs directory in the API.\nThis one @vzool? https://github.com/directus/directus/tree/master/public/extensions/custom \ud83d\ude42 . > How can I do this while every single part in different corner?\nI'm pretty sure all those files are in the same corner directus/api \ud83d\ude04 . > For instance, this place in API is out of sync for 6 months when compared to this one\nThe code should be the exact same, as the API is literally copied 1-to-1 to the directus/directus repo in a new commit \ud83e\udd14\n\nAnd this repository directus/directus is not for Read-Only as a mirror, it does accept PR all the time.\n\nFair! @benhaynes we should look into how to make the repo a read-only mirror\n\nWhich repository is the main one?\n\ndirectus/app for the app, directus/api for the API (and the extensions). Those two can be used individually. directus/directus is \"just\" a combined version of the build branches of the two main repos provided as a convenience.. wow wait, archiving is something else. >  because there's a full version commit on the full-suite\nWhich allows you to run git pull origin master to upgrade your Directus installation \ud83e\udd14 . I think the conclusion here is that we either look into how to make the repo \"properly\" read only and add a note to the readme for now?. > But we'd lose the zip/tar ability for shared servers...\nWe'd have a build branch on directus/directus which would still release to a zip.\n\nand our precious \u2b50\ufe0f count on directus/directus \ud83d\ude09\n\nThe interactive building script will still be hosted on that repo \ud83d\ude04 . > but try to keep everything up-to-date \ud83d\ude4f\ud83e\udd13\nHo! Build branches are up to date. Weekly release! \ud83d\ude04 . > directories for directus/directus after that commit has been changed dramatically\nYes, as we released the next major version of the platform, which is a breaking change (as indicated by the major version number increase). The directory structure has been the same ever since, and is not going to change in a breaking way until the next major version release (which as of right now is nowhere on the horizon).\n\nwithout any notice\n\nI don't really agree.. We've been Tweeting about it, writing Medium articles about it, done public releases ever since alpha 1, launched a release candidate on this repo, and announced it on Slack on multiple occasions. \n\nBut, now I'm facing many issues and this is one of them:\n\nThis is because you're trying to use Directus 7 with a Directus 6 installation. v7 is a complete rewrite of the platform and isn't compatible with the v6 internal database architecture. @vzool That looks very similar to https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/2224. I think whatever server you're using is not sending along the Authorization header to PHP. That explains why your user can login, but why every subsequent request is failing.\n@WellingGuzman Do you think it's an idea to by default use the access_token query param instead of the Authorization header? It seems like there's more and more people who have issues with the auth header.. I think option 1 is the best solution.\n2 can't be done, as there's no guarantee the admin is going to be at /admin seeing it can be a stand alone install as well . @benhaynes you made the change for all API instances though. For people who installed the API from the non-combined bundle (eg directus/api), this information will be wrong... > This Directus API instance has not been configured. Install via the Directus App (eg: /admin) or read more about configuration at: https://docs.directus.io/install.html#configure\nI'm just afraid that we'll see a \"/admin doesn't exist issue on the API repo\" soon.. But I guess there's no better solution at this point. . > I had to add a field to the table (useless in my case) so I can save the record. After saving, I can edit the record and use the translation field\nThis was because you need to have an ID of the current item in order to know what ID to save in the related translation. I figured out a way to defer saving the translations until the new item is done so that's been solved.\nRight now the translations interface is looking for the code (PK) and name fields. I'm adding options so you can provide a name for both of those.. > But, as you can see, there is a default option: --. How can we remove this default option? \nIt shouldn't be selectable. I changed the default -- to Choose Language... to provide some more context.\n\nWhen I set a default value for the translation field, it is not saved\n\nThat's because the translation field is technically not a field at all. It's an alias that's stored only in directus_fields, not as a real column in the database. The default value for fields is saved in MySQLs default_value for a column, which explains why default values are ignored. Now that I'm thinking about this, the default value input should be hidden for O2M / translation type fields (added a new issue: https://github.com/directus/app/issues/1124).\nI'll add another option for the default language!. I've added a couple options which should make the translations interface way more useful!\nI have two more questions for you @olinescu @sebj54:\n1) Right now, on the listing overviews, the interface displays 3 Items. I don't feel like that's the most useful thing to show. Do you guys have any idea on what could be a useful display there?\n2) This translations interface has a full relational setup. There's a total of 3 collections needed, which results in a lot of setup. Alternatively, we cloud add a translations interface that saves everything as JSON in a single column. This means that there's virtually no setup, but it also means that we lose search and filtering on the actual translations.. (no more lang=nl-NL) in the API.. Is this something you think is worth pursuing, or is this something you guys would never use?\nThanks in advance! \ud83d\ude04 . Point 2 has been coming up a lot lately. Setting up relationships currently is a tedious process, and can be greatly optimized by taking away the need to setup the junction tables manually. @benhaynes we should probably open a new issue for it to have a centralized place to discuss it.\nPoint 1 sounds good to me! We do need to figure out when a language is \"done\" (eg when it's going from 0/3 to 1/3). Is 1 character in any field enough? What's going to be the rule there?. > I'm not sure about extending this behavior to all M2M relations.\nNah I'm not too sure if it makes sense for M2M relations in general. \"This user favorited 15 out of 350.000 movies\"\n\nThis could also be a performance issue on large tables, am I right?\n\nThis is a very good point, right now the total count of relational items aren't fetched, so this might introduce quite the performance hit. Not too sure how to implement this without introducing some real nasty delays..\n\nMaybe it can be optional? Enabled by default on a translation relation?\n\nYes, we should definitely add this as an option.\n\nWhat about the possibility to display a label for each record? \n\nI really like this idea! We could use the same display template option as the M2M. However, what language should it use to render the value? The current user's language?. This is a duplicate of https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/2242\nEdit: ho wait this one was first, oh well they're both the same and both going to be fixed right now \ud83d\ude01. I'm pretty sure this is a duplicate of #2242. Please let me know if the new release (7.0.7) fixed it for you @Wulfheart. If not, we'll reinvestigate this :) . If I install the api clean from the master branch and install the composer dependencies fresh, it seems to work just fine. This indicates that either something got accidentally ignored in Git during the build process or I just downloaded a newer version of a broken package. Either way, I'll release a new version with this issue fixed shortly. We started adding the .gitignore file of the main master branch to the builds as well, in order to prevent the logs from being tracked. However, this would also ignore changes in /vendor. I didn't catch this before because it seemingly didn't touch /vendor, except of course when this one nested dependency updated and it didn't make it into build. . This has been fixed in api v2.0.7 https://github.com/directus/api/releases/tag/v2.0.7. Fixed in v7.0.7. Based on PHPs website, 5.x isn't officially supported anymore, and seeing that security patches aren't being made for 5, I don't think it's that unfair to drop official directus support for it as well. Thoughts @channel? \nhttp://php.net/supported-versions.php. I'm not entirely sure what you're looking to do, but all the docs we have can be found here: https://docs.directus.io.\nIf something in the docs is wrong or missing, you can update it / notify others here: https://github.com/directus/docs. Hey @khudia, can you share some more info on how to reproduce this? There must be something in your specific server setup that causes this issue, as I'm not able to reproduce it on my setup.. Hey @gbtux! This is not available in the Directus suite by default. There's no way to magically get the correct HTML and CSS of just the edit forms. That being said, you should be able to recreate the edit form in your own app reusing the Vue components that make up the edit form.\nAll interfaces are separate JS files that you can load into the client side to register them as vue components. Then you can use the information that's being returned in the /fields endpoint to render these custom (async) components using a <component> component. \nI created a loadExtension function that will asynchronously pull in the Vue component for the given URL which you can use in the Vue.component() method:\nhttps://github.com/directus/app/blob/14002ab33852589256d74607b436c83cc74ac358/src/helpers/load-extension.js#L6-L43\nVue.component usage:\nhttps://github.com/directus/app/blob/14002ab33852589256d74607b436c83cc74ac358/src/components/extension/interface/input/input.vue#L162-L166\nEach interface uses these props:\nhttps://github.com/directus/app/blob/14002ab33852589256d74607b436c83cc74ac358/src/components/extension/interface/input/input.vue#L2-L21\nTL;DR:\n\nFetch the fields and interfaces used from /fields/:collection\nFor each interface, register the interface as a Vue component using Vue.register()\nRender the edit form using a loop and <component :is=\"interfaceName\" />\nPost the form content to /items/:id (how you would regularly update an item). This is a duplicate of (your own!) issue \nhttps://github.com/directus/app/issues/1140. The problem I'm hearing is the fact that it's tedious to setup relationships. @benhaynes we've discussed automatically setting up relationships, and only providing the manual setup as an advanced feature. That would solve the same underlying problem right? \ud83d\ude04 . > Digital Ocean instance \n\nIs this on a LAMP stack? If so, can you confirm you have php_curl installed and mod_rewrite enabled?\n. Ah! \nOne of the features that we're focussing on next is a page in the installation flow that shows you if all the necessary requirements have been met. That should clear up a lot of confusion as well \ud83d\ude04 . > I still don't understand how to clone repos in one folder as soon as I need dasboard and API all together?\ngit clone https://github.com/directus/directus.git is enough\n\nIn most cases I need to write my own code(hooks, tests, extensions) and use version control. It means that I need to separate my code from Directus sources and sure, fork can handle that, but fork of what repo? It still requires from me to do git pull upsteam master and git rebase master over and over again.\n\nHow would you imagine this working otherwise?\n\nIt's bad that there is no option to install Directus as dependency\n\nWhy?\n\nit's possible with WP\n\nHow?\n\nyou can even find recommended .gitignore for WP projects.\n\nWhat does it ignore?\nYou propose changes to the project to change whatever you want to change, that's the beauty of open source \ud83d\ude04 Let everyone know how you would love to see all of this work and we can discuss and implement @ybelenko . Ahhh I see! That way, you can keep the platform up to date using that composer installer, and keep the custom parts in your own repo, without a full copy of the application. Nice!\nWe might be able to use the Wordpress installer package as a starting point for a composer directus installer. https://github.com/johnpbloch/wordpress-core-installer. As far as the .gitignore file goes, I don't think there's much more to it than\n*\n!public/extensions/custom\nto be honest, as there aren't any other folders that users would modify \ud83e\udd14 . Yeah I'm pretty sure we'll add it in. I'm not 100% sure if that will be next release right away, as I need to make sure it doesn't have any unwanted side effects. . > if you are concerned about \"composer scared people\" you can always build a binary zip filled with the whole\nThat's basically how we treated the master branch in this repo with the directus/api repo being the composer-installable flexible version.\nChanging the master branch to be two submodules and a composer.json file now would be a massive breaking change \ud83e\udd14 \nFor now, we'll add the composer.json file out of the API repo in the next build (on directus/directus).\n\ndon't be the wordpress guys\n\nHa, duly noted \ud83d\ude04 . We'll add this file to next the release so I'll close this now \ud83d\udc4d . > \u2026and a dev for contributions, CI Test, Composer based deploys or people who would like to have a strict composer deployment.\nThis is already possible by using the directus/api and directus/app repositories. Adding a new dev branch to the combined directus repo will only add to the confusion in my opinion. . @tvld We're moving away from the included Dockerfile to this stand alone repo https://github.com/directus/docker. It's still an early version, but there's a bigger community of docker devs working on it and available to answer questions \ud83d\ude04 . Thanks for the heads up! It's working again now.. @shealavington should we reset the demo more often? \ud83e\udd14\nMaybe hide the password field completely? . Like @benhaynes said,  ?fields=*,header_image=* is invalid. Try ?fields=*,header_image.* instead.. Sounds good to me!. There's two \"camps\" for the admin app. Some people would like to have a dropdown to select between projects when logging in, while others want to keep the projects truly standalone (eg don't have your clients see other clients names) \nWe could potentially return the project names publically in the / route of the api and use that in the admin app dropdown, but I'm not sure if that's a solution that would work for everyone . @wondergryphon Directus already has a setting where you can enter any API url to login to :). Some additional thoughts:\n\nA super admin is a user that is an admin in every project and can create / delete projects\nTo support super admin users, we should have a \"master\" database that holds these super users (and meta info on the projects?)\nAs an alternative to having the user paste the full API url, we could maybe configure an API base URL in the application so the user only has to type the project name itself\n^ That would break support for logging in to non-base-url APIs \ud83e\udd14 \nAlternatively, we could scope the project in the application URL, so instead of /#/login it could be /#/ranger/login. That way, the \"master\" login / switcher / project manager could live on /#/login. Hey @jesstucker! The application uses the API for everything under the hood: if something is possible in the app, it's possible in the API.\n\nThe way the application does it is by uploading the file to the /files endpoint using enctype multipart/form-data. If you've configured to use S3 in the config file, it will save the file to S3.\nSee https://docs.directus.io/extensions/storage-adapters.html#using-aws-s3 for more info on how to set that up.. > It seems that the image field currently only accepts a primary key integer\nThe field interface right now is a relational field to the directus_fields component. You would first save the file to /files and save the ID that is returned nested in the item in which you want to add the file.\n\nIt's theoretically possible to inline the file right there in the item itself, but that only works using a base64 data string of the file which is not very performant. I would highly recommend uploading the file separately using the /files endpoint first.. No worries \ud83d\ude42 . Could you try changing the database user to directus? The password for the directus user won't work with the root database user. . Is this what you're looking for?\n\nhttps://docs.directus.io/guides/thumbnailer.html. Hey @ambu50! Could you open this pr on the directus/api repo instead? This repo is nothing but a combined build of the directus/api and directus/app repos combined. CHAR (and VARCHAR) will be saved as string and can therefor accept any step. I've added CHAR to the check as well in commit d176fe3d26c78e8bbbbcd8cd764e36f8816c9849. allow_null wasn't checked in any way and I thought the check would be the same as the one for is_required, please let me know if I overlooked something. You're completely right. Pushed a fix just now \ud83d\udc4d . (It was a usage of Array.prototype.includes instead of the matching String version, but the browser support wasn't ideal nonetheless). Yes it can!. It's used now, but the implementation and functionality match that of the underscore one. Underscore isn't used in hardly any of the interfaces, so we could discuss keeping the interfaces underscore-free to keep it a little more modular and easier to move away from underscore and save 20kb?. Whatever you think is best. It doesn't really matter on the short term. That would result in something like Utils.debounce = _.debounce, which also seams like an abstraction which would do more harm than good. I'll replace it with the underscore one for now \ud83d\udc4d . Ah, you meant to be able to replace it at a later time. Yeah that's no problem ^^ (little brainfart here)\n. Could we change this to window.addEventListener('popstate' ... ) to prevent any overriding issues in the future?. @WellingGuzman We're allowing ES6 now?!!. I mean that as a good thing of course \ud83d\ude42 . @WellingGuzman By \"fully\" switching to ES6, we will lose support for IE (unless we throw a transpiler like Babel in the mix). That being said, I think allowing the use of ES6 can immensely clean up the codebase in some places. Shall we open this as a 'discussion' issue?. Yeah, the ID (primary key) can be any datatype. F.e. in a languages table, the ID can be the language code (en_us) instead of a number. @WellingGuzman Is this change useful..?\nIt saves 30 characters, but decreases the readability of the code tremendously...\n. Perfect @u12206050. Thanks!. @philleepflorence If you push to the same branch, it gets added to the PR :). js\nif (+model.get('data').id === +id) {\nYour logic sounds right! The ID comes from the DOM, making it a string. Casting it to a number should work for numeric based IDs. However...... string based IDs are a thing too!\nI think it's the safest option to cast both to a String instead of a number, seeing that would prevent NaN for string based values \ud83d\udc4d . ",

    "laszlokorte": "Yeah that's because \n$finfo = new \\finfo(FILEINFO_MIME);\n$finfo->buffer(...)\nguesses the mime type by looking at the buffer. If it does not start with the xml header it's not valid xml => not valid svg => finfo can not know that it's svg so it just says text/plain.\n. > it will never be perfect, though, as an example we have an svg and by it's content finfo doesn't know what it is.\nI think that is not the core problem here. SVG files should always have the correct header to be valid and thus would be detected by finfo correctly. (Having a fallback for invalid files to rely on the file extension is another nice thing but it's not what this issue is about)\nThe problem is that you only check for the media type of the mime type to be image before calling imagecreatefromstring but Php does only support JPEG, PNG, GIF, WBMP, and GD2d (http://php.net/manual/de/function.imagecreatefromstring.php) when there are >50 other file formats of type image/* (https://www.sitepoint.com/web-foundations/mime-types-complete-list/).\nI would suggest keeping a small list of imagecreatefromstring-supported mime types and check against them. Then it might be a good idea to not duplicate that mimetype check on the client side but just save a flag in the database to tell if a thumbnail is available and use this on the client side.\nFinally for SVG files the thumbnail should just be a copy of the original file. I guess that check would fit into Directus\\Files\\Thumbnail\n. I was wrong about SVG files having to start with <?xml (https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#sec-prolog-dtd). It's just a should.\nSo you are right: Additionally checking the file's extension is needed to achieve proper mimetype recognition. \n. Ok, that's what I thought. I just wanted to try working on a PR regarding the SVG upload and thought it would be best to base it on the development branch.\n. Ok, slightly off topic question: Do you have some kind of public roadmap? Currently the documentation seems to be incomplete and there seems to be some dead code in both the php code and the db schema. \nFor example this list of image formats in the AclAwareTableGateway:\nhttps://github.com/directus/directus/blob/master/api/core/Directus/Db/TableGateway/AclAwareTableGateway.php#L39 (https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/ea6e489eba18ad559dd07c00507e45f7d57ff925)\nOr the is_junction_table column in the directus_tables table seems to be unused?\nOr for commented code like this:\nhttps://github.com/directus/directus/blob/master/api/core/Directus/Files/Thumbnail.php#L32-L34\nthe purpose is not quite obvious (?)\nI am currently evaluating using Directus in a few of my projects. For doing so it would be great to get an idea in which direction the project is heading and what's the current state of development.\n. Thank you for your quick responses\n. I am not seeing it. It also not in the markup (devtools).\nI just noticed that I am not seeing a delete button in global list views of the tables either.\n. I just did a fresh install of the master branch. I am still not seeing a delete button in the OTM field table.\nIt's a completely fresh install and I created all my table just through the directus UI.\n\n. Now I tracked down the error: I set the foreign key column of the child table to NOT NULL.\nSo this check is returning false:\nhttps://github.com/directus/directus/blob/master/app/core-ui/one_to_many.js#L178\nBut I do not understand why that check is there in the first place. I would expect the child record to be just deleted and not to set it's parent_id column to NULL. If I wanted to use soft delete semantics I would have added an active column to the child table which I then would expect to be set to \"deleted\"\n. @benhaynes sounds good to me. \nBut: \n\nNULL ID (soft delete) \u2013 Goes back into the pool of choices\n\nAs far as I can see the OTM field does currently not provide a way to add some existing child record by assigning it's parent_id.\n. Better add it to FeadHub. I do not have that much time currently.\n. I just tried again with a fresh install from the master branch. Now I get the following behavior:\n1. edit a record that has a OTM field\n2. create a child record via OTM field\n3. click the \"Save\" button of the child to get back to the parent\nNow the child does not appear in the OTM table of the parent at all. (so it can not be clicked for editing again) But if the parent is saved the child is created.\n. Oh cool. I tried to checkout the development branch but the installation failed due to \"schema template '' does not exist\".\n. I just tested this in the dev branch.\nIt's working now for the simplest case of one OTM field.\nBut If I have the following:\nSessions -OTM-> Talks -OTM-> Speaker\nAnd I edit a session, then edit a talk through OTM field, then edit a speaker through OTM field, click save twice to get back to the session, then edit the talk again, the talk's speakers are refetched and the changes are lost.\n. @WellingGuzman schema-export.sql.zip\n(I have cleared the directus_users table)\n. Yeah I think I removed all sensitive information \ud83d\ude04 \n. Another cool feature would be allowing the Tag UI to be used with MTM relationships and\n. And using the Checkbox UI with the SET column type\nedit I think It's rather the \"Multi Select\" UI I am talking about.\n. And using the Radiobuttons UI for MTO relationships\n. yes\n. Thanks. Now that you have fixed #1186 I can see how the option works for the select ui.\nMaybe it would be more clear to rename the \"Allow Null\" UI option to \"Allow Empty\" or \"Include Empty Option\". Because \"allow null\" sounds like a technical database related term.\n. Right, the single quotes are of course wrong. Anyway the problem for me persists.\nThe problem seems to be that selectedValue here:\nhttps://github.com/directus/directus/blob/master/app/core-ui/select.js#L36\nnot the selected value but some other object:\n\nso this equality check:\nhttps://github.com/directus/directus/blob/master/app/core-ui/select.js#L47\nalways fails\nAdditionally I just noted that the selectbox always allows to select the null/empty option (even if allow_null is not set) because the option here:\nhttps://github.com/directus/directus/blob/master/app/core-ui/select.js#L56\nis read as either string '0' or string '1' which both evaluate to truthy in the the handlebar's {#if} statement.\nI just noticed that the value of the select ui field is also not displayed in the column of the list view.\n. should I try the dev or the master branch?\n. Its working now\n. This slightly relates to #1184.\nUnchecking \"Allow Null\" for the select ui settings should also alter the table's column and force the \"required\" checkbox to be checked.\n. @WellingGuzman I think I was actually talking about the \"required\" checkbox on the field in the field list of the table.\nBut it's actually working now anyway. Thanks.\n. I just tried it again on the master branch. Now I am not getting an error anymore but if I type the column names with spaces ultimatley the MTO field table is not correctly displayed (columns are missing). If I remove the spaces the table is display correctly.\nI assume the fix has only been applied to the validation but not to the place where the setting is used.\n. You can also see on the screenshot above that the text of the input field is misaligned.\nWhile typing into the input field the ajax request that's made to fetch the suggestions causes the whole page to turn dark for a moment because some overlay div is inserted. That's very confusing.\n. It just occurred to me that the length  option x for mysql integer INT(x), TINYINT(x) does not really effect the storage capacity but only the output padding if ZEROFILL is set for the column.\n(https://alexander.kirk.at/2007/08/24/what-does-size-in-intsize-of-mysql-mean/)\nSince ZEROFILL can not be set via directus UI I think the interface could be simplified by not providing the length option for INT/TINYINT/CHAR fields at all.\n. The \"Draft only\" status filter for tables when editing a permission group is confusing because the \"draft\" concept makes no sense for tables\n. UIs: which UIs would be bigger?\ndesign: If two neighboring UIs have different heights in kirby the smaller one just has spacing below it:\n\nI think that's fine.\nLabels: I agree, that's probably one of the strongest problems\nWidths: In kirby multiples of 1/2, 1/3, 1/4 or 1/5 are supported. In my opinion 1/2 and 1/3 would be enought.\nResponsiveness: kirby stacks the fields if the viewport get's to narrow.\n\nThe implementation is pretty straightforward: The field's container elements just get's a class like field-grid-item-1-3 assigned which sets it's width to 33% and css float is use to put all grid-items next to each other. If two items do not fit next to each other they will break. It just requires that the field itself adjusts to it's container size.\n. > Do you know why the related item is being saved in the DB before the parent is saved?\nFor me it sounds like a client side validation error of the invisible MTO field of the Hotel.\n. If have not tested it yet but did you consider that if NOT NULL is set in the DB the \"required\" checkbox is checked and disabled? In that case the checkbox should be mandatory right?\n. Well I just noticed that the footer option is added to all UIs. The NaN value seems to be because the visible column I have set for the typeahead is not numeric. It would be cool if that case could be caught but I guess it's not that dramatic.\nStill there is the the wrong behavior of the footer being displayed regardless if the \"footer\" checkbox is checked or not.\nThe reason is this check:\nhttps://github.com/directus/directus/blob/development/app/core/table/table.footerview.js#L64\nThere showFooter is a string '0' and not 0.\nIf I remember correctly such number<->string mismatch and the truthyness semantics of javascript values have been the reason of many of the issues I have reported until now.\nMay I suggest two ideas:\n1. introduce a type conversion layer that converts all stringy values received from the API into their correct types in a central place. How about adding a type property to the UIComponent's variables object:\nthis.variables.push({\n        id: 'footer',\n        type: 'boolean' // <---\n        ui: 'checkbox',\n        def: 0,\n        comment: __t('numeric_footer_comment')\n      });\nand then access the UI options values only through some interface that takes care of the type casting.\n1. Do not rely on implicit truthyness of javascript but use strict equals === everywhere and check and make boolean conditions explicit if(showFooter === true) instead of just if(showFooter)\n. > Still there is the the wrong behavior of the footer being displayed regardless if the \"footer\" checkbox is checked or not.\n\nThe reason is this check:\nhttps://github.com/directus/directus/blob/development/app/core/table/table.footerview.js#L64\n\nFor columns that are indeed numeric the problem that the footer is visible even if the checkbox is not checked still persists because '0' is saved to the DB and then by javascript evaluated to true (because non-empty string)\n\n@laszlokorte care to open a PR for that?\n\nI can see if I find time to do that in the next few days.\n. I am starting to work on the central typecasting.\n. works \ud83d\udc4d \n. Works for me \ud83d\udc4d \n. I just noticed that the API delivers some data as strings even though it's obviously typed as integers. For example the permission table columns (allow_*) and the messages (eg the read value).\nI think such values should be encoded as the correct datatype on the server. But I am really not comfortable with the Zend framework so I could need some help there. I saw that the AclAwareTableGateway has an parseRecordValuesByMysqlType method that takes care of it but the DirectusMessagesTableGateway does not make use of it.\n. @benhaynes the settings.get method that is used to access the options is overridden to use the default value if not other value is provided:\nhttps://github.com/directus/directus/blob/master/app/core/UIManager.js#L310-L324\n. I am currently looking for number values that are (imo falsely) provided as strings by the API.\nSo far:\n/api/1/tables/[table]/preferences:\n- id\n- user\n/api/1/messages/rows:\n- rows.from\n- rows.read\n- rows.recipients (imo should be array instead of csv string)\n/api/1/tables/[table]:\n- count\n/api/1/groups/[id]:\n- id\n- restrict_to_ip_whitelist\n- show_activity \n- show_messages\n- show_users\n- show_files\n/api/1/privileges/[id]:\n- id\n- group_id\n- nav_listed\n- status_id\n- allow_view\n- allow_edit\n-  allow_delte\n- allow_alter\n/api/1/privileges/[group-id]/[table-name]:\n- id\n- group_id\n- nav_listed\n- status_id\n- allow_view\n- allow_add\n- allow_edit\n- allow_delete\n- allow_alter\nThese need to be fixed for the strict equality checks to work. I think converting those values on the client side is not a good solution. The server should already provide them in the right way.\n. I currently do not have time to work on the server side part of this.\nBut as soon as the API returns correctly typed values (especially for messages read count and privileges) this could be merged.\n. I just force pushed your squashed commit to my strict-types branch in order to mark this PR as merged.\n. For me it looks like this:\n\n. doesn't matter\nhad contributed \ud83d\ude04 \n. I am not sure if it's related to my changes but I just noticed two issues:\n1. The privileges settings (/settings/permissions/1) do not show the correct privileges \n2. In the table settings the \"Required\" checkbox for columns that are NOT NULL in the DB is no longer force checked/disabled (UI: TextField, VARCHAR). Not sure if this is the supposed behavior. \n. Currently I am on the dev branch. Should I switch to master to get the latest fixes?\n. @WellingGuzman for Textarea/TEXT the required checkbox is force checked if the column is NOT NULL in the database. And for some other UI/Datatypes as well. For me that looks inconsistent and should be unified.\n. Did you try setting RewriteBase / in your .htaccess?\n. In the /api/.htaccess as well? (maybe there you need to set RewriteBase /api)\n. I think RewriteBase is not required in all cases and might not work in every case. It depends on how the webserver's DocumentRoot is configured.\nFor example if you install directus into a sub directory RewriteBase might cause an error.\n. The problem is caused by your VirtualDocumentRoot configuration. When using virtual document roots, apache can not determine the rewrite base path on it's own.\nIt looks like the following page provides some kind of work around that works in both cases (using VirtualDocumentRoot and not using it):\nhttp://blog.lavoie.sl/2012/07/document-root-fix-in-htaccess-when.html\nBut I have never seen this used in production yet.\nOther open source cms I have worked with usually just wrote something like this in in .htaccess file:\n```\nUncomment this if you are getting routing errors:\nRewriteBase /\n```\n. What to you think about markdown support? Ie converting the content to markdown before saving it to the database.\nOr something like:\nhttps://simplemde.com/\n. ",

This seems to explain why my server threw a 403 error also when trying to make calls via the  PATCH method of HTTP. FWIW, it's worth noting that PATCH may not be supported by all firewalls (or things like mod_security if using Apache). You may be able to overwrite this in .htaccess, otherwise you may need to configure your rules manually. I confirm this works on Safari, so could well be a browser bug, sorry. ps, am I the only one? Seems hard to believe... Or do people just not use the GUI?. Running into the same bug on PHP 7.2 FTW ;). It's also affecting the PHP SDK. Yes, 6.4.9 (corrected now, sorry). \nThe situation is this: I have an admin id (user ID 1) which can log in and display the gui fine. Another admin (user ID 1699) can log but the error previous described then occurs (gui doesn't display). If, however, I delete 700+ users in the middle of this range, this error then goes away. I tested how many users we could have before the bug manifests itself - this threshold seems to be 1000, hence my theory of this being a limit somewhere.\nI didn't quite understand your comments but please let me know what else I can do to debug. \nAlso, just to be clear error is pasted from a 6.4.5 dev (I think) as it's not the directus.min build, so I assume it gives more info.

However there is something to talk about before I begin xD, do you prefer formal or personal pronunciation? (Wiki\n\"Du oder Sie?\"\nIt will take some time anyway - I will work on it while setting up a new backend ;)\n. @benhaynes I am working on it, but as it isn't my primary task I will need some time - also I had a large project the last few days, therefore I neeed to move this tasks priority a little bit down, but it looks like a can work more on it in the next weeks ;)\n.

So I wanted to give you a quick update about the translation into german. Please have a look at the following pull request: #1223 \nWhile working on it, i saw some special cases which probably need your attention:\n- \"Activity\": Is this word used for singular or plural cases? In german often times we speak about \"Aktivit\u00e4ten\" which is plural - while in english it is used as \"Activity\" and not \"Activities\"\n- \"Visit project\": I know its the same in the english file but is it really obvious for the user what is meant by this? Wouldn't it be better to say something like: \"Visit project homepage\" or \"Visit project website\" or so?\n- \"Directus User Guide\": We often keep the original label for such things, because it will be easier found with google (especially when the User Guide is not translated into german) - Do you want that this is translated?\n- \"Personalize this instance of Directus to fit your organization\u2019s needs\": \n  - I don't know but this item sounds somehow not perfect in my ears: everywhere is the focus layed towards the word \"Project\" so it sounds pretty wrong that in this case the word \"organization\" is used\n  - The 1 to 1 german translation from \"Directus instance\" to \"Directus Instanz\" isn't really used to often and sounds very technical - therefore I used \"Directus Installation\", its a pattern which is used quite often, but also keeps its technical background :)\n. Just a little update from my part: i live and didnt forget about the german translation task xD\n. Hey @pmichaelis :D, that would be really cool! From my part the translation in the development branch is sadly my latest version. So you could go from there! @Benhaynes do you have a Discord or Slack group so we could arrange us a little better? (Without always posting into this issue and notify everyone :))\n@pmichaelis: @RabbitMC is maybe also working on it!\nBut @RabbitMC how is it going on your side? :D\n.

Allow the user to modify those fields (filled by reverse-geocoding) without any further geocoding on those. This is to fix reverse-geocoding errors which will show up very often, especially for addresses of the eastern hemisphere. \n\nThis is what I found working best for saving addresses; even those not found by geolocation APIs...and here's a simple wireframe of the UX I'm talking about:\n\nI hope this will help \ud83d\ude0a ..

Password disappearing and not updating at random. Failing to login under Chrome, Safari etc etc.\n. Snap. Keep having issues with updating passwords generally. I get redirected at login with login.php?redirect=users with no feedback. Passwords don't get updated when I click save, sometimes you go into a user profile and the password field is just empty and so you can't update the profile without putting in their password (I'm guessing as admin this is not right) and the whole confusing process starts again.. Hey,\nI first had issues when trying to use the password to authenticate and\nretrieve a token on the API, this kept failing. So i tried resetting the\npassword, it appears to auto-update after you type it in, but does it save?\n(I think it should only save the password when you click 'SAVE\") either way\nI could never get my user/pass or token to work through the API. So I\ncreated a new account where I have not attempted to change the password or\ntoken and this worked in the API, my current profile still will not. I then\ncreated another user yesterday and got nothing but red exception errors\nabout the password now I cannot change or save any password on the account\nit is just broke.

Ok so that does not install it when running composer?. And how do I install that?\n. Woohoo I managed to install mcrypt and its working now!, Thanks for the help guys!!!. Yeah just to add that step, that was my only hiccup but now its running smoothly. Sure!\nThese steps are based on MAMP installed on OS X El Capitan\nBelow are the steps that I followed to get the issue sorted:\nFirst check your PHP version:\nphp -v\nPHP 5.5.28 (cli) (built: Apr 10 2014 17:49:22)\nCopyright (c) 1997-2014 The PHP Group\nZend Engine v2.5.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2014 Zend Technologies \nSecondly open up your nano .profile in terminal:\nnano .bash_profile\nThen simply point to your MAMP PHP instance:\nexport PATH=\"/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php5.5.38/bin:$PATH\"\nSave it and that's it. Problem solved!. ",

I'll try this, thank you @WellingGuzman . @benhaynes sometimes I'm receiving server errors (e.g. when doing bulk operations). However I don't see any logs written in the api/logs folder (although it's writeable). Do you have any idea?. Nevermind, I've recreated the directory, and it seems to work now.. Well that's not so intuitive for basic users (the WYSIWYG principle). I understand it's difficult as you also provide filter and sorting.. Well from a developer point of view that's indeed intuitive (and logical), however for a user/client this can be cumbersome. Drag and drop functionality, to change the order, would be an intuitive solution for them. As you don't need to learn them to check and edit an integer to simulate the ordening.. Wow, sorry my bad I've didn't read the comment properly. It seems to work! Great job.. @benhaynes when I try to sort, I get following exception.

    "lastlink": "I'm  also getting this error. When I create a new user w/ an invalid email or an email already in use then I get a 404 or 403 error as well as a cors error. My front end is unable to read the response status b/c it's a cors error. It's hard to do validation & show different messages if it's a cors error.. Any updates on this? It would be very useful for normal users to use the api as well.. I got this to work only after logging in as admin and generating an api token for the user then saving. Is there a way to have this token auto generate or do admins always have to go in and generate them for them? @WellingGuzman mentioned some 6.3 patch?. I just barely cloned the latest and launched it. I tried to create a many to many and it had the same yellow triangle and was unable to delete it. Well I managed to save this column w/out a name & had to access the database directly to give the column a name. Then I was able to make some changes.. This would totally open up using directus for mobile apps. This seems mostly business focused now, but we need the ability to register users for customer facing apps.\nI have been able to accomplish adding users (which should be registering) w/ a new public user group and a single user with only create users permissions. I was unable to assign a group to these new users & it's rather inconvenient that only admin's can generate user api keys for other users see #1543 . I may write an extension until directus has official support for registering users and generating api tokens for standard users.. @BennerGe why would I need user/row? I'm not trying to list (GET) the users's, but create a new user using (POST). And that url endpoint does work w/ a user api token or authorization bearer.. the user does get successfully created using that rest call, I need to experiment more w/ the groupid which does not get set, but is instead null.. I know I'm  figuring that out, but being able to set it is rather danger on creation b/c you could give  new user's admin abilities.. @rijkvanzanten should this become a feature label instead of question?. is this part of the core? how do you set filters?. ok maybe that would be easier than an extension, creating a new user create, add to default group & auto generate token. I may document my steps when I get a chance to work on it.\nI'll look into using @BennerGe solution.\nHowever, @BennerGe shouldn't you select the user by id & not firstname?. As a note for this I added a pull 36 request linking to this issue. I didn't give the full notes on setup as they are somewhat clear here. I also was having difficulty seeing the guidelines for our doc/api documentation since the summary.md has been so radically changed from 6.3.5 to 6.4.0.\nAnd to reiterate I was able to use\n```\nPOST https://url/api/1.1/users HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/json\n{\n\"email\":\"me@me.com\",\n\"first_name\": \"test\",\n\"last_name\": \"User\",\n\"password\": \"123456\"\n}\n```\nWithout needing rows or directus_users.\nI also used this as my filter\n'filters' => [\n        'table.insert.directus_users:before' => function ($payload) {\n            $payload->set('group', 3); // normal user groupid\n            $payload->set('status', 1); // active\n            $payload->set('token', \\Directus\\Util\\StringUtils::randomString(32));\n            return $payload;\n        },\n    ],\nThis is somewhat secure b/c any user's created (not updated) from the rest api even if from admin will be overwritten with said groupid not allowing users to set create new users in the admin group.\nI also had to create a publicuser, new publicuser group with permissions to add to directus_user table & not blacklist on writting to groups & tokens & use their api token for public registry.\n\n.

Thanks, I hadn't seen #1419 & had initially written this to work on our own system with minimal changes to the core directus code (i.e. its a feature I needed yesterday for a new customer site we're building).\nMy idea's a simple way to let users join extra tables that they can query on, without needing extra \"magic\" such as auto-joining tables based on dot-notation on the filters array, plus it allows the join type to change. Though I've used INNER in the examples, we can use LEFT/RIGHT as appropriate, allowing for flexibility in use.\nIn the example above, the columns used are defined as directus relationships (and we'd only be querying directus tables anyway) so I wouldn't have a problem with cutting the join part out & simply using dot-notation in filters (other than understanding Directus code enough to write it anyway).. http://feathub.com/directus/directus/+105\nallow a table to be listed multiple times in 1 join.

Does your user have read access? From what I see, your user is being denied access to read the tables. \nWhen you say you've tried v7, is that master or 7.0.1/2/3/4?

If you see a username in the bottom left that looks like the following then it shouldnt be a database user error. \n\nAs for troubleshooting the issue you're having, if you open the database, goto the table directus_user_roles and ensure you have an entry of ID:1, user:1, role:1, and go to the directus_users table and also ensure your user is there, that will determine if the user has admin privilege, other than that, I'm unsure.\n. Hmm, I'm not sure then, the URL is sitting at /Collections, so it seems authenticated. But I'm not too sure, sorry I can't be much more help. \nIf you wanted, if you export your database, and zip your files, I can try load them up see if I can get the same issue?\n\nI also wonder if it's because Directus is dependant on a PHP module that you might not have? For example curl, but I'm not sure what that may be if it was that.. No worries, If you'd like to provide that(provided it's not a personal password), then sure, if not, I'll probably throw my keys and hashed password in there. \ud83d\udc4d.

I've never used MAMP, so I can't answer that, but I've tried it on Docker and i've now put it on my server and it seems to work fine there too, and that's a default PHP 7.1 and mysql environment.. It's odd, as there's someone called KP in the slack with a fairly identical issue, my best guess is that there's something about the environment, as I've taken a copy and ran it on docker fine, and uploaded it to a typical web-server and it's worked fine every time.

Pretty sure it's /directus/src/core/Directus/Application/Http/Middleware/AuthenticationMiddleware.php\n105-147 getAuthToken( x )..

It did fix the issue for me, but I'm not sure on the security of it, haven't tested it on other servers etc.. > ,I still feel this is a bit hacky, because it doesn't reveal or fix the actual problem\nI felt exactly the same haha, it doesn't explain what was wrong or how to actually fix it, but is a workaround that works.\n\nWhat was your setup here? If the HTTP_AUTHORZATION exists it should have been renamed to Authorization by the .htaccess\n\nThat's what I thought too, all I did was a fresh-install on a shared-server, run a print_r($_SERVER) in web.php, tried to authenticate, and saw Authorization wasn't coming through, although the correct token was being created on the front-end.\nI came across some resources that lead me to what I tried in the end \u2014 as for why it's not doing what is expected, I'm not sure.\nPerhaps we could just introduce a new error that's a little more explanatory for users that may encounter this in the future, that it may not be working due to CGI API. (Not the best solution by any-means, but it's better than people complaining it's a bug with Directus) } elseif (substr(php_sapi_name(), 0, 3) == 'cgi') { throw new Exception(\"Authentication is failing, please switch to module\") } \ud83e\udd14 . If you're looking for the product that's \"ready to go\", you're looking for the directus repository, clone and it's ready to go. If you're looking to have multiple tenants running multiple API's, but you'd like them all to be accessed through a single APP, then you can put the APP in one location and API's in multiple locations, but access the API endpoints all through your one APP.\nIf you're looking to make any PR's, you'll want to make them respectively; in the APP repository if you'd like to modify the frontend, or the API repository if you'd like to modify the API. \nTo modify the frontend, I highly recommend importing the 'app' through the \"vue ui\", which gives you access to hot-reloading of the frontend, and if you'd like to modify the API, docker is a quick way to load up the API in a container.\nHopefully this clears up some confusion? Also, for questions like this, it's probably best if you join the slack rather than opening an issue: https://slack.getdirectus.com \ud83d\ude04 . @vzool I expect they look \"inconsistent\" because there's a full version commit on the full-suite, pretty much weekly (Why is why it says 7 days ago). Although the files are, from what I just looked at, the same.. Yesterday, Github put a new \"Issue Move\" beta tool into operation, so issues in the full-build repo shouldn't be an issue.. IMO: I think an installer creates unneeded complexity. I've not had issues just downloading the repo I needed. I mean, it's not a bad idea, but I'd still expect repositories for the API and app and it would just make for more work to maintain another repo. \ud83e\udd14. Please try to append /admin after public and let me know if that works @erkand-imeri. If you do a php info, what's the Server API? If it's CGI, that might be your issue. https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/2224. > Legacy Upgrades\n\nDirectus 7 is a major release with significant breaking changes from previous versions. Therefore there is no automated way to migrate your settings and configuration from v6 to v7. However, because Directus stores your content as pure SQL, that data is always portable between versions._\n\nhttps://docs.directus.io/install.html#installing-the-directus-suite. Here you go @atonse, simply typing \"Legacy Upgrades\" into the docs search bar would've provided the result you're after. \ud83d\udcaf \nhttps://docs.directus.io/advanced/legacy-upgrades.html. ~~This may be related to issue #2224. Where the authentication is having issues.~~\n@alrick could you check to ensure tables have all been created, if so, this is likely the case.. Oh, yeah, that's useful info lol\nIf you want, you can try to manually install, head into the ./config/ and copy api_sample.php as api.php then manually add the config. If it still doesn't work, your info is probably incorrect.. ~~You can import the following schema: https://github.com/directus/directus/blob/master/src/schema.sql~~\nProbably best to follow this guide: https://docs.directus.io/api/admin/configure-manually.html. > (https://myserver.com/directus/server/ping).\nIs that the correct ping url? typically I believe it's ./install_location/public/server/ping . @verbman as far as I'm aware, vendor files don't need to be committed, if it's causing you an issue, have you tried composer install? These also sound like two very different issues to me. Perhaps the error is elsewhere but it's only being caught there, probably best to open a new ticket with steps for someone else to repoduce.. That confuses me as I would expect to see the directory /public/ there too. It would make sense if you had a subdomain directus.myserver.com/admin pointing to the path, but typically it's myserver.com/directusinstall/public/admin youre not only keeping the public folder and putting that in your install are you, you're keeping the whole folder right? \n(I'm not being patronising I'm just trying to see if you might have missed anything). I see, it wasn't clear you had setup that alias, have you tried it without the alias?. > 3. I read that maybe the custom setup would work. Long story short: It doesn't.\nKinda need the long-story, so we know what you've tried and what you haven't, what you've written is rather vague.\n\nFurthermore the link is: https://directus.domain.com/admin/#/login according to the docs the # should be an _.\n\nYou're confusing the APP with the API there, as you're on the /admin, you're in the GUI interface and the # is Vue's way of dealing with URLs, the underscore is used for the API and reaching endpoints. . Fill in the database in ./config/api.php then import the sql to your database from ./src/schema.sql to manually install.\nYou're landing on the right page it should redirect where it did but it should show an install button, I had that same issue on my server, but did a manual install and it worked \ud83d\udc4d\n. Don't think so seb, he didn't mention errors. He just didn't get an install button and during manual install he didn't say he imported the sql.. That's the correct behaviour, you should land on the login page. Upon going to /admin you should be 'redirected' to /admin/#/login, this is because VUE takes over the handling of URLs.\n\nI also tried filling database details in config/api.php and visiting /public/admin for installer.\n\nHere lies the issue, if you manually configure the api.php, you also need to manually import the sql.. > he can't (and anyone can't I guess) access the installer.\nThat makes sense, however saying \"it redirects me to the login\" doesn't, as the installer is on the login page, therefore it would be correct to be on the login page. I'm with you now. . Glad it worked, and yes, I agree, it should work with the installer, and there must be a bug in the latest release, which I know is being looked into with that vendor issue \ud83d\udc4d\n\nIt should redirect to /public/admin when I visit /public\n\nThat's not the case, upon visiting /public you're at the API, but when you visit /public/admin you're loading the GUI. \n-\nSometimes it's hard to know where someone went wrong with an install, because they explain what they expect to happen, which sounds like the problem, because it isn't what should happen.\nIt's like, the installer is on the login page replaces the form with an install button, so by saying \"it redirects me to the login\" to you might seem unnatural, but is the default behaviour which is why I got confused. (Perhaps the url SHOULD change to install instead of login though?) \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc4d. Have you tried with Directus 7.0.7? This is the version with the latest patch.\nhttps://github.com/directus/directus/releases \n\n\nPost filling database details, when I click on \"Save\" to complete the installation, the credentials are stored in api.php but it does not populate database.\n\nJust to confirm too, as this is vague, you are on about the installer right? You're not just entering them manually into the api.php are you? if you are, you need to import the sql.. To answer your question, yes, you can use Directus with existing data.\nBut to answer the \"trouble processing request\" or \"the way around this\", I don't think there's enough information to know what's going wrong with your setup, did the install work, are you getting any browser console errors, anything logged that will help, what did you do step-by-step, what's the version of Directus, mysql etc? That way, hopefully someone else can try to replicate the issue or point out what's wrong.. password. Have you been through the requirements and ensured you have all the required extensions? \nhttps://docs.directus.io/advanced/requirements.html. Everything you see is related to the API except the APP, this is inserted into /public/admin. \nI don't understand where you're stuck, your install seems to mimic the repository fine, not sure what you mean about an API directory, that will just be wherever you've decided to install Directus.\nHave you followed the manual configuration process? If not, what are you stuck on\nhttps://docs.directus.io/advanced/api/configuration.html#project-config-files\nEdit\n\nOf course this directory does not exist.\n\nWell, that's an endpoint not a physical directory, so it won't exist.\n. The suite is basically just the API, but with the APP stuck under the public/admin folder.\nI reckon it's a PEBKAC issue here, not a Directus issue, if you can explain your steps to setup and then what went wrong, I might be able to help. But by just saying I installed and it didn't work, doesn't give me information as to what might be wrong with your setup.\nHave you tried a manual install?. Okay, as you don't see an installer. Please try to proceed with a manual install.\nhttps://docs.directus.io/advanced/api/configuration.html#configure-manually . > Manually configured the app.\nCould you expand on this, what have you configured, have you also configured the API, (setup an api.php file)? (Just want to be sure). I can't remember if the time is local to the application or the user, however there's two places the timezone can be edited. \n1) If you edit the user in directus you can change the users local timezone \n2) under the API.php file in the config directory, you should be able to specify the application timezone \n\ud83d\udc4c. As you cloned the API, you would need to install manually, you won't see a GUI installer, that comes with the Suite.\nLooks like it couldn't find the config file (when you cloned /API and used docker). Did you create the config, and import the databse schema? \nhttps://docs.directus.io/advanced/api/standalone.html#configuration\nI believe some of your other attempts have failed due to file/folder permissions. As it's failing to search for the API config therefore doesn't show an installer (on the Suite) as it thinks it's already installed, and it's failing with the red text because you don't have a database setup.\nOn another note, if you can provide versions for your PHP & MySQL, that might help if the above doesn't.. > Thank you for the quick response :)\nYou're welcome, I want to help but your attitude says that you don't want any, you just want to blame the software.\n\nI had three attempts, including the Suite, where I never saw installer as well.\n\nUnder your expected outcome you wrote \"Expect to see an installer\" all I was stating, is that you will only see the installer if you install the suite(If you don't see it on the suite, there's an error), if you install the API, you will need to do a manual install. I then proceeded to ask if you had done a manual install, which clearly you haven't.\n\nAs you read, I am running Directus Docker... which comes with PHP and MySQL obviously.\n\nAs far as I'm aware, they still have versions, which would be nice to know what they are, as Directus doesn't work on PHP 5.6 or below, which may be why it's failing.\n\nWhen I just copy /config/api-sample.php to /config/api.php The suite fails completely. Clearly api-sample.php has mistakes in it?\n\nThen you're doing something wrong, I have multiple API's running and I've never had an issue, any mistake is with you, or your setup, not the software.\n\nReally? Containers have been invented to exactly mimic our dev stations (5) test suites (2) and production (3) servers. Additional commands jeopardize our production flow... For the sake of it, how can I import database schema? I could not find link to the documentation\n\nYou need to head to your database and import https://github.com/directus/directus/blob/master/src/schema.sql. . I see, so the \"latest php version\" and \"mysql:5.7\" would've been fine to say, I never know, you might have changed the config, people do that then wonder why. \ud83d\ude0b \n\n\"Clearly\" api-sample.php has mistakes in it?\n\nI find it quite disrespectful to the creators that you took to blaming the software without considering that you might be doing something wrong.\n\nThe best advice I can offer is to follow the manual install process to get your database working so you can link your API to it. \nAnd make sure you've followed the directions carefully.\nhttps://docs.directus.io/advanced/app/standalone.html#installation as usually, these issues are due to someone skipping one small step without realizing. \nSorry I can't be much more help.. Yep, I was trying to login too, someone changed the password, however the demo gets reset every hour, so it's up and running again now I believe.. I mean, theres potentially a few solutions:\n- Lock down the edit fields. This would instead give an error like \"This is a demo, you can't change that information here\"\n- Have a 'before hook' that intercepts a password or email change, and just sets it back to default, completely ignoring user entry for those fields.\n- Remove password field on login screen for demo\n- Reset more often\n- Add more demo accounts, admin1, admin2\n- Add a flag in the API config for putting the API into demo mode this could disable all input fields?\nI think if we can have hooks reset the admin account data back to default on change... that might be the tidiest way of handling it, then we're not removing or changing functionality.. Vendors are stored so that the entire repository can essentially be a plug-and-play system.. Hopefully this helps https://docs.directus.io/guides/upgrading.html. In response to the last post by James: Perhaps what I'm about to say was the intended use of that area anyway, however it could potentially make a GET request to the GitHub API to fetch a list of releases to see if the version being used is out of date, then proceed to inform the user there's an updated version, and list all changes since the release the current version is running. (I would see a change-log for 7.0.12, 7.0.13, 7.0.14... etc.)\nEndpoint: https://api.github.com/repos/directus/directus/releases . I'm not quite sure what your issue here? The title of this issue seems subjective \u2014 is your issue just that you're getting some resource 404s in the browser console, or is it that you just don't understand how Directus/Directus \nis synchronized with the other repos?\nIf your issue is difficulty creating an extension, then the best thing for you to do here, is to explain exactly what you did so someone can see, rather than saying \"I followed the docs\", as commonly, it ends up as one small missed instruction that ends up as an \"oh my bad\".\n~IMO: It seems rather quick to blame the software for being out of sync and not up to date, as far as I'm aware, the Directus/Directus repo is up to date \u2014 remember to look at versions and not the master.~\nIssue is better explained below :).

    "tmikaeld": "Hello Ben,\nIt's ok if files and code take time.\nLike with all OSS software we work with, we donate a lot and report a lot of issues and request features every day, that is what we hope to do with Directus as well. I hope you understand the issue with branding.\nMidsized E-Commerce companies that we work with usually have employees that knows how to code basic stuff and check the source of a site. When they see the Directus branding, they will check up on it and they will determine that it's open source and that they can run it themselves or turn to you for setting up their custom solution (Since you are more qualified). Thus they don't need us as a third party and that can cost us a lot of money in lost prospecting effort and loosing a potential client.\nOf course, the argument is that we develop our unique solutions that Directus connects towards, but the client might see that differently. Especially if we are not upfront about using Directus from the beginning, in that case there's no reason to even use branding.. @benhaynes Thanks for the clarification, I understand that white-label is quite different and usually companies offer sub-licensing for such things and charge a fee to use it. But that is not allowed in this case due to GNU 3 licensing.. ",
    "the0neyouseek": "Thanks for the quick reply @benhaynes !\nI'll get to it and make a PR as soon as I can then \ud83d\udc4d . Here's what I've got so far : \n|  |  | \n|---|---|\n| Simple | With search and a placeholder (Allow Null) |\nIf the UI is good for you I will also do the multiple select before commiting the changes and making the PR.. Thanks for the response ! So, before going through with this I have some quick questions guys  \ud83d\ude04  \n\nWhich default do you want for the select search feature ? enabled or not ?\nWhich branch to you want me to commit to ? version/6.4 / development ?\nDo you want me to make a new interface, let's say select2 (since it's the name of the lib used), or replace the select, many_to_one, multi_select and enum ones to use this new UI ?\n\nAlso, just to let you know, doing a quick search with Atom I noticed you have a lot of \"loose\" select in the code not using the interface (at least 40 \u2260 <select returned across the whole project and excluding the ones in jquery and core/interfaces). For now, those will not be affected by the PR I'll make.. Hi @benhaynes, \n\nI've got the Auto/On/Off options done (I've also put the option to change the threshold for the Auto mode \u2014 default to 10).\nI've made the changes to 6.4, 1/2 weeks is great \ud83d\ude04 \nselect \nOn mobile, with the simple dropdown you get the same thing as above. With search active, the searchbar gets focus and opens the keyboard panel (default html behavior). \nLoosing the mobile system ui is a  cons  to using this and the only pros I see is the ability to search for long list of items (not available in the default system ui on iOS/Android). This is not such an important feature on mobile (than desktop) because you can scroll the list of items pretty quickly swipe your finger across the screen.\nI think making a conditional for mobile is a good idea, I'll get to it quickly. This way all the default select using the interface will benefit from this change without needing modification.\nselect2 can handle both, you can see a demo of what it can do here but merging many_to_one is, as you said, worth another discussion, I'll leave that for another time (and another PR) then \ud83d\ude04 \nMulti-select would look more like the tags interface using select2:\n \nFor now i'll keep to just changing the select & enum interfaces to this new UI, keeping the issue/PR light. The multi-select/m2o can be done later if needed \ud83d\ude09 \n. Do you want me to keep this issue open and switch topic to multi-select \ud83d\ude04 or can I close this ?. Hi @benhaynes ,\nI'll probably work on this next week-end \ud83d\udc4d Keep up the great work guys !\n\n\n\n(PS. Totally unrelated, but you should try to post your work on HackerNews/ProductHunt and the likes\u2026, probably when 6.4 comes out, the project could gain some attention, and contributors \ud83d\ude09 , from this ). (About that... Full disclosure, it was me :P , I couldn't find you anywhere on websites I go to regularly that I thought would enjoy this projet as much as I, so I posted about you - Link here - Figured later I should probably have waited for 6.4 to come out first, that's why I brought it up now, hope you don't mind..). Hi @benhaynes , sry I didn't have time to work on this last week-end. I'll get it done tomorrow (hopefully \ud83d\ude09 ).\nI think I figured out why the bug is happening and it seems to be because select2 doesn't like to be positioned in absolute element (why\u2026, that I don't know). In this case, this bit of .scss here :\nscss\n.page {\n    @include transition (all, $timing-short, ease-in-out);\n    position: absolute;\n    top: 64px;\n    left: 200px;\n    bottom: 0;\n    right: 0;\n    overflow: scroll;\n    background-color: lighten($gray-1, 3%); // #f5f5f5 // Global!\n    z-index: 8;\nfound in _page.scss is what causes the issue. \nI'll try to fix this tomorrow too. Yeah, so sorry Ben ! \ud83d\ude4f \nI've been working a lot this past few weeks and didn't have time to give it a look\u2026\nI'll make a pull request Saturday \ud83d\ude09 . ",

It's a case-sensitivity issue.\nThe front-end requests: /app/core/modal.js?bust={cache_busting_random_uuid}\nThe actual file on the server is: /app/core/Modal.js\nAdding ~* to the config didn't fix it because it's caught with the main location block (location / { try_files ... }).  For now I'm going to just find -exec it to lower case, but should have a more permanent fix to this.. I'm seeing the same issue.  Fresh install is throwing the following exception when loading /installation/index.php:  \nUncaught Exception: Directus\\Bootstrap#appdepends on undefined constant DIRECTUS_ENV in /usr/home/cms/app/api/core/Directus/Bootstrap.php:132 Stack trace: #0 /usr/home/cms/app/api/core/Directus/Bootstrap.php(147): Directus\\Bootstrap::requireConstants(Array, 'app') #1 [internal function]: Directus\\Bootstrap::app(NULL) #2 /usr/home/cms/app/api/core/Directus/Bootstrap.php(84): call_user_func('Directus\\\\Bootst...', NULL) #3 /usr/home/cms/app/api/core/Directus/Exception/ExceptionHandler.php(74): Directus\\Bootstrap::get('app') #4 [internal function]: Directus\\Exception\\ExceptionHandler->handleException(Object(Error)) #5 {main} thrown \n\nFreeBSD 11.1-RELEASE-p4\nPHP 7.1.13\nnginx 1.13.8\nMariaDB 10.2.11.

If possible, I'd suggest listing ALL required extensions in one place to make it easier.  \n\nThanks for the project, I like it so far! :). ",
    "imknight": "Hi, @tonimain and @xorander00 can you 2 share the valet driver for directus ? really appreciate it.. did you use Laravel valet to run Directus ? if yes can you share valet driver for Directus ?. ",
    "hybridvision": "For anyone finding this, I was able to get Directus 6.4.1 working with Laravel Valet by adding a custom Nginx configuration (it was easier than trying to make a driver). More details here: https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/1717#issuecomment-322052712. @WellingGuzman: Thanks for the fix but I don't think it is fully working - after upgrading I can bookmark some settings pages but if I try to bookmark /settings with the name of Admin for example, the link doesn't work - it takes me to a table view.\nStrangely, if I bookmark settings/permissions, it works but if I bookmark settings/tables, it doesn't work.\nI've also noticed that the active class is sometimes applied to the wrong link in the sidebar (ie. not the bookmark link I just clicked on). This only seems to happen on the bookmark links that work correctly... I've tested this on the latest build and also the latest develop branch and it's the same. It seems quite buggy but maybe there's something I'm missing in my setup.. I did some more testing and it seems that when I have a space in the bookmark name, it doesn't work correctly: eg. Tables Admin for settings/tables fails but Tables_Adminas the name makes the link work.\nFor the active class being applied incorrectly, it seems to be when you have multiple bookmark references under the same path - eg. settings/tablesand settings/permissions.. Hi @WellingGuzman, sorry I missing your message earlier. My schema is the default from a fresh install of Directus into an empty database. I don't have access to that computer at the moment but I can try to share it when I get back.\nI'm wondering if it is somehow related to OS/DB server version because I don't see these bookmark problems here on a newer OS (but older DB server version). It's similar to the difference in behaviour described here: https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/1741#issuecomment-323081213. I'm not sure if this is directly related but when I re-order the fields and then go to edit or add a record in that table, the old field order is used until I do a full refresh.\nI have also seen some odd behaviour while testing where it looks like data I enter into the admin settings for field interface options (eg. placeholder text and options JSON) is not recorded. It appears to save normally but then I get a little warning icon in the User Interface column and it has the tooltip Requires additional setup. When I click to edit that field immediately, everything is blank in the Interface Options popup (ie. no placeholder text and no options JSON). At this point, if I refresh the whole page, the warning icon is no longer present and if I open the Interface Options popup, I see the data I entered previously.\nI'm on the latest commit from the develop branch but I think I was seeing it in master too.. @WellingGuzman / @peremp: I'm on the same latest version and I see the reqid parameter but only for viewing specific records. For example:\n\nNone of the other API requests seem to include this parameter...\nAlso, I noticed that there's a constant polling of the messages table. I guess this is needed for the messaging functionality but is there a way to disable it if we don't use it? (Sorry, a bit off topic). @trk - I was trying to get this to work too and in the end I found it simpler to add a custom Nginx configuration file to Valet. You can do so by adding the .conf file to your ~/.valet/Nginx/ directory (in the Valet setup, Nginx will load all configuration files from this directory).\nIn my case, I called it ~/.valet/Nginx/directus.conf. Here's a sample with a few notes if it helps:\n```Nginx\nserver {\n    listen *:80;\n    server_name directus; # The hostname you want to use\nroot /full/path/to/directus; # Update this to your path\nindex index.php index.html index.htm;\n\nlocation / {\n    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php$args;\n}\n\nlocation /api {\n\n    if (!-e $request_filename) {\n        rewrite ^/1/extensions/([^/]+) /api/api.php?run_extension=$1 last;\n    }\n    rewrite ^ /api/api.php?run_api_router=1 last;\n\n}\n\nlocation ~ ^/(media|storage)/.*\\.(php|phps|php5|htm|shtml|xhtml|cgi.+)?$ {\n    add_header Content-Type text/plain;\n}\n\n\n\nlocation ~ \\.php$ {\n    fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\\.php)(/.+)$;\n    # I used the Valet sock file - update to your username below:\n    fastcgi_pass unix:/Users/<username>/.valet/valet.sock;\n    fastcgi_index index.php;\n    fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;\n    include fastcgi_params;\n}\n\n}\n```\nYou will also need to manually add your hostname to your hosts file. In my case I have it running at http://directus/ so I added the following to my /etc/hosts file:\n127.0.0.1   directus\nFinally, you need to restart Valet and Nginx via this command: valet restart\nOnce you do that, it should work :). That's what I was getting before I made the custom Nginx configuration. The problem is with the URL rewriting and redirects. Did you make sure you followed all the steps and restarted Valet? Maybe it isn't using your new configuration because of an error.\nYou can make sure your Nginx configuration is ok by running: sudo nginx -t\nAnother thing to try: run the Directus installer again and see if it shows that everything is ok - you should not see any warnings about rewrites on the final confirmation page. It's essential that this is working otherwise none of the API calls will function.\nYou can also try calling some API endpoint URLs directly and see what you get.. @trk: I think I see the problem: line 30 of your directus.conf file needs to be edited to have the correct path of your valet.sock file. In the example I gave I put <username> and I meant for you to replace that with your own username.\nTry updating that and restarting Valet and then hopefully it will work.\nYou can test if the API rewrites are working by going to http://directus/api/1.1/ping - you should see the text pong in the window.. Great, I'm glad it worked :)\nI did try writing a driver for Valet but trying to translate the Nginx rewrites was making my head hurt so I opted for this approach instead. It would be cleaner to have a driver but for my purposes, this is a reasonable compromise.. Hi @WellingGuzman - no, I never typed the word NULLanywhere. I just went to the table, clicked \"Add New Column\" and then filled out the field name and hit save like so:\n\nYou will notice in this screenshot above that the default value field is actually empty and there is just the placeholder NULL. However, as soon as I hit save and come back to look at the field settings, it is now the string \"NULL\" instead of being empty:\n\nIn this screenshot, I just clicked in the box and selected the text to show it is not a placeholder.\nI'm not sure what is going on but at some point the value is being made a string. I'm new to Directus so I don't know how this was handled previously...\n@benhaynes - when the default value field is empty, the placeholder says NULLso couldn't an empty default value be considered NULL? It doesn't really make sense to me that I enter nothing in the field and when I come back, it's populated with the string \"NULL\". I think it should remain empty and that be considered NULL. Maybe I'm missing some possible use cases but that makes most sense to me... I guess the explicit checkbox would be clearest if we can't have an empty value for some reason.\n. Hi @WellingGuzman, I'm using Chrome 59.0.3071.115 so I don't think there's any problem with the placeholder. When I inspect the element, the value is being set to \"NULL\":\n\n. An update on this: I tried on a different system with a similar setup but newer OS (MacOS 10.12.6) and with a fresh Directus install, this behaviour is not there.\nI then went back to the original system and did a fresh Git clone, composer install, created a blank database and installed Directus again. On this system (OS X 10.9.5), the \"NULL\" behaviour reported in this ticket remains... I even tried a different browser and confirmed that an empty string is being sent when I save the column on the problematic system.\nAside from the OS version, I'm not sure what could influence this behaviour. On the working system, the PHP version is slightly older (7.0.9 vs 7.0.13) and so is the database server (MariaDB 10.1.16 vs 10.2.7). Do you think the database server version could be the cause? . Ah I see - no, it's MariaDB 10.2.7 that has the problem so it seems to be a change that was introduced in the newer 10.2 version. More info here if you're interested: https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/what-is-mariadb-102/\nI've never had issues with MairaDB for development on other projects but I guess officially it's not supported by Directus?. Thanks @WellingGuzman! If you have time to do some tests with MariaDB, that would be great because it does seem a bit buggy with Directus. Maybe I'll have to use MySQL in the end...\nBy the way, I don't know which system you use but if you're on a Mac, it's easy to use Homebrew to install MariaDB - the current is 10.2 but you can install 10.1 by specifying mariadb@10.1.. Thanks @WellingGuzman - it works perfectly now! :). ",

I am talking about the filters array which is not working as expected. \nAccording to the docs: if u want to make adjustments before saving to the database u need to add this code to configuration.php\nphp\n[\n    'filters' => [\n        'table.insert.users:before' => function ($data) {\n            $data['secret_key'] => rand(); // This is not correct PHP syntax btw\n            return $data;\n        }\n    ];\n];\nBut in my original issue I was mentioning that this is not working. Also the docs uses the wrong PHP syntax which is causing a 500 error, very confusing.\nSo reveal the code snippet below, I am trying to add an uid to the current data set and then save it to the database with this code.\nphp\n// This is not working\n'filters' => [\n    'table.insert.orders:before' => function($data) {\n        $data['uid'] = 'test';\n        return $data;\n    },\n],\nI hope u understand now my issue and I am hoping for any solution.\nThanks!!. @WellingGuzman @benhaynes This issue is still a problem. When I wanted to use a class which implements the HookInterface class instead of your solution the data won't store anymore because it is not returning the correct instance.\nI think the best approach would be:\nThe system looks for any active dynamic hooks classes inside the events folder inside the root directory. For example, below a example event class.\n```php\n<?php\nnamespace Directus\\Events; // New namespace\nuse Directus\\Hooks\\HookInterface\n// Before|TableName|Action or After|TableName|Action.\n// In this test class we use the before filter and we have a table called 'order'.\nclass BeforeOrderInsert implements HookInterface\n{\n    /\n     * Access the data before inserting\n     \n     * @param  array $payload\n     * @return array $payload\n     /\n    public function handle($payload = null)\n    {\n        // Do something with the code and return\n        return $payload;\n    }\n}\n```\nWhen the systems detects any active filter/hooks it is executing it automatically.. @WellingGuzman I want to use classes inside the configuration.php** and not a function kind of way. \nIn your the first solution u was saying you are open for any suggestions. The example above is one of my suggestion. To look automatically for any active hooks.. ",
    "peremp": "Looks like the problem is located at \"api/core/Directus/Db/TableGateway/BaseTableGateway.php\" file.\nAt line 253:\n253: $recordData = $this->applyHook('table.insert:before', [$tableName, $recordData]);\n254: // @TODO: All hook payload are going to be an object to prevent confusion\n255: // $recordData = $this->applyHook('table.insert.' . $tableName . '.:before', [$recordData]);\nIf you comment the line 253 and uncomment the line 255 the filters will work... But I'm not sure if this will have other implications so lets wait for @WellingGuzman :-). 6.3.9\nEdit: This also happens on the 6.4.0. Looks like it is solved in directus 6.4.0. But still, this is a big issue for the 6.3.9.\nIf you know the reason or in what commit you solved this for 6.4.0, I could do the fix for the 6.3.9.. No sorry :-(!\nAnd tbh my focus is the migration from 6.3.9 to 6.4.0. It's not. \nAs you can see in the image, I'm editing an item from a table \"solutions\". The solution has a M2M field called \"Problems\".\nWhen I click to a problem from the M2M list, an overlay is opened to edit the problem:\n\nNow, take a look at the field \"Description\". It should be a WYSIWYG, but it isn't.\nAlso, as I commented previously, if I make some change to the problem description and then click \"save\", the description is not saved.\n. Screenshots are from 6.3.9.\nBut it also happens on 6.4.0 with a regular wysiwyg (Does not shows options on text-select). I'll try to recreate the scenario and send you the SQL.. Install directus (6.4.0 latest), then load this SQL: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0sF62qJHeE5YWEzWUJSMjJNUmc\nThen, do exactly this:\n1. Go to problems.\n2. Edit \"problem 1\"\n3. Click on the related solution \"Solution 2\" to edit it through the overlay.\n4. select some text on the \"Solution > description\" textarea to see that the WYSIWYG is not loaded.\n5. Change the title to \"Solution 2 mod\".\n6. Save (the solution in the overlay) and save (the problem that we were editing)\nThe \"Solution 2\" title is not saved. A warning \"Nothing changed, nothing saved\" appears.\nIf you repeat all the steps, then the changes on \"Solution 2\" are saved. I have seen other casuistic where the item in the overlay is not saved, but I can't reproduce the exact steps.. I had no luck reproducing it. But an editor told me just yesterday that this still happens.\nI've been thinking, and maybe is related to the \"cache\" problem I reported here https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/1708\nWhat I mean is, maybe the changes are saved, but they are not able to see them. But again, not 100% sure. I'll try to find the exact way to reproduce it.. perfect :+1: . Still happens.\nNote that this only happens on creation. Later on edition you can add related solutions with images and works fine.. Ok, lets continue on slack :). Do you have an ETA for this? this is a big issue for our editors :-(\nI can try to fix it, but some guidance would be nice so I do not waste too much time just looking for the root of the problem.. It works :). @benhaynes The de-select option could work too. The other options of the select doesn't keep the view so I think that is not really important which fix is applied.\n@WellingGuzman I don't understand your question at all. I tested it, and I could click on \"save and stay\" as many times as I wanted. The option was not de-selected but the event was triggered correctly.\n. It's working for me. Anyway I reverted the event to \"change\" and de-selected the option.. I'm on Chrome.\nTested it on Firefox too.. Not agree at all... sometimes the status column is useful on junction tables. Imagine something like this:\nProblem (this item): How to learn french (published)\nSolution (related item): Duolingo (published)\nUse case (junction table): How to learn french - Duolingo (draft)\nThe problem, how to learn french, can have X solutions.\nThe solution, Duolingo, can solve X problems.\nIf a web visitor suggest a new solution for the problem (a new use case), the draft status is useful to validate the use case before publishing it.\n. I will do this. I was thinking on keeping the \"loading\" overlay (class=\"loading blocking\") but with some transparency on the background.\nIs it ok for you?\n.  I think that the changes are not correct:\n```\n// TableViewRightPane.js line 164\n.filter(function(model) {\n     return !model.get('hidden_list') && !model.get('hidden_input');\n})\n```\nRight now the column will be visible only if both (hidden_list and hidden_input) are 'false'.\nI think that the correct filter should only take hidden_list into account:\n```\n// TableViewRightPane.js line 164\n.filter(function(model) {\n     return !model.get('hidden_list');\n})\n```\nAnyway, in directus 6.4.0 you can't change the hidden_list value (or at least I can't find the option). Right now I'm changing this value directly on the DB.. The only problem I see on removing the hidden_list and having hidden_input for both... i for M2M columns.\nBecause having a M2M column available in the filters makes no sense.\nSo, despite adding visual noise... I vote for adding another icon column.. Text input, slug, textarea, numeric... Haven't tried all.. I found the bug on: a55b114. Fixed. Thx!. Seems that this is happening more often than expected.\nAnother easy example that is happening to us:\n- Open any item from any table.\n- Edit any text/varchar field (or any WYSIWYG).\n- Save (Directus send you back to table list)\n- Enter the item you edited\nExpected:\nThe item is modified.\nCurrent:\nThe item is modified BUT you still see the old information until you disable the cache using the developers tools.\nThis is a big problem in the sense that, if you save again, you overwrite the changes that you have done before.\nAlso, the editors can't be 100% sure that their changes are applied or not.. Hello!\nI was on vacation :)! I'll test this as soon as possible @benhaynes @WellingGuzman . Request Method:GET\nStatus Code:200 OK (from disk cache)\nTested it also on the latest version of develop. Same behavior. . @WellingGuzman I'm using nginx.\nLooks like it's working on the edit page. Still happens on the table list:\nRequest URL:http://localhost:8282/api/1.1/tables/solutions/rows?currentPage=0&perPage=30&sort=id&sort_order=ASC&status=1%2C2&columns_visible=slug%2Ctitle%2Cdescription%2Cauthor_full_name%2Cauthor_email%2Cauthor_avatar%2Cmain_tag_id%2Cid%2Cstatus\nRequest Method:GET\nStatus Code:200 OK (from disk cache)\nAlso, not sure if this is related to this changes, but the list of related items (M2M interface) is always empty, even if you relate some items.\n. Version: develop bed51a7\nTested on incognito window and on a normal window clearing and disabling the cache.\nSame result: The M2M list is empty, and the param is not included when loading a table list.. Still having cache problems on table lists.\nRequest URL:http://localhost:8282/api/1.1/tables/solutions/rows?currentPage=0&perPage=30&sort=id&sort_order=ASC&status=1%2C2&columns_visible=slug%2Ctitle%2Cdescription%2Cauthor_full_name%2Cauthor_email%2Cauthor_avatar%2Cmain_tag_id%2Cid%2Cstatus\nRequest Method:GET\nStatus Code:200 OK **(from disk cache)**\nMaybe is something related to Nginx, but I can't see the headers that you mention @WellingGuzman . Are you sure about the reqid? https://github.com/directus/directus/blob/b0677b8512527bec04a1eec3ac4d4208dbfa7d1f/app/core/entries/EntriesModel.js#L343\nI'm always using the latest version of develop (right now: commit b0677b8), and I still see the reqid on calls like:\nhttp://localhost:8282/api/1.1/tables/problems/rows/481?preview=true&reqid=1504686607400\nTo test I use Chrome (incognito window), so the extensions are not loaded. Anyway I have Adblocks, Postman and JSON View extensions.\nWe have cache for statics, not for GET/POST requests.\n. Hey, just tested it on develop latest (98cfd46), and still happening to me.\nSorry for the delay, I was on vacation.. Still happens. Tested on Firefox and Chrome.\nI think that this issue is not related to https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/1708, because this happens even if I disable the cache.\nI'll try to create an schema to reproduce this issue.. I'll send you the schema via Slack. Trying to make a new schema to you, I realized that this problem is easy to reproduce (at least on 6.4.2). \nYou just need 3 tables:\n- problems (id, title, status)\n- solutions (id, title, status)\n- use_cases (id, problem_id, solution_id)\nThen:\n- Add a M2M to both, problems and solutions, using use_cases as junction.\n- create a problem\n- create a solution\n- edit the problem and relate the created solution to the problem.\nThe error Attempted to load new record post-insert with empty result. Lookup via row id: appears.. Update for this issue:\nFollowing the previous schema, I found that when I create an item (a problem or a solution), and I go to edit it, an empty item appears on the M2M list:\n\nWhen I add another item to the list and save, the error appears:\n\nBUT if I remove the empty item, it works.\nThe error also appears if I add an item on creation.\n\nIn this case, the problem is created but without the related solution. Maybe the error here is the same... the collection have an \"empty\" value, that makes it crash.\n. More info about the error:\nThe error comes from the backend when doing the PATCH: http://localhost:8282/api/1.1/tables/probs/rows/6) 500 (Internal Server Error)\nAnd this is the API response:\n{\n  \"success\":false,\n  \"error\":{\n    \"message\":\"Attempted to load new record post-insert with empty result. Lookup via row id: \"\n  },\n  \"code\":0,\n  \"class\":\"RuntimeException\",\n  \"file\":\"\\/var\\/www\\/html\\/api\\/core\\/Directus\\/Database\\/TableGateway\\/RelationalTableGateway.php\",\n  \"line\":193\n}. {\"problems\":[{\"meta\":{\"table\":\"use_cases\",\"type\":\"collection\",\"total\":0,\"Draft\":1,\"Deleted\":0,\"Published\":0,\"total_entries\":1},\"data\":{}},{\"data\":{\"id\":1}}]}. yep, it's the request payload.

    "wittwerch": "I'm not talking about translations, that is fine. It's about the locale used in the frontend. It looks like it is currently hardcoded to english?\nhttps://github.com/directus/directus/blob/master/app/main.js#L37\nChanging the locale is important because date and time is formatted really different depending on your country/language. Checkout https://momentjs.com/ and the \"Multiple Locale Support\" section.\nIn the screenshot above the user interface is changed to German, but still the date/times are formatted in the english locale (11:22am for example should be 11:22 in german because we use 24h format).. I think you only need to include the https://momentjs.com/ and set the locale. \n@rijkvanzanten there are some pre-defined formats in moment.js which could be used.\nmoment().format('L');\nfor english (US) =>  /07/25/2017\nfor german (Switzerland) => 25.07.2017\n. The error appeared once I navigate to the detail view: http://127.0.0.1:8020/files/1\nNow upgraded to b38906b9de9b6916888938e262acf12ee7649888 and error doesn't appear anymore.\nHowever clicking on \"Save\" still throws an error: \"Data: The field cannot be empty\".. For me personally having a flag on the delete event would be the obvious option.\nSoft Delete = delete\nHard Delete = purge\nThat would mean on a table without soft delete the events fired would be: create/read/update/purge. That's weird.. :)\nSo I think we either find a good verb for soft-deletion, so that we can use the delete verb for hard deletes, or we should stick to a flag.\n. Does unique mean it can't be null? Speaking from a user perspective I think auto-generating the value would be fine. . I think Null would be the safer choice. No need to expose random generated tokens.. The selection now works. However I agree with @benhaynes that the dropdown needs a little rework.\n\nAs you type the at-symbol, a list should pop off even when you didn't enter the next char\nThe list should be smaller\nYou should be able to navigate with the cursor to select an entry\nAllow the enter button to be used to select a value :)  see #1621 . Given we have capacity in the next weeks we'll put up a PR!. Looking at the code I found out that you can press \"Shift-Enter\" to add a comment. However for most non-technical persons (marketing people) we should change that to enter and and add a button to submit.. My experience from other systems and user behaviour is, that everybody will accidentally hit enter and submit a comment to early. In combination with comments being immutable, this will lead to frustration.\nWhy not add a submit button?. Awesome, thanks!. My native language is german, so I will try to translate the remaining strings.. :). @WellingGuzman Actually beside the two tasks the implementation is complete. I struggled a bit with both tasks (that's why I created them in that PR). Could you have a look at it? . Ok, once we add permissions the view loads.\n\n\nAs a non-admin user I can try to give myself admin permissions. That ends in an error:\n\n. @WellingGuzman: Let's say I'm in the group \"Editor\" which has some basic permissions. If I go to my profile the group dropdown appears and I can \"try\" to assigne the \"Admin\" group to myself. That ends in the error you see in the screenshot above.\n. Yes that would be good!. Ok, I was not aware of these problems. I think removing composer.lock will introduce a whole bunch of potential new problems. You loose track of what exact versions were used to develop a feature. Also during the deployment you potentially end up with different versions on test and production environments.\nHowever I'm going to add a composer.lock to our forked Directus project. Thanks for the open communication, you can close the issue.\n. Hi Ben\nThanks for your detailed feedback. I understand why you want these basic metrics, but in larger corporate environments software that phones home is a no-go. However since it's open source we will simply remove that call and maintain that in our fork, otherwise we won't pass security.\nSorry for not posting on FeatHub, forgot about it. I'm used to have that on Github too..\nBest \nChristian. @WellingGuzman Updated the issue, was a bit in a rush when reporting it :). Have you thought about using an existing library for that? \nhttps://github.com/cocur/slugify. ",

I'm on a European-style long vacation right now, I'll have to get back to you mid August or so!. For what it's worth, I'm at around three seconds when querying the rows endpoint now, so perhaps some improvement has occurred over the summer. Filtering out a single item using an [eq] filter takes 1.1s. These are till orders of magnitude beyond direct mysql queries. \n/rows using curl -w \"%{time_connect} + %{time_starttransfer} = %{time_total}:\n0,005889 + 2,641796 = 2,818171.

I'm glad we're agreed on what the bookmarks should do :) Lemme see if I can pinpoint the buggy filter behavior in a more minimal example, I'll get back to you. . So I started from a clean directus-docker, added a table 'table1', added a row 'thing' and created to things, 'thing1' and 'thing2'. Then:\n1. add filter thing == 'thing2'.

Hey,\nI redid the test, first making sure to update to the latest from docker hub (6.4.5), which I hope is new enough.

You could bump twig/twig dependency in composer.json to 2.x to see if it gets rid of that error.\nBut, it would probably be safer to not run on PHP 7 without vetting other dependency compatibility with PHP 7..

This file controls many aspects of PHP's behavior.  In order for PHP to\n; read it, it must be named 'php.ini'.  PHP looks for it in the current\n; working directory, in the path designated by the environment variable\n; PHPRC, and in the path that was defined in compile time (in that order).\n; Under Windows, the compile-time path is the Windows directory.  The\n; path in which the php.ini file is looked for can be overridden using\n; the -c argument in command line mode.\n;\n; The syntax of the file is extremely simple.  Whitespace and Lines\n; beginning with a semicolon are silently ignored (as you probably guessed).\n; Section headers (e.g. [Foo]) are also silently ignored, even though\n; they might mean something in the future.\n;\n; Directives are specified using the following syntax:\n; directive = value\n; Directive names are case sensitive - foo=bar is different from FOO=bar.\n;\n; The value can be a string, a number, a PHP constant (e.g. E_ALL or M_PI), one\n; of the INI constants (On, Off, True, False, Yes, No and None) or an expression\n; (e.g. E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE), or a quoted string (\"foo\").\n;\n; Expressions in the INI file are limited to bitwise operators and parentheses:\n; |        bitwise OR\n; &        bitwise AND\n; ~        bitwise NOT\n; !        boolean NOT\n;\n; Boolean flags can be turned on using the values 1, On, True or Yes.\n; They can be turned off using the values 0, Off, False or No.\n;\n; An empty string can be denoted by simply not writing anything after the equal\n; sign, or by using the None keyword:\n;\n;  foo =         ; sets foo to an empty string\n;  foo = none    ; sets foo to an empty string\n;  foo = \"none\"  ; sets foo to the string 'none'\n;\n; If you use constants in your value, and these constants belong to a\n; dynamically loaded extension (either a PHP extension or a Zend extension),\n; you may only use these constants after the line that loads the extension.\n; \n;\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;\n; About this file ;\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;\n; This is the recommended, PHP 5-style version of the php.ini-dist file.  It\n; sets some non standard settings, that make PHP more efficient, more secure,\n; and encourage cleaner coding.\n;\n; The price is that with these settings, PHP may be incompatible with some\n; applications, and sometimes, more difficult to develop with.  Using this\n; file is warmly recommended for production sites.  As all of the changes from\n; the standard settings are thoroughly documented, you can go over each one,\n; and decide whether you want to use it or not.\n;\n; For general information about the php.ini file, please consult the php.ini-dist\n; file, included in your PHP distribution.\n;\n; This file is different from the php.ini-dist file in the fact that it features\n; different values for several directives, in order to improve performance, while\n; possibly breaking compatibility with the standard out-of-the-box behavior of\n; PHP.  Please make sure you read what's different, and modify your scripts\n; accordingly, if you decide to use this file instead.\n;\n; - register_long_arrays = Off     [Performance]\n;     Disables registration of the older (and deprecated) long predefined array\n;     variables ($HTTP_*_VARS).  Instead, use the superglobals that were\n;     introduced in PHP 4.1.0\n; - display_errors = Off           [Security]\n;     With this directive set to off, errors that occur during the execution of\n;     scripts will no longer be displayed as a part of the script output, and thus,\n;     will no longer be exposed to remote users.  With some errors, the error message\n;     content may expose information about your script, web server, or database\n;     server that may be exploitable for hacking.  Production sites should have this\n;     directive set to off.\n; - log_errors = On                [Security]\n;     This directive complements the above one.  Any errors that occur during the\n;     execution of your script will be logged (typically, to your server's error log,\n;     but can be configured in several ways).  Along with setting display_errors to off,\n;     this setup gives you the ability to fully understand what may have gone wrong,\n;     without exposing any sensitive information to remote users.\n; - output_buffering = 4096        [Performance]\n;     Set a 4KB output buffer.  Enabling output buffering typically results in less\n;     writes, and sometimes less packets sent on the wire, which can often lead to\n;     better performance.  The gain this directive actually yields greatly depends\n;     on which Web server you're working with, and what kind of scripts you're using.\n; - register_argc_argv = Off       [Performance]\n;     Disables registration of the somewhat redundant $argv and $argc global\n;     variables.\n; - magic_quotes_gpc = Off         [Performance]\n;     Input data is no longer escaped with slashes so that it can be sent into\n;     SQL databases without further manipulation.  Instead, you should use the\n;     function addslashes() on each input element you wish to send to a database.\n; - variables_order = \"GPCS\"       [Performance]\n;     The environment variables are not hashed into the $_ENV.  To access\n;     environment variables, you can use getenv() instead.\n; - error_reporting = E_ALL        [Code Cleanliness, Security(?)]\n;     By default, PHP suppresses errors of type E_NOTICE.  These error messages\n;     are emitted for non-critical errors, but that could be a symptom of a bigger\n;     problem.  Most notably, this will cause error messages about the use\n;     of uninitialized variables to be displayed.\n; - allow_call_time_pass_reference = Off     [Code cleanliness]\n;     It's not possible to decide to force a variable to be passed by reference\n;     when calling a function.  The PHP 4 style to do this is by making the\n;     function require the relevant argument by reference.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;\n; Language Options ;\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;\n; Enable the PHP scripting language engine under Apache.\nengine = On\n; Allow the <? tag.

That was fast.  It's working great now. . Yep.  Here's my phpinfo from the mysqli section:\n\n. Yes.  I can login, though there is usually an error on the first attempt now.  But after that things work mostly fine.  When I attempt to upgrade the db via the cli, that's when I get the error.  I'm wondering if the few errors I'm getting in the cms are due to not upgrading the db or other changes that are making my custom interfaces fail.. When I check the PHP version in the terminal it's 5.6.30, so I must be using the local version rather than the MAMP version.  I didn't even think about that.  I checked the modules loaded in the terminal and it says mysqli is loaded.  In the users table, there's an active column. . I added the path for MAMP's PHP and things are working now.  Everything updated just fine. Login went smooth and it looks like the other errors are gone too. Sorry to bother you with this issue. Thanks so much for your help!. Works great!  Thanks!. ",

I'm also having this issue across versions 6.4.6 & 6.4.7 (build download from releases page).\nSorting doesn't seem to update the view, but correct sort is shown on refresh. ~~Drag & drop sort also isn't working for M2M tables, but I don't think that's related~~ (this seems to have been fixed after running db:upgrade).\nDump20180227.zip\n. I assume also tied this issue, is that if I try and sort by a M2M column (which doesn't work, but is applied to the database) and then refresh the page, I then get an error says Server Error Unable to find the column [column_name] which is correct because that column doesn't actually exist because it's an alias.\nI assume this would be handled in the app sorting process that's not working.. Hey - just updated to 6.4.9 and this patch kinda breaks functionality for nested tables.\ne.g. If I add a new item to my nested table and then sort them, the page refreshes undoing my changes.\nSince I don't actually need my nested tables to be sorted by column as they have draggable sorting, I just added this bit of css to disable the functionality .related-table th:not(.js-sort-toggle) { pointer-events:none; }. It displays correctly when you edit an existing row and save as well (with or without making a change), not just adding a new row. It's happening to me with a single file interface (only shows an id instead of the thumbnail unless a new row is added or existing row is edited). . I've really hackily patched this for an image field by adding if(data.file) data.file = '<div class=\"media-thumb\"><img src=\"'+ directusPath +'/storage/uploads/thumbs/'+ data.file +'.jpg\" class=\"img landscape\"></div>'; //where file is column name to line 30 of EntriesJunctionCollection.js\nYou could do something similar for a different field by doing an ajax api call, but I'm not sure how you'd handle it with async and returning the values.\nHopefully won't be an issue in the upcoming release :).

But then I was able to create the bug by duplicating my users table.... Sorry if I wasn't clear. I have more information.\nYes, I have already tried it as you recommend: by clicking \"manage\" in settings > tables. The table appears in the left sidebar, but there is no data shown while my database has hundreds of rows. However, I CAN add new rows to the managed table, and they do show up in the database. But the table list view shows none.\nFurthermore, I tried adding a different table. That table had no primary key. After using Directus to add a primary key, the table data showed as expected. Perhaps this is related? I should note that the non-functioning tables already have primary keys in columns named 'id'\n. I see. Funny, it was only the tables with a status column that I tried using while evaluating Directus.\nMay I ask, if I simply change the name of this column, will that fix everything? Besides id are there any other \"magic names\" to be aware of?\nThanks!. I can't confirm if that commit fixed, since I don't know how to use the dev branch.

Thank you for replying so quickly, as usual :)\nI use 10.1.25-MariaDB. Works fine with Directus 6.3.8. Composer seems to have installed everything from the beginning.\nWhat do you mean by sql mode ?. @WellingGuzman \nI found the problem : for some reasons, ownership of mysql (mariaDb) files was broken, so mariaDb couldn't write in its own files. Now it works.\nHave a nice day!. Sure @WellingGuzman ;\nMariaDb or MySQL (they work the same way) is made of files containing data (the actual database) ; usually it's located in the /var/lib/mysql directory, sometimes (like in our case) it can be located elsewhere . \nTo find where it's located, you can have a look at the /etc/mysql/my.cnf file, the datadir variable.\nFor some reason, the owner of the /var/lib/mysql directory wasn't mysql, so mysql couldn't write any data. That's why new tables couldn't be created. I tested just with phpMyAdmin, table creations were refused as well.\nThen, making a chown -r mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql (or any other directory where data is actually located) as a superuser solved the problem.\nDirectus wasn't the source of the problem in my case..

Hi @rijkvanzanten,\nYes, on line 32 of config.php I have: \ndefine('DIRECTUS_PATH', '/projects/calculator/cms/'); \nThe full url is: http://my_url.co.uk/projects/calculator/cms/login.php to the login page. . So from an installation perspective, the ftp from the latest build went without an issue. I noticed that the ModRewrite was marked as No once the database details had been entered, but as I understand it, this is a bug and installation completed with no problem.\nI will contact my technical support to see if this is the issue RE: Apache and relay back to you. . Hi @rijkvanzanten, I have just spoken with my technical support and can confirm: Apache is running on the server and mod_rewrite permissions are also in place. . Hi @rijkvanzanten yes, the .htaccess files are there too. I unchecked Rewrite in the root directory .htacces but this didn't fix it. . Hi I installed Directus via ftp - uploaded the most recent build to my server. . @WellingGuzman I used your medium post to install:\nhttps://medium.com/directus/installing-directus-on-lamp-758e8d52daf4\nTo give some context, this is a LAMP Bundle on shared hosting, not cloud hosted. . @WellingGuzman @rijkvanzanten Hi Guys, have you any more suggestions or things we could look at to get to the bottom of why this is not working? Many thanks in advance. . @rijkvanzanten @WellingGuzman I have contacted my hosting provider who have run a fresh install and have returned the following correspondence: \n\"This is an update regarding your case with the directus installation. As we have tried this on our end to also install manually. We get the same error message after installing and trying to log in. We will be forwarding this case our our administrators in order for them to check if this CMS is possible to run on the shared hosting package, Since all the requirements are met by our server.\"\nMany thanks. . Hi @rijkvanzanten I am on slack and happy to set you up with a ftp account (and send them to you via DM?) to reproduce the issue? I host with 1and1.co.uk. Could that work?. A quick update, have placed an ssl over the domain and this hasn't fixed it, sadly. \nI have run an additional test deployment at a higher level on the server and the post method still doesn't complete. This one is just one directory down. \nI have a db and ftp user account set up if @rijkvanzanten would like to see what is causing the issue. \nI am working with php 7, mysql 5.5 and Apache. It's on a shared hosting platform with 1and1.co.uk. . Update: this has been fixed, the .htaccess file's rewrite rule needed to be altered to point directly to the subfolders:\n- projects/calculator/cms\n- projects/calculator/cms/api - login then works! . Hi @rijkvanzanten @WellingGuzman - so the install was a fresh one onto a shared hosting platform, so unfortunately, I don't have access to these config files. Not working in the cloud. :/ \nI followed the article @rijkvanzanten wrote on medium (working with ftp) and actually sent the problem over to my hosting providers, as I was totally lost as to why this wasn't working. They found the solution. \nI can show you my own virtual host file on my local machine, but this may not be useful. \nI think Directus is great and I have another project backed up to use it for again. The rationale for the bombardment (which I apologise for) was to successfully implement the product onto a live server as a test - as this will be my maiden voyage with Directus. I have to deploy this product to Live, along with it's front end tomorrow (which will in fact, be housed on Digital Ocean) - I have a dev ops guy to assist in the implementation tomorrow also. \nI'm not sure if this helps in the future, but thanks for all the great work on this - it's going to be such a great tool for projects moving forward. :) I hope to have a great use case to show you very soon. Thanks again. . ",

Hi @WellingGuzman ! Here is the schema for the database. \nschema.zip\nI am using 6.4.1 from the release versions. \nThere is a generic user for the directus, which is the following : \nuser : webmaster@directus.com\npassword : directus\n. @WellingGuzman Good job, Thanks ! . @WellingGuzman I've just tried it on my end. I replaced the code from \"TranslationView.js\" by the code mentionned in commit e36f94e. This unfortunately does not work for me.. @WellingGuzman Indeed I cleared the browser cache before trying it. I also tried with another browser to be certain of it.. @WellingGuzman I will test the problem on the develop branch to see if it works. I keep you up once it's done.. @WellingGuzman It indeed solves the problem ! Do you guys know when you're going to include it in a release ?. @WellingGuzman It was not a map field. I would gladly send you a database schema but I lost the files due to a broken hard drive, as soon as I am able to retrieve them I will provide them.. @WellingGuzman Here is the database schema to illustrate the problem. I was not able to recover my old database, so I created a new one. In the \"bureau_de_location\" table I have a many to one relationship linked to the table \"ville\". If you try cliking on the table, you'll get the error. If you remove the field \"ville\" in the \"bureau_de_location\" table (which contains the many to one relationship), the error won't be there anymore. \ndirectus_immobilier.zip\nThe credentials to log in : directus@directus.com, password : directus\n. @WellingGuzman @rijkvanzanten This issue seems to be resolved in the \"develop\" branch. The tables containing fields of type \"many to one\" are now working. The only problem left remains in the display part of the dropdown : the text does not appear (although properly configured in the interface option)\n\n. It was a configuration mistake, thanks for you help ! This is also solved. . ",

    "parnas": "Yeah, that's correct. Perhaps it should fall back to ping if apache_get_modules is not available.\nAlternatively, and probably more correctly, installation text for \"'Mod_Rewrite Enabled'\" should be altered from \"Mod_Rewrite Enabled\".\nIn my case, there was a problem with accessing the pinged url, which wasn't related to mod_rewrite, so that message was misleading and I had to check the code, to see what exactly in being checked.. Yup, I agree. Changing message (with mention of mod_rewrite in the faq link) is, probably, the best way to proceed.\nI was also thinking of doing  to set up environment variable, but that also will not reliably work with php cgi, and, also, itself depends on mod_env being enabled. \n. Confirmed. Thank you for the report @danibaena I'm looking into that.. Obviously, if that PR would get to be accepted, I would first need to update help's formatting for some of the modules first.. Current output (on my system with \"Cache\" module):\n```\n\nphp bin/directus help\n\nDirectus CLI Modules:\ncache: clear and get details about cache\n    cache:clear \u2013 Clear the whole cache\n    cache:delete \u2013 Delete cache item\n    cache:get \u2013 Get item from cache\n    cache:invalidate \u2013 Invalidate specified tags\ndb: command to create or upgrade the database schema\n    Install the database schema\n    Upgrade the database schema\ninstall: commands to install and configure Directus\n    Configure Directus:\n\n    install:config -h db_host -n db_name -u db_user -p db_pass -d directus_path\n\n    Populate the Database Schema:\n\n    install:database -d directus_path\n\n    Install Initial Configurations:\n\n    install:install -e admin_email -p admin_password -t site_name\n\nlanguage: command to know the missing/removed language keys\n    The Languages difference keys.\nuser: commands to manage Directus users\n    Change User Password:\n\n    user:password -e user_email -p new_password -d directus_path\n\nFor more information on a module use: \"directus help \". Even worse, we store image uploads with extension of the original file. Which means, that it is possible, for example, to upload php file as image.\nAnd yes, we do have .htaccess in uploads that does\n<FilesMatch \"\\.(php|phps|php5|htm|shtml|xhtml|cgi.+)$\">\n    ForceType text/plain\n</FilesMatch>\nbut that is only helping against listed extensions (I've seen php also setup as .phtml and .php4, for example).\nAnd that is just the one type of attack. It's also possible to upload an html file, that would be served from the directus domain and, thus, would have access to directus domain cookies.\nBasically, if I have can upload files, I can get session info of another directus user on the same domain, by sending that user a link to the uploaded file.\nThe files should never be saved with the original extension, instead extensions should be assigned (something like https://github.com/ralouphie/mimey could be used to make defining extensions easier).\nAlso, we already do getimagesize, but we should also check if width and height is zero, and don't accept a file like that. \n@WellingGuzman @benhaynes . Oh, we can use lets? Party on! :). What about when there is a default value for required field?. Merges currently set tags with the newly added ones. (array)$tags is to be able to pass a single tag as a string.. It's a variable variable. To not have copy/paste.\nAs you see, it's called from functions like this: $this->updateTagsArray('invalidateTags', $tags), so, in that case $array would be 'invalidateTags', so it's $this->invalidateTags = array_merge($this->$array, (array)$tags).

I am using this code, as explained in the SDK docs:\n$this->directus = \\Directus\\SDK\\ClientFactory::create(array('database' => array('host' => DB_HOST, 'username' => DB_USER, 'password' => DB_PASSWORD, 'database' => DB_NAME, 'charset' => DB_CHARSET), 'filesystem' => array('root' => $global_config['directus']['root_url'])));\nAll requests are going to \"$this->directus\" - is there a better way to access directus in version 6.4? If you understand you, it means i dont need the PHP SDK anymore?\nThe error happens here:\n$articles = $this->directus->getItems('Articles', $params = [\n      'status' => '1'\n    ]);. Hi, I am sorry, i don't understand your question. I have a project that's running this way\n\nwebroot\n-- directus\n-- project\n\nSo, what is the easiest way to acces the directus data by $client->getItem within PHP?\nThank you in advance.\n. > The Version 0.2.0 (https://github.com/directus/directus-sdk-php/releases/tag/0.2.0) for 6.4 beta?\nDoes this solve the issue \nUnknown column 'hidden_list' in 'field list'\"\n?. Hi, I am not sure why this could solve this - which version of the sdk should I use?\n. Hello again,\nI think I can add new information here. When I do as you told me, I got the same error again. \nPlease remember, I followed the update instructions on the docs site.\nAfter doing:\nALTER TABLE directus_columns ADD list_view varchar(200) DEFAULT NULL\nALTER TABLE directus_columns ADD hidden_list tinyint(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0'\nand same for \"directus_tables\", I got this error:\n\"Key app.settings is not defined.\"\nWhen I downgrade the SDK to 0.1.* via composer - it works - the backend and the frontend.\nBut I see no way to understand why this happens and whats wrong with the schema migration script (php bin/directus db:upgrade) ? \nSo I cant upgrade my Installation to Directus 6.4 with the new SDK 0.2.*, sadly. \nI would be very glad if you can look into this. I am so frustrated, trying to upgrade almost 10 times yet.\n. Hi @WellingGuzman,\n\nALTER TABLE directus_columns ADD list_view varchar(200) DEFAULT NULL\nALTER TABLE directus_columns ADD hidden_list tinyint(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0'\n\nI wrote the code on my own to get the SDK working. \n\nCan you show us some screenshot and logs\n\nThe error I get:\nColumn not found: 1054 Unknown column 'DT.list_view' in 'field list'\n\nare you still using the SDK within Directus composer?\n\nNo, as you told me, I put them now outside the directus folder.\nThis is my composer.json within directus folder:\n{\n  \"require\": {\n    \"php\": \">=5.6.0\",\n    \"slim/slim\": \"2.6.2\",\n    \"slim/extras\": \"dev-master\",\n    \"twig/twig\":  \"1.\",\n    \"zendframework/zend-db\": \"dev-directus\",\n    \"directus/migrations\": \"dev-master\",\n    \"league/flysystem\": \"^1.0\",\n    \"swiftmailer/swiftmailer\": \"^5.4\",\n    \"league/oauth2-google\": \"^2.0\",\n    \"league/oauth2-github\": \"^2.0\",\n    \"league/oauth2-facebook\": \"^2.0\",\n    \"league/oauth1-client\": \"^1.7\"\n  },\n  \"require-dev\": {\n    \"phpunit/phpunit\": \"~3.7.0\"\n  },\n  \"suggest\": {\n    \"paragonie/random_compat\": \"Generates cryptographically more secure pseudo-random bytes\"\n  },\n  \"_require\": {\n    \"rackspace/php-opencloud\": \"dev-master\",\n    \"amazonwebservices/aws-sdk-for-php\": \"1.6.2\",\n    \"aws/aws-sdk-php\": \"2.6.@dev\"\n  },\n  \"autoload\": {\n    \"psr-4\": {\n      \"Directus\\\": \"api/core/Directus/\",\n      \"Directus\\API\\Routes\\\": \"api/routes/\",\n      \"Directus\\Installation\\\": \"installation/includes/\",\n      \"Directus\\Customs\\Embed\\Provider\\\": \"customs/embeds/\",\n      \"Directus\\Customs\\Hooks\\\": \"customs/hooks/\",\n      \"Directus\\Customs\\Hasher\\\": \"customs/hashers/\"\n    },\n    \"files\": [\n      \"api/core/functions.php\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"minimum-stability\": \"dev\",\n  \"repositories\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"git\",\n      \"url\": \"https://github.com/WellingGuzman/Slim-Extras.git\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"git\",\n      \"url\": \"https://github.com/wellingguzman/zend-db\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n-> I guess this is default. And this ist my composer.json within the project folder:\n{\n  \"require\": {\n    \"directus/sdk\": \"0.1.*\",\n    \"twig/twig\": \"^2.0\"\n  },\n  \"minimum-stability\": \"dev\",\n  \"repositories\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"git\",\n      \"url\": \"https://github.com/wellingguzman/zend-db\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n. Some news! I Tried to setup a very clean and new installation of Directus 6.4.3 and PHP-SDK 0.2.0.\nWhat I did:\n\nDownloading the latest release build from here\nRunning the installation wizard and checked that Directus is running well with test data\nInstalling Composer in my project folder\nRunning composer install with this composer.json:\n\n{\n  \"require\": {\n    \"directus/sdk\": \"0.2.*\"\n  },\n  \"minimum-stability\": \"dev\",\n  \"repositories\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"git\",\n      \"url\": \"https://github.com/wellingguzman/zend-db\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nGot exactly the same error:\n\n\nColumn not found: 1054 Unknown column 'hidden_list' in 'field list'\n\n\nWhat I am wrong? OR: Is there any other way to access the Directus database by PHP without use of the SDK?\n\nI thank you guys very much for your time!. Hi Ben, \nI don't use the same composer.json anymore, I already divided it and set up a whole new installation the way you just told me. With the same error. \nI think there is an error within the database access of the SDK. I am doing it exactly the way the webapp-example shows it. But I cant use Directus 6.4.2 with SDK 0.2.0.\nOR: It is correct to use the new Directus with SDK 0.1.0? Because this works in my project!\nFor sure, the API could be a solution - is there any way to use this without having GET requests from my servers project to my servers directus installation? It's incredibly slow so far ...\nThanks in advance!. Hey @WellingGuzman, \n\nWhich Directus version are you using: 6.4.2\nWhich SDK version are you using: 0.2.0\nAre you connecting to the API or directly to the database: Database connection \nWhat's the error you are getting? Only the missing hidden_list?\n\nColumn not found: 1054 Unknown column 'hidden_list' in 'field list'\"\nColumn not found: 1054 Unknown column 'list_view' in 'field list'\"\n\nIf you are getting hidden_list you should run bin/directus db:upgrade.\nWhy can you upgrade using bin/directus db:upgrade? any error?\n\nI already done this (like upgrade info in the docs):\ndb:setup - table 'directus_schema_migrations' already exists. Nothing to do.\ndb:migrate - Migration successful\n. Hey @WellingGuzman,\nyoure great, this fixes the issue completely. Thank you very much for your time and patience! \nOne last question: Is there any use case for PHP SDK 0.2.0?. Maybe this could be mentioned on the download page of the SDK's ;)\nThanks again! \n. Hey @WellingGuzman, \nI have these screenshots for you: \n\n\nAnd this SQL Dump: \ndirectus_6_4_2.sql.zip\nThank you very much - this is why I want to update to 6.4.2 - problem exists in 6.3.x too.\n. Thank you very much, this is fixed!\n. ",
    "jvmejias": "Thank you very much Welling, that was it. I had in fact run that CLI command, but I didn't figured out I had to delete the directus_schema_migrations table before for the update to take effect.\nCongrats to all the team for your hard work with this wonderful CMS!. Hi @WellingGuzman\nI've just updated from 6.4.2 to 6.4.3 (Build branch) and I can confirm you that I had to delete directus_schema_migrations from my current db for the migration to succeed.\nHere is the Git Bash output:\n$ bin/directus db:upgrade\ndb:setup - table 'directus_schema_migrations' already exists. Nothing to do.\ndb:migrate - Not executed\nAnd after directus_schema_migrations deletion:\n$ bin/directus db:upgrade\ndb:setup - directus_schema_migrations table created\ndb:migrate - Migration successful. Hi Ben. Sorry for the delay, option 3 could be fine but I didn't look into it yet.\nI understand your point. However I'll elaborate a little bit my consultation.\nPlease enter the following html in a WYSIWYG Full editor field\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlano de Amadeo Maiuri, localizaci\u00f3n de las bombas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```\n...and it becomes:\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-md-6\">\n<div class=\"my-gallery\" data-pswp-uid=\"1\">\n<figure class=\"max600 btnlupa\">\n<div class=\"iconopeq iconolupa\">&nbsp;</div>\n<a href=\"../../../../media/image-big1.jpg\" data-size=\"2000x1415\"><img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"../../../../media/image1.jpg\" alt=\"Da&ntilde;os de guerra en Pompeya\" /></a></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-md-6\">\n<div class=\"my-gallery\" data-pswp-uid=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"max600 btnlupa\">\n<div class=\"iconopeq iconolupa\">&nbsp;</div>\n<a href=\"../../../../media/image-big2.jpg\" data-size=\"2000x1415\"><img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"../../../../media/image2.jpg\" alt=\"Da&ntilde;os de guerra en Pompeya\" /></a></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"mapabombardeo\" class=\"iconopeq iconomapainfo metido\">\n<h3>Plano de Amadeo Maiuri, localizaci&oacute;n de las bombas</h3>\n</div>\n<div id=\"mapabombardeo2\" class=\"iconogrande iconoexcava metido2 borderclass\" title=\"\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"right\" data-original-title=\"Mostrar imagen a&eacute;rea\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"contenedorimagen ampliado\" style=\"padding-bottom: 73%;\">&nbsp;</div>\n1 - In the first part, some atributes have dissappeared (itemscope, itemtype) and that makes my javascript gallery not to work.\n2 - In the last part, all contents inside the div with class '.contenedorimagen'(two divs and a link) are completely gone...\n3 - My absolute paths are converted to relative (only if the domain name is the same where Directus is). This results in the two images of the example not showing.\nMy storage folder is called media and it is a level up the Directus root directory.\n4 - Spanish accents in the view source button are now showing the decoded entities, so it becomes more difficult to read.\n5 - Indentation is lost\nI can live without 4 and 5, but if my html content is manipulated too much, to the extent of some content dissapearing I cannot use the editor, at least in this project!\n. Hi @rijkvanzanten!\nThanks for your time! I know the 'view source' button, there is where I paste my html content. I create my markup outside Directus and later paste it on there. I'm just using the following editor options: 'bold', 'cursive', 'link' and 'view source'.\nIn your last image, if you click ok and then hit again 'view source' the content has already transformed as described in my example.\nThe main problem I have is with custom attributes being deleted by default. In my example, the editor trims \"itemscope\", \"itemtype\" and \"itemprop\".\nI'd love to have an option to completely deactivate the filtering and leave my input html untouched (at my own risk of course). Will https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/5464f0e59a8c1c53bdd0efe2680db662c9b6957a do that or still apply some filtering?\n. Sounds great @rijkvanzanten!\nI'll get back to you as soon as I try it. Thanks a lot. Hi @rijkvanzanten\nI've just updated to the latest build and I've tried the option you added upon my request.\nIt's pretty cool but there is still a little problem that results in unwanted modifications to the html input.\nIt happens when there is a div inside an a tag, which as far as I know it is valid html5\nTo reproduce, enter the following markup:\n<a href=\"/about-page.php\">\n    <div class=\"article\">\n    <h1>Hi there</h1>\n    <p>The whole div is a link</p>\n    </div>\n</a>\nAnd you get:\n<div class=\"article\">\n<h1>Hi there</h1>\n<p>The whole div is a link</p>\n</div>\nThe link is gone.\nAnother part, from my original html example:\n<div class=\"col-md-6\">\n    <div class=\"my-gallery\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageGallery\" data-pswp-uid=\"1\">\n        <figure class=\"max600 btnlupa\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\">\n        <a href=\"http://www.example.com/version2/media/image-big1.jpg\" itemprop=\"contentUrl\" data-size=\"2000x1415\">\n        <div class=\"iconopeq iconolupa\"></div>\n        <img src=\"http://www.example.com/version2/media/image1.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" alt=\"Da\u00f1os de guerra en Pompeya\">\n         </a></figure>\n    </div>\n</div>\nIt is changed to:\n<div class=\"col-md-6\">\n<div class=\"my-gallery\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageGallery\" data-pswp-uid=\"1\">\n<figure class=\"max600 btnlupa\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\">\n<div class=\"iconopeq iconolupa\"></div>\n<a href=\"http://www.example.com/version2/media/image-big1.jpg\" itemprop=\"contentUrl\" data-size=\"2000x1415\"><img src=\"http://www.example.com/version2/media/image1.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" alt=\"Da&ntilde;os de guerra en Pompeya\" /></a></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\nHere the div with class \"iconopeq iconolupa\" has been moved subtly outside the a tag, and that provokes the javascript gallery won't open.. I had the same problem recently:\nhttps://github.com/directus/directus/issues/1770\nYou probably need to update the database schema.. Using git, run the following command:\n$ bin/directus db:upgrade\nhttps://docs.getdirectus.com/6.4.0/#Versions_&_Updating. ",

TinyMCE was replacing my URLs: I inserted absolute URLs to my Directus storage folder and TinyMCE rewrote these to relative URLs.\nI entered https://www.mydomain.com/directus/storage/... which was replaced by ../../storage/...\nAs I needed the URLs to remain absolute, I modified the file /app/core/interfaces/wysiwyg_full/interface.js by adding a fixed option convert_urls right above TinyMCE initialization (currently close to line 210 of interface.js):\njavascript\noptions.convert_urls = false;\ntinyMCE.init(options); // this line already exists - don't duplicate ;-)\nI'm aware this is only a workaround and would only survive Directus updates when using the Git based approach. \nMaybe the option could become selectable in Directus config somewhen in future?

    "chrisbenjamin": "Okay, I will tell you what I did and where I need some support.\nFirst: You was right, my mysql configration was not right. So I changed all necessary variables to utf8.\nThen I created within directus a new table and added an item. This was not working, because in the ROW of the text value, the collation was still latin1. \nWhat did the trick? I went into phpmyadmin and changed the collation of the row to \"utf8_general_ci\"\nI don't think that this preset collation depends on the local mySql configuration. What do you think?\nAnswering your post: You said \"we do set the connection charset default to utf8mb4 check the config file (api/config.php) DB_CHARSET constant.\" - This is right, but I was not able to change this to something else, because what I need is a different collation (additionally to the charset).\n. @WellingGuzman I have another feature recommendation/request. First: Thanks, this worked for me.\nBut my feature request would be something like this: \n- When you add an entry and this entry contains relational data (e.g. many to many, like above), this entry is stored. Let's say you have entry \"test\" with relational data e.g. sizes with ids 1 and 2\n- Now, assume you want to edit this entry. You want to select different sizes, e.g. 1 and 3 (deselected id 2)\n- What now happens is: sizes with ids 1 and 3 are added additionally to the database. ID 2 is still in there (ID 1 can be skipped with the \"no duplicates\"; but still resides within the database)\n- Okay, you could GET the entry, read the response, delete first with two requests the ids 1 and 2 and add then the new ids 1 and 3\nIn my opinion this is a real world example. Otherwise it wouldn't make much sense.\nOf course this belongs to a PUT (edit item) request.\nWhat do you think?\nHope the example was clear. If you wish I can open a new ticket for that.\nThanks. Same here. . @WellingGuzman I have updated my post and added your requested information. Please check section \"Steps to reproduce\" / \"Update 2 (16.09.2017)\".\nThis is really an annoying bug, because you are not able to create complex data structures. Could you please provide me your thoughts with which priority you will handle this? If you need more information, please let me know. -- Also I'll try to use the develop branch to reproduce this issue (Update: installed develop branch locally. Too buggy. The UI doesn't work propper). @WellingGuzman please check my updated post (Update 3). I have uploaded a new database dump - it's a complete database. just focus on the five tables X Region, X Trans Regioin, X Translation, X Word, X Word Trans.\nRegarding the develop-release: You can't see any items. The complete UI, where you expect your tabled data, is empty. But there are also a lot other bugs, like the get_directus_path() function, I will report separately when this bug is fixed. Sadly I am not able to finish my project because of this problem. Thanks for your help.. Where/How can I get the fix for that, @WellingGuzman ? \nNo I didn't test this on the develop branch. It's tested on an installation, based on the latest prebuild version of directus (this file) \nI will open a separate ticket for development branch bugs.\n. @WellingGuzman I can confirm that this bug is fixed in develop branch. Can you tell me when the version 6.4.3 will be released?. @WellingGuzman I tried again to reproduce this with a new develop download. \nThe error appears only, when you don't have a configuration.php. During the installation routine the script doesn't rename the sample file to configuration.php - After renaming it, it seems to work.\nlike in the prebuild release, the installation routine is buggy.

So I'm not sure why I'm getting this error in the Directus app logs: \n~~~\napi[server].ERROR: Directus\\Database\\Exception\\ConnectionFailedException: Failed to connect to the database in /var/www/html/src/core/Directus/Application/CoreServicesProvider.php:717\nStack trace:\n0 /var/www/html/vendor/pimple/pimple/src/Pimple/Container.php(118): Directus\\Application\\CoreServicesProvider->Directus\\Application{closure}\n1 /var/www/html/src/core/Directus/Container/Container.php(27): Pimple\\Container->offsetGet\n2 /var/www/html/src/core/Directus/Application/CoreServicesProvider.php(1059): Directus\\Container\\Container->get\n3 /var/www/html/vendor/pimple/pimple/src/Pimple/Container.php(118): Directus\\Application\\CoreServicesProvider->Directus\\Application{closure}\n4 /var/www/html/src/core/Directus/Container/Container.php(27): Pimple\\Container->offsetGet\n5 /var/www/html/src/helpers/settings.php(20): Directus\\Container\\Container->get\n6 /var/www/html/src/helpers/settings.php(35): Directus\\get_directus_settings\n7 /var/www/html/src/helpers/settings.php(130): Directus\\get_directus_setting\n8 /var/www/html/src/core/Directus/Application/Http/Middleware/ProxyMiddleware.php(16): Directus\\get_trusted_proxies\n9 [internal function]: Directus\\Application\\Http\\Middleware\\ProxyMiddleware->__invoke\n10 /var/www/html/vendor/slim/slim/Slim/DeferredCallable.php(43): call_user_func_array\n11 [internal function]: Slim\\DeferredCallable->__invoke\n12 /var/www/html/vendor/slim/slim/Slim/MiddlewareAwareTrait.php(70): call_user_func\n13 /var/www/html/vendor/akrabat/ip-address-middleware/src/IpAddress.php(113): Slim\\App->Slim{closure}\n14 [internal function]: RKA\\Middleware\\IpAddress->__invoke\n~~~\nIn tail -f /var/log/mysql/*.log\nI see \n~~~\n2019-02-01T23:06:54.285454Z 11 [Note] Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost'\n~~~\nYet when I connect with mysql -u root directus -h localhost and enter my password, this works just fine. I double checked api.php and this reflects the correct credentials.\nMy installation is at /var/www/html/ because this was the existing publicly hosted directory. When I git-cloned directus, I did it with a trailing . so there is no directus directory, all its contents are in /var/www/html/. I don't imagine this should be a problem though. My default.conf is set accordingly.\nI also saw this\n~~~\n2019-02-01T23:14:01.120146Z 0 [Warning] Failed to set up SSL because of the following SSL library error: SSL context is not usable without certificate and private key\n~~~\nCould this prevent the connection?\n. Edited /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf after following instructions at https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/creating-ssl-files-using-openssl.html\nI'm not sure if SSL is even required here.\nAlso tried https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/2197 and made the edits to the .htaccess file. Although I should point out there is no api directory in admin.\nWhen I went into the db directly, however, I saw this\n~~~\nmysql> select table_name,allow_view,group_id\n    ->        from directus_privileges\n    ->        where table_name='directus_files';\nERROR 1146 (42S02): Table 'directus.directus_privileges' doesn't exist\nmysql> select id,group from directus_users;\nERROR 1054 (42S22): Unknown column 'group' in 'field list'\nmysql> \n~~~\nSo that looks bad but not sure what exactly it implies.. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41645309/mysql-error-access-denied-for-user-rootlocalhost\nAlso, I finally got this to work by just dropping the database and recreating it. idk..

I think it should be based on the global configuration and not on the configured language of the current user. \nWould be quite confusing if the conversion acts different for different users. Additionally the slug would change, when a user with another language updates the entry. . No, unfortunately not. There's no file existing (directory is writeable). \nBut I will try it tomorrow on another system. . Sorry for the long delay. I've tried it now on my other system which has basically the same software running (same OS, same PHP version), but I cannot reproduce it here. \nMaybe I'll find something in the php error logs. Do you have any idea what could raise this error? . I think there's a little missunderstanding. The problem still exists on my desktop pc, I haven't solved it there. Only on my laptop it's running fine. \nI have put now a error_log right above the if-clause for debugging. Tthis leads to 139 entries to php's error log file from only one request (directus/login.php). I don't think that this should be called that often. Maybe a clean installation of directus will solve this problem.   \nEdit: \nClean installation solved the problem. Maybe there were some problems with the new directus version and the old database.  . Okay thanks, I didn't get that the values must be entered in the length field.. The dropdown value cannot be changed, it stays always on the old value.\n\n . This issue should be fixed at the current develop branch. https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/8075e93b769e0d556c306982dc28f67e20bce435\nThis is the related issue:\nhttps://github.com/directus/directus/issues/1921. I think this issue should help you: \nhttps://github.com/directus/directus/issues/1925. And the other way around, users cannot edit their own items, even when permissions for edit are set to allow edit own items. That was the missing point, thank you. :+1: \nMaybe a little hint above the permission table in the app would be helpful, @rijkvanzanten? . I've got no problems to allow users to signup / register.\n@lastlink Did you forget the rows at the end of the url? \nhttps://url/api/1.1/users/rows \nHave to say that i also allowed public users to view directus_users, don't know if this could be the problem, too. \nEdit: Adding the user to a particular group can be done with a filter, dont mind the top part of the function. I have used it to avoid users having the same first_name, because I'm using that field as nickname. \n```\n'table.insert.directus_users:before' => function($payload) {\n        // Check if first_name already existing\n        $users = \\Directus\\Database\\TableGatewayFactory::create('directus_users');\n        $user_exists = $users->findOneBy('first_name', $payload->get('first_name'));\n        if($user_exists) {\n          $message = \"Duplicate entry: \" . $payload->get('first_name');\n          throw new \\Directus\\Database\\Exception\\DuplicateEntryException($message);\n        }\n    $payload->set('group', 3); // user group\n    $payload->set('status', 2); // inactive\n    $payload->set('token', \\Directus\\Util\\StringUtils::randomString(32));\n\n    return $payload;\n  },\n\n```. Because that's how you create items:\nhttps://api.getdirectus.com/1.1/#Create_Item\nAnd the correct url is https://url/api/1.1/tables/directus_users/rows. That's the reason why I'm overwriting the group in the table.insert.directus_users:before filter.\nBut you're right, might be not the best solution. . The upper block in my code example is only a check, if an user with the same first_name already exists. Want to build a community based on directus and I'm using the first_name field for the nickname. And I don't want users to have the same nickname. \nSo in your case this is probably not necessary, you only need the last part of the function.\n```\n'table.insert.directus_users:before' => function($payload) {\n        $payload->set('group', 3); // user group\n        $payload->set('status', 2); // inactive\n        $payload->set('token', \\Directus\\Util\\StringUtils::randomString(32));\n    return $payload;\n  },\n\n```.

It works ! but more on the design topic, I do not see which field type can be empty, as an example, numbers and texts are automatically set to 'null' when they are empty.\nThat being said, thanks for your help :+1: . In deed, it seems you cannot have an empty value in any field type, maybe I did not see how to set the default value to 'empty' or the config button to switch between 'null' and 'empty'.\nThus the empty check seems currently useless.\n(As my company proxy disallows slack, I wanted to underline this point here).

This created instances where the edit view data had status set to \"1,\" or \"2,\", because it thought status was a multivalued field and was joining the actual value and an empty string by a comma. Switching the input a type of \"radio\" and hiding it via styling fixes the issue, so that only one \"status\" value gets serialized.. I'll give this one a shot.. Think I figured it out. The issue is in customs/extensions/_example/main.js\ngetMainView: function () {\n      if (!this.mainView) {\n        this.mainView = new MainView();\n        app.router.v.main.setView('#content', this.mainView);\n      }\n      return this.mainView;\n    },\nThe problem is that app.router.v.main.setView('#content', this.mainView); only gets called if there's no mainView. So if you \n\nNavigate to the extension\nNavigate to a table listing and/or edit view\nTry navigating to the extension.\n\nthis.mainView has already been initialized and app.router.v.main.setView('#content', this.mainView); doesn't get called. The fix for this is moving app.router.v.main.setView('#content', this.mainView); outside of the null check, like so\ngetMainView: function () {\n      if (!this.mainView) {\n        this.mainView = new MainView();\n      }\n      app.router.v.main.setView('#content', this.mainView);\n      return this.mainView;\n    },\nHowever, I'm wondering if the extension should really be the one responsible for setting the #content view. Seems like the extension should only need to worry about providing the view that goes inside the #content view and the app should worry about making sure the #content view gets updated when someone navigates to the extension. @rijkvanzanten what do you think?\n. @rijkvanzanten Perfect.

But then one morning, both me and another developer were unable to log in.  Similar problem to you - just sat there loading data.  The api kept working and the db was accessible (I had a phpmyadmin talking to it fine).  I had to leave it to work on something else and by the afternoon it appeared to resolve itself for both myself/other dev.  Really really odd.  :-/. Wait! this is still an issue - I've got a PR with a potential fix, but seems to not have resolution on the best solution.  I can understand that this may be a low priority bug, but I'd still like to fix it.  There is a bunch of comments on this in #2001, however no decision on if my PR can be merged.  Can someone throw some ideas at the PR?. I steered clear of toolbar_options, as I figured that was for native TinyMCE options, but happy to oblige if you think that's better.  Ultimately I see this being a stop gap solution until someone makes a decent image selector.. I'll double check the types, but based on the config in #1999, it looks like a bug.. Okay, the reason why this happens is due to this line:\n_.each(view.table.selection(), function (id) {\nAs it's just grabbing the table dom checked rows, grabbing the value from each row.  Being a dom element, we lose the type, so we just get a string.\nI guess the .selection method could perform the cast, but is there any situation where the value may be a non-number?\n```\n/app/core/table/table.view.js:\nselection: function() {\n  var selection = [];\n\n  this.$('td .js-select-row:checked').each(function () {\n    selection.push(this.value);\n  });\n\n  return selection;\n},\n\n``. hmm, shall I cast to string for comparison? either that or drop the === to ==, but that feels sloppy.. ping @rijkvanzanten @WellingGuzman any outcome to a solution to this? is m2m code used in the foreign language logic?  otherise I probably can swap it to forcing a comparison of strings?if (model.get('data').id.toString() === id.toString()) {`. From memory when I was debugging, I believe the issue is not in the api, but the fact it's coming from the dom id attribute.  It's always going to come back as a string, due to id's being strings. I considered casting it in that function (https://github.com/directus/directus/blob/6c0f8602cb53af4b6969a055b77f18113523a853/app/core/table/table.view.js#L67), but then that may break other checks that rely on it always returning strings.  Ultimately it needs to be cast somewhere.. ",
    "u12206050": "This should definitely be more clear, as I also have been sitting with this issue for a day now.. Ah thanks! Can't believe I missed that.. @WellingGuzman the bug itself isn't in Directus code, but in my case it happens when I compare a value coming from the client, which I sanitize as INT, and then comparing it, essentially '01234' !== 1234. At first I thought to fix it in our code but realized if someone expects a numeric random value of certain length, then it should be the correct length at all times and not shorten just because it gets cast as INT.. The fact of the matter is that you can create a field via directus and\nchoose it to be a random string and then furthermore choose if it should be\nnumeric, alphanumeric etc. So in the cast of numeric and for the sake of\nmany potential bugs because of this I strongly suggest to update the code\nto not generate numeric only random strings starting with a 0.\nOn Thu, 26 Apr 2018, 19:17 W.R.

True, but then randomString could just have a more generic name, but that would require some refactoring. I don't see the problem though with not having a 0 at the start of a \"randomString\" that is limited to only numeric characters.\n\nDo you mind explaining why you think we should allow, the randomString fn generating only numeric characters, to start with a '0', potentially leading to integrity issues as soon as any code down the line, tries to use it as a number or even trying to store it in the DB as a number field?. Yeh, at first I had some clever concat of numeric pool with alpha pool, and depending on upper or lower case just using php strtoupper() and strtolower, but this just seemed more straight forward for and simple.\n```\n        $numeric = '0123456789';\n        $loweralpha = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz';\n        $upperalpha = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ';\n        $pool = '';\n    if ($type !== 'alphanumeric') {\n        if (strpos($type, 'numeric') !== false) $pool .= $numeric;\n        if (strpos($type, 'loweralpha') !== false) $pool .= $loweralpha;\n        if (strpos($type, 'upperalpha') !== false) $pool .= $upperalpha;\n    } else $pool = $numeric . $loweralpha . $upperalpha;\n\n    return substr(str_shuffle(str_repeat($pool, $length)), 0, $length);\n\n```\nShould I update code to this?. done, tried to keep the switch statement to keep the code readable. @rijkvanzanten \n. Yes, you can test the example, when you navigate to the extension page, it loads the first time, but when you go to another page (a table for example) and then try and go back to the extension page the app.route.v.main.setView never runs since this.mainView already exists, and so you just get a blank page.. :) That is some pretty interesting piece of code :)\nFirst I use php date format to get the z (Day of the year), G (24 hour) and i (current minute) of the current date, but then I have to do some calculations on the day and hour so it is relative to minutes.\nSo in the end when the result is assigned to $minuteOfDay it is the current minute relative to the amount of minutes since the beginning of this year.\nIt can work without eval:\n$minuteOfDay = date('z')*1440 + date('G')*60 + date(i);.

I removed the row giving me issues from the table and took a mysql dump of that. Not particularly useful when trying to figure out what's wrong. Please find the mysql dump with the issue here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/6uclxutfv1mmb7z/backup.sql?dl=1\nI apologize for the inconvenience. I hope I didn't waste your time. \nLet me also elaborate a bit on the issue:\nOther than not being able to create a new row with a type of multiple files, I am also not able to view other rows that were created without the multi files type.\nI also noticed that the logs I posted earlier were incomplete.

sort value? Is it on the table I created (places), directus_activity or directus_files. \nHow do I add a default value to the sort? Is it through the directus UI or do I have to run some SQL?. Just to clarify, I am not joining any custom tables I created.\nI just want to add a 'multiple files' column to a table I created. In other words there is nothing custom, Ideally this should work out of the box as it is functionality provided by directus. \nPlease see a screen recording here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/4n1i73184s0c7sw/Directus_errors.mov?dl=0\nAs you can see from the video, I am able to save before adding this new column. But as soon as I add the multiple files column I am unable to save.. @jjbandit Thank you for your answer. I got it working.\n@WellingGuzman Thank you for the continued help.\nI was under the impression that the default values that were filled in after selecting \"Multiple files\" would create the correct relationship. \nSince I got it working I'm just curious at this point: how would one setup the relationship with directus_activity? Is it possible to change the default values so you don't have to change anything after selecting \"Multiple files\"?\nOnce again, thanks for creating directus, it's saved me several hours if not days of work!. ",
    "iKonrad": "I had a similar issue and it turned out that there wasn't a default value set for the 'sort' property which caused the insert query to fail. Maybe that's the case?\nBest thing to be 100% sure, is to copy the query in question and try to run it manually in MySQL.. ",
    "jjbandit": "I just ran into the exact same issue which was solved by adding a default value to the sort on the junction table, as suggested by @iKonrad . @Nicolaidavies You need to create a junction table - this is a third table that will act as a sort of glue between the directus_files and places tables you're attempting to join.  \nThis new table, let's call it files_places_junction, should have two columns, one for the numeric ID of the file record your joining, and one for the numeric ID of the places record your joining.  Adding the default sorting value (or presumably de-selecting sort when creating the table) should get you what you want.  . ",

(recommended)\n resize svg\n or generate a div wrapper with the needed size\nShow a fallback / default / placeholder image\nOr generate a png file from it. > can take longer to load\n\nEhm, SVG is very small in practice. Also bitmap images with many different colors are also quite big due to the compression algorithms.\n\nI believe the ideal approach will be using the thumbnail\n\nThere is currently no thumbnail. Generating a bitmap image from a SVG comes with several issues and drawbacks.\n\nplus may not be a squared dimension.\n\nAn image can be easily centered and used with object-fit. Generating a squared bitmap image from a SVG might be a bit tricky.. > My opinion is that we should use the raw SVG as the thumbnail (not generating a bitmap version). The SVG \"thumbnail\" would need to be contained/centered within the thumb dimensions (eg: 200x200) and should not exceed a max filesize (to avoid overloading the page with some crazy blueprint or something).\nRight.\n\nThe only issue I can think of is: do we copy the original file to the thumbs folder, or write SVG specific conditional to use the original for this mime type?\n\nThis is my current question boiled down.. > You are thinking about the web app only, having multiple files (listing page) can take up to loading all files slower, it can be small, but it can be huge, while is likely no matter how many colors or algorithm it uses the thumbnail (say jpg) are like to have a range or size.\n\nOkay now to the point of using the svg directly, remember this is a xml file, we can't tell what's inside of it. can this be used as attack or break the design? can you just write script inside a svg? My suggestion is: no svg, but an actual file if it's possible.\n\nNever saw big SVG files in the wild. Illustrator, Sketch and so on are good at compressing them when they export them for web.\nSVG can contain text and other things that can not be converted to bitmap images.. I might provide a PR when I find the time but it's good to add the help wanted badge in general as I am focusing on Foundation Sites at the moment =). webserver: Apache. Afaik we have mysqli enabled (it is in phpinfo and enabled).. We also do not use MAMP. We use Boxen + Apache. Not sure why this issue was closed then as this does not help so far. The php binary is available on the path.. Will check this in about an hour. This might be the issue. We should document this then as the other \"solution\" is too specific (MAMP, path) and a different issue imo.. shell\nwhich php\n/opt/boxen/phpenv/shims/php\nshell\nphp -m\n[PHP Modules]\n...\nmysqli\nmysqlnd\n....

At least it was not quite clear where we had to change something. Would be useful to change the sample config and add two lines for custom sockets which are not active by default.\nIs this specific usecase mentioned in the docs? If not then we should add and properly document it.. > The solution for me was to set the correct path to the mysqld.sock, but it was an awful way to find that out. It would be nice if you'd add the exception message in Bootstrap.php#L409, so users have a clue what's going wrong. There's DIRECTUS_ENV too, so maybe check for development first.\nThis was the right hint but not quite clear enough as we had to check which configs were used and where the socket was set.. ",
    "andrewliles": "To other users concerned about the SVG preview:\nIf your use of Directus involves a lot of SVGs then this may cause you a symptom of extreme slowness if you visit a table which attempts to show the thumbnail in the table row listing.  This is because (it would seem) the lack of a preview incurs a fresh attempt each time to generate a preview.  (The content returned to the browser is HTML).  \nAs I don't have the skills to complete the task of creating the SVG thumbnail (or merely returning not available placeholder), I have worked around the performance problem in the following way - I am writing this up here, in case it helps any others.\nI am proxying access to directus with nginx.  So in nginx I change the reverse proxy to cache the thumbnail URL pattern.  As images are immutable this seems like a safe approach and generally removes load from Directus.

I have solved the problem by doing a mysqldump in an ec2 instance and using that sql file to do an import into another database.\nDMS uses the least number of attributes to do a migration, so things like foreign keys aka nonprimary keys aren't migrated. Therefore, the AUTO_INCREMENT (used for the id primary key) isn't moved with the database, leaving AUTO_INCREMENT as NULL and preventing creation of any content (since it will try to increment the id but there will be no auto_increment capability in the ID, leaving the value at 0 instead of the right value (causing the Duplicate Value error to exist). This was said from an AWS representative:\n\nThe behavior you are observing is how DMS is designed. AWS DMS takes a minimalist approach and creates only those objects required to efficiently migrate the data. In other words, AWS DMS creates tables, primary keys, and in some cases unique indexes, but doesn't create any other objects that are not required to efficiently migrate the data from the source. For example, it doesn't create secondary indexes, non-primary key constraints, or data defaults. [1] That is why you were seeing missing AUTO_INCREMENT property on the fields associated.\nYou always have an option to create your Own schema at the target before starting the migration with DMS. With the DMS task setting, target preparation mode set to \"TRUNCATE\" or \"DO NOTHING\" you should be able to migrate the data with the schema created beforehand.\nFor homogeneous migrations, you can use native tools in order to create the target schema. For example, if you are trying to migrate from MySQL - MySQL you can do a MySQL schema dump and restore at the target.\nIn case of heterogeneous migrations, you can make use of Schema Conversion Tool [2] in order to generate the target schema.\n...\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Introduction.html\n[2] https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/SchemaConversionTool/\n[3] http://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-reset-auto-increment\n\nClosing this issue, as I found another solution for migration..

    "shoaibjdev": "@benhaynes @rijkvanzanten - I don't agree we can't get IP address of the user. Check the Activity Log, there we are getting exact ip addresses of the user's machine.

Even if we go with the theory that server's IP address is being returned when am trying to login, it should not allow me to login as in the whitelist I have added a specific IP address from which i'm not loging, so it should deny me not allow.\nExample:\nApp is deployed on a machine in my network with IP 192.168.99.1\nIn whitelist section for the Role I have entered IP 192.168.99.2 - This means I should only be able to login from machine with IP 192.168.99.2 in the network\nNow, I try login from a machine in my network with IP 192.168.99.3 - I'm able to login succesfully\nWhich proves that the code for whitelist is not working at all, assuming it's getting server's IP address instead of actual user's IP. So when I try to login from machine 192.168.99.3, App code is getting server IP address which is 192.168.99.1, which should not allow me to login as I have entered in the whitelist only IP 192.168.99.2\nKindly review the code for Whitelist as in my opinion there is no challenge with getting user's IP here.\n.

    "mattbisme": "I have given the DB user full read/write access. As for the version\u2026 I've been using the Installing the Directus Suite guide which asks me to use git:\ngit clone https://github.com/directus/directus.git\nJust prior to submitting this ticket I followed it once more. So, I presume it would be the latest (7.0.4). Is there an easy way for me to check? That said, I previously grabbed a manual download of the 7.0.3 (I think) ZIP'd release, but had the same issues. \nI've checked, double checked, and triple checked my DB credentials, tried various users and clean DBs\u2026 so I'm really not sure why Directus is being denied Read access.. Upon login, I immediately get the error. So, I guess that's \"past\" the login screen? How do I troubleshoot a directus_user permission?. I have checked those tables and found everything to match; it looks like my user has admin privilege. However, I do not have that admin menu in the bottom left either. All I have is this error message (attached). \n. That would be great, I really appreciate that. I imagine that you'll need the admin email/password as well?. I just created (yet another) fresh installation with the following user/password:\ndirectus@example.com / directus_test\nI figure it's probably better to keep everything \"the same\" as possible for testing anyway. Thanks for the help!\nGitHub didn't seem to like the size of the ZIP file, so I've uploaded it to Dropbox:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/xxjmn7lnidbgq0x/directus_test.zip?dl=0. I have tried your suggestion. I used my local IP as well as 127.0.0.1 (just to be thorough). I even tried switching to a socket connection. None of the options allowed me to login; I just see the same error.\nKeep in mind that I'm using MAMP Pro for my development environment, not Docker. Ultimately, it should be possible to run Directus v7 on either one, correct?. Well, I'm glad to hear that MAMP should work, at least. I've just checked the console per your suggestion, @rijkvanzanten. And wow, there seems to be a log going on there (I think the console is the only log I haven't looked at, at this point \ud83d\ude05).\nThe 403s confuse me a bit; that sounds like a directory permissions issue, but everything is set to 755 with the appropriate user that allows MAMP access. Per the installation guide, I set MAMP to use Apache to serve the public folder as the document root. Do I have that right?\nI'm not sure if a screenshot or a literal copy/paste is preferred, so I'll just include both:\n[Error] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found) (me, line 0)\n[Error] {code: 203, message: \"Item not found\", class: \"Directus\\\\Database\\\\Exception\\\\ItemNotFoundException\", file: \"/Users/mattbisme/Library/Mobile Documents/com~appl\u2026ectus/src/core/Directus/Services/ItemsService.php\", line: 106}\n    Dr (app.b28b6081.js:1:128869)\n    $emit (chunk-vendors.e8f6ed14.js:25:16426)\n    (anonymous function) (app.b28b6081.js:1:191067)\n    promiseReactionJob\n[Error] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 403 (Forbidden) (settings, line 0)\n[Error] {__ob__: Ae, \u2026}\n    (anonymous function) (app.b28b6081.js:1:130239)\n    promiseReactionJob\n[Error] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found) (me, line 0)\n[Error] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 403 (Forbidden) (collections, line 0)\n[Error] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 403 (Forbidden) (collection_presets, line 0)\n[Error] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 403 (Forbidden) (collection_presets, line 0)\n[Error] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 403 (Forbidden) (relations, line 0)\n[Error] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 401 (Unauthorized) (directus.test, line 0)\n[Error] Unhandled Promise Rejection: [object Object]\n    (anonymous function)\n    promiseReactionJob\n[Error] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 403 (Forbidden) (users, line 0)\n. I'm at a bit of a loss on how to troubleshoot this. The web console is claiming 404 missing files, yet @shealavington was able to run my installation in Docker. Console is also claiming 403 Forbidden, yet all of my directories are 755 and .php files are 644.\nThere must be something I'm missing?. My user does have a role of 1 in the DB. Changing how a connection is made to the database worked for @shealavington in Docker, but hasn't worked for me with MAMP. Is config/api.php the only location where these changes can be made? Should using 'host' => 'localhost' be the correct configuration for MAMP?\nOr, perhaps, am I approaching this entire problem from the wrong angle?. Well, I've gone through the paces on this one. Ultimately, I was unsuccessful, but I will provide as much feedback as possible about what I learned in hopes that this can get narrowed down. \n@benhaynes I have followed your steps verbatim, down to the hostname you used when troubleshooting this. With my latest testing, I'm convinced that the database connection has nothing to do with the errors. \nTo replicate Ben's steps, I switched from a database-specific user to the root user:\nphp\n    'database' => [\n        'type' => 'mysql',\n        'host' => 'localhost', // Also tested 127.0.0.1\n        'port' => 3306,\n        'name' => 'directus_test',\n        'username' => 'root',\n        'password' => 'root',\n        'engine' => 'InnoDB',\n        'charset' => 'utf8mb4',\n    ],\nI also made sure to test the root user with Sequel Pro:\n\nThis still gave me the same 403 errors from before. For science, I also tested deliberately using the incorrect password to see if I would get the same 403s. Instead I just got a Cannot connect to database below the login form when trying to login.\nThis backs up what @benlo123 pointed out about directus_activity being updated upon \"successful\" login. To be clear\u2026 it seems the actual login process is successful, but then various resources fail to load. \nIt may also be worth mentioning that I tried a socket connection as well (notice the missing host setting):\nphp\n    'database' => [\n        'type' => 'mysql',\n        'port' => 3306,\n        'name' => 'directus_test',\n        'username' => 'root',\n        'password' => 'root',\n        'engine' => 'InnoDB',\n        'charset' => 'utf8mb4',\n        'socket' => '/Applications/MAMP/tmp/mysql/mysql.sock',\n    ],\nThis, as you can see, is specific to MAMP, but a non-MAMP user may find their socket location specified in MySQL's my.cnf config file.\nAlthough Directus was willing to connect with this configuration, I still received the same 403 errors (and the like). So then I looked at 'charset' => 'utf8mb4' and started wondering about how my DB was setup.\nMAMP was configuring my databases with these defaults: InnoDB with utf8 encoding and utf8_general_ci collation. My database did not match the encoding specified in api.php! I created a database using utf8mb4 encoding and utf8mb4_unicode_ci collation, cloned a new copy of Directus, and then ran the Suite wizard again. Still no luck.\nTaking a look at the tables created by Directus, each was still using utf8 with utf8_general_ci. For science, I changed all of them to match the DB's utf8mb4 with utf8mb4_unicode_ci. Still no luck.\nAlthough, this did make me wonder\u2026 why does Directus's Install wizard use a utf8 table schema when api.php specifies utf8mb4?\nAfter all this, I figure there must be some environmental difference for me to be having these issues, right? Currently, I'm running:\nMAMP Pro v5.1.1 (MySQL 5.7.23, PHP 7.1.20, 7.2.8)\nmacOS Mojave 10.14\nI wouldn't expect OS to make a difference since MAMP is supposed to be \"sandboxed,\" but it's probably worth at least mentioning. I haven't had any issues with any other project at this point (including Directus v6 installations).\n@benhaynes What versions are you running? There can only be so many differences between our setups. I imagine the solution is hidden in those differences. \nThanks to everyone who has been providing me feedback so far!. Sure enough, my issues stem from what @rijkvanzanten mentioned specifically. MAMP's PHP can use Module Mode (all hosts use the same PHP version) or CGI Mode (hosts are assigned a PHP version). \nMy MAMP installation was set to CGI Mode; upon setting it to Module Mode, Directus allowed me to login! I did have to do a fresh install though. This was likely the difference between my installation and @benhaynes.\nI then switched back to CGI Mode, installed another fresh copy of Directus/DB, followed @shealavington's directions, and ran the wizard. Success again!\nI am interested to see how the security checks out with this fix. I can run in Module Mode for now, but CGI Mode would be preferable. Looking forward to the exciting conclusion!. @WellingGuzman I believe I found what you are looking for here: ~/Library/Application Support/appsolute/MAMP PRO/httpd.conf (not in templates, which was empty). For client confidentiality, I have removed all <VirtualHost> listings except the relevant local.debug.com host used to test Directus; the rest of the config file remains untouched (so hopefully I didn't miss anything else that should be redacted).\nhttpd.conf\n(Added \".txt\" to the filename so GitHub would allow the upload). @WellingGuzman So sorry for the late response; been a busy week. That said, I'm ready for more rounds of testing, starting with your last request:\nAdding SetEnvIfNoCase ^Authorization$ \"(.+)\" HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=$1 to the <VirtualHost> directive with a freshly cloned installation of Directus 7 did work! I also loaded var_dump($_SERVER) by itself in a separate file; the results were the same both with and without the SetEnvIfNoCase directive:\n[\"REDIRECT_HTTP_AUTHORIZATION\"] => string(0) \"\"\nWas there somewhere in particular that you wanted me to capture the $_SERVER dump? Or did you just want to make sure that REDIRECT_HTTP_AUTHORIZATION existed at all?. ",

Setup mamp env and remove port if set\n\n2.) git clone directus and install setup as written in the docs (have a look add the advanced links, regarding permissions and folders, eg.  the default ownership of MAMP htdocs is usally sudo chown -R <username>:admin /path/to/MAMP/htdocs/your-project\n3.) Adjust in API mysql socket configs.php, e.g like this:\nphp\n        'type' => 'mysql',\n        //'host' => 'localhost',\n        'port' => 8889,\n        'name' => 'test_directus',\n        'username' => 'root',\n        'password' => 'root',\n        'engine' => 'InnoDB',\n        'charset' => 'utf8mb4',\n        // When using unix socket to connect to the database the host attribute should be removed\n        //'socket' => '/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock',\n        'socket' => '/Applications/MAMP/tmp/mysql/mysql.sock'\n4.) Install DB and User like written here\nFinally, adding the correct mysql socket, adjust the virtual hosts as pointed out from @mattbisme or removing the ipv6 local loopback created by MAMP finally solved it on several machines.\nIn Genreral i think it is working with MAMP \ud83d\udc4d \nHope this can help to solves other setup problems.\nAnd also make shure not another apache is running ;) ... this was my problem with the ports, finallay the api worked aswell under mamp default ports :8888\nMaybe if you need fpm support adding  this to api public/.htacces could help (not tested):\nsh\nRewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}] # php-fpm support. and this could be quite important for this issue https://mampsupportforum.com/forums/latest/mamp-pro-disable-ipv6-mac-os-x. hey @alxv2016 sorry i have to say on a third setup it didn't work as described above by me. so it's not solved for MAMP as written.. I am not sure if see the entire scope of the issue but maybe to make the collection tree draggable and introduce a children array into data would be a possible solution.\nInsiration https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-draggable-nested-tree. Just some thoughts:\nA solution could be to make the master [READ ONLY] and a dev for contributions, CI Test, Composer based deploys or people who would like to have a strict composer deployment.\nI am not 100% sure but in that condition I think you are able to fork the directus/directus and set your forked master upstream to the remote dev branch. (I didn`t test it)\nTo deploy different environment stages i like the awesome https://github.com/deployphp\nYou can easily install composer (example below) and all needed dependencies (including your own) to set up a php project from scratch.\n```php\n<?php\nrequire 'vendor/deployer/deployer/recipe/common.php';\nenv('bin/composer', function () {\n    if (commandExist('composer')) {\n        $composer = run('which composer')->toString();\n    if (isVerbose()) {\n        writeln(\"Use global installed composer: \" . $composer);   \n    }\n}\nif (empty($composer)) {\n    run(\"cd {{release_path}} && curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | {{bin/php}}\");\n    $composer = '{{bin/php}} {{release_path}}/composer.phar';\n}\n\n$installYourPlugin= (has('installYourPlugin)) ? get('installYourPlugin') : true;\n\nif ($installYourPlugin) {\n    run(\"cd {{release_path}} && \".$composer.\" global require \\\"you/your-plugin:^1.0.0\\\"\");\n}\n\nreturn $composer;\n\n});\nenv('composer_options', function() {\n    $args = null;\n    if (has('ignorePlatformReqs')) {\n        $args = ' --ignore-platform-reqs';\n    }\n    return 'install --no-dev --verbose --prefer-dist --optimize-autoloader --no-progress --no-interaction' . $args;\n});\n```  \n. mmh yes can see your point @rijkvanzanten and yes maybe it might bring confusion a little bit.\nProbably a directus-composer or directus-dev repo would be more clear.\nbut honestly it confuses me a little bit more to have vendor and composer.json in one repo, due this could lead into different version if git clone git@github.com:directus/directus.git && composer install !== git clone git@github.com:directus/directus.git ... e.g. here https://github.com/directus/directus/pull/2291#issuecomment-458721714. mmh, ok thank you, i see, so it should completely independently, e.g as a pluggable zip file.\nBut if I compare composer.json and vendor/ it seems to be different.\n\nDo you think it is good to store composer.json and vendors in the same repo/application/plugin?. ok thank you @benhaynes for clarification and the link, interesting .... Curently you should be able to use mutliple Databases with one admin project by setting allowOtherApi = true\nhttps://github.com/directus/app/blob/master/public/config_example.js\nWell, the client would have to know the api  url and there wont be a dropdown with project names. \nI am not sure, but i think this solves your problem maily or? .

    "vzool": "Same issue here, I want to make PRs for this great idea.\nBut, I'm confused too \ud83d\ude15 . Aha, I thought it was using submodule to combine all these stuff together in Suite version. Something is missing in API version, I noticed that there is no any customs directory in the API.\nThere should be Hooks, Filters and many other things made specifically for the API and this directory does not exists in API repository. Why is that? \ud83d\ude25 . Hum \ud83e\udd14, if there is a PR will modify and add files/directory to extensions/custom, API Core and its composer.json in the same time. How can I do this while every single part in different corner? \ud83d\ude06 . @benhaynes OK, you mentioned that you just combine all these packages together in Suite without any \"unique code\". \ud83e\udd14 \nBut, I noticed there is inconsistency between these two repositories directus/api & directus/directus.\nFor instance, this place in API is out of sync for 6 months when compared to this one. \ud83d\ude15\nAnd this repository directus/directus is not for Read-Only as a mirror, it does accept PR all the time.\nSo, I think @AntiCZ question still remains solid to the ground! \ud83d\udc6eWhich repository is the main one? \ud83e\udd13. This is a good move. \ud83d\ude03\nConsistency always matters, a change of one char means a change for all the others. \ud83e\udd13\nBut, there is a better solution. \ud83e\udd14\nI suggest, if you just make this directus/directus repository as an interactive building script only to download and compile for the user what he/she needs, anyone can clone it and complete the producers as normal with a few extra steps, this will be so awesome. \ud83d\ude0d\nSomething like this:\n```shell\n\ndirectus install\n\n\nWhich version you want to download:\n1- Directus Suite (App & API).\n2- Directus App (Vue Application only / Front-End).\n3- Directus API (Core).\n\nSelect between(1, 2, 3): \n``\nThanks for this great idea folks \ud83d\ude18 . > I like that! But we'd lose the zip/tar ability for shared servers... and our precious \u2b50\ufe0f count ondirectus.directus` ;)\nI see, then you have two options here as I think:\n\n\nOption 1: Create a new branch installer , delete anything in it then push it to the repo and make it as the main and primary branch for the repo. So, you can start fresh again. And for the shared servers host last 10 versions as a maximum and keep track for it when you do a release. Finally add \"If you like our products, don't forget to star us\"\n\n\nOption 2: Create a new repo directus/installer.\n\n\nI prefer the second option \ud83d\ude06and I like this build branch idea @rijkvanzanten but try to keep everything up-to-date \ud83d\ude4f\ud83e\udd13 . > How complicated is this to build?\nNot so much if you found the right tools. I suggest to use laravel-zero. It is really easy and give us a nice and colorful command line in php \ud83d\ude0d \nEven though, it can compile anything into Phar format. \ud83e\udd13 . You still need to maintain the new branch as well as you do with the new repo,\nthis is prone to error and I feel it is a bad practice too. \ud83d\ude48\nI think if there are more than two branches in the same repo with different purposes, that is an indicator and a call for a new repo. I suggest to minimize the surface of error \ud83e\udd13. I think if you clarify how you do compile anything into directus/directus. So, any crazy bash guy can transform that into lovely code. \ud83e\udd13. > Thanks, guys :) I think is more clear to me.\n\nMy theses:\n\ndirectory: ./public/admin/ is directus/app\nevrything else is directus/api\n\nAm I right?\n\n@benhaynes No, I don't think so. My previous setup was easy and obvious which the version is this commit ab5a935, the structure of directories for directus/directus after commit 1c3fe10 has been changed dramatically without any notice. Before that I can setup a new app in seconds. But, now I'm facing many issues and this is one of them:\n\n\ud83d\ude15. > Yes, as we released the next major version ...\nAha I see\n\nI don't really agree.. We've been Tweeting about it ...\n\nI just joined your loop lately \ud83d\ude48\n\nThis is because you're trying to use Directus 7 with a Directus 6 installation ...\n\nStrange, I just follow the steps in the docs, is it up-to-date \ud83e\udd14. @rijkvanzanten I did give it another try hoping that I did installed the wrong version and it does install anything correct as the setup told me \"API Successfully Installed\", even I revised the database and it looks everything intact I guess.\n\nBut, when I tried to login the process fails with chunk of errors:\n\nHope these screenshots helps \ud83d\ude42. Aha, I did this testing on a Shared Hosting. Which they don't have options to change Apache settings. \ud83d\ude48. > The problem with having the token in the URL is that it will be logged (access_log, for example) ...\nSure it does, I suggest to notify the user about this when enabled this option.\n\"WARNING: Your Authentication token will be logged to access_log!!!\"\n\ninvalidate the cache on the API when the token change, meaning the url change (something that might be seen as an unexpected behavior) ...\n\nI guess if you add an extra random field with random value with every request, something like this:\nhttps://example.com/api/?access_token=Token&t=<Time-In-Micro-Seconds>\nThen, you will compete any cache mechanism. .

    "sebj54": "I had the same issue today too. After 2 hours of testing and reproducing the bug, I discovered this issue! \nI ended up with the same conclusions :)\nJust so you know, the column in the languages table (or whatever you called it) has to be name or you won't see labels in the select field. I named it in French before and I had the same issue.\n\nI figured it out by checking this blog post (now outdated): https://medium.com/directus/multilingual-content-setup-in-directus-i18n-4f243f72e554.\nAlso, in this blog post, we can see a gif of the translation field: \n\nIt looks like we can set a default language to be displayed when we edit or create a record, but I can't make it work. Each time I add a record, the translation field is disabled:\n\nI had to add a field to the table (useless in my case) so I can save the record. After saving, I can edit the record and use the translation field:\n\nBut, as you can see, there is a default option: --. How can we remove this default option? When I set a default value for the translation field, it is not saved and when I set a default value to the language code field of the associative table, it is not taken in account.\nLike said before, thanks for your support and your amazing work on this project :) \ud83d\udc4d . Thank you @rijkvanzanten! I finally had time to test this and I thought it was not working at the beginning but I recretaed all tables and forgot to add languages \ud83d\ude05 \nIt's perfect now! \nYour questions:\n\n\nI agree, it's not a very relevant information! According to me, it should display the number of translations filled (ie: 3/3, so we now all translations are filled for this item). \nIt could also display only one translation, based on the default language code we now can provide in the translation field configuration or the current user's language if available. \nIn my case, I will only have a translation field in many tables (those tables are only composed by an ID and a label actually). With this feature, I will be able to see all labels in my language at a glance!\n\n\nSure, it's complicated! I don't think I will use such a field, since I'm only displaying one language at a time in the current website I'm developing. I also think it will be the same for many websites or apps.\nThe only enhancement I could see would be to automatically create the associative table (items_translations) when the translations field is added. The associative table won't contain any text field at first, but at least it will contain the foreign key and the language code. \nAs this table will be hidden in many cases, I don't think field names are important.\n\n\nEDIT: Actually, I think such a feature would be necessary. As far as I know after my tests, there is no way to set a label on a many to many (maybe many to one also) field, linked to a table which only contains a translation field. \nActually, here is what is displayed:\n. We could keep the actual behavior (I guess just counting records on the association table) and just add languages count.\nThis is just changing the label but could be very helpful!\nI'm not sure about extending this behavior to all M2M relations. This could be unnecessary if the total count is huge. This could also be a performance issue on large tables, am I right?\nMaybe it can be optional? Enabled by default on a translation relation?\nWhat about the possibility to display a label for each record? For example, if I have a countries table, I'd like to display the translated name in my language like this: France, Spain, Germany. We already have the possibility to set a display template for M2M relations, maybe this template can be used for this feature? . > However, what language should it use to render the value? The current user's language?\nThat makes sense to me! If the language does not exist, it could use the default language set in the translation interface  . Same issue here! If someone has a workaround for the 7.0.6 version, I'm intersted :)\nI thought to use composer to install the missing dependency, but I can't found a composer.json file in the bundled repo :/\nEDIT:\nI finally achieved it without composer. It may be useful before the fix is released.\nHere are the steps:\n\nDelete the vendor/monolog/monolog folder\nGo the vendor/monolog folder\nExecute the following command: git clone https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog\nAdd the folowing lines to vendor/composer/autoload_static.php (I added them starting at line 1052):\n\nphp\n        'Monolog\\\\DateTimeImmutable' => __DIR__ . '/..' . '/monolog/monolog/src/Monolog/DateTimeImmutable.php',\n        'Monolog\\\\Handler\\\\Handler' => __DIR__ . '/..' .

'/monolog/monolog/src/Monolog/Handler/FormattableHandlerInterface.php',\nAfter that, I don't have any error, so it seems that it's just a dependency version problem.. Possible duplicate?\nhttps://github.com/directus/directus/issues/2238. Actually, I have the same behavior than him. I have nothing when hitting the public root and when I'm visiting admin, I am redirected to the login screen. \nI assume he didn't see errors because his server is configured to add them in a log file (my test server displays them because it's configured to do so). But maybe I'm wrong and it's a totally different problem! . Yes, sure, I know that. Maybe I didn't make myself clear: the issue is that he can't (and anyone can't I guess) access the installer. He and I talked about the admin route because this is the only thing accessible after cloning the repo.. @jameswill Maybe you can try this fix? https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/2238#issuecomment-437937471\n@shealavington I know it can be confusing! Would you want a video so you can follow the install process? \ud83d\ude04 I'll try to make it clearer now: \nThe fact is, when we are redirected to the admin login page, we don't have any credential to log in. The only thing we did before is cloning the repo (or directly downloading the release zip) and browsing the /public route like it is stated in the documentation: https://github.com/directus/docs/blob/master/install.md.\nI just figured out that there are 2 versions for the documentation:\nhttps://github.com/directus/docs/blob/master/install.md and https://docs.directus.io/app/admin/install.html#installation.\nThe first one indicates this method: \nsh\ngit clone https://github.com/directus/directus.git\nand the second one: \nsh\ngit clone -b build https://github.com/directus/app.git directus\ncd directus\nmv config_example.js config.js\nI did the first one on my installation and I had the same problem than @jameswill. Once I applied the fix I described in the other issue, I accessed the installer and was able to enter my DB credentials and configure Directus.\nI just tried the second method and then, I have an already configured Directus. It uses an external API (which I didn't want). By chance, I knew the credentials because I guessed it was the the same as on the demo. \nNow, I just don't know how to connect this instance to my local DB.\nI think there are two issues now: a problem with a dependency and a fragmented and incomplete documentation \ud83d\ude10 \n(BTW I'm pretty sure this issue is a duplicate now).

Thanks for your reply @shealavington I appreciate this could be a separate issue, but I'm still trying to get to the bottom of it. Your suggestion of composer install doesn't work with the build branch on API or the directus/directus prebuild version. They don't have a composer.json files. That step is supposed to already be done and by extension the /vendor folder should be up to date - which it appears not to be..

    "ybelenko": "Quote of @wing328:\n\nMyself and 40+ top contributors have decided to fork Swagger Codegen so as to maintain a community-driven version called OpenAPI Generator with a better governance structure to move the project forward. Now there are 10+ core team members and contributors with proper rights to merge PRs so I think we've better PR management in OpenAPI Generator. Please refer to the Q&A for the reasons behind the fork.\n\nRight now openapi-generator is in 4.0.0-beta version. That version contains a lot of new features, codegens and even more important breaking changes.\nI've created MySQL schema generator and I'm responsible for most of PHP Slim generator updates.\nYou can check difference of Slim generator output:\nhttps://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/tree/master/samples/server/petstore/php-slim\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/tree/master/samples/server/petstore/slim\nQuote of @wing328 again:\n\nIt's perfect time to try Openapi Generator and give us feedback so that the project team can incorporate your feedback into the 4.0.0 stable release.. Let's say that I'm skilled enough to install api and app repos. \n\n\nI still don't understand how to clone repos in one folder as soon as I need dasboard and API all together?\nIn most cases I need to write my own code(hooks, tests, extensions) and use version control. It means that I need to separate my code from Directus sources and sure, fork can handle that, but fork of what repo? It still requires from me to do git pull upsteam master and git rebase master over and over again.\n\nIt's bad that there is no option to install Directus as dependency, it's possible with WP, you can even find recommended .gitignore for WP projects.. > git clone https://github.com/directus/directus.git is enough\nIt doesn't contain composer.json, so I cannot add my own dependencies. I cannot add my own scripts to composer.json.\n\nit's possible with WP How?\n\nI used that package to install WP https://packagist.org/packages/johnpbloch/wordpress-core-installer\n\nWhat does it ignore?\n\nWhen WP is just a dependency installed out of vendor folder. Recommended .gitignore helps to hide all WP source files and track only changes in the theme folder, where user usually adds his implementation.\nIn other words, when I fork Directus repo, I want to enhance or change core source code, submit a PR maybe. But when I want to add just config and hooks it isn't a fork.. So, will directus/directus repo include composer.json? Or I should clone api and app repos in one folder somehow if I need that file? I'm 100% sure that I need it.\nWhat I found related to topic yesterday:\nYou should choose composer package type which most fits for you. The composer.json schema - Type\nSetting up and using custom installers - guide describes how to convert composer library into installer which downloads dependencies into folder outside of vendor when required. And what is more important you can extend Composer\\Installer\\LibraryInstaller class to do actions on package install(run SQL queries to setup database for instance, check PHP version and required extensions), on uninstall etc.\nAlso I found this package composer/installers. If I understand the purpose of this package correct, you can give an option for Directus plugin/extensions creators to install plugin by simple composer require extension-author/directus-awesome-extension. Anyway, somebody with native english can check this out, I'm not sure that I understand it correct. This package provided by Composer creators, so I would say that it's official solution.\n. ",
    "josdea": "@benhaynes , You might also check the \"learn more\" links from the collection creation screen under \"managed\", \"hidden\", and \"single\". ",
    "rw3iss": "@rijkvanzanten Yeah, basically. Not sure what you have in mind, and sounds like it'd be fine, however, I would also like to see this sort of \"easy\" ability to define a field type as some other data type (ie. just changing the Collection's add/edit field modal to show Collections as choices, if some setting of them allows it), otherwise I'm not sure what you might have in mind for defining the relationships automatically.\nInitial impressions cause me to think that it wouldn't require any large overhaul of the backend/API, with a bit of massaging of the App frontend:\n-add Collections as Field Types (if their settings allow it, by default yes), which show in the field add/edit dialog.\n-maybe ask user to customize which fields to show (or even fetch automatically upon querying?) from this collection, in the relationship (by default, initial implementation should just show all fields for now?)\nI think the smoothest/most intuitive frontend change for editing the collection would be to show the field selection with Collections as choices, but then there should also just be a simple checkbox that asks if it is singular, or supports multiple item selection... \nWhen editing an item, I think the custom field type would automatically show as it currently does (ie. 'add new/select existing table'), since I think it's the same kind of relationship setup in the backend, so I think the only semi-major refactoring is the field add/edit modal for a collection, and the backend API logic to automatically setup the relationships based on the fields and types it sees, maybe.. Guess I should also mention another problem currently seems to be some bugginess with defining relationships, and then changing some of them. I have seen it multiple times in working with relationships the past few days. If I do things like remove entire related fields, I don't see the changes picked up in the DB in some cases, and get console errors even if the fields are there with seemingly correct names, or will tell the collection to not display the related column on detail/browse, but will still see it, have to delete the column all together and recreate, etc. Sure, I know I should be careful in doing this, and am, but the whole app shouldn't bug out so much in these cases, instead should guide the user or fallback somehow.

    "SharkWipf": "@shealavington As per the linked docs: \nA Page is made up of at least two core files. You can create a page from scratch or use the included page extension demo. Simply remove the prepended underscore (_) to enable the demo.\nThe format of the linked _demo folder is different than the _demo folder in directus/directus, and copying the demo folder from the documentation/API repo over to the directus/directus instance behaves as I've explained above, it doesn't display anything and the console throws 2 404s, for the seemingly undocumented and unformatted page.js and page.css files the directus/directus application looks for.. On closer inspection, it does seem that, when checking out by tag, all tags of version 2.0.0 and above seem to have the same structure as the directus/directus repo.\nSo then this becomes an outdated documentation issue and should probably be moved to the documentation repo.\n@shealavington thanks for pointing out the tag issue, I assumed that since directus/directus and directus/documentation were using the master repo, so would the directus/api repo.\nI'll close this issue here now and open a new issue in the documentation repo..

    "wondergryphon": "Perhaps some inspiration could be taken from how WordPress handles the databases for its multi-site setup: where each DB gets a numbered prefix, relating to the ID of the child site.\nSo the core install is wp_0_, then the second site would be wp_1_ etc. We could take some inspiration from how Slack does their sign-in: Where you first enter your Slack instance subdomain, and then login. \nI'm sure when creating sub-projects on my Directus instance, I would specify a project name? Maybe this name could be used when signing in.\nLogin could either be a 2-step process like Slack does it - first capturing the project name, and then logging in - or you could simply specify your install name along with your email & password and login in a single step.\nThat way, other projects on a Directus install would be kept private.. Awesome @rijkvanzanten :) \nI realise that this might require managing a unique table of users, in order to know which user is 'super admin' (and has access to all sites), but how about:\nLogin Scenario - Single project user\nhttps://mywebsite.com/public/admin/#/login - Login form is updated to allow user to type in their project name. This would log them into their unique project:\n\nOnce logged in, they would see their unique project and nothing else.\nLogin Scenario - Super Admin\nConfig files allow you to specify your (super admin) email address. https://mywebsite.com/public/admin/#/login?super - A unique url parameter removes the project name field, and attempts to do the login of that super user.\nOnce logged in, the admin can show a 'site switcher' that will be a drop down of all projects for easy & quick switching between instances.\n\nJust a thought \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0a. Makes perfect sense @benhaynes. \nAgain, I think WordPress Multisite handles this well: When a super-admin creates a new sub-site, they're automatically made an admin user of that site too. This would give them write-level access to that sub-site and let them administer it.\nSo their super-admin abilities let them quickly switch between sites, and then as admin of each site they switch to, they're also able to CRUD.\nFeasible?. Yeah the WP system has a table for sites/blogs IIRC, and it lists USER ID's, and the blog/site ID's that they are a part of (because they handle multiple users, being part of multiple sites too). The more we talk, the more having a new table to manage this, makes sense in the long run :) \n@rijkvanzanten also mentioned storing site/project meta, which I think is a great idea.\nMight also be a good idea to include in the config files, a boolean for if an install is meant to be a multi-site instance, or a single-site instance. This way, the GUI can stay as-is for single-site instances and only show all this extra stuff, to users who are intending to use their instance in that way?. ",
