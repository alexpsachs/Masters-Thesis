I have just merged in a fix from Tanner re horizontal scroll and header lag. It solves the problem for me on android device. It was never a problem for my desktop. So now all devices work for me.

Hi Ppneo, this feature isn't in yet, on my to do list. However the grid can handle very large data sets (tested up to 100k rows), why do you need pagination, why not load everything into the GUI and allow user to filter?\n. lazy loading of rows based on scroll wasn't something i had in mind, grid doesn't support it :( . . . . but am curious what the use case is for paging - if your report has more than 1000 rows, then the user is not going to go through each row of the report, typically they would filter / search / aggregate (either in the client or the server). my gut feeling is paging is from old-style applications, where you couldn't handle large data sets in the client. one of the strong points of angular grid is you can manage large datasets, and filter / aggregate you way through it!\n. it's coming it's coming!!!\n. Yeay!!!! At least one other person agrees with me!!!! Thanks Nelreina!!\n\nUnfortunately (for me!!)

Thanks for raising the bug. :)\n. Thanks @vitvad, testing is deffo on my plan. However I've purposely left it aside for the first few iterations, it's my style of programming, as the grid is constantly undergoing major re-designs and re-factorings. Once the design has settled down, I'll be introducing tests. Thanks also for the pointers, I'll check all those out.\n. closing this issue as whether we use tests or not is a project decision, not an issue with the codebase :). Thanks for raising the bug. I don't think this is possible to fix with the design (would be delighted if anyone can disagree - and let me know how to do it if I'm wrong). The scrolling window is on the main body only (does not include the pinned columns). The only way to get 'scroll' events from the pinned columns or the header (eg mouse wheel or touch-screen drag), would be to make these panels scrollable also - but doing so, in the browsers, introduces scroll-bars, which looks wrong (would mean two sets of scrollbars).\n. sounds like a plan, i'll give it a shot\n.

It's a given I will put this in at some point as some people will consider this as an 'expected feature' of a grid. However I agree with you, it's easy to put this into your application outside of the grid - and that's what I've done in the past with other grids, as older browsers need the servers help with exports.\n. Shouldn't be the grids responsibility - i agree here - however not everyone\nwould agree - and it can be seen as a basic requirement for a grid.

I had a quick play, you can change the height of the cells, use colDef.cellStyle. See below. Basically increase the height of the cell you want to span more than one row, and set to zero the one you want to remove.\ncolDef {\n    cellStyle: function(params) {\n        if ( isThisARowIWantToExpand(params.data)) {\n            return {'height', '50px'};\n        if ( isThisARowIWantToShrink(params.data)) {\n            return {'height', '0px'};\n        } else {\n            return null;\n        }\n    },\n    // other cold def stuff here\n}\n. am closing this issue as a) not a lot of interest around it, b) putting something in would be a large amount of effort, for little gain (given not many people have asked for it) and c) there is a workaround as described above :)\n. mixed feeling about this - typically i would just set the list of columns\nagain as mentioned above.\ndoes this imply a gui for selecting columns to show also?\nOn 19 April 2015 at 05:40, Tanner Linsley notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nmaybe an active property on the colDef?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/angular-grid/issues/23#issuecomment-94234916.\n\n\n\nThe information transmitted is intended only for the person or entity to\nwhich it is addressed and may contain confidential and/or privileged\nmaterial.

Yes I'll put that in in time.\n\nHowever you can still achieve this, by providing your own cell renderer.

Thanks @greglockwood , I'll get that fixed. :)\nFunny, everyone filters for Sophie . . . . .\nOne person brought to my attention I only have girls names, I had no idea!!!! (wasn't intentional)\n. Yes for both questions.\nIf you want the button to be an AngularJS one, do the following:\n```\n// set in grid options\ngridOptions.angularCompileRows = true;\n// set in the colDef\ncolDef.cellRenderer = function(params)  {\n    return 'Expand All';\n}\n```\nIn short, enable Angular compiling of rows. Then in the HTML you turn back, do whatever AngularJS you want. For each row, the table creates a new scope and inserts the data for the row into that scope. So the method on the scope will receive which data to work on.\nThere is a full example of this in the docs here:\nhttp://www.angulargrid.com/angular-grid-angular-compiling/index.php\n. @kedomonzter the cells don't use angular compiling in ng2. so you will have to put the logic in using standard jaascript, or you have to do the angular 2 compiling yourself.\n. fyi - we are trying to get ng2 bindings working with ag-grid. we are finding it very difficult how to work with ng2 at this level.\n. Thanks @danseid. There is a fair amount of work to a pinned 'section' and it's a rare requirement in my experience for both the left and the right. So have put this on the 'nice to have' list.

You analysis is correct. It was a 'rough and ready' first pass on the\nscrolling and pinned columns. When a scroll bar is in the main body, then\nthe pinned body gets cut by the scrollbar height. The scroll height is\nhard-coded to what looked best on my Chrome & Windows, so I need to come up\nwith a way that measures the scroll width in the running platform. However\nhave you found something else wrong outside of this? (ie no scroll bars in\nbody, but sill pinned column clipped?) - if so, please explain how to\nrecreate.

The feature is called \"Master / Slave Grids\" and can be used to provide floating footers. I've given an example of floating footers also. Will be in the next release, or you can get / build the latest yourself.\n. @a497988 i did a release last weekend.\n. just checked and it's working for me. i went to the online example with chrome, IE and firefox (all windows 8). \n. the master / slave is meant for so much more than just footers - that's just one application of them. i intend going back and adding headers and footers as a separate feature. but because master / slave allows footers (albeit, as you say, with to much coding required), the pressure is off me to provide the nice easy footers.\n\nhow would i go about updating the footer summaries when filters are applied\n\ngridOptions.modelUpdated -  Function callback, gets called when displayed rows have changed. Happens following sort, filter or tree expand / collapse events.\n\nwhat's the best way to rebuild the grid when the groups change?\n\nif your changing the gridOptions.groupKeys, then you need to call onNewRows()\nor you can use the columnController (undocumented right now, intend making it public this weekend), something link this:\nvar columnController = gridOptions.api.getColumnController();\nvar columns = columnController.getAllColumns();\nvar col = getTheColWeWantToPivotBy(columns);\ncolumnController.addPivotColumn(col);\nthe grid listens for change events on the column controller and will rebuild when it gets the event of a pivot change.\n.

So I can't compare them, but\ngiven I use SASS, that would be my preference. My reason for holding back\nis I'm trying to minimise the complexity of the project. Although I use\nSASS and am comfortable with it, not everyone is / does, so bringing in\nanother layer to the stack make the project less maintainable by some -\nespecially those who have arrived at JS development from traditional\napplication development (vs those who have come from creating websites).\nRe the comments on style reuse - currently the styles are split into core\n(always used) and theme (selected by user). So css styles that are part of\nthe operation of the grid are in core, so the themes don't need to be aware\noff and repeat the core styling (not sure this is styling really, it's more\nthe skeleton layout of the grid). Was this what your were referring to as\nthe reusable parts?\nIf interested in the pull request, think Tanner has his eyes on this one!!!\nBut sure!! However it will be easier in a week or two when I get everything\nmoved over to gulp. Maybe my concern over 'making it difficult for non-css\npeople' can be eased by making sure we heavily inlne-comment the scss files\nand extend the documentation to cover this.\nOn 11 April 2015 at 17:29, David Geary notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI've been thinking the same about implementing this for the CSS.\nFirstly, it's not that the styles are particularly complicated, but\nproviding/maintaining predefined themes will definitely be simplified with\nthe use of a preprocessor since each would just become a set of variables\nsetting the required colours, etc, rather than needing to duplicate each of\nthe related rules. This, in turn, means that the rules are only defined\nonce, so updating them doesn't need each theme to be changed separately.\nMore significantly though, I think it would make it much easier for\ndevelopers to integrate the grid into a project that uses SASS/LESS.\nCurrently, you must manually copy and edit the grid styles to match your\nproject (a process that then has to be repeated whenever the grid's styles\nare changed). With SASS/LESS, you don't care about the rules themselves -\nas long as all the significant values have been declared as variables, you\nwill only need to update the variables to match. Upgrading to a new version\nthen just needs you to check what variables have been added/removed.\nOf course, whichever one you go with, someone will want you to implement\nthe other one. But I think implementing both is overkill. Personally, I've\nused both SASS and LESS, but prefer SASS, so will probably have a go at\nconverting it anyway (though I'm no expert).

Thanks for the suggestion. The plan in my mind for fitting the columns is\nas follows:\n+) Keep it separate to the process of setting up the columns.\n+) Have an API method that the client can call to auto-fix the columns into\nthe grid.\n+) This API will see what cols are present, how much size is left /\noverflowed, then size each col accordingly.\nSo if 300px is leftover, it would add the 300px to the columns in a ratio\nequal to the current columns size.\nThat way, the user would call this method after the cols are set into the\ngrid, or after the data is set in (as the data can change the width,\ndepending on whether there are scroll bars or now).\nHope this makes sense!\nThanks,\nNiall.\nOn 13 April 2015 at 17:02, Billy Kirk notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n\nYou can view, comment on, or merge this pull request online at:\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/angular-grid/pull/56\nCommit Summary\n- Auto column width based on overall grid width\nFile Changes\n- M src/angularGrid.js\n  https://github.com/ceolter/angular-grid/pull/56/files#diff-0 (3)\n- M src/colModel.js\n  https://github.com/ceolter/angular-grid/pull/56/files#diff-1 (16)\n- M src/constants.js\n  https://github.com/ceolter/angular-grid/pull/56/files#diff-2 (1)\n- M website/dist/angularGrid-latest.js\n  https://github.com/ceolter/angular-grid/pull/56/files#diff-3 (20)\nPatch Links:\n- https://github.com/ceolter/angular-grid/pull/56.patch\n- https://github.com/ceolter/angular-grid/pull/56.diff\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/angular-grid/pull/56.\n\n\n\nThe information transmitted is intended only for the person or entity to\nwhich it is addressed and may contain confidential and/or privileged\nmaterial.

(especially the first one)\nI've just fixed these two and checked them in. Thanks for pointing them out.\nRegarding the selection by node query - the reason for using the node, and\nnot the data, for selection, is when you get into groups, there is no data\nequivalent for the group row. Another reason is that the grid is not\ndependent on any key within the data (where as the node has an id) - which\nis needed for selection - as object equality cannot be used when paging /\nvirtual scrolling as the row may exist many times as the page in question\nis reloaded. And then don't forget that not all rows will have an index, if\nthe row is within a group that is now expanded.\nI'd prefer keeping the selection node focused underneath the hood. If we\nhad the lookup of node based on index, and index based on node, wouldn't\nthat solve your problem???

Hope this info helps you out!\n. 1. deselect row is implemented. Now, if gridOptions.rowDeselection=true, you can deselect rows with ctrl+click.\n2. New callback for iterating through each row in memory. See the selection documentation example using forEachInMemory.\nConverting between nodes and indexes is just messy, because as mentioned above, not every row has an index (due to grouping and pagination). Using forEachInMemory I believe will solve your problems. So am closing this issue!\nAll above I'll be releasing in 1.7.0 later today.\n.

Hi Tanner,\n\nNo performance on the grid side. Just from a client point of view it\ndoesn't make sense to me.

Fair point. OK I agree with you!!\n\nDo you want to raise an issue?\nThe implementation I would go for though would not use an AngularJS\npromise, or any other promise library, as I'd want to limit dependencies\nhere - so would provide a simplified promise pattern (similar to the\ncallbacks in the pagination datasource). That way the client could use a\npromise, but handle the promise itself, calling the grid provided callbacks\nwhen the result comes back. That way it sticks with the plan of \"limit\nexpose to AngularJS\", allowing easy porting to Angular 2, Web Components,\nany future web frameworks.\nOn 17 April 2015 at 22:34, Tanner Linsley notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nYes.

Thanks Paul\n. Had some conflicts with merge. Three files I edited in master were deleted in PR (although the changes I made were in the equivalent files in the PR so nothing was lost).

That's not a bug, the grid options needs to be present on the scope when the grid is created. The correct thing to do, if you don't have the grid ready, is to either a) create an empty gridOptions or b) put a ng-if on the grid div, that way, angular will not create the directive until after your data is ready.\n\neg of B is:\n<div angular-grid='gridOptions' ng-if='gridOptions'></div>\n. all i can say is there must be something wrong in your code. the gridOptions defiantly gets the api and columnApi attached to it - otherwise the thousands of people using the grid would be complaining.\n. Thanks Sunil\n. yes that's right, my plan is to do exactly that. there is a chunk of coding i need to get it in, but it's on my list.\n. only way currently is to implement this outside of the grid. when a new sort or filter is applied, then call onNewDatasource (you don't have to provide a new one, just pretend to the grid that it has changed). The datasource should then refer to the external sort / filter that was selected.\n. do you have 'angularCompileRows=true' set in the gridOptions?\n. Great you got it sorted!! To be honest, I had very little to go on with the above!\n. interesting idea. as more people use, am sure more people will be asking the same newbie questions. i was thinking of having the angularCompile the other way around - have it on by default, and property to turn it off. or just provide a FAQ section, that would be the top question in the FAQ!!\n. Hadn't really thought about the impact of the grid using an isolated scope.\nI can appreciate people would want it non-isolated. Or maybe have that as\nan option. Especially given Angular Grid doesn't put anything into the\nscope, so won't dirty it.\nWhat does ng-grid do?\nOn 22 April 2015 at 12:50, vinnytheviking notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nPersonally I like the fact that it's off by default.

I can't win them all.

It will keep merge hell from happening.\nOn Sat, Apr 25, 2015 at 4:31 PM Niall Crosby notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nhi Tanner\nthe for loop like this: (var i = -1; ++i < columns.length;)\ngoes against what's in the code elsewhere ie: (var i = 0;\ni<columns.length; i++)\nsecond one i find more readable, easier to know what's going on (i\nprefer\nreadable code over funky code). any reason to have it the way you have?\nalso, i'd rather (i!==0) over (!i) as the former is more readable (it\nreads as it means, whereas the !i depends on how javascript casts ints\nto\nbooleans, hence doesn't read as well).\nlast question, using the transform instead of positioning, how much of a\ndifference is this making for you performance wise? does it solve the\nproblem completely, or just help a little?\nand i lie, one more question!! i have been working on a branch, and have\nalso done some refactoring in the scroll area. what is the process i\nshould\nbe following? if i merge my branch in first, do i then ask you to\ncreate a\nnew pull request as the current one will have conflicts?\nthanks :)\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n<https://github.com/ceolter/angular-grid/pull/94#issuecomment-96288794\n.\n\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/angular-grid/pull/94#issuecomment-96290178.\n\n\n\nThe information transmitted is intended only for the person or entity to\nwhich it is addressed and may contain confidential and/or privileged\nmaterial.

In latest release.\n. this is very strange, nobody else has reported this, given lots of safari users, i'm surprised. it's working for me on safari on windows. anyone else seeing this behavior?\nbtw - what version are you using? latest release (1.4) or latest from master? (there were some changes in this area just yesterday after the release was done)\n. i've just fixed this and checked in. an improvement we introduced doesn't work on all browsers. latest in master has it working again.\n. trouble merging . . . 5 min\n. ok fix is in now \n. what's your time frame? and can you do the sorting outside the table as a workaroun while your waiting? (eg put a select (drop down) outside the grid with the columns you can sort by, that your datasoruce uses) . . . just as a temporary solution?\n. oh - i've an idea - you could provide your own header renderer? so don't use the sorting from the grid at all. then just code it up yourself?\n. yea your idea will work also, but you will still need to render the sort icon, so am thinking header renderer is better option.\n. interesting proposal. i think this needs to at least be an option (as my preference is to no show the icon). also could leave to both filter & sort icons showing on hover (and click filter to filter, sort to sort, and menu for everything else). also need to consider how it all works on touch devices.\n. this is already implemented. closing the issue.\nsee year column in the first example on this page:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/angular-grid-sorting/index.php\n. Template for header, or something similar, sounds good to me.\n. yes\n. header templates were released a few months ago.\n. Hi there, you cant use % for widths, only pixel widths. Not sure why you would want to to do this, maybe explain why you want this? PS This is a question, not an issue with the grid, so am closing the issue :) Any followup - can you put on the bulletin board please? thanks again!!\n. this is not an issue, it's a question!!!! best place for questions is the bulletin board :) so i'll close this issue off!!\nto get the grid to show the header in two or more lies, yes you should use a header cell renderer. in this you can return back a div, and inside the div, have whatever structure you want. you will also need to set the head height (in grid options) so whatever height makes sense for you.\nwith regards updating the header when you resize, there is no callback for that, so you will have to have your header dynamically fit the available space.\n. yup, i'll updated the original post.\n. i now compile the columns individually, if we also compiled the row, then the columns get compiled twice.\ni could rework how it's done, however that would be aligning the grid with angular 1 - which i don't want to do.\nsuggestion - use processRowPostCreate callback to add whatever it is you need to the dom.\nthen use virtualRowRemoved event for any cleanup for when row is removed.\ni would advise against using angular though if adding classes or events to the row, otherwise you have to introduce angular compiling youself and that's more tricky than just using native DOM for small items.\n. you can use callback processRowPostCreate to add functionality to rows.. thanks for raising. this is a dupe :)\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/angular-grid/issues/14\n. #14 is open!!\n. today's release has customisable loading panel.\n. Can you suggest what you mean by that please?\n. Thanks for the explanation, that makes sense to me.\n. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-43. just finished rewriting how tree data works. next release has new implementation that includes delta updates and also searching at all levels (groups and leafs). the down side is that it's an enterprise feature (it reuses the grouping logic which is an enterprise modules). the old tree data is still included, however the good stuff is with the new tree data now. we plan to release in the coming days.. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-44. Thanks for raising. Will fix when back from hols.\n. now fixed\n. Thanks for raising. Will fix when back from hols.\n. fixed in the branch 'selection' . . . . will be merging into master in the next few days.\nnow, when no rows, call: callbackSuccess([], 0)\nie pass in empty array (empty rows for this page) and zero (for last row index)\n. Fair point. Will improve to group on enbedded values, or maybe I create a 'getGroupKey' callback for maximum flexibility.\n. no workarounds, unless you want to hack it. :(\n. Not yet, it's on my 'to do' list.\nOn 27 May 2015 16:27, \"vivektodi\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nCan I use grouping when I make use of Value Getters?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/angular-grid/issues/114#issuecomment-105958235\n.\n. fixed in master. will be in next release.\n. no. cellrenderers should not be used.\n\ncellRenderers are for the rendering process, drawing on the screen.\nthe grouping operation is a stage that takes place before the cells are rendered.\n.

Fixed width cols for 'size to fit' - add 'suppressSizeToFit' to column definition to have the column width not change during the 'size to fit' operation.\n. thanks for the PR @pinnacleag-dev  . . . . have had a look and looks nice. however a) i want to think about this for a while and i'm very busy this week (just back from holidays and work are sending me off-site in the morning, so will have little time to myself and b) i want to make sure the solution is generic enough to cater for other scenarios, as am afraid it might be to specific to your scenario only. thanks :)\n. ok i merged this in, so @pinnacleag-dev you are registered as a contributor!! but then in rewrote it in a different way. now, if you mark a column with suppressSizeToFit, it doesn't partake in the resize. this is more generic than your proposal, covers more scenarios!!\n. for cell content, use the cell styling as outlined in the docs.\nfor fitting the grid, are you trying to do something like the demo, ie have it fill width and height, but leave a gap on the top for a header panel???\nps going to close this as it's not an issue, it's a question, it should be on the web bulletin page!!\n. yup, something i haven't gotten around to. the value getters should be used here when creating the quick filter text.\n. i just checked in a fix. i didn't test it at all - i just saw your comment looking for a hack fix, so i check in a hack fix :)\nclass: InMemoryRowController\nmethod: aggregateRowForQuickFilter\ni haven't done a build, so to get this fix, take latest from trunk and build\n. i just gave it a quick once over, and is working for me. maybe something specific to your setup. can you tell me the error you are getting?\n. ok i think i know what the problem might of been - i was setting the style with 'padding-top' where it should be 'paddingTop'.\ni've check the change in - but i can't test it. can someone test where this was an issue?\neither grab the latest, or in your code, search for 'padding-top' and 'padding-bottom' and replace with 'paddingTop' and 'paddingBottom'\nthanks,\n. i believe this is now working.\n. sorting in groups is now supported, i should of closed this issue.\nsee bottom of page:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-sorting/index.php\nif you want to sort in any other way, then provide your own colDef.comparator\n. The built in grouping feature is intended to be used as is. If you want more specific grouping functionality, then that's where you would have to create the groups yourself. This is what the FileBrowser demo does. My plan was, provide a quick and easy 'default' grouping feature, but for anything more bespoke, you would have to implement it yourself. I don't want to extend what's currently there as I have plans to extend that in another direction, in particular I'll be introducing 'slice and diece' features, which will only work when the dimensions are common accorss the entire dataset (in your case, the dimensions are district, city, country etc).\nPS as this isn't an issue with the gird (it's a questions!!) I'm closing this issue. Thanks :)\n. You have to do it yourself!!\n. thanks for raising\n. fixed in 1.7.0\n. just reviewed your code, all looks fine. thanks for this. i didn't realise multi-column sorting would be that easy!!\n. wonderfully clean!!! indeed!!! something that's pretty rare these days... a forgotten art in today's world... :)\n. fixed in 1.8.0\n. not going to implement, as this is changing the state machine nature of the grid. instead you should implement your own selection mechanism. first turn off click selection (suppressRowClickSelection=true) and the implement your own click handler for the row (rowClicked event), then use the grid selection api for the selection.. what you could do is group the data yourself, and give the grid grouped data. this is what the file explorer does. having rows not displayed, kind'a of goes against the mathematical definition of a group. i will keep your request in mind, if it fits in nicely to the overall design, I'll keep it in. I think what would be cool is pluggable functionality, or somehow configure the grouping functionality.\n. @JimmyBoh exactly . . . . you need to have it in that node structure, which is specific to the grid. i plan on making this easier to created, and better documented, in the future . . . .\n@dbubs  . . . . if you are passing in grouped data, then you don't need to specify groupKeys, leave that attribute out of the grid  options. as JimmyBoh suggests, best look at the code in the File Browser example.\n. understood. thanks for raising.\n. should not use a string as then people would think %width is acceptable.\nthe grid now prints a warning if a string is used.\n. is there anything except a performance benefit? i'm slow to use any Angular feature that is not of great benefit, as I plan on also supporting Angular 2 and other frameworks - currently the grid can exists outside any framework - so limiting exposure to Angular is good for the grid.\n. what about not using templates? i only put that in to ease peoples journey away from ng-grid. however, in my applications using Angular Grid, I simply don't use them. your grid will work much faster if you don't use templates. I'm going to close this request if you don't mind, I don't think I'll be making a code change :)\n. RTL is a css feature. Apply at the CSS level to get it working. Either the cell CSS, or create (or edit an existing) theme.\n. header renderer was provided during 2016.. http://www.angulargrid.com/forum/showthread.php?tid=2253\n. this was done, there is an API to update the quick filters.. complete\n. thanks nathan. i have a question - when you require('angular-grid'), shouldn't it be using what's in the dist folder??\n. cool :)\n. yea that's my plan, i'll put in some overrides in the gridoptions.\n. thanks for the PR. i have looked at the code and looks nice. i will take a closer look when i am less tired and do a proper review & test. can you please advise, where did this pattern came from? is it something you have observed in other grids (and if so please let me know where), or something that you came up with yourself??? thanks :)\nPS thanks for updating the docs and example. very helpful.\n. thanks Peter for the info.\nFYI - I plan on re-factoring the selection API in the coming weeks, so have\nnot taken the PR, as I want to do the re-factoring first before introducing\nmore complexity in the selection. the re-factoring will be changing some of\nthe core stuff around how selection works - and will be keeping your\npattern in mind when doing so.\nOn 25 May 2015 at 19:40, Peter Oberhofer notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nhi Niall,\nI didn't see this pattern in other grids.

Let me know when the PR is done and I'll take a proper look. When I did the first pass of this, it took me a lot of thinking and working through patterns to get it working, so am expecting what your are working on to be pretty tricky and requiring a good code review by me!\n. have had a quick look at this just now - the column resize doesn't appear to work - should this be working? thanks :)\n. thanks for forwarding. will prob be the weekend before i get a chance, as i want to give it proper time for a full code review. thanks :)\n. i was going to code review your change, and then merge it manually (as i'll probably make a lot of changes to it). i wasn't going to merge as is. so if it's not merging with the new version (which it isn't i think) then don't worry about it (unless you want to merge it for yourself).\n\ni do apologies, i've a lot on my plate.\n. i have implemented multi level column groups in v3 branch. this will be in the next release.\n. I fixed it up as follows:\n- didn't take into account visible vs hidden columns (used in header groups)\n- didn't take into account cols of different widths, or cols that are resized after first shown\n- gridOptions.colWidth is optional, code broke if missing\n- didn't work with pinned columns\n- broken into separate method, so now different method for col and row - makes API less confusing when only requiring one or the other\n. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-45. working though old issue,s i searched code for \"event.currentTarget\" and couldn't find. so think this issue is no longer valid given the code has moved on. if still an issue, please reopen.. will be in my next release :)\n. Nope, sorry. Haven't looked since.\n. still on our todo list,\napi.setFocusedCell(rowIndex, colKey, floating) is already in the api\n. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-46. use:\napi.deselectIndex(index)\nor\napi.deselectNode(node)\n. if this is a question, can you please place in the forum? please take a look at the documentation and examples, the File Browser shows how to do a tree, the Grouping and Aggregation shows how to do grouping.\n. yes the filter only filters leaf nodes. that's the current design. i'm not sure if your raising this as a bug, a feature request, or just asking a question!!! if just a question, please use the board, as issues should be 'work to be done' for me. thanks :)\n. linked to https://github.com/ceolter/angular-grid/issues/110\n. nope.\n. grid node does have reference to parent\n. closing this as it is a duplicate of https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/issues/110. so i'm clear, your raising the layout been misplaced, looks like the rows are slightly off placement?\n.

(eg rows animate by sliding down when an insert happens)\n. i've just finished this. it will be in the next release. planned for the next day or two.\ninserting rows was easy, it's done by index.\ndeleting rows is hard - deleting by index gets mixed up with server side sorting and deleting. so instead i've opted for the client (ie you) to delete on the server side, then the grid has API's to refresh the cache, so it will reload rows after the delete.\n. @BevanR \nIs there a dev build or nightly build we can try it out with?\n=> I did a full release on Friday last week including this feature.\nWould simple cache invalidation cause a redraw or UI flash?\n=> depends on whether you refresh (just redraw once data loads) or purge (data removed, wait for load, then redraw, so blank rows while loading) the cache.\nDoes ag-Grid know the nodes or unique idenrifers of all rows preceding the current viewport?\n=> No it doesn't, except for selected. One improvement I had in last Fridays release is the grid now keeps track of selected rows. So the rows stay selected as the scroll moves up / down, but also between server side sorts and filters. This is done using with your client providing id's for the rows.\n. @BevanR \n1. join my mail dist list. details on main doc page. follow me on twitter.\n2. great.\n3. great again!\n. thank you for raising. the problem is some short-sightedness on my side. the filters are identified by column id's, and the column id's are currently just indexes from left to right. so the second filter stays with the second column, even though the column has totally changed. i will fix this one soon, expect the fix in this weekends release.\n. fixed in master. the column filters are now identified using the colDef.field attribute.\n. noted. thanks.\n. the new tool panel covers this.\n. same as https://github.com/ceolter/angular-grid/issues/124\n. yes it will\n. fixed.\n. Fixed in master. Will do build when I get home. \n. thanks for the feedback. i'll take a look soon. ps in the mean time, you can manually clear the filters via the api to at least get consistency.\n. in which case, save the filter state, update the rows, then set the filters\nagain.\nthe only problem with set filters, is that the set of available values can\nchange between the row sets - that's why i decided to just clear the filter\nwith new rows. with a different set of available values, the filter state\nmay not make sense with the new rows.\nOn 9 June 2015 at 22:30, Fangming Du notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nthanks!\nbut actually I want to keep the filters other than delete them. :)\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/angular-grid/issues/203#issuecomment-110509374\n.\n\n\n\nThe information transmitted is intended only for the person or entity to\nwhich it is addressed and may contain confidential and/or privileged\nmaterial.

If you want just scrolling in one direction (ie horizontally) then I suggest you work out the height of the table dynamically based on the number of rows. i'd rather not have the table change height by itself, it's design is to fill the div you put it in. \n. i just tried this out, it works!! thanks for the tip.\n. any ideas on having a max height?\n. sorry, i had to take this out again. in the next release, this feature will be dropped. i have redesigned they way the layout works, and not it is no longer compatilble with your suggested solution.\n. +1\n. i will be implementing dynamic row height in the new year. it's not a small change. as you see, the grid uses 'row virtualisation' which rips rows out and in when you are scrolling. so the grid will need to work out what the start position of each row is and store is somewhere so it can do the virtualisation.\n. this is now done. it will be in my next release.\n. second example this page\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-row-height/index.php\n. yes\n. that looks fine, don't know what's wrong. if you are not using the latest version of ag-Grid, make sure the version you are using has this feature (check the change log). if still not working, debug through the ag-Grid code and see what is wrong??\n. @squarewave24 must be something in your code that is setting the rowHeight property. you are right, if that is set, then the getRowHeight() is not called.\n. it can not be used with virtual body rows if using viewport or virtual pagination, it cannot be used. not for now. maybe in the future.. hi, the grid is not aware of flex (like me, i don't use flex, am not aware of how it works). basically the grid takes up the space you give it - so if flex can size the containing div, then do that and the grid will fit it.\nplease can you ask questions on the board on my website instead? that way others can benefit form the answers! thanks :)\n. Pass the row count into the callbackSuccess, as lastRow.\neg:\ncallbackSuccess(rowsThisPage, data.counts);\n. > var lastRow = data.counts;\n\n                    callbackSuccess(rowsThisPage, lastRow);\n\n\nin the above code, what is lastRow when the problem happens?\nlastRow should always be null/undefined/-1 until you know how big your dataset is, then you set it to the rowindex of the very last row.\nthe fact the grid is showing 119 looks odd, as it should only show an odd number here (not an 'end of page' number) when it hits the last page.\nother than that, you code looks fine. it's difficult for me to suggest what else might be wrong. if you could replicate in a plunker, would be easier.\n. when you update the page size, are you resetting the datasource?\neg\ngridOptions.api.onNewDatasource();\n. kind'of toubleshooting blind here, but:\nprint to the console the datasource pageSize just before your if statement:\n\nconsole.out('pageSize=' + dataSource.pageSize\nif (vm.gridOptions) {\n           vm.gridOptions.api.setDatasource(dataSource);\n          return false;\n       }\n\nif the grid is working (which it is i believe, lots of people using it) then I thin you might be setting the page size to 119.\n. knew it!!! :)\ngood luck with your app. if it's an external facing website, please pass on a link so i can see the grid in use!\n. i have updated my demo to now including changing page size (won't be online till my next release). i also put in logic to check the type, if it's not a number, it prints to the console warning such. so nobody will have the same problem you did!\n. which other grid did you use? and why did you change? (ie what was good about ag-grid in particular)\nif you don't  mind me asking!!\n. mayve parseInt() was not a full number? i'll update the code and validate it. just updated the code, now the grid parses and floors the number, so it will be converted to a whole number if it is not already.. it's on my list of things to do. the initial design simply didn't consider filtering or sorting of the groups.\nwhat you can do, is have your group key also as a column. at least then it can be filtered with that column. but that probably doesn't fit your design.\nthere is already a github issue for filtering on groups, so am closing this one.\nfor your parents to be selectable, from the docs:\nhttp://www.angulargrid.com/angular-grid-selection/index.php\n\nSelecting groups can have the effect of selecting the group row, or selecting all the children in the group. This is done by setting the attribute 'groupSelectsChildren' to true or false. When set to false, then selecting the group will select the group node. When set to true, then selecting the group will either select or deselect all of the children.\n. @vladdvs re row click to select group, tracking this now in another issue #224\n\nregarding filtering on groups, it's not on my immediate radar, so rough guess is 2 months.\nin the mean time, you can always implement your own custom filter???\n. filtering parents work is not yet scheduled, so no ETA\n. > I tried to look for documentation for this function\nit's mentioned here:\nhttp://www.angulargrid.com/angular-grid-resizing/index.php\nre why it's failing, i don't have enough info. do you have a stacktrace?\nmaybe the grid isn't attached to the dom when you are calling??\n. size cols to fit was no intended to work with 'noScrolls', i'll add the check in, so errors if person tries to use it.\ndoes the grid display fine if you don't call this method?\n. i can't really say - by just a screenshot it could be anything. it's probably something you are doing though, as the grid is working for 100's of people and nobody has reported this.\n. http://www.angulargrid.com/angular-grid-column-definitions/index.php\ncolDef.suppressMenu = true\ncolDef.suppressSorting = true\n. @HariBabuThubati if you don't want a column in quick filter, then use colDef.getQuickFilterText and return null for the columns you want to exclude.\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-filtering/\n. then i don't know what's wrong. maybe you can debug through ag-Grid and see what the logic is, why it's breaking?\n. I am using ag-grid-enterprise 4.2.11\ncheck the release notes, this feature was introduced in v6.\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/change-log/changeLogIndex.php\n. All I can say is what the grid is already telling you, that you don't have a 'getGui' method in your filter.\nthe code in ag-grid is:\nif (!filterWrapper.filter.getGui) { // because users can do custom filters, give nice error message\n    throw 'Filter is missing method getGui';\n}\nwhere 'filter' is the result of calling 'new' on the provided filter.\n. the default sorting is by this:\nvalueA < valueB\nso if numbers, it compares the numbers, if strings, it's alpha numeric, if dates, it's just dateA < dateB\nif this doesn't work, then you need to provide your own custom sorting function. see the docs (sorting page) on providing your own sorting func.\n. user valueGetter for the conversion, not cellRenderer. see section in docs.\n. > valueGetter: commonService.decodeFieldTextFromChar('gender', 'data.gender'),\nthe value getter needs to be either a function or an expression (string)\ni'm guessing what  you mean is something like:\nvalueGetter: function(params) {\n  return commonService.decodeFieldTextFromChar('gender', params.data.gender);\n}\n. thanks for raising. i'll fix this.\n. well if your going to hack it, this is better:\nthis.paginationController = gridOptions.api.paginationController;\n  this.paginationController.currentPage = 3;\n  this.paginationController.loadPage();\ni still intend refactoring the pagination (similar to how i refactored the virtual pagination and introduced an API to that about two weeks back).\n. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-47. Grid automatically resizes to the containing div. So if div grows (window\nresize or other reason)  then grid will grow to fit.\nThere is a method 'size cols to fit'  that you can call to get cols to fit\nwidth. You Could call this in listener to window resize, best in a timer,\ntry 500 ms, to give grid time to resize first.\nOn 12 Jun 2015 22:11, \"dereklin\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI did some search but couldn't find the answers:\nI was wondering if angular grid can be responsive to window resize, and\nthat the column widths could automatically take up the whole screen real\nestate.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/angular-grid/issues/220.\n. to get the grid to resize, you need to have the div containing the grid to resize. this is outside the scope of the grid, it's standard css. try using 100% width and height.\n\nfor the cols to fit the width, call the api function api.sizeColsToFit() (might have it spelt wrong here, but you can get it exactly from the documention api page)\n. the main demo here:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/example.php\ndemonstrates the grid resizing as you change the browser size.\nso 100% width does work.\nfurthermore, see the examples here for detailed discussion on responsive design:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-responsiveness/\n. > To my knowledge, custom css for a checkbox requires a div around the checkbox.\nThat's not true!

Thanks :)\n. noted. thanks.\n. already done. class is ag-row-hover\n. @jlarso11 it's css - so if you lay your css out correctly, your style will get used.. groups can now select their children, i think that is what this issue is asking for.. i've noticed on my IE, that the grid scrolls are not been used, instead the browser is doing the scrolling and the grid scrolls are not working. can you confirm this is the same for you? (ie the grid should only render one 'scroll viewable window', but it's actually rendering the entire grid for me)\n. \"61309-61358\" . . . . . yes that's what is supposed to happen. i just noticed today in work it's broken, although i tested it at home - must be just my version of IE in work.\ni'll have to check this at home, i'm getting different results in work.\n. i have checked this at home. and yes it's as you describe. looks like a limit on the height of the underlying div (where i place the cells). i agree this is a problem, and i'll leave the issue open, but i won't be treating it as high severity as, well in my opinion, someone won't be reading down through 65000+ rows on a screen. it's more probable they will load the data into the grid, then filter or sort to find the data that they are interested in.\nregarding scrolling, i agree, the scrolling makes the grid frustrating to use'in IE. i find that the mouse wheel scrolls smoother than the scrollbars. my take on this is the grid supports IE, in that it works, so if people mush use it they can, however we try to move our customers over to another browser for a better HTML 5 overall experience.\n. i've changed my mind on the scrolling speed issue. i'll look into making it faster. there are some tricks i know about i haven't applied yet, i'll get them done, should speed it up.\nalso someone said it's an issue with Chrome (they must be on a slow machine)\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/angular-grid/issues/231#issuecomment-112379738\n. nothing comes to mind. i'm working on performance improvements at the moment, will see if still an issue after this weekends relese.\n. no update on this :( busy with other items, sorry.\n. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-48\n. if you want the grouping to be done again, call api.onNewRows()\n. > In order to make the grid look nice, I have to hit the resize button one more time. And in order to make this seamless, I have to resize the grid programmatically in a resize event, right?\n--> yes that's right. maybe in the future in put a hook in, to resize when the grid resizes, but it's not on my immediate list.\n\nI was wondering: instead of setting the column width in pixel, can I set the width in percentage?\n\n--> again, that's right. the grid is laid out in pixel perfect sizing. although percent sounds nice, the implementation of it is more awkward.\n. yes i think it is due to something like you say. i've noticed this before, but don't know under what circumstance it happens. eg my test drive and examples (i just took a quick look at the 'getting started, loading rows' example) all work fine. yet the larger example (http://localhost/example-data-grid/index.php) and your plunker show it happening. as it's a very small detail, i don't have fixing it very far up my list.  and nobody has mentioned it to me until now.\n. not happening in latest.. thanks for raising. what's in the docs was my intention, i must of forgotten to implement it!\n. fixed in 1.11.1\n. i don't experience this. what browser are you using?\n. ok, will take a look, see if i can speed it up. however the scrolling is pretty fast on my machine.\n. tempted to say this weekend, but am already very busy!!!! this weekend? if not, the weekend after??\n. if your 50/50, i'm working on a very cool sidebar to allow column visibility, reorder and grouping, all with drag and drop. that should help push you!!\n. @elaijuh are you looking to do advanced cells with the cellRenderers? i've spent some time looking into this tonight, and it appears to be the dom manipulation that i am doing in creating the cells that's slowing it down. if i just created the rows as one big string of HTML, then it would render much more quickly (as i'd just give the html to the browser in one go, rather than calling multiple DOM methods). I wonder, if you are not intending to do complex cell customisations, maybe I put in a 'fast switch' where it just does string based rendering (which means you won't be able to do advanced stuff in your cellRenderer either).\n. ok, it's on my list to make vast improvements here. but it's going to be a big job, so i can't promise anything in the short term.\nwith my example, if i take out all the cell renderers (ie just to built-in plain text rendering) it does speed things up by about 50%. the problem appears to be the dom interaction IE does, which isn't such a big deal with the other browsers.\n. ouch!!!!!!  . .. . . now i can't have them with one up on me!!!!!! . . . . . . . looks like i've some work to do . . . .\n. yea one man team. i can't take help from others because i'm very particular about how i want things done :) and yea i'm working for a bank.\n. i'm working on performance improvements at the moment, should speed it up. the next major release (this coming weekend???) should have it.\nin the mean time, these pointers:\na) avoid angularjs inside the grid\nb) if using custom cell renderers, return strings of html (do not construct dom elements)\n. all vertical scrolling issues should now be gone. my example 'test drive' works fine on internet explorer (thanks to a new feature called 'scroll lag'), chrome, safari and firefox. interested to get feedback :)\n. Nope, no suggestion. It doesn't lag for me in IE with mouse wheel so\ndifficult to troubleshoot.\nHowever given its only ie and not all users of ie, don't think it's a major\nissue.\nOn 19 Jul 2015 04:42, \"AvishekNath\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHi Ceolter,\nThanks a lot for spending time on this.

I can't reproduce. I check my test drive (the 'bought' col has a comparator) and debugged through the following:\n\nfunction booleanComparator(value1, value2) {\n   var value1Cleaned = booleanCleaner(value1);\n   var value2Cleaned = booleanCleaner(value2);\n\nand it's working???\n.

Yes i'm aware of this, you need to do this:\n{headerName: \"Age\", field: \"age\", width: 90, filter: 'number', filterParams: {newRowsAction: 'keep'}}\nBasically the filters by default clear themselves when new data is loaded - they are not aware of been using server side  or not - so need to turn this off to behave as you expect.\n. yes it is. cell headerRendereing in documentation.\n. http://www.angulargrid.com/angular-grid-header-rendering/index.php\n. yes. two options. 1) set it on gridoptions (for all cols) or 2) set it on colDef (for a specific col)\n. for headerTemplate, does this imply you will be using angular in your template???\n. can't really comment on why the dropdown isn't appearing. you can test if angular is working by putting in {{2+2}} (see if 4 comes out) into your template. at least then you know if it's the grid that's broke or something on your end. \n. yes, in a few weeks. i'm giving serious thought to moving the whole thing to TS.\n. this was done months ago. i didn't update the issue.. if no sort or group or filter, then the order should be as you provide it. if this is not the case, then something is wrong. you could also use the API to sort the data via the grid after the data load\n. got it, i introduced a bug when putting in the sorting API :(\nit's checked into master (but i wouldn't advise grabbing master at this time, it's not ready for the next release).\nif you want to fix it locally, you can hack, basically change:\nif (sortingOptions.length >= 0) {\nto \nif (sortingOptions.length > 0) {\n. don't attach one function, attach a different function to each. all these several grid functions can then call another function, passing in another argument with the grid details.\n. ok - all i can say for now, is that it's not possible.\n. have you duplicated this issue:\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/angular-grid/issues/114\n. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-53. the documents were updated, it's possible to do this without changes in the grid.\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-selection/#gsc.tab=0. afraid i disagree!\nclicking on the row is normal row selection. the grid is designed that if you click on the row, it unselects other rows. to do multi-select with row selection, you have to hold down shift.\nto get it behaving 'more nicely', then use the gridOption.suppressRowClickSelection=true\nthat way, the checkbox is used exclusively for selection, giving a consistent feel.\n. the modelUpdated is from the inMemoryRowModel . . . . . . which is not used when doing Virtual Paging (aka infinate scrolling).\nare you using infinite scrolling?\nwhy do you want this event, if you are already in control (via the datasource) of the model updates??\n. yes it does make sense, but i don't think 'on model updated' is what you want. that's intended to be called after rows are loaded, that's the row model that's updated. think you confusing it with the sort model - that doesn't trigger the model updated (but can cause it because it causes a data reload, but that's to late in your case).\nsounds to me like a server side problem? you should compare the sort model to the previous sort model in the server???\n. nope. already an issue open for API on top of pagination.\nwhat you could do is keep track of what was last loaded via your data source.\n. please use the forum for asking questions!!\nthe github issues are for issues within the grid project.\n. makes sense. will stick this onto my list. thanks.\n. since moving to typescript, i've reviewed this. the maps are not included when i do releases now.\n. you can't do paging when 'dontUseScrolls', it's not supported.\nthe dontUseScrolls is intended for printing a grid (i'm going to change it's name soon), the grid is laid out differently. so you just can't do datasource things when in print mode.\n. you always need angular-grid.css\nthe themes are option that should be used in addition to the core css\nsee the examples.\nalso that's whats mentioned in the docs!!\n. yea i'll fix this soon!!\n. this is working now.\n. the current header template allows this.\n. in the last release (1.10.0), this functionality was taken out. i'll do a\nmini release and put this back in (1.10.1). will do first thing in the\nmorning.\nbasically, the resize is now triggered by the window resizing. i'll change\nit back to the way it was (which was polling the size every few hundred\nmilliseconds)\nOn 22 June 2015 at 21:52, Billy Kirk notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHi,\nI am using angular grid in a directive, and set the height and width of\nthe grid through the directive, which updates the height and width values.\nThese changing values are set via ng-style.

\n. this is done.. i do have plans to extend this tool panel, but i don't have immediate plans (ie in the next few weeks). i'm always anxious of having others help me, because the project is 'all in my head' and without automates tests. in addition to this, people tend to implement what makes sense for them, rather than considering the grid as a reusable component.\nhaving said that, yes i'm interested in doing some joint work here, as it should be pretty standard work. this toolbar can be so much better, and a real differentiation against other grids.\nlet me have a think about where things are going.\ntwo items i want to do are a) have the columnController sharable between grids, so more than one grid can be working off the same set of columns (ie resize or  reorder in one grid, changes are in all grids, would be very useful for stacking grids, one on top of the other) and then b) have dockable filters, so you can have the (eg) 4 most common filters always showing in the toolpanel - this is probably in addition to the column managment, however it would need to fit in to the toolpanel, and what you are suggesting to me sounds like making the toolpanel a more generic sidebar with options on what to present to the user.,\n. No plans yet.\nWhere would you define the group? Is this the same group as the header group (as currently used)?\nalso, to show the group, would mean the 'List' component would need to be extended to be a tree. but this is what the grid is. maybe the grid can be used as the component here. but that would be a BIG change, something I'd really like to be personally heavily involved in.\n. > I need to specify another column to group on and then I get that group by header with the arrow\nsorry, i don't understand this?\nre timeline, for the grid-panel re-vamp, either end of this year or Q1 next year. i'm very busy with Angular Connect preparation at the moment.\n. @a497988 i understand and fair request. no there is no workaround. sorry.\n. @abhishek2016 \nyou can stop the column menu from showing the column selection by setting suppressMenuColumnPanel=true (grid property)\n. @abhishek2016 customise the menu. see the docs on how you can alter the default list of items and remove the toolpanel option.\n. @etiennecrb \nastonished :) - you'll give me a big head!!!\ni implemented 'suppressToolPanel' on column def yesterday. will be in a release we plan today / tomorrow.\n. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-59. filters now close if you scroll horizontally..

I made some changes:\n\nChanged docs a bit.\nChanged suppressGroupRow to groupSuppressRow - to keep consistent with all the other group properties starting with 'group'.\nThe change is fine, and it works, however I think it doesn't properly demonstrate what this feature does. The example (appreciated btw) doesn't really get across what this feature is doing. To get it across, then would need to have the grid render somehow showing this.\nOne option would be to only populate the group cell for the first entry in the group. To do this, the node would need to have the 'child index'.\nAnother option would be to have a border at the bottom of each group?? (again, node would need a flat 'first in group' and / or 'last in group'.\nOr could have a different background color for the group (would need node group index, then cell class could have odd / even colors for the group).\nAnyway, I'm sure you have it implemented, exactly as you need it!!! So maybe this is for me to do :(\n. ok i've just checked a headstart in.\nnow in the rowController, i tag each node with:\nnode.firstChild\nnode.lastChild\nnode.childIndex\nbecause this is on the node, it is accessable to the callbacks that do the styling.\ni updated your example, to highlight where the row is the first child.\ni believe that's all that is needed FROM THE GRID. the rest of the work is up to the example to apply appropriate style based on what is presented here. do you want to work with that and improve the demo?\nright, i've got to get to bed, nite.\n. you can already do this. see here, value getters as functions. the example 'age now' column is this:\nhttp://www.angulargrid.com/angular-grid-value-getters/index.php\n. i'm in the middle of large refactoring and my latest change has caused conflicts with this PR :(\nhowever, looking at the code, i don't think it works.\nthe logic in getNextSortDirection, if default is desc, then goes from no sort, to descending, to no sort (ie skips the ascending). just visual inspection, i didn't test (due to the conflicts).\nif you fix the conflicts before i hit the code again, i'll check it out and verify that (or you can fix if what i say makes sense and i'm right)\n. duplicate of\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/angular-grid/issues/125\n. allChildrenCount is all children and children's children, not just immediate children.\n. where are you printing to the console?\n. from the headers? you mean colDef?\n. i'm not getting what your getting\ni put this into the test drive\nrowClass: function(params) {\n            var node = params.node;\n            if (node.parent && node.parent.parent && node.parent.parent.parent) {\n                console.log('' + node.parent.parent.parent.childIndex);\n            }\n            return [];\n        },\nand then pivot by country, language, game of choice,\nand i get a mixture of indexes\n. cool\n. you can provide your own comparator in the colDef to achieve this??\n.

After thing about this a lot, I've decided to go with a different approach, as there were to many options. We had suppressSortDesc, suppressSortDesc, supporessUnSort, defaultSort, and possibly more in the future. Easy to understand if you just want to use one, but tricky and possibly conflicting if you want to use many.\nSo the solution is sortingOrder. I've updated the documentation (see the page on sorting) to describe what I have done. Basically you say something like sortingOrder = [descending, ascending] to say you want to sort first by descending, then ascending. This one property replaces the need for all the other properties.\n. > I believe you would have to pass in ['descending', 'ascending']\nalmost, pass in ['desc','asc'] or if you want it to 'unsort' when you click the same col while it's asc then ['desc','asc',null]\n\nWhen do you think you will be pushing the refactored version to bower?\n\nthis weekend\n. this is not a bug (hence closing the issue, questions should be on the board!!).\nthe valueGetter should be an expression. so passing in the string 'getTextItem' would be the same as this:\nvalueGetter = function() {\n   return getTextItem;\n}\nwhich is not valid javascript\n. no worries!!! just tying to maintain order.\n. already pr created that i'll be accepting soon\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/angular-grid/pull/356\n. could not reproduce so closing. if you want to reopen, please provide how to reproduce, providing a fiddle would be very helpful. or if it's a question, please use the forum. thanks :)\n. yup, had noticed that a few days ago.\n. i was beginning to wonder if anyone was using footers, as it was broken about two releases ago and nobody complained!\n. > allows us to build our own column and grouping management, using the grid as one part of a bigger picture with other content\nnoted.\nyou sound like your requirements are like mine.\nthe grid won't be getting bloated in one direction, it will all be about 'well you can do this, or you can build your own', just like the filters, i should you how a filter is done, give some examples, but it's the pluggable nature of the filters that make it powerful, rather than 'one size fits all'.\nalso the cell renderers, i used to treat grouping, for example, as a special case inside the grid. now it's changed so the grouping is just a provided custom cell renderer, allowing you to replace it if you want the grouping cells to have different behaviour.\nand then also the tool panel, as you mention, i used to have logic in there that updated the model. but i'm refactoring, and moving all the logic into the columnController (proper MVC), so if you want to provide your own tool panel, you can. or even share one columnController against many grids (again proper MVC).\ninteresting comments on the other grids, i welcome this knowledge as i haven't given many other grids thorough usage, just a small bit of a few, and didn't like them without getting deep!\n. this is working as i expect. when the group is closed, the group data is displayed beside the group. when the group is open, the group data is displayed at the bottom of the group in the footer.\n. > i'm using a custom groupAggFunction and the header aggregates show as \"NaN\" rather than blank\nshouldn't be happening like this. when i do my own custom agg functions, i don't set the fields that have no data (so they remain undefined). this is what is happening on the demo page (and on your page by the looks of things, looking at month, product and month number, all have blank for the header.\nre the header dropping to become the footer, what would the desired behavior be? maybe two modes, one for 'drop header' (what it it now) and one for 'header and footer separate'? wold the node then require two pieces of data, one for header, on for footer?\nit makes sense for me, as i developed this feature for a P&L account, where the 'total income' is below the list of income details. i appreciate it's not the desired behavior for everyone, but i do have use cases that use this so i need  to keep it the way it is. but i'm open to making it configurable.\n. i'm still not clear on what data you would have.\nwould you want to display the same data in the header and the footer?\nor would you have two separate data sets, one for the header and one for the footer?\n. @ataft I added a new property groupSuppressBlankHeader, the feature will be in the next release.\n. > awesome, you truly are the best!\nthere's a donate button on the website :)\n. you wont phuck it up for anyone, as i won't be accepting any PR without doing a full review of the code!!!!\n. lol\n. sorry if i'm getting mixed up, but did i accept a PR form you fixed this the other day? and hence we can close this issue?\n. review complete, looks fine :)\n. this was fixed ages back. now when you resize, even if the mouse goes outside of the grid, it works.. the idea is that you provide your own cell renderers to get custom editing. i don't plan on providing a library of editors for different value types.\n. something like this:\nhttp://localhost/example-web-component-grid/index.php\n. Great. I plan on making it more 'web component' in the future, such as having the api methods directly on the DOM object, and also having the gridOptions as dom attributes where appropriate. any advice on this is welcome, you might know more about web components than i do!\n. @scotthovestadt yes, shift parameter not neccessary.\n. nope, on the backlog :(\n. no. doesn't meant not soon, just not ETA right now.\n. I don't think it would pass Niall's approval you make me sound like a difficult person to work with!!!\nre free vs enterprise, all the selection stuff is in the free version.\n. @TFrascaroli lol - no offence taken at all my friend, you brought a smile to my face!! :)\n. @TFrascaroli :)\nthis is deffo high on my list. if you raise a PR, it will be a kick in the bum for me to get it done!\n. i have implemented this, will be in the next release.\n. if not this week, then next week. that's my estimate.\n. only works with normal row model. this is because the viewport row model doesn't necessarily have all the rows loaded, so shift selection would only partially work if it was implemented.. the build in editing is 'one cell at a time'. if you want something else, you will need to implement this yourself with custom cell renderers.\nps for questions, please use the forum, issues are for 'problems that need fixing in the grid'.\n. nope. the filters were not designed with extension in mind, they are more 'examples', so you can build your own with similar patterns.\n. sounds fair\n. this is done.. try now. i've wired up angular slightly differently. btw i'm avoiding angular typed files on purpose to keep it simple, and also not do anything that would confuse supporting both angular 1 and angular 2.\n. this is now working.. yes. it's only a problem if you want it to be. the browsers are not bothered about duplicate id's, it's just humans who get upset when they see this!!! it's already mentioned in a previous issue so will close this one. going forward i'll keep my id's unique, just to keep people happy!!\n. no worries :) thanks for sharing :)\n. sounds good. done.\n. PR sounds good - should be a small enough change. It should go into the popup service as an option somehow 'close on ESC pressed'.\n. The PR worked, so closing.\n. Please see the selection methods in the API:\nhttp://www.angulargrid.com/angular-grid-api/index.php\n. looks almost fine, but when i mentioned having it as an option, i meant as an option to the popup service. so it would be used always for the filters, but the option would be there not not have it on if the popup service was to be used someplace else in the future. if you can fix, that would be welcome, however i'm happy to fix it also. i think the gridOptions options is overkill, possibly confusing the gritOptions unnecessarily. my apologies if i confused things trying to explain the optional property.\n. cool. thanks.\n. i plan on changing the selection, but it's not near the top of my list at the moment.\nmaking it pluggable is a nice idea, however that would take time for me to get in also!\n. range select is now in.. sounds like your don't have a height specified in your grid. specify a height on the div element where you have ag-grid directive.\n. Yes you would. ag-grid is designed to use the space you give it. it is not designed to expand automatically depending on the size of the rows. if you want to do this, you will need to control the height of your grid div.\n. yes it was introduced on purpose to support pluggable panels (such as the tool panel). going forward, more pluggable panels will be introduced. this meant the grid needs to have a known height to lay out the panels. the fact it was working before was not an intended feature, just happened to work that way.\n. the colId is calculated as follows:\n```\n            if (colDef.colId) {\n                this.colId = colDef.colId;\n            } else if (colDef.field) {\n                this.colId = colDef.field;\n            } else {\n                this.colId = '' + Column.colIdSequence++;\n            }\n```\nin other words, if you don't provide a colId in your colDef, it will then use the field. if the field is also missing, an id will be generated.\nknowing this, is it still a problem??\n. they should both be using the colIds - in case field is not unique. let me check . . .\n. i checked in a fix. now col-id is used consistently everywhere.\nusing field was legacy, before i introduced col-id. col-id is unique, field may not be.\n. i am already giving width and height on all the generated svg's. can you advise further??\ncode from svgFactory.ts is:\nfunction createIconSvg(width?: any) {\n        var eSvg = document.createElementNS(SVG_NS, \"svg\");\n        if (width > 0) {\n            eSvg.setAttribute(\"width\", width);\n            eSvg.setAttribute(\"height\", width);\n        } else {\n            eSvg.setAttribute(\"width\", \"10\");\n            eSvg.setAttribute(\"height\", \"10\");\n        }\n        return eSvg;\n    }\n. that is totally the fault of the nvd3\nwhat you can do to get around it is put the following style in AFTER you include the nvd3 styles:\n<style>\n            svg {\n                width: auto;\n                height: auto;\n                display: inline-block;\n            }\n        </style>\nbut the problem is with nvd3. they are applying a style to EVERY svg element. that's just silly and how clashes happen. please raise this on their github project!!!\n. thanks. fixed.\n. i put your datasource settings into my example here:\nhttp://localhost:8082/angular-grid-virtual-paging/index.php\nand it was working fine.\ncan you give me more information so i can recreate the problem?\nany chance you can provide a plunker or fiddle?\n. can you give me a link to the plunker where i can see the code? the link above is just to the running version.\n. when i put in the un-minified code, i get the error:\n{\n  \"statusCode\": 400,\n  \"error\": \"Bad Request\",\n  \"message\": \"Payload content length greater than maximum allowed: 1048576\"\n}\nwhich makes it impossible for me to troubleshoot :(\n. The problem is your datasource. You should NOT call params.successCallback() in the same thread. It is intended that you will call successCallback() asynchronously.\n```\ngetRows: function(params) {\n          console.time(\"ag grid paging\");\n          console.log('asking for ' + params.startRow + ' to ' + params.endRow);\n          var lastRow = -1;\n          var offset = bindingContext.currentPage * bindingContext.pageSize;\n      if (bindingContext.pageSize <= params.endRow - offset) {\n        //var page = Math.floor(params.endRow/bindingContext.pageSize);\n        bindingContext.currentPage++;\n        bindingContext.GetData(bindingContext.BindGrid);\n      }\n\n      // this is the problem - if you are not going to do so async HTTP call to get the data,\n      // then you need to at least put it into a timeout.\n      params.successCallback(bindingContext.GlobalCache.data.slice(params.startRow - offset, params.endRow - offset), lastRow);\n      console.timeEnd(\"ag grid paging\");\n    }\n\n``\n. have you fixed the above?\n.

Olivia Brennan remained selected regardless of the sort of filter.\n. Ah, you didn't mention you were using infinite scrolling, I didn't test with that. I'll take another look (not now, but reopening the issue).\n. @TFrascaroli that link is an old link, we don't have 'angular' in our URL's anymore. this is the correct one, that you should be getting from our documentation:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-virtual-paging/virtualPagingServerSide.html\n. the original issue, selection with infinite scrolling, is fixed in latest, so closing.\n. @randdusingIf I select Sophie Beckham, filter out Country by Ireland, and then remove the filter, Sophie Beckham stays selected. Is that intended?`\n=> yes, that's intended. selection and filtering are not related.\n. Thanks for your kind words! And thanks for your PR. Your assumption is correct, this is a bug. I'll accept your PR now.\n. > A better way of doing this might be to remove both viewports and scroll them together, while having only a horizontal viewport for the body columns. It'd be a smoother scrolling experience... That would require a major refactor of a lot of pieces though.\nthat won't work well, because the non-pinned has to scroll independently of the pinned when scrolling horizontally.\ni put a lot of time into getting the basic scrolling working. the pinned section has a lot in common with the header. basically the pinned scrolls vertically with the body but doesn't scroll horizontally, and the header scrolls horizontally with the body but doesn't scroll vertically. it works very well, just some minor quirks  such as the mouse wheel. doing it another way would just introduce other quirks i'm sure as i did PoC some other options when coming up with the current design.\n. > If I can get this feature into a stable place, would you consider merging it in?\ni haven't had a chance to look at your code yet. assuming the code is fine, then yes i'll consider merging it.\ni've spent about 4hrs today going through another PR and rewriting code!!! so didn't get to your one (and i'm still not finished with the other).\nif you want to wait for me to take a look before you continue (stop you doing something i don't accept) then by all means. i should get a chance over this weekend.\n. btw - very interested to hear your comparisons with slick grid, not just with this feature, but in general. i was not a heavy slick grid user - so am particularly interested into why you are using ag-grid over slickgrid. in my head, slickgrid is pretty dam good!!! (but as i said, i've never used it in anger).\n. i have just checked in a fix for #14, isn't this what you are looking for???\nbasically i just add a mouse wheel listener to the pinned columns, and scroll when i get notified.\n. you can't disable cellClicked for particular columns. however the callback gets a params object which tells you which column was clicked, so you can check here and just ignore when it comes from a column you don't want to listen on.\n. nope, but good idea. will see what i can do.\n. the work around is to figure it out yourself. the grid will fit the new height if you change it's height at runtime.\n. yes it will be in the grid at some point, the suggested workaround is just while your waiting for me to do it.\n. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-61. this is a duplicate of this one: https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/issues/801\nso closing. it's doing 'less than' and not 'less than or equal to', eg:\nthis is the code:\nswitch (this.filterType) {\n                case EQUALS:\n                    return valueAsNumber === this.filterNumber;\n                case LESS_THAN:\n                    return valueAsNumber < this.filterNumber;\n                case GREATER_THAN:\n                    return valueAsNumber > this.filterNumber;\n                default:\n                    // should never happen\n                    console.warn('invalid filter type ' + this.filterType);\n                    return false;\n            }\n. makes sense, this was something i fixed about 6 weeks ago.\n. > For newer versions, when I load the grid again, the size becomes smaller.\nThis is your problem. If that gets fixed, then you can come to the latest version? What do you mean by the size becomes smaller? Sounds like you are having issues sizing your div.\nPS This isn't an issue with the grid, so closing it. The best place for questions and help is on the forum :)\n. yes use headerClass - it's undocumented (i've fixed that, will be in the docs of the next release).\nput this on your colDef. works same as cellClass (ie provide a string (class), and array of strings (and array of classes), or a function that returns a string or array of strings).\n. rowBuffer in gridOptions tells how many rows past the viewable area to render. set this to a lower number to get what you want.\n. not really true. if you scroll down 5 rows, you still have to remove 5 rows and insert 5 rows, regardless of whether you use a wrapper div or not. you are just changing what the parent is. so no performance gain really.\nin addition, if you go with the wrapper approach, the order of the element becomes an issue. this introduces a small bit more complexity. i don't see a worthwhile performance gain to be had to be worth the extra complexity.\n. i only vdom each row individually. i tested inserting all the rows in one go, but i didn't observe a big enough performance increase.\n. His grid and your grid need to make a baby :)\nhahahahahahahahahahahah, dag nammit i actually laughed out loud when i read that!\ni don't have the skeleton code, i did it in a branch, then delete the branch. didn't think someone might want to use it.\nwith regards s-you's grid, yes it looks excellent. however he is also virtualising the columns, so it's not a like-for-like test. i have a big client who has 100+ columns in his reports and i will be fixing that. my plan is to virtualise the columns also.\n. done\n. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-62. are you asking on a switch, to use cellClicked on mobile, and cellDoubleClicked on desktop?\n. are you talking about clicking the header, ie for bringing up the filter menu?\nor are you talking about clicking the cells, for editing?\n. so are you doing this in your app?

Correct, selections don't stick, as the grid has no business key to identify the rows.\nAny reason you need to paginate? Ie if all rows loaded, just display in grid as normal??\n. > I suspect, going back to your first question, that if we implement client-side pagination in the first place, where the dataset is merely a collection of row data, that selections would end up being sticky anyways. Does that seem right?\nyea that would be right. although i haven't implemented it yet, it makes sense!!\n. for myself, i'm going to change the title of this to 'client side pagination'. what you ask for also makes sense in particular for mobile, where you want the user to view 'one page size' at a time, ie no scrolls at all. then the filtering / sorting comes after that.\nps this is a large amount of work, so i don't expect to get it done this year (i'm taking november and december off for holidays as this year has been particularly busy for me and i need to check myself into a long holiday!!)\n. @derekperkins noted\n. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-71. agreed\n. hi @benoror ,\nyea i don't use the chat channel any more. it was just far to distracting for me, every hour getting a help request pushed to my phone!! with the forum and github, i can spend sold time on helping when i have the time, it fits much easier into my daily planning.\nto set the header height, use the api:\napi.setHeaderHeight(newHeight)\nmentioned here btw:\nhttp://www.ag-grid.com/angular-grid-api/index.php\nand yes, setting the height to 0 is what i recommend for hiding the header.\nhave fun!!\n. @S-YOU  ta!\n. thanks, i'll take a close look when i get a few minutes to spare.\n. interesting. that is right, i'm trying to load Angular2 if i sense JSPM is available. it will result in a failed call, but the application should work anyway. i would rather not have different versions of the app if i can avoid it, so let me think if there is another way first.\n. yes that will solve it for you, but not for the person who is not using angular at all !!\n. i've just done a release. v2.3.0. this is now fixed.\nto use Angular2 with JSPM, you have to call this:\nag.grid.initialiseAgGridWithAngular2(ng2)\nbasically you pass in a reference to the ng2 library to ag-Grid, and it uses that, rather than trying to load the library itself.\ni think that's enough for now . . . . . think i'll let the dust settle with the new technologies a bit, or at least wait until i'm more familiar with them.\n. @Pedrozena what problem do you get on the forum? what email are you trying to use? i have very few emails banned, just two which were used for posting spam.\n. @Pedrozena i don't konw why that's a problem, it should be fine.\n. the grid, if configured correctly, will not load every row.\nif you ensure the following are set to reasonable values:\nmaxPagesInCache\nmaxConcurrentRequests\nif maxPagesInCache = 2, and maxConcurrentRequests = 1, and paginationPageSize = 100, and 20 rows displayed in the grid, then if you start at position 0, then page 1 is loaded, then scroll to position 2000, page 2 is loaded, but when it comes back, the last two pages in cache to be loaded are 19 and 20, so pages 19 and 20 get loaded only, nothing in between, as the LRU will have ejected the intermediary pages from the cache before they had a chance to load.\n. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-72.

See the docs for colDef options. \n. http://www.ag-grid.com/forum/showthread.php?tid=2552&highlight=comparator\ncolDef.comparator = function(valueA, valueB, nodeA, nodeB, isInverted) {\n  // do the compare here, then return either negative, positive, or zero (for equals)\n}\n. this is not a bug. the grid is sizing itself to the containing div size. the problem is that the AngularJS is not setting the height of the div until after the digest cycle has run it's course, by which time the grid is already sized.\nto work around this, change your toggle function to the below. it will get the grid to lay out after the the grid is resized by angular.\nvm.toggleGrid = function() {\n    vm.showGrid = !vm.showGrid;\n    setTimout( function(){ vm.grid.api.doLayout(); }, 0);\n  };\n. it's on my list, but not done yet. duplicate of this issue:\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/issues/87\n. thanks for the PR. i'll take a look shortly.\n. i haven't had a chance to look. the last few weeks of my life have been mental :( . . . . i've left the PR open though, in time i'll either accept this PR or have it implemented another way before closing.\n. > Is it also possible to have \"Keyboard Navigation\" properties added for custom editing like a cellRenderer for editing just like the example in the documentation? and if you press Tab it goes to the next cell that is per se cell Rendered or editable?\nthat's something i want to put it, but to do it right, i want to rework how the cellRenderers work, rather than just a function that returns something, they will need to expose an API somehow, similar to how the filters work (they return back a class with multiple methods, not just a function).\nregards your first issue, thanks for sharing. when i get time i'll look into it.\n. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-73. this is now done, will be in next release.\nwhen you finish editing (including tabbing), the grid will check the values when the value is string, number or boolean, and if value is the same, then no refresh of cell or events are fired.\nif using a newValueHandler, then you now can return true / false. return true if update was success. return false if not (ie the values are the same). if false, then no refresh or events are fired.. noted. will check when i get  time. thanks.\n. i'm supporting IE 9 in theory, but i'm not desperately trying to, i only test on the versions installed on my laptop, which are all latest versions of the browsers.\n. don't worry to much, when i go through it, l'll use the same code techniques i'm using everywhere else, so no new 'ways of doing things' will be introduced.\n. did something similar, but changed things a bit and used my internal utility class for managing css (which has my 'tired and tested' ways of working with css!!)\n. thanks for the PR.\neach cell in the grid is marked with the column id, eg from the example:\n<div col=\"2\" colid=\"language\" /*items omitted for clarity*/ >English</div>\nand then each row has the row \n<div row=\"1\" /*items omitted for clarity*/>\nwhy can't you use these in your css selector for testing?\n. i think i'd prefer something more generic. instead of asking for 'checkbox id', it should ask for 'row business key', which it would then use to tag each row (primarily) and then it could be used by the cellRenderers also for tagging stuff inside the cells.\ncurrent the cells have a business key for the cols (it's the col id).\nso the row would be something like:\n<div row=\"1\" row-id=\"pk_223\" /*items omitted for clarity*/>\nthen the checkbox would use this, like any other cell, to mark the checkbox, et:\n<input selection-id=\"pk_223\" ....\nthat would work right? and would be much more generic?\n. i have just checked in getBusinessKeyForNode(node) callback.\nDocumentation is::\nReturn a business key for the node. If implemented, then each row in the dom will have an attribute\n                <i>row-id='abc'</i> where abc is what you return as the business key. This is useful for automated\n            testing, as it provides a way for your tool to identify rules based on unique business keys.\n. yes\n. closing this as i've implemented getBusinessKeyForNode, this will be in a release i'm about to do today.\n. in summary, the grouped columns should include the group name in their header. right?\n. the second way is better suited to tools that read in csv, having the first row (only) showing headers is pretty standard.\n. nope, haven't come back to this since.\n. implementing this now, along with export to XLS. will be in next release.. done. export to xls done. csv and xls export now allow exporting column headers.. > How can I set rowsAlreadyGrouped to true asynchronously after initialization (eg. after an ajax call)?\njust change it in your grid options. then call 'setRowData(rows)' with the new rows, the property will  be used when setting up the new rows. \n\nP.S. Would you be interested in migrating the documentation to a more intuitive service like ReadMe.io? (The same way @kentcdodds did with docs.angular-formly.com  )\n\ntwo reasons for me keeping the docs the way they are:\n1) i use all the examples as regression tests for the grid. while developing, i use the docs for implementing and testing new features. i also do full regression testing by going through all my examples before releasing.\n2) for SEO, i've tight control over the docs!\nif i move to another system, then i presume i loose my first point.\n. thanks for the feedback @kentcdodds  & @benoror. i've a lot on at the moment, but will rethink all of this in the new year. i'm giving up my job, and taking a holiday for november and december, so will be back with lots of energy in the new year to take the grid to another level.\n. thanks @kentcdodds\nps pity we didn't get to meet on angular air, but you're coming to london in two weeks so will deffo get you then :)\n. this is done.. none of my examples have blank entries!! i'll need some time to look into this a bit deeper.\n. > When clearing the quick filter text box with its cross-on-the-right-of-the-text-box\nthis isn't a grid issue, that's (if using angular) angularjs not updating the scope.\n. no idea, sorry. but given it's not a grid issue, i'm not very motivated towards finding out to be honest!!\n. not a grid issue, so closing.. if i move the declarations to inside the closure, it doesn't compile with message \"error TS1184: Modifiers cannot appear here.\"\ndo you know how i can get TypeScript to reference an unknown variable like it's doing? basically it's looking to see if module and exports are provided by the wrapping commonjs (browsersify??) code. because i don't use these myself, i can't test this.\n. done. i've moved to node.d.ts\n. > Looking forward to this getting into DefinitelyTyped and to your AngularConnect talk\nyou going to Angular Connect?\n. lets see if they invite me back to ng-Conf after my talk at Angular Connect!!!\n. don't think it would of worked anyway. you declared a new variable, what is needed is to use the variable that the commonjs framework provides.\n. same here, this wont work. it needs to reference the variable provided by commonjs, not declare a new one.\nthese mean different things:\ndeclare var i; // tell typescript about a variable that already exists, so no compile errors.\nvar i; // declare a new variable\n. i've just checked in a fix for this, i've moved to using node.d.ts\n. you want to specify defaults for the Col Defs ??\n. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-74.

Fair point. I guess I was saying, don't give up just because of no hyperlinks!! \nBtw there is a forum on my website. Many more questions there than on stack overflow!! And yup, each question suggests a hole in the docs!! Is hard though, even best written docs will cause some questions. \n. I've just come back from Angular connect - where I learnt that the Angular team don't want you to do direct dom manipulation and won't don't intend for you to be using the compile service in Angular 2. That's not going to be good!!\n. i am wondering - what if i added the ability for you to provide a dom element instead of html string for the overlay - would that work? that way, it would be generic, you could provide an angular bound element, or anything for that matter, my grid wouldn't care what framework you are using! thoughts?\n. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-76. this doesn't make sense. the error \"was not able to find element\" is printed from the angularGridGlobalFunction method. this method is not called by anywhere in the ag-Grid code, it is intended to be called when you want to use the grid outside of AngularJS.\nso i'm thinking this is not an issue with the grid, rather something you are doing wrong on your end???\n. it's open, but i don't use webpack, so it's not something easy for me to look into.\n. thanks @chiptus, does that mean we can close this issue?\n. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-77. width is meant to be a number only, no %. this is because of, as you guess, the resizing. i want complete control of the pixel widths for the cells. also am sure it would cause issues for pinning or other stuff going forward as i enhance the features.\nany reason you cannot use api.sizeColumnsToFit()???\nin the future, i plan to allow 'weights' on the columns (will work similar to %), but that's still in my plan.\n. A 'stretch' animation while resizing??? Or they adjust after the resize? \n. great thanks!!!\ni was in the middle of trying to figure it out\n. checked in, closing.\n. sorry, i'll try and stop doing what you want to do just before you do it :)\n. true. thanks.\n. will be in next release\n. i believe this is fixed in the latest. i've decided against this as:\n1) makes the grid code a bit more complex\n2) there is a workaround\n3) it isn't the style elsewhere in the grid\n4) the grid is more object oriented than functional styled, this tends more towards functional. i'm not comfortable mixing the two!\n. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-78. now done. next release will have new Header Component and Header Group Component - allowing the header and header groups to work similar to how cellRenderer is currently working. interesting. will take me a while to look into this, but i'll get to it in time. thanks for the suggestion.\n. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-79. +1 . . . . will get to it in time\n. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-80. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-81. looks like the default agg function doesnt' use value getters.\n. this is fixed in v3 branch and will be part of v3.\njust need to be careful, your valueGetter needs to be aware if it's a group or not, as the group will have the aggregated value in the field you provide eg:\n{headerName: \"Total\", field: \"totalAgg\", valueGetter: \"node.group ? data.totalAgg : data.gold + data.silver + data.bronze\", width: 100}\n. it's sounds like your trying to print a json version of the data structure. and yes, there is a circular reference, but that's just how the grid works. it was no my intention to convert the structure to json.\nmy advice would be don't convert it to json :(\n. This is an angular issue outside the grid. Yes the digest is kicked off from inside the grid, but it's your bindings that causes this. The grid itself doesn't use angular (it just exposes the scope for you to use), so i'm 99.99% sure it's not the grid. Google the problem with respect to angular eg:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/17116114/how-to-troubleshoot-angular-10-digest-iterations-reached-error\n. ps i'm going to stop checking issues soon, i'm doing last minute prep before my holidays!\n. oh dear, it's a problem with you using angular.equal method! the fix assumes you are using this, and ties the grid to 'designed for angular' making use of the angular dollar notation. currently the grid internally doesn't have any anugular assumptions.\ni think what you need to do, is accept that the graph inside ag-Grid has circular dependencies, so your method of comparing doesn't work.\nwhat you could do cope the ag-Grid model into something that works for you, removing the 'parent' reference???\n. hold on, lets just step back a moment, why are you watching the model?\nif you are looking for changes in the grid model, it provides a callback for this, it's the modelUpdated event.\ndoing a watch on the model just sounds like a bad idea to me, you should be using the interface that the grid provides. if the interface into the grid isn't sufficient for your needs, then this needs to be fixed. so i'd like to understand why you need to 'angular watch' and not use the event above.\nps i thought you were printing the model to json, not using angular watch, in the above!!\n. pps i'm about to get back to my holiday!!\n. thanks @benoror, so many threads to follow, i can forget the details of all the threads.\ni haven't used angular-formly, so would need to read up on it to understand the problem fully. but if it's doing a watch on an object that has circular dependency, then yes that's a problem. but the grid doesn't put the model onto the scope, so where is this getting put on the scope?\n@kentcdodds please let us know if you have any advice here - should a non-angular component like ag-Grid be working seamlessly with angular-formly, or does angular-formly have some rules that must be abided?\n. good to get this one sorted in a non-intrusive (to the code) fashion!!! thanks.\n. selectedRows no longer exists on grid options.\nplease check the 2.x migration guide\nhttp://www.ag-grid.com/upgrading_to_2.x/index.php\n. one scope per row is done on purpose, to keep the grid extremely fast.\nif you need isolated scope per cell, you will need to introduce your own directive to be used inside the cell.\n. maybe you need to set selection to multiple??\nps if it's a question or an issue in your client code, please use the forum, github should be kept for issues inside the grid.\n. rowSelection    Type of row selection, set to either 'single' or 'multiple' to enable selection.\n. this is working on the latest. it's an old issue form last year, the selection has undergone a lot of work since then. if you are on the latest, and still broken, please give details on how to reproduce and i can take a look. however i tested it just now on the main demo page (i called selectAll() after setting the row data, and all events are getting fired).\n. @ckiss because it's not using enterprise version of ag-grid, just the free version. clipboard is an enterprise feature.\n. if you are using range selection, then this gets preference. even if the range is one cell.\ncan you turn range selection off? then try?\n. range selection is off by default.\nthe example you provided had range on, so maybe a bad example.\ni updated the main demo page (just locally) and turned off range selection and i was not able to reproduce this, only selected rows get copied.\n. on the main demo page, i took out range selection, then put the following in:\nsetTimeout( function() {\n    gridOptions.api.selectAll();\n}, 2000);\nafter selection happens, i then click on a cell (so it gets focus) and hit ctrl+c, and it works.\nmaybe you don't have browser focus on the grid? in which case, it doesn't get the ctrl+c command.\notherwise, i can't reproduce this, please provide a plunker to take it further.\n. Is the grid in the dom and on the page? The width will return 0 if grid has no width (yet). Try putting you call into a timeout.\n. eBody IS ag-body, this is my code:\nthis.eBody = this.queryHtmlElement('.ag-body');\nso i don't know how your getting this.eBody!==document.querySelector('.ag-body')\n.

Thanks for pr. Will review when back from holidays.\n. Hi. Thanks for your compliments. \ud83d\ude0a\nAs this is a question, it should be on the forum, issues are for items that need fixing in the grid. So will close.\nThis sounds like a gerenal 'grid taking to long' question. Usually this is due to grid height not set and the grid is trying to render far more rows than are visible in your browser. This can happen if no height is set on the grid. Please can you verify this? Make sure height is set on the grids div. If using % height, please test with pixels as % can fail based on your parents CSS layout.\nPS if you can move to the forum please. You will prob get help there from others as that's where the community hangs out. I am travelling right now so don't get online often.\n. If you modify the pageSize to 5\n-> don't modify the pageSize to 5!!\nwhat's wrong with the tutorial?\nthis grid is USELESS!\n-> go use anther grid then!\n. re page size, it comes down to maths.\nif the pageSize is 5, and the maxPagesInCache is 2, then the total number of rows in the cache is 10 rows (5 x 2). so if your grid can display 40 rows on the screen (pretty normal) then your cache isn't big enough to hold one displayed set of data, thus the cache keeps trashing trying to load the rows.\nthe grid also renders some rows above and below the screen as a buffer (default is 20 each way) which you need to consider also.\nso in summary, if you reduce the page size, you need to ensure you still have a cache size (pageSize x pagesInCache) big enough to hold enough rows to render your grid.\n. what do you mean by the tutorial doesn't work? what is wrong with it?\n. I tried the tutorial and sometimes I encountered an infinite-loop\nthe tutorial doesn't use server side paging, so the infinite loop must be something else???\n. i wasn't programming with 'zoom out' in mind, so yes, virtual pagination breaks, if you zoom out far enough.\n. yup, that's so. i wasn't expecting the grid to grow in 'number of rows' at runtime.\n. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-85. use a valueGetter and handle this in your client code. if it was left blank, you could have three blank groups (null, undefined, empty string) with no way of knowing why the duplicate, so solving this problem in the grid just creates another one!\n. what you are looking for can be achieved using javascript in a few ways, bind and closure come to mind.\neg closure:\n```\nfunction myComparator(type) {\n  return function(valA, valB, nodeA, nodeB, inInverted) {\n    // here you have all the items you need\n    if (type=='myType') {\n       // do comparison\n    } else {\n       // do another type of comparison\n    }\n  }\n}\n// then assign\ncolDef.comparator = myComparator('myType');\n```\n. issues are for issues with the grid. this is a question so am closing. please use the forum for questions :)\n. as with @DrCool, you need to listen to the events and add your own logic to deselect rows if more than what you want is selected.\nplease post questions on the forum :)\n. please post questions on the forum :)\n. this is not an issue with the grid. closing!\n. bug accepted. will get fixed when back from my holidays.\n. i tried reproducing this on my latest, and can't. is it still a problem?\ni went to Apply Function example on this page:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/angular-grid-filtering/index.php\ni filtered on athlete with 'y' and it worked fine.\ncan this be closed??\n. cool, fixed. will be in next release. string has a lastIndexOf method, made fixing easy!\n. this is because the set filter needs a string key for a value, as it stores the selected values in a map using the standard javascript object, and javascript objects use strings (only) as keys for the map. the javascript object is used for performance reasons, for large sets.\nif you want to use the set filter for dates, then the easiest is to create a valueGetter and return strings for the dates. this will get the filtering working. then for the sorting, provide your own comparator that converts the strings back to dates.\nor you can create your own filter for dates. you will need to build this yourself and have it so it doesn't use the javascript object.\n. I won't be making any relevent code changes before looking at this pr, which may not be until the end of the year!\n. Each cell and header div has additional attributes to indicate the column. So what you need to do is use CSS to style the individual column.\nAdditionally, you can use cellStyle and cellClass for individual cells. These are specified on the colDef.\n. Set suppressRowClickSelection=true, then add your own functionally to row clicks. Use the api for selection.\n. I think you are looking more for a complete end-to-end reporting application rather than a gui grid???!!! Not sure this request fits in what I was aiming for. Any examples or further explanation of what you mean??\n. ah right, i got mixed up with what pivot meant. so basically you want lazy loading of the child groups. yes i'll get that in at some point. i'll rename this issue.\nre PR, i probably won't accept a PR on this, as it's core to the workings of the grid, so i'll prob have my own ideas on how this should be done with regards the rest of the grid.\n. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-86. this is now done, part of the Enterprise Row Model.

Will check when back from holidays.\n. i'm confused, the mouse wheel is working or scrolling or me. are people saying the mouse wheel scrolling is not working for IE ?\n. so it's fixed in latest?\n. i spent a while looking into this and cant get it to work.\nbasically i coded up the below in gridPanel.ts (replacing the method of the same name):\nprivate addMouseWheelEventListeners(): void {\n        let leftListener = (event: WheelEvent) => {\n            var newEvent = new WheelEvent(event.type, event);\n            this.eBodyViewport.dispatchEvent(newEvent);\n            event.preventDefault();\n            return false;\n        };\n        this.addDestroyableEventListener(this.ePinnedLeftColsViewport, 'mousewheel', leftListener);\n    }\ni expected that the mouse event would be applied to the eBodyViewport. although the event is received (if i add a mousewheel listener to eBodyViewport, it gets called) but it doesn't have any impact on the eBodyViewport, no scrolling happens.\nanyone any ideas?. @ychailler the suggested solution does not work. see here:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/35526092/does-dispatchevent-trigger-default-handler\nbasically when you do this this.eBodyViewport.dispatchEvent(newEvent); is it not a trusted event, so the mouse scroll is not processed by the browser.\npity, it seemed like a very elegant solution, but unfortunately doesn't work. closing issues as suggestion doesn't work.. Thanks for raising. Will check when back from holiays.\n. this will never work - as the chrome search will only search what is rendered in the dom. the solution would be for us to implement our own search for the grid.. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-88. tracked by AG-60 (88 was a dupe). thanks for raising. will fix when back from holidays.\n. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-89\n. thanks for raising. fixing the hover & pinned cols is something i intend fixing when i'm back from holidays.\n. my holidays only finished today. i'll be looking at everything soon.\n. no update.\n. no update\n. no. i've lots of people asking me to fix / add things and i'm giving priority to people who are paying me money.\n. can you ping me an email on accounts@ag-grid.com\nthanks :)\n. this was fixed a few months ago. now ag-row-hover class is added to row when mouse is hovered over it.\n. now ag-row-hover class is added to row when mouse is hovered over it.\nthis has nothing to do with the hover style!!! stop trying to use the hover style. use the ag-grow-hover class instead.\nsee the provided material theme, it makes use of it.\n. correct, this is with pinned columns. the group row has two parts, one for the pinned part, one for the non pinned part. you are also right, with the way pinning is implemented, it is not possible to fix this.\n. with the introduction of fullWidth rows, this is now gone.. thanks for raising. will fix when i get back, should be no others, i didnt' intend leaving that one out.\n. done. suppressEvents is no longer supported, stop listening for the event if you no longer want it. noted. thanks.\n. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-90. i've implemented this. will be in the next release.\n. what do you mean by it does not resize?\nare you talking about resizing the columns? or the table itself not sizing it's width/height correctly?\n. so it looks like the grid is getting clipped on the right hand side, as it thinks it's bigger than the screen width???\nyou are using web components right? so you have an ag-grid element, and you are not using a div element.\nin web components, the ag-grid element extends the div element, so it should inherit all the div properties, including the width. the grid should then fit the element that's its inside.\nbut web components are an emerging standard, with multiple implementations, so i'm not sure what's happening.\ntry putting width directly onto the ag-grid element, using style, ie style=\"width: 500px\". first try with fixed pixel, then try with 100% (the default for divs, which ag-grid element should be using)\nyou can also try api.doLayout() to get the grid to lay out again. but i'm guessing this is not the problem, as the grid checks this every 500ms anyway.\n. Still doesn't make sense. The grid checks this every 500ms, not just when you show/hide tool panel. Without a plunker, I have nothing to troubleshoot.\nHave you tried calling api.doLayout() ?\n. no activity in 6 weeks so closing\n. can you demonstrate this in a plunker? hands are a bit tied without something to troubleshoot!\n. checking the demo here: https://www.ag-grid.com/example.php\nwhen you resize the browser, the grid does resize.. No this is not a known issue.\nAre you saying the example is broken? The example is working for me.\n. What you see is expected. For a selection set, change the filter type to set, not number.\n. Set your own comparator on the colDef. Sort whatever way you wish!!\n. http://www.ag-grid.com/angular-grid-column-definitions/index.php\nJust attach your comparator function to the colDef. You are only concerned with the first two parameters, as nodes are only relevant when sorting the data rows (the filter has values, not rows).\n. yes (90% sure)\n. I've changed colDef.field so now you can have deep values eg colDef.field = 'person.firstName'.\nThis cannot call functions like the proposed, however this is exactly what valueGetter is for, so not sure of the point in doing it again here.\n. All parts of code should use valueGetter if it's there. Sorting and Filtering use the value getter. This is something I added along the way, maybe it has changed since you last saw the code??\n. yes if you have all the data, then i agree, should just give all the data to the grid and let the grid sort it out. it's on my todo list.\n. sorry, can't commit. i'm full up getting the following two features in a) bid data view and b) enhanced editing.\n. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-91. thanks for raising\ncomponent.setGridOptions is a function whilst component.columnDefs (etc) are ES6 setters\n-> what difference does thsi make?\nare you just talking about the code style, in that setGridOptions is a function, however the properties are just properties (which i just happen to implement as setters?)\n. ah right, i understand. i thought setGridOptions was on the api, but it is not. so your right (i think), it should have no 'set' in it's name. (unless in was in the api, but then it's not a web component property)\n. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-92. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-93. am looking at this for a few hours now. thought i'd give an update on thoughts:\n- on a whole, very happy with the quality. i'm not decided yet if i'll work with the branch, or code from scratch myself and take influence from the branch. i like coding myself because then my brain fully understands everything that's going on, where i would copy/paste items from the branch. if i do this, it is no way in disrespect of the provided quality code, just me taking extra time to make sure every line of code is scrutinised!!\n- as a whole, the new code fits nicely with the rest of the code. looks like a lot of work has gone into it. it is also very helpful for me as reading your code i get better understanding of the problem, i can learn from the thinking you have put into it.\n- some reference to colDef.pinned in the code, but colDef has no such property!\n- the code to work out the pinning is a bit complex. it is on my plan to change how pinning works (to have a pin attribute on the colDef as on of {left,right}. i am considering implementing the change in pinning first before the new grouping of cols.\n- i think the ability to reorder the cols is now gone when grouping the cols. is this right? i'm thinking about how this would/should work.\n- the grid as a whole needs refactoring how it sets itself up. the dependencies between the modules are complex when grid is initialising. i'm thinking of doing some refactoring around this area. this may help (or impact) how the columnController is implemented.\n. i've finished this now in the v3 branch. the interface is very similar to what you have done, however i have done a LOT of refactoring around the column controller. basically, i've reworked all the foundations, to allow bringing the new functionality to be easier. in particular:\n- columns and groups are now both 'ColumnGroupChild' objects, which means the column controller now works with trees of ColumnGroupChild objects. the tree dept can be 1 or more (1 meaning no column groups), which means there is now just one set of code, regardless of grouping columns or not.\n- introduced concept of 'OriginalColumns' (similar to what was in this PR) and DisplayedColumns. The displayed columns take into account ordering of the cols, and also break the groups up if column movement means the group needs to be split. the logic of knowing 'do these cols beside each other belong in the same group' took me a long time to get right.\ni've done pretty much nothing else apart from this over the past few days. it's taken me a lot longer than i hoped!! but the result now has it coded elegantly (i was constantly refactoring) and works with all parts of the grid (moving columns, pinning, master/slave etc).\nthanks for the time on the original PR. it was helpful for my learning and pushing the grid in the right direction. i'll be releasing v3 in the coming days (if not this week, deffo next week).\n. this would end up with calling the server for the entire set of data, as you don't have the data to hand, right?\nmaybe the datasource would need a 'get all data' method, rather than pulling back a page at a time.\n. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-94. the latest in git works with angular 2 beta 0. i just haven't done a release yet. it will be in the next release.\n. i've just released. the latest works with angular 2 beta 0.\n. the above code snippets look fine. it depends on what your data is as to why it's not working i think.\nif you want help further, then can i suggest you recreate the problem in a plunker? without having a working example to troubleshoot, there is not much more i can do.\nps i'm closing the issue, as i want to keep issues for items wrong with the grid. for help on using the grid, the forum is the preferred location.\n. Does ag-grid have a way to specify a custom separator character?\nright now, no it doesn't.\n. latest version has export to Excel supported, so should be able to use this.. the problem is probably your grid is not displayed on the screen when you are calling sizeColunnsToFit for the first time. this is a common problem. because it's not visible, the grid does not know what width it is, so can't work out the column sizes.\nto get around this, put your sizeColumnsToFit call into a timeout.\n. This is because IE 9 doesn't implement the CSS spec correctly. It works in other browsers and later versions of IE.\nAs it's fixed in later IE (and Edge) I am slow to fix.\nTo get around this, you can use the property suppressNoRowsOverlay, and then if you want you can provide your own message to the user somewhere that doesn't block the grid.\n. duplicate of https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/issues/159\n. The renderer params has eGridCell. This is the cell div that you should be adding your listeners onto.\nActually it's a virtual element (part of my home backed virtual dom) but that doesn't matter, it has an addEventListener method that you can call, that will add the listener to the div when it is rendered.\n. answered here:\nhttp://www.ag-grid.com/forum/showthread.php?tid=3056&highlight=onGroupExpandedOrCollapsed\n. $scope.gridOptions.api.SelectIndex doesn't work with datasource\ni just test this, it does work.\ni tested using this virtual pagination example online and selected the first index after the first page was loaded.\nps am closing this issue. if still an problem for you, can you reproduce in a plunker? then raise it on the forum? (the issues should be for when items are broken in the grid)\n. i can't reproduce this here.\nhttp://localhost/angular-grid-pagination/pagingServerSide.html\ni debugged thought the code, and when no sort is applied, the sortModel array is empty.\nso i'm guessing something is wrong with your code?\n. yes, it fires because of the virtual scrolling. the grid will only render the rows that are visible inside the scrollable area.\nyou could turn this off by setting the rowBuffer property to be something huge, any number larger than the number of rows in your grid. that way, the grid will always render all the rows, but you run the risk of having a slow grid.\n. Yes please read the documentation.\n. The default behaviour for the filters is to clear when new data is loaded. To override this, you add the property: newRowsAction: 'keep'\nFor example, in the test drive, \"Country\" and \"Language\" have this set, but \"Game of Choice\" does not. So when you set filters in these three columns, then reload the data (eg change the number of rows), then two of the three columns keep the filters, but the last gets cleared.\nIf you are not experiencing this, then something mush be wrong in your code? Can you provide a plunker? (otherwise i'm nothing to work on)\n. thanks for the pr. i'm going to have to put time aside to go through this and think it through.\n. pining columns to the right is new functionality i've introduced in v3. you can check out the latest in that branch, or wait for v3 release in the coming days.\nby the way, i didn't run this PR, i had a quick look at the code. when i implemented, i got into problems getting it working with floating header and footer, and also grouping (plus the new multi-level grouping). in addition, the columnController has been totally re-factored to be easier to understand and support the multi-level of grouping - you might be interested in taking a look!\n. i guess this is related to the issue here:\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/issues/601\nbut as with comment on that issue, i don't see what this does or why it's needed.\n. noted.\n. we haven't started working on it in ag-Grid. it is on the list though and pretty high priority.\n. will be starting this next week.. working on it, no more +1's needed!!!!!!. getting there, it's no way finished, just wanted to post this img so you can see i am actually working on it!!\n\n. @aelbatal i don't set the scrollbar onto the left,  it is the browser that is doing this. if i was to keep the panels LTR but the contents RTL, which would be very confusing for me to program (can of worms with all the scrolls in the system) so i'd rather keep it simple. if i was to introduce such complexity in to the grid, i'd rather put this complexity towards solving something else.. when you use 'groupUseEntireRow' then then columns don't get rendered for the group row.\nif you want to show your aggregate data, do one of the following:\n1) do NOT use groupUseEntireRow\n2) provide your own groupRowInnerRenderer (see here http://www.ag-grid.com/angular-grid-grouping/index.php)\n. then you are describing the default behaviour? which is groupUseEntireRow=false (or leave this property out)\nif there is no data, then the cell will be blank (for non aggregated columns)\nif you want to display data under the right columns, then why do you want to groupUseEntireRow??\n. The groupUseEntireRow property achieved this\n--> no it doesn't, this property groupUseEntireRow doesn't remove columns\nif you don't want a column to appear then:\n1) you can hide it (colDef.hide=true), you can still pivot by the hidden column\n2) you can groupHidePivotColumns=true, this will remove the columns you pivot by, hence removing teh duplication\n. like this:\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/bujo8Z?p=preview\ni changed the field of the group col here:\ngroupColumnDef: {\n                    headerName: 'Category',\n                    field: 'Currency',\n                    cellRenderer: {\n                        renderer: 'group'\n                    }\n                },\nand i also removed the value column as you didn't want it.\n. You have set the height to 100% without setting a height for the parent div.\nThis is nothing to do with the grid, but how you are using css. If you are using % height, then you need to be careful to set the height in the containing div also.\nPlease set the height in pixels first (eg to 500px) on your grid, to see if that fixes it. Then you can play with the % on your page to get that working also.\n. To deselect nodes, use the deselectNode API, et:\ngridOptions.api.deselectNode(node);\nThe second parameter for selectNode is whether you want to support multi selection or not.\nSo the grid is working, you are just not using the right API.\n. what are you trying to achieve here? it is possible to suppress resize on each column via the columnDef, so i don't see what the advantage is here. if no clear advantage, i'd rather keep it simple.\n. thanks for info. i'll have to think about it. the implementation of 'preventDefault' i don't think is correct. the grid generates the event after it has finished processing. similar to 'click' evet, that's created by the dom, you cannot pretend the click never happened or undo the click, you can just stop other consumers from consuming, however the grid isn't a consumer of the event.\nthere is a part of the code that checks the new size fits within the allowed min and max sizes. maybe something can be put in there.\n. Thanks for the info. I've just checked in these changes. I took influence from you comments and your pull request, however I made the change myself as I wanted to go through the trial and error of learning Angular 2 - also I don't want to support older versions. All along, as different alphas were coming out, I was programming to the latest as changes happened. If I was to support all the alphas and betas, the code would be just to messy for no real gain.\n. npm rules, really? what is the rule?\nso if i want to make a change that is not backward compatible, which part of the version number am i allowed to change?\n. thanks. will take a look.\n. @Bodom78  thanks for the welcome back!!!\nAs a workaround, you can consider using cellClassRules, as far as i remember, it is more robust with regards adding / removing classes.\neg cellClassRules = {\n   'my-class-black-background': 'true' // expression is true, ie always use this class\n}\n. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-95. release of 4.1.x saw improved editing. Enter in ag-Grid is to start / stop editing. Excel doesn't have this 'start editing' feature. So in the grid I'm not going to copy Excel for this particular item.\n. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-96. this was fixed in v3 release.\n. does putting a width in the column definitions prohibit this function from working\n-> no, the sizeToFit works with the widths. this is nice, as you can have a 'best guess' as the provided widths, then calling the function will spread the extra space evenly, so somehow keeping the relative widths.\ni can't suggest why it's not working for you. as you point out, the biggest problem with this for other people is the grid is not visible at the time of calling. what you could do is debug through the code - at one point the code gets the grids width - this comes back as zero if the grid is not visible. you can see if this is happening for you. if not, and still broken, then for me to help further i'd need to see it recreated in a plunker.\n. Thanks for closing.  :) \n. Sorry, I don't follow what you mean by 'all records under that group fall under the same sort'. Maybe explain an example using the test drive data???\nRe proving the data sorted - yes you could do that - but that's not what I intended. The grid should sort.\nYou can provide your own comparator to the colDef. So if you provide a comparator to the grouping colDel (just make sure your not using the grids default provided colDef) then you can do the sorting whatever way you want when the use clicks the group header.\n. cool, thanks for all the positive feedback. re the blank row - you can implement that yourself with a footer. just assign a different floatingCellRenderer to each column, and instead of rendering the row, have your own custom text field always displayed.\nyes the plan was not to use Angular on the inside of the grid. this should make things easier for you. it also means you are not tied to Angular (even if you are an Angular person, this means you are free to hop between Angular 1 and Angular 2).\n. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-97. afraid that's not trivial. the widths of the columns are specified in pixels so that the grid can have full control of the grid widths. this is needed to, for example, to keep the grid headers in sync with the grid cells, also to have full control on column widths which is important for column groups, etc. this gets again more complex with pinned columns, floating rows, master/slave grids, etc.\nThe main problem is that you cannot have columns that change their widths.\nwhat are you trying to achieve? if you want the grid to fit the screen, you can use api.sizeColumnsToFit(). if you want to do something else, then what are you trying to do? i'd rather consider a solution that doesn't rely on css for layout.\n. those are fair points, and ones i'd like to consider without using css.\ni've created an issue that's more specific:\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/issues/627\nMoreover, when I resize the window, if I expand it the grid is resized, but if I shrink the window it doesn't resize and the window horizontal scrollbar appears.\nthis doesn't sound right. the online test drive resizes fine when the browser resizes, so something must be wrong in your code. if you can reproduce in a plunker i can take a look.\n. I don't use flexbox so I can't comment.\n. thanks for the vid. that is strange, that should be working.\n. should make no difference.\nnice use of the grid btw. is that on a public facing website or internal?\n. good spot. i've check in a fix to trunk. i will be releasing in the next few days if you can wait.\nthanks for all the work investigating this. i'm pretty busy these days with the enterprise release!!\n. v7 has had a lot of changes with ng2 in ag-grid. if still an issue in v7, please raise in the ag-grid-ng2 project. correct, the column API does.\nhowever you don't have to call this.\ninstead call the method of similar name on the grid api (gridOptions.api.sizeColumnsToFit). this takes no parameter and works out the width of the grid.\n. \"Is it merged in the current version?\"-> no\n\"And also: is the \"gridSizeChanged\" event invoked also after the first rendering?\" -> yes\n. @armuell you should use the 'gridReady' event, and put the call in there.\nsee second example on this page:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-refresh/index.php\n. @dtslvr \nautoSizeColumns(keys) takes a list of columns keys to autosize. you need to provide this list.\nnote it will only autosize columns that are rendered, so if using column virtualisation (the default), only cols visible by the horizontal scroll will be autosized.\n. closing as this can and should be done in onGridReady. i've considered this in my mind, however onGridReady is exactly for calling the grids api after the grid is initialised. have different properties for different permutations of what one might call on the grid after it's ready would add to many redundant property methods and add to noise.\n. \"onGridReady is called too early. Would be good to have an api which fires when data is provided.\"\n=> then call sizeColsToFit() after you set the data. if you are using a framework (React or Angular etc) then you need to call it after they have done their update cycle. \n. ok,noted. thanks :)\n. the only docs i have are what i've put on the website. which widths are you talking about? the column widths or the grid width?\n. most of the above are divs, and they don't recalculated, they are 100% width (the default for div). if they are recalculated, it is not in via CSS classes, it is done by changing the style directly on the component via javascript.\n- ag-root -> div 100%\n  - ag-body -> div 100%\n    - ag-body-container -> width set via javascript fit all cols, is in a scrolling container so scrolls will appear if needed\n      - ag-row // same as ag-body-container, set via javascript to fit all cols. scrolling not needed as width will match the parent width\n        - ag-cell // with set via javascript to width defined in coldef\n. the Angular 2 \"version\" is just a think wrapper over the grid - shouldn't be impacting anything to do with layout.\n. I have implemented the new event onGridSizeChanged. This allows you now to do this without needed a custom ag-Grid. I'm purposely keeping the logic out of the grid as I want the grid to be extendible more than I want it to support every single feature.\n. if you create a pull request, it will stand a better chance of been included. however no promises. i plan on implementing draggable columns in the coming weeks and will be taking my time to implement a full solution.\n. the latest relesat 3.3.3 has it\n. used here\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/blob/master/src/ts/headerRendering/renderedHeaderCell.ts\n. This has the added benefit of smaller download sizes for everyone\n-> not really. the code for each of them is about 1% of the total code base, so the reduced size won't really add anything.\nwith regards the dependencies and order of loading, yes that makes sense. i'll keep that in mind.\n. this was done early in 2016. Use colDef.headerClass - Class to use for the cell. Can be string, array of strings, or function.\n. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-98. dragging columns is now supported.\n. that's a personal choice for the developers of the project, which then boils down to a personal choice or me!!!\npersonally I don't like code checkers as I find I'm able to write quality code without them. such checkers are useful when you have weaker developers contributing, however I'm not accepting large contributors with the grid (just some small changes, any large change goes through very big code reviews by me and normally gets rewritten anyway). we used similar in work last year and I found them frustrating!!\n. thanks for all the valuable feedback, i welcome it all. i need to be balanced and appreciate the world has more experience that me. i've taken your points on board.\n. yea i'm trying to get tests under way. spent a few hours on it yesterday then got annoyed with trying to configure it all. i'm very versed with testing from other languages. in javascipt, everything is so much more messey to get set up. how the hell to do i test typescript but use javacscript then integrate with node and gulp and then get grid modules loaded ahhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!! i'll get back to it again soon, but i had to move on and focus on features again as i was getting to bogged down. but yes, deffo, project is to large now, tests are needed.\n. i was trying plain javascript tests against ag-grid.js generated file. i was caling jasmine directly from gulp using gulp-jasmine, which i understand doesn't require a test runner. i got stuck (annoyed) and left it. when i get my column work done, i'll get back to it.\n. get/set sort state can already be done via it's own api. this isn't part of the main column get/set state as it isn't managed by the columnController (inside my code). i'll keep this issue open as i may refactor to get it responsible, then the main get/set state will do this also.\n. no, makes sense. column controller should do it all. just the evolutionary nature of the design is why it's the way it is now.\n. see \"Saving / Restoring State, Sort and Filter\" at bottom of this page:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-column-api/\nthis is the preferred way of getting and saving the sort order.\nwe could change the design, however given it's the way it is now, changing the design would be a breaking change for people, so am leaving sleeping dogs lie.. I don't see anything wrong. In the plunker, the grid is showing with 5 or so rows and a scroll.\nUsing dev tools, I manually change the div height from 100% to 500px, and this works fine also.\n. afraid not :(\n. i'm not sure what you are expecting. you don't have any height specified for the grid, but you say you want 100% height. in the dev tools, i set \"height: 500px;\" for the grid div, and it resizes fine. when it put it to 100%, ie resizes past the screen, but that's normal if you don't have height set appropriately in other parts of your application.\n. it's a race condition in the gulp file. just run the gulp build a second time, it should solve it. basically i wasn't aware that gulp dependencies get executed in parallel.\n. yes, either:\na) provide the data to the grid already grouped (like the file explorer does). that way, you put whatever you like into the group fields. (ps - i've not used this with paging before, so I'm only 75% sure it will work, but good chance it will work without issues)\nb) provide your own 'groupAggFunction' - although it will be provided with all the nodes to group, you just ignore that and get your results from somewhere else.\n. +1\n. in the mean time, consider using setState\n. fixing it now in v3 anyway, so not to worry\n. now fixed in v3 branch. will be releasing that in the coming days.\n. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-99. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-100. this is a duplicate of same on the forum. the forum is the preferred place to ask questions so closing this one. thanks..\n. correct, you cannot do aggregation when using virtual pagination. this is by design, as if the grid doesn't have all of the data in memory (the reason why you are using virtual pagination) then it cannot aggregate.\nthis applies for virtual pagination, not normal paging, as normal paging will aggregate the current page.\n. i cannot reproduce this. however this might be an issue with an older version of ie. i've fixed (by doing formatting in another way). please check when i do the next release.\n. sorry vladimir, i'm not going to do this! you can achieve this by listening for the events and implementing yourself. i'm gearing away from angular specific stuff and focusing on the agnostic. that way, i allow the hooks (in this case the column resize event) for you to get deep with angular.\n. tool panel shows the groups. this must of been raised before this was implemented.. please check the forum, this question has already been asked.\nthere is an api:\napi.getRowModel().getVirtualRowCount()\n. can't accept this change, it breaks the toolPanel, which also uses the popup service for displaying the aggField values. the method is also used by BorderLayout, but I'm not sure of the implications of it there.\n. any side effect of including \"\\ufeff\" ?\nany webpage reference i can read to understand why this is needed?\n. i'm afraid if i put it in, it will cause issues for other people!!\ni think i'll stick it in as an option :)\nthanks.\n. Replaced with getDisplayedCenterColumns(), getDisplayedLeftColumns(), getDisplayedRightColumns()\n(the last one i just stuck in now, about to release)\ni'll update the docs.\nthe old method no longer made sense in the new way i implemented pinning.\n. fixing this now. will have release in 5 min.\n. this is now released in 3.1.1\n. you can navigate the selected cell, and then select the row with space bar.\n. what if i added a css class to the focused cell, then you could add background color to that class. that get what you want?\n. current cell already done, it has the ag-cell-focus class when focused and ag-cell-no-focus when not focused\n. i've just implemented adding ag-row-no-focus and ag-row-focus to the rows. it will be in the the next release, which will be early next week.\n. @Ruud-cb you could use cellFocused to know when a cell is navigated onto. however that would also fire when user clicks on a cell, maybe that is ok?\nre what you quote above, the cellRenderer gets the grids div object, so you can add whatever listener you want to the cell.\n. @Ruud-cb such a property would work - but i have turned down a lot of similar requests around selection. basically the grid offers a simple selection that works, if you want something different, then use the api.\nthe reason for this is open source projects can become a mess as everyone contributes what hey want a particular item to do. so then what happens is a product that has every possibly combination of feature under the sun, difficult to understand, and then breaks with bugs. so the ag-Grid philosophy is the opposite, i do not want to implement anything than (approx) <20% of users would use, instead allow it to be extendable.\n. you should use rowNode.setSelected(true/false)\nif you have the index, but not the rowNode, then you can look up the rowNode via api.getModel().getRow(index)\n. i don't understand what you mean. as long as everything is one in one VM turn, then there should be no flicker, as DOM updates are all done at the end.\n. you are selecting in a different VM turn by the looks of it.\nselect the row you want selected directly after calling api.setRowData(), it's a synchronous call, so once it has returned, the grid has all the data set up and ready that you provided it.\nor us the new insert rows api\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-insert-remove/index.php\n. no that doesn't exist. if you wanted to implement that, you can do it by implementing your own cell renderer. then keep track of all the currently displayed cells yourself and switch them all to edit mode.\n. damit!!! ok thanks. i've fixed the docs. website will get updated on next release.\n. i also put a check in against undefined.\n. #1 - mistake in the docs, i've just fixed it, it should be columnRowGroupChanged\n2 - the event has a 'finished' flag, set to true when the resizing is complete.\n. About the #2, could there be a possibility to mantain the size of the resized column? (as the method resizes all the columns)\nsorry? i don't understand?\nthe current row grouping state can be got via: columnApi.getRowGroupColumns()\n. agreed.\nin the mean time, you can implement your own cellRenderer for selection and use the selection api\n. no, just what is there now. to change that, you would need to create your own cellRenderer from scratch.\n. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-101. the problem i was trying to fix was that with font-size as default, the border around the menu icon was to large and as a result the menu border was hitting the edges of the header which looked crap.\nany idea if we change font-size back (ie take the css out of the class), how the border issue can be resolved?\n. accepted. i've now changed it to line-height.\n. the only thing in that area that changes was the deep references for fields, ie from my release notes:\nNow colDef.field can had deep references, eg colDef.field = 'owner.firstName'\nnothing else comes to mind. also, nobody else has complained. to help troubleshoot, or at least get around the problem, can you try using valueGetter? (so if the field is ipAddress, use valueGetter='data.ipAddress')\nif you can put a plunker together i can take a look.\nor you can debug through the code, the method of interest is getValueUsingField (if using field) and executeValueGetter (if using valueGetter)\n. no update, closing. are you trying to set columnDefs?\nthere is no such property groupColumnDef. you specify the groups as columns and then set using columnDefs property.\nsee the online examples for how to create groups of columns:\nhttp://localhost/angular-grid-grouping-headers/index.php\n. ops, sorry, my fault, i take back all of the above!! my head is deep in code and i'm trying not to take to much time on forums etc as it distracts me. let me take a look . . . .\n. great your using the grid heavily. with such a small complain, sounds like it's working out quite well for you!\n. i am guessing you are setting the property AFTER you initialise the grid? not all the properties are updatable via web components properties yet. just i haven't gotten around to it. to see the status, you can check it here:\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/blob/master/src/ts/components/componentUtil.ts\nbasically the properties WITH_IMPACT_ are the ones that you can set after the grid is initialised. the other ones, you only get to set them once, and if you want to change them, then you have to either set them directly on the gridOptions, or use an appropriate API method (if it exists).\nin time, i'll change all the properties over to 'have impact', especially given i'm starting to integrate now with React, which will have the same problem and i presume many more people using React and ag-Grid than web components.\nin the mean time, set the property you need on gridOptions. the one in question, groupColumnDef, doesn't actually do anything when you set it, it just 'gets used' next time the grid is rendering. so set it, then call one of the api.refresh methods.\nps i'm closing this, as it's not specific to groupColumnDef. if you want to open up another one for 'have all options impact' then you can, but i'm aware of this, and as i said, with react coming online with ag-Grid, i'll be dealing with this anyway.\n. shit. thanks. i'll fix it. might be easiest if i just go to 3.1.2\n. 3.1.2 released\n. did you take ag-grid.tsd from Definitely typed repo, or the one that comes with ag-Grid distribution?\nalso, i'm confused, is it a problem with the grid or awesome-typescript-loader? if the latter, then nothing i can do???\n. looks like own issue that' snow solved, closing. i do not want to fix unless i know what's going on.\nin the datasource, there is a method getRows(), which should return asynchronously by calling the successCallback() function. Can you advise, are you returning asynchronously? If not, can you change so you are (put the callback into a timeout).\nthis is the only way in can think that the grid is getting confused.\nlet me know!\n. yup, i'll fix the documentation, actually better, i'll fix the code, so that if someone tries to 'callback' before the getRows has returned, i'll throw an error.\n. Dragging columns to reorder is high on my list, hopefully in the coming two weeks. Yes it's already raised, so closing this issue. \n. if you mean pinned columns (you say floating columns), then this changed in 2.7. please see docs:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/angular-grid-pinning/index.php\n\"My second question is: Is there a one-time-binding parameter?\" -> the grid doesn't use angular, so question about one-time-binding doesn't make sense.\nps in future, please use the forum for issues, github should only be used for when grid needs fixing.\n. thanks for positive feedback. \nthere is no colspan feature in the grid. this is a css html  solution, which i have not tried to replicate.\n. it's already on my external list, to put in colspan - suppose no harm in turning this feature request back on. there are about 250 issues now - most of which are minor feature requests i believe, so we don't take github to seriously, what we go to for work is our project plan, and that's internal to ag-Grid company.\nactually i think this might be a duplicate\n. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-102. there is already an issue raised for this so closing\n. cannot reproduce.\ni used this example:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/angular-grid-virtual-paging/virtualPagingServerSide.html\nand set:\n        {headerName: \"Athlete\", field: \"athlete\", width: 150, suppressMenu: true, sort: 'asc'}\nand the sorting worked fine on the server side.\n. yes that makes sense. setting columDefs should not trigger the datasource to fetch. even if you try to do 'getRow' without column defs, it still has the problem.\nhowever not sure printing a warning message is correct, that's specific to you, for someone else (who is not doing server side filtering), doing a fetch without columns could make perfect sense.\ncan you change your code, so that if the column defs are not present, you don't do the fetch? just return an empty list?\n. could be - the data could be fetching in the background while the columns are being sought from someplace else. or the user could be adding / removing columns while the data is fetching. i'm thinking of a data analysis tool, there the data takes a while to come back.\n. not true for latest version.\nthis is the code (actionOnColumns method in columnController)\nkeys.forEach( (key: Column|ColDef|String)=> {\n                var column = this.getColumn(key);\n                if (!column) {return;}\n                action(column);\n                updatedColumns.push(column);\n            });\nthe magic bit:                 if (!column) {return;}\nif it doesn't find the column, then return.\nif you are on the latest, and still a problem, can you be so kind as to debug through this portion of code and see what's happening, as it's pretty simple code, i can't see where the bug might be.\nps closing, unless i can get to reproduce!\n. no solution yet. it's lazy loading of the groups.\n. no plan to implement this in the near future, so i cannot commit to it for a sale.\nit would take approx one full week to implement it.\nif your company is interested in sponsoring this piece of work, then get in touch with accounts@ag-grid.com\notherwise, well you can implement something yourself. create your own cellRenderer for the group column and then implement your own logic for contacting the server when you expand / contract the row.\n. @andrss because we are very very busy building out ag-Grid and making our money from sales of ag-Grid Enterprise licenses. so what we work on is the features we believe will make ag-Grid a better product for our overall customers rather than chasing the short term goals and getting paid directly for features.\nthese two approaches overlap. sometimes we do take money for particular features. but generally speaking everything we do is with the intention of making ag-Grid better for our current and future customers.. tracked b y https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-103. duplicate of https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/issues/566. doesn't do it for the header groups.\n.

I haven't tried TypeScript in anther ES6 module. I'll need to understand modules better.\n. gridSizeChanged is for when the grid body changes size. so the following should never fire it:\n3) it is NOT invoked when row groups are changed (onColumnRowGroupChanged)\n4) it is NOT invoked when changing the column visibility (onColumnVisible)\n5) it is NOT invoked after resizing columns (onColumnResized with event.finished === true).\nif you want to know when columns change state, you need to register for the column events.\nMorevoer, is there a way to invoke api.sizeColumnsToFit() everytime the data is shown?\n-> what do you mean by \"data is shown\", if you mean whenever you set the data, then why don't you call it after you set the data?\ni think maybe your expecting the girdSizeChanged to be something different to what i intended. the purpose of gridSizeChanged is to inform you of changes to the div size you placed the grid in. eg changes as a result of windows resize, or your app changing the grid size in some other way. if your looking to resize your cols after cols have changed, then this is not the right event.\n. fair point. will add to list.\n. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-105. can't use cellRenderer, as they can provide HTML, not just values. what would be needed is a new  'exportFormatter' function, which does exactly as you suggest.\n. i'm undecided when. i might have a client willing to pay for things, if they do, then they will be getting preference.\n. i've added processCellCallback() for next release, allows formatting of data when doing csv export\n. i didn't know this. yes ready is also fired by angular 2. to get around this, you can inspect the ready event. only the ag-Grid ready event will have the api parameter.\nfunction onReady(event) {\n  if (event.api) {\n    // this is the grid ready event\n  }\n}\n. ah crap, i didn't realise it was called more than once. so Angular is firing 'ready' every time you resize?\n. i've updated the docs. but it's not nice, as even if it's in the docs, most people will miss it. can you just confirm, 'ready' is called for ng2 every time the window resizes???\n. it's meant to be a function\nhttp://localhost/javascript-grid-callbacks/index.php\nmaybe you have it mixed up with the property of the same name that goes onto the columnDefinition.\nsuggestion: put checkboxSelection onto the column definition\nPS for general questions, please use the forum, github should be for where the grid is broken.\n. it's optional. this is the code:\n/** The field of the row to get the cells data from */\n        field?: string;\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/blob/master/src/ts/entities/colDef.ts\n. it's not something i was considering, my team just isn't big enough to support another framework at this time, and i'm currently hitting the biggest ones (react and angularjs).\nany reason why the native javascript version is a problem?\nideally Aurelia should be able to use the web components version.\n. sorry, it's just time vs value, getting react in took me a full week, and now i have to maintain it.\nI am currently evaluating both React, Angular 2 & Aurelia\nlet me know what you think. i've just started to look at the Aurelia intro movie\n. pagination should be fine - there is nothing in it that's specific to any framework\n. funny you mention web components - maybe i should drop support for  angular 2 as that's mean to support web components also!!!\n. Learnt a lot about ag-grid call backs...\ndo i need to improve the docs?\n. fyi The examples on this page have been tested to work with latest versions of Chrome and Firefox on Windows.

When I click the filter icon (ag-header-cell-menu-button) and move the cursor to the menu (ag-filter), ag-grid hides the button\ni don't follow, the grid shows the button when you hover over the header (not hide), and it doesn't have anything to do with the icons. maybe i'm no understanding???\n. ok i understand. this is a bit more work though, not a 1min change.\n. yup that's right. the popup has to be outside, otherwise it gets clipped.\n. this only impacts free version of ag-grid, as in ag-grid-entrprise, the popup menu appears on top of the icon, and the popup has an identical icon, so it appears as if the icon stays.\nfor free, to get it consistent, we could consider using the same menu popup (but it only has the filter panel, not the other two, as they are enterprise features).. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-107. i don't understand what you meant, this is not happening in the examples on line??\n. you need to make sure you are including the CSS for the grid.\n. i'm not sure what's happening then. the grid should lay out using the css. are you 100% sure the css is been used?\nmaybe you can inspect on of the grid elements, see if the ag-cell class has the following (just right click of the cells that are all bunched up on the left hand side):\n.ag-cell\n    display: inline-block\n    white-space: nowrap\n    height: 100%\n    box-sizing: border-box\n    text-overflow: ellipsis\n    overflow: hidden\n    position absolute\n. thanks for the update. ag-grid-react-component project is already removed from github, so nobody else should make this mistake.\n. what you need is this:\nimport {initialiseAgGridWithAngular1} from 'ag-grid/main';\nhowever i forgot to include this attribute in my CommonJS output. i've just fixed this and i'll be releasing in the next hour 3.3.1\nyes you also import interfaces like that. but i have been lazy with the exports, it's on my todo list. this is the current list of exports:\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/blob/master/main.d.ts\ni need to spend 30min exporting everything when i get a chance.\n. 3.3.2 is released and has this fixed.\n. the navigation just wasn't designed to work with floating headers / footers, so it won't work.\n. when i developed this part, i came to the conclusion it was a bit of work to get the navigation working with the floating cells. i had a quick 5min look this morning, and could see how the navigation uses rowIndex to move up and down. this is where the problem is i believe.\n. Just wondering if there was a way to achieve this using the current pipes\n-> not that i'm aware of. sorry, i don't have the time to look into it, to do so i'd have to stop doing what i'm doing. i get about 4 large questions a day (like this one) that i would have to look into the code at parts i have forgot how they work, so would take me 30min and possibly drag into an hour, i just don't have the time to do that, sorry :(\n. Jesus, I'm never flying Australian Airways in that case!!! lol\nRight, closing :) thanks\n. i've taken 2 of 3 ideas:\n- now have no-style version of the bundled files\n- now clean the dist folder\ni didn't take the formatter, it's not something i'm familiar with.\n. re chat room, yes, but it was taking up to much of my time! with github and the forum, i dedicate about 30min each morning on issues (however today it was more like 2hr!!!)\n. acually there is still a chatroom, i just don't go into it anymore.\n. this is more than just formatting, eg the following i see introduced in ag-grid.css\n```\n.ag-column-moving .ag-cell\n     transition: left 0.2s;\n```\nthe core grid css is not meant to have any styling, just layout or the core grid to work. styling belongs in the themes.\n. i have implemented a version of shift selection that will be in the next release. the version that is checked in btw works with groups, which this pr didnt' do. thanks :)\n. if you want to see the headers on each page, how about you split it out into different grids?\n. don't share gridOptions!!! the grid puts the API on gridoptions, so it will get overridden if multiple grids sharing the options.\n. questions on forum please\n. thanks for the kind words :)\nyou can already change the icon\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/angular-grid-icons/index.php\nor you can change the whole header\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/angular-grid-header-rendering/index.php\n. set suppressMovable=true on the col def\n. done..

I'm using Intellij, I cannot comment if what I am doing works with other IDE's.\n. afraid not. the world of javascript and definitions etc is very messy, beyond the understand of us (we are a small team and are kept busy with the core grid items). the best i can do is explain what we did and why, and hopefully you can work it out.\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/understanding-packaging-for-javascript-typescript-commonjs-and-everything-else/\n. @dan-madaket the typing's for what you ask already exists. i forgot to add them to gridoptions!!! have fixed for next release.\nfor example check here:\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/blob/master/src/ts/entities/gridOptions.ts#L147\nyou can see what the typings are for the next release, but you can still use them now, ColDef, ColGroupDef and IDataSource all exists and can be used now.\n. thanks for the feedback. is there something wrong with one of my examples or documentation that I need to change? or was this just user error? (sorry in advance, so many build tools etc to keep on top of, I can get mixed up)\n. @priyanka813 i do not know. % height is working in all my examples where i use it.\nothers have reported similar - i think it's because for % height to work, the parent contain of your div needs a height. without this, it won't size right. the grid fills the div you give it - so it's the div you give it that isn't sized right.\n. filterWrapper.scope = this.$scope.$new(true);/\nthis creates a child scope, so you shouldn't need isolated. isolated scope causes other issues, such as if your filter wants to access items from the parent scope.\n. in for next release\n. not a 5min change!! will leave it on the list.\n. tracked  by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-108. bug not correct. see example: https://www.ag-grid.com/example.php\nthe language column has a tooltip, the other columns don't.\n. now your making me feel bad by apologising!!!\nre point no 2, i can't do that, that's circumstantial, other people would rather no tooltip at all.\nhowever it's easy to work around, you can just provide the tooltip yourself.\n. you can check the old documentation here: https://www.ag-grid.com/archive/2.2.0/\nif it's not part of that release, then there is no way.. can't fix this, it's just how it works.\nthe grid works with what you give it. at the time of calling 'sizeColumnsToFit', then it reduces (or increases) all columns based on their CURRENT width, not their initial width. i could change it, but then that will cause a bug in the other direction.\nthe way for you to get around this is to reset the widths before making the call to sizeColumnsToFit.\ncolumnApi.resetState(); // however this resets everything, including visibility, pinned etc\ncolumnApi.sizeColumnsToFit();\nif you don't want everything reset, then call setState and only provide widths\n. rather than accept pr, i've changed in my 'new release' branch, as i've been doing open heart surgery and wanna limit merge conflicts. will be in next release. thanks.\n. correct, it doesn't work. i wasn't part of my plan.\n. correct, it doesn't work. i wasn't part of my plan.\n. my plan is to have the headers more like the cellEditors / cellRenderers currently are - i did a lot of work with that design and they behave like components with init() and destroy() methods. you could then have angular compile and angular destroy in this methods. in the future, this pattern will be in all parts of the grid. just need time.....\n. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-109. thanks. i have fixed this in my 'next release' branch\n. i am not writing tests and don't intend them any time soon. again due to my massive re-factoring efforts i'm doing and my style of development.\nbefore i release, i do full manual regression testing. all of the features i implement are present in the documentation examples which i use for my manual testing, so in effect the documentation acts as my regression test script.\nhistorically, the grid is very solid, more solid than other projects with lots of tests.\nif your colleague uses this as a measure of good quality code, you should use ui-grid, it's poor in comparison IMO, but you can sleep well knowing the poor code has lots of tests!\nps closing this, as it's a duplicate\n.

Also updated the docs.\n. then there is something else wrong, not to do with the original question in this thread.\ncan you try api.refreshView() after the data is set? maybe put it in a timeout (wait 0ms) to see if something does need to complete.\nif you can reproduce in a plunker i can take a look? but with the above, not much i can suggest.\nps closing, as the reason for this thread to be opened inintially is gone off topic to what this is now. if you do find a specific problem, then a different issue specific to that problem would be better tnks.\n. i go to main demo page, turn on console, then whenever grid changes (shrinks or grows) the event is fired.. i will need to put some time aside to look at this. interesting function you pulled in. i will go over it in the coming days (weeks?) as i've now put this PR on my 'todo' list (which I keep on my desktop).\n. dist files doesn't matter in this case as i won't be merging, i'll be just copy / pasting. the next release is in a branch and i don't want conflict hassles as i've done massive changes. also, copy / pasting puts me in the driving seat, no code slips in unless i put it in explicitly!\n. i've checked this into trunk. i didn't merge as to many conflicts, just copy / paste. i'll be doing a release this evening.\n. @noherczeg i don't know what is happening here, nobody else has reported it. what line of code is causing the problem?\n@AkosLukacs ah crap. is turning on --module flag an issue? using modules is the future, and what the other 'big projects' appear to be doing.\n. @noherczeg that line of code is not ag-Grid, it's the css style loader. the function applyToTag is put in during the webpack stage, so i'm guessing it's to do with the webpack loader 'style-loader'\ncan you use the non-css version of ag-Grid (dist/ag-grid.noStyle.js) for your tests?\nalternatively can you google this problem with regards style-loader and see if a solution is there?\n. @AkosLukacs \ncan you not just rung on --module flag?\n. right, i need to start working, will be leaving github issues for rest of the day (sorry, otherwise i get stuck here for half a day)\n. fixed. will be in next release.\n. thanks. i've fixed this in my 'next release' branch.\n. i can't see what's wrong, it is in your code that the 'isUnread' error is occurring. the grid verion you are using uses a virutal dom, and it's in the calllback 'elementAttached' (after the virtual dom is made real) is where the problem is been caused. in the next release, i have taken OUT the virtual dom, as it doesn't give any performance gains in most browsers. so you would try again when the next version is out, in case it's something to do with the virtual dom.\nhowever i think not, and with the above, i can see anything wrong in ag-Grid. i'm going to close. we can reopen if you can narrow it down and isolate it to something wrong in the grid?\n. i had a look, nothing obviously wrong. however i coudln't debug through it as the ag-grid code was minified.\n. if you unminify, and then try to debug through ag-grid code yourself, the code is very well laid out so you could find the problem yourself\n. not sure what you are getting at.\ni am aware of one problem, that the list inside the filter is created when the filter is first opened. so if you open filter, then close it (without doing any filtering), then click your button, then open filter again, the filter shows all the old values rather than just the toyota.\nis this you point?\n. are you saying you change the row data and you are expecting the grid to pick up on this and filter the data again automatically?\n. two items above.\nresetting filter if values have changed - there is now api.destroyFilter() to destroy a particular filter. you will need to set the values in it again if you wish to keep state.\nvalues not getting filtered out, eg Bahrain above - this was a bug i have just fixed, happens when filterParams is left out. to get around, include a blank filterParams.\n. after you destroy the filter, it will be created from scratch again next time it is used.\nnext time a filter is used is either:\n1 - user clicks header to show the filter\n2 - you set the filter model via the api (explained in docs)\nwhen the filter is created from scratch again, it will extract all the unique values form the dataset.\n. demonstrated here:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/example.php\nfilter persons name column with 'sophie beck' which results in two rows.\nthen look at filters on columns:\ncountry - works as expected, gets filtered\nlanguage - works as expected, gets filtered\ngame name - fails, all values are shown\nso you can use country and language to observe expected behaviour.\nonce i release the fix, then all columns will work.\n. looking at the code, I'm never seeing the destroyFilter() being used.\nthe demo doesn't use destroyFilter(), just demo's the set filter removing entries from the list due to other filters.\nfor destroyFilter(), see the filter API example here:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-filtering/index.php\n. just so happens, i have all this changed in the next release, and it's covering iterables. the 'similar' function in the future version is:\n```\n    private createRowNodesFromData(rowData: any[], firstId?: number): RowNode[] {\n        if (!rowData) {\n            return [];\n        }\n    var rowNodeId = _.exists(firstId) ? firstId : 0;\n\n    // func below doesn't have 'this' pointer, so need to pull out these bits\n    var nodeChildDetailsFunc = this.gridOptionsWrapper.getNodeChildDetailsFunc();\n    var suppressParentsInRowNodes = this.gridOptionsWrapper.isSuppressParentsInRowNodes();\n    var eventService = this.eventService;\n    var gridOptionsWrapper = this.gridOptionsWrapper;\n    var selectionController = this.selectionController;\n\n    // kick off recursion\n    var result = recursiveFunction(rowData, null, 0);\n    return result;\n\n    function recursiveFunction(rowData: any[], parent: RowNode, level: number): RowNode[] {\n        var rowNodes: RowNode[] = [];\n        rowData.forEach( (dataItem)=> {\n            var node = new RowNode(eventService, gridOptionsWrapper, selectionController);\n            var nodeChildDetails = nodeChildDetailsFunc ? nodeChildDetailsFunc(dataItem) : null;\n            if (nodeChildDetails && nodeChildDetails.group) {\n                node.group = true;\n                node.children = recursiveFunction(nodeChildDetails.children, node, level + 1);\n                node.expanded = nodeChildDetails.expanded === true;\n                node.field = nodeChildDetails.field;\n                node.key = nodeChildDetails.key;\n            }\n\n            if (parent && !suppressParentsInRowNodes) {\n                node.parent = parent;\n            }\n            node.level = level;\n            node.id = rowNodeId++;\n            node.data = dataItem;\n\n            rowNodes.push(node);\n        });\n        return rowNodes;\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n. i plan to release on friday 4th. no it's not ready to use right now.\n. yup i've considered this. see here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNhPeLCBbE0\nbtw, I have taken the virtual DOM out of my upcoming release, so if you want to try it yourself after that release, be my guest! however i'm not going to spend time on this as i don't see the performance as an issue. my next things to do with performance is column virtualisation (if user has say 100 cols) and possibly (very possibly, not decided) a canvas 2d version of the grid.\nbut yup, as you ask, i've considered and coded and tested what you say - (although i didn't use the translate function, no sure if that makes a big difference)\n. why the change from virtual DOM given what you said in the video\nbecause it only makes a significant difference with IE, however for IE I also use the delayed scrolling, so it's two solutions covering the same problem, only one solution is needed. if using Chrome (which most people are that are using the grid) then it makes pretty much no difference.\non a benefit side, the virtual dom complicates things, so with it gone, the code base is cleaner, easier for me and you (as your cellRenderers are working with a real dom node now)\nbtw, the new IE in Windows 10 (called Edge) is able to handle the grid fine without the delayed scrolling.\n. latest version of grid does as you expect. sounds like your using an old version.\n. sorry, i will only be doing releases for major bugs, for something small like this, will have to wait for next version. you can make the change locally?\n. you cannot.\n. that's by design. the  virtual pagination doesn't show loading, as you can be viewing one portion of data, while another portion is loading in the background for some data not on the screen.\n. not directly. however you could code something into your datasource to eager fetch blocks. \n. just based on the requests, so if you are called for page 10, then also grab pages 11 and 12 and keep them cached in your datasource. if the grid calls for 11 or 12 before they come back, store the grid callback somewhere and call it when 11 or 12 returns.\n. i got errror 404 when i clicked on your link.\n. this is NOT what you do his.api.selectNode(rowData[1]);\nthe nodes are not rowData, each rowData item gets wrapped into a node.\nsee https://www.ag-grid.com/angular-grid-model/index.php\n. this is reworked (and fixed) in the latest, so fix will be included in the next release.\n. that's by design. you cannot use variable row height when doing virtual paging.\n. thanks. i've it fixed now locally. will be in next release.\n. this is not a problem in the latest, will be fixed in next release.\n. i have just added 'processRowPostCreate' callback, will be in next release. this will give you access to each row right after it's put into the dom, allowing you to add attributes or do whatever else trickery you want.\n. reading my issues and working on some as i go, i implemented the solution in your issue before seeing this! anyway, i think my solution is a wider 'catch all' as you can change anything on the row, not just attributes, and requires less code on the grid side (easier to maintain). so i'll stick with my implementation. thanks :)\n. not enough info to help. exports is what commonjs files use. so it sounds like your referencing the ag-Grid commonjs files without actually using commonjs.\nif using commonjs, use the main.js in the root.\nif not using commonjs, using the files in dist/\n. gents, thanks for helping each other out. pretty busy my end to look into requests that are more than simple one liner questions.\nat the end of it all, do i need to add anything to my documentation or change the grid code?\n. is this basically a difference between bundled vs commonjs versions of the grid?\nso maybe i add to the docs:\nwarning: if you are using the bundled version of the grid (/dist/ag-grid-js) then you must specify this directly, the main files specified in package.json and bower.json point to the commonjs versions of ag-Grid\nwould that do it?\n. this is a very big change an unlikely to get done unless someone funds it.\n. done.. next release will be from the 3.4 branch.\n. the examples are just what i have online in the docs. i'm pretty confident the grid is working as lots of people are using the groups. ps this isn't an issue with the grid so closing, github issues just for things wrong with the grid.\n. currently not a feature.\n. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-110. which version of grid, can you confirm if this is happening with v4.x? i rewrote a LOT of code in v4\n. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-111. duplicate\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/issues/260\n. that's not possible right now. maybe in the future.\n. \"Client cached data should be able to export no matter it is in current page or not\" => for standard pagination, there is no client cache.\n. nope, work not scheduled.. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-112. i am planning to get this done next week.\n. we took influence from this PR and created another material design theme.\nwe started with this PR, but then went back to the drawing board as it was to awkward maintaining the themes the way we were. instead we decided to put all the common items into one theme that we now call ag-common - and then each them extends this.\nso with regards Material Design, can you suggest changes to the Material Design that we introduced in the last release?\n. thanks!\n. fixed.\n. yes. next two days. i've a few cleanup issues since the last release, including this.\n. not sure. insn't this a bug in your code that your calling it with invalid col id's?\n. . . . . the other option is i through an exception, but i know there will be someone out there who gets upset that it breaks under this scenario, trying to set columns that don't exist on purpose for some reason, eg if they are reading in col ids' from a stored user preference and the col they are interested in doesn't exits.\notherwise, if it is a use case i am not thinking of, can you explain?\n. what about a validate method, you pass in a list of col id's, it returns true if they all exist?\nor even better, you pass in a list of colIds, it returns back all the cols it finds that are missing?\nthat would then help your console error message.\nit would also be reusable anywhere your code needs this, not just when setting columns. thoughts?\n. ok convinced! i've just changed it. now this method returns false if one or more cols not found\n. @Wykks i'm not sure if you commented on this or not - github gave me a notification you think the error isn't fixed but i'm not sure if you did....\n. you can do that with valueGetter's:\nvar coldef = [{\n    displayName: 'ID',\n    field: 'call_od', // this will be ignored for rendering, but if you update the value, it will get stuck here\n    valueGetter: 'data.call_od ? data.call_od : data.ticket_id'\n}]\n. thanks for posting your update.\n. thanks. will be releasing later today all going to plan. this bug slipped in during my refactoring.\n. thank you.\n. nope. but good idea. will stick in on my (very long) list.\n. going back through this - and i believe you can achieve this now with keyCreator. please check keyCreator here:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-set-filtering/\nbasically the key is what should be used for the comparison. then if you want to render something different in the set filter (not the key), then use the cellRenderer for the set filter.. i already fixed this today, will be in the next release. as a work around, set the data-source AFTER the grid is initialised, like this:\nvar options = {\n    rowSelection: \"multiple\",\n    enableColResize: true,\n    suppressRowClickSelection: true,\n    angularCompileRows: true,\n    angularCompileHeaders: true,\n    headerHeight: 30,\n    rowHeight: 30,\n    rowModelType: \"virtual\",\n    columnDefs: this.getAgColumnDefs(),\n    gridReady: function(params) {\n        params.api.setDatasource(\n            datasource: {\n                getRows: this.getRows.bind(this),\n                rowCount: null,\n                pageSize: 100,\n                overflowSize: 100,\n                maxConcurrentRequests: 3\n            }\n        );\n    },\n}\n(might have a typo up there, i just wrote from memory)\n. you an already order by multiple columns. hold down shift while clicking the column header.\n. yup, having this nicer is on my todo list.\n. thanks for contributing. the reason i've put this on hold is i want to come back and revisit the paging at some point and create a proper api into it. so want to wait until i have the time to do it proper rather than taking delta changes.\n. nope. you cannot change the text after the grid is initialised. if the user changes the language, you will need to create a new grid.\n. it's a chunk of work for me and not hight on my list of priorities.\n. headers have gotten mostly rewritten since this post was raised, should be no memory leaks now.. agreed, nothing difficult, standard practices should apply. i'll be released with #780 in a few hours.\n. fixed. will be in next release. in the mean time, do this workaround:\napi.focusedCellController.setFocusedCell(rowIndex, colKey, floating, true);\n. yes, i'm going to try and get PR in soon.\n. i've taken #733, so this problem should be fixed in next release. i plan to release in a few hours.\n. no it's not possible when doing server side pagination. however this is something that a very large client is looking for, so i plan to implement it over the coming two months. you will need to do the grouping yourself on the server thought, then the virutal pagination will show the groups and lazy load the details when you expand the groups. this is already tracked by a client engagement, so closing the issue here!!\n. \"When a grid overflows with scrollable content, there's a ux concern that there's no indication that user needs to scroll to see more content.\" -> but the scrollbar shows when you need to scroll, which is the indication to the user, maybe i misunderstand?\n. setting css overflow to 'scroll' rather than 'auto' does this. also need to refactor the code so that we are using classes and not setting styles. maybe we have 'horizontally scrolling' as a class that we add / remove to the panels (pinned etc based on what has the scroll bar).. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-113. please advise, where is it referencing PopupService? (and not popupService)\nbtw, the class is PopupService and the file is popupService\n. are you looking at the latest?\nas this was a problem i fixed a few days ago i though.\n. yes i understand what you are saying. my point is, i cannot see where in my code this is still a problem. can you advise if you are looking at the latest code, and if so, which file has the issue?\n. thanks for the feedback!! this should be fixed - i renamed the file PopupService back to popupService, so the imports should work.\nare you using the latest? and if so, can you advise which file you are looking at?\n. should be fixed in the latest release and latest in trunk.\n. if you want a workaround, call api.refreshView(), calling setRowData() seems a bit heavy\n. this was fixed last year.. suppressMenu - stops the menu from appearing.\nthis does not stop the filter icons from appearing.\nif you want no filter icon, then don't filter by that column!!!\nor - change the header template, and provide a template that is missing the filter icon.\n. user resets the filter so that all filtering => it is removed when no filter active.. i've changed this manually. only the ts file should be changed. the .d.ts is generated by typescript. thanks.\n. thank you\n. @gerardqueralt that's probably because i haven't done a release. this is not a critical bug reported by any paying clients, so will be in the next natural release.\n. there are two things that use datasource and had this bug:\npagination (with paging panel) -> got it fixed in 4.0.x\nvirtual pagination -> not fixed in 4.0.x but fixed in master\n. nope, still on the todo list.\n. icons in toolpanel are now configurable. is there a way i can re-render the updated filter params onto the gui?\ni think the answer is no. but i'm not fully understanding the question.\nare you trying to update the available values in the filter?\n. yea that's a problem. i'm going to change the name of the issue to be more specific.\n. new method implemented 'destroyFilter'.\nif you call this, then setModel, it will do as you require.\n. yes understood. sorry for asking explicitly, but i can get different issues mixed up. so to be clear, will the following fix it: \nHave option in grid to not preventDefault on mouse wheel events?\nThis will have unexpected behaviour if the grid has scroll bars (as when you mouse wheel, the grid will scroll and the webpage will scroll) - however we don't care about this, if you set the switch, it's assuming you don't want scrolls in the grid.\n. @esbenp trying to look at this now, did you know at what parts of the code exactly we need to 'prevent default' ?\n. @esbenp i asked to soon, i see you referenced the line of code in the above. will look again. thanks.\n. i have surrounded the said code with the following:\n// allow the option to pass mouse wheel events ot the browser\n        // https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/issues/800\n        // in the future, this should be tied in with 'forPrint' option, or have an option 'no vertical scrolls'\n        if (!this.gridOptionsWrapper.isSuppressPreventDefaultOnMouseWheel()) {\n            // if we don't prevent default, then the whole browser will scroll also as well as the grid\n            event.preventDefault();\n        }\nin other words, set the property suppressPreventDefaultOnMouseWheel=true and then the grid will not prevent default on the mouse wheel event. we plan to release this week so you should have this fix soon.\n. Okay, but for forPrint will disable horizontal scroll, yes? -> yes\nIn estimation, do you see any issue with outcommenting this line ? -> no, seems fine\nyour right, the grid is very close to having an auto-height feature, would be small code required on my side to get it in\n. sure you can open a PR. i spent 20min just now looking at implementing 'auto height', but it's a tricky bugger, i'll need to give it a good two hours on undistracted time - so had to back out (i'm on client site currently, so not as much time to do larger items). if you can do a PR then i will take a look. i will do full review of the PR (make sure i understand it) before merging, so please be patient after you create the PR.\n. When do you guess is that feature available I have a lot of other work that I am doing at the moment, so won't be spending time on this in the next two weeks. Maybe after that.\n. tracked by https://ag-grid.atlassian.net/browse/AG-114. np. sorry for not the answer you were looking for. if it does help, i did expose the row via the callback processRowPostCreate(), i know others are using this to implement their own DnD.\n. i can include it in my docs? if you post on plunker or similar i can include a link from the docs pages.\n. tracked by  AG-116\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/ag-grid-pipeline/. thanks. will be in next major release. as you say, workaround is gridoptions. sorry if you lost time on this.\n. yes has been raised before. at the moment, if you want to do this, you have to implement your own 'server side sorting' in the client. ie assuming you are loading all the data into browser memory, then do the same technique as 'server side sorting / filtering' but implement the sorting and filtering in you datasource - similar to what the ag-grid examples do (there is no server in the example, the server is mocked out in javascript in the browser)\n. the second example on this page.\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/angular-grid-pagination/index.php\nit reads in the same data in one go, and then chops it into pages. the filtering and sorting is done inside the datasource.\n. all of what you say makes sense in that a) it's the best way to do it given the options and b) it's not a great thing to have to do. however it will work fine.\ni went to the code to see if i could add a 'show menu for column' api method quickly, but it's a bit tricky as the menu depends on the button for positioning, so i'd have to rethink that if to allow showing the menu without the button.\nwhen you say context menu, are you talking about clicking anywhere on the header or just the menu button?\n. all of what you say makes sense in

best is for me to provide an API to show the menu, however the code would need to be change a bit as there is login in there that assumes the event is coming from a button, and it then positions the

ag-grid, there is no duplication of code. ag-grid-enterprise injects functionality into ag-grid. so if you are using commonjs (what ag-grid is modelled on), then you use both projects.\nhowever if you

not part of your group. then the grid can do it's grouping and not use this row.\n- provide a different cellRenderer for the floating row. this can help with your edit feature. alternatively, you can see what the row is in your cellRenderer and render differently if it's the first row.\n- if not using floating for first row, then don't use grid grouping, provide the data already grouped, which will then let you have the first row 'not in a group' if you wish.\nfull row editing is something i plan to do, but no release date yet.\n. no such property. i've change the title and will try and get

The issue I have is if the result is offscreen, the user cant see it? Is there a way to scroll grid to display result in current view port?\n-> not possible, as the grid doesn't render everything into the dom. so when your searching what's rendered (ctrl+f) it isn't actually searching the entire dataset.\n. please say Plain JS! surely people know at this stage not to use Angular in complex stuff if you want it fast!!!\n. yea i agree, i want this feature in. just a matter of prioritising.\n. @AmitMY sorry for asking, but are you an enterprise customer? which company are you with?\n. you email accounts@ag-grid.com with your order, they give you a customer number with the invoice\n. for grouping to span columns, use valueGetter, cellRenderer is not used in the grouping process.\nsame will work for filtering. however if that default result doesn't work, you can provide your own filter.\n. i don't understand the questions.\nhowever forum is for questions like this.\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/support.php\n. onNewDatasource() is not used in the new version. please check the docs.\n. sorry for this. docs are out of date. i've fixed and they will be updated with the next release.\n. use:\n// way 1 - set the the datasource using the API\ngridOptions.api.setDatasource(myDataSource);\n. without an example of it broken, can't say what's wrong.\ndo you have steps on how to reproduce in an online example?\n. something i could do is add callbacks, so you can listen for 'drag start' and 'drag stop' or the grid, so you only apply the hack when the grid is dragging.\nhowever you guys have to be doing something in your apps that noone else is doing, as this isn't a common problem. can idea what you have that is causing the conflict??? i'm guessing it's a CSS style or something you have set???\n. just implemented - i add / remove the class to body when dragging starts / stops. will be in the next release (will be about two weeks, i want to finish pivoting first)\n. this is a question, not an issue with the grid. github is for issues so closing. thanks :)\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/support.php\n. not sure i fully understand, however there was an issue with grouping and selection that i now fixed. it will be in the next release next week.\nis it related to this:\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/issues/838\n(the one i fixed)\n. i'm emailing crushikesh directly, so closing here to remove duplication.\n. not possible, including angular in the headerCellTemplate is not supported.\n. code above is wrong, it's actually:\nif (!oldColumn) {\n                    console.warn('ag-grid: column ' + stateItem.colId + ' not found');\n                    success = false;\n                    return;\n                }\nit you are missing the return statement. maybe you are on an older version, what you describe doesn't happen in the latest.\n. i released yesterday. i can't remember when i actually added it!!\n. thanks. will take a look when i get time.\n. i went to work on this, and as far as i can work out, it's not needed.\nin your example, i changed the overridden style to the following and it worked\n.ag-fresh .ag-cell-not-inline-editing { padding: 0 40px; }\n. thanks for input, will stick on list, but no promises on if or when it gets in, as we are busy :)\n. there is no way of getting the datasource.\nif you need it, i suggest you keep a local reference to it. or you can set it into gridOptions yourself (the grid will ignore it) when you call the api.\n. interesting. thanks. will take a look when i get a chance.\n. Any update on this? Seems like an obvious feature to have.\n=> yes, i plan to get it in. just very busy with pivot right now. i'm hoping to include this in the next release.\n. it didn't make release v5 :( i'm hoping to look at this tomorrow, before i go on my holidays the next day :( . . . . this is probably the feature i want most in the grid from all the small requested features.\n. i have now implemented this. will be releasing later today. i didn't take the PR as a lot of code has changed (around how the headers work) since this PR was created.\n. you can do this, but you will have to provide the data to the grid already grouped.\nlook at the file explorer example or the tree example for providing already grouped data.\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-tree/index.php\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/example-file-browser/index.php\nthe grid will not the grouping or aggregation for you. but it does give you full control on what's in each row.\n. thanks. will take a look when i get a chance.\n. i have added the class, but i have not taken the suggestion of changing the mouse to pointer. this is easy to add yourself if you want. reason is that no other parts of the header (eg menu) change when mouse hovers over them.\n. no idea what's happening, haven't heard of anything like this.\ni suggest you debug through the ag-grid code. look for method 'createSouthPanel' and see why it's not putting in the pagination panel. maybe it's not picking up the property.\nto 'reset' the grid, you could put an ng-if on the div, and then toggle it on and off in two timeouts. it's a tick to get the grid to destroy and recreate itself.\n. i think that's to specific to be included in the grid, at least in the medium term! if you want to try something yourself, start with listening for the columnResized events.\ndoing your own implementation would be easier, as then you won't have to worry about items not relevant to you, eg if your not using column grouping, you don't need to consider it, or if you are, your solution can assume grouping and ignore when not.\n. the only way to show it is via the menu, and you can customise the menu to remove this item.\n. can you set it to undefined?\n. i'll fix it so 'normal' doesn't throw an error.\nno real different, i shouldn't be making the differentiation in the grid code.\n. thanks for highlighting. i'll come back to this soon.\n. thanks for raising, and i agree, it's wrong to have them different. the target state is the cell renderer and editor. however for now i'm going to leave the filter as i am not 100% sure of the final state and i plan to do a lot of reworking in this area so won't want to change things to many times.\nbasically under the hood i'm building out a UI framework. the approach in the cell renderer / editor are my newest ideas. in a few months (two or three?) I'll have all the ideas finished and then i'll refactor everything in a big release and also release the new framework for anyone to use, maybe call it ag-stack. but during this process, i don't want to be changing everything all the time as i go. when things are ready i'll revisit the filters and bring them up to date.\n. this was fixed a few months back, filters are now consistent with cellEditors and cellRenderers. will be fixed in next relese\n. Instead of calling doLayout periodically the call should be triggered by the events that could change the layout, for example size or data change.\nthere is no event for 'dom object resized', only winder resized, and this is not the case.\nwith regards the high cpu, it's not dolayout, i tested this and it makes little difference when no resize is happening.\nyou can check this using chromes task manager, detailed here:\nhttp://www.laptopmag.com/articles/how-to-use-chromes-built-in-task-manager\non my machine, the ag-grid website with the main example is taking 0% when open\n. thanks for posting. i've implemented this manually (not a merge) for consistency, uses the ag-grid utils class (arguable with one is better, however now it's consistent)\n. thanks for pr. accepting, however fyi, i plan to revisit how angular is used in a few months from now, so this may change as i refactor.\n. not possible to customize the group header text - you need to set the group name accordingly.\nit is the plan to provide templates for the group headers similar to that of the normal headers, it's in the pipeline tracked by another issue, so will close this issue.\n. use getRowHeight() callback\nhttp://localhost/javascript-grid-callbacks/index.php\nthen something like:\nif (params.node.group) {\n return 20;\n} else {\n return 20;\n}\n(i didn't test the above, but you should know what i'm getting at)\n. looks odd, nothing comes to mind, sorry.\n. yes it is. it's what i do in my example in github i believe.\n. no update, many months past, closing.. @mikeerickson \nre docs inconsistency, i've changed, will be in next release.\nre hiding last tab, see https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-column-menu/index.php\nsuppressMenuFilterPanel: Set to true to not show filter panel.\nsuppressMenuMainPanel: Set to true to not show main panel.\nsuppressMenuColumnPanel: Set to true to not show column selection panel.\n. view the source from your browser.\nor alternatively, the entire website is here:\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid-docs\n. see the grid api, there are methods to scroll row into view and col into view\n. it's usually a CSS issue for you. the grid will fill the height of the div you give it.  see the note on % height here:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-width-and-height/index.php\n. as i mentioned, its' your css. when you use %height, you have to be mindful of the height of the parent div also (especially if you don't set it). to get  it working, drop the ag-grid bit (but leave the div in) and observe that your %height doesn't work as you think it does, the div will scroll way down your page.\n. if you fancy building the latest, you can check out now?\nwe haven't scheduled a release yet, so i can't say when it will be officially available. we are just off the back of 4.1.x, the next release, emm, well it would be great to get this out. maybe end of next week... maybe not!\n. @mikeerickson seanlandsman works with me btw, this is not just a random PR\n. +1\ndo you want to give me a testimonial for the website?\n. something i intend to do at some point, but so much to do i can't estimate when it will be done.\n. https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid-react-example\n. https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid-react-example\n. https://www.ag-grid.com/change-log/changeLogIndex.php\nIf you are using the built in groupCellRenderer, check the examples on how to configure it.

i mean think about the solution.\n. latest release allows custom agg functions for the col. i also give an example of doing average (which gets tricky btw if you are grouping multiple levels, as the non-leaf levels have to be weighted averages as the child groups will have differing numbers of rows)\n. i don't use ugliy, so can't help here ;(\nif you find something i can change in he grid, then i can consider including it, however isn't this an issue with uglify?\n. regards the setAllColumns, what is the difference between this and columnApi.getState() and columnApi.setState()?\nregards the events, this is to specific. someone else will want to listen to another group of events for another reason. i'm keeping with how standard dom event work - and there is no 'listen for this group of events' methods there. so keeping with best practice, you are going to have to listen for the events you need :(\nyou could trying using addGlobalListener - this will add an event listener to ALL events, providing you with the event and the event name. you can then filter on the event name.\n. i've not come across this before. we also don't use karma. __agBeanMetaData is something we use internally for annotations.\n. you could see why the code is not executing in the way it should. what should happen:\n1) we use TypeScript for creating the annotations. the annotations execute when the library loads and create the __agBeanMetaData on the objects on the classes. for example, the Bean function gets called as the @Bean annotation is used.\n2) the __agBeanMetaData is then used by the grid when the classes are used.\nso you could put a breakpoint into the Bean function, you can verify it is called before the error method when using the grid normally. then see why that path is not following in your test?\ni think the test is not executing the script first and allowing initialisation of the annotations before using the classes defined.\n. no update, closing.. fixed in current version. left and right arrow keys now move cursor within the cell. i didn't change up and down arrow keys as i don't see the point in allowing this in a text field.\n. this is the key: event.stopPropagation();\nyou need to block the kev events from getting to the grid if you dont' want the default navigation.\n. yes, but it's fixed now. will be in next release, probably within 24hrs.\n. sorry, we don't. however typescript vs javascript shouldn't be an issue, you should be able to create it using the JavaScript examples we provide.\n. i don't understand the question.\n. after sort has changed, the api.getSortModle() returns the sort model. i'm using it in an app and working for me.\n. yes it does. maybe you observed one of last fridays 'broken' releases, we had a few false goes before we got it right.\n. maybe i don't understand, but if i do understand, then i think it's working as expected.\nin moveFocusToNextCell here is this check:\nif (startEditing && !nextRenderedCell.isCellEditable()) {\n    continue;\n}\nin other words, the editable flag is checked only if we are trying to edit the cell.\nso if you are in edit more, tab will move between editable cells.\nif not in edit mode, then tab will go to all cells, as all cells can be focused if not editing.\nif i got it wrong, then kindly explain and reopen the issue.\n. just finishing the release, had some problems!!! so had to redo the release a few times, but i think i'm all done now with github releases. updating the website now.\n. how did you get that link??!!! it's very old. this is the page you should be looking at:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/best-javascript-data-grid/index.php\nmaybe you have the old page saved as a shortcut.\n. yup i know, just extra work and i have other things higher priority to do!!\n. no. we plan this in the future, but it's not in there yet.\n. noted. thanks. i'll look into the performance, that's worrying.\n. regards buying a license, email accounts@ag-grid.com\n. \"Grouping / Ungrouping is now slow. I have a 60K rows table, and grouping was very fast before.\"\n-> the test is now aggregating all the month columns, before it was just aggregating two of the columns. this is the cause of the slowness. in the next release i'll bring it back to just aggregating two rows.\n. i cannot reproduce any of the other items above. for me:\n- sorting works as fast as it used to\n- open / close group is not slow\n- selection is not slow (if you group, then select a group, it selects the whole group very fast)\n- \"When a row is selected, right click any cell, copy, copies the selected row\" -> this hasn't changed and is the intention, this is what the docs say will happen.\n- \"Grouping icon is covering the entire screen\" -> not for me\n- \"Tables are crashing the browser \" -> again i don't experience this\n- \"New selectbox does not seem to have an option to revert to old one - I think it would be better to use a normal checkbox, or an image url. (As far as I know, saves only one copy in memory)\" -> it's now in line with the other icons in the system. it is easy to change this to another image.\nwith all the items i cannot reproduce, i'm wondering if your browser is caching something it shouldn't???\nas this issue is pretty much items i can't reproduce, i'm closing.\n. i think you have the old version cached. please clear your cache and try again.\n. fied. will be in next release. thanks.\n. fixed it. thanks for pointing out. i'll try and get it right going forward. let me know if you find any others.\n. you need to call the digest cycle inside your callback. it's an angular thing.\nhttps://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-angulars-apply-digest/\ntry this at the end of your callback:\nsetTimtout( function() { \n  $scope.$apply(); \n}, 0}\n. cannot reproduce.\ni updated my main test page by inserting the following:\n```\nsetTimeout( function() {\n    for (var i = 0; i<10; i++) {\n        var start = new Date().getTime();\n        gridOptions.api.selectAll();\n        console.log('selectAll took ' + (new Date().getTime() - start));\n    start = new Date().getTime();\n    gridOptions.api.deselectAll();\n    console.log('deselectAll took ' + (new Date().getTime() - start));\n}\n\n}, 10000);\n```\nwhen the page loaded, i quickly set the row count to 100k rows (hence the 10 second wait in the timeout about). then it select / deselect 10 times in a row. take about 200ms to do each selection / deselection. the browser doesn't suffer.\ndone on chrome, w10, very fast new laptop.\n. not possible, you will have to do the aggregations yourself. it's not an often asked for feature so low on my priority, especially given it's not necessary, just a nice to have given you can do the aggregations yourself.\n. the answer is that the grid will never update your data. this is by design.\nyou can, if you wish, update it yourself. you can add a listener for the event rowGroupOpened and do something like this:\napi.addEventListener('rowGroupOpened', function(event) {\n  var data = event.node.data;\n  data.expanded = event.node.expanded;\n});\n. that's funny! i had no idea rowDataChanged(rows) and refreshRows(row) did almost the exact  same thing almost! i developed them at different times and for different reasons. one works with data, the other with rowNodes. arkon is right though, they are only needed if the rows are currently displayed and hence the GUI needs to refresh. you can update the data at any point, and next time it is displayed, the correct data will be used.\nif you want to be 'correct', there are methods now on rowNode called setData and setDataValue, the first replaces the data, the second updates a value on the data. each will then redraw the grid cells if required.\nwith regards adding / removing rows dynamically, that's a great idea and i want to do it. it's high on my list. but as you point out, with the internal structure, there is a lot to be considered. there is already an issue open to implement this so closing this issue.\n. either i could not reproduce, or i didn't understand what you are doing. i took one of my examples and set it to enable checkbox selection on the group and have group span entire row. dblclick on the group row expands the group, doesn't select. unless you click the checkbox - which does select as expected.\ncan you demonstrate in a plunker?\n. ok fixed it. it will be in the next release (not yet planned, but this looks minor, so no rush??)\nthe problem has nothing to do with dbl click, it's single click.\na single click should not unselect a row. you need to have rowDeselection=true to allow this.\nthe problem was rooted in when groupSelectsChildren=true, then the groups were appearing in the selected list - they should not.\n. cool. will be fixed in next release so.\n. the method columnsApi.getAllColumns() didn't return in order of displayed, it returned in order of what you provided. so it hasn't changed between versions. i just checked the code of 4.1.5 and am pretty sure of this.\nyou can use getAllDisplayedColumns if you like.\n. my mistake, columnsApi.getAllColumns() did get the order changed.\nWas it intended to change 'getAllColumns' this way?\n=> yes i intended to change it, this is a side effect. basically i've reworked the columns to pave the way for pivoting. with pivoting, there is an extra 'jump' as the pivot step can introduce columns.\nIs there a way to get all of the columns, in order?\n=> try api.getAllGridColumns(), when you are not pivoting (which you are not, as this isn't exposed yet as I'm still working on it) then this should be what allColumns used to be.\n. you right, it's not exposed. i've just exposed it. in the mean time, you can use this undocumented way of doing it (ie change to the correct way when it's available)\napi.columnController.getAllGridColumns()\n```\n. thanks for taking the time to close :)\n. this is not new:\n// we do not allow selecting groups by clicking (as the click here expands the group)\n    // so return if it's a group row\n    if (this.rowNode.group) {\n        return;\n    }\ni can't remember exactly the scenario, however you can select groups when it's checkbox selection, you can see this on the main demo page.\ni don't think this was working as you expected before\n. it's on my plan to provide an API for pagination.\n. i'm hoping later this month, but can't guarantee, work stack very full.\n. you can achieve this with floating rows\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-floating/index.php\nthen create floatingCellRenderer to customise what gets rendered. you do not have to use the underlying floating row data, you can ignore this and render whatever you want.\n. options for refresh are available here\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-refresh/index.php\n. do you have a method to dump all the grid's config\n=> nope. but i don't think that would help. my gut feeling with his is it's clashing with something in your app. the fact you can't reproduce in plunker suggests this also.\n. with the example, i was able to troubleshoot and fix. it happens when you try and initialise the grid with ng-show=false\nnow, my timer picks it up, so after 500ms, the grid fixes itself.\nto get around this in ng1, have a watch on the 'show' flag, and when it gets set to true, call gridApi.refreshView() or gridApi.doLayout() in a timeout of zero milliseconds (ie after the angularjs VM turn has finished)\n. there is a built in solution, it checks for grid visible every 500ms, same way as it checks for grid resizing every 500ms.\n. we are looking into it - if anyone can tell us how to implement bindings in ng2 when not inside an ng2 component please tell us and we will implement it.\n. @vknaveenkumar we still need to figure out how to do it!!!\n. no resource that i know about.\n. just make sure your using it right, you will have to call rowNode.setDataValue() for the animation to happen, et\nrowNode.setDataValue(change.columnId, change.newValue)\n. will have to come back to this Amit, my brain is pretty fried getting the pivoting working, so any issue that's not easy for me to understand i'll have to part :(\n. hi @AmitMY, this to me sounds like a non-grid problem - the grid assumes the data you give it is complete.\nhowever you can modify the data after you provide it to the grid, you do this by calling setData(data: any) or setDataValue(colKey: string|ColDef|Column, newValue: any) - the first sets the whole row data, the second sets specific columns. the grid will work out what needs to be refreshed when this happens.\nputting the logic into the grid to me seems wrong place to put this responsibility.\n. ps - nobody else has asked for this - which is another reason to keep the complexity out of the grid - it sounds specific - so it could cause more issues for more people who don't need it than problems is solves!!\n. isn't this a general 'how to style scrollbars' question rather than specific to ag-Grid?\nin ag-Grid, we style the scrolls in the dark theme to be slimmer, the styles we use for this are (i included all scroll styling, the colors are not part of the sizing!!):\n```\n  ::-webkit-scrollbar\n    width 12px\n    height 12px\n    background #302E2E\n&-thumb\n  background-color #626262\n\n::-webkit-scrollbar-corner\n    background #302E2E\n```\n. @Ruud-cb  - i don't know off hand what is wrong. sorry. we also don't have the capacity in the team to look into using ag-Grid with all the different possible libraries, ie NiceScroll. so i'm afraid with this one, i can answer questions you have on ag-Grid, but as to why it's not working with NiceScroll, I'm not going to be much help.\n. @Ruud-cb ag-Grid doesn't decide what scrollbar to use - it uses the stock scrollbar. if you want to customise, you use css to change the stock one.\nthe method for getting the scrollbar width you can see here:\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/blob/master/src/ts/utils.ts#L546\nbasically i create a div with scrollbars and compare the width of the inner vs outer div (ie how much the scrolls remove).\nthe only item i can see as an issue, is i do this by adding to the document, maybe i should add to the grid, as then any style changes you make to the grid will be used.\nbtw, i don't add a spacer to the header, this is merely the result of a gap, by scrolling the header to match the body, this bit is left over.\n. @nkoterba ok i've just implemented property scrollbarWidth, if it exists, it will use this rather than work the width out itself. will be in next release.\n. ditto with Amit - need more info!!\n. no response, so closing\n. ag-grid: cannot do quick filtering when doing virtual paging - understandable. Is there a way to create something like the quick filter, with an apply button?\n=> true - and yes it would be nice to have one and have it passed back to the server side with the other filters.\nUncaught TypeError: this.rowModel.forEachLeafNode is not a function\n=> you must be using the set filter - which won't work in virtual pagination - as it can't find the values to include in the set.\nIs there a pramas.failureCallback? couln't find one\n=> yes, it's called failCallback\ninstead of params.successCallback, wouldn't you rather use resolve and reject?\n=> possibly - i have avoided using promises in the grid as i find they can make the design more complex when trying to follow things through. but this is probably just me - i am not used to working with promises so it may only make it more complex in my head.\nhide / show overlay\n=> yes possibly.\nwhat i would like to do is go back over the paging and virtual pagination and do a 'second sweep', cleaning up all issues like you raise, and also bringing in an API for both (eg purge cache, set starting position etc). it's just a matter of priorities and right now my head is all in pivoting! (yes i know i said that in the other issue also, but it's true, pivoting is taking a lot of my brain cell right now)\n. thanks for looking to help out - it's appreciated, even if i don't have the time to properly respond.\nre pivoting, you can see progress on the youtube clip i posted:\nhttps://youtu.be/jCId-Lbg_6k\napprox 2 weeks (but i normally underestimate these things, so maybe 3 or 4)\n. this is an old issue, since then pivoting has gotten released and invintate scrolling has gotten an overhaul. so closing this issue.. that's not what happens, eg check the main online demo, it supports multi-row selection.\nensure property rowSelection='multiple'\n. use the gridReady callback.\nused in lots of my examples, such as the one on this page:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-value-getters/index.php\n. nothing to do with angular 2 - just difference in ag-grid versions.\ni've put a filter into my local 'tree example' and cannot reproduce the problem.\ncan you reproduce in an plunker?\n. are you using getNodeChildDetails as in the example here:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-tree/index.php\n. i've also just updated the file browser locally and it's workign with filtering\ncan you provide a plunker?\notherwise, without able to reproduce, i can't help fix\n. plunker doesn't work :(\n\n. look like the doesFilterPass gets a params object with node and data as follows:\nvar params = {\n  node: node,\n  data: data\n};\nfilter.doesFilterPass(params)\ni'll update the docs\n. i have updated the docs to:\nThe grid will ask each active filter, in turn, whether each row in the grid passes.

The method is provided a\n                params object with attributes node (the rodNode the grid creates that wraps the data) and data\n                (the data object that you provided to the grid for that row).\nwill be in next release\n. i was in the mood!\n. don't think it's a duplicate, not heard of it before. however i have no idea why this could be happening. i really need to see it a plunker or similar to troubleshoot. nobody else has reported it. are you using your own cellRenderer? if so, does it happen without a cellRenderer?\n. none of the info above shines any light on it for me :(\ni really need to see a plunker or similar to observe what is happening - so you appreciate - i get about 20 'please help' requests a day - i can't spend more than a few min on each other, otherwise i get no work of my own done :(\n. for what it's worth, it sounds like something odd in the cellRenderer - either something you are doing, or an assumption you are making and the grid is doing something . . . . but having looked at your cellRenderer, it looks pretty straight forward. it's the type of thing that if i got my hands on it, i could just inspect the dom and follow through the javascript and it would be pretty easy to see what's going on. the other option is you debug through it yourself!\nas i can't reproduce, am closing the issue. can reopen if you can reproduce or otherwise identify what's wrong.\n. can you tell me what i am meant to be looking at in the fiddle?\nwhen i click the filter button, it does filter, from your description i'd expect it to not filter???\n. how are you including ag-grid?\ni see the piece that references the script is commented out\n. sorry, ignore, i see it\n<script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/ag-grid/4.2.6/ag-grid.min.js\"></script>\n. enterprise vs non-enteprise will make a difference, as the default filter is 'set' for enterprise, and 'text' for non-enterprise\nanyway, am looking...\n. ok i have it, here is the workaround:\n{headerName: \"Make\", field: \"make\", filterParams: {\n      newRowsAction: 'keep'\n    }},\nbasically, the grid is coded to clear the filters when you load new data. it's getting confused with the pagination and server side filtering, it thinks you are loading new rows.\nstill looking into it, but the above will get you unblocked \n. looking at the example online https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-pagination/index.php\nit  uses newRowsAction: 'keep' there also, so that looks like the intended usage. can you advise if this is acceptable?\nlooking at it now myself, i'm not happy with it, but it is what it is. rather than spend 1hr on it now and hack something in, i'd rather keep this open and revisit next time we do a revision of this part of the code - where we will take a step back an improve the whole area at once spending a few days on it.\n. the grid does not loose sort when you update the rows. you must be completely destroying the grid and creating it again from scratch.\n. yes if set in new columns, that resets the sort, as the sort is tied to the column.\n. no. there is another issue open to allow templates for the pagination panel. it will be catered for then.\n. if you don't want the column to dissappear, set suppressDragLeaveHidesColumns=true\n. thanks for raising. your right, there is an extra node getting selected.\nin the last release, an extra 'parent' node was introduced, which was work towards the new pivoting functionality (refactoring we did, in anticipation of pivoting).\ni'm looking into it, see if it can be easily fixed.\n. btw, i don't check github on a daily basis, if i have email notification, i jsut get to many emails\nif something is a bad bug, mention it on the members forum\n. ok, i've already fixed this.\nnot sure if you want to know, but what i was trying to explain above is there is now a 'parent of all rows' - so even if you are not grouping, there is always one group, and the parent of that group is never rendered.\nso if you have a grid with 100 rows, there is a 'rootNode' that has these 100 rows as children, and this rootNode is never displayed. if you are looking at grid code, you will see this rootNode in InMemoryRowController, it's silently owning all the other nodes.\nanyway, to fix, i need to update selectionController method onRowSelected - it's already fixed in latest in master - but you can't use this, i'll have to put into a branch and release off branch, otherwise you get all new stuff we are working on that's not properly tested.\nthe code is now this:\n```\n    private onRowSelected(event: any): void {\n        var rowNode = event.node;\n    if (rowNode.isSelected()) {\n        this.selectedNodes[rowNode.id] = rowNode;\n    } else {\n        this.selectedNodes[rowNode.id] = undefined;\n    }\n}\n\n```\nand it needs to be\n```\n    private onRowSelected(event: any): void {\n        var rowNode = event.node;\n    // we do not store the group rows when the groups select children\n    if (this.groupSelectsChildren && rowNode.group) { return; }\n\n    if (rowNode.isSelected()) {\n        this.selectedNodes[rowNode.id] = rowNode;\n    } else {\n        this.selectedNodes[rowNode.id] = undefined;\n    }\n}\n\n```\nbasically when you have groupSelectsChildren=true, then the groups also potentially get selected. the magic entry you see in the selected nodes is that rootNode that is getting selected when you select a row.\ni don't want to do a release now as it's 9:30pm here - i need to be awake for a few hours after a do a patch in case i mess it up. so i'll do a patch in the morning. if you want to hack the grid code with the above one line entry you can tell me if it solves everything (ie help me test!!!)\n. fixed and released. can you verify?\n. access to members granted. please go easy on us, keep the issues short and to the point :)\n. not now, but you can hack it by grabbing the root node. just get any node, and follow the 'parent' attribute up until you get to the last one, which will be a non-displayed rootNode (which coincidentally will be displayed when you enter pivot mode in the future when that gets released)\n. couldn't do what i wanted to do. by having init(params) call getGui(), it then had a cyclic dependency, as getGui() has a dependency on init(prams) getting called first.\ni don't want to change the afterGuiAttached() method without fully thinking on the popup service - i think what really needs to change is the popup service needs rethinking.\nhowever, you have your own element - when afterGuiAttached is called, you can use element.parentNode to climb the dom tree, from your element to the popup parent. this would be my preferred way for now, as changing the afterGuiAttached() takes this part of the code out of sync with other parts where popup is used.\n. will be fixed in next relese\n. fixed. check alpha4.\n. ti have updated the documentation to be more clear on what the export does\n```\nWhat Gets Exported\nThe same data that is in the grid gets exported, but none of the GUI representation of the data will be. What this means is:\nThe raw values, and not the result of cellRenderer, will get used, meaning:\ncellRenderers will NOT be used.\nvalueGetters will be used.\ncellFormatters will NOT be used (use processCellCallback instead).\nIf row grouping, all data will be exported regardless of groups open or closed.\nIf row grouping with footers (groupIncludeFooter=true) the footers will NOT be used - this is a GUI addition that happens for displaying the data in the grid.\n```\n. docs will be updated on next release\n. @saifeer just finished implementing floating rows in csv export. will be in next release.\n. yes i'd like to have this to, for the next big pivot release, as it would be good for pivoting also\n. very likely\n. this was put in end of last year. fixing now\n. try now. 5.0.0-alpha.2\n. fixing now\n. try now. 5.0.0-alpha.2\n. does this break the grid? or just give error message but grid works fine? need to understand the severity. looks to me like grid works fine with error so lower severity.\n. ah yes, that problem :(\ni've just fixed this, the call to getRows() is now async, so this problem will never happen.\n. if your using cellTemplate - then your using AngularJS right? in which case, stick what you need onto your rowData, which will then be available through the scope?\nAmit - thanks again +1:\n. use a) rowNode.setData(data) or b) rowNode.setDataValue(colKey, value)\na for when you are changing all the data for the row.\nb for changing just one attribute of the row.\nthis feature, although works, was designed with a particular customer in mind, really it should work for the api refresh calls also, but it doesn't :(\n. Is colKey the same as colId\nany part of the API that takes a colKey, you can give it any of Column object, ColDef object or ColId\n. thanks for feedback the the solution to others. i would not of got this, i don't use flex.\n. fix now, will be in next release.\n. before merging, i will need to test this and put an example in place in the documentation (as that's what i use for regression testing). so will need to put this aside until i have the time. thanks for raising.\n. not available in latest build. i haven't looked yet.\n. ok i added this in. i didn't merge the pull request as had conflicts,  but i also like putting stuff in by hand myself to make sure it's verified. i used this as a template.\ni like the way it is optional and has to be turned on, so doesn't upset anyone who doesn't turn it on.. yes, will be in the next release.. fixed. will be in next release.\n. could not reproduce. i put this into the main demo page:\n{\n        // column group 'Participant\n        headerName: 'Participant',\n        headerClass: 'the-class',\nand the resutl was 'the-class' was added to the participant group.\n. if you don't want the filter to change between loads, use:\nfilterParams: {newRowsAction: 'keep'}\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-filtering/index.php\n. already fixed in latest, if you want to try the v5 alpha, it is fixed there.\n. that's exactly what it says - IE is reporting back the grid with zero width - if I cannot find out the width of the grid at this point, then cannot work out the width the columns need to be.\n. this seams fine to me:\nthis.$timeout(() => this.gridOptions.api.sizeColumnsToFit(), 500, true);\nhowever i'd just do:\nsetTimeout( ()=> this.gridOptions.api.sizeColumnsToFit(), 0 );\n. not really true - the grid IS ready - but the DOM is not - is there anything else in your app that is stopping the grid from been displayed? maybe it is in a tab that is not yet visible?\n. we are almost in agreement . . . . if there is something else in your app that needs to be initialised, then you should listen for that instead of listening to the grid onReady() event.\nthe grid onReady() event gets called when all the grids javascript initialisation code has finished executing. it is not an indication as to the readness of the browser or any other framework you might have.\nif it was flex, then getting the grid to 'wait' would put a dependency of flex into the grid which wouldn't be good!!!\n. Also, have you a plan to add \"autofit\" option for grid?\n=> yes, it's on my long list. however it's not something someone who pays me is looking for, so it's not near the top of the list. something to consider when i have spare time.\n. one gridOptions per grid. you cannot share grid options.\nthen call gritOptions.api.setRowData() on each grid separatly.\n. i can't think of any other reason about from 'shared state' that would be causing this.\nif you can recreate in a plunker, i can take a look. however nobody else has reported this problem, so i'm tending towards something particular you have in your setup that is allow the grids to somehow interfere with each other.\n. i believe this is fixed in v5. can you check and advise? i tested on main demo page, and selecting item does not select item in background.\n. second item, setting fields and values, is not currently supported. however look at the code for the selectCellEditor, it's very small. you can use this as a start to build your own.\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/blob/master/src/ts/rendering/cellEditors/selectCellEditor.ts\n. github is for issues with the grid, not help with using the grid. the place to go for help with using the grid is the forum. thanks :)\n. good idea. i've taken note. i'll try and get this in soon.\n. we reworked how infinate pagination works. the load queue now has a max size where oldest requests get chucked out, to avoid them building up.. as @tystol  points out - the map contains simple true/false values, so eg if you have value of 'apple' it looks up if apple is selected as follows: selectedValuesMap['apple'] which returns true if apple is selected.\nso @tystol , because it's a lookup to true/false, its' not possible to tag on other values.\nwhen developing this out, having strings as keys was the only way to get it working in a performance way. if you have 10,000 rows, that's 10,000 lookups every time the the filter changes.\nit's not a simple fix - the setFilter is complex piece - but if i do get an idea on how to fix easily, i'll do. but for now, you will have to work around it.\n@tloten you can provide your own filterParams.comparator to sorting.\n. @tystol sounds feasible - i'd have to spend some time looking into it to make sure though\n. added to change log for 4.2.x\n. the text filter is really only supplied as an example on how you can do filtering. what i suggest is you build your own filter. if i was to make the text filter configurable, not just with this, but with all the other requests i get, then you would have something more complex.\nso please copy / paste from this filter, make your own, and then 'make it your own' :)\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/blob/master/src/ts/filter/textFilter.ts\n. how to write your own filters explained here: https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-filtering/index.php\n. documentation has section on enterprise version. see left hand menu.\n. i have this fixed, will be releasing in a few hours.\n. don't know why this is happening. \ngiven Angular 2 is out, we plan to only address severe issues with Angular 1.\nthe workaround is don't use transclusion.\n. maybe - but i'm not looking to implement all the permutations of interactivity. what is working now is the typical use case.\nso what you can do is turn selection off, then use the grid events rowClicked and rowDoubleClicked and then use the grid api to do the selection yourself.\n. not possible - the drag events are coming from a drag service - it isn't aware that it is used for dragging columns and making them visible or not.\nthe columns fire their own events for moving, visible etc.\nwhat you could do is have a listener for drag events in your application, so you have a flag in your application that makes you aware if a drag is underway or not, thus ignoring column events while the drag is underway.\n. the button is disabled. if a library you are using, such as bootstrap, is styling disabled buttons in a way you don't like, the issue is with the other library, not ag-Grid.\n. The columnApi.getColumnState() method returns the aggregation function initially set on the column defs - rather than the actual user-selected aggregation (if any at all). -> I just tested this. I used the example on page https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-column-api/index.php (i updated it to enterprise from free ag-Grid) - I made 'Total' an value column, then changed using toolPanel to 'first' aggregation, and then printed the column state and it showed 'first' associated with the 'total' column.\nAlso, the current docs call it getValueXXXX(), even though that has been deprecated in favor of getAggregationXXXX(). -> correct, the docs are right, the code is wrong. i have changed this and gone back to 'value' in the method names. for a while i was calling in aggregation in the code, however i changed it as in the GUI (ie toolpanel) it's called value, and wanted to keep code and gui consistent.\n. ok just fixed. will be in next release. thanks for raising.\n. thanks for raising. fixed for next release.\n. use newRowsAction\nfilterParams: {newRowsAction: 'keep'}\nhttp://localhost/javascript-grid-filtering/index.php\n. this is behaving as expected. i'll update the docs.\nv5 introduced virtualised columns - so only columns visible in the viewport are rendered. it's a performance enhancement, so your grid can have 1000 columns and still work blazing fast, as it's only rendering the (approx) 10 visible on the screen.\nsizeColumnsToFit looks at the columns on the screen, and works out the width based on what it sees. it cannot see the columns that are not rendered, so these are left out. what you are left with is enough 'packed' columns to fit your current page.\nto get around this, you can turn off column virtualisation by setting grid property suppressColumnVirtualisation=true\ni'll update the docs so everyone knows.\nregards second issue, i have no idea, not seen this. if you can reproduce in a plunker, can take a look.\n. this should be fixed in next release.\nin the mean time, the grid is looking for columns (to work out the sorting) before the columns are set - you can get around it by not setting the datasource until AFTER the grid is initialised, that way you are guaranteed to have the columns in place before the first page request is done.\n. all events are available in all flavours - there is nothing missing in the grid in ng1 or ng2.\nif you are updating data in the grid, listen for cellValueChanged, then call one of the fresh method to get the other cells to refresh.\n. maybe you have to apply your scope?\n. few questions above\nthe agg functions will work on any type, not just number. the examples online shows `'xyz' on Bronze`` a string value\nif you want to use more than one column in your agg func, consider having an object as the value, eg\ndata.value = {\n  currency: 'EUR',\n  amount: 33.22\n}\nthen you get it all in your agg func. you will either need a cellRenderer (to render to object) or you can cheat and have toString on your object\ndata.value = {\n  currency: 'EUR',\n  amount: 33.22,\n  toString: function {\n    return this.amount.toString();\n  }\n}\n. use one of the api.forEachNode methods to go through the rows. that's what the set filter does. you can then use api.getValue to get the value using the column.\n. duplicate of https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/issues/226. cannot reproduce.\nhowever why are you using cellFormatter? this to be sounds like a job for valueGetter\n. columnResized should be onColumnResized\n. such doesn't exist. if you want to format dates, either use cellFormatter or create your own cellRenderer for displaying dates.\n. @abhishek2016 \nmentioned here:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-column-definitions/index.php\nshown in example here:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-viewport/index.php\n. @SanyaZoom type: 'date' - we don't support types, maybe you have us mix up with another grid!\n. there is no way in the grid to have row click select multiple rows.\nwhat you can do is turn selection off, and then do the selection yourself (using the api). the selection will still work through the api, but the grid will not do selection when you click.\nthen add rowClicked listener to ag-grid, and the select or unselect using the api.\n. or use checkbox selection.\n. this is already fixed and released in latest.\nsorry for delay, i didn't realise this post was here. was also reported on the paid forum (which i gave priority to as soon as i got back).\n. not supported. you have to set the entire set again. this is something i plan on introducing, possibly next week.\n. i don't understand what you mean. what would this callback function look like?\n\"On another note, thank you very much for all your hard work you've done - you have saved countless of developer hours for so many people!\"\n=> thanks!!! don't forget to buy a license for the enterprise version!!\n. that's what setting columns visible / hidden is intended for.\n. not a simple change, so afraid i can't just 'add it in', as the columns have their fingers everywhere eg pivot, group, sort, filter, pin, virtualisation, more, more,  . . . . . so it's more than 10minutes work :(\nright now i'm trying to do a sweep and pick up easy items to fix, before i launch into the next large item, which is revamp the infinate pagination. an items such as 'add / remove colums at will' is a larger item i'd need to priorities with other items.\n. no special way. you can use the 'forPrint' flag to get the grid to render all columns with any vertical or horizontal scrolls. but then it's up to you to actually print it.\n. that is as expected. you don't want to use an overlay when loading. that's is because the grid eager fetches the rows - so if you are scrolling down one row at a time, the grid can be loading the next page in a buffer and you never see the blank rows. or you could scroll so that half the rows are missing and half are present, but you don't want to block viewing the present rows while loading the others.\nif you don't like this, you can always use the api to show and hide the overlay.\n. fair point. i've just added rowNode to the scope, will be in the next release.\n. thanks. fixed for the next release.\n. colId should be strings, not numbers. update your plunker to use strings and it works perfect.\n. it's on my list of things to do. not necessarily numbers, but configurable icons, you can add numbers if you wish, or multiple arrows. anyway - not sure when, but will get to it.\n. this is now done. will be in next release. numbers appear beside the sort icons. if you want something else (eg icons) then you can achieve this using your own header component.. i'm sticking with my forum comment :)\n. i can reproduce this on the main demo page - when you tab on the last column, it should wrap to the first column of the next row. if it's the same issue, then it's not related to null values.\n. workaround for now would be to disable column virtualisation\n. ok fixed. will be released soon (today or tomorrow). i'm just finishing a sweep of bug fixes.\n. Great library, by the way. We are working on getting the Enterprise license, not because we need the features, but because it's worth supporting. thank you very much, I look forward to your order :)\n. will be in next release. \nadded gridOption.autoSizePadding, to specify number of pixels to add to calculated width.\n. fair point. i'm not sure beforeColumnMoved is the best way though. if it's always the first columns, then how about if first X columns are not movable, then you cannot put any other columns before them?\n. duplicate of https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/issues/853\nclosing. All good in the hood :)\n. i don't understand the question :(\n. i think you are asking about create your own custom filter??\nwhat you are asking for is not possible with the provided filters. however you can build your own one following the documentation here:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-filtering/index.php\n. what happens if you listen for the ctrl+A on your text editor, and then 'event.stopPropogation()'?\nin theory that will work, as the grid calls event.preventDefault() (which stops the webpage selecting everyone on the page) when the event hits the grid - but if you prevent it from hitting the grid, then you should get what you want.\n. change is v4.0.x, see change log\nTook out property groupHideGroupColumns, if you don't want a column to be shown, just hide it. This feature was not necessary and caused complexity in the design.\nthis property is not mentioned in any of the docs.\nre the second query, if you drag a column out of the grid, it hides. regardless of where you drag it to. you can override this with property suppressDragLeaveHidesColumns\n. correct it doesn't work - but i didn't intend for it to work. it is possible for the page the last selected row was in to be no longer loaded due to the purging of the cache, so the pattern breaks down when used with virtual paging. i'll leave this issue here as i man get time to code something up to support it - however it would be a new feature, not a bug fix.\n. forEachNode wont work because:\n1) the rows are not iterated in order they appear - the pages in the cache are gone through in no particular order (from looking at the code, i think it goes through them alphabetically, so page 1, 11, 12, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc)\n2) the pages can be purged, so pages can be missing, depending on how you have it configured and what scrolling you have done.\n. thank you for raising. getting ag-Grid to work on touch is definatly something we want to do. in approx 2 years from now, i feel that this will be expected as standard for grids in web UI.\nSince ag-grid is a bit similar to angular UI grid - that made me smile!!! for the record, i used ui-grid years ago, but never looked into it's source code. i copied the concept of gridOptions and columnDefinitions, but after that, any similarities are coincidental. ui-grid is based on angular 1, ag-Grid is based on it's own custom internal framework.\nthat's for the pointers, i'll come back to this when we dedicate a release to improving out touch experience.\n. i didn't mean i'd do it in two years. i mean in two years it will be expected in all grids!!! hopefully will get to it later this year or early next year.\n. @Ruud-cb pity it's resizing has come up tops, and not moving. we are releasing today, and moving cols will be possible via dragging. but resizing will not.\ni don't think resizing is easy via touch - i'm not fond of having to drag the edge of the column, especially if we are allowing moving of columns via drag - as it would be intuitive to drag the centre to move, and drag the edge to resize.\ngiven the next release will allow easy column menu access, how about you put options into the menu to resize? (you can currently choose the autosize option)\nps closing this as moving columns and general 'touch' support is now in. please open another for 'resize' if you the menu option isn't going to work. however it won't get done in the next few weeks as i'm about to get married and go on honeymoon.\n. yes i'm aware of this - your not the first to point out - but it's not a major problem for most people. it's not easy to fix - as the grid is not aware of what started the drag - as you can drag in from the toolPanel (in enterprise), in which case, you do want all the columns to show. given it's not trivial to fix and it's low priority, i wont be fixing it soon.\n. see the last example on this page on the expected way to do it:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-refresh/index.php\napi.recomputeAggregates();\n```\n. this happens at zoom levels for me also. i believe it is a scaling issue inside chrome, where chrome is reporting the wrong height when it is scaling. i am not able to fix - but welcome if anyone has any insight?\nto see the problem, put a print statement into the code as follows (it's just a print, so if you are not building ag-Grid, then just hack in the print statement):\n```\n    private layoutHeightNormal(): boolean {\n    var totalHeight = _.offsetHeight(this.eGui);\n    var northHeight = _.offsetHeight(this.eNorthWrapper);\n    var southHeight = _.offsetHeight(this.eSouthWrapper);\n\n    var centerHeight = totalHeight - northHeight - southHeight;\n    if (centerHeight < 0) {\n        centerHeight = 0;\n    }\n\n    if (this.centerHeightLastTime !== centerHeight) {\n        console.log(`height last = ${this.centerHeightLastTime}, height this = ${centerHeight}, totalHeight = ${totalHeight}, northHeight = ${northHeight}, southHeight = ${southHeight}`);\n        this.eCenterRow.style.height = centerHeight + 'px';\n        this.centerHeightLastTime = centerHeight;\n        return true; // return true because there was a change\n    } else {\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n\n```\nit's in borderLayout.ts\ni then go to the main demo page and zoom down to 75%\nin my tests, the statusBar (the south panel) is 22 pixels high. that's what the CSS sets it to. that's also what is reported by the dev tools when i inspect the element. however for some reason Chrome is alternating between reporting 21 and 23 pixels for clientHeight.\nif anyone has a solution, am happy to apply. but given it's chrome reporting the wrong numbers, not sure what i can do.\ni tried it in Canary btw, and that does not have the issue.\n. no update, so closing. i'd rather not use ag-row-tree, ag-row-treeLevel-0, as the only piece that is different between tree and non-tree is, well, whether you provide the data grouped or not. how the grid renders is the same after that.\nas you say you can apply a flag yourself if you want the grid with different css. so this isn't an issue??\n. rowSelection: true should be rowSelection: 'multiple'\nfrom the docs: rowSelection: Type of row selection, set to either 'single' or 'multiple' to enable selection.\ni'm wondering if fixing this will fix most of your problems.\none item that is not working as you describe is click selection - click selection doesn't work for group rows. this is because double clicking the row where the group is displayed (assuming you are using the provided group cell renderer) will expand / collapse the group.\nwhat you should consider doing is using checkbox selecton. if using the provided group cellRenderer, then do as follows:\ngroupColumnDef: {headerName: \"Athlete\", field: \"athlete\", width: 200,\n        cellRenderer: 'group',\n        cellRendererParams: {\n            checkbox: true\n        }}\nit makes sense to use checkbox when groupSelectsChildren, otherwise there is no visual way to know if the group is half selected.\n. no solution to it. however this is very edge case - why would someone decide to resize your browser if they are just about to change a filter? doesn't sound like normal user flow to me.\n. done. will be in next release.\n. fixed. will be in next release.\n. Shouldn't this be null now?\nno.\nthere are two things at play:\n1 - is the column one of the columns currently used in an aggregation. to check this, you get the list of value columns from the columnApi.getValueColumns()\n2 - what is the agg func - to check this, you call column.getAggFunc()\nwhen you add a column to the valueColumns[], if there is no aggFunc, it sets one up by default.\nwhen you remove a column from valueColumns, it doesn't touch the aggFunc, so that it will be there if you later add to the set of valueColumns again.\n. changed, column now included in event, will be in next release.\nhowever i observe, the same event is used for both interactions i mention above. to be correct, there should be a separate event for actions 1 and 2. hindsight.\n. i don't know how you got the link above, it's old data, the correct cellRendering docs are:\nhttps://ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-cell-rendering/index.php\nas per discussion above, there is one scope per row. there was never a scope per cell.\nif you want to reuse your cellRenderer, bind it with the data, eg:\n```\nfunction myRenderer(field, params) {\n  return '{{data.'+field+'}}';\n}\ncolDef = {\n  cellRenderer: myRenderer.bind(this, 'firstName');\n}\n```\n. done. will be in next release.\n. this seems odd to me. excel doesn't suppress cell selection.\nif you have an action on the cell selection, why not just suppress the action?\ni'm considering if this should be a grid feature, or your application feature.\n. cool. thanks.\n. do you have dev mode on in your application? if yes, turn it off. it's reported that dev mode slows down the grid when using react cell renderers.\notherwise, you haven't provided enough info for me to do anything.\nis the problem react specific? can you test same grid outside of react component?\nare you using react cell renderers? if yes, does the problem persist when you do not use them?\nare the examples on the ag-Grid website running faster for you? if yes, then what is it in your grid that is making the difference?\n. it's working fast for me. so not sure what i can do.\n. these are changed via the icon configuration\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-icons/index.php\n. np!\n. @don-bluelinegrid \nhi Don, the reason for choosing images is that gives greater flexibility on what you can put in there. actually it's not just images, you can stick any html you want in. if you want to use the same look and feel, then the best is to take an image of what you want and use that.\nin a perfect world, i'd have both, so you can decide to use images or checkboxes, however that's effort for us and we need to prioritise, and this would be low priority.\nbtw - it was originally checkboxes - and people requested to make them images!!\n. the images are not loaded. the images are embedded in the javascritp base64 encoded. i don't know why the browser is reporting to be loading them.\nre checkbox - i'm considering having an option 'use standard checkbox instead of images' - might solve both worlds. i appreciate people want to style checkboxes.\n. @randdusing thanks, good answer for others who ask about this, it has come up before.\n. yes there are changes. please check with the examples and docs for the latest version on how to configure the group cell renderer.\n. for showing the column menu, use:\npublic showColumnMenuAfterButtonClick(colKey, buttonElement)\n    public showColumnMenuAfterMouseClick(colKey, mouseEvent)\nthe methods differ by where the menu appears.\nthis is for column menus, hence you pass in the column details so correct options are displayed.\n. sorry, what? think you have a typo in your english?????\n. don't know what you mean, that example is working fine for me.\n. ah right, yes i see, top right, the column is slightly out. i'm aware of this. will add it to my list. medium priority.\n. this was fixed end of last year. this wont work - as the grid only edits one cell at a time. what do you do if use double clicks on another cell? the editing will be forced to stop.\nsuggestion - why not put his logic you need into your cellEditor? so cellEditor doesn't stop the editing until after you have the value ready?\n. right now, now. but i plan to put 'jump to page' into an api that will be developed in the future. there is already other issues open for such api and an existing PR request with a 'starting page' for the datasource.\n. you cant. maybe in the future.\n. you need either field or newValueHandler set on colDef for editing to work\nmaybe you should be using newValueHandler instead of listening on the event\n. this is not a grid issue - the grid is standard DOM. the classes are applied to the grid (there is no way to  have the grid without the classes) so your browser is not apply the CSS. the only thing that can result in this is you are not loading the css. or maybe your application is overriding the css somehow.\n. the method isFilterActive (on your filter icon) should return true or false. the grid makes the icon visible based on this. this assumes you are calling the filterChangedCallback() method correctly. see the docs for this.\n. the floating row data for the grouped row does not appear\ni'm confused - what do you mean?\nthe floating rows display a cell for each visible column, what else would you expect? \n(i think i'm just not following your description)\n. \"Oops, I meant to say the floating footer cell for a grouped COLUMN does not appear. In the screenshot below, there is no way to set data for the first cell (highlighted in red) in the floating footer, correct?\"\n=> the group cell renderer takes the data from the node - what you need to do is override this by providing your own cellRenderer for the footer.\ngridOptions = {\n  groupColumnDef: {\n    floatingCellRenderer: /* put your renderer in here */\n  }\n}\nsorry for delay, busy times\n. afraid not. as per the other issue with similar comment, that would require a large code change on the grid side, and do not want to follow ng1 patterns inside the grid.\nis there something you cannot do with standard DOM / JavaScript using the processRowPostCreate() callback?\n. cannot reproduce.\ni moved the image in my demo down, and tried both with scrolling browser and not scrolling browser, either way the dragging icon appeared in the correct location.\nyour app must be interfering with the css ????\nif you can reproduce in a plunker or similar, i can look. however not reproduce, not fix :(\n\n. no need, i have it reproduced now. give me 15min.\n. ok fixed now. will be in next release.\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/commit/c3dcfb7bf6cd6fe8629aa7ddc25de202efd2ef08\n. yes it's supported.\ni noticed the grid doesn't check 'isExternalFilterPresent' on startup. i've fixed this, will be in next release. however you have the workaround of calling onFilterChanged().\nwith regards the error, i cannot reproduce. i tested using the online example. i change it to start with 'above 50' and it worked fine. if you can provide a plunker, i can look, otherwise, can not reproduce :(\n. to see if column is grouped, aggregated or pivoted, see if column is in any of these lists:\ncolumnApi.getValueColumns()\ncolumnApi.getRowGroupColumns()\ncolumnApi.getPivotColumns()\nor use the following column methods:\ncolumn.isRowGroupActive()\ncolumn.isPivotActive()\ncolumn.isValueActive()\n. yes, because  you have no grouping, pivot or aggregation active.\n. i've just fixed this. it should happen by default. however if leave out teh filterParams, it doens't work. so put in a blank filterParams.\nsee the main demo on ag-Grid.com (view source), country and language are working, but game name is not. this will be fixed in next release.\n. cool! thanks :)\n. i put that in, but doesn't warn me. maybe it only works on linux or max? (i'm using windows 10)\n. yes i know, and i've just fixed that, thanks for raising.\nwhat i mean twas, i set forceConsistentCasingInFileNames=true, and it didn't warn me.\n. releasing in next hour, will be fixed. thanks for raising.\n. nope.\n. i don't see anything wrong with this on my win 10 using either chrome of safari. i don't have a mac :(\n. @connorblack @loverajoel @billyvg i did a lot of style changes with the headers between v4 adn v5, as now the columns are virtualised, the 'left' style is used to place the header cells, whereas before they were just laid out in a flow layout (ie one after the other, starting at the start). i will see if i can reproduce again - however to fix, if you can help, i either need to get it reproduced here, or if you figure out what css is needed to fix it - then i can trust you and just apply it - as long as it's not breaking anything else then i'll release based on what you suggest.\nthis has got to be a rare issue - something about your environments, maybe some clashing css in your apps? i say this as it has not been widely reported. 25k+ downloads in the last month since v5 was released.\n. is it broken on any of the online examples for you? or just happening inside your apps?\nif just in your apps, then what is the difference between apps and online examples?\n. looks like all issues here were with client code setting css in themes, or using wrong css. so not a grid issue. closing.\n. use the selection api to set item selected. so go through the nodes, and call rowNode.setSelected(true) for each row you want to select.\n. moving the styles from the template into css files makes sense, and can be done here. however, there are other parts of the app that it cannot be easily done, eg the row positioning is done using pixels and set as inline styles. can you advise why this is ok to do, but not the styles in border layout?\n. ok thanks. i've added this to my list. will get done over next two weeks approx.\n. are you talking about putting something into the dom? then use getBusinessKeyForNode\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-callbacks/index.php\n. i don't fully understand the questions. however new feature of fullWidth rows was introduced:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-master-detail/index.php\nif this doesn't do what you want, maybe you can frame the question by describing the limitation you have with the fullWidth feature?\n. if you provide a plunker, someone can help. otherwise, with the info above, i have no idea. maybe try comparing to the provided examples for guidance???\n. I am not getting plus and minus icons => you probably don't have groupCellRenderer for one of your columns.\nas for expanding, the code you need to modify is this:\nexpanded: rowItem.group === 'Group C'\n. interesting. i'll need to revisit this when i have more time, as need to make double sure no side effects.\n. use colDef.headerClass, or provide your own header template.\n. @killyosaur thanks for answering :)\n. thanks, fixed.\n. use the events to know when the filters have changed. then you can use forEachNodeAfterFilter to access the nodes for your aggregation.\n. yes i broke forPrint, sorry, will fix for next release, eta early next week, just finishing off master/detail grids\n. no. but good point. i'll add to my list.\n. all explained on this page\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/best-angular-2-data-grid/index.php\n. ag-Grid only renders what you see on the screen. if you want to render everything, set rowBuffer = , eg gridOptions.rowBuffer=99999999\nthat way, all rows will get rendered, however it will be a slower grid, especially if you have many rows. if thousands of rows, expect your browser to run out of memory.\n. the grid isn't designed for automatically growing in size. something i plan but is not scheduled work yet.\n. pretty sure this is a duplicate issue btw, has been asked for before.\n. duplicate of this one:\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/issues/801\nso closing. thanks!\n. fixed in 5.3.x, released yesterday.\n. putting text-align: right to the parent ag-header-cell-label worked for me.\n. use colId to help narrow down your css selector\neg in the main online example, i can see the first column has colId of 'name'\n<div class=\"ag-header-cell ag-header-cell-sortable ag-header-cell-sorted-none\" colid=\"name\" style=\"width: 200px; left: 0px;\">\n. autoSizeColumns looks at the columns on the screen, and works out the width based on what it sees. It cannot see the columns that are not rendered due to column virtualisation so these are left out. What you are left with is enough 'packed' columns to fit your current page.\nColumn Virtualisation is the technique the grid uses to render large amounts of columns with degrading performance by only rendering columns that are visible due to the horizontal scroll positions. Eg the grid can have 1000 columns with only 10 rendered if the horizontal scroll is only showing 10 columns.\nTo get around this, you can turn off column virtualisation by setting grid property suppressColumnVirtualisation=true. So choice is yours - what do you want - column virtualisation working OR sizeColumnsToFit working.\n. i'm sure there are far worse errors than that in the docs!!! thanks though, i've fixed that one. will be live next time i update the website. correct think, if you really want to, is do a PR to the docs project:\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid-docs\n. your grid div must have size. the grid then fills the size you give it. if you had no height (looks like your old version had no height) then i don't know why it was working in the first place.\nwith regards the difference, i did see one regression break with web components, where i had to adjust the height in the web components demo. however all the other examples online showed no problems with height and the latest version.\notherwise, not enough info above to know whats wrong. i advise looking at your CSS to try and figure it out.\n. @franktroia it's gotta be the size. make sure the div you are trying to render into has height. if unsure, set the height to a specific pixel value (eg 500px, do not use %) and see if it works then. it sounds like your hosting app is not giving the div the size you intend.\n. 500px instead of %age?\n=> i don't know why it's not working when it was previously - all my examples didn't have any issues - so must be something in your setups that i don't have that you all have in common.\nin my experience, the % doesn't work when you don't have heights set for the parent containers (divs) in your app. if the parent doesnt' have height, then the % won't work.\n. using api.forEachNodeAfterFilter() and a counter is what i suggest for the reason given above, otherwise yo may be missing rows inside groups.. yup, getVirtualRowCount is for virtual pagiantion, sounds like you are not using virtual pagination.\n. yup, getVirtualRowCount is for virtual pagiantion, sounds like you are not using virtual pagination.\n. This has already been raised (so closing this issue). the pinned and header move slowly, especially noticable on iPads and Android Pads.\n. no way to do it. have it added to list. no promise on when it gets implemented.\nwhat you can do is change the style (colors, borders etc), but not the height.\n. duplicate of https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/issues/680. column name can be dynamic, see colDef.headerValueGetter\nso as long as the headerValueGetter is configured to return back the correct new name, then call api.refreshHeader() to refresh the header\n. i don't understand that question\n. your data id is nothing to do with the node id.\nfunction cellRenderer(params) {\n  // this is the node id\n  console.log(params.node.id);\n  // then this would be your id, if you have one on your data\n  console.log(params.data.id);\n}\n. no, that wasn't my intent. if i did put this in, then it gets confusing if multiple columns were changed (eg sorting or filtering by multiple columns) or no columns were changed (filter could be by quick filter or external filter). so keeping it simple to help with grid maintenance.\n. not sure exactly what you mean, if multiple fields in a cell, then maybe the grid should not tab and let your components manage their own tabbing.\nso we should: 1) allow turning tabbing off and 2) always have tabbing turned off if cellSelection is off.\n. new property suppressTabbing, will be in next release. use css - easiest way is to inspect the dom and see what you want to style.\neg you can use the css class ag-floating-bottom-container\n. ok - i can fix it so this error  is not thrown (ie check for undefined) however i'd like to fix. can you advise how i can reproduce this in an example?\n. no feedback, so closing.. do what the example Deep Dive Example - Using forEachNode does:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-selection/index.php\njust change this bit:\nif (node.data.country === 'United States') {\n            node.setSelected(true);\n        }\nto check what you want to check on your data\n. thanks for feeding back the solution.\n. fixed. will be in todays release.\n. the browser is displaying the tooltip, so check if the browser setting can be changed.\n. the internationalization we support is explained here:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-internationalisation/index.php\n. we are always adding types as we go, out goal would be to type everything. i was going to just add a type for you for this instance, however it's an event, i need to spend some time and come up with a strategy for typing the events.\n. you need to be using the ag-Grid Angular 1 directive for it to work. sounds like you are not using the angular directive.\n. thanks for feeding back the solution.\n. setSelectedInitialValue is not documented as i don't intend for you to call. this does not tie in with the grid events - the grid uses it when rows that are already selected are read in while using virtual pagination. however if it works for you, happy for you to use it, just don't look for support or complain if the method changes int he future!! :)\nregards the issue, i see the grid behave just link a DOM item. so if you want to not listen on an event, either remove your listener, or have a flag so your listener knows it's the result of something you set. all the events in ag-Grid are synchronous, so if you call api.XXX(), then all events will have fired by the time the method returns.\n. are you using your own cellRenderer? if yes, then prevent the event from going to the grid by calling event.stopPropagation();\n. you can customise the menus. see the docs on the column menu and context menu. then get the default menu values, remove the toolpanel item, then return the new list with the toolpanel item.\n. this is because historically the grid was designed as a reporting tool, where the groups are aggregations on the underlying data. so it doesn't make sense to edit the groups.\nwe know the grid is used for other purposes now, and the requirement exists for editing the groups. the reason we have not changed it is time - we need to spend the proper time on this a review the design, possibly refactor to accommodate editing of groups (rather than hack a 'true/false' in ), put into examples (our tests) and document.\nso yea, only reason it's not done is time from us.\n. last release introduced editable group rows.. not true - the row model is default if it is NOT one of the following: viewport, pagination, virtual pagination\n:)\n. you can't. if you don't want the blank space, the you should have the columns fit the width of the grid. having the rows the width of the grid in any other way doesn't work, as it would then mess with the horizontal scrolling.\n. \"First off is when the rowCount is know and set, the scroll bar (thumb) used to be calculated upfront and never changed in size. This no longer seems to be the case.\"\n=> the rowCount only changes if you bring back more data in your datasource. to have it not change, make sure you set it via setVirtualRowCount(count, true) (the true means maxRowFound) and then never bring back more rows in your datasource.\n\"Secondly when there is no data being returned and params.failCallback() is called\" => this is for application errors - so how the grid behaves is not something i'm terribly concerned about. you should be popping up a message saying \"this app is having problems and cannot continue, please contact admin etc etc etc\". if its a normal use case that no rows exist after the call, you should be calling success callback with lastRow=0\n. 1. I then set rowCount on my grid options don't set it on your grid options, set it on your datasource. See the last example on this page: https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-pagination/index.php - it is a standard pagination example (not virtual pagination) however setting the row count on the datasource is done the same way.\n2. you don't need to set rows into the grid. you can call success with an empty list, and also set rowCount to zero ie successCallback([], 0)\n. thanks. fixed. will be in next release (planning one today or tomorrow).\nwhen editing, the grid was working on ctrl+v, ctrl+c, ctrl+x, ctrl+d, which messed up the edit. Now the grid ignores these if you are editing the cell.\n. we work going forwards only, sorry, it till be the next 6.x release\n. we just don't have the capacity to be putting patches against all historic releases\n. to get scroll lag working in Chrome, have:\nisScrollLag: function() { return true; },\n  suppressScrollLag: false,\nhowever what i would do is put the delayed rendering into your cellRenderer. i mean - have each cellRenderer with a timeout - so that chart is only rendered say if the row is on screen for more than 2 seconds - or you could have it so the charts are only rendered if the grid stops scrolling (you can listen for the viewportChanged event and time when you havn't heard this event for x milliseconds)\n. please see here, section 'Getting Data Out'\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-insert-remove/index.php\n. 1 Let me know if this type of filtering is how remoteFiltering works in agGrid.\n=> yes\n2 Let me know if remoteFIltering is part of the free edition.\n=> yes\n3 Refer me to a doc or example about how the remote/server filtering works.\n=> the examples online show it - the only difference is the examples don't contact a server. how your application contacts the server is up to you. the grid is responsible for gui presentation only, how you get the data is your job.\nsee second example on this page:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-pagination/index.php\nsee the comment\n// this code should contact the server for rows. however for the purposes of the demo,\n            // the data is generated locally, a timer is used to give the experience of\n            // an asynchronous call\n. yes in know about this. on my list. it's because the cell with the focus is no longer in the dom due to row virtualisation.\n. thanks for the report. tab navigation around fullWidth is not supported, from the documentation \"does not participate in the navigation, rangeSelection (ag-Grid Enterprise) or contextMenu (ag-Grid Enterprise) of the main grid.\"\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-master-detail/index.php\nto get this to work is a big chunk of work for us - so as a matter of priority, this is far down the list.\n. this should be fixed so it doesn't cause an error, although we don't plan to handle navigation on fullWidth, the grid shouldn't be printing errors to the console, need more graceful handling.. i believe this is fixed in the most recent version.. i understand. i've added this to my list of things to fix. but it will be a few weeks as i'm not going to be available for the next three weeks approx (my wedding, honeymoomn, and then a conference).\nin the mean time, you can set maxPagesInCache=2, this will limit the number of pages it tries to load. so if you scroll down, it will end up loading the last two and non others.\n. good your not stuck, lowers the priority. but i do want to fix it, it's not good.\n. tracked by AG-142\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/ag-grid-pipeline/. you say you call this.columnApi.autoSizeColumns() once, and then afterwards the grid is slow???\nor are you calling this.columnApi.autoSizeColumns() lots of times?\n. the event columnEverythingChanged gets fired when you set new column definitions or you set the column state. so i don't know why it was slowing things down (unless you were changing the column definitions logs, or setting the state lots, both of which i presume you were not doing).\nif you can provide a plunker with the issue, i can take a look? however with the above info, nothing else comes to mind.\nps cos you are working around it, sounds like you don't need an answer now, so closing.\n. set node.expanded = true / false\nthen call api.onGroupExpandedOrCollapsed(refreshFromIndex?)\nrefreshFromIndex? is optional - if you provide a row id, it will only refresh from that row - so if you expand a group, you only need to redraw from the rows below it.\n. can you reproduce in a plunker? none of my examples were impacted by any change - so it must be something in your setup that has a difference???\n. yes, they sound the same. as with the other issue i mentioned:\ni'm 99% sure the problem is with the height that you are setting on the div that contains ag-Grid.\neither you are not giving the div height, or you are using % height and not specifying height for the parent it is in (this is needed for % height to work).\nthe grid fills the width and height of the div you give it. so inspect your dom and work out why the div the grid is in isn't getting it's proper height.\n. no feedback so assuming fixed.. use processCellCallback to change the value for the cell for the fullWidth rows.\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-export/index.php\n. yes, use valueGetter, that can be a function.\n. checked\n. sorry for not responding, busy times.\nyou are right, the way to do it is to get your server to export it.\nthe grid uses pagination because there is to much data to transfer from the server to the client. if you could bring all the data across, then you wouldn't need to use pagination in the first place, and then the export would just work.\n. we plan on refactoring the pagination - to give it a face lift. in two months approx from now. will look at this then.\n. tracked by AG-143\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/ag-grid-pipeline/. since moving to client side pagination, this is no longer applicable.. not sure if still relevant, but try this if not already:\n\"colId should be strings, not numbers. update your plunker to use strings and it works perfect\"\nalso, can you verify, this is failing in latest 6.2.x? another customer had this issue and i fixed it. cant' remember what was the problem, but it's fixed.\nanother thing you can try is suppress column virtualisation (suppressColumnVirtualisation=true). it may be the grid isn't able to work out the width of the grid and is only rendering the first column. if this does fix it, then it is something to do with your framework that is stopping the grid from finding out it's true width. putting a grid refresh into a timeout may also fix this.\n. the problem is happening because the grid for some reason does not know how wide it is, so it is not rendering all the columns correctly.\nif you resize your browser, this should fix the problem (not saying it's a fix, just saying that when the grid finds our it's real size, then this issue goes away).\nis it only IE? can you recreate in a plunker?\n. i believe this issues is fixed in the latest. if not, please advise and i'll reopen.. changing it to a function was a new feature, release in the last month. so it's possibly you didn't see it creep in!!\n. @don-bluelinegrid different issue\n@aurhe no, there is no way. if we kept the old rows, then the grid would be out of sync, ie the data would not match the sort / filter you have applied. hence we remove the rows straight away.\n. grouping is not possible in viewport. this is because the data is on the server, it is not available to the grid to do the grouping.\nyou can still use the group cell renderer, however the data won't have any groups in it, so it won't make much sense.\n. when you want to expand the row via api, set node.expanded = true, then call api.\nonGroupExpandedOrCollapsed(refreshFromIndex), where refreshFromIndex (it's optional) can be the index to refresh rows from - in your case you want to refresh everything under the parent row (or just leave it out if you are unsure, get it working first!)\n. fixed. will be in next release.\n. so many issues with IE :(\nthanks, will be putting some time towards  IE at some point, i've it added to my list.\n. i see now that fullWidth causes issues in IE10. basically the fullWidth container covers everything but should be allowing mouse events to pass through. this pass through doesn't work in IE10. so i'm going to code it, so that fullWidht container is not present if you are not actually using it.. I see now that fullWidth causes issues in IE10. -> just this bit (with regards fullWidht) is fixed - now the fullWidth containers are hidden if the containers are empty. thus if fullWidth is causing issues, don't put in any fulWidth rows, then the container is now shown so doesn't consume mouse events.. reading back through this, i believe the issue is resolved. basically IE had issues with the overlay for fullWidth rows. so either don't use fullWidth rows, or set embedFullWidthRows=true (which then doens't use the overlay, and the fullWidth rows are sitting with the rest of the cells). not sure this makes sense. if it's external server side filtering, this has nothing to do with the grid???? just call 'api.onFilterChanged()' to get the grid to load the rows again. then your server filters however it wants, unrelated to the grid.\n. we have fixed all tree shaking issues in the current version 6.2.x - we are releasing it now. if there are any issues, please raise on the ag-grid-ng2 project, that's where the ng2 eye are looking in ag-grid team.\n. the design is to allow you to put whatever you want into the menu. see the docs on how to customise the context menu. then use the api to copy including the headers.\n. hi - submenu's is on our plan, but out list is long and this isn't near the top right now.\nputting react into the sub menus is not on our plan.\nwhat you could do to get around it is:\na) when user clicks a menu, you present your own popup with the different things you want them to choose between.\nb) turn off the context menu and create your own using the cellContextMenu event, the event will have the original mouse event (so you can get x,y coordinates) and also the cell's data (ie which row and column).\nps if you are an enterprise customer, you will get fast turnaround on the members forum. it has been weeks since i last went through the github issues.\n. oh - i closed as questions answered. there is another issue open for sub menus (or at least, it is on my private list here)\n. no.\nbut the cell editors are created when editing starts. you could create your own editor. OR you could extend one of the built in editors and just add a little to the init() method (the init method gets called when it starts).\neg:\n```\nimport {TextCellEditor} from 'ag-grid';\nclass MyEditor extends TextCellEditor {\n  public init(params) {\n    super.init(params);\n    console.log('editing started');\n  }\n}\n```\nexample is in TypeScript, if using JavaScript, the do similar with prototypes (i don't use JavaScript, so you will have to figure that one out yourself!!)\n. i'm 99% sure the problem is with the height that you are setting on the div that contains ag-Grid.\neither you are not giving the div height, or you are using % height and not specifying height for the parent it is in (this is needed for % height to work).\nthe grid fills the width and height of the div you give it. so inspect your dom and work out why the div the grid is in isn't getting it's proper height.\n. change log is here: https://www.ag-grid.com/change-log/changeLogIndex.php\n. @briebug you have to set height on the grid, so what you are doing is correct. this is mentioned in the docs, the grid div must be given height.\nng2 example here:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/best-angular-2-data-grid/\nexample has:\n<ag-grid-ng2 #agGrid style=\"width: 100%; height: 350px;\" class=\"ag-fresh\"\nthe grid is designed to fill the height of the div you give it (or the ag-grid-ng2 tag in the ng2 instance). Was there a reason for changing it to require a height?\n-> we didn't change it. the design was to always require % height. for some people it wasn't needed and I don't know why, but people (such as yourself) reported it worked, which was by accident.\nIMO it shouldn't require a height and it should be allowed to fill up whatever container it is in. It gives the developer the ability to restrict it to a height or allow it to expand as necessary.\n-> direct support for that is on our radar. but not at the top of our list right now.\nNow we end up with a double set of scrollbars for the grid and for the page.\n-> if you don't want scrolls in the grid, you can change the height dynamically yourself by changing the height when the row data changes and doing some maths.. change property autoSizePadding, it says how many pixels to add to the autosize. default is 4 (i think) to allow for some border and padding. if you change to 6 or 8, should sole all issues for you.\nthis property is also dependent on what styling people are adding to the headers - so there is no 'correct' answer.\n. no clue about it. i'm happy to take suggestion if anyone finds what it should be - but it's also tied to your theme (i presume, given the theme adds padding, border etc) so i am slow to have (for example) a lookup table to decide how many pixels to add based on browser, it could be different for everyone depending on platform and theme.\n. this is a javascript question. if you want access to the scope, you need to structure your code so that the listener you attach has access to it. you should not depend on this.\n. not really - source maps would be for ag-Grid developers - when we're developing ag-Grid. to include them in the distribution would be adding unnecessary additional size to the distribution.\nhowever - what you could / should do (just my opinion) is use the source files directly, if you want to see the original source files. the js files are in /dist/lib, and the TypeScript files are in /src\nthen you can build / compile yourself and add your own source maps.\n. cool, thanks. have fixed. will be in next release. 6.2.1+\n. the template must all fit inside one tag. you cannot start or end with whitespace or newline. this is because of how ag-Grid loads the template, it converts the template to a DOM object, eg a div or span. so your template should star/end with the same div or span (or whatever element is the root element).\n. i've updated the docs (will be in next release).\n. 1. yes, please see docs for toolpanel section 'read only functions'.\n   https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-tool-panel/index.php\n2. yes, see events\n   https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-events/index.php\n   columnRowGroupChanged\n3. please read the docs!!!\n. there is no storage used. if you set 100,000 rows into the grid, these 100,000 rows are just kept in the browser memory.\n. this is not possible. for the grid to be able to select, it needs to have the rows in memory.\nunder normal operation, virtual pagination loads the rows as they are needed. when you select a row, it's put into the grid's row selection. if you scroll down and the row is no longer needed by the grid, it keeps the rows that are selected, but disposes of everything else. this is so that the grid can give you the selected rows that you want. however if you try to select all, then it doens't have access to any of the rows except a) what is loaded for displaying on screen and b) what is already selected.\nif you want to have the rows selected as they come back, well then you are doing server side selection, this the grid cannot help you with. if you really really need it (i'd suggest you tell your users it's not possible) then you should ignore the grid's selection, implement your own, and do your own selection on the server side. you would also have to implement your own cellRenderer with your own checkbox selection logic.\n. i've checked the code - i don't see why it's not working. if you can provide a plunker with it not working, we can check.\nare you sure you are using the React component of ag-Grid? ie  ??\n. @harr041 thanks for the feedback, i believe that was the issue. i've made the change, will be in the next release. basically groupRowRendererFramework, groupRowInnerRendererFramework and fullWidthRowRendererFramework were getting ignored when getting set as properties in Angular 2 and React.\n. your plunker threw ag-grid-enterprise.js?ignore=notused22:23173 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'value' of null\nanyway, found it. fixed. will be in next release.\n. not possible. it is already requested so will close this issue. it's not so simple though, as if you have 50% columns moving, then what happens if you move another column around it?? anyway, the answer is frozen columns, columns that stay stuck on the left hand side. it's on our plan for not ETA yet, it's not scheduled into one of our releases yet.\n. your analysis is correct. the grid doesn't allow what you are trying, just not something we thought about.\nhowever you can provide your own header template. return a div object rather than html, that way you can then add your own logic (ie add or remove sort icons). then on the column, you can do:\ncolumn.addEventListener('sortChanged', mySortChangedFunc);\nthen in your listener, add or remove the icons in your header.\nif you don't have agHeaderCellLabel in your header, then the grid will not add the click listener.\n. cannot reproduce. i tried locally on edge and it's working fine.\ni'm wondering though - is it to do with your scaling? ie are you zooming your browser in our out, and maybe IE is then skipping a line of pixels?\nto be honest, i'm not very worried, this seems like a minor issue if only on some instances of edge.\n. this questions isn't formed correctly. there is no onMouseEnter event in ag-Grid. if you are looking how to do onMouseEnter in the browser, then this isn't an ag-Grid questions really.\n. thanks for the compliments. you can return the favor by getting your company to go enterprise :)\ni'm sure you can do this with the current api.\ngridApi.sizeColsToFit();\nvar widthAfterSizeColsToFit = columnApi.getColumn('myCol').getActualWidth();\ngridApi.autoSizeAllColumns();\nvar widthAfterAutoSize = columnApi.getColumn('myCol').getActualWidth();\nif (widthAfterSizeColsToFit > widthAfterAutoSize) {\n  gridApi.sizeColsToFit();\n}\nthe only item not in the documented API is column.getActualWidth(), but that's not going to change, it's core to how the columns work and i'm happy with it (no plan to change it).\n. sizeColsToFit and autoSizeAllColumns might cause unnecessary processing and/or DOM thrashing - not really, it's only resizing things, not creating / removing much in the dom, and if you call them in the same VM turn then you only have one DOM re-flow after both are finished.\n. what you say is almost right. you cannot split the group if marrychildren=true. eg see the example on marry children on this page:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-grouping-headers/index.php\nit is impossible to break up the first group. it is also impossible to move on of the other columns into the group, ie dragging 'sport' column to the left, you cannot insert it between 'athlete' and 'country'.\n. i don't speak whatever language that is!! sorry!\ncan you put it into english?\n. thanks for the translation!! it helps a lot :)\nyou have 2 options for pagination, see them explained here:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-pagination/index.php\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-virtual-paging/index.php\nfor each of these, you will need to implement something on your server, to read in the json file, and then to provide it to your client as it's needed via the datasource.\n. already fixed in yesterdays release.\n. if your custom cells are causing it to be slow, then you need to figure out what it is that is causing the slowness. that isn't something which is wrong with ag-Grid!! i'd suggest taking them out one by one, seeing where the problem is. maybe you can consider not showing the dropdowns and instead use ag-Grid editing features (or provide your own cell editor) - either way it means the dropdownds only appear when needed.\n. we don't have minimum requirements, once the browser works then the grid will work. as to how fast it will work - well Chrome and Firefox are much faster than Safari and Internet Explorer. IE is the slowest. The best advice I can give is implement a demo of what you want to do, then decide for yourself on your target platform.\n. @danielpetrov thanks for the ping. we appreciate any help we can get. we are a small team and try our best, but never do we claim to know more than that general world of users. there is defiantly things we can be helped on.\nif you want to provide a demo, we will pay you something for it - as we want to be fair - or at least give you a nice present like an iPad or something.\nanyway - for a demo to be useful, it must have proper documentation, both in our docs, and also great comments in the code.\ncurrently the demo has two grids - the standard and large. do you want to create a third? or would it be better to dispose the other two entirely? what you can do is create a third option and then propose a pull request. the documentation project you can also contribute to ag-grid-docs, maybe create a new page, and then we can copy / paste it into the main react page when it's all done (to minimise any merge conflicts).\nlet me know what you think.\nps - i don't check github regularly (we get hit to much) and am about to take two weeks holidays. however you can ping me on accounts@ag-grid.com (i'll reply, then you have my personal email, i dont want to post my email here)\nhaving answered your question, i'm closing the issue :)\n. sorry for late reply, i was busy getting married and doing conferences. happy to have you contribute. when you have more time, we can talk more :)\n. ps -

when the grid is deciding what rows to show, it adds in footer rows to any groups that are open.\non the export, it is exporting everything, even closed groups, so it's exporting before the footers come into play. if it were to include the footers, then it would also exclude the contents of the closed groups.\nit is fixable, with reworking how the export works, however it's a chunk of work, hence will leave this issue open and come back if i am more free sometime.\nwith regards the cellRenderers, it is not correct to use these for export, as they can return complex html, including html with logic. if you want to format for the export, then you should use processCellCallback (one of the export params)\n. tracked by AG-145\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/ag-grid-pipeline/. no -

Can you advise, is the grid destroy method getting called?\nIt sounds like everyone here is on Angular 1 right?\nIf you are using Angular 1 directive of ag-Grid, then the grid calls it's destroy method as follows:\n$scope.$on(\"$destroy\", function() {\n        grid.destroy();\n    });\nthe destroy then cleans up all resources inside the grid, so there should be no memory leak.\nso either a) the grid has a memory leak or b) the grid destroy method is not getting called (so something wrong with the Angular side or the config of your applications)\nso next steps, either:\na) someone debug through your code, put a breakpoint into the method above, confirm if the destroy method is called or not.\nb) create a plunker demonstrating this problem, i can then look. without something broken to work with, not a lot i can do.\nps - is everyone on this thread working for the same company / project?\n. i modified the plunker and added a dummy 'Saussages' object, that just creates a random array of 1000 elements. the same happens here. this suggests it isn't a grid problem, angular is not cleaning up.\nhere is my plunker\nhttps://plnkr.co/edit/bq0zNCSBo7tjTZBsS7wY?p=preview\ni suggest you take out ag-Grid, keep in Saussages, and raise this issue with Angular project\nin addition, i looked at what is holding the reference to ag-Grid - its' Angular, see the screenshot\n\nlooks like an AngularJS problem, so closing\n. for me it's not, lots of saussages get created. however either way, you can see form my screenshot that it's angular that is keeping a reference to the grid.\n. this is a standard garbage collection question? it looks like the scope is keeping a reference to the grid, so need to remove that reference in angular?\n. Assuming you can confirm this is an ag-grid issue, is there a workaround for this?\ni have no idea why it's happening. in the ag-Grid code, each row gets a scope, and it's created with:\nvar scope = parentScope.$new()\neach scope is then destroyed with:\n$scope.$destroy()\nso why this is ending up with a Angular keeping a reference to the grid, i do not know.\ni don't have a workaroud :(. sure reopened. but to be honest, we have no idea where to start, so please don't expect to get a solution.\nif someone wants to offer a solution, we are happy to take it on board.\nbut it seems pretty isolated, so someone who is an Angular expert could help??? (i used to use Angular 1, but i'm not an expert of it's internals, i'm expert on ag-Grid so have 50% of what's needed, if someone else can advise on the angular bit). any way to fix this found?. ok, i'll keep this open (and also move to JIRA), but we still have not clearer idea on this end why it's happening.. tracked by AG-153\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/ag-grid-pipeline/. when you scroll, the filter should disappear, i'll check this ....\n. ok just checked in, for next release, the menu will now hide when yous scroll the body.\n. go to here:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-virtual-paging/\nlook at last example, the button 'jump to 500' shows jumping to row 500\n. please check the docs, if putting callbacks on the gridOptions, you put 'on' in the method name\n. needs to be camel case, ie capital R\n$scope.gridOptions = {\ncolumnDefs: columnDefs,\nrowData: rowData,\nrowSelection: 'multiple',\nangularCompileRows: true,\n   onRowDoubleClicked: onSelectionChanged\n};. use cellClassRules, see them explained in the docs\n. sizeColumnsToFit takes into consideration the header, so i don't understand the question :(\n. grouping columns is free.\nthere is no difference with angular vs normal js versions, so use the online examples. all the examples are in standard javascript, but all features work in angular, angualr2, react etc.\n. I think that matching character code against a limited set of non-printable characters would be more flexible and faster. => can you provide an example please?\n. sorry, i'm a native english speaker, not much experience with other alphabets.\n. not true, i tested it, took out the check, then editing out not stop. eg enter new text, hit Enter, the cell doesn't exit edit mode (or maybe it is, but then doing into edit mode again directly after, i'm not sure). just giving quick feedback, didn't investigate to long, just trying to sweep github issues quickly.. tracked by AG-154\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/ag-grid-pipeline/. this is now done. i use this trick:\nstatic isEventFromPrintableCharacter(event: KeyboardEvent): boolean {\n        let pressedChar = String.fromCharCode(event.charCode);\n        if (_.exists(event.key)) {\n            // modern browser will implement key, so we return if key is length 1, eg if it is 'a' for the\n            // a key, or '2' for the '2' key. non-printable characters have names, eg 'Enter' or 'Backspace'.\n            return event.key.length===1;\n        } else {\n            // otherwise, for older browsers, we test against a list of characters, which doesn't include\n            // accents for non-English, but don't care much, as most users are on modern browsers\n            return Utils.PRINTABLE_CHARACTERS.indexOf(pressedChar)>=0\n        }\n    }. it's not possible. when you insert rows, the whole grid gets refreshed.\n. put in blank rows? then you just update the blank rows.\nto change the grid would require a lot of work, i don't have it coded to take care of all the different things that can change, basically it's a shotgun approach, when something like row count changes, it redraws everything.\n. thanks for positive feedback!\nto reset the pagination, set the datasource again. you don't need to change the datasource, just set the same one in again.\napi.setDatasource(newDatasource);\n. I have done that but it doesn't go to \"getRows\" of datasource because of that it won't initiate a new server request.\nyes it does, you must be doing something wrong!!!\nsee the first example here:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-pagination/\nwhen you change the page size, it creates a new datasouce and sets it, which then results in getRows(), so deffo works.\n. i don't know what's wrong, you appear to be doing it right. either a) debug through the grid code, see if you can work it out or b) create a plunker, then someone else can debug and figure it out.\n. not possible. only way is for you to set the height yourself based on your own maths after you set the data in.\n. excel => on our radar, ETA next 2 months\ncheckbox for select all, unselect all rows => not high priority given you have the API,\npage size dropdown at pagination section => you can do that yourself? as per the example online for pagination?\nand auto grid height => on our radar, but no ETA, yet to be scheduled\nif we purchase the enterprise version can you provide those => depends how big a customer, get in touch with our sales team to show interest and talk licenses! we can then discuss.\n. yes there is event for grouping, please check the events on the documentation page, all the events are listed.\n. if using angular 1, don't use refresh method. not supported\n. works for me, i took this example:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-virtual-paging/virtualPagingServerSide.html\ni added in this code:\nsetInterval( function() {\n    gridOptions.api.setFilterModel(null);\n    gridOptions.api.onFilterChanged();\n}, 10000);\nand it cleared the filter and worked 10 seconds after loading.\nps it's onFilterChanged, not onFilterChange\nif you provide a plunker with it broken, i can look\n. don't use drag events, use the column moved events\n. the column event doesn't have the api, use the api on gridoptions instead\n. sizeColumnsToFit does not work when forPrint=true -> it is not supported. forPrint doesn't use scrollbars so it doesn't make sense.\n$scope.gridOptions.api.sizeColumnsToFit(); should work\nplease provide a plunker.\nps closing - this is not a problem with ag-grid, issues are for items that need fixing in ag-grid\n. this is not something broken in ag-grid, issues are for tracking work items needed in ag-grid, so closing.\nthis is a general javascript question, please google for answers!!\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/511088/use-javascript-to-place-cursor-at-end-of-text-in-text-input-element\ndo this in afterGuiAttached() method\n. no.\nbut the editable can be a function. so what you could do is:\n1. make all cells not editable. (function returns false, can store false in a flag).\n2. when you want to start editing, configure function to return true.\n3. call api.startEditingCell(params) (see the docs)\n4. in a timeout, set flag for editable back to false.\n. when i drag the column, it does not sort. cannot reproduce.. if you want live data from the server, you can use viewport (enterprise only).\nyou can also use these methods, they won't destroy the columns:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-insert-remove/\n. can you be more specific? we already allow editing like excel (and handson table) i thought. insert and remove rows from the context menu? that's interesting.\nyou can pull a row in the lower right corner, to overwrite values from other cells\ni never knew that. that would be tricky to implement, which makes me wonder, is it worth the effort. ie how many people would actually use this, if it takes use 2 weeks to implement, i'm thinking we would be better off implementing something else.\nbtw - you can copy down using ctrl+d. if we also implemented ctrl+r for copy right, then you would have everything you need right?. noted re unit tests.. tracked by AG-155\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/ag-grid-pipeline/. solved so closing. correct answer btw.. '''After changing gridOptions'''\n=> really depends on what you mean here. there is no such thing as 'changing grid options'. if you want  a new grid, you need to destroy the old one and create a new one again from scratch. it isn't designed to just change to a new grid options object.. what you can do is cancel the edit (return true from isCancelAfterEnd()) and then I guess display a popup to the user, telling them it was not valid?\nthen call the api.startEditing(value) and abuse (not supported!!) the charPress parameter to provide the text the user had entered (which will then be what the editor starts with). this is assuming your using the text editor, if a custom editor, then better, as you are in full control of charPress.. no idea what's happening here.\nthe __agGridSetProperty is used inside the method initialiseAgGridWithWebComponents() which i am guessing you are not using. so there is something about your setup that is causing it. if you can reproduce in a plunker, someone can possibly take a look.\nps this isn't an issue with ag-Grid, github is for tracking issues we need to work on, so closing.\n. spoke ag angular up - closing\n. how to add and remove rows explained here:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-insert-remove/\n. what you say is true, however it's working as intended. the problem is that the css classes would be added and never removed. eg if you returned 'my-blue' as a class first time around, and then the second time around you returned 'my-green', then the row will end up with both 'my-blue' and 'my-green' instead of green replacing blue.\nthis is where cellClassRules come into play, as they add logic for each class. in time we could add similar to rows, but for now it doesn't exist.\nsuggestion - can you use cellClassRules to achieve what you want?\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-cell-styling/. @coderash01 that is true, it was implemented before viewport came on the scene.\nyou could use cellClassRules, they get called again when data changes.. why cant you not put this into your code, before you include the ag-Grid library?. the module should be included usign the string name of ag-Grid,\nvar module = angular.module(\"app\", [\"agGrid\"]);\ni am not familiar with the mechanism you are using, where you are not using strings for the dependencies.\n. PPS we don't check Github daily - if you are an enterprise customer, you should use the members forum and we will get back to you promptly! :). this wasn't something on our end - our license key has nothing to do with angular versions.. for custom sorting, use colDef.comparator\nexplained here:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-sorting/. that was an error. they are now in. will be in next release.. tracked by AG-156\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/ag-grid-pipeline/. this is now done. we will release later this week v10.1 which will support Redux stores.. not supported.. everything is supported, ag-grid-react is a wrapper around ag-grid, so no features are left out. afraid we don't have time to give examples of all the features in all the frameworks, however if you provide a plunker we can take a look. it should be as simple as providing localText as you say you do.. fixed. will be in next release (we are doing it today). thanks for positive feedback.\ndon't use 'fromIndex', i actually took that out in v7, it was for a performance gain in the grid that doesn't get used anymore.\nactually don't use onModelUpdated, that gets fired whenever the displayed rows change, this could be after sort, filter, group open / close.\nthe problem is the binding you are doing with React - the grid works like a state machine, so after you call api.setRowData(newData), then you know the grid is ready with that data, and you can then call forEachNode() and be sure the data you set in is there.\nhowever you are using React, so the binding of the property is done afterwards without your control.\nif the data is given to the grid at the start, then you can do forEachNode in onGridReady, it will be available then. otherwise, after you set the data (if not at the start), then do your forEachNode check in a timeout, that way it will give React the chance to update the property first.. no. but you can highlight a range, then press ctrl+d to copy it down. so copy to first cell (or row), then ctrl+d to fill a range.. to be honest, i didn't fully understand what it is you have implemented, so can't answer if it should be default or not. can you explain a bit more what it is you did? (a movie would be great, but if you are not set up to capture and share movies easily, don't worry, just text). ah right, gotcha. i'll put this on my list.. cool, thanks. will take a look when i get to it in my list :). tracked by AG-157\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/ag-grid-pipeline/. done, will be in next release.. no, this is an issue we need to fix.. it's in the pipeline. there is another issue open for this so closing this one.. then don't use pagination??? the default operation of the grid is to not us paging.. done. will be in next release. Added $scope to cellEditor params. yes it's needed to host the little mini React engine for the cell - that's how react works - it needs a parent div for us to inject the cell into.\nif interested, here is the code:\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid-react/blob/master/src/agReactComponent.ts#L23\nfor styling, this element is passed to the react cellRenderer as parameter reactContainer, maybe this can help you?\n. not sure what you mean, but no, nothing that even sounds like what you are asking for. the customisation of the cells ends with the cellRenderer, nothing at the row level (with the exception of the fullWidth feature, but that's not what you want, as there are no cells in that instance). you can't, once the localText is provded, it cannot be changed :(. no plans to address. if someone wants to suggest a PR we can consider, however this is the first time someone has pointed this out, which mean's its not a high priority for us (we prioritise things a lot of people ask for, and prioritise even more when it's paying customer).. tracked by AG-158. can you give example? do you mean, you could potentially want 'x' key to move to the next or previous cell?\nbtw, we've just implemented api.tabToNextCell() and api.tabToPreviousCell(), so you could call these if you want (these will be in next release). so if i add option to 'suppressTabNavigation' and 'suppressKeyboardNavigation' then what you want will work?. these methods might help:\napi.tabToNextCell();\napi.tabToPreviousCell();\n. tracked by AG-159\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/ag-grid-pipeline/. use cellClassRules to apply classes to cells.\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-cell-styling/\nthen you will need to refresh the cell.\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-refresh/\n. thanks for reporting back and closing.. no, but it's on our list of things to fix.. i searched the code for '.ag-body' and couldn't find.\nwhere are you referring to?. .ag-bodies that have 0 clientWidth have 0 width because they are hidden under tabs -> agreed, but nothing i can do here, if grid not visible, then no way for it to know how to spread the columns. however i don't think this is your problem, the problem is....\nCalling gridOptions.api.sizeColumnsToFit() seems to call sizeColumnsToFit for all grids that were defined that should definitely no happen. something wrong with your setup! the gridOptions.api as a reference to ONE gridPanel object, and calls sizeColumnsToFit() on that. if you provide a plunker I can take a look? otherwise you can try debugging through it, see what is happening?\nmy guess is you have somehow confusing references to the gridOptions, or somehow getting the grids mixed up.\n. no feedback, closing.. if using angular 1, then the data is on the $scope for the row, so you can:\n'<span title=\"Claim No\" class=\"dummylink \" ng-click=\"ClaimIdClickEvent(data.xxx)\">' + params.value + '';\nthis is not an issue with ag-Grid we need to fix, so closing issue, Github project is for tracking issues with ag-Grid!. this is a JavaScript question, not an issue with ag-grid, so closing\nif using angular 1, then 'this' needs to be on your scope, i dont understand what you are trying to do, but if you did want 'this' then it would be:\n{\nheaderName: \"Patient Name\", field: \"patientName\", width: 250, enableValue: true, suppressMenu: true, suppressFilter: true, suppressSorting: true, enableRowGroup: true,\ncellRenderer: function (params) {\nparams.$scope.this = this;\nreturn '' + params.value + '';\n}\n. this was raised before. all the browsers allow duplicate dom ids, yes it goes against the spec, but it doesn't break anything.\nwe plan to change this in the future but not high priority. as there is another issue open for this, am closing.. best way to understand this is to debug through your cellRenderer, look inside the params.data item.\nfor the grouped items (ie the parent rows, the ones you expand), the data will be missing if you are not doing any aggregation. so i'm guessing you are not doing any aggregations.\nso \ncellRenderer: function (params) {\n  if (params.data && params.data.claimNumber != undefined) {\n    return '<input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"select\" ng-click=\"GetCheckBoxValues()\" />';\n  } else {\n    return \"\";\n  }\n}. after you set the data, call api.ensureNodeVisible(0). after you set the data, call api.ensureNodeVisible(0). this is a duplicate. this is a duplicate. thank you for feeding back and closing \ud83d\udc4d . thank you for feeding back and closing \ud83d\udc4d . if you don't want to 'enter and exit edit mode', then don't use a cellEditor, just use a cellRenderer.. if you don't want to 'enter and exit edit mode', then don't use a cellEditor, just use a cellRenderer..

including far more things in the params. could end up with everything in there, by which case then i'd wonder why not just use the gridApi?\nwhat would be nice is an api to get a page in the cache. however am slow to do that also, because we have plans to refactor that further, and once we expose something in the api, we are making breaking changes.\nwhat you can do is this hack: given the index, you can work out the page number (page size % row index), then you can access the page as follows:\napi.virtualPageRowModel.virtualPageCache.pages[x]\nwhere x is the page number you want\n. as this is a question about your app and not ag-grid, i'm closing the issue. ag-grid issues are for things we need to fix in ag-grid.\nthis doesn't mean that someone can make helpful comments below.. grid.api.setColumnDefs is correct. closest thing is event viewportChanged, the event has the index of the first and last rows rendered.\nthe default rowBuffer is 10, so 10 rows are rendered above and below the grid. you can set the rowBuffer to zero to get the viewport to be in sync with what you see.\n. to toggle selection, change the rowSelection property.\nalternatively, keep selection off, then use the grid api for selection (add your own click listener).. see examples here\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-master-detail/. i believe this was fixed in 7.1.0 (a lot of the pinned stuff was refactored with the introduction or RTL).\nif not, please report back. also report how to reproduce as i'm not aware of this issue.. to clarify, this is to do with cellEditor and ValueGetter, it's nothing specific to Angular 2.\nthe behaviour is how the grid is expected to work.\nthe valueGetter should be returning the value to he cellRenderer, not a formatted version of it.\nwhat you need to do is restructure what your valueGetter does, so it passes to the editor what you want to pass to your server.. not that i'm aware of. the gridOptionsWrapper is internal to the grid. i've no problem with you using it (up to you if you want to), however it's internal and not documented, so we can change the implementation and it's not considered a break change.\nthe datasource is provided by you, so you should already have a reference to it?\ngiven you have the datasource, i don't see why the grid should allow you to get it, and we dont' like writing code that is

(then you don't have id's for the previous page, assuming i understand)\nas a whole, i do think this is to specific to be part of the core grid, instead should be in the datasource.\n. feature requests accepted. tracked by AG-227 AG-228 AG-229. we would never even consider moving to enterprise level because of the huge file size -> the ag-Grid-Enterprise is only fractionally larger than ag-Grid. the core of the code is to do with standard features, not enterprise features.. ta, will raise jira at medium priority. i can't remember off the top of my head why i choose not to have hidden scrolls on the other rows.. just tested on latest, cannot reproduce. i remember fixing this a few weeks ago, so believe it to be fixed in the latest.. fixed. will be in next release.. fixed. will be in next release.. you need v8.0.x for EVERYTHING, not just ag-grid-react, the first two digits must match when combining the ag-grid projects.\nit sounds like you don't have right version set for ag-grid or ag-grid-enterprise.\nif still an issue, please raise in the forum (get access if you are on a trial). this is an api method setVirtualRowCount()\ndoesn't this do what you want?. setVirtualRowCount() does the exact thing I wanna do right?\nyes i think it does - but not 100% sure.\nthe grid should show exactly what is on your server side, so if you are showing rows 0 to 9, then that should be rows 0 to 9. i am afraid you are introducing groups on the UI, which do not exist on the server, which are impacting the row indexes. if this is the case, and you are changing the indexes, then it will not work like that. the infinite scrolling row model mandates that it's a linear list without introducing groups into the indexes.\non the other hand, if you are not introducing groups, then the rowCount should do as you want. when the grid reads more rows from the server, the indexes should align.. fixed, will be in next release. and yes, both variations are fixed.. i don't follow - when you call refreshVirtualPageCache(), all the pages are refreshed. advise what is wrong with this?. went to reproduce this, but couldn't. a lot of work was done in the loading of blocks when implementing the new Enterprise Row Model (this shares logic with the Infinite Scrolling Row Model). so i believe it to be fixed now.. i have tested this locally on the latest and it is working. i believe i fixed it a few weeks ago - i came across it myself when looking at something else. will be fixed in next release.. thanks for raising.\nwe are a team of 6 now, 3 of us are full time dev, from those 3, 1 of us is doing frameworks full time (mostly angular 2, as that's causing the most noise these days) and the other two of us are doing core development constantly adding new features.\nwe have a big backlog of items to get through.\nthis issue sounds like \"work harder guys, you not getting all the features in the world expects\"\nif you want to raise specific issues or feature requests, please do.\n. sorry, i am just not following the question.\nwe are working on an API, which will have something like:\napi.nextPage()\napi.previousPage()\napi.whatIsTheCurrentPage()\nwill that work?. setting page number will be part of the new api. i'm closing this issue as it's already covered by the work i'm currently doing! it will be in the next release. thanks.. use the attribute marryChildren on the group, this will stop the children from breaking apart.. just fixed this, will be in next release.. this has been raised before - but there is nothing we can do. if you pin lots of columns, then yes, you will not be able to scroll horizontally.\ncan you suggest what it is you expect to happen when you pin to many columns?\n(note, i'm going to update the docs to say this is user error)\n. done. will be in next release.\nCallbacks processCellForClipboard() and processCellFromClipboard() now get invoked with doing Ctrl + D (copy range down)\n. cannot reproduce. i went to main demo and set some column state (sort, filter, reorder) and then called gridOptions.api.setRowData([]); (using the debug console) and the data reset, but all column state was retained.\nmaybe you are loosing filter because you don't have newRowsAction='keep'. cannot reproduce.\nsee image, i went to our demo using firefox, hit 'auto size' button, and it worked.\n\n. fixed. will be in next release.. this is now fixed.. you can turn this property on / off yourself, so easy to add something to the grid that listens for changes in group columns and then sets this property, it's not needed to be in the grid on the column level.\n. this is fixed in latest. verified from latest version on our website.\n\n. the method should take an array of col id's. these are strings.\nsee the docs on id's\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-column-definitions/\ndo not pass in col defs.. yes, the colDef is in there. that's historic. we will be removing that soon because of this issue. however the solution for your application is to use the id's.\nthe codDef's used to work, as the column contained a reference to the original colDef, however since we implemented defaultColDef (it's a grid option), the colDef is now merge of both the default and the actual, thus it's a new colDef that the column contains. so comparing by colDef reference doesnt' work anymore.\nsorry for the confusion.\n. internally we have renamed our jira\nAG-395 drop colDef from the colKey\n. this is a tricky one to solve. thanks for raising. i have added 'tabbing into the grid' as a jira, it's number AG-419\ntwo solutions i see:\n+ when user tabs into the grid, somehow put the focus on the first row - which would be tricky if the user is scrolled down.\n+ let the user decide somehow how to handle this. i think this is a can of worms, whatever we implement is bound to not work for everyone, as how you should tab into a grid that is scrolled half way down is open to user interpretation. eg if 1000 rows, and you are scrolled half way down, do you focus on row 500 (the first visible row) or row 1? and if row 500, what if the grid has some rows in the buffer? (the grid can draw a few rows extra, a buffer of rows above and below the viewport), then again what happens if a row is half visible?\nbecause of the difficulties present, it may be better to document how to catch the tab event, and then let the user decide which row / cell gets the focus. it would be ag-grid's job to make sure this callback mechanism exists for the user.. if you set embedFullWidthRows=true, this will fix the problem. see docs for what embedFullWidthRows does.. will be in next release.. looking at this now. i can't reproduce. \ni tried the following:\n1. go to https://www.ag-grid.com/example.php\n2. drag 'country' column to group zone, so it groups by country\n3. use column menu to show / hide columns.\nresult => everything is working fine, the group column stays.\nbecause you are using React, i'm guessing that somehow, because of how you have the grid configured, that it is totally resetting the columns each time, rather than just setting visibility on the individual column. this is strange, as the column, that you are using, defiantly doesn't do this. however it's all i can think of.\nnext steps - i don't think this is an issue with ag-Grid. because you are using grouping, i'm guessing you are an enterprise customer, in which case, can you bring this issue to the forum? however the forum guys will be hit with the same issue i have, which is not reproducible. so next steps for them would be to reproduce. best way to reproduce is to proved an example, either using Plunker (or similar) or a Github project.. this is a duplicate.\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/issues/853\nalso tracked by AG-121\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/ag-grid-pipeline/. hi Don, looking into this, i think there is misunderstanding on what is happening here. let me explain how things are working under the hood. then you can ask a finer tuned questions.\n\n\nThe grid's filtering works of the grid's row model. This all happens before the rendering of the cells - and it is the rendering of the cells that uses fullWidth as an option. In other words, fullWidth has no impact on the filtering. So the filtering is done on the data for that column, regardless of what you show in your fullWidth component. So if you have a piece of row data, with the value 'test' for column 'AAA', then putting 'test' into your quick filter will pass this row regardless of whether you use this 'test' data in your fullWidth renderer or not.\n\n\nIf your fullWidth component has some text that it displays, eg \"Normal full width row at index\", then searching for this text will come back with nothing, as that's only in your view, not in the model.\n\n\nIf you are using Flower Nodes, then the flower node will pass the filter if the node it is attached to will pass the filter - in other words, flower nodes will always be present if their parents are present, and only if their parents are present. The parents are what the filter works on. This is regardless of you using fullWidth or now.\n\n\nIf using the grid grouping, then the groups will exist if one or more of the children pass the filter. This is regardless of you using fullWidth or now.\n\n\nI think you are expecting the fullWidth and filtering to work differently.\nWith the above information, can you rephrase your question now knowing how it is supposed to work?\n. this is not something the grid was designed to do, however luckely i believe it can be done using fullWidth and flowerNode.\ndo the following configuration:\n```\ngridOptions = {\n    doesDataFlower: function() {\n        // every node should flower. if you are using the grids grouping, then only the lowest level\n        // nodes can flower anyway, which is what you want i presume.\n        return true;\n    },\n    // set this to a large number so that every group / flower will be expanded by default\n    groupDefaultExpanded: 9999,\n    // use fullWidth for all the flowers\n    isFullWidthCell: function(rowNode) {\n        return rowNode.flower;\n    },\n    // use a cellRenderer for fullWidth\n    fullWidthCellRenderer: FullWidthCellRenderer,\n   ..... // etc with the other options\n}\n// cellRenderer for full width is simple\nfunction FullWidthCellRenderer() {}\n// the params will be passed the data item of the parent\nFullWidthCellRenderer.prototype.init = function(params) {\n    var tempDiv = document.createElement('div');\n    tempDiv.innerHTML = 'This is the inside part of the full width, country is ' + params.data.country + '';\n    this.eGui = tempDiv.firstChild;\n};\nFullWidthCellRenderer.prototype.getGui = function(params) {\n    return this.eGui;\n};\n```\nso with the above:\n\nthe fullWidth will show if the filter passes the main row.\nthe order will always be correct, the leaf will always appear under the right row.\nordering and filtering will not impact the leaf appearing always after the parent.\nthe expand / collapse will not be shown, unless you a) use the provided 'group' cellRenderer or provide your own expand / collapse functionality in your own cellRenderer.\nhave an extra data attribute on the data for the fullWidht row. to have the data included in the quick filter, either a) include an extra column and have it hidden (colDef.hide=true) or b) put a custom getQuickFilterText on ONE of the colDefs and include the extra text you want to filter on in the quick filter.\n\ni believe the above is it! so closing the issue.. thank you for raising. i have created a JIRA for this AG-424, so it will get considered next times we decide what gets into a release.\nin the mean time, it is possible to have your own complex filters using an API. we call this External Filter\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-filter-external/\n. i tried to recreate this with our demo - i change the editor to be the provide 'popupSelect' editor.\nwhat i experienced was when the cell was to low, the popup went up, to stop the popup appearing off the browser.\nthe browser provided select though is not good here to demonstrate, as the grid places the select, but then when you click on the select, and the dropdown appears, then it's the browser that places the contents list, not the grid.\nthe grid will keep popups it controls within the bounds of the grid. this can be seen in our demo using the 'richSelect' (used on the country menu), when you edit a country in a row near the bottom, the popup is places so it does not overflow outside of the grid.\ni did not check with angular component, however it should make no difference.\nplease can you describe how to recreate this using one of the online demo's in our docs? that will help us decide if it's expected behaviour or a bug.\n. i have just checked the latest release v10.1 on iPad pro and cannot reproduce.\ni went to www.ag-grid.com/example.php on an iPad pro and was able to click the checkbox in the header to select all rows. it worked fine. tapping outside of the checkbox didn't select the checkbox.. if you have a refresh on the cellRenderer, then refresh will get called instead of ripping the cell out. you will have the ability to not do anything in your refresh method if you choose. i'll keep the AG-524 open though, it's a valid query.. this is fixed in latest v11. fixed. will be in next release.. fixed. will be in next release.. it would depend on the PR. typically we look at the PR's for inspiration, and then implement ourselves with the idea. but we will take it seriously.. i fixed this a few months ago, i didn't realise there was an open issue for it.\nthe cells are now compiled after cell editors are put in. this is the line of code that does it:\nhttps://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid/blob/master/src/ts/rendering/cellComp.ts#L955\n. the params is a throw-away object - once the grid passes it to you, it throws it away, it doesn't keep it for keeping things up to date\nif you want the index, use rowNode.rowIndex, the rowNode is passes as a param (params.node)\nyou can also listen for indexes changes to the node:\nrowNode.addEventListener('rowIndexChanged', myListener);\n... if you do this, remember to remove the listener\nrowNode.removeEventListener('rowIndexChanged', myListener);\n. i have put this in - but i can't test, as my browser doesn't use the code path. the code path is:\nstatic isEventFromPrintableCharacter(event: KeyboardEvent): boolean {\n        let pressedChar = String.fromCharCode(event.charCode);\n        if (_.exists(event.key)) {\n            // modern browser will implement key, so we return if key is length 1, eg if it is 'a' for the\n            // a key, or '2' for the '2' key. non-printable characters have names, eg 'Enter' or 'Backspace'.\n            return event.key.length === 1;\n        } else {\n            // otherwise, for older browsers, we test against a list of characters, which doesn't include\n            // accents for non-English, but don't care much, as most users are on modern browsers\n            return Utils.PRINTABLE_CHARACTERS.indexOf(pressedChar) >= 0\n        }\n    }\nanyway, what you say makes sense, so i've checked it in.\n. workaround - set it explicitly to 'undefined'. this was done on purpose, to allow for quicker comparing when you don't get impacted by case.\nto have it work as previous, attach your own 'default' comparator to the default col def, ie:\ngridOptions = {\n  defaultColDef = {\n      comparator: function(a,b) {\n          if (typeof a === 'string') {\n               return a.localCompare(b);\n          } else {\n               return (a > b ? 1 : (a < b ? -1 : 0));\n          }\n      }\n  }\n  ...\n}\n. fixed. will be in next release.. for second bit (loading), use a loading icon for the blank rows, like what the online demo's do. i've looked into this, and the behaviour is consistent. this is because the filtering is done on the server side in infinite row model.\nin the In Memory Row Model, when you have rows, and you then filter to remove all rows, no overlay is displayed.\nin Infinite row model, this is what is modelled to be consistent. a 'no rows' result goes down the path as 'all results are filtered out' (which may or may not be true, but the grid doesn't know that).\nhere is a plunker showing how to achieve this behaviour:\nhttps://plnkr.co/edit/geLmjDtJK1GOJW891nw9?p=preview\n. thanks for raising, looking into it now.. noted. will fix.. fixed. will be in todays release.. thanks for raising. looking into it.. @jogibear9988 what did you have in your examples that was different? all our examples are working, so maybe you are doing something particular in your cell renderer?\n. ok fixed. jira 706.\nbasically the code was:\nif (typeof cell === 'object') {\n  // assume it was DOM Element or Node\n} else {\n  // assume it was string template\n}\nnow it's\nif (typeof cell === 'string') {\n  // assume it was string template\n} else {\n  // assume it was DOM Element or Node\n}\nif you give your use case (provide a simple example of the cellRenderer that was broken) then we can test before we release later today, otherwise closing.. we have fixed this locally. thanks for the patch, however it doesn't cover all the use cases.. thanks. fixing now.. fixed. will be in today's patch release v13.0.1.. problem appears to be with the grid expanding the lowest level groups when in pivot mode. the lowest level groups we call 'leaf groups', ie groups that contain leafs.\nso if you are pivoting and grouping by 'Language' and 'Country', then you should be able to expand language and see country, but you should not be able to expand country to see the child records (as the child records are aggregated into the pivot columns).\nthe grid [this is the bug] is rendering the leaf groups as expanded when the group is opened. what the grid should do is always render the leaf groups as closed even if they are open (vai the API, or maybe they are open via the UI before the grid was put into pivot mode).\ni have this ready to check in, but i'm not going to check it in for todays patch release as it would require full regression (to late in the day to include it). to fix locally, instead of calling 'expand all', you can iterate through all the groups yourself and expand them like this:\napi.forEachNode( function(rowNode) {\n  if (rowNode.group && !rowNode.leafGroup) {\n    rowNode.setExpanded(true);\n  }\n});\n. jira is AG-719\n. we had some issues with icons in 13.0.0, please update to 13.0.1 and try again.\nif still broken, then need more info, as the examples on our website are working, you are doing something particular that we need to reproduce. how can we reproduce?\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-viewport/\n. the method takes an event object, not an event string, should be:\nvar event = {\n            type: 'filterModified'\n        };\n        api.dispatchEvent(event);. my apologies, this change missed the change log.\nas part of making the grid go faster in version 13, we made a small change to the ICellRenderer interface.\nnow there is a method afterGuiAttached(params) which gets the eGridCell. \nyour component can have both init() and afterGuiAttached(). the first gets called before the component is put into the dom. the second is called after the component is put into the dom and is provided the dom references.\nthis was necessary due to the different rendering engine we now have where the DOM is built after init() is called (so the dom items are not available at this stage).. this is now in\nhttps://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid/commit/29e2d9cd1ac422ba01d6e56a25650b9415f698e3\ndidn't accept the PR as we program against branch 'latest', not 'master'. fixed. will be in next release. thanks.. thank you. i have applied this manually (to avoid confusion of branches, i've put this manually into the next release (latest) branch, rather than risk getting it applied to master branch). https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid/commit/a3d1fdacd01ab39f8800f5710b4b7cc18cb0cb1c. cannot reproduce this one. however this sounds like something i fixed a few weeks ago and is already released. please take a look at latest (or what's on our website now) and retest, should see it's gone.. the solution above is correct, it's a CSS issue with browser focus, not a grid issue.\nthe grid has it's own internal focus mechanism, where it puts a CSS border on the cell.\nhowever chrome also puts a blue border on focused cells, which is something at the browser level and we cannot prevent.\nto stop the default browser focus border, apply the CSS as described above.. worked on this and set up and example and cannot reproduce. however i also looked at the code that is creating the params, and it is taking it from the same place, so not possible for them to be out of sync. you can see it here:\nhttps://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid/blob/14.1.0/src/ts/rendering/cellComp.ts#L720\nthe data for params comes from rowNode.data, so not possible for them to be different.\n. now fixed, will be in next release.. just fixed. will be in next release.. fixed. will be in next release.. sorry for the long wait on this, we are hiring people and trying to catch up on everything. we regards this issue, we no longer use this mechenism for calculating the grids dimensions. instead we use CSS flex. so the suggest code change is no longer relevant. thanks for the input.. auto-height no longer works in the same way. now auto-height works like the other rows and the whole grid is not refreshed.. to work around this problem, put a cell renderer into the config as follows:\ncellEditor: 'richSelect',\n                cellEditorParams: {\n                    values: [\n                        \"Bob\",\n                        \"Harry\",\n                    ],\n                    cellRenderer: function(params) { return params.value; },\n                }\ni've worked out what's going on, so you can expect a fix in the next release.. code complete. fix will be in next release.. looking at this now, i don't see what the issue is.\nsee this plunker, i've got the first column set up to use cellRendererFramework for both the cellRenderer and also the cellEditorParams.cellRendererFramework\ncan you alter the plunker to demonstrate what it not working please?\nhttps://plnkr.co/edit/SSmeJj315ryEqx8ytOAf?p=preview. i've noticed there was a problem, when you open the rich select, the 'selected value' cell is not using the cellRendererFramework. I have just fixed this and will be in the next release.. this is now done. will be in next release. property is suppressRowHoverHighlight. just fixed this, will be in next release.. fixed. will be in next release.. fixed. will be in next release..

If someone wants to steal your license key and effectively pirate ag-Grid then there is nothing we can do to stop that.. because events are asynchronous in ag-Grid, when you get the onContextMenu event, it is to late to prevent default. so there is no way to fix this, as you are processing the event after the context menu is displayed.\nto get around this, add a listener directly to the grid for when the grid receives the context menu event, and then cancel the event from here. to prove this, i hacked one of the examples, please see this plunker using the free version of ag-Grid, the context menu is now not shown.\nhttps://plnkr.co/edit/rer2Sff3kKNlK7LiphXg?p=preview\n. just pass in 'null' for now, the parameter only gets used when generating events, so when you listen to events you know what triggered it.. thanks. i've updated this locally and checked in against our 'latest' branch (for current dev). will be in next release.. fixed, will be in next relase. fixed, will be in next relase. thanks for the PR, however we cannot accept.\nthe problem is with how our richSelect works - which is an alternative to the browser Select widget.\nnormally for HTML Select, when you open the select drop down, then when you click anywhere on the screen, the select closes. so by accepting this PR, then the select popup will stay open even when the user clicks somewhere else on the screen.\nin hind sight what we should of done is 'clicking outside the grid stops editing' should be the default. or even clicking anywhere in the grid (not just another cell, eg clicking a floating filter or on tool panel) should also stop the editing. however this would be a bigger change, and a breaking change, so appetite to do this at this point is low.. thanks for the PR, however we cannot accept.\nthe problem is with how our richSelect works - which is an alternative to the browser Select widget.\nnormally for HTML Select, when you open the select drop down, then when you click anywhere on the screen, the select closes. so by accepting this PR, then the select popup will stay open even when the user clicks somewhere else on the screen.\nin hind sight what we should of done is 'clicking outside the grid stops editing' should be the default. or even clicking anywhere in the grid (not just another cell, eg clicking a floating filter or on tool panel) should also stop the editing. however this would be a bigger change, and a breaking change, so appetite to do this at this point is low.. we have completely changed direction with the resizeObserver - I believe the code this PR is referring to is no longer part of latest ag-Grid.. we have completely changed direction with the resizeObserver - I believe the code this PR is referring to is no longer part of latest ag-Grid..

Anyway, I don't think it is really possible to make the bootstrap themes work in your grid, basically because you don't have table, tbody, tr, th and td's. Only div's (and for me it's perfect the way you've done it)\nThere is anyway other approach that developers can use to apply bootstrap styles to your grid, like LESS. Creating a theme from one of yours and applying bootstrap themes to your classes seems the best way to fit a modern style to the grid.\nBest regards\nPablo Garc\u00eda\n. Nothing else apart of you need to move to the 'unpinned' layer to scroll up and down with the mousewheel. But I think this has been reported previously. \nAnyway, I'll be testing the grid for the next weeks, and I'll report you all I find. I'm very interested at using your grid. I am currently using jqGrid with angular.js and I need a powerful solution with a good performance, like yours. \nThanks for the good work. Regards\nPablo Garc\u00eda \n. I stilll see this issue. Is the test drive updated with the last fix?\nRegards\nPablo Garc\u00eda\n. Wow!, now it's working fine. Good job!\n. There might have been a regression? I am having this issue again :(\n. Ok, I've tested it with Mac and it works as expected, however in all browsers I've tested in windows it lets the scroll height unfilled for the pinned cols :(\n\nDoes this have solution?\nRegards\nPablo Garc\u00eda\n. Windows\n. It seems I was testing with an old version of firerfox (33). If you've tested with the latest one in windows and it's working, it's fine for me to close this issue\n. Wow, nice work.

In my opinion, it shouldn't be the grids responsibility to do this.  It would already be very simple to just expose the grid's current dataModel to a csv exporter function (or any other exporting function that can work with JSON for that matter). I say keep it lean, and we'll give examples to people on how to easily integrate with some exporters of sorts.

We're currently trying to decide where to put it, but it will probably be separate in the next release :)\n. This would be useful.  :+1: \n. With the latest build in master, styles are now separated to avoid conflicting interests.\nSo it will be as simple as referencing core.css, and then building your own theme overrides based on one of the given themes.

I'm just throwing out any optimizations that come to mind. \n. I'd love to do some style optimization.  My plan of attack would be this:\n1. I'll wait until we start using gulp to move it to a preprocessor.  The build process needs to change before we can go much further.\n2. Rewrite all of the src styles using Stylus, as it tends to be pretty agnostic and easy to convert to other preprocessors. Since Sass and Less are more commonly used (for now), we can easily convert the source stylus files to those types on build.  The markup for any preprocessor is going to be so similar, I don't think anyone will have a problem contributing, as there are so few differences between the preprocessors anyway.  Easy use of the files, customization compatibility and the ability to contribute easily should remain the focus.\n. Proposed fix #72\n. Fixed by #72\n. Absolutely.

Are there other reasons eg. performance, etc, that the cellRenderer function could not simply return a promise?\n. Yes. I can think of many cases where asynchronous operations may need to\nbuild charts, meta data, calculations etc. In my case I could use all\nthree. The assumption that the data being displayed on the grid all comes\nfrom the same data source be it local or remote and is ready to be\ndisplayed immediately is too strict. Angular is also built on promises, so\nnaturally there are going to be use cases where rendering using angular\nwill at some point have a requirement for this.\nOn Fri, Apr 17, 2015 at 2:15 PM Niall Crosby notifications@github.com\nwrote:\nHi Tanner,\nNo performance on the grid side. Just from a client point of view it\ndoesn't make sense to me. For example, if only one column requires this,\nthen showing n rows would result in n simultaneous network calls (assuming\nthe promise is to get the data remotely). Would of though such would be\nbetter handled in batch, then get the grid to refresh the whole view (which\nis practically instantaneous). Is your use case different?\nOn 17 Apr 2015 17:43, \"Tanner Linsley\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nAre there other reasons eg. performance, etc, that the cellRenderer\nfunction could not simply return a promise?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n<https://github.com/ceolter/angular-grid/issues/66#issuecomment-94024352\n.\n\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/angular-grid/issues/66#issuecomment-94065837.\n. Here, I simply check for a promise of some sort (whatever lib may be present), and apply the resolution.  If it's not a promise, go default.\n\n``` javascript\nRowRenderer.prototype.putDataIntoCell = function(colDef, value, node, $childScope, eGridCell, rowIndex) {\n        if (colDef.cellRenderer) {\n            var rendererParams = {\n                value: value,\n                data: node.data,\n                node: node,\n                colDef: colDef,\n                $scope: $childScope,\n                rowIndex: rowIndex,\n                gridOptions: this.gridOptionsWrapper.getGridOptions()\n            };\n            var resultFromRenderer = colDef.cellRenderer(rendererParams);\n        if (resultFromRenderer.then) {\n            resultFromRenderer.then(function(res) {\n                if (!res) {\n                    return;\n                }\n                checkType(res);\n            });\n        } else {\n            checkType(resultFromRenderer);\n        }\n\n    } else {\n        // if we insert undefined, then it displays as the string 'undefined', ugly!\n        if (value !== undefined && value !== null && value !== '') {\n            eGridCell.innerHTML = value;\n        }\n    }\n\n    function checkType(result) {\n        if (utils.isNode(result) || utils.isElement(result)) {\n            // a dom node or element was returned, so add child\n            eGridCell.appendChild(result);\n        } else {\n            // otherwise assume it was html, so just insert\n            eGridCell.innerHTML = result;\n        }\n    }\n};\n\n```\n. This obviously doesn't pause the grid cycle, so filtering and aggregating the resulting data doesn't work.\n. I'm almost done with the build refactor.  I'll PR it as soon as it's stable.\nAs for the valueGetter, I love the idea.  It could expose some variables to decorate or transform the data as its coming in or getting sorted.  Just make sure it supports promises if angular is being used.\n. As for the first question, no, it doesn't sort or filter.  In the specific scenario, I'm creating a \"fake\" column that uses data from other columns to make some new data.  It also uses promises.  So since there isn't really a \"value\" that the column is pulling from the row, and since the cell renderer is async, the value isn't really there to be sorted or aggregated on.  This is why I love the idea of a valueGetter ;)\n.

I agree. So will the value getter work with promises? Or will it user the same concept. Attacking it higher up the chain is better I think. \n. You'll see, there are a lot of big changes to the structure of the directory that conform to a more friendly open source pattern.  Directory names, package management, build process.\n\nThe website has been removed from the master build.  I suggest you create a separate fork called gh-pages for your website and online documentation.  Although you don't use github pages, this makes it obvious where the website is.\n. There is a very simple gulp build process that can easily be expanded upon for other stuff as well. \n. Fixes #66 \n. A for loop is performant over any callback style looper (which has to\nexecute a function for each loop, as opposed to just executing and\nincrementing the index).  Legibility is negligible in my opinion here.\nIt's easy to see that it's a loop.  The only differences are the\noptimizations in the parameters.  You can see the increment happens at the\ncondition stage, so you kill to birds with one stone.\n(i== 0) == (!i). Of course, it's not an absolute comparison, but if i ===\nundefined and not zero, you've got bigger problems here.\nTransforming via '3dtranslate' layers the boxes in the DOM seperately, so\nas to allow for faster repaints and GPU acceleration when\npossible.  It does smooth things up for me, but does not solve the problem\ncompletely (see below).\nThe scrolling performance is not due to the number of scroll events that\nbuild up.  It is simply the time of execution to update the dom\npiggybacking on the table functions for updating rows and what not.  A\nsimply fix that I employed was to separate the vertical and horizontal\nscroll events.  Vertical scrolling will need to update both the rows, and\npinned columns, but not the horizontal position of the header, which is the\nonly thing that happens on a horizontal scroll.  Once again, this improved\nperformance, but not enough to be exact.\nThe possible culprit of this problem could very well be the inertial\nscrolling that happens on OSX and iOS, but I have yet to find out if that's true.\nIMO, it won't matter much as to the order of when you merge.  It will either be you or me that is dealing with merge conflicts. I do think that it's\nmuch more cumbersome for someone with an open PR to refactor and rebase\ncommits than it is for someone to prep a PR and handle any small\nconflicts before it hits github.\nThere are tons of ways to this, but personally like to handle merge\nconflicts locally before they hit github, so this is what I would do:\n- Merge my PR with master.\n- Checkout and pull on master locally.\n- Fork master to a new branch \"A\"\n- Merge your custom branch into branch \"A\" (and handle the conflicts that\n  may arise)\n- PR to github master with branch \"A\" (which shouldn't have any merge\n  conflicts at that point)\n- After your PR gets merged into github master, checkout and pull on master\n  locally and you're all caught up.\nI hope that makes sense.  I'm no expert, so if there is an easier way,\nanyone else is more than welcome to chime in.\nAlso, I don't know what you use to resolve conflicts (or if you ever have\nhad to), but this sublime text plugin makes it dead simple:\nhttps://packagecontrol.io/packages/Git%20Conflict%20Resolver\nJust as \"return often\" applies to awesome code, my suggestion is\nalways: commit,\nsync and release often.  It will keep merge hell from happening.\nOn Sat, Apr 25, 2015 at 4:31 PM Niall Crosby notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nhi Tanner\nthe for loop like this: (var i = -1; ++i < columns.length;)\ngoes against what's in the code elsewhere ie: (var i = 0;\ni<columns.length; i++)\nsecond one i find more readable, easier to know what's going on (i prefer\nreadable code over funky code). any reason to have it the way you have?\nalso, i'd rather (i!==0) over (!i) as the former is more readable (it\nreads as it means, whereas the !i depends on how javascript casts ints to\nbooleans, hence doesn't read as well).\nlast question, using the transform instead of positioning, how much of a\ndifference is this making for you performance wise? does it solve the\nproblem completely, or just help a little?\nand i lie, one more question!! i have been working on a branch, and have\nalso done some refactoring in the scroll area. what is the process i should\nbe following? if i merge my branch in first, do i then ask you to create a\nnew pull request as the current one will have conflicts?\nthanks :)\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/angular-grid/pull/94#issuecomment-96288794.\n.

It seems we should be able to ditch the dataSource if we have the data on hand.\n. \n",
    "simonnicholls1": "@ceolter Was this ever fixed?\nIf I scroll on a tablet the table moves fine once I added the following css:\n.ag-body-viewport {\n  // Use momentum-based scrolling on WebKit-based touch devices.\n  -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n}\nhowever I get the slow header scrolling described here, it basically stops moving the header if I swipe on the table and remove my finger, the header then eventually catches up when the table body has stopped moving.\nAlso I've added the ability to touch a cell to select it in order to edit a value as, as far as I could see it was mouse click event only, but I believe the above is affecting this too so hopefully it will fix both :)\n.

    "buremba": "I can confirm this bug on Chrome and Safari on Mac. The header is quite sluggish compared to the grid. @ceolter I can capture a video of the browser when I'm browsing on https://www.ag-grid.com/example.php if you need. \n. +1\n. +1\n. Thanks!\n. +1\n. +1. I expected newRowsAction: 'keep'to store all the unique values for that column and show in filter menu but it turns out that we still need to provide values parameter in order to get the desired behaviour.\nThe client side problem seems to be fixed but the server-side filtering and sorting causes filter menu to show only selected items. When we unselect an item from the list, it's removed by ag-grid so that there's no way to select it again. See: https://jsfiddle.net/43x8mavj/ country column.\n. Sorry, it should be \"When I hover the filter button\". It would be nice if ag-grid displays the filter button ag-header-cell-menu-button when the filter menu is active. Currently filter button is displayed when I hover the header as you said but when the menu is active (as seen in the picture below) and the filter button is not displayed, the menu can be confusing because of its positioning. If the filter button uses the toggle mechanism, I think it would be much better from UX perspective.\n\n. Sure, I actually tried to use CSS in order to solve this problem but it seems that the DOM element for the menu is positioned as absolute and not related to the header cell of the column. Therefore it's required to add a class to the header cell when the menu is active or toggle the button visibility manually in javascript.\n. ",
    "daric81": "I'm seeing this when using the grid with angular in chome on high end windows 10 PC.   If I set suppressScrollLag :true then the horizontal scroll is fine, but vertical scroll is laggy with many rows. It would be nice to only suppress the scroll lag horizontally. \n. Its purely for performance, but as a side effect we can package our views up into one file. Its a fair standpoint you make regarding angular features. Alternatively allowing the override of the Template Service implementation might be nice.  We currently use ng-grid and its not performing too well for us so are trialling swapping it out.  \n. I was having a similar issue of centreRow being 40px during initial load. adding the following css corrected the issue for me. \ncenterRow {\nheight:100%;\n}\n. I was looking for something like this too where i can set the default values for grid options that will apply to every instance, ie suppressColumnVirtualisation = true. \n. Hi,\nThanks for the reply.\nHowever, I'm not really following regarding the virtual paging on the first point and believe there's still an issue or at least a change in behaviour that doesn't match the documentation.\nBefore populating my grid i get a count of the expected result set, say 1000.  I then set rowCount on my grid options to this value and then set up the datasource.  I've also tried api.setVirtualRowCount(1000) after setting up the datasource as you suggest. Say my page size is 200. \nAccording to the documentation and how agGrid used to work too,\n\"If the grid knows how many pages in total at the start, the scroll will be sized to match the entire data set despite the data set not loaded from the server.\"\nSo i don't know if the change in behaviour with the scroll was intended but whats mentioned in the docs doesn't happen. \nOn the second point, I've changed my code to call success rather than fail on an empty result set, however i still believe that adding rows to the grid when an error occurs is not ideal at all and is an undesirable change in behaviour.\n.

The circular dependency has been fixed, it would be available in the next release.. The fix is available in 8.1.1. Hi,\nJust to le you know that as of 10.1.0 this is available.\nPlease check the changelog\nThanks. Yup, this is now fixed in our source code, we had to do emergency releases that's why it hasn't come out yet, it will, (this time for real \ud83d\ude09) be available in the next release. Hi,\nThe bug reported here which was about filtering number columns when filter input was 0 was broken this should be fixed in 9.1.0.\nIs this what is not working for you? Or is it a different issue?\nThe 0 issue I have doubled checked and seems to be there.. It sounds to me like your underlying data is not numerical, it the column that you are telling to apply a numeric filter to it using strings behind the scenes?\nIf that is the case you could use a valueGetter to transform the values on the fly, or you could massage the data yourself before setting it into the grid so the column contents are numerical.\nThe filter 'number' only works with numerical data\n. Hi,\nJust to let you know that v10.0.0 has just been released and includes the fix that we discussed in this thread.\nThanks. Hi,\nJust to let you know that as of 11.0.0 this has been implemented, see the changelog for more details..\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/change-log/changeLogIndex.php#gsc.tab=0. Hi I am happy to announce that this feature it\u00b4s now available in our latest release 9.1.0. Hi,\nJust to let you know that this ticket has been released as part of v12. https://www.ag-grid.com/change-log/changeLogIndex.php\nThanks. Hi,\nThis is working as intended, that column has the flag selectAllOnMiniFilter set to true, which means that your select all/unselect all works only on the items visible on the set. If this flag was set to false (the default) then it would behave as you expect.\nYou can see the docs for the set filter here: https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-filter-set/\nThanks.

Hi I have tried this in our examples right now and seems to be working, can you please see if you can reproduce it there or send us a plunkr.\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-filter-set/\nThanks. Hi,\nSince 10.0.0 onBeforeSortChanged is not used anymore, you can listen to onFilterChanged and it should keep the same logic as it was using before.. Hi,\nI am confused, I think there a few things mixed up here you mention valueGetters, filterParams and cellRenderers but they are independent from each other, you are linking our setFilter docs.\nCan you be more specific or provide a reproducible plunkr\nThanks.. Hi,\nI can see now what you are talking about, you are right this is a bug we have created the ticket AG-497 to track this so you will receive as a parameter both the value after valueGetter if specified and the original value from your rowData.\nThis will be available from the next release, we will let you know once that is available. Hi upon revisiting this issue I should refine my previous answer.\nI don't think there is anything we can do about this, we have changed the docs so that this is clear:\nThe new docs for the setFilter will be changed to:\ncellRenderer: Similar to the cell renderer for the grid (you can use the same one in both locations).\n            Setting it separately here allows for the value to be rendered differently in the filter. Note that\n            the cellRenderer for the setFilter only receives the value as a parameter, as opposite to the cellRenderer\n            in the colDef that receives more information.\nWe use value getters to build the list of the set filters, and then we create a unique list, and then we delegate in the setFilterParams cellRenderer\nI am afraid we don't support this..\nI think we could help you if you would share what you are trying to achieve here..\nThanks\nUnfortunately I am going to close 497. Hi,\nI am afraid we are not going to consider this for development, since as you mention, the overlay can be handled anyway through the api, and our perspective is that semantically null and [] represent the same for the grid (no data).

Hi,\nI have just tested of our out of the box header examples, and they all seem to be working fine in IE\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-header-rendering\nCan you give them a go and see if they are also working for you?\nMy guess is that in your custom header component you have some custom HTML/CSS that is not compatible with IE.\nThis doesn't look like an ag-grid issue to me\n. It seems 2.4 is a RC?\nhttps://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/typescript/2017/06/12/announcing-typescript-2-4-rc/\nI can not understand what this error is trying to address, iCellRenderer has only an optional method, not sure how anyone implementing it can break the interface.\nIn my opinion this is a bug on their end, we are going to close this until 2.4 is not RC and then we will check again. Upon further reading of the release notes of 2.4 I can see this is intentional..\nWeak types:\nBack in TypeScript 1.6, we added a check for excess properties in object literals. This check looked for unexpected properties in object literals, and it happened to catch a large class of bugs. The only shortcoming of the check was that if you didn\u2019t immediately pass your object literal to something of the appropriate type, the check wouldn\u2019t be triggered.\nIn TypeScript 2.4, we\u2019re adding a similar check for what we call weak types. Any type that contains only optional properties is considered a weak type since it provides few restrictions on what can be assigned to it. For example, this Options type is a weak type:\nhttps://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/typescript/2017/06/12/announcing-typescript-2-4-rc/\nThey include a workaround...\nSince this is a breaking change, you may need to know about the workarounds which are the same as those for strict object literal checks:\nDeclare the properties if they really do exist.\nAdd an index signature to the weak type (i.e. [propName: string]: {}).\nUse a type assertion (i.e. opts as Options).\nSo your implementation since 2.4 is going to have to include the method that is optional (refresh) even if you are going to leave it empty (same as not implementing it pre 2.4)\nFor the record... I think this is crazy... \ud83d\ude1e . My 5cts... @guryanovev @RyanCavanaugh \nThe main point of discussion here is if you are not going to implement the only optional method in the interface, well then don't implement the interface.\nWell, that is flawed in my opinion. Interfaces like the ones we are discussing in this thread have always existed in frameworks exposed to users. If you are creating and consuming these interfaces internally, and not distributing your code as a library, then I understand this might be completely unnecessary and I would agree with not implementing them at all.\nBUT, we are a framework used by many other developers, and these interfaces have a very important function.\nFirst they act as marker interface, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marker_interface_pattern, they help to semantically increase the self documented aspect of the application, if I see a component implementing this interface I understand that is going to be used for a particular purpose. \nThey bind to your IDE helping developers search for components that implement this interface.\nThey tighten the contract between the user code and the framework (ag-grid in this case). If we ever change the interface definition in a future version and the user upgrades, he gets a compiler notification and can adapt the code accordingly.\nSo not implementing the interface is NOT an option and is bad advise in this case. We definitely want the customer to implement the interface for all the reasons above, so in this case we are deciding what we are going to do in this case, but I honestly think that this was not a good move.\n.

There are many ways to configure the cell styling of the grid as explained in the docs.. \nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-cell-styling\nWe are not going to change the way the grid positions elements absolutely, that would require a rework from the ground up and we don't think is necessary to be honest.\nIt is unfortunate that absolute positioning prevents you from changing some of the style on the fly, but the other side of the coin is that because we do absolute positioning, there are many other features that we can offer.\n.

Hi,\nI am afraid this will only work if you don't have an innerRenderer, if this works for you, it's fine, but in our case I am afraid that we need to cater for more edge scenarios so that's why we have decided not to implement the method and let the group always be created.\nWe take the feedback on board though and we will make a not to try to implement this method so that it works in all the edge cases since as you say will improve performance, but at this time I am afraid we are going to close this issue since we are not going to put any immediate effort into looking at this.\nThanks.

Hi,\nThis seems to be compiling fine in our end, can you check if you are not using mixed versions of ag-grid in your modules (ie all are 13.1.0)\nThanks. Hi,\nSorry about that, it was a regression that is already fixed in our latest branch and that we hope to release soon, hopefully this week\nThanks for raising this though!. Hi,\nFor security reasons moderm browsers have a cap on the maximum amount of memory they can allocate, this is so websites can not suck all of your computer memory just for the sake of it.\nThis also means that if you have a webapp that adds more data into the app as time goes by, the browser is going to crash.. Unfortunately there is no workaround here, but I am afraid this is not an ab-grid issue but a browser one.\nI am going to close this since I can't see how can we help you I am afraid. All I can suggest is that you dont incrementally load more data in your app... Could you change your logic so that after a while you start to unload data ?\nHope this helps.

The grid does not provide this, rather it is a simple rendering technique used in the examples. If the data is loading, then the rowNode will have no id. So if you use the id as the value, the cell will get refreshed when the id is set.\nloadingSpinnerColumn = {\n// use a value getter to have the node id as this columns value\nvalueGetter: 'node.id',\n\n// then a custom cellRenderer\ncellRenderer: function(params) {\n    if (params.value === undefined) {\n        // when no node id, display the spinner image\n        return '<img src=\"loading.gif\">'\n    } else {\n        // otherwise just display node id (or whatever you wish for this column)\n        return params.value;\n    }\n}\n\n}\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-infinite-scrolling/#loading-spinner\n. Hi, this has changed quite  a lot since v15.0\nI am going to close this, I would suggest you guys have a look at the new API and methods as I think this will cover these cases\nIf you think there are still pending issues to be fixed, please feel free to open a new ticket\nThanks.

One common issue that we receive is around typescript typings and how they can be improved, note that we are aware of this, and we periodically improve them as these are reported.\nTo track all these issues we use a parked feature request since we consider it to be a never-ending one.\nThis is particularly true for events. The events are bound as properties in ag-grid dynamically to the gridOptions, and that is why we don't have typings for them just yet.\nNote that we are planning to automate these, but we have no ETA for this yet..

Hi,\nFrom our knowledge base (only accessible to customers so far)\nThe infinite wor model scroll will show rows that haven't loaded yet. Value handler routines attached to these rows will be presented with null values while the rows load.\nOur documentation shows how to supply the user with a spinner whilst rows are being loaded:\nLoading Spinner\nThe examples on this page use a loading spinner to show if the row is waiting for its data to be loaded. The grid does not provide this, rather it is a simple rendering technique used in the examples. If the data is loading, then the rowNode will have no id. So if you use the id as the value, the cell will get refreshed when the id is set.\nloadingSpinnerColumn = {\n// use a value getter to have the node id as this columns value\nvalueGetter: 'node.id',\n\n// then a custom cellRenderer\ncellRenderer: function(params) {\n    if (params.value === undefined) {\n        // when no node id, display the spinner image\n        return '<img src=\"loading.gif\">'\n    } else {\n        // otherwise just display node id (or whatever you wish for this column)\n        return params.value;\n    }\n}\n\n}\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-infinite-scrolling/#loading-spinner\n.

If you work with dates in ag-grid, and you customize your date editor.\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-date-component/\nag-grid Out of the box date picker\nLet's start all by saying that if you use the out of the box ag-grid date editor, this will use your browser default date picker if you use chrome, otherwise, you can use gridOptions.browserDatePicker = true\nbrowserDatePicker: This is only taking into consideration if there isn\u2019t a date component provided. By default the grid will use the browser date picker in Chrome and a plain text box for all other browsers (this is because Chrome is the only browser providing a decent out of the box date picker). If this property is true, the browser date picker will be used regardless of the browser type.\nIf you do so, you will have a drop-down date picker provided from your browser, except if you use IE-11 (more on that later)\nIf you create your own date picker\nNote that if you decide to go for a CUSTOM editor, and you want to make it so that is a dropdown, (ie it shows in a popup), this won't be likely to work on the date filter menu, since when you click anywhere in the date popup, it will close it.\nThis is a known bug, and is tracked in the pipeline with:\nAG-1891 Filters - Add a mechanism for keeping the filter menu open\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/ag-grid-pipeline/\nIf you want to have a custom popup for a date cell editor you can still use a custom editor\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-cell-editing/#datepicker-cell-editing-example\nWe would recommend you this approach and then, for the date component (used in the column filter column) to let ag-grid use its out of the box one.\nBut I use IE11 and IE doesn't provide date pickers\nIn this case, we are afraid that for the column menu is going to be very difficult for you to integrate a popup date picker (unless you can stop the click propagation), and then we need to revert to the already mentioned bug AG-1891\nNote that we are hoping to have a solution for this soon\nFacebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+\n.

Hi,\nI am afraid that this is a browser issue, if you open your console and type this 1.11 + 1.25, you will see:\n1.11 + 1.25\n2.3600000000000003\nYou can however add a formater to that column to guarantee that you always round numbers\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-value-getters/\nThanks.

If you work with dates in ag-grid, and you customize your date editor.\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-date-component/\nag-grid Out of the box date picker\nLet's start all by saying that if you use the out of the box ag-grid date editor, this will use your browser default date picker if you use chrome, otherwise, you can use gridOptions.browserDatePicker = true\nbrowserDatePicker: This is only taking into consideration if there isn\u2019t a date component provided. By default the grid will use the browser date picker in Chrome and a plain text box for all other browsers (this is because Chrome is the only browser providing a decent out of the box date picker). If this property is true, the browser date picker will be used regardless of the browser type.\nIf you do so, you will have a drop-down date picker provided from your browser, except if you use IE-11 (more on that later)\nIf you create your own date picker\nNote that if you decide to go for a CUSTOM editor, and you want to make it so that is a dropdown, (ie it shows in a popup), this won't be likely to work on the date filter menu, since when you click anywhere in the date popup, it will close it.\nThis is a known bug, and is tracked in the pipeline with:\nAG-1891 Filters - Add a mechanism for keeping the filter menu open\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/ag-grid-pipeline/\nIf you want to have a custom popup for a date cell editor you can still use a custom editor\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-cell-editing/#datepicker-cell-editing-example\nWe would recommend you this approach and then, for the date component (used in the column filter column) to let ag-grid use its out of the box one.\nBut I use IE11 and IE doesn't provide date pickers\nIn this case, we are afraid that for the column menu is going to be very difficult for you to integrate a popup date picker (unless you can stop the click propagation), and then we need to revert to the already mentioned bug AG-1891\nNote that we are hoping to have a solution for this soon.

The method can be passed some parameters for configuring the options it will return.\nThe idea here is that you can store static configuration of the grid to be implemented in all options created by the factory, to avoid having to set those configurations every time you want a new grid.\nHowever, this doesn't leave you with a static grid, as you can still choose which parameters are customisable by passing them into the factory method. The two grids in this example will have the same columnDefs, but are being assigned different rowData and different boolean values for sorting/filtering enabled.\nhttps://plnkr.co/edit/PuhIvLcRVfJ4vBLS9c9C?p=preview\nThanks.

We were for a long while not processing issues in github as we only had the resources to do support for our customers\nFrom two weeks ago we have processed over 1year plus of tickets and we are adapting how we do this as we go.\nWe have added stale bot to help us process issues that are really support questions unattended, and based on this feedback we have extended the stale period to 25 days to flag as stale, then 5 more to close.\nNote that the moment you answer after is flagged as stale, the tage is also automatically removed. Also, just to offer some guidance in this issue, I think you want to have a look at in your init method to get a hold of the grid API, then you are going to have to capture these key presses yourself and call the relevant API methods to keep the navigation flow\nHope this helps\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-api/\n.

Hi,\nThis is working as designed, you need to capture the event yourself and take any actions as needed.\nag-grid staff does not provide support through github. If you are a customer please contact us through our official support channel. Note that this issue has been flagged as managed-by-the-community, we also recommend you to check stackoverflow, note that if there is no activity on this issue after a while we will close it.\nHowever I am pasting here for you the contents of an article that we have in our knowledge base (that at the moment is only accessible for customers), hope this helps\n\nOne common use case that we see our customers facing is, after this + how do I change the grid.\nFor instance, you could want to have it so that when the user clicks a row group node, a button is enabled, or when you click a cell the row is highlighted...\nAll these cases will require you first to listen to the best event to capture your starting point:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-events/\nOr callbacks\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-callbacks/\nOnce that you have your starting point defined, you are going to be able to call into our APIs \nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-api/ \nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-column-api/ \n... or call your custom logic\nThere is also going to be scenarios that based on an event, you want to update how the grid displays some cells/rows... \nIf that is the case, the best approach would be to include in your rowData, metadata that is used in the grid to describe this behavior.\nSo when you react to the appropriate event, then you can update the underlying metadata and the grid will based on that update any appropriate styles or cells\nThis technique can be combined with:\nValue Getters: You can have metadata that is read in a value getter in a column that is used only for display purposes, and for instance display an asterisk if the metadata indicates that the record, is a new record.\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-value-getters/\nCell Styles: In a similar fashion you can have a cell style to highlight a row for instance and activate it with metadata that you update based on events.\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-cell-styles/\nCheck the following examples to see how this can be applied to real-world examples.\nhttps://ag-grid.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/360002448071-Events-API\n. This used to be an issue, but it got fixed, can't remember quite exactly when.. If you check our demo you will see how this works as expected.\nIf you update your grid it should be fixed.\nPlease if you see this issue after updating to the latest grid version, open a new ticket\nThanks.

If you do struggle to find the path for a class, you are more than welcomed to raise this through support and we will help you find the correct path.\nTo see all the classes that can be imported by just referencing \"ag-grid-community\" check this file\nhttps://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid/blob/master/packages/ag-grid-community/src/ts/main.ts\nThanks\n.

Hi guys,\nLet me share with you an article that we have in the knowledge base for enterprise customers\nUpdating SSRM nodes locally\nThe following example demonstrates CRUD operations by looping over loaded row nodes, using api.forEachNode(), and updating the data using: rowNode.setData(data)\n'Update Selected Rows\u2019 - here we just locate the selected row nodes and update the data on them directly.\n'Delete Selected Rows\u2019 - deletion is achieved by iteratively swapping the data into the previously found row to delete. Note that this will leave blank rows when the number of rows is less than the block size.\n'Add Row After Selected\u2019 - this follows a similar approach to deletion were we are swapping data between into existing row nodes to achieve the appearance of addition. \nIt\u2019s important to note that setting row data will NOT change the row node ID - so if using getRowNodeId() and the data changes such that the ID will be different, the rowNode will not have it's ID updated!\nThe example also include some mock server endpoints to update / delete / add data on the server once the grid has been updated.\nYou can observe the results by invoking 'Purge Caches'\nNote that the group viewport won't resize until the user purges the cache, so this example has limitations but show a possible way to accomplish this\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/3qqkQQ6dtqBxcB4MgQMj?p=preview\nNote also that if you are customers, you might want to contact us through support, we will be happy to assist you with any issues that you have\nHope this helps.

Hi\nJust to let you know that ag-grid staff is now going to monitor this thread to help find an answer to this issue (hence the ag-grid engaged label)\nThanks for all the feedback. Hi guys,\nThis is to do with a change with delta columns introduced in 19.1\nFrom v19.1.0 delta columns are available, this means that now you can change the column definitions dynamically without causing the grid to reset.\nNote that this feature is still being polished and we are thinking about possibly changing the way it works, but for the time being the key points are:\n1- If you want to update some existing columns, DON'T do it through setColumnDefs. Instead get a reference to that column, change it any way you want and then call refreshHeader\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-column-definitions/#changing-column-headers\n2.- If you want to add or remove columns, then you need to call setColumnDefs, note that changes to already existing columns passed here are not going to be picked up, but new or removed columns will be deleted from the grid\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-column-definitions/#column-changes\nAs mentioned above, we are considering consolidating the setColumnDefs as the golden source of truth, the investigation that we are carrying for this is tracked with this issue:\nAG-2289\nDelta Columns - Investigate if it we should consider setColumnDefs as the golden source for delta columns.. By 20.x (ETA before end of year) we should have a clear strategy to set delta columns..

Hi,\nUpon further investigation, we have realised this is not a bug... Note this:\nWhen the SSRM invokes getRows() it's in a 'loading' state. While in this this state the grid introduces a temporary row node which shows 'loading'.\nWhen params.successCallback([], 0) is invoked this node is removed.\nSo it's during this intermediate state that the cellClass callback is invoked on the temporary row node. If this is an issue add some defensive programming like so:\ncellClass : function(params) {\n return params.data ? params.data.value : '';\n}\nhttps://plnkr.co/edit/tcN5K9Oyty35ZUJpyzT5?p=preview\nHope this helps.

    "ghost": "Hi, ceolter ! I have checked your \u201cAngular Grid\u201d\uff0c It is greate! but the example does not have \"Client side Pagination\"??   which I think is  the basic functions of a grid.  I hope that I can found this function soon.   Now I'm trying it...\n. +9001\n(:D)\n. Just wanted to mention that ag-grid was very interesting to us, but missing feature was a deal breaker for our company adopting ag-grid\n. +1\n. I must say that I'm having the exact problem that has been described by ocombe.  I have to apply a 1/2 second $timeout on the OnReady api.sizeColumnToFit() function in order to render properly.  Otherwise, the columns are rendered too wide and produce a horizontal scrollbar.  Interestingly, without the sizeColumnsToFit call, the columns naturally size to something smaller than the grid width and leave a whitespace to the right.\nJust fyi...\n. I am going to try to solve this issue, because this is a blocker for me. Can you give me a kick start? Do you have any ideas where the bug is likely to happen?\n. I think I found the bug. In grid.ts you have setupComponents. The rowModel is set to use the rowModel of inMemoryRowController by default. I think it is missing the setup for gridPanel, rowRenderer, filterManager, and selectionController with virtualPageRowController's rowModel when we are using virtual pagination (grid.doingPagination is true) in the datasource. The grid is reading virtualRowCount off inMemoryRowController, while datasource is storing data into virtualPageRowController. \n. Hm.  The problem was called when the template reference:\n...div ag-grid=\"vm.gridoptions\"  class=\"ag-blue\" style=\"height: 100%;\"></div...\ndid not match the name in the controller: \nthis.gridOptions = gridOptions;\nBut I've made changes in the controller code subsequent to resolving the problem and now I can't seem to regenerate that error.  So, please close this issue and I'll let you know if the problem recurs.\nThanks.\n. Hey, thanks a lot. Ill have a closer look on Monday. Have a nice weekend.\n. @carloshpds Thanks a lot for your example!\nI used it as a base for adding d&d support for ag-grid as treeview component.\nIt stil has a couple of bugs but here is the version I came up with: https://plnkr.co/HfPXsl\n. Thanks! \n. Thanks for the tip, it should work.\nBut with the scope it isn't true - there is separate scope for cells - look e.g. here: https://ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-cell-template/index.php - all the cells have the standard .ngScope\n. Hmm, it seems you are right.\nTracked down here: https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/blob/d6b340ceb2cda946a4beb930b7c2a90b90889f54/src/ts/rendering/renderedRow.ts#L534\nSo clearly a documentation bug :)\n. ok, thank you. \n. found the solution \nonModelUpdated: () => { this.filteredRowsCount = this.gridOptions.api.getModel().getRowCount(); },\n. found the solution \nonModelUpdated: () => { this.filteredRowsCount = this.gridOptions.api.getModel().getRowCount(); },\n. yes I was not using Virtual pagination. Thanks for the reply :)\n. any update on this? not working for me either.\n. Looks like when mounting AgGridReact, the gridOptions that are passed in don't contain fullWidthCellRendererFramework. I looked in componentUtil.js and saw that none of the CellRendererFramework options are listed under FUNCTION_PROPERTIES. When I add, the cells render correctly.\n. Thanks Guys,,, \nI got this working now, problem was not with the key, I have to upgrade my Angular from 2.0.0 to 2.2.4\nOne suggestion -> In this case ag-grid should not say License Key invalid, this might be misguiding as what happened to me. My license key was perfect only thing is I had to upgrade Ng. Please correct the error message if possible. :)\nCheers. ",

Any ETA on when you'll be looking into adding this?\n. While you are working on this, keep in mind that this should work when a user is only using check box selection as well as on row click. The above solution doesn't work with a setup that has row click selection disabled. (or it overrides the suppression of the row click selection, and considering the onRowClick event does not fire when a row is selected through a check box, this can be a bit of a pain.)\n. Should add that this is only an issue with Pinned columns. It spans only the pinned columns and not every column. Not sure how this will get fixed the way pinning is being handled currently, but something to keep in mind if this is getting changed at some point.\n. On the event side of things: fair enough, I will look into a system that will allow me to register/unregister for the particular use case (when first loading, or reloading selections, I do not want to detect change events, once I have reloaded the selections, I would want to reload the events),\nOn the second point: I really need to check the forums more frequently :P Sorry about the noise.\n. As an fyi, this happens with a hard refresh as well.\n. I realized you've been busy dealing with other issues, wondering if you've looked at this and/or the pull request (https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/pull/906). I realize this may not be a major issue for other users (not sure if many are opening windows that cause data changes on the main grid) but it would be nice to know if I need to look at a more permanent solution (one external to the grid) such as overriding internal calls so I can avoid this issue and any possible future conflicts when upgrading). I'd like to move to a version of the grid with shift-click for multi selection of items, but not sure if I will need to replicate my changes every time I do this or if I should find a way to replicate the changes such that an upgrade won't simply strip my changes out of the code. Thanks for the amazing grid!\n. One last statement, My pull request allows the user to stop the cell focus from happening. A better way is to actually test in the code that the browser is in focus which your code currently does not do.\ncurrently the code that gets the focused cell, \"getFocusCellIfBrowserFocused\" does not actually check if the browser is focused. This may work in chrome alright, but it does not work well in IE 11 where an explicit check that the browser is in focus should be done. Thanks!\n. I'll recheck, but I did attach an example that shows that the grid fails to take browser focus into consideration as of version 4.2.6. I have a pull request that (eventually :P ) added a line to the start of that class to check if the browser is even in focus before doing anything that fixes this issue. Thanks for looking into this and keep up the good work!\n. Also should mention that this issue is only a problem in IE 11 as far as I know. I have tested this in Chrome and Firefox and everything works as expected. The test app that is attached shows the issue.\n. Fixed my pull request, guess I should compile the typescript to ensure no errors :P\n. That's fine, the PR was modified too many times. It may have been updated with a newer version of the grid as I kept checking the issues. Thanks for the add though!\n. Should have deep dived a bit more, found the currently undocumented (as far as I can tell) Drag Stopped event :) Sorry for the noise!\n. Yeah, with the dragging events, there is no need for the on moving. Thanks for looking into it though!\n. Thanks for the fix!\n. Yup, that is getting fixed in the next release: #981 \n. IE 11 has never supported web components, in order to use web components in IE 11 requires a polyfill: http://webcomponents.org/polyfills/\n. Are you talking about the columns' state? If so there are functions on the column api for getting, setting, and resetting the column state, you just need to save off the state and reapply on grid ready. Check the documentation: https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-column-api/index.php\nThere are also functions for saving the sort order models and filter models, they are in the main grid api: https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-api/index.php\nThere is also a function for setting column defs if you really want to be altering the definitions themselves (though you really shouldn't need this unless the defs are changing and not just their state)\n. The set and get column state in the column api will do exactly what you are asking. I should know, I do it in my app :)\n. I can also confirm this bug, it appears to be an issue just for the menu, sorts and filter. The rest seem to be working as expected. I could not find where ag-icon-menu, ag-icon-filter, ag-icon-asc, or ag-icon-desc are being used in the actual grid source.. As an FYI, if I change the data in the grid, the filter options are not being respected either.. A further dive into this bug (at least as far as I am seeing in our situation, but it might help determine what the underlying issue is), when the filter initializes, the filterParams are applied correctly. When a change is made to the grid, these are ignored on subsequent requests. So in our situation, if I haven't opened a filter on a column yet, then changing the grid data does not affect the way the parameters are applied. Only after initialization is this an issue.. this is a possible fix for https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid/issues/1894 in case it wasn't clear :P. Just checked with ag-theme-dark, this still happens there, but does not happen with theme-dark.. Just checked to see if this is still an issue. it is still an issue in 18.0.1. Just checked my plunkr, it's still broken for ag-theme-fresh and ag-theme-dark (balham works but that isn't the theme I am using). https://plnkr.co/edit/w4LOxXahQ0nnnTG312We?p=preview. ",

Cool, thx!\n. @ceolter et al\nThis feature is the exact thing I have to implement today.\nFurther, I need to add a feature whereby users can use the native Ctrl-F (in Chrome) to find text on the page.  The issue I have is if the result is offscreen, the user cant see it?  Is there a way to scroll grid to display result in current view port?\n. +1 Yes Please :-)\n. @ceolter Awesome, that is what I wanted to know., \n. Found this in documentation in case you are wondering\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-row-height/index.php\n. @ceolter My apologies, I phrased my questions all wrong (I was actually referring to the row grouping text).  But, I have figured it out so all is good :-)\n. @ceolter Awesome, thank you very much.  Sorry for so many questions... There is so much to this awesome component, sometimes hard to find the answers.  The documentation is a good first step, but often dont find what I need ;-(\nMore examples would be awesome!\n. @ceolter Do, threw me a look for a moment (reference to localhost above)\nI found it at :-)\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-callbacks/index.php\n. @ceolter Is this correct usage with React version?  I cant think of another way to pass along (inject) the gridOptions?\n. @ceolter Well, now I have to figure out what is going on?   It is a super duper crashing thing for me.  After the myriad of console errors, it eventually makes the current browser window to die\nI will let you know what I come up with :-(\n. Found it in docs :-)\n. @ceolter  Note:  On this page, the description for getMainMenuItems is incorrect (has same description from above)\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-callbacks/index.php\n. @ceolter One thing I cant find in documentation is how to remove the last button (info from ToolPanel)\n\n. @ceolter Yet again, much appreciated for your quick response.  I am on a tight deadline (as usual) and your promptness is greatly greatly appreciated.\n. @ceolter Awesome, thx!\n. @ceolter wow, i was reading this ticket and it refreshed before my very eyes as you merged.  Never seen that before.   \nSo my question is,,, when will this be available.  I have created my own theme (along lines of Bootstrap) but would love to try material theme.\n. @ceolter Sure!  I will send it over this evening when I get home\n. @ceolter Awesome sauce, thx\n. +1\nI have implemented this functionality myself, but it would be nice to have getConfigInfo() and setConfigInfo() out of the box.  Surely missing something with my custom implementation.\n. +1\n. ",

Similar issue: https://github.com/ceolter/angular-grid/issues/352\n. Resolves issue #380\nPlease let me know if you're willing to merge it in.\n. @ceolter I've applied your feedback. Do you think it's OK to merge in now?\n. Infinite scrolling + Datasource + Mac trackpad scrolling\nThe fix is definitely not setting overflow auto on that specific element\n. @ceolter My pull request for #398 fixes this bug! Thanks for your time in reviewing.\n. @ceolter Thanks! It will help me a lot if you can merge it in and do a release soon! :+1: \nI've been using it locally with almost no issues. I made another small commit to handle the one issue I found.\n. @ceolter OK, but I think the behavior is bugged with a Datasource + Infinite scrolling. I think it keeps the row selected even if it isn't the same row.\nI can have custom code de-select the row, but it seems like it should be de-selected automatically when a datasource is used.\nI am using datasource+ infinite scrolling with millions of rows.\n. I don't actually think this will be that hard to implement with the current way you have it setup. It's a very simple change. Here is how I have it working (with jQuery, but I can port it). Would you like me to submit a PR? Is this something you would merge?\nBasically, you are syncing the scroll using CSS \"top\" right now. I think it's possible to 2-way sync using the scrollTop attribute. This is something that other grids (like SlickGrid) cannot do with their pinned columns.\nI'm going to submit a PR. This is a very important feature for my users. Thank you for your time reviewing it!\n. @ceolter Let me know what you think. A better way of doing this might be to remove both viewports and scroll them together, while having only a horizontal viewport for the body columns. It'd be a smoother scrolling experience... That would require a major refactor of a lot of pieces though.\n. @ceolter OK, makes sense. The way I've implemented this is not very different from what you did.\nThe mouse wheel not scrolling pinned columns is not a minor quirk for my use-case. With the existing grid I'm replacing, SlickGrid, which has similar behavior (mouse wheel doesn't scroll because pinned columns were an afterthought in that grid), not being able to scroll on the pinned columns are the number ONE user complaint.\nI'll do another pass on this today to see if I can identify any quirks and test in a few more browsers. I was thinking it might be safer to assign the height of the elements manually so I could subtract the 25 pixels for the header from them.\nIf I can get this feature into a stable place, would you consider merging it in?\n. @ceolter There is a small bug with my PR - when you scroll all the way to the bottom, the container that contains both pinned and body columns scrolls and the header disappears. To fix it, I think the height of the inner containers needs to be set manually (not to 100%) but I'm not sure of the proper place to do it in the code.\nInstead of having you review this code, I think a better PR would be to implement the following. I'm willing to do it, if you approve the design. Can you take a look?:\n\nIf you don't want to implement this design, I'll work on fixing the bug with the existing PR, which is much less of a change to the existing structure.\n. Perfect. You can close.\n. My experience on mac is that the scroll will fail to be elastic (as in it won't keep scrolling naturally) and if I try to scroll rapidly the window scrolls before I can even get close to the bottom of the grid. This happens on the main page of the demo site.\n. If I mouse over the grid on the angulargrid.com site main page, and use my Mac trackpad to scroll down rapidly, it immediately scrolls the entire window down. I'm unable to quickly scroll the grid.\n. I don't think you're going to get natural scrolling that looks and behaves naturally in all environments unless you implement a solution that allows the grid to scroll naturally without manipulating CSS.\nI think the DOM will need to look something like this:\n\n. +1 I've run into the same issue.\n. I agree that angular does not belong as a dependency in bower.json for this project.\n. I think you're including ag-grid twice. You're using a wildcard in bower_components, if ag-grid.min.js exists in two places it'll be included twice. The error also heavily implies it's being included twice.\n. @TFrascaroli Incredibly useful. I'm going to try and implement it using that as a base. Thank you!\n. Essentially, I want row grouping with a remote data source. Obviously the grid can't do the grouping for me because it won't have all the data due to infinite scrolling. Here is my need:\n- Enable mode so all rows passed from remote datasource are considered top-level \"groups\"\n- When a group is expanded, make a second call to remote datasource to fetch rows in group and render them\nI actually have a working implementation of this, but it's a bit hacky right now. I'd prefer to have it supported in the grid.\nWould you accept a PR?\n. +1\n. In my use-case, I have a selection model separate from the grid. I'm using a remote datasource and when \"select all\" is clicked, I may need rows selected that aren't known yet.\nI don't think individually selecting rows is a good way to approach the \"select all\" use-case because not every grid is going to have all data loaded in.\n. +1\n. +1\n. You can use the APIs directly and create your own tool panel. I don't think you can currently customize the existing one.\n. You need to use triple equal sign with undefined or you have the same exact bug.\n. ",

    "lucaalex87": "Guys, you have custom header renderer, you can implement drag&drop there, and call gridOptions.columnApi.moveColumn(fromIndex, toIndex) on ondragover. \nI'm working on something like this just now. But it's with angularCompileHeaders: true also. \nhttp://www.ag-grid.com/angular-grid-header-rendering/index.php\n. Here you go, a simple example: \nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/S9Qjno?p=preview\n. It seems that in IE9, TemplateService.templateCache update is not visible to all code using it.\nThe infinite loop is:\ngetTemplate, (wait in line until the call ends), call ends, template added to cache, run callback, callback doesn't see the template in templateCache, creates another callback, adds it to the queue, and so on.\n. I eventually found the issue. In IE9, the template is on responseText inside the response object. \nIn IE10+ and all other browsers it's on response.\nSo in order to fix it, in the above code, instead of:\n// response success, so process it\n this.templateCache[url] = httpResult.response;\nI added:\n// response success, so process it\n //in IE9 the response is in - responseText\n this.templateCache[url] = httpResult.response || httpResult.responseText;\nFor future reference, adding the answer here.

Indeed, It does work when setting columnDefs directly.\nBut not when using $scope.gridOptions.api.setColumnDefs(columnDefs) after a while\nReproduced here : http://plnkr.co/edit/b94R0e4lRSV5FQ5bmCi8\nI use $scope.gridOptions.api.setSortModel as a workaround for now, but for some reason I need to use columnDefs that way without worrying about setSortModel (if possible :))\n. After re-thinking about this, in doesn't make sense to ask ag-grid to properly sort after the datasource is set.\nBecause getRows is directly done even if there isn't any column defs.\nThe fix is to either be sure that we have a column defs before setting the datasource, or check in the getRows function if column defs are sets before anything.\nMaybe a warning could be usefull if we are trying to getRow without column defs, what do you think ?\n. But when doing a getRow without columns defs the grid doesn't know what to display.\nIn which cases calling getRow without any column defs is valid ?\n\ncan you change your code, so that if the column defs are not present, you don't do the fetch?\n\nYes, that's how I fixed it, thanks anyway :)\n. +1\nI also need to click on the icon (or the whole column header, why not); sometimes my columns doesn't have labels.\n. Thanks ! :)\n. If the state is stored somewhere and the initial column def is updated (e.g code update), it would be usefull to detect that the new col def and the user stored state doesn't match and then override the old state.\nAs a matter of fact, storing a column defs version can also solve this problem too. But it would require to update the column version each time column defs are changed which is not ideal.\n. Yes, that's what I've done. But this logic is already done in setColumnState (which cause a console.warn). I think it's better to have this test in ag-grid only instead of doing it 2 times in a row.\n. Cool thanks ! :)\n.

Its generating on the fly. \npreviously i tested with 1M fixed rows and 10k columns, javascript and chrome can handle, but 200M memory for 1M objects (rows data), GC sometimes make UI lag. so, I generate both rows data and colDefs on the fly now.\nIts done in this js file btw - http://rawgit.com/S-YOU/doTA/master/examples/virtual-scroll/scripts.js\n. I normally use chrome \"Take Heap Snapshot\" to check memory usage\n\nFor instance, if I generate fixed 1M array, 1M objects count and memory usage is around 80M.\n\nBrowser are very sensitive on creating small objects, GCing those are expensive process.\nSo, if you have a lot of object, keep an eye on object count and size on Heap Snapshots.\n. :thumbsup:\n. and why wiredep should inject angular too? if you want it you should have angular in YOUR bower.json file. also wiredep only inject files specified in \uff9emain\uff9eproperty of bower json object.\n. @joekrill , I see, fair enough.

The story of angular-grid really resonated with me - my team and I have been using jqWidgets jqxGrid, but due to poor premium support and many required workarounds due to their not playing well in the angular lifecycle, we made the switch to Angular ui-grid.  We started switching over to it, but the one thing that killed it was when someone noticed that accessibility/508c compliance was not available, and their github issue on the topic said they had no immediate plans for it.  So back to jqxGrid we went.  Your project is great, and I would love if I could show the corporate overlords that the Accessibility checkbox can be checked...   I think the main compliance areas we are looking at are the the aria-role attributes added to the grid tags, and keyboard support for navigating the grid and activating filter dialog, etc.  I know Accessibility is not the sexiest feature to work on, but once the grid basics are implemented if you get a chance to throw some love to enabling accessibility I'd buy you a beer ;)\n.

    "hohwille": "To be honest: The web is pain. To really address accessibility you do not only need some ARIA attributes. You need keyboard control. However HTML, CSS and JS is the poorest technology on earth for fundamental things. So you need to handle keyboard events for cursor key strokes and handle the focus inside the grid yourself. That is a hole lot of work. It would be great if the projects providing grids could merge their energy to finally provide something addressing all requirements and demands for end-users. Maybe you can at least get inspiration and code hints from other grid projects to get this done. After all one would expect the W3C to specify a grid including JS API and make the browser vendors provide an accessible and device optimized view for it. This is such a fundamental requirement that was already solved 15 years ago in every native UI framework such as Swing, etc.\nNow we have year 2015 and the web is still stoneage while you can do cool 3D graphics in the browser easily.

AFAIK, bower is pulling the files from the git repository, so as long as each release is tagged correctly, people will still be able to install older versions by specifying the version they want when installing via the bower command line.\n. I think you'll find that ng-grid is registered as angular-ui-grid, rather than angular-grid.\nI have both installed in a single project for evaluation and bower had no problem installing them side by side.\n. I've been thinking the same about implementing this for the CSS.\nFirstly, it's not that the styles are particularly complicated, but providing/maintaining predefined themes will definitely be simplified with the use of a preprocessor since each would just become a set of variables setting the required colours, etc, rather than needing to duplicate each of the related rules.  This, in turn, means that the rules are only defined once, so updating them doesn't need each theme to be changed separately.\nMore significantly though, I think it would make it much easier for developers to integrate the grid into a project that uses SASS/LESS.  Currently, you must manually copy and edit the grid styles to match your project (a process that then has to be repeated whenever the grid's styles are changed).  With SASS/LESS, you don't care about the rules themselves - as long as all the significant values have been declared as variables, you will only need to update the variables to match.  Upgrading to a new version then just needs you to check what variables have been added/removed.\nOf course, whichever one you go with, someone will want you to implement the other one.  But I think implementing both is overkill.  Personally, I've used both SASS and LESS, but prefer SASS, so will probably have a go at converting it anyway (though I'm no expert).  I'll be happy to provide a PR as a first attempt, if you're interested.\n. I can appreciate your concerns about complexity.  I assumed you hadn't used SASS/LESS because you didn't want to introduce additional third-party dependencies, but I can understand the other implications for some people.  That said, using a pre-processor is almost a tacit best practice (and so many OS frameworks/components use one or the other anyway), so maybe it's no bad thing.  And you can still distribute the CSS files too.\nRegarding style reuse, I was referring more generally, though I'm ambivalent about the split between 'core' and 'theme' styles; it's useful when you have to work with the CSS directly, so could be maintained, but is less relevant and more complex when working in SASS.\nI think the way the themes are currently implemented should change anyway.  I'm not a fan of the practice of adding the theme name to a parent element of the grid since, for most projects, you'll only ever be using a single fixed theme.  The only advantages I can see it giving is making it easy to try out different themes by simply changing the parent's class (which you can do just as easily by changing the stylesheet name) or where you have multiple grids on a single page that need different styling.  OTOH, the disadvantage is that you increase the browser's processing of the CSS since every element's style requires a traversal up the DOM to see if a parent has the .ag-fresh (or whatever) class.\nAnyway, I'm fine with letting @tannerlinsley take the lead if he's up for it (always happy to let someone else do work!)\n. +1 for gulp\nAs for contributions, presumably a pull request from the contributor's fork is the obvious way?\n.

    "pauljoey": "Simple fix:\ncss\n.ag-body-viewport {\n  -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n}\nThis should probably be added to the code base. It will provide native inertial scrolling on \"most\" browsers without unwanted side-effects. JS-emulation inertial scrolling is almost impossible to get right and is prone to side-effects and I would thus recommend against it.\n. I'm a big fan of the CSS implementation in angular-grid. The classes are clean, well-structured and named consistently. The separate themes/styling mean that styles are fully-decoupled. Adding a bootstrap-like theme with the existing class structure is very straightforward and I would recommend this over trying to introduce/integrate bootstrap classes into the angular-grid code base. \n. Changed topic from \"Option to allow de-selection of rows\" to \"Selection API improvements\"\n1. Add: keepLastSelected option that would allow de-selection of the selected row in \"single\" selection mode when the selected row is clicked.\n2. Add: api.getSelectionIndices() to get indices of current selections. This would allow api.selectIndex() to be used externally to implement a previous/next functionality.\n3. Add: api.selectRow(input) to select a row based on row.data === input, or alternatively input(row) === true if input is a function\n. Thanks for the quick turn around. We have two behaviours that we need that I am trying to implement at the application level (keeping in mind that we use infinite scrolling). This is the main impetus for the feature request, though I can easily foresee a broad range of use cases that would need to read and modify selections externally. For us, presently, we need to:\n- Select previous/next row\n- Change the selection externally and update the row selection accordingly\nGiven that node is mainly an internal data representation specific to angular-grid it may ultimately be preferable (in an ideal world located in a vacuum) to construct the \"final\" API (down the road) in such a way that it avoids its use. Having said that, I understand that it may not be possible to provide a sufficient degree of control to demanding power users with one-off use-cases such as myself :) Thus the simplest and most effective approach to covering the broadest possible use-cases may very well be to simply expose the internal functions.  \nSo far I'm really pleased with angular-grid. A solid API will make the project extendable and help keep  the core simple and focused. Keep up the good work.\nHad a look at the recent patch, had a few thoughts: \ngetSelectedNodes() appears to be missing a return statement :)\nselectedNodesById seems to retain extra keys after de-selection by setting the values to this.selectedNodesById[node.id] = undefined instead of calling delete this.selectedNodesById[node.id] in  deselectRealNode(). Can this be changed or do other parts of the code rely on this behaviour? \n. We handle sorting and filtering on the server side by constructing a custom URL that is referenced by the datasource that we construct and manipulate outside of angular-grid. The only issue that we ran into was in clearing the data when the criteria changes - for this we discovered that calling options.api.setDatasource()(even with the same data source) has the desired effect.\n. Right at the top of the \"events\" page - https://ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-events/index.php\nThe rowDeselected event has been removed while the description for the rowSelected event suggests that it only fires when a row is selected.\nRather than changing the behaviour of the rowSelected event it might have been preferable to remove it (with a warning) then have users migrate to the (more appropriately-named) selectionChanged event.\n. Ah, I understand. In that case rowSelectionChanged would be a suitable name :). I wouldn't necessarily suggest changing the event at this point - moving forward I would just like to make the comment that I find such strategies (removing + adding as an alternative to changing) preferable for evolving the API. \nReally happy with ag-grid, it's proving to be an excellent part of our application toolbox. Many thanks.\n. I am having a similar issue whereby sorting markers (up/down arrows) are not injected/shown if I specify a options.getHeaderCellTemplate function (even if it returns an exact copy of the default template).\n. In my case, it is applicable to all column headers regardless of their grouping status.\n. Upon further investigation, the issue that I'm experiencing is that #agSortDesc inside of the template returned by getHeaderCellTemplate() is not being populated with the sort icon SVG. On reflection, that's probably the intended and preferable behaviour - that I embed the icon SVG into the template returned by getHeaderCellTemplate() directly.\nRather than use the embedded SVG, I simply added the following style and now I'm good to go.\n``` css\n  .ag-sort-descending-icon::after {\n    content: '\u25bc';\n  }\n.ag-sort-ascending-icon::after {\n    content: '\u25b2';\n  }\n```\n. ag-grid is so hot right now..

Solved using specific column parameters and not copying all.\n. @waheedahmed55 As ceolter said, you can just use getState on every state change, and to save it to localstorage or whatever, then on first entry do setState\nI can't share my code with you as I don't have it anymore, but my code was actually taking the entire state of the columns and grid, reducing it to what I need, then saving it to JSON (Even the functions). I don't have the code, as it belongs to a company now, I can just tell you what I did.\nAfter you get the column state, map it to a smaller version of it, keeping most of the essentials (essentials=keys you defined, not stuff that was added automatically).\nThen, you can stringify that object as JSON, following: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36517173/how-to-store-a-javascript-function-in-json\nand save it to local storage.\nWhen the user refreshes the page, get that stored state, and set columns state.\n. Local storage is a key-value dictionary where both the key and the value are strings.\nYou can't store something that is not a string, and definitely not functions.\n. json parsing whem u get the item. You can use the default search option of the grid. When someone presses Ctrl+f, just focus on the filter input.\nHow did you implement the highlight? Angular or plain JS?\n\nOn Apr 28, 2016, at 17:59, Niall Crosby notifications@github.com wrote:\nThe issue I have is if the result is offscreen, the user cant see it? Is there a way to scroll grid to display result in current view port?\n-> not possible, as the grid doesn't render everything into the dom. so when your searching what's rendered (ctrl+f) it isn't actually searching the entire dataset.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n. @mikeerickson I would too really like to know. If it is just JS, can you please share your code?\n\n@ceolter BTW, it can also be done with a cellrenderer function, but same issue - copy will not work in its normal way. There is an (awful) workaround.\n. @ceolter I think this should be resolved inside the grid, in a pure JS manner, in the cell evaluation functions (didn't look at the source code, but I guess there are functions to evaluate cells)\n. @seanlandsman Can you please add this to the pipeline?. @DominicTobias I just got an email notification for your comment, and was like: \"DID THEY FINALLY DO IT????\", but unfortunately, opened the mail to disappointment.. Thanks, @JabbyPanda ! Are you sure this won't affect the copying mechanism?\nAnyway, I heard from good authority that this feature is coming SOON!. @ceolter I don't wanna be a jerk, but is there a time-frame? I use a custom copy function for now that... does not work 100%\n. I was sure a trial license exists, and I see it still does.\nAnyway, just now moving to approval on buying the enterprise version. What is \"customer number\"? That is not clear at all..\n. Closed for being an enterprise feature. Reopened https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid-enterprise/issues/30\n. Yeah I don't know how to name stuff.. thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. +1\n. I am not sure of the context of the code, so it may already be done.\nIf possible, only do this for 'field' columns. Columns that use cellRenderer may return buttons, or icons. (Example is fontawesome icons)\nDon't know what about valueGetter...\n. Thanks!\nFor whoever wondering - https://www.ag-grid.com/change-log/changeLogIndex.php\n. Yep\nYou should redirect from the old one to the new if possible\n. Ill try to add an example soon. For the grouping, I have no aggregation and still it is very heavy.\nIll look into it more. Your table is the best table I have ever encountered, its worth the time :)\n. In your grid options, add this code:\n(This uses font awesome icons, you can use whatever you like)\nOfficial page:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-icons/index.php\nicons: {\n    menu: '<i class=\"fa fa-bars\"/>',\n    columnVisible: '<i class=\"fa fa-eye\"/>',\n    columnHidden: '<i class=\"fa fa-eye-slash\"/>',\n    columnRemoveFromGroup: '<i class=\"fa fa-remove\"/>',\n    filter: '<i class=\"fa fa-filter\"/>',\n    sortAscending: '<i class=\"fa fa-sort-alpha-asc\"/>',\n    sortDescending: '<i class=\"fa fa-sort-alpha-desc\"/>',\n    groupExpanded: '<i class=\"fa fa-minus-square-o\"/>',\n    groupContracted: '<i class=\"fa fa-plus-square-o\"/>',\n    columnGroupOpened: '<i class=\"fa fa-minus-square-o\"/>',\n    columnGroupClosed: '<i class=\"fa fa-plus-square-o\"/>'\n},\n. Oh, sorry, thought they existed....\nAfter further check, there are more icons that are not changeable:\n- Group icon (in the group row / menu)\n- Tool panel shown (eye)\n- Too panel hidden (minus)\n- Menu settings (3 lines)\n- Menu filter (funnel)\n- Menu settings & Menu icon for 'tool panel' are different. one is 'check' and one is 'grid', also unchangeable\n. Yeah.. I said that calling the function works correctly, but for some reason calling it from the header \"params\" kills the browser.\nDo you have any default testing plunker to create ag-grid examples/tests?\n(If not, Ill create one and try to replicate the performance issues im facing)\n. Sure, @ceolter  here is a plunker: \nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/IWn5IDBa9roECqcv36Fv?p=preview\nOpen both groups.\nNow that they are open, please double click the first row in the first group, It will select-unselect it,\nGo to the second group, and double click the first row. It will just select it.\nIf you still don't see it, I might not explain myself very well, Ill make a short video.\nLet me know\n. Very minor. Does not really a concern for me. Just found a bug and thought I should report, because you guys are actively perfecting the library\n. Well, I just tested my code on both versions. in 4.1.X it does return the correct order.\nI explained why getAllDisplayedColumns does not fit my needs, and I can't work with it.\nIf not intended to get it back to what it was, Ill create it specifically.\nPlease let me know what you decide\nThanks\n. Undefined method.. Also not documented in the website\nTypeError: self.grid.api.getAllGridColumns is not a function\n. @smelyakov Yep, thanks! How did you reproduce?\n@ceolter This is a major problem for me, don't know why but it happens a lot for my tables..\n. No built in solution for NG1? (do we need to implement every time, or did you make it global somehow?)\n. No problem. It shouldn't be difficult, I laid all the logic down, just need to find the right scope to put it in :)\n. Hi again @ceolter . Now that pivot is released, can you please go over this and see if this is something you would want in the grid?\n. Oh ok... thanks anyway\nI think it is very useful, because for me data comes from many sources, not one.\nIll try to implement it again soon, if Ill get stuck again Ill ask in the forum for help :)\n. Thanks for considering!\nYeah, I'm not really sure what pivoting is, just read it is 'a powerful feature of excel' - so when it will come out my boss will probably like it. Any time frame on that? (not pushing, just interested)\nI'm trying to help other insignificant issues here so you'll have more time for mine :) (And because I love helping people)\nThanks again\n. That is really cool!\n. I didn't really fiddle with infinite scrolling since then, as I found it unfinished. glad it was overhauled, if I'll have problems with the new version I will create a new issue.\nThanks. If you will provide a working plunker, using 1.13, I can try to figure it out.\nHere is a 4.2 plunker, change what's needed to make it 1.13 http://plnkr.co/edit/IWn5IDBa9roECqcv36Fv?p=preview\n. These are your filter changed options:\nfilterModified: () => alert(1),\nbeforeFilterChanged: () => alert(2),\nafterFilterChanged: () => alert(3),\nThey execute in order of the numbers I wrote.\nFor executing after, and just getting the filtered rows, I then just do:\nafterFilterChanged: () => console.log(gridOptions.api.inMemoryRowController.rowsAfterFilter),\nAnd it shows the filtered rows in console\nHere is a plunker:\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/jGFRAzzLTPuGZ6AHJ0oJ?p=preview\nPlease tell me if this is what you wanted\n. Thanks\nI don't fully understand why it happens, even with your explanation..\nHope you can fix it in a patch update, for now I went through all the places I use getSelectedRows and filtered the null values out.. \n. K, will do next time!\nCan you please permit my user to the enterprise forum as well?\nhttps://ag-grid.com/forum/member.php?action=profile&uid=1708\n. Yea it is fixed!\nThank you so much\nI now understand why it happened, and that makes me wonder - if everything is a group, this must be possible - https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/issues/974\n(Becasue every group calculates aggregated data, and even without me creating a group, it seems like it calls the aggFunc by itself)\nAlso, can you please permit my user to the enterprise forum as well?\nhttps://ag-grid.com/forum/member.php?action=profile&uid=1708\n. Yeah of course, I usually do\n. Will do! Thanks a lot\n. I'm not sure I fully understand what you mean, but you should read about the 'comparator' function, it may help.\n\ncomparator(valueA, valueB, nodeA, nodeB, isInverted) - Comparator function for custom sorting.\n. That's no problem using a comparator function.\nLets say your data model is this: {class: 'RED', value: 1}\nSo your function should be:\n\nfunction customComparator(value1, value2) {\n    if(value1.class != value2.class) {\n        var classes = {\n            'RED': 1,\n            'YELLOW': 2,\n            'GREEN': 3\n        };\n        return classes[value1.class] - classes[value2.class];\n    }\n    return value1.value - value2.value;\n}\nAnd of course you should declare the classes as a global variable, otherwise it will always need new memory\n. It will.\nHowever, you can model your data to look like the object I described, and then use cellRenderer to print just the number.\nThis is just my help as a guy who works with the grid for quite some time now... Maybe @ceolter has a better answer, though it seems he is busy these days so I wouldn't count on a swift answer\n. The only way I know how to do so is using cellRenderer. If you already have one for that column, you can extend the function. (call the other cellRenderer from a new one, and wrap it or replace in it)\n. Please try running gridOptions.api.refreshView();\nIf that gives you the result you want, then you can look here for the best refresh method for you:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-refresh/index.php\n(You are using soft refresh, that works only for volatile columns)\n. They actually do work, just not in the way that you would expect.\nThe jan column shows a number, and a currency. That number is a round formatted number, so for example if you try looking for 81081 which is shown on the table, you will find nothing, because this is just a cell rendered value, while if you look for the real value - 81081.49 you will find it.\n\nNote:\nTo know what is the real value of a cell, just right click it, and copy.. @ceolter I think closing this issue is a mistake.\nI think the issue shows a problem with the main example.\nEither there should be a custom filter there, or a text filter, but not the number one, as it will not \"really\" work for people who are trying the grid for the first time - and I remember that the example page is what sold me on it, so I would not take it lightly\n. Ag-grid is free and is licensed under the MIT license. You can use it by cloning, downloading, or preferably npm install ag-grid\nIf you mean is it possible to use the ag-grid-enterprise without a license, the answer would be yes, you can use it without a license for 2 months, only if you press the big green button on the website here saying \"try ag-grid enterprise for free\"\nNote, that the license for the enterprise version is custom, so you should read it here\nThis should send an email to the ag-grid team asking for a 2 months free trial.\nTo download ag-grid-enterprise you would do the exact same as above, but the name of the repository is ag-grid-enterprise and not ag-grid. (you would need both). @ceolter I'd love to. However, I have to enlist to mandatory army service this year for 3-5 years. (I am 18), so... do you have any remote openings? :). Retired? You don't look that old. I would agree on that. Working on location is much more effective than remote. Better communication. Thanks! I was not aware this is possible you just saved me around 20 seconds a day trying to convert mailto links to addresses.\nHere is a way to do it client side:\nhttps://developers.google.com/web/updates/2012/02/Getting-Gmail-to-handle-all-mailto-links-with-registerProtocolHandler. Yeah I know, just wanted to save you doing stuff twice.... Also, mobile support - \n\n. Status for this issue? It seems to be partially changed (some of the stated features were changed to bugs), but not fully.. @makinggoodsoftware Not really, no. Good points.\nSome possible reasons for why the file is so large:\n- Uglification is already done, except for some comments. uglify again, will save only 0.14%\n- Old code is sometimes left behind. Search the file for \"as of\" and you will find 8 methods that were deprecated in versions 1-3\n- I am not sure, but it seems like the main grid file is having full support with angular/Vue/Aurelia/web components, and that (depends on what is done there) can bloat it. Separating into several files can be beneficial to space, however can be confusing for new users.\n- Main reason IMO: the grids has no dependencies. It relies on nothing, and as such, has to code everything inside of it. You mentioned UI-Grid - UI grid has far less options, and is relying on angular methods. where for example you would want to duplicate an object, AG must write the method, while UI can just angular.copy, and lots of methods like that. (same reasoning goes to every dedicated grid. They use what they already have. Especially jQuery ones). @JustinDFuller I will strongly advise against it.\nIf you are worried about loading times, just serve it as a gzip package. saves 60% of the file size..\nI agree that a modular approach can indeed be very nice to have, however, I don't know how much refactoring they would need to do for that, and I think it is best to first clean the pipeline off of bugs at least.\nAlso, the enterprise version is awesome! You can see the differences here .\nDeveloping an in house solution (out of experience) would be a real pain. Stuff won't work as integrated as in a large open source framework, that has constant issues raised and solved daily.\n. @theodorejb Are there any issues using this library and running tree-shaking with webpack/other bundler?. @theodorejb Fair enough. This is something that can really help, because the grid offers so much, and many use so little.\nI hope Sean will manage to get it soon. (this quarter is almost done). I do not see any errors, however, it is quite clear what is going on,\nThe scroll is in the middle, meaning that the middle part is being rendered. Then, after some manipulations, the view updates (still renders middle) and then the scroll changes, meaning that you are left to see dead space.. @seanlandsman Please add this to the pipeline, as this is a very annoying bug, with 100% reproduction rate. @seanlandsman Mass adding of stuff to the tracker, something had to fall fall between the cracks :). @ceolter If by latest, you mean the same version that is on the website, but is not fixed yet.\n(If you are testing an internal build, I can't confirm)\n. @ceolter I just checked this on v9.0.3 which was released 4 days ago. Bug is still there.. @ceolter @seanlandsman @makinggoodsoftware Please reopen.. @willhalling Thanks. I am not using the grid ATM, so I won't need that patch :) Just noticed on the example page. Please note, that if this is a problem with ag-grid-enterprise it is more suited to be opened here: https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid-enterprise/\nYou mentioned you were using the cell rendered, which is no real value for a cell. Does your columns have a \"field\" or a \"valueGetter\" as well? . Fair enough.\nI am far from sure the following is gonna work, but you should try if you are stuck.\nTry using a valueGetter. You can inject parameters into the grid, or globally, and do something like:\nvalueGetter: \"enumeration1[data.value]\"\nWhere enumeration1 is:\n{\n    1: \"val1\",\n    2: \"val1\",\n    ....\n}\nThe reason to use valueGetter is that the value you will get will be the result of the getter, and not the 1-5\nDoc: https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-value-getters/#gsc.tab=0. For \"does this feature exist\" you can either check the website or this grids comparison - https://github.com/AmitMY/grids\nI haven't used ag-Grid for a while now, because I don't need any data tables, so I can't tell you by heart if something like this exists..

Because it is after your\ngrid in the markup, your div would be returned instead.\nA similar problem could occur if I had a CSS selector of \"#south\" to style\nsome div on my page, but which ended up breaking your grid.\nOf course, since this is not actually causing any problems at present for\nme, and probably others, you can put it near the bottom of your backlog.\n. @ceolter Many people are using flexbox for layout now, myself included wherever possible. I strongly suggest you put time into ensuring the grid works with flexbox as much as possible, or it will quickly be considered antiquated. Given you are endeavouring to create a cutting edge grid that works with the latest technologies, getting it working with flexbox is important.\nI don't mean that the grid should use flexbox for layout itself, because that would break compatibility with older browsers.

The basic functionality is that if a user clicks an expand icon in a row, I'd like to be able to fire-off an AJAX request to get more data on that item and then present that data using a \"drop-down\" (animated show/hide) drawer with a full column span that I can provide a rowTemplate for. As you noted in your last response, I tried using the grouping functionality to create a single item grouping and then aggregate the item details to the top grouping \"container\" row, using a combination of suppressCount, groupAggFunction, groupUseEntireRow & groupSuppressAutoColumn.  I was then hoping I might be able to \"hide\" the actual row in the group so all you have visible is the grouping \"container\" row and provide a template for the footer to use as the \"drawer\", but neither of these appear to be possible.  An example of this attempt can be found here:\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/sBCiSLVykuD69LKXvfrt?p=preview\nI also tried using a gridOptions.rowClicked callback and loading another data item to be placed after the clicked item, but realized this implementation might break down when combined with sorting and filtering and also didn't provide the desired ability to style the extra row with a new height and full column span.\nUnfortunately, using a second data table or a popup dialog for this additional data are also not feasible in my application for various reasons (design requirements, screen real estate usage, etc.)\nThanks for your work on a great grid, hope to be able to use it soon!\n.

    "cc1000": "+1. If you could keep us up to date with any change in ETA that would be great :)\n. @ceolter, will the implementation you're working on work with virtual scrolling, or will it be disabled (as with aggregation and grouping)? \n. Is there any way to suppress the remove (minus sign) icon that shows when dragging? With this suppressDragLeaveHidesColumns set to true this still appears. \n. As a workaround I'm doing the following (to prevent pinning completely):\ngridOptions.onColumnPinned = (params: any) => {\n    if (params.pinned) {\n        this._gridOptions.columnApi.setColumnPinned(params.column, null);\n    }\n};\nIt would be great to have an explicit suppress option for it though, as with suppressDragLeaveHidesColumns. \nWould there be any way to hide the pin icon while dragging as well (this also goes for suppressDragLeaveHidesColumns, as asked in https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/issues/829)?\n. Thanks for the quick reply. \nIs there any workaround you can think of, aside from tracking the state of the controls and adding it back again?

    "squarewave24": "yes this would be a killer add-on to an already great grid! \n. is it possible to create a github examples in Angular2 for these: https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-master-detail/index.php ?\nthere is one full width row example in your ng2 examples repo: https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid-ng2-example but that has a different implementation so not sure how to add a more complex master / detail area. running into interface issues in Typescript \n. can you point to any example how to expand row height depending on row contents? \nI am using the cellRenderer to append sub row contents, and would like to increase height as needed. \n. tried following the example on agGrid Row Height page, but getRowHeight isn't called on angular2 grid \ngetRowHeight: e => { \n            console.debug('getRowHeight' ,e.row.data);\n            return 50;\n        },\n. i thought that's what i followed. are you talking about \"Row Height More Complex Example\" ? isn't that one using getRowHeight ? \n. here's my entire options. getRowHeight is never called \n```\ngetOptions() {\n    return {\n        rowData: this.Products,\n        columnDefs: this.columnDefs,\n        getRows: (params: any) => {\n            console.log('getRows ', params);\n        },\n    enableSorting: false,\n    enableColResize: true,\n    groupHeaders: false,\n    rowSelection: 'single',\n\n    onRowClicked: e => console.log('a row was clicked', e),\n    onColumnResized: e => console.log('a column was resized', e),\n    onGridReady: e => console.log('the grid is now ready', e),\n    getRowHeight: e => { \n        console.debug('getRowHeight' ,e.row.data);\n        return 50;\n    }\n}\n\n}\n```\n. hmm i upgraded to: \n\"ag-grid\": \"5.2.x\",\n\"ag-grid-ng2\": \"5.2.3\"\nstill nothing. any specific method I should debug ? \n. i debugged it, and it appears that rowHeight got defaulted somewhere to 22, so getRowHeight was not called. \nto work around this i had to default rowHeight to null..\n. is there a way to trigger the grid to call getRowHeight later? like for example if i add some \"expand\" type UI element where i want to add more content on click? \ni can see that i can trigger it by re-binding the data, but there is maybe a less involved way? like maybe re-setting a single row? \nthis.gridOptions.api.setRowData(this.Products);\n. ok figured it all out.  \non cell click I can add objects into my data item (i.e. this.Products[0].OtherItems.push(x), \nand then after calling setRowData(this.Products), above will appear in getRowHeight so i can set it accordingly. not too bad :+1: \n. +1\n. got it, \nso in the latter scenario which event can i use to call column autosize? seems whatever i try calls it too early because columns are not sized properly until i do it one more time manually by clicking a button after data has loaded. . this is a local call right now so there is no timezone offset. getValue() returns correct value, grids newValueHandler gets the wrong value. not sure where to troubleshoot what happens in between these 2 events. oops sorry i figured it out. \nin this case I should use onRowDataChanged i confuse those sometime :) \nlooks like it is passing in an empty object, should it be passing rows?  . ok so it looks like global grid events work in this fashion, it's just the cell click handler of the column does not.. \ni think i could get around this using global events. . hey thanks! \nnot sure how services apply here though? it just seems that the column click handler is not executed within angular context, so it wouldn't have any effect on services just like it doesn't on class variables. \nalso not sure how the parent/child ways can be leveraged from column click component. \ni am now working on doing this via the global grid click handler which seems to be executed within angular2 context. \nthese are just my findings/assumptions, i may be wrong! .

    "ataft": "ag grid is so much more than handsontable. mini-excel-in-the-browser is a totally different thing...\nagreed with everyone here that this is a very important feature of grids. i think it would be a mistake to think of it as a separate table and think that @ceolter got it right with \"i guess this could work almost like the header currently works, except it displays something different, and doesn't need to sort / filter / re-size etc . . \".  the only addition would be that it should use the groupAggFunction to aggregate and the cell renderer to format the same as the other cells.\n. thanks for this feature, it's a great improvement over the footer that I hacked into my grid.  i'm wondering if there's any thought about adding an option for \"showTotalizer\" on the master that would not require a slave grid to be configured separately?  it seems that there is a lot of necessary code in order to create a summary footer when it could just use the configuration from the master.  as it stands, one has to duplicate their logic for aggregation, figure out how to update totals when the master grid data is updated, rebuild it when grouping is changed, and so on.  maybe i'm wrong, but i would think that most users of angular-grid would want a footer summary on most/all grids they create.\nif this is not in the works, how would i go about updating the footer summaries when filters are applied?  also, what's the best way to rebuild the grid when the groups change?\n. just saw that this was addressed yesterday. you're on top of it, thanks!\n. interesting. i think as time goes on and word of angular-grid gets out, you may have a different type of user. i'm using it as part of a reporting and analytics offering, not just a simple excel-like spreadsheet, and i think that this is a big draw of angular-grid over the other ones.  in this type of usage, summarization, footers, and grand totals (which i bugged you about in another post) are critical. there are a million grids that do basic excel-like functions, but angular-grid is much more than that. again, i think your community of users will change as they see why angular-grid is better than the rest, not just faster.  personally, i hope that it doesn't get bloated with add-ons like the tool panel, but rather allows us to build our own column and grouping management, using the grid as one part of a bigger picture with other content.  thanks again!\n. This issue is back, but now the group header aggregates disappear when you simply expand a group. Before, they disappeared after a scroll away and then back. Again, look at the Grouping Footers example here: http://www.angulargrid.com/angular-grid-grouping/index.php\n. thanks for the reply. from a UX perspective, users do not react well to disappearing data. i can see your point in cases where the footer is visible when you expand, but when the footer is not visible, it's even more of a problem.  i've been in the reporting industry for 15 years and this immediately stood out as a bug/undesirable behavior.  is there any way to make this configurable?  also, i'm using a custom groupAggFunction and the header aggregates show as \"NaN\" rather than blank (see screenshot below).\n\n. The \"NaN\" was due to an error in the cellRenderer since params.value is undefined. Easy fix.\nAs for the \"keep header\" feature, since the design is already \"groupIncludeFooter\" (true/false), perhaps the logic would be \"groupKeepHeaderOnExpand\" (true/false)?  Or, maybe your \"header/footer modes\" gives you more leeway if/when new ideas come in later.\nI can see the use for a P&L report, where most/all of the details fit on the screen.  I would definitely use the 'drop header' feature both ways, depending on the report.\n. Same data in the header and footer.  This is useful for reports where you have to scroll down to see the footer.  I agree this would be undesireable for reports that you don't have to scroll to see the footer.  I can't see a use case for different data in the header and footer, that would just be confusing unless it was labeled, which would get messy.\n. awesome, you truly are the best!\n. The \"headerGroup\" title from the columnDef should be shown.  I was thinking it would be best as a separate row than the \"headerName\", but perhaps a concatenation of \"headerGroup - headerName\" is  better.  Either way works for me.\n. good call\n. Oops, I meant to say the floating footer cell for a grouped COLUMN does not appear. In the screenshot below, there is no way to set data for the first cell (highlighted in red) in the floating footer, correct?\n\n. I'm not sure how this is possible, but \"colid\" still appears intermittently in my application, apparently when the class is \"ag-header-cell-sorted-none\". See below, there's a mix of \"col-id\" and \"colid\":\n\n. This new code breaks non-pivot grid grouping. For my temporary fix, I've created a variable for \"isGridPivoted\" and am using that like below:\n```\napi.forEachNode( function(rowNode) {\n    if (rowNode.group && (!isGridPivoted || !rowNode.leafGroup)) {\n        rowNode.setExpanded(false);\n    }\n});\n```\n.

    "smwbis": "@ainasiart Thanks for the code snippet. That works pretty well. \nOne question, do you sort on that column as well? When I click the checkbox, it selects/deselects all just fine, but it also triggers the sorting. Did you come across a way to suppress the sorting when checking the box?\nMaybe I need to do this with the header template instead of the header cell renderer?\n. Thanks @ainasiart. I am actually already putting this on a column that is just the checkbox and nothing else. My users wanted to be able to sort on items that were checked. However, I put an external filter to only show selected rows and that gives them what they need. So I have suppressed the sorting on the checkbox column now and it works great.\nAlso, for my use, I only want the \"select all\" to select all the filtered rows, not all of them in the data set, so I tweaked your code for that. Figured I'd share in case it helps anyone else.\n```\nfunction headerCellRendererSelectAll(params) {\n        var cb = document.createElement('input');\n        cb.setAttribute('type', 'checkbox');\n        cb.setAttribute('id', 'selectAllCheckbox');\n    var eHeader = document.createElement('label');\n    var eTitle = document.createTextNode(params.colDef.headerName);\n    eHeader.appendChild(cb);\n    eHeader.appendChild(eTitle);\n\n    cb.addEventListener('change', function (e) {\n        if ($(this)[0].checked) {\n            _.forEach(vm.gridOptions.api.getModel().rowsAfterFilter, function (node) {\n                node.setSelected(true);\n            });\n        } else {\n            _.forEach(vm.gridOptions.api.getModel().rowsAfterFilter, function (node) {\n                node.setSelected(false);\n            });\n        }\n    });\n    return eHeader;\n}\n\n```\n. @dhintze Sorry, I totally missed your question. I was on vacation for a few weeks back then and must have missed it in my flurry of emails upon return, sorry.\nIt may not matter anymore, but to answer your question, I was using v4.0.5 at the time. With v5, there were some model changes (they are not documented and therefore not part of the public api, so they could [and did] break with a new release). In v5, it appears to be gridOptions.api.rowModel.rootNode.childrenAfterFilter that will give you the data rows remaining after filtering. \nReally though, instead of doing this:\n_.forEach(vm.gridOptions.api.getModel().rowsAfterFilter, function (node) {\n    node.setSelected(true);\n});\nI should have used the documented forEachNodeAfterFilter(), since it is specifically for iterating through the nodes after filter, and it would not have broken with the version update:\nvm.gridOptions.api.forEachNodeAfterFilter( function(node, index) {\n    node.setSelected(true);\n});\n.

Shouldn't the ColumnChangeEvent fired at least have the column and columns properties set in step 2?\n. I think the documentation is incorrect. There's only a single scope per row, so a generic value property wouldn't make sense.\nYou could do something like this:\ncolumn.cellRenderer = function (params) {\n  return '{{data[\\'' + params.colDef.field + '\\']}}';\n};\n. The angular plugin for Chrome Tools isn't working for me on the example page, but I do see the ng-scope class on each cell. But each cell is using the same $scope since the $id property is the same. If there was a separate scope for each cell, I think the grid would be much slower.\n. I think my use case for this is no longer needed in my application, but this is easy to do from the application side anyways via getContextMenuItems and looking for a flag on the colDef.\n. I'm experiencing similar problems. If I scroll with the mouse wheel, scroll is pretty smooth. If I scroll by clicking and dragging the scroll bar, it's very jumpy.\n.

    "captainkirk128": "Thanks Niall!  This makes sense to me. \nI am trying to implement this - I am looking for the best way to get the \"how much size is left\" number.  I have the total width of the columns in the grid (through this.eBodyContainer.style.width ) and need a standard way to get the total width of the eBody. eBody.style.width = \"\" , and previously I was calling eBody.clientWidth to get this \"overall width\" value.  Is there a more robust way to do this?\nSeparately - one additional point that came to mind: if autoFitColumns is true, and the total width of the columns > the overall width, then this function should size the columns regularly and toggle the horizontal scrolling.\nWhat are your thoughts?\n. Sounds good to me - in that case, when should I revisit this auto-size feature?\n. Hi Niall,\nSaw that 1.7 includes the Filter API.  I'm thinking the Filter API could be leveraged to support this feature?\nAlso, separately - do you have an estimated time of completion for Server-Side Filtering/Sorting? That feature would be particularly useful for me! :)\n. Yes - to add more detail: \n1) Load data (first page) into grid. - first page sent from the server\n2) Set filter on a col - have the filter be representative of my entire data set, not just the first page sent from the server\n3) Load data again, this time using the filter. -Say I select two options from the filter: one item was loaded through the first page, and one item was not (due to the infinite scroll) so that item would remain on the server.  The filter would still need to know that second item was on the server, even though it was not loaded initially.  Selecting the two options would then load the data appropriately.\n. The set of options would be fixed, and the data would need to come from the server.\nI want to avoid re-implementing the default 'Set' filter, but I need to retrieve all the possible filter options from the server even if all the data for the grid is not sent - if that makes sense\n. The first part would be awesome! Do you have an idea of when this would be implemented?\nAlso, thank you for the quick/helpful responses.\n. +1!\nThanks @ceolter \n. Thank you (as always) for the swift response! The functionality I am looking for was included in Version 1.4.1.  Specifically, I am looking at changes in the sizeColumnsToFit function within the grid API.  In the most recent version, it appears to get the available width variable through the following:\nvar availableWidth = that.gridPanel.getWidthForSizeColsToFit();\nWhereas in 1.4.1, this is done like so:\nvar availableWidth = that.eBody.clientWidth;\nIt looks like the getWidthForSizeColsToFit method in gridPanel uses this line - but it seems to pull the old clientWidth off the eBody, i.e. it still does not pull the updated width when the change is made. Instead of pulling the updated with, it pulls the previous width of the grid.\nFor reference - I am setting my height and width like so:\n<div ag-grid=\"mygrid.gridOptions\" class=\"theme-fresh\" ng-style=\"{'height': mygrid.gridHeight, 'width': mygrid.gridWidth}\"></div>\n. It appears this now works in the most recent version!\n. ",

    "JimmyBoh": "One point of consideration I'd like to bring up is the ability to internationalize/localize (all) the text built in to the grid. Is there any support for this? Maybe instead of extracting the panel just expose a paging API, then we can create our own UIs (with text) that just call in to the grid to change page, etc. (And still have an extractable panel, for simplicity/common use cases.)\n.

It isn't in your src files, it is a problem with the generated dist file. I haven't looked into the build process for this project, but when each of the different components are concatenated and wrapped in the outer-most IIFE it lacks the semi-colon. I had a site that was breaking when I added a new script that was dynamically bundled after angular-grid.js. Adding the semi-colon fixed it.\nHere is a pretty bad diff of what fixed my problem: https://www.diffchecker.com/ttyuctyu\nAlso, this is still a potential problem even if switching to Typescript. It can happen to any client-side javascript file that gets concatenated without a semi-colon to separate it.\n. Actually, this might be an issue with browserfy or stringify, if that is the gulp module that is actually creating that outer IIFE. I will reproduce the issue later today and post the exact error.\n.

No, I need to be able to set the page prior to the pagination being rendered.  I have a leader board that shows player rank.  My server side search returns a user who ranks 27th so they are on page 2 with the grid set to 25 rows per page. When I get the search data, the data reflects that it is page 2 of the total pages and returns row 26 thru 50. There is no way to set the row or page in the grid that will trigger the pagination indicating page 2 of ... Currently it will always show a server side search result as page 1 therefor I cannot correctly paginate through a server side search result. clicking 'Next' will request startRow 26 and endRow 50 which will result in the exact same page I already had and 'Previous' is not available when it should be.\nWhat I need is a method to set startRow, endRow or current page after search data is returned.\nSomething like api.setRows(start:number, end:number) or api.setCurrentPage(page:number).\nEven passing in the current page with params.successCallback( this.rows, this.rowCount, this.page ) would be acceptable.\nThank you, any assistance is appreciated.\nGreg\n. Awesome! Thank you for great data grid framework and the amazing integration with Angular 2.. My current work around for keeping the pagination in sync is to do one of the following, however; it is not ideal since it triggers requesting the exact data that was just received in the prior search.\n/** The search result page we received is not page 0 that ag-grid thinks */\n          // Could do this.\n          this.gridOptions.api.paginationGoToPage(this._pageNumber - 1);\n          // or this\n          // this.gridOptions.paginationStartPage = (this._pageNumber - 1);\n          // this.gridOptions.api.onSortChanged();\n          return;. Master/Detail is only supported in rowModelType normal which is the in memory row model.\nhttps://ag-grid.com/forum/showthread.php?tid=5548. Thank you Sean,\nI switched to the enterprise row model, however; there is little consistency in instantiating the full width detail rows across models.  The method setExpanded is present however the getFullWidthCellRenderer and getNodeChildDetails are never called and the detail is never rendered.  In fact the ag-full-width-viewport and its container remain an empty dom element. Adding cellRenderer: 'group' to the column configuration does nothing. There is no documentation explaining what is required to achieve a full width detail row with the enterprise row model. Groups appear to be completely different from a master detail view and Lazy loading groups is all that is discussed under enterprise row model.\nThis being said, it would appear that as of version 9 the features that are presented, such as master detail, only work withing a narrow range of use cases since most row models do not support them.  So, you can have pagination but not with master detail, etc.  It would be nice to have a table showing exactly what is supported with which row model to reduce frustration and waist of time.\nSomewhat related; I tried to use my enterprise key in a plnkr in order to share the issue but it seems to never validate the key.. Master/Detail only works in the normal or in memory row model\nhttps://ag-grid.com/forum/showthread.php?tid=5548. ",

I don't need an event to be fired to let me know I called sizeColumnsToFit(). :) \nAlternatively sizeColumnsToFit() could have a stopPropagation parameter added.. Oh ok, I didn't realize rangeSelection was a requirement for copy/paste to work. Thanks. \nIt looks like I also have to have suppressCellSelection off (false), otherwise it doesn't work. I would consider that a bug, but already mentioned it under https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/issues/87 and it's not Material specific, so it's probably better covered there.\n. ",

    "DominicTobias": "The enterprise copy feature copies a whole row, how can I just copy the cell? (which would be a more common choice in my opinon). I can see the latest AG Grid in the Balham demo seems to work but I can't seem to select individual cells with v14.2. Docs are a bit confusing, don't say what type it's expected to return or anything, but it seems \u02cbtooltipField\u02cb should be an array since it errors with \u02cbthis.colDef.tooltipField.indexOf is not a function\u02cb?\nBasically when I shorten a floating point in a cell, I want to show the whole value simply using a html \u02cbtitle\u02cb attribute. I would have imagined something like this:\ncellRenderer: params => params.value.toFixed(8),\ncellTitle: params => params.value. @13sergy that works for childless headers only unfortunately, but I suppose the user can style based on those not having a particular class. It's quite strange behaviour, for me I get two events and the previous selected node fires AFTER the new one. At least if it was the other way around it would be less likely to break things. Also both event.type are \"rowSelected\", but at least I can filter out the unwanted one with a event.node.selected check.. The whole universe is still eagerly awaiting this feature. I find that documentation pretty unclear as to whether you're supposed to pass an object or not, but either way it is unreliable and scrolls to whatever position it feels like, I've tried both ensureNodeVisible(event.node, 'top'); and ensureNodeVisible(event.node, { position: 'top' });.

Any idea how to filter menu items in the react version? getMainMenuItems seems to have no effect. Nowadays the enterprise bundle is 1.75mb (they bundle the grid twice).

Crazy how bloated it is right!? And that\u2019s just the community version not\nthe enterprise which adds even more weight.\nThey should have made a plug-in architecture where features are optionally\nadded.\nI\u2019ve extensively used AG for over a year now on dozens of grids and the\narchitecture is awful. Strange API choices, no support, bugs, terrible\nperformance, second class framework support (you pay perf penalties), and\nworst of all a lot of state held internally which gets lost when the data\nupdates like row selection, expansion state etc\nOn Wed, 13 Feb 2019 at 20:34, Dzintars Klavins notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n[image: screenshot from 2019-02-13 22-32-18]\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20469200/52741968-57471700-2fdf-11e9-893b-ab1434d545ab.png\nNo!

Even though AG has virtual scroll it performs quite badly with 600+ rows, gets really bad with 2000+ to the point you can't type a filter without 2s lag etc (notice on their 1 million rows demo they debounce the typing). With socket updates the grid is unusable unless you programmatically call the API to update rows (passing in a new data object redux style totally kills it). You have to only use vanilla HTML renderers but the real world perf is still bad with all optimisation tips. \n\nIf I was making a grid I would start with https://bvaughn.github.io/react-virtualized/#/components/Grid and Storybook - then build up the basic core e.g. cell selection, copy & paste, column defs, customisable renderenders. I wouldn't bother with IE support and keep it optimal and lean both in terms of DOM Layout efficiency and JS. I would make a plugin architecture for things like XLSX handling, master-details view, tree view etc to keep it composable and more easily maintained. I would probably pick one framework like React, reason being is that you can't make a framework performant by rendering it individually in thousands of cells, unless there is some way around that issue.\nMost importantly though I would make a declarative CONTROLLED component - no internal state, you fire events and it's the user's job to tell the component what is selected or expanded etc (by passing in \"props\" (React terms)). This creates a bit more boilerplate but saves huge headache in the long run when you are having to listen for grid events, saving state and then restoring it using the programmatic API when data or page changes. Also by making it \"prop\" driven you don't need such an extensive API and it's more predictable and testable.\nWith regards to the API, we have lots of things that have grown organically but make the API unwieldy - e.g. some options can't be functions so if you want them dynamic it's more cumbersome. We have headerRenderer + headerName (but no way to just output some simple HTML without taking over sorting, filtering etc handling ourselves...), onSelectionChange + onRowSelected, millions of suppressX, cellRenderer + cellRendererFramework etc etc - too much inconsistency, for example why not headerRenderer which can be a string, html string, a function, a framework etc? Over the years the API grew and became more unwieldy and documentation sometimes good and sometimes not, there are too many ways to do a similar but subtly different job.\nBut I have no doubt that a full featured grid is a big undertaking and I understand that over the years things can grow, and when you try and make everyone happy the complexity gets hard to manage etc.. Actually I can't replicate this issue on a plunkr modified from the React Redux example (https://plnkr.co/edit/iqNoxxIzAwxZ74wqJFW7?p=preview). Perhaps it's due to the AG version or not using the react wrapper and using a custom one instead. Hi, was this added? I can't see it in the backlog but equally see nothing in the docs about it - https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-tree-data/\nEdit: Never mind can do it like this:\n```js\nonExpandAllClick = () => this.gridApi.forEachNode(node => node.setExpanded(true))\nonCollapseAllClick = () => this.gridApi.forEachNode(node => node.setExpanded(false))\n```\nThough it isn't as performant as expandAll/collapseAll, freezes for a number of seconds on a small dataset (~700) following best performance practices.. Thanks @reignmaker, that's very obscure on the master details docs, it's only in a code example and not stated anywhere in the rest of the doc!.

For now I've solved it like this:\n\n```js\nprocessCellForClipboard = (params) => {\n    const rangeSelections = this.gridApi.getRangeSelections();\n// When there's only 1 cell highlighted, AG-Grid will copy the whole row\n// which is undesirable.\nif (rangeSelections.length === 1) {\n  const rangeSelection = rangeSelections[0];\n\n  if (\n    rangeSelection.start.rowIndex === rangeSelection.end.rowIndex &&\n    rangeSelection.start.column.colId === rangeSelection.end.column.colId &&\n    params.column.colId !== rangeSelection.start.column.colId\n  ) {\n    return '';\n  }\n}\n\nreturn params.value;\n\n}\n```\nAlthough this produces a ton of whitespace around the value because clipboardDeliminator by default is \\t, and not sure if it can be dynamically changed. Not sure if there is a higher level hook where I can trim the value?. In the end I had to also override sendToClipboard to do a trim. And since ag-grid-enterprise doesn't export it's modules properly (requires ag-grid/main rather than ag-grid) I couldn't use ClipboardService but I have a function for that which works better on mobile devices anyway:\njs\nsendToClipboard = ({ data }) => {\n  copyToClipboard(data.trim());\n}. @joshmun thanks! will try it out. Edit: Great, that worked. Managed to do it by looking at AG source code, this should be documented in https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-header-rendering/ and headerComp should be exported as headerRootComp doesn't seem to work:\n```js\nimport { HeaderComp } from 'ag-grid-community/dist/lib/headerRendering/header/headerComp';\nclass HeaderHTMLRenderer extends HeaderComp {\n  init(params) {\n    super.init(params);\n    this.eGui.querySelector('[ref=\"eText\"]').innerHTML = params.displayName;\n  }\n}\n```. Here's the order in code (note ISIN and AMC Currency are the FIRST and SECOND items in the column):\n```js\nexport const pasteColumns = [\n  orderId,\n  intrumentBBG,\n  direction,\n  filled,\n  averagePrice,\n  fxRate,\n];\n// If we don't spread these AG grid messes up column ordering :/\nexport const pasteResponseColumns = [\n  isin,\n  amcCurrency,\n  orderId,\n  intrumentBBG,\n  direction,\n  filled,\n  averagePrice,\n  reutersPrice,\n  fxRate,\n  trixFxRate,\n];\n```\nNow look how they appear when rendered. Exactly the same code was working in v18:\n\nThis happens whenever we dynamically update columnDefs. In this case we added ISIN, CCY, FX Rate and Trix FX Rate.\n. This is definitely related to the other issue, the only way I can fix it is to make new references to the columns. Seems like a major regression in AG I would suggest writing some tests which tests for col-id and ordering when dynamically changing column defs:\n```js\nconst copyDefs = defs => defs.map(def => {\n  if (def.children) {\n    return merge({}, def); // deep merge\n  }\nreturn { ...def };\n});\n```\njs\nexport default function gridConfig(isRichView) {\n  return isRichView ? copyDefs(richGrid) : copyDefs(simpleGrid);\n}\nedit: this fixes column order breaking but not the appending of _1 to column IDs. I reverted to v19 as not even v20 fixes this.\n. Thanks for the info @saif003 glad it\u2019s not just me or something weird I did!. ",

    "PTC-JoshuaMatthews": "@ceolter  Will the fix for this apply to tree formatted data? For instance right now filtering is narrowing the leaf nodes by removing ones that don't match. I need to implement a type of filter to allow searching for non leaf nodes by name and see matching nodes with all of their ancestors even if the children do not match the filter. Is this possible?\nFor example, in the file explorer example in the documentation I would like to be able to search for \"Program Files\" and get a view where only the tree necessary to display that folder and its ancestors is visible. So \"Windows\", \"boot.ini\" , \"system.config\" and \"D:\"  would all be hidden in this view.\nis there any way to accomplish this currently with a custom filter?. @adrianromanko  The workaround is to add data to each leaf node as it is being parses in the getNodeChildDetails function. That way when searching \"just the leaf nodes\" you can do a find on that extra data that encompasses every node up to the parent. Hope this helps.. @ceolter Thanks for tracking the issue! Is that link supposed to be public? I can't get in without a login. \nJust want to add that my company is looking at purchasing the enterprise version, and this request has been a must have feature in other grids we have evaluated. Would love to see this implemented, the grid is amazing!. Another idea that would make the workaround posted above easier to live with, but I'm not sure if possible, would be if there was an easy way to access the grid's internal filtering and sorting functionality through the api. If I could pass the entire dataset to the grid api and get back a filtered and sorted list (based on the current filter/sort models) that I can then page on, that would prevent needing to create a custom sort and filter function. Especially since the one in the example doesn't implement advanced filter functionality available when using the column data type (like greater than, less than, starts with, etc), which will bloat it quite a bit more to implement. Is an approach like this possible at all currently?. @seanlandsman  Thanks! I will let them know!. Just adding that I am hoping for this feature as well!. @ceolter  Is the future here yet?. Any word on this? Is this feature in the roadmap?. ",

    "erwin-beckers": "It would be great if mouse/keyboard selection works like the way you would expect it (by default)\nand that we could override the behaviour by catching the keyboard event callbacks\nMOUSE:\nclick = deselect all rows and select the current row\nCTRL+click = select or deselect current row\nshift + click = add all rows from previous selected row to current row to selection\nKEYBOARD\nHOME = goto first row\nEND = goto last row\ncursor up/down = deselect all rows and select the current row\nshift+cursor up = add previous row to selection\nshift+cursor down = add next row to selection\nSPACE = select or deselect current row\nCTRL+SHIFT+HOME = select all rows from current position to top\nCTRL+SHIFT+END = select all rows from current position to end\n. In my opinion the focus should be moved to the row 1 page below ?\n(And for when pressing page up, move the focus to the row 1 page up)\nWhile you are at it.. would it be possible to add support for the HOME/END keys also ;-)\n. ",
    "stephanjust": "Going to bump this here due to the inconsistency between mouse and keyboard selection.\nClicking a cell selects the corresponding row. CTRL+clicking a cell toggles the rows selection state (multiselect). However, pressing space for any focused cell behaves like CTRL+clicking, meaning it toggles the state instead of deselecting other rows. I'd like space to behave just like clicks.\nConsidering people use these features already it's not feasible to change them, but allowing to override this behavior would be very useful.\n. > Interested in hearing about this workaround as well. I have requirements where specific cells within a column are not editable as well as specific rows being completely uneditable.. Any advice would be appreciated\nAs mentioned in the first post colDef.editable can be a function that receives a param object to check whether a clicked cell is editable. While this function is defined on the column level, nothing stops you from adding arbitary values to a row and check for these in the editable function. We're currently doing exactly that and it works great.\n. > And I would like to suggest AG team to change this event like this. Cause mostly user like to move focus using navigation keys while using edit mode\nI highly doubt that (and in fact I know that our users are tabbing through tables constantly) and it also wasn't my original idea.\n Cosndiering @ceolter 's comment I expected that the new focus is simply not applied, meaning a double click/tab would have no effect(potentially with a visual hint and/or toaster, but that's up to me). I expected this to be in newValueHandler as this is the position where new values are handled, but doing so in the CellEditor itself is just fine (we work around it at the moment by resetting focus on the original field, it's a niche use case for us anyway).\n. https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-column-definitions/ -> newValueHandler(params)\nis what you're looking for. If you don't do anything in this function nothing happens, meaning the value is only accepted if you change it yourself. Example:\ncolumn.newValueHandler = (params: { node: RowNode, data: any, oldValue: any, newValue: any, rowIndex: any, colDef: any, context: any, api: GridApi }) => {\n    const validation = doYourValidationHere(.....);\n    if (validationIsSuccesFull) {\n        // save value in your row\n       params.data[column.field] = params.newValue;\n    } else {\n        // not succesfull, doing nothing will automatically discard the input (do nothing)\n    }\n};\n. Ah sorry, that was a misunderstanding. I thought your issue was to recalculate the previous value, not the new one.\nI asked about exaclty this before too as it's not possible at the moment:\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/issues/1071\n. > because of the difficulties present, it may be better to document how to catch the tab event, and then let the user decide which row / cell gets the focus. it would be ag-grid's job to make sure this callback mechanism exists for the user.\nThis sounds like a decent solution. I could currently think of people asking to always tab into the first row (total), into the first visual row (based on scrolling) and we probably have a use case for the last total row (as it's an input dummy that acts as a search field).. There are multiple posts about this (#946 #1058 and some more). I'm not sure why this is the default behavior but one of the previous posts (that I can't find anymore) mentioned to just handle the selection yourself:\nonRowClicked: (params: { node: RowNode, event: MouseEvent }) => {\n    if (params.node.allChildrenCount > 0) {\n        var select = true;\n        var clearSelection = true;\n        if (params.event.ctrlKey) {\n            select = !params.node.isSelected();\n            clearSelection = false;\n        }\n        params.node.setSelected(select, clearSelection);\n    }\n}.

    "BevanR": "\ud83d\udc4d  (+1)\n. Any update on this @ceolter?\n. This issue's title is currently \"Allow delete & update of rows in infinite scroll\".  However we already have api.refreshRows(rowNodes) to update multiple existing rows.\nShould the title of this issue be \"API functions to add/remove rows, even virtual paging\"?\nWe propose adding;\n- api.insertRow(rowData, index) to add a new row at index\n  Existing rows at and greater than index get bumped down (incremented by one).\n- api.removeRow(index) to remove the row at index\n  Existing rows after index get bumped up (decremented by one)\nWe've used remove instead of delete to avoid edge cases or implementation details where the JavaScript delete might have been useful but conflicts.\nStretch goal ideas\nRoughly in order of priority;\n1. Should ag-Grid emit events for these?  E.g. rowInserted, beforeRowInserted, afterRowInserted, rowRemoved, beforeRowRemoved and afterRowRemoved.\n   This would allow the developer using ag-Grid to add and remove classes during these events to, for example, facilitate animation.\n2. And/or perhaps ag-Grid can add such classes automatically; this would be especially useful when inserting/deleting multiple rows (see next idea).  E.g. ag-row-inserting, ag-row-removing\n   Otherwise debouncing multiple calls to insertRow/removeRow could become challenging.\n3. We have suggested singular methods, but perhaps they should be plural?  Or both?\n. 1. Row sliding upon insert/delete would be a very nice feature.  Otherwise the addition/deletion will cause jumping/jarring.  However it might be very challenging with virtual scrolling\n2. It appears that as long as the class is removed in the next turn/cycle after DOM is modified, then the classes are still useful for CSS-based animations.  E.g. https://jsfiddle.net/o2apnLpu/8/ \n3. Or even in the same JavaScript cycle with a small hack.  E.g. https://jsfiddle.net/szhfwcoh/8/\n4. Indeed, JavaScript events are more useful than classes; if we only get one; JavaScript events please. :)\n. Thanks @coelter!\nIs there a dev build or nightly build we can try it out with?\nDo I correctly understand the problem with removeRow() as follows? If the parameter is a;\n1. row index, the client (consuming ag-Grid) is likely to get confused (buggy) when the user (human) sorts or filters the data.\n2. row node or the row's unique identifier (server-side ID), if the row is not in the viewport, ag-Grid can't tell whether the row is above or below the viewport\nWould simple cache invalidation cause a redraw or UI flash?\nPerhaps;\n1. This is the client's problem.  Can we make that clear in the documentation?\n   (Thanks for trying to keep the API easy to use and fool-proof! \ud83d\udc4d  )\n2. \n   1. \n      - Does ag-Grid know the nodes or unique idenrifers of all rows preceding the current viewport? E.g. if the user scrolled past them?\n      - Can ag-Grid use that to know whether row is above or below the viewport?\n   2. In our implementations of ag-Grid with virtual pagination we have had to store a map of the selected state of all rows so that the selected state of each row persists beyond the current viewport, and can be restored when the selected row returns into the viewport, or when the user executes an action the selected rows.  If ag-Grid stored such a map of the unique identifier (and selected state?), would it then be able to determine where a row is by row node or unique identifier?\n. 1. Cool!  Is there a way we can be notified when there are a new versions?\n2. Ahah!  Now that we've had a toy with this, refreshVirtualPageCache() is easier and better than the new insert method, barring a possible bug/improvement noted in https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid-docs/pull/41\n3. Awesome!  Initial integration attempts suggest this will let us delete a lot of code!\n. Done.  Thanks!  One more followup; https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid-docs/pull/44\n.

Thanks so much. I fixed it locally and works great:)\n. OK. Is there anyway I can compile the DOM that I wrote inside groupInnerRenderer? It has ng-click event which not seems to be firing and it should need to be compile but not sure how as Scope is not accessible inside innerRenderer.

Yes, Please review the GridOptions.\n. Also, I am wondering we can change the background color for a specific Group inside innerRenederer based on condition\n. I have a scenario in which I have to change the background color of Group to Red. As the DOM is not ready before the groupInnerRenderer function execute, I setup a logic like this\nfunction groupInnerRenderer(params) {\n```\n            setTimeout(function () {\n            if (params.node.children[0].data.isInDiscussion) {\n\n                angular.element(\".ag-body-container div.ag-row-group[row=\" + params.rowIndex + \"] span.ag-group-cell-entire-row\").css('background-color', 'red');\n            } else {\n                angular.element(\".ag-body-container div.ag-row-group[row=\" + params.rowIndex + \"] span.ag-group-cell-entire-row\").css('background-color', '#aaa')\n            }\n        }, 500);\n\n        return '&nbsp;&nbsp;<span><a data-ng-click=\"vm.takeAction(' + \"'\" + params.node.key + \"'\" + ');\" href=\"\"><i class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-tasks\"></i></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;' + params.node.key + '</span>';\n    }\n\n```\nNow let's assume I have two groups that return back from the server, the groupInnerRenderer called twice and look at the property isInDisucssion, if it true then it will set the background color of group after 500 ms after the Group row rendered.\nThe problem is after I perform some action on any of the group and rebind the grid, I noticed the groupInnerRenderer function call 4 times, 2 with the initial states and 2 with the updated result. However, the group remains the same which is 2. Any idea why it render more than the Group count after the grid rebind where as on hard refresh it works fine and call twice which is expected?\n. I am sorry, but I thought as this issues have already been closed and I was in the same context so still continue here. Again sorry, I will open this question on Board.\n. I see, but in previous version I didn't have to set the height manually, why it is needed in the latest release?\nAlso, now I need to set the height manually, any idea how would I make the grid not use vertical scroll bar? something like making the grid height to auto but this not seems to be working.\nI am sorry, will use board next time for these kind of questions.\n.

It does scroll it to the top though.\nfunction setDataSource(data) {\n                let isApiAvailable = self.options.api;\n                if(isApiAvailable) {\n                    let pageSize = parseInt(self.selectedPageSize, 10);\n                    self.options.api.setDatasource({\n                        paginationPageSize: pageSize,\n                        rowCount: data.length,\n                        getRows: (params) => {\n                            if (!angular.equals(params.sortModel, self.currentSortModel)) {\n                                self.currentSortModel = params.sortModel;\n                                data = _.orderBy(data, self.currentSortModel.map(model => model.colId), self.currentSortModel.map(model => model.sort));\n                            }\n                            params.successCallback(data.slice(params.startRow, params.endRow));\n                        }\n                    });\n                }\n            }\nDo you see anything that's obviously wrong here?. Hi,\nI've got an update - after upgrading to version 9.1.0 I'm able to use the API function paginationSetPageSize function successfully i.e. self.internalDataGridOptions.api.paginationGoToPage(self.viewModel.currentPage);\nWhatever changes were done must've fixed this issue, so many thanks!.

Just to add to this, happens with mac & chrome, and windows & chrome, but also works with windows & chrome!\n. @markheron91 thanks for the feedback - in the issue you've raised I cant see any paths. Is this still a problem? The documentation has changed quite a bit in the last couple of weeks. thanks @markheron91 - those parts are definitely incorrect. I have updated our documentation with the correct paths\nthanks for reporting this. @ohohco We're actively working on vuejs support at the moment - we're hoping to have something out in the next couple of weeks. Thank you for reporting this - I've set a 301 against the old one\nIt time the old one shouldnt appear in searches anymore. As per the forum - compile headers is only applicable for ng1. For ng2 we'll shortly be providing the ability to use components in the header.\nFor ng2 issues/requests please raise them in the ag-grid-ng2 repo. ag-grid-ng2 7.1.2 allows for any version of 2.1.0 and above. Hi\nIf the provided filter doesn't suit your purposes then yes you'll need to create your own filter component - you can find details on how to do this here: https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-filtering/. @don-bluelinegrid @sousarka we'll take a look at this today. We've just release 7.2.1 to fix this - thanks for reporting. @GustavSt 7.2.2 has been released now too - that should fix this for you\n. Thanks for reporting - I'll correct this now. Animation was only added 7.x - if you want this feature you'll need to upgrade I'm afraid\nthanks. I would say so yes - 5.x is relatively old now, a great deal has been added since then. Hi \nSorry for the inconvenience here - this change is documented as a breaking change on the changelog (https://www.ag-grid.com/change-log/changeLogIndex.php) but I appreciate that this is still annoying\nNext time we'll ensure that breaking changes are kept for major releases. \nWe've added this to our backlog to consider for a future release - thanks. This issue is AG-52 - you can track the status of this on our backlog: https://www.ag-grid.com/ag-grid-pipeline/.

As per the issue template, please raise support questions either via the ag-grid forum, or stackoverflow/gitter. hi - no, its always an empty object. I'll discuss with the team and see if we can simply remove this parameter from being passed in the first place.\nClosing this issue as you seem to have resolved your initial problem \nthanks. Hi\nI think the docs need to be updated here - this event is specifically for row selection, not any selection. I'll update the docs to be clearer, but as a solution you could use the cellClicked event to trigger what you're after. @jlame - yes, onSelectionChange should really be call onRowSelectionChange\nThe onCellClicked event should contain both the row & column information you're after here. The current cancel parameter does this - if you set it to true it will cancel the editing (ie won't accept changes).\nIs this not what you're after?. Great, glad it worked out - closing this as it looks like this has been resolved\nthanks. Going forward please dont post support questions here. Pay attention to the issue template you're prompted with before posting.\nTake a look at https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-sorting - you can supply your own comparator. thanks for reporting this - I've raised an issue our side (AG-207) for this\nYou can track its progress on our pipeline page (https://www.ag-grid.com/ag-grid-pipeline/) but we'll update this issue when its been resolved too. Hi\nThanks for reporting - this is a known issue and already on our backlog (https://www.ag-grid.com/ag-grid-pipeline/): AG-179\nI'll add a comment referencing this issue too though. Hi\nI've taken a look and can see that AG-179 has been marked as a duplicate of AG-62. Please reference AG-62 going forward for this issue\nthanks. Please do not cross post. You've already raised this issue in the ng2 repo. Please raise support requests on either stackoverflow or the free forum: https://ag-grid.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?fid=4\nGithub is for issues only please.. \"So they cannot all reach the same array for me to make my own list\"\nI'm not sure I understand this - it's true that forEachNodeAfterFilterAndSort will callback in turn, but this shouldnt stop you building up your own array\nSomething like this\narray = [];\ngridOptions.api.forEachNodeAfterFilterAndSort(function(node) {\n    array.push(node);\n}). Hi - this will be available in the next release, to be released this week, or early next week at the latest. This isn't a bug, this is usage problem - please refer to https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-api/ for help on how to use the API.\nTo clear data in the grid try gridOption.setRowData([]) - you might need to do the same for the column definition if they're changing too. Hi\nClosing this due to inactivity. If you can reproduce the issue please feel free to raise a new issue, along with a test case that illustrates the problem - thanks. tracked by AG-235. @rajgopalk - can you please confirm that you're talking about date filters - thanks. Good answers @AmitMY - thanks!\nOne slight correction though - apart from angular 1, the frameworks support (angular, vue, react etc) isn't actually included in the core ag-grid or ag-grid-enterprise libraries. \nThe core code provides generic hooks/support for components/frameworks, and the framework libraries use these to support the given framework.\nThe single biggest reasons for size are the items you've mentioned - we don't rely on any external dependency in our code. This should not be underestimated - if you included the size of dependencies of other components I'm pretty sure you'd see a marked increase in overall size (although I've not measured this). The other reason is as you say keeping older code around to support backward compatibility - this has to be done as I dont think people would thank us for a small library size if we broke functionality on a regular basis.\nWe do cleanup old code occasionally (after a reasonable period), so this is a small part of the code size. \n. this is however an interesting point - something we'll discuss internally in the dev tame\nthanks!. Hi all - I've been taking a look at rollup and have hit a number of issues with it. \nIts still a work in progress but at this stage I don't see us being able to offer support for it in the short term I'm afraid.\nI have managed to use SystemJS Builder to work, but the resulting bundle wasn't all that much smaller \nSorry I don't have better news for you on this front. tracked by AG-238. Hi @AmitMY \nThis has now been added to the pipeline as AG-384 - I'm not sure why it wasnt before, apologies for that\n. @AmitMY sorry, this slipped through my radar as it was closed - I've re-opend this now\nthanks. tracked by AG-233. hi - already raised here: https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid-react/issues/56\nthanks for reporting this. thanks - we'll take a look and get back to you. re link, thanks - this has been reported and will be fixed today. What we'll do here is raise a feature request to optionally exclude this char. \nAs this has been the csv export behaviour since introduced if we changed it now it might break expected behaviour for existing users . thanks for the update - I've made a note of this.

You have two options available to you here - use the context object:\nParent: https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid-angular-example/blob/master/angular-cli/src/app/from-component.component.ts\nChild: https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid-angular-example/blob/master/angular-cli/src/app/child-message.component.ts\nOr the angular suggested way to do this, which is to use services.. Hi,\nJust to follow up here, if you take a look at https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-row-models#row-model-summary\nThe header checkbox only supports the in memory model - this is by design. The reason is that for something like infinite (for example) how would the grid select items it doesn't know about/not yet loaded? \nFor anything other than in memory it comes down to the fact that all data may not be available, so the select all functionality here wouldn't have any meaningful action.. Hi \nWe are unable to reproduce this using 8.1.0 (chrome 56) on a mac. \n\nCan you please provide a bit more detail - are you on windows perhaps (not sure that would make a difference in this case) ?. As per the issue template, please dont use github for support\nTake a look at the api - try either ensureIndexVisible or ensureNodeVisible. If you're using DOCTYPE html you will need to set the parent container (typically a div) to a height of some value. If you do this the grid will work with a % as before.\nThis may help you http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10871898/why-cant-i-make-my-div-100-height-if-i-use-an-html5-doctype-how-do-i-get-it-1\n.

We dont support dynamic binding etc in cell renderer (or editor/filter) functions - functions are for \"pure\" js only.\nFor aurelia, you need to make use of templates (or components) - I suggest you take a look at the aurelia example project for examples of what we support here: https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid-aurelia-example\nGoing forward, can you please raise issues under the https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid-aurelia repo for aurelia related issues - thanks. Hi,\nThanks for the PR - some interesting ideas here. \nWe've done a number of changes around how you can update the grid, as well as providing RxJS examples here https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-rxjs/?framework=all#gsc.tab=0\nPlease have a look and see if this helps. It's unlikely we'll incorp RxJS support directly into the grid, but the api and examples above should hopefully help\nthanks for the PR!. This issue has been raised as AG-308.

Hi - we have a few pagination related changes going out in our next release. \nYou can track their progress in our pipeline page here: https://www.ag-grid.com/ag-grid-pipeline/\nOur next release will be out very soon.

With the next release there will be floating row filters - we're doing a release today. Please take a look at the filter docs here: https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-filtering\nYou dig in further on each time of filter below that\nYou want newRowsAction - this property determines what to do when new data arrives. Set this to \"keep\" and it should do what you need\n. Set filters do not support numeric comparisons - for that sort of filter you'd need to use a number filter or a custom one\nSet filters only a list of values (or none)\nthanks. Ok, I see, I incorrectly assumed you were using set filter, but see what you meant now\nThis looks like a bug - we'll raise an issue our side and it'll be fixed in the next release\nthanks. @hyyan yes, this has been fixed. You can verify this by trying the gold col (for example) here: https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-filtering/example1.html\nBoth via the filter ui or via the api the greaterThan 0 works as expected\nthanks.

Hi\nI am unable to reproduce this - do you have a plunker I can take a look at?\nthanks. Hi,\nNo, I'm afraid no updates - we are still unable to reproduce this . Looking at the head component code we can see the following:\nthis.eLabel.addEventListener('click', (event:MouseEvent) => {\n                this.params.progressSort(event.shiftKey);\n            });\nSo the grid is looking for click events for sorting - I guess good place to start would be to find out why a click is being sent when the column is being released\n. Sorry - thats in the core grid code. Was meant to offer a point of where you could look until we are able to reproduce it ourselves. Please follow the issue template README before raising issues.\n. Hi\nThanks for reporting - I've raised issue AG-416 for this our side. We'll update this thread with updates as soon as we have any.\nthanks. Hi Don,\nYou can track our issues in our https://www.ag-grid.com/ag-grid-pipeline/ page, but it's currently still to be triaged I'm afraid.\nI'll set some time aside tomorrow to see if I can find a workaround for you\nthanks. Hi Don\nSorry, but we did a release yesterday which took up a fair bit of time - I'll be looking at this today\nthanks. Hi Don,\nI've just taken a look at your plunker - when I try filtering out rows it appears to work as expected. What col & filter entries were you trying? What did you expect to happen that didnt?\nthanks. Hi Don,\nThanks for the update - I'm afraid I've not had time again to look at this, but I'll set time aside for this either later today, or tomorrow at the latest. I'll keep you updated with what I find\nthanks. Ok, taking a look at the plunker again I see that the problem there is that you're trying to filter on a floating row - floating rows arent included in the filtering operation\nTaking floating rows out of the equation from your plunker it does show that filtering does work will full width rows, so there must be something else at play here.\nI think a plunker may too much hard work for you as you're using aurelia, so what I'd suggest is that you create a github repo specifically for this problem (removing any sensitive code of course) that I can take a look at investigate\nIts entirely possible that there is a problem with the auerlia dependency here, but without a reproducible test case I cant verify this one way or the other.\nIs this something you can provide?\n. Hi @don-bluelinegrid - sorry for the delay. I'll be looking at these issues again early next week. Hi,\nYes, it works fine with angular 4. Hi\ngridReady should fire when the data has been set if using gridOptions.rowData.

Please dont ask for support in github - please use stackoverflow or our members forum for support\n. \nI've tried this with a master detail example (master level) and full width and it seems to work  - do you have a simple plunker for any of these that illustrates the problem?\nthanks. Hi\nClosing this due to inactivity. If you can reproduce the issue please feel free to raise a new issue, along with a test case that illustrates the problem - thanks.

For enterprise support, please raise them on our Members Forum here: https://ag-grid.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?fid=5\nthanks. As the grid utilises row virtualisation, only the rows that visible are rendered - as such we only attempt to style these rows when applicable.\nWhat you're seeing is the expected behaviour - if you want to suppress virtualisation then you can do so with the suppressRowVirtualisation property, but you may find that the overall grid performance suffers accordingly.

We've made changes to the codebase to accommodate 2.4 - this will be released at the end of next week, so the above PR (although appreciated) won't be pulled in\nbtw - although I've not tried this - does the ts skipLibCheck option help bypass this problem temporarily?\n. @TheTFo I'd suggest try either skipLibCheck (although I've not tried this),  or @davidm-public patch. @bobchyko @TheTFo @davidm-public @AlanCrevon @timfogarty-deluxe @guryanovev \nThe latest release of ag-grid should play nice with ts 2.4 - please raise a new issue if this is not the case for you\nthanks.

Hi\nAs a workaround you can add the suppressPreventDefaultOnMouseWheel: true and it should fix this for you\n. \nThis is due to a change in typescript 2.4. Change your cell renderer(s) to implement the optional refresh method\nTS 2.4 now insists on classes implementing interfaces with optional methods having all methods implemented. I think this is bonkers, but it is a TS 2.4 issue\n. Please dont cross post issues. Closing this. For now rolling back to 2.3.x is your only option - we'll see what we can do our side to help TS 2.4 users going forward, but this will only be in the next release. hi - the next release will support ts 2.4. The above change is part of a wider change for 2.4 compatibility\nWe'll be doing a release either tomorrow or early next week - wait for that release and TS 2.4 should work fine.

Hi,\nWe've taken this on board - I appreciate 12.x especially had a lot of breaking changes and I know that this can be frustrating.\nI've raised it with the team and we will endeavour to reduce this kind of noise going forward. Hi,\nI can't see any immediate reason for why this might change - we have of course made changes for 12.x, but nothing around animation. \nWe have made a number of changes around data refreshing, specifically around refreshing: https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-refresh/\nPay special attention to changes around refreshCells/redrawRows/refreshRows\nIf this doesn't help I'm afraid a repo of the example will probably be necessary\nthanks\n. Hi\nClosing this due to inactivity. If you can reproduce the issue please feel free to raise a new issue, along with a test case that illustrates the problem - thanks. Hi,\nI see what you mean - I've created AG-654 our side to track this.\nYou can still set the actual underlying colId (not the generated one), but this would set it for all of these columns, not just the specific one you're trying.\nWe'll update this thread with updates as soon as we have any.\nthanks. Hi,\nThanks for raising this. I've raised AG-678 our side to track this - you can view its progress on our pipeline page here: https://www.ag-grid.com/ag-grid-pipeline/\nWe'll update this thread with updates as soon as we have any.\nthanks. Hi\nDo you have an example of this? Looking at our examples I can see whole integers, but that's probably not an exhaustive test\nthanks. Hi @AmitMY - this is something we'd like to do and are aware of the naming change, but a lot of our users aren't I'm afraid.\nWe found that there was some confusion - at least initially - when we replaced Angular 2 with just Angular.\nI think this will remain as is for at least another few months after which we will switch to the new names.\nThanks for the suggestion though :-)\n. Hi,\nThis is expected behaviour - if you have a grid of a certain height where the rows + header heights dont exactly fit there will be an amount of space left over. You can try this by setting the grid height to 700px for example. Hi,\nFirst, you need to import AgGridModule differently now - please see https://www.ag-grid.com/angular-more-details/  for more information\nSecondly, this error is probably because you're doing some sort of server side compilation - is this the case?  . As the grid is designed for use in the browser, server side compilation wasn't really considered at design time\nThere is a ticket for adding support for this our side - AG-258. You can track it's progress on our pipeline page here: https://www.ag-grid.com/ag-grid-pipeline/. Hi\nIf you have a repo that we can look at that illustrates this problem we'll be happy to take a look at this issue. Do you have a repo that demonstrates this problem?\n. The new issue template is a template that people should follow when raising issues generally - ie a format they should use. As far as I'm aware there is no plunker template on it, unless we're talking about different things?\nEither way, this plunker should serve as a good simple starting point: https://plnkr.co/edit/369YrrgCVrnPjD528OtT?p=info\nthanks\n. @jogibear9988 - that looks like a copy and paste bug! I'll update that - thanks for highlighting it\nIn fact I'll update all our github repos to have a valid/appropriate plunker link. \nThanks for raising this. I've raised AG-667 our side to track this - you can view its progress on our pipeline page here: https://www.ag-grid.com/ag-grid-pipeline/\nWe'll update this thread with updates as soon as we have any.\nthanks. Thanks for the PR - we have an issue open for this already (AG-393) but I'll make a note of the PR you've submitted and raise it with the team\nWe'll update this thread with updates as soon as we have any.. getRowNodeId needs to provide a unique id per row - as it stands in your example the id isn't unique\nChanging it to return a unique id will fix your issue:\nfunction getRowNodeId(rowItem) {\n    return rowItem.group + rowItem.id;\n}\n. \nAs per the issue template please provide a reproducible example for issues, as well as completing the other fields\nAs this is for react, can you please raise any react related issues here: https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid-react. Hi,\nupdateRowData will return whats changed - you should be able to use this return value to determine whats changed within the grid. I'm afraid I'm not sure what you're referring to here\nIs this the line you think is incorrect?\nlet dataHasChanged = existingNode.data !== dataItem;\nIf so, what makes you think it's wrong? \nthanks. I'm afraid I cant reproduce this on our side - taking https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-filtering#filter-and-events-example as an example I can filter on the medal columns (bronze etc) as expected\nIf you can provide a reproducible example for this I'm happy to take a look and reopen if necessary\nthanks. I've just tried this on our examples and cannot reproduce it - do you get an error in the console?. You'll need to hide/show columns yourself depending on screensize\nHave a look at https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-responsiveness/\nfor example of this - it would have to be something you do programatically I'm afraid. Hi - if you're an enterprise customer can you please post in our members forum here: https://ag-grid.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?fid=5\nWe'll be able to assist you further there. If you don't have access please register on the forum and then contact accounts@ag-grid.com who will grant you access.. Hi\nI'm afraid we won't be adding support for XLSX anytime soon, primarily doing is much more complicated than XLS. \nWe don't rely on any third party libraries but you could use existing ones that support XLSX and use them yourself in order to provide this support\nthanks. Hi,\nThanks for raising this.

Hi,\nThanks for raising this. I've raised AG-679 our side to track this - you can view its progress on our pipeline page here: https://www.ag-grid.com/ag-grid-pipeline/\nWe'll update this thread with updates as soon as we have any.\nthanks. \nIn your component refresh, do you update the tooltips there? \nFrom the docs here:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-cell-rendering-components/?framework=all#gsc.tab=0\n// Mandatory - Get the cell to refresh. Return true if the refresh succeeded, otherwise return false.\n// If you return false, the grid will remove the component from the DOM and create\n// a new component in it's place with the new values.\nrefresh(params: any): boolean;\nIf you return true the grid will assume you've refreshed the cell - if false it will re-render the cell.\nIf this doesn't help we'll probably need a plunker or similar we can take a look at before we can assist you further. As per the issue template, please dont use github for support.\nEither post your query on stackoverflow, or if you're an enterprise customer on our members forum here: https://ag-grid.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?fid=5\nthanks. Hi,\nThanks for raising this. I've raised AG-685 our side to track this - you can view its progress on our pipeline page here: https://www.ag-grid.com/ag-grid-pipeline/\nWe'll update this thread with updates as soon as we have any.\nthanks. Hi,\nI can see the confusion here - the refresh method is utilised when individual row or cells are updates via the API for example (using api.refreshCells for example).\nWhen you use api.setRowData or the equivalent here (rowData={this.props.data}) then the entire data set is replaced.\nHaving taken a look at the documentation I don't believe that this is clear enough, so will update it to reflect this, which is especially relevant for frameworks that support binding (like react, or angular) in this way.\nI suggest you take a look at the docs here around data updating: https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-data-update#delta-row-data\nI think this option would be of most help in your scenario.\nAgain, I think it's worth us (ag-grid) highlighting this in the docs - I'll add a jira to do so over the next week or so\nthanks. Hi\nYou're right, that is how react works but it's worth noting that ag-Grid is not written in React, its a \"pure\" javascript component. We provide wrappers/interfaces like ag-grid-react, ag-grid-angular etc that act as a bridge between the two and for 99% of use cases do a great job of binding frameworks and the grid together.\nCases like this however require a little overhead on your part to get react & the grid to work together optimally. \nI hope this makes sense?. Hi\nAs per the issue template please dont post support requests here. Either use stackoverflow or our members forum (https://ag-grid.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?fid=5) for support queries.\nBy default the entire dataset should appear in the grid. If the grid is smaller than the number of rows you will need to scroll. If you're using anything other than the default row model then more steps may be required to display the full data set. For the second part, as Niall says you can use this:\ncellRenderer: function(params) {\n            if (params.value !== undefined) {\n                return params.value;\n            } else {\n                return '<img src=\"../images/loading.gif\">'\n            }\n        }\nFor the first item (and in fact as an alternative for the second) you can use the overlay API to display the overlay when there is no data (or when loading) - please see https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-overlays/ for more information\nI have raised AG-690 in the meantime to ensure the overlay behaviour is consistent across row models. Hi\nThanks for reporting this - I've added it to the exports. It'll be available in the next version\nthanks. I've raised this with the team and we agree that this could & should be easier to use - we've raise AG-698 to track and cover this.\nYou can see the status of this here: https://www.ag-grid.com/ag-grid-pipeline/. gridOptions.rowData is read once but not again - the grid will maintain its own copy of data with updates etc\nIf you want to see the latest data you'll need to use one of the api.forEachXXX methods. As per the issue template, please don't post support queries here. Use either stackoverflow.com, or if you're an Enterprise customer you can also use our Members Forum here: https://ag-grid.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?fid=5. Hi,\nThanks for raising this.

Our vue offering does not include typescript support I'm afraid. Hi - thanks for reporting. This has been fixed and will be available as 13.0.1 soon\nthanks. Hi @amirburbea - no, not yet - I'll try get to this tomorrow\ntanks. @amirburbea apologies for the delay in this - I'll pick it up as soon as I can, but this week for sure.\nthanks. hi - I can see what you mean once I update the dependencies. I'll take a look again at this tomorrow\nthanks. @amirburbea \nAn update on this - the initial errors I got where down to other dependency problems, not the grids, so I've updated the yarn.lock to upgrade the ag-grid deps to 13.3.1\nWith this the app starts and slowly fills up with data.\nBased on this I dont think I'm seeing what you're seeing (only the top row).\n. I'm afraid I cant reproduce this on our demo here: https://www.ag-grid.com/example.php\nAs per our issue template please provide more information in order for us to investigate further.. I've just tried this in our example and cannot reproduce this https://ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-aggregation/exampleGroupRowAggNodes.html\nIf you can provide a repro of this problem I'll be happy to take a look\nthanks.

Hi\nWe don't have much knowledge or experience with golden layout so will probably be able to assist here, especially without a repo\n. Thanks for the follow up - I've raised it as a comment to the issue above. If you can provide a repo of this issue we'll be happy to take a look. onFilterChanged lives on the api, not on iFilter\nthanks. Hi\nThat mehtod is a method I use in our internal BaseClass for filtering, and is not part of our published API.\nYou are assuming that whatever you retrieve through gridOptions.api.getFilterInstance(filterParams.colKey); is an instance of ag-grid BaseFilter but this is not the case when  using custom filters, which is why it's not on IFilterComp. It's not really for public consumption.\nThe safest approach is to call the this though the API \nthanks\n. I see what you mean - thanks\nI've updated the docs to use the API instead of the component method\nthanks for the feedback. Hi\nThanks for reporting this - this has now been fixed.

I mean aside from turning it on, and off, we can't really do much with it and I think that this might be worthy of a slight improvement.\nOn the other hand, this particular pull request makes it much easier to test.\nAgain, You are absolutely right, that the particular reason I gave in the starting point is not much for a reason to do this, but I'd like to ask you to evaluate my points in this comment a little bit more :)\nCheers!\n. This could be good as well.\nBTW, one more thing: Marking the checkbox with a unique attribut (value) is necessary since that is the only thing which guarantees a html structure agnostic way of selecting the given checkbox.\nLet's say you release a version of 2.3 where you modify the internal div structure of the cells. If a e2e test was written in way that it used those divs, all tests could break.\nIf I'll have time for it, then I'll try to implement your suggestion since it looks nice as well, and would do the job for us too.\n.

Said String contains a directive. In that directive I'm calling modals from the global scope, etc, and it works.\n. @jonrimmer Just wanted to help out by noting that the other one works. Maybe it helps the debug process for @ceolter .\n. He wrote back in the old days somewhere that He won't be providing tests, but the policy he forces on e.g. pull requests requires everyone to update relevant examples and docs. @ceolter am I right?\n. My problem still exists in version 3.3.3\n. @ceolter It's https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/blob/master/dist/ag-grid.js#L13532\n.

Problem solved by the following:\n- using dist/ag-grid.noStyle.js\n- including dist/styles/ag-grid.css\nThis way the grid has it's proper format, and works. Tests run as well.\nThanks @ceolter !\n. @AkosLukacs If your problem still exists, please open another ticket for it. I didn't wanted to keep this one open because it would be misleading.\n. @AkosLukacs No problem! :+1: \n. On my local project the following seemingly fixed the issue:\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/blob/master/src/ts/grid.ts#L557\nif (rowData && Array.isArray(rowData)) {\n    this.hideOverlay();\n    if (rowData.length === 0 && !this.gridOptionsWrapper.isSuppressNoRowsOverlay()) {\n        this.showNoRowsOverlay();\n    }\n}\n. My understanding  was that a cell's edit mode should be triggered by row, column, and in mixed modes as well. \nIf there is a row level edit mode defined it would implicate that all cells in that row go to edit mode at the same time if the condition evaluates to true.\nLikewise with columns.\n. You can override this behaviour. This won't look pretty at all, but currently we fall back to methodologies like the following:\nExample pulled from our source and stripped for brevity:\nvar row = this.gridOptions.api.rowModel.getRow(rowIndex);\nvar columnController = row.columnController;\nvar columns = columnController.getAllColumns();\nfor (var idxC = 0; idxC < columns.length-1; idxC++) {\n    var column = columns[idxC];\n    var nextColumn = findNextEditableColumn(columns, idxC, idxC);\n    // Prevent \"mutable variable is accessible from closure\":\n    (function (column, nextColumn, rowIndex, columnController) {\n            var renderedCell = columnController.context.beans.rowRenderer.beanInstance.renderedRows[rowIndex].getRenderedCellForColumn(column);\n            renderedCell.onNavigationKeyPressed = function (event, key) {\n                // your stuff\n            };\n    })();\n}\nSee: renderedCell.ts:436\n. @xwb1989 We had to because row level editing is not supported.\n.

Great library by the way!\n. It appears that in the function 'BorderLayout.prototype.layoutHeight' the height of the south container is always zero.  So your calculation to set the height of the centerRow container is correct it's just that the south container's  height isn't correct (maybe because it hasn't got any content at that point?)\n. @ceolter thanks for the quick response!

Do you have any other ideas or plans for cases where there are potentially 20-30 columns to select from?\nYes, it might make the toolpanel a little more generic, because not all data is shown initially, but as far as I understand that can be done without column grouping as well (by setting hide: true on the column).\n. Hi Niall,\nThanks again for the reply!\nWe're not using header groups in this particular case, but I also think it would be two different concerns being mixed. So in my opinion they should be different properties.\nIn regards to how to specify that grouping, I would definitely do it the same way as header groups.\njs\n{\n  headerName: 'Foo',\n  field: 'bar',\n  columnGroup: 'Group 1'\n}\nAll ungrouped columns should show up in an \"Other\" group or something similar. And if there are no groups at all, it could just become a flat list without groups.\nYou are right that the grid itself would make sense for the column picker. That is actually exactly what I would use if we decide against making that change! (I would do it outside of the toolpanel, though, because I don't fancy maintaining a fork of this excellent component).\n. I suppose that works, but I was hoping there was a way to do it without changing the column width.\n. By the way, Is sizeColumnsToFit() documented anywhere?

Hi Niall,\n             I got to know by googling that I can use property 'suppressMenuColumnPanel' for hiding column panel. But how to hide tool panel? I don't wan't to use property 'suppressMenuMainPanel' as it hides all other options like 'Autosize All Columns', etc.\n.

With the refactoring, I will create a new pull request (if needed, I haven't looked yet).\n. I apologize for the goofy formatting as well. Locally I don't see that...\n. It's used in src/ts/rendering/renderedHeaderCell.ts on line 256 in my changed file. \nAs for the intention, I was not adding this so that something could be sorted by \"default\" (so clearly it is poorly named), but more, when I go to sort this column AFTER the grid is rendered and I click the header, should the initial sort be DESC or ASC. The grid currently assumes everything should be sorted ASC first. As such, I don't think this is a duplicate of 'sort' and 'sortedAt'.\nFor an actual case study (I'll stick to the Olympic swimmers you use in the examples), say you had a grid that contained swimmer, country name, and # of golf medals and the data was initially sorted by swimmer. When I wanted to sort by gold medals, the current grid would start showing the swimmers in order from 0 through most medals THEN most through 0. It would be MORE ideal if we showed Phelps at the top of the grid when this column was sorted instead of the hundreds of swimmers who never got a gold medal (so the default sort direction would be DESC, not ASC) as it is much more likely that people want to see the \"most\" of something first. This would make sense for pretty much any type of statistical column, money, etc.\nI can change it to \"initialSort\" or \"initialSortDirection\" or \"sortDirection\" or ... if that helps (as I agree that \"defaultSort\" would confuse people when you can also have a default sort on the grid). \n. Quickly looked it over. I understand where you are coming from and your approach makes sense to me. It does make what I was asking for a bit more complicated (as I believe you would have to pass in ['descending', 'ascending']), but I have also given it some thought and have come up with no better solution for all the things you were juggling with sorting.

I'll try that out, because I'm desperate to have the functionality, and report back my findings. In the meantime, why don't you put it all together as a PR?\n. After a few trial and error I've got it working. It pains me to say that this has already been implemented by the author, but it's now under a commercial (paid) license. But, for those of you that want to continue using the free stuff, it's going to come in handy.\nI've done some changes, the reasoning behind them is written in comments above the corresponding lines, starting with //CHANGED:\n```\nonRowClicked:function(row) {\n                var lastSelectedRow = this.appSpecific.lastSelectedRow;\n                var shiftKey = row.event.shiftKey,\n                  ctrlKey = row.event.ctrlKey;\n            // If modifier keys aren't pressed then only select the row that was clicked\n            if(!shiftKey && !ctrlKey) {\n                //Removed the this.api.deselectAll(); since we can just tell the new selection to\n                //clear all previously selected rows (by passing a true in the second parameter)\n                //CHANGED: this.api.selectNode(row.node, true) to the following as per recomendation\n                //of the author (deprecation notice)\n                row.node.setSelected(true, true);\n            }\n                // If modifier keys are used and there was a previously selected row\n            else if(lastSelectedRow !== undefined) {\n                // Select a block of rows\n                if(shiftKey) {\n                    var startIndex, endIndex;\n                    // Get our start and end indexes correct\n                    if(row.rowIndex < lastSelectedRow.rowIndex) {\n                        startIndex = row.rowIndex;\n                        endIndex = lastSelectedRow.rowIndex;\n                    }\n                    else {\n                        startIndex = lastSelectedRow.rowIndex;\n                        endIndex = row.rowIndex;\n                    }\n                    // Select all the rows between the previously selected row and the \n                    // newly clicked row\n                    //CHANGED: `i <= endIndex` to the following so we skip the events callbacks (with the\n                    //third argument `true`) in all but the last iteration\n                    for(var i = startIndex; i < endIndex; i++) {\n                        this.api.selectIndex(i, true, true);\n                    }\n                    //And we make the last one with a `false` so we get the event popped up.\n                    this.api.selectIndex(i, true, false);\n                }\n                // Select one more row\n                if (ctrlKey) {\n                    //CHANGED: this.api.selectNode(row.node, true) to the following as per recomendation\n                    //of the author (deprecation notice)\n                    row.node.setSelected(true);\n                }\n            }\n            // Store the recently clicked row for future use\n            this.appSpecific.lastSelectedRow = row;\n        },\n\n```\n. Nah, I really don't care about \"I did it, I should get the credit\". Furthermore, I don't think it would pass Niall's approval since he clearly states in his project .md that \n\nPR's on new features are not generally accepted.\n\nAnd third I'm kinda bussy right now :smile: \nGlad to help :+1: \n. Oh, and I found something else, change\nif (ctrlKey) {\n    row.node.setSelected(true);\n}\nto\nif (ctrlKey) {\n    if (this.api.gridOptionsWrapper.gridOptions.rowDeselection) {\n        row.node.setSelected(!row.node.selected);\n    } else {\n        row.node.setSelected(true);\n    }\n}\nSo it emulates the deselection mecanism intended by the author (https://www.ag-grid.com/angular-grid-selection/index.php)\n. I'm sorry if I made you feel that way, not what I intended. I just stated that because I thought you just would discard the hipothetical PR as \"you're doing too much\" (since you don't want the project to ultimatelly be a community project).\n\nfree vs enterprise, all the selection stuff is in the free version\n\nWell, my bad.... but I don't know why I can't get it to work, neither in free nor in enterprise (I'm actually using this code here to make it work). I'll look into it.\n. @ceolter I'm back to spice this a little bit more. \nIn your docs you talk about selection, multiple selection and all that stuff (https://www.ag-grid.com/angular-grid-selection/index.php), but nowhere in that page it either implies or states that multiple range selection (the usual \"CLICK + SHIFT + CLICK\") works. And in fact, it doesn't (neither in your web nor in the many test cases I've put up). Therefore I', using my modified version of @anticommander 's code to make it work. No problems here.\nThe problem is that I now want to use enableRangeSelection (https://www.ag-grid.com/angular-grid-range-selection/index.php) and it doesn't work with my current setup. I think that, since I'm replacing the onRowClicked callback, it is absolutely foreseeable that it wouldn't work.\nThat brings up my question: will you implement click + shift + click selection in the future? The answer has been given, I know, just making sure. If the answer is still yes, will it be mutually exclusive with enableRangeSelection?\nIn the meantime I'll treat them as such (mutually exclusive) and disable/enable one or the other.\n. Ok, I think I have a pretty good idea now of what should happen when you add all of this to the mix. I'll try to make a PR with some ideas and let you all know so you can all try it out. Obviously, you (@ceolter) don't have to merge the PR, but it can serve as a basis for your final implementation.\n. You're absolutely right, sir. I missed this completely. I won't be able to\nwork on this until the weekend, but I can tell you I'll be doing thing much\ndifferently than this approach. I won't try to build a path (like in this\ncase) but rather build the functionality in the grid itself, and maybe\n@ceolter can review and merge the PR. We'll see.... looks like we're all\nbussy :smile:\nEl 30/3/2016 22:43, \"killyosaur\" notifications@github.com escribi\u00f3:\n\nWhile you are working on this, keep in mind that this should work when a\nuser is only using check box selection as well as on row click.

I've replaced those lines above with this:\njavascript\nvar targ;\nif (event.target) targ = event.target;\nelse if (event.srcElement) targ = event.srcElement;\ntarg = targ instanceof HTMLSpanElement ? targ : targ.parentNode;\nif (utils_1.Utils.containsClass(targ, 'ag-group-expanded') || utils_1.Utils.containsClass(targ, 'ag-group-contracted')) {\n    return;\n}\nAnd no, checkbox selection = not cool (I can't make use of the shift and ctrl + clicks commands, which are already working like a charm).\nI can understand if you don't want to change this, I'll just keep using the new lines I've come up with. Thanks for the really quick reply\n. ",

From the documentation: \n- When reasoning about how a hybrid application works it is useful to have a mental model which\n  - describes what is happening and explains what is happening at the lowest level.\n    *\n  - 1. There are two independent frameworks running in a single application, each framework treats\n  -    the other as a black box.\n  - 2. Each DOM element on the page is owned exactly by one framework. Whichever framework\n  -    instantiated the element is the owner. Each framework only updates/interacts with its own\n  -    DOM elements and ignores others.\n  - 3. AngularJS v1 directives always execute inside AngularJS v1 framework codebase regardless of\n  -    where they are instantiated.\n  - 4. Angular v2 components always execute inside Angular v2 framework codebase regardless of\n  -    where they are instantiated....\n\nNot very impressed with the adapter, running two apps slows down things and makes slow angular1 pages to perform much worse - zone.js triggers a lot more digest cycles than necessary on change :-( - dramatic performance hit.\n. Thank you, will create one hopefully tonight.\nOn another note, would be nice some methods to be made protected (rather than private) so methods can be extended without typescript complaining of extending private methods/ properties. It will allow overwriting classes to add custom behaviour. E.g. want to add setState / getState pair to add sort property to the state. \nTypescript still compiles if we ignore the errors.\nLet me know your thoughts.\nthanks\n. and use es6/typescript module imports instead :-) :+1: \n. the implementation is broken, does not take into consideration hidden columns, will fix and update the pull request today\nusing column.index property does not seem to be reliable with hidden columns, hence a possible solution would be\n```\n                    var columns = self.columnController.getState();\n                    var fromIndex;\n                    var toIndex;\n                columns.forEach((col, index) => {\n                    if(col.colId === sourceColumn.colId) {\n                        fromIndex = index;\n                    }\n\n                    if(col.colId === self.column.colId) {\n                        toIndex = index;\n                    }\n                });\n\n                if(fromIndex !== undefined && toIndex !== undefined) {\n                    self.gridOptionsWrapper.gridOptions.columnApi.moveColumn(fromIndex, toIndex);\n                }\n\n```\n. one of the aspects yes :-)\n. Agreed that it is your project and you should manage it in the way you think is best and respect your opinion. \nSlightly disagree about the necessity of code quality tools - e.g. sometimes you find yourself refactoring code and forgetting to remove a parameter declaration which is no longer needed, etc - code checker catches all sort of different tiny not necessary important details.\nAnd regarding the developers contribution - all of the new frameworks come with tslint by default - e.g. angular2 etc, inappropriate contributions are simply discarded.\nThank you.\n. You are doing a great work by the way, evaluated other tables too, but this one is in my opinion the most suitable to use with angular2 as of now. \nUsed slick grid in the past - but the support is discontinued at the moment. Might be nice to get ideas regarding functionality from there.\nTests will be a huge plus when selling to management :-) (Safe guard from regression bugs as the code / design upgrades) \nthanks\n. There are multiple different options there - from choosing what test runner to use (e.g. karma), what framework to use for assertions (e.g. jasmine/ mocha), whether to do the testing with using transpilers for typescript (e.g. babel - typescript with system js or webpack js) or simply include the generated ag-grid.js file and do a simplified js tests (assuming your tests are not written in typescript but in plain js).\nOn top of that you can decide whether to write unit tests using injectors (e.g. angular1 injector, then angular2 injectors etc) or simply test the core js (i would choose perhaps) in plain js manner.\nCan spend a few hours to help / give you some ideas if you like this week and next week, before switching my attention to universal js :-).\n\nOn 12 Jan 2016, at 10:28, Niall Crosby notifications@github.com wrote:\nyea i'm trying to get tests under way. spent a few hours on it yesterday then got annoyed with trying to configure it all. i'm very versed with testing from other languages. in javascipt, everything is so much more messey to get set up. how the hell to do i test typescript but use javacscript then integrate with node and gulp and then get grid modules loaded ahhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!! i'll get back to it again soon, but i had to move on and focus on features again as i was getting to bogged down. but yes, deffo, project is to large now, tests are needed.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/issues/635#issuecomment-170867106.\n. it is just the case of ColumnController having a property columns -> and each column inside that array already contains sort property and is easy to expose (alternatively it should not belong there?)\nFeel free to close if it goes against your design principles.\nThank you\n/Closed accidentally/ \n.

When using with Ctrl it would combine the selections just like the behavior described in this issue.\nBasically a similar idea to the enterprise feature for Range Selection but acting on full rows.. @ceolter Is there a way to get the aggregate of these events rather than handling each one? So rather than receiving 15 events like your example above, only receive a single event. The event would indicate that selection has changed in some way and doesn't tell you which nodes.\nCurrently I'm not sure how to know when I hit the 15th event (effectively the last event in a chain of selection events), so I'm not able to aggregate them effectively. I am only interested in the net effect of the events, not each of the individual select/deselect events. I want to call gridApi.getSelectedRows() after all the intermediate events have occurred.. ",

    "bdougherty1": "Hi,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I'm not well versed in this stuff so forgive the poor explanation, but when looking at the svg element containing the circle in the inspector in firefox it showed that it was inheriting display=block and width=100% from the graphing package css. As you say, the height=10 and width=10 were set on your svg element, but the style element seems to override those settings.\u00a0 I ended up with the column name 170px down from the svg circle for each column heading. If I force the 10x10 and inline with a local style setting, it displays as intended.

If you use filter again (and show more/all rows) and then filter only few rows again, the filter won't disappear - because the horizontal scrollbar is not all the way at the end. But if you move the scroll, then filter will disappear again.. @makinggoodsoftware nope, bug is still there. Maybe you have smaller screen resolution or console open?

I'm loading all my third-party libraries from their bower.json. I just load the main file.\nI realised that the main file in bower has been replaced on commit f014f714741263c2:\nFrom\n\"main\": [\n     \"dist/ag-grid.js\",\n     \"dist/ag-grid.css\",        \n     \"dist/theme-fresh.css\",        \n     \"dist/theme-blue.css\",     \n     \"dist/theme-dark.css\"      \n],\nTo\n\"main\": [\n    \"./main.js\"\n ],\nI replaced on my workflow to the file dist/ag-grid.js instead of main.js and now it's working properly. Hope works for you.\n. Hey @axelex, keep your bower.json the way @ceolter left on bower and fix your stream on gulp.\nYou can use merge2 combined to gulp-filter to load the correct files, like so:\n``` javascript\nvar gulpFilter = require('gulp-filter');\nvar merge2     = require('merge2'),\ngulp.task('default', function () {\n    //merge 2 streams in one\n    return merge2(\n        gulp.src(automaticFilesFromMainBower),\n        gulp.src([\n            './bower_components/ag-grid/dist/ag-grid.js',\n            './bower_components/ag-grid/dist/ag-grid.css',\n        ])\n    )\n    //Remove the main.js from your stream\n    .pipe(gulpFilter(['*', '!bower_components/ag-grid/main.js']))\n//...Do things you need\n\n.pipe(gulp.dest());\n\n});\n```\n. :beers: No worries! Hope works for you!\n. Hi @axelex you have to make sure you use the exclamation mark, like my example:\njavascript\n    //Remove the main.js from your stream\n    .pipe(gulpFilter(['**', '!*/ag-grid/main.js']))\n. can you post your gulp task here please?\n. I'm not sure why you have an .on('error'), but you suppose to filter just after your mege2, like so.\nAlso, you need to leave **\n``` javascript\nreturn merge2(\n            gulp.src(filesToInclude),\n            gulp.src(['./bower_components/ag-grid/dist/ag-grid.js'])\n        )\n        .pipe(filter(['', '!*/ag-grid/main.js'])) //don't change this line\n        .on('error', onError)\n        .pipe(filter('/*.js')) //I also think you don't need this, only if you want to ignore the .css files\n```\n. Use gulp-debug to check the files you have in your stream as well:\n``` javascript\nreturn merge2(\n        gulp.src(filesToInclude),\n        gulp.src(['./bower_components/ag-grid/dist/ag-grid.js'])\n    )\n        .pipe(debug({title: 'before remove filter'}))\n        .pipe(filter(['', '!*/ag-grid/main.js'])) //don't change this line\n        .pipe(debug({title: 'after remove filter'}))\n        .pipe(filter('/*.js'))\n        .pipe(debug({title: 'after second .js filter'}))\n```\nI would get rid of .on('error') for testing first. I'm not sure if that's causing an issue...\n. Not nice!\nIt seems they are all happening in parallel...maybe, we should try one by one and see how it works.\nAlso I found this fix for mainBowerFiles: \nhttps://github.com/ck86/main-bower-files/issues/117\nIt seems you're able to do your filter only js and also ignoring the main.js from ag-grid only with mainBowerFiles. \nPerhaps like that:\njavascript\nmainBowerFiles(['**/*.js', '!**/ag-grid/main.js'], {includeDev:true});\n. Btw, the first filter gulp.src(['./bower_components/ag-grid/dist/ag-grid.js']) is not working.\nWhere is your bower_components folder? Is at the same root as your gulpfile.js or behind it?\nBecause this interfere on your filters like ../ or ./\n```\nProject\n+-- /bower_components\n+-- gulpfile.js\nAlternative 2\n+-- /bower_components\n +- /Dev\n     +-- gulpfile.js\n```\n. No worries @axelex . I'm glad worked it!\nYou know, developers are patient in general!\n:beers: \n. @ceolter, if you must keep {main: ['./main.js']} instead of the previous, so I believe would be nice having a Warning for who is using gulp/grunt with mainBowerFiles, wiredep, or any script that read files from bower.json main.\nWarning that they need to remove main.js and replace with dist/\n.

    "Ruud-cb": "+1 on this. It is still an issue. Could it get fixed? As well as resizing columns on touch devices?\nAngular UI Grid has it working (col resize), perhaps take a sneak peak on that :)?\n. @ceolter I don't really see why you would want to navigate a single cell, which can't be retrieved anyway I guess, and then have to press spacebar again to select the next row.\nCould you make it possible to select the next row on navigating with arrows possible? An optional gridOptions property?\nOr a better question then perhaps: How do I receive the navigation events so that I can automatically select the next row? In the documentation is stated: \n\nThe grid element that receives the focus is provided to the cell renderers via the eGridCell parameter. \nlink\n\nHow?\n. @ceolter hmm, I see what you are getting at, and with that I would somehow set a new selected row I guess. Will have to look at this later but wouldn't it be an idea to have an optional setting that determines if navigating up and down will result in a new row being selected? Should I make an issue?\n. Thanks for the reply @ceolter. You are correct about the open-source project thing indeed, It just depends if a majority of the users would like to have this feature. Sometimes hard to track down. Anyway,  I indeed can use the onCellFocussed (altough it also fires when there is an data update:(, and not documented), Is there another function to set a row selected, with the given rowIndex from the onCellFocused event? Browsing somewhat trough the code there should be a node.setSelected, but ir requires a value parameter if I'm correct? What would be the easiest way in this situation.\nThanks!\n. @ceolter Thanks! It works! Yet still have the issue when data is being updated. The data is server-push based, changes can come in every second. With this implementation it will cause a short flicker because when a row is updated it the cellFocused event which will set the row selected.\nAny trick to prevent deselection when data is being updated? \nonCellFocused:  function (params) {\n    console.log(\"CellFocusChanged\", params);\n    if (params && params.forceBrowserFocus && params.rowIndex) {\n        var row = self.gridOptions.api.getModel().getRow(params.rowIndex);\n        row.setSelected(true);\n    }\n},\n. Check this plunker: https://embed.plnkr.co/w9ppmvKejR0QVr7CFAMb/\nClick  one row so that it is selected. Then watch what happens when items get updated.\n. @ceolter Can't we mark this as a feature request? I think it would be quite useful. \n. Any updates on this? It sure is an awesome feature I'm looking for as well. I use angular but I won't compile the rows by angular due performance. @AmitMY Did you implement it with the cell renderer? Could you share it?\n. @shivekundefined Well that depends how the filtering is implemented, if it re-renders the cells on each keypress than it should be possible without angular. But I guess it is not implemented that way... @ceolter  thoughts?\n. @ceolter I am using JQuery NiceScroll which eventually shows no scrollbar. I want the remaining space at the right, which is reserved for the scrollbar, to be 0px. I applied the style in css to my theme like you suggested but that didn't help anything.\n\nAnother issue I have is when a column is pinned right, it doesn't smooth scroll together with the main body. So the rows are not the same. And I can't scroll in the pinned column. I apply the same style to hide the normal scrollbar there as well:\n```\n.ag-body-viewport {\n    /class for ag-grid, override to have nicescroll scrollbars shown, and not the defaults/\n    overflow: hidden !important;\n}\n.ag-pinned-left-cols-viewport {\n    /class for ag-grid, override to have nicescroll scrollbars shown, and not the defaults/\n    overflow: hidden !important;\n}\n.ag-pinned-right-cols-viewport {\n    /class for ag-grid, override to have nicescroll scrollbars shown, and not the defaults/\n    overflow: hidden !important;\n}\n```\nResult:\n\nLeft pinned columns doesn't have this issue.\n. @nkoterba Thanks for that example! I wonder, could you check if this doesn't have the issue I described with pinned columns? Do they scroll nicely at the same time?\nAnd does ag-grid still reserve that space for the scrollbar when doing auto size to fit?\nDo you still need an example for nice scroll? It actually is pretty much the same, just initiate it on the .ag-body-viewport class\n$('.ag-body-viewport').niceScroll();\nAnd in css you would need to do this:\n.ag-body-viewport { overflow: hidden !important; }\n. @nkoterba thanks for your huge and well explained answer. Still sounds a bit like a drama :(.\nFunny thing is: when we open the ag-grid on a touch device, only a little scrollbar appears when scrolling. Actually perfectly what we want. I don't know since what version that is, but I have 6.1 now. Maybe it would be possible to use these scrollbars as well on desktop. @ceolter , is this a ag-grid feature or is this done by the browser? If it is an ag-grid feature, could we somehow force ag-grid to always use these scrollbars? This is exactly what we need.\n\nPlease consider re-opening this issue and mark it as a feature/bug?\n. Oh wauw, as you see in my plunker, I've set colId for every column, seems like it conflicts with something. removing or changing it's name resolved the issue.\nI'll leave it open if you think it is necessary to write a fix or console error for this?\n. The library adds a colid to each header column, assigning my own colid gave errors because it probably doesn't know anymore where to put the data. So just don't define a colid in your colDefs objects.\n. This might be helpful:\nhttps://github.com/angular-ui/ui-grid/blob/master/src/features/resize-columns/js/ui-grid-column-resizer.js#L463\nI guess modifying this file by adding event listeners would be enough?\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/blob/master/src/ts/headerRendering/horizontalDragService.ts#L54\n. Haha, that's the whole point for me for switching to ag-grid as well, I've read your blog  :).\n2 years from now seems a bit long though :(. Most features work just fine on mobile, yet the core features  (like resizing and moving) are especially needed for small devices.\nAnyway, thanks for the heads up, I'll have to do some workaround for this...\n. Ah misunderstanding. Looking forward to this :+1: \n. Hi @ceolter, The requirement to have the columns resized has come up a bit higher now. I'm wondering how difficult it would be to implement this? Do you think my second comment is appropriate or is it far more difficult? Considering forking it. Else I would have to create some overlay to resize a column which isn't user-friendly. \n. Hey @ceolter That's awesome! Will be testing that tomorrow \ud83d\udc4d .\nI've seen it working on angular ui grid, but they don't have the drag feature for touch devices. So Technically it should be possible but I can understand if it's difficult. The auto resize has to be used now or do that automatically per column.\nEnjoy your honeymoon, congrats!\n. I had the same problem. Plunker is not correct there anymore but you might have done the same thing. #1041 \n. @SharpieX I already solved it there by not setting the colId variable.\n. @Piccirello Hi, that seems to be working for the initial loading, thanks.\nOn resizing the columns (larger then view) the bug still happens. The onGridSizeChanged and onViewportChanged do not get triggered of course. . @Piccirello Yes I have and that is what I do in the first post. I added an timer to prevent an infinite loop, because the swapping causes a resize for almost each column.. @ceolter That of course works, but causes a lot of overhead, This action could be invoked a lot of times when clicking really fast, which will cause some lag. I also need it on some other places. Isn't it places. Isn't it possible to hold an index for the columns? Or is it difficult?. +1 of course, indeed the same issue as #1333 , but then I try to do it automatically.. Found the issue, see PR. @nischi I have one iiyama proLite E2208HDD with a dpi of 100 and resolution of 1980x1080, and one old samsung syncMaster 940bw with a dpi of 96 and resolution of 1440x900. So if you have a screen with a lower dpi or face issues, please provide some more info on what is happening at yours.\nAlso, please check for yourself if it makes a difference for a floating value or integer. As far as I've seen, it was always an integer during debugging.\nPerhaps take on this discussion in the PR itself.. @nischi Hmm.. well I've tried to change the container div of the grid with floating values, but this seems to have no real effect on the calculation, because it uses integer values. It eventually uses clientWidth which returns an int.\nAbout the dpi, hmm maybe, but a phone has a dpi of somewhat 300, where I don't have the issue now.\nDon't get me wrong though: It does sometimes have to recalculate the widths so that the scroll balks go away, that is just because the initial width of all columns was set higher then the space available. But it eventually can make a decision and stick to one width, so that it is not flipping constantly. Please read #1333 , which was my issue, what got fixed in my and @uvtzxpm's opinion.\nElse I would kindly advise you to debug it a bit more, look at the same lines of code where I made changes and see the outcome.. https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/issues/1386#issuecomment-272374664\nperhaps take a look at this comment, a Todo.

    "ScottTrenda": "Also, vertical and horizontal scrolling on the grid headers do nothing.\n. @ceolter: This is on a Mac, using the two-finger gesture for scrolling. You can probably just look at the deltaX/deltaY properties on the mousewheel event object, and scroll left/right or up/down based on those values.\n. For comparison, the scrolling is prevented under the same circumstances in ui-grid. UX is noticeably more consistent as a result.\n. Why not add the deltaX to scrollLeft and the deltaY to scrollTop at the same time? That way, it still responds correctly to diagonal scrolls instead of trying to pick out which scroll is more important.\n. ",

    "joekrill": "The problem is, if you're trying to build a dependency tree and decide the order in which scripts need to be loaded, you absolutely need Angular to load first. And the whole point of Bower is to manage your front-end scripts! So without specifying Angular as a dependency here, your scripts have no guarantee of loading in the correct order (if that's how you're building your dependency tree -- and that's really what it's there for in the first place!). So your app will blow up because Angular Grid was loaded before Angular was, so it was never registered as a module. \nI mean, the component is called Angular Grid, after all. The title of the site is \"A Data Grid for AngularJS\". The description of the project on Github is \"An Advanced Datagrid for AngularJS\". Clearly the target audience here is people who use this with Angular, and that fact that it just so happens to work without it seems to be more of an afterthought. So I don't quite get why it is marketed this way, but no one wants to support it in this way. But, hey, whatever.\nWiredep in particular allows a workaround for this -- so that's what I use. But it's just that --  a workaround -- the correct solution is to set Angular as a dependency in the bower.json. At the very least this should maybe be noted in the documentation somewhere that you need to add this to your bower.json if you're actually using Angular Grid with Angular (and want to use wiredep):\n\"overrides\": {\n  \"ag-grid\": {\n    \"dependencies\": {\n      \"angular\": \"*\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n@S-YOU Adding Angular as a dependency in my bower.json doesn't solve this problem, because there's no way to specify in my bower.json that Angular should be loaded first (i.e. it is a dependency of Angular Grid!). \n.

Sometimes it's just due to lack of resources on the dev's behalf, but also sometimes because the structure of the repo can not be changed just to accommodate another build tool, (see Modernizr for instance, which needs a specific build/download step).

My current setup allows the user to select the number of rows they want visible at a given time. I just need a way to get selection to stick around. I very nearly came up with a way to get selections to stick while using a datasource for filtering/sorting, but it was very dirty and very frustrating.\nI suspect, going back to your first question, that if we implement client-side pagination in the first place, where the dataset is merely a collection of row data, that selections would end up being sticky anyways.

I post it in case it could be usefull for someone : \nsortAndFilter( sortModel, filterModel ) {\n    return this.sortData( sortModel, this.filterData( filterModel, this.allOfTheData ) )\n}\n```\nsortData( sortModel, data ) {\n    let sortPresent = sortModel && sortModel.length > 0;\n    if ( !sortPresent ) {\n        return data;\n    }\n    let resultOfSort = data.slice();\nresultOfSort.sort( function( a, b ) {\n    for ( let k = 0; k < sortModel.length; k++ ) {\n    let sortColModel = sortModel[k];\n    let valueA = a[sortColModel.colId];\n    let valueB = b[sortColModel.colId];\n\n    // this filter didn't find a difference, move onto the next one\n    if ( valueA == valueB ) {\n        continue;\n    }\n\n    let sortDirection = sortColModel.sort === 'asc' ? 1 : -1;\n\n    // Excluse null values from sort\n    if ( valueA === null ) {\n        return 1;\n    }\n    if ( valueB === null ) {\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    if ( valueA > valueB ) {\n        return sortDirection;\n    } else {\n        return sortDirection * -1;\n    }\n    }\n    // no filters found a difference\n    return 0;\n});\n\nreturn resultOfSort;\n\n}\n```\n```\nfilterData( filterModel, data ) {\n    let filterPresent = filterModel && Object.keys( filterModel ).length > 0;\n    if ( !filterPresent ) {\n        return data;\n    }\nlet resultOfFilter = [];\n\nfor ( let i = 0; i < data.length; i++ ) {\n    let item = data[i];\n    let addToResult: Boolean = true;\n\n    // Loop over all filters\n    for ( let filterName in filterModel ) {\n    if ( !item[filterName] ) {\n        // si null, on exclu du filtre\n        addToResult = false;\n    } else {\n        let valueItem = item[filterName].toString(); // Get value of item\n        let valueFilter = filterModel[filterName].filter; // Get value of filter\n        let typeFilter = filterModel[filterName].type; // Get Type of filter (contains, equals, etc..)\n\n        if ( typeFilter == 'contains' ) {\n            if ( valueItem.indexOf( valueFilter.toString() ) < 0 ) {\n                addToResult = false;\n            }\n        }\n\n        if ( typeFilter == 'startsWith' ) {\n            if ( !valueItem.startsWith( valueFilter ) ) {\n                addToResult = false;\n            }\n        }\n\n        if ( typeFilter == 'endsWith' ) {\n            if ( !valueItem.endsWith( valueFilter ) ) {\n                addToResult = false;\n            }\n        }\n\n        if ( typeFilter == 'equals' ) {\n            console.log('valueItem', valueItem);\n            console.log('valueFilter', valueFilter);\n            if ( valueItem != valueFilter ) {\n                addToResult = false;\n            }\n        }\n\n        if ( typeFilter == 'notEquals' || typeFilter == 'notEqual' ) {\n            if ( valueItem == valueFilter ) {\n                addToResult = false;\n            }\n        }\n\n        if ( typeFilter == 'lessThan' ) {\n            if ( valueItem >= valueFilter ) {\n                addToResult = false;\n            }\n        }\n\n        if ( typeFilter == 'lessThanOrEqual' ) {\n            if ( valueItem > valueFilter ) {\n                addToResult = false;\n            }\n        }\n\n        if ( typeFilter == 'greaterThan' ) {\n            if ( valueItem <= valueFilter ) {\n                addToResult = false;\n            }\n        }\n\n        if ( typeFilter == 'greaterThanOrEqual' ) {\n            if ( valueItem < valueFilter ) {\n                addToResult = false;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    }\n\n    if ( addToResult ) {\n    resultOfFilter.push( item );\n    }\n}\n\nreturn resultOfFilter;\n\n}\n```\n```\ncreateNewDatasource(): void {\n    if ( !this.allOfTheData ) return;\nlet dataSource = {\n    getRows: ( params: any ) => {\n    this.sortedAndFilteredData = this.sortAndFilter( params.sortModel, params.filterModel );\n    let rowsThisPage = this.sortedAndFilteredData.slice( params.startRow, params.endRow );\n    params.successCallback( rowsThisPage, this.sortedAndFilteredData.length );\n    }\n};\n\nthis.gridOptions.api.setDatasource( dataSource );\n\n}\n```\nsetRowData( rowData ): void {\n    this.allOfTheData = rowData;\n    this.createNewDatasource();\n}.

Well, maybe this is a good opportunity to separate examples from documentation, while keeping them under your control (again, my suggestion is based in direct parallelism with @kentcdodds' angular-formly examples)\nAlso, having your examples (self-hosted, jsbins or whatever) pointing to a branch exclusively for distribution purposes is also a good practice.\nYou might find Kent's advices quite helpful, as he's gone through all that before, as an OSS library maintainer:\n- How to Write a JavaScript Library\n  - Egghead series\n- Why I don\u2019t commit generated files to master (for libraries\u2026)\nHope it helps, cheers! :smile: \n. Although projects are different in many ways, I think @ceolter can effectively skip some headaches you've been through as a maintainer, and automate some tasks in the way :smiley_cat: \n. Good luck @ceolter!\n. I found that ag-grid adds a parent object to each child node, _hence creating a circular JSON structure_.\nIf I remove the {{rowData}} binding from the HTML (jsbin.com/baliqa/3) I do get rid of the errors.\nThe issue is that in my real application I need to:\n1. show the data model (rowData) for debugging purposes\n2. process the data model (rowData) before sending it back to de backend\n   - example: CRUD operation\nAny ideas? :thought_balloon: \n. Hi @ceolter, thanks for your response.\nI dropped manual JSON conversion (I actually found this great package which deals with it)\nHowever now I get the call stack overflowed many times (in fact any time there's a $digest loop):\n\nAccording to your knowledge of ag-grid internals, does it looks like something I'm screwing up big time? Or maybe it is in fact an infinity loop bug?\nAny hint would be greatly appreciated :smile: \n. @ceolter thanks for your help! Actually I tried to replicate it in a JSBin but didn't get any errors: http://jsbin.com/baliqa/6/edit?html,js,output\nI will investigate further.\nThanks again and happy holidays! :christmas_tree: :santa: \n. Hi again @ceolter, I found a related issue with circular structures: https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/issues/397\nI'm using ag-grid in conjunction with angular-formly, therefore I was able to reproduce the issue:\nhttp://jsbin.com/baliqa/8/edit?html,js,output\nThe problem has to do with angular-formly deep watching the model\nI'm working on a fix atm :construction: :construction_worker: \n. Good news! :tada: :sparkles: \nFollowing a naming convention (dollar-sign $properties) will skip angular.equal function to compare this property. \n\n\"During a property comparison, properties of function type and properties with names that begin with $ are ignored.\" - https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/function/angular.equals\n\nI already fixed it by renaming parent to $parent (mainly around here) which seems to work well:\nhttp://jsbin.com/baliqa/9/edit?html,js,output\nI will submit a proper PR with the fix asap, I hope it will not be much trouble while you're on holidays :smile: \nThanks and kind regards!\n. Fair enough, this is an Angular issue (hence angular-formly) because of the way it does deep-watching. (BTW, my PR doesn't remove the 'parent' reference, it only renames it).\nI actually found some literature \"Deep-Watching Circular Data Structures in Angular\": http://tech.small-improvements.com/2014/06/11/deep-watching-circular-data-structures-in-angular/.\nQuite interesting, unfortunately that solution has to be tailored for every specific data structure (something impractical from a general-purpose library standpoint).\nSince angular-formly aims to be a general-purpose library it wouldn't know which properties should watch and which ones shouldn't,  Also, many other Angular libraries use deep-watching on models for different purposes.\nSince a big part of developers seeking to use ag-grid are Angular developers, I believe a simple $dollar-sign convention for circular properties is a cleaner & non-obstructive fix.\nHere's the official documentation:\n\n\"During a property comparison, properties of function type and properties with names that begin with $ are ignored.\"\nhttps://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/function/angular.equals\n\nPerhaps some feedback from a 3rd party library maintainer (like @kentcdodds :smile:) can help us on the matter?\nThanks for taking your time following this thread @ceolter !\n. As I said before (and exemplified in a jsbin), I'm using angular-formly custom templates to render an ag-grid. Angular-Formly is the one watching the model. Better explained by @kentcdodds words in this thread:\n\n... Here's the code where that happens (for reference): https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/blob/master/src/directives/formly-form.js#L114\nIn prose, angular-formly allows you to dynamically alter the properties of fields. This feature is called expressionProperties (see this egghead.io lesson for more info https://egghead.io/lessons/angularjs-angular-formly-expressionproperties?pl=advanced-angular-forms-with-angular-formly). The expressionProperties are run when any of the model properties change. This is an extremely powerful feature of angular-formly. It also normally results in fewer watches because there's a single watch per form rather than a single watch per expression property.\n\n@ceolter Anyway, thanks again for your patience, keep enjoying your holidays, I will think of alternative solutions in the meantime :smile_cat: \nCheers!\n. Fixed by: https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/pull/657\nWorking examples:\n- http://jsbin.com/baliqa/18/edit?html,js,console,output\n- http://jsbin.com/naviji/5/edit?html,js,console,output\n. @ceolter thanks mate!\n. Hi @ceolter,\nAs stated in the issue, this is trying to solve an specific angular $digest cycle issue.\nI temporarily solved it in my project by using my own fork.\nNevertheless I noted that this needs to be fixed in a more robust way\nIf you want to keep your lib 100% framework-agnostic and you think renaming a var is not worth the hazzle, then we might need to come up with a different approach to solve this.\nOtherwise i think this is a simpler workaround imho\n. @ceolter fair enough :sweat_smile:\nI will try to come up a cleaner fix later, thanks for your feedback and patience :smile: \nClosing the PR \n. @ceolter wow thanks! gonna try it asap\n. @ceolter I set suppressParentsInRowNodes: true in gridOptions but apparently parent is still added to children nodes.\nFile Browser Example: http://jsbin.com/naviji/1/edit?html,js,console,output\n*disclaimer: I'm using dist/ files from my own repository since ag-grid's is not updated\n. Absolutely, I appreciate your help! a lot :tada: \nUnfortunately I'm still getting parent references with latest release (3.1.0): http://jsbin.com/naviji/3/edit?html,js,console,output\n. I think the clue is that rowsAlreadyGrouped is set to true true ?\n. @ceolter I found the issue, gonna update my PR asap :smile: \n. new PR: https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/pull/657\n.

    "DrCool": "By the way, out of the various methods I've learned about today for line clamping, the following link was the most elegant and seems like the simplest way to do it with code.  It also achieves much better results than the CSS-only methods I've seen.\nhttp://codepen.io/Merri/pen/Dsuim\nBasically, the code will analyze the width of the text and figure out where to line-break it and creates a <span> element for each line.  The final line is actually the remainder of the text in another <span> but this span element has a CSS text-overflow: ellipsis set on it so it truncates normally.  Bada-boom... multi-line ellipsis.\nAnd for others who may read this, here's what I also learned today:  currently, non-Webkit browsers don't support ellipsis overflow on multiple lines.  It's only for single lines of text (white-space: nowrap).  Even the Webkit CSS is a bit wonky (padding screws it up).\n. When you work on this (no hurry), could you also please create a way for my code to know if the text has been truncated because it's too long?  This way, I have the option of displaying a tooltip over the cell to show all of the cell text.  Sometimes, the user needs to be able to see all the text.  We need ways of detecting when text is truncated so we can provide an alternative to the user.\nThanks!\n. I was able to hack something together using a custom CellRenderer, a subroutine to calculate text widths that I found on stackoverflow, and using the grid's onColumnResized event.\nThis plunker shows a grid with a column of text that is too long to be displayed.  By default, the code will render two lines of text and the last line will be truncated with ellipses.  You can easily specify how many lines of text to display in each cell.\nYou can resize the column and see the text word-breaking and adjusting on the fly.\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/YjsTu330aA7t6UdOV6NV?p=preview\nI hope this helps someone else!\n. Hi Abu.  What you need to use is a custom cellRenderer function. In that function, you will check the \"isBold\" field to see if the current cell should be bold or not.  The params sent to each cell includes the row's data so it's easy for a cell in a row to check a value in another cell of the same row.\nYou can hide a field using the attribute \"hide: false\" in the columnDefs object. However, it would be better if you just checked the value of a JSON object instead of using a hidden field for this purpose.\nHere's a plunker showing the code working as you described:\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/MfmUPwFJAgdj8goOAHcW?p=preview\n. You're going to want to work with the grid's events: http://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-events/index.php\nYou'll also want to read about selections: http://www.ag-grid.com/angular-grid-selection/index.php  For example, look at api.getSelectedRows()\nI think you'll need to use the onSelectionChanged event in your gridOptions object.  The grid will send a parameter containing the currently selected rows (I think... I haven't tried it).\nI don't know how to limit the selection to only two rows.  If this were my project, I would look into the two pages I linked to above to get started, then maybe I would need to track how many rows are currently selected.  If the user clicks on another row to select it (I'd check the onRowClick event), then I might see how to override the user's selection of a third row by defining the selection as the first two selected rows the user made.\n. You'll need to write your own export function but that's not too difficult to do.  There are a lot of table and JSON export-to-Excel functions out there you can copy/paste.  You'll need to get exportable data using this ag-grid api call: getDataAsCsv(params).  To know what params you can use, check the export page here: http://www.ag-grid.com/angular-grid-export/index.php\nNow, you'll need to create an HTML table with the data but include your styles inline for each table cell <td>.  For example, you may have a row that looks like this:\n<tr>\n    <td style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #FF0000\">($1,592)</td>\n    <td style=\"background-color: #F0F0F0\">Some text</td>\n</tr>\nMore info on CSS styles when exporting to Excel:\nhttps://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=preserve+css+styling+export+to+excel\nSee here for three specific rules to keep in mind when defining styles to export to Excel:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/18467418/retain-html-table-styling-after-exporting-to-excel-using-javascript-jquery\n.

Closing issue for now as we can't reproduce it.. Hi,\nThis is not how we expect users to interact with the cellRenderer, i.e. to invoke the context menu.\nIt might be valid to add an API call to invoke the context menu for any cell but we are not convinced of the utility of this.\nThanks anyway and we'll consider in the future but at this point it would be disingenuous to raise a jira for a feature we're not likely to implement..

Closing as this issue has now been fixed. Thanks.. Closing as this issue has now been fixed. Thanks.. This has been fixed in latest branch. When we do our next release it will appear in master. Thanks.. I did some profiling and didn't observe any speed up.\nNote that rowsToRemove is typically only has around 50 items, due to row virtualization, so this optimization is unlikely to make a difference over the native for loop.\nClosing as a result.\nThanks.. Closing this as you should set the data type of the column, see: \nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-excel/#excel-style-definition.

This was actually fixed in v18.1. Thanks..

    "bmwalter68": "I've noticed this as well.  I tried the webkit proprietary overflow CSS mentioned above and noticed some side effects which are magnified by grids with pinned columns...

This puts the pinned and unpinned content out of sync for a potentially long time.\n. ",
    "jaydunning": "Significant response time improvement in iOS, Safari, and IE can be achieved by replacing the setTimeout in GridPanel.requestDrawVirtualRows with a debounced requestAnimationFrame, as described at http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/animations/. This mostly eliminates the blank screen waiting for the grid to repaint after an aggressive cursor scroll. It improves, but does not eliminate, pinned column lag on iOS and IE.\n-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch is still required for scrolling responsiveness on iOS.\nDoesn't seem to help much on Android, but doesn't seem to hurt it either.\nExample implementation (JS):\njavascript\nif ( useScrollLag ) {\n    if ( ! this._ticking ) {\n        this._ticking = true;\n        requestAnimationFrame(function() {\n            _this.rowRenderer.drawVirtualRows();\n            _this._ticking = false;\n        });\n    }\n}\n. Further response time improvement can be achieved by restructuring GridPanel.addScrollListener to minimize layout and rendering events by minimizing interleaving of DOM reads and writes. The following is much improved on iOS Safari, though still not fast enough for UIWebView or Android. The improvement can be visualized by comparing Chrome or Safari Timeline charts. (Note GridPanel.requestDrawVirtualRows is removed and incorporated into GridPanel.addScrollListener for convenience.)\n``` javascript\nGridPanel.prototype.addScrollListener = function () {\n    var _this = this;\n    // if printing, then no scrolling, so no point in listening for scroll events\n    if (this.forPrint) {\n        return;\n    }\n    function onScroll() {\n        // we are always interested in horizontal scrolls of the body\n        var newLeftPosition = _this.eBodyViewport.scrollLeft;\n    // if we are pinning to the right, then it's the right pinned container\n    // that has the scroll.\n    if (!_this.columnModel.isPinningRight()) {\n        var newTopPosition = _this.eBodyViewport.scrollTop;\n        if (newTopPosition !== _this.lastTopPosition) {\n            _this.rowRenderer.drawVirtualRows();\n            _this.lastTopPosition = newTopPosition;\n            _this.verticallyScrollLeftPinned(newTopPosition);\n        }\n    }\n    if (newLeftPosition !== _this.lastLeftPosition) {\n        _this.lastLeftPosition = newLeftPosition;\n        _this.horizontallyScrollHeaderCenterAndFloatingCenter(newLeftPosition);\n        _this.masterSlaveService.fireHorizontalScrollEvent(newLeftPosition);\n    }\n};\n\n// if we are in IE or Safari, then we only redraw if there was no scroll event\n// in the 50ms following this scroll event. without this, these browsers have\n// a bad scrolling feel, where the redraws clog the scroll experience\n// (makes the scroll clunky and sticky). this method is like throttling\n// the scroll events.\nvar useScrollLag;\n// let the user override scroll lag option\nif (this.gridOptionsWrapper.isSuppressScrollLag()) {\n    useScrollLag = false;\n}\nelse if (this.gridOptionsWrapper.getIsScrollLag()) {\n    useScrollLag = this.gridOptionsWrapper.getIsScrollLag()();\n}\nelse {\n    useScrollLag = _.isBrowserIE() || _.isBrowserSafari();\n}\n\nfunction debounce(f) {\n    var _this = this;\n    if ( ! this._ticking ) {\n        this._ticking = true;\n        requestAnimationFrame(function() {\n            f();\n            _this._ticking = false;\n        });\n    }\n}\n\nthis.eBodyViewport.addEventListener('scroll', useScrollLag ? debounce.bind(null, onScroll) : onScroll);\n\nfunction onPinnedRightScroll() {\n    var newTopPosition = _this.ePinnedRightColsViewport.scrollTop;\n    if (newTopPosition !== _this.lastTopPosition) {\n        _this.lastTopPosition = newTopPosition;\n        _this.verticallyScrollLeftPinned(newTopPosition);\n        _this.verticallyScrollBody(newTopPosition);\n        _this.rowRenderer.drawVirtualRows();\n    }\n}\nthis.ePinnedRightColsViewport.addEventListener('scroll', useScrollLag ? debounce.bind(null, onPinnedRightScroll) : onPinnedRightScroll);\n\n// this means the pinned panel was moved, which can only\n// happen when the user is navigating in the pinned container\n// as the pinned col should never scroll. so we rollback\n// the scroll on the pinned.\nthis.ePinnedLeftColsViewport.addEventListener('scroll', function () {\n    _this.ePinnedLeftColsViewport.scrollTop = 0;\n});\n\n};\n```\n. 5.1.7 is 4 years old. Safari no longer supports Windows.\n. Considering the title of this issue, you would actually need both a Mac and an iPad. But...\nThe only browser-specific change is the introduction of rAF, which can be polyfilled with setTimeout(f, 0). I haven't tested this change with such a polyfill to see whether it would have the same effect, but it would at least prevent errors in older browsers.\nFor your testing, IE (to experience the performance improvement) and Chrome (to visualize it using the Timeline chart) should be sufficient. (And, since you already have Safari installed, you might as well test there too to see whether the polyfill works.) Then publish a release and request feedback. I, and I'm sure others, would be happy to test it to see if it improves this issue.\n. My test case is simply the Employee Skills demo. I didn't have time to figure out how to run January's demo with today's build or today's demo with January's build, so I ran two parallel tests.\nThere is a noticeable performance improvement on Mac Safari, but not on iOS or IE (at least on my workstation). On IE, when I click and hold the scroll arrow, I end up with a blank canvas as soon as the buffer is exhausted. In my testing on IE with v3.0.0 and the changes proposed above, I had to scroll aggressively to get any empty rows.\nThe bottleneck may now be elsewhere. I tried dropping the addScrollListener function above into the current version, but there was no noticeable improvement.\nOn iOS, the changes I tested in January now seem to be running a lot slower than I remember (though still a little faster than 3.0.0). I've applied several iOS updates since January, including from 8 to 9, so that may be a factor.\n. ",

    "maraisr": "@ceolter Cheers mate for getting back to me so promptly! After some time I managed to solve the issue I was having, simply by sorting the array of data before I was to hand if off to agGrid. \nI guess what I was trying to get at is, the grouped data, wasnt \"grouping\" them all at once, so you'd have group A, with 5 rows on page 1, then 5 rows of group B on page 1, then 5 rows of Group A on page, rather than have all Group A rows on page 1.. Hope that makes sense..\nBut when I sorted the array of data, and then apply the grouping, it'll have worked, because all the rows of Group A were together.\nAlso thank you so much for exposing the prototypes of the Grid, I was able to implement, dropdown \"dynamic\" combos on the keyboard navigation events. So the focus of a cell, Id inject a \"custom\" dropdown,pre populated with its \"selected\" item, and then a keyboard navigation out. All native (no angular). All still using the ValueGetter. \nLoved the Datasource idea, I was able to assign that to a closure, to run my API endpoint and do sorting locally... Returning 10,000 records from the DB, and then page locally with JavaScript slicing. I use a custom cascade combo filtering mechanism, so I couldn't use your filter model. But all in all, love this project!\nOne feature I'd love is a \"blank\" first or last row, that you can populate with data, and then that'll in essence run an INSERT statement to the DB. \nTL:DR; Issue solved, love the grid! xD\n. Is there a way of making it work? Potentially a \"hacky\" way? Like i've already got the custom keydown event listeners capturing the tab key (9) and firing the navigateToNextCell with keycode 37 (or whatever the arrow keycodes are).. \nIs there maybe an api to get the eGridCell passing in a colId, and rowIndex? To manually focusing it, and running the \"move to next cell\" logic myself? \n. I'm not so much worried about mixing navigation between normal rows, and floating rows.. Just between cells in floating rows, and normal rows independently.\nNot asking to add this feature into your codebase! haha you do alot for the community already! Just wondering if there was a way to achieve this using the current pipes.\nOh and sorry about turning this more into a \"how can i do this\" rather an actually an issue.. Im happy to jump to the forum if need be?\n. No worries mate! Didn't expect you to either!

    "gabrielenosso": "the method  api.sizeColumnsToFit() works fine.\nBut why isn't there a property on the grid to automatically use it on the initialization and also on window resize?\nCouldn't it be helpful so that the table will be always of the parent size?\n. Moreover, when I resize the window, if I expand it the grid is resized, but if I shrink the window it doesn't resize and the window horizontal scrollbar appears.\n. Could it be that it happens cause I'm using flexbox to regulate the parent's div size?\nMoreover... should it get also the parent div height?\n. I have still problems with the width responsiveness.\nThis time with animations as CSS transactions.\nWhat I do in my project it just animating the \"left\" and \"right\" properties of a container, in which there is the grid.\nNow the point is that the event\"gridSizeChanged\" is fired only at the begin of the animation.\nThe strange thing, though, is that the width of the grid is updated correctly following the width of its parent (even though it generates a little bit of lag due to the fact that it tries to resize more times during the animation).\n. It's not great, but I tried to attach a video:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B74fwRpri-2vWlRQYUpPd2pZMGM/view\nWhen I click on the Filter button to hide the filters column, the \"gridSizeChanged\" event is fired only at the begin of the animation (when I click the button), but not at the end. The strange thing is that the grid size is meanwhile updated correctly (as you can see the border of the headers fits the whole container)\n. .\n. I don't know if it makes any difference, but I'm using the ag-grid-react-component (but I don't think it's the problem)\n. It's internal (sorry! :S)\n. The width of the grid is updated thanks to the periodicallyDoLayout() method\n(https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/blob/master/src/ts/gridCore.ts#L192) which continually runs.\nIt invokes the doLayout() method (https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/blob/master/src/ts/gridCore.ts#L258)\nwhich should check if the size is changed.\nIn case it is changed, it redraws the rows and dispatch the EVENT_GRID_SIZE_CHANGED.\nIs it right?\nIf it is right, the strange thing is: why the headers of the table are updated but the vent is not fired? \n. Update: trying to debugging it, I found out that the EVENT_GRID_SIZE_CHANGED isn't fired at all when the grid is enlarging (before I said that it was fired when the animation started, but it isn't true. It was another handler...)\n. Just to try to help, this is a video with the console. I'm logging every time the gridSizeChanged event is fired.\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B74fwRpri-2vcUVqVktvRWQzb0U/view\n. Maybe I found the problem:\nthe method layoutWidth() doesn't return anything (https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/blob/master/src/ts/layout/borderLayout.ts#L235).\nIt should return true or false, checking if the width is changed! (Like the method layoutHeight() )\nas you can see here: https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/blob/master/src/ts/layout/borderLayout.ts#L160\nIndeed this is the method to check if the size of the grid is changed!\n. If the option would be set, it should update the cols width when:\n- grid gets a new size\n- columns are resized\n- columns are shown/hidden (onColumnVisible)\n- columns pivot are added or removed (onColumnPivotChanged)\n- the tool panel is shown/hidden\n. Is it merged in the current version?\nIt doesn't seem to work yet.\nAnd also: is the \"gridSizeChanged\" event invoked also after the first rendering?\n. +1 for flexbox compatibility!\n. Will the commit be merged anytime?\n. I searched for \"suppressMovableColumns\" in the code (documented on ag-grid website), but I couldn't find anything that uses it. Am I drunk? :)\n. About the #2, could there be a possibility to mantain the size of the resized column? (as the method resizes all the columns)\n. Also: onColumnRowGroupChanged, the event object passed in the method doesn't have any reference to the current grouping state.\nShouldn't it have it, so that the code could, for instance, sort the data by that column?\n. Is there also a way to change the checkboxes for row groups then?\n. ",

Unfortunately this does not appear to be working as intended.\nI have a button which sets the grid to predefined states (groupings, aggregations, etc).

Also since values are currency, is there anyway to apply a formatter function to the aggregate like there are forcellRendererandfilterCellRenderer?

I think the closest page that had replaced javascript-grid-insert-remove/index.php page is this one nowdays https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-accessing-data/#for-each-node\nOne can iterate through the rows to obtain the data from RowNode collection. @darge98 @AngeiMachi you can use existing onCellMouseOut and onCellMouseOver events as of today and set 'hovered` property on Row Node object\n```\n          onCellMouseOver={d => this.onCellMouseOver(d)}\n          onCellMouseOut={d => this.onCellMouseOut(d)}\n...\nonCellMouseOver(d) {\n    // eslint-disable-next-line no-param-reassign\n    d.node.hovered = true\n    this.gridApi.refreshCells({ force: true })\n  }\nonCellMouseOut(d) {\n    // eslint-disable-next-line no-param-reassign\n    d.node.hovered = false\n    this.gridApi.refreshCells({ force: true })\n  }\n``\nLater in your cell renderer you can read Row Node 'hovered value \n. From my testing I conclude that this particular error with ag-grid happens only if babel-polyfill https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill/#usage-in-browser is loaded in the IE browser together with ag-grid. https://jsfiddle.net/Jabbypanda/ea4angwm/3/show/ here is example of the issue originally reported, try to open this page in IE11\nThis JSFiddle loads just load ag-grid 17.1 and babel-polyfil 6.26 from CDN and runtime JS exception occurs. what is also important to mention is that babel-polyfill library has to be loaded AFTER ag-grid to reproduce this issue\n\nIf this library is loaded BEFORE ag-grid module, then the error mentioned in original bug report does not occur.

Also I'm not sure if that's the case for projects which are already matured. You get built-in docs with samples and a \"build-for-all-targets\" infrastructure, but ag-grid already has that. \n. Well, we share the same view on a wrapper class then. \ud83d\ude03 \nI could imagine making the column configuration and callbacks more declarative instead of doing that in JS.\n. Just to clarify this: It works as a web-component (spec-wise). So yes, this is a DOM object but at the same time more than that.\n. @don-bluelinegrid \nThe ag-grid documentation suggests using webcomponents.js as a polyfill here.\nBut the docs also state:\n\nThe examples on this page have been tested to work with latest versions of Chrome and Firefox on Windows. They failed using IE 11 and Safari on Windows.\n\nWhile Polymer, another framework making extensive use of web-components, also uses webcomponents.js and shows all \"evergreen\" browsers (including Safari) to be supported:\nhttps://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/browsers\nI've never run ag-grid outside of Chrome and I'm using MutationObserver polyfill from webcomponents.js (not the complete package).\n.

I've done something similar for a tree-view.\n. Oh, I didn't see this. Great! \ud83d\udc4d \nI'd be interested in these \"kinks\" btw. but I guess that would hijack this issue.. \ud83d\ude03 \n.

    "don-bluelinegrid": "I am looking at using agGrid in a new commercial project.  This project is to be built with Aurelia framework.\nI've looked through this discussion, and the various stop-gap solutions proposed.\n@Thanood @jadhavajay \nYou've provided very rough examples of \"wrapping\" the agGrid module in an Aurelia class.  Am I correct in assuming that in order to use all of the full functionality of the agGrid (like filtering, virtual scrolling, etc.), every function/callback would need to be wrapped in the Aurelia wrapper class?  Isn't this essentially then like building an aurelia-ui-toolkit bridge implementation?\n@ceolter \nHave you looked at the aurelia-ui-toolkit bridge project, and the sample implementation and docs?  (https://aurelia-ui-toolkits.gitbooks.io/kendoui-bridge-architecture/content/)  I would imagine this would get you very close to providing Aurelia compatibility, without having to start from scratch.\nDon\n. > But I'm not sure if the resulting view model is really a wrapper class. It can be used like a custom element anyway. I don't see the need for a wrapper class. Would you mind to elaborate on that thought?\nFrom my perspective, a \"wrapper class\" is a class that interfaces with, or \"wraps\", some other component/module which would otherwise not be easily usable - like a facade.  The thought behind a wrapper class to interface with the agGrid module, is that if we have a large application where we are likely to use multiple/many instances of the grid, we'd like to have a generic interface for creating and interacting with the instances - we would not want to have logic like this in each view-model.\n\nYou get built-in docs with samples and a \"build-for-all-targets\" infrastructure, but ag-grid already has that.\n\nActually, the reason for this thread is that agGrid is not available for all targets - specifically not for WebPack or Aurelia.\n. @Thanood \nI've spent some time, and have gotten this working reasonably well in Aurelia (from a proof-of-concept perspective), with remote data calls and virtual paging.\nI noticed your comment above (https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/issues/690#issuecomment-248138622):\n\nIt seems you can call ag-grid functions from Aurelia's ref pointer.\nIn my gist above this is used for initialization: this.myGrid.setGridOptions(this.gridOptions);\n\nWhen I do what your Gist shows, and I examine the ref variable in the view-model class, the variable appears to be a DOM Element object, not an ag-grid instance.  So, there would be no 'setGridOptions()' function there.\nMy html template:\n<ag-grid id=\"eGridDiv\" ref=\"cmtyMembersGrid\" class=\"ag-blue\" style=\"position: absolute;top: 90px;bottom: 50px;width: 100%;\" columns.bind=\"gridColumns\" rows.bind=\"selectedCommunityMembers\" pagesize.bind=\"pageSize\"></ag-grid>\nMy view-model:\n```\n  cmtyMembersGrid: any;\n...\nattached{\n    this.cmtyMembersGrid.setGridOptions(this.gridOptions);\n}\n```\nIn the screen shot, you can see that the resulting bound ref variable holds a DOM Element, and not a grid instance object.  Have I missed something?\nDon\n\n. @Thanood \nPlease ignore last comment.\nI see that in the debugger it displays the Element content, but the ref is to an object with a setOptions function available.\nThis approach does work well, much better than explicitly calling createGrid().\nDon\n. @Thanood \nDaniel -\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/issues/690#issuecomment-197348937\nYou said:\n\nI found that the web components version works like a charm \n\nI am using the web-components version, and it does seem to work fine - in the Chrome browser.  It is not working at all in Firefox or Safari, presumably because of a lack of web-component support in those browsers.\nCan you share anything about your experience with this, and share any code about how to conditionally polyfill for web-components support?\nThanks,\nDon\n. @ceolter \nNiall,\nCan you provide an example or a bit more explanation, on how to \"make it your own\"?  I'm assuming that you mean we can plug in an instance of a filter that matches a particular interface.\nThanks,\nDon\n. Got it, perfect.\nThank you,\nDon\n. @ceolter \nNiall -\nI read through this issue, and understand about how to replace the image icons for checkboxes.\nHowever, my question is a bit different.  It's about why these must be images.  If my application is using a specific styling throughout the application, including for checkboxes, how can I apply that same styling to the row checkboxes?  As a specific example, I am using Bootstrap's styled checkboxes, which are actually complex DOM elements that associate a hidden checkbox input element with a styled label element.  I imagine that many developers use the Bootstrap checkboxes.\nHowever, with the current icon-based approach, it doesn't look like there's a straightforward way to do this.  Of course, I could take a screenshot of the Bootstrap-styled checkboxes in the various states, and then use those images to replace the default icons; but that defeats the purpose of Bootstrap and CSS - if I later decide to modify the Bootstrap styles, I must then create new icons.\nCan you provide any straightforward way of applying the Bootstrap checkboxes and behaviors to the row checkboxes in agGrid?\nThanks,\nDon\n. Niall -\nI understand to some extent about the flexibility of images for checkboxes; however, there are a number of downsides that you probably already considered: impossibility of styling with CSS; requirement to have images representing three states (checked, unchecked, disabled); requirement to load the images per row.\nRegarding the last one - I've also noticed that when the grid loads row data, I see many many loading requests for the checkbox image, with a URL like this:\ndata:image/png;base64,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\nSee attachment, for the full example.  I realize that these images would most likely load from the browser cache, but I have to believe that it would be more efficient to have a DOM-based checkbox element compared to this.\nIs the only option to achieve the currently, to create some sort of custom row cell renderer which would put the HTML checkbox into the column cell?\nThanks,\nDon\n\n. Yes, got it.\nI found a few other examples as well, and have this working well now.\nthanks,\nDon\n. Also, I am seeing this while scrolling through the grid using a mouse wheel (Mac touch scrolling):\nHandling of 'mousewheel' input event was delayed for 197 ms due to main thread being busy. Consider marking event handler as 'passive' to make the page more responive.\n. @ceolter \nNiall -\nAny thoughts on this one?\nThis is in the virtual scrolling, and it causes a user experience that looks like a loop/cycle of queued events, and the user doesn't know what's happening or why the grid rows are empty.\nThanks,\nDon\n. @ceolter \nNiall,\nThank for the response.\nIn the meantime since filing the issue, I had actually already added maxPagesInCache: 2.  With this though, it helps, but I still see three requests being made at the end of scrolling - not just two.  That may be something to take a look at also.\nGood luck with your events!\nDon\n. @aurhe @ceolter \nThis sounds similar to the issue I reported recently?\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/issues/1151\nDon\n. @ceolter \nThanks, Niall.  I had ended up using the example filter in the documentation as a starting point, and have created a custom filter, and have integrated the npm debounce module into the filter input change.\nThanks,\nDon\n. @ceolter \nFollow-up:\nI've also tried adding a call to reset the datasource, like this -\ngridOptions.api.setFilterModel(null);\ngridOptions.api.setDatasource(gridOptions.datasource);\ngridOptions.api.onFilterChange();\nThis initially seemed to working, but actually is not working.  It does seem to reset the filters so that all of the data is returned to the grid; but then subsequently trying to filter the grid does not work - typing into the filter doesn't seem to trigger the grid filtering, after the datasource has been replaced.\nDon\n. Also, for reference -\nI had previously included this section in our webpack build file, based on the documentation for nib:\nmodule: {\n      loaders: loaders\n  },\n  stylus: {\n    // preferPathResolver: 'webpack',\n    use: [require('nib')()],\n    import: ['~nib/lib/nib/index.styl']\n  }. @ceolter \nNiall,\nI've tried with latest release 7.2.2, and I don't see any difference in behavior.  I have a Grid instantiated inside an Aurelia dialog.  When I filter the grid, and catch the onAfterFilterChanged event, it shows very unusual behavior (same in 7.1.X); the original reference to the gridOptions.api.filterManager shows no filters applied, but the this gridOptions object inside the event handler does show a filter applied.\nYou can see this in the attached screen shots: one shows the actual grid in the filtered state with the original reference showing no filters; the other shows the `this' object in the event handler that does show filters applied.\nDo you have any further thoughts on this?\nThanks,\nDon\n\n\n. @ceolter \nNiall,\nI had been waiting for the 'selectAll' feature being applicable to virtual/pagination cases of the grid, so was pleased to see this resolved.\nHowever, I'm trying to use this (using v 11.0.0), with the ag-aurelia, and I can never see the column header checkbox appearing - it is always rendered with the ag-hidden CSS class applied.\nHere is the colDef from my ag-aurelia template:\n```\n        \n```\nIs there anything obvious here that would cause the header checkbox to not be set to visible?  It seems like I'm doing the equivalent of what's shown in the doc examples.\nThanks,\nDon. @ceolter \nI've also tried setting this config option in JavaScript, like so, but also seems to have no effect; the header checkbox is not visible:\n```\n  onGridReady(event, scope) {\n    event.api.gridOptionsWrapper.gridOptions.onViewportChanged = function() {\n      event.api && event.api.sizeColumnsToFit();\n    };\n    event.api.gridOptionsWrapper.gridOptions.onGridSizeChanged = function(){\n      event.api && event.api.sizeColumnsToFit();\n    };\nlet selCol = event.api.columnController.getColumn('checkbox-col', event.api.columnController.gridColumns);\nlet selColDef = selCol.colDef;\nselColDef.headerCheckboxSelection = true;\nselColDef.headerCheckboxSelectionFilteredOnly = true;\n\n}\n```. @ceolter \n\nfixed, will be in next release. and yes, both variations are fixed.\n\nNiall, could you give some explanation of how this can work for the remote/server paging scenario?\nI don't see any explanation of this here in the \"Header Checkbox Selection\" section: https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-selection/#gsc.tab=0  And, there's no reference to this actually working with infinite/virtual row models anywhere in the docs.\nAnd, the idea of a 'select all' checkbox being able to select all rows in an infinite/virtual paging scenario seems to be in contradiction to the concept of infinite/virtual paging, where all rows are not known to the grid.\nI have a use case for this, and am not able to make progress and get it working; here is the use case:\nLet us assume a data source with a total of 250 rows, and a grid set up with a block size of 50.\n1. A grid is displayed, in infinite/virtual scrolling mode; initially 50 rows are loaded.\n2. The user clicks a 'select all' checkbox.\n3. The user clicks an application action button, for example Send notification to selected users.\n4. The application then calls grid.getSelectedRows() to get the selected row references.\n5. The array of selected rows is then used as data in an AJAX request sent to the server API.\nThe assumption in number 4 above is that the selectedRows array will contain all of the 250 rows that would be available from the server.  However, I'm not clear how this is possible, to get actual row references, in an infinite scrolling scenario where only 50 rows have been loaded.  The only way I could see this being possible would be if the select all header checkbox triggered a call to getRows() with start-row: 0 and end-row: 250, and set the result into the selection-manager framework without setting the data into the grid rows.\nCan you please confirm how this is working?  I'm hesitant to spend more time investigated on this, without knowing that it is intended/designed to work.\nThanks,\nDon. Also, after implementing a header checkbox through an alternate mechanism and calling grid.api.selectAll(), I'm seeing this error, which makes it appear that select all isn't supported in a non-InMemory row model:\nUncaught selectAll only available with normal row model, ie not infinite. @seanlandsman \nSean,\nOK, I converted this piece of implementation over to use the declarative style with the Aurelia plugin, and it works fairly well.  I have run into one issue though.\nAgain, my goal was to use a custom renderer template in a cell.  The template looks like this:\n```\n        \n\n \n\n\n```\nWhat's interesting, and the issue, is that the if.bind is being correctly evaluated and exectued; but the click.delegate is not working correctly.  The function editConnectionRequest() exists in the ViewModel (controller) but when I click the element I see this error in the console:\nUncaught Error: editConnectionRequest is not a function\n    at getFunction (aurelia-binding.js:1924)\n    at CallScope.evaluate (aurelia-binding.js:1527)\n    at Listener.callSource (aurelia-binding.js:5064)\n    at aurelia-binding.js:5088\n    at HTMLDocument.handleDelegatedEvent (aurelia-binding.js:3232)\nDo you have any explanation or advice for this?\nThis is my key use case - provide a custom cell template with clickable icons, whose click event is delegated to an Aurelia ViewModel function.\nThanks,\nDon. @seanlandsman \nThanks for the update.\nAfter investigating more on my side, I have some more information.  I was basically reporting two problems above:\n1. Setting a large pageSize value, greater than the total resultset size, seemed to have unexpected results and continued to make data requests.\n\nSetting certain pageSize values seemed to cause the grid to go into a loop of repeated requests.\n\nIssue 1. was due to developer error.  I was in the midst of a major application refactor, and it turned out that the pageSize value was not being bound as I thought to the Grid element.  Once I resolved that, I did see the expected behavior.\nFor Issue 2., that seems to be a definite problem, and has been reported previously as I noted above.  Essentially, since my binding wasn't working, the Grid was using its default, which seems to be pageSize: 100, and with that the Grid was going into an infinite loop of making requests with pageSize of 100 and startIndex incrementing by 100, as documented in my screen shot.\nThanks,\nDon. @seanlandsman \nSean,\nThanks for the response.\nI am trying to get something implemented, so can you provide me with some working alternative, since it seems both QuickFilter and ExternalFilter aren't working with grouped/fullWidth rows?\nWhat I am trying to achieve visually is shown in the attachment.  It is a simple case of showing some of a record's data fields in a second \"sub-row\".\n\nThe two specific problems I've run into are:\n\n\nFor the ExternalFilter, it seems that the callback doesExternalFilterPass(node) is being called with the child node.  This is actually fine, because we can get to the parent's data through the \nchild.  But, as you can see in this screen shot, the parent DOM nodes for the non-matching records are still being displayed in the grid:\n\n\n\nFor QuickFilter, this does not seem to be working at all in grouped/fullWidth mode.  When I enter text into the filter box, I am seeing the child fullWidth rows disappear and the parent rows remain, but it seems unrelated to the filter text that was entered.  See this screen shot:\n\n\n\nI think my use case is quite simple compared to some of the examples, and in the spectrum of what's possible - so I was wondering if you have any ideas on alternative ways to achieve this that may already be supported?\nThanks,\nDon\n. @seanlandsman \nSean,\nIs there a place I can look to see the priority/status of AG-416?\nAlso, is there any alternative approach you can provide, according to the reply/question above?\nThis is a major blocker for us, because it took some work to get the fullWidth/child row implementation working, and now we are finding we can't implement the ExternalFilter/QuickFilter with this that we require.\nThanks,\nDon. @seanlandsman \nHi Sean,\nThanks, that would be much appreciated.  Please let me know if you have something for me to look at.\nRegards,\nDon. @seanlandsman \nAlso, FYI, this is the example that I used as a model:\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-full-width-rows/?framework=aurelia#gsc.tab=0\n. @seanlandsman \nSean, some more info on this -\nI took the fullWidth example from the docs link above, and created a plunkr with it:\nhttps://plnkr.co/edit/i3FpDqMdbHVT5EAja0aK?p=preview\nI have not made any changes to the example code.  In this example, the column filters are enabled, but they do not work.  I beileve that this is also related to the grouping/fullWidth functionality; I have the same issue in my application for the grid that I'm trying to make work with fullWidth.  This seems like a fairly high-priority issue, since it looks like no type of filtering is working once fullWidth/grouped is enabled.\nThanks,\nDon\n. @seanlandsman \nHi Sean,\nThanks for looking into this.  Sorry, I may have confused things by using the plunkr and not being specific enough.\nTo take a step back and clarify - \nWhat I am trying to accomplish specifically is to implement ExternalFilter and QuickFilter in a fullWidth layout as shown in this comment: https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/issues/1599#issuecomment-295321920\nThe issue that I'm seeing is that neither the ExternalFilter or QuickFilter are working with the fullWidth layout, and I've been wholly unsuccessful at getting this to work; if I can't make this work, then I can't use the fullWidth layout.\nThere are two reasons I provided the plunkr:\n1. I also noticed that the standard column filters are not working in my implementation of the fullWidth layout; I noticed the same thing in the plunkr.\n2. The fullWidth example in the plunkr is the same example that I based my implementation on.  If you can show me how to make ExternalFilter and QuickFilter work in the plunkr, that would be helpful.\nTo answer your question about the plunkr, here is what I did and what I expected:\n1. Load the plunkr.\n2. Click the column filter on column C.\n3. Click the middle filter icon.\n4. Type \"floa\".\n5. I expect that only rows that contain \"floa\" in column C should be visible; what I see is that no filtering occurs.\nThe reason I mention this is that it seems likely to be related to the problems with ExternalFilter and QuickFilter in fullWidth layout.\nWhat I am trying to do is this:\nReferring to the screen shot in the linked comment above -\n1. I have an ExternalFilter that contains values that may appear in the second (child) row of the fullWidth layout.  I implemented the ExternalFilter callbacks. This is not working.  I provided the implementation code as well.\n2. I have a QuickFilter that should match any text in any field of the row.  This is also not working.  It is also not clear to me how I would enable searching on field data that's used in a template in the child row, when there are no columnDefinitions for that data.\nPlease let me know if you need any further clarification, and thanks again for looking into this.\nDon. @seanlandsman \nHi Sean,\nI'm just checking in to see if you had any success reproducing the issue I described, and if you had any suggestions for alternative approaches that may work.\nThanks,\nDon\n. @seanlandsman \nA couple of comments -\nFirst, I think we need to agree on terminology, because the root issue I'm experiencing is not specifically about fullWidth.  To clarify my use case, I am trying to create a row layout similar to an email client message list, like we'd see in Outlook or Apple Mail; each row has a parent and child row.\nrow 1: ----------------------------------------\n          |    From    |    To       |             Date           |\n          ----------------------------------------\n         |   Message\nrow 2: ----------------------------------------\n          |    From    |    To       |             Date           |\n          ----------------------------------------\n         |   Message\n          ----------------------------------------\nThe critical aspects here are:\n1. The two parent/child sub-rows should be treated as a single row unit.\n2. The data in the child row will be derived from the params.data, and not from a col def.\nThe challenges I've found with this are related to filtering:\n\n\nThis layout is most closely related to the Master-Detail example.  In that example, the lower child row is generated by a renderer template.  From what I've seen, QuickFilter is driven by the fields defined in the column definitions.  But, the data displayed in the child row is derived from the row node data, and those data fields would not be present in the column definition.  So, it seems that by design, the data in the child row cannot participate in QuickFilter.  I suspect there may be some way to force that data into the QuickFilter string, but I haven't found that.\n\n\nThe issue 1 above could theoretically be addressed by including all of the required data into the column defs, and then hiding the columns that are not desired to be visible in the main parent row.  However, I've tried this, and the hide attribute in the Aurelia column defs isn't working for me.\n\n\nFor the master row columns, whose data is derived from the column def fields, these should be able to participate in the QuickFilter.  However, when I try this, I see strange results, where rows that should have been filtered out/hidden are still visible - it looks like the child rows and parent rows are not handled the same way for hiding.\n\n\nI am also trying to use an External Filter, to use a drop-down list to filter specific states of rows (Read, Unread, etc.).  This suffers from the same issue in 1 above - if the data fields aren't defined in the col defs, then the filter framework isn't able to filter on the values.\n\n\nI hope that this helps to clarify the specific issue that I'm focused on resolving.\nRegarding reproduction, I have been trying to create a case for you.  It should be possible in plunkr, because the Aurelia framework is not a contributing factor here.  However, it is taking substantial time to try to modify the master-detail example to illustrate my use case.  I will continue to work on this, but if you understand the issue better with the explanation above, please let me know if you'd be able to progress on it.\nPlease check the plunkr again - I've completely removed any references to floating rows.  There are now only columns, or fullwidth rows.  I've also updated it to add a quickfilter.\nThanks,\nDon\n. @seanlandsman \nHi Sean,\nThanks for the update.\nWe are in a product release cycle where we now have about 2 weeks to reach a development-complete state and lock the development for that release.  This quick/external filtering on parent/child row functionality is a quite critical piece of the use case we're delivering for that release.  So, I am at a point where I need to get some sense of the likelihood of resolving the filtering issue I'm seeing, to determine whether it will be possible to resolve functionally within these two weeks, or if I need to investigate an alternative plan and un-do this work.\nDo you think there will be anything that you may be able to provide in the next couple of days to assist with this?\nCheers,\nDon\n. @ceolter \nHi Niall,\nThanks very much for getting back to me.\nAll of the points make sense.  I did understand your point #1, which is a key point.  I think the summary there is that if a column's data is not present in the colDefs, then the filtering won't be able to access the data to filter against.  So, as you say, printing out text from params.node.data won't be searchable/filterable.\nAs far as a more fine-tuned question, there are two -\nThe first is this.  I have been struggling with how to accomplish a specific grid layout, and there are a few different examples that are very similar in result.  The requirement for the layout is the screen shot above which you referenced.  It is essentially a two-row layout similar to an email application's message list.  So, my question here is - how do you advise going about this in the most straightforward way, such that:\n- I can display data from a single JSON item in a list, with the object's data distributed across two sub-rows.\n- I can use QuickFilter and ExternalFilter against any of the data in the row/sub-row.\nThe more specific question is this.  I saw examples for master/detail, parent/child, fullWidth, etc.  I was confused about the relationship between FlowerNodes, fullWidth, grouped, etc.  How can I most simply have some data from a response object display in a main (top) row, while some other data from the same response object displays in a sub-row (bottom)?\nI've made several attempts at this, based off of the different examples, and haven't yet gotten things to work as you've described.  Would it be possible to get some basic example that demonstrates this?  I.e., how to distribute data from a single object across two linked rows, and how to QuickFilter/ExternalFilter against any of that data.\nI'm attaching a sample JSON file of our data, and the screen shot of the desired layout.  Please let me know if you can advise and provide an example, and if there's any more information I can provide to assist.\nThanks and cheers,\nDon\ndon-bluelinegrid.txt\n. @ceolter \nNiall,\nThanks for providing the example configuration.  I'll be trying this out shortly, but need a little clarification.\na) In 5 above, what does this mean? \"have an extra data attribute on the data for the fullWidht row.\"  Are you saying that I need to provide an extra piece of data to identify a fullWidth row, or are you saying that the framework will add this data to the node?  I can't add extra data, beause I don't have discreet/separate fullWidth row data - I am trying to derive a fullWidth child row from the parent data.  Please explain what you mean here.\nb) In 5 above also, you made two suggestions, both of which I had discovered earlier and tried.  This is what I was asking beofre, about how the data is actually included and made available for filtering. \n The most straightforward approach would be your suggestion a), to include hidden rows.  However, I'm using the Aurelia grid component, and the hidden attribute doesn't appear to be working in that component, regardless of all the variations I've tried.  For b), I believe that I tried setting the quickFilter text as well, but I may not have had the correct configuration.\nI will try all of this out shortly and report back.\nThanks again for providing the example to illustrate this.\nDon. @ceolter \nHi Niall,\nJust reporting back, all is good now.  I think the two key missing pieces here were integrating the getQuickFilterText() and getting the proper configuration of the flowerNode.  Once all of that was in place, I have both the ExternalFilter and QuickFilter working, and the parent/child rows do stay together as you said - and this is quite nice.\nSo, thanks again for providing the example - and for the foresight to design a flexible framework that could accommodate this use case.\nCheers,\nDon. Also experiencing this - hundreds of warnings printing in console.\nAs a side note/question - For a desktop component, why are touchevents used?  Is this something that should be disabled by default?. @seanlandsman \nRight, understood.\nThe question really was:\na. Should this be disabled by default.\nb. Is there a way to completely disable the touchevents, in the case where they are not needed/used.\nThanks,\nDon. @ceolter \nNiall,\nJust checking on this.\nThis one is really somewhere between a bug and a feature request.  It is related to identifying the selected/focus state of a grid row when using fullWidth.  This is currently impossible, and makes setting a visual selected state of a complete fullWidth row impossible.\nThe root cause is that the fullWidth row is split into two completely separate parts of the DOM tree, for the main and child row.  The main row is marked with an ag-row-focus CSS class, but the child row is not marked with the same class.  Since they are in disconnected parts of the DOM tree, there is no way through CSS to visually set both the main and child row of a fullWidth pair to be visually selected.\nMain row:\n<div role=\"row\" class=\"ag-row ag-row-no-animation ag-row-level-0 ag-row-even ag-row-focus\" row=\"4\" style=\"top: 160px; height: 30px;\"><div role=\"gridcell\" class=\"ag-cell-no-focus ag-cell ag-cell-not-inline-editing ag-cell-value\" tabindex=\"-1\" colid=\"0\" style=\"width: 30px; left: 0px;\">\nChild row:\n<div role=\"row\" class=\"ag-row ag-row-no-focus ag-row-no-animation ag-row-level-1 ag-full-width-row ag-row-odd\" row=\"5\" style=\"top: 190px; height: 50px;\">\nCan something be done in the grid to apply the ag-row-focus to both parent and child pairs of rows when in fullWidth mode?  Or, can you suggest a solution?\nThanks,\nDon. ",

    "cletusw": "It appears getRowHeight works for floating rows, even with virtual paging (which makes sense since all floating rows are known at once). Unfortunately, if rowHeight is set, getRowHeight is never called. Shouldn't this still be called to allow dynamic heights on the floating rows?\n. If we simply switch the order of the if and else here, we get the desired behavior.\n. I'm using virtual paging, so getRowHeight is not called for the main rows, hence static rowHeight. I'm also using floating top rows that I want to be a different height, hence getRowHeight. If there were a separate floatingRowHeight property that would also work, but I figure other use cases may have different heights depending on the contents of each floating row. rowHeight for the paged data, getRowHeight for the known-at-once floating data.\n.

Now because I upgraded to the last version nothing works on my app... I made an upgrade to 3.2.0 but still I have to remake the code used for handling grid data...\n. We are using gulp to generate a vendor.js and vendor.css file that contains all js and css files in bower.\nThe issue was that because of this line in .bower.json '\"main\": [\n    \"./main.js\"\n  ],', our gulp task loads only main.js. I changed that to \"main\": [\n    \"dist/ag-grid.js\",\n    \"dist/ag-grid.css\"\n  ], and it works now, but I also had to add this line 'agGrid.initialiseAgGridWithAngular1(angular);' before injecting the 'agGrid' dependency with this update which even at the 3.2.0 wasn't needed. \nI know this is because it works on different platforms and you need to somehow initialize it depending on framework but still is an extra change that need to be made so we can keep an updated version.\nAniway changing the main section of .bower.json is most important issue right now for us because it would mean changing it every time we do a bower install... do you have any sugestions of avoiding that?\n. Thanks a lot Leo! \nI will try that tomorrow. I'll let you know how that worked.\n. It's adding the ag-grid css and js files now but for some reason it's not filtering the main.js...

The reason being I have ag-grid within a scrollable container. e.preventDefault(); will cause the event to stop bubbling up to the parent container (the scrollable container). I am therefore unable to scroll down the table.\n. ping @ceolter \n. Okay, I have tried to illustrate it to make it more clear.\n\nSo I have made a div that is overflow:auto (the green one). It is important to underline that this is not a div made by ag-grid. It is a div I have made which is part of my design.\nInside this div I have an ag-grid. Let us imagine the table has 10 rows, each row is 50 px high. Now imagine my ag-grid container is height:1000px. This means ag-grid does not create a vertical scrollbar, since the table is smaller than the container.\nAs shown on the picture a part of the ag-grid is outside the viewport. I therefore scroll, however I expect to scroll to happen by the green box (not ag-grid). However when I scroll the e.preventDefault(); will prevent the event from bubbling up to the green box.\nDoes it make sense now?\n. Yes, I guess a good option would be to have an option to disable scrolling. This would also solve #801. However, I think it is important that we distinct between horizontal and vertical scrolling. I.e. you should be able to toggle horizontal and vertically scroll separately. \nShould we close #801 and merge it into this issue?\n. Okay, but for forPrint will disable horizontal scroll, yes?\nIn estimation, do you see any issue with outcommenting this line ?\nThen we could just make a setting. Something a long these lines\njavascript\nif (!this.options['auto_height']) {\n   this.eCenterRow.style.height = centerHeight + 'px';\n}\n. I will open a PR, if you are busy?\n. ",

We are seeing this lag when setting the data source on page load and anytime we change column visibility to true.  I assume this is related to row virtualization and IE managing memory and drawing DOM elements quite poorly. \nExample: With about 320 rows (height: 7000px) and ~20 columns the below calls takes about 2seconds to execute and an additional 3-6seconds for IE to stop drawing and give control back to the user.\n$scope.gridOptions.columnApi.setColumnsVisible(['streetAddress', 'district', 'city', 'region', 'country', 'latitude', 'longitude', 'collapseAddressDetail'], true);\nThis is not scalable. With a test of 1000s of records we've seen nearly exponential slowness in IE; Chrome works great :) \nIt would be ideal if the implemented solution was able to maintain the row virtualization when vertical scrolling is disabled. I believe this would eliminate slowness in IE, like when the grid has a reasonable height set.\nThanks!. ",

(our users like that - or just got used to it :) though for the sake of accesibility  it is always good to also provide alterative means for a command, so providing a button or keyboard shortcut is always beneficial...but that's just as a sidenote. (btw showing/hiding a column via the menu would also be great)\n. yes you are totally right, sorry! yeah, i think the best is to provide a little API. and yes, that's correct, the menu should appear relative to the position of the mouse click (x/y), just as for the cell context menu. would be really great to have this feature! thx a ton.\n. If it was up to me...i would place a million orders...as it turns out i have to convince our \"managers\" that my POC using ag-grid is actually what they like too ;) \n(working in the financial industry i guess you know what that means...unless your managers are different than ours, hehe)\n.

Because I don't see what compiler errors you get.\nHere is the code as I see it\n```\ninterface IDisposable {\n  dispose(): void;\n}\ninterface ICanBeDisposable {\n  dispose?(): void;\n}\nfunction fn(x: ICanBeDisposable) {\n  if (x.dispose) {\n    x.dispose();\n  }\n}\nclass Foo implements IDisposable {\n  dispose(): void { }\n}\nclass Bar  {\n  doSomething(): void { }\n}\nfn(new Foo()); // OK\nfn(new Bar()); // OK\n```\nOr you can use @RyanCavanaugh more complex code if you to make sure that classes don't implement destroy with a difference signature.\n. Are you sure? That's strange, as in my code, I didn't wrote that Bar implements ICanBeDisposable. What's line 24?. @guryanovev \nOh yes, I somehow missed that. Sorry.\nI now realize that the compiler has nothing to check when the parameter of a function is of weak type, so function fn(x: ICanBeDisposable) {...} is equivalent to function fn(x: any) {..}, and there is no need for ICanBeDisposable - you should just use any in that case..

    "nkoterba": "@Ruud-cb Can you provide more details/information on how you integrated NiceScroll with ag-grid?\nWe are trying to do the same since styling webkit properties won't affect Firefox (and actually seems to double scrollbars in FF).\nSadly, there's no styling for FF scrollbars without using a Jquery plugin: http://stackoverflow.com/a/6165489/6641960\n. To those who stumble across this thread looking for a true cross browser solution, I was able to integrate Ag-grid with Perfect-Scrollbar (https://noraesae.github.io/perfect-scrollbar/) without too much pain.\nEssentially, you need to add this to your project's CSS file: \ncss\n.ag-body-viewport {\n  position: relative; // Necessary for perfect scrollbar\n}\nThen I installed perfect-scrollbar using the NPM package.  I'm using Angular so in our controller that controls ag-grid, I use the $element service to grab .ag-body-viewport and initialize perfectScrollbar:\n``` javascript\n        // Note: Using ES6; could CommonJS-require if using Browserify or other builders\n        import perfectScrollbar from 'perfectScrollbar';\n    this.viewport = this.$element.find('.ag-body-viewport')[0];\n    perfectScrollbar.initialize(this.viewport);\n\n```\nI then made sure that whenever new data is loaded (we use virtual paging with ag-grid) or the grid is resized (onGridSizeChanged), I call:\njavascript\nperfectScrollbar.update(this.viewport);\nI also included the perfect-scrollbar.css file in my application to use the default Perfect-Scrollbar styles, but should be able to add your own CSS to match things.\n* For safety, I call perfectScrollbar.destroy(this.viewport) when our controller is destroyed.  Make sure to do this too if it's necessary in your relevant framework *\n. @Ruud-cb I'm actually a little confused myself about what ag-grid is doing with regards to showing/displaying scrollbar space.\nIt's probably somewhat complicated by the fact we are using angular (so things in DOM get bound and laid out \"late\") as well as flexbox (again causes more time for browser to calculate and lay things out).\nOn some of our tables, Ag-grid shows the standard scrollbar spacer (on the right, 16 px in width):\n\nOn other tables, Ag-grid doesn't show the scrollbar spacer at all (there are enough rows in this table to force a scrollbar; also of interest is if I resize the grid by resizing our window, etc. then all of a sudden the scrollbar spacer appears.  My guess is that ag-grid is laying out the grid before our data arrives so it doesn't think it needs a scrollbar.  Then the data arrives, but ag-grid doesn't subtract 16px from the last column's cells until the next time the grid is \"resized\"):\n\nPerfect scrollbar hides the scrollbar when the area isn't focused.  Here's what it looks like when the scrollbar appears:\n\nBut on the non-spacer table when the scrollbar is shown:\n\nPersonally, I'm ok showing the spacer all the time because perfect-scrollbar when you hover over the scrollbar, grows the scrollbar to make it easier to scroll which nicely fills up the gap left by ag-grid.\n\nWhat I have not looked into yet, is when and how ag-grid calculates the space for the scrollbar and why in some cases it leaves a spacer for the scrollbar and in other cases it does not.\nTo specifically answer your questions:\n\nAnd does ag-grid still reserve that space for the scrollbar when doing auto size to fit?\n- On some tables, it shows the spacer.  On others it does not.  A quick look to me indicates that internally ag-grid determines if a vertical scrollbar would appear (by calculating the height of the grid and how many rows it will display) and if so, since ag-grid specifically gives columns widths (e.g. style=\"width: 75px\"), there's no way using CSS to HIDE the spacer unless you modify the last column's HEADER and CELL width property via CSS and add 16px to it.  I'm hoping @ceolter can chime in here and confirm this.\n- So in terms of \"hiding\" the scrollbar spacer, unless there's some ag-grid api method or setting we can tweak, I think you're out of luck hiding the spacer without some nasty CSS manipulation.\n- Essentially, what we want to tell ag-grid is to \"even if my # of datarows would cause a y-overflow, don't subtract 16px from the last column's style width property\"\nDo they scroll nicely at the same time?\n- So pinned-right columns with a 3rd party scrollbar really don't play well.  Here's a screenshot:\n  \n\nI get two scrollbars.  The rightmost scrollbar is 'ag-grids'; my 3rd party scrollbar is the one on the left.  Scrolling the panel on the left (the unpinned columns) does NOT scroll the column on the right.  However, scrolling the pinned column on the right, does scroll all columns correctly.  My guess is that my 3rd party scrollbar should be applied to the right-most column instead of ag-body-viewport.\nWhen I use ag-grid default scrollbar implementation with a right-pinned column, everything scrolls correctly, however, it appears my columns are mis-aligned..it appears like ag-grid doesn't know to leave a spacer for the pinned-right column scrollbar. (@ceolter is it possible this is a bug in how ag-grid determines whether to create a scrollbar spacer with a right-pinned column?...the online example you give under Pinning https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-pinning/index.php only shows examples of left-pinned columns)  See pic:\n\nAs a follow-up, with a right-pinned column, I switched my 3rd party scrollbar to apply to to .ag-pinned-right-cols-viewport.\nNow I only get one scrollbar (but I still probably need to apply the 3rd party scrollbar to the unpinned columns for horizontal scrolling).  Everything scrolls smoothly and evenly.  The only issue is that my scrollbar on the right disappears!!! It appears that the 3rd party scrollbar is calculating it's \"height\" using the height of the entire contents/body of the pinned right column instead of just the right-column's viewport height.\nHere's a picture (notice right-most scrollbar looks ok, bottom scrollbar is default ag-grid, which I'd need to replace with 3rd party).  Everything scrolls nicely and in sync though:\n\n. @ceolter So I think the issue is not so much \"styling\" of the scrollbar as getting ag-grid to not take into account scrollbars.  In looking thru the code and the link you provided above, it appears that ag-grid is reducing the width of the viewport (and column widths) to leave space for the system's scrollbar when scrolling is present.\nSince some 3rd party scrollbar replacements actually hide the scrollbar entirely or lay the custom scrollbar ON TOP of the div to scroll, it would be nice to have an option to tell ag-grid not to do any special \"scrollbar\" calculations\n. @ceolter thanks for the response to the feature request.\nI was concerned that calling the sizeColsToFit and autoSizeAllColumns might cause unnecessary processing and/or DOM thrashing (haven't looked into source code for those methods to see what they actually do).\nWe were attempting to try to call the \"least\" expensive methods.  If the above public API calls are indeed \"low-cost\", then I will update our \"fix\" to use your suggested code snippet.\nAs for the enterprise license, I will put in a good word with our company's president :)\n. @ceolter In lieu of adding 1,000s of Row listeners, I know that best practice is often to listen to the parent container's mouseenter/mouseleave/mousemove events and then try to determine the hovered item by using its position offset in parent.  Identifying the offset of course is no trivial matter.  I don't suppose there's an ag-grid API call or private API method that would return the specific row under the current mouse position?\n. @psumstr So you are using the In-Memory Row Model and just manually adding data to the rowData array when scroll gets close to bottom?\nAnd this works with \"expandable\" flowers or nodes?\n. As a follow-up this is especially useful if a single page request fails.  If you call failCallback() the page is marked as failed and is never re-fetched unless the developer calls one of the two API methods above.  But why invalidate all my caches if only one page fails?\nCurrently, it appears the checkPageToLoad in the VirtualPageCache only finds pages to load that are marked \"dirty\", not \"dirty\" or \"failed\"..

    "saifeer": "Hey @ceolter, \nI see you have closed the issue but I have a use case where it seems to make sense to export the floating bottom rows - \nI am currently using the floating row to create a summary aggregation record for the data that I show (no groupings just simple summaries). I listen to the model update event to refresh my summary data by recalculating the summaries based on the rows to display.\nThis works fine but the issue is when I try to export the data. It skips the floating bottom row completely and although I can add a customer footer in the CSV, its not the same as adding a row of data in the CSV. \nIf there is no way to export the rendered summary, would there be a way to add a custom row to the export that I can populate with the summary data I already have from the grid? I could hard-code the data in the custom footer string but that would seem too much of a hack to actually have columns and CSV separators hard-coded in the export function. (plus what happens when someone is using a different CSV separator and I am hard coding comma.)\nIs there a better and more efficient way of doing this? \nThanks\nS\n. That's awesome! Nice work man! Much appreciated\n. I am facing this issue as well.\n@ceolter, Can you please check this issue as it seems like a big problem when using Angular+Ag-grid. \nYou wouldn't even need a plunkr for it, you can just reproduce it on the ag-grid website: https://www.ag-grid.com/best-angularjs-data-grid/index.php\nJust go down to the Angular compiling section and when you click on the button in the \"Age\" field, it fires just once but now just reorder the columns and then click again and you will find it firing multiple times.\nVery strange that no one picked up this issue till now...\nSeems to me that the angular1Compile() function is called since the displayColumnsChanged event is fired. This recompiles the row DOM but AngularJS doesn't like once recompiled DOM to be recompiled again as it duplicates the bindings.\nThanks\nS\n. I do not agree with this. There is a property \"angularCompileRows\" that can be defined to true on the grid which essentially breaks the whole grid as soon as you as much as try resizing the columns. The solution cannot be to not use Angular. If that's the case, why keep a property that would break the grid in the first place only to be told to not use it!\nThere could be many scenarios where you need a grid inside of an angular application and you need angular to be able to talk to the contents of the grid and vice versa. I would assume Niall saw some use-cases or demand for angular support for him to actually allow angular compilation. \nThanks\nS\n. ",

Agree - that is the reason I think the \"gridReady\" event need to be sync with DOM as well.

    "tystol": "+1\n@ceolter I understand you store these values as keys in a js object for performance reasons, so they must be a string, but surely this js map can be setup so each object in the map contains the original 'sourceValue', which can then be passed into the cellRenderer? (havn't looked at the code, just spitballing)\n. @ceolter if I understand correctly, the performance benefit comes from using strings as keys in the map, but nothing to do with storing bool values directly inside the map, right? Again, haven't looked at the code (can you point me to this filter code?), but what about storing an object in the map rather than direct booleans, that contains both the boolean selected value, along with the source value? eg, when setting up the filter:\nselectedValuesMap['0.01'] = {selected:true, sourceValue:0.01};\nThen when you lookup to check if it is selected, it simply becomes selectedValuesMap['0.01'].selected (with some null checks).\n. Something like this?\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid-enterprise/pull/45\n. @seanlandsman Last time I looked at the ag-grid-pipeline page, it did contain the AG-129 ticket, so I was hopeful this would be looked at soon. But looking at the pipeline now, I see no mention of AG-129. Is this still on your roadmap to fix? set filters are very clunky as it stands right now, and more so when combined with valueFormatters.. The docs need updating. But @ceolter is doing a damn good job with his limited time. I think the least we can all do is search the issues before opening new questions:\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/issues/1020\n. +1 - would be very handy for us also\nWe currently use ag-grid for all of our data-focused tables (laying out in a fixed height div that we set to fill to the remaining available window space). But for our navigation/content related tables we prefer the whole page to scroll, and therefor don't use ag-grid. It would be very nice if we could standardize both of these use cases to ag-grid. Understand there are performance implications (you loose any benefit of virtual scrolling) but for navigation/content purposes the grid will never be that large anyway.\n. Ah, did not realize that was an option, sorry for the issue noise. And thanks for an amazing product!.

    "mjattiot": "Hello guys,\nWe are using the set filter as well with our enterprise edition and we noticed a related issue. I am not sure if AG-129 will handle it so let me describe the issue:\n- We have a set filter which use an array of integers for the filterParams.value parameter (it's an enumeration)\n- We use cellrenderer to convert the enum to strings to display\n- Internally ag grid convert the array of integers to an array of string which is fine for us\n- However ! we usually store the state of filters when the getRow callback is raised. The callback parameter has a filterModel attribute set with the array of integers instead of strings. It's an issue because using setFilterModel with such an object won't work. We therefore need to save the state using getFilterModel instead of the getRow filterModel parameter. It's inconsistent.\n- By the way if we convert our set filter value parameter to an array of string (ie [\"0\", \"1\", \"2\"]), getRow callback will still have an array of integer has a parameter ...\nWhat's your advise on this one ? Our workaround is just to ignore getRow parameters and reuse the API to get the current filter model.. ",

Nothing else. On slower mobile connections I'm asking the user to wait for a ton of code to download that isn't even used. At some point I'm going to have to start looking for a minimal feature grid with a smaller file size.

    "LinnykS": "@ceolter Hi. Discovering Value Getters and Value Formatters chapter I found that 'cellFormatter' property mentioned only once and presents with not a lot of information, plus is this 'valueFormatter' property applicable at all? Because it looks like 'valueFormatter' property does not work as needed and 'cellFormatter', on the other hand, works fine instead of it. . Have the same for 17.1.1 version. It's just exist in DOM despite ag-side-buttons & ag-column-panel children elements have ag-hidden class added.\n\nIf add ag-hidden for ag-tool-panel manually it works as expected.. You can use toolPanelSuppressSideButtons: true to hide the panel. But for 17.1.1 you need to add additional styles tricks, as grid has an issue with complete hiding. https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid/issues/2319. Hey @bimalpaul.

Without specifying any \u201cexclude\u201d or \u201cfiles\u201d entries, all files in the folder containing the tsconfig.json and all its sub-directories are included in your compilation.\nIf you want to exclude some of the files use \u201cexclude\u201d, if you would rather specify all the files instead of letting the compiler look them up, use \u201cfiles\u201d.\nThat was tsconfig.json automatic inclusion. There is a different issue, which is module resolution. By module resolution, I mean the compiler trying to understand what ns means in an import statement like: import * ns from \u201cmod\u201d. To do so, the compiler needs the definition of a module, this could be a .ts file for your own code, or a .d.ts for an imported definition files. if the file was found, it will be included regardless if it was excluded in the previous steps.\nSo to exclude a file from the compilation, you need to exclude and all all files that has an import or ///  directives to it.\nUse tsc --listFiles to list what files are included in your compilation, and tsc --traceResolution to see why they were included.. \n",

I'm having the same problem with the new infinite row model. I was using regular pagination until v8 and now I'm trying to upgrade to v11/12. \nI'm seeing that a lot of behaviour that used to be there with pagination: forEachNodeAfterFilter, headerCheckboxSelection is not available for the new infinite row model, so most of my grids are broken.\nI don't get why it was necessary to remove previous functionality.

I hope you will reconsider your position on this issue.  If we are not able to get to a solution soon, we will need to go another direction.. It used to work without having to do that.  Now we end up with a double set of scrollbars for the grid and for the page.  Was there a reason for changing it to require a height?

If you want my code I achieved it by adapting some of the code from ClipboardService.prototype.copyRangeDown\nClipboardService.prototype.finishPasteFromClipboard = function (data) {\n    var _this = this;\n    if (main_1.Utils.missingOrEmpty(data)) {\n        return;\n    }\n    var focusedCell = this.focusedCellController.getFocusedCell();\n    if (!focusedCell) {\n        return;\n    }\n    var parsedData = this.dataToArray(data);\n    if (!parsedData) {\n        return;\n    }\n    // remove last row if empty, excel puts empty last row in\n    var lastLine = parsedData[parsedData.length - 1];\n    if (lastLine.length === 1 && lastLine[0] === '') {\n        main_1.Utils.removeFromArray(parsedData, lastLine);\n    }\n    var currentRow = new main_1.GridRow(focusedCell.rowIndex, focusedCell.floating);\n    var cellsToFlash = {};\n    var updatedRowNodes = [];\n    var updatedColumnIds = [];\n    //If there's only one value, paste to whole selection\n    if(parsedData.length === 1 && parsedData[0].length === 1 && this.gridOptionsWrapper.isEnablePasteOneToMany())\n    {\n        this.iterateFirstActiveRange(function (currentRow, rowNode, columns) {\n            updatedRowNodes.push(rowNode);\n            columns.forEach(function (column, index) {\n                if (!column.isCellEditable(rowNode)) {\n                    return;\n                }\n                _this.valueService.setValue(rowNode, column, parsedData[0][0]);\n                var cellId = new main_1.GridCell(currentRow.rowIndex, currentRow.floating, column).createId();\n                cellsToFlash[cellId] = true;\n                var colId = column.getId();\n                if(updatedColumnIds.indexOf(colId) === -1) updatedColumnIds.push(colId);\n            });\n        });\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        parsedData.forEach(function (values, index) {\n            // if we have come to end of rows in grid, then skip\n            if (!currentRow) {\n                return;\n            }\n            var rowNode = _this.getRowNode(currentRow);\n            updatedRowNodes.push(rowNode);\n            var column = focusedCell.column;\n            values.forEach(function (value) {\n                if (main_1.Utils.missing(column)) {\n                    return;\n                }\n                if (!column.isCellEditable(rowNode)) {\n                    return;\n                }\n                var processedValue = _this.processRangeCell(rowNode, column, value, _this.gridOptionsWrapper.getProcessCellFromClipboardFunc());\n                _this.valueService.setValue(rowNode, column, processedValue);\n                var cellId = new main_1.GridCell(currentRow.rowIndex, currentRow.floating, column).createId();\n                cellsToFlash[cellId] = true;\n                if (updatedColumnIds.indexOf(column.getId()) < 0) {\n                    updatedColumnIds.push(column.getId());\n                }\n                column = _this.columnController.getDisplayedColAfter(column);\n            });\n            // move to next row down for next set of values\n            currentRow = _this.cellNavigationService.getRowBelow(currentRow);\n        });\n    }\n    // this is very heavy, should possibly just refresh the specific cells?\n    this.rowRenderer.refreshCells(updatedRowNodes, updatedColumnIds);\n    this.eventService.dispatchEvent(main_1.Events.EVENT_FLASH_CELLS, { cells: cellsToFlash });\n    this.focusedCellController.setFocusedCell(focusedCell.rowIndex, focusedCell.column, focusedCell.floating, true);\n};\nAnd the required config-based code:\nGridOptionsWrapper.prototype.isEnablePasteOneToMany = function () { return isTrue(this.gridOptions.enablePasteOneToMany); };\nand\n'pivotPanelShow', 'suppressTouch', 'enablePasteOneToMany',.

It is not a problem specific to ag-grid or a problem that ag-grid was exercising.\nThe expression sandbox was removed in angular 1.6 to help mitigate its misuse by developers:\nhttp://angularjs.blogspot.com.au/2016/09/angular-16-expression-sandbox-removal.html\nHowever... to quote that article:\n\"In all versions of Angular 1, your application is at risk of malicious attack if you generate Angular templates using untrusted user-provided content (even if the content is sanitized to contain no HTML).\nag-grid may be used to generate templates based on user input, but only if an application doesn't implement an angular-safe cell renderer. i.e it doesn't introduce any new vulnerability/risk that isn't already present when writing all angular applications. It is not a problem specific to ag-grid, but rather a problem with incorrectly written angular applications.\nI suppose if a cell renderer was not configured and angular compilation is enabled, ag-grid could use a 'span ng-non-bindable' default cell renderer wrapper for safety/convenience. However this is easily mitigated by using a custom renderer that uses a safe template. If an ag-grid application is using angular compilation, in all likely-hood they will be using custom renderers.\nWould it be possible to get written confirmation of this fact?\nAdvisories such as https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/327 seem to be naively generated from github issues without full investigation. This unfortunately impedes adoption by customers which have policies against third party software with outstanding advisories. \nA documentation update to highlight this danger and ways to avoid the potential problem might be all that is required. If this issue is closed I assume the advisory would also be marked as resolved.\n. @gabriellebourdages\nYou may be better off using < span ng-bind=\"::row.data[col]\" >\nor something to that effect. It prevents the possibility of user data closing the ng-non-bindable tag.. Perhaps @gabriellebourdages could close this issue given that it has been proven not to be an ag-grid problem, but rather a generic known angularjs pitfall. It would hopefully close that baseless advisory which is preventing adoption from enterprise customers.\nIt could be re-raised as a documentation issue if needed, without the words 'XSS vulnerability' to prevent bots scraping it unnecessarily..

That is correct, the column resizer was added and then removed to follow this guideline: https://material.io/design/components/data-tables.html#behavior\nThe only division present is between pinned columns and not pinned columns.\nTo help with the resizing, when you hover a header cell, it will be highlighted to make it easier to find the edges.\nYou can always manually add the resizers with the following styles: \n.ag-header-cell-resize:after {\n    content: '';\n    border-left: 1px solid #ececec;\n    height: 60%;\n    right: 4px;\n    top: 9px;\n    position: absolute;\n}. @mjonas4356 Can you provide an example of this issue?

In that case, your div with flex:1 should have a limit on how much it's allowed to grow. \nstyle=\"flex: 1; max-width: 100%;\nBut i'll take a look at the other examples as well, looks like I have enough info.. @jiangyh1024 To go around this problem we had some properties in the styles before that were not ideal like the normal-layout container set to height: 0 and min-height: 0 which fixed flex-box overflow but broke some item alignments.\nOne approach here would be to apply min-height: 0 to your div wrapper. Or even set  it to overflow: hidden.\nSo this: \n<div style=\"flex: 1\">\n    <ag-grid-angular style=\"height: 100%; width:100%\" *ngIf=\"gridOptions\" class=\"ag-theme-balham\" [gridOptions]=\"gridOptions\">\n    </ag-grid-angular>\n</div>\nShould be this: \n<div style=\"flex: 1; min-height: 0\">\n    <ag-grid-angular style=\"height: 100%; width:100%\" *ngIf=\"gridOptions\" class=\"ag-theme-balham\" [gridOptions]=\"gridOptions\">\n    </ag-grid-angular>\n</div>\nor <div style=\"flex: 1; overflow: hidden\">.

Ok this is what I thought, one last question though...is it possible to \"pass a function by parameter\" to a CellRenderer?\nI would like to keep my CellRenderer generic and just execute a provided function when the checkbox changes value.\nFor now I did it this way (in React)\nIn the CellRender:\nrender: function() {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"text-center\">\n            <input type=\"checkbox\" onChange={this.props.context.onCheckChanged(this.props.value);}/>\n        </div>\n    );\n},\n\nIn my Component containing the CellRenderer, I set the gridOptions context to this and have the function onCheckChanged defined that does the job.

    "begincalendar": "After skimming some of the relevant code, it appears as though the IGetRowsParams interface is being used for both pagination and virtual pagination.\nThis \"pagination-by-where\" technique only works when you know the previous adjacent page, so it wouldn't work for virtual pagination, because there is potential for non-adjacent page skipping.\nSo I'm thinking if this were to be implemented, that IGetRowsParams interface will need to be split into two (e.g. via inheritance, to avoid duplication).. Sorry about the lack of clarity.\nSo for an existing use-case example, consider Reddit and viewing posts in a sub-reddit.\nYou get a \"prev\" and/or a \"next\" button and the pagination is done via WHERE clause, for performance reasons. \nI.e. the pagination is done via a query string like so: ?count=25&after=t3_5sules (for getting the next page) and ?count=25&before=t3_5sules (for getting the previous page).\nNo offset, just a value (based on the prior page's data) to put in the WHERE clause and a LIMIT.\nSo it would be handy to be able to implement that kind of pagination/fetching of rows, without everyone having to manually keep track of previously fetched rows.\nI.e. If Ag-grid could (in addition to startRow, endRow, etc.), provide either:\n\nAll the rows fetched from the prior page.\nThe first and last rows from the prior page.\nEtc.\n\n...in addition to some kind of indication as to whether this new page to be fetched is before or after the prior page, so also providing either:\n\nPrior page number and new page number\nBoolean variable which is true for forward and false for backwards.\nEtc.\n\nI would usually be more specific with something like a pull request, but I'm not sure on the design approach you'd want to take if you are interested in providing this behaviour.\nIf it's still unclear, please let me know and I'll create a small pull request just to show you exactly what I mean, regardless of whether that particular implementation is used..

As an imperfect workaround what I managed to do was to handle tab and shift + tab and for the respective event handlers:\n```TypeScript\npublic onTab() {\n    const colIndex = (this.api as any).columnController.gridColumns.indexOf(this.params.column);\n    const nextColumn = (this.api as any).columnController.gridColumns[colIndex + 1];\nif (nextColumn) {\n    this.api.ensureColumnVisible(nextColumn);\n}\n\n}\npublic onShiftTab() {\n    const colIndex = (this.api as any).columnController.gridColumns.indexOf(this.params.column);\n    const prevColumn = (this.api as any).columnController.gridColumns[colIndex - 1];\nif (prevColumn) {\n    this.api.ensureColumnVisible(prevColumn);\n}\n\n}\n```\nThis causes the body to scroll when tabbing through the inputs in the custom header component, however the body and header are not perfectly aligned..

In the first getRow() call, startRow is 0 and endRow is 10, if I add 15 rows here, the 11th to 15th rows will be overwritten by the next getRows() call. Because the library assumes the last row is the 10th one and starts rendering new ones from 11th row. \nI assume I need to call setVirtualRowCount() as well when doing this.. @ceolter oh sorry maybe my mistake, setVirtualRowCount() does the exact thing I wanna do right?. @willhalling thank you!. @ceolter \nYea all the page is loaded either way, but I'm talking about the order of the loading. Better loaded from the currently visible page to make it seem faster.\nHere's my actual use case. I have rows that are sorted by date column's value, and user can modify the date in the grid, which triggers refreshVirtualPageCache() and refetch the server side re-sorted data. Say now the grid has 10 virtual pages loaded in advance, and the user changes the date of the very first row of the first page, the user has to wait for 10 requests before seeing the first page updating and the updated row disappearing from the page (because currently the request starts from the one for the last page to the one for the first page). \nSo it'd be nice if any of the following is possible.\n\nmaking ag-grid load the currently visible page first, then load the rest of the pages\nletting developers specify the order of the page update\nadding a method to update only specified pages\n\nSorting the pages here will do.\nhttps://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/blob/master/src/ts/rowModels/infinateScrolling/virtualPageCache.ts#L258\n. @willhalling thanks!.

    "AlexLnz": "HI, I can confirm this issue. Having it with ag-grid 8.0.0 then upgraded to 9.0.0 and 9.1.0 but still the same.\nI tried to extract the code into a small demo project. Now in the demo project it works. I can notice following difference between working and non-working variant:\nWhile dragging the column it looks like this:\nWorking variant:\n\nNot-working variant:\n\nNotice that the working variant shows a \"dragging rectangle object\" while the column is moved. The non-working variant doesn't do that. Maybe this is a usable hint for you.. Any news about this?. Do you know why there is a difference at dragging the column (with / without the dragging rectangle)?\nIs it a special mode? Maybe this will be a hint and I could investigate more.. Hm, I've nothing like that in my sample. Just a simple grid.\n. I've added some debug code and the click handler above is called as soon as the mouse button is released over the header, after dragging the column. But only in the not-working variant.\nThe working variant displays this rectangle containing the column title. When releasing the mouse button it doesn't affect the column header. I guess that the clicked event goes to the moving rectangle instead of the column header, therefore nothing happens.\nThe question is - for the not working variant - why do I not get this rectangle while dragging?\nDo you have any hint where to debug?\n. @raivis-v Could you post a code sample how to do this?. Hm, doesn't work for me. I did put it into the style sheet which belongs to the component where I use the ag-grid. I tried even bigger values, like 99999999 for z-index.. It seems that there is no ghost element. When I drag a column all that changes is this:\n\nPS: My second screenshot is from our project. The same ag-grid in our production code, not demo.. If the ghost object is the panel which appears normally during column dragging, which lies under the mouse cursor, then it is understandable why the mouse button release event is directed to the column header. Most probably it would have been directed to the ghost object's panel, if it was there. Then everything would be ok.. Wow, it's actually placed at the end of the body!\nSo I have to place the CSS with the fix into index.html, not into the component. Now it works!\nThanks!\n@seanlandsman Maybe it would be a good idea to increase the z-order of ag-dnd-ghost to a bigger value, as for example the 5000. The reason seems to be that we are using a UI framework, which provides windows having a greater z-order than ag-grid's drag n drop ghost.\n. Hi,\nWith previous ag-grid version we could insert rows into the data model without touching the view. Unfortunately we find no way to do this since 10.1.0\nThe logic which decides if a row entry is an insert or an update is already done on our side.\nWe would prefer to leave the production code as it is, since it is already tested and certified by a significant amount of effort.. ",

Just put this code somewhere in your own css file\n.ag-dnd-ghost{\n  z-index: 5000;\n}\nValue depends on your actual project and what you have done in it. Could be much higher (or lower) in your case. Assuming you have the same issue I had.. Ok then, it's not your case. Try to do element inspection while dragging column and look for ghost element if it's even there. It should appear as the last element in the DOM while dragging column.\n\nIf it is present, I think it should be something wrong with the styles. Try !important for z-index. I can't imagine anything else at the moment.\np.s.\nWhere did you get the second screenshot (not working one) in your previous posts? Is it from your own project or did you make sample from the scratch?. Yes, ghost element is the panel which appears while dragging column. Scroll down your DOM tree to the bottom so that \"close body\" tag is visible. Ghost should appear right above the close body tag (like in my screenshot).

Globally disabling text selection is no option in our case, and I guess in many cases.\nIt would be very nice if ag-grid could somehow prevent this text selection in Internet Explorer.

    "cliffsun91": "There is a definitely a bug (when using AgGrid React at least) - gridOptionsWrapper.ts provides a getter getCacheBlockSize() which returns this.gridOptions.cacheBlockSize, however copyAttributesToGridOptions() in ComponentUtils.ts (used by AgGridReact) copies only 'known' grid options but in the NUMBER_PROPERTIES array it's still known as 'infiniteBlockSize'.\nAs a result you can't change the block size at all in the infinite row model. If you pass the prop 'cacheBlockSize' Ag Grid throws it away as it doesn't recognise it as a valid grid option, but if you pass in the prop 'infiniteBlockSize' then it gets passed in as a grid option but infiniteRowModel.ts is now referencing 'cacheBlockSize' which it thinks is undefined.\nThis needs to be fixed as it's preventing us from migrating from AgGrid version 9 to 11 whilst maintaining the server side pagination/sorting functionality we need.\nAs I can't seem to re-open issues, I'll created a new one.. I've created a pull request here which should fix the issue: https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/pull/1734. We're using Redux in our application with ag-grid. We use the infinite scroll model (though in pagination mode) and we currently don't use any dispatch actions to get data. We just directly fetch in the getRows function and use the successCallback and failCallback in the returned promise from fetch. This works well for us, with the only caveat being that we can't directly control when the fetch request occurs (Ag-grid calls getRows). The other thing is that the data itself is not stored in the Redux state but that works well for us as we're currently only read data and not modifying it.\nI don't think it's \"hacky' to dispatch redux actions on grid events, if you're using a react-redux and the connect method to mapDispatchToProps, then your dispatch actions (to fetch data) are just normal callback methods from the React component's (the component wrapping AgGridReact) point of view.. In addition, I've found that when using the Infinite Scrolling Row Model with pagination that the loading overlay doesn't show when traversing pages, instead we get a blank grid whilst the data is being fetched from the server. This doesn't look as good as it used to.. Thanks - I've used the workaround to explicitly call the showNoRowsOverlay() when our fetching returns 0 rows. Getting the loading overlay to show is possible but requires more effort (I would have to know when the next block/page is being requested - ideally after pressing the pagination controls). \nHaving consistent overlay behaviour across row models would be great - especially when pagination is used in the infinite scrolling model. .

You can in some way \"lock\" grid before start async operation and \"unlock\" it after. @makinggoodsoftware , hi, can you provide AG-XXX number of this issue? I tried to find it on https://www.ag-grid.com/ag-grid-pipeline/, but failed. Workaround:\nitems.reverse().forEach(x => gridApi.updateRowData({\n            addIndex: index,\n            add: [x]\n        }));\nAnother one:\ngridApi.getModel().insertItemsAtIndex(index, items). Also found: https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-data-update/#gsc.tab=0\n\nThe index to add is put in for historical purposes and should not be used. If you want the grid to display in a certain order, you should apply a grid sort and have the row data sorted.\n\nThis is not friendly change, you force developers to use grid sort, but it is not useful sometimes. In our case, server computes position for each row and sends to client update with computed index. Client-side js just insert rows at this index. Exact error is in inMemoryNodeManager.ts:101\nadd.forEach( item => {\n                let newRowNode: RowNode = this.addRowNode(item, addIndex);\n                rowNodeTransaction.add.push(newRowNode);\n            });\nIt's better to add items in reverse order, or increment index at each iteration. Thanks!. I have also found, that refreshing cells without cellRenderer leads to cell recreation:\n remove previous cell content\n append new content \n apply ColDef.cellStyles\n apply ColDef.cellClass\n* apply ColDef.cellClassRules\nI bet that it will be faster to perform some aka 'refresh' mechanism for those cells \n don't re-create internal elements, just change their text content\n don't apply cellClass/cellStyle - as done for cellRenderers with 'refresh'. I'm not sure my workarounds will work for all or most cases, but they work for me\nWorkaround for GroupCellRenderer:\n// performance hack: support fast refresh for GroupCellRenderer\nGroupCellRenderer.prototype.refresh = x => true;\nWorkaround for cells without renderer - don't use columns without renderer, use StubComponent where possible:\n```\n@Component({\n    selector: 'stub-cell',\n    template: '{{field}}',\n    changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush\n})\nexport class StubComponent implements AgRendererComponent {\n    field: any;\nconstructor(private readonly changeDetector: ChangeDetectorRef) {\n}\n\nagInit(params: ICellRendererParams) {\n    this.refresh(params);\n}\n\nrefresh(params: ICellRendererParams) {\n    this.field = params.valueFormatted || params.value;\n    this.changeDetector.markForCheck();\n}\n\n}\n```. I have also tried to manually define 'title' in my cellRenderer's view. This works, but tooltip is shown only over \"real\" cellRenderer content: e.g. if cellRenderer is empty and shows \"Required field\" tooltip, user won't be able to see it.. In this scenario 'refresh' returns true.\nBut developer have no ability to modify tooltip in 'refresh' method: Column tooltip is something outside of custom cell component - just like \"cellClassRules\" which are updated regardless of 'refresh' return. This leads to situation where I can't have both cell tooltip and cell component with refresh: true. This is very disappointing.\nAnd as I mentioned in previous comment, custom [title] inside component is not useful in ag-grid cells.. Anniversary, 2048th issue =). Workaround, dirty but working (patching sources):\n```typescript\nimport {RowRenderer} from 'ag-grid';\n// https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid/issues/2048\n(function patchRowRenderer() {\n    const rowRenderer: any = RowRenderer;\n    const original = rowRenderer.prototype.findNextCellToFocusOn;\n    function patched(...args: any[]) {\n        this.stopEditing();\n        return original.apply(this, args);\n    }\n    rowRenderer.prototype.findNextCellToFocusOn = patched;\n})();\n```. Hi, makinggoodsoftware,\nhttps://plnkr.co/edit/NFE6ZH162zku3NEbjWV0?p=preview\nEnter 'yes' in first column and press tab - you will not go into second column editing\nOn the other hand, enter 'yes' and press Enter, Right, Enter - you will successfully start editing second column\n. I think getRowClass got sealed after grid load (read to GridApi internals and never re-read again). Why don't you define getRowClass before grid load? E.g.\ngridOptions = {...\n   getRowClass: this.yourCallback()\n}\nAlso, you can see, that your callback may apply multiple times (on each event fire) while its contents are never changed from time to time - this looks suspicious. Hi, if node.expanded is undefined, this means its not expandable, thus\ndefinetely not expanded). Hi, Nicolae, doesn't \"editable\" callback on column definition fits your requirements?? You can use it in the following way:\ncity: ColDef = {\n        headerName: 'City',\n        field: 'city',\n        width: 100,\n        cellEditorFramework: CityEditorComponent,\n        cellRendererFramework: CityComponent,\n        cellClassRules: params => params.data.isCityEditable ? 'editable-cell' : 'readonly-cell',\n        editable: params => params.data.isCityEditable\n    };. I don't think its that hard to find =)\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-column-properties/#gsc.tab=0\n\neditable | Set to true if this col is editable, otherwise false. Can also be a function to have different rows editable.\n\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-cell-editing/#gsc.tab=0\n\nIt is possible to have only a few cells in a column editable, to do so, instead of colDef.editable=true, you can specify a callback that will get called for each cell displayed for that column. If you return true the cell will be editable. The params for the callback are:. Isn't it the same issue as https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid/issues/1822 ?. Hi! This is reproduced in latest ag-grid, so +1. We have the same issue: complex formatted tooltip. Cells have \"overflow: hidden:\", so tooltip only works with \"position: fixed\", but in that case it works badly with scrolling. We need to have either some css workaround to support formatted tooltips along with scrolling, or fine-grained solution aka \"tooltipRendererFramework\"\n\n. \n",

Agreed - this manifests in a couple other places as well (now even in trying to just build apps using newer builds of ag-grid when strictNullChecks is on).\nAs a workaround, if you're working with an older build where you can at least compile with ag-grid, you can use an exclamation mark to override the null check as the following\nts\npublic render(): JSX.Element {\n        return (\n            <AgGridReact onColumnResized={(event) => console.log(event!.finished)} />\n        );\n    }. If you know a property is actually not null/undefined in some context, you\ncan simply use ! (As in instance!.property).\nI'll fork later and give it a shot.\nOn Thu, Oct 19, 2017, 12:44 AM UselessPickles notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nThis is getting pretty hopeless for me to fix myself. For example,\nRowNode.id, RowNode.rowHeight, etc, are set to null in some situations.\nThere is plenty of code that assumes those properties are not null. how to\nfix the code to deal with those properties being potentially null is\nunclear, especially when there are mathematical calculations/comparisons\ninvolving RowNode.rowHeight, which may be null, but the existing code\nignores that possibility.\nI think someone that understands this codebase well needs to simply enable\nthe \"strict\" compiler option, then work through all the compiler errors a\nfew at a time. You will discover some bad assumptions in the code, and will\nneed to make non-trivial decisions about how to handle null/undefined\nvalues. There's probably a few nasty bugs hiding in there that will be\nfixed by updating the code to pass a \"strict\" compile.\nAlso, FYI, the .exists() method is quite useless, because the compiler\ndoes not recognize it as guaranteeing that the param is not null. In most\ncases, at least for non-string types, it's much better to simply test the\nvariable directly (test if == or != null, with double instead of triple\nequal to handle both null and undefined) without using .exists() so that\nthe compiler is aware that you performed a null check.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid/issues/1979#issuecomment-337805507,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ACBnis_zUU8z23ytGuY0Q-ktWAi9GwQIks5stuGkgaJpZM4P12uA\n.\n.

However, this would be a break from our usual architecture pattern.

    "ksnyder": "Have you found a solution?  This problem still exists in for me in version 13.1.  getNodeChildDetails() gets called when first rendering the grid, but not after updating the rowData and calling api.refreshCells().  All changes to cell data in the main row work fine, there's just no refresh of the its child nodes.. Thinking that the children may be handled like row grouping, I tried calling api.refreshInMemoryRowModel('group') as described at https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-data-update/?framework=react#gsc.tab=0  but it didn't solve the problem.. Hi -- I believe the original poster tried that (he mentions calling setRawData which I believe is a typo for setRowData).  In my case, I am using React and setting a new value of rowData with each render() call per the docs at https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-data-update/#gsc.tab=0, which I understand is the React equivalent of setRowData().\nI am also setting deltaRowDataMode={true} and it works to get updates to the main rows, but not child rows, and I've verified that getNodeChildDetails doesn't get called except upon the original population of rowData.  If it helps, this code worked in version 10, but I haven't tested versions in between -- now on 13.1.  Thanks!. Hi -- There is a repo illustrating this problem at https://github.com/ksnyder/ag-grid-demo/commits/nonet.  The steps below involve creating a new child node, but I've confirmed that the same problem occurs when updating an existing child node.  Note that this code differs from your sample code in that the object returned by getNodeChildDetails does not have a 'key' property, based on this support thread: https://ag-grid.com/forum/showthread.php?tid=6005.\nHere are the steps:\n\nchange to the branch 'nonet'\nnpm run build && npm run serve\nload app at localhost:3000\nclick on 'Grid' in upper right\nnotice that tenders that already have a bid display correctly -- click anywhere on the bid column to open the child\nselect the first tender that doesn't already have a bid (should be id 64), then click the button 'Enter/edit bids'\nput some data in the form (don't have to complete all fields) and click 'Create Bid'\nthe console will log the new rowData as '==== rendering Grid with rowData', and there will be a separate log of tender 64, with the 'bids' property including the data you just created (new bid id of 1000), but no change in the grid is evident\nthe first problem is the leftmost column of the tender you bid on is not refreshed until you click on it (this calculation is done in the file grid.es6 colDef calling value getter function 'gridGetBidDisplay'\nthe other problem is getNodeChildDetails is not called after this rowData change, so there is no way to expand the tender and see the new bid -- search the log for '==== getNodeChildDetails for record 64' and there will only be one match.  (Note that if you expand this log line after creating the bid, it will show the current state of the object as containing the bid)\n\nThanks for looking!. ",

Additionally we translate all the columns.\nHere's what I came up with (using angular and typescript). All of it is an GridService. The only drawback I faced so far was that I have to return GridOptions and not Observable<GridOptions>. \nMy plan was to get the template first and upon receiving it return the GridOptions as an Observable. Unfortunately this did not work because ag-grids initialization was already finished before and so my \nonGridReady Event was never called. But since I can only access the api (to set filter etc.) from within this event I need this event.\nWe use IDatasource as a datasource\nI left out our column translations.

If you know a better way tell me :). but what happened to #1982 ?\nI'm using angular cli and ejecting the whole webpack config just to color the svg icons is not an option. ok, maybe it completly missunderstood. sorry if that's the case.\nI thought the line background-image: url('#{$ag-mat-icons-path}#{$icon}.svg?color=#{encodecolor($ag-mat-icon-color)}'); is CSS/SASS Code and not something for webpack,. We did the following to achieve it without writing a a filter and renderer from scratch which would be 99% identical.\nBe aware that this is rather \"hacky\" way with fiddling with the prototype but it works in our case.\nAnd it is an all or nothing solution meaning you either have dateTime on all DateFilter or on none which is fine for our application but might not work for you.\nIf I remember correctly you would also need to create a custom datetime filter if you want to display/filter the dates in another locale than your browser uses.

The problem you describe is due to the way scoped styles work in Angular. Since ag-Grid is agnostic to the platform and creates DOM elements not through the Angular 2 API, the scoping attribute does not work for its contents. \nOne way to work around the problem would be through the ::ng-deep selector:\n```scss\n$ag-icons-path: '~/ag-grid/src/styles/icons';\n:host /deep/ {\n    @import \"~ag-grid/src/styles/ag-grid.scss\";\n    @import \"~ag-grid/src/styles/theme-fresh.scss\";\n}\n```\nthis seems to work when I tested it. Notice however, that /deep/ and ::ng-deep is deprecated. . Thank you, confirming the bug (repro). . Hi, \nthe workaround you suggest is actually described in our documentation since this is a common pitfall in with Sass / Webpack. \n\nThe ag grid icons path should be re-adjusted when importing the scss file. This is a common problem, described in the Sass(scss) loader project. The theme exposes the $ag-mat-icons-path variable to address that.

Notice: the feature will be available in the enterprise version of the grid. . Correct, closing this one - you can track #1956.. Hi, the issue should be fixed in the next release, due in a week or two. If the problem persists after that, please provide a reproduction of it. Thank you. . Related to AG-942. There are several cases where this just won't work and break existing setups. Closing. . Hey, \nyou can use suppressSizeToFit to select which of the columns are going to be adjusted - won't this work for you? . What you describe is possible. As per the issue template, please don't post support queries here. Use either stackoverflow.com, or if you're an Enterprise customer you can also use our Members Forum here: https://ag-grid.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?fid=5. Hi, \nThank you for the report. I have raised AG-958 for the item, our dev team will review it. . Hi, \nI logged this as  AG-957, our dev team will review it and update the status here.. I am not sure what you expect by setting the sort in the default options. Any chance you are looking for the sortingOrder option?. Hey,\nfrom what I gather, you are actually looking for a specific node - it this so? Because in that case, findNode API might be more appropriate. Let me know what you think. . Sorry for the confusion; such API method does not exist currently. I am proposing it as a potential enhancement we may look into, if it makes sense to you.. In the multiple nodes case, how would you \n\nI would like it to stop If reached the desired node.\n?. There is no PR. I will log it as a backlog item in the internal tracker (AG-983). . This does not seem like a known issue. We will need a reproduction of it in order to help you further. . Hi @dennispg - I searched for ag-material-theme in our docs repository, could not find any place where we refer to it like this - can you point me to the wrong example so that I can fix it? Thank you.\n\nApart from that, you should use only class=\"ag-theme-material\". . Hey,\ncan you check this sample repo: https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid-material/tree/master/custom-sizing - if I understand you correctly, it should address your query. . Thank you! We are actually looking into simplifying this, so that the dimensions can be controlled only by setting the sass variables. Setting both is quite counter-intuitive. . Thank you for the report. I have logged the issue as AG-974 in our internal tracker. The dev team will review it. . It looks like you are re-applying the filter storage before the data is set. You should try restoring it once the data is there; you can use the dataChanged event for that purpose. . Hi, \nthe ag-grid website itself is hosted on a linux OS. The grid component is a client-side only library, so the server OS itself is unlikely to affect its behavior. The problem might be related to a web server configuration, though. \nTo get further assistance with the matter, I may suggest that you post your question in our forum. We will look into it further. . Thank you very much for the details - they should be useful if anyone stumbles upon the same problem. Closing this. . Hey, \ncan you replicate the issue in a plunker? . Hi, \nwe are aware of the issue (AG-849), it is already fixed and the fix will be part of our next release.. Hey, \nThanks for that, https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid/commit/d4afd5aab4b80e919ec3ed63b197c06c0c76ed6c is addressing it. You can also update your override to $primary-color meanwhile. . Hi, \nthank you, I pushed the same fix before checking what you have submitted. . Thank you for the report and reproduction, I have logged this as  AG-1197, we will look into it. . This is addressed in v17.0.0. Hey, what's the intent of this pull request?. - you need the loader to customize the icon colours. see the repo @jzahka linked.\n- Indeed, the header background color is not customizable in the material theme. The material specs themselves do not suggest different colors for headers. You might tweak that through a css selector, though.\n- check the floatingFiltersHeight property in the docs.\nPlease file your bug reports as a separate issues, that would help us addressing them better. Thanks. . @sumcoding you can edit the svg files manually and change the colors in there. Of course, any sort of file preprocessing can do that for you.. #1982 refers to the svg-webpack-loader implementation - not sure what you mean by referring to it. \nIf you can afford to support the latest browsers only, then you can also change the colors of the icons using filters over the icon class. This is what I tried initially when implementing the SVG icons. However, it is hard to achieve exact colors with this method. It also does not work well in old IE.. Hi, \nUnless I am missing something, using the file in question is not optimal - you are unlikely to use all themes in your project.  Can you clarify your use case? Perhaps we can do something that's documented and serves it better. \nThank you,. From what I see, I had some intentions for this file which I never implemented - it is not used anywhere, so it's better to remove it to avoid confusion. \nGiven your case, I do recommend using the themes manually. Each theme gets its set of icons embedded, so if you import them all, you get ~200k of unused styles to your project, which slows down the rendering. . Hi, \nyes, the clipboard is an enterprise feature. Consult the docs for more details, the enterprise features have red marker in the menu.. The problem was fixed in 16.0.1. \ud83d\udc4d Thank you, addressed that. Rawgit seems to be caching the 404, but I guess it will restore the files soon. . Thank you, we cleaned that up.. Pushed a fix for that, will be addressed in the next release.. Why don't you try using the :hover pseudoclass?. The example from our documentation seems to work as expected in IE 11. Can you confirm this on your side?. Closing due to lack of activity / reproduction. . Thanks for the report - the fix is quite simple, you can add the rule from 08093e5 to your styles as a temporary measure. . ag-Grid itself works as expected in IE 11. The particular demo does not, due some weird combination of Angular, base href and template loading - SystemJS is suspected as well. \nAs you may guess, pinpointing the exact problem is somewhat hard. Most  of the documentation should work in IE 11, but the complex angular examples like this one suffer from that issue. . Thanks for the report, we addressed that in https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid/commit/40a76f5c3a7dbf5913c886a22979c21701a3d98e - should be fixed in the next release. . Hi, \nI can't replicate that on the demos. Please provide a reproduction so that we can examine it - once such is present, we will reopen the issue. . Thank you. I am afraid that this seems like a fairly complex example - can you please simplify it to something simpler? You can use plunker for that purpose. Alternatively, you can compare your implementation to this example, where filtering \"gold\" by 4 includes the right records. . Thanks for raising this, you are correct. An in-depth discussion about the correct icons can be found here: https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/37564/use-up-or-down-arrow-to-represent-sort-ascending-at-table-header \nI am logging this as AG-1691 in our internal bug tracker.. Thanks for the heads up @tflavin - you are correct. Fixing this.. Hi, \nthe posted plunker seems unfinished and does not result in the error you refer to. Any chance you did not save it? . Thank you. The behavior is expected - you can't return dates from a cell renderer. This is described in the cell renderer documentation section. . Hi, \nthe details are listed in the description of the forum:\n\nWe have moved our Support system to a new Zendesk instance. Please post all new tickets in that system, for any access issues, please contact info@ag-grid.com.\n\n. ",

It seems that the bean is wired and initialized before the elements are available in the DOM. Is there a way to disable loading of ag-checkbox bean altogether?. @petyosi I resolved the issue by polyfilling the constructor.name property in IE.

We've added a check for innerRendererFramework that was missing:\nprivate addValueElement(): void {\n        let params = this.params;\n        let rowNode = this.displayedGroup;\n        if (rowNode.footer) {\n            this.createFooterCell();\n        } else if (rowNode.group ||\n                   _.get(params.colDef, 'cellRendererParams.innerRenderer', null) ||\n                   // OUR LINE OF CODE TO FIX THIS BUG ADDED BELOW\n                   _.get(params.colDef, 'cellRendererParams.innerRendererFramework', null) \n        ) {\n            this.createGroupCell();\n            if (rowNode.group){\n                this.addChildCount();\n            }\n        } else {\n            this.createLeafCell();\n        }\n    }\nCurrent behavior:\nWhen addValueElement() is called, a check is done for innerRenderer. When innerRenderer is not found (because innerRendererFramework is being implemented instead), this.createLeafCell() is called and the cell is rendered not as a React Component, but by assigning the value as a string to the innerHTML of the cell.\nSee: \nprivate createLeafCell(): void {\n        if (_.exists(this.params.value)) {\n            this.eValue.innerHTML = this.params.value;\n        }\n    }\nExpected behavior:\nWhen addValueElement() is called, a check is additionally done for innerRendererFramework and this.createGroupCell() gets called and renders the specified React Component.\n.

    "instantaphex": "@skow4 I'm not sure if this will help, but I was having the same issue and was able to resolve it.  My setup is slightly different (Angular 5), but I was adding the doesDataFlower function after the gridReady event.  At one point this worked for me, but stopped at some point after some ugprades to ag-grid.\n  After debugging through ag-grid source I realized that ag-grid was using that function when building the row nodes and that if it wasn't set before grid initialization, it wouldn't work.  Once I made sure the function was set before initialization of the grid, it worked perfectly.. I was able to get a small improvement by bootstrapping my application inside a zone that blacklisted all undesired effects from running change detection, but that is really only half the problem.   As @milleraundra mentioned, the act of creating the events and executing the callbacks themselves starts dropping the frame rate even when no change detection is occurring (mostly only noticeable in IE11... which is what my users use).  \nA few things:\n1.) I'm really curious why ag-grid needs to add and remove 'ag-grid-hover' classes over and over.  Why not just use the :hover pseudo-class for styling?  This would be a step in the right direction in terms of IE performance.  \nrowComp.js line 955 (v14.2):\nRowComp.prototype.addHoverFunctionality = function (eRow) {\n        var _this = this;\n        // because we use animation frames to do this, it's possible the row no longer exists\n        // by the time we get to add it\n        if (!this.active) {\n            return;\n        }\n        // because mouseenter and mouseleave do not propagate, we cannot listen on the gridPanel\n        // like we do for all the other mouse events.\n        // because of the pinning, we cannot simply add / remove the class based on the eRow. we\n        // have to check all eRow's (body & pinned). so the trick is if any of the rows gets a\n        // mouse hover, it sets such in the rowNode, and then all three reflect the change as\n        // all are listening for event on the row node.\n        // step 1 - add listener, to set flag on row node\n        this.addDestroyableEventListener(eRow, 'mouseenter', function () { return _this.rowNode.onMouseEnter(); });\n        this.addDestroyableEventListener(eRow, 'mouseleave', function () { return _this.rowNode.onMouseLeave(); });\n        // step 2 - listen for changes on row node (which any eRow can trigger)\n        this.addDestroyableEventListener(this.rowNode, rowNode_1.RowNode.EVENT_MOUSE_ENTER, function () {\n            utils_1._.addCssClass(eRow, 'ag-row-hover');\n        });\n        this.addDestroyableEventListener(this.rowNode, rowNode_1.RowNode.EVENT_MOUSE_LEAVE, function () {\n            utils_1._.removeCssClass(eRow, 'ag-row-hover');\n        });\n    };\nNow, I'm not sure if adding and removing the ag-row-hover is for compatability reasons, but IE has had :hover for  elements since 4.0 and for all elements since 7.0. \n2.) Things like this could be opt-in:\ngridPanel.js line 305 (v14.2)\nGridPanel.prototype.addMouseListeners = function () {\n        var _this = this;\n        var eventNames = ['click', 'mousedown', 'dblclick', 'contextmenu', 'mouseover', 'mouseout'];\n        eventNames.forEach(function (eventName) {\n            var listener = _this.processMouseEvent.bind(_this, eventName);\n            _this.eAllCellContainers.forEach(function (container) {\n                return _this.addDestroyableEventListener(container, eventName, listener);\n            });\n        });\n    };\nI would assume that for most use cases, it's wholly unnecessary to create blanket event listeners for all of these and broadcast them out:\ncellComp.js line 688 (v14.2)\nCellComp.prototype.onMouseOut = function (mouseEvent) {\n        var cellMouseOutEvent = this.createEvent(mouseEvent, events_1.Events.EVENT_CELL_MOUSE_OUT);\n        this.beans.eventService.dispatchEvent(cellMouseOutEvent);\n    };\n    CellComp.prototype.onMouseOver = function (mouseEvent) {\n        var cellMouseOverEvent = this.createEvent(mouseEvent, events_1.Events.EVENT_CELL_MOUSE_OVER);\n        this.beans.eventService.dispatchEvent(cellMouseOverEvent);\n    };\nMaybe there is some functionality in ag grid that hinges on this to work properly.  Either way I saw performance gains by commenting this type of thing out locally.\n. So I've managed to get rid of the functionality, albeit in an awful way.  After seeing @catahoc solution in another github issue, I've created this ugly hack:\n```\nimport { GridPanel, CellComp, RowComp } from 'ag-grid';\n/ tslint:disable /\n(function () {\n  (GridPanel.prototype as any).addMouseListeners = function () {\n    var _this = this;\n    var eventNames = ['click', 'mousedown', 'dblclick', 'contextmenu'];\n    eventNames.forEach(function (eventName) {\n      var listener = _this.processMouseEvent.bind(_this, eventName);\n      _this.eAllCellContainers.forEach(function (container) {\n         return _this.addDestroyableEventListener(container, eventName, listener);\n      });\n    });\n  };\n  (CellComp.prototype as any).onMouseOut = function (mouseEvent) { };\n  (CellComp.prototype as any).onMouseOver = function (mouseEvent) { };\n  (RowComp.prototype as any).addHoverFunctionality = function (eRow) { };\n})();\n/ tslint:enable /\n```\nIf you're not using TypeScript you won't need the ( as any) stuff.. Im running before the angular app bootstraps.  If you're not using angular\nyou can just run it before your ag-grid code.  Also im running my app in a\nzone that blacklists ag-grid scroll events from running change detection.\nThat was also dropping my frame rate pretty badly.  I can post that on\nMonday if you need it.\nOne other thing that made a HUGE difference for me in I was making sure\nthat the container housing the grid doesn't have a border radius on it.\nThat actually sped it up more than any single other thing I did.  It's\napparently a known bug in IE.\nOn Nov 22, 2017 1:43 PM, \"Aundra Miller\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n@instantaphex https://github.com/instantaphex where are you running this\ncode?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid/issues/2034#issuecomment-346454677,\nor mute\nthe thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AF3t33pLc_EVy44fiiIRyTrTRn-uU9Vrks5s5Hl5gaJpZM4QRuAq\n.\n.

However, since it seems that the problem will not be fixed, I have had to remove my onColumnResized() to get normal behavior again, but if the user resizes a column, the horizontal scrollbar appears (since sizeColumnsToFit() is not being called).\n.

grid is created.\nAlso if there is no native ResizeObserver, using a simple timer loop like ag-grid < 18 did would keep the event feature available without the cost of MutationObserver.\n. still

I'm encountering what seems to be the same error as the original, but haven't found a suitable polyfill yet.\nUpdate\nFor anyone stumbling across this thread and looking for solutions to try, we found that our webpack configuration was causing (or exposing?) the issue. We use a pattern similar to the one outlined in the webpack documents. Moving the ag-grid dependencies from outside the vendor package and into our application package is a workaround. I don't have a reasonable explanation as to why this fixed it for us, but I have a feeling that one of the dependencies we have (possibly babel-polyfill) was incorrectly being applied to this package.\nHope that helps anyone with a similar issue. Would still be interested to see if there's a cleaner way with the constructor.name polyfill mentioned above, but I didn't have much luck in finding it..

",
    "UselessPickles": "This is a duplicate of https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid/issues/1889, which was INCORRECTLY CLOSED! This is a bug that needs to be fixed.\nThe problem is that IComponent.afterGuiAttached specifies the param as optional, but the implementation of the interface method in Component is NOT marked as optional.\nI believe the correct solution is to NOT mark the param as optional in the interface.\nThis is part of a widespread problem I have noticed: params in many interface methods and event handler methods are marked as optional when they should be expected to always have a value (not null, not undefined). I think there is a misunderstanding of what an \"optional\" parameter means. \"optional\" means that a value may not be passed in to calls to the method in some usages of the method. \nAs another example, ALL of the events in GridOptions have the \"event\" param marked as optional. Why is the event optional? That is THE key piece of information that tells me what happened when I handle the event!  Because the event is marked as optional, when using \"strict-null-checks\" compiler option, I now have to perform null checks on the \"event\" in every event handler before accessing properties of the event, even though I'm pretty sure that the event will never be null/undefined. And what do I do in my null-check branch of code in case the event ever is null? The documentation does not describe any situation where the event is null, so I don't know how to handle it.\nI think the best way to resolve these issues is for the ag-grid team to start compiling the project with the TypeScript \"strict\" option enabled, and revisit ALL of the optional params in interface method signatures. If the intent is that a value will ALWAYS be provided for a param when the method is called (e.g., \"event\" param on event handlers), then the param should NOT be marked as optional.. @JohnMasterson We are currently evaluating ag-grid and considering purchasing an Enterprise license, but this one issue is really causing us problems. It's forcing us to disable \"strictNullChecks\" on our entire Typescript project, which prevents us from catching preventable errors in our own code at compile time.\nI see that AG-980 is currently in the \"backlog\", not targeted for any upcoming release. Would it be possible to fast-track a minimal solution to this particular compiler error (when attempting to USE ag-grid in a project with strictNullChecks), separate from solving all of the internal problems that arise when attempting compile the ag-grid project itself with structNullChecks?\nIf we could compile our project with strictNullChecks while using ag-grid, then it would be much easier to decide to choose ag-grid for our project.. Looks like this is already fixed in v14.1.1. I forked this repo, enabled the \"strict\" compiler option, and started working through all of the null/undefined issues in the ag-grid source code. \nOne major issue that I can't solve without assistance is the Component.getHtmlElement() method in src/ts/widgets/component.ts. The method returns null if called \" before gui was attached\". Changing the signature to support returning null quickly reveals that many usages of the method simply assume that the result is non-null. This seems like a situation where getHtmlElement() should throw an error instead of returning null. Otherwise, several methods will need too perform null checks, and in turn return null if the getHtmlElement() is null. Then all callers of all those methods will have to be updated to handle a null result. This is a massive ripple effect for handling a critical error condition.\nCan I get a recommendation from someone familiar with the project on whether it would be appropriate for getHtmlElement() to throw an error instead of returning null? Is that really an error condition that is intended to be \"recoverable\" by returning null? If not, then throwing an error would greatly simplify the code by guaranteeing the method never returns null.\nOr is it more appropriate to update some of the usages of getHtmlElement() that currently ASSUME a non-null result to perform a null check and throw an error?\nAnother possibility is to implement 2 versions of the method: one that may return null, another that is guaranteed to never return null, and will throw if the element is null. But what is the use case for the version that may return null? Is that only necessary internally, such that it can be private? And the public method throws instead of returning null?\nIt's hard for me to know what's right without being intimately familiar with the design of this code.. This is getting pretty hopeless for me to fix myself. For example, RowNode.id, RowNode.rowHeight, etc, are set to null in some situations. There is plenty of code that assumes those properties are not null. How to fix the code to deal with those properties being potentially null is unclear, especially when there are mathematical calculations/comparisons involving RowNode.rowHeight, which may be null, but the existing code ignores that possibility.\nI think someone that understands this codebase well needs to simply enable the \"strict\" compiler option, then work through all the compiler errors a few at a time. You will discover some bad assumptions in the code, and will need to make non-trivial decisions about how to handle null/undefined values. There's probably a few nasty bugs hiding in there that will be fixed by updating the code to pass a \"strict\" compile.\nAlso, FYI, the .exists() method is quite useless, because the compiler does not recognize it as guaranteeing that the param is not null. In most cases, at least for non-string types, it's much better to simply test the variable directly (test if == or != null, with double instead of triple equal to handle both null and undefined) without using .exists() so that the compiler is aware that you performed a null check.. > If you know a property is actually not null/undefined in some context, you\ncan simply use ! (As in instance!.property).\nThat should really only be used sparingly in situations where you are 100% sure that it is (and always should be after future code refactors/changes) impossible to reach that code in a way that the property/param/var is null. It's not a general solution to this problem.\nThe general problem is that this code base has completely lost control/knowledge of when things are allowed to be null and what it means, how to behave when things are null. \nIf the goal was to simply make the code pass \"strict\" compilation, then we could scatter usages of \"!\" everywhere to just make the compiler stop complaining. But the whole point of strict compilation is that it forces you to be aware of when you are dealing with possibly null things, and at every single place where a value may be null, a proper decision needs to be made as to how to handle  the possibly null value. The compiler \"strict\" compiler errors often reveal potential bugs.. I created a pull request to fix the \"sortModel\" portion of this issue. The structure of a \"filterModel\" is less obvious to me right now, so I thought it was best to tackle it separately later.. @makinggoodsoftware I see that AG-1231 is currently in the \"backlog\" of \"Complex Feature Requests\"\nThat sounds to me like it may get ignored and not fixed for a very long time. Is there any way to make this a higher priority? At least for the \"sortModel\" portion, which seems like the more obvious/simpler of the two and already has a good starting point with my pull request.\nThe \"Complex Feature Requests\" categorization also baffles me. This is not really a feature request at all because it's not a request for any new behavior, and it's not really complex. The end result should be absolutely no change in executable/observable behavior. The only complexity is getting the strict null typing correct, which goes along with AG-980. . This looks like a duplicate of: https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid/issues/1979\nSee also, this comment in a related issue: https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid/issues/1976#issuecomment-339294971. Current workaround is to use null asserts for things that are incorrectly marked optional, but you know for sure will/should never be null:\nts\nconst model = gridOptions.api!.getModel();. Actualy, this might subtly be not related to the other issue(s) I referenced. GridOptions is the interface for the input for a grid's options. \"api\" is a special property that you should never provide as an option to a grid. It is initialized by the grid itself. So it has to be optional to avoid forcing you to provide an api to a grid. This seems like a hack to me. Why is \"api\" in the GridOptions interface at all?. Closing this PR because it clearly is never being reviewed by anyone or merged.. \"params\" is now potentially undefined in this code. A null-check should be necessary now.\nOr is it more correct to change the signature of this method in IComponent to make the param non-optional? Is it really optional?. Copying my comment from other related places. This requires a decision from someone that understands the codebase and the intended design of this interface method:\nThere are 2 \"solutions\" that fix the compiler error:\n\nUpdate the signature of IComponent.afterGuiAttached to make \"params\" NON-optional.\nUpdate the signature of the method Component.afterGuiAttached to make \"params\" OPTIONAL, and update the implementation to handle the fact that \"params\" may be undefined.\n\nWhich is actually the correct solution? Is \"params\" truly optional? Or will a non-undefined/null value always be passed to the method?. This may be a bad name for this interface. A \"sort model\" is technically an array of these. Any suggestion for a better name for this interface? Maybe ISortDef?. ",

Any word on a resolution for this? . We would like to use the new Tree Data Grid available in v14 but we're blocked by a broken richSelect in other parts of our app. And of course, we're on a deadline. :)\nSo we just need to know if this is being addressed any time soon so we can make some decisions. Looking forward to a response from your team. Thanks.. ComponentResolver.prototype.createAgGridComponent, (componentResolver.js line 176), gets hit twice in the process of creating renderers for a cell that is activating a RichSelect dropdown. \n\nThe first time through, a RichSelectCellEditor gets created successfully. \nThe second time through, it attempts to create a cellRenderer, but unsuccessfully. \n\nIn componentProvider.js, do you expect ComponentProvider.prototype.retrieve to return null when passing in \"cellRenderer\"? This seems to be the beginning of the end for cellRendererPromise ultimately being null.  \nIn CellRendererService.prototype.useRichSelectCellRenderer, cellRendererPromise resolves to null on the second pass (cellRendererService.js line 62):\nThen it hits the else block where it doesn't make a lot of sense to modify the eTarget.innerText if the block ultimately returns the null cellRendererPromise. \n```\nCellRendererService.prototype.useRichSelectCellRenderer = function (target, eTarget, params) {\n        var cellRendererPromise = this.componentRecipes.newCellRenderer(target.cellEditorParams, params); //  this resolves to null\n        if (cellRendererPromise != null) {\n            this.bindToHtml(cellRendererPromise, eTarget);\n        }\n        else {\n            eTarget.innerText = params.valueFormatted != null ? params.valueFormatted : params.value;\n        }\n        return cellRendererPromise; //  this is null\n    };\n```\nI need someone with better knowledge of the internal workings to take a look at this. . @seanlandsman Thanks for the communication. \n@ceolter Thanks for the workaround and forthcoming fix. We look forward to it. \nFeels so much better knowing there's life on planet ag-grid! \ud83d\ude80 . Heads up, there is another scenario where this error returns. Just want to make sure the fix you've applied works when using a cellRendererFramework component in combination with cellEditor: 'richSelect'. This combination below produces the same error: \n```\n{ headerName: \"Related\", field: \"related\",\n          cellRendererFramework: BooleanRendererComponent,\n          cellStyle: {\"text-align\": \"center\"},\n          cellEditor: 'richSelect',\n          cellEditorParams: {\n            values: [false, true]\n          }\n      },\n```\n@ceolter 's workaround does not work for duplication reasons. \nPlease reply. . @seanlandsman do you have an ETA on release that will include a fix for this? \nWill it also address using cellRendererFramework in conjunction with cellEditor: 'richSelect'? \nThanks. .

    "bgaillard": "Hi, we also encounter this problem with Angular 5 and Ag-Grid 14.x. \nAs per the changelog https://www.ag-grid.com/change-log/changeLogIndex.php it seems that the afterGuiAttached() method has been removed for Cell Renderers. \n\nIn v13.0 we introduced the method afterGuiAttached() for the cell renderers. The purpose of this was to allow cell renderers to be created before the DOM existed which gave a marginal performance boost. This has caused issues for frameworks like React and Angular (which sometimes need the parent DOM element to exist before the component is created). For this reason we have reverted back to how things worked prior to v13.0.\nSo in summary, v13.0 introduced afterGuiAttached(), v13.1 takes afterGuiAttached() back out.\n\nWe can also see this in the commits associated to version 1.13.1 here https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid/commits/13.1.0. \nThe changelog indicates that the change is associated to Cell Renderers. But in our case the problem is associated to Grid Filters (i.e AgFilterComponent).\nPerhaps the change in v 13.1.0 makes a bug appear here ?\nAlso in our case we used afterGuiAttached to retrieve a reference to the hidePopup function. \ntypescript\npublic afterGuiAttached?(params?: IAfterGuiAttachedParams): void {\n        // Backups the hide popup callback function\n        this.hidePopupCallback = params.hidePopup;\n}\nBecause afterGuiAttached is not called anymore we cannot get a reference to the function, so now we are forced to do \"ugly\" things like that to close the popup.\n```typescript\n/*\n * Function used to hide the popup associated to the filter.\n /\nprivate hidePopup(): void {\n// WARNING: This is an \"ugly\" workaroung needed because we updated Ag-Grid and it seems a bug prevent the \n//          'afterGuiAttached(...)' function to be called. As a consequence we cannot get the 'hidePopup()' \n//          callback function provided by the Ag-Grid framework.\n//\n// see https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid/issues/2044\n$('body').click();\n\n}\n```\nCan anybody from the Ag-Grid team help us on this ? Why afterGuiAttached is not called ? Is this a wanted behavior ?\nThanks,\nBaptiste. Hi @makinggoodsoftware, ok great, thanks a lot for your reactivity on this case !. ",

If I want to use the transaction update method (updateRowData), I have to pass a transaction object so I'd like to make sure it complies with RowDataTransaction's interface.. I happen to have the exact same problem as @jeghers . I suppose I could fix it by calling sizeColumnsToFit on viewportchanged but this seems like it shouldn't be necessary...\nMoreover, doing this actually trigger the resizing after the scrollbars have already appeared and so the horizontal scrollbar flashes a fraction of a second before disappearing.\nIt would maybe be possible to remember that the columns are marked as 'sizetofit' and resize them when data changes? Or even better, as @jeghers said, have a transparent overlay scrollbar... Hello,\nI understand. Although this is not really a feature request as much as a bug to fix, in my opinion.\nI would be willing to try to submit a PR for this if you want. Would that be ok?.

Where is the suggested solution exactly?. My own solution for now to prevent selection temporarily is to wrap cellrenderer into a div with special click action:\n```\n\npreventGridSelection() {\n    const previousValue = this.params.node.gridOptionsWrapper.gridOptions.suppressRowClickSelection;\n    this.params.node.gridOptionsWrapper.gridOptions.suppressRowClickSelection = true;\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      this.params.node.gridOptionsWrapper.gridOptions.suppressRowClickSelection = previousValue;\n    });\n  }\n```. Thanks, I appreciate it. I've noticed that recent release (19.1.1) indeed added missing types (ValueFormatterParams), so that's a start.\nThe gist of my problem is that a lot of ag-grid usecases is to display data in a certain way in a row, that:\n- is not just regular string\n- is often simple enough, that it's hard to justify the overhead of creating and using whole new renderer component for it\n- is not just a regular function returning string, as this way you lose all the power of angular templating\nI've asked about it here - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48954875/using-ng-template-as-cellrenderer-in-ag-grid-angular-5/ - but noone knew of any solution.\nI've touched the issue some time ago here - https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid-angular/issues/198, but without any conclusion.\nI'd say this is about 80% of cases in my projects. The end result, currently, is dozens of custom cellrenderers in a project. A lot of this cases could be handled by providing just angular template (or reference to such, defined in the same html as where the ag-grid resides, using the power of ng-template) or a pipe evaluation. I understand that there's value in having framework-agnostic library, but in reality, people are using ag-grid together with a framework of their choice - so it seems natural to provide additional support for most popular ones. Perhaps you could reuse cellRenderFramework property by providing a generic, configurable component there, that would accept angular pipe or template?\nFor example/reference, the best grid for AngularJS (http://ui-grid.info/) has this (http://ui-grid.info/docs/#!/api/ui.grid.class:GridOptions.columnDef#properties_cellclass) - you could specify either the class of the renderer to instatiate (cellClass), the filter (old name for pipe) evaluation to use (cellFilter) or the template reference (cellTemplate). . That's what I'm currently doing in order to kind of fit the usage of Angular's pipes, but it's far from ideal. And it still does not solve the main issue of not being able to provide an actual angular template (with, say, row and value properties bound), without the overhead of creating a whole new component. \nWithout the support for pipes and inline templating, ag-grid in Angular feels a bit like a forced addition. It's agnostic, but because of that it's also alien enough. The usage pattern is very clunky, because it doesn't take advantage of many things that are common in Angular environment - and while there are workarounds, they bring a significant overhead with them, that (I feel) could be avoided.. Thank you, that's very promising! Any chance for inline templating / template references in the future?. Thank you! I appreciate it a lot. I feel this will significantly improve ag-grid for Angular!.

If you expand the row programmatically it works fine. After all this wasted time I\u2019m extremely annoyed at the terrible state of ag grid documentation and non existent support. . Also had this issue, the key here is that updateRowData expects the row objects by reference (must pass === check). So you cannot just create an object with identical properties to the row and use that in the updateRowData transaction. You have to manually loop thru EVERY row using forEachNode, check for the properties you need, then pass that node.data in the transaction.

    "cwhaught": "I am seeing a similar issue.\nAs soon as I start importing the scss files, as opposed to the css files, the $accent-color is ignored for svg icons.. I did some further investigation into the issue for my project and the example Angular Material project appears to work but is a but disingenuous in my opinion.\nThat project located at https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid-material defines a column and checkbox renderer in order to use Angular Material's theme variables in order to override the icon color, not ag's variables. \nThis obviously severely limits how to use the grid api as publish as the developer now has to handle all rendering of icons, instead of depending on ag-grid to do that for me as the documentation indicates.. I believe I am seeing a variation of this as well.\nI am using height: 100%; width: 100%; and now have to scroll to see the sidebar.\nAs far as I can tell it is due to this commit.\nhttps://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid/commit/3717aa950f1eeb9ad9a996ccd1c2c6266a0cee87#diff-5c4c51f7c1194bc5345fffb50464d1f0\nWhere width: 0px; was removed from .ag-layout-normal. @makinggoodsoftware will this be fixed in AG Grid or will we all have to implement a similar solution to the ones mentioned above?\nIf so can we get this fix added to the AG Grid repo?.

    "aryanisml": "\nFinally figured out a way to override the theme SVG icon's color without having to create a whole new set of SVG icons. You don't have to create a brand new theme as well.\nBy the way a lot of the themes have this $icon-color parameter, but this parameter is not being used at all by the svg implementations. Therefore don't try it.\nSample scss file would like this.\n```\n//overwrite all the variables you want.. etc etc...\n//The order you import the theme is very important\n//Import the themes first\n@import '~ag-grid/src/styles/ag-theme-bootstrap.scss';\n@import '~ag-grid/src/styles/ag-grid.scss';\n//Then overwrite the icon-background mixin like such:\n@mixin icon-background( $icon) {\n  -webkit-mask: url(\"#{$icons-path}#{$icon}.svg\") no-repeat center;\n  mask: url(\"#{$icons-path}#{$icon}.svg\") no-repeat center;\n  -webkit-mask-size: contain;\n  mask-size: contain;\n  background-color: white;\n  background: white;\n  background-size: 14px 14px;\n  display: inline-block;\n}\n/ icons are used outside of the grid root (in the ghost) /\n$icons: aggregation arrows asc checkbox-checked-readonly checkbox-checked checkbox-indeterminate-readonly checkbox-indeterminate checkbox-unchecked-readonly checkbox-unchecked\n  column columns contracted copy cut desc expanded eye-slash eye filter group indeterminate left loading menu minus none not-allowed paste pin pivot plus right small-left\n  small-right small-up small-down tick cross tree-open tree-closed tree-indeterminate;\n@each $icon in $icons {\n  //replace .ag-theme-bootstrap with target theme.\n  .ag-theme-bootstrap .ag-icon-#{$icon} {\n      @include icon-background(\"#{$icon}\");\n  }\n}\n```\nI also posted the solution on https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid/issues/1982\n\nIcons changes only with chrome browser it not worked with edge or IE browser..

I can now confirm that rolling back to ag grid 17.0.0 and changing the following means we can see the grid in all three of the listed browsers:\nrowmodel back to enterprise,\nIEnterpriseRequest as the interface for params.request\ndatasource instantiation back to: params.api.setEnterpriseDatasource(this.dataSource);. I believe you can trigger this using the gridApi, though a simpler approach may be to just call this.gridApi.purgeEnterpriseCache(); Which will reload all of the available items. You could of course use a service injected in angular 6 that uses a behavior subject that all of your components listen to for actions though this can be quite costly if you have a lot of components. You could also refresh the cell or row if you setup methods that take the row index and then go and deal with each individually. If you provide a MCVE I could get back to you with some help.. Duplicate of #2457 I raised this issue via enterprise \nAG-1876 | Animation example doesn't work for Angular and React in the website | DONE\n-- | -- | --\nLooks like they've fixed whatever issue is causing the new version to break on anything but chrome..\n. Why version of the grid are you using? If your using Angular, React or Vue some features of the grid will not work.. Can you make a small reproduce able example? plunker stackblitz etc you can use an example from the ag grid website to start from.. If your instance of ag grid is instantiated directly in your state then this will always happen, if you want it to call a method you can either register a custom component with it's own set of actions or use a value setter with a callback. Could you provide a MCVE and I could try to narrow down something to help you :-). The sorting is done on the clientside for a couple of the different models, for instance if your using just pagination or the standard model you will have clientside sorting and filtering be default. In the enterprise row model or rather as it's called now the serverSide model is supposed to be used with pagination via either infinite scroll or with page number pagination. Both of which generally require further calls to the server for more information when the amount of items set are less than the set of available items.\nEssentially why you don't want client sorting is the following scenario:\nI Initially load 30 items of an available 300 items, there ordered by id. Now when I sort by id I'm expecting to find record 300 as this has the furthest away index and I know this as my gird is telling me how many items it can load using the count.\nbut in your scenario your just flipping the 30 available items which is unexpected behavior.\nIf you could include more information about which framework your using and your given scenario I could maybe point you towards ways you could optimize either your content delivery or grid settings.. Typically in a serverside environment we'll want to keep calling the Serverside when loading data in case our datasets have changed since we last used them, your feature request will only work for a small % of people who use the grid (enterprise wise anyways, not sure about community), though what your saying is achievable already using the grid api and replacing the controls with custom ones that call methods that affect the gridApi, for instance flipping the dataset can be achieved like this without causing a serverside refresh..

Reminds me of posting my progress...\nFor me the issue remained when I removed the sizeColumnsToFit() method (maybe @stepet80 his solution fixes this).\nThe real solution, for my environment, was to declare a certain height on the wrapping container.

Then the grid would do weird things like not showing any rows as the height cannet be retrieved or something like that.... ",

The spinner is shown by the grid and should be hidden by it. What else is there to do on a failed response? Try? No problem, the grid will show the spinner again. Anyway, that's my 2 cents on the matter.. You need set a higher z-index to the filter panel and your popup z-index. It can be simply done via css.\nBtw, this is definitly not an issue and you should have posted on stack-overflow. What about event \"columnResized\"? Have you also tried that?
