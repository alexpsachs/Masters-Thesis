    "ryanoasis": "I will take a look when I get a chance thanks. :disappointed: \nHave you tried any of the other fonts in gvim?\n. Looks like in my haste I forgot something for the first set of glyphs in the script that scales things properly based on the source font em.\nI will do more testing but I think this will fix it, see below the before and after:\n\n. Should be fixed :smiley: \nlet me know if you still have issues, if not I will close or feel free to close yourself\n. That's interesting thanks. Should be possible to add to the patcher but I'll have to look into it\n. update: I did add this glyph to the branch i'm currently working on (not quiter ready for master). So far seems to be working well\n. working now as of: 6c6ef8ef0ca382efbd39bd709007e6ee8f64edbf\n. working now as of: 6c6ef8ef0ca382efbd39bd709007e6ee8f64edbf\n. \n. working now as of: 6c6ef8ef0ca382efbd39bd709007e6ee8f64edbf\n. @blueyed yeah that is something I was aware of but I guess I thought of it in this context: original font + glyphs (patched). If the original font was mono I was just concatenating 'Plus Nerd File Types' and since it then ended up no longer being mono I thought I would append 'mono' to the \"patched\" part. \nYou make a good point though and I will definitely think about a better naming convention.\nThanks I would love any feedback you have. I think you will find the single width glyphs some are very hard to distinguish but I wanted to put this out on master branches because it felt solid enough and I thought it is never going to be perfect so it made no sense for me to keep holding it back in topic bracnches.\n. @srijanshetty Finally got around to briefly testing this and merging it in! :tada: \nWorks well so far thanks!\n. Thanks for this. I will try to get this fixed soon\n. @abl I believe I have corrected these issues. Please have a look, I would appreciate some feedback.\nI will give you some time to respond but I will close this issue if no response.\nThanks\n. completed and updated in master. officially linked to v0.2.1 upcoming\n. @abl No probem. Thank you. I will try to be more vigilant with future fonts\n. @Vaelatern As far as I understand it doesn't as all the code used to patch the fonts is licensed under MIT and each fonts license is provided per each font's relevant folder.\nMost of the fonts are licensed under the SIL Open Font License which allows the fonts to be used, modified, and distributed. The main compliance issue we had before was the reserved font name and original license not being included.\nOkay I found this which is not exactly the same thing:\n\nThe requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.\n\nCan I ask the reason for your question?. @Vaelatern Ah okay. Well we have to confirm licenses again. Relevant issue #266 . @obxhdx hmm that is odd. Im using python 2.7.6 though I doubt that is causing anything.\nDo you have the python fontforge module? It should be warning about that if not.\nSeems like something else is going on...\nI have actually been working on running the patcher for the remaining unpatched fonts. I will push it up soon if you want to grab Inconsolata from here (https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-filetype-glyphs-fonts-patcher/tree/master/patched-fonts/Inconsolata)\n. Hmm probably will need some help on this one.\nDid a fresh install of fontforge on Fedora and no issue running the patcher.\nIf someone could try to debug that'd be great\npython -m pdb ./font-patcher unpatched-sample-fonts/Inconsolata/Inconsolata\\ for\\ Powerline.otf\npython -i\nor some other way\ninitial thoughts... seems like my script is doing something very bad performance wise..\nJust out of curiousity, can you tell me what you get for ulimit -s ?\nDoes running the script with the -q (quiet) flag make any difference ?\n. @nicholasc Thanks! Sorry I never said that!!! :blush: \nI will probably add something to the wiki and close it soon (getting caught up on these issues). Closed via: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/wiki/FAQ-and-Troubleshooting#segmentation-fault-running-python-patcher. Since latest release do not believe this is an issue. Closing. @strrchr Sorry about this yes there is a problem. I ran into this a week or so ago. \nWindows has trouble installing fonts with internal font name longer than 31 characters. If you have fontforge you can try to regenerate with a shorter name or you would have to wait for a patch (I need to regenerate all the fonts with names that work on windows and give an option to the patcher to limit to 31 characters)\nI assume you were seeing something similar to this:\n\n. OKay so it is not related to just the filename. I will have to take another look. the ttf fonts seem to install okay on windows (so far)\n. not actually fixed (accidentally marked as fix in a commit)\n. This is no longer an issue (except for font 3270),\ntested opening the following fonts (otf version):\n\n3270-Medium Nerd Font Complete Windows Compatible (failing)\nAurulentSansMono-Regular Nerd Font Complete Windows Compatible\nCode New Roman Bold Nerd Font Complete Windows Compatible\nDroid Sans Mono for Powerline Nerd Font Complete Windows Compatible\nFura Code Regular Nerd Font Complete Windows Compatible\nFura Mono Regular for Powerline Nerd Font Complete Windows Compatible\nHasklug Nerd Font Complete Mono Windows Compatible\nHurmit Medium Nerd Font Complete Windows Compatible\nInconsolata for Powerline Nerd Font Complete Windows Compatible\n\nMeslo LG M Regular for Powerline Nerd Font Complete Mono Windows Compatible\n. tested opening the following fonts (otf version):\n\n\n:white_check_mark: 3270-Medium Nerd Font Complete Windows Compatible (now passing!) \n\n:white_check_mark: AurulentSansMono-Regular Nerd Font Complete Windows Compatible\n:white_check_mark: Code New Roman Bold Nerd Font Complete Windows Compatible\n:white_check_mark: Droid Sans Mono for Powerline Nerd Font Complete Windows Compatible\n:white_check_mark: Fura Code Regular Nerd Font Complete Windows Compatible\n:white_check_mark: Fura Mono Regular for Powerline Nerd Font Complete Windows Compatible\n:white_check_mark: Hasklug Nerd Font Complete Mono Windows Compatible\n:white_check_mark: Hurmit Medium Nerd Font Complete Windows Compatible\n:white_check_mark: Inconsolata for Powerline Nerd Font Complete Windows Compatible\n:white_check_mark: Meslo LG M Regular for Powerline Nerd Font Complete Mono Windows Compatible\n:white_check_mark: OpenDyslexic Regular Nerd Font Complete Mono Windows Compatible\n:white_check_mark: Overpass Mono Regular Nerd Font Complete Mono Windows Compatible\n:white_check_mark: Sanity check on all other (ttf) fonts - one style per family (Windows 7). @RageZBla Do you have any more details?

Thank you for the details. I think I will at least add a note about non-ASCII and/or iTerm in the docs (either here or on https://github.com/ryanoasis/vim-webdevicons)\n:question: If you have it working on Mac OS X maybe I could ask you if you could submit or post a screenshot showing the glyphs? \nI would like to add it to the readme (for ryanoasis/vim-webdevicons/issues/32)\n. @RageZBla Thanks a lot! I will give you the proper attribution in the next bugfix/patch release (v0.4.4 on https://github.com/ryanoasis/vim-webdevicons)\ntmux FTW :wink: \n. @rahmatawaludin Yes you are correct it really should be in the readme and/or FAQ. \nI am a bit busy right now to do it myself but you can give a go if you want to contribute.\nFeel free to submit a PR or add it to the wiki FAQ.\nWhich reminds me I really need to add some info on contributing! :+1: \n. My gut is saying to look into listchars\nI will try to give more help once I reach my pc\n. @aslijiasheng \nFile encoding looks correct (because you can see the glyphs)\nIf you can, could you link to your vimrc or provide minimum configuration where this problem can be replicated?\nIf you can visually select the 'defect chars' this could help figure out whats going on: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Identify_the_syntax_highlighting_group_used_at_the_cursor\nI have that command mapped, to <leader>zz for example\n\nIf you could provide the output of:\n:set fillchars?\n:set listchars?\n. ProggyClean patched versions now include Powerline glyphs by default\n. @blueyed Thanks!\n. @blueyed whoops completely an oversight thanks! I'll also get #20 in soon\n. Thanks, this is a good defensive coding update. I might have to resolve some conflicts when I eventually push my latest local changes but this is a good change either way :+1: \n. Yes they are odd I did copy them initially from powerline fonts and I know this would be a good change however this looks like it was done to prevent possible license issues.\nMaybe the text reference can be the original name but the actual font name itself might violate license unless changed.\nFor reference: https://github.com/powerline/fonts/pull/46 https://github.com/powerline/fonts/issues/34 https://github.com/powerline/fonts/issues/63\nSo, might need to look into this more and like I said maybe your change is fine and it would just be that changing the actual font file is the only issue\n. @leandrost just FYI I think your PR still might be perfectly valid or at least partially. I just need to confirm the usage rules on the names :blush: \n. Sure :smile: \n. Uploaded a bunch more fonts. Feel free to give 1 a try :smile: \n. Going to close this. Reopen if any specific issue related to just sauce code pro.\n. Not yet sorry \ud83d\ude1e \nRelated see #86\n. @TheRizzen Terminus (Terminess) is going to be included in 0.9.0 (the TTF version), it seems to work fine but the only problem is if you do not have antialiasing enabled: #86 \n\n@kierun Really sorry about the delayed reply. Can you please try the install script again? You should have more luck with the much improved install script\nTerminus by the way isn't currently being patched in master (that will be available in 0.9.0).\nHere is my test of this:\nbash\nls ~/.local/share/fonts/** | grep Term | wc -l\n0\n./install.sh Terminus\nmkdir: created directory \u2018/home/ryan/.local/share/fonts/NerdFonts\u2019\n\u2018/home/ryan/projects/nerd-fonts/patched-fonts/Terminus/terminus-ttf-4.40.1/Regular/complete/Terminess (TTF) Nerd Font Complete.ttf\u2019 -> \u2018/home/ryan/.local/share/fonts/NerdFonts/Terminess (TTF) Nerd Font Complete.ttf\u2019\n\u2018/home/ryan/projects/nerd-fonts/patched-fonts/Terminus/terminus-ttf-4.40.1/Italic/complete/Terminess (TTF) Italic Nerd Font Complete.ttf\u2019 -> \u2018/home/ryan/.local/share/fonts/NerdFonts/Terminess (TTF) Italic Nerd Font Complete.ttf\u2019\n\u2018/home/ryan/projects/nerd-fonts/patched-fonts/Terminus/terminus-ttf-4.40.1/BoldItalic/complete/Terminess (TTF) Bold Italic Nerd Font Complete.ttf\u2019 -> \u2018/home/ryan/.local/share/fonts/NerdFonts/Terminess (TTF) Bold Italic Nerd Font Complete.ttf\u2019\n\u2018/home/ryan/projects/nerd-fonts/patched-fonts/Terminus/terminus-ttf-4.40.1/Bold/complete/Terminess (TTF) Bold Nerd Font Complete.ttf\u2019 -> \u2018/home/ryan/.local/share/fonts/NerdFonts/Terminess (TTF) Bold Nerd Font Complete.ttf\u2019\n/home/ryan/.local/share/fonts/NerdFonts: caching, new cache contents: 4 fonts, 0 dirs\n/home/ryan/.local/share/fonts/NerdFonts: caching, new cache contents: 4 fonts, 0 dirs\n/var/cache/fontconfig: not cleaning unwritable cache directory\n/home/ryan/.cache/fontconfig: cleaning cache directory\n/home/ryan/.fontconfig: not cleaning non-existent cache directory\nfc-cache: succeeded\nls ~/.local/share/fonts/** | grep Term | wc -l\n4\n. Yeah so the Terminus fonts I generated yesterday but I haven't commited yet. I will try to do that later today and I will make sure to ping here. Thanks\n. Pushed the source fonts and the patched fonts (TTF version of Terminus) on 0.9.0 branch\n@kierun Go ahead and give it a try if you want. Thanks.\n. @adambiggs thanks. I did notice this myself but decided to push it up regardless :blush: On the bright side good to know there is interest :smile: \nI think most of the problems are related to the original glyph font's em size. In particular I noticed Font Awesome source font I used had an odd em size of 1792\n. Hey my suspicion was correct so this should be an easy fix but I still have to regenerate all the fonts :laughing: \nI also need to get caught up on the versioning and changelog (I like to stay organized)\n. @adambiggs I thought I replied already (I guess not! sorry). Anyway thank you and I will try to see if I can figure something out\n. I've been away but I will look into this when back. \n@darookee I will have to try things out on Windows in term emulators.\n@karlmutch I was able to get it working for me on urxvt. Can you share your config settings?\nI have: \nURxvt.font: xft:Droid Sans Mono for Powerline Plus Nerd File Types Mono:pixelsize=16:antialias=true:hinting=true\n. Thanks for all the info I think it will help. :)\n. @DanielGGordon Awesome! Thanks for the detailed report and feedback. It will prove helpful :tada: \nYeah getting things to look right with fonts can be a huge pain :worried: \n. @kierun Thanks yeah that looks really bad. I am going to try to really get back into fixing some of these serious issues.\n. I believe small powerline glyphs should at least be fixed in the latest version but I will test urxvt in particular with the menttioned fonts and if it goes well I will close this issue\nAnyone else that could test things out that would be appreciated :smile: . @nomoon Thanks for the details. Looks more like an alignment issue than size issue?\nBtw, I like your prompt. Where is it from? :blush: . @nomoon Ah I should have realized it was PL9K. Yeah I have been kind of following along with the developments :smile: \n\nThe powerline arrows typically protrude a bit at the bottom\n\nWorking on a test script that will help us test sizing and alignment issues more easily. @SirDoctors and @voiprodrigo Thanks for the details.\nSo I think I would need to test the original (unpatched sources of these fonts) unless either of you can do that as well (the ones included in this repo here).\nSome of these fonts we have a config (config_has_powerline) where if present the patcher should not touch or attempt to patch the powerline glyphs but instead use the ones provided by the source font.\nThat's why I want to check the source fonts to see if they have the same gap issues.. So hopefully in 1.1 this will be as close to 'fixed' as possible.\nHere are some comparisons with Hack (Knack)\ncurrent\n\n\n\nWIP (v1.1)\n\n\n\n\n@SirDoctors Are you saying you are seeing those gaps with Hack proper or with the patched Nerd Fonts Knack ?\n\n@xasx Yes that is mostly true:\n\n\nMono variant:\nyou'll get small icons\n\n\nMono variant will always have 'small' icons because of the nature of monospaced they have to be that small to retain the scale or they would become stretched\n\n\nnon-Mono variant:\nyou get the full-sized icons \nbut have gaps between the triangles\n\n\nThis is something v1.1 is targeting to fix.. along with some glyph alignment issues, and so far it is at least  looking better. @xasx No worries, apologies if I came across as if you didn't understand :smile: . Thanks for summarizing the current state in a clear way. @cemsbr If you are referring to a fallback option for Nerd Fonts that is possible with this fontconfig.\nThe font with just the symbols has yet to be uploaded to the repo (but one could take the config as-is and replace the symbol font with a patched font of their choosing).\nLet me know if I misunderstood your 'would be nice to have' :blush:. Cheers. @cemsbr Sure no problem! That's understandable, some of the information is probably still not very clear up front.\nHeh this issue is getting pretty popular... I think I when I re-patch all the fonts in prep for v1.1.0 we can probably call this fixed :smile: :crossed_fingers: . @katylava , @mavam First my apologies for the somewhat late response. I was about ready to say (and show) that this will be fixed in the next version (v1.1.0) when all the fonts are re-patched... however with the current code I am having some problems with it even building fonts that are detected by the OS. I suspect some py3 compat changes causing this... I haven't looked into it very deeply yet.. @katylava @mavam \nHere is a comparison of the gaps:\nv1.0.0\n\nv1.1.0 WIP\n\nYou can see the gaps are almost entirely gone. I think this is a case where perfect is the enemy of good :smile: so we will build v1.1.0 as it appears here.. @pradyunsg Yep, actually I would say this weekend (either 5th or 6th August) as a part of v1.1.0 Release. Fonts have been uploaded. Feel free to test them out. :smile: \nClosing this for now.... Hey this is really awesome! Thanks a lot.\nI had in my mind to do refactoring of the combinations but what you have looks very nice.\nThanks for the contributions!\nI am on vacation now but I'll get this merged in asap :)\n. Great! Thanks. Funny I was just looking at this font a few days ago :laughing: \nThat's a good idea to make the Powerline patching optional :+1: \nLicense looks okay but 'hack' looks to be reserved\n. I've been away but I will look into this. I think one thing that needs to happen is to detect if the powerline characters are present in the font being patched and to not add (override) the already existing powerline glyphs.\nper: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/pull/28#issuecomment-137246730\n. I am working on not overwriting powerline glyphs if they are already present in the font to be patched.\nI thought this actually may have been fixed for recently patched Sauce Code but https://github.com/ryanoasis/vim-devicons/issues/126 seems to suggest otherwise. I have not tested yet.\n. @voiprodrigo thanks. Hey. No sorry I haven't included them yet but shouldn't be too hard to add another combination to get them included :)\nI'll try to add them in when I can and I'll keep you updated on this ticket\n. Hey thanks for this info. I will look into it. \nI was taking a break but now wanting to work on projects again here and there. \nOn this one I am reorganizing the patched folders to make fonts easier to find and then I want to merge in the 2 open PRs (hack font, fixes, and script refactoring)\n. @CestDiego Thanks it is appreciated.\n\n@dritter You are 100% correct\n\n@dritter , @CestDiego \nAh I see what is going on here. I define the start and end range but quite a few of the glyphs in that range in font awesome are empty (e.g. f010 zoom_out [fa-search-minus]). So that point on its off by one and then each time another empty glyph is encountered its off-by-1++ :blush: \nI will get to this after a bit of re-organization of the folders and merging in the 2 PRs :sweat_smile: \n. @CestDiego Ah I see. That looks very cool and useful! I can see that being very helpful especially if you are using font awesome heavily in a project.\nI would have made a plugin for emacs similar to my vim plugin (vim-devicons) but I am a Vim guy :laughing: and I don't even know where to begin\nIf you need anything to make the font easier to use let me know (I see you already have one issue (#32) you opened :sweat_smile: )\n. @CestDiego I might ask you on #32 for more info on that subject. :blush: \nYeah thats one problem right now with the directory structure. I was creating more subfolders for each family style but maybe I need subfolders for each glyphset variation because the names are very long\nWebsite and interaction to let users pick is a very cool idea! I like it. :+1: \nThe way I feel about this project right now is that there are a lot of little issues and a few big ones. I would love to get most of those ironed out and if this project starts to become more heavily used before creating a website. If/when those things happen then yeah definitely! :smile: \n. @CestDiego 'powerline-extras' is currently missing :disappointed: (see #30)\nYeah it looks like it will have the same off-by-* issue as font-awesome. Fix should be the same.\nFor Octicons I decided to put it in a different range because font-awesome starts at the same unicode but I think what I should do is if you choose Octicons without font-awesome THEN it could start it its original place. Obviously at some point there is a limitation into which glyphs can be included and some needing to be moved when you want to include a bunch into one font :worried: \n. Yes similar in some ways. Yep it is the one used on GitHub :smile: \n. Sorry I think I need some more explanation on this.\nDo you mean just a separate dir per font or do you mean individual archive package per each font? If the latter then that seems like it might be a bit of work.\nCan you give an example and/or a project that does something like this?\nThanks\n. @CestDiego could you provide some more info? :stuck_out_tongue: \n. You mean one patched font as an archive? Because downloading a single font is possible.\n. @CestDiego Yes the names are disgusting long. I am going to at the very least re-organize the directory structure to make it at least a little more manageable (especially in regards to the font that will have all the glyphs).\nI still haven't looked too far into it but it seems like using the GitHub API might be a way to do the packages per release as you mentioned.\n. @francoiscote Belated thank you! I will probably try to put that in at least the readme and possible in each main font directory's readme.rst\n. Hey what do you guys think of this:\nhttps://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/tag/v0.6.1\nI only zipped and did an asset upload of the '3270' patched font to see how feasible this would be in a simple little script (looks pretty feasible!).\nI don't think breaking these directory archives down much further would be much help.. MAYBE going down one more directory to 'complete','additional-variations', and 'minimal'.\nActually looks like this zip has all the emphasis variants (Medium, Narrow). Maybe ideally zips would be broken out such as:\n- 3270 - Medium - complete\n- 3270 - Medium - additional-variations\n- 3270 - Medium - minimal\n- 3270 - Narrow - complete\n- 3270 - Narrow - additional-variations\n- 3270 - Narrow - minimal\nActually I think with all of the fonts this is going to be TOO much, I think only 'complete' is useful for a zipped up ready to go solution:\n- 3270 - Medium\n- 3270 - Narrow\n. Going to only build the 'complete' fonts by default going forward, so for the packaging will have one archive per font (e.g., one for 3270, one for Hack)\nThis will solve this issue and #72 (2 birds meeting single stone :smile:)\n. This is working nicely right now :smile: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/tag/v0.8.0. Thanks I will take a look. I think I had wanted to patch the latest from Adobe but it required tools to build the latest font styles. I did start installing some of the reqquirements but didn't get past the dependencies.\n. Thanks. Looks like I have overlooked something when fixing font awesome. Will take a look.\n. @dritter Okay so the problem is both Font Awesome and Octicons start their glyph range at f000 so I had to pick one to take precedence. I chose Font Awesome and moved Octicons to a different range when both sets of glyphs are in the patched font.\nIf you want to use the original unicode codepoints for Octicons you will have to use Knack Plus Nerd File Types Plus Octicons or one that does not add Font Awesome\n. @dritter for Octicons yes that is correct.\nYou make a good point and it is worth considering. My thought was to try to keep all glyphs at their original position unless there are conflicts but you brought up the other side of it that there would be less consistently\n. Good points. Yeah it is a catch 22 in some sense :smile: \n. I will at least do an update for Octicons to https://github.com/github/octicons/releases/tag/v3.1.0\n. Octicons now up to v3.2.0 so that'll be the one I include more than likely\n. Latest Octicons should now be included in  v0.6.0 but the main point of this ticket is still to be discussed so leaving it open for now.\n. @CrashyBang If you are using one of the patched fonts with both glyph sets (e.g. 'Complete') then the Octicons will be in a new range (f400 to f497) and not their original range (f000 to f0db). This is due to a conflict of ranges with Font Awesome.\nsee below:\n\nOriginal Range\n\n\n\nNew Range (when you have Font Awesome)\n\n\n. @CrashyBang No problem :smile: It should probably be clarified in the readme because I can see where it would be confusing right now :blush: \n. @yarthur Thanks for pointing that out and reminding me. So I am still in the process of recovering my primary OS :cry: but looks like I had forgotten to upload that image to the wiki.\nI will update them both sometime this weekend if I get back 100% up :smile: . @yarthur Wiki page has been fixed\n@dritter Any strong objections on closing this issue? It seems we have settled on leaving the code points where they are in the Nerd Fonts Complete variations (the standard one 99.9% of users will use anyway)\nIf something changes at this point the major version would have to bump anyway due to breaking changes. The symbols provided by Nerd Fonts or you mean in general?\nFor Nerd Fonts you can use the patcher:\n./font-patcher Inconsolata.otf\n. Ah those symbols. I am actually targeting to add those symbols into the next minor release v0.6.0\nref: #30\n. relates to #30 \n. This is a known problem and actually I am not sure the best way to make the mono sized glyphs appear big enough without some stretching.\n\nIn gnome terminal you should be able to use one of the double-width glyph fonts (they won't appear stretched) instead of the true Mono ones. \nFor example use Ubuntu Mono Plus Nerd File Types.ttf instead of Ubuntu Mono Plus Nerd File Types Mono.ttf. They are both Mono the only difference is that the former has some double width glyphs.\n\nAs for patching your own it should be as simple as:\n./font-patcher PATH_TO_FONT\n. @MadsRC @Pr0x1m4 Thanks for the info.\nUnfortunately it is a limitation of the script and my knowledge of how to best fix it. The only current alternative as @Pr0x1m4 mentioned is to not use the single width glyph version of the font (basically a font name that doesn't end in 'mono'). This also is a WIP to be cleared up (which font do I even want?)\n. Nice solution/idea \ud83d\ude04 \nNot sure why it would not work in gvim however\n. The stretching at least should now be fixed in 0.9.0 branch.. if anyone would like to try it out\n. since v1.0.0 release this is fixed. @brodock I will update the readme with this info thanks :+1: \n. Thanks for the notice/update :+1: \n. I will do my best to answer your questions\n\nHm...looks like it may only be an issue with some fonts?\n\nThat's possible, and some might not look very good at the moment and are untested. However the same variation of different fonts (e.g M+ with Awesome, Octicons, and Pomicons should have the same code points for the glyphs as Inconsolata).\nAh I think I see the problem to which you are referring. Looks like M+ is missing the powerline glyphs, see image below (left is M+ and right side is Inconsolata):\n\n\nWhat's the formula for constructing that mapping, and what's the best way for me to sync up powerline9k with the nerd-fonts font I'd like to use?\n\nI try to match the codepoints given in the original glyph font, but in some cases there are conflicts (e.g. Awesome and Octicons, so I favor Font Awesome and move Octicons to an alternative range).\n\nIs this project mapping codepoints differently than awesome-terminal-fonts?\n\nI do not believe so, just quickly looking at the mapping on awesome-terminal for Font Awesome they look to match (fyi looks like awesome-terminal is using an older version of Font Awesome).\n\nFYI, this project is using an older version of Octicons. This shouldn't be too bad to update but all fonts have to be rebuilt and that probably won't be done until v0.6.0\n. Hmm I thought I might have fixed this with  v0.6.0 but looks like there are still issues with glyph sizes\n. Thanks for this. I will try to get this fixed, I saw some issues but decided to move forward anyway. I will see if I can get something more reliable. My guess is its related to em sizes\n. Sorry pushing this off so I can get more easy tickets closed out before diving into the more complex ones :disappointed: \n. @herrbischoff I was able to replicate the issue of missing powerline symbols recently. Not sure what is going on (will have to dig a bit more into it). Apologies\n. This has since been fixed in v1.0.0 release\nleft side: v0.8.0 (pre-fix)\nright side: v1.0.0 (after post-fix)\n\n. @eugenesvk \nI think I have found a solution to this :smile:, I will include this with the next release if it tests out well. Thanks for reporting this :+1: \nsomewhat related (in that info is lost): #43 \n. @eugenesvk \nYes you are correct Octicons I am using is not up to date, see: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/issues/34#issuecomment-153050037\nNo worries I was actually late to the GitHub party as well :smile: . For this issue we can leave it open and I will close it on the next release.\n. @eugenesvk \nThese are good points and I agree with you pretty much!\nI have actually been in the process of reorganizing the directory structure a bit to make ad hoc downloading easier (spurred from #32).\n- Changing the family name to be consistent across variations should be one of the easier fixes you suggest.\n- The variation tacking on the included glyphs is yes very ugly. A partial solution at least is underway where I am going to rename the one with EVERYTHING as: < font name > Nerd Font Complete since this is probably the variation that is going to be most used. Would this be useful? You probably downloaded the font that has all the glyphs anyway?\n- User input: Yeah this could be an option and may help. It sounds like the other points you made are more of a concern but this might be a nice option to have as well.\n. @eugenesvk That is a good suggestion to keep it as short as possible. I was going with Nerd Font because it is the project name. I can see where having 'Font' part of a font name is a bit redundant however. All could also work in place of Complete.\nI am not sure about those but I will definitely consider them :+1:\n. Closing for now as this is partially implemented on v0.6.0. If it is not good enough we can discuss and implement on a later version :+1: \n. Thanks! :+1: Yes this looks to be the case :disappointed: \nI found a nice script that outputs the ligatures and I was able to verify before and after that they do become lost.\nI have just quickly tried experimenting with fontforge methods trying to copy the ligatures with no success so far.\nI will update if any news.\n. Okay so it might be as simple as adding a flag on generating a font, I have been able to keep the ligatures, however there is another issue: The location of the ligatures is conflicting with devicons, so devicons is clobbering some of the ligatures.\nSee below (left side is without the font, right side is the font):\n\n\nBefore adding the flag, none of the ligatures were showing up.\n. Just a quick update I added a flag that will not overwrite glyphs (ligatures as well in this case). At least you'll get the option :smile: \nShould be ready to go this weekend if all is well:\n\n. Pretty much done on v0.6.0 :tada: \n. @gregf Thanks! Workin' on it :relaxed: \n. That should fix it, let me know if it doesn't :+1: \n. Thanks glad to hear feedback.\nNope! It was not intentional. I was too eager to push it out without testing multiple fonts.\nI will look into this :+1: \n. @AustinMatherne They are still there it is just the names of the fonts have been changed (hopefully for the better).\nTry one of the \"complete\" versions (includes all glyphs):\ne.g. https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/master/patched-fonts/SourceCodePro/Regular/complete/Sauce%20Code%20Pro%20Nerd%20Font%20Complete.ttf\nActually even the \"minimal\" variations should by default have the Powerline glyphs.\nLet me know if I misunderstood or if this solves your question. Cheers :smile: \n. Looks pretty good.\nCan you remove this part:\n\nYou can find more fonts under my [patched fonts repo][patched-fonts].\n. Thanks\n. Cool, thanks for the heads up. I will try to include it on the next release :+1: \n. @SageEx Thanks for the info and I am glad this project is useful to you :smile: \npython 3\n\nI will have to look into that, I see the changes you had to make. There has to be a way to make it compatible for py3 and py2 without having 2 separate scripts to maintain?\n\nhow about including Fantasque Sans Mono in the default patched fonts set ?\n\nLooks like the license will allow this (OFL (SIL Open Font License)), the only I was checking for is if there is a Reserved Font Name specified in the license but I don't see one. If the name is reserved we would just have to rename the patched version (e.g. Hack becomes Knack).\n. Thanks btw. I will probably get to this but not anytime soon. \nFantasque Sans Mono\nProbably not too difficult to add just a handful of bugs that I've been focusing on.\nCheers!\n. I don't have fontforge setup with py3 bindings nor have it compiled with py3 so I cannot test however this script: font-patcher-py3 should work for python3, if someone could test it out? That'd be great! \nfontforge -script font-patcher-py3 unpatched-sample-fonts/Monoid/Monoid-Italic.ttf --powerline --powerlineextra\nor\npython3 font-patcher-py3 unpatched-sample-fonts/Monoid/Monoid-Italic.ttf --powerline --powerlineextra\nThis is only on the 0.7.0 branch for now.\nI will test it when I get a chance.\n. Thanks. looks like readme needs updated to the new path. Feel free to submit PR or wait until I fix :+1: \n. Thanks! \nThis was updated in the readme but never in the install script good fix :+1: \n. First thanks for the feedback :+1: . I always like constructive feedback :smile: \n\nI still can't access the new fonts\n\nI thought the installation had really been improved compared to what it once was. What specifically was the issue you were running into why you could not access the fonts?\nI am very open to PRs to improve things or suggestions that I can implement myself alternately.\n\nEven better would be to create an install script that would let you select fonts that would auto download and install.\n\nSounds like a cool idea, I had started on building a website that would allow you to choose the specific font and variation options to download but this idea is also a good option.\n. Hey thanks for the details :+1: \n\nThe current CURL example doesn't work anymoe\n\nYep I believe there was another ticket about this\n\nSecond issue...\n\nHmm I will have to look into this\n\nwhich font set to use\n\nThis could be easily improved at least in the readme or additional readme per font directory\n. > The current CURL example doesn't work anymore\nIt should work now because of #50 being fixed/closed and pushed\nYour other points are still TBD/TODO :stuck_out_tongue: \n. This concern has been now partially addressed in the wiki: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/wiki/FAQ#which-font\nHowever, I am going to be adding some readme.rst files to various directories to make it even more obvious and helpful :smiley: \n. Thanks for the heads up\n. Yes this should be fixed.. thanks for the details here.\nI don't have a mac to test on but perhaps I can setup a test branch where others can try it out :smile: \n. @thewatts, @adambiggs\n\nYes this should be fixed.. thanks for the details here\n\nErr I apologize for not making my point clear. :blush: What I meant here was that this should get fixed not that it already was fixed. i.e. Yes this is still a problem AFAIK :+1: \nI will be leaving this ticket open until someone can confirm an attempted fix :smile: \n\n@thewatts\n\nWhich, I must say - this project is LEGIT. Really thankful for it!\n\nThanks! That means a lot\n. I will be pushing up a test branch that should address this issue. Maybe even as early as tomorrow if I get time.\nI will link to it on this ticket when I do.\nThanks\n. @eugenesvk Yep! I was aware of the sfnt_names and actually I think I have the changes that should solve the issue right now. Just haven't released or pushed to any branch.\nThank you for the detailed info I think it is helpful :+1: \nI think at some point adding configuration files to denote the subfont/style name might be needed. Because some fonts have it after the dash in the filename as a convention but some don't. Also some fonts have the incorrect Styles (SubFamily) when viewed in FontForge (e.g. SourceCodePro-ExtraLight.ttf) as shown below:\n\nWIP Changes preview:\nhttps://gist.github.com/ryanoasis/af51f008838aaa46fb61\nparticularly of note: sourceFont.appendSFNTName('English (US)', 'SubFamily', subFamily)\n. > old convention of limiting styles\nDid not know this thanks!\n\nread OpenType names [...] And only if OpenType names aren't present, use the regular ones.\n\nNice. I think I even overlooked that in the screenshot I posted :blush: . Yes I think this makes sense and I this seems like the logic to go with here.\n\nFontLab options\n\nSorry I did read your suggestion but have not really gone through it in detail. Just FYI the gist I posted was work done before any of your messages so the new information you have provided will help me greatly in making this patcher 'do the right thing'. :+1: \n\nshortening font names always\n\nAlso as you mentioned in #58, this one is the only one I am still not sure on. I will reply there\n. Good stuff thanks again.\nYeah I think I am in agreement with you on all 3 of the main points as you described them.\n58 - yeah that is definitely something to consider. Also claiming a bunch of font variations is a bit deceiving if most of them aren't very useful :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:\n. @jrolfs Yes and I replied on #61, seems like your work at least will help solve. I might have a bit of conflict with https://gist.github.com/ryanoasis/af51f008838aaa46fb61 but I think I soon need to setup a test branch for us to check how the fonts come out.\n. @adamclaxon \nThanks I think we are getting close to getting this fixed now. You are correct it seems that the font name needs the style to identify it properly as a separate font variant.\n\nIf you want (and it would be a great help!) you can try patching with the 0.7.0 branch because it seems to be solving most of the issues so far at least.\n. @Undistraction Sorry that I never replied to you. I will test the scenario you mentioned\n@mike3run Can you tell me which fonts you have patched? . @mike3run Thanks. Yep no worries I know about that font and yes we will comply with licenses here :smile: . @mike3run Hey just tested this.. so unfortunately I cannot test on macOS with fontbook but seems to me it might use the weight to differentiate the fonts.\nAre you seeing the same issue with unpatched versions of the same font and same weights or does it only occur after patching?\n\nHere is what I see on Linux and it seems to differentiate fine, however there does seem to be something going on:\n\n. @mike3run Oh! So it's not an issue with some showing up or not showing up as selectable but how the style is rendered?\nI wonder if the same thing would happen for you with for instance with Hasklug (Hasklig). It seems to render the correct style/weight for me on Linux:\n\n. Thanks, this might take some more digging :worried: . Going to reopen because:\n1. Obviously still an issue\n2. The commit to close was an \"Attempt to fix\" and no verification was done to ensure\n3. This issue was fallen off of the radar.. I last commented almost a year ago. Apologies to @Undistraction and @mike3run \nThanks @zxaos for getting this back to visibility for me.\nI don't know if this will be apart of the next release or not. Goal of 1 per month has been severely lagging. Need to revisit methodology perhaps . Maybe we can make some traction on this again this month. I won't be able to test any potential fixes but I could upload zips if others (who are on macos) can test them out?\n. @michaeltlombardi Thanks. That looks cool! Hmm poked around not sure about the future of project though... @michaeltlombardi Let us know if you do and how it turns out. I would be willing to use something like this in Nerd Fonts. I really appreciate your ideas here and they make a lot of sense. :bow: \nThese are suggestions I will definitely and probably need to consider, especially the 'windows version' possibly just trimming the names no matter what. Especially if that actually makes things less confusing to someone coming to download the fonts.\n\nWith short names (e.g. \"NC\" instead of \"Nerd Font Complete\") Windows version is never needed.\n\nYeah correct. This might be the way to go. Have to think about this and perhaps get some more opinions (if possible) :smile: \n\nFor the 1st there is no variation, 'SetUI' takes precedence.\n\nSorry didn't quite understand what you meant here. It seems like later you contradicted by saying you prefered 'Devicons' to take priority over 'Seti-UI' or maybe I misunderstood.\n\nPersonally, I'd prefer in the 1st conflict to prioritize 'Devicons'\n\nYeah that makes sense. Originally when this font started it was just 'Seti-UI' and those were moved for some reason that I currently do not remember (I will have to check). But yes when 'devicons' was added the conflict was apparent only then. \nReally the only problem with moving 'Seti-ui' is that it would break vim-devicons which relies upon the specific codepoints for glyphs and was the catalyst of this project even existing :stuck_out_tongue:. However there is a good target opportunity to move around glyph positions for version 1.0.0 of vim-devicons is released (following semver) because there are going to be breaking changes already planned for :smile: \nAnyway, yes these are all possible at some point :+1: \n. @eugenesvk Yeah I think this should be feasible and done at the 1.0.0 release since it will be a breaking change for both projects.\nA few other interesting motivator to decrease the number of Fonts: \n- Cloning and downloading the Repo is not feasible for everyone: #73 \n- May be coming up on a GitHub repo size limit: https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-my-disk-quota/\n. It should not be patching over the powerline glyphs unless you run the patcher with the --powerline flag. \nI just checked the script logic that generates all the patched fonts and it should not be overriding the powerline symbols for Hack or Source Code Pro. However it is possible the conditional is not catching the proper case (I would need to run it and see).\n. Interesting thanks. I'll have to keep my eyes open for developments.\n. Things have been looking pretty good for a while now on powerline glyph alignments and also yes Nerd Fonts does not by default patch over existing glyphs (there is even a specific config for powerline).\nHere are some latest results of Sauce Code Pro at different sizes with v1.1.0:\n13pt\n\n9pt\n\n16pt\n\nClosing for now. Thanks. :smile: \n. @jrolfs Hey thanks for this. Looks like it is working for you.\nJust one thing some of these change might conflict with some refactor I was doing on https://gist.github.com/ryanoasis/af51f008838aaa46fb61 but looks like we both are trying to solve the same problem. I think one reason was the regex was bad... among other things.\nAnyway.. whatever happens I will try to get your contribution in even if some of my changes conflict :+1: \n. Yeah the regex took me a bit to figure out too, I think it is originally from the powerline font patcher or similar.\nOkay yeah I will use what I have but also try to add your changes. :ok_hand: \nGood to know it won't hurt your feelings either way. I just try to be very welcoming so almost every PR on the projects I've started so far has been included (I think only one actually was not included because I was in doubt on the legal circumstance) and being friendly I believe is important. \nI have seen too much negativity and egotism in other projects. :smiley: :wink: \n. @Qix- \nSeems like the fix did work for @jrolfs but yeah maybe something in the patch all script is causing an issue.\nHowever I feel good about the chances that this will be fixed before the next release :smile: \nI am away from my laptop at the moment. A lot of eyes suddenly on this project :blush: but I can only help out in a limited fashion right now :sweat_smile: \n. I plan to pull this (#61) into the 0.7.0 branch next. just out of steam at the moment :sweat_smile: \n. I did merge this into the 0.7.0 branch but basically only the contribution/commits will be there because my refactor was in conflict with it.\nHowever I cannot test on osx so if someone wants to poke around in 0.7.0 branch to test that'd be cool and if it doesn't resolve the issue then perhaps I need to use at least part of @jrolfs changes to get it working :smile: \nI am trying to get everything into 0.7.0 but I have yet to rebuild all the fonts.. I would ideally like to make sure the #61 and #56 are actually fixed before rebuilding everything :laughing: \nTaking a break now. Just FYI I will try to check the gitter chat more often these days\n. @poliquin Thanks for testing the latest in Font Book!\n\nThere is part of @jrolfs PR I overwrote due to merge conflict that might be needed to solve this completely\nIf you want to try to add this (approximately line 122 of the patcher):\npython\nfontname += \" - \" + subFamily\n. @jrolfs Ah yep I see that you did update the regex, but you still have this line too:\npython\nfontname = fontname + additionalFontNameSuffix.replace(\" \", \"\") + \"-\" + style\nWhich I was trying to put back in after I resolved a conflict after merging yours.\nNote: I also update the regex in my refactoring and I think it should work but if not I will revisit and look more closely at yours as well :smile: \n\n\n... part unnecesary\n\nI think you were thinking of this part: style = style.replace(\"-\", \"\") instead?\n. Ugh I thought I replied not sure what happened... sorry.\n\n\nwarning when importing the font\n\nWas this occurring before the 'line 122' change as well or just afterwards?\n\n\noddly sized glyphs in some cases\n\nThis is something I am going to give most of my attention (related to this project) for the next release. There are multiple issues with glyph sizes and positions. I have since added labels on the related tickets but we are probably targeting fixing some or most of them in the v0.8.0 release.\n. @jrolfs No problem. Yeah I also worked on the regex and in general font name tweaks and refactoring in my original refactor. I am going to add the 'line 122' change to 0.7.0 branch\n. @poliquin Okay I don't think those warnings are anything serious and I will continue on with this release with this as a known issue. However this could possibly be fixed later if it seems to be causing actual problems.\nAs you pointed out the glyph sizing would be a higher priority issue to fix anyway.\nAs for #61 I am calling 'good enough'. I cannot really test on os x and those who have the fonts seem to be working better (not perfect) in Font Book now.\n. @jrolfs Yep I will get the line 122 change in :+1: to the 0.7.0 branch.\nThe only items left before merging that to master for release are: #52 and just rebuilding all the fonts\n. Forgot I actually did make the change in the 0.7.0 branch: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/commit/52e9a9537ed9a338293d37baf69827d4956f8d45\nI am just working on #52 and rebuilding the fonts :smile: ... maybe this weekend :four_leaf_clover: \n. @jrolfs Yep I saw this last night. Awesome and thank you :+1: \nI was waiting for more PRs regarding fonts :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: \nSo I am glad the patcher seems to be working well for other people not just me :smile: \nI will add this to the next release.\n. Oh one more thing I will merge this in but I might have to rebuild if I also add #48 and I will update the readme accordingly :smile: \n. Great thanks. I will let you know :+1: \n. I see. Thanks for the report. I will look into this. :+1: \n. Turns out this is an issue with Hack itself which has since been fixed in 2.020 (see: https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Hack/issues/181#issuecomment-214938967) version but we are using 2.019\n. Thanks for the report :+1: \nI will look into this when I can :blush: \n. Ah that makes sense thanks :smile: \n. @alpertuna Hey thanks for the report. :+1: \nI have seen and/or had this problem before as well.\nI am not sure how much can be done to eliminate this 100% but I will look into it nonetheless when I get some time\n. @alpertuna Can you try downloading again with latest release?\n. Yeah mono one looks fairly good, here is my vim in xterm with DejaVu:\n\nAnd non glyph mono of DejaVu:\n\n. @her Hey thanks :smile: . No worries, I've actually been very busy with work as well.\nParticular? Not that I can think of. Anything that improves things I am open to :+1: \nFor #152 I am not exactly sure there is a bug but probably options do need to be clarified in the readme.\nI've been doing a lot of work on the readme lately, so if you want feel free to tweak things in the 0.8.4 branch\n\nThinking about making a collaborators only gitter chat or something as well.\nI just thought it was about time I add some collaborators.. well the main reason just in case but also it is a good thing to do.\n. @kierun Cool thank you and yes I understand. I will take any help that is offered large or small \ud83d\ude04 \n. @evaryont Yeah I think it's only inevitable at this point To be completely honest the main hold back is a very selfish reason, the other reasons after that are all just logistics and planning. I am not there yet :disappointed:\n@kierun You shouldn't have anything to apologize for! Glad to have you on board. :smile: . @F1LT3R Ah yes looks like they are missing.. not sure what is going on but I did confirm powerline glyphs are indeed missing. :worried: \nThanks for the heads up! :+1: \n\nupdate: so...... apparently there was a typo which prevents the powerline symbol font from being copied at all! D'oh! This was a PR and I did not catch it (it's all good).\nHere is an after the fix (right) and before the fix (left):\n\nHere is the point of the issue: \nActually this issues seems to have been introduced in https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/commit/9d3e60ac6631d4fd07c46bf1f90396dc0287eca8#diff-3b192ccaec850d73e6540b7eddd8b50cR360\n. > can get ProggyCleanTTSZ on the list\nSure :smile:,  just make a separate issue or I will make one soon if you'd rather.\nI think I came across a bunch of ProggyClean variations and in my ignorance wasn't sure exactly what the differences were and picked only a few to patch.\n. > What program are you using in your screenshot where you are checking that the correct glyphs are at the correct registers?\nFontForge gui. Not an extensive check sorry just quickly opened the patched fonts to verify my theory.\n\n... I have glyphs! :smile:\n\nGlad it worked for you as well! :smile: Thanks for checking it too.\n\nBut... they seem to be a funny size. Maybe I can live with that?\n\nThis something a bit tricky I need to improve and work on and there are similar issues currently open related to glyph sizing and/or positioning issues.\n\nPR\n\nGreat thanks, I'll get it in to the next release :+1: \n. @chrissimpkins Awesome thanks! Thanks for the compliments :blush: . I love Hack :wink: \nYour support means a lot, I will try to get this fixed when I can (might not be next 'release' because I have already pushed to much into it :laughing:) but at the very least your instructions are provided for help :+1: \n. Been busy on 0.9.0 so still haven't gotten around to this\n\n@dingmaotu Thanks for the info. Sorry for your troubles. Yeah I was just going to say to try the instructions @chrissimpkins has provided\n@chrissimpkins thanks again for the details on the fix. I should probably add some process post patching to avoid having these missing hints\n\nEdit: Actually this doesn't seem overly difficult. I'll try to resolve this in 0.9.0 with some variation on what @chrissimpkins provided \ud83d\ude04 . @chrissimpkins Thanks appreciate it. I can't think of anything specific off the top of my head but if I do I'll let you know. Also of course if you see anything you can/want to fix or improve that would be great.\nA lot of the open issues should be fixed soon (with 0.9.0) so the picture of what is actually still open should clear up drastically. I had some trouble with building from source (dependencies, etc) but I did finally manage to get it working.\nI modified the provided scripts (a few issues on the python one) and made the necessary changes on the shell one to work. Called both of these after patching (with a simple wrapper shell file).\nI got to the point of the new font generating and was about to test if the hints and glyphs were there ... but now my primary OS is messed up. Trying to restore it but first I am trying to backup my changes that I had not yet pushed :worried: . I can't seem to get the hinting to work. Any ideas?\nshell\nttfautohint -l 4 -r 80 -G 350 -x 0 -H 181 -D latn -f latn -w G -W -t -X \"\" -m \"bin/scripts/Hack/Hack-Regular-TA.txt\" Hack-Regular.ttf posthinted/Hack-Regular.ttf\nshell\nttfautohint --version\nttfautohint 1.6. @chrissimpkins No errors but I don't see the hints (at least in FontForge). Is there another/better way to verify it worked as expected? Excuse my ignorance :smile: . @chrissimpkins Hey thanks a lot... I think it is working just fine then.\n\n\nFontForge ignores the TTFA table... so no wonder I was having trouble seeing the differences via FontForge :blush: \nThe following table(s) in the font have been ignored by FontForge\n Ignoring 'TTFA'\n\n\nI found that using the -T (capital t) would print that table\n\n\n--ttfa-info, -T   (not in ttfautohintGUI)\nPrint TTFA table of the input font on standard output if present, then exit.\nhttps://www.freetype.org/ttfautohint/doc/ttfautohint.html\nSo given this I was able to verify the presence or lack of:\nttfautohint -T patched-fonts/Hack/Regular/complete/Knack\\ Regular\\ Nerd\\ Font\\ Complete.ttf\nNo `TTFA' table in font.\n```\nttfautohint -T posthinted/Knack\\ Regular\\ Nerd\\ Font\\ Complete.ttf\nadjust-subglyphs = 0\ndefault-script = latn\ndw-cleartype-strong-stem-width = 0\nfallback-scaling = 0\nfallback-script = latn\nfallback-stem-width = 181\ngdi-cleartype-strong-stem-width = 1\ngray-strong-stem-width = 0\nhinting-limit = 350\nhinting-range-max = 80\nhinting-range-min = 4\nhint-composites = 0\nignore-restrictions = 0\nincrease-x-height = 0\nreference = \nreference-index = 0\nsymbol = 0\nTTFA-info = 1\nwindows-compatibility = 1\nx-height-snapping-exceptions = \ncontrol-instructions = \\\n   0 zero left 40; \\\n   0 zero touch 39-40, 71 xshift 0 yshift -0.5 @ 7; \\\n   0 zero touch 39-40, 71 xshift 0 yshift -1 @ 8, 12-18; \\\n   0 zero touch 55-57 xshift 0 yshift -1 @ 19-25\n```. I am updating Hack to v3.003\n@chrissimpkins Don't want to bug you but a couple questions came to mind:\nI am wondering do we need to execute the Python scripts in the fixes folder post-patching ?\nThe current post processing script that gets run for Hack is bin/scripts/Hack/postprocess.sh.\nDo we still need fpfix.py or should we also use the Python scripts in the postbuild folder?\nThere were no changes to the Control Instructions Files since we lasted grabbed them. Looks like we have the latest ttfautohint settings since v3.000\n\nIf you are currently based on v3.x\n\nYep that looks to be the case, I seem to no longer have ttfautohint installed on my system so not sure what happened there. I'll have to make sure to get the 1.7 version you mentioned and try to rebuild the patched fonts and see what happens.\nWorking on updating our postprocess script\n\nLet me know if there is anything else that I can do. Happy to help! The patches here are fantastic Ryan.\n\nThanks! I take any help offered! I will reach out if there is something specific though :). Thanks, that helps greatly! I've got ttfautohint setup again and ran through our Sanity check without error.\nI have updated the Dev steps with the Hack script option: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/wiki/Contributor-Developer-Setup#hack-font-specific-development\nThe way I was doing it before definitely was a lot more painful on Linux :laughing: \n\nSeem to be close on this (the Python scripts in post processing work just fine). However,\nttautohint with the settings from the Hack build work well pre-patching but of course not working with post-patched version :see_no_evil: . Looking into it but I can definitely see the glyphs still have the same names and code point. Need to keep digging. Found reference in sections like 'eight.subs'.\nErrors for anything in the control files:\nHack-Regular-TA.txt:3:1: invalid glyph name (0x204)\n  uni0023 touch 0,1,2,3,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,31 x 0.25  @ 13\nIt seems FontForge (or at least how we are using it) is destroying some data when patching that references these glyphs. Thanks! That's a brilliant idea. I wondered about that but when I opened the pre and post patched fonts in FontForge I was comparing the glyphs names, etc and I didn't realize what you are saying (FontForge already changed the name once I opened it in FF).\nI did a quick test with the 0023 glyph and it seemed to work!\nnumbersign touch 0,1,2,3,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,31 x 0.25  @ 13\nI am going to upload a patched version (without the hinting fixes) just in case you would like to confirm or check it out!. Here is a patched version of Hack after running through the patcher (normal settings, with the Python script post process fixes but WITHOUT the autohint fixes):\nHack Regular Nerd Font Complete.ttf.zip\n. @chrissimpkins Thanks a lot for the help! Really appreciate it :smiley: I probably would've wasted at least several hours.\nGoing to take a nice break. Will be pushing fixes to the postprocess Nerd Fonts uses. Very happy it's not some serious issue that would cause me to start looking at something different from FontForge for building at the moment!\n\ncan you give me a list of all glyphs that are raising exceptions? is it all of them on the CIF's?\n\nI believe it was all of them. When I first saw the error with 0023 I just commented it out but then it errored out on 0025 and etc. I only tested Hack-Regular-TA but I would assume it will be all of them... Thanks again, no worries. No rush :smile:\nGot Regular working, this is what I had to change it to (only zero it put as uni0030 - go figure):\n```\nU+0023 numbersign glyph ID 582\nnumbersign touch 0,1,2,3,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,31 x 0.25  @ 13\nU+0025 percent glyph 761\npercent touch 0,1,21,22,23,39    y 0.5    @10\npercent touch 40                 y 0.75   @10\npercent touch 41,42,43           y 0.5    @10\npercent touch 51,52,53,70,71,72  y 0.5    @10\npercent touch 40,43              y -0.75  @11\npercent touch 41,42              y 0.75   @11\npercent touch 0,1,21,22,23,39    y -0.25  @14\npercent touch 8,9,10,30,31,32    y 0.25   @14\npercent touch 51,52,53,70,71,72  y -0.5   @14\npercent touch 40,41,42,43        y -0.25  @14\nU+002B plus glyph ID 764\nplus touch 4,5,10,11          y 0.5    @12\nplus touch 4,5                y 1.0    @13\nU+0030 zero glyph ID 548\nuni0030 touch 35,36,45,46,47,56  y -0.5   @8\nuni0030 touch 35,36,56           y -1.0   @12,13,14\n```. @chrissimpkins Thanks again again. I think we are good. Confirmed those CIF changes (already pushed).\n. Thanks @chrissimpkins those look like they could be very helpful!\nWe'll probably have to consider some of those or at least items like them :smile: . Sounds interesting, been busy so just no replying :sweat_smile: \n. I have created a shell script to create the casks :smile: in 0.9.0 but not sure how to test them without being on macOS :cry: \nAlso not sure if these are even supposed to work without the source being an archive file.. anyone know? I will try to ask for some help on the homebrew fonts :smile: \n. @kevinSuttle Thanks for pinging the appropriate people in :blush: \n\n\nYou mean you have links to the naked ttf or otf? Not a problem, it works the same.\n\nYes. I think right now the download URL points to the main folder but then each individual font stanza points to each a subdirectory for each font family for that font.\n\n@jrolfs For the patch variants except for \"complete\" I have removed the generating of those going forward. So yeah we will only create casks for the \"complete\" variations as well :smile: \n\n@vitorgalvao Thanks for replying and providing some more info. I actually did read the contributing docs and it really helped me build some test casks :smile: . That being said I could probably go through and read it again a bit more thoroughly :stuck_out_tongue: . \n1. Would it be acceptable to submit you something \"complete\" for just one font for now (e.g., Hack)?\n2. By 'submit' I assume you mean a WIP PR or some other means until it is ironed out?\n\n@jrolfs @vitorgalvao I am using fc-query in the script currently to help build the name to use.\n\n@jrolfs If you have time and want you can actually run the script to see how I am currently generating the cask for 'Hack'. I am not able to run it currently and have not pushed the example it generates\nThanks all.\n. If some one wants to test this... Hack (Knack) should now be available :smile: but seems like it should work just fine (ref: https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-fonts/pull/913)\n\nWill submit one more individual font PR before submitting the rest. The rest is dependent on #32 (we have a script to generate the archives but not done with the upload/release script -- surely don't want to upload them manually). @jrolfs Thanks for testing it out\n\nWorking for me, though do we actually need Mono?\n\nGood question. Well I do know there is a fair number that prefer or have to use mono in their terminal. I think maybe we could create a separate one for mono. something like font-hack-nerd-font and font-hack-mono-nerd-font. \n--\nDoes anyone else have a strong preference regarding including variable width and mono together in the same cask?\nMy gut says to keep it as is but perhaps take it up in the next release because I feel this release is fairly large and long going already :stuck_out_tongue: . @vitorgalvao Do you see any preference regarding this: \n\nI think maybe we could create a separate one for mono. something like font-hack-nerd-font and font-hack-mono-nerd-font.. Thanks. Yeah I am sorry about that. :disappointed: \n\nYou are correct they really should be in a different/separate repo. :+1: \nIt is something that has come to my mind several times but I have yet to address the issue (mostly due to a backlog of other issues).\nworkaround: I know this isn't ideal but you can actually patch any font you want without downloading the entire repo. \nThe only things you should need are font-patcher and the glyph-source-fonts folder.\n\n\nNo, optical fiber cables aren't available in every location yet on this planet.\n\nYeah, it is something I know we all need to think more about if we are lucky enough to have decent connections.\n. Just to be clear I would probably only get around to this if there is enough interest to form a GitHub organization (see #67)\n. This is going to be at least partially fixed in 1.0.0 release (the size issue is addressed). I am very tempted to close this but... I still think it is a valid concern/question. \nThis does depend on #67 though. I will not separate out the fonts from the patcher (and various dependencies) without converting this project to an organization :smile: . Hey, thanks for the report. :+1: \nSorry this is a bit of a pain point at the moment. :cry: \nI really need an automated script to generate previews for the various fonts to help me test them. :grin: \n. In the latest release (v0.8.0) the merge (e0a0), line number (e0a1), lock (e0a2), and original arrows (e0b0 through e0b3) glyphs should now be proper (because it is using the glyphs from the original font).\nThe others still have issues because of the EM sizes which I have yet to address, sorry.\n. @LNQ This should be fixed with the fonts in 0.9.0 branch. Feel free to try it out and thanks :smile: \n. Re-confirmed that this has since been fixed (updating ticket):\n\n\n. Hey that's really cool and a nice idea too! Thanks\n. That is weird, I will try to check that out\n. Sorry, been busy but I promise to check this out (if of course it is still an issue for you?)\n. @arjanfrans Hey thanks for the update I appreciate it!\nClosing for now.\n. It looks to me like one of them is 'true Mono' and the other the glyphs are double width.\nWhich font are you using?\n. Is that a patched version from one of the nerd fonts (https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/DroidSansMono/complete) ?\n. Ah okay I see. But which one those did you install? E.g. Droid Sans Mono for Powerline Nerd Font Complete.otf or Droid Sans Mono for Powerline Nerd Font Complete Mono.otf\nTo me it looks like the 'Mono' version which would explain why those graphs are getting squished\n. @dritter Thanks for the response on powerlevel9k I completely missed that in the message :blush: \n\n@ralpheeee88\nThanks for the updates.\n\nI discovered its better not to install from AUR or use your script to install once cloned as I get the glyph issue\n\nThat's odd but I am glad you got it sorted out\n. Apologies and thanks for the report. I will look into it \n. Ah yeah I was growing impatience in getting v0.7.0 out :blush: \nGood news is this is a somewhat easy fix, fonts that already have powerline glyphs should not get patched by Nerd Fonts. Currently only Hack and Source Code Pro are working correctly in this scenario.\n\nAlso, just wondering if you find the issue template helpful or annoying?\n. Hey, sorry I just haven't had time to look into this but I promise you I will. Thanks :+1: \n. @shellkr @kazuoteramoto Thanks for testing it out and the info here.\nSeems that I was warned about 2to3 changing unicode to str (see #49) so my bad there.\nI can confirm the same error, but the change @kazuoteramoto pointed out seems to work for me:\nfontforge -script font-patcher-py3 ../temp/nerd-fonts/PragmataPro.ttf --powerline --powerlineextra --fontawesome\n\ngranted i just copy and pasted the literal characters directly into the terminal :sweat_smile: \n. You are correct I need to make sure to clear out my patched fonts, I will try a less lazy test today.\nYeah the powerline symbols are definitely off\n. Going to make a bash script to do the 2to3 conversion because of this.\nhttps://docs.python.org/2/library/2to3.html#to3-fixers\n\nunicode\n    Renames unicode to str.\n. @shellkr If you are still having trouble patching PragmataPro or some other font issues feel free to open a separate issue. I am going to close this one (the AttributeError) for 0.8.0 release which I am almost done with :smile: \n. Nice I really like this font!\n\nThe idea of the \"wibbly-wobbly handwriting\" partly reminds me of Operator Mono... :smile: \nThanks\n. @rosshadden Thanks, yep next milestone (well next minor milestone)\n. Yep thanks for creating an issue. I'll aim for next release. Cheers :smile: \n. @be5invis Thanks for chiming in :smile: \nI appreciate your feedback and warnings. :+1: \nI will have to look more into it but I think FontForge can only provide a 'dummy' DSIG which I only currently understand to provide Windows compatibility.\nYou are right possibly the current patch script can't do a complete job and given your feedback maybe it is best to link to a new issue with the items you mentioned from the readme (we did something similar with Hack linking to #70).\nOverall I am pretty naive about the points you mentioned, so unless you are highly against us patching your font I will move forward. Please let me know either wary :blush: \n\nSide note: I am really liking the look of Iosevka so far and will be giving it a test run in my editor for a while. :smile: \n. @be5invis Hey thanks a lot. I will seriously consider drastically changing certain build processes. I am going to open a separate ticket however since this one will be closed for 0.8.0 release\n. @be5invis Great, perfect. Thanks\n. @rawkode Thanks! I will include this in the next release. \nPatching a single font family makes more sense in most cases anyway :laughing: \n. This was successfully merged (your changes are there and contributed properly), I think I just did it in an awkward way :blush: \nClosing.\n. @be5invis I really appreciate all this thanks. Not sure when I will get around to trying it out but I want to! :+1: \n. @be5invis Good idea and that is a pretty clever name :smile: \nI will update the name in the next release (the otfcc patching ... probably will not be soon though :blush:).\n\nAre you wanting or saying you are Reserving the Iosevka name ?\nI did not see the typical 'Reserved Font Name' declaration in the Iosevka License even though the license is SIL OFL like I typically do on OFL licensed fonts (e.g. Hack License)\nMaybe you want to add that to the license (unless I am behind or misunderstanding the license)?\nsource: http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=OFL-FAQ_web#9d7a93f7\n. Heh that is what I wasn't exactly sure about either but it sounds like it from what I was reading. Either way I would have done the name change as it is your font after all :wink: \n. Ah here we go:\nrelated: 5.6\nper 5.7\n\nQuestion: 5.7 Are any names (such as the main font name) reserved by default?\nAnswer: No. That is a change to the license as of version 1.1. If you want any names to be Reserved Font Names, they must be specified after the copyright statement(s).\n. Thanks for the info on the ttf i'll give that a try sometime\n. @be5invis Wow really great stuff thanks :+1: \n\nApologies, I hope you don't take my slow response for lack of interest.\n. @vbauerster oh wow didn't see your comment. We can target it for v1.2.0 release. I'll make a ticket so it's not lost. > update patched iosevka to the latest version 1.9.3\n\nWe can target it for v1.2.0 release. I'll make a ticket so it's not lost\n\n@vbauerster Looks like I dropped the ball on this :cry: . @vbauerster done: #229. Yes you are right in many cases this would be ideal. :+1: \nFontconfig unfortunately I was not aware of when I started on this journey :relaxed: but we should provide something even with a font patcher and providing patched fonts :smile: \n. @lcorsini \n\nbut insanely small glyphs\n\nJust curious were you using the fonts from the 0.9.0 branch ? Because a lot of the size issues have been fixed.\n\nYeah so the main problem with this patching is that with conflicts some glyph set is going to \"win\" and another has to \"lose\" and it seemed like a good choice for font awesome to \"win\" these conflicts and so the font linux and any other that conflict get moved.\n\n\nA common \"glyph-library\" that could be used in fallback or for a easier patching could be easier to maintain and also could be shared and supported by other projects\n\nYeah I agree this would be awesome and I would like that library to be Nerd Fonts :blush: but the project has been mostly focused on patching and not creating a fontconfig. I would love to have a fontconfig available on Nerd Fonts but I just haven't gotten around to it.\n\n\nTo use powerlever9k I made a fork available here: https://github.com/lcorsini/powerlevel9k\n\nlookin' good :+1: \n. Very much a WIP. I am new to fontconfig.. but just pushing up as I work on it\nEdit the WIP: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/commit/3b5dff7b6bf92e3621ac26fa6e191d1f53976f50. @msva Thanks\n\nThat's a good point. I think it has been brought up before or at least I thought about it. Hmm I would say I am leaning toward not doing that because this is more of a grouping of different iconic fonts than it's own custom build (though there have been some custom additions or one-offs). However perhaps in a next major version we could consider this (e.g. v2.0)\nMy answer here kind of follows #1 I would prefer to leave them. the tablet phone one comes that way in the original glyph source.. maybe we could do some tweaks to maximize it but this would go beyond what anything we currently do.\nThanks I have seen the font before but haven't gone too far with color fonts (type3) or svg based ones. Yes colors would be really awesome! I agree\nI am actually working on improving the test script to do something like this :wink: . Here is a peak:\n\n. Good suggestion thanks.\n\nThe issues you are having are probably to do with the em size, you probably aren't doing anything wrong. There are still glyph sizing issues we need to work out when patching :worried: \n. @lcorsini Thanks for the details. Nothing particular is coming to my mind right now but I will try to take a look. :smile: \n. Yes if the license is fine it would be better to just try to patch the TTF like you have done \ud83d\ude04 \nAs for the issues you mentioned I just haven't gotten around to looking into it yet \ud83d\ude1e \n. @lcorsini Can you give more info on the screenshot you provided? What system, editor etc?\nThis appears to be a problem with the ttf file not the patching. I was able to replicate the very distorted characters without antialiasing turned on, on the original ttf and the patched ttf file.\nAnother option would be to patch the bitmap fonts but this would require more work, something similar to how https://bitbucket.org/ZyX_I/bitmap-font-patcher works\n. @lcorsini Thanks for the details. Yeah I can see that being a bitmap font that would be the typical usage. I am marking this as 'future' as I believe it will take a good amount of effort to be able to patch the bitmap version of this font and I think most people will have antialiasing on.\n. No worries (and by the way I can read it just fine :smile:)\nAt first I thought this was likely due to the conflict between Octicons and Font Awesome ranges used (see: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/master/font-patcher#L215-L216)\nHowever the Unicode points you mention are very different than most of Octicons (f000 and above)\nIt definitely looks like you have found a bug because right now the patcher is only taking into account Octicons from range f000 to f0db\nAnother one that seems to be missing as well is device-desktop f27c\n\nQuestion: By the way are you using a 'complete' version font or just a variation with Octicons?\nOn the 'complete' version the Octicons glyph points do change because of the conflict with Font Awesome mentioned above^ so just something to keep in mind as well\n. Thanks\n. This will more than likely be the next thing to be released.\n. I was expecting to get to this quickly before v0.9.0 but that just didn't happen. Since I want to release v0.9.0 soon it makes to move this fix there.\nA full rebuild of all fonts is needed anyway for this fix\n. @minerva1129 This is fixed in 0.9.0 branch. Please give it a try if you can thanks. I will merge to master when ready\n. Ouch, thanks I'll try to look into this\n. Hey good stuff. Sorry I haven't replied until now. This is clever and helpful. I particularly want to steal the print ranges for testing \ud83d\ude04 \n. @lisposter Please try the fonts in 0.9.0 branch if you don't mind. Thanks\n. @jschaf I would love to use what you have or at least the general idea to build some scripts that help with testing the fonts :smile: \n. @jschaf Yeah I agree fully automated would be hard but having some test scripts like this would help a lot for testing :smile: \nBy the way I took your script and updated it with the latest changes in 0.9.0 and also I made changes to get it to work with straight bash :smile: \nWould you like to submit your current version as a PR to get proper contribution? If not I will reference you in the release notes and in the script as an author if you want. Let me know.\nThanks again.. @lisposter any chance you'd be willing to test this out again to see if the issue is solved for you? :smile: . @praveenpuglia Yes, yes it can :smile: \nI just checked the license, so far so good.\nOne thing to be careful on is the Reserved Font Name. It looks like it was previously called \"monoOne\" and only that name is explicitly reserved in the license. I will probably ask about this.\n. @guiceolin \nHey thanks for pinging.\n\nAny progress on this?\n\nNo but you did remind me to open an issue regarding the license.\nThe main concerns now are the license and just checking that all the glyphs look at least decent.\n\nthere is any way to help?\n\nYes possibly, see the instructions for adding a new font. Hopefully it is clear but might not be for the uninitiated.\n\nThis project has been a bit neglected lately and that is my fault but I hope to get back into contributing within a few weeks. I have added some trusted contributors so at least some of the smaller things could be merged in without me.\nI had wanted to fix issues over enhancements but I might reconsider because adding a new font is relatively easy compared to fixing some of the glyph positioning issues\n. @xdaimon Yep we can do that :smile: \nThe license is very... um.. permissive :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: \n\nI see there is a TTF format available on the website, that is the one that will probably be easiest to work with given the current state of the patcher\n. Yes good catch and thanks.\nThere is a problem with one of the scripts building these readmes however, so that probably needs to be fixed at some point :blush: \n. Yikes, yeah I can see a problem with even other glyphs as well.\n\nHonestly it's been a long time since I've looked at what is happening with the single width glyphs, they don't all seem to get adjusted properly.\n. This is probably still a problem but if anyone wants to attempt to see if the fonts in 0.9.0 branch help solve the issues go for it :smile: \n. This looks like a cool font. I like it :smile: \n. Very cool and great idea. I like.\nSince these seem to be standardized maybe we don't need 'yet another variation' and we can just include these by default :smiley: \n. Yes should be possible. I would want to check it out more but looks like adding them should not  cause any specific issues except maybe conflicts \n. @mhartington Hey thanks, yeah I agree it would be cool and even useful to support ligatures. By the way related to this would be #57 \n\nI know this repo has been a bit quiet lately but yes I would and do appreciate any help or effort into improving. \nE.g. there has been a fairly substantial alternate patching proposal in #83 but I just haven't gotten to trying it out or providing much thought :cry: \nfrom @be5invis:\n\nThis script preserves all metadata from the original font, therefore it shares the compatibility of the original font.\n\n\n\nI assume you're renaming these fonts for licensing reasons.\n\nYes exactly the current reason :smiling_imp: \n\nSo in summary I am totally for getting ligatures supported or at the very least not be butchered by the current patcher\n. @controversial Hey yes it is due to licensing (reserved font names)\nPerhaps the readme could be clearer about this.\n. @kierun hey sorry about the frustration but glad you solved it.\nAs for the \"ugly\" glyphs do you mean because the height is a bit too tall or because they are all white with black background? \n. Sorry for the delay. Does it still look blurry?\nGlad you like the project :smile: , I know there are still several bugs.\n. Can you try https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/master/patched-fonts/DejaVuSansMono/Regular/complete/DejaVu%20Sans%20Mono%20for%20Powerline%20Nerd%20Font%20Complete.ttf instead?\nI believe this is related to https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/issues/92#issuecomment-226949765\n. Thanks for the details. Looks like the characters in range 2630 through 2637 (trigrams) are missing even in the unpatched Nerd Fonts powerline source of DejaVu Sans\n\n\nSo it looks like these were missing from the source font Nerd Fonts patches. This is not a bug with Nerd Fonts itself however we could make an improvement to patch in these missing glyphs if detected :smile: \n. These are missing for some reason (along with many other glyphs that are in the Deja Vu Sans condensed).\nI have not attempted to fix all of them (that would take way too long) but I did copy these trigrams from the appropriate condensed version to the mono versions for now.\nI also updated Deja Vu fonts from version 2.33 to 2.37 (see deja vu changelog)\n. What are the alternative ways you are using if you don't mind me asking? Fontconfig? \n. I just quickly scanned through the changes and this seems really great. A lot of work you put into this! Some of the things are over my head but seems like great stuff.\nI am currently away without laptop but when I am back I'll test it out and try to get this into the next release :smile: \nI aslo don't have OS X so if someone with that would be willing to do some sanity checks it would be greatly appreciated\n. Thanks for this and the review, really appreciate it. I'd like some time to review it. Maybe this weekend if I have time. Sorry for the delayed follow-up.\n. Good idea. Yes I looked again and it is still not clear that one does not need to clone the repo and if they contribute shallow should be sufficient. Thanks\n. Good question, it's both a positive of this whole project but also can be a negative :stuck_out_tongue: \nSorry I haven't followed up on this yet until now.\n. Yeah...\n\nOver 5,700 unique combinations/variations of patched fonts\n\nIs more of a bragging point than something actually feasible/useful in real life :wink: \n\nMy thinking on the whole massive amounts of variations issue is that should be addressed but maybe in a few versions (probably 1.0.0) and for now I'd like to move forward with enhancements and easy bugs (to avoid getting stuck on the hard ones). Anyway I am going to put more time into this project again and start preparing for v0.9.0. I'll probably create the branch and merge this in tomorrow :smile: \nRelated:\n- #58 , in particular removing the \"windows\" versions is something I want to do and should be feasible (just name length limitations)\n- #102, shallow cloning\n\n. whoops I did something wrong in the feature branch flow. the changes for this and commits are there but it's just not marked as 'merged'. Hey just looked into this.. at first I thought there could be a problem with the original source font (because the patching doesn't modify those characters).\nBut after some testing are you sure you are not just using the 'small' version of one of the triangles and the other as large?\nCould you provide the unicode value of each just to be sure?\nBelow is Inconsolata for Powerline Nerd Font Complete.otf\n\nI also quickly glanced at several other fonts via Character Map. Sorry but I cannot test on OSX.\nThanks\n. @jedahan Thanks for trying it out again. I will take another look :smile: \n. Looks nice. Thanks\n. 1. Do you get that message only on the install script?\n2. Does the font actually install (copy)?\n3. Can you try to run other bash scripts to see if you get similar fontconfig warnings and errors?\nThe install script (before the much more advanced one recently merges see #101) simply copies files from the repo to the OS specific appropriate fonts folder.\nQuick search, this could be similar/possibly related: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=186894\nBut as of now I do not see this being something to do with Nerd Fonts itself :relaxed: \n. @peter73421 I am closing this for now. Feel free to follow up if you still have the issue or any questions. Thanks\nI am fairly certain this is not an issue with Nerd Fonts itself. First of all I saw this PR just after you submitted it so sorry for the delay.\nI haven't had time to deeply go through your changes but did look them over.\nI must say this is pretty impressive and might fix quite a few lingering issues as well.\nIt looks like you have spent a good amount of time and effort on these fixes so I really appreciate that.\n\nI ended up doing some minor refactoring (normalizing indent amounts, removing unused variables, etc) in the process, so I completely understand if my changes are too drastic for a pull.\n\nIt looks good to me. I'm all for these changes (as long as it doesn't create new problems)\n. Cool thanks. Yes I will check it out.\nI typically do the merging  (at least for now).\nThe soonest this would be merged would probably be this weekend.\nTrivial changes I do try to merge to master asap. \ud83d\ude04 \n. So I just quickly tested this out on a few different fonts (em 2048 and 1000) with and without mono option.\nDo you realize what you have done??? This is going to single-handedly fix a handful of issues and problems! :+1: :tada: :scream: \nThis is really going to make a huge difference. Much thanks indeed!\n. @sharkusk More good stuff thanks! Please let me know when you are done committing I would like to merge this into 0.9.0\nI did do some small patcher changes but nothing like yours! So I'll have to redo them in the much better refactored version :smile: \n. @santagada If you checkout the branch or just download the font-patcher from sharkusk's branch  you could test it out :smile: \nIf you don't want to do that let me know and  I can send you an updated patched version. Just tell me which font you use.\n. @sharkusk I have merged into 0.9.0 thanks. No problem on the accidental close I think we've all done it \ud83d\ude04 \n\n@santagada Sure. I was trying to get this done yesterday but I was fixing a few things. I am trying to improve the rebuild all script to make generating the combinations easier going forward.\nI'll make sure to ping here when I'm done.\n. @sharkusk Sorry but I have been busy... that includes doing some work in the 0.9.0 branch though :wink:\nYeah you are correct those gaps aren't maintained.. I am not sure that that's necessarily a bad thing though since at some point theoretically we would run out of codepoints :stuck_out_tongue: \nI would say at least for now we keep that functioning as is at least for 0.9.0 , maybe I will change my mind if I think about it some more or if it causes confusion in the future :+1: \n. @santagada Feel free to test out fonts in 0.9.0 branch :smiling_imp: \n. @santagada Well I can definitely see what you mean by the scaling issues but the vertical alignment looks good for me (though I am not on macOS):\n3270 Mono (size 14):\n\n3270 Non Mono (size 14):\n\n\nAlso I forgot to actually build the NON-mono fonts ... whoops! Those might work better for you, at least the scaling won't be so small.\nBelieve it or not the issues you are showing are a vast improvement to how a lot the glyphs looked before.. so I am actually encouraged so far :smile: \n. > @ryanoasis Did you pull 96eafa9 and 7cd183b?  Those should maximize the glyph size, while still keeping the relative glyphs (i.e. arrows, etc) sized correctly.\n@sharkusk Hey good catch. I did not merge those latest changes in the 0.9.0 branch. I was hoping to do that just now.. let me see if I can get things up-to-date without conflicts... else I will do it tomorrow\n. @sharkusk I have resolved conflicts and merged your latest branch into 0.9.0\nIf you plan on making more commits to your branch can you please merge the 0.9.0 branch into your branch? :smile: Thanks\nI will test out the fonts some more tomorrow.. Thanks all!\n. I fixed some errors as a result of the merge. Please take the latest 0.9.0 \nDid some quick tests and yes scale isssues seem to be fixed :+1:\nI will rebuild the fonts on 0.9.0 again today\n. @santagada Sure thanks\n. @santagada Thanks for testing again. \n1. Are you using the Mono or non-Mono version?\n2. Can you supply a screenshot?\n. @santagada Thanks I appreciate it. 'More or less' is actually a huge improvement compared to before so I will take it! :smile: ... and I don't expect it to be perfect at least for this next release\n. I believe we can close this now:\n\nreadme codepoints have been fixed: #116, #165 (https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/commit/efb00075c8919c14bb762ac6f20d87471819e221), #138 \nthere are now multiple ways to get the codepoints:\nhttps://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#icon-names-in-shell (via #145 #147)\n./bin/scripts/test-fonts.sh\nthere is a searchable \"cheat sheet\" on the website: http://nerdfonts.com/#cheat-sheet. Trying to catch up here. Let me know if I miss something...\n\n\nhttps://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/master/glyph-source-fonts/PowerlineExtraSymbols.otf has \"Droid Sans Mono for Powerline Plus Nerd File Types Mono:style=Regular\" as its name (according to fc-list).\n\nThis was created in a rush and so while it does have the 'extra powerline symbols' it also has other glyphs and metadata that it shouldn't :blush: \n\nThat's why I've noticed that the name for PowerlineExtraSymbols is off.\n\nOh okay sure, yeah I think this ideally should be fixed\n\nIt is the same for the extra font I guess (which has \"Create Powerline symbol only font for fontconfig\" as TODO left).\n\nYeah ideally we would have a fontconfig for all of these symbols so alternatively users could forgo having to use a patched font (where fontconfig is supported).\n\nbtw: I wonder if it would make sense to re-use existing codepoints for a specialized PowerlineSymbols font, e.g. from the geometric shapes block (http://shapecatcher.com/unicode/block/Geometric_Shapes)?!\nThis way it would look OKish without a powerline font already..\n\nAh okay I think you are saying to have a font that overrides these locations with a powerlinish version and fallback to the originals without? Interesting idea for sure. I am not sure that would be a high priority when you look at the current issues and improvements that are still needed :stuck_out_tongue: :worried: \n\nWhat about providing a PowerlineExtraSymbols font, which contains only the Powerline symbols (plus the extra ones)?\n\nThis is what the PowerlineExtraSymbols font on that other repo ideally should have but in the rush of creating it that's not the case :disappointed: \n\nor is it necessary to be scaled in some way according to the base font?\n\nYeah there are scaling issues still, I am not sure off the top of my head which EM it currently has but the patcher isn't doing scaling correctly at the moment.\n. Thanks, good catch.\n. @santagada Mostly yes, yes it should \ud83d\ude04 \n. Fixed/closed with v1.0.0. Apologies and thank you. Good work on the font by the way \ud83d\udc4d \nI have tried my best to respect all the fonts licenses especially after making some mistakes early on. I think somehow here I \"just missed it\". I will also add the repo link\nI will fix and merge this asap\n. Can you please provide more information?\nI am not able to understand what problem you are having.\nThanks\n. Hmm I think this message is a bit misleading so my apologies.\nThis comes if the fontforge python support is not installed.\nCan you try this brew install fontforge --with-python ?\nEdit: Actually I would try if you can execute fontforge from the command line first. I think it depends if it has the python bindings.\nAre you able to execute fontforge from command line?. @CavalcanteLeo \nI am glad you got it figured out :smile: \nThat is weird I am not sure why you were having troubles but doesn't seem to be related to Nerd Fonts itself. Can we close this issue?\n\nIt seemed like you went through some pain getting things setup :worried: but if you would like to make it easier for all of us going forward please feel free to contribute to the dev setup of the wiki. \nBy the way this is what I started working on after my primary OS itself stopped working just recently... so I was having to set things up all over again :laughing: :sob: . @kaymmm Hey thanks for this I do appreciate it :smile: \nSorry for the delay. We have been hard at work on v1.0.0 :smile: \n\nbut the README doesn't make mention of this\n\nYeah... and this has caused confusion before... which is clearly understandable. I had been wanting to change this on the readme as well so I agree 100%\n\nIt doesn't make sense to have two screenshots on the README with both sets of codepoints, but maybe it could go in the Wiki?\n\nAgain I agree with this. README should have the codepoints for the 'complete' variation and maybe below a link to the Wiki to view the original codepoints. Something like that I think you are saying.\nI envision it as something like this:\n\nOcticons\n\nGitHub's icons. / repo / (website)\n\nNerd Font Complete Codepoints:*\n\n* To avoid conflicts between icon sets these were modified. To view the original codepoints see the Wiki\n\nAny thoughts? I am open to any suggestions that make things better and easier :smile: . Thanks, we'll go with that. @Magauran That'd be awesome! \ud83d\ude04 . I know we get quite a bit of Russian speaking visitors.\nLet me know if you need anything from me.. @hiby90hou That would be great! Thanks! \ud83d\ude04 \nLet us know if you need anything.. @cy91244 That'd be great. I am all for this :smile: \n@Billy4195 Yeah. I agree. Thank you :smile: . @morrme Yep, that is basically correct :smile: \nPreferably there would be some sort of defined variable I think as well, for example see: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/master/bin/scripts/upload-archives.sh#L24\nLet me know if you have any other questions or suggestions (open to any good ones :blush: ). @morrme Yes it should be in my opinion :smile: . @vladyio Hey thanks however I think @morrme chimed in first.\nI believe @morrme is taking up this item. Are you taking this on @morrme ?\n\n@vladyio, if @morrme is not working on it you could take it up. If not you could take on other issues or possibly other improvements or general standardization on the scripts if you have ideas :smile: \n\nedit: @vladyio Looks like you already started working on this :worried: let's see what @morrme says :smile: . @vladyio No worries (some of that is my fault). I really appreciate the initiative you took however and looked like you were making good progress :smile: \nI hope this doesn't dissuade you from possibly contributing to other tickets or opening a Pull Request of anything you might have found in the scripts! :blush: \nWould love to have more contributors :heart: . @andrewimeson Awesome sounds great so far. Thanks for contributing :smile: \n\nShould I make a pull request now, or is there more work that needs to be done?\n\nProbably more work to be done but the PR can be a WIP too. Let me think about this a little? :blush: \nI am also going to go ahead and remove most of the labels so no one else works on this :smile: . @andrewimeson Ah yes that makes more sense. You have my support to go ahead with the separate PRS \ud83d\ude04 . @waseem18 Thanks! That'd be great! :smile: \nYes I believe that is correct there are only 2 python scripts currently.\nI will remove the up for grabs label for now, this is all yours for now!\nI don't have any particular suggestions but if I do I'll let you know. Also if you have any doubts feel free to ping me.. @waseem18 still have interest in taking this up or can I open it back up?\nThanks :smile: . @waseem18 Thanks for responding. I completely understand :smile: . I only asked now because I might soon take this on myself or open it back up.\nThat said we would love to have any contribution no matter how big or small from you in the future if you find yourself with any extra time. :smiley: . @OmarB97 Thank you. This pretty much what was desired \ud83d\udc4d \ud83d\ude04 . Sure. Always open to any help... And as you can see PRs get merged on this project. @No0n3Left Thanks for the details here :smile: \nI wonder if you get the same warnings if you install only one or the other and not both (only mono or only non-mono version of the font) ?. @nathanchere Yep thank you. I see your point that it is not very clear and in this case very contradictory :blush: . Yeah actually the way things are now I would agree it would probably be better for the install script to download the fonts from the repo (at least that'd be my vote at the moment).\nThe file paths should be more reliable now (at least on 1.x versions) the one thing that will probably change on the minor version changes could be the filenames themselves.\nAlso since 1.0.0 I believe some of the options on the install script are no longer relevant (minimal and the other patches options) because we have removed all but the Complete variations due to repo size concerns.. For now I think we will rewrite and condense (combine) some of the installation options as they stand now. Per @nathanchere there are some obvious contradictions :blush: \n@zeorin Yep that totally makes sense! I think downloading also looks like the way to go now.. or maybe make it the default with an option to look in the current patched-fonts directory. Yeah.. the paths.. they were changing quite a bit but have been mostly stable but that's a good point to consider.\n@nathanchere the \"also repeatedly say don't clone the entire repo\" I believe is too strong now. I think it is a holdover from when this repo used to be ridiculously large (gigabytes to clone) but now we don't create every variation font file but instead only the \"complete\" variations.. This has since been done: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/wiki/Real-World-Mentions-&-Usage-(Sightings). Hmm that's weird. I'll look into it. Thanks . Ouch. Thank you both for the details. I will try to take a look this weekend if I get the chance. Can either/both of you tell me the exact font using? Most importantly if it ends in Complete Mono ?. @jayywolff Thanks for the update. Good observation on those affected.\nI think the root cause/fix is to make sure the 'mono' versions internal name have 'mono' somewhere so they don't conflict with 'non-mono'. Right now if you install both it is seen as one, as far as I know.\n\n. @kiuKisas can let us know if @jayywolff suggestion works for you?\nThanks :smile: . @RuRo thanks for the details. can you please try the Knack Regular Nerd Font Complete (non-mono) variant?\nthe Mono variants it is expected that the glyphs are a bit on the small size (to main scale in a fixed-width glyph). @RuRo Okay sure let me know how it goes. :smile:\nAs for the size, I think it just looks that way as you say. It is a bit deceiving until you highlight or change the background color that it becomes more obvious:\n\nThe first 2 glyphs look like they could be a bit larger but not much without the ratio changing (stretching). @RuRo First thanks for your thoughts and ideas. I can sense some frustration you may have had, if so sorry about that :worried: \n\nIs there really no way to have the cake and eat it? Maybe something hacky, like splitting the smaller characters into 2 monospaced parts.\n\nHmm yeah this is an interesting idea. I actually thought about doing something like this too for issues we've had with ambiguous glyph width handling in Vim but I am not sure how feasible it is and managing this I can see being a nightmare :worried: \nFor the \"double width\" sorry if there was any confusion. If you have any ideas for making things more clear in the readme please let me know.\nSo I guess you realized that the way to go is to use the 'double width' variant (depending on terminal support).\n\nP.S. Konsole and Yakuake don't seem to support double width characters. Can somebody reccomend a drop down terminal that does?\n\nGuake Terminal seems to support non-mono fonts.\n. @RuRo Thanks for the details.\nCan you tell me which font and font size you are using by the way?\nHopefully the alignment issues will at least be mostly solved in v1.1.0, here is how it is showing for me:\n\nAs for the GitHub logo you can try to use the 'other' set:\n\n. Fonts just uploaded... probably won't improve anything here but if anyone would like to test them out that'd be great :smile: . Thanks @shibumi sorry for the very late reply. I'll try to take a look at Inconsolata. @myrage2000 can you provide a screenshot? \nThis is probably to be expected in URxvt, see: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/wiki/Terminal-Emulators#urxvt. @Hebgbs thanks for the report (and a detailed one at that!). I will look into it when I get some time but I cannot promise when :disappointed: . I know I never got around to looking into this for you but the latest fonts for v1.1.0 have just been uploaded.. let me know if they improve things if you can :smile: . Since this doesn't have anything directly to do with any of the Nerd Font scripts I think I am content with closing this issue when we have a wiki page for things like this :smile: \n\nThanks for the details everyone!. Considering this closed now, added info on the wiki: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/wiki/FAQ-and-Troubleshooting#munmap_chunk-invalid-pointer\nfeel free to update with additional details. @sodiumjoe Hey thanks for contribution :smile: . I cannot promise when I will do the merge but you can be sure it will happen :wink: . Ping. haven't forgotten about this. will definitely go in next release. @sodiumjoe Sorry that I haven't gotten to this yet. I thank you for your patience and your contribution. \nWe are finally making some progress toward getting a dev branch up with all the latest fixes, etc. Also I think we are going to improve the process (and therefore time) to merge in PRs. @sodiumjoe I was thinking about doing releases once a month:\n- whatever is merged into master at that time would go in the release\n- items that don't make it wouldn't hold up the entire release\n- items that don't make it would get their chance in the next release\nI am open to any suggestions or thoughts you may have on this or ways to improve. Hey thanks for the PR but actually it is not a typo and is done on purpose to comply with licensing. Particularly SIL Open Font License (OFL). \nSome fonts have parts of their name 'reserved', Fira for example: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/master/src/unpatched-fonts/FiraCode/LICENSE.txt\nIn particular this part:\n\nNo Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font\nName(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding\nCopyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as\npresented to the users.\n\nThis is probably not very clear in the readme and is not explicitly mentioned in the FAQ either.\nFeel free to submit a PR that might clarify the name changes or feel free to contribute the FAQ :smile: . Hey thanks for the PR (and fixes, good catch).\nJust commented on one small change that seems wrong. Hey thanks for the fix.\n\nmistakenly written at some point\n\nYeah that was me :relaxed: I don't actually use Mac OS so I do a lot of the doc and contribution for it blindly. Ah I was trying to make mention of the search to find the correct Nerd Font:\nhttps://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-fonts#search-for-a-font\nBut that can be mentioned better or elsewhere. @dan-santana Hmm good point. Not sure why we only have regular versions. Thanks!. Going to upgrade Ubuntu fonts to version from 0.80 to 0.83 and add the missing ones (non mono) from here: http://font.ubuntu.com/. @Cpt0r Thanks but this is actually on purpose and not an issue. :smile: \nFor more info why see: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/pull/131#issuecomment-280954653\n\nI will create an issue to make name changes clearer. No worries @Cpt0r I am creating the issue right now! You are not the only one confused :wink: . Thanks again @agriffis,\nConfirmed that the readme gives the wrong codepoints (it gives the original codepoints which cannot be used due to conflict)\nDiscussed on the gitter chat. > I thought about updating it too, but I was surprised to see readme.md making image references from the wiki. I haven't seen that technique before on github, so I left off.\nYeah that might not be the best place to put these images going forward if it's harder for people to contribute.\nI think I carried that method over from VimDevIcons but in that project the purpose was to offload the images to reduce download size when users update their plugin.. in Nerd Fonts that's probably a stupid reason because the repo is already so large that a few additional images shouldn't matter.\nAny thoughts anyone else?. @PrzemekSkw Love your desktop wallpaper. Yeah this is probably not the best place for this as @agriffis mentioned but one thing you will have to change the mode to the nerd fonts one. Honestly I am not sure the best way to modify a specific segment to insert a specific glyph.\n@agriffis Yes that is best thanks. I agree original reason I gave makes no sense. I saw the PR thanks for that. Will merge by this weekend :+1:. Hmm those shouldn't be modified but I will take a look. Thanks!. @sencer I am not seeing this. Can you add more detail or a screenshot? Also which 2 fonts exactly are you comparing?. closing this. @sencer please feel free to re-open if you can provide some more details :smile: thanks. @Cpt0r hmm so when I saw your screenshot I thought it was an issue. Seems like fontbook is grouping them without considering the 'Mono' portion. I think we only have that in the filename :thinking: . @Cpt0r Yeah this actually does look like an issue (if someone is going to use both mono and non-mono versions). That's troubling \ud83d\ude1f but thanks for the report. @sharkusk did a lot of great work fixing issues (in particular the mono issues) :smile: but I think we can carry over some of his logic to apply to both mono and non-mono versions of fonts, in particular to:\n\nvertical center the glyphs\nstretch the powerline glyphs\n\nI am pretty confident we want to do #1 but not sure on doing #2\nHere are some screenshots with my tweaks to the patcher:\n\nthis is with #1 change applied:\n\nthese are with #1 and #2 change applied:\n\n\n. @Cpt0r Thanks, I will test that version too. This is working well so far but I have some more tweaking for the powerline glyphs to do.\nHere is a before and after for Sauce Code Pro:\n\n. Not sure on that. I'll have to check in more detail. Thanks. @ddnexus No branch yet. I'll try to create one this weekend or if not at least a gist diff. Didn't get around to it today. Maybe tomorrow . @ddnexus here you go: https://gist.github.com/ryanoasis/1b9a525aa3b5cad40c66d5e1d84c9b4d\nvery much a WIP (fixing a couple issues at the same time). If you manage to test it out let me know how it works for you...\nI am considering also just getting a dev/next branch up that is up to date with WIP stuff... but not yet decided. @matthew-groth Did you re-clear font cache? @ddnexus might be right (try patching an un-yet patched font). Also I would remove whatever nerd fonts you have, clear cache, run patcher on unpatched font, close terminals and re-open. Might this is overkill but might be something missing in those steps\n\nLooking at your output all I can think is \"really need to fix that progress bar\" :blush: . @ddnexus Thanks for the feedback on the WIP, I really appreciate it. I will try to reply to your comments sometime tomorrow. \nFor now I am working on some test scripts to help make testing easier, preview:\n\nAlso I will push a dev branch up tomorrow\n. @ddnexus Just fixed one of the points you raised:\n\nHorizontal scale is WRONG. The x scale ratio should be the same as y, instead the glyphs are stretched/shortened to the single char width. That is OK for the mono (single width variant) but not OK for the regular variant\n\nYou can see mono (left side) and non-mono (right side):\n\n\n\nThe scale factor is huge! Especially compared to the Devicons. (E.g. compare the dimensions of the python logo in the 2 sets and you will have a huge scale ratio difference.)\n\nFrom top to bottom: Mono, non-Mono (reduced size), non-Mono (original large size):\n\n. @ddnexus Sure thank you. There are still some spacing problems as you can see but I think we are moving in a good direction. Also this is being updated in the dev branch.. @Cpt0r Thanks for the update \ud83d\udc4d . I'll see what I can do... it's getting there\nBy the way master has all those fixes and tweaks that dev had now.\nProbably going to abandon dev for simpler workflow . Actually yeah np on the etiquette. This was auto closed because of my commit message reference. @Cpt0r I will test patching Hurmit on my end and get back to you. Thanks \ud83d\udc4d . Thanks for the update. Glad you got it sorted out :smile: . @powerman Hey thanks for this! Really great :smile: \nJust FYI trying to build a script for output/testing, you can see some progress here: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/issues/84#issuecomment-288576052\nYeah if this was on the wiki I think it would have to be as images but you are right using it on a page with the font actually loaded would be very helpful!\nPerhaps on the website (http://nerdfonts.com/) It's pretty bare-bones right now but I do envision it having the glyphs there and even searchable. The site is currently living in the gh-pages branch. @msva Great nice script. Feel free to submit a Pull Request to add it to Nerd Fonts :smile: \n\nAre you referring to the glyph at e613 yes it was the original folder from Seti UI. The other folders I added and customized from other sources (in particular to have an open folder as well).\nYes those look to be too low as you mention. It was not intended no. It should hopefully be fixed in v1.1.0 Release (see below for a preview). You can also look into: #142\nYeah I see that problem, again hopefully we can fix in v1.1.0\n\nBy the way which font were you using in your screenshot?\nPreview of fixes coming in v1.1.0*\n| Before fix (left side) | After fix (right side) |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n|  |  |\n\nStill a Work-In-Progress. @msva not sure exactly but you can probably find a decent fontforge python script on github. @mr-ubik Sorry for any current confusions. To answer your question yes, see: #149. @mr-ubik Sure no problem :smile: I am going to assume you mean help in general (not with the codepoints specifically):\n\nThings that need help:\n\nIn general any ideas, PRs, bug reports, testing is appreciated :smile: \nthe wiki, in particular:\nTerminal Emulators\nDeveloper Setup macOS/osx section\nScreenshots (not sure if this is worth creating, maybe?)\n\n\nLet me know if I misunderstood your question. @powerman I think we can now consider this closed because of combination of merged PR #147 and Cheet Sheet\nPlease comment or re-open if you disagree. Thanks!. @powerman That's just... awesome :tada: \nI would :heart: to see this in the Nerd Fonts repo :blush: \n\nYeah the powerline extra symbols I didn't give official names (can work on that) and yes there were some other custom ones added. On Devicons not sure why some might not have.\nIf you want I can try to add this to the next release (1.1) I just haven't spent much time on dev :cry: so maybe this weekend I can get a preliminary branch together for 1.1 :smile: \n\nThis is not exactly related but I am working on a test script that will print out the glyphs but that is mostly for testing the font after patching where these scripts you mention are more for use in scripts (like you mentioned). Nevertheless here is some preview:\n(WIP)\n\n. If you would like to create a branch here go for it you have my blessing :smile: (just please not master -- though I don't think you can).\nI will create a 1.1 branch this weekend I believe\nI think in bin/scripts makes sense but maybe there could be another sub-dir there.. I am not 100% sure. I will think about it some more.. Closed with PR #147. @powerman Hey thanks for the report. I am seeing the same. It looks like this is how it is in the source (octicons).\nWill do some more investigating.. but looks like to fix this would have to be some tweaking to the patcher script. Thanks for this again. Hopefully this weekend but we'll see . @powerman This looks good to me at a glance. Question: How did you build the glyph variables listed: $i_* ? Looks like it was by hand or did you have some helper script?\nMy only worry going forward is keeping the lists up to date :smile: in case we upgrade any of the glyph sets and get new glyphs or add more glyph sets.\nThanks. @powerman Makes sense!\n\nVim-kung-fu to convert them\n\nWow that's impressive,thanks for this :smile: . Wow your script(s) already proved their worth!\nI made a script that used them that eventually helped me make this: \nhttp://nerdfonts.com/#cheat-sheet\n. @aloisdg Woah I haven't noticed that! Thanks for the fix! :smile: \nThis had rendered correctly before, seems like a recent GitHub change has caused this. Perhaps: https://github.com/blog/2333-a-formal-spec-for-github-flavored-markdown. @aloisdg Yep sure that makes sense. Actually I see another issue down below I will fix. I think there will be quite a few repos on GitHub with some fixes needed :laughing: . Hah you are probably right :smile: \nThanks again for the PR, inspired me to make some improvements to the readme and wiki :blush: . Great. Thank you.. :+1: Will do a quick review this weekend and merge.\nMaybe with 1.1 as well but less sure on that. @BigfootN Thanks for your screenshots. Honestly I am not sure what's going on there. I can try to take a look in some time but not sure when that'll be.. @BigfootN Sure no problem. which font is being used currently?. Thanks all. :smile: So is this resolved?. @BigfootN Sure no problem. Wish I could do more.\nAm I to understand this may be more of an issue related to urxvt ? It is not related specifically to the Nerd Font version of the font?\nWe can leave this issue open for now.... @BigfootN \nSure no problem. Glad you were able to figure things out :smile: \nFeel free to add any helpful info, examples, or links to: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/wiki/Terminal-Emulators\nCan we close this issue?. @mftrhu No worries, especially since you added useful information others may find helpful! Appreciate that :smile: \n\nAdditionally I have tried to add at least some basic info that might make it easier to find help on these kind of things:\n- https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/wiki/FAQ-and-Troubleshooting#why-do-the-glyphs-look-small-squished-or-not-full-width\n- https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/wiki/Terminal-Emulators#urxvt\n. @agriffis This makes sense to me. :+1: \nIt has the powerline symbols in this 2.37 version vs the 2.33 version (powerline patched).\nOne thing I noticed is that the readme.rst seems to be from the Powerline version, we probably want to replace it with the readme.md from: https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/. Yeah that is the readme I was referring to.\nThe readme just has to go in the src/unpatched-fonts/DejaVuSansMono directory.\nThe standardize-and-complete-readmes.sh will take search and build readmes for the patched versions :smile: . Sure thanks. @agriffis Hmmmm I understand, however doesn't the py3 version not work for you? :thinking: . @agriffis Sure no problem\n\nWhy have two versions though?\n\nThe reason there are 2 versions is because the script was initially written for python 2.x but there was a request to have a script that can run with python 3.x (#49)\n\nIt's trivial to make one script compatible with both\u2014that's what this PR does.\n\nYeah it seems like it is trivial as long as the users have at least 2.7.x as far as I understand it (then we can use the future pkg).\n\nCan we just kill font-patcher-py3?\n\nIf this script will work in 2.7+ (which seems like it would work in 2.6+) then yes we can. I still think a better question is: should we?\n\nDo you have any particular experiences on future vs maintaining both (using 2to3) ?\nUnmodified code (py2 and py3) using __future__ (single script) vs maintaining py 2 codebase and running2to3 pros and cons?\n\nmaintaining both: cleanly/clearly separates the codebases, py3 doc discourage writing for both versions\nunmodified code: don't have to worry about running 2to3 each time, 2to3 seems like it is not perfect\nI was doing a small amount of googling though as to what the best way to maintain for both versions, just some interesting links:\n https://wiki.python.org/moin/PortingToPy3k/BilingualQuickRef\n https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html\n Supporting Python 2 and 3 without 2to3 conversion\n https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3\n* http://python3porting.com/strategies.html\nI might be overthinking this :blush: . @agriffis You definitely have more knowledge and experience with this. I think I will need to take some more time to digest the options but starting to lean toward your opinion. Thanks again.\nDidn't know/realize that about argparse, I think targeting >= 2.7 is more than sufficient. Maybe tomorrow :sleeping: :zzz: \nReally this is much better though when you made me re-think my workflow. So thanks for that!. @agriffis Sorry for the delay on this. I was merging this in today but realized I could no longer test it. I am going to test it in a virtual machine. Not sure what I messed up in merging this but got officially in via GitHub button merge :roll_eyes: . @Eremiell Thanks for this suggestion I will check it out :smile: \nThanks for the kind words. Also yes I understand your reason for the fallback approach (I was completely new to that even existing when starting this :blush:) but it seems they both have their place.\nBtw, there is a --custom flag in the patcher but having an explicit option is always better :smile: . Yep thanks again. I am aware of them but I honestly haven't explored the possibility of adding them too deeply yet :smile: \nYeah I am not sure about the feasibility either, that is a good concern to raise :thinking: \n\nStill, I found no mention of it anywhere, so I wanted to bring it to the sight.\n\nYep, I can understand that. Thanks @georgelemental \ud83d\udc4d . @georgelemental That does look like a nice project unfortunately it looks like it is now unmaintained:\n- last commit was 2 years ago\n- Is the project still alive? #110. @akatrevorjay That is a very legit concern/question.\nJust in the Private Use Area we have up to 6.4k codepoints, it can be much larger if we can use the full unicode encoding.\n\nThe Basic Multilingual Plane includes a PUA in the range from U+E000 to U+F8FF (6400 code locations). Plane Fifteen and Plane Sixteen have a PUAs that consist of all but their final two code locations, which are designated non-characters. The PUA in Plane Fifteen is the range from U+F0000 to U+FFFFD (65534 code locations).. @powerman Thanks. You may feel free to add/edit the Wiki :smile: Just created this page for instance: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/wiki/Terminal-Emulators. Thanks people :smile: \n\nClosing via:\n- https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/wiki/FAQ-and-Troubleshooting#why-do-the-glyphs-look-small-squished-or-not-full-width\n- https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/wiki/Terminal-Emulators#urxvt. @RiccardoMPesce Ah you are using the py3 version of the patcher right? I haven't updated that yet.\nYou did pull the latest of master ?\nAnyway here are the results of Droid for me:\nbefore fix:\n\nafter fix:\n\nLet me update the py3 version and you can retry :smile: . > EDIT. it is the same. However, the blue line is less noticeable.\nWell that is at least some good news. I was going to say maybe you needed to clear your font cache and close all terminals.. but it sounds like you are seeing a difference?\n\nAlso for me the powerline glyph was more appropriately vertically centered. Did you notice any change with that as well?\nAlso, would you mind posting an updated screenshot?. @RiccardoMPesce Thanks for the updates. I'm unsure how to change those items in oh_my_zsh at the moment. We can look into this more.... @LER0ever Thanks I did not know this! :smile: :+1: . Project has since changed name and purpose a bit. Now called \"font-logos\".\nHere is a screenshot of what we have in Nerd Fonts vs what's available in the current font-logos:\n\nFor reference: https://github.com/lukas-w/font-logos/issues/32. @sambadevi Yeah there are definite duplicates! Which happens when aggregating so many sets :smile: however right now there is no plan to try to remove duplicates, we let them coexist.\nIs OpenSUSE Tumbleweed part of font-logos ? I don't see that only OpenSUSE. @sambadevi Looks pretty cool. Something similar to the left side of this image: https://news.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tumbleweed.png ?. @sambadevi Ah gotcha. Let's see, I wonder if Font Linux has any plans to add it.... @RiccardoMPesce Thanks for the report but I don't think the issue is with Nerd Fonts.\n\n. @RiccardoMPesce Seems like this is not an issue. I am going to close this for now.\nThank you both.. Hey Marcus! It's been a while :smile: . Thanks for this, I had no idea. Seems like a cool option for those who don't want to go the patched fonts route :+1: \nGood idea to add both of these to the wiki. I am totally up for that. Not sure when I would get around to that.. I did a lot of wiki work recently ... now I am on a website dev binge :laughing: \n\nBy the way either of you: feel free to contribute to the wiki to make it better if you desire. No worries there. @lucasreed It's all yours \ud83d\ude04 . Let me know if you have any questions or need any help. I'll need to update the contribution list but I am considering this closed for now.\nThanks again @lucasreed \n. > I did automate the initial populating of data to the gh-pages md file to save myself some time, but it was more of a one-off script.\nDo you mind posting or linking to this just in case it becomes useful?. @lucasreed Sounds good thanks. No rush!. Thanks @lucasreed . @SAPikachu Appreciate this report. Thank you :+1: \nDo you know if the issue happens when using the un-patched version of the font: Anonymice Powerline ?. @SAPikachu thanks for the update! :smile: Seems like it is an issue with the original unpatched (but Powerline patched font).\nWhat if you try the true Anonymous Pro ?. @SAPikachu Thanks again. This doesn't seem to be an issue with Nerd Fonts. Also those characters seem to not be coming from any of these fonts but rather from Noto Sans CJK JP.\nI have the same issue with terminal compare to gnome-terminal. Best case these characters seem too low vertically? Worst case they are cut off at the bottom.\n\nI was able to improve things just a bit with line spacing but like I said they are still appearing too low:\n\n. @be5invis Thanks for chimming in :smile: \nLooks like gnome-terminal does a better job at least in this sense. I haven't played around with many term emulators recently and certainly not with CJK range :blush: \nHere is an interesting possibly related issue: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/318909/how-do-i-fix-this-text-rendering-issue-in-konsole\nHere is another interesting comparison of some breakdown:\n\n. So this seems like terminal specific issue for sure. I am going to close this for now.\nThanks all :smile: . @morrme Thanks! :smile: :1st_place_medal: \n\nI left the python file as it was, with the file-specific prefix. I can change that if you'd like.\n\nThat's fine, you, we, or someone can do that later :smile: \n\n... added the constant for consistency.\n\nMuch appreciated! :+1: \n\nThanks for being so welcoming!\n\nSure! That's the idea here, it's been something I like to see in OSS projects. :blush: \n\nI think this looks mostly good to merge but I did see a few places where the prefix could be used. I will leave comments. @morrme Ahhh okay I see what you meant/mean now. Sorry about that!\nYou don't have to change it. I will leave it up to you if you want.. I'll say it's an optional change. I will merge this in tomorrow :smile: . > would you want the current prefix (which is the name of the file) replaced with [Nerd Fonts] or would you like both prefixes?\nIMHO I think all of these files should have the Nerd Fonts prefix and then secondarily have whatever prefix they had before afterwards.. > I'm still pretty new to GitHub but I've tried to contribute in any way I could and I've encountered all types of people.\nIsn't that the truth! :cry: Unfortunately not all are very nice.. some frustrations unfortunately get taken out on potential contributors (especially newer GitHub users). @morrme Well congrats. Sounds like you're enjoying it.\nI agree with what you said as well.. @morrme Sure no problem.\nI prefer the first variation: \"[Nerd Fonts] [filename.py] {rest of message}\" with the leading # of course :smile: . @morrme Thanks for taking this up and contributing :+1: . @JayceCao hey thanks for the report and details :+1: . I will try to test this out but honestly it probably won't be anytime soon :blush: . @kierun Is that Terminess font? Is it the mono?. Yeah there is a problem here :worried: \nSo for me it seems to work fine with mono variants but not the other:\nurxvt -fn \"xft:TerminessTTF Nerd Font Mono:regular:size=15\". I know you shouldn't have to switch fonts.. but.. I seem to be having success with other fonts :thinking::\nurxvt -fn \"xft:SauceCodePro Nerd Font:regular:size=15\". @ELLIOTTCABLE Thanks for the report. Actually it is nothing that you are doing wrong. I ran into this yesterday as well. I did not test the patcher fully with the latest changes. \nFor now you can try the script from v1.0 instead of master\nThanks for the notice on the broken link as well \ud83d\ude0a . @ELLIOTTCABLE Glad that worked for you! :smile: \nAlso I think the issue you were seeing is an actual issue though :blush: I will investigate some more and probably re-open and rename this issue.\n\nIf you can steel yourself against the horrible way I maim your repository, you might be interested in this:\nhttps://gist.github.com/ELLIOTTCABLE/5b87ab21b11acb76a5c52d47a022b519\n\nThat's awesome :+1: I would love to steal this for the wiki or somewhere or if you would want to give it a try you have my blessing to add it on the wiki. :smile: or maybe even a PR that can link to this (not in the readme itself because the readme is already very long and wordy :blush: ). @ELLIOTTCABLE Hey no worries :smile: Thanks for the follow up!\nWe will document it somewhere, hmm the best way to download an unpatched font and patch it you mean I am guessing?. @Taverius Sorry about that.\nWe tried to explain better in some of the markdown files, for example: AnonymousPro\nCan I ask which closed issue you are referring to? :blush: \n\nyou need it for Mac/Win GVim to pick up the fonts\n\nHmm it shouldn't be required but lately with the GUI builds of Vim there is an ambiguous width issue (glyphs cut in half). What was the issue? The fonts weren't working at all unless you used the mono versions?\n\nexplain the mono option better\n\nI am all for this :smile:. Did you have any specific place where more info would have helped? The readme? The patcher (--help) ? Somewhere else?. @RuRo I agree readme would best.\n\nimages with wrong character codes\n\nDo you mean the \"Seti-UI + Custom\" set and \"Font Awesome Extension\" set? :blush: \n\nIf nobody does anything about this before the 27th, I can try to 'refactor' the Readme.md\n\nSure I am always open to PRs :smile: \nHonestly I haven't made much progress lately on getting the next release (v1.1) out the door.. but I don't think there is much left to do. Possibly this weekend but I'd hate to promise :blush: \n. @luisdavim Yes you are right.\nThis should now mostly be taken care of now with: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/commit/b5e827191482b1e0ddcc8cf3943341d6ce9ea531 and https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/wiki/FAQ-and-Troubleshooting#tldr. Yeah good point. Those are originally from https://github.com/powerline/fonts\nEither we should upgrade the unpatched fonts to remove the 'for Powerline'/'powerline' or filter that out in the patcher.\n. Considering this closed (with v1.1.0 release). @thyrlian Thanks for the contribution \ud83d\udc4d . @karambaq Thanks for the report.\nCan you tell which codepoint glyph you are using (where the box shows instead) ?. @karambaq Sorry for the delayed follow up.\nI'm not sure what you mean by 127? is that the codepoint?\nCould you give the unicode codepoint (hex) of the glyph that is not showing?\ne.g. the Powerline right pointing divider glyph (\ue0b0) is e0b0. @karambaq Do you still have this issues? Do @RuRo's steps help ?. @nomoon Thanks a lot for the contribution :medal_sports: :+1: \nSo I was actually replacing some of these and trying to modify what was included but for whatever reason I did not finish adding the necessary 'str()' instances and I was having issues with the font generating (it would generate but OS would not see it).\nI have tested your changes and verified no more errors and the font seems to generate properly (usable by the OS). Cool, thanks. Cool thanks. Thanks for the suggestion \ud83d\ude04 . @AnwarShah Hey, just wondering what is the reason you want to do this?\nOf course you are free to do what you want basically as long as you extract the license un-modified as well (to comply with the MIT license as far as I understand).\nFYI, a better place to contact me is either: Gitter Chat, e-mail me, or even Twitter. @AnwarShah Oh okay that makes sense. If you copy a majority of the scripts include the license and all should be good. You can do whatever you want with them.\nThe only thing I will say is if you make any improvements or fixes that can be generally applied I would appreciate it if you could submit those back upstream (via a PR) for benefit of Nerd Fonts community :smile: though you are not required to do so. :wink: . @xasx That is good news but Nerd Fonts uses vorillaz/devicons. @math0ne Thanks for the suggestion! So this would be another new glyph set. I can see your point regarding this having some good icons. @FlorianFranzen Yes thanks that would be easier and faster to add :smile: . @kballard Good catch! Thanks. Would you like to submit a Pull Request to fix?. @kballard Okay thanks :smile: I wasn't aware of this.\nIt would be nice to support this eventually provided we get some help :blush:, however I would say this is not a high priority. I have some renewed interest in supporting this :smile: . >  since you have renewed interest in supporting this\nOh I did say that didn't I? :laughing: \nI think we can try to target v2.1.0 (i.e. next release) unless I am missing it looked somewhat straight forward to implement.. Thanks.\nYeah this does seem to be an issue. I believe we can fix it without much effort.\nRelated: #140 . @andyfitz Thanks for the font suggestion.\nAs for supporting you can look here: Steps for adding a new font or removing an existing font (wiki)\n. @tamirco2003 Oh no sorry about that. What was the trouble you ran into?\n\nHow do you test patch the font?\n\nYou can either open up the font in FontForge or your OS character map program and visually inspect the glyphs at the various codepoints... or you can run test-fonts script from a terminal.\nSorry if that is too little too late. :disappointed: . @kballard Thanks I'll take a look at and test it this weekend.\n\nAssuming there are pre-patched mono fonts, they'll need to be regenerated.\n\nYep, so I will probably tie this to release 1.1 (because rebuilding all the fonts takes a good chunk of time), but at the very least perhaps we can get the logic fix merged into the code. @aidanharris Thanks for this \ud83d\udc4d . We'll make sure to upgrade before the next release and repatching . @aidanharris I wasn't able to replicate this issue but moving forward with the update of Fira Code :smile: . @aidanharris Hey did you close this because #181 was merged or because it isn't an issue or another reason? Thanks. @jerome-diver Thanks for the report \ud83d\ude04 . Yes I will check this out. @jerome-diver Good catch, you are correct it is missing. I fill add it to the release.\nJust FYI it is missing from the patcher and from the glyph set. @kballard Thanks for the report :smile: and details. I will try to take a look (but I can't say how soon that'll be). Seems we can solve this with removePosSub. I will play around with this this weekend \ud83d\ude04 . @kballard Seems we can deal with this but it affects multiple fonts with different possible ligatures.\nCan you try this WIP font out (seems to be working for me!): \nMeslo LG M Regular Nerd Font Complete Mono.ttf.zip\n. Thanks for this! :smile: I'll merge it in for v1.1.0 Release. @brennanfee Thanks! Appreciate that :smile:. Addressed via PR #215. Yep it will be fixed in v1.1.0\nShould be released this weekend, at least I will push up the fonts and you'll be able to try it out.\nThanks. Fonts have been uploaded. Feel free to test them out. :smile: \nClosing this for now. You're right the release hasn't been built yet. Will be either today or tomorrow.\nI don't think that warning is something to worry about but I will look into it more. Thanks . Thanks @Liquidmantis \nAlso SZ would be 'slashed zero'\nPerhaps we could add a blurb on the wiki to cover these and could consider this issue closed :smile: . This is now in the wiki: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/wiki/FAQ-and-Troubleshooting#what-do-these-acronym-variations-in-the-font-name-mean-lg-l-m-s-dz-sz\nclosing for now :smile: \nThanks all. @andybearman Thanks for this. Good catch. Looks good to me merging this :+1: . Thanks @theGivingTree for your fix and contribution :smile:\nThanks @reujab for merging :+1: . @Twanislas Thank you. Appreciate it!\nI'm away for sometime but it'll get merged when I'm back or if someone else reviews they can merge it \ud83d\ude04 . Sorry for the delay. I am still planning to review and merge. I won't promise when though :disappointed: . LGTM :+1: . Thanks for the report\n\nOutput of your test-powerlines.sh script: (sorry for the white lines.. no idea why I have this)\n\nNo need to apologize! That is actually from me and on purpose. I was trying to make it easier to identify any vertical overhangs on the powerline glyphs :smile: \n\nDo I need to create some fontconfig or other stuff?\n\nYou don't need to create a fontconfig and shouldn't need to do anything other than install the font and set the terminal to use said font.\nAre you sure the terminal is pointing to the Nerd Font variation of inconsolata (i.e. Inconsolata Nerd Font Complete) and not just the 'vanilla' Inconsolata ?\nHave you tried in any other terminals? Can you try running and capture the output of the test-fonts.sh script. @shibumi Great! Thanks for the update!\n\nBut I still have issues with the size of some icons. They are too small.\n\nYou may be interested in issue #127. @duytrung Thanks for the report!\nI really must apologize because I am aware that 3270 has a name issue on Windows.\nFor more information see my comment here: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/issues/12#issuecomment-282446635\nThis is why it is showed as unknown/unsupported/untested status in the table: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#patched-fonts\n\n@duytrung Were you able to install any other of the fonts on Windows?. Almost positive related to #12 (Windows not liking the 3270 font name). Source of issue: https://github.com/rbanffy/3270font/issues/1\nI am going to grab the latest 3270 font and repatch.. that should take care of this issue. This should now be fixed. Tested on Windows 7 but I was able to replicate the same issue that you gave before.. @iloginow\nThanks for the contribution. Yeah I can see with your changes it looks better :smile: \nHowever the change was applied ad-hoc to only the patched font?\nThere will be a problem when we re-patch the fonts the change/tweak will get blown away :cry: \nIs it only the left divider arrow powerline glyph with the gap not the right divider arrow one?\nI am actually okay with merging this for now but I see it as more of a temporary fix and I don't think this is the root fix. I think we still probably need to do some tweaking of the positioning in the patcher script to solve the minor gap issues that seem to be lingering.\nThoughts?. @iloginow Hey sorry for the late reply.\n\nmaybe we just have to fix the source glyph itself in src/glyphs/PowerlineSymbols.otf... What do you think?\n\nYes I am good with that, how much manual tweaking of the powerline glyph did you have to do in the InconsolataGo fonts? If it was very minor could you make the same in the PowerlineSymbols.otf? That way whenever we repatch your tweaks are not lost :smile: After that I can review, test a few other fonts, and if everything seems good I will merge your change in.\n\nI see you also added InconsolataLGC. Can you do that in a separate PR?\nIs it from: https://github.com/MihailJP/Inconsolata-LGC ?\nWe typically add the unpatched version the font as well in https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/src/unpatched-fonts and update the readme counts. So missing a few steps from the Wiki: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/master/contributing.md#steps-for-adding-a-new-font-or-removing-an-existing-font\n. @cemsbr Hey thanks for the issue.\nSo basically you are suggesting to use the version without ligatures by default?\nIf you have a screenshot that would be nice to have.. I think this one should do it: https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka/releases/download/v1.14.0/02-iosevka-term-1.14.0.zip\nI will look into it tomorrow or this weekend. \ud83e\udd1e . @bbrks Thanks for the PR :smile: . Looks like you got everything. I will do some sanity checking and likely merge it in within a day or so.. @bbrks Merged. Thanks again!. @jerezereh That was quick. Sure thanks. \ud83d\udc4d . Fixed with #201. Thanks again. Love this :heart_eyes: . I'll get to merging this week. Hey @Magauran just wanted to say thanks! This looks really good so far. :+1: \nLikely will be merged in soon (only issue is there are a lot of PRs piled up right now so I will have to navigate and reconcile changes). It's up! NerdFonts.com :heart: \nThanks again @lucasreed . I will have to update the contributors list once I finish merging contributions for v1.2.0 (there were a LOT of PRs). @iloginow \nHey thanks for the new PR. I am guessing it is due to my comment here https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/pull/197#issuecomment-335217207 ?\nThanks for testing more fonts and narrowing it down to the InconsolataGo itself. This is very helpful! Really appreciate it :smile: \nThat's strange, hopefully we can get to a solution.\nI have been a bit delayed lately but I will get your PR and others merged in somewhat soon.\nThanks for the patience. Hey @Ksbugbee! :smile: That was fast.\nIt's all yours, let me know if you need any help or have questions!. Hey @Ksbugbee my bad, but could you try with a different font? Perhaps Arimo ?\n@bbrks Already has a PR for GoMono (#199). @steoneill I do not think this still needs assigning (as @Ksbugbee has worked on it in PR #207)\n@steoneill If you would like, you can create a PR that tackles another font instead. There are quite a few other fonts you could add. The process is very similar for any additional fonts anyway :smile: \nYou can find a font as long as the licesnse allows or if you want here are some ideas of fonts that could be patched still: InputMono, NotoMono, NovaMono.. @luisspuerto Thanks for the detailed report :+1: \nSo does it look fine in the non-mono form?\nYou tried using @taohex's patched Monaco but when you try to patch as mono it looks as shown in your screenshot?\n. @luisspuerto This is just a shot in the dark but what if you try the --adjust-line-height flag?. @luisspuerto Ah okay darn. Thanks for the details and screenshots! :smile: \nHopefully we can figure out what's happening :worried: . @luisspuerto Hey no I haven't tried patching myself. Also sorry no progress on this issue. Mostly getting caught up with the backlog of PRs (now finally merged). Next up will be the v1.2.0 Release. @Tyilo Thanks! :smile:. @andrewimeson Thanks! This is great :smile: . I am gotten behind on PRs but I promise things will start moving forward shortly. :soon: :wink: . @andrewimeson Thanks again! :+1: . Sure thanks @djphan it's all yours.\nLet us know if you have any questions. . @djphan Still interested in this or can I safely take it over?. @hiby90hou Thanks! This looks great so far. :smile: Do you have plans to continue past the introduction?\nI can merge either way but wanted to know if your plan was to translate the remaining text or just the \"intro\"?. @hiby90hou Thanks, I really appreciate it :smile: \n\nI need some time.\n\nNo worries at all. Take your time, we will merge it when it is ready. Please don't feel like you are under pressure or a timeframe to complete it :smile: . We will merge it when you say you are done.. @hiby90hou I cannot read it but I love it :heart_eyes: \nVery much appreciate your work :+1: :smile: \nI will be merging soon... . @fernandomora Thank you very much for your contribution. It is appreciated :smile: :+1: . @aquatix Thanks for the update! Very cool.\nWhat I found most interesting was the move to MIT license: 'the reserved font name \u201cHack\u201d was eliminated from the license'.\nLooks like we can stop using 'Knack' and start using 'Hack' if we so desire.. @aquatix \n\nFascinating double post there.\n\nHahah yeah I did notice that too :man_shrugging: \n\nI updated to v1.2.0, but I don't think the newer Hack font is in there\n\n~~Hmm I will take a look this weekend. Do you mean it is not there as in the features of that release or the internal version is wrong?~~ \nErr sorry I was confused. I was thinking of Hasklig (Hasklug) that got updated for v1.2.0. Sorry but Hack was not updated in v1.2.0. Probably will be in v1.2.1 since it should be pretty quick to do so\nThere was a font (I don't remember which) where the internal version on some of the font weights was incorrect.\n\nThanks for this collection anyway, it's awesome :)\n\nThat really does mean a lot! Thanks! :smile: . Community is making it awesome :blush: . We can probably get Hack updated soon in master.. but the releases tend to go slow.. although a lot faster now with the new KISS workflow... \n\nFigured you don't hear 'thank you' enough, so here it is again: thanks for your work!\n\nThanks! :blush: . @duytrung Very cool! I will look into making this happen (won't be soon though). @Drewshg312 Thanks for the report! :smile: \nI won't be able to get to this anytime soon :cry: but I will try to look into it when I can. @Drewshg312 Sorry about that. PRs are highly valued and accepted at a high rate :wink: . @vedantc98 Hey thanks for the interest.\nFor starters I would get familiar with the project documentation available on the wiki \nAs for specifics on this issue I believe this script just might need to explicitly send the proper exit code when it completes. Possibly helpful: http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/exit-status.html\nTry to follow shellcheck suggestions. Thanks @Phuurl . @vedantc98 looks like this has been handled, hopefully you didn't start on anything or did you?. If anyone (@Drewshg312, etc) could/would verify I think this should be fixed via @Phuurl PR\nGoing to leave this closed unless anyone has problems. Thanks all. Thanks for the report \ud83d\udc4d . I'll look into this, but no promises as to when.. 21b5 is not part of Nerd Fonts, most of the source fonts I look at don't have it. Even the Consolas I looked at doesn't include in the font. At least on my system that character is coming from Symbola.\nHowever we could add those to fonts that don't have particular symbols, using Symbola or similar.. @fornwall I haven't had a chance to look at this yet but thanks for reporting a possible issue :+1: . @ShakataGaNai Yes this is a very big idea! :+1:  I am aware of them but haven't done any movement on that front. :sweat_smile: . I think we can probably rule out FA Pro (I don't feel confident exploring that route -- unless someone can convince me otherwise).\nAs for FA 5 perhaps we can give an option with the patcher, something like either FA 5 or the Fork Awesome (this was brought up in #241). FA 4.7 fork that is arguably more open.\nI think we need to discuss pros/cons of each. I, myself, would need to read up on the direction of each project. Perhaps we need to choose one over the other, or at least one as the default. \nUsually we try not to care about a few duplicates between sets here and there.. however here I think it would be overkill to support both out of the box (in the released patched fonts).. @MindyTai Awesome! Thank you :+1: \nLooks good to me (as far as I can tell!) :wink: . @jrcharney First of all, thank you for bringing this up, it's something I haven't really thought much about so it is a valuable topic. So you mean adding a PowerShell script for the install? \nThere is no good reason we don't have one or couldn't :smile: \nSome reasons why we don't right currently: I don't really use Windows for development purposes, a contributor submitted a PR for the initial install script and it has been dramatically expanded on since then. Basically we try to be community driven, so if the demand is high enough for an install script that works with WIndows we would be all for it.\nOne thing I am not familiar on yet is the windows bash shell. Would we have to write and support an entire powershell install script similar to the bash one or can we just create a wrapper to call it? Because the one thing I noticed about the 2 scripts you referenced is that they are fairly short but the current install script in Nerd Fonts is fairly large. Even then wouldn't that just be compatible with Windows 10 only?\nThose are my thoughts :smile: . Chocolatey looks like a good bet. We'll take a look at this. Thanks for the report and the screenshots both of you. \ud83d\udc4d \nGlyphs can be notoriously finicky to align for prompt purposes.. Cool thanks for the suggestion \ud83d\ude04 . Wow 222 is a lot\nEdit: 228 icons. @karambaq Hey no worries! :smile: \nThere is currently no support for ligatures unless the unpatched font has them. Therefore none of the flags for the patcher have anything to do with ligatures. the \"-c\" is for a \"complete\" set of glyphs.\nThis would be a future improvement for sure but I don't think very easy.\nref: #57 . With that said I am going to close this as a duplicate of issue #57, please subscribe to that issue if you'd like to follow :smile: . @dkarter Cool and great suggestion! :+1: \n\nThank you for a great project!\n\nThanks! :smile: . We can repatch for sure but I don't think the ligatures work at all in the Nerd Fonts patched version. Re-patched and only did a quick spot check. Feel free to test them out or report issues here. Thanks. Thanks @pencilcheck I did see that.\n\nwhen the new version is going to be officially released?\n\nTBD. I am actually in my mind targeting end of this month, so there is some release momentum.\n\nI submitted a request in homebrew cask font but they said the latest official release is only 1.2.0\n\nRight, so I did repatch the Iosevka fonts but now I am holding off on repatching again because of other new additions I would like to get into a release (new glyphs mostly).\nI am sorry for the confusion and perhaps I shouldn't have closed the issue via my commit message.\nI have added a new label 'pending rebuild...' and better use of 'in progress...' so everyone can get a better idea of progress besides just open/closed issues. I'll apply these labels and re-open this issue now so it better reflects the status \ud83d\ude04 . @Phuurl That's awesome thanks! :+1: \nI am to be honest playing a bit of catch up here. I have a few questions, why checking 0 through 1? Doesn't fc-cache return zero on success?\nThis seems to solve an issue with exit code after clearing the cache but then I was noticed we should probably add something in the copy/link fonts block as well (at least as a future improvement).\n. Oh interesting, thanks. Oh no, thanks for the report! :+1: . Hey @atomi, just tried Hasklug ExtraLight Nerd Font Complete.otf and it looks to be working fine for me:\n\n. @atomi Hmm that's because the font names actually the same (not taking into account the weight).\nYou should be able to do something like this:\n\"editor.fontWeight\": \"100\". @atomi Ah okay now I gotcha, yeah you are correct it is not behaving as one would expect.\nSo there is an issue here.. the ttf family name isn't being updated \ud83d\ude1f \nIt is actually using the canonical font name, so as long as you don't have Hasklig installed this should actually use the Nerd Fonts patched version from what I can see:\n\"editor.fontFamily\": \"'Hasklig ExtraLight'\"\nSee below the issue:\n\nEdit: You're very welcome and thank you for the report!. Might have a fix for this. @atomi mind trying out a patched font if I upload it?. @atomi Appreciate it, don't feel obligated, no worries whenever you are able :smile: \nIt is here for you when you can/want to test it out:\nHasklug Nerd Font Complete (Correct String ID).ttf.zip\n. @atomi Great! Thanks for checking. Hmm that is strange. Should not be required at all.\nWhat was the issue you were having? Glyphs not showing?. Which glyphs were you not seeing? The powerline characters (e.g. e0b0) ?\n\nI don't think it makes sense to me why install these fonts would have any effect on completely different glyphs. Perhaps the font cache got cleared while or after installing the fonts?. @jamrizzi That is odd to me that the package would be needed simply to use fonts with private use glyphs but obviously it seems to have solved something for you so there is probably something going on.\nPerhaps it was some other dependency but I wouldn't know which it was.\nThis would take some exploring or attempt to replicate.\nHow did you setup your Ubuntu server? Any specific iso you started from? https://www.ubuntu.com/download/server ?. @jamrizzi Good to hear. Thanks!. @evaryont Thanks for the suggestion. At first I thought this was a font but it's actually a font glyph set.\nQuite a few of these we already have but definitely some unique ones here! Given that Nerd Fonts currently does not care about duplicate glyphs (it just aggregates the sets) I don't think that would prevent us from adding the whole set.. Yeah we can use the ttf font. This should be fairly straight forward to include. The thing that will take time is repatching all of the fonts \ud83d\ude09 \nLooks like the mfizz are mapped to f100 through f188. However that range conflicts with some other Nerd Font glyph set so we just have to offset the range. \ud83d\ude04 . @samuelramox Thanks for this and we appreciate it, however these names are quite intentionally due to licensing of those particular fonts.\nFor more information see: Why do some of the fonts names appear incorrect or appear to have typos?\nEither way I will suggest a change you can make where we would accept your Pull Request \ud83d\ude04 . Sure no problem this wasn't the first time there has been confusion and it won't be the last.\nIf you make the change I suggested for those fonts in the table we can merge this \ud83d\ude04 . @samuelramox Thanks. @b-b-x It looks as if the font generates correctly. Is the font usable?\nThose errors are basically warnings from FontForge and you will see those on many fonts, I have not been able to suppress them in the patcher yet.. Yeah all icons should work.\nThe ones from that cheatsheet should work, other glyph sets might be moved (see: conflicts).\nFor the proper codepoint you can see the Nerd Fonts cheatsheet\nFor terminal use, example:\nsh\necho $'\\ue62b'. @b-b-x I am going to close this for now, we can re-open if you are still having issues. @petobens Thanks for bring this to our attention :+1: \nGoing to try to get this into the next version.. possibly :smile: . Thanks for reporting :+1: , will check it out when I get time. @varunagrawal Yes that might be helpful info. Thanks!. @kaijajan Thanks for the report!\n\nI really like the work you provided to make terminals look way better. Thanks so much.\n\nAppreciate that, thank you.\n\nHmm those glyphs are actually not patched with Nerd Fonts, those depend on the individual fonts.. of course we could always add the equivalent if they are in fact missing...\nFor example:\n\n. @CarterLi Thanks for the heads up!\nI guess we need a system to know when fonts release new versions :blush: . Just happened to be on and actually we are almost at a point where upgrading them is trivial (knock on wood). :smile: \nI will be pushing the re-patched versions now.. Ah Font Awesome changes.. yeah ever since I saw version 5 I had some doubts how we will incorporate. \nSo this forked from FA 4.7.\nRight now they seem to have 32 icons added since 4.7\nRef: https://forkawesome.github.io/Fork-Awesome/whats-new/\nRelated: #221. @snown Good catch thanks! :smile: \nLooks like I was doing a find/replace and didn't realize it (ref: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/commit/7141881b71021fde2a631b7088b59694cdeff8ad). @UlisesTJ That would be great! Would love any additions. Pull Request is very welcomed.\nRelated for reference: #118 \nJust a heads up I think we are going to refactor the readme a lot at some point, to make it a lot less verbose. Nothing will be lost however the items that are too verbose will get moved to the wiki :smile: . @chenzhihuai1990 Hey sorry for the confusion on patching your own fonts. The instructions seem to be lacking in that area. I am going to update that at least.\n\nThis repos is too large.\n\nIdeally we would/should convert to an organization and have fonts in one repo and the tools in a separate repo.\n\nCan you tell me what files/folds or git command should I use?\n\nYou will need font-patcher and the src folder.. Thanks! Good catch. I was working on Hack fixes late and should've made sure it was clean. Knack should now be Hack.\nI will actually be rebuilding ALL the fonts due to a partial conflict between Weather and Octicons.\nI have removed all archives from 2.0.0 for now. Thanks. I need to look into it more. I'm assuming this is the non mono version? Does it happen with the unpatched version?. Thanks for the update. Can you try the mono version?\nI think the problem might be the source font itself but I'd need to test/replicate. @danbee This is great thanks!\n\nI sourced a bunch of replacement SVG's for this font because many of the originals were a little rough looking.\n\nWere they the elixir, gulp, and the go ones? Or quite a few more than that? Those are the ones I noticed right away. \n\nThere were also many glyphs that were made up of multiple overlapping/intersecting shapes so I spent some time reducing these down to a single path each\n\nWere these mostly the folder glyphs with the logo on top (I created these in FontForge by combining already existing ones :blush:)? Or do you remember which?\n\nI have been unable to rebuild the fonts on my Mac to check. I managed to run the script (./gotta-patch-em-all-font-patcher!.sh) but I don't get any font files in the patched-fonts directory. The script did not output any errors confused.\n\nHmm can you paste the output or screenshot? I am assuming you are passing 1 argument so that it limits to a specific font family?\n./gotta-patch-em-all-font-patcher\\!.sh Source\nYou can also specify a specific output directory to check, for example here is what I was doing just a few minutes ago to rebuild the 'symbol only' versions:\n./font-patcher -ext ttf -out ./src/glyphs/ --complete ./src/glyphs/Symbols\\ Template\\ 2048\\ em.ttf\n\nThe last three icons in the font didn't seem to be rendering. The icons are blank on the web interface when you search for custom. My original intention was to add the Elixir icon, but I found it was already there, just not working correctly. I believe it was broken due to the problems with the glyphs.\n\nHmmm they seem to be showing for me, can you give a screenshot here ? Thanks.\n. Hmm seems like you might be missing the bindings for the command line part. Either missing fontforge python module and/or the psMat one.\nOf relevance to you:\n\nFontForge implements two python modules \u2013 one great huge one called fontforge which provides access to as much of FontForge\u2019s functionality as I\u2019ve had time to write, and one tiny one called psMat which provides quick access to some useful transformations expressed as PostScript matrices.\n\nsource: http://fontforge.github.io/en-US/documentation/scripting/python/\nI think our error message here points to at least psMat missing. The error message should be updated...\nWe have installation instructions for Linux only at the moment: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/wiki/Contributor-Developer-Setup#linux\nSorry I am not sure what the exact equivalent on macOS would be here\n\nYou could try commenting out these lines: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/2.0.0/font-patcher#L15-L18 and see how far you get. My guess is that'll then error on the fontforge import. But at least we'd know for sure :smile: . @danbee I see. Let us know how it goes or if you need any help! :smile: \nBy the way I'd like to keep this guy/gal :wink:\n\nI have an eps file of it if you want, let me know if you want to check the paths\nfound in the latest seti UI icons that vscode uses and I think is easier to distinguish at smaller font sizes than the other go glyphs). @danbee Here is the eps file I used for that Go glyph, you can use as is or optimize the paths as you see fit. Or find one that is similar is also okay.\ngo_seti.eps.zip\n. @danbee Thanks. I'll try to check it out this weekend. :+1: \nI think this will be a quick merge but after that I'll have to repatch all of the fonts :laughing: . I might see what other items can be tackled before that step.\n. @danbee hey, no sorry I haven't yet. I really was planning to and it even crossed my mind last weekend. I won't make any promises at this point but I'll look at it soon. Maybe this week :smile: . @pgrimaud Awesome thanks! :heart_eyes: . @1ak31sha Thanks for the report! Good catch :+1: \nCreated it here: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/wiki/Screenshots. Really nice, thanks for this. :+1: \nI think I found an issue though... and it is to do with the license, looks like just removing the 'IBM' part isn't the reserved part.\nhttps://github.com/IBM/plex/blob/master/LICENSE.txt\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 IBM Corp. with Reserved Font Name \"Plex\"\n\n:disappointed: \nPerhaps we can think of a replacement for 'Plex'? It seems common to go with a word that sounds like it but I am open to suggestions. Another thing we could try is to open an issue in IBM Plex and ask if they'll drop the RFN part :laughing: . No worries! Just something I caught too only after looking at the license.\nYeah maybe \"Blex\" would work? Yeah dropping the IBM portion regardless makes sense.\n\nP.S. Apparently they also have a trademark on the work \"Plex\", on top of the RFN clause: I'm no expert on this matter, but probably dropping the RFN wouldn't be enough anyway.\n\nI didn't quite follow, we should still be able to use the font as long as we don't use the \"IBM\" nor \"Plex\" name (as it is protected by the RFN clause in the license). However with SIL OFL we can use and modify and redistribute the font as long as it is not sold.. @romen Thanks! sounds good so far :+1: \nGotcha, okay I understand now what you meant. Yeah probably best to just use a totally different name.\n\nJust pushed the renaming commit! Sorry for the delay!\n\nNo worries and thanks! I was just putting the awaiting feedback label for my own purposes, hopefully you didn't take it any other way.. @romen \n\nI did not look for a meaning in the label! I was just sorry that we were interacting quite rapidly a few days ago and then I completely went silent for a longer period of time!\n\nAh okay phew. Yeah we were but it's okay :smile: . I always feel bad too when I don't respond to messages after a while. I know some on here it's probably been over a year :worried: \n\nAnyway, please review my PR carefully ...\n\nSure will do. It looks like you did everything as expected at a glance but if I see anything I'll let you know. Also I am less careful about merging to master since it's basically bleeding edge / dev. Also this is a new font so there is not as much risk of impacting someone else.\nWere the instructions helpful? I assume you're talking about the wiki?\n\nI had some warnings about duplicated glyphs or glyphs having different numeric encoding then expected, but nothing seemed blocking.\n\nThat's probably just FontForge warnings. I get them on all of the fonts I patch. I'd actually like to suppress them.. > very clear step-by-step approach which made it easier to use it as a checklist!\nThat's great! I am glad it was helpful! Actually that was what I meant but I got confused (thought it was in the wiki).\n\nAnyway, just to add more visibility to the wiki for newcomers, you might consider adding a direct link to it also in the readme.md#contributing section as well as a mention at the top of contributing.md.\n\nSo I recently added some links to the top of the readme (including the Wiki). I will considering adding it to the other locations too! Thanks.\nI think the readme a lot of the information probably needs to be ported to other docs and/or the Wiki.\n\nI plan to merge this PR in when I can do a quick review.\nInteresting/funny note that I found this: https://github.com/sgolovine/PlexNerdfont a few weeks ago and I even starred it. I didn't connect the dots until a few days ago.\nRegardless we will move forward with this as the 'official' one, and I don't know if that patch is compliant with the copyright and RFN anyway\n. @timoxley Hey sorry not that I know of.\nThe ligatures are present in the source font pre-patching right?\nWhat is the name of the tables that get removed in the iteration?\nBy the way the font-patcher is setup with the ability to remove subtables (but not tables) via --removeligatures in conjunction with --configfile [json like config file]\nconfig example: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/master/src/unpatched-fonts/Meslo/config.json. @timoxley Thanks for the details :+1: , that is strange. I would like to take a look but I cannot tell you when that'll be :sweat:  . @ccztux Thanks I appreciate that you noticed this however it is not a typo but is done on purpose :wink: .\nSeveral of the fonts that are licensed under SIL OFL have a Reserved Font Name that we cannot use without breaching the license, these are to prevent that: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/2.0.0/font-patcher#L238-L252\nsee also: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/wiki/FAQ-and-Troubleshooting#why-do-some-of-the-fonts-names-appear-incorrect-or-appear-to-have-typos\n. @devster31 Thanks for the report! So strange. Saw your message on gitter.. Thanks for the report. Does sourcecodepro (unpatched) work just fine for you? I assume so... @snachx @pitkling Thanks for chiming in, I actually appreciate it.\n@omares Thanks to you as well for the report and the tip. No worries there is certainly a problem.\nAppreciate the patience overall :smile: . @rahuliyer95 First of all, great job on this :clap: \nI will have to take some time to review on Windows.\nAlso just so you know the plan is eventually to segment out this repo. I actually even created a Chocolatey repo here: https://github.com/NerdFonts/Chocolatey\nThat said I think for now I will merge this in but potentially soon after move the code there and give you contributor rights to the repo.\n. This is too much for me to review all of it so I am just planning on a doing a cursory check and I'll merge this weekend. Thanks again.\nI guess the next step is publishing... Hey just wanted to say this is not forgotten. Just have a lot going on right now. This will get merged in eventually. Thanks!!. Wow this really fell off my radar :disappointed: but I'm back now. :smiling_imp: . @raffclar Good catches :grinning: thanks :+1: . Thanks for the report! :+1: \nHeh of course they are conflicting :cry: \n. @matjam Thanks for the report.. but I am a bit confused what the issue is. \n\nunable to use any of the powerline glyphs\n\nCan you elaborate? Because I see you found and ran the test powerline test script :smiley: and they seem to display okay there.. @IsOverThere Thanks for the report :+1: I don't know when I will look into it though.. Thanks (especially for the details) :+1: \nDisclaimer: I cannot give any ETA, but this project will keep moving forward little by little! :smile: . @codinguncut Replied to your Gitter messages. Thanks for creating this issue.\nI think this is a very important and we need to make sure we comply! :+1: . @esn89 Thanks for the report! :smile: \n\nIs there anyway to pick just a handful, like 5 glyphs to include during patching WITH the --careful flag?\n\nNot at the moment but that'd be a nice to have feature!!. @sergei-dyshel I think I stumbled upon your issue in kitty actually. Thanks for opening an issue!\nI cannot give any ETA, but this project will keep moving forward little by little!. Hey thanks everyone this is definitely a big issue that I have been following along with quietly. I won't be able to contribute too much to this project for the next several months but if I get some time and there are quick wins or PRs I will do my best :smile: . Thanks all. Getting back up to speed on things. Thanks @brennanfee and @mg979 . Thanks for the report! It's appreciated!\nNot sure what happened there. @boolim Thanks for the details. I will follow up when I get a chance but that'll be a while to be honest. Thanks again @brennanfee . It'll be a while before I can make any meaningful contributions to be honest but when I get time I'll try to push this project forward bit by bit.. @thyeun Hey really sorry to hear that. I know this repo is really large.\nWhat is your method for downloading? You might be better off with an un-official AUR package or ad hoc Curl only download the fonts you want\n\npossible to make it resumeable? so that once the transfer closed up, it will be resume again\n\nI think this is beyond the scope of this project, however if you can show an example of how you are currently downloading the repo I would gladly like to update the docs for an examples of resuming a download :smiley: . @Rfvgyhn @thamma My thinking was to eventually do this: https://github.com/NerdFonts/patcher\n\nDoes font-patcher depend on only src/glyphs and optionally config.json?\n\nYes, that should be all that is required.\nRelated: #73. @maximbaz Appreciate your layout and description here.\nUnless I am misunderstanding the Nerd Font symbol font in the src is what you are looking for?\nIf so then that is cool but perhaps we aren't making it obvious :worried: , if not then I misunderstood :blush: \n\nI admire this project, having one font with all icons is simply perfect.\n\nThanks\n\nFirstly, the \"original\" fonts tend to use the same code points, and thus overlap \u2014 for example, both Font Awesome and Material Design Icons start with code f000, so it is impossible to install two fonts and use icons from both fonts in the same place.\n\nRight yep so many conflicts between glyph sets.\n. Thanks for this. Looks good to me.. Thanks for bringing this up, I am trying to get my arms back around Nerd Fonts :smiling_imp: . Appreciate this report and thanks for the details and digging deep!\nI use ShellCheck locally (and we use in the build) and have been fixing the warnings on the bash scripts but the install is clean, however there is definitely an issue regardless.. Great suggestion, thanks. Thanks! They are already awesome fonts we just patch 'em :blush: and aggregate a bunch of things but I know what you mean :smile: . Hey @deadloko this makes sense and seems to have little to no downsides as far as I understand. \nOnly thing I found was this: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/206350/what-is-the-difference-if-i-start-bash-with-bin-bash-or-usr-bin-env-bash and some mention on security but that seems very extreme and not a concern for this type of project.\nI am good with this and ideally we'd test it in those environments but unless there are any objects I'm going to merge to master (it's our dev for all intents and purposes). @haasosaurus Hey strong work and I really applaud the much needed refactor as the script was getting very monolithic.\nI will however say that @mrworkman has a good point. This is really hard to see the core change of the issue that this PR addresses (the monospace issue).\nI think you should create another PR for the refactor and update this one to just have the fix. If it is not too much trouble that's my recommendation before I test and merge. Again I appreciate the work and it is really strong. :+1: . @haasosaurus Thank you! Appreciate the work here.. Thanks for all the work and willingness to test things out.\nI will be back helping out in sometime, promise :sweat_smile: \n@daenney Yes that'd be great and I know there is a lot downstream. I'd like to do some testing myself, so I believe at this point I am a blocker for this. If things look good this can go to master soon and then a release soon after :+1: . @Twanislas I will be merging some PRs this weekend. Not sure if I'll get to this one (want to take my time to check it out.. I know it's highly desired). Sorry people, I really thought I'd have gotten to this one back then but I am more active again and going through the PRs!. Baby steps: I just pulled the repo\nI wanted to check out what @Elvyria mentioned, but saw no ill-effects to the characters mentioned when patching Google Inconsolata\n\n. :blush: That's funny. Thanks for the catch/report!. Thanks. There are several issues with ligatures at the moment, Nerd Fonts is not ligature safe at the moment. :disappointed: . I'll have to test this out... Ideally the mono fonts should work in Urxvt but you are proving there is an issue. Thanks. Just want to let you know again this is very appreciated and I am sorry I haven't been able to get to reviewing it yet, also this is probably going to get into the 2.2.0 release not the 2.1.0, thanks for understanding!. Whoops I didn't mean to close and comment, just comment :sweat_smile: . Thanks, we'll look into this for the next release. Thanks for the report. No initial thoughts come to my mind. Is this font straight from the repo or did you attempt to patch it yourself?\nI'd like to try it out myself... at some point. This is really a good idea. I'll merge soon, however we can apply this to all fonts and these readmes get partially generated through the script: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/d1d9a7eb23fc9f5efc00c89cdd58694547a0df39/bin/scripts/gotta-patch-em-all-font-patcher!.sh#L219-L224. Thanks for the report, sorry to hear about your troubles. I'd like to try out the font you attached but I cannot tell you when I'll have time to do it. . Hey @mrcush thanks for the issue\nAs for finding the location, probably the easiest way is to use the 'cheat sheet' on the website: search for powerline glyphs. @alexs-jfrog sorry for the late reply. Thanks for the report . @icp1994 thanks for the report. Powerline characters are notorious for aligning. Thanks @Mange . It'll take me a bit to get to this but I'll review it. No worries @Mange. I want to get things moving again. I should have some more time now but still won't be as much as before but at the very least I want to make sure PRs get in. Thanks @Mange will be looking at it soon!. @Mange \n\nI think you might want to clean this up somehow; maybe repeat the process yourself..? Alternatively, if I could get some instructions on how to properly just add the glyph to the TTF file without any additional changes I could repeat that process and replace the commits in this PR.\n\nYeah you are right there are a bunch of differences besides just the added space glyph. Not sure what happened.\nYou are correct there isn't any script currently that generates those symbol only ttf files. Actually I did document the symbol font generation process, it is here: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/wiki/Release-Workflow#ad-hoc-updating-of-the-glyph-only-fonts\nProbably not obvious... Something is up with those symbol ttf fonts (will look into it later)\nHowever I think actually what you want to do might be as simple as adding 0x0020 to the list of characters that get copied/patched into all the fonts and it would only do so if that font didn't have a space. See: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/d27ef232786e2438f9a9c8fa3e2f0e19f6c6e0d7/font-patcher#L403. Thanks for this by the way, I will get it reviewed as soon as I can find some time. Will review.... Thanks for the list!. @P1X3L0V4 Thanks for this! Spot checked and looks good to me. Merged.. I'll take a look this weekend. Thanks. Thanks @AlmightyScientist . Looks like I dropped the ball on this. So this is not exactly what it should be changed to (because of RFNs) but you are actually correct that it is wrong. It should be hurmit\nSee:\nhttps://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/Hermit\nhttps://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/master/font-patcher#L242-L243\nhttps://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/wiki/FAQ-and-Troubleshooting#why-do-some-of-the-fonts-names-appear-incorrect-or-appear-to-have-typos\n. Hah thanks @MartinDelille. I believe we need emojis . Thanks @kud. Have to look into this. Hey yeah you are right. Well I think the font-patcher probably needs to handle that the same way it is for the 'removeligatures' .\nThe 'gotta patch em all' script seems to only use it for logging out the combinations and assumes 'complete'. It does correctly look for a config.json file and use it if found but then the problem is in the font-patcher to look for that value as I said above.\nThanks!. Will review. > The new Meslo fonts seem to already have the liga table stripped, so I removed the config.json.\nGreat no problem, thanks.\nThank you for opening #307 (I was actually doing a bit of work on it weeks ago before pausing)\n. So this looked good to me too on initial scan but I think there is some confusion. That path seems to be referring to the folder on the GitHub repo (https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack/tree/master/config/fontconfig) and the second one is the one referring to the user folder .config.\nSo I believe it is correct as is (even if it is a bit confusing on initial look).. @rohitravirane Please explain your PR. It doesn't appear to do anything. @rohitravirane Invalid Pull Request. Closing. Re-open with explanation if I misunderstood anything. Thanks. Thanks @MindTooth!\nNot sure on why the failure. There are quite a few issues at the moment so perhaps it is related to one or more of them.. Could you try a true mono variant (one with a Mono suffix)?\nAlso URxvt I have had issues with ambiguous width charts. Refer to https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/wiki/Terminal-Emulators#urxvt. @sideeffffect Thank you and appreciate your change. I just read through #248 for context.\nSo this is the place that makes sense, however the readmes in the patched fonts are re-generated for each release so any changes to those files will be overwritten.\nYour doc/readme change actually needs to go here: /src/readme-per-directory-addendum.md properly get propogated to all the readmes (probably better anyway that just Fura Code)..\nI know that is not very clear and I am all for improving the documentation process that these readmes get generated.\nHere is a basic overview :smiley: :\n- release script executes the standarized-and-complete readmes script\n- the standardize-and-complete-readmes script appends the readme-per-directory-addendum.md. Thanks for the report @audioscavenger . Thanks for the report @reidterror \nI haven't run the install script in quiet some time. . Can you tell us how you ran the install script? Was it just ./install.sh ?. Thanks @leoz2007. Thanks @reaysawa this is useful info! Upon a cursory look into fontforge python I am not seeing info on the 'spacing'. Need to look more... Thanks @memeplex . On the radar... Thanks for the contribution @MindTooth :smile: . I will look it over.\n\nWere a bit scared as the documentation don't specify a approach for just updating a font.\n\nWould you mind elaborating? I want to make continuously make the docs better/easier.\nIf you executed ./gotta-patch-em-all-font-patcher\\!.sh XYZ where XYZ is the name of the font it would have re-patched just that particular font set.\nIt seems like you followed https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/master/contributing.md#steps-for-adding-a-new-font-or-removing-an-existing-font ? If so that should be good enough in most cases. I agree with you on a separate guide for UPDATING as well as script to execute the steps. Thanks. Thanks @mikeshatch I also noticed it is wrong in the actual script. Thanks for the report. Nope this is better than Gitter for something like this. Thanks for the report. Thanks for the request though! Interesting license: Creative Commons Attribution-No Derivative Works v3.00. This looks like an accident. Was it?\nThe patcher anchor link seems to work. Use $LINE_PREFIX ?. Use $LINE_PREFIX?. Use $LINE_PREFIX instead?. For these changes I suggest keeping the name but you could add an asterisk (like is done at the table header):\n+| [Fura Code Nerd Font*][p-fira-code]                | [Fira][f-fira-code]         | YES  | 1000    | ![w] ![m2] ![l]   |\nWhich would already be matched at the bottom of the table by:\n*RFN = Reserved Font Name\n. You can find out via FontForge or other font editor programs. Looks like it is 1000. Make the changes in the readme-per-directory-addendum.md instead :smiley: . ",
    "blueyed": "\nHave you tried any of the other fonts in gvim?\n\nI've been using the first one (Droid Sans, from the original repo) before, which works fine.\n. @ryanoasis \nThanks!  I'm looking forward to trying it.\nI've noticed that there is \"Mono\" now twice in the font names, e.g. \"Ubuntu Mono Plus Nerd File Types Mono\"; maybe instead of the second \"Mono\" it should be \"Single\" - resulting in \"Ubuntu Mono Plus Nerd File Types Single\"?!\n. FWIW: urxvt tends to throw away too wide glyphs.\n. @zeorin \nThanks! :)\nIt is currently not included in Arch's rxvt-unicode-patched however, because it caused crashes that I could not reproduce. I am glad it works for you! :)\nI have looked into some minor issues with my branch during the last days and learnt a lot about urxvt's internals on the way.\nI am experimenting with a hack that uses the font itself to get the width (instead of using the wcwidth system function, which is meant to return what the Unicode spec thinks).\nSince a lot of (all?) of the glyphs in this font are from the private space, where the width is defined as ambitious, this should work better and is probably the way to go with codepoints from the private space?!\nIt will use this method inside of rxvt-unicode itself, and the injects wcwidth through LD_PRELOAD to the terminal's child process, communicating through pipes then..\n(btw: with Unicode 9 emojis have a width of 2 now finally, but glibc is not yet updated for Unicode 9, and it does not affect the glyphs from this font)\nSee https://github.com/termux/wcwidth/issues/1, and the project itself for a C version that is Unicode 9 compatible.\nUnfortunately both Vim and Neovim do not use the system's wcwidth function, but their own version, so you cannot inject a new one using LD_PRELOAD directly.\nI think I should push my branch and not hijack this issue further.. ;)\nThe takeaway however is that urxvt is very strict in this regard.\n. Some more info at https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/issues/40.\n.

A similar issue: glyph-source-fonts/Powerline.otf does not only contain the powerline symbols..  I could not find a font that would only contain those glyphs, and it might be not that useful, since it might depend on the other characters / the height of the base font?!\nIt is the same for the extra font I guess (which has \"Create Powerline symbol only font for fontconfig\" as TODO left).\nbtw: I wonder if it would make sense to re-use existing codepoints for a specialized PowerlineSymbols font, e.g. from the geometric shapes block (http://shapecatcher.com/unicode/block/Geometric_Shapes)?!\nThis way it would look OKish without a powerline font already..\n. What about providing a PowerlineExtraSymbols font, which contains only the Powerline symbols (plus the extra ones)?\nCould that be used by itself, similar to Font Awesome, or is it necessary to be scaled in some way according to the base font?\n. (More or less) just for reference: urxvt/rxvt-unicode cannot load the symbol-only font, because it contains none of the chars that it uses to test the width (https://github.com/exg/rxvt-unicode/blob/0767fe71f667f5be4e8967ca6ea27e2b14c19daf/src/rxvtfont.C#L157-L161).\nAnd with kitty the missing space is problematic (like mentioned already), since it gets rendered as boxed 0020 (missing glyph).\n@ryanoasis \nPlease add a space to the source font.  I've done so manually using fontforge, but I am certainly not knowing what I am doing, so will not create a PR for this myself.. @Mange \nOpened the ttf with fontforge, then opened another one (one of the patcched fonts), and copied the space glyph from there.  Then saved it as a new .ttf.  It changed the name (removed spaces IIRC).  You can use fc-query \u2026.ttf to query it afterwards.. ",

IMHO it is better to have consistent code points across different variants of the patched fonts. That would make life easier for 3rd party projects that rely on your fonts. And even for yourself: You than have to provide a correct icon/code point-table for each variant.\n. I am unsure about this issue as well.\nEither every project maintains a version for every different font, or for every version. Both are not very good. But now as you say it, maybe relocating is worse. It is better to provide interoperability between the font (that users choose once) and different projects (that users switch more frequently).\nExample:\nIt is more likely for someone to use programs which require powerline-icons like a ZSH-theme, a VI-status bar and a tmux theme than to switch fonts. So the three different programs should rely on the \"standard\" code points for the powerline-icons than special settings the user must to for every program. \nMan, I am really indifferent about that.. :grin: \n. :+1: \n. Allright. Thanks @ryanoasis . The answer to the powerlevel9k question is quite simple: we do not support nerd fonts yet. But you can built your own set of glyphs based on nerd fonts, if you want.

And the segment separator (flame) actually expands the proper amount vertically. \nSome of these issues are unavoidable with monospaced icons. Although some of these icons can just be made bigger. The flame probably cannot be any bigger, since it is expanded the proper amount already for this font. But the home directory icon could easily be made 20-30% larger.\n.

I fully understand that it has to be like that with strictly-monospaced fonts and that it is the best way to offer terminals that only support monospaced fonts a way to incorporate the Nerd Fonts.. I also see a minimally small gap when using Droid Sans Mono, at 11. It apparently turns red (probably depending on the color scheme) when I select 12. And there's no gap at 13 (but that's way too huge).\nAt 17, using Fura, the gap is super visible:\n\nI am wondering whether this still has something to do with the fonts themselves. Maybe OS/Theme/Terminal/whatever dependent rendering issue?. Perhaps Devicons is also a good address for a request regarding programming languages?!. Good news: https://github.com/konpa/devicon/issues/30. They do not appear in the selection box, however, with any gconf editor one can set the font of the respective profile manually.\nI used dconf-editor and modified the value in the respective profile found beneath org/gnome/terminal/legacy/profiles:. @gargoyle I'd not generally recommend this. However, it is a way I found to make something work that should be actually working - that said, keep in mind that the bug is actually on NerdFonts side making it impossible for gnome-terminal to correctly detect it as being monospaced (or usable, whatever counts).. After trying the font-patcher myself, it turns out that the left-pointing triangles on the right side are not quite proper as with other fonts.\n\nLet me know what you think about the font.. ",
    "msva": "Depends on font.\nSay, in Pragmata (it is monospaced by itself, but it also have Mono varint without ligatures) it is anyway 1px gap appears for \"left-turned\" triangles on some (!) font sizes.\nAnd some icons is anyway small in both variants).\nAnd this is much more sad, because I'd like to use ~9pt size font in my terminal (having 271x75 Terminal on PragmataPro @ 9pt @ FullHD @ 96DPI), and >=13pt sizes on most fonts (including pragmata) are both too big and gives much less text space in terminal (especially, vertically). Although, bad side of this behaviour is that some devicons/awesome isons are too small to distinguish (either by design or because of patching/compilation issue) \ud83d\ude22 .. @ryanoasis and what do you think about:\n1) removing some duplicate glyphs (for example, it is multiple octocat faces, tuxes, win10 flags, ...), including multiple-sized (npm, octocat silhouette, drupal, CC, tablet and smartphone (that ones has microscopic clone-glyphs)). And maybe even give their place to, say, font-linux glyphs, to not move them so far\n2) maybe dropping some logo glyphs, that is impossible to read at terminal font sizes (9-11pt). Like that:  (it is also microscopic smartphone/tablet glyphs here).\n3) look how google guys did their Noto Color Emoji font, so it's glyphs can be rendered as colored even in terminals that don't support svgs (unlike Emoji One Colour font, which bundles SVGs in addition, so it is only firefox, who able to render them). And then add some colored versions in NerdSymbols too :)\n4) providing something like all_chars.txt with all the characters that font contain (for testing purposes and ease the way to get their codes (to not scroll entire list in fontforge)).\n// For example, I see in kfontview app that \"linux-font\" glyphs is somewhere \"at the end\", but I can't get their codes \ud83d\ude22 . Uhm... I did a simple script on Lua to test fonts... And I have few questions:\n\n1) Does that glyphs rendered under \"Seti UI\" font really what is intended to be rendered there?\n2) Take a look on glyphs between red [ and ]. Also take a look at the underlined glyph. As far as I see, first ones is rendered \"too low\". Is it any way to fix that? Or was that intended?\n3) Take a look on Powerline Extra Symbols. There is \"flame\" glyphs rendered pretty fine, but \"lego\" glyphs looks like cut at bottom. Aren't flame glyphs drawn a bit higher in source glyphs?. 0)\n\nGreat nice script <...> submit\n\nAs I said, it's in Lua. Not sure, people will want to install lua (even it is very small and has very small runtime memory footprint) to just test fonts :-D\nAnd also, I want to try to rewrite it to render a table, like you showed in another issue :)\nBut... If you're really sure Lua script will be acceptable, I'll definitely PR it when it'll be done.\n// I'd maybe try to rewrite it on bash, but there is not possible to use arrays of arrays, and doing that magic in other way is a few times harder :)\n1)\n\nSeti-UI\n\nActually, I talking mostly about that greek letters, but it looks like that thing is related to the font (they do exist in original font).\nAnd I'd very like to somehow force Nerd Symbols for some glyph ranges, but I can't find proper way for fontconfig to do that (I did very black magic there even without that condition).\nSo, if anybody knows how to force some font for some glyph ranges in fontconfig's xml, I'd be very happy if you'll share that knowledge.\n4)\n\nBy the way which font were you using in your screenshot?\n\nActually, it is PragmataPro (not even ... Mono one). Since it is monospaced anyway, I forced it (with fontconfig) to be used in terminal instead of it's Mono version (which has ligatures removed).. By the way, @ryanoasis, maybe you know how to remove glyphs by their codes from the multiple the fonts in a row (i.e. not opening FontForge gui, but script it in some way)?\n// although, it throws some warnings and errors on some fonts, and I afraid it will brake something after such changes :-/. Actually, it is not exactly KDE Bug. The problem is described in pre-last \ncomment there.\nBy the way, it looks like it was already fixed in KDE 17.04: https://\nbugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=371687#c9\nI just tested, and... vertical align looks like really fixed: http://\ni.imgur.com/JcBUl2c.png\nBut as you can notice, it is another issue appeared (it does not fit all the \ncharacters horizonatlly, and the ones that does not fit, somewhy got partially \nrendered on the scrollbar :D\n--\n\n@ryanoasis Thanks for checking!

If that is the case, would you kindly update the range to for the --octicons option so that all glyphs get embedded?\nThanks!\nP.S.\nNever used github before, so not sure whether I should close this issue myself or you will do it after you release an update.\n. Yes, having a simple name for an all-inclusive font is a good idea since it is indeed typically the most useful variant. I would suggest though a slightly shorter name (e.g. < font name> Nerd or NerdAll if you insist on indicating everything is packed), since I've already run into trouble in Windows with long font names (I know you have an option to force shorter names, but would like the default to be work).\nAnd then all other incomplete variations can be indicated though additional file name modifications (I'd suggest abbreviations as indicated above to keep the name short, but it's not critical since I'm only using the complete font type).\n. @ryanoasis I think this is an issue with FontForge not giving scripts access to font style names (https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/issues/1061) and relying on autogessing style. Hence you get very strange styles in your fonts such as NerdFontComplete instead of Regular.\nThe resulting PS Font Name ($fontname set to fontname + Suffix in your patcher) is identical for all different styles (e.g. SauceCodeProNerdFontComplete for both Regular and Medium instead of SauceCodeProNerdComplete-Regular and SauceCodeProNerdComplete-Medium) and Mac throws this error.\nAfter I've used your script to generate the required fonts the only perfect solution to the naming mess I've found was to use FontLab\n1. set a proper Family name (e.g. Sauce Code ProNerdC for the 'Complete' version) \u2014 this would be the same for all the generated fonts with a given variation of extra glyph sets\n2. Auto-generate everything with 3 buttons (Build Style Name, Build Names, and Build OpenType Names) to get clean names\n3. Propagate these changes by clicking 'Import Names' in Additional OpenType Names\n4. Generate a clean set of files like SauceCodeProNerdC-MediumItalic.ttf\nThen, you'd get the following clean names (based on Source Code Medium Italic)\nFamily Name: Sauce Code ProNerdC\nStyle Name: Medium Italic\nPS Font Name (the one that was conflicting on a Mac): SauceCodeProNerdC-MediumItalic (it gets automatically shortened to e.g. \"It\" if it's >~32 symbols)\nFull Name: Sauce Code ProNerdC Medium Italic\n(OT-Specific names) Mac Name: Sauce Code ProNerdC Medium Italic (though I'm not sure where these OT-specific names are relevant)\nNo more naming conflicts, no more \"NerdFontComplete\" in drop-down menus in apps!\nNow, this could also be accomplished in FontForge GUI, but would be much more cumbersome. When FontForge allows access by scripts to style names as well, this could all be automated in a script.\nI think it might be even possible as is if you can try to guess a style name from a file name or font properties and try to trick FontForge into reading a specially constructed full name (with a hyphen separating name from style) to write the correct style name, but I don't know how FontForge autoguess is working\n. Actually, was wrong about FontForge not allowing scripting access to all the names \u2014 that github ticket threw me off. The sfnt_names from FF scripting commands is a string that has all the SFNT fields (see Name IDs) and appendSFNTName command allows to change any of them with either a name ID listed in the link.\nSo it's possible to do everything inside a FontForge script without the help of any other application (and, more importantly, without having to do any manual adjustments).\n. Yeah, Source Code is unfortunately a mess in this regard (I also had to change all the font names for these fonts to be correctly reflected in e.g. ST3 \u2014\u00a0didn't understand why the same name would work on Mac, but fail to work on a Windows, then realized the font names are inconsistent).\nI think the reason why Source Code SubFamily here is Regular instead of ExtraLight is that there is a stupid old convention of limiting styles to 4 (regular, bold, italic, bold italic). So ExtraLight doesn't fit and has to be included in a separate family \"Source Code ExtraLight\" with Regular/Bold/Italic/BI substyles of its own.\nHowever, the OpenType names of this font are correct (because OT got rid of that 4-style limitation), so in your scripts you'd want to read OpenType names ('Preferred Styles' and 'Preferred Family') instead of just 'SubFamily' and 'Family'. And only if OpenType names aren't present, use the regular ones.\nThanks for the gist \u2014\u00a0I'm also trying to adjust exactly this so that I don't have to do any manual changes, so it's helpful to see what you've done. \nAnd just to reiterate \u2014\u00a0to me the default FontLab options I've described above are ideal, so I'd suggest you follow them in your scripts as well (overwriting the default Source Code mess, for example), but of course it's up to you.\n. I'd also suggest in the output to write OpenType names in addition to the regular ones, as they have a priority (e.g. Mac would display OpenType names over regular ones on conflict, think same is true for Windows, but haven't checked)\nA quick reference table from my script (names in comments are from FontLab)\nsourceFont.appendSFNTName('English (US)', 'Family', \"family\")                # 'Family Name', 'Menu Name'\nsourceFont.appendSFNTName('English (US)', 'SubFamily', \"SubFamStyle\")        # 'Style Name'\nsourceFont.appendSFNTName('English (US)', 'Fullname', \"fullname\")            # 'Full Name'\nsourceFont.appendSFNTName('English (US)', 'PostScriptName', \"PS Name\")       # 'PS Font Name'\nsourceFont.appendSFNTName('English (US)', 'Preferred Family', \"PrefFam\")     # (OT-specific) 'OT Family Name'\nsourceFont.appendSFNTName('English (US)', 'Preferred Styles', \"PrefSubFam\")  # (OT-specific) 'OT Style Name'\nsourceFont.appendSFNTName('English (US)', 'Compatible Full', \"CompatFull\")   # 'FOND name', (OT-specific) 'Mac Name'\nAnd just FYI similar reference re. default naming functions (FF) is FontForge app names\nfamilyname   # (FF) 'Family Name', overwrites 'Family' if not set via appendsfnt\nfullname     # (FF) 'Name For Humans', overwrites 'Full Name' if not set via appendsfnt\nfontname     # (FF) 'Fontname', overwrites 'PS Font Name' if not set via appendsfnt\"\nP.S. Just realized during testing that FontForge introduces another layer of useless quadruplication \u2014\u00a0the fullname, familyname, and fontname variables are actually NOT the same as any of the SFNT variables. These are unique names present in the PS Names menu within 'Font Info' \u2014\u00a0and these names aren't even visible in other apps (checked FontLab, FontCreator, though can see (FF) 'Family Name' in Mac Glyphs)\n. > old convention of limiting styles\nThat's what I got from that Adobe document\n\n\"16 Preferred Family; For historical reasons, font families have contained a maximum of four styles, but font designers may group more than four fonts to a single family. The Preferred Family allows font designers to include the preferred family grouping which contains more than four fonts. This ID is only present if it is different from ID 1.\"\n\n. \n\nhave not really gone through it in detail \n\nI'm basically arguing for three key principles: \n1. Putting full style (weight, width, and angle) in style name (e.g. Condensed Bold Italic) instead of only doing this for OpenType-specific names and following the useless tradition in regular names. This also means that no style information is contained in the 'Family Name' (no more Source Code Pro ExtraLight as a different family from Source Code Pro)\n2. Making OpenType-specific names and regular names identical\n3. Filling in all available naming fields so that you can control the consistency of names along that unnecessary complexity of legacy duplicates\nRe. https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/issues/58 \u2014\u00a0while thinking about shorter names, don't forget about the larger point of reducing ~36 combinations to 2 :)\n. I've customized your script for my own purposes to follow this logic (prioritizing 'Devicons' over 'SetiUI', moving 'SetiUI' right after 'Devicons') and only retaining 'FA' glyphs that don't conflict with 'Octicons' (haven't tested yet moving the displaced glyphs elsewhere).\nNow that I've thought of additional simplification (with only two fonts required) the patcher could have those two additional aggregate options for producing SourceFontNFA prioritizing 'FA' and SourceFontNO prioritizing 'Octicons'.\nIf you're interested in such a simplification, I'd be happy to do a PR with the script and help with fixing the names for couple of fonts that I use myself.\n. You're right, I do prefer 'Devicons' to take precedence. I was just assuming that this choice, once made, is constant and doesn't offer variations. Only in this sense there is no variation.\nBut technically you're correct, you could offer two variations instead of one \u2014 with Devicons as prio and SetiUI as prio.\nIn light of the fact that codepoints will be broken in vim-devicions anyway, I'd just suggest you respect the glyphs that actually make part of the project name :) and leave Devicons at default codepoints, shifting SetiUI and still having only one font as output.\nIf that were not feasible, then yes, two fonts would be a better alternative and that would increase the total complexity to four variations:\n1. Devicons + FA prio\n2. Devicons + Octicons prio\n3. SetiUI + FA prio\n4. SetiUI + Octicons prio\nP.S.\nBtw, I've noticed that your custom SetiUI glyphs are bigger than the default ones. How did you do that?\n. ",

Here's to being nice :beers:\n. @Qix- yep, it's a deal breaker for me too which is why I started looking into it. I'll admit I only used the script on Fira Code because that's the font I use. I'll take a look at Hack because it may not adhere to the \"standard\" I made an assumption on which expects a - in the un-patched font's original familyname property.\n. @ryanoasis let me know if this is something you've already addressed.\n. @Qix- are you sure you were on the right branch? I just quickly ran the font-patcher script by itself on Hack-Regular and it installed with the correct family and style name.\nI'll give the gotta-patch-em-all script a run to see if there's an issue in how it invokes the patcher script.\n. This is what I ended up with after installing the complete variant after running gotta-patch-em-all-font-patcher! on this branch:\n\nLet me know if you're using one of the subset patch variants or are still having this issue and I'd be happy to troubleshoot.\nIn the mean time, I zipped up my patched Hack output if you want to give it a shot: http://d.pr/f/4kQS\n. Ah, I've only ran it with the prefix option to target specific fonts:\n./gotta-patch-em-all-font-patcher! Hack\nClearly there's more work to be done here :F\n. There's a good chance it's just this PR as master doesn't utilize style at all from the regular expression output of the name so if there is no dash in the name it probably blows up. I need to add error handling and/or normalization.\n. Hrm, I'm on OS X as well. Hack generates way faster for me than Fira Code did. Although, when I was patching Fira Code I'm pretty sure the script got into an infinite loop somehow... eventually I ended up killing the process with ctrl-c but the patched output font files seemed complete and working.\nAre you experiencing something like that or does the standard output stop?\nFor the record I'm on:\n| Dependency | Version |\n| --- | --- |\n| OS X | 10.11.3 |\n| Python | 2.7.8 |\n| FontForge | 20150913 |\n. Yeah, whatever fontforge processes that were spawned most recently finish running and then finish generating the particular variant of fonts and then exit cleanly after killing the bash script. I think this is a bug and probably merits a separate issue.\nIt's also worth noting that the patch all script uses the fontforge -script version of executing the individual patch script so it uses whatever version of Python that ends up bundled with FontForge (in my case I must have been running the patch all script on OS X 10.11.3's builtin Python 2.7.10). I tested 2.7.8 and 2.7.11 from homebrew using both the individual patcher script and a modified patch all script and Hack still works fine for me :confused:.\nI'll open an issue when I have time and try and see if I can reproduce the infinite loop with FiraCode again and hopefully debug a bit.\n. @Qix- it should be in this comment at the bottom: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/pull/61#issuecomment-195838189. Let me know if it works for you.\n. @ryanoasis I did update the regular expression in my branch to make that part unnecessary.\n. Ah, yeah, I was confused about which line you were referencing (lazy response without checking the source). I simply moved the - out of the second group in the expression in my branch. I think you may have done more work on it in your branch?\nEither way, that line should be necessary on the 7.0 branch for things to work properly @poliquin\n. @ryanoasis yeah I think this is indeed \"good enough\". If you've incorporated line 122 into your 7.0 branch then this can probably be closed unless you want to merge it for the time being.\n. @Qix- fo the record I did send him some Scotch so let's all just hope real hard on the iTerm thing :F\n. Looks like I got the directory structure all wrong, I'll fix it as soon as a I have a chance.\n. I can also handle the rebuild after #48 goes in, just let me know.\n. I definitely have had my eye on that as well. They don't seem too particular over there as there are quite a few Powerline patched fonts in master already but I figured it would be worth waiting until 0.7.0 until we start making PRs to Homebrew Fonts.\n. I'm happy to help test this on a Mac although it sounds like getting it working on CI would be preferable.\n@vitorgalvao does it make sense for all of the names to include a nerd-font suffix or the like since there will most likely be conflicts for all them seeing as they are patched versions of existing fonts? The other solution would be to use the pseudonym for the patched font that is used in this repo (eg: source-code-pro \u27a1 sauce-code-pro) which once patched would theoretically be the canonical name according to the Caskroom-fonts README:\n\n- font-sauce-code-pro-nerd-font (original with suffix)\n- font-source-code-pro-nerd-font (post-patch name with suffix)\n- font-sauce-code-pro (post-patch name without suffix)\nAlso, there are multiple patch variants \u2013 I'm assuming you probably would prefer we don't contribute too much noise but only submitting the \"complete\" patch variant? Otherwise it would have to be something like:\n- font-[canonical name]-complete\n- font-[canonical name]-minimal\n... maybe ...\n- font-[canonical name]-plus-pomicons\n- font-[canonical name]-plus-octicons\n- font-[canonical name]-plus-font-awesome-plus-octicons\n... etc.\n/cc @ryanoasis \n.

No worries, yeah it's definitely both a plus and minus.

You can modify it to process multiple fonts at one go.  Enjoy!\n@ryanoasis Ryan let me know if there are any open type issues that need work.  Happy to pitch in to help fix these.  . What error are you getting?. @ryanoasis If you include the -t flag (which you do in the above command) a TTFA sfnt table is added to the font.  You can check for the presence of the table which does not otherwise exist in a font.\nWe built this tool that reports the TTFA Open Type table that ttfautohint produces when it applies the hints.  Would require a manual check that the hints are present though I can modify it to raise a standard error exit code when the table is not present if that is helpful.\nhttps://github.com/source-foundry/font-ttfa. :+1: . > I am wondering do we need to execute the Python scripts in the fixes folder post-patching ?\nThe fix-dsig.py script is not critical and likely unnecessary for the needs here.  It adds an empty DSIG table.  Very edge case issue for some software that I have never come across... \nThe fstype.py fix is relevant and probably warranted.  This sets the fstype field (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/os2#fstype) to \"Installable embedding\" defined as follows:\n\nFonts with this setting indicate that they may be embedded and permanently installed on the remote system by an application. The user of the remote system acquires the identical rights, obligations and licenses for that font as the original purchaser of the font, and is subject to the same end-user license agreement, copyright, design patent, and/or trademark as was the original purchaser.\n\n\n\nDo we still need fpfix.py or should we also use the Python scripts in the postbuild folder?\n\nDon't believe so.  Here is a SS of the post table from a build of the regular variant in current development source with our current build tooling:\n\nThat fix should not be necessary.\n\n\nThere were no changes to the Control Instructions Files since we lasted grabbed them\n\nWe updated the ttfautohint settings at the v3.000 release and, as I recall we did modify the CIF's at that release vs. the last v2.x build.  If you are based on < v3 you might need to update both.  If you are currently based on v3.x, you should be ok.  We tinkered with a few ttfautohint changes but reverted back to where we were because we had a bizarre variable height lowercase glyph issue that developed with several moving parts in the hints.  Still not completely clear what led to it.  We stuck with  ttfautohint version 1.7 with current settings and Control Instructions Files.  These settings have been heavily tested and are functioning as intended.  If you have the capacity to build derivatives of our upstream source on those pinned versions and settings, you shouldn't have problems.  If you have moved to ttfautohint v1.8.1, have a look at the renders before you push them.  There is something funky going on in that version with our shapes.  Werner is aware and intends to look into it.\nLet me know if there is anything else that I can do.  Happy to help!  The patches here are fantastic Ryan.\n. This script will build a local development copy of ttfautohint at v1.7 off of your system PATH if you want/need current ttfautohint on PATH:\nhttps://github.com/source-foundry/Hack/blob/master/tools/scripts/install/ttfautohint-build.sh\nYou can find the executable on the path $HOME/ttfautohint-build/local/bin/ttfautohint.. Mind pushing one of the post-patched font files so that I can have a look at it?  FontForge is likely remapping the glyph names when you patch.  Should be a simple solution once we know the glyph names.  Will just need to replace uniXXXX in CIF's with the proper post-patched name.\n. yep! switch all of those names to whatever FF is using and you should be gtg!\nlet me know where I can find the font.  will definitely have a look.  . can you give me a list of all glyphs that are raising exceptions? is it all of them in the CIF's?. Will have a look tonight.  Will let you know if I have any other thoughts.  I think swapping those names should do the trick.  . For italic CIF: \n\nuni0025 --> percent\n\nFor bold CIF:\n\nuni0025 --> percent\nuni002B --> plus\nuni0038 (do not change)\n\nFor bold italic CIF:\n\nuni002B --> plus\n\nHopefully, that will take care of it!  . Fantastic!! . BTW, here are a handful of other tools for font management that we've developed in case they happen to be useful for maintainer duties here:\n\nfont-v : font version string mods, supports git SHA1 commit writes for current HEAD commit at build time.  includes library with public functions/methods to support nearly anything you would want to do with version strings (writes to binaries)\nfont-name.py : font family name changes (writes to binaries)\nfont-line : vertical metrics reporting / line spacing adjustments (writes to binaries)\nhack-linux-installer : shell script example of how to automate pull + install fonts + update font caches on Linux. Our approach to support automated installs from repo releases for Linux users (though can be used with any public GET request accessible end point).\n\nHope they help!.

In gVim and mintty, only Monospace font is allowed.

I can only manually edit the isFixedPitch and regenerate the font you provided. This is very frustrating since I downloaded the \"Windows Compatible\" font...

Dump Iosevka and your symbol font (as .ttf, without Powerline symbols) into JSON using otfccdump. Add glyph name prefix if necessary.\n2. Write a program to merge them. Two main tables, cmap and glyf, should be merged. (I do not think that this symbol font has OpenType features. If so, these tables should also be merged.)\n3.

The current patching script simply drops the hints of the Nerd part. You can re-hint it using ttfautohint after the patched .ttf is created.\nThis script preserves all metadata from the original font, therefore it shares the compatibility of the original font.\nIn this script naming entries are not modified.

My suggested patching workflow is to use the script in my previous comment, which preserves all \u201cgood\u201d properties of Iosevka.

Ok, \nI've found a partial solution, if you use fontconfig fallback with a complete mono font it works.\nRight now in my .fonts I have the patched Shure Tech Mono and my terminal is configured to use Terminus.\nIf I need a glyph fontconfig takes it from Shure Tech Mono, the only downside is that the glyphs are a little smaller.\nTo use powerlever9k I made a fork available here:  https://github.com/lcorsini/powerlevel9k\nwhere I created a new option for POWERLEVEL9K_MODE named nerdfont-fontconfig\nso in .zshrc you need to put POWERLEVEL9K_MODE='nerdfont-fontconfig' to use the correct glyphs\n. > Just curious were you using the fonts from the 0.9.0 branch ? Because a lot of the size issues have been fixed.\nYes I'm using the 0.9.0 branch, today I'll try a different fallback font (I choose ShureTechMono), my impression is that fontconfig tries to match the dimension of the current font so maybe the one I'm using is smaller than my current font at 12pt.\nI'll try different ones and see what fits better\nEDIT \nOk using a different font is better, here is ShureTechMono as fallback:\n\nAnd here used Roboto\n\nwhich is better\n\nYeah I agree this would be awesome and I would like that library to be Nerd Fonts :blush: but the project has been mostly focused on patching and not creating a fontconfig. I would love to have a fontconfig available on Nerd Fonts but I just haven't gotten around to it.\n\nWell I think that a consolidated glyph library could help your project AND fontconfig.\nit's probably easier to patch a font using one source instead of multiple (so one nerdfont.otf instead of devicons+font-linux+fontawesome+pomodoro+octicons) and that file could be used for font fallback whitout much effort, also it could be cleaned up a little (there is some duplicate in your approach)\nIt's probably a bigger effort, but could repay in the longtime.\n\nTo use powerlever9k I made a fork available here: https://github.com/lcorsini/powerlevel9k\nlookin' good :+1:\n\nThanks, also speaking with vim-airline guys I was able to fix the last problem with vim (see here https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline/issues/1320) the correct column number font (or maxlinenr)\nif someone had the same problem as me\n. Thanks, \nMaybe if there is no particular licensing problem you could include this TTF in your distribution (I use Terminus a Lot, it's one of the best in readability, and this TTF works cross platform even on windows and osx)\n. Ok, in the meantime I moved away from that setup, it was on windows, the editor is vim, and probably this was under putty\nThe Terminus font is better without antialias and on 12pt that's why I was using it like that\n.

Sure, the script should \"just work\" if you have zsh.  Once you source it,test-fonts` should print everything.  I think automated testing would be hard.\nThe script at the end just builds the project and then opens up a new terminal-emulator (st for me), sources the startup up script for zsh and runs test-fonts.\n.

I have to set it to -2 for spacing on Knack to look right.\nIt's worth mentioning @blueyed's fork https://github.com/blueyed/rxvt-unicode/tree/display-wide-glyphs. I use it myself and it works quite well: I don't even use the Mono versions of nerd fonts.\nThe way I understand it, instead of using a glyph's spacing to determine it's rendering, urxvt uses each glyph's width to render it. If a glyph is very slightly too big it'll try to render it, but if it's too big it'll just show the rectangle instead. The forked version fixes it to use spacing instead of width. The maintainer of the original repo won't merge the patch.\nI had to build a new package on Debian, which is a mission if you're familiar with the process of doing it The Debian Way\u2122. I had to get a patch, which I did by cloning the original urxvt git repo, adding the fork as a remote, fetching it, and then getting the patch like this: git diff origin/master...blueyed/display-wide-glyphs > display-wide-glyphs.patch.\nSee this Superuser answer by @blueyed for more information and a link to an Arch AUR for a pre-patched version.\n. The invalid cache file warning isn't related to the font script per se, it can happen after installing any fonts with any method and then running fc-cache -fv.\nAlso, FYI you can install 3 fonts at once if you like, e.g.: ./install.sh AnonymousPro Inconsolata Monoid\n. @ryanoasis I considered downloading the files individually when I was updating install.sh. In fact, this is probably a better course of action than assuming someone is going to download the whole repo.\nThe reason I didn't is because there was a warning somewhere that we shouldn't count on the file paths, they may change. If the file paths are considered dependable (especially if we use some way to search the right release/branch), then I can modify install.sh to download files instead of copying them.. @haasosaurus That works for me.

I'm currently working on adding support for adding \"standard\" Unicode symbols from the Google Noto font as another option.  It's probably a good idea to use careful mode for this, which seemed to be broken.  See commit 7e1ff32 above.\n. @ryanoasis - I'm fairly happy with the code at this point.  Feel free to merge at your leisure and let me know if you have any questions or comments.  -Marcus\n. BTW, the open/close was caused by me accidentally hitting the \"close and comment\" button.  Not sure why those two buttons are so close together.  :)\n. @ryanoasis I made another slight tweak.  Using one common glyph to define a scaling factor caused many glyphs to be smaller than otherwise needed.  So, I now use a list of glyphs that need to be scaled using a common factor, and maximize the rest.\n. @ryanoasis \nOne other thing I noticed...  When not using 'exact' mode, any unicode gaps between the symbol font glpyhs are removed when copying the to the source font.  For example, if the symbol font had glyphs at 0xE001 and 0xE004, these two glphys would be inserted into the source font as: 0xX001 and 0xX002.  This means if the symbol font changes and a new glyph is inserted in between, the resulting source font will have different glyph values.  Unfortunately, fixing this will also change a few of glphy's unicode values in 0.9.0 if introduced...\nI did a patch last night when i was goofing around, but wasn't sure if this is expected behavior so I didn't push it to my branch.\n-Marcus\n. @ryanoasis Did you pull 96eafa9 and 7cd183b?  Those should maximize the glyph size, while still keeping the relative glyphs (i.e. arrows, etc) sized correctly.\n. Okay, 9770856 may be a fix for the gaps @santagada is seeing.  I haven't done a ton of testing, so I'm not sure if it may have other side effects.  Some fonts have these values, many do not.  The OS2 parameters are really inconsistently used.\n. Keep in mind that the aspect ratio of the powerline symbols is going to be\njacked for monospace versions.  They are being scaled to fit the line\nheight size, but the width will be limited to the monospace character width\n(which is much smaller than the line height).  Some fonts may be thinner\nthan others, which will exacerbate the problem.\nThe other symbols' aspect ratios are preserved, however this makes them\nquite small, especially if the symbol is inherently W I D E.\nOn Thu, Nov 10, 2016 at 4:36 PM, Ryan L McIntyre notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n@santagada https://github.com/santagada Thanks I appreciate it.

Arch (Manjaro): Linux 4.9.24-1.\nMost characters are so small, that they are pretty much not usable as glyphs and indicators. Some of the characters are as big as they should be. For example the powerline symbols are normal sized, while the various git logos are very small.\nCompare sizes:\necho \"\\nSmall :\\uf300\\uf460\\ue70a\\ue258\\nSo-so :\\uf000\\uf072\\nNormal:\\ue285\\uf245\\n\"\n\nFrom Character Map App:\n\nI don't think this is font dependent, or at least not just Knacks fault, because previously I had this same issue with Sauce Code Pro. I even think the same characters were small.. @ryanoasis I will try it, when I get home, however that doesn't make much sense to me. The characters, that are too small are even smaller than English letters as well as some other Mono-spaced characters. There is enough space in a character to increase the size of the icon. Or at least it looks like that to me.\nIf it works with non-mono font, that wouldn't really be a fix, since these fonts are mostly used for terminals and you can't use mono-spaced fonts in terminals. If increasing the size of icons is not possible in mono-spaced fonts, could you make 2 character wide variants for the small icons. I.e. the left part character + the right part? Thank you.. Well. I tried the regular size font. As expected, the characters are bigger, but it is completely broken in terminal. The git-in-a-circle character is still small btw, but whatever.\n\nIs there really no way to have the cake and eat it? Maybe something hacky, like splitting the smaller characters into 2 monospaced parts.\nOr maybe allow non-monospace characters, but have their width be a multiple of a single character, so then you could do something like this in terminal:\n<double width icon><zero width char> is the same length as\n<normal character><normal character> both in terms of visual size and char count\nEdit: I just realized, that I am probably reinventing the wheel with my 'suggestions'. Noticed that the non-monospaced variant is sometimes referenced as \"double width\" in the Readme. Facepalm. I will have to look more closely into that.\nP.S. Konsole and Yakuake don't seem to support double width characters. Can somebody reccomend a drop down terminal that does?. Hm-hmmm. I tried the double-width variant with Guake. The big characters work well, but now the powerline arrows are slightly misaligned the '<' arrows have a small space between them and the next block, while the '>' arrows are vertically a little smaller than the whole 'line'. Here's a screenshot:\n\nActually, maybe the git symbol is a bit too small. But it works unexpectedly good overall.\n\nP.S. What I find weird, is that the U+E0B4 and U+E0B6 work fine (they are the round powerline symbols), while U+E0B0 and U+E0B2 have the issues described above.. In my opinion, the correct place for such explanations is the README.md. There are on the other hand things in the README that shouldn't be there cough images with wrong character codes cough.\nIf nobody does anything about this before the 27th, I can try to 'refactor' the Readme.md\nIn fact, I would put the only the bare minimum in the --help like command line arguments description and a static link to the README hosted on github for that particular version. After all, unless the user wants to install all the fonts or to patch them themselves for some reason, I think, most users would just download the already patched font, so there would be no --help message for them.. @karambaq I don't know, why I spent the last 10 minutes writing this, but here you go:\n1) Highlight the symbol in question.\n2) Copy it. You can google how to copy/paste text in your terminal, but it's generally \"highlight+middle mouse button\", \"Ctrl-Shift-C/V\" or \"Highligh+RightClick(Opens Menu)\".\n3) Enter echo -ne \"\\0\\0\\0here\\0\\0\" | hexdump -C, where here is where you paste your symbol.\n\u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b For example, echo -ne \"\\0\\0\\0\uf00c\\0\\0\" | hexdump -C.\n4) Post the output here.\n\u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b For example, 00 00 00 ef 80 8c 00 00\n5) Bonus. You can try to paste this symbol in various different terminals and text editors e.t.c. to see if this is your terminals fault.. Same problem on Manjaro Linux with the default Noto Sans font.\nMy workaround is to use fontforge to convert .ttc to .ttf before patching the font:\nfontforge -lang=pe -c \"Open(\\$1);Generate(\\$1:r+'.ttf')\" SomeFont-Regular.ttc. Agreed! In fact, on some systems the font management gui doesn't even allow to have both the Mono and Normal variations installed at the same time, because \"this font already exists\".. ",

Try gitter\n@ryanoasis I think we can just put these images in the repo like you suggested. They're small beans compared to the fonts themselves. I'll make a PR that does that and then fixes this issue.. urxvt historically has had problems with scalable fonts. I complained about it in 2008: http://lists.schmorp.de/pipermail/rxvt-unicode/2008q3/000659.html\nThe images aren't available at those links any more, but I still have them so I'll paste them here:\nrxvt-monospace-9.png\n\nxterm-monospace-9.png\n\nAt the time, the maintainer argued that urvxt was doing it right, even though everybody could see the behavior is different from the other terminal emulators. So urxvt added the letterSpace resource for users to tune individually. However as you can see, that can cause other problems.\nIMHO there is no way to solve this in Nerd Fonts, rather there are three options:\n\nstop using the custom letterSpace resource, OR\nswitch to a terminal that doesn't suffer bugs rendering scalable fonts, OR\ntry to ignore urxvt's occasional little presents on your screen ;-). Do you mean the latest README.md from https://sourceforge.net/projects/dejavu/files/dejavu/2.37/ ?\n\nI haven't quite figured out how you're managing README's in the repo. Where would this go?. @ryanoasis I just added a commit with that change. Feel free to squash if/when you merge.. @ryanoasis hilarious, I hadn't even noticed font-patcher-py3\nWhy have two versions though? It's trivial to make one script compatible with both\u2014that's what this PR does. Can we just kill font-patcher-py3?. IMHO two scripts is just unnecessary complexity. Python 2.7 has been around since 2010 and there aren't any developer-facing Linux distributions that are still sporting 2.6.\nI maintain a few Python libs that are compatible with both Python 2 and 3. I wouldn't dream of maintaining separate versions\u2014that's just a lot of opportunity for unexpected divergence. I think a lot of the concern about forward/backward compat was resolved with Python 2.7 and 3.3 (when they brought back the u syntax for unicode to smooth backward compatibility with 2.x)\nBut those are just my opinions, and remember I created this PR because I didn't see the py3 version. I still hold these opinions, but don't need to force them on you. \ud83d\ude01 . and I had to laugh at \"I might be overthinking this\" \ud83d\ude06 . By the way, the Python 2 version of font-patcher depends on argparse which was first introduced in 2.7 \ud83d\ude09 . @powerman Wow, that's impressive! The wcwidth-icons README definitely needs some screenshots though ;-). I had a similar problem with Deja Vu Sans Mono on gnome-terminal. It improved for me when I switched to the \"Mono\" variant. What happens if you patch with --mono?\n(I think @ryanoasis is also working on fixing these problems in the non-mono variants, but his work on that isn't finished yet.). @RiccardoMPesce Your shell syntax is incorrect.

Just a copy &paste, but that would allow us to patch the fonts right away. I cannot wait to fix how my terminal looks :). Thank you Ryan,\nthis WIP is aleady a huge improvement of the look of the fonts. \nIt looks like the Vertical and Horizontal centering is perfect for all glyphs, however the scaling still needs a few fixes: here is what I noticed till now, HTH you to continue with this great WIP:\n\nPowerline Extra Symbols\nVertical scale is OK\n\nHorizontal scale is WRONG. The x scale ratio should be the same as y, instead the glyphs are stretched/shortened to the single char width. That is OK for the mono (single width variant) but not OK for the regular variant\n\n\nSeti-UI\n\n\nThe scale factor is huge! Especially compared to the Devicons. (E.g. compare the dimensions of the python logo in the 2 sets and you will have a huge scale ratio difference.)\n\n\nDevicons\n\nThe scale factor is small Especially compared to the Seti-UI (E.g. compare the dimensions of the python logo in the 2 set and you will have a huge scale ratio difference.)\n\nWhile maximizing the scale to the full line height of the source font does make the glyphs as visible as possible, it may make them look wrong when used with a line background as in a prompt. \nThe glyphs that have the vertical dimension >= than the horizontal dimension will extend to the full line-height, hence they will leave no space for the background above and below (graphically quite unpleasant).\nThe full line height is the correct size for the Powerline Extra Symbols (that have to play with the background), but for any other glyphs the scale factor should be calculated with a small percentage less than the available line height. Maybe the calculation (of all but powerline Extra Symbols) should be done on the global collection of glyphs instead of group by group?\nA good test would be e.g. the python logo in the Seti-UI and Devicon, which should result in quite the same dimensions.\nThank you for the great improvements till now! \nPS: A dev branch is certainly welcome, and may help eventual contributions. ;). @matthew-groth: It doesn't look you patched the font using the new font-patcher. Did you re-patch the font?. It looks like you are patching an already patched font, missing a flag. You should patch the original not-yet-patched font, and use the -c flag..

Same error as you but I'm not on Mac or using Homebrew so not sure why it's not working. Any thoughts?. Okay I'm trying this on a straight Kubuntu machine and it is not working.... same error. . Okay I got this to work. I opened up the file and I saw that it was in python and that the thing that was throwing the error had to do with psMat. I don't know what that is but from what I can tell it has something to do with fontforge being installed in python 3 but not 2 on Ubuntu so in order to run the script I had to use my command like this:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29441053/importerror-psmat-is-not-a-built-in-module\nfontforge -script script.py {{name of font to be changed}}\nThis also required me to rename font-patcher to font-patcher.py\nThis fixed my issue as far as I can tell.

I was just sorry that we were interacting quite rapidly a few days ago and then I completely went silent for a longer period of time!\nAnyway, please review my PR carefully as I have no experience whatsoever on fonts, foundries, graphic design, etc. : I just tried to follow the instructions to patch a font that I wished had the awesome collection of glyphs of Nerd Fonts and figured it would have been best to contribute back to your project by making my \"monkey-at-the-keyboard\" efforts to anyone else.\nI think I followed all the instructions, and I had some warnings about duplicated glyphs or glyphs having different numeric encoding then expected, but nothing seemed blocking.. > Were the instructions helpful? I assume you're talking about the wiki?\nActually I did not notice the Wiki before, I just read the readme.md and the linked contributing.md.\nI really liked the last one, as it had a very clear step-by-step approach which made it easier to use it as a checklist!\nBut now that you mentioned it, I went through the wiki too and it looked very informative and helpful,  probably I would have reached it eventually if I were contributing anything that actually had to do with the glyphs.\nAnyway, just to add more visibility to the wiki for newcomers, you might consider adding a direct link to it also in the readme.md#contributing section as well as a mention at the top of contributing.md.\nI'm aware that the readme already has explicit mentions of the wiki, on top of other links to it that don't use the word wiki in the link text, but honestly some of them went lost on the amount of information available in the readme, and others did not seem relevant to what I was looking for..

Workaround = Goto Releases, Click Tags, Select 1.2, Download. \n(https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/tag/v1.2.0). Yes. Something has gone wrong with the build process for 2.0 and none of the fonts (None of the 6-8 that I have tried, anyway) have the correct \"spacing\" parameter, so they are not being recognised as monospaced fonts when they are installed.\nThe 1.2 ones all seem fine.. My gut feeling is that it would be @ryanoasis decision to close or not. \nHowever, you might want to re-name the title since it's not only an issue with gnome-terminal. The 2.0 versions will not show anywhere when you are searching for Monospaced fonts.\nTitle suggestion: \"Fonts from 2.0 release are not being correctly identified as Monospace\"\n. I'm not sure I would recommend that, @xasx. The developers of gnome-terminal have deliberately put measures in place to make sure only monospaced fonts are used. \nIf you use a gconf editor to \"get round\" that limitation, then you are opening yourself up to possible problems/issues which the developers have tried to avoid or would not expect to happen.. @mrcush Already mentioned above why that might not be a good idea. \nIf you mess with dconf-editor manually, you could get the application into states the developers didn't anticipate.. @mrcush / @gymgle, yes dconf-editor can be used for a work around and in this instance the risk is probably limited to character spacing issues.\nHowever, it shouldn't become habit to use such a tool without due consideration. Today it's just a font issue, tomorrow it could be something a bit more critical.\nAs an example, make a mental node of this little gem which seems to becoming an increasingly popular way to tell users to install some bit of software:-\nwget https://my.web.address/projectx/installer.sh | sudo bash\nYes, it's a one liner that any fool can copy and paste.

I'll update if I manage to see a pango view rendered correctly.. I got it to work. The problem was really embarrassing; I had no .local/share/fonts directory, so I just copied the TTF to a file named fonts. No wonder it wasn't found.\nHowever, the result doesn't look very good. It's almost like the space has zero width, or the symbol taking up the space. The symbol is also aligned in a weird way.\nNew result (Ignore the blue background, that's unrelated)\n\nPrevious result:\n\nI'll try to patch the space from some other source font until it looks good.. I've tried it with all the included fonts and also with a copy of DejaVu Sans Mono. I figure that the font-patcher rescales the space to take up no space.\nI tried defining a ScaleGlyph that tries to set the same scale on it, but I always get a DivisionByZero.\npython\nSPACE_SCALE_LIST  = { 'ScaleGlyph': 0x0020, 'GlyphsToScale': [ 0x0020 ] }\nI've also tried to hack in that font_scale should be 1 for spaces, but that doesn't fix the exception.\nIt's almost like if the space symbol in all the fonts have 0 width or something..
