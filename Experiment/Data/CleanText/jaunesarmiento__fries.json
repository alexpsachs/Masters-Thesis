    "jaunesarmiento": "Fixed on branch wip-1.0.0\n. Hi @Wolfr, yes I've already included this in the current WIP version. You can check it out by pulling the wip-1.0.1 branch then just view the examples bundled with it. :)\n. Yes I guess I'll do that then. Thanks!\nNotes: Implemented on version 1.0.1. Use <i class=\"icon-up-button\"></i> to render the up/back chevron.\n. Hi @Mtillmann, does gfx perform well on the mobile browser? The only problem with it is its dependency to jQuery which I'm trying to stay away from. \nI'll read gfx's source to check how they do their animations and maybe port it over to Fries.\nThanks!\n. I'm a bit confused here. You're saying that we should use CSS transitions when in fact the animations in Fries are all done via CSS. The only time I use JS with the animations is when I need to add/remove a class that does the animations.\n. Closing this for now due to lack of information.\n. Yes, this is part of the plan for Fries. I'm still thinking which CSS preprocessor to use. But I'm going to lean towards the more widely used preprocessor.\n. Okay, I've started working on the \"Holo Dark\" theme using SASS. This will be included in version 1.0.1 of Fries.\n. I'd love to hear what others think. Compass seems to be more popular, yes?\n. Already implemented on wip-1.0.1 branch.\n. You're welcome. :)\n. Hi @aymanfarhat, I think you are using the documentation version of action-bars.js. The debug variable was only added to the global scope (in docs.js) and checked in action-bars.js to force the checking of action overflows in the documentation demo.\nI suggest that you download the latest version of Fries (https://github.com/jaunesarmiento/fries/tree/1.0.0) and use the JS files in the /lib folder.\nI hope that answers your question. Cheers!\n. That's good to hear. Have fun coding! :)\n. Hi @aymanfarhat, the JavaScript library of Fries uses touch events that's why it doesn't work on your desktop browser. I'm still working on catching clicks and converting them to touch events.\nIn the meantime, kindly use a library that converts click events to touch events. Or a more hacky solution is to edit Fries' JavaScript files and replace touchstart or touchend to click.\nHope that helps!\n. Alright cheers! :)\n. Oh, right. I completely forgot about that. Yes, that's the least hacky way to do it.\n. You may add the data attribute data-ignore=\"true\" to your links so stack.js ignores them. :)\n. Really? That's odd. I'm pretty sure I only call preventDefault() after it has checked the data-ignore data attribute. I'll take a look at the code later today when I get the time.\n. Thanks @aymanfarhat!\n. Hi @OZZlE, I'm aware of the layout issues on Firefox. I didn't really optimize Fries on Firefox because Android devices don't ship with it. And it would be pointless to optimize on Firefox since Fries was meant to be used as a prototyping tool on Android and Android uses WebKit as its rendering engine. I'd suggest using Chrome or Safari when viewing the examples or testing your prototypes.\nAnd for point number 2: as stated above, this is a non-issue when testing on Chrome/Safari.\nI'm really sorry but I won't be optimizing for Firefox. You can however fork the repo and maybe do the optimization yourself.\nCheers!\n. Oops, forgot to replace that when I removed the wip-1.0.0 branch. Good eye @Wolfr. Cheers!\n. Done implementing radio buttons and on/off switches on wip-1.0.1 branch. Check it out. :)\n. Oops, I forgot to merge the branch with wip-1.0.1. I did a merge just now. Just pull the changes then check out /examples/new-contact.html to see the radio buttons.\n. The switches needs testing on an Android device. I still don't have one so I can't test these right now. Will only close this issue once these have been tested on an Android device.\n. Great! Thanks @Wolfr. :)\n. Just pull the latest wip-1.0.1 branch and check out /examples/new-contact.html for the markup. :)\n. The weird flash above the switch is probably caused by the :active state highlight. Just need to position it correctly.\nAs for the swiping of on/off switch, I haven't done that yet. Will need a js component for that.\nI think I'll have to change the markup a bit and the styles. Damn, I overlooked that one. It's really hard to see everything without a device lol.\n\nOff topic: the video was captured using Screencast app. You can download it from Google Play.\n. Here's the link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ms.screencastfree\nI'm just using the demo version.\n. Oh right, I forgot about that. Sorry. >.<\n. Cool, thanks @teusinkorg!\n. Dude, your jpHolo is smashing! :) Great job on it.\nI'm kinda confused with this:\n- Tablet: 48,76 px\nCan you elaborate that? Is that 48 and 76/100 pixels on landscaped tablet?\nAlso, this might be useful for us both: http://petrnohejl.github.io/Android-Cheatsheet-For-Graphic-Designers/#action-bar-height\n. Right, centimeter. :)\nIf you read the guidelines on that link real quick, you'll see that the heights on different orientation and devices matches the ones I posted here. I'll probably just stick to that. :)\nSame thing for me. I am a bit of a perfectionist as well. That is also why I hated other mobile UI frameworks cough KendoUI cough out there.\nCool, thanks! Will definitely check out how you did the navigation drawers and maybe port it over to Fries. :+1: \n. I believe index.html works fine on Firefox. It's just that Fries is not optimized for it thus having layout issues. \nAlso, I won't be accepting pull requests to version 1.0.0 from here on. Please checkout wip-1.0.1 branch and do your changes there.\n. Hi @MiguelBel, can you provide a test case where this happens? Maybe post the markup where the text overflows. Also please fix your commit message before doing a pull request. Cheers! :)\n. Ahh I see. This merits to be in version 1.0.0 then. Thanks @MiguelBel! :) Will include this in version 1.0.1 as well.\n. I'm not really sure how the logout icon for Android looks like. Mind posting a screenshot or a link to the icon? Also I found this: http://www.spiderflyapps.com/downloads/android-developer-icons-the-font/. Tell me if it has the logout icon so we can extend the current font icon with this one.\n. I'll have a look at it. Thanks bud!\n. Hi @jadjoubran, I noticed two things on your implementation of Toast notifications:\n- Toast notifications are always centered unless otherwise stated in the code via the Gravity and x and y offset, which your implementation is having a problem with. When you resize the browser, the position of the notification gets broken.\n- Almost every box UI element in Android has a border-radius of 2px. Yours has 3px which makes the Toast look a bit awkward.\nA few things you might want to consider:\n- Convert your codebase into a class so we can call it as var toast = new Toast();\n- Add options where one can set the content, position, and the duration of the Toast notification. \nNonetheless, great suggestion. I wasn't really thinking of adding Toast notifications since you can just use the PhoneGap plugin which is implemented natively.\n. - I'm pretty sure I saw a JavaScript library that centers just about anything. I'll post it here when I find it. I think this will be the optimal solution to this centering problem since you'll be using JS anyway.\n- Toasts can be positioned at the top of the screen if I remember correctly.\n- Oh, I wasn't aware that it can't be used if you're building through PhoneGap Build.\nThen I guess this can be added to the next release. :)\n. Looks great! :)\n. Yes, I'll be including this on version 1.0.1. :)\nThere are a few things I want changed before I include this as a component though:\n1. I'd like this to follow the CamelCase coding style in JavaScript. So Android_Toast should be converted to AndroidToast and methods like set_duration should be setDuration. I want this implemented to provide coding style consistency.\n2. In Fries, CSS classes and ids that have more than one word are separated by a dash -.\n3. And further testing on other devices. :)\n. Or the following:\n``` javascript\n// If we're using fries namespace, do:\n// var fries = window.fries || {};\n(function () {\n  var Toast = function (options) {\n    this.init(options);\n  }\nToast.prototype = {\n    _defaults: {\n      // default options here\n    },\n    init: function (options) {\n      // merge user options with defaults\n      // show the Toast\n      // then hide Toast after a while\n      this.destroy(); // then destroy it\n    },\n    destroy: function () {\n      // destroy Toast here\n    }\n  };\n// Then expose it in window or Fries namespace\n  window.Toast = Toast;\n  // or fries.Toast = Toast;\n}());\n```\n. Hi @captn3m0, are you referring to Android Dialogs (http://developer.android.com/design/building-blocks/dialogs.html)?\n. Yes I'm planning to add this along with modals. :) This will probably be included in the next next release (v1.0.2) of Fries. Cheers!\n. Closing this and referencing it to #48.\n. That's really great @aymanfarhat! +1 to this. I was planning to add this feature to tabs.js a while back.\nYes, I'd love to see what people are doing with Fries. I'll send you an email. Cheers!\n. Hi @aymanfarhat, I'm aware of this issue and has fixed it in the current wip version. The fix was adding event.preventDefault() to tabs.js. Please have a look at this commit: https://github.com/jaunesarmiento/fries/commit/03bf6a3de062618f0378288a307c1ecddbf01508\n. The issue was caused by tabs.js appending the #href to the address bar, causing stack.js to pop these first.\n. Won't event.stopPropagation() work? Maybe call it after calling event.preventDefault()?\n. That is really odd. I really can't work on it at the moment due to the lack of an Android phone. I will however be able to buy one within the week. You can try to find a solution to this if it's not too much to ask from you.\n. Great, thanks @aymanfarhat! :)\n. Oops, forgot to close this issue. This is already fixed in the wip-1.0.1 branch.\n. Actually, Fries fires a push event whenever you push a new page to the DOM. What you can do for now is to catch this event and attach your event handlers from there.\nI really like your second suggestion but I still don't see the need of jQuery style selector module. Let's discuss this further. :)\n. Not doing this anytime soon. Focusing on other features.\n. Hi @mohitjain, as of now there are no plans to add a pull-to-refresh functionality to fries as it can be done using other libraries. And implementing such feature requires a bit more time than the rest of the features. Maybe you can check out cubiq iScroll4 with pull to refresh (http://cubiq.org/iscroll-4) and restyle it in an Android-y way.\nAs for the refresh icon, yes I'll be adding more icons to the current ones cause I've noticed that it's incomplete.\n. Will consider this. :)\n. Alright then. Will include it in the next version. I'll be registering this to bower. Cheers!\n. You're welcome. :)\n. Registered to Bower. Do bower install fries to install.\n. Referencing this in issue #17 \n. Hi @aymanfarhat, as of now there is no such pattern to achieve this. You can however save these parameters in a global variable, catch the push event that stack.js fires, and then using the parameters from there. This may not be the best solution to this.\nI'm open to suggestions on how to implement this or if we even should implement it at all. I also think this could be a great addition to Fries since I'm not just aiming to make Fries a prototyping tool.\n. I believe this is related to #26.\n. Hi @joelstahre, I'm sorry for the late response. Either the browser of the phone you're using does not support CSS flexbox layout or we'd have to work on the CSS styles of the tab bar. Please give more details about your test environment like OS version, model of the phone, etc.\nCheers!\n. @aboudard Great thanks! :)\nAbout handling gestures, off-topic but yes. I'm planning to add that feature. Actually, @aymanfarhat (https://github.com/aymanfarhat) has already done a prototype of that. Although there are still some quirks that are needed to be done like the dragging behavior.\n. Wow. I'm guessing this is a rendering issue on Galaxy S4 but I'm not 100% sure. If anybody else can replicate this issue on their S4, then I guess it'll be safe to say that it's a rendering issue. I'll check if the Samsung changed something in the browser for S4 phones, maybe that'll clear a few things out.\nBecause I have been testing Fries on Google Nexus S which is a relatively old phone and I haven't encountered an issue such as this.\nThanks for reporting this. :)\n. After a dozen of searches regarding any change to the stock browser of Samsung Galaxy S4, I found out that it's using Chrome 18 as its stock browser based on this post. Whether this true or not, somebody has to test it.\nOn another note, I can try to mix the old and new syntax of flexbox layout for the tabs. The current implementation of this on Fries uses the old syntax display: box and display: -webkit-box. So I think adding in the new syntax might solve this but I really can't test it on an S4. Maybe someone else can test it. \n. On second thought, it may not be the flexbox layout that's the problem. Hmm..\n. I'm labeling this as a device-related issue on the Galaxy S4. I definitely want to understand more of this problem but sadly, I don't have an S4. I haven't had any issues with the layout before S4 came out.\n. Hi @gregavola, are you using a GS4? As I said in my previous comment, I don't have an S4 where I can test this issue on. But from the looks of it, the problem seemed to have occurred because of translate3d. But since other Android devices don't have any problems with rendering, the culprit must be the default browser that S4s use to render a webview.\n. Thanks for the note @andywhite37. \n. Hi @BR41N1, yes this is an issue and I'm still thinking of an elegant solution for it. I suggest testing your pages using Google Chrome with emulated touch events for now by following these steps:\n1. Open Developer Console\n2. Click the gear icon on the lower right corner\n3. Click Overrides\n4. Then check Emulate touch events\nI'll be closing this and will be opening an issue with more details about this.\nThanks!\n. Wow @jadjoubran, this is great! Also I think you'll be needing to add the touchmove events as well. :)\n. Sorry to hear that. I'm really working hard to get these issues off the list.\n. I'll be looking forward to it :)\n. I pushed a branch that solves this issue. Please check out https://github.com/jaunesarmiento/fries/tree/fix-for-issue33 for this.\nThe only problem that I encountered with this is that the default behaviour of labels do not work, which is an issue for form elements. Anybody want to try fixing this issue on that branch? :)\n. Workaround: Use fingerblast.js.\n. Hi @KyleMorgan49, I can't seem to find what the \"menu\" icon looks like on Android. Do you mind providing a screenshot of the icon?\nThe current iconset includes the following icons from the original repo: http://turbo87.github.io/Android-Action-Bar-Icon-Pack-Font/ Please note that the class names may differ from this list.\n. Also, I'm having issues regarding the licensing of the Android official icons and @turbo87 's Action Bar Icon Pack Font. I'm thinking of redoing the icon font myself and licensing it using MIT so Fries users don't need to attribute them to the original author.\nThe Android official icons are (I believe) licensed under Creative Commons 2.5. Which is annoying cause you have to attribute it to the Android Open Source Project.\nAny thoughts about this?\n. Oops, sorry. I misread your post. I didn't see the \"three horizontal lines\". Got it.\n. I meant redoing the font iconset from SVG and converting them into a font and release it under MIT. So Fries users can just attribute their works to the Android Open Source Project instead of having to put so many licensing stuff on their work. I'm not sure if that's possible though.\n. @Turbo87, yes I'm having the same issues as you are right now. I don't have the time (yet) to research on the matter but I'd be more than willing to be less restrictive on this matter as well. But as far as Fries is concerned, I think I already made the changes I need to do to both the website (documentation) and the README to properly attribute the icons to the Android Open Source Project and to you. If this however does not suffice your requirements for attribution, please by all means, tell me so I can make the changes.\n. Alright man, cool. :) Thanks for clarifying this. Cheers!\n. Couldn't find a more complete icon set. Closing this for now.\n. Hi there @aboudard, no I believe this is not \"normal\". What version of Fries are you using?\n. Alright. Can you try doing a console.log() inside the code where you try to catch the back button? I'm very willing to help you with your problem. :)\n. But will the app still exit if you press the back button on index.html?\nEdit: I currently don't have an Android phone right now that's why I'm asking. xD\n. Hmm. That's odd. Is there any particular reason why you're catching the back button functionality? Cause when I tested this, I never had to catch the back button and still it works fine.\nBy the way, the style on other pages does not load if stack.js fails to load properly in index.html.\n. Thanks @aymanfarhat. I couldn't test the problem.\n@aboudard you could also try to build and install https://github.com/jaunesarmiento/HelloFries on your device. That project was made using ./create <project_folder_path> <package_name> <project_name> command from the Cordova Android distribution.\n. Back button seems to be working fine on v2.0.0\n. Oops, sorry about that. Thanks @BR41N1! :)\n. It is here. :) It's on the gh-pages branch.\n. Needs testing on an Android device.\n. Hi @aymanfarhat, I've been thinking of the same workflow when I stumbled upon https://build.phonegap.com again recently. Although to have this kind of workflow, we'll have to move a lot of things around which may cause a little confusion for the existing user base.\n. Testing on the browser is fine for now.\n. Don't mind the large number of deletions. I accidentally committed the styles for a themed version of Fries. :)\n. Hi @shuaishuai, nope I won't be adding RequireJS to handle modularization in Fries. The framework is already too deep into the development of version 1.0.1. I can however reconsider this for the later versions of Fries.\n. @shuaishuai I'd rather use RequireJS. It's a much more elegant solution rather than having Fries components in the window variable.\n@Wolfr, I think the best approach would be to use BEM method which, correct me if I'm wrong, being used by those mentioned frameworks. Actually, I've been thinking about redoing Fries from scratch yet again due to these kinds of concerns. I honestly wasn't able to think this through in a long-term context. But I really love having these kinds of conversations. Fries is still young, I think, so a lot can still change.\n. Will add it to the next version. :)\n. Hi @florindumitru, yes Fries does not execute any scripts from the loaded page. You must add your scripts to index.html and listen for events there.\n. Here's a little something on how to do this, you must catch the push event that stack.js fires whenever a page gets pushed onto the screen.\nSo given that you have an inner page like this:\n<div id=\"page2\" class=\"page\">\n  <!-- some content here -->\n</div>\nYou just need to do the following in your index.html:\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nwindow.addEventListener('push', function () {\n  if (document.getElementById('page2')) {\n    console.log('We are on page 2');\n    // do what you want here\n  }\n});\n</script>\nThis may not be the best solution but I think this will work for now. @aymanfarhat and I have already had a few discussions on how to hook code when loading a new page. I think this is something that should really be included in Fries.\nAnd no, I actually haven't tested Fries on iOS. And I believe it won't work on Android 2.2 due to its stock browser being outdated.\n. Wrong pull request\n. I didn't notice this when I was testing on Samsung Galaxy S2. Can anybody else confirm this?\n. I'll be getting an Android phone next week. Will test this as soon as I get one. As of now, I really don't have anything to test it on.\n. Hi @jadjoubran, I've tested this on a Nexus 4. And I'm not experiencing the issue you're stating.\n. Seem to be working fine on mine. Closing this.\n. TODO: add an example of the dialog on index.html\n. I still haven't decided on which to use LOL. Now that you've mentioned it, I'll see which available mixins are viable. :)\n. Hi @teusinkorg. Yes I've been meaning to add this feature a while back. I already have a candidate library to port over to Fries. You may want to check Snap.js as it implements this fairly simple, it's widely used in Ratchet prototypes and the development is active. :)\n. Yes I know. :) What I meant is that the core functionality of the navigation drawer is implemented in Snap.js. I think you can expect this feature on the version 1.0.1.\nCheers!\n. Hi @grobmeier, sorry if it was a misleading for you. But Tobias didn't ask for attribution for his work. His repository (https://github.com/Turbo87/Android-Action-Bar-Icon-Pack-Font) does not even have a license.txt file or any licensing of some sort. He did mention that parts of his work contain modifications of the original Android icons. Thus the only attribution I need to make was to the Android Open Source Project.\nIf you asked Tobias directly for his permission to use the fonts then by all means please let me know.\n. @grobmeier yes I've read it. Until Tobias states how he should be attributed to the work, I won't make any changes to the attribution part of my README because I am still in compliance to it. Google only asks that I should add \"Portions of this page are modifications based on work created and shared by Google and used according to terms described in the Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution License.\" so yeah.\n. Was talking about Google's license. I didn't notice that they updated to CC 3.0.\nAnyway, I'll be updating the README and the website shortly.\nThanks!\n. Fixed.\n. Related to issue #31.\n. Hi @soomtong, thanks for the contribution. :) I was planning to add this but I forgot to do so.\n. I'll also update the docs with this. Thanks again!\n. Hi @xpose2000, I've been aware of the issue since I got a hold of a phone lately but I haven't got the chance to find a work around for it. \nI'll look into it tomorrow ;-) I'll try your suggestion as well. Cheers! \n. This issue is related to these:\n- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13219017/ghostclicks-in-mobile-apps\n- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13064418/mobile-fast-click-prevent-ghost-focus\n. Although it seems that this doesn't happen on version 2.0.0. Can anyone else test this? Here's a sample Phonegap app using Fries: https://github.com/jaunesarmiento/fries-phonegap\n. Hi @vishnu123. Unfortunately Fries has only been tested on devices that I got a hold of. And all of them are on Android 4.0 and above.\nSo yes, Fries only supports 4.0 and above (for now, I guess). I'm still thinking of bringing support to lower versions of Android but I doubt that everything will work though.\nAs for the changes required, since I don't have a device with Android 2+, I'm not sure how it can be tweaked to make it work. I'm really sorry about this.\n. Apparently, this issue is valid. I've received an email asking how this can be fixed. A discussion going on here seemed to have fixed this issue. Just need someone to try and test if it works.\n. Hi @hackersysCG, cool thanks! Yes, I'd love that. Will work on a fix for now based on the links posted above. I'll give you a nudge when it's done. :)\n. Hi @hackersysCG, can you confirm if http://filamentgroup.github.io/Overthrow/ scrolls on your mobile browser?\n. I think that might be a little hard to do as those Android versions' browsers only have partial support for the flexbox layout. And that should be discussed in a different thread. :)\n. I'll create a separate thread for those issues first.\n. Oops\n. Hi @hell03610, is there any reason you need the current url in your prototype? Because unless you do, I think this bug is harmless to your prototype but yes, this is considered a bug and I'll try to fix it. Thanks!\n. That's odd. I'll check the difference between master and wip branch again. Thanks for reporting Emma. \n. It appears that this happens on Ratchet as well. So I'm going to close this for now as it doesn't seem like a real problem to us.\n. Related to #26.\n. Will be fixed on next push. :) Thanks!\n. Wow @bernatfortet, I never thought of that. Thanks for this. This can be used to make testing easier as well.\n. Hi @EltonZhang13, what version of Fries are you using? Because I'm pretty sure that this was fixed on wip-1.0.1 branch.\n. Sure thing. The problem was that in the master branch, the action overflows aren't re-initialized when the push event is called. If you check action-bars.js in wip-1.0.1 branch, you'll see the following line:\njavascript\nwindow.addEventListener('push', checkActionOverflow, false);\nThat line handles the reinitialization of the action overflows when a page is pushed onto the history stack. :)\nHope that clears things up for you.\n. No problem bud. :) Glad to help.\n. Fixed\n. Hi @markusthoemmes, thanks for reminding me. I was planning to add this to the documentation but since the next version is not up for release yet, I didn't include it yet. Will add on the next version.\nCheers!\n. Included in version 2.0.0 docs.\n. Hi @jituiitm, on what platform are you testing? Desktop Chrome or on your mobile device? Would help if you'd post how you're doing the radios and toggles.\n. That's odd. Hmm. On what device and Android version are you testing the Phonegap app on? Can't do skype/hangout right now unfortunately. I'll check this on my end. Will keep you posted.\n. I can confirm that the on/off switches and radio buttons does not work on desktop. But I've tried them on https://github.com/jaunesarmiento/fries-phonegap and they work fine. Can you try running this example on your device? It's a Phonegap app btw.\n. Alright cool, thanks @jituiitm!\n. For tabs, the first step that should be done is to find out which syntax of the flexbox layout is supported in Android versions lower than 4.0, then we can try and fix that. @hackersysCG, if you can play around with the examples and change the flexbox layout syntax for the tabs component, that'd be awesome.\n. Related to #68. Thanks for bringing this up. Will work on this along with issue #68. I'm looking for a few ways to implement this. I'm thinking of adding a data-attribute to the .page that tells stack.js that the page is at root level and should clear the history when it's encountered. What do you think?\n. It's not yet a solution, @berthojoris. I'm just throwing in ideas on how to tackle this problem. Are you sure it's the device's back button and not the \"up\" button?\n. Hi @soomtong, I've been really busy lately. I can't even work on the issues. Will try to work on this when I get the time. Cheers!\n. Hi @chiragnarula, you might want to look at two things:\n1. First check if you have an onClick attribute in your <body> tag. You'll want to remove that.\n2. Then make sure you have data-ignore=\"true\" attribute in your links and buttons.\n. Are you sure about this? I just checked the examples and they work fine.\n. On second thought, let's do this in a develop branch.\n. Issue noted. :) Will fix this in the next updates.\n. Nope not yet. Still working on it. :)\nOn Nov 27, 2013 7:32 PM, \"vishnu123\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nIs this fixed in Fries v2.0.3?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/jaunesarmiento/fries/issues/80#issuecomment-29377710\n.\n.

I can't believe I missed that. Thanks! :)\n. Ah, thanks!\n. Let's put this on development branch first. I'll set develop as the default branch so we can merge these without affecting the latest stable release. Also, I'll be creating a branch for version 2.1 with a list of features. I'm planning to add both holo dark and light themes to that as well.\n. Closing this for now.\n. > Well, that's actually what tags are for, isn't it? Even though current master can be considered stable (and shouldn't be default for adding new commits (except for urgent fixes) anyway), I thought the lastest stable is 2.0.3? ;-)\n\nOh, right. Haha. Good to have someone who points out my mistakes. :)\n\n(BTW, I noticed that you link to the https://github.com/jaunesarmiento/fries/archive/master.zip in the readme file rather than to https://github.com/jaunesarmiento/fries/archive/2.0.3.zip (=latest stable). Is that on purpose?)\n\nYes, I noticed that. It's my fault. It's supposed to be pointed to 2.0.3. :P\n. > Would you merge my changes from PR #91 into the new develop branch? If so, I can send you a new PR now. In case you don't, note it contains some JS fixes too. You may still want to merge these changes, even though you don't want to merge themes atm.\nSend a PR to wip/v2.1.0. I'll merge it right away.\n. As mentioned in #90, I'm closing this for now.\n. I'm currently working on all of the fixes. All new features haven't been touched yet. :) As for ETA, two weeks from now would be nice. I'm pretty busy during the day but I can work on them when I'm at home.\n. Yeah, sure thing. :)\n. Ahh this is gonna be tough. Do you mind merging on your branch?\n. The conflicts I mean. With 54 files changed, I think the number of conflicts would be tough to merge.\n. Can you check if the dialogs and toast notifications work on the documentation and examples?\n. I think the latest fingerblast.js may have caused the dialogs and toasts to break.\n. I've just confirmed that the latest fingerblast.js and fixes done to example.js and documentation.js broke the dialogs and toast notifications. Can you have a look at this on your end?\n. Awesome! Thanks!\n. Yes, develop is pretty much useless right now. I think deleting that branch\nis fine.\nJust send your pull requests to wip/v2.1.0.\nOn Mar 13, 2014 4:55 AM, \"Stephan Schmitz\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nGlad that's solved.

Hi @eyecatchup, I forgot to make a note that I'm no longer maintaining the project. Primary reason is due to Material Design. Anyway, thanks for bringing this up.\n. Already contacted GitHub regarding the removal of the CNAME. Someone has already squatted over jaunesarmiento.me as well, so I can't remove it manually.\n\nAs for merging projects, I can't give the project up that easily just cause I'm not maintaining it anymore. And I'd like to keep it for historical purposes. I hope you understand. You can, however, work on a fork. I'd be more than happy to provide a link to your fork in the README.\n. @seanhussey nice catch there! Thanks!\n. Thanks @kkirsche!\n. Fixed on branch wip-1.0.0\n. Hi @Wolfr, yes I've already included this in the current WIP version. You can check it out by pulling the wip-1.0.1 branch then just view the examples bundled with it. :)\n. Yes I guess I'll do that then. Thanks!\nNotes: Implemented on version 1.0.1. Use <i class=\"icon-up-button\"></i> to render the up/back chevron.\n. Hi @Mtillmann, does gfx perform well on the mobile browser? The only problem with it is its dependency to jQuery which I'm trying to stay away from. \nI'll read gfx's source to check how they do their animations and maybe port it over to Fries.\nThanks!\n. I'm a bit confused here. You're saying that we should use CSS transitions when in fact the animations in Fries are all done via CSS. The only time I use JS with the animations is when I need to add/remove a class that does the animations.\n. Closing this for now due to lack of information.\n. Yes, this is part of the plan for Fries. I'm still thinking which CSS preprocessor to use. But I'm going to lean towards the more widely used preprocessor.\n. Okay, I've started working on the \"Holo Dark\" theme using SASS. This will be included in version 1.0.1 of Fries.\n. I'd love to hear what others think. Compass seems to be more popular, yes?\n. Already implemented on wip-1.0.1 branch.\n. You're welcome. :)\n. Hi @aymanfarhat, I think you are using the documentation version of action-bars.js. The debug variable was only added to the global scope (in docs.js) and checked in action-bars.js to force the checking of action overflows in the documentation demo.\nI suggest that you download the latest version of Fries (https://github.com/jaunesarmiento/fries/tree/1.0.0) and use the JS files in the /lib folder.\nI hope that answers your question. Cheers!\n. That's good to hear. Have fun coding! :)\n. Hi @aymanfarhat, the JavaScript library of Fries uses touch events that's why it doesn't work on your desktop browser. I'm still working on catching clicks and converting them to touch events.\nIn the meantime, kindly use a library that converts click events to touch events. Or a more hacky solution is to edit Fries' JavaScript files and replace touchstart or touchend to click.\nHope that helps!\n. Alright cheers! :)\n. Oh, right. I completely forgot about that. Yes, that's the least hacky way to do it.\n. You may add the data attribute data-ignore=\"true\" to your links so stack.js ignores them. :)\n. Really? That's odd. I'm pretty sure I only call preventDefault() after it has checked the data-ignore data attribute. I'll take a look at the code later today when I get the time.\n. Thanks @aymanfarhat!\n. Hi @OZZlE, I'm aware of the layout issues on Firefox. I didn't really optimize Fries on Firefox because Android devices don't ship with it. And it would be pointless to optimize on Firefox since Fries was meant to be used as a prototyping tool on Android and Android uses WebKit as its rendering engine. I'd suggest using Chrome or Safari when viewing the examples or testing your prototypes.\nAnd for point number 2: as stated above, this is a non-issue when testing on Chrome/Safari.\nI'm really sorry but I won't be optimizing for Firefox. You can however fork the repo and maybe do the optimization yourself.\nCheers!\n. Oops, forgot to replace that when I removed the wip-1.0.0 branch. Good eye @Wolfr. Cheers!\n. Done implementing radio buttons and on/off switches on wip-1.0.1 branch. Check it out. :)\n. Oops, I forgot to merge the branch with wip-1.0.1. I did a merge just now. Just pull the changes then check out /examples/new-contact.html to see the radio buttons.\n. The switches needs testing on an Android device. I still don't have one so I can't test these right now. Will only close this issue once these have been tested on an Android device.\n. Great! Thanks @Wolfr. :)\n. Just pull the latest wip-1.0.1 branch and check out /examples/new-contact.html for the markup. :)\n. The weird flash above the switch is probably caused by the :active state highlight. Just need to position it correctly.\nAs for the swiping of on/off switch, I haven't done that yet. Will need a js component for that.\nI think I'll have to change the markup a bit and the styles. Damn, I overlooked that one. It's really hard to see everything without a device lol.\n\nOff topic: the video was captured using Screencast app. You can download it from Google Play.\n. Here's the link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ms.screencastfree\nI'm just using the demo version.\n. Oh right, I forgot about that. Sorry. >.<\n. Cool, thanks @teusinkorg!\n. Dude, your jpHolo is smashing! :) Great job on it.\nI'm kinda confused with this:\n- Tablet: 48,76 px\nCan you elaborate that? Is that 48 and 76/100 pixels on landscaped tablet?\nAlso, this might be useful for us both: http://petrnohejl.github.io/Android-Cheatsheet-For-Graphic-Designers/#action-bar-height\n. Right, centimeter. :)\nIf you read the guidelines on that link real quick, you'll see that the heights on different orientation and devices matches the ones I posted here. I'll probably just stick to that. :)\nSame thing for me. I am a bit of a perfectionist as well. That is also why I hated other mobile UI frameworks cough KendoUI cough out there.\nCool, thanks! Will definitely check out how you did the navigation drawers and maybe port it over to Fries. :+1: \n. I believe index.html works fine on Firefox. It's just that Fries is not optimized for it thus having layout issues. \nAlso, I won't be accepting pull requests to version 1.0.0 from here on. Please checkout wip-1.0.1 branch and do your changes there.\n. Hi @MiguelBel, can you provide a test case where this happens? Maybe post the markup where the text overflows. Also please fix your commit message before doing a pull request. Cheers! :)\n. Ahh I see. This merits to be in version 1.0.0 then. Thanks @MiguelBel! :) Will include this in version 1.0.1 as well.\n. I'm not really sure how the logout icon for Android looks like. Mind posting a screenshot or a link to the icon? Also I found this: http://www.spiderflyapps.com/downloads/android-developer-icons-the-font/. Tell me if it has the logout icon so we can extend the current font icon with this one.\n. I'll have a look at it. Thanks bud!\n. Hi @jadjoubran, I noticed two things on your implementation of Toast notifications:\n- Toast notifications are always centered unless otherwise stated in the code via the Gravity and x and y offset, which your implementation is having a problem with. When you resize the browser, the position of the notification gets broken.\n- Almost every box UI element in Android has a border-radius of 2px. Yours has 3px which makes the Toast look a bit awkward.\nA few things you might want to consider:\n- Convert your codebase into a class so we can call it as var toast = new Toast();\n- Add options where one can set the content, position, and the duration of the Toast notification. \nNonetheless, great suggestion. I wasn't really thinking of adding Toast notifications since you can just use the PhoneGap plugin which is implemented natively.\n. - I'm pretty sure I saw a JavaScript library that centers just about anything. I'll post it here when I find it. I think this will be the optimal solution to this centering problem since you'll be using JS anyway.\n- Toasts can be positioned at the top of the screen if I remember correctly.\n- Oh, I wasn't aware that it can't be used if you're building through PhoneGap Build.\nThen I guess this can be added to the next release. :)\n. Looks great! :)\n. Yes, I'll be including this on version 1.0.1. :)\nThere are a few things I want changed before I include this as a component though:\n1. I'd like this to follow the CamelCase coding style in JavaScript. So Android_Toast should be converted to AndroidToast and methods like set_duration should be setDuration. I want this implemented to provide coding style consistency.\n2. In Fries, CSS classes and ids that have more than one word are separated by a dash -.\n3. And further testing on other devices. :)\n. Or the following:\n``` javascript\n// If we're using fries namespace, do:\n// var fries = window.fries || {};\n(function () {\n  var Toast = function (options) {\n    this.init(options);\n  }\nToast.prototype = {\n    _defaults: {\n      // default options here\n    },\n    init: function (options) {\n      // merge user options with defaults\n      // show the Toast\n      // then hide Toast after a while\n      this.destroy(); // then destroy it\n    },\n    destroy: function () {\n      // destroy Toast here\n    }\n  };\n// Then expose it in window or Fries namespace\n  window.Toast = Toast;\n  // or fries.Toast = Toast;\n}());\n```\n. Hi @captn3m0, are you referring to Android Dialogs (http://developer.android.com/design/building-blocks/dialogs.html)?\n. Yes I'm planning to add this along with modals. :) This will probably be included in the next next release (v1.0.2) of Fries. Cheers!\n. Closing this and referencing it to #48.\n. That's really great @aymanfarhat! +1 to this. I was planning to add this feature to tabs.js a while back.\nYes, I'd love to see what people are doing with Fries. I'll send you an email. Cheers!\n. Hi @aymanfarhat, I'm aware of this issue and has fixed it in the current wip version. The fix was adding event.preventDefault() to tabs.js. Please have a look at this commit: https://github.com/jaunesarmiento/fries/commit/03bf6a3de062618f0378288a307c1ecddbf01508\n. The issue was caused by tabs.js appending the #href to the address bar, causing stack.js to pop these first.\n. Won't event.stopPropagation() work? Maybe call it after calling event.preventDefault()?\n. That is really odd. I really can't work on it at the moment due to the lack of an Android phone. I will however be able to buy one within the week. You can try to find a solution to this if it's not too much to ask from you.\n. Great, thanks @aymanfarhat! :)\n. Oops, forgot to close this issue. This is already fixed in the wip-1.0.1 branch.\n. Actually, Fries fires a push event whenever you push a new page to the DOM. What you can do for now is to catch this event and attach your event handlers from there.\nI really like your second suggestion but I still don't see the need of jQuery style selector module. Let's discuss this further. :)\n. Not doing this anytime soon. Focusing on other features.\n. Hi @mohitjain, as of now there are no plans to add a pull-to-refresh functionality to fries as it can be done using other libraries. And implementing such feature requires a bit more time than the rest of the features. Maybe you can check out cubiq iScroll4 with pull to refresh (http://cubiq.org/iscroll-4) and restyle it in an Android-y way.\nAs for the refresh icon, yes I'll be adding more icons to the current ones cause I've noticed that it's incomplete.\n. Will consider this. :)\n. Alright then. Will include it in the next version. I'll be registering this to bower. Cheers!\n. You're welcome. :)\n. Registered to Bower. Do bower install fries to install.\n. Referencing this in issue #17 \n. Hi @aymanfarhat, as of now there is no such pattern to achieve this. You can however save these parameters in a global variable, catch the push event that stack.js fires, and then using the parameters from there. This may not be the best solution to this.\nI'm open to suggestions on how to implement this or if we even should implement it at all. I also think this could be a great addition to Fries since I'm not just aiming to make Fries a prototyping tool.\n. I believe this is related to #26.\n. Hi @joelstahre, I'm sorry for the late response. Either the browser of the phone you're using does not support CSS flexbox layout or we'd have to work on the CSS styles of the tab bar. Please give more details about your test environment like OS version, model of the phone, etc.\nCheers!\n. @aboudard Great thanks! :)\nAbout handling gestures, off-topic but yes. I'm planning to add that feature. Actually, @aymanfarhat (https://github.com/aymanfarhat) has already done a prototype of that. Although there are still some quirks that are needed to be done like the dragging behavior.\n. Wow. I'm guessing this is a rendering issue on Galaxy S4 but I'm not 100% sure. If anybody else can replicate this issue on their S4, then I guess it'll be safe to say that it's a rendering issue. I'll check if the Samsung changed something in the browser for S4 phones, maybe that'll clear a few things out.\nBecause I have been testing Fries on Google Nexus S which is a relatively old phone and I haven't encountered an issue such as this.\nThanks for reporting this. :)\n. After a dozen of searches regarding any change to the stock browser of Samsung Galaxy S4, I found out that it's using Chrome 18 as its stock browser based on this post. Whether this true or not, somebody has to test it.\nOn another note, I can try to mix the old and new syntax of flexbox layout for the tabs. The current implementation of this on Fries uses the old syntax display: box and display: -webkit-box. So I think adding in the new syntax might solve this but I really can't test it on an S4. Maybe someone else can test it. \n. On second thought, it may not be the flexbox layout that's the problem. Hmm..\n. I'm labeling this as a device-related issue on the Galaxy S4. I definitely want to understand more of this problem but sadly, I don't have an S4. I haven't had any issues with the layout before S4 came out.\n. Hi @gregavola, are you using a GS4? As I said in my previous comment, I don't have an S4 where I can test this issue on. But from the looks of it, the problem seemed to have occurred because of translate3d. But since other Android devices don't have any problems with rendering, the culprit must be the default browser that S4s use to render a webview.\n. Thanks for the note @andywhite37. \n. Hi @BR41N1, yes this is an issue and I'm still thinking of an elegant solution for it. I suggest testing your pages using Google Chrome with emulated touch events for now by following these steps:\n1. Open Developer Console\n2. Click the gear icon on the lower right corner\n3. Click Overrides\n4. Then check Emulate touch events\nI'll be closing this and will be opening an issue with more details about this.\nThanks!\n. Wow @jadjoubran, this is great! Also I think you'll be needing to add the touchmove events as well. :)\n. Sorry to hear that. I'm really working hard to get these issues off the list.\n. I'll be looking forward to it :)\n. I pushed a branch that solves this issue. Please check out https://github.com/jaunesarmiento/fries/tree/fix-for-issue33 for this.\nThe only problem that I encountered with this is that the default behaviour of labels do not work, which is an issue for form elements. Anybody want to try fixing this issue on that branch? :)\n. Workaround: Use fingerblast.js.\n. Hi @KyleMorgan49, I can't seem to find what the \"menu\" icon looks like on Android. Do you mind providing a screenshot of the icon?\nThe current iconset includes the following icons from the original repo: http://turbo87.github.io/Android-Action-Bar-Icon-Pack-Font/ Please note that the class names may differ from this list.\n. Also, I'm having issues regarding the licensing of the Android official icons and @turbo87 's Action Bar Icon Pack Font. I'm thinking of redoing the icon font myself and licensing it using MIT so Fries users don't need to attribute them to the original author.\nThe Android official icons are (I believe) licensed under Creative Commons 2.5. Which is annoying cause you have to attribute it to the Android Open Source Project.\nAny thoughts about this?\n. Oops, sorry. I misread your post. I didn't see the \"three horizontal lines\". Got it.\n. I meant redoing the font iconset from SVG and converting them into a font and release it under MIT. So Fries users can just attribute their works to the Android Open Source Project instead of having to put so many licensing stuff on their work. I'm not sure if that's possible though.\n. @Turbo87, yes I'm having the same issues as you are right now. I don't have the time (yet) to research on the matter but I'd be more than willing to be less restrictive on this matter as well. But as far as Fries is concerned, I think I already made the changes I need to do to both the website (documentation) and the README to properly attribute the icons to the Android Open Source Project and to you. If this however does not suffice your requirements for attribution, please by all means, tell me so I can make the changes.\n. Alright man, cool. :) Thanks for clarifying this. Cheers!\n. Couldn't find a more complete icon set. Closing this for now.\n. Hi there @aboudard, no I believe this is not \"normal\". What version of Fries are you using?\n. Alright. Can you try doing a console.log() inside the code where you try to catch the back button? I'm very willing to help you with your problem. :)\n. But will the app still exit if you press the back button on index.html?\nEdit: I currently don't have an Android phone right now that's why I'm asking. xD\n. Hmm. That's odd. Is there any particular reason why you're catching the back button functionality? Cause when I tested this, I never had to catch the back button and still it works fine.\nBy the way, the style on other pages does not load if stack.js fails to load properly in index.html.\n. Thanks @aymanfarhat. I couldn't test the problem.\n@aboudard you could also try to build and install https://github.com/jaunesarmiento/HelloFries on your device. That project was made using ./create <project_folder_path> <package_name> <project_name> command from the Cordova Android distribution.\n. Back button seems to be working fine on v2.0.0\n. Oops, sorry about that. Thanks @BR41N1! :)\n. It is here. :) It's on the gh-pages branch.\n. Needs testing on an Android device.\n. Hi @aymanfarhat, I've been thinking of the same workflow when I stumbled upon https://build.phonegap.com again recently. Although to have this kind of workflow, we'll have to move a lot of things around which may cause a little confusion for the existing user base.\n. Testing on the browser is fine for now.\n. Don't mind the large number of deletions. I accidentally committed the styles for a themed version of Fries. :)\n. Hi @shuaishuai, nope I won't be adding RequireJS to handle modularization in Fries. The framework is already too deep into the development of version 1.0.1. I can however reconsider this for the later versions of Fries.\n. @shuaishuai I'd rather use RequireJS. It's a much more elegant solution rather than having Fries components in the window variable.\n@Wolfr, I think the best approach would be to use BEM method which, correct me if I'm wrong, being used by those mentioned frameworks. Actually, I've been thinking about redoing Fries from scratch yet again due to these kinds of concerns. I honestly wasn't able to think this through in a long-term context. But I really love having these kinds of conversations. Fries is still young, I think, so a lot can still change.\n. Will add it to the next version. :)\n. Hi @florindumitru, yes Fries does not execute any scripts from the loaded page. You must add your scripts to index.html and listen for events there.\n. Here's a little something on how to do this, you must catch the push event that stack.js fires whenever a page gets pushed onto the screen.\nSo given that you have an inner page like this:\n<div id=\"page2\" class=\"page\">\n  <!-- some content here -->\n</div>\nYou just need to do the following in your index.html:\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nwindow.addEventListener('push', function () {\n  if (document.getElementById('page2')) {\n    console.log('We are on page 2');\n    // do what you want here\n  }\n});\n</script>\nThis may not be the best solution but I think this will work for now. @aymanfarhat and I have already had a few discussions on how to hook code when loading a new page. I think this is something that should really be included in Fries.\nAnd no, I actually haven't tested Fries on iOS. And I believe it won't work on Android 2.2 due to its stock browser being outdated.\n. Wrong pull request\n. I didn't notice this when I was testing on Samsung Galaxy S2. Can anybody else confirm this?\n. I'll be getting an Android phone next week. Will test this as soon as I get one. As of now, I really don't have anything to test it on.\n. Hi @jadjoubran, I've tested this on a Nexus 4. And I'm not experiencing the issue you're stating.\n. Seem to be working fine on mine. Closing this.\n. TODO: add an example of the dialog on index.html\n. I still haven't decided on which to use LOL. Now that you've mentioned it, I'll see which available mixins are viable. :)\n. Hi @teusinkorg. Yes I've been meaning to add this feature a while back. I already have a candidate library to port over to Fries. You may want to check Snap.js as it implements this fairly simple, it's widely used in Ratchet prototypes and the development is active. :)\n. Yes I know. :) What I meant is that the core functionality of the navigation drawer is implemented in Snap.js. I think you can expect this feature on the version 1.0.1.\nCheers!\n. Hi @grobmeier, sorry if it was a misleading for you. But Tobias didn't ask for attribution for his work. His repository (https://github.com/Turbo87/Android-Action-Bar-Icon-Pack-Font) does not even have a license.txt file or any licensing of some sort. He did mention that parts of his work contain modifications of the original Android icons. Thus the only attribution I need to make was to the Android Open Source Project.\nIf you asked Tobias directly for his permission to use the fonts then by all means please let me know.\n. @grobmeier yes I've read it. Until Tobias states how he should be attributed to the work, I won't make any changes to the attribution part of my README because I am still in compliance to it. Google only asks that I should add \"Portions of this page are modifications based on work created and shared by Google and used according to terms described in the Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution License.\" so yeah.\n. Was talking about Google's license. I didn't notice that they updated to CC 3.0.\nAnyway, I'll be updating the README and the website shortly.\nThanks!\n. Fixed.\n. Related to issue #31.\n. Hi @soomtong, thanks for the contribution. :) I was planning to add this but I forgot to do so.\n. I'll also update the docs with this. Thanks again!\n. Hi @xpose2000, I've been aware of the issue since I got a hold of a phone lately but I haven't got the chance to find a work around for it. \nI'll look into it tomorrow ;-) I'll try your suggestion as well. Cheers! \n. This issue is related to these:\n- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13219017/ghostclicks-in-mobile-apps\n- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13064418/mobile-fast-click-prevent-ghost-focus\n. Although it seems that this doesn't happen on version 2.0.0. Can anyone else test this? Here's a sample Phonegap app using Fries: https://github.com/jaunesarmiento/fries-phonegap\n. Hi @vishnu123. Unfortunately Fries has only been tested on devices that I got a hold of. And all of them are on Android 4.0 and above.\nSo yes, Fries only supports 4.0 and above (for now, I guess). I'm still thinking of bringing support to lower versions of Android but I doubt that everything will work though.\nAs for the changes required, since I don't have a device with Android 2+, I'm not sure how it can be tweaked to make it work. I'm really sorry about this.\n. Apparently, this issue is valid. I've received an email asking how this can be fixed. A discussion going on here seemed to have fixed this issue. Just need someone to try and test if it works.\n. Hi @hackersysCG, cool thanks! Yes, I'd love that. Will work on a fix for now based on the links posted above. I'll give you a nudge when it's done. :)\n. Hi @hackersysCG, can you confirm if http://filamentgroup.github.io/Overthrow/ scrolls on your mobile browser?\n. I think that might be a little hard to do as those Android versions' browsers only have partial support for the flexbox layout. And that should be discussed in a different thread. :)\n. I'll create a separate thread for those issues first.\n. Oops\n. Hi @hell03610, is there any reason you need the current url in your prototype? Because unless you do, I think this bug is harmless to your prototype but yes, this is considered a bug and I'll try to fix it. Thanks!\n. That's odd. I'll check the difference between master and wip branch again. Thanks for reporting Emma. \n. It appears that this happens on Ratchet as well. So I'm going to close this for now as it doesn't seem like a real problem to us.\n. Related to #26.\n. Will be fixed on next push. :) Thanks!\n. Wow @bernatfortet, I never thought of that. Thanks for this. This can be used to make testing easier as well.\n. Hi @EltonZhang13, what version of Fries are you using? Because I'm pretty sure that this was fixed on wip-1.0.1 branch.\n. Sure thing. The problem was that in the master branch, the action overflows aren't re-initialized when the push event is called. If you check action-bars.js in wip-1.0.1 branch, you'll see the following line:\njavascript\nwindow.addEventListener('push', checkActionOverflow, false);\nThat line handles the reinitialization of the action overflows when a page is pushed onto the history stack. :)\nHope that clears things up for you.\n. No problem bud. :) Glad to help.\n. Fixed\n. Hi @markusthoemmes, thanks for reminding me. I was planning to add this to the documentation but since the next version is not up for release yet, I didn't include it yet. Will add on the next version.\nCheers!\n. Included in version 2.0.0 docs.\n. Hi @jituiitm, on what platform are you testing? Desktop Chrome or on your mobile device? Would help if you'd post how you're doing the radios and toggles.\n. That's odd. Hmm. On what device and Android version are you testing the Phonegap app on? Can't do skype/hangout right now unfortunately. I'll check this on my end. Will keep you posted.\n. I can confirm that the on/off switches and radio buttons does not work on desktop. But I've tried them on https://github.com/jaunesarmiento/fries-phonegap and they work fine. Can you try running this example on your device? It's a Phonegap app btw.\n. Alright cool, thanks @jituiitm!\n. For tabs, the first step that should be done is to find out which syntax of the flexbox layout is supported in Android versions lower than 4.0, then we can try and fix that. @hackersysCG, if you can play around with the examples and change the flexbox layout syntax for the tabs component, that'd be awesome.\n. Related to #68. Thanks for bringing this up. Will work on this along with issue #68. I'm looking for a few ways to implement this. I'm thinking of adding a data-attribute to the .page that tells stack.js that the page is at root level and should clear the history when it's encountered. What do you think?\n. It's not yet a solution, @berthojoris. I'm just throwing in ideas on how to tackle this problem. Are you sure it's the device's back button and not the \"up\" button?\n. Hi @soomtong, I've been really busy lately. I can't even work on the issues. Will try to work on this when I get the time. Cheers!\n. Hi @chiragnarula, you might want to look at two things:\n1. First check if you have an onClick attribute in your <body> tag. You'll want to remove that.\n2. Then make sure you have data-ignore=\"true\" attribute in your links and buttons.\n. Are you sure about this? I just checked the examples and they work fine.\n. On second thought, let's do this in a develop branch.\n. Issue noted. :) Will fix this in the next updates.\n. Nope not yet. Still working on it. :)\nOn Nov 27, 2013 7:32 PM, \"vishnu123\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nIs this fixed in Fries v2.0.3?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/jaunesarmiento/fries/issues/80#issuecomment-29377710\n.\n.

Hi @ale110, yeah I agree that creating checkboxes is really hard to do right now. I'll be rewriting the form elements soon when I get the time.\n. Hi @Busk07, thanks for pointing this out. I can't believe I missed that. Thanks! :)\n. Ah, thanks!\n. Let's put this on development branch first. I'll set develop as the default branch so we can merge these without affecting the latest stable release. Also, I'll be creating a branch for version 2.1 with a list of features. I'm planning to add both holo dark and light themes to that as well.\n. Closing this for now.\n. > Well, that's actually what tags are for, isn't it? Even though current master can be considered stable (and shouldn't be default for adding new commits (except for urgent fixes) anyway), I thought the lastest stable is 2.0.3? ;-)\n\nOh, right. Haha. Good to have someone who points out my mistakes. :)\n\n(BTW, I noticed that you link to the https://github.com/jaunesarmiento/fries/archive/master.zip in the readme file rather than to https://github.com/jaunesarmiento/fries/archive/2.0.3.zip (=latest stable). Is that on purpose?)\n\nYes, I noticed that. It's my fault. It's supposed to be pointed to 2.0.3. :P\n. > Would you merge my changes from PR #91 into the new develop branch? If so, I can send you a new PR now. In case you don't, note it contains some JS fixes too. You may still want to merge these changes, even though you don't want to merge themes atm.\nSend a PR to wip/v2.1.0. I'll merge it right away.\n. As mentioned in #90, I'm closing this for now.\n. I'm currently working on all of the fixes. All new features haven't been touched yet. :) As for ETA, two weeks from now would be nice. I'm pretty busy during the day but I can work on them when I'm at home.\n. Yeah, sure thing. :)\n. Ahh this is gonna be tough. Do you mind merging on your branch?\n. The conflicts I mean. With 54 files changed, I think the number of conflicts would be tough to merge.\n. Can you check if the dialogs and toast notifications work on the documentation and examples?\n. I think the latest fingerblast.js may have caused the dialogs and toasts to break.\n. I've just confirmed that the latest fingerblast.js and fixes done to example.js and documentation.js broke the dialogs and toast notifications. Can you have a look at this on your end?\n. Awesome! Thanks!\n. Yes, develop is pretty much useless right now. I think deleting that branch\nis fine.\nJust send your pull requests to wip/v2.1.0.\nOn Mar 13, 2014 4:55 AM, \"Stephan Schmitz\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nGlad that's solved.

Already contacted GitHub regarding the removal of the CNAME. Someone has already squatted over jaunesarmiento.me as well, so I can't remove it manually.\n\nAs for merging projects, I can't give the project up that easily just cause I'm not maintaining it anymore. And I'd like to keep it for historical purposes. I hope you understand. You can, however, work on a fork.

I must admit that I haven't looked into it in great detail but my initial suspicion was that the sometimes choppy animation was caused by updating css properties inside a js loop/timeout.

Glad that's solved. :+1: \nOkay your wip/v2.1.0 branch is clean now and includes all recent updates as well as both themes. It is right now 11 commits ahead and 2 commits behind your new develop and the master branch (master and develop are on pair atm).\nSo, should I keep sending send new PRs to wip/v2.1.0 or, as previously said, to the new develop branch? Because actually develop branch is useless right now, isn't it?\n. PS: For the meantime, for those looking for a live demo, here's one: https://eyecatchup.github.io/fries/ (Note: This is a different tree that I started a while ago (off of 2.0.3), but fixes have been merged from latest master (plus, others were added).) \n. First, thanks for the feedback @jaunesarmiento.\nThen could you maybe remove the redirect for the GH pages branch to your custom domain, so people can checkout the current state there? Still better than linking into Nirvana, isn't it?\nLast but not least, in case you no longer maintain Fries, what would you say if I'll take over? As you may remember I commited some code a while ago for the wip/v2.1.0 branch and added \"Multi-Theme-Support\" to the demo site. A month ago I started to work on a Material Design based CSS/JS Framework. Now I came back to Fries to see wether I should consider to use Fries as a base (mainly because I liked the simple code base). \nBasically I'd like to merge Fries and my project anyways - so to have only one Framework that serves Holo and Material themes. So, if you don't care anymore anyway, I think it would be a good idea to let me take over. I guess the 1000+ Fries users would appreciate as well.\nWhat do you think?\n. Almost got it. Except for what you said about you can't give up on the project. Don't get me wrong, I'm perfectly fine to work with my fork. But it is somewhat in contrast to the updated README.md - which asks for somebody to take over now!? Could you clarify that last bit for me, please? Thanks (again)! :)\n. Added PR #91 \n. > Let's put this on development branch first.\nYeah, that's what I did in my fork too. Sorry, that's my fault. Didn't wanted tor create the PR to be merged into master but rather into a new branch. \n\nI'll set develop as the default branch\n\n:+1: \n\nso we can merge these without affecting the latest stable release.\n\nWell, that's actually what tags are for, isn't it? Even though current master can be considered stable (and shouldn't be default for adding new commits (except for urgent fixes) anyway), I thought the lastest stable is 2.0.3? ;-)\n(BTW, I noticed that you link to the https://github.com/jaunesarmiento/fries/archive/master.zip in the readme file rather than to https://github.com/jaunesarmiento/fries/archive/2.0.3.zip (=latest stable). Is that on purpose?)\n\nAlso, I'll be creating a branch for version 2.1 with a list of features. I'm planning to add both holo dark and light themes to that as well.\n\n:+1: \n. @jaunesarmiento Would you merge my changes from PR #91 into the new develop branch? If so, I can send you a new PR now. In case you don't, note it contains some JS fixes too. You may still want to merge these changes, even though you don't want to merge themes atm.\n. here you go: #93 \n. closing this one\n. Any ETA for v2.1? Need help? If so; What points from your list are you currently working on and/or have a working implementation already? Or can I take on any of the points above, fix it and submit a PR?\n. Sounds great. No stress; take your time. I know what it means working all day long and maintaining open source projects in the free time. We'Re all thankful for your work and it takes the time it takes. ;-)\nSo, would you mind me starting on a sidebar nav implementation?\n. Nope, all I care for is the result. ;-) \nBut just for me to know: any conflicts or what do you mean by \"this is gonna be tough\"?\n. Actually it's not 54 files that were changed! Most of these 54 files are the holo-light files that were not in the main repo before. Thus, they become a \"change\". But in fact these \"changes\" are just plain copies from the holo-light branch.\nAnd finally I had no conflicts at all when I just tried to merge your wip 2.1 and my dev-2.0.4 branch locally. So, what conflicts do you get?\n. checking \nupdate: it's not fingerblast. it's the changes I made here\n// sometimes Android returns a width and height of zero..\n  // so we wait 10ms and try again.\n  // (Taken from Google's internal dots framework file webview.js)\n  var w = document.documentElement.clientWidth || document.body.clientWidth;\n  if ('undefined' === typeof w || w == 0) {\n    setTimeout(function() {\n       // do stuff\n    }, 10);\n    return;\n  }\ncommiting a fix in a sec\n.
