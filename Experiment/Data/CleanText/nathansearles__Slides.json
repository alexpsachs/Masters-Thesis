    "nathansearles": "You can easily add a description under an image. It's just a matter of adding a p or a div tag below other content like an image and style with CSS accordienly. \n. Oh yeah with a little jQuery you can easily make that happen.\n. Check out http://jqapi.com/#p=hover\n. Are you having an issue when you add HTML to a slide?\n. Do you have an example online that I could check out? An iFrame might be kinda funky, haven't tried that before. \n. You can do that by adjusting the height and width of \".slides_container\".\n. That is all possible. Just change the slideshow size in the CSS and of course adjust the image width/height. For the dots just absolutely postion them where ever you like.\n. I'm pretty sure the errors aren't coming from Slides, because it still runs fine once you get past them.\nLooks like the javascript just needs to be cleaned up on the page. There is 2 version of jQuery loading and a lot of other JS files. If any of them aren't need remove them and that should help.\n. Don't want to be rude, but I can not help you troubleshot issues on your site that don't have to do with Slides. Thanks.\n. Looks like there is some styles being inherited and that's messing things up in IE.\nI'd suggest looking into using a CSS browser reset. That'll clear up those kinds of issues.\nhttp://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2007/05/01/reset-reloaded/\nThere isn't a play/pause button, mainly because users don't actually interact with them, but there is a pause on hover option and also pause or stop when a user interacts with next/prev or pagination buttons.\nCheck out the documentation for info on pause on hover and other features. http://slidesjs.com\n. Looks like the pagination image is missing.\nIt's linked to http://www.brianrhea.com/scwd/css/images/pagination.png\nI do see the dots there, but I can't tell we're those are coming from. The pagination dots should be within or applied to with CSS to each of the anchor tags within pagination.\nIf you use Firefox download Firebug and inspect the elements, you'll see what I'm talking about.\n. Ha, yeah duh. I'm so used to using a CSS browser reset I never see those. I highly recommend using one, makes life so much easier especially with cross-browser testing.\nhttp://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2007/05/01/reset-reloaded/\n. Yes you can. It's just a matter of including the easing plugin and modifying somethings in slides.js. \nAny place you see 'fadeSpeed' or 'slideSpeed' add the easing name after it.\nFor example check out line 80 in slides.js, change to this:\n},option.slideSpeed,function(){\nTo this:\n},option.slideSpeed,'easeInOutQuad',function(){\nAnd that'll add easing to the slider.\n. Yeah slide speed only shows up twice.\nIf you want you can just take the uncompressed code and run it through http://fmarcia.info/jsmin/test.html to get the min version.\nGlad that worked for you.\n. Do you have a URL you could sen me?\n. And here's an example of Slides working in WP http://www.makeupgeek.com/\n. When using z-index you also have to use a position attribute. So on line 28 of your CSS #navigation also needs position:relative;\n. Yeah that sounds like a bug. I'll check it out and make an update. Thanks.\n. That's fixed in the latest version. Thanks!\n. For sure it'd be possible with a little jQuery.\nOne thing to note is that Slides won't slide past multiple images as a feature.\n. Hey Jan, looks like you have margin: 0 auto; applied to everything. I think that is what's causing that issue.\nJust remove or change following on line 1 style.css.\n* {\n    margin: 0 auto;\n}\n. Yeah that's not possible within jQuery its self. Because the element that you're trying to attach Slides to is display:none; jQuery thinks that div and everything with in it dosen't exists.\nA way around that is to use visibility:hidden; but that can cause some other issues.\n. I just fixed some bugs having to do with auto height. Download the latest version and let me know if that fixes the issue.\n. No worries man!\n. Both are fixed now. Thanks for that!\n. Give this a try. Make the images block level.\n.slides_control img {\n    display:block;\n}\n. Just made a test site and got it working:\nhttp://nathansearles.com/plugin/slides/test/\nDoes that work for you?\nMaybe one thing I should do is remove that animate to height on load.\n. Awesome man! Glad that worked. Hit me up if you need anymore help. \n. Just added that example to the download. Just download the latest and it'll be in the examples folder.\n. One thing you can do is fake a click on a pagination link.\nFor example:\n$('#example').click(function(){\n    $('.pagination a[rel=\"3\"]').click();\n});\nIn that example clicking an element with an ID of example with result in a click of a pagination link with a rel of 3 which will goto slide 4. Because JavaScript is creating and using the rel's in those links, 0 = 1. So just subtract 1 from whichever slide you want it to goto.\nHope that helps.\n. I just added the ability to link to a slide from a URL. Download the latest version and check out \"Linking\" within the examples folder. Let me know if you have questions.\n. Add list-style: none; to .pagination li in your css and that'll fix it.\n. Yeah that's a good call. Just added that to the latest version.\nThis is how to use it:\nanimationComplete: function(current){\n    // Current returns current slide number\n    console.log(current);\n}\nCheck out \"/examples/Images with titles/\" in the download for an example.\n. Yeah I'll have to look into adding deep linking. Love what you're doing though. I would like to find an easier way to link to a specific slide like from a hash. I'll have to mess around with that. Thanks for sharing this.\n. I just added slide-to-slide linking and deeplink. Download the latest and check out \"Linking\" within the examples folder. Let me know if that works out for you.\n. Good call Michael. I just added that to version 1.1.4 that'll be up a in a few. Thanks for the suggestion.\n. Yeah good call. That's been changed in the latest version. Thanks!\n. You don't need global.css for the slider to work it's just an example of how it could be styled.\nHere's an example of a simplified CSS. Again you don't need any of this for the slider to work.\n```\nslides {\nposition:relative;\n\n}\nslides .next,#slides .prev {\nposition:absolute;\ntop:107px;\nleft:-39px;\nwidth:24px;\nheight:43px;\ndisplay:block;\nz-index:101;\n\n}\n.slides_container {\n    width:570px;\n    height:270px;\n    overflow:hidden;\n    position:relative;\n}\nslides .next {\nleft:585px;\n\n}\n.pagination {\n    margin:26px 0 0;\n}\n.pagination li {\n    float:left;\n    margin:0 1px;\n}\n.pagination li a {\n    display:block;\n}\n```\n. Slides.min.jquery.js doesn't exists on the server. \nLooks like it should be in the /js/ folder. http://fattoad.co.uk/js/slides.min.jquery.js.\nMake sure that file is there then it should work.\n. If you goto the the URL you link to http://fattoad.co.uk/js/slides.min.jquery.js the file dosen't load so there is still something up. Not sure if the file name is just slightly off or if there is an issue with your server.\nBut it appears this file still dosen't exists. http://fattoad.co.uk/js/slides.min.jquery.js\n. Awesome. Glad that helped. Let me know if that all made sense with that example.\n. Do you have an example of what you're working on that you can send me?\n. Yeah I see what you're saying IE6/7 is messing things up for sure. I see what's causing the issue it'll take some time to test some things out. Look for a new version this evening.\nThanks!\n. This issue is now fixed in the latest version. Thanks for reporting it. Let me know if you have any other issues.\n. Cool thanks, I'll check it out.\n. Try updating ul.pagination li a with padding: 12px 0 0 0; looks like there is some padding be inherited.\nAnd because the styles are all inline, the current state won't work. Can you have the styles not be inline?\n. First thing is you're loading 2 different versions of jQuery, 1.4.4 and 1.4.2 that'll mess some things up.\nSecond thing is the markup structure you're using is incorrect for Slides. Match the following.\n<div id=\"slides\">\n    <div class=\"slides_container\">\n        <div>\n            <p>Slide One</p>\n            <p>Slide Two</p>\n            <p>Slide Three</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"prev\">Previous</a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"next\">Next</a>\n</div>\nThat should hopefully fix the issues you're seeing.\n. That code I provided is just the basic HTML structure needed for Slides to work.\nYou'll need a container DIV with an ID that can be \"slides\". Next inside the main container div you'll need another DIV with a class of \"slides_container\". Then with in that put your slide divs.\nSo you'll end up with something like:\n<div id=\"slides\">\n    <div class=\"slides_container\">\n        <div>Slide One</div>\n        <div>Slide Two</div>\n        <div>Slide Three</div>\n    </div>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"prev\">Previous</a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"next\">Next</a>\n</div>\nAnd sorry the HTML I provided in the earlier example was incorrect, typing to fast, but this is correct.\n. Yeah it works great in WP here's an example: http://www.makeupgeek.com/\nAlso there is a WP Plugin that's been developed: https://github.com/sico/Slides-for-Wordpress\nCan you send me a link of what you're working on?\n. Sweet, so you got it all working?\n. For sure good call. I'll add that in there. Glad you're diggin' it.\n. This issue have been fixed in the latest version 1.1.0.\n. Closing this issue. The CSS provided with Slides is just for example purposes. The intent is that the slideshow is styled accordingly to the site that it's being used on.\nPlease view the Simple example included in the download. You may also view this example online http://slidesjs.com/examples/simple/ this example is ment to show the most basic and unstyled version of Slides for easier design.\n. Something has to be wrong. Have an example?\nAnd yes you can have multiple sliders on one page. Each should have it's own ID.\n. It'd be rad if you had an example of the bug you're seeing and I bet I could add a fix for it. Thanks!\n. Looks like there is 2 empty \"div.slides\" in there. Are you using a CMS that's auto generating that code?\n. You'll need to add slides2 and slides3 to:\n$('#slides,#slides2,#slides3').slides({\n    preload: true,\n    preloadImage: 'img/loading.gif',\n    generatePagination: true,\n    play: 0,\n    pause: 2500,\n    hoverPause: true,\n    // Get the starting slide\n    start: startSlide,\n    animationComplete: function(current){\n        // Set the slide number as a hash\n        window.location.hash = '#' + current;\n    }\n});\n. I can not reproduce this issue. Please provide a URL to an example and I can take a look.\n. PNG fixes are a mess. If IE6 support is required I'll usually just swap PNGs for GIFs. You can do that with a little jQuery or using something like http://rafael.adm.br/css_browser_selector/.\n. Tested what you have there and works fine using the /examples/Linking example in the download.\nDoes \"#products\" exist on the page?\n. What I'd do for that is wrap each image in a div:\n<div class=\"slide\">\n    <img src=\"galleries/cultural/A.jpg\" width=\"450\" height=\"300\" />\n</div>\nThen in your CSS:\n```\n.slides_container .slide {\n    width: 450px;\n    height: 450px;\n    position: relative;\n}\n.slides_container .slide img {\n    position: absolute;\n    bottom: 0;\n    right: 0;\n}\n```\nThat should do the trick.\n. Awesome!\n. Just tweak the position in the CSS for .caption and tweak the following within that example's index.html\nanimationStart: function(){\n                $('.caption').animate({\n                    bottom:-35\n                },100);\n            },\n            animationComplete: function(current){\n                $('.caption').animate({\n                    bottom:0\n                },200);\n                if (window.console && console.log) {\n                    // example return of current slide number\n                    console.log(current);\n                };\n            }\nJust change 'bottom' to left or right and give a number for the position you'd want it to animate from/to.\n. In the CSS you'll also have to change left:0; to right:0; and bottom to 0.\nTry this:\n.caption {\n    z-index:500;\n    position:absolute;\n    bottom:0;\n    right:0;\n    height:30px;\n    padding:5px 20px 0 20px;\n    background:#000;\n    background:rgba(0,0,0,.5);\n    width:540px;\n    font-size:1.3em;\n    line-height:1.33;\n    color:#fff;\n    border-top:1px solid #000;\n    text-shadow:none;\n}\n. Change this:\n$(function(){\n    $('#web_slides').slides({\n        preload: true,\n        preloadImage: 'img/loading.gif',\n        play: 5000,\n        pause: 0,\n        hoverPause: true\n    });\n});\n$(function(){\n    $('#mobile_slides').slides({\n        preload: true,\n        preloadImage: 'img/loading.gif',\n        play: 5000,\n        pause: 2500,\n        hoverPause: true\n    });\n});\n$(function(){\n    $('#brand_slides').slides({\n        preload: true,\n        preloadImage: 'img/loading.gif',\n        play: 5000,\n        pause: 2500,\n        hoverPause: true\n    });\n});\nTo this:\n```\n$(function(){\n    $('#web_slides').slides({\n        preload: true,\n        preloadImage: 'img/loading.gif',\n        play: 5000,\n        pause: 0,\n        hoverPause: true\n    });\n$('#mobile_slides').slides({\n    preload: true,\n    preloadImage: 'img/loading.gif',\n    play: 5000,\n    pause: 2500,\n    hoverPause: true\n});\n\n$('#brand_slides').slides({\n    preload: true,\n    preloadImage: 'img/loading.gif',\n    play: 5000,\n    pause: 2500,\n    hoverPause: true\n});\n\n});\n```\nThe $(function(){}); is just a short hand version of $(document).ready(function() {}); and you only need to declare it once.\n. Slides fundamentally isn't built to do such a thing. But it is an interesting concept. I'll have to play around with adding something like that as a feature. Thanks!\n. It is possible to do this. Just find a lightbox plugin you'd like to use. Have it initialize after Slides has. It'll just take some testing and understanding how jQuery and plugins work.\n. If you can just send me a URL of what you're working on and I can take a look.\n. You can easily do this with the animationComplete option. Check out this example of its usage: http://slidesjs.com/examples/linking/\nWith that you can get the current slide number and show something else anywhere on the page.\n```\nanimationComplete: function(current){\n    /\n        Fade out the currently show caption\n        Remove class of current\n    / \n    $('#captions div.current').fadeOut(function(){\n        $(this).removeClass('current');\n    });\n/*\n    Fade in caption that is related to the current slide\n    This caption would have a class=\"caption_3\" for example for slide 3\n    The 'current' is variable passed in from Slides\n*/\n$('#captions .caption_' + current).fadeIn(function(){\n    $(this).addClass('current');\n})\n\n}\n```\nHope that helps.\n. Just take a little jQuery knowhow and a lightbox plugin you'd like to use.\n. The width of .slides_control is 3 x the width of your slides. So it's just a matter of setting the width of your slides appropriately.\nSo something like:\n.slides_control div {\n    width:500px\n}\n. Have an example URL you can send me?\n. Communicating via email\n. View the Linking example included in the download. I also have it up here: http://slidesjs.com/examples/linking/\nIn that example I use the animationComplete option and pass the current slide number to it. You should be able to use that to do what you describe.\n. Once you get something online shoot me the URL and I can take a look.\n. The IE7 issue had been resolved in the latest version 1.1.0.\n. Not sure what version was including with your WooTheme, but make sure you're using version 1.0.9. That should fix that issue.\n. Ha, it's probably your computer processing the sliding.\n. Make sure you're using both position and z-index on the container for your slideshow and your fixed elements. Just set one higher then the other. All child elements will then z-index with in their parent containers.\n```\nelement {\nposition:relative;\nz-index:100;\n\n}\n```\nHope that helps.\n. Check out the linking example in the download. You can also view it here: http://slidesjs.com/examples/linking/\nThat should get you in the right direction.\n. From what you're describing sounds to me that you can just put all 15 slides in the slideshow and it'll do what you're intending.\nOr if you're trying to create a \"carousel\" you could just put multiple items in each slide to create a set.\n. Not sure what you're asking, can you clarify? \n. Yeah sure there is a way. You'd be better off using JSON vs. XML. You can use jQuery's getJSON function http://jqapi.com/#p=jQuery.getJSON.\nThen in the callback, when everything is loaded, you can initialize Slides.\n. You could do that by taking the \"position\" and \"direction\" variables from \"next\" and swapping with \"prev\" in the \"animate\" function.\n. With SlidesJS 2 you can do this.\nCheck out the \"direction\" option:\ndirection: \"left\", // [String] Define the slide direction: \"Up\", \"Right\", \"Down\", \"left\"\n. Yep it's on the list, it's a matter of when I can find some time to add it.\nThanks!\n. There isn't an example of that but it's just a matter of writing some css to achieve that.\n. Fixed in version 1.1.1. It's now required that you provide a width and height for your slideshow.\n$(function(){\n    $('#slides').slides({\n        width: 570,\n        height: 270\n    });\n});\n. Check out http://slidesjs.com/ on there I state all the options you can use and how to use them. For your case you'd want to do something like:\n<script>\n    $(function(){\n      $(\"#slides\").slides({\n        play: 5000,\n        pause: 2500,\n        effect: 'fade'\n      });\n    });\n</script>\nAdd that to the head of you HTML, after you load jQuery and slides.jquery.js.\nHope that helps.\nNathan\n. This could still use some tweaking, but your basic JSON call to append images within Slides would like something like:\n$.getJSON(\"http://www.panoramio.com/map/get_panoramas.php?set=52440&from=0&to=20&minx=-180&miny=-90&maxx=180&maxy=90&size=medium&callback=?\",\n        function(data) {\n            $.each(data.photos, function(i, photo) {\n                $('<a/>', {\n                    href: photo.photo_url,\n                    html: $('<img/>', {\n                        src: photo.photo_file_url,\n                        alt: photo.photo_title\n                    })\n                }).appendTo('#slides .slides_container');\n            });\n            $('#slides').slides({\n                preload: false,\n                preloadImage: 'img/loading.gif',\n                play: 5000,\n                pause: 2500,\n                hoverPause: true\n            });\n        });\n. Nope. Slides isn't built in the traditional timeline style that most slideshows are based on.\n. Putting Flash inside of something that animates is not recommend. You'll get some funky results especially with slower browsers like IE. But you could do it with http://flowplayer.org/ and call a stop function on Slides' animationComplete function.\n. Yep, set hoverPause to true.\n$(function(){\n  $(\"#slides\").slides({\n    hoverPause: true\n  });\n});\n. Currently there is not, but that's going into the next version.\n. It could be done. You'd have to have a moderate understanding of jQuery and edit the plugin.\n. Awesome thanks for the suggestions. I'll make some tweaks to CSS.\n. Yeah you should only see the hash show up in the Linking example, and you can remove \"window.location.hash\" and that'll no longer change the hash to your current slide number.\n. Fixed in version 1.1.1. It's now required that you provide a width and height for your slideshow.\n$(function(){\n    $('#slides').slides({\n        width: 570,\n        height: 270\n    });\n});\n. Currently there isn't a way to do that. The randomize function randomizes every slide.\n. You could set the images to display none in your CSS.\n```\nslides img {\ndisplay:none;\n\n}\n```\n. Thanks! I'll look into it.\n. Thanks for letting me, I'll look into a fix for this.\n. It could be possible but would take some tweaking of the JavaScript to achieve it. Not sure what your JS expertise is but it'd require mid to advanced skill to make that happen.\n. Yeah looks like a bug in jQuery. Thanks for pointing it out.\n. this is fixed in version 1.1.4\n. Make sure you're using the latest version. Tested it with version 1.1.3 and it's working as it should.\nSounds like there could be something else going on. Make sure you don't have any end HTML tags that don't need to be there and that you have the CSS properly setup, view this example for the basic CSS needed. http://slidesjs.com/examples/simple/\n. Damn, probably not anytime soon. It'd take a decent re-write to do something like that.\nThanks!\n. Add this to your CSS:\n.slides_container img {\n    width:517px;\n    height:337px;\n    display:block;\n}\nWhat's happening is Slides needs the width and height of your slides, in this case you're using images as slides. So in the CSS you need to set the width and height. Also the slide needs to be block level and since images are not block level by default you'll state that in the CSS.\nThanks for the URL!\n. That's currently not possible, but it is something that I'll look into adding.\n. Not likely to happen soon. It'll take a rewrite of the plugin to get that feature integrated. Sorry about that.\n. That'll depend what browser you're viewing it in, each acts a little differently in that case.\nWhat you could do is an external interface call on animationStart() to pause the Flash animation. That is if Flash is listening for that external interface call.\n. Awesome. thanks Adam! I'll get that integrated in to the next version. Appreciate it!\n. There isn't a super easy way to have 2 paginations. But you could do a fake click on the main pagination from another set of links.\nSay you have an anchor with a class of link somewhere on the page:\n<a href=\"#2\" class=\"link\">Link 2</a>\nUsing that we can fake a click on the 2nd item in the main pagination, thus causing the slideshow to animate to the 2nd slide.\n```\n$('.link').click(function(){\n    /\n        Let's get the slide number we want to goto\n        by using what's in the \"href\" of the link that was clicked\n        and we'll want to remove the hash.\n    /\n    var link = $(this).attr('href').replace('#','');\n    /\n        So now the variable \"link\" will give us\n        2 or whatever we put in the href.\n    /\n    /\n        Here's where the fake click happens.\n        We'll find the li with the anchor that\n        we want clicked using the selctor \":eq()\",\n        that selector is zero based so 0 = 1, so\n        that's why I do (link - 1). Since we're putting\n        a varible into a string we'll have to use a + operator\n        to concatenate it all together.\n    /\n    $('#slides .pagination li:eq(' + (link - 1) + ') a').click();\n// this just prevents default click behavior\nreturn false;\n\n});\n```\nHope that helps.\n. Hey Felix, just make sure you don't have the \"pause\" option set and Slides will stop a auto playing slideshow on click of next/prev and pagination.\n. Check out the Linking example you can find on the Slides site and also in the download.\nhttp://slidesjs.com/examples/linking/#4\n. That'll work unless you have multiple slideshows on one page.\nWhat you can try is the following.\nSay you have some links:\n<a href=\"#1\" class=\"link\">Slide 1</a>\n<a href=\"#2\" class=\"link\">Slide 2</a>\n<a href=\"#3\" class=\"link\">Slide 3</a>\nYou can do something like this in jQuery:\n```\n$('.link').click(function(){\n    /\n        Let's get the slide number we want to goto\n        by using what's in the \"href\" of the link that was clicked\n        and we'll want to remove the hash.\n    /\n    var link = $(this).attr('href').replace('#','');\n    /\n        So now the variable \"link\" will give us\n        either 1, 2, 3 or whatever we put in the href.\n    /\n    /\n        Here's where the fake click happens.\n        We'll find the li with the anchor that\n        we want clicked using the selctor \":eq()\",\n        that selector is zero based so 0 = 1, so\n        that's why I do (link - 1). Since we're putting\n        a varible into a string we'll have to use a + operator\n        to concatenate it all together.\n    /\n    $('#slides .pagination li:eq(' + (link - 1) + ') a').click();\n// this just prevents default click behavior\nreturn false;\n\n});\n```\nSo with that when you click say this link \"Slide 3\" jQuery will then click the pagination link 3 and then the slideshow will goto slide number 3.\nHere's some more info about the :eq() selector: http://jqapi.com/#p=eq-selector\n. I'm not seeing that in Chrome. I may be adding a onSlidesLoad function to the options to the next version with that you could show the caption once everything is loaded.\n. Just added a slidesLoaded option to version 1.1.5 and updated the images with captions example with how to use it.\n. It's not built to do that, but could be added if you have some JS knowledge.\n. Yeah that's a good call, I'll look into it. Thanks!\n. Give this a try.\nSay you have some links:\n<a href=\"#1\" class=\"link\">Slide 1</a>\n<a href=\"#2\" class=\"link\">Slide 2</a>\n<a href=\"#3\" class=\"link\">Slide 3</a>\nYou can do something like this in jQuery:\n```\n$('.link').click(function(){\n    /\n        Let's get the slide number we want to goto\n        by using what's in the \"href\" of the link that was clicked\n        and we'll want to remove the hash.\n    /\n    var link = $(this).attr('href').replace('#','');\n    /\n        So now the variable \"link\" will give us\n        either 1, 2, 3 or whatever we put in the href.\n    /\n    /\n        Here's where the fake click happens.\n        We'll find the li with the anchor that\n        we want clicked using the selctor \":eq()\",\n        that selector is zero based so 0 = 1, so\n        that's why I do (link - 1). Since we're putting\n        a varible into a string we'll have to use a + operator\n        to concatenate it all together.\n    /\n    $('#slides .pagination li:eq(' + (link - 1) + ') a').click();\n// this just prevents default click behavior\nreturn false;\n\n});\n```\nSo with that when you click say this link \"Slide 3\" jQuery will then click the pagination link 3 and then the slideshow will goto slide number 3.\nHere's some more info about the :eq() selector: http://jqapi.com/#p=eq-selector\n. this will be added to the next release. Thanks!\n. Currently that's not supported but I'm looking into adding that to a future release.\nThanks!\n. Yes, dannyboy0 is correct. IE dosen't support rgba() which is used for the caption background. The example you are talking about is just that an example of what can be done. But it's up to you the developer to build it to your specifications.\n. You could modify the plugin and add something like:\n$('.stop').click(function(){\n    stop();\n});\nThat'll bind a click event to a link with a class of stop. When clicked it'll stop the slideshow. But won't work if you're using multiple slideshows on one page.\n. Dig the thinking. I'll have to looking into adding something like this in a feature release. Thanks!\n. Thanks again dannyboy0!\n. What you could do is swap the next and previous buttons using css positioning. That'll work if you're not using a pagination.\n. For sure there is.Using this example http://slidesjs.com/examples/standard/ you can use absolute positioning to position the pagination above slideshow using something like this.\n.pagination {\n    width: 100px;\n    position: absolute;\n    top: -35px;\n    left: 225px;\n}\n. Make sure you load your CSS before SlidesJS and that'll fix that issue.\n. Labeled as a bug, I'll get that fixed. Thanks!\n. It can be done. Just load your images with ajax or a getJSON call and then bind SlidesJS as usual.\n. Check out the Combining custom options section at the bottom of the SlidesJS site. http://slidesjs.com/#combining\n. Currently there isn't a way to do that but I'm looking into adding that into a future release.\n. You can use the start option for that. \nReview that on the Slides site:\nhttp://slidesjs.com/#start\n. Not by default but it'd be pretty damn easy to do something like that.\nYou could use \"location.hash\" to get the hash i.e. \"#something\" and set the start slide to what ever you like.\nHere's an example of that.\n```\nvar startSlide = 1;\nif (location.hash == \"#something\") {\n    startSlide = 3;\n}\n// Initialize Slides\n$('#slides').slides({\n    start: startSlide\n});\n```\n. It's not something that you could do by default but that's not saying it can't be done. It'd take a solid understanding of jQuery and the Slides plugin to get it to work.\n. Sounds like you need to check out jQuery's toggleClass() http://jqapi.com/#p=toggleClass\n. I'm working on a new version of Slides that'll have an update method. So say you dynamically add 3 slides to the slideshow, you can run the update method and that'll recalculate and update the slideshow. My goal is to have this out by the end of May.\n. Just use a slide div with an image and some text in it and set autoHeight to true. http://slidesjs.com/#autoheight\n. For that I'd create an array with the names you want to use then reference the array when updating the hash.\nSo something like this:\nanimationComplete: function(current){\n    var currentSlide = [\n    'something1',\n    'something2',\n    'something3',\n    'something4'\n    ];\n    window.location.hash = '#' + currentSlide[(current - 1)];\n}\nI'm doing \"current - 1\" because \"current\" starts at 1 and an array starts at 0.\nHope that helps.\n. Good call, I added a line to http://slidesjs.com/ about that. Did you get it working with 1.4.2? I had to get it working with 1.3.2 the other day because of a Drupal install. I have to look up what needed to be changed.\n. Yep, set bigTarget to false. Check out the 'bigTaret' option on http://slidesjs.com/#bigtarget for an example of how to implement.\n. Thanks man! I'll get that added to the project.\n. Ha, no worries. I pulled that out. Thanks man!\n. Sounds like there is something else going on there unrelated to Slides. Have a link?\n. How about a screenshot of the the lightbox effect you're talking about?\nSent from my iPhone\nOn Apr 21, 2011, at 8:07 PM, bigjoe92186reply@reply.github.com wrote:\n\nThanks for your quick response!

Yeah that makes sense. I'll have to put in a check for that. Thanks for pointing it out.\n. Just set generateNextPrev: false, it is by default, and use the following markup after \"slides_container\" and you can use what ever you like.\n<a href=\"#\" class=\"prev\">Older</a>\n<a href=\"#\" class=\"next\">Newer</a>\nReally just needs to have a class of prev and next and be within your main slideshow div, for example with in the div#slides.\n. Thanks for the help jeduan! Really appreciate it.\n. Do the examples on http://slidesjs.com/ work for you in IE6? If so I'd double check your implementation.\n. Thanks for this. Although it's not a feature I'll be including.\n. Thanks again jeduan!\n. Thanks @jeduan!\n. Hey man, the way it's setup now you'd have to have DIVs for each slide you want and then dynamically load slide content using animationComplete().\nIn my rewrite of Slides I'm adding a update method that'll easily allow you to dynamically add content.\n. Hopefully I'll have it out in 3 weeks.\n. Currently there isn't a way to do that, but my next down time I'm going to work on adding some public methods that would allow for that. Cheers!\n. IE dosen't support opacity in CSS so remove:\nbackground: rgba(0, 0, 0, .5);\nList items by default have bullets and margin so you have to turn that off:\nul.pagination {\n    list-style: none;\n    margin:0;\n}\nHope that helps\n. Here's what you could do. Add this html within your #slides div:\n<p id=\"slide_count\"><span class=\"current\">1</span> of <span class=\"total\"></span></p>\nThan add slidesLoaded and animationComplete options to the init code:\n$('#slides').slides({\n    preload: true,\n    preloadImage: 'img/loading.gif',\n    play: 5000,\n    pause: 2500,\n    hoverPause: true,\n    slidesLoaded: function() {\n        $('#slide_count .total').text( $('.slides_control').children().length );\n    },\n    animationComplete: function( current ) {\n        $('#slide_count .current').text( current );\n    }\n});\nAnd that'll do the trick. Here's a live example of that: http://slidesjs.com/examples/current-count/\n. There must be something else going on, cause that works fine. And the line you pointed out just gets the hash which is the \"#2\" in this example mydomainname.com/#2 so that defines the startSlide as 2.\n. That's fixed now in the latest version 1.1.8. Thanks!\n. This sounds like a browser level issue, not anything to do with JavaScript on the page.\n. Do you have an example? Hash change isn't built into SlideJS, but is something that could have been added. If it's a hash change issue it's still a browser issue having todo with the hash changes.\n. That could be done with a little jQuery knowhow separate from the plug-in.\n. Works as expected for me. I'd email WooThemes about it. Seems there is a few loading issue with that theme in iOS, my guess is it's timing issues within the theme.\n. Yes this can be done.\n. There are many factors that can come into play here. I'd look into centering UL LI elements.\n. You can easily position the next/prev links whereever you want using CSS.\n. Awesome. Thanks for pointing this out.\n. You could do this with a setTimeout() wrapped around the $('#elem').slides().\n. You need to provide links to your examples.\n. Don't seem to be using http://slidesjs.com on your site.\n. The ability to do that and more is coming very soon with SlidesJS 2. Hope to have a beta out by the end of the week.\n. Thanks for this. Could the issue be that you're on the first slide when invoking $(\"#slides\").slides(\"slide\",1)? I do see that bug. If you call the slide method and it's the same as your current slide it fails.\n. That's fixed now. Plus you reminded me to add error correction so someone can't enter a number less then 1 or a number greater then the total slides.\nThanks for this, really appreciate it!\n. Create your content dynamically from the XML then initialize Slides after all the slide content has loaded. Do you have a callback you could initialize Slides within?\n. Yes this will be really easy to do with SlidesJS 2. On animationComplete you can just check if current is 1 using $(elem).slides(\"status\",\"current\") and then stop the auto play with $(elem).slides(\"stop\").\nTurns out I forgot to add the auto play to the onload of Slides, so the only way to auto play at load right now is to do something like:\n$(elem).slides({\n    loaded: function() {\n        $(this).slides(\"play\");\n    }\n});\nBut I'll fix this in the next update. Thanks guys!\n. That's a good call.\nThis functionality has been rewritten in the next version of Slides so it won't use that same cache buster.\nThanks!\n. If you're trying to use Slides within Fancybox you have to initialize Slides when the Fancybox lightbox is created on the page. \nCheck out Fancybox's callback example on their site http://fancybox.net/ \nYou have Slides initialize on page load but the content for the slideshow isn't there until a lightbox is created. Once the lightbox is created then you can initialize Slides.\nHope that helps.\n. Sounds like an issues with your CSS, check that out and that'll fix the issue.\n. If you're using SlidesJS 2 and set responsive to true you can use .\nCheck out http://beta.slidesjs.com/examples/responsive/ for an example.\n. You can also use your own pagination with it's own links. Just have to set \"pagination\" to \"false\" in the options and create a pagination using a UL with a class of \"slidesPagination\" with LIs and anchor tags with what ever text or images you like. Use Firebug to copy the pagination Slides creates and paste it into your markup and edit away. \n. Yeah that'd be something good for the \"status\" option I'm adding to Slides 2.0. Right now it just returns the current slide number, the slideshows state and total slides, but previous slide would be a good idea as well.\nThanks!\n. Yeah that sounds kinda funky, wish I could reproduce it.\nSo it seems like the pagination is getting pushed down off the screen?\n. Glad you got it working. Sounds like you could have found a bug with Chrome.\n. Have an example of what you're working on? Sounds like you might not have the slide width and height set in the CSS.\n. Well as we know \"random\" isn't really random. You have 1/7 of chance of ending up on the same slide. Really that's pretty likely.\nIn an ideal scenario it'd store, using a cookie, html5 storage, or a hash, the last slide number and make sure that slide isn't displayed on refresh. Not something I'll have time to add anytime soon.\nYou could modify the randomizer to store the last slide and make sure that slide isn't displayed next.\n. This feature will be included in the next major release of Slides. You'll be able to slide left, right, up or down. You can download the beta of that here on GitHub.\n. Dosen't look like you're using Slides, but your image simply dosen't exist at the image source URL you're using.\n. I tested this out and couldn't reproduce the issues you're seeing. Something else must be going on. If you have any more info just let me know.\n. If you're using the beta 2.0+ you can use $(\"#slides\").slides(\"stop\") or $(\"#slides\").slides(\"play\"). This is a new feature and isn't supported in the current stable release version 1.1.8.\n. It sure can. I'd use jQuery.getJSON() to retrive the data then in the success callback create the markup and then initialize the Slides plugin.\nUnfortunately I don't have an example of this but the example that's on the jQuery site is great. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/\n. I haven't tested Slides out with jQuery Mobile. I'll assume you'll need jQuery along with it's mobile version to run Slides. There could be other issues besides that but I'm not sure.\nIf you're using Slides or anything that uses JavaScript for animation on a mobile device I'd check out this jQuery animation plugin because it uses CSS3 transitions rather then JavaScript for the animations. https://github.com/benbarnett/jQuery-Animate-Enhanced\n. I'm not planning on adding any additional effects right now, but I do like the idea of having separate effects plugins that could work with Slides. I'll have to mess around with that.\nThanks for the recommendation.\n. I tested out the settings you have and it worked as expected. So something else must be up.\nDo you have an example you can send me a link to?\n. Your file http://www.fixyourmix.com/hrapa/media/scripts/fancydropdown.js contains jQuery v1.3.2 that's what's causing the issue. Remove that version of jQuery from that file and it'll work.\n. Have an example you can send me?\n. Not surprising, thanks for letting me know.\n. I double checked and the minified version is complete in the zip. What text editor are you viewing it in? Some have issues displaying minified code because it's all on one line.\n. Check your source path for your images. Looks like that got changed or your images were removed from that path.\nUse Firebug or WebInspector to view the missing paths.\n. Yes that's possible. Check out the product demo for how to use a custom pagination: http://slidesjs.com/examples/product/\nYou just need a UL with a class of \"pagination\" with LIs and anchor tags within that.\n. Hey Matty, do you know of any sites that this is happening on that you could send me? Would love to check it out and see what's up. I have autoStart set on http://slidesjs.com and don't see any issue there but could be something else at play.\nThanks man!\n. It's possible and easier if you use JSON rather then RSS if possible. I'd use jQuery.getJSON() to retrive the data then in the success callback create the markup and then initialize the Slides plugin.\nUnfortunately I don't have an example of this but the example that's on the jQuery site is great. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/\n. That's definitely something that I've been looking into adding to Slides. That and CSS3 transitions for iOS devices.\n. Check out the linking example and I how I pass the current slide number. http://slidesjs.com/examples/linking/\nUsing the animationComplete callback which gets passed the current slide number from Slides you can capture that and display it on the page.\nWould look something like:\nanimationComplete: function(current){\n        $(\"#elem\").html(current);\n    }\n. Currently there isn't a built-in way to do this. I may look into adding this to SlidesJS 3 just depends on what other complexities it brings. SlidesJS originally intentent was to be a looping slideshow.\n. SlidesJS works fine with jQuery 1.8.x. And the version of jQuery you're referring to is 1.7.2, which also works fine with SlidesJS.\n. That'd be awesome! I am working on an all new version. So keep an eye out for that.\n. This is fixed in v3.0.2! Let me know how this update works for you. Cheers!\n. Might help if I updated my Firefox. :)\nThat's now fixed. Thanks!\n. Thanks for this! Which browser are you in?\n. Was it on the http://beta.slidesjs.com/ site? I've been trying to make that happen in Chrome but can't reproduce it.\nThanks man!\n. This should be fixed in the latest update. Give it a try and let me know if you're still seeing this happen. Thanks!\n. Heck yeah! Thanks for the help.\n. This should be fixed in the latest update. Give it a try: http://beta.slidesjs.com/\n. Yeah I've been thinking about doing some kind of click queue for a while. I'll give it a try!\n. I wrote this in there but it created other issues that need to be worked out first. It's still on my features list.\n. This issue is now resolved in SlidesJS beta 3.0.3a.\n. Yep!\n. This issue is now resolved. Grab the latest version SlidesJS beta 3.0.3a. Cheers!\n. For this check out the SlidesJS beta (http://beta.slidesjs.com/) which will be production ready very soon.\n. This issue has now been resolved. Just grab the latest version. 3.0.3a. Cheers!\n. Yeah, this is great input. I'll look into adding it. Thanks!\n. WebKit can do some really funky things when using CSS transitions. I've seen this and many other issues. Unfortunately these issues are apart of WebKits rendering.\n. Yeah that makes sense. I'll make CSS3 Transitions an option in the next update.\n. Awesome! Thanks for this. I'll have to get this over to the Coffee Script source and get it into the build. Cheers!\n. I just updated crossfade in version 3.0.3. Check it out http://slidesjs.com/examples/basic-fade/.\nAs for the image question, that's part of a larger issue. It'll be something I'll need to work on for slides with content and images. Which is on the top of my list to build an example of that and work on some fixes to the issues that come up.\n. You could just do something like this:\njavascript\n$(\"#slides img\").length\n. You should be able to use active set to false and effect set to \"slide\" or \"fade\". If not let me know and I'll fix that.\njavascript\n  $(\"#slides\").slidesjs({\n    navigation: {\n      active: false,\n      effect: \"slide\"\n    }\n  });\n. Thanks man!\n. There must be something else going on. SlidesJS 3 is compatible with jQuery 1.10+. I just retested it and everything appears to be working as expected. Is it possible that you're loading multiple versions of jQuery?\n. Unfortunately I no longer have the time to keep Slides up to date. As an alternative I'd check out http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/. It's what I've been using on recent projects.\n. You can easily add a description under an image. It's just a matter of adding a p or a div tag below other content like an image and style with CSS accordienly. \n. Oh yeah with a little jQuery you can easily make that happen.\n. Check out http://jqapi.com/#p=hover\n. Are you having an issue when you add HTML to a slide?\n. Do you have an example online that I could check out? An iFrame might be kinda funky, haven't tried that before. \n. You can do that by adjusting the height and width of \".slides_container\".\n. That is all possible. Just change the slideshow size in the CSS and of course adjust the image width/height. For the dots just absolutely postion them where ever you like.\n. I'm pretty sure the errors aren't coming from Slides, because it still runs fine once you get past them.\nLooks like the javascript just needs to be cleaned up on the page. There is 2 version of jQuery loading and a lot of other JS files. If any of them aren't need remove them and that should help.\n. Don't want to be rude, but I can not help you troubleshot issues on your site that don't have to do with Slides. Thanks.\n. Looks like there is some styles being inherited and that's messing things up in IE.\nI'd suggest looking into using a CSS browser reset. That'll clear up those kinds of issues.\nhttp://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2007/05/01/reset-reloaded/\nThere isn't a play/pause button, mainly because users don't actually interact with them, but there is a pause on hover option and also pause or stop when a user interacts with next/prev or pagination buttons.\nCheck out the documentation for info on pause on hover and other features. http://slidesjs.com\n. Looks like the pagination image is missing.\nIt's linked to http://www.brianrhea.com/scwd/css/images/pagination.png\nI do see the dots there, but I can't tell we're those are coming from. The pagination dots should be within or applied to with CSS to each of the anchor tags within pagination.\nIf you use Firefox download Firebug and inspect the elements, you'll see what I'm talking about.\n. Ha, yeah duh. I'm so used to using a CSS browser reset I never see those. I highly recommend using one, makes life so much easier especially with cross-browser testing.\nhttp://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2007/05/01/reset-reloaded/\n. Yes you can. It's just a matter of including the easing plugin and modifying somethings in slides.js. \nAny place you see 'fadeSpeed' or 'slideSpeed' add the easing name after it.\nFor example check out line 80 in slides.js, change to this:\n},option.slideSpeed,function(){\nTo this:\n},option.slideSpeed,'easeInOutQuad',function(){\nAnd that'll add easing to the slider.\n. Yeah slide speed only shows up twice.\nIf you want you can just take the uncompressed code and run it through http://fmarcia.info/jsmin/test.html to get the min version.\nGlad that worked for you.\n. Do you have a URL you could sen me?\n. And here's an example of Slides working in WP http://www.makeupgeek.com/\n. When using z-index you also have to use a position attribute. So on line 28 of your CSS #navigation also needs position:relative;\n. Yeah that sounds like a bug. I'll check it out and make an update. Thanks.\n. That's fixed in the latest version. Thanks!\n. For sure it'd be possible with a little jQuery.\nOne thing to note is that Slides won't slide past multiple images as a feature.\n. Hey Jan, looks like you have margin: 0 auto; applied to everything. I think that is what's causing that issue.\nJust remove or change following on line 1 style.css.\n* {\n    margin: 0 auto;\n}\n. Yeah that's not possible within jQuery its self. Because the element that you're trying to attach Slides to is display:none; jQuery thinks that div and everything with in it dosen't exists.\nA way around that is to use visibility:hidden; but that can cause some other issues.\n. I just fixed some bugs having to do with auto height. Download the latest version and let me know if that fixes the issue.\n. No worries man!\n. Both are fixed now. Thanks for that!\n. Give this a try. Make the images block level.\n.slides_control img {\n    display:block;\n}\n. Just made a test site and got it working:\nhttp://nathansearles.com/plugin/slides/test/\nDoes that work for you?\nMaybe one thing I should do is remove that animate to height on load.\n. Awesome man! Glad that worked. Hit me up if you need anymore help. \n. Just added that example to the download. Just download the latest and it'll be in the examples folder.\n. One thing you can do is fake a click on a pagination link.\nFor example:\n$('#example').click(function(){\n    $('.pagination a[rel=\"3\"]').click();\n});\nIn that example clicking an element with an ID of example with result in a click of a pagination link with a rel of 3 which will goto slide 4. Because JavaScript is creating and using the rel's in those links, 0 = 1. So just subtract 1 from whichever slide you want it to goto.\nHope that helps.\n. I just added the ability to link to a slide from a URL. Download the latest version and check out \"Linking\" within the examples folder. Let me know if you have questions.\n. Add list-style: none; to .pagination li in your css and that'll fix it.\n. Yeah that's a good call. Just added that to the latest version.\nThis is how to use it:\nanimationComplete: function(current){\n    // Current returns current slide number\n    console.log(current);\n}\nCheck out \"/examples/Images with titles/\" in the download for an example.\n. Yeah I'll have to look into adding deep linking. Love what you're doing though. I would like to find an easier way to link to a specific slide like from a hash. I'll have to mess around with that. Thanks for sharing this.\n. I just added slide-to-slide linking and deeplink. Download the latest and check out \"Linking\" within the examples folder. Let me know if that works out for you.\n. Good call Michael. I just added that to version 1.1.4 that'll be up a in a few. Thanks for the suggestion.\n. Yeah good call. That's been changed in the latest version. Thanks!\n. You don't need global.css for the slider to work it's just an example of how it could be styled.\nHere's an example of a simplified CSS. Again you don't need any of this for the slider to work.\n```\nslides {\nposition:relative;\n\n}\nslides .next,#slides .prev {\nposition:absolute;\ntop:107px;\nleft:-39px;\nwidth:24px;\nheight:43px;\ndisplay:block;\nz-index:101;\n\n}\n.slides_container {\n    width:570px;\n    height:270px;\n    overflow:hidden;\n    position:relative;\n}\nslides .next {\nleft:585px;\n\n}\n.pagination {\n    margin:26px 0 0;\n}\n.pagination li {\n    float:left;\n    margin:0 1px;\n}\n.pagination li a {\n    display:block;\n}\n```\n. Slides.min.jquery.js doesn't exists on the server. \nLooks like it should be in the /js/ folder. http://fattoad.co.uk/js/slides.min.jquery.js.\nMake sure that file is there then it should work.\n. If you goto the the URL you link to http://fattoad.co.uk/js/slides.min.jquery.js the file dosen't load so there is still something up. Not sure if the file name is just slightly off or if there is an issue with your server.\nBut it appears this file still dosen't exists. http://fattoad.co.uk/js/slides.min.jquery.js\n. Awesome. Glad that helped. Let me know if that all made sense with that example.\n. Do you have an example of what you're working on that you can send me?\n. Yeah I see what you're saying IE6/7 is messing things up for sure. I see what's causing the issue it'll take some time to test some things out. Look for a new version this evening.\nThanks!\n. This issue is now fixed in the latest version. Thanks for reporting it. Let me know if you have any other issues.\n. Cool thanks, I'll check it out.\n. Try updating ul.pagination li a with padding: 12px 0 0 0; looks like there is some padding be inherited.\nAnd because the styles are all inline, the current state won't work. Can you have the styles not be inline?\n. First thing is you're loading 2 different versions of jQuery, 1.4.4 and 1.4.2 that'll mess some things up.\nSecond thing is the markup structure you're using is incorrect for Slides. Match the following.\n<div id=\"slides\">\n    <div class=\"slides_container\">\n        <div>\n            <p>Slide One</p>\n            <p>Slide Two</p>\n            <p>Slide Three</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"prev\">Previous</a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"next\">Next</a>\n</div>\nThat should hopefully fix the issues you're seeing.\n. That code I provided is just the basic HTML structure needed for Slides to work.\nYou'll need a container DIV with an ID that can be \"slides\". Next inside the main container div you'll need another DIV with a class of \"slides_container\". Then with in that put your slide divs.\nSo you'll end up with something like:\n<div id=\"slides\">\n    <div class=\"slides_container\">\n        <div>Slide One</div>\n        <div>Slide Two</div>\n        <div>Slide Three</div>\n    </div>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"prev\">Previous</a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"next\">Next</a>\n</div>\nAnd sorry the HTML I provided in the earlier example was incorrect, typing to fast, but this is correct.\n. Yeah it works great in WP here's an example: http://www.makeupgeek.com/\nAlso there is a WP Plugin that's been developed: https://github.com/sico/Slides-for-Wordpress\nCan you send me a link of what you're working on?\n. Sweet, so you got it all working?\n. For sure good call. I'll add that in there. Glad you're diggin' it.\n. This issue have been fixed in the latest version 1.1.0.\n. Closing this issue. The CSS provided with Slides is just for example purposes. The intent is that the slideshow is styled accordingly to the site that it's being used on.\nPlease view the Simple example included in the download. You may also view this example online http://slidesjs.com/examples/simple/ this example is ment to show the most basic and unstyled version of Slides for easier design.\n. Something has to be wrong. Have an example?\nAnd yes you can have multiple sliders on one page. Each should have it's own ID.\n. It'd be rad if you had an example of the bug you're seeing and I bet I could add a fix for it. Thanks!\n. Looks like there is 2 empty \"div.slides\" in there. Are you using a CMS that's auto generating that code?\n. You'll need to add slides2 and slides3 to:\n$('#slides,#slides2,#slides3').slides({\n    preload: true,\n    preloadImage: 'img/loading.gif',\n    generatePagination: true,\n    play: 0,\n    pause: 2500,\n    hoverPause: true,\n    // Get the starting slide\n    start: startSlide,\n    animationComplete: function(current){\n        // Set the slide number as a hash\n        window.location.hash = '#' + current;\n    }\n});\n. I can not reproduce this issue. Please provide a URL to an example and I can take a look.\n. PNG fixes are a mess. If IE6 support is required I'll usually just swap PNGs for GIFs. You can do that with a little jQuery or using something like http://rafael.adm.br/css_browser_selector/.\n. Tested what you have there and works fine using the /examples/Linking example in the download.\nDoes \"#products\" exist on the page?\n. What I'd do for that is wrap each image in a div:\n<div class=\"slide\">\n    <img src=\"galleries/cultural/A.jpg\" width=\"450\" height=\"300\" />\n</div>\nThen in your CSS:\n```\n.slides_container .slide {\n    width: 450px;\n    height: 450px;\n    position: relative;\n}\n.slides_container .slide img {\n    position: absolute;\n    bottom: 0;\n    right: 0;\n}\n```\nThat should do the trick.\n. Awesome!\n. Just tweak the position in the CSS for .caption and tweak the following within that example's index.html\nanimationStart: function(){\n                $('.caption').animate({\n                    bottom:-35\n                },100);\n            },\n            animationComplete: function(current){\n                $('.caption').animate({\n                    bottom:0\n                },200);\n                if (window.console && console.log) {\n                    // example return of current slide number\n                    console.log(current);\n                };\n            }\nJust change 'bottom' to left or right and give a number for the position you'd want it to animate from/to.\n. In the CSS you'll also have to change left:0; to right:0; and bottom to 0.\nTry this:\n.caption {\n    z-index:500;\n    position:absolute;\n    bottom:0;\n    right:0;\n    height:30px;\n    padding:5px 20px 0 20px;\n    background:#000;\n    background:rgba(0,0,0,.5);\n    width:540px;\n    font-size:1.3em;\n    line-height:1.33;\n    color:#fff;\n    border-top:1px solid #000;\n    text-shadow:none;\n}\n. Change this:\n$(function(){\n    $('#web_slides').slides({\n        preload: true,\n        preloadImage: 'img/loading.gif',\n        play: 5000,\n        pause: 0,\n        hoverPause: true\n    });\n});\n$(function(){\n    $('#mobile_slides').slides({\n        preload: true,\n        preloadImage: 'img/loading.gif',\n        play: 5000,\n        pause: 2500,\n        hoverPause: true\n    });\n});\n$(function(){\n    $('#brand_slides').slides({\n        preload: true,\n        preloadImage: 'img/loading.gif',\n        play: 5000,\n        pause: 2500,\n        hoverPause: true\n    });\n});\nTo this:\n```\n$(function(){\n    $('#web_slides').slides({\n        preload: true,\n        preloadImage: 'img/loading.gif',\n        play: 5000,\n        pause: 0,\n        hoverPause: true\n    });\n$('#mobile_slides').slides({\n    preload: true,\n    preloadImage: 'img/loading.gif',\n    play: 5000,\n    pause: 2500,\n    hoverPause: true\n});\n\n$('#brand_slides').slides({\n    preload: true,\n    preloadImage: 'img/loading.gif',\n    play: 5000,\n    pause: 2500,\n    hoverPause: true\n});\n\n});\n```\nThe $(function(){}); is just a short hand version of $(document).ready(function() {}); and you only need to declare it once.\n. Slides fundamentally isn't built to do such a thing. But it is an interesting concept. I'll have to play around with adding something like that as a feature. Thanks!\n. It is possible to do this. Just find a lightbox plugin you'd like to use. Have it initialize after Slides has. It'll just take some testing and understanding how jQuery and plugins work.\n. If you can just send me a URL of what you're working on and I can take a look.\n. You can easily do this with the animationComplete option. Check out this example of its usage: http://slidesjs.com/examples/linking/\nWith that you can get the current slide number and show something else anywhere on the page.\n```\nanimationComplete: function(current){\n    /\n        Fade out the currently show caption\n        Remove class of current\n    / \n    $('#captions div.current').fadeOut(function(){\n        $(this).removeClass('current');\n    });\n/*\n    Fade in caption that is related to the current slide\n    This caption would have a class=\"caption_3\" for example for slide 3\n    The 'current' is variable passed in from Slides\n*/\n$('#captions .caption_' + current).fadeIn(function(){\n    $(this).addClass('current');\n})\n\n}\n```\nHope that helps.\n. Just take a little jQuery knowhow and a lightbox plugin you'd like to use.\n. The width of .slides_control is 3 x the width of your slides. So it's just a matter of setting the width of your slides appropriately.\nSo something like:\n.slides_control div {\n    width:500px\n}\n. Have an example URL you can send me?\n. Communicating via email\n. View the Linking example included in the download. I also have it up here: http://slidesjs.com/examples/linking/\nIn that example I use the animationComplete option and pass the current slide number to it. You should be able to use that to do what you describe.\n. Once you get something online shoot me the URL and I can take a look.\n. The IE7 issue had been resolved in the latest version 1.1.0.\n. Not sure what version was including with your WooTheme, but make sure you're using version 1.0.9. That should fix that issue.\n. Ha, it's probably your computer processing the sliding.\n. Make sure you're using both position and z-index on the container for your slideshow and your fixed elements. Just set one higher then the other. All child elements will then z-index with in their parent containers.\n```\nelement {\nposition:relative;\nz-index:100;\n\n}\n```\nHope that helps.\n. Check out the linking example in the download. You can also view it here: http://slidesjs.com/examples/linking/\nThat should get you in the right direction.\n. From what you're describing sounds to me that you can just put all 15 slides in the slideshow and it'll do what you're intending.\nOr if you're trying to create a \"carousel\" you could just put multiple items in each slide to create a set.\n. Not sure what you're asking, can you clarify? \n. Yeah sure there is a way. You'd be better off using JSON vs. XML. You can use jQuery's getJSON function http://jqapi.com/#p=jQuery.getJSON.\nThen in the callback, when everything is loaded, you can initialize Slides.\n. You could do that by taking the \"position\" and \"direction\" variables from \"next\" and swapping with \"prev\" in the \"animate\" function.\n. With SlidesJS 2 you can do this.\nCheck out the \"direction\" option:\ndirection: \"left\", // [String] Define the slide direction: \"Up\", \"Right\", \"Down\", \"left\"\n. Yep it's on the list, it's a matter of when I can find some time to add it.\nThanks!\n. There isn't an example of that but it's just a matter of writing some css to achieve that.\n. Fixed in version 1.1.1. It's now required that you provide a width and height for your slideshow.\n$(function(){\n    $('#slides').slides({\n        width: 570,\n        height: 270\n    });\n});\n. Check out http://slidesjs.com/ on there I state all the options you can use and how to use them. For your case you'd want to do something like:\n<script>\n    $(function(){\n      $(\"#slides\").slides({\n        play: 5000,\n        pause: 2500,\n        effect: 'fade'\n      });\n    });\n</script>\nAdd that to the head of you HTML, after you load jQuery and slides.jquery.js.\nHope that helps.\nNathan\n. This could still use some tweaking, but your basic JSON call to append images within Slides would like something like:\n$.getJSON(\"http://www.panoramio.com/map/get_panoramas.php?set=52440&from=0&to=20&minx=-180&miny=-90&maxx=180&maxy=90&size=medium&callback=?\",\n        function(data) {\n            $.each(data.photos, function(i, photo) {\n                $('<a/>', {\n                    href: photo.photo_url,\n                    html: $('<img/>', {\n                        src: photo.photo_file_url,\n                        alt: photo.photo_title\n                    })\n                }).appendTo('#slides .slides_container');\n            });\n            $('#slides').slides({\n                preload: false,\n                preloadImage: 'img/loading.gif',\n                play: 5000,\n                pause: 2500,\n                hoverPause: true\n            });\n        });\n. Nope. Slides isn't built in the traditional timeline style that most slideshows are based on.\n. Putting Flash inside of something that animates is not recommend. You'll get some funky results especially with slower browsers like IE. But you could do it with http://flowplayer.org/ and call a stop function on Slides' animationComplete function.\n. Yep, set hoverPause to true.\n$(function(){\n  $(\"#slides\").slides({\n    hoverPause: true\n  });\n});\n. Currently there is not, but that's going into the next version.\n. It could be done. You'd have to have a moderate understanding of jQuery and edit the plugin.\n. Awesome thanks for the suggestions. I'll make some tweaks to CSS.\n. Yeah you should only see the hash show up in the Linking example, and you can remove \"window.location.hash\" and that'll no longer change the hash to your current slide number.\n. Fixed in version 1.1.1. It's now required that you provide a width and height for your slideshow.\n$(function(){\n    $('#slides').slides({\n        width: 570,\n        height: 270\n    });\n});\n. Currently there isn't a way to do that. The randomize function randomizes every slide.\n. You could set the images to display none in your CSS.\n```\nslides img {\ndisplay:none;\n\n}\n```\n. Thanks! I'll look into it.\n. Thanks for letting me, I'll look into a fix for this.\n. It could be possible but would take some tweaking of the JavaScript to achieve it. Not sure what your JS expertise is but it'd require mid to advanced skill to make that happen.\n. Yeah looks like a bug in jQuery. Thanks for pointing it out.\n. this is fixed in version 1.1.4\n. Make sure you're using the latest version. Tested it with version 1.1.3 and it's working as it should.\nSounds like there could be something else going on. Make sure you don't have any end HTML tags that don't need to be there and that you have the CSS properly setup, view this example for the basic CSS needed. http://slidesjs.com/examples/simple/\n. Damn, probably not anytime soon. It'd take a decent re-write to do something like that.\nThanks!\n. Add this to your CSS:\n.slides_container img {\n    width:517px;\n    height:337px;\n    display:block;\n}\nWhat's happening is Slides needs the width and height of your slides, in this case you're using images as slides. So in the CSS you need to set the width and height. Also the slide needs to be block level and since images are not block level by default you'll state that in the CSS.\nThanks for the URL!\n. That's currently not possible, but it is something that I'll look into adding.\n. Not likely to happen soon. It'll take a rewrite of the plugin to get that feature integrated. Sorry about that.\n. That'll depend what browser you're viewing it in, each acts a little differently in that case.\nWhat you could do is an external interface call on animationStart() to pause the Flash animation. That is if Flash is listening for that external interface call.\n. Awesome. thanks Adam! I'll get that integrated in to the next version. Appreciate it!\n. There isn't a super easy way to have 2 paginations. But you could do a fake click on the main pagination from another set of links.\nSay you have an anchor with a class of link somewhere on the page:\n<a href=\"#2\" class=\"link\">Link 2</a>\nUsing that we can fake a click on the 2nd item in the main pagination, thus causing the slideshow to animate to the 2nd slide.\n```\n$('.link').click(function(){\n    /\n        Let's get the slide number we want to goto\n        by using what's in the \"href\" of the link that was clicked\n        and we'll want to remove the hash.\n    /\n    var link = $(this).attr('href').replace('#','');\n    /\n        So now the variable \"link\" will give us\n        2 or whatever we put in the href.\n    /\n    /\n        Here's where the fake click happens.\n        We'll find the li with the anchor that\n        we want clicked using the selctor \":eq()\",\n        that selector is zero based so 0 = 1, so\n        that's why I do (link - 1). Since we're putting\n        a varible into a string we'll have to use a + operator\n        to concatenate it all together.\n    /\n    $('#slides .pagination li:eq(' + (link - 1) + ') a').click();\n// this just prevents default click behavior\nreturn false;\n\n});\n```\nHope that helps.\n. Hey Felix, just make sure you don't have the \"pause\" option set and Slides will stop a auto playing slideshow on click of next/prev and pagination.\n. Check out the Linking example you can find on the Slides site and also in the download.\nhttp://slidesjs.com/examples/linking/#4\n. That'll work unless you have multiple slideshows on one page.\nWhat you can try is the following.\nSay you have some links:\n<a href=\"#1\" class=\"link\">Slide 1</a>\n<a href=\"#2\" class=\"link\">Slide 2</a>\n<a href=\"#3\" class=\"link\">Slide 3</a>\nYou can do something like this in jQuery:\n```\n$('.link').click(function(){\n    /\n        Let's get the slide number we want to goto\n        by using what's in the \"href\" of the link that was clicked\n        and we'll want to remove the hash.\n    /\n    var link = $(this).attr('href').replace('#','');\n    /\n        So now the variable \"link\" will give us\n        either 1, 2, 3 or whatever we put in the href.\n    /\n    /\n        Here's where the fake click happens.\n        We'll find the li with the anchor that\n        we want clicked using the selctor \":eq()\",\n        that selector is zero based so 0 = 1, so\n        that's why I do (link - 1). Since we're putting\n        a varible into a string we'll have to use a + operator\n        to concatenate it all together.\n    /\n    $('#slides .pagination li:eq(' + (link - 1) + ') a').click();\n// this just prevents default click behavior\nreturn false;\n\n});\n```\nSo with that when you click say this link \"Slide 3\" jQuery will then click the pagination link 3 and then the slideshow will goto slide number 3.\nHere's some more info about the :eq() selector: http://jqapi.com/#p=eq-selector\n. I'm not seeing that in Chrome. I may be adding a onSlidesLoad function to the options to the next version with that you could show the caption once everything is loaded.\n. Just added a slidesLoaded option to version 1.1.5 and updated the images with captions example with how to use it.\n. It's not built to do that, but could be added if you have some JS knowledge.\n. Yeah that's a good call, I'll look into it. Thanks!\n. Give this a try.\nSay you have some links:\n<a href=\"#1\" class=\"link\">Slide 1</a>\n<a href=\"#2\" class=\"link\">Slide 2</a>\n<a href=\"#3\" class=\"link\">Slide 3</a>\nYou can do something like this in jQuery:\n```\n$('.link').click(function(){\n    /\n        Let's get the slide number we want to goto\n        by using what's in the \"href\" of the link that was clicked\n        and we'll want to remove the hash.\n    /\n    var link = $(this).attr('href').replace('#','');\n    /\n        So now the variable \"link\" will give us\n        either 1, 2, 3 or whatever we put in the href.\n    /\n    /\n        Here's where the fake click happens.\n        We'll find the li with the anchor that\n        we want clicked using the selctor \":eq()\",\n        that selector is zero based so 0 = 1, so\n        that's why I do (link - 1). Since we're putting\n        a varible into a string we'll have to use a + operator\n        to concatenate it all together.\n    /\n    $('#slides .pagination li:eq(' + (link - 1) + ') a').click();\n// this just prevents default click behavior\nreturn false;\n\n});\n```\nSo with that when you click say this link \"Slide 3\" jQuery will then click the pagination link 3 and then the slideshow will goto slide number 3.\nHere's some more info about the :eq() selector: http://jqapi.com/#p=eq-selector\n. this will be added to the next release. Thanks!\n. Currently that's not supported but I'm looking into adding that to a future release.\nThanks!\n. Yes, dannyboy0 is correct. IE dosen't support rgba() which is used for the caption background. The example you are talking about is just that an example of what can be done. But it's up to you the developer to build it to your specifications.\n. You could modify the plugin and add something like:\n$('.stop').click(function(){\n    stop();\n});\nThat'll bind a click event to a link with a class of stop. When clicked it'll stop the slideshow. But won't work if you're using multiple slideshows on one page.\n. Dig the thinking. I'll have to looking into adding something like this in a feature release. Thanks!\n. Thanks again dannyboy0!\n. What you could do is swap the next and previous buttons using css positioning. That'll work if you're not using a pagination.\n. For sure there is.Using this example http://slidesjs.com/examples/standard/ you can use absolute positioning to position the pagination above slideshow using something like this.\n.pagination {\n    width: 100px;\n    position: absolute;\n    top: -35px;\n    left: 225px;\n}\n. Make sure you load your CSS before SlidesJS and that'll fix that issue.\n. Labeled as a bug, I'll get that fixed. Thanks!\n. It can be done. Just load your images with ajax or a getJSON call and then bind SlidesJS as usual.\n. Check out the Combining custom options section at the bottom of the SlidesJS site. http://slidesjs.com/#combining\n. Currently there isn't a way to do that but I'm looking into adding that into a future release.\n. You can use the start option for that. \nReview that on the Slides site:\nhttp://slidesjs.com/#start\n. Not by default but it'd be pretty damn easy to do something like that.\nYou could use \"location.hash\" to get the hash i.e. \"#something\" and set the start slide to what ever you like.\nHere's an example of that.\n```\nvar startSlide = 1;\nif (location.hash == \"#something\") {\n    startSlide = 3;\n}\n// Initialize Slides\n$('#slides').slides({\n    start: startSlide\n});\n```\n. It's not something that you could do by default but that's not saying it can't be done. It'd take a solid understanding of jQuery and the Slides plugin to get it to work.\n. Sounds like you need to check out jQuery's toggleClass() http://jqapi.com/#p=toggleClass\n. I'm working on a new version of Slides that'll have an update method. So say you dynamically add 3 slides to the slideshow, you can run the update method and that'll recalculate and update the slideshow. My goal is to have this out by the end of May.\n. Just use a slide div with an image and some text in it and set autoHeight to true. http://slidesjs.com/#autoheight\n. For that I'd create an array with the names you want to use then reference the array when updating the hash.\nSo something like this:\nanimationComplete: function(current){\n    var currentSlide = [\n    'something1',\n    'something2',\n    'something3',\n    'something4'\n    ];\n    window.location.hash = '#' + currentSlide[(current - 1)];\n}\nI'm doing \"current - 1\" because \"current\" starts at 1 and an array starts at 0.\nHope that helps.\n. Good call, I added a line to http://slidesjs.com/ about that. Did you get it working with 1.4.2? I had to get it working with 1.3.2 the other day because of a Drupal install. I have to look up what needed to be changed.\n. Yep, set bigTarget to false. Check out the 'bigTaret' option on http://slidesjs.com/#bigtarget for an example of how to implement.\n. Thanks man! I'll get that added to the project.\n. Ha, no worries. I pulled that out. Thanks man!\n. Sounds like there is something else going on there unrelated to Slides. Have a link?\n. How about a screenshot of the the lightbox effect you're talking about?\nSent from my iPhone\nOn Apr 21, 2011, at 8:07 PM, bigjoe92186reply@reply.github.com wrote:\n\nThanks for your quick response!

Try adding this to your css:\n\na img {\n    border: 0;\n}\n. Killer! Glad you got it figured out.\n. For sure. I'm working on adding the ability to do this to the next version. Thanks!\n. Yeah that makes sense. I'll have to put in a check for that. Thanks for pointing it out.\n. Just set generateNextPrev: false, it is by default, and use the following markup after \"slides_container\" and you can use what ever you like.\n<a href=\"#\" class=\"prev\">Older</a>\n<a href=\"#\" class=\"next\">Newer</a>\nReally just needs to have a class of prev and next and be within your main slideshow div, for example with in the div#slides.\n. Thanks for the help jeduan! Really appreciate it.\n. Do the examples on http://slidesjs.com/ work for you in IE6? If so I'd double check your implementation.\n. Thanks for this. Although it's not a feature I'll be including.\n. Thanks again jeduan!\n. Thanks @jeduan!\n. Hey man, the way it's setup now you'd have to have DIVs for each slide you want and then dynamically load slide content using animationComplete().\nIn my rewrite of Slides I'm adding a update method that'll easily allow you to dynamically add content.\n. Hopefully I'll have it out in 3 weeks.\n. Currently there isn't a way to do that, but my next down time I'm going to work on adding some public methods that would allow for that. Cheers!\n. IE dosen't support opacity in CSS so remove:\nbackground: rgba(0, 0, 0, .5);\nList items by default have bullets and margin so you have to turn that off:\nul.pagination {\n    list-style: none;\n    margin:0;\n}\nHope that helps\n. Here's what you could do. Add this html within your #slides div:\n<p id=\"slide_count\"><span class=\"current\">1</span> of <span class=\"total\"></span></p>\nThan add slidesLoaded and animationComplete options to the init code:\n$('#slides').slides({\n    preload: true,\n    preloadImage: 'img/loading.gif',\n    play: 5000,\n    pause: 2500,\n    hoverPause: true,\n    slidesLoaded: function() {\n        $('#slide_count .total').text( $('.slides_control').children().length );\n    },\n    animationComplete: function( current ) {\n        $('#slide_count .current').text( current );\n    }\n});\nAnd that'll do the trick. Here's a live example of that: http://slidesjs.com/examples/current-count/\n. There must be something else going on, cause that works fine. And the line you pointed out just gets the hash which is the \"#2\" in this example mydomainname.com/#2 so that defines the startSlide as 2.\n. That's fixed now in the latest version 1.1.8. Thanks!\n. This sounds like a browser level issue, not anything to do with JavaScript on the page.\n. Do you have an example? Hash change isn't built into SlideJS, but is something that could have been added. If it's a hash change issue it's still a browser issue having todo with the hash changes.\n. That could be done with a little jQuery knowhow separate from the plug-in.\n. Works as expected for me. I'd email WooThemes about it. Seems there is a few loading issue with that theme in iOS, my guess is it's timing issues within the theme.\n. Yes this can be done.\n. There are many factors that can come into play here. I'd look into centering UL LI elements.\n. You can easily position the next/prev links whereever you want using CSS.\n. Awesome. Thanks for pointing this out.\n. You could do this with a setTimeout() wrapped around the $('#elem').slides().\n. You need to provide links to your examples.\n. Don't seem to be using http://slidesjs.com on your site.\n. The ability to do that and more is coming very soon with SlidesJS 2. Hope to have a beta out by the end of the week.\n. Thanks for this. Could the issue be that you're on the first slide when invoking $(\"#slides\").slides(\"slide\",1)? I do see that bug. If you call the slide method and it's the same as your current slide it fails.\n. That's fixed now. Plus you reminded me to add error correction so someone can't enter a number less then 1 or a number greater then the total slides.\nThanks for this, really appreciate it!\n. Create your content dynamically from the XML then initialize Slides after all the slide content has loaded. Do you have a callback you could initialize Slides within?\n. Yes this will be really easy to do with SlidesJS 2. On animationComplete you can just check if current is 1 using $(elem).slides(\"status\",\"current\") and then stop the auto play with $(elem).slides(\"stop\").\nTurns out I forgot to add the auto play to the onload of Slides, so the only way to auto play at load right now is to do something like:\n$(elem).slides({\n    loaded: function() {\n        $(this).slides(\"play\");\n    }\n});\nBut I'll fix this in the next update. Thanks guys!\n. That's a good call.\nThis functionality has been rewritten in the next version of Slides so it won't use that same cache buster.\nThanks!\n. If you're trying to use Slides within Fancybox you have to initialize Slides when the Fancybox lightbox is created on the page. \nCheck out Fancybox's callback example on their site http://fancybox.net/ \nYou have Slides initialize on page load but the content for the slideshow isn't there until a lightbox is created. Once the lightbox is created then you can initialize Slides.\nHope that helps.\n. Sounds like an issues with your CSS, check that out and that'll fix the issue.\n. If you're using SlidesJS 2 and set responsive to true you can use .\nCheck out http://beta.slidesjs.com/examples/responsive/ for an example.\n. You can also use your own pagination with it's own links. Just have to set \"pagination\" to \"false\" in the options and create a pagination using a UL with a class of \"slidesPagination\" with LIs and anchor tags with what ever text or images you like. Use Firebug to copy the pagination Slides creates and paste it into your markup and edit away. \n. Yeah that'd be something good for the \"status\" option I'm adding to Slides 2.0. Right now it just returns the current slide number, the slideshows state and total slides, but previous slide would be a good idea as well.\nThanks!\n. Yeah that sounds kinda funky, wish I could reproduce it.\nSo it seems like the pagination is getting pushed down off the screen?\n. Glad you got it working. Sounds like you could have found a bug with Chrome.\n. Have an example of what you're working on? Sounds like you might not have the slide width and height set in the CSS.\n. Well as we know \"random\" isn't really random. You have 1/7 of chance of ending up on the same slide. Really that's pretty likely.\nIn an ideal scenario it'd store, using a cookie, html5 storage, or a hash, the last slide number and make sure that slide isn't displayed on refresh. Not something I'll have time to add anytime soon.\nYou could modify the randomizer to store the last slide and make sure that slide isn't displayed next.\n. This feature will be included in the next major release of Slides. You'll be able to slide left, right, up or down. You can download the beta of that here on GitHub.\n. Dosen't look like you're using Slides, but your image simply dosen't exist at the image source URL you're using.\n. I tested this out and couldn't reproduce the issues you're seeing. Something else must be going on. If you have any more info just let me know.\n. If you're using the beta 2.0+ you can use $(\"#slides\").slides(\"stop\") or $(\"#slides\").slides(\"play\"). This is a new feature and isn't supported in the current stable release version 1.1.8.\n. It sure can. I'd use jQuery.getJSON() to retrive the data then in the success callback create the markup and then initialize the Slides plugin.\nUnfortunately I don't have an example of this but the example that's on the jQuery site is great. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/\n. I haven't tested Slides out with jQuery Mobile. I'll assume you'll need jQuery along with it's mobile version to run Slides. There could be other issues besides that but I'm not sure.\nIf you're using Slides or anything that uses JavaScript for animation on a mobile device I'd check out this jQuery animation plugin because it uses CSS3 transitions rather then JavaScript for the animations. https://github.com/benbarnett/jQuery-Animate-Enhanced\n. I'm not planning on adding any additional effects right now, but I do like the idea of having separate effects plugins that could work with Slides. I'll have to mess around with that.\nThanks for the recommendation.\n. I tested out the settings you have and it worked as expected. So something else must be up.\nDo you have an example you can send me a link to?\n. Your file http://www.fixyourmix.com/hrapa/media/scripts/fancydropdown.js contains jQuery v1.3.2 that's what's causing the issue. Remove that version of jQuery from that file and it'll work.\n. Have an example you can send me?\n. Not surprising, thanks for letting me know.\n. I double checked and the minified version is complete in the zip. What text editor are you viewing it in? Some have issues displaying minified code because it's all on one line.\n. Check your source path for your images. Looks like that got changed or your images were removed from that path.\nUse Firebug or WebInspector to view the missing paths.\n. Yes that's possible. Check out the product demo for how to use a custom pagination: http://slidesjs.com/examples/product/\nYou just need a UL with a class of \"pagination\" with LIs and anchor tags within that.\n. Hey Matty, do you know of any sites that this is happening on that you could send me? Would love to check it out and see what's up. I have autoStart set on http://slidesjs.com and don't see any issue there but could be something else at play.\nThanks man!\n. It's possible and easier if you use JSON rather then RSS if possible. I'd use jQuery.getJSON() to retrive the data then in the success callback create the markup and then initialize the Slides plugin.\nUnfortunately I don't have an example of this but the example that's on the jQuery site is great. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/\n. That's definitely something that I've been looking into adding to Slides. That and CSS3 transitions for iOS devices.\n. Check out the linking example and I how I pass the current slide number. http://slidesjs.com/examples/linking/\nUsing the animationComplete callback which gets passed the current slide number from Slides you can capture that and display it on the page.\nWould look something like:\nanimationComplete: function(current){\n        $(\"#elem\").html(current);\n    }\n. Currently there isn't a built-in way to do this. I may look into adding this to SlidesJS 3 just depends on what other complexities it brings. SlidesJS originally intentent was to be a looping slideshow.\n. SlidesJS works fine with jQuery 1.8.x. And the version of jQuery you're referring to is 1.7.2, which also works fine with SlidesJS.\n. That'd be awesome! I am working on an all new version. So keep an eye out for that.\n. This is fixed in v3.0.2! Let me know how this update works for you. Cheers!\n. Might help if I updated my Firefox. :)\nThat's now fixed. Thanks!\n. Thanks for this! Which browser are you in?\n. Was it on the http://beta.slidesjs.com/ site? I've been trying to make that happen in Chrome but can't reproduce it.\nThanks man!\n. This should be fixed in the latest update. Give it a try and let me know if you're still seeing this happen. Thanks!\n. Heck yeah! Thanks for the help.\n. This should be fixed in the latest update. Give it a try: http://beta.slidesjs.com/\n. Yeah I've been thinking about doing some kind of click queue for a while. I'll give it a try!\n. I wrote this in there but it created other issues that need to be worked out first. It's still on my features list.\n. This issue is now resolved in SlidesJS beta 3.0.3a.\n. Yep!\n. This issue is now resolved. Grab the latest version SlidesJS beta 3.0.3a. Cheers!\n. For this check out the SlidesJS beta (http://beta.slidesjs.com/) which will be production ready very soon.\n. This issue has now been resolved. Just grab the latest version. 3.0.3a. Cheers!\n. Yeah, this is great input. I'll look into adding it. Thanks!\n. WebKit can do some really funky things when using CSS transitions. I've seen this and many other issues. Unfortunately these issues are apart of WebKits rendering.\n. Yeah that makes sense. I'll make CSS3 Transitions an option in the next update.\n. Awesome! Thanks for this. I'll have to get this over to the Coffee Script source and get it into the build. Cheers!\n. I just updated crossfade in version 3.0.3. Check it out http://slidesjs.com/examples/basic-fade/.\nAs for the image question, that's part of a larger issue. It'll be something I'll need to work on for slides with content and images. Which is on the top of my list to build an example of that and work on some fixes to the issues that come up.\n. You could just do something like this:\njavascript\n$(\"#slides img\").length\n. You should be able to use active set to false and effect set to \"slide\" or \"fade\". If not let me know and I'll fix that.\njavascript\n  $(\"#slides\").slidesjs({\n    navigation: {\n      active: false,\n      effect: \"slide\"\n    }\n  });\n. Thanks man!\n. There must be something else going on. SlidesJS 3 is compatible with jQuery 1.10+. I just retested it and everything appears to be working as expected. Is it possible that you're loading multiple versions of jQuery?\n. Unfortunately I no longer have the time to keep Slides up to date. As an alternative I'd check out http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/. It's what I've been using on recent projects.\n. ",

The slides.js script searches the entire page for elements with given class names for the next/prev buttons, pagination, etc... you can update the script and replace all such instances with a jQuery find instead. For example when slides.js tries to find the \"next\" button:\nIt does:   $('.' + option.next)\nIt should be doing:   $(this).find('.' + option.next)\nIf you get the un-minified version of the script this should only take you 5-10 minutes.\n. just a bump on this.

Thans for reply!\nYour recipe displays only numbers \nHow to capture current slide element like title or \u0441aption?\n. like this:\nanimationStart: function(current) {\n                $(this).parent().find('slides_banner').removeClass();\n                },\n                animationComplete: function(current){\n                    // Set the slide number as a hash\n                    window.location.hash = '#' + current;\n                    $(this).addClass('current_banner');\n                    $(\"#front_slides_banner\").html($('.current_banner').html());\n                },\n. function currentSlide( current ) {\n            $(\".current_slide\").text($(\"#slides\").slides($(\".caption\").html()));\n        }\n?\n. please make this function (displaying current slide title or caption in a separate element (like it is done with current slide number)) for slidesjs I think it may be useful not only for me, many thanks in advance\n. hi ! do you gave online example?\n. hi! this borders are in a site general style of list items not in slider stylesheet.\nin style.css file (begining from line 181) replace (border style properties):\nul li {\nborder-left: 1px solid white;\nborder-right: 1px solid white;\ndisplay: inline-block;\nfloat: right;\nheight: 50px;\nlist-style-type: none;\noverflow: hidden;\ntext-align: center;\n}\nto \nul li {\nborder: none;\ndisplay: inline-block;\nfloat: right;\nheight: 50px;\nlist-style-type: none;\noverflow: hidden;\ntext-align: center;\n}\nOR \njust add to slider stylesheet\n.pagination li {\nfloat:left;\nmargin:0 1px;\nlist-style:none;\n}\n.pagination li {\nfloat:left;\nmargin:0 1px;\nlist-style:none;\nborder: none;\n}\n. lol;)\n. The slides.js script searches the entire page for elements with given class names for the next/prev buttons, pagination, etc... you can update the script and replace all such instances with a jQuery find instead. For example when slides.js tries to find the \"next\" button:\nIt does:   $('.' + option.next)\nIt should be doing:   $(this).find('.' + option.next)\nIf you get the un-minified version of the script this should only take you 5-10 minutes.\n. just a bump on this. I have the same issue posted on the google group here:\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/slidesjs/browse_thread/thread/3492225b7ca1bc11/776d4d7bf471c8a4?lnk=gst&q=lyndonr#776d4d7bf471c8a4\nit's a little confusing where I should post? just trying to maximize my chances of getting some help. \nthanks!\n. ok, so I've moved to slides 2.0 beta 1 because there's a \"$(\"#slides\").slides(\"stop\");\" method call. so, how can I call \"stop\" on click in the pagination links before it executes the next command? theoretically this would kill the current slide animation and start in on whatever is being clicked.. thus making it possible to click quickly between slides with slow animation. \nthoughts?\n. I am having the same issue, only IE9. Not IE8. No ajax loading\n. ",

Here's an example:\n```\n//Enqueue a javascript file when not viewing site in admin interface\nif ( !is_admin() ) { \n    //this example loads in a script located in theme_directory/js/, is dependant on jQuery and will load into the footer\n    // if( is_front_page() ){\n        wp_enqueue_script(\"slidesJS\", get_bloginfo ('stylesheet_directory').\"/js/slides.jquery.js\", array(\"jquery\"), false, true);\n}\n``\n. By specifying thepaginationClassin the options and settinggeneratePaginationtofalse`, you can have 2 slideshows running with 2 different paginations. I just tested it, and it works great.\ngeneratePagination: false,\npaginationClass: 'pagination2'\nThanks for discovering this. Now I can place pagination in my wordpress sidebar\n. Thank you for the quick response. This solution is useful for certain situations. It seems that the default pagination needs to exist for the custom links to function. I suppose I could hide the default pagination using css.\nThe only thing left I would need to figure out is how to make the active link match up with the current slide, and have it switch when the slide switches.

    "drding00": "Hi Paul\nI know this issue is 6 months old but I thought I'd share what I worked out just today. I've been racking my brain trying to figure out how to change the pagination link text from 1, 2, 3... to anything else and this is what I figured out. \nI went by Nathan's \"Product\" example that comes with the installation files for Slides version 1.9\nIn that example he's got image thumbnails for the pagination and that helped me immensely. \nHere's my code: \n<div id=\"slides\">\n<div class=\"slides_container\">\n<div>\n<img src\"slide1.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"200\" />\n</div>\n<div>\n<img src\"slide2.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"200\" />\n</div>\n<div>\n<img src\"slide3.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"200\" />\n</div>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"pagination\">\n<li><a href=\"#\">Image One</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Image Two</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Image Three</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\nYou can leave the href as just a \"#\" and the script will fill the rest in for you. \nI noted that the custom pagination ul had to go before the closing div of the slider (in this case \"slides\") for it to recognize it. I haven't tested it if you put it before the closing div of \"slides_container\" for example, but I can at least say it works before the very last div. Instead of words of course you can use images as well, like thumbnails.\nYour css is however you want it to be, for example here's what I have going on:\n.pagination {\n    margin: 45px auto 0;\n    width:169px;\n    position: absolute;\n    top: -35px;\n    left: -35px;\n}\n.pagination li {\n    float:left;\n    margin: 2px 1px;\n    list-style: none;\n}\n.pagination li a {\n    display:block;\n    width:169px;\n    padding-top: 12px;\n    padding-left: 10px;\n    padding-bottom: 18px;\n    background-image:url(images/pagination.png);\n    background-repeat: no-repeat;\n    background-position: 0 0;\n    float:left;\n    overflow:hidden;\n    color: #ffffff;\n    text-decoration: none;\n}\n.pagination li.current a {\n    background-position:0 -50px;\n}\nHere I have a custom background image for the back of my links, etc. \nAnd then for the slider script I have this: \n<script>\n                $(function(){\n            // Initialize Slides\n            $('#slides').slides({\n                                effect: 'fade',\n                                generateNextPrev: false,\n                                generatePagination: false,\n                play: 5000,\n                pause: 2500,\n                hoverPause: true        \n            });\n        });\n    </script>\nNote the generatePagination: false,\nAnd that's pretty much it. I hope this helps folks looking to put a bit more customization in their sliders. And a huge thanks to Nathan for creating this awesome script, it's fantastic!\n.

If you're still willing to look at it for me you'll need to download & unzip it. The page I'm having trouble on is watchmegrow\\devcharts\\3to6months.htm. Thanks again!\nhttp://bit.ly/r765lO\n. It must be some sort of server issue with our development server. Your version on uglymongrel works, but when I make the changes on mine it doesn't work. I even tried copying your entire code & replacing mine with it but still no go. I may have to talk to our network guys.\n. Definitely our dev server. I put a copy of it on my hard drive & ran it from there & it worked perfectly! Thanks for all your help @arschmitz! It's greatly appreciated!\n. Already did that! Thanks again for your help!\n. It works on my local machine but not on our dev server. I've got a call in to our IT department to figure it out. But yes, it is working!\n. Check out this thread: https://github.com/nathansearles/Slides/issues/268. I was able to get it to work on my site: http://1.usa.gov/uiOWYy\n. ",
    "arschmitz": "This can be done with a minor change to the slides.js source\ntowards the bottom of the file you will see several click handling functions that look like:\njavascript\n$('a.link', elem ).click(function(){\n                // pause slideshow\n                if (option.play) {\n                     pause();\n                }\n                // get clicked, pass to animate function                    \n                clicked = $(this).attr('href').match('[^#/]+$');\n                // if current slide equals clicked, don't do anything\n                if (current != clicked) {\n                    animate('pagination', paginationEffect, clicked);\n                }\n                return false;\n            });\nafter the last one add a new one \njavascript\n$('a.outside_link').click(function(){\n                // pause slideshow\n                if (option.play) {\n                     pause();\n                }\n                // get clicked, pass to animate function                    \n                clicked = $(this).attr('href').match('[^#/]+$');\n                // if current slide equals clicked, don't do anything\n                if (current != clicked) {\n                    animate('pagination', paginationEffect, clicked);\n                }\n                return false;\n            });\nnow just make any link you want to go to a slide have the class outside_link and putt the slide hash ex #2 for slide 2 as the href. \nyou can see a working example at http://www.billdodgeautogroup.com/infiniti/pa_test.php\n@zanrok That is for slides V2 which is built on the jquery-ui widget factory and accepts a ton of new methods. V2 is not ready for production use yet however. Once it is it will solve this problem. Meanwhile the added function should do what you need. \n@rogue3 This is because it updates the url hash when you click your link normally however when you open in a new window it actually calls a new page with that hash slides checks for the hash when it starts to display the desired tab. but when you click your link all it does is change the url it does not reload the page. \n. @rogue3 can you post a link I can check what you posted looks ok but hard to tell with out seeing the rest\n. Also forgot to mention you must have generatePagination: true in your slides initialization. I realize that if your using links to the slides so you probably don't want pagination however it is required for this to work. You can hide the pagination if you want by assigning a paginationClass in the initialization then use css to set it to display:none; \nThis is how my example page functions. \n. @rogue3 your welcome and if you havent checked or tried already just make sure generatePagination is set true\n. perfect found your problem.\nwell actually there are 2.\nfirst in your initalization of slides even though you had generatePagination:true, pagination was not set this needs to be true as well. \nyour second problem is that the hash numbers in your links start at 1 and they should start at 0 \nyou can see a working version of your site at http://uglymongrel.com/watchmegrow/devcharts/3to6months.htm\n. @rogue3 down load my copy of slides.jquery.js there was an error in yours that i had fixed without realizing it you added the new function on the wrong side of some brackets. \n. @rogue3 so you got it working then?\n. Hi that is the minified version to do this fix you will need the normal version you can get this by clicking code at the top of the page then go into source you will see the only file is slides.js \n. Thats no problem. \njavascript\n    $('.'+option.outsideLink).click(function(){\n                // pause slideshow\n                if (option.play) {\n                pause();\n                }\n                // get clicked, pass to animate function\n                clicked = $(this).attr('href').match('[^#/]+$');\n                // if current slide equals clicked, don't do anything\n                if (current != clicked) {\n                animate('pagination', paginationEffect, clicked);\n                }\n                return false;\n            });\nadd this instead of the original function i provided.\nalso just below this you will see $.fn.slides.option = { then add a new option to the list outsideLink:'.outsideLink', now when you initialize your slide show you can set the option outsideLink to what ever class you want for that slide show. \n. Hi i checked your page and it appears to work fine to me. though i would recommend upgrading your version of slides you are using version .5.7 and the current version is 1.1.9 the version you are using isn't even actually slides its  loopedslider. but your slider works fine for me and when i click a product it goes to that page\n.

You will have to find the script source link (\"script src\") between the  tags of your website.  (I can't paste the exact link here, as github appears to remove it from comments.)\nIn your web page's \"head\" tag area,  find the Slide-specific \"script src\" which ends with \"... ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.5.1/jquery.min.js\" \nLeave everything the same, but change \"1.5.1\" to \"1.7.1\" to reflect the latest version of this particular Google API. \nThat worked for me. Hope it helps you.\n. Github deleted the word \"head\" above, because I had put it inside < > brackets. The first sentence above should say \"You will have to find the script source link (\"script src\") between the (head) tags of your site ...\n. OK, about 10 minutes after I posted the comment above, the main image in my Slide show (I was using \"Product\") disappeared again. I implemented the following steps to fix the problem:\n1. Go to the following link: code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.1.js \n   (I removed \"http\" etc. up to the \"//\" so GitHub wouldn't remove the link.) Copy the entire contents of this page and save it as \"jquery-1.7.1.js\" inside the \"js\" directory inside your particular version of slide. In other words, you'll locate it on your server inside Slide/Product/js/jquery-1.7.1.js\" \n2.  Then add the following script info to the head section of your website's page: \n   (Note, in the example below, I am using parentheses instead of brackets, so GitHub doesn't delete the script. Make sure you replace the parentheses ( ) with brackets < > when you insert the script into the head tag area of your webpage.

That should say \"Did you download the \"jquery-1.7.1.js\" ... etc.\n. Did you put it up on the server?\n. Please send me a screenshot of all the files you have on your server, if you can.\n.

In the downloaded version of this particular slideshow, the links are other slides: #4, #3, etc. If you want to link to an external pdf, simply take out class=\"link\".

This answer is to muborges. You don't need to apologize for your English. I'm sorry I don't speak Spanish. I want to see how your slideshow files are set up on your server.\nDo you have a link to your slideshow? Is is up on the internet somewhere? \n. Is that Portuguese then? My apologies. \nYour link shows me that the pagination (the dots) are not in the right place. (They are covering the slide main image container. The pagination should be under the slide.)

Dear Hillsboroughgraphics, \nPlease upload your page, with the corrections, so I can test your links. Which browser are you using?\n. Try setting pagination to \"false\" again. The slideshow appears to be treating the mouse click as a page advance.\n. HBG: I uploaded the slideshow with just the first link set to your case pdf and the link works with a normal mouse click (no right click required): http://www.pageshaper.com/Slides/examples/Linking/index.html\nThere is other script (possibly your navigation rollover?) which is throwing off how this slideshow link behaves.\nAs a possible workaround - until you get to the root of problem, you could add an \"onClick\" behavior to each link (minus < >):\na href=\"http://hillsboroughgraphics.com/trialstat/pdfs/cs-phase1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" onClick=\"MM_goToURL('parent','http://hillsboroughgraphics.com/trialstat/pdfs/cs-phase1.pdf');return document.MM_returnValue\" >View the entire case study</a\nYou would have to add the following snippet of code just inside the  in your head tag.\nfunction MM_goToURL() { //v3.0\n  var i, args=MM_goToURL.arguments; document.MM_returnValue = false;\n  for (i=0; i<(args.length-1); i+=2) eval(args[i]+\".location='\"+args[i+1]+\"'\");\n}\n. So glad I could help. I came to webdesign/development from an English / Fine Art background, if that's any consolation or motivation for you. (I did like math, however, and am drawn to the logic of computer languages. Being stubborn, or should I say \"persistent\" also helps.) There are so many tools online, without resorting to slogging through Javascript books. (Although that exercise can be very helpful, and I commend you for it.) Did you ever come across the following tool?\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-developer/\nThis is an add-on for the Firefox browser which, when installed, appears as a toolbar under your Firefox browser menu and lets you isolate and study various components of a web page. This is a remarkably good tool with which to peek \"under the hood\" of any website. You can disable and enable javascript, for example, hide images or find their paths, even edit CSS to see how/if/why your page elements are displaying the way they do. \nI've found the developer community is very generous with its information and am happy whenever I can pay forward all the good advice and help I've gotten from others over the years.\n. I think I found the problem. You don't need to insert the \"ul\" pagination list into the body of your page for this slideshow. \nHere is a link to a screenshot I made of the part you need to take out of your page.  Remove everything I have highlighted in green, then upload the page to the server. It should work now.\nPlease let me know if that solution fixed your problem.\n. The links sometimes disappear on here. Paste this next to \"http://\"\npageshaper.com/Slides/remove.png\n. I see the Google API  link has disappeared from the above post. Simply change 1.5.1. to 1.7.1. in your header's script source link.\n. You will have to find the script source link (\"script src\") between the  tags of your website.  (I can't paste the exact link here, as github appears to remove it from comments.)\nIn your web page's \"head\" tag area,  find the Slide-specific \"script src\" which ends with \"... ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.5.1/jquery.min.js\" \nLeave everything the same, but change \"1.5.1\" to \"1.7.1\" to reflect the latest version of this particular Google API. \nThat worked for me. Hope it helps you.\n. Github deleted the word \"head\" above, because I had put it inside < > brackets. The first sentence above should say \"You will have to find the script source link (\"script src\") between the (head) tags of your site ...\n. OK, about 10 minutes after I posted the comment above, the main image in my Slide show (I was using \"Product\") disappeared again. I implemented the following steps to fix the problem:\n1. Go to the following link: code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.1.js \n   (I removed \"http\" etc. up to the \"//\" so GitHub wouldn't remove the link.) Copy the entire contents of this page and save it as \"jquery-1.7.1.js\" inside the \"js\" directory inside your particular version of slide. In other words, you'll locate it on your server inside Slide/Product/js/jquery-1.7.1.js\" \n2.  Then add the following script info to the head section of your website's page: \n   (Note, in the example below, I am using parentheses instead of brackets, so GitHub doesn't delete the script. Make sure you replace the parentheses ( ) with brackets < > when you insert the script into the head tag area of your webpage.

Eh, sorry if you tried this and it didn't work.  I tested it out and didn't have much success with it.  Looks as though animationComplete fires after every slide so what I wrote above won't work for your case.\n. Just by taking a quick look at your site I can say this.  The preloadImage takes precedence over any other background image when the document is ready until the first slide gets loaded.  Reference line 342 in slides.jquery.js.  Therefore it is not possible to specify a background on the slides_container class or any child element and expect it to appear before the slides are loaded.  When the DOM is loaded the background is changed to the preloadImage you have set.  So do this instead - set the bg_fachada.jpg background image on a NEW div (example - #external_slides_container) that surrounds the slides and slides_container DIVs.

Great! Glad I could help.\n. I stand corrected.  I reviewed the documentation a little deeper.  Try this:\n$(\".pagination\").bind(\"mouseover\",function(){\n    $(\"#slides\").slides(\"pause\");\n});\n$(\".pagination\").bind(\"mouseout\",function(){\n    $(\"#slides\").slides(\"play\");\n});\nShould work as long as your pagination class is the default or called \"pagination\".  Hope this helps.\n. Try setting your LI's to display:block with CSS.  Might help.\n. Are you using autoplay?  If so, that will make a difference.  But there really isn't an easy way without adding some more JS code.  Thankfully, the script includes code to perform separate functions at the beginning and the end of the slideshow -- reference animationStart and animationComplete in the documentation.\nI would think something along the lines of this would work (although the following is untested):\n$(\".slides_container\").slides({\n      // Whatever other options you have set - such as preload, effect, slideSpeed, etc....\n      // Don't forget to add a comma after your last declaration before the following....\n      animationStart : function(){\n            if (current==0) { // current is declared in the slides.jquery.js file so it should be okay to reference here\n                  $(\".prev\").hide(); // assuming that you are using the class \"prev\" for your previous slide button\n            } else {\n                  $(\".prev, .next\").show(); // assuming that you are using the class \"next\" for your next slide button\n            }\n      }, // Another comma here!\n      animationComplete : function(){\n            $(\".next\").hide();\n            // Not sure the following will work as is - may have to include the other declarations\n            // so as not to deviate from the original functionality - i.e. animation, speed, etc.\n            $(\".slides_container\").slides({ play: -1; }); \n      }\n});\nHope this helps and feel free to contact me.\n. No problem. Hope it helps!\n. found something else you should do.  Put this just before the following\nvar current = console.log(current);\nif (current==0) { ...\n. Eh, sorry if you tried this and it didn't work.  I tested it out and didn't have much success with it.  Looks as though animationComplete fires after every slide so what I wrote above won't work for your case.\n. Just by taking a quick look at your site I can say this.  The preloadImage takes precedence over any other background image when the document is ready until the first slide gets loaded.  Reference line 342 in slides.jquery.js.  Therefore it is not possible to specify a background on the slides_container class or any child element and expect it to appear before the slides are loaded.  When the DOM is loaded the background is changed to the preloadImage you have set.  So do this instead - set the bg_fachada.jpg background image on a NEW div (example - #external_slides_container) that surrounds the slides and slides_container DIVs.  This way it will stay behind the slides_container and not get replaced by the preloadImage when the DOM is loaded.\nCSS\nexternal_slides_container {\nwidth:1211px;\nheight:637px;\ndisplay:block;\nmargin:0 auto;\nbackground: #E6E6E6 url('img/fotos/bg_fachada.jpg');\n}\n.slides_container div {\nwidth:1211px;\nheight:637px;\ndisplay:block;\nmargin:0 auto;\nbackground:transparent;\n}\nHTML\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHope this helps and gets you going in the right direction.\n.
