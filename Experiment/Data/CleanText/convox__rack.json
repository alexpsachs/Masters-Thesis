    "ddollar": "Looks good but would you please rebase against master. Sorry, things are moving fast today :)\n. Actually just had to change a Github setting that was preventing me from merging. Thanks!\n. :+1: with a few comments inline\n.  cli api command\n.  Better error when using an invalid service type\n.  Disallow deploys to an app that is not running\n.  App name validation\n.  List processes catching too much\n.  Use STS tokens for install\n. mind adding a few tests around this one? i've added a couple of other examples of cli tests for other commands\n. I would probably stub out the version-getter and mixpanel. You can create a VersionChecker variable that normally is the object from convox/release/version but can be set to a mock object during the tests.\n. Use pointers to return credentials so you can nil them\n. :+1:\n.  Apps scoped to a rack\n. Looking at testing this it seems like stubAws and friends are too abstracted. Tests should probably just have XML pairs embedded in the tests.\n.  Respond with a useful error if a run is attempted against a process that isn't defined\n.  Recreate app command\n. Can you put the install --development instructions in that section as well? Can move the whole section above convox start and call it Prerequisites\n. :+1:\n.  Build and deploy repo urls\n.  Speed up /apps/:app/processes\n.  Add service binary back\n.  Add MySQL service template\n. /cc @imbriaco \n.  Map ports without ELB\n. 20150923192531-internal-ports\n. Thanks!\n.  Automatic convox init\n. :+1: \n. :+1:\n.  make stack traces useful\n.  Add signup option to Rack installer\n.  CPU percentage is inaccurate\n. This reflects the same behavior AWS uses for Lambda.\n.  Allow building without cache\n. Solves #71 \n. Consider putting the app name in the URL for the POST as well.\n. Also please make sure to update api/manifest.yml to add the new routes.\n.  Service security groups\n.  Skip 2 more lines of backtrace in rollbar\n.  Tell users to use convox releases promote after updating environment\n.  Don\u2019t allow a user to scale beyond the capacity of their rack\n. If my app looks like this:\nweb:\n  ports:\n    - 80:3000\nWill this let me add a listener on 443 that passes through to my HTTP listener? This is going to be the 80% use case.\n. If you explicitly declare a 443:NNNN in your app it means you required to have your app terminate SSL for itself which increases the complexity of using this a great deal. While I agree that it's a good idea I don't think it should be a requirement.\n. How do you know whether to configure the load balancer to look for encrypted or unencrypted traffic on the container port?\n. If the app declares a 443 outside listener then I think it's fairly reasonable to assume that the listener on port 3000 is encrypted. The current behavior is a bit confusing to me and makes the docker-compose.yml confusing for an outside viewer. Why is this app listening on port 443 with HTTP?\nports:\n  - 443:3000\n. That breaks compatibility with docker-compose. While we may do that at some point we should do it carefully and for a good reason and I don't think we need to here.\n. It's more about confusion when looking at a project's docker-compose.yml. If you saw that it was exposing 443 you would not expect to find HTTP there.\n.  convox services info shows blank URL for Papertrail\n. @csquared with this you can change the second port of grid to 443 and HTTPS should work\n.  Default Rails Dockerfile should assets:precompile\n. :+1:\n. This probably fails if you convox build ../some/other/dir but OK for now.\n.  godep\n.  Remove CPU/Memory stats from convox ps by default\n.  Show both desired and actual process count in convox scale\n.  check only processes that have external ports when scaling rack\n.  convox scale shows desired/actual process counts\n.  block env set while creating\n. :+1:\n.  dont fail the system update if we cant determine concurrency\n.  use segment for rack event tracking\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks again :)\n.  move cli release over to new equinox\n. Test as 20151027150947-secure-ssl\n.  webhook service urls\n. Rebase of #145 \n. Thanks @cleblanc87!\n. :+1: \n. :+1:\n.  SSL Certificate Chain Option\n. Docs change is convox/convox.github.io#75\n. API endpoints are not declared in api/manifest.yml\n. Let's remove the \"pending\" API attribute and change \"running\" to \"processes\" there as well.\n. I second the map for config options here.\n. :+1:\n. Can we just kill the message after \"Promoting...\"\nThe endpoints still won't be accurate and we should find a better way to surface deploy status (Noah's work is a good step here)\n. looks good, though maybe consider using --private and Private and drop the resources noun\n. Merged in #251, thanks!\n. :+1:\n. :+1:\n. Do we need the other ecr: permissions as well?\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/ECR_on_ECS.html\n. Sounds good :)\n. Thanks!\n.  ecr\n. Yes, one deploy to turn it on. Next deploy (and all future) go to ECR.\n. :+1:\n. Merging #242 here\n. Really wish there were a rebase button here in Github for these\n. :+1:\n. Could we add some functionality to the .yml fixtures that map to changes in the CloudFormation .json that we could put under test?\n. :+1:\n.  one-off processes in convox ps\n. :+1:\n. You can try this with convox rack update 20160128212241-support-dockerfile\n. Thanks!\n. These are being covered in #318 thanks!\n. thanks!\n. 20160202210501-resilient-kernel\n.  prevent rack api downtime during rolling updates\n.  pending process list seems inaccurate\n.  use deployment options to roll kernel service with less overhead\n. :+1: Hopefully this should help quite a lot\n. This is rebased on top of describe-stacks-lock\n. Yep. #324 also includes this fix so going to close this PR. Thanks for the report :)\n.  support ecr-based private registries\n. Yes, so you can build from images in your own ECR repositories\n. Won't work in this case. We don't know which registries to log in to except inside the build shim. The build shim returns the manifest to rack but it's too late by then (already needed to build)\n. For local development they will need to manage ecr login themselves, same with docker hub \n. Yep that would be pretty great\nOn Thursday, February 11, 2016, Noah Zoschke notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nOk I see. I have one more question with this strategy. Does passing\nAWS_ACCESS and AWS_SECRET like this pose any security concerns? My general\nconcerns are that this might expose the secrets in the log, process table,\nand to untrusted things that can execute during the build.\nI do see another strategy where we put this into the Private Registries\nstuff: https://convox.com/docs/private-registries/\nWe could extend to support ECR, and prompt for IAM creds instead of a\nusername/password\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/convox/rack/pull/334#issuecomment-183001055.\n. :+1:\n. I like the idea of the repeatable hash. It is critically important, however, that existing ELBs do not get renamed.\n. let's ship as, we'll refactor later\n. :+1: on hashing the whole stack name\n. This looks great. Is there any advantage to having these numbers be parameters or do the logs on disk not really matter due to our log pipelines?\n. :+1:\n.  cf params get/set\n.  Builds not always seeing caches\n. ```\n$ convox rack update 20160219162421-autoscale-rack\n$ convox rack params set Autoscale=yes\n\n$ convox api get /system/capacity\n{\n  \"cluster-memory\": 6009,\n  \"instance-memory\": 2003,\n  \"process-count\": 8,\n  \"process-memory\": 2688,\n  \"process-width\": 2\n}\n``\n. :+1:\n. Let's use theformationParameters()` helper to strip out bad parameters rather than the manual blacklist and required release.\n. If the rack params stuff is now solid backwards/forwards probably worth making this a required release.\n. ## Release Playbook\n- [x] Rebase against master\n- [x] Pass checks\n- [x] Code review\n- [x] Release branch (20160223035816-compose-env)\n- [x] Pass CI ()\n- [x] Merge into master\n- [x] Release master\n- [x] Pass CI\n- [ ] Update dev and testing racks\n- [ ] If rack or app formation changes, test upgrade \u2192 re-deploy existing app \u2192 downgrade cycle\n- [ ] Publish release\n- [ ] Release CLI\n. ## Release Playbook\n- [x] Rebase against master\n- [ ] Pass checks\n- [ ] Code review\n- [ ] Release branch (20160223035816-compose-env)\n- [ ] Pass CI\n- [ ] Merge into master\n- [ ] Release master\n- [ ] Pass CI\n- [ ] Update dev and testing racks\n- [ ] If rack or app formation changes, test upgrade \u2192 re-deploy existing app \u2192 downgrade cycle\n- [ ] Publish release\n- [ ] Release CLI\n. Not sure if unit tests would have caught this but we definitely need to exercise SSL in CI.\n. This is a CLI-only release\n. @nzoschke just for clarity are you asking to block the PR on those tests?\n. the api path still exists so old clients will continue to use it\nthere's no cli flag or anything to toggle\nshould that become necessary it should be trivial to roll the cli back.. im a bit hesitant to proliferate more options, even temporary ones\n. Yep. All of the server side bits are still there. You could grab an older CLI release or we could quick-release a reversion to the CLI if that became necessary.\nThe version check stuff deserves more thought. We need something much lighter-weight.\nTough to implement because we don't have a release number yet for this. Will probably add a quick check to the top of convox build and convox deploy to check rack version before starting the whole process once we have a release number for this.\n. Actually once this has a release number I can just make it use the old client code path automatically if the rack version is too old.\n. Added a --classic option for old-style builds. Will remove in a few weeks.\n. No. The strconv.Atoi fails on the empty string and returns 0 which works as a default value.\n. Would be nice to add a --promote flag for copy similar to env set\n.  incremental builds\n. Looks good, though please make the relevant changes in api/manifest.yml\n. Also need to update client/instances.go with the new attributes\n. How about convox-start- as the prefix just so it's super clear where they came from.\n. ## Release Playbook\n- [x] Rebase against master\n- [x] Pass checks\n- [x] Release branch (20160228181852-build-tag-prefix)\n- [x] Pass CI (https://circleci.com/gh/convox/rack/619)\n- [x] Code review\n- [x] Merge into master\n- [x] Release master (20160228215605)\n- [x] Pass CI (https://circleci.com/gh/convox/rack/620)\n- [x] Update dev and testing racks\n- [x] Publish release\n- [x] Release CLI\n. Thanks for the patch!\n. Let's make the error message friendlier. I.e. Say [a-z0-9-] instead of the big regex\n. Yes please\n. :+1:\n. Perhaps a different parameter name that suggests it's just an addition? Completely replacing the Userdata should probably be an option at some point for people using custom AMIs.\n. How about InstanceBootCommand? I can tell what that does without reading the description.\n. Seems worth throwing some tests around this just due to how sensitive bugs are here.\n. :+1:\n. Should be fixed. Also can now set a .convox/sync file to true to have it on by default.\n. Pinging @noah for review\n. Closing this for now. We're doing a lot with Rails, etc lately. Perhaps at some point we can revisit these numbers with the mem_limit stanza and default docker-compose.yml for various frameworks/languages. Thanks for submitting!\n. Pinging @nzoschke and @awsmsrc for code review\n. Good idea. Made the local port optional.\n. Comments inline. Overall looks amazing.\n. @mwarkentin thats right\n. Any reason we need to rename the binary to build2?\n. This is all looking really good. I am :+1: once the BuildSave() definition is changed.\n. Closing in favor of #550 \n. Let's use the latest godep in vendor mode rather than bmiz/vendor. The new Godep still stores the SHAs which is important for being able to reconstruct GOPATH when updating packages or adding siblings.\nExample:\n- Developer A vendors github.com/foo/bar/baz at SHA 123456, commits, and pushes\n- Developer B wants to vendor github.com/foo/bar/qux but doesn't know which SHA its sibling was committed using unless there is some sort of manifest.\nThis scenario will happen quite often with things like aws-sdk-go when we start using a new service.\n. There is another codepath that reads these labels that is used by start. Should drop the com from that one too. \n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. If it wasn't even working in production no need for the backwards-compatibility.\n. \n. :+1: Have not actually booted this up in my Rack yet but this looks great.

ACM cert generation is a two-step process that involves receiving an email and clicking a link. The ACM cert isn't valid until you do that.\n$ convox ssl update web:443 acm-6a4a10d62b4a -a sinatra\nUpdating certificate...

Thanks for adding the test, too!\n. :+1:\n. Can we deal with the quotes on our end so the users don't have to quote the whole string? Is there any downside?\n. Can we do the escaping for them too? Something like %q\n. @nzoschke If we can do some escaping here to make things work more nicely then we should do it now before (and if) it will become a backwards-incompatible change.\n. Makes sense, :+1:\n. I think local SSL is related to convox proxy on docker for Mac \n. Have also repackaged the base images in terms of ubuntu 16.04\n. Rebased, tests are running now\n. Continuing this in #593, thank you!\n.  convox start docker for mac\n. Only other feedback here is that the CLI stuff is mixed in with this PR when it could probably be separate just to be more clear about what's changing. No need to block this PR though.\n:+1:\n. Haven't tried it on a rack yet but a look over the diff gets a :+1: from me\n. Thank you :)\n. Thank you :)\n.  Implement 2-way code sync\n. Merging on #668\n. :+1:\n. Merging in #668\n. Merging on #668\n. Yes, you have the basics correct. Working on some of the apps some of the time is a complicated proposition. My suggestion would be to build a shell script that run the convox starts for you. Perhaps in different tmux windows or terminal tabs?\n. Only one application is accessible on the host. This is a limitation of Docker for Mac.\nAny application started with --link does not expose its ports to the host. They are only available internally to other applications to access by --linking to them.\n. After thinking some more I will need to change the logic of which convox start is allowed to expose ports on the host. Perhaps another flag.\n. Are there fairly standard setups when working on different things? Perhaps you can create shell scripts to encode these:\n``` shell\n$ cat start-mode1.sh\n!/bin/bash\nterm-new-window() { ... }\nterm-new-tab() { ... }\nterm-new-window\nterm-new-tab \"cd ~/src/a1 && convox start --internal\"\nterm-new-tab \"cd ~/src/a2 && convox start --internal --link a1\"\nterm-new-tab \"cd ~/src/a3 && convox start --link a1 --link a2\"\n```\nThe ports of the a3 app would be available to connect from your local host.\n. What about something like:\n```\n$ convox start\n$ curl https://localhost:443/\n$ convox start --shift 10000\n$ curl https://localhost:10443/\n``\n. Probably a.convox/shift` file\n. Took a swing at that in #662\n.  Port Conflicts\n. For now I'd like to keep it simple and just shift everything, should make it easy to know what's being referenced at any point.\nI'm still thinking about whether or not to add this to docker-compose.yml. It seems like it might be a per-developer-machine setting. Do you think everyone will have the exact same layout?\n. After thinking about it changed this to read a label named convox.start.shift=NNNNN\n. Merging in #668\n. Closing in favor of #804, thank you!\n. Looks like you might actually want gopkg.in/urfave/cli.v1 from the README\n. Maybe just a y/n? Between all of the possibly unfamiliar or new nouns here it seems hard to know what to type. \n.  ECR in us-west-2\n.  convox switch\n. +1\n. Closes #729\n. Closing in favor of #731 which addresses submodules when a ref is specified\n. Closes #729\n. We could also possibly add warnings around this and concurrency like we do rack scaling.\n. Removing from merge party for now, needs a better rebase\n. Overall looks good but a few comments:\nLet's try to avoid too much length (and underscores) so probably convox.health.*\nIs there some way we could describe all of this in one or two parameters?\nEg \nconvox.health.endpoint=web:9000/foo\nconvox.health.timeout=60\nAnd derive the rest from those. Would like to avoid getting too tied down to exact Amazon implementation detail in the docker compose or rack api if possible. \nFor things that absolutely need to be exposed from down in the aws plumbing let's use cloudformation parameters. \n. +1 to Noah's suggested labels\n. - [x] #813 Handle relative destination directories for code sync\n- [x] #812 Handle builds as map as well as string\n- [x] #814 code sync with relative destination\n. - [x] #821 long output lines break convox start\n.

Merged in #882\n.  Load Balancer Labels PR\n. Removing from merge party for now, needs a better rebase\n. Moving to #878\n. I think the app's \"current environment\" is separate from the releases. We can pull the current environment from S3 rather than the latest or current release.\n. Going to close this for now but happy to revisit if we can get these errors worked out.\n. It checks the current process list to make sure all processes are running the new release.\nhttps://github.com/convox/rack/pull/805/files#diff-42dc6b980db4020854ec4450ad9a5942R163\n. Closing in favor of #822 \n. Thanks for submitting this pull request but I'm going to reject it for now. We are trying to use Console as the multi-Rack coordination point.\nIf you want to avoid using Console might I suggest setting up some aliases you can share?\nalias convox-production convox login production-elb.host\n. Another option: alias convox-known cat ~/.convox/auth | jq -r 'keys|.[]'\n. 20160629152014-efs\n.  efs\n. This looks great, thank you :) I've been wanting this command myself for a while. Made a couple of suggestions about ending in non-zero exit codes when a URL is not available.\n. Looks good. I think this is a bit different than services info as it seems designed to be used in some sort of scripting. To me this means no formatting or preambles, making sure we are using stdin and stderr correctly, and good exit codes. Your changes are looking really good.\n. This probably needs an accompanying change in console too\n.  convox start reports application type\n. :+1: needs rebase\n.

Service name conflicts with full stack name. Yes, we'll need to add some documentation around the old services and/or Rack versions that apply.. It needs to generate the Fn::Join with the Ref in the middle. This is used to select the intermediate instance port (that sits between the ELB and the container port). Sorry, have been pushing through some changes lately and looks like this branch needs a rebase. Once you do that I'll review and get it in to our next release.. It also appears that hound has noted some style issues that need to be resolved, mostly around clarifying comments. Let me know if you're not sure how to resolve those.. Yes, in general we're trying to satisfy the Hound going forward. Let me know if this is too burdensome and I can help.. This may be an issue with master, I'm investigating..

You should be able to safely rebase on master now, it should no longer in flux. Sorry for all the hassle!. Stay tuned, we have some good stuff in the works for you folks.\nNow that we have host-based routing in ALB we can easily do one-ALB-per-Rack and route the internal hostnames correctly. The team is hard at work getting a completely revamped approach centered around this ready. We're hoping to have something for you all to try in the next few weeks..  disable internal registry and fix us-east-2. Can you include an example terminal transcript using this functionality in the PR description please.. Needs a rebase. Possible to add a quick test around this?

A good error message tells them what is wrong and suggests how they can fix it. How about something like:\nERROR: Your CLI is pointing directly at a Rack.

This needs a rebase (please do rebase instead of pushing the merge button).\nLooks like it also stops at login.go and doesn't handle the rest of the commands.. My guess is a list somewhere needs to be sorted to keep the output deterministic.. The changes were carried over into https://github.com/convox/praxis. Looks like this needs a rebase. This is going to make it harder to debug Convox in some cases. It was handy to be able to run the docker commands yourself to see what was going on.. Maybe w could test the verbose vs non-verbose output?. Looks like this needs rebase and is not passing CI. convox.draining.timeout has parity with convox.idle.timeout and convox.health.timeout. Strongly disapprove of using this shortcut approach again. There is an incredibly easy and correct way to do this on AWS..  convox login uses proxies so requires client code but still needs console id. Closing for now since this is quite old but will borrow this cloudformation template for Praxis. Thanks!. Should be completely invisible other than the EBS volumes will now be encrypted at rest.. That is not the case. The change being rolled out allows the runtime\nattribute of lambda functions to be updated without requiring replacement\nof the resource.

Disable agent for SMRT.  20170605. Closing for now, will implement exit code capture in the refactor currently underway. Closing for now as the design needs work. Wouldn't the monitor worker just be restarted on a different instance?. What would cause app downtime when this is enabled?. With ALB now supporting multiple certificates this branch is a bit outdated. Work continues on the refactor branch. Gen2 apps are ready for production and that is the path to get ALB.. Thanks!. Most of the UX research I've read in the past suggests that adding these sorts of y/N responses almost always leads to training users to blindly hit y after the commands.\n\nMore effective would be to make them type the name of the thing they are trying to delete, but they already had to do that in the original command. That being said, any sort of prompt added to this command would break any existing scripts using it.\nYou could possibly print out the name of the thing they are trying to delete and give a 5 second delay? I don't really love that either. Seems to punish users that know what they're trying to delete.\nWhat is the core problem we are trying to solve? Is it too easy to type the wrong name for deletion? Are users too quick on the enter key?. Hmm, so if you are pasting you are likely to just paste again into a confirmation dialog. If the user is not stopping to read the command before they push enter how do we force them to read a confirmation dialog?. What about adding some sort of \u201clocked\u201d mode that prevents a database from being deleted. Requires manual unlock first. I think we can do this pretty easily on cloud formation with termination protection. . Going to close this for now but have added an internal feature request to our list to support CloudFormation termination protection.

What's the downside of just turning this on by default rather than making it configurable?.

Upgrades past that point would still come from the Convox S3 bucket.. This is a good start but will only affect the initial Rack installation. Upgrades past that point would still come from the Convox S3 bucket.. Closing this for now. If you want to install Rack from a custom template in an S3 bucket you can do so using the AWS console, CLI, or API. Making all of the convox assets come from an S3 bucket could be interesting but would be a much bigger undertaking.. waiting for fargate to be released in more regions. Thanks!. Looks good, thanks. This would need to be parameterized at the app stack level as the convox.site domain is still useful for testing purposes in many apps.. It is helpful to have a hostname that works, even before you have configured DNS.\nI would support this PR if it could be triggered with an app-level CloudFormation parameter. Defaults to on, can be toggled off with a CloudFormation parameter. DefaultDomain=Yes|No, defaulted to Yes. Handled by #2562. The certificate will be needed regardless. I think the answer here is to try to look for a matching certificate in the account and use that rather than creating a new certificate if possible.. Closing this for now. The way to build this will be to search the account for a certificate that matches the application's custom domain and use that if found.. Nice work, thanks!. Had to make a quick tweak to convox-env, can you please rebase this and I'll get it in the next release.. Here's the conflicting PR for reference: #2467 \n. Thanks!. It's not possible to export empty values. Run convox start -g 1. @mwarkentin made that change. @mwarkentin made that change. Possibly, but trying to keep convox.yml cloud-agnostic so would need to think about how to encode that.. Would rather not auto-select if ambiguous as many Convox operations can be dangerous on the wrong Rack.. It is much better to use the IamPolicy parameter for an app to add additional policies to the ServiceRole. Any manual changes you make could be lost on a subsequent update.. Going to close this for now. Please feel free to re-open with the suggested changes.. I think it would be better to just remove this message entirely. Thoughts?. Doesn't seem to be accomplishing much. Feel free to remove it.. Moved to #2731 and tweaked a bit. This will be handled by the CLI change coming in #2739. Thanks! Carrying forward in #2742. good point, modified so that only 401 passes for those third-party apps where modifying the source is difficult and everything is behind auth. You should not be seeing this issue on the instances the API containers run on unless you are running docker build manually there somehow. ECS cleans up after itself manually for all of the images it starts.. You should not be seeing this issue on the instances the API containers run on unless you are running docker build manually there somehow. ECS cleans up after itself manually for all of the images it starts.. Actually thinking more about it I can see how gen1 apps could cause this on the API container instances. I'm hesitant to add this to all instances for fear of interfering with the images the ECS agent expects to be there. Will need to do a bit more research toward that end.. From what I have heard the ECS image based on the new Amazon Linux 2 AMI will use overlay2 as a default. Due to what seems like issues with overlay2 when configured in this manner I am in general inclined to wait for the new ECS AMIs.. As per previous comment going to close this for now as I'd rather not take on the maintenance burden until it's in the ECS image proper.. adding this broke network connectivity for a few things, will revisit later. Not sure what has happened here in the rebase but it seems to be missing some commits (the first commit doesn't make any sense)\nYou may want to re-clone the repo somewhere, copy your final changed files in, and just make 1 commit with the changes and push it up to a branch.. Yes. You can adjust all of these options in your convox.yml and redeploy. As long as your database is set to durable: true it should happen without downtime.. Specify your type like class: ${DATABASE_CLASS} and use an env var to make it dynamic per deployment. . Looks good, thanks!. covered in #2927. This failed in CI, looks like if the description is empty it has a problem saving the release.\nhttps://circleci.com/gh/convox/rack/3327. Not all regions have t3 yet. Yep. Thanks for trying this on Linux, it's on my todo list for this week. You could help me out a lot with that process (I'm not a native Linux-workstation user, would be doing the VM thing) by seeing if you can figure out what tweaks are necessary to get past that.\nOne other thing I need to figure out is whether or not NetworkManager allows for alternate ports in its custom DNS setup. I've just guessed at this config file.\nhttps://github.com/convox/rack/blob/756afc0ebc87603ff34ea59610e0ce24fdb8b1ad/provider/local/system_linux.go#L33. Did you install it with the name convox or test (which you would get if you followed the instructions in the PR verbatim). @qnm Try again with the version 20181114021011-k8s-local. It's not on 127.0.0.1. Try resolvectl query rack.test. Also make sure you blow away any manual files you created in resolved.d. Are you sure you have updated your cli and reinstalled the local rack? It should not be showing 127.0.0.1 in that config file. Is the sudo convox update updating the right binary?. New release is 20181114123334-k8s-local. If it's working in nslookup that should be enough. Sometimes resolvectl holds on to a cache for a bit.. It works in my VM. On my VM my /etc/systemd/resolved.conf has no configuration in it, only a blank [Resolve] section but internet-host-resolving still works.\n```\nGlobal\n       LLMNR setting: no\nMulticastDNS setting: no\n  DNSOverTLS setting: no\n      DNSSEC setting: no\n    DNSSEC supported: no\n  Current DNS Server: 10.152.183.14\n         DNS Servers: 10.152.183.14\n          DNS Domain: ~abcd\n                      ~dev\n          DNSSEC NTA: 10.in-addr.arpa\n                      16.172.in-addr.arpa\n                      168.192.in-addr.arpa\n                      17.172.in-addr.arpa\n                      18.172.in-addr.arpa\n                      19.172.in-addr.arpa\n                      20.172.in-addr.arpa\n                      21.172.in-addr.arpa\n                      22.172.in-addr.arpa\n                      23.172.in-addr.arpa\n                      24.172.in-addr.arpa\n                      25.172.in-addr.arpa\n                      26.172.in-addr.arpa\n                      27.172.in-addr.arpa\n                      28.172.in-addr.arpa\n                      29.172.in-addr.arpa\n                      30.172.in-addr.arpa\n                      31.172.in-addr.arpa\n                      corp\n                      d.f.ip6.arpa\n                      home\n                      internal\n                      intranet\n                      lan\n                      local\n                      private\n                      test\nLink 110 (veth26f063a4)\n      Current Scopes: none\n       LLMNR setting: yes\nMulticastDNS setting: no\n  DNSOverTLS setting: no\n      DNSSEC setting: no\n    DNSSEC supported: no\nLink 108 (veth7a6a241c)\n      Current Scopes: none\n       LLMNR setting: yes\nMulticastDNS setting: no\n  DNSOverTLS setting: no\n      DNSSEC setting: no\n    DNSSEC supported: no\nLink 103 (vethb1b26cff)\n      Current Scopes: none\n       LLMNR setting: yes\nMulticastDNS setting: no\n  DNSOverTLS setting: no\n      DNSSEC setting: no\n    DNSSEC supported: no\nLink 101 (vethb226b052)\n      Current Scopes: none\n       LLMNR setting: yes\nMulticastDNS setting: no\n  DNSOverTLS setting: no\n      DNSSEC setting: no\n    DNSSEC supported: no\nLink 8 (cbr0)\n      Current Scopes: none\n       LLMNR setting: yes\nMulticastDNS setting: no\n  DNSOverTLS setting: no\n      DNSSEC setting: no\n    DNSSEC supported: no\nLink 3 (docker0)\n      Current Scopes: none\n       LLMNR setting: yes\nMulticastDNS setting: no\n  DNSOverTLS setting: no\n      DNSSEC setting: no\n    DNSSEC supported: no\nLink 2 (ens33)\n      Current Scopes: DNS\n       LLMNR setting: yes\nMulticastDNS setting: no\n  DNSOverTLS setting: no\n      DNSSEC setting: no\n    DNSSEC supported: no\n  Current DNS Server: 192.168.225.2\n         DNS Servers: 192.168.225.2\n          DNS Domain: ~.\n                      localdomain\n```. That configuration was just from a fresh install of 18.10. These types of resources are meant to be totally self-contained with their final URL. If you need a simpler SQS resource it would be better to create it through alternative means.. Carrying forward in #3032 (reduced the delay in the testing). Carrying this in #3058 . Thanks!. Yes, the resource stacks will fail rather than replacing an existing database instance. Strange that it considers that version bump a downgrade.\nTo work around this you can specify a specific version in your convox.yml:\nresources:\n  database:\n    type: postgres\n    options:\n      version: 9.6.<whatever>. FWIW in all of my local testing changing the version from 9.6.6 to 9.6 worked fine as it considered that an upgrade that did not require replacement. I wonder what's happening on your end.. Unfortunately I don't see being able to accept a change of this nature as it is susceptible to timing issues. What if it takes more than 1 second to connect and transfer the logs? What if the logs are still transferring when the status loop terminates?. I think this might work better as an option to convox env set. \nset-file doesn't really describe how it differs from convox env set. You can already do cat .env | convox env set which seems to duplicate this command as currently named. (The replacement behavior is not obvious from the name)\nInstead you could add a --replace option to convox env set.\nThis would allow both of the following to work:\nconvox env set FOO=bar -a myapp --replace\ncat .env | convox env set -a myapp --replace. Closing in favor of #3078. Rebased as #3085. Thanks!. I don't believe this is going to solve it as the Go HTTP stack is already channel-based.\nIf you can put together a simple test case that demonstrates your issue as a repo that I can convox start I'd be happy to take a look..

Is there any way to get this by passing a manifest around where you need it?\n. nice :)\n. Yep both of them should have the condition\n. Could simplify this a bit:\nargs = append(args, \"-f\", \"/\" + dockerfile))\n. I'm pretty sure cmd/app can be removed\n. No. This is all new code so it just never had it.\n. Added\n. Added\n. It's resizing the TTY on the docker daemon end so should be fine.\n. Let's leave the simpler version of the randomAlphabet[]selection in place. Did this version get copied from somewhere else?\n. Let's call these private-ip and public-ip\n. If somehow these both get set manifest should probably win (or it should be an error)\n. Can we make this parameter be Yes/No like other booleans?\nhttps://github.com/convox/rack/blob/master/api/models/templates/app.tmpl#L37-L38\n. Let's make this SNS or remove it for now\n. Not having the convox CLI installed isn't really an option is it?\n. Can they do this with convox proxy instead?\n. Maybe Local instead of Laptop? Wasn't immediately clear to me what that meant.\n. This was never a real thing so probably don't need to deprecate it.\n. Docker for Mac instead?\n. We should add a test / CI check / something that fails if templates.go is not current.\n. Ah right. This is going to be annoying if they switch Wifi with their laptop or anything. Thoughts on how they could poke this hole more easily / dynamically?\n. nice\n. Provider API should be self-contained and infrastructure agnostic so should not have a bucket name in the function signature. The provider module can read buckets, etc from the environment.\n. oops, fixed!\n. Let's keep the switch here. There will be other values for this label eventually. As mentioned in the other comment don't need the backwards compatibility since it wasn't even working before.\n. Is there ever a time where you don't want follow?\n. Can this be compared to syscall.EPIPE?\n. Do we need to lose service logs?\n. Makes sense. How about making follow=false be the default if stdout is not a TTY.\n. Dont hardcode https\n. Dont debug output\n. debug output\n. remove tcp+proxy and tls+proxy\n. Ah I believe this is a remnant of something I was doing where I needed the account ID in Rack. Can be safely removed. Make sure it's out of the docker-compose.yml too\n. Hmm, not sure what you mean it's right here on line 155\n. Not sure yet. It doesn't seem to make much of a speed difference but it does drop some internet-dependency. Unfortunately it's hard to conditionally copy a directory if it exists.\n. Instead of hard coding this we can probably just move forward with no chain if we can't resolve one. And could print the cfssl output as a warning but maybe not necessary. \n. This string could potentially be really long which is why we don't normally display the additional domains. I think it's fine to display the cloud flare OU here\n. This file already comes from the convox/rails image\n. This file comes from the convox/rails image. You should add your server.pid line to there.\n. We shouldn't do volumes like this by default until Docker for Mac is more widely available. We should also change our defaults around sync at the same time.\n. If we have language-specific things they should be handled in the language-specific images. bin/web and initializers/convox.rb come from convox/rails. .dockerignore should probably be global to all languages.\nIn any event when doing language-specific things let's use switch statements so it's more natural to add additional languages.\n. Has anyone done any performance testing (even just anecdotal) with volumes on Docker for Mac? The existing solutions with volumes had real problems around performance that made them basically unusable. Are those problems gone?\n. Volumes are not necessarily where the puck is headed. I still have real questions around dev/prod parity with volumes such as the files \"lost\" by mounting over them apparent in this very PR. Those files would suddenly reappear in production. Any changes made to /app by the docker build process would be clobbered by mounting over them. Seems like a recipe for a bad time. \n. Docker exec a watcher that lists files that change. Docker cp them out when they show up in the list. The tech there should be trivial. \n. Also just a note that just because Docker is investing energy into it doesn't mean it's the right call. See overlay networks. \n. There are a plethora of other things that might mutate /app and get blown away. Assets precompile?\n. They aren't hardcoded into images as they can be overwritten with a future COPY. They are just good defaults that the large majority of users should not need to tweak. For those that do we can provide a method to go power mode. \n. This Dockerfile should not be ruby-centric\n. This error message doesn't match the conditional\n. It seems like this is just testing the Ruby init files\n. As far as I can tell this is not actually doing what it advertises. It's using the Dockerfile from whatever language is detected and not generating one from the Procfile.\n. Should throw a time.Sleep(100 * time.Millsecond) at the bottom of this loop so it doesnt thrash\n. Can also probably be Output() instead of CombinedOutput() since you're only interested in Stdout\n. Let's not do this. It makes CI much less useful. \n. Can we just feed the version in instead of splitting and recombining?\n. Your not you're. \nIs 1.9 the version where the tag behavior changed?\n. This could be susceptible to bugs in the future. There's no guarantee that this Releases struct is sorted appropriately.\n. Check the length of parts here to avoid a panic\n. Should check error results here since bad parsing could result in e.g. Scaling to 0\n. Check length of parts here \n. Check length of parts\n. Looks like it might need a gofmt\n. Maybe use stdcli.ExitError here so we get the ERROR: prefix and non-zero exit code. Since this will probably be used in scripts I think the extra information would be helpful.\n. Probably make this an error of some sort with stdcli.ExitError() since there won't be a valid URL to show.\n. Yep, makes sense to me. The ifs with a return inside are basically guard statements.\n. You can probably even one-liner these with:\nreturn stdcli.ExitError(fmt.Errorf(...))\n. This seems like it disables the exit and this error won't be displayed anywhere\n. Why the parameter list change?\n. This displays ep.Error no matter which one was not nil.\n. Yes, this is the only special volume we support. Matt is working on the docs for this stuff.\n. let's use a slightly more descriptive name as well if we're going to export this\n. Let's remove this extra print\n. Let's go ahead and change the name on this so we don't have to look up docs to know what it means\n. I think these conditionals will be problematic if the parameter is not there at all. We should either fully de-parameterize or make them unconditional I think.\n. what is the difference in this branch?\n. This package should be independent of the CLI. App name should be maybe passed in to the function. \n. Let's call this convox.idle.timeout\n. Let's use convox.deployment.minimum for this\n. these are lowercase everywhere else\n. Let's line this up with the no-cache. This should be invoked with convox start --no-sync\n. Why do we flip this to public? Does this affect the creation of internal load balancers on AWS?\n. We should treat manifest as if it is used by both local and production as the eventual goal should be to make that completely true.\nCreate a docker-compose.yml with postgres1 and postgres2 process types and have them both listen on - 5432 to demonstrate the problem.\n. I think you want app.Parameters[\"DeploymentMinimum\"] etc\n. Is there some easy way to catch this higher and eliminate all NoEcho parameters from being carried forward into this map in the first place?\n. Can we get away without exposing ReleaseBatchDelete in the provider interface?\n. I believe all of the Bound logic should be gone now\n. Would prefer to see it left as ReleaseDelete and the controller can call it multiple times. There should not be very many releases per build in most situations.\n. Debug print?\n. There is the CF parameter \"Internal\" and the local check of .Scheme == \"internal\" (the latter is set when you use only a single port pair)\n. I think you can't use things with a map as a key. See the \"Key types\" section of https://blog.golang.org/go-maps-in-action\nThat being said I think this isnt properly hashing the args map.\n. Is there any reason to not just set this to a really big number in the first place?\n. Maybe a short comment above this logic talking about its intent? Are we always getting the last network defined?\n. Go ahead and return one error but make it %s is linked to these services and cannot be deleted: service1, service2, service\n. As far as I can tell\n. Go ahead and set these for all service types. There should be some code later that pulls off the unneeded parameters but this way any service that needs them can get them.\n. alphabetize please\n. Let's call this just BuildLogs\n. Yes. An older release completely dropped support for deploying them. Anyone that really needs to stay on that format can use an older Rack release.\n. How does this patch behave when the cron job name has dashes in it?\n. Do we actually prevent the dashes from being used in the first place?\n. Almost all of this controller should be in the BuildImport provider method. The controller should have no knowledge of Docker, just handing the file upload straight off to provider.BuildImport(app, reader)\n. Can this be part of POST /apps/{app}/builds ?\nThe former already has a few different input types (tarball, repo url, incremental index)\n. How about GET /apps/{app}/builds/{build}.tgz ?\n. Probably don't need to expose repos outside of the provider\n. Don't need to expose repositories from the provider interface\n. All of the build paths return a Build object which itself has a Release attribute (that's how things like convox build --promote work)\n. This message was misleading. Autoscale can happen for more reasons than just process count. It has been replaced by better logs.\n. Added another check to replace this, thanks :)\n. Why is the CreateLogGroup necessary here?\n. testing code reviews\n. another test\n. I updated the comment to point to the other repo as this is largely influenced by the ideas in this wrapper but is not an outright copy. Thanks!\n. doh! good catch, fixed\n. Yes, I'll fix it in a quick CLI release once I have a release number for this release.\n. It's handled by Docker. Pulling the images on the API instance doesn't necessarily help anymore anyway.\n. Can we factor out a BuildService instead? This params list is getting rather unwieldy.\n. Feels like there should be a better way to proliferate this.\n. could factor out a RunService here:\nr := m.RunService(service, dir, app, RunOptions{\n  Cache: true,\n  Sync: true,\n})\n. These can just be service and command. The extra modifier target isn't really adding anything here.\n. This is Cache everywhere else. Let's invert this one for consistency.\n. extra blank line\n. what is the value in pushing this into a go func?\n. Seems like it might be easy to add a test for the \"converging\" version.\n. should just be Private for consistency\n. That should be an error.\n. return nil, err\n. So let's go the other way with this to avoid surprises around the namespace. Perhaps name the variable m down in the function and let this be manifest\n. Let's not error the whole build if this fails.\n. Let's use an options struct here. See other provider methods like BuildCreate for an example.. Same here, let's make an options struct.. We should not display the APP column when listing processes for a single app.. probably need to paginate this. The nobody user is actually already in the nobody group on alpine.. Yep. I think -a is OK here since it's under the convox rack namespace. ps -a feels like a natural command to me.. Is this still needed?. Don't we make the Gateway attachment regardless of blank existing VPC?. Would be nice to remove the return above and just add a guard here to return if there are no changes.\nWe should also move the log back down here. I'd like to see the actual changes it's about to try to make after all of the adjustments made by the algorithm.. Probably just switch the log to just above here. So we still see the change=0 log.. Probably want something non-tmp so we at least still get persistence.. Would like to avoid AWS-specific naming here. Perhaps convox.balancer. Makes sense to me. I think this change makes sense as is.. Good catch. We should do this globally for the whole test suite. Save the env, clear it, and restore it when done?. Should probably be -Function-* to try to avoid spillage from e.g.  dev and dev-foo. Should actually be -Function-*. Can we do this higher? Maybe in main() of the CLI?. Should validations like this be in the Rack API?. Seems like we're getting into regex territory for the parsing here. Can all of these be done with the right regex?. Can we modify the API on the Rack side to detect and throw errors like this? Does that make sense to do?. That's the right place. Maybe you weren't pointed at your local Rack?. This test seems badly named and in the wrong file. Did the rest of these tests get renamed?. I think you should be able to set env vars to an empty value. If the docker-compose.yml list of env vars is a \"manifest\" of required vars then some people will need to set some of them to blank.. CONVOX_DEBUG is for the CLI. DEBUG is used internally by rack. In the docker-compose.yml for Rack these are web and monitor. Eventually I'd like Rack's own cloudformation template to come from the same code that generates our templates for apps.. Yes consistency.. This could be a BoolTFlag named autoscale and then both --autoscale and --no-autoscale should work with true being the default.. Where does this list come from?. Just \"docker\" should have PATH do the right thing here.. It automatically happens by being referenced if the Private condition is met.. If which docker works then docker was in the PATH to begin with.. Can we do this with CloudFormation events?\nWe could create an SNS topic on the Rack that either calls back to a Rack HTTP endpoint (see webhooks) or have the Rack subscribe to an SQS queue that is subscribed to that SNS topic.\nThis should give us real \"events\" for CF updates (we could probably even use this to add things to the logs if we want to) without the polling which will fail if a rack container is restarted while waiting.. Is it possible to use one of the Waiters in the SDK for this?. This should be covered by the line below it.. can't add the rack's internal registry. host := fmt.Sprintf(\"%s.dkr.ecr.%s.amazonaws.com\", a.Outputs[\"RegistryId\"], p.Region)\nFound this builds.go in the provider. Should be able to use that to match specifically.. Missing bounds check. This is different from how the build process determines the app's registry. This seems in danger to diverge in the future. Should fix one or both sides or at least add clarifying comments to both sides.. What's up with this test?. What does legacy app mean in this context?\nShould probably document the \"\", nil potential return case here as it's out of the value-or-error normal.. Does /auth return more than just id in that JSON hash? If so this function should be returning a struct.. Does this \"legacy app\" situation happen enough to justify swallowing errors blindly here?. A parameter change is not the only thing that can cause a stack to change. Sometimes we update the underlying templates and the user will get changes even without parameter changes.\nLet's not try to reimplement CloudFormation here. Are we just looking for a nicer display of their error?. Looks like a description accidentally got copy/pasted here. Would you please alphabetize these parameters? Makes it easier to manage as things grow.. Should be [--domain-name=example-domain-here] etc for parameters that take values.. AWS will tell us if it won't make a change. Let's look for that error message and leave the logic here up to the CF engine.. Seems fragile to test the entire output of the help text here. What are you really trying to test?. Same here. Why the commented out attribute?. Same question about commented out attribute. This test's name doesn't seem to cover what it is testing. This conditional name doesn't really make sense. Would probably be better to add a LambdaRuntime attribute to one of the region attribute mappings (this is how we determine EFS, etc). Just looked at rack.json. Should add a LambdaRuntime attribute next to Ami in RegionConfig. If you need a conditional then it should be named something that describes it better. This conditional seems to suggest that it is whether or not the region allows custom topic updates but that is not the case. This conditional describes whether or not the region allows the runtime attribute of a lambda function to be updated.. Probably don't even need the direct instructions here.. We don't need a boolean here. Use the presence/blankness of EncryptionKey. Instead of special-casing for these two, we could parse the resource template, get its parameter list, and always set EncryptionKey equal to the rack's KMS key if the parameter exists.. From experience DescribeStacks seems particularly vulnerable to throttling (we added some caching around this in Rack)\nLong term the right answer is for CF/ECS events to go into SQS and we can have a worker pulling data off and making bigger chunks of logs API calls. Can we write this as an Fn::Sub for readability?. Looks like indentation is inconsistent here. This should be   aws.Int64(spotDesiredCapacity-1). This should be the same aws.Int64 as above, I think there are a couple of others also. This should be all spaces instead of one tab and the rest spaces. Make this cd.Privileged = aws.Boolean(s.Privileged) rather than a direct reference to avoid possible side effects.. Thanks :) Updated. is this exit necessary?. Let's use just one DefaultDomain parameter to avoid the parameter proliferation (CloudFormation has a hard limit of 60 parameters per stack). This chunk seems incorrect. It would only create the service if DefaultDomain=Yes?\nI don't think this branch is necessary.. Please fix up the indentation here. Please put the --encrypted flag in alphabetical order. With this code if the user specifies port: but not domain: and sets DefaultDomain=No the service would not be created.. .Name is already the name of the service here. Isn't this just creating duplication?. This should probably be $service.Name. This can be combined into the describeTasks() call and doesn't need a variable assignment.. This can be combined into the describeTasks() call and doesn't need a variable assignment.. This doesn't need to be a separate variable. Let's call this Service. Might as well add App as well while you're in there.. Wouldn't this need to be on the cloudwatchlogs helper?\nCan also be done without the extra variable.. Gotcha. If App is already in there don't worry about it.. The default is now for a BuildInstance as the experience is significantly improved with one. I think it's appropriate to keep that default in the CloudFormation stack.\nI would be amenable to a --no-build-instance flag to convox install. can move this to the _linux specific file since it's linux specific. best way to read a file contents in go is\ndata, err := ioutil.ReadFile(\"/etc/os-release\"). I would probably break this into two functions, sort of like this pseudocode\n```\nvar reAttributeMatcher = regexp.MustCompile(\"...\")  (substitute appropriate regex here, see https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/)\nfunc linuxReleaseAttributes() (map[string]string, error) {\n  attrs := map[string]string{}\n  data = read(/etc/os-release)\n  s := bufio.NewScanner(bytes.NewReader(data))\n  for s.Scan() {\n    if m := reAttributeMatcher.FindStringSubmatch(s.Text()); len(m) >= 2 {\n     attrs[m[0]] = m[1]\n    }\n  }\n}\nfunc linuxRelease() (string, error) {\n  attrs, err := linuxReleaseAttributes()\n  if err return err\n  return fmt.Sprintf(\"%s-%s\", attrs[\"NAME\"], attrs[\"VERSION_ID\"])\n}. dont need the extra space at the beginning of functions. This ToLower is likely going to conflict with looking for NAME and VERSION_ID in the function below. In general I'd recommend a regular expression for this kind of parsing just for flexibility as well.. You should be able to find one in the wild that supports the parsing of NAME=\"value\" (or NAME=value) style lines. Probably best to call these setupResolverUbuntu1804 and setupResolverGeneric just for easy reference in the future. Should be possible to write this regex so that it can parse any of the following:\n\nNAME=value\nNAME=\"value\"\nNAME=\"foo \\\"bar\\\"\"\n\nWould also simplify the code below (could be just FindStringSubmatch(s.Tex())). Looking again at the /etc/os-release it looks like ID is the better machine-parseable attribute (as opposed to NAME). Try a regex like this, should simplify your code below a bit\nhttps://play.golang.org/p/ZSfx1Hz2cBY. This should probably be https://. Please put this parameter in alphabetical order. Seems like this will break on services with dashes in the name, e.g. my-service. Yes, looks like it. Looks like you're right, go ahead and ignore this for now, will have to fix globally. Should only include the Password in the URL if it's encrypted. Please call this condition just Encrypted for consistency with the other CloudFormation stacks. User-specific ignores like this should be in your user-level .gitignore.. Please put these case statements in alphabetical order.. This should probably start with memcached:// for consistency with the other resources.. Can you please remove this change, might need to configure your editor to allow newlines at the end of a file.. Can you please modify the fixture so that one of these has a description that gets tested in the output. Sorry I should have been more clear. Can you please set this one back to blank so we can test both cases (blank description vs one with data). Yes, you're right. Not sure how I missed that.. Let's just default this to 30 instead of parameterizing it.. Is there any real advantage to parameterizing this since the result comes out in the URL?. Is there any real advantage to parameterizing this since the result comes out in the URL?. This one should be called Username. This is no longer checking the error return value.\nI think you don't need the extra function here, maybe something like:\n```golang\nenv := structs.Environment{}\nvar err error\nif !c.Bool(\"replace\") {\n  env, err = helpers.AppEnvironment(rack, app(c))\n  if err != nil {\n    return err\n  }\n}. Sorry one more thing. The flag* globals are really only meant for options that are used in more than one command. Could you please change this to look more like the promote flag below (and alphabetize below it). I can't think of an easy way to merge a user-specified list with a static list inside the template..

I'm not a huge fan of how this makes every service (papertrail and redis right now) get these options. Is there a way to do store the service-specific config another way or did that prove really difficult?  \nI'm thinking something like a map[string]string called config or even doing something with subtypes and embedded types?\n. @nathany the parsing and validation will still need to happen, but can happen on the server side. you could imagine a Validate() method that builds up the proper RDS config struct and does the conversions from strings to the proper types, returning an error if any of the conversions fail. But that's really just one way in a sea of infinity so didn't want to get too prescriptive.\n(Also, if we have that method, it means you can safely persist the service as strings b.c the conversion still works.  Another different way would be to make a struct for each service so that you don't need to re-convert, but once you've separated the notion of \"conversion\" and \"validation\" then what we're really saying is we care more about the validation then exactly how its achieved, and we definitely want to validate data before we store it)\n.  surface insufficient capacity errors\n. functionality is super awesome. would like to see the tests cleaned up (by putting stuff in methods) before merging, i think everything else is just a suggestion\n.  use PrivateIp to ssh to instances\n.  internal load balancers\n. negative on the lambda handler - our logic was right. adding the right DependsOn for the balancer for each ECS service fixed the issue where the service would throw an error\n. new deploy message:\n``` term\nPushing tag for rev [d2b6b86d706f] on {https://convox-2033058839.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com:5000/v1/repositories/dungeon-mud/tags/BHXGXQCXEKX}\nPromoting RRTXPAZMWSD...

Docs review:\n- HttpProxy rack param is already documented\n- #2143 is an internal improvement, doesn't need user-facing docs\n- #2144 is a change in AWS API usage to improve performance, doesn't need docs\n- https://convox.com/docs/environment/ already correctly states that env vars are encrypted in S3, unencrypted in TaskDefinitions. No doc updates needed for Dynamo change, since that wasn't documented..  Use KMS to decrypt secrets within the app. Improve access controls to secrets stored in S3.. @mwarkentin We haven't ruled out EC2 parameter store afaik, but this was a quick way to piggyback on the existing env system to get some extra security.. No documentation changes needed..  Secure build args. Docs review: Need secure environment docs https://trello.com/c/6cgsXXAw.  update submodules when building from git. This is expected behavior in my opinion and doesn't need additional documentation..  privileged: true not working locally with convox start. Docs review:\n\nAdd docs for Agent Rack param https://trello.com/c/4a8THbQN.  convox start run order. \ud83d\udc4d lgtm, thanks. No documentation changes required.. Some additional commits have been added to the original PR to more aggressively set proxy configuration and (no-proxy config where necessary). A --http-proxy option was also added to convox install..  Danone.  fix convox start foo bug where all services are started instead of just foo and its dependencies. Docs review:\nupdate API docs with run output https://trello.com/c/9CVtggJ6.  mysql version.  add missing lambda tag permissions. Docs review:\n--http-proxy install option https://trello.com/c/vaWizO12\n--version for mysql resource https://trello.com/c/PGPb2mY9.  Unhealthy count Health check param.

Gonna approve..  convox run taskrole. @MiguelMoll Just double-checked and the empty string seems to work just fine.

Faster code sync.  --pasword flag for postgres resources.  Fix convox certs generate with multiple domains.  Rack spot instances. Closing in favor of https://github.com/convox/rack/pull/2265.

This needs code to handle --database-snapshot-identifier option to the CLI and pass it in the resource creation request.. This needs code to handle the --backup-retention-period option and pass it to the Rack API.. @ddollar What happens here if spot instances can't be acquired for the set bid price? (Or are terminated) Do we need some logic to backfill capacity with on-demand instances in that case?. Oh I see. It looks like the calculation of onDemandDesired takes currently running spot count into account. Please disregard my previous question.. Good tip, thank you.\n. In my testing the whole update process took 3 or 4 seconds. I think it could be a little longer on a balancer that was serving heavy traffic and had to flush all the requests associated with the old cert before allowing a delete.\n. Yes. If I'm understanding correctly, the default exponential algorithm I've used here has a max time of 15 minutes: https://github.com/cenkalti/backoff/blob/master/exponential.go#L8-L94\nIt's possible to tweak the settings to achieve different curves and maxes. It might make sense to shorten up the max time on this cert update call so the CLI won't hang for a long time.\nFor the delete cert call I think we can let it go because that's backgrounded in a goroutine.\n. I've looked into this and the balancer name is not something that can be fetched directly using GetAtt. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-ec2-elb.html\nIt looks like extracting it from the DNSName will require regular expressions. You can't just split on hyphens because it could be multiple words or the app name could have a hyphen in it. I'm not sure if it's possible to use a regex in this way, and it's not clear to me from the docs. Do you know?\n. I just pushed a commit to use 60s as the max time to retry updating the cert on the listener, so this command should never take longer than 60s to return, even if it fails.\n. :+1: \n. Will this TTY setting persist beyond the life of this goroutine? If so any side effects to consider?\n. @nzoschke Thanks for the tip. I was assuming the S3 bucket referred to here had to be in the same account, but maybe not. If I could just point to a zip file in a public bucket that would be fantastic.\nThe only unique thing in my current lambda function is the rack stack name, but I can probably configure the CloudWatch Event to send that, too.\nSee my comment above about inlining. As I read the docs, that's not going to be possible after October 2016.\n. When you volume mount the app directory the file from the image becomes unavailable because it isn't present on the host.\n. When you volume mount the app directory the file from the image becomes unavailable because it isn't present on the host.\nhttps://github.com/convox/rails/pull/1\n. +1 for changing defaults on sync when we make this change\nHappy to continue discussion for timing on this. Local Rais development without 2-way sync doesn't work very well. Looking forward to wider Docker for Mac availability here.\n. See comments above about files from images becoming unavailable with volume mounts.\nThis should totally be a switch. I'll make that change and refactor this a bit, but I think we still need to generate these files if volume mounting is our sync solution going forward.\n. I've just done some overdue testing with Docker for Mac on a pretty heavy-duty Rails app and sadly found the volume performance to be terrible.\nThere's a pretty interesting thread on the topic in the Docker forums here: https://forums.docker.com/t/file-access-in-mounted-volumes-extremely-slow-cpu-bound/8076/15 \nSeems like the osxfs performance is not really up to snuff yet. There are some alternatives presented in there and also some benchmark data.\nThe last word from Docker was 11days ago:\n\nJust an update here from the Docker camp...\nWe're still working on it! We've added some small performance boosts over the last few Beta's and performance is heading in the right direction. There are a few other fixes that should be heading in over the next few betas that will also provide a decent boost. The target is to be much faster than VirtualBox and we're confident we can do this before release.\nIn the meantime the best thing you can do to help is to give us samples of workloads you feel are slow ideally in a a form that we can replicate e.g Dockerfiles, Compose Files etc... We can then analyse these and try to optimise as much as possible for each!\nThanks for bearing with us and for trying the Docker for Mac beta\n. @ddollar  The example in the test is a sinatra app with a Procfile. Do you want to see more examples? Or a different language/framework?\n. Ok I think I see a way to make this more generic. I'll deal with the \"unknown\" type being detected and have it generate generic Docker assets. Then we can rebase this onto it and update the tests for unknown instead of sinatra.\n. Hmm. Looking at the comments from the previous PR and the code I don't see where this ever advertised it was generating Dockerfile. It's generating docker-compose.yml processes from a Procfile.\n. Updated the PR title and description to make the intent here more clear.\n. In this case \"me\" stands for manifest entry.\n. Yes #573 has the description for this problem. It was closed previously, but I reopened it because the problem still wasn't solved.\n\nThe goal here is to make convox start work when you have more than one internal load balancer listening on the same port.\nThis isn't a problem in production because each process type gets its own ELB.\nIt was broken with convox start because when we did the port mapping we'd just use a host port that matched the internal port. This caused port conflicts on the host if you had more than one process using the same internal port.\nThe solution here (as I understand it) was to use random host ports with convox start to avoid conflicts.\n. @ddollar We specify that dashes are not valid in cron names.\nhttps://convox.com/docs/scheduled-tasks/ \n\nTask names may not be reused within the same application process and must be alphanumeric\n\nThe reason we did that is because if we stripped dashes you could have a job called MyJob and one called my-job and they would conflict. Now that I think about it, though, that same problem can happen with processes.\nmy-process and my_process could currently conflict. Will think about this some more . . .\n. Only via template error propagating up:\nERROR: Template format error: Resource name WebJob-With-DashRule is non alphanumeric.\n. Thinking now we should allow anything in a cron job name that is a valid Docker label key:\nhttps://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/labels-custom-metadata/\n\n\nKeys should only consist of lower-cased alphanumeric characters, dots and dashes (for example, [a-z0-9-.]).\nKeys should start and end with an alpha numeric character.\nKeys may not contain consecutive dots or dashes.\n. Hmm there was some existing validation, but we were allowing dashes:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/convox/rack/blob/master/manifest/manifest.go#L93-L111\n. Just made the change to allow dashes in cronjob names for now.\nAllowing dots within cronjob names doesn't seem like a good idea, because we're using dots to signify namespaces.\nI think there's a separate PR to be made to enforce lowercase, starting and ending with an alphanumeric, and disallowing consecutive dots and dashes across all of our labels.\n. This line enables PROXY protocol. Will the gunicorn backend be able to handle that? We might need to run something in front. In our rails image, for example we use nginx to read the PROXY protocol headers and set HTTP headers for the app backend:\nhttps://github.com/convox/rails/blob/master/conf/nginx.conf#L35-L38\nhttps://github.com/convox/rails/blob/master/bin/web#L6-L7\n. Is it typical for flask backends to listen on ports 5000 and 8000?\n. Is there a good error message we can print here instead of returning silently?. \ud83d\udc4d . Good point, thanks. Could we call this RackAPI just so it's a little easier to know what it is if looking at the Services list in ECS?. I don't think RackMonitor needs this since it doesn't have ports, so doesn't have the same capacity problems as RackWeb. Were you just changing it to keep the naming scheme consistent?\nWondering if we could keep this as RackMonitor and call the other one RackAPI.. yes good eye\n. Updated to iterate to the last page. That makes sense.. @MiguelMoll Done, thanks.. Do we need something conditional for private subnets in private racks?. +1 was just testing this and thinking the same thing. @ddollar I don't see how to avoid a conditional of some kind. We can't just set the runtime to whatever is in the RegionConfig map because it would override the CustomTopicRuntime Parameter setting for newer Racks.\nWe still need to be able to do an If like this somehow:\n\"Fn::If\": [\n             \"RegionHasCustomTopicUpdate\",\n             \"nodejs4.3\",\n             {\n               \"Ref\": \"CustomTopicRuntime\"\n             }\n           ]. @MiguelMoll I would rather leave it in for now since this is working for our customer. This is a documented option and leaving it in seems to have no negative effects, just a bit of code redundancy.. Is this ok?. ",
    "imbriaco": "Awesome, thanks! If you cut a test release of this I'd be happy to update my staging rack to it as a trial run.\n. Looking good!\n. Woot! Thanks!\n. ",
    "nzoschke": ":+1: \n. :+1: \n. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html\nThe Task Definition CPU setting is fairly arbitrary on how it affects running containers. It is not required to set at all, and only guides soft guarantees in the kernel and cgroups about how a container runs. What happens in effect is that all running containers compete to use the CPU they need irregardless of what this might set.\nSo this patch only tweaks how we can account for CPU usage. Before this patch we were using a constant number for all container tasks. Now we set the number proportional to the memory, which is commonly scaled up or down.\n. @ddollar any feedback on the API?\nrouter.HandleFunc(\"/services/{service}/link\", api(\"service.link\", ServiceLink)).Methods(\"POST\")\nrouter.HandleFunc(\"/services/{service}/link/{app}\", api(\"service.unlink\", ServiceUnlink)).Methods(\"DELETE\")\n. Punting on the winston syslog prefix for now\n. re internal port...\nNot with this patch. I know we discussed a few different ways port mappings are defined in docker-compose and how those could be configured for SSL, but I focused on the simplest case to start.\nSo for now you would have to update the manifest to say 4443:4443, deploy, then you can add the listener.\n. Currently no, though that change shouldn't be too difficult to include in this PR.\nMatt and I went back and forth about this... Is SSL something you configure one-off on your deployed app, or is it something you more explicitly map out in your docker-compose.yml manifest?\nI favored explicit as a way to make it clear that you want both 443 and 80 serving traffic on your app.\n. You don't have to have your app terminate SSL... 443 can serve plain text until you correctly add the ssl cert.\nmain:\n  build: .\n  ports:\n  - 5000:3000\n  - 443:3000\n. It keeps the current behavior. Load balancer listerners are unencrypted by default. convox ssl add changes that listener to an SSL listener.\n. Yeah I understand your confusion. Is anyone other than rack and grid actually doing SSL termination inside the container? \nFor grid at least, I feel like we would do that not for a real development use case, but because we didn't have a good way to install a real certificate on the load balancer.\n. At least I could see some indication that the app wants to do something SSL related. If you saw nothing but port 80 you have no information about SSL.\n. Note: this design was also the first patch to land because its the easiest to implement. Every listener has a conditional based on if a cert is defined for it.\n. Finally, my pipe dream is that convox start can see 443:80 and sets up a dev SSL forwarder. A developer shouldn't have to do the HAProxy junk we do in convox/rack.\n. Works with my simple testing...\nhttp://simple-rails-173749661.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com:5000/assets/application-2d7968994a750350abb50028e047ed290d63c9bac692117bce66d6c43f178800.js\n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. :+1: \nUsing a pipe to indirect around closing is a pattern I've seen a few times now.\n. :+1: \n.

While you are making changes here...\nhttps://github.com/convox/rack/issues/185\nI see that cmd/convox/ssl.go takes the appFlag. Any reason why .convox/app would cause the appFlag to be ignored?\n. Finally, can you submit a documentation change for this?\nAlso while we are making changes here... based on @asyazwan feedback in Slack I also noticed we don't have documentation around the --secure option to SSL.\n. :+1:\nI'm confident our CircleCI integration test will catch any fatal problem with this change.\n.  Improve locking around builds and agent image cleaning\n. LGTM. :+1: \n. This should probably split the Docker stuff out into it's own test server and cycles. This will probably help with the concurrency challenges here.\n. :+1: \n. :+1: LGTM!\nThe manifest fixture diffs are very enlightening, and give me a lot of confidence in the end results of these changes.\n. This didn't end up needing any changes to the lambda handler?\n. This is a really promising PR, I definitely see getting it into the project.\n+1 on the Nat Gateway too. Custom CloudFormation resource is the way to go there. I can help with that part.\n.  Private Rack Servers\n. First tactical question... Can we split this up into smaller chunks to get through somehow? Some strawmen sub projects:\n- [ ] Parameter to make all ELBs internal\n- [ ] Parameters to provision the private subnets, route tables, and associations\n- [ ] Custom resource for VPC NAT Gateways\n- [ ] ...\nIdeally the smaller steps will have some value in their own. But even if they don't, smaller PRs are much easier to manage.\n. Here's some WIP for the Nat Gateway Custom Handler: https://github.com/convox/rack/pull/338\nI'd like some review first, but it'll be safe to get the custom handler bit into master and released first.\n. The NAT handler is released. \nI tried to rebase this PR onto master and had some challenges / questions...\nOne is around ELB public/private logic. Currently we use the manifest port mapping to decide if an ELB is public (80:80) or private (6379). In this mode should all ELBs be private or will there still be some way to make one public?\nI also had a general question around CF dependencies. Some resouces explcitly depend on the subnet or gateway to guarantee that we remove things in the correct order on uninstall. How does DependsOn work with conditional resources?\n. I'm still learning about all the VPC options, but a picture is coming into focus.\n--private adds a 2nd network but retains the public network for internet-facing ELBs.\nRack\n\n[ ] --private flag creates an additional 3 private subnets, gateways and gateway attachments. Default values are 10.0.4.0/24, 10.0.5.0/24, 10.0.6.0/24\n[ ] --subnet{0,1,2}-private-cidr option to customize private subnets values\n[ ] --private flag creates 3 NAT gateways, routes, and elastic IPs \n[ ] when --private, instances and convox ELB are placed in the private subnet\n\nApps\n\n[ ] create and set Private Yes/No Parameter on app template\n[ ] always create ELB in public subnet if service port mapping indicates public (80:80)\n[ ] conditionally create ELB in private subnet if service port mapping indicates private (80) and  Private=Yes\n\nDocs\n\n[ ] document VPC peering\n[ ] document VPN access\n[ ] document Grid access?\n. @cleblanc87 can you use the existing app private port mapping option (single port 80, vs 80:80) to tell your apps to use the private network? If so we continue to use 80:80 to signify making public ELBs\n\nAnd would you be ok with the public network still being there?\n.

We will want to unify the Godeps, but going to punt on it for now and revisit with a Go 1.6 and vendor pass.\n. Lots of good CI runs off this branch now: https://circleci.com/gh/convox/rack/448\n. @xtfxme can you provide some sample data about the different app stack name and tag conventions? \nIdeally I'd like to include some tests around this to prevent any regressions.\n. Some pointers for the Travis test failures...\ncontrollers/apps_test.go uses a testing strategy reminiscent of the ruby VCR gem. The client talks to a mock HTTP server that has expectations around a series of requests coming in and responses that they return.\nYour patch has changed the expected request/response cycles in the controllers/apps_test.go TestAppCreate and TestAppShowWithAppNotFound tests.\nThe TestAppShowWithAppNotFound \"No cycles remaining to replay.\" error means that GET http://convox/apps/bar call now makes one or more additional AWS HTTP calls that the test harness is not expecting.\nLook at the DescribeStackNotFound function in test/aws_cycles.go. That has a single mock CloudFormation call that returns a 'does not exist' 400 for the stack.\nWith your changes, it looks like we now expect 2 CloudFormation calls for the two different stack name format lookups.\nThe TestAppCreate error is similar:\nRequest does not match next cycle.\nCYCLE REQUEST:\nRequestURI: /\nOperation: \nBody: /^Action=CreateStack/\nACTUAL REQUEST:\nRequestURI: /\nOperation: \nBody: Action=DescribeStacks&StackName=application&Version=2010-05-15\nYour change now performs a CF DescribeStacks call first, where before it was expecting a CF CreateStack first.\n. So to fix these tests, you will end up adding at least one more cycle to the aws := test.StubAws() setup in the TestAppShowWithAppNotFound and TestAppCreate test methods.\n. I made some unit tests to help me understand the behavior. Can you copy these onto your branch and review my logic?\ndiff\ndiff --git a/api/models/app_test.go b/api/models/app_test.go\nnew file mode 100644\nindex 0000000..c802922\n--- /dev/null\n+++ b/api/models/app_test.go\n@@ -0,0 +1,48 @@\n+package models_test\n+\n+import (\n+       \"os\"\n+       \"testing\"\n+\n+       \"github.com/convox/rack/api/models\"\n+       \"github.com/stretchr/testify/assert\"\n+)\n+\n+func init() {\n+       os.Setenv(\"RACK\", \"convox-test\")\n+}\n+\n+func TestRackStackName(t *testing.T) {\n+       r := models.App{\n+               Name: \"convox-test\",\n+       }\n+\n+       assert.Equal(t, \"convox-test\", r.StackName())\n+}\n+\n+func TestAppStackName(t *testing.T) {\n+       // unbound app (no rack prefix, no Name tag)\n+       a := models.App{\n+               Name: \"httpd\",\n+               Tags: map[string]string{\n+                       \"Type\":   \"app\",\n+                       \"System\": \"convox\",\n+                       \"Rack\":   \"convox-test\",\n+               },\n+       }\n+\n+       assert.Equal(t, \"httpd\", a.StackName())\n+\n+       // bound app (rack prefix, and Name tag)\n+       a = models.App{\n+               Name: \"httpd\",\n+               Tags: map[string]string{\n+                       \"Name\":   \"httpd\",\n+                       \"Type\":   \"app\",\n+                       \"System\": \"convox\",\n+                       \"Rack\":   \"convox-test\",\n+               },\n+       }\n+\n+       assert.Equal(t, \"convox-test-httpd\", a.StackName())\n+}\n. I have one big stylistic question... What if the prefix is only added for racks where ENV[\"RACK\"] != \"convox\" ?\nThe vast majority of installs will be one \"convox\" stack per region and account, and I've grown quite fond of seeing literal app stack names.\n. Ok, this is pretty close. The issues I see are:\n- [x] Make a call on not prefixing apps associated with a \"convox\" stack. Decision: add prefix everywhere\n- [ ] The TestAppCreate response not returning the logical app name\n- [ ] Do other APIs have the same problem? Is there a way to make App.Name safe to use still?\n- [ ] Changing logic to tighten up the request/response cycles if appropriate\n- [ ] Add some unit tests\n- [ ] Fix failing CI\n. Unfortunately this failed CI: https://circleci.com/gh/convox/rack/457\nIt looks like convox ps isn't doing the right thing:\n+ convox ps --app httpd-457\n+ grep -i PENDING\nERROR: ValidationError: Stack with id httpd-457 does not exist\n    status code: 400, request id: 2e7de641-cf89-11e5-8b6b-99bd8d2754b6\nIt also looks like the CI script is now failing to extract the right URL to test:\n+ convox apps info --app httpd-457\nName       httpd-457\nStatus     running\nRelease    RVFFDCMIDER\nProcesses  web\nEndpoints  convox-457-httpd-457-1246181793.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com:80 (web)\n++ convox apps info --app httpd-457\n++ egrep -o 'httpd.*.amazonaws.com:80'\n+ url=http://httpd-457-1246181793.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com:80\n. I pushed a couple commits to https://github.com/convox/rack/tree/stack-prefixes\n.  rack name app prefix\n. I made a decision, having the prefix on every app name is best for consistency.\n. Yeah if you can change it to add the convox- prefix, that would be appreciated.\n. I still need to review this closely, but I got the tests passing here:\nhttps://github.com/convox/rack/tree/stack-prefixes\nhttps://github.com/convox/rack/commit/13ef519f68a43332ba034ffa46748291ed94a160\n. This is really close! The logic looks really good so final changes are somewhat stylistic. I think it'd be easier to maintain with one more refactor, where all the legacy stuff is encapsulated in methods / tests that we can simply delete at some point in the future.\nSo GetApp() and GetService() inline the happy path, and GetAppUnbound() and GetServiceUnbound() do the special case testing.\nSimilarly TestAppShow() asserts the happy path, and tests like TestAppShowUnbound() assert the special case.\n. Closing in favor of https://github.com/convox/rack/pull/341\n. This looks good for convox start. We also want to set this flag in the ECS task definition. See this issue for more info:\nhttps://github.com/convox/rack/issues/155\n. Are we doing the right thing in CF template and handler with the boolean? Should it be \"true\" and \"false\" or true and false?\n. I just verified that this error is not unique to this branch. Merging and will track down the closed pipe error later.\n. Is this so you can build an app with a Dockerfile that has FROM an-image-in-ecr?\n. Recently Registry login logic was extracted into a models/docker.go AppDockerLogin function, and the responsibility for logging into registries was removed entirely from the cmd/build shim.\nCan that strategy still work for this use case? I think so.\nAnd I think that strategy is correct. The API and Build Service is the best layer to handle secrets and authentication, the cmd/build container can have no secrets and be a dumb docker push/pull pipeline.\n. Does building from images in ECR happen in development too? How are people managing the expiring token in this case? In development, other private registry auth is up to the user to correctly docker login\n. Ok I see. I have one more question with this strategy. Does passing AWS_ACCESS and AWS_SECRET like this pose any security concerns? My general concerns are that this might expose the secrets in the log, process table, and to untrusted things that can execute during the build.\nI do see another strategy where we put this into the Private Registries stuff: https://convox.com/docs/private-registries/\nWe could extend to support ECR, and prompt for IAM creds instead of a username/password\n. Do you want to get this merged for testing as a proof of concept? Or hold back for the convox registries approach?\n. Closing in favor of https://github.com/convox/rack/pull/357\n. It works.

For starters, I'm changing the CI test harness... convox-463-node-workers-463 ->  c463-node-workers-463.\nIn reviewing the problem, the ELB name also takes stuff from the manifest, so even with enforcing the rack name and app name you could still run into problems.\nYes, it makes sense to change the app name validation to account for the convox- prefix we expect in most cases.\nValidating the rack name length probably makes sense too. If someone calls their rack convox-production-microservices they are going to have a bad time.\n. That said, the CF limit for stack names is 128 characters. And it's annoying to worry about rack and app names because of the load balancer limitation.\n. Yeah really seeing that the ELB name format should change...\n. But I'm going to wait and see that this PR passes CI before addressing any more ELB stuff: https://circleci.com/gh/convox/rack/464\n. CI is failing on convox run calls. Investigating... https://circleci.com/gh/convox/rack/464\n. I haven't found a smoking gun yet, but I am seeing 100% failures / inconsistency on this PR where that hasn't been happening on other PRs / releases. I'll have to keep digging in as part of the release process. \nhttps://circleci.com/gh/convox/rack/tree/stack-prefixes\n. @ddollar we could use some design input on the ELB name thing. Is it design goal to preserve the current naming scheme? If not do you have a design proposal for a more robust scheme?\nIf we can change it, this seems like the perfect opportunity to fix this, since this PR introduces a new set of AWS logic for new apps.\n. I fixed up CI some more, then rebased this and ran it to get a clearer picture. This is having consistent problems in us-west but not us-east...\nhttps://circleci.com/gh/convox/rack/495\nhttps://circleci.com/gh/convox/rack/493\n```\n+ convox run --app httpd-495 web echo 'hello world'\n\ngrep 'hello world' ci/track.sh ci/tests/example-app httpd returned exit code 1\n```\n\n```\n+ convox run --app node-workers-495 web echo 'hello world'\n\ngrep 'hello world' ci/track.sh ci/tests/example-app node-workers returned exit code 1\n```\n\nOne big difference between the two regions is that us-east uses ECR, where us-west uses the self-hosted registry. \n. I'm running out of time for today. A next step is to install or update a rack in us-west to 20160213192554-stack-prefixes and see what's up.\n. Good catch. I did suspect there would be subtle breakage now that stack name != app name. Testing it now with formation referencing StackName\n. Still have a problem with build/tag/push/pull on the old registry path:\nhttps://circleci.com/gh/convox/rack/504\n```\nRUNNING: docker tag -f httpd httpd-504/web\nRUNNING: docker tag -f httpd-504/web c504-951219826.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:5000/httpd-504-web:BCWVWPFPUSE\nRUNNING: docker push c504-951219826.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:5000/httpd-504-web:BCWVWPFPUSE\n...\nPushing tag for rev [e2f96ec84f28] on {https://c504-951219826.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:5000/v1/repositories/httpd-504-web/tags/BCWVWPFPUSE}\nPromoting RJSQBERIAGP...

CI passed, so we have confidence that the image name revert is working both in us-east-1 and us-west-2.\n. > Unbound apps will need their CF templates to continue referencing the ELB name in the old way, for all future update operations. Is this correct?\nCorrect. The reason is that preserving ELB config and names is critical to preserve CNames and any extra DNS for existing apps. There are existing backflips around detecting a \"primary process\" to preserve the oldest ELB name convention.\nAs for format, I like: elbName = sprintf(\"%s-%s\", trunc(processName, 23), trunc(sha256(stackName), 7))\nMy argument against a RandomHexDigest app Parameter is that someone could change it and that would cause all the ELBs to get recreated, which would violate the critical nature of ELB names as stated above.\nStack name is immutable over the life of an app. Process name is the logical id for any process type, so if that changes it implies its ok to change the ELB name.\n. While I'm aware of scope creep, the primary process ELB logic has a pretty bad side effect: https://github.com/convox/rack/issues/354\nWe can use this as an opportunity to unwind that too. Apps under this new scheme do not need any special primary process naming logic.\n. I rebased against master and pulled in your changes. Unless I missed something, tests need to be updated again to fix:\n```\ngithub.com/convox/rack/api/models\napi/models/manifest_test.go:54: not enough arguments in call to LoadManifest\napi/models/manifest_test.go:83: not enough arguments in call to LoadManifest\napi/models/manifest_test.go:101: not enough arguments in call to LoadManifest\nFAIL    github.com/convox/rack/api/models [build failed]\nerror: exit status 2\n```\nI would like to update the manifest tests to mostly test the new bound path, but also write at least one for the unbound path to catch regressions.\n. Getting very close... My remaining questions:\n- [x] is cmd/app/main.go ok? DELETED\n- [x] can we finalize on httpd-web-JBVEG3F, where the last part is a short hash of the rack name? NO, see followups\n- [x] why don't the CF outputs reference the balancer resources? NOT POSSIBLE with GetAtt\n. I see, a long app name could be troublesome. Makes sense and hopefully the final detail here!\n. Ok thanks again for your help navigating this subtle decision. I settled on:\n- trunc(app-process), pretty and informative for the majority of apps/manifests\n- hash(rack-app-process), guaranteed unique for every process type\nI also encoded examples into unit tests:\n- foo-web-AH47UEG-i (\"staging\" rack)\n- foo-web-GVPH4YP-i (\"production\" rack)\n- myverylogappname-product-3ILLIA3 (web)\n- myverylogappname-product-TLOC362 (worker)\n- myverylogappname-produ-3ILLIA3-i (web)\n- myverylogappname-produ-TLOC362-i (worker)\nThis scheme should avoid name collision side effects for all manifest inputs.\nIf we ever want to change it again, we can do so by adding another tag to app stacks to branch off of, e.g. ResourceScheme=v2\n. It should also be noted that an 8 GB root partition isn't very much, especially when convox claims 5 GB of that for a swapfile.\n. Without changing the root volume size or swap file size, I can derive some log opts like this:\n3 GB storage / 10 containers -> 300 MB log storage per container.\nSo how about: -log-opt max-file=3 --log-opt max-size=100m\n. Yeah, logs are being immediately shipped to CloudWatch and Kinesis.

If you set that to \"Yes\" many additional Outputs are set, and these values can be copied into convox/rack/.env as environment variables. Then convox start will start a local rack similar to how it runs in AWS. But I don't think it's important for this parameter.\nThis looks like a nice fix for an oversight with DockerImageApi. I'll review this more closely shortly.\n. Thanks! And thanks for figuring this out while docs are still lagging.\nhttps://github.com/convox/rack/issues/203\n. Master is in a bad state due to removing the Encryption param. We can't remove params without a required release that handles it better.\n. The Balancer error comes from going from no Scheme (implicit internet-facing) to an explicit Scheme in kernel.json.\n\"Scheme\": { \"Fn::If\": [ \"PrivateApi\", \"internal\", \"internet-facing\" ] },\nerr, a NoValue might fix this.\nThe app template probably has the same problem.\n. thanks for the tip about formationParameters, I was headed down the wrong path with the blacklist/whitelist.\n. Yes this is exactly what required release is for. We need to get this out everywhere to best handle rack upgrades / rollbacks going forward\n. I think it would be best to carve off some serious sync time to get something like this through, vs doing it peace meal.\n. I'm going to close this now that a big chunk of additional provider interface is landing on https://github.com/convox/rack/pull/530. \nThanks for the initial work here, it's feeling like a massive improvement to the code base.\n. Huge +1 for CI around it. In fact I'd like to include that in this PR if possible. I can add it to the httpd test easy enough if nobody beats me to it.\n. :+1: Thanks.\n. yeah I ponderd this... I was close to putting the success helper in httperr but that didn't seem right.\n. I like moving it all to helpers. I'll tack that on now.\n. ok changed my mind, going to ignore your comment for now. helpers and httperr do need to be reconciled since both have segment and rollbar stuff.\nBut I'll let this bake a bit first and make sure its working and useful, then keep adding more measuring and refactoring the utilities.\n. My own review caught something... need to report a final build success deeper in the build model.\n. This is another factoring smell:\nNotifySuccess(\"build:create\", map[string]string{\"id\": b.Id, \"app\": b.App})\n    fmt.Printf(\"ns=kernel cn=build at=ExecuteRemote state=success step=build.execute app=%q build=%q\\n\", b.App, b.Id)\n    helpers.TrackSuccess(\"Build\", \"ExecuteRemote\")\ntracking / notifying / logging seems ripe for unification\n. Going to try a new release playbook where we don't do a release branch.\nRelease Playbook\n\n[x] Rebase against master\n[x] Pass checks\n[x] Code review\n[x] Merge into master\n[x] Merge other PRs to include in the release (https://github.com/convox/rack/pull/384, https://github.com/convox/rack/pull/380)\n[x] Release master (20160225023225)\n[x] Pass CI (https://circleci.com/gh/convox/rack/575)\n[x] Update dev and testing racks\n[ ] If rack or app formation changes, test upgrade \u2192 re-deploy existing app \u2192 downgrade cycle\n[x] Publish release\n[x] Release CLI (20160225043531)\n\nPublishing a release perhaps should involve merging master into a release branch, and tagging there.\n. I spent a short timebox to see if I could also fix the convox ps --stats hanging bug (https://github.com/convox/rack/issues/355) with no success.\nBut I think the same strategy could help, fetching docker container info up front instead of during the fanout.\n. The outline sounds solid. This is a lot like Anvil, right? That worked very well.  \nI'm having a hard time grokking all the code on my first pass. Seems like getting the details perfect is really important.\nCan you add some tests that demonstrate and validate how the protocol and API works?\nIt doesn't block this strategy, but my idea for efficient data transfer is to use the standard git protocol. We could provision a CodeCommit repo for every app, and use an single httputil.NewSingleHostReverseProxy handler to proxy with the right auth.\n- Extremely efficient transport via the Smart HTTP Git protocol\n- Application data encrypted at rest\n- Standard .gitignore to manage not uploading things\n- Lots of other great git things like making tags\n. This is always my goal too:\n\nlean on some existing, well-established $X\n\nThis protocol and implementation is simple and does have prior art in Anvil so theres no question it works.\nBut if there is a well-established client and server we could use I'll always push for that over writing a custom client and API.\n. If this is an experiment it's ok without tests\n. is there a way to fall back to the tarball path?\n. I think that deserves more consideration... \nThere's an API compatibility issue there (and the version check stuff is removed completely now?) And if a bug shows up in this path, it'd be nice to have the option of going back to the old path\n. Do height and width need defaults for old clients?\nOtherwise :+1: \n. Good idea on --promote. Check out the latest and updated demo output\n. :+1:\nSimple! I will explore some of the build QoS events shortly and make sure we can see  how often and how successful these paths are\n. I don't see this landing any time soon on my account.\nI copied the implementation over to a gist / blog post for future reference.\nhttps://gist.github.com/nzoschke/0cb03d0af0a7f94921ec\nhttps://medium.com/@nzoschke/codecommit-authentication-helper-in-golang-64f0ef42fc61#.4nb28vghf\n. awesome sauce.

The AWS::CloudFormation::Init subsystem lets you set \"Commands\":\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-init.html#aws-resource-init-commands\nSo something like AdditionalBootCommand, ExtraInitCommand or ExtraUserDataCommand could be more clear.\n. Sounds good.\n. set -e was blocking upgrades. I reverted that change.\n. Good call, I try to add a test around this\n. :+1: \nI'm not testing these, simply assuming they are save behind the environment variable.\n. Another question... Certain sets of options parse just fine but eventually end up in a rolled back stack. For example with redis:\n$ convox services create redis --automatic-failover-enabled\n\nAutomatic failover is not supported for T1 and T2 cache node types.\n\nShould the CLI validate these inputs? Or should the template have conditional logic around parameters like AutomaticFailoverEnabled?\n. Yes, we're leaning on CF for everything. It does the initial parameter validation very well. The new errors I saw are more subtle in that the parameters validate, and the stack creation starts, but it fails after a minute into a rollback state.\nStill since the service ends up in a 'failed' state I consider this acceptable for now too.\n```\n$ convox services create redis --multi-az\nCreating redis-4794 (redis: multi-az=\"true\")... ERROR: Options: [MultiAZ] are not supported by this service\n$ convox services create redis --automatic-failover-enabled\nCreating redis-4799 (redis: automatic-failover-enabled=\"true\")... CREATING\n$ convox services\nNAME                    TYPE      STATUS\nredis-4799              redis     failed\n```\n. ElastiCache has the same concept of \"MultiAZ\" even though it's not a literal CF parameter.\n\nIt's tempting to have a --multi-az option that properly configures the CF stack with AutomaticFailoverEnabled and a minimum node type of cache.m3.medium.\n. For redis i'm leaning very strongly towards the single --multi-az since its a first-class citizen across all datastores.\nIf MultiAZ=false, then the default InstanceType=cache.t2.micro and NumCacheClusters=1\nIf MultiAZ=true, then the default InstanceType=cache.m3.medium and NumCacheClusters=2.\nI'm a bit split on the best way to implement this. \nThe CLI or Controller could directly validate or select defaults for the set of MultiAZ, InstanceType and NumCacheClusters but then we move away from letting CloudFormation do everything.\nThe CF template could have some relatively straightforward Conditionals around the MultiAZ parameter. My main question here is how to handle defaults for NumCacheClusters and InstanceType. \n\"NumCacheClusters\": {\n        \"Type\": \"Number\",\n        \"Default\": \"2\",\n        \"Description\": \"If MultiAZ, the number of cache clusters for this replication group. Minimum 2, maximum 5.\"\n      },\n\"InstanceType\": {\n        \"Type\": \"String\",\n        \"Default\": \"cache.t2.micro\",\n        \"Description\": \"The type of instance to use.\"\n      },\nmakes sense as the main default.\n- Should the stack auto-magically pick cache.m3.medium if MultiAZ=true? \n- Or use the instance type and fail unless you explicitly set cache.m3.medium?\n- Or have a MultiAZInstanceType that defaults to cache.m3.medium?\nNot the most important decision either way. Documenting some options.\n. Thanks for your input. multi-az redis is awesome and all motivated by your initial PR. \n. Never mind, I learned in testing that NumCacheClusters can be used without AutomaticFailoverEnabled, so it makes sense to keep them all separate and explicit for now.\n. This is looking good to me. I'm seeing a consistent problem on redis when switching between private not.\n\n17:52:52 UTC-0700 UPDATE_FAILED   AWS::ElastiCache::SubnetGroup   CacheSubnetGroup    The subnet ID subnet-b5578fc3 is in use.\n\nIt rolls back just fine.\nIt works fine on postgres/mysql with an instance replacement.\nUnless an obvious fix appears, I think the redis problem is acceptable for now. The workaround is to create a new redis with --private from the start.\n. For the record, here's how to reproduce the redis rollback:\n$ convox install\n$ convox services create redis --name redis-foo\n$ convox rack params set Private=true\n$ convox services update redis-foo --private\nThe update will roll back because of the subnet is in use error.\n. haven't fully reviewd the sync code, but since its behind the --sync flag :+1: for merging and field testing\n. I tried this and it isn't working for me. Seems like m.Run() blocks so the sync doesn't start.\n. :+1: \n. :+1:\n. If the bucket is not empty, the delete will always fail...\n. Is there another part that empties the bucket contents? I'm not seeing that so I was guessing this delete call would fail.\nGood question about sharing a bucket and using prefixes. 100 isn't very many and seems like a pretty tough limit to get bumped up on AWS. I think we went for it because it was easy and gives lots of isolation between apps.\n. Got it. Closing this and opening a new PR for this and a few other small features to release\n. Closed on https://github.com/convox/rack/pull/488\n. Interesting expectations @anthonyrisinger.\nThere's another possibility which is all the racks registered in your Convox Console\u2122, which is what @awsmsrc is laying the groundwork for.\n. :+1: \n. I understand your use case around reading .auth, and see how that could make more sense than this endpoint if you're not using our console @anthonyrisinger.\nHowever we decided to go with the remote API that returns all the racks for now, and can re-visit any time later.\n. Thanks for this. Looks like a great pass at it. I suspect we'll also need to change the cmd/formation handler for the possible new Custom::ECSTaskDefinition input\n. Took another look and this looks great and is hopefully very close.\nBecause the resource in CloudFormation is a Custom::ECSTaskDefinition, convox has a bit more code that creates the actual TaskDefinition. On first look, I think this won't like the new array input, nor will it create the task definition without the 'sh -c':\nhttps://github.com/convox/rack/blob/master/api/cmd/formation/handler/ecs.go\nThis is a pretty tricky part of the code base. I'd be happy to show you the ropes, or we can discuss a handoff.\n. @soulware awesome.\nI just copied this to https://github.com/convox/rack/tree/command-exec-form and used some internal tools to cut a release from it. You can update your rack with:\n$ convox rack update 20160330143438-command-exec-form\nOr install a new one with\n$ convox install --version 20160330143438-command-exec-form\nIntegration tests are also running against your changes here: https://circleci.com/gh/convox/rack/680\nChanges in this layer aren't the easiest to test yet. Some relevant documentation and tooling is:\nhttps://github.com/convox/rack/blob/master/Development.md#infrastructure-changes\nhttps://github.com/convox/rack/blob/master/Development.md#release-changes-for-convox-rack-update\nhttps://github.com/convox/release\nWhat you can do is build a Lambda compatible .zip file for the custom handler:\n$ cd convox/rack\n$ cd api/cmd/formation\n$ make formation\nThen upload this to an existing Rack or App Lambda function.\nI believe if you upload it to an existing app then try a deploy that changes the task definition you'll hit your changes. If it isn't working, you'll see some errors in CloudFormation for the task definition or CloudWatch Logs for the lambda function.\nThis can be pretty tough to debug so thanks for working on it and providing feedback.\n. Thanks! I'm closing this and opening https://github.com/convox/rack/pull/508 to test/merge/release this patch.\n. :+1:\n. This is great, and fits in with the work here: https://github.com/convox/rack/pull/428\nGood catch on the mysql bool. Yes/No is the better convention, and we can fix that up on mysql too.\n. Actually both postgres and mysql both use \"true\" and \"false\" and pass it straight through as \"MultiAZ\": { \"Ref\": \"MultiAZ\" },\nIt's not clear if \"Yes\" and \"No\" would have the same effect.\n. \"Yes\" and \"No\" do not work:\n19:13:25 UTC-0700   CREATE_FAILED   AWS::RDS::DBInstance    Instance    Encountered unsupported boolean value Yes\n. Also caught this error:\n\nAutomatic failover requires 2 or more cache clusters. Create more cache clusters or disable automatic failover.\n. And this error:\nAutomatic failover is not supported for T1 and T2 cache node types.\n. Just documenting my testing/observations right now. I am planning on cherry-picking just 7b4e829ac76b6516db7857648304b6dc29f2fe9b onto https://github.com/convox/rack/pull/428/files and working there.\n. Thanks for opening this PR. There's a lot of interest around more load balancer options.\n\nSome related issues...\nhttps://github.com/convox/rack/issues/124\nhttps://github.com/convox/rack/issues/320\nhttps://github.com/convox/rack/compare/master...kaaloo:elb-proxy-protocol\n. @kaaloo Are you still working on Proxy Protocol support? I am very tempted to pull both these template changes together and work on a release.\n. Ok, great news about Proxy Protocol. This PR is missing some of the supporting bits that https://github.com/convox/rack/pull/464 has. Namely:\n- [ ] Rebase against master\n- [ ] Template changes reflected in api/models/fixtures/multi_balancer.json and friends\n- [ ] Template changes compiled into api/models/templates.go\n. But a big +1 on introducing the new parameter, while keeping TCP default.\n. Thanks for starting this.

When it builds this patch converts v2 format to our expected v1 Manifest / ManifestEntry format, then passes the classic yaml to the release. Nice patch.\n. This looks good. I'll incorporate it into https://github.com/convox/rack/pull/507 shortly\n. Closing in favor of #530 \n. Awesome. Thanks! Sometime you should document / blog your setup to sleep your cloud :)\nI'll test/merge/release this in https://github.com/convox/rack/pull/509\n. Makes tons of sense. Kernel updates should come with AMI bumps, not randomly at boot.\nThanks for the patch!\nIm closing this and I'll test/merge/release in https://github.com/convox/rack/pull/502\n. Thanks, I'm closing this in favor of https://github.com/convox/rack/pull/508 where I will test/merge/release it.\n.

Docs are published. Always open to more feedback though. http://convox.com/docs/updating-convox/\n. Re-opening to pull in the freshest images...\n. See https://github.com/convox/rack/pull/517 for latest AMIs\n. @mwarkentin I can't point you to a great reference off the top of my head, but in Go its ok and almost encouraged to do a little copy paste and to repeat yourself to have straightforward and self-contained functions. \nThe idea is that its easier for a maintainer to come around and load the entire ManifestEntry.Label concept in her head and make safe modifications when its very procedural like this.\nCertainly factoring out helpers into functions doesn't hurt, but its very different from ruby where metaprogramming can make really short functions with the actual intent and logic tucked away somewhere else.\n. closing and releasing on https://github.com/convox/rack/pull/530\n.

Let me see if I got this straight...\n- When the ASG begins to terminates an instance, a lifecycle hook is delivered to a Lambda function\n- The handler explicitly de-registers the instance from every load balancer\n- No matter what after 5 seconds the handler signals to continue the termination\n- No matter what after 60 seconds the termination continues\n. :+1: \n.

Closing this in favor of https://github.com/convox/rack/pull/539. Thanks for the review / feedback / pairing y'all.\n. @ddollar @awsmsrc  this is ready for review.

That isn't needed unless we use CloudFormation::Init metadata\n- Get rid of the start convox and service docker restart\nSome known regressions with this strategy:\n- Didn't port the conditional around BlankCertificate yet\n- Didn't port InstanceBootCommand or InstanceRunCommand\n- SHOWSTOPPER: /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/90_ecs.cfg boot_cmd is not getting called, so xvdcz is not used\nbash\n[root@ip-10-0-1-206 cloud.cfg.d]# lsblk\nNAME                                                                                     MAJ:MIN   RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT\nxvda                                                                                     202:0      0    8G  0 disk \n\u2514\u2500xvda1                                                                                  202:1      0    8G  0 part /\nxvdb                                                                                     202:16     0    5G  0 disk [SWAP]\nloop0                                                                                      7:0      0  100G  0 loop \n\u2514\u2500docker-202:1-263276-pool                                                               253:0      0  100G  0 dm   \n  \u251c\u2500docker-202:1-263276-823fecfc72e33209b880cb4d61fb3a464211c6c8d906006ac5758cbf3042324c 253:1      0  100G  0 dm   \n  \u251c\u2500docker-202:1-263276-4c22d1ab5cb18c082cc23b80b94e9f2e047aebf7f224777de152c051ce730a3a 253:2      0  100G  0 dm   \n  \u251c\u2500docker-202:1-263276-11e28e31cb1eec551c60e0b3a1248f56426f31a72c5b111ad7752eae6155c830 253:3      0  100G  0 dm   \n  \u2514\u2500docker-202:1-263276-2194103d28d18f4a81f7de0e60000228a490c9ac3575a52148bbec73c0c80541 253:4      0  100G  0 dm   \nloop1                                                                                      7:1      0    2G  0 loop \n\u2514\u2500docker-202:1-263276-pool                                                               253:0      0  100G  0 dm   \n  \u251c\u2500docker-202:1-263276-823fecfc72e33209b880cb4d61fb3a464211c6c8d906006ac5758cbf3042324c 253:1      0  100G  0 dm   \n  \u251c\u2500docker-202:1-263276-4c22d1ab5cb18c082cc23b80b94e9f2e047aebf7f224777de152c051ce730a3a 253:2      0  100G  0 dm   \n  \u251c\u2500docker-202:1-263276-11e28e31cb1eec551c60e0b3a1248f56426f31a72c5b111ad7752eae6155c830 253:3      0  100G  0 dm   \n  \u2514\u2500docker-202:1-263276-2194103d28d18f4a81f7de0e60000228a490c9ac3575a52148bbec73c0c80541 253:4      0  100G  0 dm   \nxvdcz                                                                                    202:26368  0   30G  0 disk\ndiff\ndiff --git a/api/dist/kernel.json b/api/dist/kernel.json\nindex 86529be..26683c3 100644\n--- a/api/dist/kernel.json\n+++ b/api/dist/kernel.json\n@@ -875,55 +875,31 @@\n         \"PlacementTenancy\" : { \"Ref\": \"Tenancy\" },\n         \"SecurityGroups\": [ { \"Ref\": \"SecurityGroup\" } ],\n         \"UserData\": { \"Fn::Base64\":\n-          { \"Fn::Join\": [ \"\\n\", [\n-            \"#cloud-config\",\n-            \"repo_upgrade: all\",\n-            \"repo_upgrade_exclude:\",\n-            \"- kernel*\",\n-            \"packages:\",\n-            \"- aws-cfn-bootstrap\",\n-            \"fs_setup:\",\n-            \"    - device: /dev/xvdb\",\n-            \"      filesystem: swap\",\n-            \"mounts:\",\n-            \"    - ['/dev/xvdb', 'none', 'swap', 'sw', '0', '0']\",\n-            \"bootcmd:\",\n-            { \"Fn::Join\" : [ \" ;

I have to say I'm really underwhelmed by the cloud-init docs. The intro is confusing. Is combining the default behavior? I'm not seeing the combining happen, do I need activate it somehow?\n. Yes, I have an AWS support ticket open around this, pointing to this PR. We'll get it sorted soon enough I'm sure.\n. David had a good idea... We could try to write a file next to/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/90_ecs.cfg` with cfn-init vs specifying cloudinit userdata\n. Ahh, you're probably right.\n. I really don't want to build and maintain custom AMIs if at all possible.\n. I did not as I couldn't grok the cloudinit docs. That pointer looks pretty good, I'll give it a try soon. \n.

In theory \"udp://\" should work too but I haven't tested.\nA simple validation somewhere would be a nice to have, though we have no validation on the papertrail addon.\n. \ud83d\udc4d on shipping experimental features fast and getting feedback.\nI have the same questions about managing the lambda source. But this strategy is good to experiment with.\nAlso same question about multiple lambda functions. Take a look at how the pending syslog stuff will work:\nhttps://github.com/convox/rack/pull/556\nSingle lambda function, then go templating and cloudformation updates to add additional subscriptions on the lambda func. I think the same pattern could apply here.\n. My bad. There's something to think about with CI testing this path...\nBig \ud83d\udc4d on the patch.\n. Released in #575\n.

Ok, I think I'm getting somewhere... These docs are really helpful\n- http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AmazonLinuxAMIBasics.html#CloudInit\n- http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html\nI see some errors around the convox stuff:\n```\n[root@ip-10-0-2-138 log]# tail -10 /var/log/cloud-init-output.log \n  python27-pystache.noarch 0:0.5.3-2.8.amzn1                                    \nComplete!\nCloud-init v. 0.7.6 running 'modules:final' at Fri, 22 Apr 2016 23:27:27 +0000.

I'm going to close this PR, and make a new release that doesn't have AMI changes. Technical AMI discussions can go back on https://github.com/convox/rack/pull/550. CC @awsmsrc @mwarkentin @bobzoller \n. This is an RFC, since Rack events in general are up for design / re-design. With this patch we have 4 event types:\n- build:create success\n- build:create error\n- build:finish success\n- build:finish error\nWe might want to simplify this to:\n- build:start\n- build:complete\n- build:error\n. I'm going to test/release this since its a regression that happened during the build refactor. Re-working all the events can be a follow up.\n. Correction, I just tweaked this to fix the regression. We aren't expecting any build:finish event, but a build:create with an error at the end of the build on failure.\n. Released in #575\n. ## QA\n- [x] test build failed event\n. Got this on CI everywhere:\n\nUploading... ERROR: SignatureDoesNotMatch: The request signature we calculated does not match the signature you provided. Check your key and signing method.\n\nHypothesis is that this is a side effect of not doing Godeps properly. Pulling in d9bfaf2 with the hope it goes away,\n. It did go away with the better godeps commit\n. Thanks! The logrotate.d strategy looks good on first glance. I'll help test.\nDocker logs should already be rotated based on the custom args we pass to the daemon: \n\"echo 'OPTIONS=\\\"${OPTIONS} --log-opt max-file=2 --log-opt max-size=50m --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock  --host=0.0.0.0:2376\\\"' >> /etc/sysconfig/docker\"\n. Closing this since I copied it onto https://github.com/convox/rack/pull/588\nThanks for the spike.\n. cc @mwarkentin @bobzoller and @ddollar for review and testing...\n. ## Amazon Linux 2016.03\nOn April 5th, Amazon sent this announcement:\n\nWe recently released a new Amazon ECS-optimized AMI that includes Amazon Linux 2016.03 and addresses an issue that causes the agent to stop accepting incoming requests.\n\nThis update starts using the amzn-ami-2016.03.a-amazon-ecs-optimized AMIs that are listed on the Launching an Amazon ECS Container Instance docs\nGenerally Convox is fast to follow AMI updates. However the upgrade from Amazon Linux 2015.09 to 2016.03 had system changes that caused some problems with the Convox UserData around restarting the Docker daemon to pick up custom settings. We now configure the instance with CloudInit which offers the ability to write custom Docker settings to the disk earlier in the boot process so they are there when the AMI does the first Docker start.\nThis is all for your information only. This is precisely the type of work we think Convox should sort out so you don't have to.\nThanks a ton to @bobzoller for contributing the original patch and @mwarkentin  for lots of testing.\nSwapSize Parameter\nSwap is now offered on a dedicated 5GB EBS volume. Advanced users can tune the amount of swap with the SwapSize Parameter.\nPrior to this swap was a file on the root partition. In some cases this contributed to instance failures when the root partition is 100% full.\nMost applications should not use swap, but we have seen some large Rails and Python apps benefit greatly from having swap available. To enable swap for an application, run convox env set SWAP=1. \nNote that ECS does not not yet support swap (GitHub issue) but Convox does!\nInstanceRunCommand Parameter\nConvox offers an experimental parameter, InstanceRunCommand, that enables you to customize your cluster without burning custom AMIs. \nYou can use this to install custom packages on every instance:\n$ convox rack params set InstanceRunCommand=\"yum install -y htop\"\nRun a Docker container on every instance:\n$ convox rack params set InstanceRunCommand=\"docker run -d --rm logstash logstash -e 'input { stdin { } } output { stdout { } }'\"\nThis can be extended to even setup complex monitoring tools like DataDog on every instance:\n$ convox rack params set InstanceBootCommand=\"\\\"echo '**** START BOOTSTRAP ***' ; curl -H 'Authorization: token <token>' -H 'Accept: application/vnd.github.v3.raw' -o /tmp/bootstrap.sh -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/repo/master/amazon-linux-ecs-bootstrap.sh ; DATADOG_API_KEY=<key> bash /tmp/bootstrap.sh\\\"\"\nYou do need to be careful about string and shell encoding on with this parameter.\nThanks to @mwarkentin for motivation and testing.\n. If we wrap it in double quotes it mandates that you have to escape double quotes when setting it.\n. @ddollar there should and will be a tool that helps set the right parameter for supported use cases like integrating DataDog and NewRelic server. \nFor now this is experimental and requires good docs and some user knowhow to play with it.\n. @mwarkentin Currently there is no CloudFormation logic to not create the volume and initialize swap if set to 0.\nIf you set the param to 0 you get a rollback:\n1 validation error detected: Value '0' at 'blockDeviceMappings.1.member.ebs.volumeSize' failed to satisfy constraint: Member must have value greater than or equal to 1\nSo the answer to your question is no, there is not a way to eliminate the swap partition right now. You can reduce it to 1GB to minimize the cost.\n. Adding quoting now would technically be a backwards incompatible change as previous UserData implementation also had no quoting.\nThis is a fine design.\nYou get to control one line of cloud-init yaml. CloudInit supports unquoted, \"quoted\" and [argv, style] inputs which are all desirable for various use cases. Removing these options doesn't add any safety, even if we quoted around the input in the template you could still set a cloudformation parameter that doesn't have the proper inner quote escaping. If you get anything wrong it ultimately triggers a safe rollback\n. Thanks for the continued reports... The reboot thing is a bit annoying. In general you don't want to reboot but it shouldn't fail this spectacularly if you do. And the instance failure is a bummer. I haven't looked too closely yet to see how we are faring.\n. \ud83d\udc4d releasing with https://github.com/convox/rack/pull/588\n. \ud83d\udc4d Releasing with #588 \n. If you already know Alpine wont cut it should we not ship that?\nIf I had to make a snap judgement, I'd say Ubuntu 14.04 still has a lot of advantages here:\n- It's a good \"consumer\" distro in general with tons of prior art for running apps\n- ElasticBeanstalk and Heroku use it for Rails\n- Canonical will support the OS until April 2019\n- Docker builds and supports a base image that is 188 MB\nThat said I'm also OK shipping an Alpine based one as I do want to support that in general too.\n.

Closing this and testing/releasing on #668\n. This will be a great enhancement to the installer, thank you!\nYeah requiring a minimum of two instances seems very desirable for now. We could make other enhancements to make a deploy work with a single instance with some downtime, but the focusing on a zero-downtime architecture is best for now.\nI think this should use stdcli.Error(fmt.Errorf(\"instance-count must be greater than 1\")) to exit.\nThe QOS is new, so apologies for the lack of clarity on how to use it, but its mostly for getting unhandled errors into rollbar. In this case your patch cleanly validates a bad input, so it's not an exception.\nThere should be a corresponding validation in the API where you can scale a rack, but that could be handled in another issue / PR. https://github.com/convox/rack/blob/master/api/controllers/system.go#L43 \n. @kmonkeyjam I'll run with this and tweak the cli error and add the API validation too. Thank you so much for your testing, feedback, and patch!\n. Closing this and opening a new PR for test / merge / release. \n. @jordansexton really great feedback about staging environments, thanks.\nThere will always be a strong bias in Convox towards production environments. The goal is to deliver best practices out of the box: no single point of failure, multi-az placement, zero downtime deploys and fully automated deploys.\nThere should also be decreasingly less reasons to not follow the best practices in staging. \nWhat is your staging app footprint and price point? Would 2 t2.nanos make sense? They will cost < $9 / mo. on demand.\nTurning off a staging or dev rack is a good technique. Another way to do this is to set up Scheduled Scaling. Manual modifications to the ASG will be honored independently of the rack InstanceCount parameter.\n. The new default does not automatically change your rack. You will get an error when you try to update:\n\n$ convox rack update\nERROR: ValidationError: Parameter 'InstanceCount' must be a number not less than 2\n  status code: 400, request id: eefc5574-2cf6-11e6-abf1-0179c4f546cf\n\nAs for allowing 1 instance with a big warning, I'm still concerned about other side effects. \nOne side effect I see is that we schedule 2 rack API containers for high availability of the control plane. Without conditionally scaling this down to 1 also, ECS will constantly be churning, and never detect and send notifications when any deployment is complete.\nhttps://github.com/convox/rack/blob/master/api/dist/kernel.json#L1305\nSo I'd like to keep the default at 2 until someone presents a more comprehensive patch that addresses control plane, deployment and notifications challenges with 1 instance.\n. Hey thanks for the initial work and questions!\n\nMy understanding that because I already have pre-existing convox racks, I do not need to run that command at all.\n\nThat is correct. If you have one rack installed and running, you can develop \"against\" that. The docs try to address that here:\n\n\nYou can also use any existing Rack with the caveat that running a local Rack against it could have side effects like terminating instances.\n\ninstead of a git clone pulling the package with go\n\nThat's right. Rack is a Go project, so a working GOPATH and using the go tool is the best way to work with the project.\n\nrunning ... is necessary for the local Rack environment to know about AWS secrets\n\nThat's right, and this snippet is surely some wizardry.\nOn AWS the rack web process is running with a bunch of AWS secrets and resource names in its environment. You can introspect any running process with the convox exec command and its process id, so this snippet figures out the process id and runs env.\nThen you can save this environment to your laptop and start a web binary in development and to make rapid changes locally.\nFinally you tell the convox CLI to talk to your local web server.\n\n\"Rack\" refers to the project name whereas a rack\n\nNaming is hard! I say the project name is convox/rack, following GitHub and Go conventions. \n\"Rack\" is also a code name we use to refer to your AWS VPC, instances and other related resources. Sometimes I refer to this same concept as your \"VPC\" or \"Cluster\".\nI hope that helps a bit. Any feedback on how the Developing.md can be more clear is appreciated.\nI now owe it to you and #622 to better explain how to test building new services locally. Aurora, ElasticSearch and Memcached would be amazing\n. The way to develop new services locally is:\n- Go through the Development Guide to convox start a local Rack API and convox login localhost to get the CLI to talk to it\n- Fork one of the files in api/models/templates/service, i.e. cp redis.tmpl memcache.tmpl\nThen you can iterate around:\n- Change parts of the CloudFormation template to provision your new service.\n- Run make templates to compile your template and reload the development rack API\n- Run convox services create memcache\n- Use the CloudFormation Management Console and events to see errors in creating the service\n. cc @jagtesh, this same procedure applies to the Aurora PR #622\n. No problem, thanks again for the initial patch! :)\n. Closing this and testing / releasing on #686\n. Good catch. Updating again.\n.

It looks like the retry does get triggered and works, but something in the uninstaller still thinks its an error. Investigating... \n. ## Rack Instance Count Validation\nA rack requires at least 2 instances for:\n- Running the rack API in a redundant fashion\n- Spare capacity for a rolling deploy of a web process\n- Service uptime or fast recovery when an instance dies.\nSo if you try running a rack with a single instance, strange side effects happen. Therefore we now prevent the ability to install or scale down a rack to a single instance. \nThanks to @markpundsack for a bug report, and @kmonkeyjam for a bug report and a patch!\nUninstall Robustness\nBased on lots of feedback @nzoschke made convox uninstall much more robust. It now:\n- Requires an explicit rack name and region preventing accidental rack deletion\n- Deletes all services and apps automatically\n- Retries deleting every service, app and rack to work around transient errors\n- Empties and deletes S3 buckets\nWe hope that this makes Convox even easier to experiment with.\nDev Environment Supports More Project Types\n@mattmanning is working hard on improving the convox development environment.\nIn this release, convox start has more smarts for projects with no Dockerfile / docker-compose.yml, and projects with a Procfile. Use convox update to update the CLI for these enhancements.\n. This looks like it'll work but I'd like some more time to test this before releasing since its critical path.\n. Thanks! Going to start testing this now.\n. Closing in favor of #705. Thanks!!\n. This is not working as hoped.

Picking this up again, and on second review I think it's pretty close as-is\n. I think the order of precedence for CONVOX_RACK is incorrect. It should take override ~/.convox/rack as an explicit default for the current terminal session.\n. Rebased and changed the precedence.

Trying to think about what theconvox loginbehavior should be... It could automatically switch to a rack, but it would have to guess which one when logging into console.\n. On second thought... I don't think we need to changeconvox login` behavior right now. \nI don't think too many people are moving between console and a single rack other than for development. So as long as the behavior is coherent for those of us logged into console its a big improvement.\n. This needs documentation. A PS1 helper would be very nice too\n. Docs are here: https://github.com/convox/site/pull/177\n. Closing and testing/releasing on #695. I pushed a patch that fixes tests there.\n. closing and testing/releasing on #713 \n. Looks like a good starting point. The main question is: do we want a ulimit nofile 1024000:1024000 to be the default for the platform?\nI don't see why not... What are the downsides?\n- A single container can exhaust more of the box\n- A fd leaky container will take longer to error\nRight now we're not really expecting Docker or containerization in general to solve any resource contention challenges. Since a VPC is single tenant, it's a feature, not a bug to use up as many resources as you can.\n. Thanks for the patch, going to test/release this on #725\n. \n. Closing this and testing/releasing on #713\n. When going from WebDesiredCount 0 to 1:\n\n. When going from WebDesiredCount 1 to 0:\n\n. CC @mwarkentin @beedub. This feels really good with 0 and -1 options!\n. It's not yet possible to specify count in docker-compose.yml. The label pattern could work here... convox.scale=-1 Though there are some product design questions with this approach.\n. Released. A bugfix found in testing is on #721\n. ## Rack CPU Utilization\nconvox instances was incorrectly calculating 0% CPU Utilization based off the ECS Instances CPU reservation information. We now pull the proper CPU Utilization Average value directly from CloudWatch Metrics:\nbash\n$ convox instances\nID          AGENT  STATUS  STARTED     PS  CPU    MEM  \ni-3a0de2bc  on     active  4 days ago  3   1.27%  7.21%\ni-ff44b863  on     active  5 days ago  2   1.66%  6.41%\ni-d1ec644b  on     active  3 days ago  0   0.29%  0.00%\nThe result of expertly wrapping these low level AWS services is a Convox REST API that is really easy to work with for monitoring and automation:\nbash\n$ convox api get /instances\n[\n  {\n    \"agent\": true,\n    \"cpu\": 0.0123,\n    \"id\": \"i-3a0de2bc\",\n    \"memory\": 0.07212622088655146,\n    \"private-ip\": \"10.0.2.7\",\n    \"processes\": 3,\n    \"public-ip\": \"54.83.186.197\",\n    \"started\": \"2016-05-27T21:31:16Z\",\n    \"status\": \"active\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"agent\": true,\n    \"cpu\": 0.016819999999999998,\n    \"id\": \"i-ff44b863\",\n    \"memory\": 0.0641121963436013,\n    \"private-ip\": \"10.0.1.50\",\n    \"processes\": 2,\n    \"public-ip\": \"54.210.12.112\",\n    \"started\": \"2016-05-27T08:51:08Z\",\n    \"status\": \"active\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"agent\": true,\n    \"cpu\": 0.0028399999999999996,\n    \"id\": \"i-d1ec644b\",\n    \"memory\": 0,\n    \"private-ip\": \"10.0.3.191\",\n    \"processes\": 0,\n    \"public-ip\": \"52.91.82.58\",\n    \"started\": \"2016-05-28T20:39:19Z\",\n    \"status\": \"active\"\n  }\n]\nEC2 Container Registry In Ireland (eu-west-1)\nAWS released its highly scalable, high performance Docker image registry service in Ireland a few weeks ago. Convox users in eu-west-1 will start using it after the next convox rack update and two app deploys.\nWe expect this to be faster and more reliable than the legacy private registry running in your rack. One more region to go (Tokyo ap-northeast-1) before we can remove the legacy private registry for good!\nScale Down to Delete Unneeded ELBs\nIf you scale a web process down to 0, convox retains the ELB so you will keep the same hostname if and when you scale a web process back up to 1 or more.\nThis has an unfortunate side effect of costing some of us $18/mo for an ELB we may not be using. Now you can scale a web process down to -1 to de-provision the ELB and save money:\n```\n$ convox scale web --count=-1\nNAME  DESIRED  RUNNING  MEMORY\nweb   -1       0        256 \n$ convox apps info\nName       httpd\nStatus     running\nRelease    RDJQJEUAPTP\nProcesses  web\nEndpoints  :80 (web)\n```\nAt any time you can scale back up to 0 or more to create a new ELB. The hostname will be different but your service will be back online in minutes.\n. Closing this and will reopen and cut a testing release.\n. You can test applying this to a real rack with convox rack update 20160602001833-ssh_sg\n. Convox should offer a VPC as secure as possible, so this change is definitely in line with that goal.\nIt is possible to specify a custom keypair and use that to SSH directly into the box. But in practice nobody is (or should be doing this) over convox ssh. Perhaps there should be docs somewhere that document this...\nAnyway +1 on the patch. Going to test/release it on #725\n. Testing/merging this on #725\n. Rails looks like this when you scale the database to -1:\n\n. Verified this is working with a branch release. More testing and release on #725\n. Syslog bugfixes and papertrail deprecation has been released. Had success with our customers in migrating from papertrail to syslog. Going to start testing this PR more seriously.\n. Testing update when papertrial is installed:\n```\n$ convox services create papertrail --url logs4.papertrailapp.com:111111\nCreating papertrail-7102 (papertrail: url=\"logs4.papertrailapp.com:111111\")... CREATING\n$ convox services link papertrail-7102 --app httpd-old\nLinked papertrail-7102 to httpd-old\nlink to an app that has kinesis removed\n$ convox services link papertrail-7102 --app httpd\nERROR: response status: 500\n```\n. Updating a rack that removes kinesis when it has a papertrail link cleanly disables the event source in Lambda:\n\nSimilarly deploying an app that removes kinesis disables the event source.\n. Deleting papertrail service with existing links, disabled or not, works fine.\n. convox/agent doesn't try to write to kinesis if a container doesn't have the KINESIS env var set. So its all good for apps / racks with removed kinesis.\n. CI is failing more than I'd like with this release. I just tracked down the probable reason why:\n$ convox run --app httpd-807 web echo \"hello world\"\nhello world\nERROR: API error (404): rpc error: code = 2 desc = \"containerd: container not found\"\n. ## VPC Security Enhancements\nThe Rack VPC Security Group no longer exposes the SSH port to the world (0.0.0.0/0). It now accepts traffic only from inside the Rack VPC, which is sufficient because of the convox instances ssh websocket tunneling.\nThanks @beedub for the security improvement!\nDocker Daemon Changes\nThis week we discovered that Docker 1.11 was surprisingly showing up in production environments, and causing convox run to errantly exit non-zero in some cases. \nThe new update no longer applies updates on boot for anything but critical system security, effctively pinning Docker back to 1.09.\nWe will update Docker to 1.11 along with new ECS AMIs in the near future.\nThis update also changes the Docker Daemon limit for number of open files from 1024 to 1024000. @awsmsrc found a great suggestion for a higher limit by @pahud on Medium as a much better setting for modern web applications.\nPapertrail Deprecation\nIn anticipation of removing Kinesis to save us all money this update blocks convox service create papertrail.\nNow you should use convox services create syslog --url tcp+tls://logs1.papertrailapp.com:12345 to forward logs from CloudWatch Logs to Papertrail via secure syslog. See the Syslog Docs for more information.\nScale Down to Delete Unneded ELBs\n@mwarkentin reported a couple bugs in the new feature that removes unneeded ELBs. You can now run convox scale redis --count=-1 to remove ELBs, even if they are linked to another process. You can also still convox run redis bash even if the process type is not running.\n. Testing / releasing on #725\n. Before this patch you can see lots of updates happening during boot:\n```\n[ec2-user@ip-10-0-3-78 log]$ cat cloud-init-output.log \n...\nLoaded plugins: priorities, update-motd,

Looks good to me. 20 does seem over-provisioned in hind sight\n. This looks good. ECS and Autoscaling are decoupled so I don't see one blocking the other.\nWith the convox configuration, we'll boot 5 new servers and wait for them to be fully initialized and signal back to cloudformation, then terminate 5 old ones.\nThe risk is that all the containers on the 5 old instances will be terminated at roughly the same time. If those 5 instances contain many or all of the web containers for a service, you could have total downtime. This will be temporary as they'll be re-scheduled and boot back up across the cluster in short order.\nSo the InstanceUpdateBatchSize of 1 has a subtle side effect that we'll never take down more than 1 web process per app at a time every.\nWith a setting like InstanceUpdateBatchSize=5, are your critical services scaled up so that losing 5 web containers at a time would be ok?\n. Nice!\nI have some high level questions, as I've intentionally ignored what CPU shares can accomplish on ECS up until now for simplicity sake.\nCan you offer some use cases for setting CPU shares differently among apps and process types?\nHow does settings CPU shares affect the runtime for processes? Do they get throttled or killed if they use too much? \nI believe the total number of CPU shares differs among instance type. Does the process type setting need to take this into account?\n. Some related docs:\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html#container_definition_environment\nhttps://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#cpu-share-constraint\n. Awesome research. Let me try to synthesize what you've found...\nCPU shares are an important concept for apps, particularly for controlling how many cores a container can access / saturate.\nOn ECS, CPU shares are a hard limit for scheduling.\nI don't quite get the Docker CPU shares stuff... My initial reaction is that it doesn't matter, just work with ECS.\n\n\nI do think having this setting, and setting it to a sane default is important though. Without a cpu setting at all, one could launch a process accidentally that saturates cpu and adversely affect every other app and process running in the rack.\n\nI think the default is the main design decision here.\nMy Convox philosophy is sane defaults, then some simple knobs, but let power users do whatever they want with these knobs including shooting yourself in the foot.\nI definitely understand your concern about a process gone wild.\nBut I think that saturating a CPU is actually a feature in a single-tenant system. Squeeze everything you can out of the boxes, and only tune things if you observe quality of service problems.\nThe main justification I see for this default is the ECS API and system itself. For every Task Definition, Memory is required and CPU is not.\nThe next justification is backwards compatibility. If we're not careful the next app deploy for all users will magically have some tight CPU limits. If the default is wrong, we should change it, but probably with a more careful migration strategy.\nSo what if the default was still 0, but your parameterization lands so you and everyone else can start playing with tuning it?\n. Thanks for the default 0 change. We can carry this over the finish line on our end now. The next steps I see are:\n- [x] Development testing and verification\n- [ ] Make a final design decision on CPU / Memory API fields. Will probably aim for minimal changes now\n- [x] Make a call on cleaning up the no-changn client/server pattern\n- [ ] Release checklist\nThanks again @beedub for all the great research and development here!\n. Testing this now, and I'm seeing that the WebCpu parameter is there, and the default of 0 is correct. But I caught that the value isn't actually getting set or updated in the TaskDefinition. \nThis needs a change in the ECS Task Definition custom handler:\nhttps://github.com/convox/rack/blob/master/api/cmd/formation/handler/ecs.go#L400\nI'll make this change, putting notes here for future reference.\n. https://github.com/convox/rack/pull/779/commits/251fc96813c0b6ac77b1f11699e8f0ce3a9b09a4 is testing well with setting the Cpu value on the Task Definition.\n@beedub I noticed that these commits are from Brian Hahn <bhahn@Brians-MacBook-Pro-2.local>, perhaps you want to use a different email for better attribution?\n. Caught another bug, it's valid to scale Cpu back to 0. 0875a752950c8acbc57d748b1b4676995174d959\n. Thanks! Closing this and testing / releasing on #779. Won't release until next week though.\n. Nice, thanks! Is there any wrapping of yaml errors we can do to help users understand what they need to do to make convox start happy? Reformat the go error, link to docs, etc.?\n. This looks great and works well in testing:\n```\nbefore\n$ convox start\nERROR: yaml: line 1: mapping values are not allowed in this context\nafter\n$ convox start\nERROR: Invalid manifest (docker-compose.yml): yaml: line 1: mapping values are not allowed in this context\n```\nClosing this and testing/releasing on #765\n. LGTM, there are a couple other places in example-app where we pipe to grep. Can you apply this pattern there too?\n. Looks good to me. 0 - 65535 was surprising at first but I do like the future proofing.\n. ## Critical Fix For Scaling API\nThere have been 2 reports of inadvertently deleting an ELB when doing a convox scale --memory=X operation on a recent release. \nWe recommend everyone convox update your CLI immediately, and convox rack update at your nearest convenience to avoid this problem.\nWith an older CLI (< 20160529014122) and a newer Rack (>= 20160602143119) doing a convox scale --memory=512 on older clients sends a count=-1 value as a default, triggering the new convox scale --count=-1 feature to intentionally scale down a process and remove its ELB.\nThis release adds a CLI version check to avoid the side effect.\n. This patch is on master but the release got held up in CI due to dependencies. https://github.com/convox/rack/pull/752 has the fix for that.\n. LGTM!\n```\n$ docker pull golang:1.6-alpine\n1.6-alpine: Pulling from library/golang\nfae91920dcd4: Pull complete \n1643141ff185: Pull complete \nbcb80c751035: Pull complete \n8b695b6c4590: Pull complete \nDigest: sha256:11ee357df247baa0fb78818ed92b320e4a026630f305ae12181e0cceddd0fd95\nStatus: Downloaded newer image for golang:1.6-alpine\n$ docker run -it golang:1.6-alpine sh\n/go # apk update && apk add docker && docker --version\nfetch http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.4/main/x86_64/APKINDEX.tar.gz\nfetch http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.4/community/x86_64/APKINDEX.tar.gz\nv3.4.0-12-gbe5bd10 [http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.4/main]\nv3.4.0-11-g04f6468 [http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.4/community]\nOK: 5959 distinct packages available\n(1/13) Installing libmnl (1.0.3-r1)\n(2/13) Installing libnftnl-libs (1.0.5-r0)\n(3/13) Installing iptables (1.6.0-r0)\n(4/13) Installing ca-certificates (20160104-r4)\n(5/13) Installing libssh2 (1.7.0-r0)\n(6/13) Installing libcurl (7.49.1-r0)\n(7/13) Installing expat (2.1.1-r0)\n(8/13) Installing pcre (8.38-r1)\n(9/13) Installing git (2.8.3-r0)\n(10/13) Installing xz-libs (5.2.2-r1)\n(11/13) Installing xz (5.2.2-r1)\n(12/13) Installing libseccomp (2.3.1-r0)\n(13/13) Installing docker (1.11.1-r0)\nExecuting docker-1.11.1-r0.pre-install\nExecuting busybox-1.24.2-r8.trigger\nExecuting ca-certificates-20160104-r4.trigger\nOK: 95 MiB in 24 packages\nDocker version 1.11.1, build v1.11.1\n```\nvs\n```\n$ docker pull golang:1.6.1-alpine\n1.6.1-alpine: Pulling from library/golang\n420890c9e918: Pull complete \na3ed95caeb02: Pull complete \na6999b7fbe20: Pull complete \n8e8a7e133449: Pull complete \nda16fc9fc8e1: Pull complete \nDigest: sha256:2b2efcdd2eeb3405afd5c7146246a48843a7d8d1789564601beecba26a8b1db9\nStatus: Downloaded newer image for golang:1.6.1-alpine\n$ docker run -it golang:1.6.1-alpine sh\n/go # apk update && apk add docker && docker --version\nfetch http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.3/main/x86_64/APKINDEX.tar.gz\nfetch http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.3/community/x86_64/APKINDEX.tar.gz\nv3.3.3-57-gb0ca6a4 [http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.3/main]\nv3.3.3-47-g150c9b2 [http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.3/community]\nOK: 5858 distinct packages available\n(1/11) Installing iptables (1.4.21-r4)\n(2/11) Installing openssl (1.0.2h-r0)\n(3/11) Installing ca-certificates (20160104-r2)\n(4/11) Installing libssh2 (1.6.0-r1)\n(5/11) Installing curl (7.47.0-r0)\n(6/11) Installing expat (2.1.1-r0)\n(7/11) Installing pcre (8.38-r1)\n(8/11) Installing git (2.6.6-r0)\n(9/11) Installing xz-libs (5.2.2-r1)\n(10/11) Installing xz (5.2.2-r1)\n(11/11) Installing docker (1.9.1-r2)\nExecuting docker-1.9.1-r2.pre-install\nExecuting busybox-1.24.1-r7.trigger\nExecuting ca-certificates-20160104-r2.trigger\nOK: 60 MiB in 22 packages\nDocker version 1.9.1, build e463610\n```\n.

In review I did see:\n- [ ] Making a decision about ListPendingProcesses causing an error or not everywhere\n- [ ] Cleaning up some unused stuff like the errch\nIn final review I think ListPendingProcesses should still error and the comment should be updated to reflect this, and the errch stuff is ok to leave in.\n. > Is the design appropriate?\nThe labels to parameters pattern is working out well, so yes I think this is a good design in general.\n+1 to David's suggestion of shortening / combining these as much as possible. \nThe things I see to tune are:\n- Timeout\n- Turn it into a path-based HTTP check\n- Explicitly pick a port if I've mapped many\nSo I propose 3 labels: port, path, and timeout.\nWe already know what container ports should be alive from the port mapping and what protocols the container ports talks from the convox.port.443.protocol=tcp|http and convox.port.443.secure=true labels.\nWe can always pick a naive default of TCP to any port that is exposed.\nHere are some other use cases I see...\nMy app takes a long time to boot so I add a single new label:\nyaml\nweb:\n  labels:\n    - convox.health.timeout=120\n  ports:\n    - 80:5000\nMy service exposes a \"deep\" health check endpoint over HTTP so I add a single new label:\nyaml\nweb:\n  labels:\n    - convox.health.path=/foo\n  ports:\n    - 80:5000\nI'm a total power user and want to assert health on my end-to-end encrypted service (not on the redirect port):\nyaml\nweb:\n  labels:\n    - convox.port.443.protocol=https\n    - convox.port.443.secure=true\n    - convox.health.path=/foo\n    - convox.health.port=5001\n    - convox.health.timeout=120\n  ports:\n    - 80:5000\n    - 443:5001\n. > I'm still a bit unclear about the rules for setting defaults in the cloudformation template according to convox. When does it make sense to specify a default?\nMost parameters need default values. The exceptions are:\n- Convox might supply its own values on every stack update (i.e. rack/app Version parameter)\n- The Parameter has a related Conditional that might toggle something off if the value is empty (i.e. Ami parameter and BlankAmi conditional)\n. > I have an inkling to add or update integration tests but could use some guidance here\nAdding some more YAML -> CF fixtures would be appropriate here. Add something like custom-health.yml that has the new labels to rack/api/models/fixtures, then type make fixtures. It should generate the cloudformation .json.\nThis will require manual verification but once the .json is considered correct but all of us it will help with regression testing and patches going forward.\n. No there is one health check per ELB\nOn Tue, Jun 14, 2016 at 3:54 PM Michael Warkentin notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nIs multiple health checks a thing? It sounds like it from this:\nWe can always pick a naive default of TCP to any port that is exposed.\nJust wondering if that's a valid use case that can somehow be covered.\nWould it be a similar case to the protocol setting? eg.\nconvox.port.443.health.timeout=120?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/convox/rack/pull/755#issuecomment-226040392, or mute\nthe thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe/AAI_0j2IAmrAGPKwuVkezg6Kqt_Kuah7ks5qLzEbgaJpZM4Iz6N4\n.\n. From my playing with ELB it seems like you can specify an HTTP health check endpoint even if the ELB is in TCP mode. So I think the two are decoupled.\n. @beedub a few reasons I have against parameterizing health_threshold, unhealthy_threshold and interval...\n\nGood \"developer experience\" comes from removing complexity and optionality. From my experience, boot timeout is the concept everyone cares about and understands for their app, interval and threshold is implementation details.\nThere is a hard limit of max 60 parameters on every CF stack, and folks that have a bunch of process types are already hitting this. Adding a lot of new parameters could push more apps over the edge.\nThere's always a super dangerous power mode where you can tweak any settings not parameterized on AWS directly. While I don't recommend this in general, it's a great way for us to experiment before making a label / knob something we add to the platform.\n. I think its:\n- TCP to the first port by default\n- HTTP to the first port if there is a .path label\n- HTTPS if there is a .path label and the first port or specified port also has a secure=true label\nSo the convox.port.443.secure and convox.health.port=443 labels are coupled.\nI do have a sense that this is pretty \"clever\", but I think this stuff is pretty tricky in general and we can have validation and feedback on convox start and good tests about yaml -> parameters.\n. You are right, it's the secure label. I'll fix up previous comments for clarity.\n. And you are correct in your last example. The health check will be HTTP:5001/foo\n. I think it could go either way since there's always a mapping. But yeah container port makes more sense there too\n. This looks really nice and is testing well. Closing this and releasing on #765\n. Looks good to me!\n. Working well for me in testing! Closing this and releasing on #765\n. Looks good to me.\n``` bash\n$ cat docker-compose.yml \nweb:\n  image: httpd\n  labels:\n    - convox.cron.myjob=0 * * * ? bin/myjob\n$ convox start\nRUNNING: docker tag -f httpd cron/web\nWarning: '-f' is deprecated, it will be removed soon. See usage.\nweb    | docker run -i --name cron-web cron/web\n```\n``` bash\n$ cat docker-compose.yml \nweb:\n  image: httpd\n  labels:\n    - convox.cron.my_job=0 * * * ? bin/myjob\n$ convox start\n$ convox start\nERROR: Cron task my_job is not valid (cron names can contain only alphanumeric characters and dashes and must be between 4 and 30 characters)\n```\nClosing this and testing/releasing on https://github.com/convox/rack/pull/765\n. This looks good on review. I like the parallelism between the two paths. Eventually we will want to collapse these.\n. ## Convox Start Improvements\n@awsmsrc fixed a few good bugs that have been reported in the convox start development tool.\nThe docker-compose.yml file has improved parsing and validation for labels like convox.cron. And .dockerignore is handled better in development file syncing and uploading during convox build.\nconvox update to get the latest goodies.\n. \ud83d\udc4d looks good to me. Builds / deploys will fail on their app/status lookup, but the logs endpoint will still work.\nWe'll want to continue to tighten the validation of app and rack names -> stacks, but the most bang for the buck will be doing that as part of another provider interface refactor iteration.\n. I did a code review and LGTM except for the commented out tests.\nIt's working just fine here in testing too. Ship it! \ud83d\ude80\n. Looks good to me. I would like to manually test some of the app name related stuff when there is a branch release.\n. My first reaction is surprise to see this in cmd/build/main.go file. I consider that to be as simple of a shell around git pull && docker build as possible and to leave other concerns like background work up to the API.\nThe list 250 and delete anything over 200 is a clever strategy to get around APIs or calls to get the length of the collection and delete things in reverse.\nOne other big gotcha I see is that a build can produce many images (web, worker, redis and postgres). So 200 builds could be more than 500 images and trigger the limits. A couple solutions I see to this is to pick an even smaller max number of builds, or to introspect ECR to see how many images it has and use that as criteria to delete the oldest builds.\n. In my anecdotal experience users care about:\n- The last build in case of emergency rollback\n- The last couple weeks of builds at most behind that\nSo I think 100 would be more than enough.\nIt still really bugs me that AWS is making us pick a number like this. I anticipate some day there will be unlimited images in ECR and we can remove this.\n. This could go in https://github.com/convox/rack/blob/master/api/provider/aws/builds.go#L409\nThat is what the cmd/build calls back into with final build status and logs. \n. \ud83d\udc4d Thanks! Closing this and testing/releasing on #779. Won't release until next week though.\n. I think a copy change is sufficient. But how about something shorter:\n```\n$ convox login --help\nconvox login: log into your convox rack\nUsage:\n  convox login [hostname]\nOptions:\n   --password value, -p value   Console API key or Rack password. If not specified, prompt.\n```\n. Looks like a good start!\n. \ud83d\udc4d Thanks! Closing this and testing/releasing on #779.\n. ## Process CPU Configuration\nThanks to @beedub you can now configure CPU shares for any process type.\nThe default is still the same -- not explicitly changing this setting means that all processes share all of the CPU available on an instance. This is still the sensible default to get the most out of CPUs in the cluster.\nBut the ability to specify this opens up some more powerful use cases.\nIf you set a worker CPU shares to a small number with convox apps params set WorkerCpu=50 it will restrict the amount of CPU -- most importantly the number of CPU cores -- that a single worker can consume. For some apps this is a very good way to assure that the web processes don't get adversely impacted by workers.\nSee #741 for lots of good discussion about the use cases and implementation.\nCustom App Load Balancers Security Groups\nConvox handles provisioning and configuring a load balancer based on the docker-compose.yml port mappings:\nyaml\nweb:\n  image: httpd\n  ports: 80:80\nBy default this load balancer will be exposed to the entire internet. Sometimes we want to tighten this to only allow connections from a single computer or single network.\nYou can now apply additional restrictions to this load balancer by assigning a custom security group to an app:\n``` bash\nget the VPC ID\n$ convox rack\nName     convox\nStatus   running\nVersion  20160615203231\nRegion   us-east-1\nCount    3\nType     t2.large\n$ convox ps --app convox\nID            NAME      RELEASE                  SIZE  STARTED     COMMAND                         \ncde9ac958f36  monitor   20160615203231-20160615  64    4 days ago  /go/bin/init sh -c api/bin/monitor\n1845eb6ec788  registry  20160615203231-20160615  128   1 day ago   /docker-entrypoint.sh           \n79e05a82d06d  registry  20160615203231-20160615  128   4 days ago  /docker-entrypoint.sh           \n541d9b8509cb  web       20160615203231-20160615  128   1 day ago   /go/bin/init sh -c api/bin/web  \ne9fd0ed66d41  web       20160615203231-20160615  128   4 days ago  /go/bin/init sh -c api/bin/web \n$ convox exec 541d9b8509cb env --app convox | grep VPC\nVPC=vpc-f8006b9c\ncreate a new security group\n$ aws ec2 create-security-group --group-name=office --description=\"office network only\" --vpc-id=vpc-f8006b9c\n{\n    \"GroupId\": \"sg-3bdaaf40\"\n}\nrestrict ingress to a single subnet\n$ aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id=sg-3bdaaf40 --protocol=tcp --port=0-65535 --cidr=24.75.239.0/32\napply the security group to the app load balancers\n$ convox apps params set SecurityGroup=sg-3bdaaf40\nUpdating parameters... OK\n```\nAfter this, the service will only be accessable to IPs from the specified subnet, blocking access from the internet at large.\nSee @MiguelMoll's patch on #775 for more information.\nBuild Cleanup\nAWS ECR has a default limit of 500 Docker Images, which you can eventually hit after many builds. Thanks to @awsmsrc on #773, convox now automatically deletes the very oldest builds after a successful new build. This both avoids hitting the service limit and saves money on storage costs.\nAs a reminder, Convox still retains the last 50 builds and releases to facilitate a rollback from a bad release:\n``` bash\n$ convox builds\nID           STATUS    RELEASE      STARTED      ELAPSED  DESC\nBOFEDWPIEEB  complete  RLBTJENIMQI  3 days ago   6s         \nBVFZQPTJJNV  complete  RTAYZHUSGCJ  1 week ago   22s        \nBKYKUURZKQU  complete  RONCLAIMWTP  2 weeks ago  49s        \nBFUOFQOMAFI  complete  RDJQJEUAPTP  2 weeks ago  10s        \nBHGAKQOJCCA  complete  RQOHWZJYDGG  2 weeks ago  5s       \n$ convox releases promote RTAYZHUSGCJ\nPromoting RTAYZHUSGCJ... UPDATING\n```\n. Looks good to me!\n. The refactor looks great.\nI'd like to start getting a bit more prescriptive about including tests with patches. I think provider interface work is the obvious place to start since the TestProvider is there to offer easier testing strategies. \nWant to include some tests with this PR?\n. It looks like you did make templates which compiles memcache.tmpl into the API to get picked up by the CreateDatastore method.\nDid you follow the Development Guide to run a local rack to test these changes? You will need to get some environment from your AWS rack, then convox start the rack API on your laptop, then convox login localhost to get your CLI talking to that. Then you should have the ability to better test convox services create memcache\nhttps://github.com/convox/rack/blob/master/Development.md#local-rack-docker-vm\n. I would expect the 503 to show up in your local development rack logs. I'll give this a quick test locally and see if I can understand what's going on.\n. Here's what I'm seeing:\nbash\n$ cd convox/rack\n$ go install github.com/convox/rack/cmd/convox\n$ convox start\nweb      | time=\"2016-06-27T21:22:26Z\" level=warning msg=\"Template format error: Unresolved resource dependencies [NumCacheNodes] in the Resources block of the template\" at=service.create count#error.user=1 ns=kernel state=error \nweb      | time=\"2016-06-27T21:22:26Z\" level=info msg=\"completed handling request\" count#status4XX=1 measure#web.elapsed=1565.629ms method=POST remote=\"172.17.0.4:58964\" request=\"/services\" status=403 text_status=Forbidden\n$ convox login localhost\n$ convox services create memcached\nCreating memcached-8068 (memcached)...

In testing I encountered one issue. After the first update, 2 out of 3 instances came up without correctly mounting EFS due to DNS problems:\n\nmount.nfs: Failed to resolve server us-east-1b.fs-f223e6bb.efs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com: Name or service not known\n\nWaiting a few minutes and restarting the servers with convox instances keyroll fixed it.\n. this looks great. \n. The strategy of creating a new TaskDefinition is cool. Will this TaskDefinition be used by subsequent runs?\n. Will the temp TaskDefinition cause problems if/when the release is eventually promoted?\n. Testing this now...\n```\n$ convox instances\nID          AGENT  STATUS  STARTED       PS  CPU    MEM \ni-9bb65c04  on     active  20 hours ago  6   2.53%  16.83%\ni-368a19a6  on     active  14 hours ago  1   1.22%  3.21% \ni-d806455e  on     active  7 hours ago   0   0.23%  0.00% \n$ convox instances terminate i-9bb65c04\nSuccessfully sent terminate to instance \"i-9bb65c04\"\n```\nI see this in the API logs:\nweb      | ns=rack.api.cache fn=get collection=\"describeStacks\" key=\"aa0e4695f95e292a93e14fa721b28d9f\" status=miss\nweb      | time=\"2016-07-13T19:05:51Z\" level=info msg=\"started handling request\" method=DELETE remote=\"172.17.0.4:48818\" request=\"/instances/i-9bb65c04\" \nweb      | ns=rack.api.cache fn=set collection=\"describeStacks\" key=\"aa0e4695f95e292a93e14fa721b28d9f\" status=success\nweb      | time=\"2016-07-13T19:05:52Z\" level=info at=instance.delete measure#handler.elapsed=1179.649ms ns=kernel state=success \nweb      | time=\"2016-07-13T19:05:52Z\" level=info msg=\"completed handling request\" count#status2XX=1 measure#web.elapsed=1180.634ms method=DELETE remote=\"172.17.0.4:48818\" request=\"/instances/i-9bb65c04\" status=200 text_status=OK\nAnd this in the AWS Management Console ASG History:\n\nSo this is looking \ud83d\udc4d  to me.\n.

Looks like a bit more to sort out on the javascript side. But it looks really close!.  Agent/Daemon Services. @spencerhakim you're welcome. Here's another branch release for testing: 20170213203215-agent-app. The lambda func is doing better but still seeing an error\n\n. @spencerhakim I believe it's something wrong in the javascript\njs\nfor (let desiredTD of taskDefinitions) {}\n. @spencerhakim doh, a JS error in the array patch:\n\n. You are having a hard time metaprogramming Javascript in Go and Javascript? ;)\nGreat news, with fixing the syntax error, i'm seeing good behavior for the tasks:\nbash\n$ convox api get /instances | jq '.[].id' | xargs -L 1 -I {} convox instances ssh {} 'docker ps | grep agent'\n7028d4aef04b        132866487567.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev-dd-agent-yrcxaksmaj:agent.BUZFXIMKXSQ               \"/entrypoint.sh super\"   35 minutes ago      Up 35 minutes (healthy)   7777/tcp, 8126/tcp, 9001/tcp, 8125/udp             ecs-dev-dd-agent-agent-4-agent-ac95cec0e7a5d7e91500\nf73c8bf259c1        132866487567.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev-dd-agent-yrcxaksmaj:agent.BUZFXIMKXSQ               \"/entrypoint.sh super\"   30 minutes ago      Up 30 minutes (healthy)   7777/tcp, 8126/tcp, 9001/tcp, 8125/udp   ecs-dev-dd-agent-agent-4-agent-80cae9da918bd7995e00\nec5d1f9523b4        132866487567.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev-dd-agent-yrcxaksmaj:agent.BUZFXIMKXSQ               \"/entrypoint.sh super\"   31 minutes ago      Up 31 minutes (healthy)   7777/tcp, 8126/tcp, 9001/tcp, 8125/udp                       ecs-dev-dd-agent-agent-4-agent-90f786fb96b698b92600\n1977d78d815f        132866487567.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev-dd-agent-yrcxaksmaj:agent.BUZFXIMKXSQ               \"/entrypoint.sh super\"   33 minutes ago      Up 33 minutes (healthy)   7777/tcp, 8126/tcp, 9001/tcp, 8125/udp                       ecs-dev-dd-agent-agent-4-agent-90fcc98acbfaf0d94c00\nHowever convox ps only shows one process:\nbash\n$ convox ps\nID            NAME   RELEASE      STARTED         COMMAND\n23bf2da37129  agent  RIMSJFSZHBM  32 minutes ago  supervisord -n -c /etc/dd-agent/supervisor.conf\nAnd docker ps shows that one instance is running two agents.\n$ convox scale agent --count=0 gets us down to 3 processes as expected.. To get agents in convox ps we'll need to add some stuff to ProcessList.\nhttps://github.com/convox/rack/blob/master/provider/aws/processes.go#L148\nThere's a similar todo around getting Cron processes in the list. https://github.com/convox/rack/issues/1844\nYeah I had a similar assumption, that the lambda handler wouldn't start a task if ECS already did. But I can see edge cases here. Default scale 0 when convox.agent=true sounds right.\n. I won't consider the convox ps thing a blocker. We can follow up on that just like cron.\nThe extra process should be addressed.\nI haven't had a chance to look closer at how much effort the code change would be. @spencerhakim have you?. Thank you, i'll test it out again now..

Some next steps:\n\n[ ] Review design of .cache directory\n[ ] QA on Mac. Start and build of a rails app\n[ ] Testing on Windows\n[ ] Testing on Linux\n[ ] Replace shell outs with go code\n.  Build Cache. How does this work with a COPY . /app command?\n\nmyapp/.cache gets picked up in that copy and is noticeably slower on a big gemset.\nAdding .cache/ to .dockerignore means a COPY .cache/build/ /var/cache/build/ doesn't work.\n. @FWMatt that's right, volumes aren't available in Dockerfile and during docker build. So we are experimenting with a bit of external tooling so we can COPY the cache into and out of the build images. QA Checklist\n\n[x] build CLI from build-cache branch\n[x] rails new rails5 --database=postgresql\n[x] convox init generates Dockerfile with build-cache COPY directives\n[x] convox start builds gems\n[x] ~/.convox/ has archive of gems\n[x] Touch Gemfile.lock\n\n[x] convox start re-builds gems instantly due to cache. It's working pretty well for rails. Not so great for node.js. Some things I observed\n\n\nThere is a noticeable delay before the first build output while cache is being moved around. Maybe a friendly build | Copying build cache... message first.\n\nThe myapp/.cache directory can be confusing. @ddollar suggests copying app and cache data together into a /tmp directory to avoid polluting the actual app dir\nOn a node app (ghost-on-heroku), the second build is very slow on the mv /var/cache/build/buildpack/node/node_modules /app/node_modules buildpack step inside the container\n\nThe second build fails with a sh: 1: ncp: not found.  CI errors appearing in rollbar. Also, what about the other things to support this PR:\n\n\n[ ] Console install advanced option\n\n\n[ ] Docs. I don't see why we need RACK_ or CONVOX_ prefixes on any of the EnvVar options. They could be simplified to:\n\n\nEMAIL\n\nPASSWORD\nBUILD_INSTANCE_TYPE\nPRIVATE\nSTACK_NAME\nVERSION\n\nand I'm not sure why BUILD_INSTANCE_TYPE has an EnvVar. Is that just for CI?.

I assumed that the cli library should be like:\nconvox                      -> app template\nconvox help              -> app template\nconvox ps                 -> command template\nconvox ps help         -> command template\nconvox ps stop         -> subcommand template\nconvox ps stop help -> subcommand template\nsurprised to learn that there it isn't like this. I like the direction of this. I can see a comprehensive CLI output testing drive:\n\nBetter user experience\nConsistency / polish of the CLI\nSafer and faster changes to CLI commands\nSafer and faster changes to CLI stdout/stderr formatting\n\nThe various help commands is a nice way to establish coverage since its very user-centric (getting missing, bad or confusing help is not helpful) and doesn't require any test server stuff.\n. It's looking good to me. One more nitpick...\n```\n$ convox -h\nconvox: command-line application management\nUsage:\n  convox  [subcommand] [options...] [args...]\nSubcommands: (convox help )\n  api                  make a rest api call to a convox endpoint\n  ...\n```\nI think the usage string should say \"Commands: (convox help <command>)\" if the main usage string is convox <command> [subcommand]. I think CONVOX_DEBUG is reversed:\n```\n$ CONVOX_DEBUG=true convox releases --app myapp thunk\nconvox releases: list an app's releases\n$ convox releases --app myapp thunk\nERROR: expected 0 arguments; got 1 argument (thunk). Perhaps you meant to use a subcommand or option?\nconvox releases: list an app's releases\n```. Latest changes LGTM. LGTM. @spencerhakim awesome, i'll take a look at this shortly. Thanks for your patience on this @spencerhakim. Code looks good to me. I'll help test and release this from here.. Thanks for your patience on this @spencerhakim. Code looks good to me. I'll help test and release this from here.. LGTM, but it's tricky so let me make sure I understand...\nThe minimum value of CPU shares according to Linux is \"2\", and the max is \"1024\".\nA value of \"2\" means that a container is guaranteed only 2 CPU shares, but can burst up to 1024 shares as long as it doesn't step on other container guarantees. This means that all the containers with a value of \"2\" should be very \"nice\" and not hog CPU resources.\nA value of \"1024\" means that the container is effectively given an entire CPU core. Though Linux still has some rules about two containers with \"1024\" sharing a single core fairly.\nThe value of \"2\" is a reasonable default for every container, unless a user explicitly wants to enable a container to guarantee more CPU resources if there is contention.\nOn one ECS agent, a TD value of \"null\" or \"0\" used to be converted to \"1024\", and a value of \"1\" used to be converted to \"2\".\nOn the latest ECS agent, \"null\", \"0\", \"1\" and \"2\" are converted to \"2\".\nThis logic defaults \"null\", \"0\", \"1\" and \"2\" explicitly to \"2\" to provide the reasonable default for any version of the ECS agent.\n.

Patch looks good. This one should have some careful QA. Perhaps something like:\n\n[ ] On old version, create app and create release (R1) with convox env set FOO=bar\n[ ] Deploy app and verify convox exec env\n[ ] Update rack\n[ ] Verify convox env\n[ ] Create new release (R2) with convox env set FOO=baz\n[ ] Deploy app and verify convox exec env\n[ ] Roll back to R1 and verify convox exec env\n\n[ ] Roll forward to R2 and verify convox exec env.

Closing as this is for a one-off support issue, not to be published.. Closing as this is for a one-off support issue, not to be published.. Wow, thanks for the patch. Going to take a look at this now and get back to you with feedback.. My first impressions of the features here are positive. I get the use cases for the features, and it looks like a strong start for the implementations.\n\nThe main concern is general maintenance. Will these new concepts get used and justify the additional surface area?\nSome things I'd want to do to go forward:\n\nSplit out Service Groups and Secure Env into separate PRs\nReview the changes to the convox ps API for task, container and group. Are there compatibility issues?\nReview the use labels. This pattern is becoming a default implementation strategy for tons of things and doesn't feel great.\nAdd additional tests\nQA the features\n\n@ravenac95 I reached out over email, I hope we can discuss all this over higher bandwidth soon.\n. This looks correct to me. My understaning:\nWith the latest update from AWS we expect to be able to update every lambda function in every region, custom topic or not, to nodejs4.3. Meaning we can take out all the conditional logic around nodejs vs nodejs4.3 as this patch does.\nThese have been sensitive changes, so we should be extra careful in CI and QA, but big \ud83d\udc4d .. Thanks for splitting this out!. Thanks for splitting this out!.

QA Checklist\n\n[ ] Deploy console\n[ ] Publish release\n[ ] Install Rack through Console. Verify AWS Integration permissions allow install.\n[ ] Create an app\n[ ] Deploy an app\n[ ] Get Rack \"AWS/*\" logs\n[ ] Get App \"AWS/*\" logs\n[ ] Look for rate limiting. This approach could be taken much further, putting errors.WithStack() far more places in the code, and doing the stack trace printing much higher in the code.\n\nBut I'm thinking we try just this bit for debugging throttling first.. Didn't end up shipping any logging improvements. However this strategy was adopted by praxis.... This tested well for the httpd app.\nI just realized these don't need to be mappings either since they random/static for every template. But I don't think it hurts to implement them as such..  DoorDash Param Limit. This needs more work because the ports will get re-generated every time.. QA Checklist\n\n[ ] Create / deploy new app\n[ ] See random port number in mapping\n[ ] Re-deploy new app\n\n[ ] See same port number in mapping\n\n\n[ ] Re-deploy existing app\n\n[ ] See existing port parameters copied into mapping\n[ ] Re-deploy existing app\n[ ] See same port numbers in mapping. This needs more work to preserve service ports across an update and deploys. Closing for now..

Closing in favor of a rebased PR.. Thanks, closing this in favor of a rebased PR. Closing in favor of https://github.com/convox/rack/pull/2300. Rack is managed by kernel.json.\nGrid has a manually configured listener per the current SSL setup instructions. When this patch lands add one more line to the grid manifest, deploy, and re-upload a cert.\ndiff\n$ git diff docker-compose.yml\ndiff --git a/docker-compose.yml b/docker-compose.yml\nindex 28948e2..f5e20b2 100644\n--- a/docker-compose.yml\n+++ b/docker-compose.yml\n@@ -14,6 +14,7 @@ web:\n     - GRID_HOST\n   ports:\n     - 80:5000\n+    - 443:5000\n     - 4443\n   command: bin/web\n   volumes:\nYou may need to delete the manual listener first, but CF might do that for you.\n.

Why is this repeated twice?\n. Can we get rid of other helpers too? A quick check shows that \"ingress\" is dead code too.\n. Nice fix. Though this might cause trouble on some non-standard racks. Like demo...\n. nice\n. could/should these be Fn::GetAtt on the Balancer resources?\n. this looks neat! does it eventually give up and error?\n. how long does this functionl take generally?\n. Ah I see how it's reusing {{ $balancer.LoadBalancerName }}.\nI think it'd be a bit more \"correct\" to use Fn::GetAtt DNSName or similar to generate an output. Notice how all the other outputs are intrinsic functions (Fn::GetAtt or Ref).\nBut I also don't see an ELB GetAtt that just gives the name of the load balancer. Can it be inferred from the DNSName?\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/intrinsic-function-reference-getatt.html\n. Awesome.\n. If DNSName to ELB name is not straight foward, then your strategy of copying the LoadBalancerName generator for the output is good. Thanks for looking into it.\n. Great catch, fixed.\n. Really good catch. \n. More idiomatic Go is to put the if and assignment on the same line, and to do the positive condition first to limit the scope of the name variable.\n``` go\nif name, ok := a.Tags[\"Name\"]; ok {\n  return shortNameToStackName(name) \n}\nreturn a.Name\n``\n. why do you look up the app here?\n. the /apps API should still return the logical app name without the stack prefix.\n. I wonder if this is the right order... After this lands, the majority of apps will have the name prefix, so perhaps its more correct to look theconvox-test-bar` stack up first, and do the second lookup as a fallback for legacy apps.\n. Related to the comment in AppCreate, I don't see why POST /apps needs to make more CF calls. It should be able to stick with 2 API calls: CreateAppStack for convox-test-application, and DescribeAppStack for convox-test-application.\n. Ok, I'm starting to see it, based on the TestAppCreateWithAlreadyExistsBound test...\n. Ok I reviewed everything and I think I get it. When a user says create app \"foo\", you want to see if there's an unbound app \"foo\" before creating \"convox-foo\". Can you add a comment or two to this effect?\n. Still could the logic be changed to tighten this up to something like:\ntest.DescribeStackNotFound(\"application\"),           // legacy unbound app check\ntest.CreateAppStackCycle(\"convox-test-application\"), // expected create/describe cycles\ntest.DescribeAppStackCycle(\"convox-test-application\"),\n. I think changing the order would also address up a few of the test cycle questions I have.\n. Could the logic be changed to tighten this up to something like:\ntest.DescribeStackNotFound(\"application\"),\ntest.DescribeAppStackCycle(\"convox-test-application\"),\ntest.CreateAppStackExistsCycle(\"convox-test-application\"),\ntest.DescribeAppStackCycle(\"convox-test-application\"),\n. I'm having a tough time with this function definition. My first impression is that it's hard to know how to use it and what to expect.\n. How about breaking up GetAppFast into smaller and more descriptive functions? Since this lookup is for backwards compatibility only, the call logic could make it more obvious:\n``` go\nif app, err := models.GetAppUnbound(); err != nil {\n  return httperr.Errorf(403, \"there is already a legacy app named %s (%s). We recommend you delete this app and create it again.\", name, app.Status)\n}\nerr := app.Create()\n...\n```\n. GetApp() is a really crucial function, so I'd prefer that it still inlines the logic to prepend the rack name, describe the stack, etc.\nGetAppUnbound() or GetAppLegacy() can duplicate code too.\nAfter all, the long term goal is to return to a single path, which can be as simple as removing the GetAppUnbound() function.\n. Ideally this test case can return a 403 based on a single CF call:\ntest.DescribeAppStackCycle(\"application\")\nThough if it makes a second DescribeStack call that's ok too.\nIt would also make the test clearer to demonstrate that the error string says something about a legacy app.\n. The request cycles look great here.\nIt would also make the test clearer to demonstrate the error string doesn't say anything about a legacy app.\n. This test looks perfect.\n. This should test the happy path, so do a single DescribeAppStackCycle(\"convox-test-bar\").\nIf you want to test the unbound app logic, make another test.\n. this looks perfect\n. this looks perfect\n. perfect\n. Perfect\n. Same with GetService()\n. You're right it's not used. But for now we are copy/pasting the function def from the other handlers that do use this.\n. Yes. That is why we retain the public subnets even in --private-api mode. App ELBs can and will be placed in the public subnets so that we can hit them on the internet and they can route back to our private instances.\n. @ddollar I'm really confused about where/how/why this is used. Can you shed some light? I'm also not sure if we can get away with nil here...\n. Did you intend to remove the tracking here?\n. I'd like to TrackSuccess here too to help measure QoS for this path\n. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_CreateStack.html\n\nA stack name can contain only alphanumeric characters (case sensitive) and hyphens. It must start with an alphabetic character and cannot be longer than 128 characters.\n. instead of regex, can we say something more friendly \"must contain alphanumeric characters and hyphens only\"\n. I believe you can put multiple runs in a test.Runs command. would save a couple lines of code\n. godeps?\n. Ok, I'm going to to a little timebox on SNS while this stuff is still fresh on my mind.\n. This is hooked up to the wrong handler\n. We also have a struct that covers this in client.System. But I think that one is poorly named, so re-introducing a Rack struct is good.\n. Yeah I'd like to link all these to blog posts or other docs which have yet to be written. Is it confusing having these here without supporting context? I'm thinking about dropping this section for now.\n. Thanks. I like Laptop vs AWS\n. You're right. Dropping it\n. Hm, possibly but we'd need a script that makes every instance docker host available on a local port range.\n. Fine with me. Removed the note and will open up an issue on rack to strip out some bits.\n. not available out of a closed beta yet\n. yes, that is at the beginning of Readme.md. This document is for engineers that already understand what Rack is and want to help develop.\n. good catch. thanks\n. Changed to local\n. opened an issue https://github.com/convox/rack/issues/486\n. Thanks. I dropped the \"This is very powerful but...\" part.\n. normalized to \"pull request\"\n. I understand that. If you look at the interface definition its a more agnostic definition:\n\nfunc BuildSave(b *structs.Build, logdir string) error\nThe reason being that this bucket is not available in the environment, it's something different for every app.\nBut on AWS since build has app.Name I can remove this from the definition and do the app and settings bucket lookup in the BuildSave method.\n. Every arg does have a type. If an arg name doesn't have one immediately following it, the closest type to the right of it is its type.\nIt's some sugar so you can do (foo, bar, baz string) instead of (foo string, bar string, baz string).\nSo the idiomatic thing here would be to drop the string after arn and key, since they're all the same type as chain.\n. should this also validateARNFormat?\n. can remove this comment\n. accidental debugging?\n. Yes for reporting. Particularly now that you can specify a time range. \n--since 24h --follow=false | grep 500 | wc\n. From what I can tell we lost this ages ago. There is no CLI or client for this API.\n. I tried that but it didn't work...\n. Nice idea. Can spike that shortly\n. But I do want to bring this back ASAP. Ideally as part of the provider interface.\n. This is an interesting implementation. When we manage lambda functions in other places (papertrail, syslog service, custome handler), we publish zips to our bucket and reference those URLs.\nhttps://github.com/convox/syslog/blob/master/Makefile#L16\n. Another strategy with simpler .js source is to embed it directly in cloudformation. \nhttps://github.com/convox/rack/blob/master/api/dist/kernel.json#L324\n. @ddollar is this intentional? I don't see where its referenced anywhere else\n. n/m I see AWS_ACCOUNT in the Environment.\n. Removed in c1b2f8f\n. @ddollar style tip... it seems like it's more idiomatic to put the error check immediately on the next line.  This helps another developer quickly see that errors are handled\n. no whitespace between the call and the error checking. line 154. \n. is bundle package recommended?\n. I think we should confidently switch back to volumes ASAP. \nDocker for Mac is documented and downloadable as if its in GA: https://beta.docker.com/docs/mac/getting-started/\nI'm testing how fast beta keys get delivered now. Rumor is it should be fast, though it's not yet totally automatic, i've been waiting for 30m now.\nVolumes also work on every other way people are running Docker.\nThe convox sync stuff is very experimental, and people are having real problems with it out in the wild. https://github.com/convox/rack/pull/629\nSo I don't see any harm in this landing ASAP. Skate to where the puck is headed.\n. This osxfs stuff serious engineering and obviously reflects where Docker is putting all their focus: https://beta.docker.com/docs/mac/osxfs/\nThe docs are a lot more clear about the goals and hint at performance:\n\nosxfs provides a close-to-native user experience for bind mounting OS X file system trees into Docker containers.\n\nBut I do see your point.\n- Bind mounts have side effects even if the mac/VM story was flawless.\n- Volumes were simply unusable on the last iteration of these tools, and nobody was admitting it\n- The osxfs stuff needs to be benchmarked\n. Can you offer a design sketch on how the archive and exec APIs can be used to do two-way sync for real world apps and development workflows?\n. Seems like you need to do inotify both on the host and inside the container, which is what osxfs is doing.\n. Maybe you can simplify things by copying files back out after a docker run or ctrl-c.\n. All said right now I'm still in favor of volume mounts and hving Convox init inject files into the project. \nHaving important stuff already in /app/ in the base image causes so many side effects. Volume mounts Dont worj, and I don't have a good way to copy or customize the bin/web script or rails config file if it doesn't fit my app.\nConvox inits job is to look at a code base, and make some guesses about what additional files it needs to run. In the real world every one of these guesses will need to be tweaked. Hard coding these into base images will make that hard.\n. Ah good call on the COPY.\nThere's no reason why either strategy can't work. I think it's a matter of making the decision in a way that's actionable for the rails example to improve and for other language frameworks to get moving.\n. I think that's it. Testing...\n. We don't need to track this as a start exception. It's a well-handled validation now.\n. Ah, well its not a successful start either, so no tracking is required.\n. I think the behavior of a total error of ECS or EC2 API calls fail is ok for now. All the data points to the Docker parts being the main problem.\nThough I think that the best design would be saying the ECS APIs are canonical and even EC2 data is nice to have.\n. Are there particular errors that you found down this path? As this is a pure ECS call, I hope that it's fairly reliable.\nI also think that surfacing pending processes during a deploy is important visibility... Though I'm not sure if a total error would be any better than a process list without pending processes.\n. This looks right. This should definitely be a best effort addition to the process list and not cause a total error.\n. This comment isn't right. From my reading of the code ListPendingProcesses talks to CloudFormation to get all the ECS Service names for a stack, then talks to ECS to describe the services and their deployment status.\nIt doesn't talk to Docker or an individual instance directly.\n. I see that line 282 can return an error. I think this particular function should pick one strategy or another in both places and either log and not error or error. If I had to make the call I'd say it can still error in both places.\n. This looks great.\n. These look good to me. Should we take out the error channel stuff altogether?\n. Looks good to me!\n. You could look at the app stack outputs for something unique like the 'Dashboard' key\n. please aim for consistency in whitespace around error checking. No whitespace is preferred, which you do correctly above.\n. Great validation. Though this makes me wonder: what happens if I set this, then scale my rack instance sizes down a bunch. I think we could do some nominal validation on the rack scale API too.\n. Can we do Default: 0 and always pass it through? I think your logic is correct as-is but not needing a Condition would be simpler.\n. Good catch! I now recall we played with an app-wide Cpu parameter before, but stopped doing that and went back to Cpu=0 everywhere.\n. I took this calculation out recently, and added pulling instance CPU metrics from CloudWatch. \nI think this change back could be good though... There are 2 CPU concepts. How much is reserved due to scheduling and how much is utilized according to the kernel.\nI believe this is similar to the Memory vs Size values in the API.\n. Ah nice, just got to the ClusterCPU, InstanceCPU and ProcessCPU properties.\n. This makes total sense in this patch, but adding some more context while it's fresh... Recently we got bit by the client posting these magic values to indicate no change. A better design would be that the client doesn't post the field at all if it wasn't specified.\n. Nice, I like the message and error code here.\n. This API change looks good to me for backwards compatibility.\n. Food for thought, a while back we discussed a ListOptions struct that would have limit and sort properties.\n. whitespace\n. I like this. Starting to see a pattern with deciding that some Docker API calls aren't important enough to blow up our API call.\n. These look good. It would be useful to have an AMI checklist\n. hard coding this is incorrect. We can get VPCCIDR from the rack environment, which will reflect whatever parameter value was used when installing convox.\n. I see two strategies here.\n1. Use a go template variable and pass os.Getenv(\"VPCCIDR\") into the go template rendering context.\n2. Add VPCCIDR as an app stack cloudformation parameter, and use a cloudformation `{ \"Ref\": \"VPCCIDR\" }'\n. Typo in \"CIRDR\"\n. Change looks good! Great catch.\nMinor style feedback, I'd put this on line 161. That's the set of default static parameters. Notice also those keys are in alphabetical order.\n. nitpick on the whitespace here\n. Good call. One more pass to review validation and to add some tests certainly wouldn't hurt.\n. looks good to me to retain the current run behavior with no release specified\n. How about making this more user friendly... fmt.Errorf(\"Can't find definition for release %s\", releaseId)\n. ah I'm not quite right here, this would be an internal ECS so I think your error is ok\n. this logic is pretty hard to follow. would a label break be more clear?\nhttps://www.goinggo.net/2013/11/label-breaks-in-go.html\n. If the .netrc strategy works, you should be able to remove u.User from the repo url, which would fix https://github.com/convox/rack/issues/833\n. SSH mode does this on line 112\n. is this really the only non /volumes/ mount we expect going forward? I can't think of anything else we explicitly support, just asking out loud. And points to some documentation improvements obviously. Can't find anything about volumes right now.\n. typo on \"contaier\"\n. This comment is very good! The logic described makes sense to me.\n. is there a way to determine this before looping through all the task definitions?\n. some apps could have hundreds of TaskDefinitions from previous deploys. Does this take too long to search? Will the search hit rate limits?\n. This loop is hard for me to follow. From your past comments I was expecting this to be straighforward. The unpromoted release env is applied over the current release env. Finally RELEASE would be explicitly set to the unpromoted release id.\n. Are these needed? I don't see them referenced elsewhere in the patch\n. This reminds me of the recent builds cleanup change. We now only retain the last 50 builds and only list 20 by default.  (We also have a rate limit problem in the build list/cleanup here, which is why its on my mind for this review).\nSo +1 for limiting it to N most recent releases. We only return 20 in the ReleaseList API so that seems like a reasonable number.\n. Do we need to explicitly pass AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE into this helper to make sure we use the profile intended by the user and their active terminal session?\n. These can be deleted if they aren't meaningful moving forward.\n. These are great!\n. I've observed the proxy container hanging around on convox start crashes. Can we address this with a defer or something?\n. might not need these\n. Small go feedback. This could be something simpler like previousCount := \"1\", and I think in general with Go simpler code wins.\n. was -5 a bug?\n. are you intentionally no longer looking up old naming format app stacks?\n. can this use convox/logger?\n. These have been helpful for debugging... The goal is to have a simple rack logs filter we can document so users can understand some internal changes that are executed and why\n. I don't see where these parameters are passed through to the resource creation.\n. Nice, didn't know you could do this! Can you implement it the other way, i.e. resources aliases \"services\"? That'd make convox help bit a bit cleaner\n$ convox help | grep resources\n  services, resources   manage resources [prev. services]\n. not your fault, but I noticed some descriptions have a period and some don't. Can we converge on one pattern?\n. It is a test, but based on the AWS ticket. \nWe observed certs created 30s before the CF stack creation that couldn't be used. \nSo the hypothesis is that adding a sleep will help with IAM delay and let the first deploy work more reliably.\nBut we also have evidence that this may have been a transient error so maybe we don't need it.\n. Not needed for the new approach of deploying the agent as a task. It feels right in general that an instance can manage its own tasks, but I'll remove it for sake of security.. So the input is always in bytes? In that case I'd keep the validation message in bytes too. How about something like:\n\ninvalid mem_limit 2048 bytes (0 MB). Should be either 0 bytes or at least 4000000 bytes (4 MB)\". yeah, print both. I was slightly confused by 200 bytes / 0 MB, it felt like the / meant out of or something. So I recommend parenthesis.. @ddollar changed to /home/convox.\n\nBut /tmp/.convox is persisted across convox starts too.. does this need a sleep or anything?. I think I get it. It echos \"Waiting for network\" once before the yum install. Ah I see even better now from the original PR. It will retry yum install until its successful. We should get this out with the simple polling strategy to start getting some visibility into releases. We will be able to use that data to drive another iteration of release notifications.. don't we have an ID generated at the start of the build?. Good catch. Fixed. Compatibility isn't needed but good looking out.. Nice. Looks better than writing compressed javascript in the CF template. is this encoding ok?. could this all be done as one template function?. is this syntax ok? missing a comma?. wow promises look great here. It is. The code looks as expected in the lambda editor.. Not ok. See syntax error logs below.. unnecessary comments?. which patch did this come in with? might this affect anyone that set up real ssh access?. got it. This is a style call, but this option is parallel to the instance-type option which raises some questions.\n\n[ ] Flag could be build-instance-type\n[ ] EnvVar could be RACK_BUILD_INSTANCE_TYPE\n[ ] Why an EnvVar for this at all?\n[ ] Why do some EnvVars use RACK_ and others don't? \n. I'm guessing it's intentional to not use a build instance only in some regions, and to use different sizes in others? Maybe a comment stating this intent?. Yeah we don't need \"deployment blocked\"\n\nERROR: app foo is still being created, check convox apps info.. same here\nERROR: foo is already updating, check convox apps info. I'd say pick one strategy for building up the test runs. The for loop on 190 is compact, but perhaps too clever to use everywhere. The explicit set of test.ExecRun{} makes it very clear what's going on.. It's unfortunate we need these in every handler. It seems like the CLI framework should be able to handle this in its command parsing / dispatching stuff.\nBut what I do like about this PR is that more comprehensive around the expected CLI output makes the output expectations explicit, which will allow confident changes to the CLI framework now or in the future.\n. My first impression of this output is that it's redundant, because the CLI usage that's printed out should imply the problem.\n$ git init foo bar\nusage: git init [-q | --quiet] [--bare] [--template=<template-directory>] [--shared[=<permissions>]] [<directory>]\nI also like it when we the CLI can hint at something more specific:\n$ heroku app info\n !    `app` is not a heroku command.\n !    Perhaps you meant `api` or `apps`.\n !    See `heroku help` for a list of available commands.\nHowever I do like:\n\nThe consistency\nTests that assert the stderr output. this is really cool. what is this script for?. it seems like we don't need this in the installer. maybe a comment here?. we've had some problems in the past with these types of calls triggering rate limiting.. I think creating a unique log stream for every event is ok.. style: I don't think we need the note. I see\n\n```\n$ convox ps --help\nconvox ps: list an app's processes\nUsage:\n  convox ps  [subcommand]\n```\nI'm not sure what the <command> means here. I think it should just be convox ps [subcommand]. The expected args logic makes sense but I think we should not display the red ERROR warning. It seems unnecessary with good Usage output and can be a bit confusing on its own.\n$ convox ps web --app site-staging\nERROR: expected 0 arguments; got 3 arguments (web --app site-staging). Perhaps you meant to use a subcommand or option?\nconvox ps: list an app's processes. That works, however I'm still seeing the behavior\n$ convox releases --app myapp thunk\nERROR: expected 0 arguments; got 1 argument (ass). Perhaps you meant to use a subcommand or option?. The name started by copying the RegionHasEFS conditional in rack.json.\nI do see how the mapping config makes cleaner CF json.\n@mattmanning we'd still have a conditional like EventRuleForECS that uses Fn::FindInMap.\nSeems like Ami, ThirdAvailabilityZone, EventRuleForECS, EFS, and this Lambda logic could all be in one map.\nWhy do AvailabilityZoneConfig and RegionConfig not cover the same regions?\nI'll take a stab at cleaning this up more.\n. > This conditional seems to suggest that it is whether or not the region allows custom topic updates\nThat is the case.\nWe have always been able to update the runtime attribute of Lambda, and already did so for things like the lifecycle handler in https://github.com/convox/rack/pull/1519/files.\nWe haven't been able to update the runtime attribute of CF custom handlers due to a CloudFormation limitation. That limitation of CF is now gone in some regions.\nWhen it is gone in every region we can remove the mapping and conditional logic altogether, and hardcode 'nodejs4.3' for all lambda functions, custom topics and otherwise.\n. is this missing an error check?. Will this trigger throttling errors on the DescribeStackResources API?. moving this off of DescribeStacks does seem like an improvement. But do you expect DescribeStackResources to throttle instead?\nThere are strategies of caching this stuff on the lambda file system if this isn't good enough.. does the cache key need to know this?. Does the prefix work as expected, i.e convox logs --filter \"AWS/CloudFormation\". I believe this can error if you don't have the right sequence token. Generally you should handle that error specifically and grab a sequence token and retry. Like https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/daemon/logger/awslogs/cloudwatchlogs.go#L382. it looks like this is ok. getAppLogStream creates a new log stream on a new monitor start, but then reuses it for the rest of the monitor life. So the saving of the sequence token is ok.. this name is a bit confusing since this gets and/or creates a log group for an app or a rack. Maybe getOrCreateStackLogStream?. A test for event -> log would be really nice. A test for event -> log would be really nice\n. FYI, we also handle these events on the app level here for processes that have the agent label:\nhttps://github.com/convox/rack/blob/master/api/models/templates/app.tmpl#L749\nCould consider unifying these paths.. The motivation to do this would be to centralize additional ECS API calls and to avoid rate limiting side effects. this lgtm for testing but does it work with no HttpProxy parameter?. needs a space. is there a disk usage or cleanup concern here?. I see a remove later, but should that be a defer()?. ",
    "bobzoller": "@csquared what do you think about this?  extracting a function keeps the logic simple, and you don't need the double terminal.Restore because the one defer covers both cases.\n. I've avoided this by running tutumcloud/logrotate on my custom AMI, but using the docker opts seems much nicer!\n3x100m seems like a lot -- I like your first stab of 2x50m, but I think you could go even lower, like 1x10m (what I use now).  Like other PaaS, shouldn't folks be shipping logs if they want to save them?\n. No problem!  I may push it to my racks and see if it helps with the\ninstance churn this week.

The fix for #200 causes several cache misses (every call to GetApp checks first for app then for rack-app and over time the former will always fail) this was caching failed results and returning them as a success: return s.Output, nil.\n. Wasn't this (DescribeStacks) wrapped by a lock at some point? I know I read some code involving a Mutex but now I can't find it... otherwise isn't there a race to update the cache? Was this removed?\nEDIT: I found it: https://github.com/convox/rack/commit/85fad671eec669f33ec0ec99c1507b3fd3fb4289 as part of #324 I must have saw it in email.\n. I think we'll need to add negative caching to deal with all the misses generated by checking for app instead of rack-app\n. This is based on singleton-notifier branch because I needed the fixes to DescribeStack cache.\nThis patch causes tons of cache misses in the DescribeStack cache... we'll probably need to support negative caching otherwise we'll be undoing the reason for the cache (the constant misses will result in actual API calls).\nIn general, more stuff should be changed to use .StackName methods instead of DescribeStack(shortNameToStackName(name)), but maybe that can wait.\n. Also a couple of open questions:\nLoadBalancerName in app templates use the StackName, which includes the rack prefix... but this makes the ELB name longer than necessary and likely to blow the 32 char limit. New param? Hard code the short name as necessary? Something/nothing else?\nDo certificate names/operations need the full name, or is the short name good enough? eg. ServerCertificateName: aws.String(certName(a.Name, process, port))? Is a.Name good enough or do we need a.StackName()?\n. reopening this against master\n. original: https://github.com/convox/rack/pull/327\n. @nzoschke \nI will use the terms \"unbound\" and \"bound\" to refer to apps and services created before and after this patch, respectively. An unbound app/service does not have a rack prefix.\nIt's not be possible to create unbound apps or services. All new stacks will be prefixed. However, if an unbound app or service already exists, creation will fail to prevent logical duplicates.\nCalls to GetApp(name) and GetService(name) attempt to locate a stack called name before trying rack-name. That is, older, unbound names are preferred to preserve backwards compatibility. If name matches the current rack name, only name will be attempted.\nBound apps and services have an additional Name tag used by the App.StackName() and Service.StackName() methods to determine the fully qualified name. This is the only detectable difference between bound and unbound stacks. As such, using one of these methods is the preferred and safest way to derive the correct stack name.\nPer the last section, app = &models.App{Name: name} is no longer a safe way to interact with App or Service models, you should instead use GetApp or GetService. Tag information is necessary to determine the real .StackName().\nDocker repositories use .StackName() to avoid clashing with similar apps on a different rack.\nEverything needing account-wide uniqueness should also use .StackName().\n. Updated to include prefixes on Certificate names in IAM.\n. @nzoschke YAY I think we're good now!\nA few tests could probably have bound/unbound variants, but that seemed like overkill for first pass and I'm not sure how much real value it would add.\nI added Tags[\"Rack\"] == \"convox-test\" to the appxml to deal with the fact I added the RACK environment variable.\nWe might want to test Tag[\"Name\"] == \"shortname\" at some point, but the various functions around DescribeStacks do not have a concept of short vs. long names, so I left that out.\nLet me know if you need anything else!\n. As is, this patch does not address the concern raised here: https://github.com/convox/rack/issues/200#issuecomment-178661675\nI wasn't sure the best way to handle this (hard code in template, new CF param, something else?). The CF template currently references StackName directly to generate an ELB name, as it did before.\nEDIT: I don't think this is a problem, if only because it has no solution... LoadBalancerName must be unique within the region. Originally I thought some extra randomness was added to the name, making duplicates ok, but only the AWS-generated DNSName has this, not the ELB name itself.\n. Awesome thanks for all the comments, I'll roll in your stuff and make the additional changes.\n. @nzoschke I included your additions, made the updates, then squashed and rebased to master.\nI didn't see your update regarding the prefix, so this iteration special cases the convox rack, the upside to this is (current) default installs will not generate DescribeStack cache misses, ever. I can change it if you decide.\n. Beh I guess I broke stuff, looking\n. I forgot to update the regex in models/app.go:\ngo\nvar regexValidAppName = regexp.MustCompile(`\\A[a-zA-Z][-a-zA-Z0-9]{3,29}\\z`)\nThis should be shortened to only allow 24 chars instead of 29, this gives 7 chars for a rack name + \"-\" + 24 app name = 32 ELB name... should we also enforce short rack names?\n. Could also get fancy and generate the limit, eg. limit = 31 - len(os.Getenv(\"RACK\"))\n. Yeah I read that too... 32 limit seems insanely small to me. Originally I was hoping to keep the ELB name short but it needed the extra info to make it unique within a region. Maybe ELB names should just be completely or partially random instead of using the StackName and whatever else?\n. Also worth noting that a future Route53 integration would be able to mask random ELB names behind pretty CNAMEs.\n. Hrm, not much info as to why. I tried something similar on my dev rack, eg:\n``` shell\nconvox ps --app barebones\nID            NAME  RELEASE      SIZE  STARTED     COMMAND                                   \n48dbca0a7985  main  RZIRJCCRKWC  256   2 days ago  /bin/sh -c 'ncat -l 2000 -k -e /usr/bin/env'\nconvox run --app barebones main echo hello world\nhello world\n```\nWhich seems to be working. My initial guess is it's messing up on there being 3 web processes? I'm currently only testing on a rack with 1 host instance (therefore only 1 app instance) for speed.\n. My suggestion re:ELB names is process-random, eg. api-abcd1234. The randomness could be a new param to the app stack. Future code needing app-specific random bits can use it directly or truncate to an appropriate size. We should use something like sha256(StackName) that can be safely truncated (vs. sha1, which cannot).\nAdding the process name to the beginning makes it easier to identify in your browser and elsewhere. The pseudo-algorithm would look something like elbName = sprintf(\"%s-%s\", trunc(processName, 23), trunc(hashName, 7)).\n. I said random then started talking about hashes... given the general design of what I said above, is it necessary for the random bits to be derived from the app in some way (eg. a hash) or is a real random number fine? Random number as a new param seems the best to me, but maybe there is some benefit from the predictability of hash(StackName).\n. Oh true. Unbound apps will need their CF templates to continue referencing the ELB name in the old way, for all future update operations. Is this correct? A conditional change in how the formation update is created?\n. OK, I must have missed some old registry stuff, I only tested on us-east-1 with ECR.\nOnly thing in the codebase to reference REGISTRY instead of REGISTRY_HOST? Also uses b.App instead of app.StackName():\nhttps://github.com/convox/rack/blob/stack-prefixes/api/models/build.go#L373\nUses r.App instead of app.StackName():\nhttps://github.com/convox/rack/blob/stack-prefixes/api/models/release.go#L300\n. See/pull: https://github.com/xtfxme/rack/commit/1c80668fc484887d3b3bd8be267c657b824f069b\nI think we've been chasing a non-issue. In the original patch, StackName() was added to repo names to ensure uniqueness within the rack... but they were already unique within the rack! non-ECR racks have a dedicated, rack-local registry so there is no need to prefix the names. ECR changes this namespace to global, but since the app CF template provisions new repos by referencing the StackName anyway, everything Just Works. We can remove any notion of prefixing from registry operations since both ECR and non-ECR paths are not subject to namespace collisions.\n. @nzoschke @ddollar please review-and-pull (stack-prefixes branch) to PR: https://github.com/xtfxme/rack/commit/c7497d5c6f0c0df8e4d2064225ca2a9242fc5973\nAdds App.IsBound and preserves current ELB name indefinitely for unbound apps.\nBound app ELB name changes from something like my-what-a-handsome-little-rack-notmain to notmain-S73J3MQ. This suffix is built from base32(sha256(my-what-a-handsome-little-rack))[:7] with a possible -i. The app name can consume the remaining chars, up to the max of 32.\nLet me know if any of this should change!\nThe diff makes it look like I butchered Release.Formation but really I just moved up the call to GetApp and indented the old-ELB \"primary\" related code :-)\n. Truncating the process name can cause a double dash in the ELB name. I don't care, does anyone else?\nOld-style ELB name generation is used even if there are no existing ELB names to actually preserve (eg. app is created but not deployed). Undeployed apps created before a rack upgrade will still use the old naming rules. It's not clear to me if this poses a problem, and changing the behavior means Manifest now has to also care if it's ever been deployed. Seems not worth it to me unless there is some need.\n. Small update: https://github.com/xtfxme/rack/commit/c7497d5c6f0c0df8e4d2064225ca2a9242fc5973\nKeeps the suffix stable (3QVBPWQ):\nEndpoints  main-3QVBPWQ-0000000000.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:2000 (main)\n           notmain-3QVBPWQ-0000000000.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:2000 (notmain)\nInstead of (S73J3MQ and FAAOZR7):\nEndpoints  main-S73J3MQ-0000000000.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:2000 (main)\n           notmain-FAAOZR7-0000000000.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:2000 (notmain)\n. Beh I forgot to update the *_test.go files... I suppose there is no way for me to claim I ran the tests then.\nI can update those tomorrow if not already done.\n. @nzoschke please see: https://github.com/xtfxme/rack/commit/4a3ee2688f55a4715e2a24bbd7f04beec478e20e\nThis only tests the bound variant.\n. @nzoschke https://github.com/xtfxme/rack/commit/dffac3fe0e3d5adc7382d647b97ce91866ad1ca1\nAs discussed on slack but you might want to tweak some. Allows ManifestEntry to carry an App for later use. If the app is nil, then LoadManifest and ManifestEntry methods operate as if the app is unbound (like it used to). If app is not nil, then it's used to determine bound or unbound.\n. I don't like the hash being only the rack name because then its not good enough to \"ensure\" no conflict. How about APP-PROCESS-(hashbase32slice(app.StackName()))?\nThis makes the hash part unlikely to collide with any other app, ever, and also keeps the suffix stable across processes. We can then truncate APP and PROCESS however we like without worry.\n. Eh, the truncate rules would have to favor the process name otherwise app names over 22 chars will cause conflict.\nThe alternative is to go back to an unstable suffix that uses all sources (process, app, rack). Even if the process name is favored, long process names will cause ELB name conflicts.\nThe hash input could be an impossible stack name too, like RACK:APP:PROCESS to prevent collisions from naming variations that match. I don't care too much if the suffix is unique to the process because it will be masked.\n. Also it makes the most sense to me for the suffix to be unique to the process because ELB is inherently a process level thing.\nIt does look pretty when they all match but, shrug, they already have some random number from AWS.\n. Can we make the delimiters something not possible to be in a stack name?\nThese rack-app-procs would hash the same (because part of the app name in one is now part of the proc name in the second, but they are the same hash input) and truncate too early to fix the hash collision:\n```\nrack, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaapp, hai-process\nrack-aaaaaaaaaaaaaapp-B32HASH(rack-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaapp-hai-process)\nrack, aaaaaaaaaaaaaapp-hai, process\nrack-aaaaaaaaaaaaaapp-B32HASH(rack-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaapp-hai-process)\n```\nUsing a delimiter that cannot be in a stack name results in this:\n```\nrack, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaapp, hai-process\nrack-aaaaaaaaaaaaaapp-B32HASH(rack:aaaaaaaaaaaaaaapp:hai-process)\nrack, aaaaaaaaaaaaaapp-hai, process\nrack-aaaaaaaaaaaaaapp-B32HASH(rack:aaaaaaaaaaaaaaapp-hai:process)\n```\nI know it's a little contrived, but it's a possible collision and easy to fix right now.\n. Awesome, once this latest update passes tests/CI I'm pretty sure we are golden! All potential problems I'm aware of have been addressed.\n. :+1: Another job well done.\n. Is there some kind of sync library in Go? eg. an rsync-like thing (or git as previously noted)? It seems unfortunate to not lean on some existing, well-established file transfer proto.\n. There is a small race here on stack delete and emptying the bucket... if it takes a brillion years for cleanupBucket to empty the target bucket, and the stack is dropped really fast, there is a chance the bucket delete will fail with some nonempty error... but that just brings us back to where we are now :-)\n. Is there a reason apps spawn their own S3 buckets instead of using a prefix within a shared rack bucket? The default bucket limit is only 100 and before this patch we bumped that pretty quick just from development churn (add/deleting apps).\n. How long does it take for the other goroutines to clean the bucket? In practice so far it's been trying to drop the bucket long after emptying it, succeeding... I think. I only tried with apps deployed once. I'll look closer tomorrow.\nMaybe apps with many more objects/logs would take too long?\nWhat is the right thing?\n. App.Delete calls cleanupBucket via go a.Cleanup() after a successful DeleteStack call. Since the stack takes time to delete, the goroutines dropping S3 objects seem to have enough time to drain everything before all the other resources in the stack are cleaned up by CF. Cleanup waits for the stack drop (up to 10 minutes) and if it happens, the bucket is dropped then too.\n. I like this ticket but I expected it to list the racks from ~/.convox/auth and/or call DescribeStacks and gather up the Tags['Rack'] from the CF resources. The former would produce a list of racks known to the client and the latter would produce a region-bound list of racks known to the server.\n. Ah it looked just hard coded as a placeholder or something for now. \"Expected\" was only meant to mean \"surprising\" :-)\n(whynotboth)? Dumping from .convox/auth would be pretty useful for us, if not connected to Console. I run jq . ~/.convox/auth so much I have an alias for it.\n. Just leaving it works for me, will update.\nI'll look into options for tagging arbitrary resources as orphaned. Also having a tag for unmanaged would prevent convox from adding orphan flag to resources it does not maintain (like a shared wildcard cert).\nIs there a way to make CF automatically mark resources it unlinked but did not destroy?

Ahh yep, that's got me a couple times now. Maybe the unit or CI tests can just verify all the embedded templates match those on disk.\n. I'm not one of those guise but I think this looks great :-) my only suggestion is to default the local port to the host port so my-postgres.rds.amazon.org:5432 means 5432:my-postgres.rds.amazon.org:5432. This lets people just copy/paste a normal host:port combo and often times the user wants the same port used anyway. I want to say ssh -L works like this but not positive offhand.\n. Yeah that is the reason, I can definitely add more comments.\n. I think you are right. I actually had it this way to begin with, and changed it for some raisin... I think it had something to do with preventing duplicates, but whatever the reason it's a non-issue now. I'll try reversing the order.\n. I'll play around here after doing the reversal. There is still going to be a DescribeStackNotFound if AppCreate continues using GetApp, since that wants to check for both styles... buuut since AppCreate is special, maybe it should simply call DescribeStacks(\"application\") directly and avoid the just as expected cache miss on convox-test-application (you were asked to create it after all!). I'll fix up.\n. Oh good catch, I originally overlooked that as the result of a DescribeStacks call. I'll fix up.\n. Once AppCreate uses DescribeStacks directly, and the un/bound order is swapped, this should fall out.\n. Oh sure. Heh I only changed it so I could use nameTag later... but... a.Name... (doh)! I'll fix up.\n. My first draft had 2 consts in the file for use as flags, but that looked like overkill to me, so I removed them. The only real motivation for the 2 separate definitions is so most code can continue using GetApp but (App|Service)Create specifically can use GetAppFast to avoid cache misses and force query the unbound app first (since bound is done first now). LMK if changes are needed... even to terminology (I'm not sure I care for the un/bound terms, but it works well enough).\n. ",

Any chance we could schedule some time tomorrow to either work through it on Slack or maybe do a hangout/screenshare so I can show you what we've got happening?\n. On the other link you posted AWS said they were running on a custom version of cloud-init - wonder if that was \"pre-merge\"?\n. I saw similar errors on my instances:\n[ 1939.009787] XFS (dm-4): metadata I/O error: block 0x4affd10 (\"xfs_buf_iodone_callbacks\") error 5 numblks 8\n[ 1939.015243] XFS (dm-5): metadata I/O error: block 0x57840b0 (\"xfs_buf_iodone_callbacks\") error 5 numblks 16\n[ 1939.019897] XFS (dm-4): metadata I/O error: block 0x18fff18 (\"xfs_buf_iodone_callbacks\") error 5 numblks 8\n[ 1939.024784] XFS (dm-5): metadata I/O error: block 0x57840c0 (\"xfs_buf_iodone_callbacks\") error 5 numblks 16\n. @nzoschke Updated to remove the container logs.\n. For testing, we can use logrotate -f to force a rotation.\n. Did some debugging on a hangout w/ @nzoschke - turns out our InstanceBootCommand had multiple :s (setting headers in a curl command) - these were inside the yaml for cloud-init, which parsed them as yaml dictionaries. The fix was to wrap the entire boot command in quotes like so: convox rack params set InstanceBootCommand=\"\\\"echo '**** START WAVE BOOTSTRAP ***' ; curl -H 'Authorization: token ...' -H 'Accept: application/vnd.github.v3.raw' ... bash /tmp/bootstrap.sh\\\"\"\nThis should be documented.\nThe other alternative would be for convox to automatically wrap the InstanceBootParam in quotes before injecting into the cloud-init yaml, but this could potentially have some side effects? \n. Small typo on my username here: Thanks a ton to @bobzoller for contributing the original patch and @mwarkenten for lots of testing.\nIs it possible to set SwapSize=0 if I don't need it at all? Not that we necessarily need to do this (though we will likely reduce the size), just curious.\n. Thanks, I'll open a separate issue if that becomes an issue for us. :)\n. Just a bit of further input on the escaping - it can be quite annoying. Previously, if I wanted to update the existing command, I could do a convox rack params to get my existing InstanceBootCommand value, modify it, and then re-set it with convox rack params set .... The key was only worrying about changing the specific bit I was interested in.\nNow when I run convox rack params - I get the command including quotes, but they don't show up as escaped anymore. So I need to modify the command itself, and then also remember to escape the outer quotes, otherwise my entire update will fail (and not in a very obvious way either).\n. Maybe have a way of overriding the port (default to matching port is fine)? I might already have postgres running on 5432 locally (for example).\nEdit: NM, looks like you've got this already.\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. I think this would resolve an issue I just noticed - now that I've removed my volumes setting from docker-compose.yml, my Gemfile.lock doesn't get synced back out into my host. I used to update my Gemfile, and then start convox (which would do a bundle install), and then I could see the changes to the Gemfile.lock on my host, check it into git, etc.\n. As per: https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2016/05/aws-certificate-manager-now-available-in-more-regions/\n. As per: https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2016/05/aws-certificate-manager-now-available-in-more-regions/\n. Actually, I might be seeing an issue - not sure if proxy related at this point. When I convox start with this branch, I'm able to make 1-2 requests to my app, and then requests just seem to hang there.\nWondering if there's an issue w/ proxy keeping a connection open that it's not supposed to or something, and exhausting my puma worker processes? Will try to debug further.\nEdit: Looks like it might've been the URL that I was hitting.. sorry.\n. Right now, at least with default settings, I don't think deploys will work if you don't have the extra instance (as the minimum healthy containers is 100%) - they'll basically just sit there waiting for another instance to place the container. Now that those params are configurable, it might not be an issue (though it still would be with the default settings).\n. Took a quick read through - here are a few questions I had (maybe some more examples of how you'd actually interact with this would help):\n- How do I make a request from my host too foo or bar app? Are those environment variables in the logs set on the host? What do their values look like?\n- The actual linking looks like it would have to be done manually, and possibly in a specific order - I'm not sure how this would react to trying to link an app that's not currently running. My concern here is that devs work on subsets of our apps at once\nDev 1\nWorking on: a1, a2, a3\nRuns (?):\n```\nshell1\ncd a1 && convox start\nshell2\ncd a2 && convox start --link a1\nshell3\ncd a3 && convox start --link a1 --link a2\n```\nDev 2\nWorking on: a1, a4, a5, a6\nRuns (?):\n```\nshell1\ncd a1 && convox start\nshell2\ncd a4 && convox start --link a1\nshell3\ncd a5 && convox start --link a1 --link a4\nshell4\ncd a6 && convox start --link a1 --link a4 --link a5\n```\nThis seems pretty complicated, manual, and error-prone - but I could be misunderstanding how it's meant to be used.\n. Yeah, I don't really think that this is a workable solution for us - many of our apps have both web processes (need to be reachable from host) as well as rpc processes for inter-app communication (communicating between docker containers should work great).\nWith that said, I don't have any specific suggestions at this point - the best I've got right now is being able to specify a unique local port for dev (which gives us multi-app access from the host, fixes port conflicts) and specify a different port to be exposed on the ELB (which we want to be 443 for all of our apps so we can access over HTTPS without specifying a port in our dev/stage/production racks).\nPerhaps that looks something like this in docker-compose.yml:\nyaml\nweb:\n  build: .\n  command: actions/web.sh\n  environment:\n    - DEVELOPMENT_MODE=true\n    - WEB_CONCURRENCY=2\n  labels:\n    - convox.elb.port=443  # Replace 9001 with 443 on the ELB\n    - convox.port.443.protocol=https\n  ports:\n    - 9001:80  # Unique port for local dev\n  links:\n    - redis\nredis:\n  image: convox/redis\n  ports:\n    - 9301\nLooking at this some more, this actually looks like it could be a good solution for our apps rpc communication for local dev (which we haven't needed yet in the first two apps). Need to think on that some more - might not be an issue because we could use unique ports for those already (and I think communicate over the docker network with those ports), since we don't have the 443 requirement that we have for web traffic..\n. That could work... especially if we could encode that in our docker-compose.yml via label or similar...\n. I'll try this out tomorrow, thanks!\n. Something to think about - will this apply to all processes defined in docker-compose.yml? External facing only?\nPerhaps .shift could be a set of key/value pairs so you have control over which processes this is applied to:\n$ echo \"web=20000\" > .convox/shift\nWhat's the thinking behind using the .convox/shift convention vs. something in docker-compose.yml?\n. I'm pretty sure (at least in our case) that we'd like it to be consistent across developer environments (eg. our identity service is running on the same port on all dev machines). If it was done in .convox/shift we'd probably end up checking that into source control.\nIt seems cleaner to me to have it checked in to docker-compose.yml, but that could be dependent on the use case (in our case it would make sense).\nEdit: this would map very closely to our current set up where the unique ports for the web processes are defined in a Procfile in each app.\n. Any chance we could get https://github.com/convox/rack/pull/648 included here? Or are CLI releases handled in a different way?\n. +1 for a PS1 helper.. the question comes up every once in a while and I provide my hacked version using the API. :)\n. Woo, nice!\n. Nice, thanks for looking into this. If there's a test release to try, I can test it out tomorrow.\n. I believe we've already switched all of our papertrail integrations to syslog, but I'll double-check on that.\n. :star:\n. How much will the monthly cost be after this change (estimate)?\n. Neat. That is per rack, correct?\n. I'm \ud83d\udc4d to that as well. Our main concern is when we start to put workers processing asynchronous tasks - we don't want those workers saturating CPU and causing performance issues on web requests, etc. Limiting those workers specifically would be fine for us.\n. @beedub Guess I was thinking about this from the other way around.. but reserving CPU for specific processes (like web) makes sense from a scheduling perspective I suppose.\n. Previous issue: #613 \n. Also wondering what that would look like for TCP health checks? Although maybe the default configuration there is enough and it's the other params that might be interesting to tweak further (timeout, threshold, interval).\n. Oh true, I was thinking that it would be more of a full url, but that makes sense.\n. Is multiple health checks a thing? It sounds like it from this:\n\nWe can always pick a naive default of TCP to any port that is exposed.\n\nJust wondering if that's a valid use case that can somehow be covered. Would it be a similar case to the protocol setting? eg. convox.port.443.health.timeout=120?\n. I'm not sure if I like the health check setting updating the protocol for the port - but there could be some validation if you tried setting it without setting protocol to http/https?\n\nYou tried to set an HTTP health check on a TCP listener. You can change the protocol by adding the following label to docker-compose.yml: convox.port.443.protocol=https\n. Does this wait until the containers are deployed and running on ECS, or just for the ECS deployment to be created?\n. I wonder if we could use stack-level tags instead, to propagate the tags automatically to all sub-resources which support it?\n\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-resource-tags.html\nEdit: Never mind, I see that these are special Name tags, which causes them to be used in various places in the console UI, etc.\n. Small typo in PR title: credtials -> credentials\n. If you do end up doing something like this, we need to be able to pass the --profile option to our AWS CLI to specify the AWS account to be used (we have separate prod / dev accounts).\n. Oh true, that'd work. \ud83d\udc4d \n. @ddollar Just realized something similar for convox uninstall might be useful as well? Easy to port there as well?\n. Any chance you can perhaps implement a verbose sync mode while you're in here for #841? \n. @MiguelMoll Do you have a demo of what this looks like? \ud83d\ude04 \n.

Fixes https://github.com/convox/rack/issues/403\n. What's the difference between this and ports: 8000?\n. Still not sure I'm seeing the use case - is it just to be able to specify a different port to access on the internal LB than the port inside the container? I guess that makes sense to be able to access internal LBs over HTTP(S) without adding a port. \ud83d\udc4d \n. Yes please!

Do we need to worry about older-than-expected clients causing issues after this change?\n. @ddollar Perfect, thanks!\n. @ddollar After doing some further investigation, I think this might be related to the issues we've been seeing as well (have a support ticket opened for it).\nI'm seeing the following in our rack logs:\n2016-10-18T16:08:32Z web:20161006183008/4e93a1642a61 who=\"convox/monitor\" what=\"marked instance i-072306e7c9c8abf58 unhealthy\" why=\"ECS reported agent disconnected\"\n2016-10-18T16:13:32Z web:20161006183008/4e93a1642a61 who=\"convox/monitor\" what=\"marked instance i-0ad5299eee3307320 unhealthy\" why=\"ECS reported agent disconnected\"\n2016-10-18T16:18:32Z web:20161006183008/4e93a1642a61 who=\"convox/monitor\" what=\"marked instance i-033e422c85951c53f unhealthy\" why=\"ECS reported agent disconnected\"\n2016-10-18T16:18:32Z web:20161006183008/4e93a1642a61 who=\"convox/monitor\" what=\"marked instance i-08bc2db4db91e1eaa unhealthy\" why=\"ECS reported agent disconnected\"\n. I think some sort of increased amount of time is important - this has been causing us all sorts of problems with any sort of rack update that requires a new set of instances (rack version updates, AMI changes, changing instance type). It seems (though I don't have hard numbers) that these updates would fail 40-50% of the time after hitting the 15m timeout because 3-4 instances in a row were started and then marked as unhealthy by the convox/monitor process due to the ECS agent being disconnected. Sometimes the rollback would fail for the same reason, and we would have to manually trigger a re-rollback.\nOur workaround for now is going to be disabling the convox/monitor ECS service before running any sort of rack update, but that's pretty hacky.\n. It looks like it also terminated 10 prod instances in an hour last night (we weren't doing anything with the rack - unsure how many of these actually made it into the rack vs. just being terminated after launch):\n$ convox rack logs --filter why --since 12h --rack prod | grep disconnected\n2016-10-19T08:57:27Z web:20161006183008/3bd775cade6a who=\"convox/monitor\" what=\"marked instance i-0923c54d237f89abe unhealthy\" why=\"ECS reported agent disconnected\"\n2016-10-19T09:02:27Z web:20161006183008/3bd775cade6a who=\"convox/monitor\" what=\"marked instance i-0abf44a0a99084b58 unhealthy\" why=\"ECS reported agent disconnected\"\n2016-10-19T09:07:27Z web:20161006183008/3bd775cade6a who=\"convox/monitor\" what=\"marked instance i-09b056533d0008827 unhealthy\" why=\"ECS reported agent disconnected\"\n2016-10-19T09:12:27Z web:20161006183008/3bd775cade6a who=\"convox/monitor\" what=\"marked instance i-00cfd8196fcb03474 unhealthy\" why=\"ECS reported agent disconnected\"\n2016-10-19T09:17:27Z web:20161006183008/3bd775cade6a who=\"convox/monitor\" what=\"marked instance i-05a365c86303b8eb0 unhealthy\" why=\"ECS reported agent disconnected\"\n2016-10-19T09:22:27Z web:20161006183008/3bd775cade6a who=\"convox/monitor\" what=\"marked instance i-03331cfd11a501746 unhealthy\" why=\"ECS reported agent disconnected\"\n2016-10-19T09:27:27Z web:20161006183008/3bd775cade6a who=\"convox/monitor\" what=\"marked instance i-0e94d698ee4cbbd02 unhealthy\" why=\"ECS reported agent disconnected\"\n2016-10-19T09:32:27Z web:20161006183008/3bd775cade6a who=\"convox/monitor\" what=\"marked instance i-08b0a28343ce0eead unhealthy\" why=\"ECS reported agent disconnected\"\n2016-10-19T09:37:27Z web:20161006183008/3bd775cade6a who=\"convox/monitor\" what=\"marked instance i-06a4e1f43137ff496 unhealthy\" why=\"ECS reported agent disconnected\"\n2016-10-19T09:42:27Z web:20161006183008/3bd775cade6a who=\"convox/monitor\" what=\"marked instance i-02516120c813898d4 unhealthy\" why=\"ECS reported agent disconnected\"\nIt's also weird that these are all exactly 5 minutes apart.. not sure what might be the cause of that.\n. @awsmsrc Any thoughts on if this could potentially handle something like https://github.com/convox/rack/issues/827 as well?\n. @MiguelMoll Ignoring whitespace makes this diff a lot easier to read: https://github.com/convox/rack/pull/1357/files?w=1\n:).

Thanks!. Awesome! Would it make any sense to make this a configurable parameter on the rack? If it can count the number of times it's seen an instance, then it could be set to 2 which would be equivalent to this, or a higher number if it turns out that we need or want something else?. Also, if a heartbeat is missed, but then another is successful, it should probably \"reset\" the counter. If I miss a heartbeat, and then miss one more 60m later, the instance shouldn't be terminated (not sure if this would happen here, but I think so).. Perfect, wasn't sure if that delete() call was what was terminating the instance, thanks!. Rack parameters are defined here: https://github.com/convox/rack/blob/master/provider/aws/dist/rack.json#L164-L341\nNot sure what the mechanism for passing that through to get to your code would be.. @awsmsrc Awesome, I think this will be helpful.\nAny thoughts on if it would make sense to indicate which instance a process is running on as well? \nUse case:\nWe're running our rack on T2s, and sometimes we have an instance that has a bunch of processes running on it which is using up its credits, and we have another instance with barely any processes. I was trying to figure out which process for an app was running on the busy service, so I could stop it and (maybe) reschedule it onto another instance, but I couldn't map the convox process IDs to the processes in the AWS console to figure out which is which.. Interesting, thanks!. Thanks for catching those issues! \ud83d\ude04 . Interesting! Eventually maybe the implementation can be swapped out with the native ECS daemon functionality that's being added.\nHow does this look from a convox scale perspective? Will that show you how many processes are running? Is scaling the count of processes disabled for daemons?. Looking forward to CodeBuild support. \ud83d\ude04 . docker version or golang version?. Ah yes, python and ruby images just upgraded to alpine 3.5 as well.. Do you set CONVOX_WAIT=true or something else?. It might be an issue if \"delete and recreate\" is the solution here (eg. for RDS).. Not sure if it would make sense to look at https://github.com/convox/rack/issues/1560 while you're in here?. \ud83c\udf89 . @mattmanning @MiguelMoll Added a small make function that I thought might be helpful for stuff like this: https://github.com/convox/rack/pull/1640\nIf someone's able to figure out how to use sed to update rack.json automatically that might be nicer. :).

Does this handle what we need, or would there still be a potential of moving to that at some point?. Woah, nice. \ud83d\udc4d. @nzoschke Might be good to have some sort of \"Limits\" documentation (similar to AWS Service Limit documentation) - not sure if there are other limits that convox users might run into, but it could be good to have a place where it explains that there's a limit of 30 processes (or whatever it is now), along with an explanation of the AWS constraints that cause that limit.. @swerling @mattmanning We're seeing some CPU usage issues with some of our larger apps as developers migrate to them - wondering if this will help. Is there a binary we could test out?\nEdit: Apparently just building convox on OSX using go get github.com/convox/rack/cmd/convox allows it to use inotify and has had a drastic improvement on developer machine CPU usage.. @MiguelMoll @ddollar We're still seeing 502s on builds - the errors seems to line up with the following errors in the console app:\n2017-08-04T14:29:57Z web:RATXOULGFHD/fca1fd11e9a4 2017/08/04 14:29:57 http: proxy error: EOF\n2017-08-04T14:32:57Z web:RATXOULGFHD/5ec24450fc73 2017/08/04 14:32:57 http: proxy error: EOF. @ddollar any chance of cutting a test release for this?

Requiring 2 instances for a tiny app seems heavy handed, and I haven't had any issues with needing to stop tasks when deploying.\nEdit: This is especially true for staging environments where zero downtime updates are not important. Wouldn't it be possible to simply warn on < 2 instances rather than error?\n. This is also a problem:\nconvox rack scale --count 0\nERROR: count must be greater than 1\nThere's no way to just scale a rack off now (also useful for staging environments). In short, this minimum of 2 only applies to production deployments.\n. The params of the CFT are also validated, preventing it from being scaled down without the CLI.\n\n. @nzoschke Thanks for the detailed response, and that's a good point about scheduled scaling. It's something that could probably work for us if we tweak our workflow a bit.\nHowever, would it be a problem to allow overriding the minimum if desired? I definitely understand the focus on production environments, but why not default to >= 2 instances, but still allow < 2 and just insert a descriptive (and perhaps scary) warning?\nI suppose the default of 2 means that existing deployments (like our staging env) go up to 2 instances when upgraded, but it would be nice to be able to just scale the rack down to 1 or 0 rather than rely on scheduling.

Merged via #801 \n. ## Upgrade to docker 1.11\nWith Docker finally removing the -f option (thanks to @asyazwan for bringing it to our attention with #781), we decided the best route is to upgrade to Docker 1.11.\nThis includes the the alpine imaged used by rack itself but also an AMI optimize for ECS Instances:\n```\nThe current Amazon ECS-optimized AMI (amzn-ami-2016.03.c-amazon-ecs-optimized) consists of:\nThe latest minimal version of the Amazon Linux AMI\nThe latest version of the Amazon ECS container agent (1.10.0)\nThe recommended version of Docker for the latest Amazon ECS container agent (1.11.1)\nThe latest version of the ecs-init package to run and monitor the Amazon ECS agent (1.10.0-1)\n```\nSee PR #797 for more information.\nProcess CPU Configuration\nThanks to @beedub you can now configure CPU shares for any process type.\nThe default is still the same -- not explicitly changing this setting means that all processes share all of the CPU available on an instance. This is still the sensible default to get the most out of CPUs in the cluster.\nBut the ability to specify this opens up some more powerful use cases. You'd be able to set the number of CPU units to reserve for for a process. \nFor example, if you run a single-container web process on a single-core instance type with 512 CPU units specified for that container, and that is the only task running on the container instance, that container could use the full 1,024 CPU unit share at any given time. However, if you launched another copy of the same web process on that container instance, each task would be guaranteed a minimum of 512 CPU units when needed, and each container could float to higher CPU usage if the other container was not using it, but if both tasks were 100% active all of the time, they would be limited to 512 CPU units.\nMore information is available in the AWS documentation.\nSee #741 for lots of good discussion about the use cases and implementation.\nCustom App Load Balancers Security Groups\nConvox handles provisioning and configuring a load balancer based on the docker-compose.yml port mappings:\nyaml\nweb:\n  image: httpd\n  ports:\n    - 80:80\nBy default this load balancer will be exposed to the entire internet. Sometimes we want to tighten this to only allow connections from a single computer or single network.\nYou can now apply additional restrictions to this load balancer by assigning a custom security group to an app:\n``` bash\nget the VPC ID\n$ convox rack\nName     convox\nStatus   running\nVersion  20160615203231\nRegion   us-east-1\nCount    3\nType     t2.large\n$ convox ps --app convox\nID            NAME      RELEASE                  SIZE  STARTED     COMMAND                         \ncde9ac958f36  monitor   20160615203231-20160615  64    4 days ago  /go/bin/init sh -c api/bin/monitor\n1845eb6ec788  registry  20160615203231-20160615  128   1 day ago   /docker-entrypoint.sh           \n79e05a82d06d  registry  20160615203231-20160615  128   4 days ago  /docker-entrypoint.sh           \n541d9b8509cb  web       20160615203231-20160615  128   1 day ago   /go/bin/init sh -c api/bin/web  \ne9fd0ed66d41  web       20160615203231-20160615  128   4 days ago  /go/bin/init sh -c api/bin/web \n$ convox exec 541d9b8509cb env --app convox | grep VPC\nVPC=vpc-f8006b9c\ncreate a new security group\n$ aws ec2 create-security-group --group-name=office --description=\"office network only\" --vpc-id=vpc-f8006b9c\n{\n    \"GroupId\": \"sg-3bdaaf40\"\n}\nrestrict ingress to a single subnet\n$ aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id=sg-3bdaaf40 --protocol=tcp --port=0-65535 --cidr=24.75.239.0/32\napply the security group to the app load balancers\n$ convox apps params set SecurityGroup=sg-3bdaaf40\nUpdating parameters...

Thanks to @awsmsrc on #773, convox now automatically deletes the very oldest builds after a successful new build. This both avoids hitting the service limit and saves money on storage costs.\nAs a reminder, Convox still retains the last 50 builds and releases to facilitate a rollback from a bad release:\n``` bash\n$ convox builds\nID           STATUS    RELEASE      STARTED      ELAPSED  DESC\nBOFEDWPIEEB  complete  RLBTJENIMQI  3 days ago   6s         \nBVFZQPTJJNV  complete  RTAYZHUSGCJ  1 week ago   22s        \nBKYKUURZKQU  complete  RONCLAIMWTP  2 weeks ago  49s        \nBFUOFQOMAFI  complete  RDJQJEUAPTP  2 weeks ago  10s        \nBHGAKQOJCCA  complete  RQOHWZJYDGG  2 weeks ago  5s       \n$ convox releases promote RTAYZHUSGCJ\nPromoting RTAYZHUSGCJ...

Fix convox run work with a \"unpromoted\" release\n. Good question! I had planned to clean up the temp task (that is mark it as \"inactive\") but noticed that  subsequent runs will use the same task definition and thus no need to create a new one. Saw it as an extra bonus so I kept it as is.\nIf/when the release is promoted, there won't be any issues as CloudFormation will create a new revision of the task definition and the release will use that new one. So would any runs that use that release.\n. The rawEnvs change makes sense to me but I used releaseId (lowercase d) as that's the same naming scheme used throughout the code. I was favoring consistency. \nThoughts on renaming existing ones or keeping it as is? Either way works for me. \ud83d\udc4d \n. I like that stance. Will use it going forward. Should be good to go.\n.

This change and #978 are kind-of related in that they both introduce clean up \"work\". 978 cleans up resource when an app is deleted, etc. This PR cleans up old builds, keeping the latest 50 only, when a new one new build is created.

Since Rack runs two copies of the Rack API process for optimal uptime, if a Rack doesn't have at least three instances updates can't roll out and your CloudFormation stack will get wedged. \nWhen Cloudformation tries to rollback the update, the limit of two instances prevents the rollback from succeeding.

Things to consider:\n- [ ] Should we parse the Dockerfile for COPY .cache/build/foo to indicate if we should use build cache? Otherwise misleading (worrisome?) errors are displayed to the user: \nbuild    \u2502 Error response from daemon: lstat /var/lib/docker/aufs/mnt/00a07473df28d3a1cf02e83a408d9b5870b36634271ec308b660b29129f271f8/var/cache/build: no such file or directory\nbuild    \u2502 cache error: exit status 1\n\n[ ] Funky order to get this working unless I'm missing something. The cache has to be generated the first time (e.g. RUN bundle install --path /var/cache/build/gems) before the Dockerfile should specify the COPY .cache command. This goes for convox start and convox build. Otherwise nothing is copied to the apps local .cache dir. Maybe auto-generate it?.  Only log command to run. Think this should be printed if DEBUG == true. I believe CONVOX_DEBUG is being phased out. Only see two instances of it in sync.go.. Any thoughts on returning an error instead? Seems odd to have CLI output in the Unmarshal func. If it isn't supported behavior, maybe it causes side effects hard to track down. \n\nMaybe we can keep it here for now as a deprecation notice?. I believe it would be returned in one of these two calls: https://github.com/convox/rack/blob/master/manifest/manifest.go#L44-L50\nI think yaml.Unmarshal checks if a type implements the UnmarshalYAML interface, if so it calls that.. Good catch, convox deploy should call Validate() too.\nMy fault though as I should've been more specific. My original idea was for UnmarshalYAML to return an error instead of warning and let that bubble up to the user as any other error. That way they can make any changes as needed. And we don't have to check everywhere for this specific error.\ncase 2:\n if _, ok := (*l)[parts[0]]; ok {\n    return fmt.Errorf(\"duplicate label found for: %s\\n\", s)\n}\n(*l)[parts[0]] = parts[1].

I like the the RACK_ prefix and it acts as a namespace to not clash with other env vars. Same as AWS_ is used. Should definitely pick one or the other. RACK vs CONVOX\nRACK_BUILD_INSTANCE has a env var for completeness, which we happen to use for CI too. I believe most if not all of the env vars could be removed and just use CLI args. But that seems weird and it's nice to give the user an option of one over the other. And it's free to implement via the cli pkg. \nI'm indifferent to the actual name. I considered appending _TYPE but seemed very long.\n. This looks great. \ud83d\udc4d I'll run it through some tests and hopefully get this through.\nWe currently have a convox.balancers label.

I believe they were released middle of last week so it would include updates until then.\nBut on boot up, instances are configured to apply security updates except for the kernel (and as a result packages that depend on the kernel).\nAny updates done to Amazon Linux AMI proper, we would need to wait on the ECS-optimized version to receive them.

Are you running tests via convox start for each process of an app?.  convox cli install tests. @william-richard Could you rebase on master so we could move this PR forward. Thanks!. No direct error was observed. It was strictly \"failing gracefully\" in the event that an ECS call doesn't work out.\n. My line of thinking here was if GetAppServices() did fail there little else to do. If one ECS call failed, others could still pass. After looking at it again, I can see how line 282 could be changed to not bail out entirely so that running and one-off processes could still be displayed.\n. For now, indeed it seems ok. I was thinking along the lines if one ECS/EC2 call failed, there could still be others that working fine. Do we want to ignore those?\n. Good catch. This confused me before I noticed it's updating the map.\n. I believe the thinking here is fail gracefully. That is, logging/describing an ASG activities isn't as critical as the lines above it. It allows code like https://github.com/convox/rack/pull/759/files#diff-b4f593c3fe0f755e9e7dfee53404ceb8R47 to carry on.\nPerhaps we should add a log statement here to indicate such an error?\n. Nice intel; didn't catch that during first glance. That is definitely an alternative way as long as only racks have that Dashboard key.\n. Being picky, remove the blank line above for consistency.\n. Makes sense. Safer to check Created to get the latest one.\n. Good point and easy fix.\n. I agree. Anything to help make it understandable works for me.\n. Added labels. I think it helps a bit for now.\n. I like it. Done!\n. I was thinking the same before, perhaps with using the dynamo table as a reference but nothing stood out at me. \nThought about using the created timestamp and comparing that to the active timestamp. Wasn't sure if it was reliable enough.\n. That's the gist of the logic, yes. I'll take another look at it to see what else can be improved. It was probably a little hack keeping the environment variables as strings instead of converting them to real maps to make it easier to work with.\n. I used them during initial design phase and thought they were nifty to have around. But think \"less code is more\" wins here.\n. This can indeed take a while, especially if a user calls convox run with a very old release. The go-ecs API doesn't provide a \"paging\" functionality like it's other calls for describing task definitions (which is understandable since we want to describe one revision).\nTwo options top of mind:\n1. Sleep for a second after n number of task definitions. (arbitrarily start with 15?).\n2. Limit convox run to use only one of the last n task definitions. (again 15 might work).\nThese options help with rate limits. There's still the issue of a run taking too long. Especially if it's towards the bottom of the list. More recent releases would be towards the top of the list and are iterated over first.\nI'm leaning towards option 2. As is, to determine if a release hasn't been promoted, we have to iterate the task definitions revisions. If it's not found there then it's an \"unpromoted\" release. It would be a bad user experience having to wait that iteration if there are hundreds of revisions to iterate first.\n. I thought about that but didn't want the name to get to unwieldy. I think a a doc comment will explain what it's for while keeping name in check.\nAdded the comments. Let me know if you think that's acceptable or if a name change is needed.\n. Sounds good to me. Let me know if there are any thoughts on CreateBuildSourceProgress.\n. Will do. I liked the print entry so we could know where in build process the CLI was. But I'm OK either way.\n. We could, but the reason I added it was to keep the the logic for deleting builds and releases separate. That is, two calls have to be made for deleting builds and it's releases instead of just one call to BuildDelete() that implicitly deletes the releases.\nAn alternate route though is to pass a bool flag to BuildDelete() to indicate if the releases should be deleted as well.\n. Sounds good to me. I'll do that in a separate PR so the changes could be easier to follow.\n. This printed out a lot logs for the rails example. Don't think we really need it.\n. Can we move it to the /convox/ path?\n. Definitely could. I was thinking of having Import return a release so that the newly imported build could be released. Thoughts on that since a code path could return a release struct vs the others returning a build. Seems a little off since the function is called BuildCreate.\n. So determined to return a release struct, that went over my head. Good to go. \n. Is this being checked elsewhere? I remember there being issues trying to set count with autoscale enabled. Maybe more perception than issue. Where users didn't realize autoscale was on when setting the count and wondering why instances we're being terminated. https://github.com/convox/rack/issues/643\n. Nitpicking as the end result is the same but for consistency we could use fmt.Println(build.Release) as well in cmdBuildsCreate() instead of os.Stdout.Write([]byte(fmt.Sprintf(\"%s\\n\", build))). Same naming scheme for out := os.Stdout too. This isn't a big deal.\n. Can we remove these comments?\n. Debug comments to remove?\n. Comments to remove?\n. We could us currentProvider here.\n. Might not be a big deal overall, but we probably want to defer close the channel s so this loop will stop nicely.\n. +1 for MockProvider\n. Acceptable to go out like this?\n. Build cache will be handled elsewhere?\n. Since we are using an io.Pipe (so that files aren't loaded completely into memory) CreateFormFile blocks using the Pipe writer. By having this logic in a goroutine, the request can start reading from the pipe and the goroutine can write to it.\n. The MB isn't necessary here as we can pass the s.Memory as is.\n. We do accept labels \ud83d\udc4d \n. error message can be rewritten as we do accept text labels. \n. I believe this conversion is to check the value is between with 4 and 10,000.  Since Memory is really an int64, it can be used directly (entry.Memory < 4 && entry.Memory != 0)\n. I forgot to mention in my initial pass, this error should state explicitly what's going on.\nFor example entry.Memory while in bytes, should be displayed in \"human readable\" format in the error.\nmem := units.HumanSize(float64(entry.Memory))\nAnd while technically true, do we need to mention 0 as a valid value?\nAt least 4MB is required for web.  Found:  \"2.097 MB\"\nSomething along those lines.\n. This error is just for logging. The whole build still continues. Any thoughts on renaming the message?\n. Is this sleep a test or do we really want something like that?\n. This extra test server can be removed. tsd has the Delete method that works \ud83d\udc4d \n. This extra test server can be removed. tsd has the Delete method that works \ud83d\udc4d \n. All caps was causing the weird underscores?. We don't need group nogroup here?. This last return isn't necessary as it would be handled by line 391.. Should check for error here along with QOS event. \nThe event can be consistent with cli-install (instead of e.g. cli-waitForAvailability-unknown) and add details in the error message. This allows for easier querying in reporting tools. This goes for the other event calls too.. This call shouldn't be needed if moved to line 662. Wondering if we should move this call to the init() to only call it once. And if an error, we can set it to empty string.. When you get a chance, the value key needs to be capitalized. . No worries, I'll take the PR forward. \ud83d\udc4d . Is distinctID left out on purpose?. Same here, no distinctID.. Might not be a big deal, but -a is used throughout the cli for --app. Perhaps to avoid confusion (even though this is used in the rack subcommand) and to be consistent, just stick to --all?. Being picky about grammar:\ninstead of turning it into an application EFS mount. I was using the same condition here: https://github.com/convox/rack/blob/fda3718f67981724f866149d1e5d293cf8fee130/provider/aws/dist/rack.json#L656. It does seem to be part of the recent \"existing VPC\" change though.. This parameter was recently added (https://github.com/convox/rack/blob/master/provider/aws/dist/rack.json#L231) so export-env will grab it automatically.. I'm wondering if we should condense this with GetReleases(app string) by adding the limit parameter to it. That way we keep one code path when it comes to getting releases.. This makes sense and looks right. \ud83d\udc4d . All good. There is precedent so it's good as is. \ud83d\udc4d \nGood reason not to change it is breaking API compatibility client side.. Any reason not to keep the same text as before? output.Write([]byte(fmt.Sprintf(\"Promoting %s... \", releaseID\"))). Don't think this is needed if the format above is followed.. Wouldn't a check for just c.Bool(\"id\") be enough?. We could combine this two outputs as above.. c.Bool(\"id\") check?. We can remove this line if it's not used.. Would we revert back to 2 processes once instance draining is working properly?. Debug statement to remove?. Only getting the first 3 pages of results?. Nice, I wasn't aware of BoolTFlag. Good to know but for what it's worth, after looking it up, later version ofurfave/cli remove that type and gave BoolFlag a default value.. Believe this file was committed by mistake.. Yes please that'd be appreciated. As I test this out today, if you like I can tackle any issues that run up. That way I don't keep bothering about little stuff like that.. KernelUserGeneralPolicy should be added to the DependsOn for the user resource.. ~We're relying on CF for the overall timeout and for the loops yum has it's own 10 second timout (#1633 cc @mattmanning ).~\nI was too slow with my comment.. Small nitpick. We should us assert.NoError when checking errors. Has the same affect just with a nicer output message if the assertion fails.. Could we remove this flag and check if we just set it to raw from the beginning? . Should these be KernelAccess instead so the creds are generated? It has an implicit dependency on KernelUser. This is nitpicking, but perhaps we could have one dcm = helpers.DetectComposeFile() variable up in the var() scope.. Are you saying it's safe to assume docker will be in the user's PATH?. I think this function can go in the main package and be used by the various sub commands. Could also use the same method as with the COMPOSE_FILE where you have a dockerBin var.\nThinking out loud, I see stdcli as a helper package to write CLI tools. Finding the location of the docker binary is tool-specific logic.. That went over my head. Got it \ud83d\udc4d. We definitely could use CF SNS events. We went with this method (knowing polling could fail) as the quickest way of getting promotion events as version 1.\nAnother option is lambda acting on CF events via SNS. One problem is finding a reliable way of knowing a stack update was a promotion or some other stack change (e.g scaling a process) without or little state management.. I believe we can and worth a shot. I went this route first to avoid any state changes that happen when calling the Waiter with tasks grabbed before or after instance change to DRAINING.\nEither way, a call to ListTasks() (w/ next pages in mind for a waiter) is done. Then pass those task into the waiter. Figured we have the data already we could check it directly.. Not in the model. We get an ID once the build is create by the provider.. Previous logic seemed odd. Is this new behavior expected?. Think this is err == nil instead?. Was this removed on purpose? This was needed for build notifications. Falls back to stack ID but client is ideal.. I was using // as a visual beginning/end block for input and output for a given test.. This came with the dedicated build changes: https://github.com/convox/rack/pull/1677/files#diff-54ede314b4e7f9fbc11373ad5f9b8bc2L1252. Believe this should be Rack instead of stack as it's an implementation detail. The latter might confuse users who are not familiar with the term.. Could we use parts[0] instead of dup? \nduplicate cron label: convox.cron.myjob seems easier to read than duplicate cron label * * * * ? bin/myjob1. nit: deployment blocked, foo is still being updated, .... Seems consistent with the error above. Thoughts?. Slight tangent, do we mind if it's rack's or Rack's?. That's good point. At some time, a CLI pass would be nice to have consistency. Ideally remove references to stack.. Could we group the regions together here. That is make eu-west-2 number 5 and move the others down. ap-southeast-2 is floating up there too.. Thirty seconds seems way too high. Maybe 5? Anything higher than that, something might be up and we should investigate.. Any thoughts on renaming:\nTEST -> PKG (this would indicate its the golang package the test belongs too)\nTESTRUN -> TEST (actual test to run). I'm not familiar with -test.run. I've used go test $PKG -run. Any known differences?. nit: How about just saying timed out here?. Could we direct the user to convox apps params to see existing values? Same with the rack params.. nit for consistency:  would we wrap these err checks:\nif err := displayFormation(c, app); err != nil{\n    return nil\n}. nit: This test can go with the other env tests inside env_test.go. Nice to keep them together in one file.. nit: Seems the variables declared in the return statement are not used anywhere. To be consistent with the return statements, can we remove the named return variables and return \"\",\"\", nil here? Same with line 303.. This line should be reverted back as foo=bar\\nping=pong\\n is what's returned by the test server.. Only users of the Convox docker hub would be able to use make builder without changes. Could we be more explicit there?. I'm OK going with either or, but we should pick one. Having both can cause unexpected behavior while debugging.\nBelieve @ddollar made some changes in this area a while back. Any thoughts?. We could change the flags to a variadic parameter:\nRecoverFlag(c *cli.Context, flags ...string) string\nThis way when calling the function, we can RecoverFlag(c, \"a\", \"app\"). Something along the lines of:\n``\nIf you're working on the builder, you can set the [BuildImage` Rack param](https://convox.com/docs/rack-parameters#buildimage) to a Docker image for the builder. This is primarily used for development purposes only. General users should not set this parameter.\nA developer with access to the Convox DockerHub organization could run:\nmake builder\nWhich creates an image of the build script and uploads it to DockerHub. It can be set via\nconvox rack params set BuildImage=convox/build:$(whoami)\n```\nAs a side note, I think https://convox.com/docs/rack-parameters#buildimage should make it explicit that this param is intended for developers only and general users should not set it. Seems users think its related to BuildInstance and set both of them.. Not sure why this was added. Something change?. Same here, what changed that these keys are removed?. I could be missing some context but seems like the test case should handle that via os.Unsetenv(\"VAR\") (and perhaps setting it back once it's done?). Wondering about the side effects of including this in the test script.. I concur. \ud83d\udc4d . CONVOX_DEBUG it is. Lets remove it from this line though as it won't have any affect in a rack and could lead to confusion. We could in another PR change this throughout the rack.. I believe this line should be around 410-411 with the other targetBuild properties.\nAlso in that same area, we'd want to check if a build with that ID already exist and error out if it does.. That's a good catch. Let's leave it here. \ud83d\udc4d . At first, I went with this function returning an error. But as you mentioned, it's called everywhere in a chained fashion. All those calls would have to add error checking, which is fine in itself but then reduces the usefulness of this helper IMHO.\nSo I went with the function exiting out as the CLI can't do anything without a working client.. We could take advantage of assert.EqualError here. This way there's no need for the if error check or wrap the string with a new error.\nassert.EqualError(t, err,  expectedErrorString). nit: Seems like a long wait time. Was two or three seconds tested? Or is that cutting it too close?. Think the fmt.Println(\"OK\") (or something to that effect) should be incorporated for when wait isn't set. Moving stdcli.OK() outside of the wait check prints it on the new line. Not a big deal but isn't consistent.. Should read TestApiTrailingSlash and a different comment of what it's really testing.. Sounds good to me. \ud83d\udc4d . That's a good example. Thinking something like:\nstdcli.Startf(\"Updating parameters... \")\n// lines 216 - 222 go here\nstdcli.Wait(\"OK\")\nThis way we keep the \"Updating parameters... OK \" on the same line if the user doesn't wait.. \ud83d\udc36 \ud83d\udc15 . Not sure I follow. The only case states the status that a keyroll can take place.. After reading it 100x, think you mean the error message should state that. Still waking up.... Instances that use a Run or Boot command could take longer that 5 minutes, causing the operation to fail when it's still moving along. Maybe 10 minutes?. nit: could this function be simplified to return s.Labels[\"convox.environment.secure\"] == \"true\"?. There's a require.NoError() function that wraps this error check logic with nice output.. Second check for empty envURL?. This could be changed to return stdcli.Error(err) to keep the context of a stdcli Error.. small names typo. I noticed cfn-signal has an --https-proxy option. Is it safe to omit here?. Was this removed by mistake? Perhaps an editor?. Didn't notice that. And it also compiled fine because cli is the actual pkg name. Wonder why goimports did this. I'll fix it.. I've noticed with the docker cli, the output can have information about the error. Printing err sometimes results in exit status 125.\nout, err := cmd.CombinedOutput()\nfmt.Printf(\"WARNING: %s %s\\n\", strings.TrimSpace(string(out)), err). Good point. Cleanup is now a defer.. I believe the comment should say after 10 syncs? I can make the change but I want to make sure I understand correctly.. There should be a return after the warning so the code doesn't continue in an unknown state.. remove comment?. ",
    "beedub": "this is great, thx @nzoschke \nan aside, is it possible to specify the process count in docker-compose.yml?\n. To add more context... it looks like convox instances ssh is proxying through the elb and the convox api, so there shouldn't be a need to make the instances internet-accessible in a normal, non-debug setup. Would love review and confirmation from anyone more knowledgable about convox and aws that there are no negative consequences from this change\n. > With a setting like InstanceUpdateBatchSize=5, are your critical services scaled up so that losing 5 web containers at a time would be ok?\nI would expect that the user (me) would ensure that the batch size is set to an acceptable value. In my specific case, with 50 nodes, I'd look to set the param to 5\n@ddollar just rebased and force pushed\n. I was able to fix my go env and get make test to pass locally. Should be ready for review!\n. > Can you offer some use cases for setting CPU shares differently among apps and process types?\nIn a single app, we have a worker tier for cpu-intensive processes like image processing and a worker tier for everything else. We'd want to guarantee, for example, than the the image processing workers had atleast 2 cores available to it (represented through 2048 cpu units in ecs). Similarly, we'd want the worker tier to have atleast 1 core (represented by 1024 cpu units). It's also easy to imagine different types of apps running in one rack as well. For us, we have a main application for which each container spawns 4 workers, and we have newer microservices that only have 2 workers each. For the former, we'd like to dedicate atleast 2 cores worth of units to it, and the former 1 core.\n\nHow does settings CPU shares affect the runtime for processes? Do they get throttled or killed if they use too much?\n\nFrom what I've read and demos I've seen, they are simply throttled to that amount if there are competing processes on the box. They are not killed. https://goldmann.pl/blog/2014/09/11/resource-management-in-docker/\n\nI believe the total number of CPU shares differs among instance type. Does the process type setting need to take this into account?\n\nThe vCPU shares are different per instance type. There's a coarse check for the cpu setting in the PR that's similar to the check for the memory setting: the validation will check that the rack instance type has atleast enough overall cpu shares to satisfy the cpu setting. However, similar to memory constraints, this won't guarantee that the process can be placed. Eg. if you had one t1.small (has 1 vCPU/1024 cpu units) with the convox agent running with 256 cpu units, and tried to launch a process with 1024, then it may (will? I'll verify after this comment) not get placed.\nI do think having this setting, and setting it to a sane default is important though. Without a cpu setting at all, one could launch a process accidentally that saturates cpu and adversely affect every other app and process running in the rack. Now that I think about it, I think it might be more intuitive to set the default to 512 (half a cpu core minimum) or 1024 (one core minimum).\n. I tested the cpu shares on an ECS cluster. ECS will deny placing the task if there exists no capacity on any instances that fits the CPU requirement.\n. I did a little bit more testing and research on cpu...\nThere are two aspects to consider: ecs' cpu units and docker cpu shares. They are almost similar but not exactly the same. While ecs' cpu units are a hard limit and relative value, docker cpu shares are only a relative value. This means that the docker daemon on the instance can handle way instances \nECS translates cpu to docker --cpu-shares according to the following chart:\n| cpu units | available cpu change | --cpu-shares value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| not specified / null / 0 | 0 | 2 |\n| 1 | -1 | 2 |\n| N > 1 | -N | N |\nCurrently, convox doesn't specify a cpu for its task definitions, so available cpu units on all instances is the max allowed and each task/process is launched with a docker cpu share of 2. As an example, if the cluster has 1 t2.small with 1 vCPU (1024 cpu units) and 3 running tasks each with share 2, then each task will be guaranteed 2/1024 cpu units and each will equally share the remaining unreserved cpu units (1024 - 2 * 3).\n. After re-considering, I agree that leaving the cpu default as null makes\nmore sense than setting it to something arbitrary. As long as it's\nconfigurable, I'm :+1:\nOn Thu, Jun 9, 2016 at 5:44 PM, Noah Zoschke notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nAwesome research. Let me try to synthesize what you've found...\nCPU shares are an important concept for apps, particularly for controlling\nhow many cores a container can access / saturate.\nOn ECS, CPU shares are a hard limit for scheduling.\nI don't quite get the Docker CPU shares stuff... My initial reaction is\nthat it doesn't matter, just work with ECS.\nI do think having this setting, and setting it to a sane default is\nimportant though. Without a cpu setting at all, one could launch a process\naccidentally that saturates cpu and adversely affect every other app and\nprocess running in the rack.\nI think the default is the main design decision here.\nMy Convox philosophy is sane defaults, then some simple knobs, but let\npower users do whatever they want with these knobs including shooting\nyourself in the foot.\nI definitely understand your concern about a process gone wild.\nBut I think that saturating a CPU is actually a feature in a single-tenant\nsystem. Squeeze everything you can out of the boxes, and only tune things\nif you observe quality of service problems.\nThe main justification I see for this default is the ECS API and system\nitself. For every Task Definition, Memory is required and CPU is not.\nThe next justification is backwards compatibility. If we're not careful\nthe next app deploy for all users will magically have some tight CPU\nlimits. If the default is wrong, we should change it, but probably with a\nmore careful migration strategy.\nSo what if the default was still 0, but your parameterization lands so you\nand everyone else can start playing with tuning it?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/convox/rack/pull/741#issuecomment-225067063, or mute\nthe thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe/AAGQ9jjpBVvcGuq6tTABrisdEndhwvhUks5qKLN_gaJpZM4IwfwN\n.\n. @nzoschke updated to make cpu optional\n. > Limiting those workers specifically would be fine for us.\n\n@mwarkentin to be clear, I think you meant not limiting those workers, but rather guaranteeing min cpu for your web tier\n. updated the app.tmpl's default from -1 to 0, which seemed like the only blocking change. I would test the behavior of scaling down the rack, but I can't seem to get convox ps to work against my local dev\n. > you want to use a different email for better attribution?\nAh, thanks for the notification.

And derive the rest from those. Would like to avoid getting too tied down to exact Amazon implementation detail in the docker compose or rack api if possible.\n\nThe protocol, port, and path could certainly be combined into endpoint but the other concepts/params are more-or-less common with the other two other major providers, GC and Azure, and not AMZN-specific\nGC health check params map essentially 1:1 with AWS', and so do Azure's probes except for the healthy_threshold concept (they do support the concept of unhealthy_threshold, which maps to Azure's numberOfProbes).\nIs the concern strictly about making docker-compose consistent between local and cloud? or consistent between various clouds?\n. I think @ddollar's example meant to say convox.health.endpoint=tcp:9000/foo as the label would already be under the process\n. > My app takes a long time to boot so I add a single new label:\n\nyaml\nweb:\n  labels:\n    - convox.health.path=/foo\n  ports:\n    - 80:5000\n\nThe default port protocol is currently tcp, but specifying path would implicitly change the port's protocol to http, which creates the relationship that the health check has some ownership of the path's protocol (ie. the protocol isn't independent anymore). I'm not sure if this would be a practical problem long-term, but something to note.\nSo is there opposition to adding healthy_threshold, unhealthy_threshold and interval as well? They're common to the 3 major cloud providers (except for azure not supporting healthy_threshold). As these health check params would be additional labels, they would be only specified for the power users\n. They're decoupled afaik as well. @nzoschke are you implying that the health check proto would also be decoupled at the convox layer?\neg. taking the aforementioned example again:\nweb:\n  labels:\n    - convox.health.path=/foo\n  ports:\n    - 80:5000\n- ELB ingress would be TCP:80\n- Instance ingress would be TCP:5000\n- Health check would be HTTP:5000/foo\nBut in this example:\nweb:\n  labels:\n    - convox.port.443.protocol=https\n    - convox.health.path=/foo\n    - convox.health.port=443\n    - convox.health.timeout=120\n  ports:\n    - 443:5001\n- ELB ingress would be HTTPS:443\n- Instance ingress would be HTTPS:5001\n- ~~Health check would be HTTPS:5001/foo~~ Health check would be HTTP:5001/foo\n. I'm getting a bit confused. The health check is between the LB and container instance, so shouldn't the secure label determine whether the health check protocol is http vs https?\n. To the same effect, shouldn't convox.health.port refer to the container port, not the LB ingress port?\n. @ddollar rebased\n. > If you set a worker CPU shares to a small number with convox apps params set WorkerCpu=50 it will restrict the amount of CPU -- most importantly the number of CPU cores -- that a single worker can consume. For some apps this is a very good way to assure that the web processes don't get adversely impacted by workers.\n@nzoschke unless my initial implementation changed, the cpu param behaves ~~the opposite of~~ differently from what's described here. The param doesn't restrict; it reserves a minimum of that amount for the process. In other words, the param can prevent other containers on the same box from impacting said process, not prevent said process from affecting other containers on the same box\n. @MiguelMoll the description of the cpu feature is incorrect. see https://github.com/convox/rack/pull/779#issuecomment-227304151\n. @ddollar updated to allow only an existing VPC, no existing subnets\n. Obviate by https://github.com/convox/rack/pull/946\n. Obviate by https://github.com/convox/rack/pull/946\n. shouldn't the title read \"run command handles error if env is empty\"?\n. this is apparently obviated https://github.com/convox/rack/pull/946, which removes the custom nat gateways for CF's stock ones\n. set statically to 1000 @ddollar \n. I just checked on our dev rack and it's been running without the monitor without any known issues. The last termination event for the related ASG was Sept 19th.\nOur dev cluster has 10 instances and many deployments per day of multiple apps (much more so than our prod cluster).\nThis behavior is in contrast to 1-2 daily terminations with the monitor turned on.\nI'd feel comfortable removing the agent-check on our rack.\nThat being said, new AMIs and new ecs-agent versions may introduce instability.\n. Just curious, why is this closed for re-evaluation? The monitor is only causing turbulence with no benefit according to behavior we see in our racks. While it'd be ideal for there to be a more sophisticated monitor (an idea I saw thrown around), removing it completely for now seems like a better option than leaving it.\n. should this be returning err?\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. I would assume that the service would throw the not enough cpu error\n. The Size term here seems a bit confusing but left alone\n. this seems relatively easy to do. I was imagining having a central mapping between count/cpu/mem \"noop\" vals somewhere and then referencing that here and in SetFormation. I would have made this change myself, but not sure how it would look in practice (new to go)\n. should this be !=? as is, this would allow 4 or more cidrs\n. same here\n. Yeah you're right. I'll fully de-param\n. updated\n. difference is port protocol:\nhealthpath set = tcp\nhealthpath not set = http\n. updated\n. port was made into a param, but never used by the app/cf template\n. @ddollar this should return the existing values in the template right?\n. you're right. updated\n. isn't this unnecessary given that scheme == internal is checked above?\n. ah gotcha \ud83d\udc4d \n. That was my first thought, but I thought people might want to have a max safeguard and not accidentally start 1000 servers? Either way is fine for me for now\n. this seems like it should be <, not <=, as 20160818013241 includes the migration\ndiscussed with @MiguelMoll \n. ",

I've submitted a patch to address those issues -- this definitely creates a better experience. Question: Is it okay to import \"errors\" here? I was following the patterns laid out in cmdServiceInfo which didn't return stdcli.ExitError() for a service status that resulted in a failure so that's why my initial implementation replicated that pattern. I had to import errors in order to correctly give back a decent error to the user.\n. Nevermind, hound reminded me of being able to use fmt.Errorf instead of errors.New()\n. Already taken care of.\n.

    "ianmalott": "@ddollar I got some clarification about Console and rack creation from @mattmanning:\n\nWhen console installs a Rack it needs to store the Rack password so it can proxy API calls to it. I would assume David is asking if that will be broken by the Password NoEcho setting.\nI'm guessing that since there's no --password option for the CLI installer that console fetches the password from CloudFormation after the install.\nBut would need to confirm.\nIf that's the case, we might want to have Console set the Password when it installs so it doesn't have to be fetched back.\n\nNot sure how you'd want to proceed from here, but it seems like this is blocked by some Console and CLI changes.\n. @ddollar: yep, only blocked on tests (and review of refactoring). Wasn't sure how to test a console-based rack installation, but I tested the following from the CLI:\n- convox install --version <noecho-release> with --password and without\n- convox rack update to a release with \"NoEcho\": \"false\" for Password param\n- convox rack params set Password=foobarbaz\n. @mwarkentin Thanks for the suggestion. @nzoschke has a doc on the way that describes how to set a new Rack API Key/Password: https://github.com/convox/site/pull/229\n. @mwarkentin Thanks for the suggestion. @nzoschke has a doc on the way that describes how to set a new Rack API Key/Password: https://github.com/convox/site/pull/229\n.

Won't changing dashName result in breaking current apps named in the form AppNN? Could we, instead just check if suffix is -link or just link and trip appropriately? E.g.:\ngo\nif strings.HasSuffix(k, \"Link\") {\n  n := dashName(k)\n  app := n[:len(n)-4]\n  if strings.HasSuffix(n, \"-link\") {\n    app = n[:len(n)-5]\n  }\n...\n}\n. So currently both httpd80 and httpd-80 as app names would result in Httpd80Link, making it impossible to guess which is the original?\n. Sure, will add that. I used same logic as for launching the service containers themselves: https://github.com/convox/rack/blob/master/manifest/process.go#L56 It picks the last defined network, yes. According to documentation, convox supports only single network, no? https://convox.com/docs/docker-compose-file/\n. This actually seems to leave a trailing dash now.

I think the running: line is useful information. It's only one line, and it really helps make it clear what's going on under the hood. I think we should leave it in, personally.\nAnother thing: is it DEBUG or CONVOX_DEBUG? I see references to both in the code. CONVOX_DEBUG seems more appropriate, IMO..  Export client.Request for testing purposes.  Export func (c *Client) request() in rack/client/client.go.  Validate against duplicate cron job names. +1 @awsmsrc I created a separate task to implement that.. @MiguelMoll Good point...\nI'm not seeing a way to \"warn\" the user outside of UnmarshalYAML without aborting completely. I'm having trouble even find a place where I could do an extra check on the error returned by UnmarshalYAML, like if strings.Contains(err, \"Duplicate label found\"){ [warn user but don't abort] }\nDo you have a suggestion?. @MiguelMoll I took another approach; is this any better? It feels fragile to assume any error containing \"WARNING\" should just be printed instead of causing an error, and it feels cluttered to have to check+handle this in multiple places, but not sure how to do it better without more serious changes.\nUnrelated, but something I just noticed: after loading the manifest in convox start, we run Validate() on it here. We load the manifest in a similar way in convox deploy, but we don't Validate() it here. Is that intentional?\n(By the way, Validate() sounds like it would be a nice place to do the check for duplicate labels, but the duplicates are already long discarded by then.). @mattmanning I think you had mentioned a warning was preferable to an outright error in the case of duplicate cron labels. I think I agree with @MiguelMoll that an error is probably best here, given the complexity that would have to be added to make a warning possible. WDYT?. @MiguelMoll rebase done.  Move manifest.yml back to Rack repo.  Add stdcli.Warn().  Document convox env set --id. /me backs away slowly.  Validate manifest when deploying.

What's the difference between DEBUG and CONVOX_DEBUG?. @ddollar I took a look at SetEnvironment in client/environment.go:\n```\nfunc (c *Client) SetEnvironment(app string, body io.Reader) (Environment, string, error) {\n    var env Environment \nres, err := c.PostBodyResponse(fmt.Sprintf(\"/apps/%s/environment\", app), body, &env)\n\nif err != nil {\n    return nil, \"\", err\n}\n\nreturn env, res.Header.Get(\"Release-Id\"), nil\n\n}\n```\nAre you suggesting we move cleanEnvPair() to client/environment.go, then modify SetEnvironment() to read body to a string, validate/manipulate it, change it back to body and then pass it on to c.PostBodyResponse()?\nIt feels a bit weird to manipulate body, so I'd like to make sure I haven't misunderstood what you're saying.. @ddollar Bah, sorry, I'm confused. When you say \"modify the API on the Rack side\" which file do you mean? I'm modifying EnvironmentSet in api/controllers/environment.go but nothing seems to happen when I try to test.. Here's the flow as I understand it:\ncmd/convox/env.go in func cmdEnvSet:\n_, releaseID, err := rackClient(c).SetEnvironment(app, strings.NewReader(data))\nclient/environment.go in func SetEnvironment:\nres, err := c.PostBodyResponse(fmt.Sprintf(\"/apps/%s/environment\", app), body, &env)\napi/controllers/routes.go:\nrouter.HandleFunc(\"/apps/{app}/environment\", api(\"environment.set\", EnvironmentSet)).Methods(\"POST\")\napi/controllers/environment.go in func EnvironmentSet:\nreleaseID, err := models.PutEnvironment(app, models.LoadEnvironment(body))\nWhen I put fmt.Println(body) or log.Panic(body) in the EnvironmentSet func, nothing gets printed when I run convox env set. Is that expected?. As I recall from my manual testing, something like this is needed because otherwise if the user redirects the output to a file, stderr will print something like\nTo deploy these changes run `convox releases promote `\n without the release ID (and/or the release ID will get written to stdout twice.). @ddollar ok, I removed that check.. Good point; done.. @MiguelMoll From what I see based on egrep -r Errorf ./*  | grep -i rack it looks like it's lowercase almost everywhere. . Fixed. No known differences. I didn't know about -run; it looks like -run could be enough by itself since it takes regexp.. Works for me; will do. Update: I couldn't get this to work in 3 minutes, so I just renamed them as requested in your comment above. Could try to implement this later if desired.. I tested with another approach using the Before field in the cli.Command struct, but it seems harder to introspect the CLI context from there.. I see where you're coming from, but I think it's better to be specific if we possibly can.. Touche, renamed. I want to test:\n\nthat usage is printed when requested\nthat usage is printed when there are invalid, missing or extra args\nthat hostname resolution failures and \"no such file or directory\" errors are handled as expected\nthat we don't panic in any case\n\nI would be ok with a less strict usage test; for now I was just following the same pattern as in #1996.. As I mentioned in the comment directly above test.ExecRun, when I run this command for real, the CLI exits 1 with no such file or directory. The test, however, doesn't capture that in either Stderr or Stdout, and I'm not sure why. Removing the commented Stderr anyway though.. Pushed an update to only display the error if CONVOX_DEBUG is non-empty. Would that work?. Fixed. @MiguelMoll do you have a suggestion? Or would it be enough just add Only users of the Convox docker hub would be able to use make builder without changes. in a comment there?. Good point, fixed. I added this because the CLI prints a different message if the AWS CLI hasn't been installed than the one it prints if the AWS CLI is installed but not configured. I don't know how to mock-toggle this in local tests, so in other words, the test output will be different locally (since we all have the AWS CLI installed) vs in Travis (which doesn't).. If these aren't unset, then they are present in the test suite environment. In order to test rack installs when no credentials are found, we need there to not be any credentials in the host environment.. I don't think there are any side effects (since we're executing bin/test, not sourcing it). The envvar isn't unset in the host environment permanently, only in the environment of the bash process that's running bin/test.\nIMO in any test where an env var is accessed, we should set it explicitly, e.g. via:\n\nCommand: \"FOO=bar convox install -h\"\nos.Setenv(...)\nin the Env field of the ExecRun struct\n\n...rather than relying on the environment of the user running the tests (with the obvious exceptions where we want the envvar to affect the test suite, like PKG and TEST).\nWDYT?. Ok, I'm only testing one line of the help output in my latest commit.. Fixed. Whoops, thanks. Sorry, I don't see what you mean here. I was trying to use the same style as here, is that not the way to go?. I just used the same sleep time as here. I haven't tested with 2-3 seconds, but can if you think 5 seconds is too long here..

    "spencerhakim": "@ddollar I picked this up last night actually, but got distracted when I discovered Docker 1.13 broke make test, as the Docker CLI now makes a couple of extra API calls on startup (I'll make a separate issue about this). Anyway, I just need to address the Hound issues and I'll open a PR, if that's cool with @nzoschke.. I added some new tests, and the diffs on the generated fixtures looked correct, though I'm hardly an expert on CloudFormation. My only concern is how I handled PortMappings in the ECSTaskDefinition; I'm not clear on when/how host ports are selected (random?), and while you'd normally have a parameter such as MainPort443Host generated and referenced, I'm not sure how dependent that is on actually having an ELB (which you wouldn't have for UDP or convox.balancer=false), so right now it generates\n\"443:5000/tcp\"\ninstead of\njson\n{\n  \"Fn::Join\": [\n    \":\",\n    [\n      {\n        \"Ref\": \"MainPort443Host\"\n      },\n      \"5000/tcp\"\n    ]\n  ]\n}\nin those scenarios. Could definitely use some guidance on this. As always, any additional feedback would be appreciated.. Sorry if I wasn't clear, that's still the behavior for TCP ports with ELBs enabled (see here), the new behavior I described only affects UDP ports, which can't use ELBs, or TCP ports when convox.balancer=false. I have a fixture with both behaviors here.. Side note: make fixtures currently only generates missing .json files, but the documentation seems to suggest that it should regenerate all of them.. So, is there anything else that needs to be done with this? I've removed WIP from the PR name as I think I've done everything I should.. Most of the hound issues are from pre-existing code that I had just moved around. I can add comments to that stuff if you'd like; is it an on-going process in general to add comments to existing code?. Not a problem, I'm glad to hear that that's an ongoing goal for the codebase and am happy to contribute.. Not sure why, but the unit tests started failing after the rebase, both locally and on Travis.

Any reason we can't get this merged soon?. @MiguelMoll Done.. @mattmanning I started on that over here. Feel free to use it as a starting point and close the PR.. @advance512 Linking depends on a load balancer, so if you explicitly disable the creation of a load balancer then, yes, it breaks linking.\nhttps://convox.com/docs/linking/#ports. @advance512 That doesn't really work due to the somewhat ephemeral nature of containers. Not sure if there's even a clean way Convox could support that if they wanted to. Certainly outside the scope of this PR. If avoiding ELBs is a priority for you, you should look into using a service discovery system like etcd or Consul.. @advance512 For the dd-agent example, if you set the label convox.agent=true (which scales the process to exactly one instance per EC2 host) and expose 8125/udp, you can do something like export EC2_HOSTNAME=$(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/local-hostname) and get a poor man's service discovery by just pointing your app at ${EC2_HOSTNAME}:8125. dd-agent is actually what motivated me to work on this PR and the convox.agent PR.\nFor more info on that curl endpoint: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html.

I have no idea why the test failed. I just re-ran make templates fixtures and there weren't any changes, but running make test a dozen times in a row produced one random failure. Race condition in how the YAML is parsed, maybe?. Rebased, and thankfully the tests passed this time. @nzoschke, looks good?. @nzoschke Got some fixes in and rebased. Thanks for testing this on a rack for me, last time I tried to build a dev rack I couldn't get it working right.. Ah, you're right, taskDefinitions should've been an array, but I had left it as an object. Fixing.... Ugh, fixed. Can't seem to catch a break with these tiny syntax mistakes, I'm finding it weirdly difficult to reason about the output of the CF template stuff.. Hmm, I suspected that the default scale count might be an issue, but thought that the way my code worked it'd just ignore that task and start agents on the remaining instances. Might be a race condition with the task pending but not running? Easiest solution is probably to just default the scale count to 0 when convox.agent=true.\nAs for convox ps, I don't know the internals there at all, any ideas what the problem might be?. I haven't had a chance to look at this the past few days, but I'll be coming back to it over the holiday weekend.. Agents default to 0 scale count now, and I added some code to prevent changing that. Travis failed because of the same race condition or whatever as before.. @nzoschke Hmmm, it seemed to me that it would be controlled by the CloudFormation template here and here. If that's not the case, then you'd probably know better than I would about where this should be handled.. But shouldn't that get overwritten by this switch case? Or is app.Parameters not already populated by the CF template? Either way, I changed scale to use .DefaultParams().. But shouldn't that get overwritten by this switch case?

Regarding the compiled templates, is there a reason that they're tracked in git? I think it'd solve a lot of problems if they were ignored and just compiled as part of the normal build process.. I debated with myself heavily on how to handle this. I think a proper State enum to encapsulate Protocol + Public and ensure that UDP ports are never accidentally set to public would be cleanest, but I opted for the less invasive option of simply adding Protocol and leaving Public untouched. I'm still debating whether or not to go back and refactor it.. Sorry, just to clarify, you think it makes sense to go back and change it, or to leave it as is?. No, but I can remove it if you'd like, though it's probably a good idea to leave it. http://editorconfig.org/. Removed. And that's fine with me, it's your project after all..

    "advance512": "Did this PR break envvar based linking when convox.balancer=false?. Would it not make sense to at least pass one of the created container's endpoint details?. @till \nI am pretty sure many others have been in this same boat, and in fact this might be the \"killer feature\" that prevents the project from being more popular among small startups and enthusiasts. I have 8 microservices in my project (and this will expand, a microservice per external system I interface into), but only one public access point. That is $140 that I would pay for no reason at all. Too bad, because I really like Convox otherwise.\nAnyways, this missing feature might sadly be the reason I will stop using Convox and move to some sort of K8s based solution (like Rancher, Mantl or OpenShift - or many others).\nFor now, after deployment, I've created a small script that runs convox api get /apps/APP_NAME/processes, and updates DNS records in Route53 in which I've created an Private Zone (microservice.app_name.internal). Using convox env, I manually set the LINK env vars (MICROSERVICE_HOST=microservice.app_name.internal, MICROSERVICE_PORT=5000) and in the composition I set the ports to be: 5000:5000/tcp. \nNot very fun, definitely not production worthy, but it works.. @till  - that sounds great. Will have a look - though I think it is quickly nearing the same complexity as having a Consul cluster which is what I was trying to avoid.\nCan you explain how you're using dd-agent? I don't see any code, just that you opened port 8125 UDP. . I tried using Consul and Linkerd. Let me just say it's very, very complex with Convox.\nThere are no guides or tutorials to be found. To create consul cluster, you'd need the addresses of all the Consule servers to bootstrap together (using TCP, not HTTP), and there is simply no easy way to do that in Convox, at least none that I could find. \nThe best article I found suggests on the matter suggests to use Networking mode: Host in an ECS task definition to make things easier, but that means you're exiting the Convox world into \"direct to ECS\" world. You'd probably need to define DNS records that point at your Consul servers. Of course, each time you upgrade/modify your Rack, this will break. You could deploy the Consul servers on their own standalone EC2 instances. However, you'd still need Consul clients and Consul-Registrator on each ECS instance. Adding Linkerd for a network mesh puts you in the same problem as with the Consul servers, the need for hard-set peers that are enumerable, and not via ELBs.\nThen there are issues with docker-compose vs local vs remote - e.g. you need networks in the docker-compose to make it work, and it indeed works with Docker Compose but not with convox start, you would need to create an exterior network. (In production, you'd need links. depends_on also works in some places and not others.. I don't remember exactly.)\nI am sure it is doable, but after spending nearly 2 days trying to get this to work I eventually gave up. I've gone back to working, again, with multiple ELBs as is the Convox recommended way. I am actively waiting for the new ALB feature, but - if it doesn't arrive soon - I might have to migrate to Kubernetes. I was trying to avoid this due to not wanting to spend a lot of time on DevOps work at this point in the life of the project.. but I also can't spend hundreds of dollars per month for ELBs, either..

I've actually tested it all locally and I know shorter names work. In terms of longer names I haven't done anything extensive with it. I imagine other people have three letter apps tho.. @MiguelMoll It's not a blocker more like a major inconvenience because i have to add -a appname every time and would have to make sure the team knows what app name makes to what repo as opposed to being immediately discoverable\n. The need for the rule change started here: https://github.com/convox-archive/kernel/issues/110 but then docker addressed it here: https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/8447. I don't see anything that addresses issues with AWS however at least in terms of making the name shorter. I can understand about long names however. More than 30 characters for an application name seems like more an inconvenience anyhow.. @mwarkentin Heck yes. that I didn't know.. Somehow the build started failing on CI when i made more changes.

I'll rebase to master and push it all back up.. @MiguelMoll changes don't seem bad but I'm curious, are some of the wildcard requirements not capable of being restricted to a specific account? I'm not that adamant about it but I would definitely prefer something more restrictive that more permissive.. Ahh ok.

I could add another test to build_test that imports a file from fixtures to test the file/-f part of the code.  Thoughts?. ugh didn't test < version, only | and missed the nuance of cat foo | convox import vs convox import < foo\nsorry :P\nNice catch :D. I believe this works - tho the support for the --wait flag via options smells a little.  Ideas?. @MiguelMoll good question.\nThis came out of a need to automate the provisioning of multiple environments in a deployment pipeline.  However, containers were not able to come up because they did not have the resource endpoint of the RDS instance they were trying to use.  This meant that a script had to keep polling the status of the convox RDS resource before proceeding to deploying the app.. \ud83d\ude22 . agreed - I liked named vars for the self documenting properties, you are right to it should match the style of the rest of the code.  I have added a 1 liner documenting description.. I did update the fixture manifest\\fixtures\\env-test.env which I believe is what is fed to the test server - does this mean that this is coded elsewhere?. done. ok - I see this breaks travis-ci :( - reverted. I thought putting it here was better as target Id is used around line 385. nice catch - TIL. ",

If you are running multiple instances then they end up in the next round robin selected container.

It seems like ECS in eu-north-1 does not have an Amazon Linux 2 AMI available so it might not work yet?. We just tried to get convox running in WSL connecting to Docker running on the host windows. It seems to require a tcp socket instead of a sock file so would it be possible to configure this with a flag or env var?. Damn. I was hoping I was on to something...\n\nRight, I'll see if I can get a smaller test setup up and running.... oh yeah. good call!. isn't this the case for resources too then?. and it seems to be on par with the aws provider \nhttps://github.com/convox/rack/blob/master/provider/aws/formation/app.json.tmpl#L421\nhttps://github.com/convox/rack/blob/master/provider/aws/template.go#L103\nperhaps they should change to use upper / upperName instead?. or no nvm...that seems to be \"the other way around\".
