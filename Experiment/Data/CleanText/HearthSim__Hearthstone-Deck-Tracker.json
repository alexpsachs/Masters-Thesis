    "azeier": "This seems to be happening when you minimize hearthstone. \nMy latest commit (e63d749) manages to get most of the overlay back ontop of hs (all the up elements) but not the card images. Cards do however reappear after clicking out of hs and back in, without minimizing it again.  \nIn short: \nminimizing hs and bringing it back to normal => overlay there without images\nunfocusing and refocusing hs after that  => images back again. \nAny ideas?\n. Haven't heard anything about this in a while. Might be fixed.\n. You can also set VisibleOverlay to true, that will make the overlay have a blue tint instead of being transparent and move it with OffsetX and OffsetY. You should be able to make it line up with hearthstone using those.\nI still don't have the slightest clue why this happens :/. Or how to get the \"correct\" resolution, for that matter.\n. Could you clear the custom values in the config (or just rename your config for the time being) and try if replacing your exe with this one fixes it?\n. Well it was worth a try. Then I'm all out of ideas again.\n. This is what's used to get the window size. And that seems to be for some reason incorrect in some cases. All reports I got on this were laptop users, is that the case with you as well? Not sure what that means but it sure means something.\nDoes the cardage shifting happen after the opponent hand changed (play/draw)? That happens because the labels are on a parabola that shifts to the left/right depending on the handcount, to match the card locations. So the same thing should happen without alt-tabbing.\n. So I guess the shifting is then somehow related to the resolution problems. \nNo logging of that currently. Before I add that, your hearthstone window actually the resolution  it says it is? (screenshot -> paint, draw selection)\n. So that's probably all the logging will tell us anyway then. I mean.. I  could just add an option to scale the overlay down by 20% if that's consistent (which is the problem, since I haven't heard too many reports about it and I can't reproduce it either)... is the offset 0,0 in all cases?\n. Is the offset at least consistent with the 20%?\nYeah, if I could think of a soution I would probably try to fix it asap, but I really can't. And once you set the custom values it would work just fine, so that's okay I suppose.\n. You are awesome :).\nGot it fixed now. \n. yay!\n. Completely forgot about that, yes, thanks.\n. Looks good, thanks!\n. Somewhere in 2/3: \n- Display chances of the opponent having cards next turn (hand + next draw) \nSomewhere in step 4 or later: \n- detect that the opponent probably does not have a certain card on hand if he did not play it on a turn where he would've gotten good value for it. So if we had a 4/4, a 3/1 and a 2/1 on the board on turn 4, but the opponent-druid did not swipe, chances are he does not have one in hand.\n. http://www.elie.net/blog/hearthstone/i-am-a-legend-hacking-hearthstone-with-machine-learning-defcon-talk-wrap-up\n\nWhy we are not releasing our tool?\nOne thing you won\u2019t see posted, however, is a software tool that we promised to release during our Defcon presentation. Following Defcon  we had a series of conversations with the Hearthstone team about our research \u2014 apparently the email that I sent prior to Defcon didn\u2019t reach the right person. They like our research on game/cards balance and are very enthusiastic and supportive about it.\nOn the other hand, they were very concerned that our real time dashboard that can predict your opponent\u2019s deck will break the game balance by giving that person (that is, whoever has the tool) an unfair advantage. They also expressed concern that such a tool makes the game less fun by taking away some of the decision-making from the player. It was a difficult decision \u2014 I invested a lot of our time building our real-time dashboard tool with Celine \u2014 but we agree with the Hearthstone team and will not release the tool publicly.\n\nSo this is probably no longer a good idea (for this project).\n. I went the other way around with 0.2.9 for now. Decks in the tracker can be exported to hearthstone. Not quite as \"good\" as automatic detection if you use your own decks but it has the upside that decks can be imported from websites into hearthstone!\n. 99% sure that's done by observing the traffic between the hearthstone client and the server, which is technically against the TOS. Otherwise I'd be doing that :). \nOr even by directly reading memory.\n. While we're on the topic:\nThe naxx update contained the follwing new strings: \n- GLUE_COLLECTION_DECK_PASTE_POPUP_HEADER - Paste Deck\n- GLUE_COLLECTION_DECK_PASTE_POPUP_MESSAGE - This will erase your existing deck and replace it with the contents of the clipboard, are you sure?\n  (source)\nIf that gets added, copy pasting decks from hearthstone into the tracker should be no problem :).\n. Solved with the new HearthstoneTextBlock\n. Merged. Hope I did that right, still not used to git..\nThanks!\n. Check out the options, it's the last checkbox in the opponent's section iirc. \n. No problem :).\n. Does this happen even with 0.2.8?\n. I just tried with the settings you mentioned and it works fine for me. There could be an issue with an old config for some reason I guess. Do you experience the same problems with a clean \"install\"/unzip?\n. Then I'm not sure what the problem is. Does the standard: restaring HS, tracker, and starting tracker as admin do anything? \nAlso: do the decks reset when you start a new game?\n. If admin does not  do anything either try these things:  \n1) check if the \"log.config\" in \"%localappdata%/Blizzard/Hearthstone\" is the same as in \"Hearthstone Deck Tracker/Files\"\n2) close HS and the tracker and delete \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Hearthstone\\Hearthstone_Data\\output_log.txt\" (or wherever your HS dir is)\n. My guess on how 0.2.9 fixed it for wodecraft is that there was some weird config issue. Does the problem persist if you delete/rename your config file?\n. I assume you checked the config.log file in appdata?\nCould you upload your output_log file after 2 games? Just conceding two practice games should do.\n. Okay, that helps. Your log only contains Zone messages, it should however also contain Bob and Power. Bob is used to determine when a game ends. \nDelete the log.config, start hearthstone (and not the tracker), concede a practice game and look at the generated output_log. \nIf it still contains Zone messages: hs, for whatever reason,  might be using another log.config, search your computer for it (I doubt this is the case). \nIf it does not contain Zone messages: close hs and copy the log.config from the tracker to appdata (or just start the tracker and it will do it for you). Do another practice game. If the decks do still not reset and the log still only contains Zone messages... I'm not sure... \n. I had been hanging out  in #hearthtrack on irc.freenode.net a bit when the whole merging projects discussion started, guess that would be the easiest. Other than that I usually answer reddit pms regularly.\n. That's me. \n. Excellent :)\n. I'm actually gonna reopen this open for visibility. Seems to be a problem from time to time.\n. Solution to this is above: replace \"%localappdata%/Blizzard/Hearthstone/log.config\" with the one in the \"[Tracker]/Files\" folder.\n. Seems to be fixed by now.\n. An option, where golden cards are prioritized, runs into issues where you only want to add one card. For two its easy, click gold twice, click normal twice but with only one card there is no way to know if the normal card needs to be clicked as well.  \nThe only (good) solution I can think of here is image recognition. It's definitely on the list of things I wanna add though.\n. Sounds like a good idea.\nI suppose you would want to be able to see the information from the \"My Decks\" screen? My first thought was putting it in the \"New Deck/editing\" but that's probably pretty inconvenient.\nTwo options I can think of are: \n1) reduce the size of the deck display in \"My Decks\" by ~30% and put a textfield below it. \n2) have a button to display a flyout with the notes, the same way it's done for the tags. (so many buttons...) \nPersonally I think I prefer the second option. Lets you have a bigger textfield and keeps UI cleaner.\n. That would mean the window would have to change sizes when switching between tabs. I don't really like that.\nHeres what I think might work:\n\n\nWith this you could edit the notes directly from \"My Decks\".\n. Good :). I should get around to implementing that tomorrow. So it should be there with the next update, which should come out some time between tomorrow and the weekend,\n. This sounds very similar to #12. \nDoes this happen exclusively with arena?\nWhat logged first should not matter I think. It's the other way around in practice games as well and those always work fine for me. If it does for some reason matter, I already fixed that unintentinally for the next update :). \n. Thanks. Reloading the deck usually fixes this as far as I know. I haven't had too much time to test, but I think some changes I made for the new update may actually fix this. \n. closing this one since #26 contains more information\n. Uhm.. I don't think that even possible code-wise. Maybe hearthstone messed up the log. Not gonna worry about this for now. let me know if it happens again.\n. I'm gonna close this for now. Reopen if it happens again.\n. This is somethings that's planned, check out #6 step 4. \n@flipperbw: any progress on the deck predition?\n. Probably not any time soon, sorry. I heard, that the hearthstats.net uploader has similar functionality and works on mac. Maybe check that out.\n. merged.\n. You mean export right, so tracker -> generate deck in hearthstone? That's the stupid hearthstone feature that let's you search for text on cards :). Windfury had the same problem and there's probably one or two more I missed thus far. Fixed it for fireball now.\n. Should be fixed with 0.2.13\n. Is this only an issue since 0.2.12 or did it happen before?\nI think it's actually some weird windows issue, where windows that aren't supposed to be topmost are set topmost. The next update will contains a possible fix where, if hearthstone is activated, the overlay will refresh it's topmost status. \n. Let me know if 0.2.13 improved anything. \n. Good :). Closed for now then.\n. I think it's a problem where draws are just ignored sometimes. I had that happen with the opponent once. No idea if it's the same problem on the player side but it very well might be. The weird thing is, reloading the deck fixes the counts. at least when it happens for the opponent. I would assume it will work the same here. \nI will add a more detailed debug log when I have the time. That should help figuring out where the problem is.\n. I think re-reading parts of a game is quite a good amount of effort. Too much,  for something I'm not even sure works, probably. \nReloading the game on every draw might be an option. I will do this if more detailed debug logs don't help. \nHow often does the problem occur for you? \n. Random guess: if you increase the UpdateDelay in the config.xml from 100 to 1000, does that change anything? \n. Oh really? I didn't expect that to work. That gives me a pretty good idea where the problem is. \nDo you notice the increased delay in any way? \n. 99% sure I just found the reason for this bug and for #31 and fixed it ! :D\n. This should be fixed with the latest release (v0.2.16)\n. This may also be fixed with 0.2.16? I'm not sure, will have to test.\n. Seems fixed.\n. There is. In the options there is next to the \"Decks\" a \"Timer\" tab. I should probably make that more visible.\n. Check out #16. There probably will be an option for that in the future.\n. I like that idea, I'm on it.\n. Done. With the next update, when saving a deck in \"edit-mode\" you will be asked whether you want to overwrite or save it as new.\n. This should be fixed with the latest release (v0.2.16)\n. Nope.. just had it happen again\n. See #28. (In the options there is, next to the \"Decks\", a \"Timer\" tab.)  \nWould probably be good if you could leave this issue open for others to see.\n. See #28.

I understand what you mean, however I don't think that's easily doable without capping the fps of hearthstone at 60 again while the overlay is active.  \nThe \"additional windows\"  contain a timer window now. Maybe you could use that one.\n.

I tried removing that because I don't like it either,  but it looked weird with the \"jagged\" border (also I'm not good with photoshop :) ). \nHappy to hear you enjoy it! I will probably separate the timer window from the decks some time tomorrow-ish. That way you won't have to close the deck windows on every start. Also maybe add an option to make it transparent. \n.

This is reasonable and I will probably add it. In the mean time you have two options I can think of: \n1) you could create empty log.config and output_log.txt files where they normally belong. The tracker should run with that. But as you said, you can't export decks aside from moving your PlayerDecks.xml. Maybe having the tracker in e.g. Dropbox could work. \n2) create decks on e.g. Hearthpwn and import them from there. \n. This is reasonable and I will probably add it.

That is intended behaviour to make sure 2 copies are added when the player only has one normal and golden version. For more information on why prioritizing golden cards is currently not available see #16.\n. Oh, thanks. That should be easily fixable. \n. Now fixed for the nxt update.\n. It did, thanks :). \n. Very happy to hear you like it!\n. I'm gonna look into it. Any specific cards it tends to happen with?\nPressing the all mana button is a good suggestion. \n. I'd guess it's a problem with the gold-card detection, but you can try increasing the < ClickDelay > in the config file (around line 70) to maybe 100.\n. Added with release v0.3.7\n. Added with release v0.3.7\n. Are you trying to stream the overlay-window? As far as I know, that's not possible due to transparency. You can either stream your whole screen or try it with the additional deck windows.\n. Done! WIth the next update there will be an option for that.\nThe exe I linked in #54 also includes that option already. So feel free to just replace yours with it.\n. First one I know about, same thing for all non-standard cards (e.g. Dream cards). \nSecond one is new to me. I'll look into it. If that happens again, could you try and see if restarting the tracker (mid game) fixes it? Also could you then upload your output_log.txt (hearthstone/Hearthstone_Data directory)? \n. I was hoping blizzards occasinally weird game logic would be messing this up but the log seems fine at first glance.. \nDo you remember which cards were wrongfully marked as stolen? left or right of the bananas?\n3rd and fourth banana not being added is weird, count is not capped.\n. still, he played the banana right? the question is was S mark on the left or the right of the actual banana. So on a card drawn before or drawn after the banana. No matter what the actual card is.\nI assume you won't remember that. But if you notice, that could be helpful.\nI'm not too concerned with the count being wrong. It's weird (and I would still like to fix it) but it doesn't really affect anything.\n. There is logging, but only for debug builds at the moment. I should probably just switch it to trace logging and have it create files.\n. Not at the moment. I should get around to add some more detailed logging tomorrow. \n. It's a bit more detailed now. Since I don't really want to release an update just for that: replace your exe with this one for now http://www.mediafire.com/download/rd7ybb93dnjjwoe/v0.3.9-logging-exeonly.rar\n.

Makes sense, done.\n. Added with release v0.3.7\n. Did this happen more than once? Any change from restating hearthstone and the tracker?\nI just played a game and the card was counted as bring drawn, marked as in hand for the time is was and the card is drew was also correctly counted as bring drawn. This happening only with cards drawn from Azure Drake doesn't make much sense, actually, because the log for that is exactly the same as any other draw.\n. No it's fine :) lol. Always good to hear things are actually working.\n. Fixed for the next update. (a30fbde)\n. Fixed with release v0.3.8.\n. Is that in \"No deck\"-mode?\n. The crashing is fixed for the next update, not sure what the error is about. Maybe some not allowed characters that I missed? Does it happen with all decks?\n. I just fixed it. So unless you need screenshots right now you don't have to rename them.\n. Should now be fixed with release v0.3.8\n. The current behaviour is sort of intended as you can easily overwrite decks you didn't mean to otherwise. \nThe only good solution I can come up with is saving the URL and checking that when importing.

Added with release v0.3.8\n. Hey\n1. While  that would be pretty cool, it would (especially with multiple languages, if I don't \"build\" the cards myself) significantly increase the size of the app. Looking at the unity files, all the cards would be around 100mb. I could maybe link to e.g. hearthhead in some way.. \n2. They actually are highlighted (small border around the selected deck). Pretty poorly though, I admit that :). I'll see if I can find a better way. \n3. Yeah I know about that but never considered it much of an issue. It's possible to avoid that however. I'm gonna look into it.\n. 1. Well that's what the dds files are at least. Just checked hearthpwn, their pngs are the same size. Even is you reduce it by 50% that's still 50mb :/ (times 12).\n2. That color is based on the selected accent. I could change the background but I sorta like that gray. Maybe just something like this: > name <\n3. That was easier than expected, fixed for the next update. \n4. You got me confused with the hashtag there for a second :D. Something along these lines amazing photoshop skills? Probably in newdeck and mydecks.\nEdit: this may actually be the way to go on 2. (I can't believe how much better the names look in bold instead of black...)\n. 2 and 3 hopefully improved/fixed with Release v0.3.8.\n. 10 MB per language seems actually quite realistic at decent quality. But you'd probably run into a lot of issues with files names unless I provide downloads for all of them myself. \nWhile it would be a neat feature, there's a lot of other stuff still on my todo list (and this now too). So.. maybe/hopefully at some point, but most likely not in the too near future.\n. Manacurve: http://imgur.com/a/B3Vo0\n.

Using html tags in wpf doesn't seem all that straight forward.\n. Everything added with release v0.3.10\n(except tooltips in the overlay, that's probably gonna be fun)\n. I don't think rarity or the flavour text are all that helpful and would be useless clutter more than anything. Race however is probably a good idea. With that I should also include the race (and the card text) in the text-filter I suppose.\nedit: Added the race change :).\n. Thanks, fixed the durability. Still the health icon right now though (which is fine I guess). Same reason as the icons being displayed on spells, didn't find a good way to hide them yet.\n. Actually just found an easy way of doing it.\nSpell (this looks so empty)\nWeapon\n. :)\nIngame tooltips become a little more difficult because the overlay doesn't have any collision but I will see what I can do. \nDo you actually turn the tracker on/off on such a regular basis where you need a hotkey? With the options to hide it in background and menu I never felt the need to turn it off at all.\n. Overlay tooltips!\n. The next update will contain an option to have the files in the tracker directory again (I uploaded the exe containing that change earlier: http://www.mediafire.com/download/rd7ybb93dnjjwoe/v0.3.9-logging-exeonly.rar). Just having the whole tracker in the dropbox should be fine right?\n. Officially added with release v0.3.10\n.

Both silence and claw should be working with the update I just released.\n. Thanks for the report. I'm gonna release a fix for that in the next hour.\nedit: v0.3.11 is relased and should solve that problem.\n. That sounds like the weird premission issuee someone had a while back.\nTry creating the Tracker, Images and Files directory by hand and dropping the files in there.\n. That's been on the wishlish pretty much since day 1 (see #7). I don't really know when it will happen though.\n. That's one of things I tried for fixing the dpi issue (which obviously didn't work) but I went back to window rect because I didn't really want to change all the things you mentioned for basically no effect. \nSoooo.. If you could add that.. :)\n. I think just working on your fork and creating pull requests from that/committing to this pr should work fine. I'm not thaaat experienced with github either, especially when is comes to things like that. \n. That's acutally more or less the way I inteded it to be. Not for the case you described, but for the case where you import/create mutiple decks. Chances are if plan tag those decks, you most likely want all of them to have the same tag. That has at least been my experience with it. \nSo the way to go might be to clear the tags after editing but not after saving a new deck?\nedit: how was my first sentence not \"it's not a bug, it's a feature\"?!\n. Funny, I was sure I used that a bunch of times and it worked. Maybe I'm imagining things. But it seems to work fine now with d1a5f3d.\n. I just tried it multiple times with all resolutions, deck name was set 100% of the time. \nIs this maybe happening with your ClientRect change?\n. What exactly is your question? Or what is your goal? \nHave a checkbox to turn this logging of game on/off? Do you just want to know how/where to do it? Me to do it?\nNeed a bit more information :)\n. Is this along the lines of what you imagined? Saves to \"PlayerName_12.07.2014 094303.xml\".\n. No way to automatically get playernames from the log as far as I know, sorry.\n. Small thing you might want to consider is that the enemy cards only contain cards actually played, whereas the player cards contains all cards drawn. \n. In the current form only IDs are saved anyway, so manual editing is a bit more difficult. And both players will be using the tracker I suppose? So you have a) matching dates (so you can see if one of the files has been edited after) and b) aside from cards that were only drawn, not played, the same history twice. \n. edit the deck, save and overwrite, that should sort it correctly.\n. In addition to this I changed the minimum value of the sliders.\n. yup :) looks good now, thanks!\n. I actually started working on this a while back, mostly as a proof of concept. Check out the feature/opponent-deck-prediction branch. \nThe main problem I had with it (and the main reason I put it on hold) is the crazy amout of data you need to download all the time to keep it up to date with the current meta. That's at least when using client side html scraping, which is clearly not the way to go. The optimal solution is probably having an exclusive database for the tracker that gets updated periodically.\n. The problem I see with that is that everyone who does not have (at least) dozens of decks saved won't get accurate/any results.\nAlso if you, as you suggested, completely eliminate a deck by after one missmatch, the chances of actually finding a match are pretty slim. Lots of decks have slight variations. I played with the prototype  a bit (using a database of over 500 decks) and often times it wouldn't find a 100% match. . \nNow if you don't do that, try to find the \"best match\" and just mark card's that don't match you end up with very bad results the less deck you have saved. \nI don't think there is really a good way around having a database for this feature.\n. Only using tracker-decks should be pretty quick and easy to implement though. So I'll probably have a look at it within the next few days. \n. Having a script that grabs new decks from the major websites periodically is probably the smallest problem.\n. I'm trying to think what the benefit of that would be but I can't really come up with one. The only valuable information is that your opponent no longer has the displayed cards in his deck/hand, right? Regardless what happend to them.\n. But.. if it shows on the list of played cards it is no longer in his hand.\n. Ah okay, I see what you're getting at. \nI'm not quite sure if I'm a big fan of introducing more colors but sure, I'll see what I can do.\n. Replace your exe with this one: http://www.mediafire.com/download/l1fp8cp5lpf7p33/v0.3.16_discard-highlighting_exe-only.rar (or compile the latest commit) and let me know what you think.\nEnable in Options > Decks > Opponent, last checkbox\n. Added with v0.3.17\n. Two issues I see right now: \n1) public double SearchBoxY = 0.89; would be the value with title bar, so 0.92 was the correct one.\n2) SearchBoxY needs a different name because existing configs will keep the old value. \n. Would be easier/cleaner to do it here. I'm sure I can somehow commit to this pr but I couldn't figure out how yet. \n. Looks good. Yeah I don't know about the delay either. It seemes to work fine but I think I had some issues without it when I first implemented it. Maybe that was something else. \n. Added with 6cd7ee4\n. Since the log only contains things that actually happen to cards (draw, mulligan,...), I'm 99% sure there is no way to detect that the opponent didn't mulligan anything. \nThere is a small chance that the method that's used to distinguish random draws from draws that indicates new turn might work here but I don't think that will be the case. \n. Yes. The log contains things like \"deck -> hand\", \"hand -> deck\" or \"hand -> play\".\n. Oh, I accidentally fixed that on the stats branch. Thanks,\n. ~~Try increasing the  and  in the config.xml (found in \"%appdata%/HearthstoneDeckTracker\", both values are in milliseconds).~~\nAlso capslock might be interfering I guess. \nScrew the first, it's either some weird interaction with capslock or your shift key got stuck. The first a comes from the tracker pressing ctrl-a before inserting the name.\n. Already edited :) \n. And you don't have control switched with another key? \n. Fix released with v0.3.16. \n. Oh, how did I never realize that the text gets highlighted automatically :).\n. Possible, yes but not all that easy. It's on the list of things I would like to add eventually. (#7)\n. Gonna close this since there already is an issue on this topic.\n. Added with v0.3.17\n. open the config.xml file in \"%appdata%/HearthstoneDeckTracker\" and change the  to the new location.\nIf the tracker can't find the hearthstone.exe it should usually ask you to set the directory. Does the old installation still exist?\n. Try downloading it again, but click the green button, not the one that says source code :). \n. Make sure you download the Hearthstone.Deck.Tracker... file (green button), not the \"Source code\" one. (here)\n. Before you delete anything, what's the error message?\n. Alright. Does navigating to \"%appdata%/HearthstoneDeckTracker\" work? If it does, upload your playerdecks.xml file and I'll see if I can fix it. \n. just pasting \"%appdata%/HearthstoneDeckTracker\" into your explorer bar should work, including the % before end after appdata.\n. Or do you have saving in appdata disabled?\nEven though.. then it should just create the files and not give you an error message.\n. uh.. There's not much to be fixed. Try coping your old playerdecks.xml to the appdata location (and overwrite). Depending on how old it is you shouldn't lose much.\n. From what version did you update? Try deleting the playerdecks.xml in appdata and see if the latest version starts.\n. What should work is, downloading all the versions you missed and running every one once. But that's not really a good solution I suppose. If you send me your old decks file I can maybe fix it. \nNot a problem :).\n. Hey! :)\nHere's a mix of open issues and my todo list:\n- Automatic deck recognition with OCR would be amazing, if you have experience with that. I tried but couldn't really get it to work properly. So importing from screenshots and images in general.\n- A way to reorder  decks or sort by e.g. name\n- More card sorting options (Options>Decks>Sorting)\n- Hiding the opponent cards when the friendlist icon is clicked\n- A way to set cards as \"in collection\", so that when you import decks from a website, you can see which you need to switch out\n- Numbers in the \"New-Deck\" manacurve are not resetting properly after saving\n- Replace position sliders with an \"unlock\" option, that allows for overlay elements to be dragged around\n- A better solution to the \"More...\" flyout and the mess of buttons in general\n- OBS doesn't seem to automatically recognize the deck windows. Not sure if that's just because they are child windows or if there's a fix for that.\nYou can also email me at epikz37@gmail.com if you have any questions about the above, the code (some of it is pretty messy..), have ideas, need help, anything :)\n. Hm. What would so suggest instead of / in addition to the clear button? Just discarding the deck when leaving the \"New Deck\" tab is probably not a good idea. \n. You mean the \"my deck\", \"new deck\" etc. buttons? That's the metro TabControl style. I like that quite a bit personally. Maybe having a different background on the non-selected tab headers could help but I think I tried that while back and there were some issues with that. \nYes I get what you mean. I don't really have a good idea how to do that though..\n. That's what I meant, yes. Just settings the background property results in this though: http://i.imgur.com/3qoxCuN.png (spacing between the backgrounds / size in general)\nOne possiblity would be replacing the tabcontrol with a TransitioningContentControl and have decent buttons so switch between the contents\n. That might be a problem with the metro dll yes. \n. guess I can close this\n. I for some reason thought that commit was already in the last release. MIght actually be fixed, you're right. Converting to upper is probably a good idea though.\n. So this might work: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12729922/how-to-set-cultureinfo-invariantculture-default\nbut that might cause issues with \"normal\" string comparisons. I don't think there's a way to only do that to toUpper. \nThere should not be much that requires changing anyway. \n. I can compile just fine, what's the problem?\n. shouldn't really.. maybe your deck/config file got messed up for some reason? Try renaming those\n. The alternative would probably be SendInput (User32). There seems to be a nice wrapper for that: http://inputsimulator.codeplex.com/\n. That feature exists: http://i.imgur.com/EgdjHGf.png\n.

It should notify you on (re)start actually. Doesn't it? Maybe that's related to the same issue.\n. Hey :)\nEven though I don't understand a word, that's some pretty cool features you got there! I like the mulligan simulator a lot.\nImporting from french names might be a bit difficult (possible, though only while french is selected in the tracker), at least via the usual method (html scraping).\nDo you by any chance have an API I could get the \"real\" card IDs or english names from? \nOr some sort of table relating your ids (cards/293) to english names / \"real\" ids?\n.

Awesome! :)\nWill be in the next update, which should be released within the next two days.\nJust let me know when you change anything structure wise so I can adjust.\n. Added with release v0.3.18.\n. That's what I was thinking, yes.\nBut might actually be a good idea to wait a while with this. There are still a few things I don't really like about the UI and we're at a point in general where things get renamed/relabled quite a bit. Changing those for 12 different languages all the time would be very annoying.\n. Very cool! :) \nJust FYI though: It's most likely going to be at LEAST one more month before I can even think about this. Probably more. Some time (shortly) before the 1.0.0 release, for which I want the whole stats-thing done, as well as the website (that one is for sure more than one month).\n. We're still at the very beginning (planning, proof of concept). Details are gonna be announced when we're at a point where it makes sense to do so. \n. Thanks. I'm pretty confident it'll be open source as well, so contributions will be welcome! \n. Intersting, thanks.\nThe only reason for this I can come up with right now would be that the new version globally detects mouse clicks. No idea if that's the actual reason though. Doesn't seem happen for me. \n. I like that idea :) done.\n. Added with v0.3.19.\n. Replace your exe with this one: http://www.mediafire.com/download/zt3c6vyflwyk25c/v0.3.18_possible-performance-fix_exeonly.rar and let me know if that improves anything.\n. Possibly fixed with v0.3.19?\n. I'm not sure I can easily get rid of the lag on start. If the log file is big, the tracker has to check quite a few thousand lines. Same if you select a new deck during a game. \nThe lag from clicking however has to be caused by something else. \n. You could I guess, yes. \nOne thing before that though: if you disable the overlay and just use the windows instead, the problems are gone, right?\n. Can you tell me when exactly freezes happen?\n. Can you tell me when exactly freezes happen?\n. That's most likely just the current size of your logfile causing it. If you restart hearthstone once that should be gone. I'm pretty positive the same thing happens with older versions. I will try and see if I can solve that problem somehow, but I'm more concerned with freezes happening caused by clicks / ingame animations. \n.

I'm not quite sure right now why I've decided to fully reset there (the true), that should be the major factor in causing the lag.\n. Okay, how is that?\nThere is still lag if you switch decks during a game but \na) that shouldn't happen too often \nand b) it's not really avoidable unless the logreader runs on another thread. Which, I think, is not really worth the headache, since the only time it would make a difference is when switching decks. Reading the appended lines works perfectly fine using async.\n.

Options > general > other\n. The log is re-read if UseDeck is called during a game, so it shouldn't be an issue.\n. Are you playing practice games? There's sometimes issues with those. Restarting hearthstone might fix that.\n. Hm I don't seem to have that issue, but naxx might have the same issues as practice. The logging is different from \"normal\" games.\n. That's weird. I don't seem to have that issue at all. \n. Close hs, close tracker, delete output_log, start hs, start tracker. Any change?\n. between 3471ed3 and a6aa0ef the log gets cleared after games, but the cursor position stays at the previous end of the file, causing games after the first one not to be tracked.\n. Maybe this 87e42c1 ? Since I don't actually experience any lag, could you try removing those calls on your end? the methods are located in GameEventHandler by now. Line 40, 50, 58, and 135\n. Okay, I got it. It's the mousehook causing it. \nremoving \n_mouseInput = new User32.MouseInput();\n_mouseInput.LmbDown += MouseInputOnLmbDown;\n_mouseInput.LmbUp += MouseInputOnLmbUp;\n_mouseInput.MouseMoved += MouseInputOnMouseMoved;\nin the overlay fixed the issue. (it's the MouseInput itself, not any of the method calls).\nNow on to figuring out how to fix that without removing the hook...\n. I can't seem to find a way to get it working without having the hook in the ui thread. Just removing it would result in the loss of: secret toggling, cards hiding when friendslist is open and draging things around in the overlay (that'd be a pain to revert)... Not really an option,, There has to be a way to make this work\nwhat previous commits do you mean?\n. I will look at that once I figure this out I guess.\n. So what about this...\nRemove the hook by default and only hook the mouse when the overlay gets unlocked, unhook when overlay is gets locked again. \nThat elimites the general lag and keeps that functionality. \nIn addition to that have an option to enable (mouse hook by default) the friendslist and secrets features witht a warning that it might cause lag. \n. Well, by making the overlay non-transparent (1% opacity). But that at the would mean the clicks have to be simulated back to hearthstone, which I don't really want to do. Plus the normal hearthstone cursor would be gone and had to be simulated as well.\nI'm sure there is a way to use the hook asynchronously but until that's figured out this is probably the best solution.\n. Should be fixed (when extra overlay features are disabled) with v0.3.20. \n@skaargaming, yes?\n. Have you tried using the option to hide the overlay while in menu and / or unchecking \"don't reset after game ends\"? \n. I think this one: http://www.mediafire.com/download/3t9fkbc38qdficd/v0.3.19_possible-performance-fix-tabmarker_exeonly.rar should contain the changes. Just replace your current .exe and check if new deck > import contains \"from last game\"\n. Added (or rather removed) with v0.3.20. \n. Can you try this exe: http://www.mediafire.com/download/p07bbcaaayp6hzo/v0.3.19_possible-performance-fix_exeonly.rar and tell me if it changes anything? Basically just sets the process priority to realtime.\n. Alright, this case is apparently related to the log file getting too big. Log now gets cleared after each game (3471ed3).\n.

Importing from hearthstone is very much something I would like to add but it's definitely not possible the way to describe it form the hearthstone log. The only real possibility is text recognition (also see #7). And that's quite the pain to do actually :/.\nExporting to plaintext should be no problem to add however.\n. The biggest problem with that is that the card images the tracker uses are not exactly the same as the ingame ones. Most of them are just pretty close. All of them are handcropped from the original art. \nIn addition to that, comparing 15-30 images to >450 takes probably quite some time. Even if you narrow it down by reading the manacost off the image that's still.. rougly 50 comparisons per cards. \nSo I think there's no way aorund ocr. \n. That not too many. Especially not very many actually used cards, so that should be fine.\nYea I'm not sure what's the best way of doing this.\n. It's still on my todo list :) there are just other things with higher priority right now. Working on an auto-updater as we speak.\nShould be added relatively soon. I might even get it in for the next one, not sure.\n. Okay, where we go. \nCan be enabled in Options > General > Other.\nConsiders the name and text (both in localized versions) and the race/type (english only, because that's the way it's stored in the card files).\nName and text work with partials, so e.g. \"death\" will show all deathrattle cards along with  shadow word: death and deathwing. Race/type only works when the full word is spelled out. \"death dragon\" gives you deathwing, while \"death dra\" gives you nothing.\n. Added the above with release v0.4.2\n. I got the bug.\nAfter minimizing, the Top/Left values get set to -32000 because the Windowstate is still \"Normal\". \nMaking MetroWindow_LocationChanged async and having \nawait Task.Delay(100);\nbefore the windowstate check fixes that. \nThere's probably some other (better) way to update the windowstate I guess?\nit was working previously, because LoadConfig() checked if the value in the config was -32000.\n. I think I had that issue at some point and just \"fixed\" it that way. Not quite sure actually :D. \n. So the good way of fixing it now would be not to re-introduce the -32000-check on load again, but prevent it from saving that. Either checking for -32000 on save or wait for / update the windowstate.\n. I'm not sure doing anything on windowstate change is a good idea though. Is there a \"windowstate-change-ended\" ..or something like that.. event? Dragging the window around would call, I don't know how many, hundreds of  delays/updates.\nI put the problem as a known issue in the release notes for now\n. Added Alt+Space+X. \nSounds good. I'm not at my desk for the next hour at least. So if you wanna create a pr feel free :). \n. Added with Release v0.4.0\n. That is actually editable :) \nThe config (found in \"%appdata%/HearthstoneDeckTracker\") contains fields for \"ClickDelay\" and \"SearchDelay\". Both are in milliseconds.\n. Hm.. Problems with that would be that you can't click through any of the other ui elements anymore, which might be necessary. \nAnd wouldn't work for the friendslist feature either. :/\n. Hey :) \nThe reason for it being the way it is, is that those Bob messages are new with the naxx patch. Certainly makes sense to change that.\nI'll check it out. \n. I guess you figured it out? Sorry for the confusion. I realized too late that the default version class has build and revision switched. But correcting it creates more problems that it solves and since it works fine.. yea. \nOnly detail that keeps this from working is that v0_3_21 needs to be initialized as new Version(0, 3, 21, 0). Apparently revision is -1 by default, which seems to be treated as \"invalid\"/\"not the same type of version\" when comparing versions and returns false for any checks. I'll fix that. \nThanks for the work!\n. Okay, let's try something. Use this exe and enable \"Paste names from clipboard\" in Options > Other > Exporting. Let me know if that works. \n. Not sure what the problem here is. I switched out one card, saved and that one works. http://www.arenavalue.com/s/Plxucw\nJust replace alextraza with the ancient of war and you're good.\n. Maybe the deck you drafted was already on the server prior, but created with an older version of arenavalue where the id's were not stored? \nIf that's the case you shoudn't run into this issue all too often (probably never again).\n. I made the workaround a bit more visible in the release notes now :)\n. Fixed with Release v0.4.0\n. I'm not quite sure if this is the same issue (and I don't know why it worked) but try downloading v0.3.19 run it, close, run 0.3.21 again. \n. Let's leave this open because I really want to know why this works (and how to prevent it)... Maybe someone has an idea. \n. Oh I almost forgot, if you have not deleted them yet, could you send me the crash logs via email (epikz37@gmail.com) or upload them somewhere and link it here? Would me much appreciated. \n. Oh there might not have been an actual crash in your case because it was the version file causing problems. There would be a folder called \"Crash Reports\" (not logs, sorry) in your Hearthstone Deck Tracker folder. \nA few questions in that case if you don't mind :) \nFirst time running the tracker? \nIf not what did you do before the problem? \nUpdate? if yes, from what version?\nAny details you can think of might be helpful.\n. The other report I got in this was \nSystem.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException [...] C:\\Windows\\system32\\Images\\HearthstoneDeckTracker.ico\ninstead of the version file (so that actually threw an unhandled exception). DirectoryNotFoundException is confusing me a bit. The rest of the stacktrace is pretty useless.. filestream, drawing.icon, etc,etc.\nBut in that case it apparently happend after just closing and restarting the tracker (same version, 21).\n. Question remains if that's actually the same issue/cause, but sure can't hurt to add it.\nSlightly simpler way of getting the directory: \nC#\nAppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory\n. ~~Nono, you might still be correct. The exception, when there's an error loading the config file, is just handled but doesn't create a report because I'm smart like that :). See here.~~ Not sure why it would still be running though... huh.. \n. It's too late for me apparently. Has nothing to do with the config, you are right.\nThis whole thing is weird though. And the weirdest part in my opinion is still that running v19 (maybe even just any other version) actually fixes it, while deleting the config/any other files or rebooting does not. \nSo what does that mean? There's some system(?) generated file that get's messed up?\n. Maybe fixed with release v0.4.0\n. Gonna close this for now.\n. Good catch, thanks. \nTwo options to proceed with this: \n1) Remove the autoselection of tags after editing.\n2) Fix the tags not being selected in the flyout.\nI sort of tend towards the first one actually. Thoughts here?\n. That introduces quite a few problems I think. So while it would probably be a nice feature, it might be a bit nasty to implement. \nAnd in case you didn't know: you don't have to click \"more.. > tags\" for every deck, you can switch decks while the tag-tab is open. \n. Already Fixed :)\n. The json files seem to contain the correct id-name pairs. I'm not sure where this goes wrong. \nIf you create a deck with just one fire elemental in it and export that, what name gets searched for, and what shows up? Is this maybe one of the cases where two cards show up, and because there is no golden fire ele, forked lightning gets picked?\n. Nope, that's an easy fix. There are quite a few of those.\nSearching for \"\u00e9clair 3\" should give you only lightning bolt, right?\n. adding the rarity is smart :) I didn't even think of that when I did that for the english version.\n. Hey\nYou can set the language used for cards in options > other :). \nContacting me: aside from here, you can send me emails to epikz37@gmail.com \n. Never too much!\n1. The arena one is obviously seperate because it's a seperate deck :). As for the rest, I'm not sure if there are messages indicating which gamemode was used. There might be. \n2. I had this: http://i.imgur.com/VqYY8ZX.png in one of my earlier versions (actually still on brach feature/games-history+stats). I would very much like to add the game details again at some point and from there that should be pretty easy. \n3. for example?\n4. Only the legend rank I think. Otherwise only via image recognition (which I want to avoid) or manual. \n5. Again, image recognition, OCR or manual. Not eays but doable.\n6. I would like to eventually, yes.\n7. You could do that using clones of the same deck with different tags.\n. 1) I will have a look at the messages.\n3)  sounds reasonable\nI added the whole game history stuff from 2. now :) with the ability to import your opponents (partial) deck. \nNot sure what to do with naming of things yet, \"PlayerDraw\", \"PlayerPlay\" etc in the gamedetails. \nYou may have to delete your old stats for this, I'm not sure. Could also work fine.\n. Also there seems to be a problem where if hearthstone times out while the tracker is running and I try to close hearthstone and the tracker, windows-explorer completely freezes. Not sure what that is about yet...\n. Got all game modes working I think :). Only tested casual ranked and practice, but should be good.\n. Ah! windows crashing seems to be an issue with hearthstone itself, good to know :)\n. The wrong button again...\n. Added with Release v0.4.0\n. Open the config.xml in \"%appdata%/HearthstoneDeckTracker\" and check if  (~line 20) contains the correct path. \n. I don't mean your \"installation\" folder, sorry. Paste \"%appdata%/HearthstoneDeckTracker\" like that into your explorer bar.\n. Hm, ok. Close hs and the tracker an then do two things: \n1) copy the log.config file from \"Files\" in your tracker folder (where the exe is) into the appdata folder (where the config.xml is) and replace the existing one if there is one.\n2)  go into Hearthstone/Hearthstone_Data and delete the output_log.txt.\n. Ok, nice! :)\n. Already fixed for the next update (766b9e3).\nFor now if should work if you just move the dialog off of the tracker.\n. Thanks for the report.\n99% sure I found the issue. An update should be released within the next\nfew mintes :)\n2014-08-09 13:08 GMT+02:00 dhoepelman notifications@github.com:\n\nAfter upgrading to 0.4.0 (by extracting the archive to the installation\nfolder) application now crashes at startup (window gets shown) with an\nerror.\nCrash report contains:\n#### 9-8-2014 13:05:42\nSystem.InvalidOperationException: This Visual is not connected to a PresentationSource.\n   at System.Windows.Media.Visual.PointFromScreen(Point point)\n   at Hearthstone_Deck_Tracker.OverlayWindow.UpdateCardTooltip()\n   at Hearthstone_Deck_Tracker.OverlayWindow.UpdatePosition()\n   at Hearthstone_Deck_Tracker.MainWindow.d__22.MoveNext()\n--- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown ---\n   at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.AsyncMethodBuilderCore.b__0(Object state)\n   at System.Windows.Threading.ExceptionWrapper.InternalRealCall(Delegate callback, Object args, Int32 numArgs)\n   at MS.Internal.Threading.ExceptionFilterHelper.TryCatchWhen(Object source, Delegate method, Object args, Int32 numArgs, Delegate catchHandler)\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/160.\n. I'm gonna consider this fixed with release v0.4.2\n. fixed with release v0.4.2\n. fixed with release v0.4.2\n. That makes sense, yes.\n\nFor now, if the drawn cards do not match the selected deck it's simply not recorded.\nI'll probably add some way to assign a game to another deck while still in menu. Or maybe have some \"unassigned games\" category from where you can add them to other decks.\n. Added the behaviour mentioned above with release v0.4.2\n. You will have to enable the option with v0.4.3 (options > other)\n. That must have gotten screwed up while cleaning up / simpliflying code. Will be fixed with the next update.\n. fixed release v0.4.2\n. It takes a few seconds after the game is back in menu for the result and mode to be saved, but if it's not  happening in general the games log.config file was not updated yet. Restarting hearthstone and the tracker should fix that.\n. Very good :) you're wecome!\n. Do you have your opponent's cards \"more left\" and hidden by any chance? I just tried tried it a few times and it seems to work.\nAnother thing I can think of: the hearthstone window has to be focused before you open the friendslist for it to work (technical reasons).\n. Ooh, yea obviously.. I should've thought of that. It checks if the opponent deck is left of the middle and only if it's not it, the player deck is hidden. \nI'm gonna change it so that all decks on the left side get hidden.\n. Can't imagine it would have anything to do with the result. Have you tried restating both hearthstone and the tracker? \n. Pretty much does :).\nUpdate v0.4.0 and higher require a new log-type from hearthstone. Namely assets unloading. The way win/loss is determined is by seeing what sound gets unloaded after a game (the sounds that play on your victory/defeat screen). That's also when the new game gets actually saved. \nNow for hearthstone to log those messages, the game needs to be restarted once if it was and usually there should be a message telling you that. Maybe there was no message, maybe it didn't update the log.config file properly even without the game running. But if losses are tracked all should be good now :).\n. The update in not immediate. It takes a few seconds after leaving the game.\n. But if actually still doesn't work please do the follwing: \n1. Close the tracker\n2. Go into \"%appdata%/hearthstonedecktracker\" (copy paste into explorer bar like that)\n3. open config.xml file\n4. set  (~line 29) to true\n5. set  (~line 52) to 1\n6. start tracker, play a game, go back into menu after it's over\nThe tracker will now have generated a \"Logs\" folder in it's folder, please send me the file(s) it contains per email: epikz37@gmail.com\nAfter that you can probably set both values in the config back to false and 0, so that no more logs get generated.\n. Hey,\nit should usually just go to the selected deck. Only exception is if the selected deck does not match the drawn cards, then the game is not recorded at all.\nNot sure why that would happen. You could also turn on the logging as I described above and send me the latest file when you notice that happening.\n. Does the deck have the same name?\nOther than that... that could be an issue with the hearthstone log still containing old games. Did you set ClearLog in the config to false by any chance? If not, try restarting hearthstone and see if it still happens.\n. Either that, yes, or you can also directly delete the games in the stats screen. Even multiple at once. \nSo if the problem is not persistent, then all's good :).\n. No problem. If it keeps happening, please still turn on the logging and send me the logs so I can hopefully fix it.\n. [20:15:29]: Assigned current game to NO deck - selected deck does not match cards played\nCan you double check the deck you are using in game is the same you got in the tracker?\n. That would also explain why it works only sometimes. Whenever you draw the card(s) that's not in the deck the tracker has, the game gets discarded.\n. I just conceded a few games, got the coin 2 times, both were recorded. Do you have the same issue with all decks?\n. Alright, try this: http://www.mediafire.com/download/6szsh5rkk6qg3xw/v0.4.2-gamerecordingfix-exeonly.zip (replace your exe)\nI added the game discarding as an option (options > other), off by default. That should fix your problems.\n. What does the log say not when it's not recorded?\nIf you have the option disabled it should not be \"[20:15:29]: Assigned current game to NO deck - selected deck does not match cards played\"\n. Good :) you're welcome\nYeah no idea what might be causing this.\n. \"Fixed\" (or at least: workaround officially implemented) with v0.4.3\n. Not sure what could be happening here. But you mean a practice game, not the tutorial, right?\nDoes this happen if you do the same thing after restarting hearthstone and the tracker?\n. Strange. But if this didn't happen again I'm not gonna worry about it for now. Thanks for your report though!\n. I guess we can close it for now.\n. ~~I changed this some time after 0.4.0 from returning new Card() if the string was string.Empty, to null in both cases. I'm 99% sure that's why it's happening. Not sure why Ids in playerdraw are empty though. But 397b38f should take care of that.~~\n. ooh nope I'm wrong, I got it.. \n. Yup, not sure why I came to that conclusion.\nBuut I now released an update just for this, so all is hopefully good :).\n. I was so afraid it would end of not working and everyone had to download a new version with a fix for it manually :D.\n. There should be no problem adding that. \nThe biggest \"issue\" right now would be that the note would be outside of the default view, so you would have to scroll to the right.\n. How about this? http://imgur.com/a/sCWhZ\nI'm probably gonna shorten the data string a little bit still.\n. Alright, I think I'm on to something here. \nNo more scrolling for warlock/warrior, more space for notes.\n\nAs for your last point, while I agree it was  a bit cleaner before, I really like being able to see the winrates directly in there. I would make it an option but that might be a bit tricky. \n. Added with v0.4.3\n. Filtering notes.. just have a combobox with all the notes you used so far and if you e.g. choose \"zoolock\", then if filter all the games for which the note is exactly \"zoolock\" or contains \"zoolock\"? That's gonna be a very long list if you don't limit yourself to just a few notes.\nSadly, the logs don't contain any information about attacks (or I haven't found them yet but I doubt that), The only way of getting that information is via TCP or memory. Both of those violate the TOS. \n. That.. should have been the obvious solution.. yes.. \nQuestion now is: where do I put that :/\n. Added note filter with v0.4.8\n. Thanks.\nNot quite sure how to fix that right now. \nOut of curiosity: if you switch your keyboard layout (alt-shift) do you have the same issue?\n. It's not quite as simple sadly. You can read in #100 what the problem with this is (I'm assuming it's essentially the same problem).\n. Okay, let's try something. Use this exe and enable \"Paste names from clipboard\" in Options > Other > Exporting. Let me know if that works. \n. Intersting idea. The only card with a number I can think of is SI7. \nSo.. 1-5 maybe?\n. http://www.mediafire.com/download/j5e25or3l94bj2k/v0.4.2-addcard15-exeonly.zip\ndownload, replace you exe, let me know what you think :)\n. I just tried adding that, apparently up/down are not considered \"keys\" in the context of that textbox.. huh... I'll see if I can somehow make it work.\n. Found my mistake, arrow keys + enter works as well now!\n. Added both with v0.4.3\n. So basically 4:3 is bad right? Pretty sure the reason is somewhere in this.\nAs for cards getting exported that are not in the deck, that's most likely the same problem as #154. If you know which cards are affected, that's easy to fix.\n. The same export being different is probably on the weaker machine? If you increase the ClickDelay and SearchDelay in the config.xml (%appdata%/hearthstonedecktracker), do you get consistent results?\n. This hopefully fixes the resolution problems.\nI also added an option to set the exporting delay form within the gui.\nedit: Both added with v0.4.4\n. The message also says to attach the crash report(s) :). Not much I can do without those. \n. Most likely the same issue as #169. Should be fixed with the next update.\n. If it's the above, that should now be fixed with v0.4.4\n. Thanks! \nThat was an easy one to fix :). I think this change should not affect anything else.\n. Fixed with v0.4.3 :).\n. Oh, yea that's not really necessary :).\n. The main problem with that is until you draw a card two times in a single game, the second one can not be added to the deck, since there's no way to tell if it's the second card or the same one again. So unless you draw you complete deck on a regular basis, this feature wont really work too well.\nThe features from #172 added with v0.4.3 should make building decks quite a bit quicker.\nIn addition to that, something I posted a while back somewhere and again yesterday in #7:\n\nThe naxx update contained the follwing new strings:\nGLUE_COLLECTION_DECK_PASTE_POPUP_HEADER - Paste Deck\nGLUE_COLLECTION_DECK_PASTE_POPUP_MESSAGE - This will erase your existing deck and >replace it with the contents of the clipboard, are you sure?\n(source)\nIf that gets added, copy pasting decks from hearthstone into the tracker should be no problem :).\n\nWith those two things in mind, I don't think it's worth it to put a lot of effort into trying to make this work.\n. Oh, that's something I wanted to do a long time ago.. I competely forgot. \nPretty sure this should make it into the next update.\n. Added with v0.4.4\n. Uh, theoretically that would be possible but it's a bit weird in my opinion. The timing between hearthstone logging a draw and you seeing it in game depends on the animations currently running in the game. So if I delay everything by, say, 5 seconds you might see some draws exactly on time, some 3 seconds later. You kinda run into the same issue.\nBut you can turn off the orange highlighting in options > decks > player, if that's bothering you. \n. That should take care of it. Thanks for all your reports :)\n. Fixed with v0.4.4\n. I'm not sure if this is the bug that exists since v0.1.0 of which I still have no idea why it happens.\nOr if it's just the game re-logging all the draws/plays without having any indication of start or end of games. (I tend towards this one)\nIf it's the second one, there's nothing I can do about it, if it's the first one I don't know what I can do about it :). But the second is fixed after the game ends, the first is fixed after restarting the tracker.\nThanks for the report and screenshots though!\n. The 6432Node only exists on 64bit systems though. And you should usually be redirected to that on 64bit systems if you leave it out. \nCould you delete your config.xml (%appdata%/hearthstonedecktracker), start the tracker again using the \"normal\" path and make sure directory is actually not set properly? (~line 37 in the config)\nMaybe it was just the process of restarting the tracker that fixed it.\n. Well that's good news then :).\nCould've also been hearthstone needing a restart. Usually the tracker should tell you that though.\n. Well.. actually it should not be zero either (division by 0). It should probably say something like \"-%\".\n. Very close to working code actually :D. \nThe percentages are now replaced with dashes if the count is zero.\n. This: http://www.vistax64.com/general-discussion/197168-link-libary-message.html#post906939 sounds like it could help you out.\n. I just tried, I definitely don't have this issue on my win7 machine and I  have not heard of anyone else having this before either. So.. I would say the problem lies somewhere on your end. No idea what or why though, sorry I can't be of more help. \nMaybe someone else has an idea.\n. Not intended, nice catch :).\nShould be fixed now, thanks!\n. fixed with v0.4.5\n. Any change from restarting the tracker and hearthstone?\n. Check if  in the config.xml contains the correct directory.\n. That's.. an interesting solution. \nAnyway, fixed what was causing that crash. Thanks for that.\n. Perfect place. \nConsidered - obviously, yes. And it's possible but it's sadly not as simple as \"just adding image recognition\". There's a reason I didn't add that or anything in that direction yet (see #7 and #130). One of the he main issues being error-proneness, Especially with the particles flying around from selecting cards. Chances are good that, if you select cards too quickly, image recognition won't be able to identify the cards. \nAlso, image recognition might become obsolete with the addition of deck copy-pasting (see my last comment in #7). That's the reason I'm a bit hesitant at the moment to put too much effort into things like that.\n. Yeah. \n. Got this kind of working actually! See #456\n. Hey,\ndo you have .NET 4.5 installed?\ndoes it show up in the processes (taskmanager)?\n. Works on everything that can Install .NET 4.5. So everything above XP. -  Yes.\n. No problem, enjoy! :)\n. You could just delete the game I suppose. (stats > select game > delete in the bottom right) \nI think there's no way for the tracker to tell the difference between defeat and tie, as the result is determined by which sound was played (and therefore unloaded) at the end of your game.\n. Is that not possible already? It's just called 'draw'  instead of 'tie'. \n. (I'm just gonna answer here)\nBoth might be the same issue.\nSource and destination path must have identical roots. Move will not work across volumes.\nI assume you have the tracker on another harddrive? Try moving it to where your appdata is (most likely C).\nInteresting error though, I would've excepted that to work.\n. The first one \nThe requested operation cannot be performed on a file with a user-mapped section open.\nactually sounds like you could have multiple instances of the tracker running?\nI think that basically means you are blocking something the tracker wants to access.\n. Should be fixed with v0.4.5\n. That one's gonna be tough... \nIf you search for \"if stalagg died\"  you probably get both as well right? \n. The only solution I can come up with is to always click the left card when exporting feugen and always the right one when stalagg. That won't work if you have goldens.. which would be possible if you have both, but no way to do it if there's only one golden anyway.\n. added the above with v0.4.6\n. Not a bad idea.\nCould just add them in the exporting groupbox as normal checkboxes as well. \n. It's probably a good idea, yes. \nSeems to be pretty simple as well actually. \nControl:\nXAML\n<dialogs:BaseMetroDialog            \n    xmlns:dialogs=\"clr-namespace:MahApps.Metro.Controls.Dialogs;assembly=MahApps.Metro\"  [...]>\n    [...]\n</dialogs:BaseMetroDialog>\nDocumentation of BaseMetroDialog\nCalling it:\nC#\nawait this.ShowMetroDialogAsync(new MyDialog());\n. I don't actually check if there's a golden card there, I just check if there's any card in slot 2 (here's the code). It takes the average hue and saturation of a 50x50 area and compares that to what the background color is.\nIf there is a card in slot 2, slot 2 is clicked 2 times, followed by 1 click to slot 1 because I don't know how many golden cards there are. (code)\nSo if searching feugen/stalagg gives you three cards, there's no way of telling what the middle one is and therefore where to click first when exporting feugen. If both are golden it would work fine again (not currently but theoretically).\nI never gave it this much thought.. \n2 cards: easy (click 1 and 2)\n4: easy (click 2 and 4)\n3, stalagg: click 3, then 2 (but here's a problem if you don't want to priorize golden because you would have to click 2 first without knowing what that card is)\n3: feugen: only possibility would be to always click left which makes it not work with golden ones.\n. While that's probably somehow possible, it's going to be very hard to do because there's a delay between clicking the card and it being in the list on the right.\nAlso you run into problems when feugen is the last card on your list because you will add just stalagg and the list stays at 30.\nI think we'll go with dvides idea. More reliable, easier, and way less work :).\n. Well... yea okay that would work. But aside from it being probably around 10 times the amount of work, you're also looking as probably another 4-6 seconds added to the exporting to make the deck count checking reliable enough.\n. added with v0.4.8\n. Hey\nWhat's happening / not happening? \nTracker starting? \nOverlay visible? \n. Can you try manually copying the log.config from the Files folder to \"%appdata%/blizzard/hearthstone\" and restart both. \n. %localappdata%, sorry. \n. Restart tracker and hearthstone and see if anything changed \n. Try deleting/renaming your PlayerDecks.xml (last 3 lines in  the Screenshot). \n. Maybe fixed with v0.4.5?\n. Awesome :)\n. Might be fixed with v0.4.6\n. Never mind the exe above, I got it working. Including exporting. Just improving performance a bit now.\n. ~~Here we go, try this one and let me know if it works.~~\nDoes it work with v0.4.5?\nFor exporting you may have to enable options > other > exporting > paste names.\n. Very good :)\nThere's problems with stalagg/feugen at the moment anyway, but aside from that, try lowering the exporting speed (options > other), maybe that'll help.\nThe next update will contain drastic imprivements in terms of exporting speed and reliability btw! At the moment, the searchbox is cleared explicitly after every card, not sure why but that's what's causing a lot of the problems. \nWith my changes now I can export a full deck in just under 6 seconds now :).\n. see #191 \n. Not sure.\nI've been avoiding direct interactions with hearthstone during games so far and I think I want to keep it that way. Same reason I did not add auto-squelching yet.\n. I would like both of these features as well actually. But yea, as I said.\nBtw, my money is still on blizzard not actually doing anything against botting on a grand scale. \nReason 1) there's no money coming in form doing so. Wow and D3 botters will (most likely) buy new accounts when they get banned. Hearthstone is free. \n2) From what I know, the percentage of people (at least in Wow) getting banned from being \"detected\" is rather small. Most of the bans are due to player reports. There's no such feature in hearthstone. But even if there was, distinguishing a bot from a player is way harder than in e.g. wow, only indicator being the arrow. And I imagine, if reporting gets added, bots will just simulate the arrow and be golden.\n. I was so excited for a second that this might also fix the feugen/stalagg issue.. but thay are obviously done by the same artist.. \nblizzard's fixed now anyway, thanks!\n. should be fixed with v0.4.6\n. Should be fixed with v0.4.6\n. What exactly do you mean? \n. Ah, yes I'm pretty sure it should. \n. Fixed that earlier today with a5bf770 :)\n. that's because I didn't release that in an update yet.\n. Do you have .net 4.5 installed? If yes, do lower versions work? \n. No problem, that's good to know :)\n. Seems to be working for me. \nFew things that have to happen for it to work:\n1) Options > General > Extra features enabled\n2) Hearthstone has to be focused (so \"coming from outside the game\", e.g. browser and directly clicking the friendslist does not work.\n3) Nothing may cover up the \"Add\" button on the friendslist (e.g. the deck itself)\n. good :)\n. Added functionality with v0.4.8. \n. Fixed with v0.4.7\n. Added with v0.4.7\n. I'm not 100% sure right now but I think there might be some issues with that, I'll have to think about it.\nHowever that are a few possibilites already (while search box is focused):\n- Enter adds the first card to the deck\n- Up/down (arrow keys) followed by enter adds the selected card\n- Keys 1-5 add the 1st-5th card\n. Should be fixed with v0.4.7\n. I noticed that too, worked fine four hours ago.\nNot sure why it's not working, but seems like there was some changes on their side, yea. \n@waibcam, any ideas? getdata.php?deck=... just returns an empty string.\n. Fixed with v0.4.8\n. What if you want to add more than 1 of the same card? Pressing an extra key to not delete just gets confusing.\nThings you can do however:\n- Ctrl-A, type next name\n- Ctrl-Backspace (deletes full words)\n.

I don't think that would actually be simpler than just hitting Ctrl-Backspace. If you're not used to using that, it'll probably take less time to pick it up than learing to press e.g. Insert will. Plus it's even useful outside of the tracker. (Ctrl-Shift-ArrowKeys is pretty cool too)\nBut if you really want to only press one key, you could set up for example autohotkey to do that.\n.

No problem :).\nThere's not really a up-to-date tutorial as far as I know. Automatic deck detection refers to automatically selecting the deck you are currently playing, given the tracker has it. If you have more questions feel free to just ask here or email me directly (epikz37@gmail.com).\nCreating arena decks is a bit of work sadly. Usually I would recommend the arenavalue.com client and then importing from there, but that's not working at the moment. \nTo speed up the deck building a bit: (after typing partial name) you can select cards with up/down arrows and add then using enter, or add the 1st-5th card using the 1-5 keys. \n. Looking at the code for that.. should work I think. Do the cards possibly just not update right away but on the next draw/play?\n. I'm not sure I'm a big fan of this. But very low priority either way though (for me). \n. Check out #412\n. Fixed with v0.4.8\n. We'll have to see if this has any big impact on the number of search results but seems fine in general.\n. Added with v0.4.8\n. 2nd part added with v0.4.8\n. It shows cards that were discarded from the deck in a different color. e.g. burned cards. Would it make sense to include discards from hand as well?\n. Well, it does say \"from deck\" at the moment, so it makes sense in that way. \nI'll check if there was a reason for it being only deck.\n. Oh I remember why: From the hearthstone log, there is no way to differentiate between spells played normally and  discarded from the hand. \nBoth are just \"OPPOSING HAND -> \" (to nothing).\nSo yea, it'll have to stay \"from deck\"-only\n. Fixed with v0.4.8\n. You can move things on the overlay by pressing the \"Unlock\" button in Options > General > Overlay.\nI'll check out the issue with the window.\nEdit: I can't seem to reproduce anything like that. Can you describe step-by-step what causes that to happen for you?\n. Okay, hopefully that's just a timing issue. Try this exe.\n. Excellent :). Then this should be fixed with v0.4.9\n. I should be able to make that work, yes. Probably in combination with #227.\n. I'm working on that (still a big mess)\n\n. Progress :)\nAt least the UI is done for the most part. Code is still far from it.\n\n. Thanks :) I'm pretty happy with it so far, too. The right panel is only visibile while creating/editing decks btw.\n. Yup. And since my fix for arenavalue seems to be working as well now, I'm gonna release an update including those in a few minutes.\n. I like the one-click update idea. \nThe url is already stored btw. If you re-import from the same url and save you should get a notification asking if you want to overwrite the deck (I think). The url is also automatically saved to the notes of the deck.\nYour last point is somewhere on my todo list :).\n. will be added with the next update (#455)\n. I'm redoing the GUI at the moment, so I would suggest waiting with additions to that. But in general this is definitely a good idea,\nI'm not sure where/how to display the information though. If you have ideas I'd be happy to implement it GUI wise when I'm done.\n. The combobox says 20 but it should actually still be at 40. Fixed now, thanks.\n. The splash screen of more of a nice-to-have I suppose, yea. \nI quite like what you drew actually! The lines are a bit hard to see at a lower resolution though. \n\n. Okay no problem!\nOne note though: the theme is not exclusively blue, you can choose between 20 or so accent colors.\n. I wouldn't mind having an indicator in the tooltip somewhere, but this is way to busy in my opinion.\nColored names is actually one of the things I really dislike about most of the other card-trackers out there.\n. There isn't really a good way of doing that. Also I not a fan of coloring the names in general. Especially the blue makes the names it a bit harder to read.\nLegendary cards are identifiable anyway, does it actually matter what rarity (the other) cards are?\n. I don't quite understand what you mean. Missing a word? \n. I don't quite understand what you mean. Missing a word? \n. Ah, I see. I don't really want to start interacting with hearthstone during games. It gets somewhat \"bot-ish\". if I do this, why not automatically playing a card if certain conditions are met, too?

I think for help that would fine, the heart is not really saying a lot on it's own though. And with 2/3 I might as well just be consistent and have icons and text for all. The title bar should be fine. \nHow does the rest of the app feel?\nAnything that feels wrong, is counter-intuitive? Not working (as excepted)?\n. How about putting all of those \"into\" the existing manacurve and be able to select which to display? That would clutter the UI a lot less. Either using some kind of combobox or maybe a flipview.\nAlso your deck names are off-center like that because you edited the image, right?\n. Sure, feel free!\n. Good work :). I updated to the new white one.\nThe colored one looks a bit weird in the system tray. Not really sure why it doesn't use the 16px version there.  (Same problem with the white one but it's less noticable) \n. Doesn't seem to make a difference but forcing the tray one to 16 looks good, thanks :).\n. You mean add basically the same \"play-history\" the game already has? The problem with that is that I don't have access to attack/spell targets and so on, so it would be very incomplete (and obviously redundant). \nYou could try stacking both your and your opponent's deck on the right side of the screen. Maybe turn the scaling down a bit for that.\n. Currently, that's intended (the timer is also not resizable).\nThe secrets size currently depends on the opponent-scaling (options > decks).\nBut being able to resize them just by dragging the handle is probably a good idea.

Btw, you don't need to create a new deck before importing, a new one is created automatically. \n. added with v0.5.2\n. Go to options > other and enable \"Paste names from clipboard\" in the exporting section.\n. Nah, there's so many options, no way you could know everything :).\nYou're welcome! Glad you enjoy it!\n. This (or at least this direction) is something I would really like to add but honestly I'm not sure how accepted this would be by a lot of users. It does certainly tip the scales towards an \"unfair advantage\" quite a bit. \nAlso I think just using sheer numbers and not taking deck types / meta (changes, existing less in lower ranks, ...) into account will not yield any good results (in the long run). \n. http://www.elie.net/blog/hearthstone/i-am-a-legend-hacking-hearthstone-with-machine-learning-defcon-talk-wrap-up\n\nWhy we are not releasing our tool?\nOne thing you won\u2019t see posted, however, is a software tool that we promised to release during our Defcon presentation. Following Defcon  we had a series of conversations with the Hearthstone team about our research \u2014 apparently the email that I sent prior to Defcon didn\u2019t reach the right person. They like our research on game/cards balance and are very enthusiastic and supportive about it.\nOn the other hand, they were very concerned that our real time dashboard that can predict your opponent\u2019s deck will break the game balance by giving that person (that is, whoever has the tool) an unfair advantage. They also expressed concern that such a tool makes the game less fun by taking away some of the decision-making from the player. It was a difficult decision \u2014 I invested a lot of our time building our real-time dashboard tool with Celine \u2014 but we agree with the Hearthstone team and will not release the tool publicly.\n\nSo this might be taking it a step too far and blizzard could end up at least taking a stance on this.\n. I still think it's get a lot less useful after turn 1 without taking deck types / meta into account. \nAnd the problem is, if we get it to a point where it does that it get's too good. So far one of the main points when reasoning why this tool is \"okay\" is that you can theoretically do it all on paper. \nThis.. not so much anymore. \nCombining this with deck prediction (based on popular deck lists) would be probably extremely cool, but for another project :(.\n. Form what I can see, there are no ids available in the html (as excepted). Importing from non-english names is kind of a problem since it only works of the tracker is actually set to that language.\n. Their db ids are not really much help. What I would need are the \"real\" card ids (those look something like \"EX1_007\" or \"NAX_051\"). If I have access to those, adding importing for the website should be no problem.\n. I would assume their db already contains those IDs, there are just no attributes in the html because they're not really needed for anything. Just in case: this is the db I use http://hearthstonejson.com.\n. added with v0.5.2\n. It should say the number in the title bar. \n. I like the idea in general but this definitely needs to be optional. \n. The \"default\" sorting is the same sorting hearthstone uses, and since this change would not only affect the database but all displayed decks, I would like to keep it that way. \nSo the solution would maybe be to add it as additional option in options>decks>sorting? \n[]Class cards first (which puts the all class cards on the top)\n    [] Within cost (no idea what to call this)\n. That a very much know issue, around since v0.1. If anyone has idea to why this might happen.. let me know.\n. I got an email with the same problem yesterday. It's not really something I intentionally broke, mainly because it's not a way of using decks I thought about (or intended actually). But I guess it makes I guess. \nWhat I'll hopefully get done this week is \"default decks\", which will have two main purposes:\n1) record stats if no deck is selected\n2) if desired, keep stats of deleted decks. \nSo with that you'll be able to just overwrite your arena decks and the stats will continue to exist. That stats screen will also see some improvement.\nSo for now I would suggest to either keep using v0.4.9 or create 9 arena decks.\n. is \"cards\" checked in Options > Decks > Player ?\n. Does the deck count / draw chance change on your side?\n. If you press \"unlock\" (options > general > overlay), does the blue square go out of the screen?\nIf yes, drag down. \nIf no... If you enable options > additional windows > player, do you see the cards in that window?\n. Okay, good :)\n. How about if I just split up the \"Save in appdata\" option into \"Save config in appdata\" and \"Save decks in appdata\" (also includes games). \nThat way you can either have the config in appdata and the folder itself in some cloud (e.g. dropbox) or have the decks in synced appdata and the config in the tracker folder.\n. I finally got around to doing this today. \nPlease create a backup of your AppData (\"%appdata%/HearthstoneDeckTracker\") and HDT folder before trying the version below. While I don't expect there to be problems, you never know.\nAdd the following two lines to your config: (this will happen automatically once the actual update is released)\nXML\n<SaveConfigInAppData>true</SaveConfigInAppData>\n<SaveDataInAppData>true</SaveDataInAppData>\nBoth true or false, depending on the your current    setting\nDownload here after creating backups\nLet me know if it works (the way you would expect).\n. If you're just reading the emails of this, I edited the previous post with some important information. Please check out the actual post on git.\n. added with v0.5.2\n. Already fixed with aaab034\n. No, sorry. There's no message indicating this in the logs. I could only detect hearthstone closing, at which point you will have noticed the DC yourself though.\n. Go to options > other and enable \"Paste names from clipboard\" in the exporting section.\n. Not sure why that's the case. Honestly.. I'm actually not sure it ever worked.\n. removed with v0.5.2\n. That's because the overlay is actually it's own window. You have to a screen region rather than just a window.\n. Did it work before? Did you change anything? Move hearthstone installation maybe?\n. If you download and start (cancel update) v0.4.x right now, does it work?\n. How about I actually just try to figure out the hero based on the cards played and display those decks?\n. Changes added with v0.5.2\n. An option to discard zero turn games was added, so that's kind of this.\n. Hm.. I can't seem to reproduce this. \nWhat's the exact order of things?\nHearthstone window or maximized?\nMinimize to tray activated as well in the tracker?\n. If you enable the \"Extra features\" in Options > General > Overlay, you can grey out secrets by clicking on them.\nThere are too many things I am not able to detect from the logs to make this automatic (attacking being one of those).\n. Basically start and end date?\n. You have to create decks manually.\n. Correct. That's not really possible without clearly violating TOS.\n. The rest should enable once you select a deck. Doesn't it?\n. Huh. That must've been some merge issue. Thanks.\n. fixed with v0.5.2\n. I didn't test this but it should work. \nObviously, only with new games.\n. added with v0.5.2\n. Very cool idea, thanks!\n. That's one of the things I plan on adding, long with more improvements to stats in general. \nI'm a bit limited on time at the moment though. I should be able to get some work done on stats this weekend / next week. \n. not yet :( I don't have much time at the moment.\n. That's planned. \n. Yes. I'm mainly having layout issues with this. I think the implementation is done for the most part. (I also just moved in to a new apartment, that's why there's now much happening at the moment) \n. Still a bad combination of not knowing what I want it to look like and too little time :/.\nI was actually staring at it this weekend a bit though, I do still want to implement this. \n. I made major progress on this today. Few things left to fix, should be able to get at least a test version out by tomorrow. \n. Check out #412\n. Does that happen with all heroes? \n. I didn't have time to look into it yet, sorry.\n. Ok, try something: Create a new deck where the class cards don't show up and save it. Is that deck saved to the correct class or to \"undefined\"?\n. And both of them actually save under the correct class in the left panel?\n. I made a few changes, try this exe: http://www.mediafire.com/download/38rcd7ozscjn91r/v0.5.2-deckcreationfixmaybe-exeonly.zip\n. Very good :). \n. officially fixed with v0.5.3 now.\n. There should be no issues regarding fullscreen/windowed. \nIt takes a few seconds after the game is over (back in the menu) for games to register, switching decks (in the tracker) too fast after a game might cause problems. That's the only possibility I can think of at the moment.\n. Just \"doing something\" is not that easy sadly :). \nAny chance of the discard option in options > other > recoding  being enabled? \nIs there anything specific happening when it does not record the game? \nTime spent in menu after the game? \nSwitching decks during the game? \nSound turned off? (game result is detected by checking which sounds gets unloaded after the game) \n. Also: go to \"%appdata%/hearthstonedecktracker\" (press Win+R to open the \"Run\" dialog and paste it here), open the config.xml file and set  to true. \nAfter you notice a game not being logged please email me the latest log file generated from the \"[HearthstoneDeckTracker]/Logs\" folder (epikz37@gmail.com).\n. (I'm just gonna reply to the email here)\n@Jeanfilou thanks for the log, judging from that, the problem should be the very first thing I mentioned: \n[21:02:31]: Assigned current game to NO deck - selected deck does not match cards played\nWhich hopefully means two things: \n1) the deck you're playing does not match the deck in the tracker (can be just one card) \n2) \"Discard game if incorrect deck\" is checked in \"Options > Other > Record games\". \nChanging either of those (obviously both at best :)) should solve the problem.\n. I have no idea of that's actually the issue, it was just a guess. probably wouldn't explain inconsistencies, rather no recording at all.\nBut let me know if chaning that does fix it.\n. I think what should work is turning the sound on in-game, then turning the hearthstone sound off in the windows volume mixer. For that click the little speaker icon in your taskbar and then \"Mixer\" at the bottom.\n. Did you update from an older version?\nTry manually creating a file called \"DeckStats.xml\" in \"%appdata%/HearthstoneDeckTracker\", paste\n<DeckStatsList></DeckStatsList>\ninto it, save and try again.\n. Thanks, I got the crash fixed. \nBut the reason why it's not working in the first place is that you can't import from hearthpwns deckbuilder, you have to import from actual decks (random example: http://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/99154-dogs-1-legend-taunt-druid-deck)\n.

I have a really good idea for the quality, similar to your borders. I'll post that in a bit.\nFull image tooltips:\n- Adding 1000+ cards in 16 languages would make the .zip HUGE.\n- Alternative: Download on demand\n  - From where? I'd probably have to host them myself\n  - Where do I get all of them in all of the languages? Will I get them reliably when new updates come out?\n  - What's would traffic cost?\n. \"worry about other languages later\" is not really a good way to look at this I think.\nAnd even with only english in the download, that's still increases the size 5-10 fold. The way to do this would be dynamically downloading them. \nAlso they should not be attached to the current tooltip but replace it if desired. (on by default)\nThis could work: \n\n. i don't understand the hearthstonejson link\n. There are no card images on hearthstonjson. All of the text I do already have (obviously).\n. using the colors codes from above:\n\nThe colors are multiplied with the original border at 150 alpha, that's why they won't quite be the same, but just slapping the color on looks dumb. This is suble and get's the point across very nicely imo.\n. Pretty much what @mkleiman312 said.\nThe json files are generated from Hearthstones game files, so adding the released cards would have to be done compeltely manually.\nAs for the original question: I plan on releasing an update with the new db files asap. Depening on the exact date of the release, the card images might have to follow a few days later.\n. This happens because before any cards are drawn, as soon as your current class is detected, HDT switches to the last deck played with that class. Most of the time this will be the correct pick. \nI don't really want to add automatic switching between \"deck\" and \"no deck\" mode if I can avoid it. I'm not really sure how pressing this issue is anymore either since importing arena decks from the game is a very quick thing to do now. Also if you want to switch modes, you are probably not switching between the two at a frequency where it's too much to ask to manually activate either.\nWhat I did add now though is a warning when no matching deck could be found.\n\n. If restarting (hdt and hearthstone) does not help, it could be related to multiple installations of hearthstone. Check if the path is set correctly in the config.xml (press win+r to open the run dialog, then paste \"%appdata%/hearthstonedecktracker\"),  around line 33. \n. Added with v0.5.7\n.

Hm. \nSince there's no chance to lose anything: try just deleting everything in that folder.\n. May or may not work. Yea, try it.\n. Very good :). Enjoy!\n. I'm not sure how to fix it, since everything should actually account for DPI. \nHowever, I just remembered that there are config values from waaay back that might help you:\n- , : width and height of the window, set to  1/1.1 (~91%) of hearthstone resolution\n-  , : offset of the overlay (not sure if you need this)\n-  : to make it easier on yourself. Will tint the overlay blue.\nThe config is located at %AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker (also availible over the options: options > other > tracker > open appdata folder). Close the tracker before editing the config. Getting the values right may need some fiddling around but should give the desired result eventually.\n. Could not find file 'E:\\Grammes\\Hearthstone Deck Tracker\\Images\\HearthstoneDeckTracker.ico'.\ncan you make sure that file exists? If it doesn't try re-extracting the whole thing.\nOtherwise it could be some weird permission issue: try creating all the folders (tracker, tracker/Files, tracker/Images) manually and drop the according files in.\n. #471\n. The files are located at \"%appdata%/hearthstonedecktracker\" (press win+r to open run dialog and paste).\nYou can either copy them from there or disable \"save config in appdata\" and \"save data in appdata\" in options > other > tracker to have the files saved in the main folder and then copy that. \n. Not sure what exactly happend here.\nDo you still have the PlayerDecks.xml and config.xml files in the tracker folders?\nMaybe the config got reset for some reason and now looks for the deck files in appdata again. \nI don't think your decks could have gotten deleted. \nIf \"save in appdata\" is checked, uncheck that again (if you already did that again, try this as well). The data files from appdata will now be copied to the hdt folder and the \"old\" files will be renamed to something PlayerDecks.xml[somenumers]. Delete(rename) the PlayerDecks.xml file, remove the numbers at the end of the old one.

Yea, I think the logging for secrets changed (different problem).\n. Nah, it's ok. Trying to figure it out as we speak.\nBlizzard really did some weird things to the logs with this patch.\n. I don't even..\n```\n[Zone] ZoneChangeList.ProcessChanges() - id=3 local=False [name=Freezing Trap id=33 zone=DECK zonePos=0 cardId=EX1_611 player=1] zone from FRIENDLY DECK -> \n[Zone] ZoneChangeList.ProcessChanges() - TRANSITIONING card [name=Freezing Trap id=33 zone=HAND zonePos=0 cardId=EX1_611 player=1] to FRIENDLY HAND\n[Zone] ZoneChangeList.ProcessChanges() - id=3 local=False [name=Freezing Trap id=33 zone=HAND zonePos=0 cardId=EX1_611 player=1] zone from FRIENDLY DECK -> FRIENDLY HAND\n```\nThis is logged for one draw, which I could deal with if it was consistent. It is not though... Some draws are logged like that, others aren't. Why blizzard? :(\n. Did you uninstall the old one? If it can't find the hearthstone.exe is should usually prompt you to give it a new location on start.\n. added with v0.5.10\n. Can't access the screenshot :/.\n(You can just drag images in the textbox here and it will upload them)\n. Did you save and select the deck? :)  (button in the top right)\n. Click the back button, then choose the deck you want.\nI think I got the manacurve issue fixed now as well.\n. Okay that's weird.. Try restarting the tracker, reimporting the deck and maybe giving it a different name.\n. Oooh I think I got it... Go to decks > sort / filter an check \"all\".\n. Maybe the deck wasn't tagged as arena, otherwise it should've shown it, yea.\n. added that now :)\n. I think the settings from the stats apply to this actually. (maybe that's changed, not sure from the top of my head)\n. Does that happen without the tracker running?\n. I assume this also only happen when hearthstone is running in fullscreen?\nWhat windows are you running?\nAny effect maybe from lowering the compativility mode?\n. That's \"good\" to hear. :)\n. Changing the compativility mode might still help you out though. Probably worth a try.\n. You're right, it should. \nNow it does.\n. I apparently messed that up with 6564a9b :).\nShould work again now.\n. fixed, thanks\n. I'm not sure how I feel about adding this. You only see the opponents card backs so adding things on top there is fine, but for the player hand it will at least be ugly, if not cover up information.\n. copy of my reply from #398:\n\nOkay, \n1) close the tracker\n2) go to \"%appdata%/hearthstonedecktracker\" (open run dialog via WIN+R, paste), \n3) open the config.xml file and set 0.915 (around line 33) to maybe.. 0.905 (that's percent height of the screen, if that number doesn't work you should be able to find the correct one rather quickly).\n. > You should add a class filter for the overall games.\n\nI had a lot of filters at some point actually (that being one of them) but I threw them out for now to just get it working. I will probably start adding them back.\n\nIf, for example, I'm playing an Arena game without a selected deck I can't look at one of my decks list and/or stats because, if I click it, it will change the deck that's loaded on the overlay and used for the current game.\n\nThat's just how it works though, not sure what I could reasonably do about that.\n\nSince we have seasons in Hearthstone, you should change filters from \"Last Week/Month/Year\" to \"This Week/Month/Year\".\n...\nThe names you gave to those filters tell me you didn't manage it this way but, if you did, you should just change the names.\n\nCurrently it's just the last 7, 30 and 365 days of games, but it would make more sense this way, I agree. I'll try to make that work.\n\nWhen I don't use a deck, I don't think there is the need to show my win rate on top of my deck.\n\nMakes sense, changed that.\n\nIn the stats window I'd write \"Deck\" rather than \"Current Deck\" so that it doesn't seems like if there are both \"Current\" and \"Deck\" tabs.\n\nChanged that as well, looks a bit odd right now but maybe that's just me.\n\nAlso, I think there is enough space to put the games below the second table in the \"Overall\" tab.\nI'd put it there and remove \"Stats\" and \"Game\" tabs.\n\nThat's the way I had it at first but after probably an hour of fiddling around with it I gave up. It works perfectly fine as long as the window has a certein height, below that, if the details box is expaneded the games-box just is outside the window. Putting it in a scrollviewer doesn't work either without setting a fixed height for the table (it'll just extend to its max height because the scrollviewer allows it to do so) which then again causes problems if the window exceeds a certain height... yeah..\n\nIn the big table, when a field is empty, I'd write \"-\" rather than \"-%\".\n\nThat does look better, changed. \n\nEventually, I'd put the games filter after the note one.\n\nDoes also look better I guess, not really sure :). Changed for now either way.\n. Between showing \"0-0\" and showing nothing, nothing is definitely the better option for now :).\n. You mean the \"VS Priest:..:\" ? That's also based on the current deck iirc so the same applies.\nI'll probably add an option to show the winrates based on the current class when no deck is selected, though.\n. Changed 2) and 3) with d9bade7. Good points.\nI'm not sure I quite understand your first suggestion though. Do you mean rightclicking a deck should have the same effect as decks > use no deck?\n. That feels a lot better than I expected, done!\n. Released this with v0.6.0.\nI'm gonna close this, open a new issue if you have more suggestions :).\n. More removed than lost, but yes. I think being able to select \"no deck\" via the TRACKER menu and the try icon context menu is fine.\n. By default the search only considers the card names. Can be changed by turning on \"fulll text search in new deck\" in options > general > other. With that, cardtext, race/type and rarity will be included.\nShould I add race/type to the default search?\n. That should work perfectly fine, looks good. \nI think I'll add a few more such that we have:\n- Today\n- Last 24th (instead of from yesterday maybe?)\n- This week\n- Previous week\n- This month\n- Previous month\n- This year\n- All time \n. Oookay, that was quite a bit more annoying than I expected it to be :).\nWe now have:\n- Today\n- Yesterday\n- Last 24 Hours\n- This Week\n- Previous Week\n- Last 7 Days\n- This Month\n- Previous Month\n- This Year\n- Previous Year\n- All Time\nIn hindsight.. start and end datepicker would have been a lot easier. But I always hate fiddling around with datepickers, so that's that.\n. added with v0.6.3\n. Turns out, the log actually does contain playernames :).\n[Power] GameState.DebugPrintPower() - TAG_CHANGE Entity=Epix tag=PLAYER_ID value=1\n[Power] GameState.DebugPrintPower() - TAG_CHANGE Entity=[OPPONENTNAME] tag=PLAYER_ID value=2\n. Note quite sure if that's exactly what you're suggesting but I added an option to hide the overlay while in spectator with 7f2b119.\n. I'm still not 100% sure what you're asking :). Can this be closed?\n. No changes from restarting hearthstone/tracker I guess?\nAny effect from lowering the exporting speed in options > other ?\n. So all's good? Perfect :)\n. You're right, thanks. Done.\n. added with 0.6.3\n. added with v0.6.3\n. You are right. \nSwitching out the marks might be confusing (as you might know, even buying the correct packs isn't easy!). \nHow about just keeping the mulliganed mark and adding the kept mark? \n. Also, I think you can't redraw your mulliganed cards? If that's the case there's still some value to knowing which ones are mulliganed since they have a higher probability of being good. \n. added with v0.6.3\n. Oh wow, you are amazing! \nI will check this out as soon as I get home tonight! \n. Is there a way to have it create only a single \"Hearthstone Deck Tracker.resources.dll\" or at least have all the languages directories in a subdirectory?\n. That's what I just found, too :).\nIs there any way to autogenerate resx entries? Along the lines of  highlight Header=\"_UPDATE (WEB)\", rightclick -> generate resx entry.\n. Too bad.\nLong.cs was there, the .csproj was just missing the reference. I probably missed that in the merge.\n. Any idea what these are about? \n\nError  11  The component 'Hearthstone_Deck_Tracker.DeckListView' does not have a resource identified by the URI '/Hearthstone Deck Tracker;component/controls/decklistview.xaml'.\n\nI'm getting 10 errors like that (still compiles fine though).\n. You can just clone master acutally.\n. Compiling and running it is no problem for me either. It's all designer issues apparently. I just redownloaded the master branch as well and still the same. \nCould very well be my visual studio being weird. I'll try on another computer later.\n. Clearing cache doesn't seem to do anything. I just noticed I only get the errors once I open the MainWindow.xaml. Maybe the same for you?\n. I can't figure out how to make this work. I spent several hours today without making any real progress, but the problem seems to be with WPF Localization Extension. \nI barely use the designer with it (loads forever, design time errors, crashes, ...), so I moved all the localization to ui-translation for now and forced master back to 346f8bb. (My notebook has the same issues)\nIs there maybe a way we can still use resx? Replacing all the lex:loc... should be very easy if we keep the naming the same. If no, we might have to go with DynamicResource solution :(.\n. The behaviour is a bit weird. After \"opening\" a deck for the first time, clicking the title selects the text. Clicking somehwere else, then the title again will not select the text. So a simple ctrl-a should do, yea.\n. Actually that won't work. See #83 (tl;dr: keyboard settings and languages)\n. Ha, I like that. Doubleclicking wasn't the issue but actually close to the solution :D.\n. fixed with v0.6.3\n. Added an option for that!\n\n. added with v0.6.3\nlet me know if this works for you.\n. Hey,\ntry unchecking the \"Advanced window search\" option in options > other > tracker.\n. Please upload the full crash report (www.pastebin.com)\n. The one from the first ~~try~~ crash might be much more helpful\n. Also: In which tab did you delete the deck? deck or overall?\n. There definitely seems to be an issue deleting games in that tab, I can't delete any that have a deck assigned. I'll check it out.\n. I think I got it sorted out (1c0c4be9).\nLatest build: http://www.mediafire.com/download/3m231b83xrjud2c/Hearthstone_Deck_Tracker-v0.6.3_gamedeletefix.zip\n. I don't quite understand what the problem is but data is stored in \"%appdata%/hearthstonedecktracker\" (bring up the run dialog via WIN+R, paste there).\nThe first thing you should try is deleting the config.xml contained in that folder and see if it works again. Deleting the decks will most likely not have any effect anyway.\n. Good to hear you figured it out :). Enjoy!\n. Do you have such a log available? could you upload it?\nThere is no way to tell the difference between a card being played and put from your hand into the battlefiled (e.g. voidcaller). The second would not trigger the battlecry. I don't know if such a mechanic exists for non-demons right now. \n. Sorry I should've been clearer. I meant the log generated by hearthstone (output_log.txt).\n(The tracker clears the hearthstone log after every game, so you would have to either make a copy of it / upload it before you left the victor/defeat screen or set  in the config.xml to false)\n. Many other card also draw more cards. Still more accurate than inaccurate deck count :).\n. I think not. Needs confirmation.\n. Any difference from fullscreen to windowed?\nAfter a failed exporting attempt, could you go to options > other > tracker and enable \"show log-tab\", then in that tab click \"save to file\" and upload that to www.pastebin.com. \n. Should work with all resolutions. \n[03:13:15] DeckExporter: Exporting aborted, window lost focus is what confuses me. What happens if you turn off the overlay in options > general > overlay > hide (completely)? \nThere have also been problems with monitor setups before. If you have multiple ones, try having hearthstoneon another one.\n. Is that when the opponent is using it or the player? \nCould you upload the trackers log after a game where that happened?  (www.pastebin.com) \nLog can by generated via: options > other > tracker > show log tab, switch to the log tab and press \"save to file\" \n. Very interested. \nI can see why this would happen,  I will make sure this gets \"fixed\", later today. Thanks for letting me know. \nNote that this is actually logged by the game so this is somewhat an issue on Blizzards end. I will contact them about this. \n. What stats exactly would you want to export? In what form?\n. Weird. After that happens, could you enable \"show log tab\" in options > other > tracker, switch to the log tab, save to file an upload that to www.pastebin.com?\n. Try something: \nClick the \"open appdata folder\" button in options > other > tracker, then open the config.xml there and set  to false. Restart the tracker and see if this still happens.\n. Close the tracker before editing the config, actually.\n. The overlay option is at options -  general -  overlay and the one to enable / disable recording is at options -  other -  recording\n. Not sure what happend there either. Did you minimize the game at the time of the crash?\nWhatever the problem is, it should no longer cause crashes from now on. Thanks for reporting this.\n.

With a deck selected, in the menu: edit > delete\n. ?\n. Is there possibly a folder/file called \"temp\" in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Hearthstone Deck Tracker? If so, deleting that could fix the problem.\nIf not, the alternative could be that for some reason the folder can't be created, so creating it manually could be the solution as well.\n. Judging from the output in the console, the problem is somehwhere between here, which.. yea.\nI modified the updater to spit out the exception: http://www.mediafire.com/download/eihua8ufqx0idxg/updater.zip \nReplace yours and let me know what it says.\n. Completely forgot I wanted to do this, thanks for the reminder. Done!\n. I fixed the tag issue earlier today. The problem is that currently new decks gain the tags of the last one selected. \n. Sadly, with the changes blizzard made to hearthstones fullscreen mode this is not possible anymore (I think).\nTry this out: http://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/2oqn8t/useful_trick_to_get_borderless_fullscreen_again/\n. I like that better idea you got! Done.\n. Fixed, thanks! Will be display as \"triggered\" in the game history but that should be fine I think.\n. If you enable the \"extra features\" in options > general > tracker, you can click the secrets to manually grey them out. Other than that there's nothing of the sort.\n. So...\n- All the decks are there?\n- All of the decks display \"-%\" (except for new ones)\n- If you go into the stats of the deck, they are there?\n. Good :). \n. I think I got this fixed now, thank you for reporting.\nDoes it work after pressing the reset button next to unlock?\n. So much work :( \nmaking progress though.. \n(cleaning this up ;))\n. You can just drop it in autostart, but I will make sure to add this. \n. I like both ideas. It should be possible to distinguish between secrets drawn from the deck and those obtained from though steal, etc.. Those cards are already marked as \"stolen\", ~~transferring that properly to the secrets is trivial.~~ (don't need to transfer anything anywhere for this)\nAs for wanting the satisfaction of \"ticking off\"  secrets : making auto grayout an option would solve this. \n. Tried a few things today, not really any idea how to fix this. (relevant code)\n. Did this occour again after v0.7.3?\n. The problem with that is that you need to distinguish \"start of turn draws\" and draws from card effects. I have not yet been able to test how reliable the threshold at 30 is, but maybe combining it with the CURRENT_PLAYER tag might work. \n. The button has a tendency to not flip if you press it too fast on the first turn :). Plus it has good chances of being hidden by things.  I think power messages are still the way to go. \n. To explain a little further actually, this distinguishing is exactly what the power message count is used for. Most of them are logged at the end of a turn (some kind of \"cleanup\"?) , which is why the threshold works. Whether it's 80 or 30 does not really matter, what matters is that during the turn there's no more than 30 of those logged. Before GvG, there were never more than ~13 during a turn and I can't imagine that this did fundamentally change. \n. I wasn't really aware of this myself (it's been too long since I touched that code), but that's pretty much what happens: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/blob/master/Hearthstone%20Deck%20Tracker/HsLogReader.cs#L557\n. Is that with the threshold being at 13 or at 30?\nEdit: After playing with 30 a bit, it actually missed a regular draw. Trying 25 now.\n. That does look promising as well! So many new logs since GvG, I really need to have a closer look at the logs again. \n. > [Power] GameState.DebugPrintOptions() - option 0 type=END_TURN mainEntity=\nSeems to be logged whenever there's nothing left to do for the player (and, at least against AI, on every opponent turn). Pressing the end turn button does not trigger it.\n. Okay, I changed it to  tag=CURRENT_PLAYER and type=END_TURN now. Judging from the game I played, it seems to work pretty reliably.\n. This might yet be a little longer until we can start on this (I'm having some trouble with it), but we're getting closer :).\n@ToonBoon, @Cu8eR is there a czech/dutch version of HS? hearthstonejson does not seem have any carddb files for those languages at least. There's not really apoint to translating the UI without having translated cards I think, is there?\n. You can't yet, the software-side of things is not done yet (or has been worked on for a while, tbh).\nThis is on my list for 1.0 though, so I will let you know eventually :).\n. Closing in favor of #2797\n. Honestly, I'm not a big fan of the gradients either but I did try solid colors at one point and liked it even less.\nSo if anyone has ideas, shoot! \n. See my post in #979 (work in progress).\n. Looks good. As I said in the mail, might be a few days before I merge this. \n. Manually merged this now .\n. I messed up default values here, already fixed for the next version.\nTo manually fix it:\n1) close the tracker\n2) Go to options > other > tracker, click \"open appdata folder\"\n3) open the config.xml \n4) set  to 0.13 and  to 0.185\n5) save, start tracker, everything should work.\n. This is a neat idea but sounds like a lot of work, at least if hardcoded. \nIs there a reliable way of detecting the \"source\"? The last card changing zones maybe? Would this be reliable in case of e.g. webspinnner?\n. At the moment both show the source. Displaying the returned card itself (and in some cases the stolen one) would be ideal, it's a bit more complicated though, especially for stolen ones. \n. Returned seem to work from what I can tell. Stolen.. not so much.\n. I think I got stolen marks working for the most part now. If possible they show the actual card (works for fireballs created by archmage antonidas), otherwise the card that most likely created it. \nMinor issue I found: only work for one of the two cards created by duplicate but ok I guess.\n. The deck switching works because it checks the played cards rather than the set class.\nI was not able to find the source of this problem but I added a workaround.\nWith the next update, when a game is loaded in stats for the first time, the class will be determinned based on the played cards (for player and opponent) and the class will be adjusted if the cards don't match. \n. Not quite sure why this happens, there's already checks for spectator mode in place. Could be related to issues with spectator mode detection.\nI added an additional spectator check with 78c1110.\n. Spectator mode detection should work a lot better with the coming update.\n. IIRC, there's no logging of attack/spell targets, nor hp, etc. So this is most likely not possible, sorry.\n. Dupe of #446\n. Turning off the \"discard if deck does not match\"  option in options > other > record should fix this.  \nThere is a few issues since GvG with this, I think. \n. Could you give me the deck list with which this happens? Could be related to specific cards. \n. Found the problem (512ba73). Thanks for your help :).\n. Seems to work for me, so this might be related to your keyboard layout / language settings. \nTry checking \"Paste names from clipboard\" in options > other > exporting.\n. Kinda weird that this didn't happen before, it should have. Updating (and scaling) should be fixed now.\n. What exactly is the issue? You have two golden cards but only one is added to the deck?\n. Try lowering the speed in options > other > exporting (maybe to normal) and see if turning off the the \"prioritize golden cards\" options helps.\n. Perfect, thanks.\n. Is it always manawyrm and blizzard?\nAny effect from lowering the exporting speed in options > other?\n. From the screenshots, all looks fine. \nCards are only grayed out once their count reaches zero. \nIn the first screenshot Goblinsprengmagier, Nerv-o-Tron and Azurblauer Drache go from 2 cards left in the deck to 1 card left, while Dr Bumm goes from 1 card left in the deck to 0, thus graying it out.\n. See if #370 helps you.\n. The next MahApps release will fix the issue that forced me to make the changes causing this. I will be able to easily fix this, then.\n.

Maybe you can get it to work with mono / wine somehow, but I don't think so (at least this project). As for the OSX version I linked above, I don't know. Not mine :).\n. Pretty sure this is related to your DPI settings. That should be accounted for but apparently that doesn't work.\n. Good news: I got the crash fixed.\nNot so good news: No idea why they were duplicated or why you can't delete them. Deleting works fine on my end, don't show up again either.\n. Everything you delete in the folder will be generated if needed, so yea you can delete everything if you like. (You got the backup zip anyway :))\n. I think it's related to the logfile size at the start, rather than the version actually. These are different issues though. @305jeff is talking about a permanent freeze until restarted if I understood this corretly.\n. This is hopefully fixed after the next update.\n. Not quite that simple sadly but I'll see what I can do.\n. should be fixed now with v0.7.1\n. Please try the verison linked in #511 (the second one)\n. The replay mode does not work with old game files (pre v0.7.0). It's not possible. But every game from now on should have this kind of replay.\n. There's seems to be an issue with game-end detection. I'm working on it right now.\n. should be fixed now with v0.7.1\n. Hey,\nI'm currently working on a fix for this.\nAs a temp workaround, turning on all modes in options > other > record\ngames should work.\n2015-01-04 18:21 GMT+01:00 eldorador notifications@github.com:\n\nhey\nmy hearthstone deck tracker doesnt record my games, how could I fix it\nplease ?\nI checked in my options and my ranked and casual games are supposed to be\nrecorded\nthis is my log at the end of the game if you need it :\n[18:20:14] Gamestats: Current Game ended after 21 turns\n[18:20:14] GameStats: Assigned current game to deck: Jaina/Medivh\n[18:20:14] GameStats: Game was won!\n[18:20:27] : Refreshed overlay topmost status\n[18:20:28] : >> GAME MODE: None\n[18:20:28] : >> GAME MODE: None(saved to gamestats)\n[18:20:29] : >> GAME MODE: Casual\n[18:20:29] : >> GAME MODE: Casual(saved to gamestats)\n[18:20:29] : Set gamemode to Casual\n[18:20:29] GameStats: Saving DeckStats\n[18:20:29] : Set gamemode to Casual\n[18:20:29] GameStats: Saving DeckStats\n[18:20:30] : Refreshed overlay topmost status\n[18:20:30] : >> GAME MODE: Ranked\n[18:20:30] : >> GAME MODE: Ranked(saved to gamestats)\n[18:20:30] : Set gamemode to Ranked\n[18:20:30] GameStats: Saving DeckStats\n[18:20:30] : >> GAME MODE: Ranked\nthank you for your help\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/504.\n. should be fixed now with v0.7.1\n. v0.7.1 is released already, restarting the tracker should give you a download prompt.\n. That seems to be it, thank you!\n. Do you have the tracker still running from that game?\nIf so \n1) go to  options > other > tracker, check \"show log-tab\" at the bottom\n2) switch to the log- tab\n3) \"save to file\", file will be located in [your HDT folder]/Logs\n\nupload the file to e.g. www.pastebin.com\n. This could be related to the game not resetting on start (#511). Thanks for the log!\n. fixed with v0.7.2?\n. From what version did you update?\nGoogle makes it sound like this is related to Radeon Pro.\n. The stats in the stats window take the filters (mode, timeframe, etc) into account. The deck list currently does not. I would guess that's the issue here.\n. This is with v0.7.1?\nDoes happen after all game modes?\n. see #511\n. Still a problem with v0.7.1?\n. Let me know if this version fixes the problem: ~~http://www.mediafire.com/download/arhwmip8i84j7d0/Hearthstone_Deck_Tracker-v0.7.2_gameendfixmaybe.zip~~\n. Well that's progress at least. This one might do the trick then: ~~http://www.mediafire.com/download/33e9tjhw46lp43h/Hearthstone_Deck_Tracker-v0.7.2_gameendfixmaybe2.zip~~\n. that's just how the new log reader works, that's fine.\n. That sounds promising. Leave it open for now, I'll close it with v0.7.2 release\n. @ToonBoon try deleting (renaming) the config.xml in \"%appdata%/HearthstoneDeckTracker\" (options > other > tracker > open appdata folder)\n. Try checking the \"Force ON\" option.\n. I have one more idea for tonight: ~~http://www.mediafire.com/download/il57674kelpr4ky/Hearthstone_Deck_Tracker-v0.7.2_gameendfixmaybe3.zip~~\nNow I'm heading to bed though. If that doesn't work either.. hopefully I can find the problem tomorrow. Everything working fine on my end makes this pretty difficult.\n. Pretty please? \n~~http://www.mediafire.com/download/ue577113hu2bk02/Hearthstone_Deck_Tracker-v0.7.2_gameendfixmaybe4.zip~~\n. Added an additional game-start check: ~~http://www.mediafire.com/download/6jdtgf1vy4t6l3c/Hearthstone_Deck_Tracker-v0.7.2_gameendfixmaybe5.zip~~\n. This might be the one: ~~https://www.mediafire.com/?bvmx7vm3u4ryy4h~~\nIt's a lot less messy now. The current gamemode gets set to whatever is detected at any time, no matter that. The final decition whether to save game is made when ---RegisterFriendChallenge--- is logged, which seems to be consistently after the rank_window assets are unloaded (which is used for ranked detection).\n. note dialog popup on hearthstone start in that version is fixed with 5c2d24d\n. Do you have the gamemode set to record in options > other > record games?\nCould you give me the tracker log of that happening?\noptions > other > tracker -> check show log-tab -> log tab -> save to file -> upload to www.pastebin.com\n. The \"record games\" options don't refer to recording a replay but to taking the game into account at all. Replay, stats, everything. So that's probably why it wouldn't work-\n. So everything seems to be working fine now?\n. You can keep using the v0.7.2 and delete the v0.7.1 if you like. Data is stored in AppData so deleting what you downloaded will not delete your decks/games. \n. Since I'm out of ideas in case this doesn't work for some reason, released v0.7.2 now. Should hopefully fix all this.\n. damnit... can you give me a log after such a game?\n```\n1) go to options > other > tracker, check \"show log-tab\" at the bottom\n2) switch to the log- tab\n3) \"save to file\", file will be located in [your HDT folder]/Logs\nupload the file to e.g. www.pastebin.com\n```\n. The decks not only don't reset at the end of a game, but not at the start of one either, right?\n. I think I actually got it now! try this: http://www.mediafire.com/download/nj23v2ep2pe62ew/Hearthstone_Deck_Tracker-v0.7.3_PRE1.zip\n. Ah, sorry, yes. This should finally be the working version: http://www.mediafire.com/download/8yelcg2vwgqqkll/Hearthstone_Deck_Tracker-v0.7.3_PRE2.zip\n. Finally some good news! I'll release this as an update. Thanks for testing guys!\n. awesome :)\n. see #511. Please try if the latest download there fixes this for you.\n. see #511 \n. see #511\n. should be fixed with v0.7.2\n. see #511\n. related to #511?\n. should be fixed with v0.7.2\n. 1-3 and 7 are effects of the same issue (see #511), fixing 4 right now, 5 is not a bug, that was just a debugging message for me, and 6: is that in any way (outside the log) noticable\n. So do you have to close the tracker / restart hs to maximize is again?\n. Does it still happen if you enable \"hide in menu\" in options > general > overlay?\n. v0.7.2 should fix numbers 1-4 and 7\n. v0.7.3 should actually fix this now.\n. The latest mediafire link in #511 should fix these issues. Once I (hopefully) get a few confirmations, I'll release an update.\n. v0.7.3 should fix this.\n. also related to #511 actually\n. should be fixed with v0.7.2\n. *should be fixed with v0.7.3\n. see #511\n. See #511. Please try the last download link in there and let me know if that fixes anything.\n. I just reproduced this no problem, tried something to fix it, didn't work. Changed it back, everything works. I don't understand...\n. Weird, not quite sure what that could be.\n. Try closing the Tracker and Hearthstone, then go to [hearthstone dir]/Hearthstone_Data, clear the output_log.txt file, save and start everything again.\n. Possibly related to #668 (permission issues)? If so this should be fixed after the next update.\n. Won't happen anymore with the next update.\n. Should no longer happen with v0.7.3\n. #370 should help you\n. I'm not entirely sure what to remove here. \nNot all heropowers can be logged as PlaySpell, but removing that for heropowers feels kind of wrong too. Maybe I can somehow merge these.\n. I think this is the same issue that causes the minion not destroyed in brawl to not show up. Thanks.\n. I think I got it sorted out. \nTag changes are usually logged like\nTAG_CHANGE Entity=[name=Harvest Golem id=19 zone=PLAY zonePos=1 cardId=EX1_556 player=1] tag=ZONE_POSITION value=0\nHowever, after the recombulation (and I assume the same goes for brawl and faceless) the entity is only refered to by it's id: TAG_CHANGE Entity=69 tag=ZONE value=PLAY\nOnly for a few tag changes, too. After that it's back to the normal entity string. Weird stuff.\n. Lets keep the issue open until the fixes are actually live. I'm not quite sure what I think about all the additional summons yet tbh. \n. fixed with v0.7.4\n. Yes. The issue is in the second part of ResolveZonePos. I need to get the zonepos from all entites except the one that changed, then move the new one to the end if it's somewhere it shouldn't be. I'll try to fix that tomorrow.\n. Alright, that seems to do it.\n. Should be fixed with v0.7.4\n. That's a good idea. \nCurrently I'm only reading TAG_CHANGE messages regardless of them being nested or not. However if ACTION_START is considered this should be easily possible for the most part.\nSample:\nACTION_START Entity=[name=Undertaker ...] SubType=ATTACK Index=-1 Target=[name=Rexxar ...]\n----ACTION_START Entity=[name=Freezing Trap ...] SubType=TRIGGER Index=0 Target=0\n--------TAG_CHANGE Entity=[name=Undertaker ...] tag=ZONE value=HAND\n----ACTION_END\nACTION_END\nDeaths are handled in a seperate (\"toplevel\") action after SubType=ATTACK but merging those should be possible.\nACTION_START Entity=GameEntity SubType=DEATHS Index=0 Target=0\n----TAG_CHANGE Entity=[name=Undertaker ...] tag=ZONE value=GRAVEYARD\nACTION_END\nThis could also solve the heropower problem (#529). Probably requires some restructuring of the replays.\n. Besides me not remotely having the time to do that, I don't know if it would even be possible. Maaaaybe on rooted devices, I wouldn't bet on that either though.\nNot happening from my side, sorry.\n. could be related to #530\n. Yup, druid of the claw works with the latest build, same issue. Closing this.\n. same as #535, see #530 - issue fixed for next update (I'm gonna leave this one open for visibility)\n. fixed earlier today by @mvy with #536 \n. fixed with v0.7.4\n. fixed with v0.7.4\n. On turn 19, the unit is just not updated until the following attack by the peacekeeper, same as turn 21. That's to be expected since triggers are not included in the replay and happen after summons/plays.\nNot really sure what the issue with defender of argus might be. The original log now being included in the replays should help us figure this out.\n. Yes, that's just how it currently works. The issue is though, that buffs are sometimes not appearing at all.\n. Same goes for e.g. knife juggler. The problem is that, from what I could tell, the log only contains a trigger followed by the damage taken. No real indication of an attack or an attacker/defender.\n. Looks good, thanks\n. Can you elaborate on what you mean exactly? \n. Did you overwrite? If so, that's definitely a bug. Otherwise that's intended. \n. Oh that's a good one :D. No worries! \n. I answered an email with a similar question earlier today, just gonna paste that, maybe it'll help you out already:\nThe first thing you need to do is turn off \"save data in appdata\"  and \"save config in appdata\" (*see further down) under options > other > tracker. With that all files will be stored directly in the main folder.\nYou can drop that folder into e.g. Dropbox for everything so sync automatically.\n*One thing to mention: if you have different paths for hearthstone of the computers AND you want to sync  via e.g. Dropbox, you need to have separate config files. You only disable \"save data in appdata\"  and leave the config there. Then before starting the tracker on the other computers you need to create the \"%appdata%/HearthstoneDeckTracker\" folder and copy your config.xml there. (press win+r and type %appdata% to get there)\nThis is a bit inconvenient but should work.\n. Choosing the data location is already in for next update (#571)\n. It looks like the config and playerdecks files are set to readonly. As to how or why, I don't know.\nBut since this doesn't seem to work too well, have to tried moving the whole folder to dropbox? I've heard people had success with that.\n. Where did I say \"fixed it\"? Wrong issue?\n. Ah, yes.\nSee #629 for a list of what's fixed and what's yet to do.\n. Hearthstats syncing looks very solid with the v0.10 prereleases so far. \n. Or you just turn on \"auto sync\" and \"sync on start\" on both :). But in essence that's what happens, yes.\n. What exactly are the issues remaining for you with the latest v0.10 prerelease for you? \n. 0.9.10 is the latest actual release, but not the version I am talking about :). You can download the latest pre-release here:https://github.com/Epix37/HDT-Test/releases\n. If you don't have your data in AppData you have to overwrite, otherwise you can just drop it anywhere.\n. Not that I can recall. One thing that is not working yet in that version is the syncing of tags (down) but that's fixed by now.\n. There's an option for that in general > other I think. Though this may very well be a bug. \n. So... apparently the option wasn't even used. Not sure where that got lost but it works again now.\n. fixed with v0.7.4\n. Fixed for the next update with f14ab9f\n. fixed with v0.7.4\n. It only grays out secrets if there were two active and one triggers or if two of a type were played already (except in arena). \n. With the new log reader that might be possible. Not too high on the priority list for now though. \n. @mvy There's no documentation of the log available. I would guess you can find it in the code but so far I (and I guess others, too) just deduced it from collected logs.\n. Second report in this direction. There seems to be a an issue with clearing the log file. Apparently it sometimes gets cleared after the game started. \n. Oh it might not be a log file issues after all. \nIn 0.7.3 the tracker returns 0 as turn number if the mulligan is not yet over. That check uses fixed indices in the entities for the player and opponent. If some some reason the indices are different this will happen. \nThat behaviour was also causing other problem and is already fixed with 175e49e. So I'm pretty positive this is fixed as well.\n. should be fixed with v0.7.4\n. Hey,\nCould you upload a log of that happening?\n. Options > other > tracker > show log tab, \nOptions > log > save to file \n. Should no longer happen with v0.7.4\n. works now.\n. fixed with v0.7.4\n. I would put it below the \"Deckname\" and \"Search...\" textboxes, but this is probably a good idea, yes.\n. That imports the cards played by the player. Opponent import is indeed currently missing.  I will be adding that to  the stats dialog with the next update. \n. re-added with v0.7.4\n. Do you see it when you unlock the overlay? \n. Options > general > overlay > \"unlock\" (button at the bottom) \n. It.. Well, unlocks the overlay :). Let's you move anything on it. \n. But from that I assume it showed up again at the start or the next match? \n. I agree. Done.\n. added with v0.7.4\n. fixed with v0.7.4\n. See #549 for the zero turn issue. Not sure about why there would be no replay files though. I think they're not being deleted at all currently.\n. Oh, I was talking about the actual replay files not getting deleted (.hdtreplay). Stats do get deleted if you delete the deck (depending on options), so that would explain this. \n. Replays were a very recent addition. Stats are saved in the DeckStats.xml\n. The \"zero turns\"-issue should be fixed with v0.7.4\n. While this should no longer happen with v0.7.4, see if it's the same issue as in #550. (To get to the config: options > other > tracker > open appdata folder)\n. Sorry, I should've mentioned this: you have to close the tracker before editing the config. (you have to do it again) \n. The description matched exactly that problem. Even with v0.7.4 you should still change that config setting.\n. fixed, thanks\n. Mark tooltips should be turned on by default. I think even more different marks wouldn't do any good. \n. I don't quite understand what you mean. Could you rephrase that?\n. You can add \"Arena\"-tags to your arena decks (with the deck selected: EDIT > QUICK SET TAG > ARENA) and then filter your decks via DECKS > QUICK FILTER > ARENA to only show arena decks.\n. I'm not a big fan of the glow or the tabcontrol animation but I manually merged the reshaper fix and proxy with 205bc55. Thanks!\n. Do you have .NET Framework 4.5 installed?\n. fixed with 12e8a52\n. should be fixed with v0.7.5\n. This is probably the same issue as #499? \nI just tried to reproduce this and failed. What windows are you using?\n. I have a feeling this is related to windows 7. I'll investigate, thanks.\n. The window should now activate automatically before showing the update message. While that's a bit more \"intrusive\", I think it should solve this.\n. The next update might finally fix this. (it will probably still happen when updating the next time)\n. Random guess: what happens if you turn off aero on win7?\n. You can achieve this via tags: \n1) EDIT > TAGS: add US, EU, ASIA\n2) Add tags to decks\n3) DECKS > QUICKFILTER > (select e.g.) US\n4) STATS > Overall > \"Apply tag filters\"\n. What's the best way to detect the server?\n. should be fixed with v0.7.5\n. I think I found the cause.\n. should be fixed with v0.7.5\n. This is currently not quite working with the way the files are copied when disabling \"Save Data in AppData\". It just checks and moves them from/to \"locally\", not the DataDir path. \n(Also I realized replays are currently not moved at all)\n. I think that happens in MainWindow_Load: SetupDeckListFile(), SetupDefaultDeckStatsFile() and SetupDeckStatsFile().\n. Crashes on start when turning off \"Save Data in AppData\" without having a path set. \ndataDirPath is \"\\\\[file].xml\" at that point.\nAlso: what  happens if I have \"Save Data in AppData\" disabled and then change DataDirPath? I actually don't know but I would guess it's not handled.\n. Looks good :). I fixed the last few issues I found.\n. Looks good, thanks!\n. Closing in favor of #692\n. fixed, thanks\n. fixed with v0.8.0\n. Try turning on options > other > exporting > paste names from clipboard\n. You can see that by simply opening the stats screen. I don't think we need a notification for this. \n. I think especially with the addition of #571 (ability to set the data directory) it should be easy enough to do this manually if desired. \nI will leave this open though, in case someone feels like implementing this (maybe even me at some point).\n. I think this goes too far in the direction of \"deck prediction\" again. \nSee #376 and also #263 for my reasoning behind not wanting to implement that.\n. Deck prediction is currently not on the table, sorry.\n. Could you upload the actual .hdtreplay file (found in the Replays folder), not the game file? :)\n.

Go to options > other > tracker and click \"set hearthstone path\", select your Hearthstone folder. Check if that fixes the problem. \nIf not: Close Hearthstone and the tracker. Then copy the \"log.config\" file from [Hearthstone Deck Tracker]/Files to \"%LocalAppData%/Blizzard/Hearthstone\" (press WIN+R, paste) and replace the existing one, if there is one. Check again.\n. Perfect. Out of curiosity, which one did it?\n. Perfect. Out of curiosity, which one did it?\n. See #416 for player notes. That's still something I plan on adding.\nCard notes is an interesting idea. Not quite sure how to implement that though. \nI find writing notes on the overlay a bit iffy. Maybe clicking on a \"card-age\" mark could display something like <= [current max mana]? More of a \"half-way\" solution but a lot cleaner.\n. added with v0.8.0\n. Looks good, thank you!\n. I really like the idea but it feels.. confusing?\nA few issues I see right now:\n- Without having any changes, there's just an empty panel on the right, not at all telling you what it's supposed to be. Maybe there should even be an extra button to expand this?\n- The version indicator in edit mode should probably not be in the menu bar.\n- Yet another dialog after saving a edited deck (\"I just wanna edit a card, leave me alone!\").\n- That -1! lol (we need to clean up the numbers in general though)\n- The history panel  still contains the last edited deck when creating a new one or editing one without a history.\n- Stats overview needs some changing, height increase mainly.\n- Version numbers in help and the tray tooltip now display \"0.7.-1\"\nWhat if we moved the version indication and increment to the top of the history panel? That would pretty much solve the first 3 of the problems. \nSomething along the lines of \"[Textbox with current version] -> [Combobox containing current, minor increment and major increment]\"?\n. Hehe, I figured you might like this one!\n. I would love to merge this into master, yes! \nIf you need any help fixing things up, let me know. I should have some spare time this weekend.\n. Pushed this to feature/DeckVersioning to at least have the merge conflicts out of the way. \nLooks a lot better now. Still needs quite a bit of work but we're getting there :).\nI also liked having major and minor, I think I'm gonna put that back in. \n. How about graying out the cards instead of having red numbers?\n\n. The history panel now matches the rest a bit better, reintroduced minors and changed the version selection a bit:\n\n. You've got a point. Like this maybe? \n\n. If anyone is up for some testing: http://www.mediafire.com/download/ms6zl7ai66c2xru/Hearthstone_Deck_Tracker-v0.7.6_PRE5.zip\n(@GiggliG   :))\n. Easiest will be to just create a backup of you appdata folder. I went back and forth between this and v0.7.5 a few times without problems, should be fine. \nJust to be save, probably still a good idea.\n. \"Update from web\" should work just as any editing would. Or am I misunderstand you somehow?\n. Oops, thanks.\n. Okay, I think all the minor things (mentioned) are fixed. Being able to select the version is a good idea, I will try to imlement that. \nSelecting from the majors (or even all versions, for what I care :)) is a neat idea but probably won't make it into the first release of this.\n. Oookay, that was a lot harder than expected but it seems to be working somewhat. \nLatest build with the fixes and version selection: http://www.mediafire.com/download/42hyw1s8sw42b8b/Hearthstone_Deck_Tracker-v0.7.6_PRE6.zip\nEdit: this version crashes if you overwrite a deck with a new deck (via new or import) with the same name but a different version. \n. Save as: \nthis is a good idea!\nHow exactly should that work though? You would probably want the ability to save it as \n- a fresh v1.0 (no history) \n- one of the 3 default options (1.0, 1.1, 2.0)\n  right?\nSo menu wise:\n- SAVE\n  - 1.3 (current)\n  - 1.4\n  - 2.0\n  - SAVE AS NEW\n    - 1.0\n    - 1.3 (current)\n    - 1.4\n    - 2.0\nHow does that sound?\nDelete version:\nIn addition to EDIT > DELETE, I would just do EDIT > DELETE SELECTED VERSION (v[version number here]), which deletes the version currently selected in the dropdown above the deck. \nOr alternatively, expand the delete menu to:\n- EDIT\n  - ...\n  - DELETE\n    - COMPLETE DECK\n    - SELECTED VERSION\n  - ...\nMove to new deck:\nSimilar to above, either have EDIT > CLONE SELECTED VERSION in addition to EDIT > CLONE? Or expand the menu:\n- EDIT\n  - ...\n  - CLONE\n    - COMPLETE DECK\n    - SELECTED VERSION AS\n      - 1.0\n      - 1.3 (current)\n      - 1.4\n      - 2.0\n  - ...\nI'm not really sure about the submenu of CLONE > SELECTED VERSION\n. The \"set active version\" should be already in (64c4536) with the the PRE6 I linked. At least half of it, I think games are currently assigned to the latest, not the selected version (that's an oversight on my part).\nThe games of deleted versions are indeed a problem since PlayerDeckVersion == null gets assigned to 1.0. Not sure how to handle that either. For complete decks I have \"default decks\", one for each class, to which games of deleted decks can be moved. Maybe something similar... Might have to wait for another release.\nThere is no real difference between save as and clone at this point. One is accessible via EDIT and the other via SAVE in the edit panel. Having both is just more convinient plus \"save as\" is more natural than clone.\nI did go a bit overboard with the options in my previous post :). Removing the last sub menu level for each one, as @GiggliG suggests should make it much more manageable.\n. I added you as a collaborator. You can now just push things directly to feature/DeckVersioning. \nThis way we don't need to to things twice :).\n. - [x]  Added \"save as\" and \"clone selected\"\n- [x]  Removed the \"How do you wish to save the deck\" popup\n- [x]  Clone dialog now reads:\n\nClone game history?\n(Cloned games do not count towards class or overall stats.)\n[clone history] [do not clone history]\n- [x] also fixed cloning player, oppponent name and replay reference\n\nI think, to get this working for now, moving decks between versions and deleting versions probably has to wait for the next release.\nAnything else that's still missing?\n. Git is still confusing the hell out of me sometimes...\nI just wanted to rebase this on master after merging the missing cards feature, but that didn't quite work for some reason.\nSo I pushed the rebase (this) to master now, everything seems to be working fine. I hope...\n. I'm going to close this, as it's merged now. We can continue discussion here though.\n. Latest (master) build: http://www.mediafire.com/download/7ri8h2c0asppz7b/Hearthstone_Deck_Tracker-v0.7.6_PRE7.zip\n. There is a mac version being worked on at the moment: https://github.com/Jeswang/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker-Mac\n. So this in only happening in \"no deck\"-mode, yes?\n. This is probably obsolete (or at least not worth the additional effort) with #604.\n. What exactly is the question?\n. See if #595 helps you.\n. Very good :). Enjoy!\n. I ran out of \"new\" cards to test this with, but this might work:\nBasically use the same check you use for seeing if the second card exists, but check for the light blue tint instead. Since this may be ignored by my \"ignore sparkle\" shenanigans, checking for the valid pixels below x% of height*width might also work. \nThen, if that it the case do the \"move mouse over card\" but add a await Task.Delay(100) (maybe a little longer) after each movement.\n. Another idea: save the list of missing cards to the deck, and add a way to display the same message via the menu. (thanks @n4ru :))\nI don't mind adding this one myself.\n. For the config changes: adding this to MainWindow_Load.ConvertLegacyConfig(...) should work.\nif(configVersion <= new Version(0, 7, 6, 0))\n{\n    if(Config.Instance.ExportCard1X != 0.04)\n    {\n        Config.Instance.Reset(\"ExportCard1X\");\n        converted = true;\n    }\n    if(Config.Instance.ExportCard2X != 0.2)\n    {\n        Config.Instance.Reset(\"ExportCard2X\");\n        converted = true;\n    }\n    if(Config.Instance.ExportCardsY != 0.168)\n    {\n        Config.Instance.Reset(\"ExportCardsY\");\n        converted = true;\n    }\n}\n. Implemented my 2nd and 3rd comment and refactored all of it to make a bit more clear what's actually happening.\n. The crashs should be fixed with be971ad. If that's what's causing the SecureAnywhere issue, it should be solved with this as well.\n. Okay, there seem to be a lot of antivirus issues in the past few days (day, actually) and I have no idea why. v0.7.5 has been out for more than two weeks without any trouble. I can see the fix I mentioned about somehow being an issue but #609 suggests otherwise. \nThere has to be a better way than setting antivirus software to allow it.\nIdeas anyone...? \n. v0.7.5: https://www.virustotal.com/de/file/d2ab6885c3588f09479c08c6211e77939e5e6527730680fd9a3fd87ec249078e/analysis/\nlatest build: https://www.virustotal.com/de/file/7e9803f20bb5403344a9edd82d0e4d634b1a219c7c063c79d10fc7e1b0c1ac4b/analysis/\nMy guess it's it was indeed the issue that caused the crash above. (clipboard reading)\n. should be fixed with v0.8.0\n. As the number of cards is correct, I would guess here (as I did in #610) that there are currently issues with the logs due to (server) issues on blizzards end.\n. Does it happen every time you play against a warlock?\n. should be fixed with v0.8.0\n. You are correct, I'm pretty positive it's not possible for the games logs. I tried quite a bit :). Mkjogo (I guess you were using?) does this via monitoring traffic, which is something I want to avoid doing for staying as clear from TOS violations as possible. \nI would very much love to see that feature too.\n. Thanks :). \nThe next update will have quite a bit of cool new stuff! \n. If you want to use it exclusively on the new PC disable Save data in AppData and Save config in AppData in options > other > tracker that will move all the data (except replays with the current version) in the tracker folder. \nTo move the replays, if desired, open the appdata folder via options > other > tracker > open appdata folder and copy the Replays folder manually.\nIf you with to use the tracker on multiple PCs check out #545.\n. This seens to happen alot lately. I don't quite understand why or at least why it didn't before. \nCould be an issue with it accessing things on the clipboards it's not supposed to, if that's the case be971ad should fix that. (edit: just noticed you had this happen while just being in the options... I'm clueless...)\nYou did download it from here: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/releases, right?\nYou might have to somehow give it permissons back, I'm not sure how that works though (possibly #454 ?). Also see #605. \nYour decks and data should be fine, they are stored at \"%AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker\".\n. As I said, decks and data are stored at \"%AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker\"(options > other > tracker > open appdata folder or press WIN+R and paste the address).\nDid you succeed in disabling any of the options? If so, the data might now be located in the \"damaged\" folder and you might have to copy it back to appdata. Otherwise it should still be in appdata.  \nLook for a config.xml and a PlayerDecks.xml (maybe even a PlayerDecks_backup.xml), let me know where they are (appdata or local) and I can tell you what to move where.\n. Was there no \"PlayerDecks.xml\" file when you made the copy? That's the one where, well, the decks are stored :(. That's the one you need. If that file is gone, there's not much that can be done. Maybe check your recycle bin.\nThe error message on start may be related to the antivirus issue still, I'm not sure. All it means is that the update-check (for a newer version) failed.\n. No it's not :(. That one is basically empty and there's actually no reason for the tracker to generate that file anymore, I'm just too lazy to remove it.\n. In short, yes. \n. No problem, sorry for the mess.\nLets hope I can find out why this happens.\n. One more thing, do you have logs from your antivirus software deleting the tracker, you could send me? Maybe that helps figuring this out. (epikz37@gmail.com)\n. This could be an issue on blizzards end (server issues), logs seem very inconsistent lately. \n. Haven't seen / heard of this issue in a while, closing for now.\n. Kind of. \nAfter each game assets get unloaded, one to two of which are the medals:\n[Asset] CachedAsset.UnloadAssetObject() - unloading name=Medal_Ranked_17 family=Texture persistent=False\nTwo issues:\n1) asset unloading is sometimes unreliable\n2) I don't know of a way to tell which asset unload belongs to the player and which to the opponent.\n. For now it'll be only your own rank. Opponent is not out of the question for the future though.\n. Go to \"%appdata%/hearthstonedecktracker\" (press WIN+R, paste) and delete the \"config_backup.xml\" file.\n. Uuh.. ookay.. \nThe file 'C:\\Users\\jack\\AppData\\Roaming\\HearthstoneDeckTracker\\config_backup.xml' already exists. is apparently why it crahed.\nTry deleting all the files there and see if it starts.\n. I know you already updated .NET framework, but try reinstalling it again, reboot, see if it starts then.\n. See my last post in #605. Update should be out this weekend.\n. Though, you can actually download the (almost) latest build here: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/pull/599#issuecomment-72009724\nThere should be no issues, but I would still suggest you back up your \"%AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker\" (Win+R, paste) folder before you do so. \n. Should be fine with v0.8.0\n. There are people working on that :) https://github.com/Jeswang/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker-Mac\n. I would bet it's #303\n. Hmmm. Gerneral idea is good, few things though:\n- Mouseover to close doesn't seem to be working for me\n- I think this should be displayed in addition to the message on the tracker\n- Should probably be an option?\n. Perfect, thank you.\n. This is most likely some artifact from the antivirus issue that has been happening lately. Try unblocking it in your AV.\n(Latest totalvirus scan)\n. \"Merging\" can be done the way @GiggliG describes it here. Not the best way but I don't think it worth putting too much effort into this. Though it will be easier with the next release, which will allow to move multiple games at once, to a arbitrary version of a deck.\n. Local replay support has now been fully removed.. Downlading previously created decks from HearthStats should be fixed. Latest build: ~~official beta test version~~\n. ~~Latest build~~\n- Changed IP\n- Manually adding games\n- Automatic uploading of manually created arena runs (once the first arena game is assigned)\n- Should no longer sync local arena decks as constructed decks\n. I don't know what you're talking about! :P\n. Progress:\n- [x] sync-now not picking up on new stuff\n- [x] tag changes not auto synced up\n- [ ] tags not synced down\n- [x] games being assigned to wrong versions when syncing down\n- [x] modified decks not synced down (unless force full sync)\n- [x] delete hearthstats decks now supports multiselect\n- [x] visible progress when syncing (up)\n- [ ] improved syncing speed\n. fixed with v0.9.0\n. Local replay support has now been fully removed.. The json format no longer exists, sorry.. Awesome! I will check it out tomorrow night!\n. - We can achieve this then by just writing \"[Archived]\" into the note when syncing.\n- Sure, the autoselect changes are ok!\n- I wouldn't include archived decks in the selection dialog or auto selection. If there's demand for that we can just add an option for it later on.\n. We write \"[Archived]\" in the note field when uploading decks to hearthstats and parse it to set the archived state again when downloading. Source URLs of imported decks are handled the same way. \n. That's how it should work, yes. \nSo, what if you just add\nforeach(var version in deck.Versions)\n    version.Archived = archive;\nhere?\nWhat exactly is it messing up though? Archiving/Unarchiving decks with any number of versions and any of them selected seems to work fine for me.\n. 1.0 gets uploaded, Versions get uploaded\nAddUrlToNote is actually only run once, I think. It's only needed on the main deck so that should be fine?\n. Yea, changing the note does currently not update on hearthstats. I'll change that for the future. \n. You could call HearthStatsManager.UpdateDeckAsync(deck, background: true); after setting the archived state.\n. Currently there's no way to do that, the all fields in the edit call are mandatory. There's not really a big difference in data anyway. If it turns out to be a problem we can still change that later.\n. Yes\n. Try this: http://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/2oqn8t/useful_trick_to_get_borderless_fullscreen_again/\n. Weird. Can you give me a more exact interval?\n. Could you check your config.xml and tell me what these values are at?\n<ExportClearCheckYFixed>\n  <ExportClearX>\n  <ExportClearY>\nYou can find the config.xml via options > other > tracker > open appdata folder.\nTo work around this you could for now disabled auto clear cards in options > other > exporting to hearthstone.\n. Hm those should be correct. What's your resolution? You could try (w/o the tracking running) to slightly increase the ExportClearCheckYFixed to 0.19 or 0.195.\n. I have had this happen once before, too. But I can not for the life of me reproduce it.\n. Hey,\nI assume this is related to having \"too many decks\"? If so, #637 might solve this already.\nAbout the EU, NA: You can add new tags (server specific) via EDIT > TAGS and tag your decks with those.\n. I'm forgetting about my own features here. You can change the sorting of the deck list via DECKS > SORT / FILTER and choose between name, winrate, last edited and tags. \nLast edited should be pretty close to what you are looking for.\n. Games already have a region property. \n. It just tied those settings and it seems to work no problem.\nAre you using the latest version? I can see this happening if you started v0.8.0 once but then went back to v0.7.x.\n. Is there just cards missing or does it export zero cards?\nDoes clearing existing cards in deck and searching for cards work?\nIf so, please check what the following values in the config.xml (options > other > tracker > open appdata folder) are set to:\n<ExportCard1X>\n  <ExportCard2X>\n  <ExportCardsY>\n. That looks correct.\n\nIs there just cards missing or does it export zero cards?\nDoes clearing existing cards in deck and searching for cards work?\n. That's weird.\n\nTry (without the tracker running) to set the ExportCardsY value in the config to 0.2. This is % of screen from the top, so 20% of the screenheight, from the top. If that's not enough try increasing it further. \n. Maybe try lowering the speed in options > other > exporting\n. :+1: \n. I'm currently working on separating arena runs from constructed decks. For that the history panel has to go anyway so I will add a way to also hide in (by default w/o versions) for constructed decks.\n(this may take a while)\n. This is starting to look half decent (and work)\n\n. > Did you consider to put the bar to select classes horizontally, above the list? \nThat would mean the min-width of the window thing does towards the 1000px mark. Way too wide. I working on getting it even slimmer again.\n\nI think it looks better if you don't make the icons bigger when they aren't selected.\n\nI'm not 100% on that one either, BUT:\n- so much space around them looks awkward\n- the selection highlighting makes it migh clearer which ones are selected that it just being slightly bigger\n- imagine it's a button you're pushing down :)\n\nYou could add percetages and, why not, win-loss numbers below each icon or, if you keep it vertical, on their side.\n\nI want to keep that bar as small as possible. IMO it's just not necessary if you can see it with a few click in the stats. Not really information you need to have available at any second.\n\nAt the end of each deck line, you should add the win-loss numbers as well, even if you don't end up releasing this new layout.\n\nI tried this a few months ago, it get's problematic once the number of games on a deck are too high. \"100 - 100\" just doesn't fit anywhere.\nI do however plan add this to arena runs, which will be separate from constructed decks in the future. Separating arena runs is also the main reason I re-did this in the first place. It's just a huge mess otherwise. \nHere is the whole thing actually filled with decks:\n\nI think it looks way better this way.\n. Released with v0.9.0.\nFeel free to still leave feedback.\n. The exporting part was accidental, I'll fix that, thanks. \nAbout allcaps.. I'm gonna make it an option :). Caps fits the metro stuff better.\n. Uhm.... @Elitesparkle: There is no uppercase when exporting for me. Does that happen with all decks for you?\n. Try if windowmode or borderless window mode has any effect. \n. Could you restart the tracker, try to export a deck and then upload the \"hdt_log.txt\" you find in the Hearthstone Deck Tracker/Logs folder?\n. Good thing I print the full exception there... \nTry this: \n1) close the tracker\n2) rename the config.xml in %AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker to something  (e.g. to config1.xml) \n3) try exporting again\n. If that doesn't help, see if setting a delay in options > other > exporting (wait X seconds before starting) does.\n. Hmmm... maybe try turning Aero on/off.\n. I have a feeling it's something rather simple but I'm out of ideas at the moment :/.\n. Yea. I would guess it is some issue with the overlay being focused for some reason (which is why I thought of aero). Not sure what that tells me though. Maybe a graphics card driver issue? Try updating that if possible.\n. That is with v0.8.0 right? Probably minimized to tray?\nDoes it work again if you download 0.9.0 manually?\n. It is happening because of this: e73d347\nI modified the behaviour with v0.9.0 0abcde7 but the core issue (ActivateWindow()) still remains. I'll remove that for now..\n. Alright I got this sorted out now! The issue was that the window was not fully initalized when the windowstate was set. Since neither waiting for _initialized nor IsLoaded does the trick, I added a 10 sec delay before the message. Should to it.\n. That's actually an issue with MahApps (the metro-style framework I'm using), not my software. I don't have access to the element throwing the null exception.\nThat said, I'm sure there is a better way than using a timer. I'm just lazy :).\n. I would not suggest turning off the update check.\nSimply update to the latest version manually: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/releases and turn off \"minimize to tray\" until the next update.\n. should be fixed with v0.9.3\n. Do you still have the session running? Could you upload the hdt_log.txt from the Logs folder for me?\n. I think I got this fixed for the next release. \nWhat should do then (i.e. not yet): \n1) logout of hearthstats in the tracker\n2) go to stats, select all the matches that dont belong there\n3) be sure you logged out\n4) press delete\n5) matches shouldn't sync again\n. uhm... it maaay have deleted all those matches on hearthstats now..\n. well.. uh.. good, lol.\n. Am I correct in assuming the arena deck has no matches or not exclusively arena matches on it?\n. Ok.\nThat is not really something I can correct automatically on old games. \nYou can manually edit the PlayerDecks.xml and set <IsArenaDeck>false</IsArenaDeck> to <IsArenaDeck>true</IsArenaDeck> on the affected decks. That's the only way I can think of at the moment.\n. Here is how I check if a game is an arena game: \nprivate bool? _isArenaDeck;\npublic bool IsArenaDeck\n{\n    get { return _isArenaDeck ?? (_isArenaDeck = CheckIfArenaDeck()) ?? false; }\n    set { _isArenaDeck = value; }\n}\npublic bool? CheckIfArenaDeck()\n{\n    return !DeckStats.Games.Any() ? (bool?)null : DeckStats.Games.All(g => g.GameMode == GameMode.Arena);\n}\n_isArenaDeck gets ignoed as long as it's null, no not explicitly set by anything. This the value in the PlayerDecks.xml. It get's either set when you create a new arena run (new with v0.9.0) or when CheckIfArenaDeck, which checks if all associated games are arena games, returns true or false. If there is no games it stays undetermined. If it's set (IsArenaDeck in the PlayerDecks.xml has a value), no further checks are made.\nSo changing IsArenaDeck in the PlayerDecks.xml will overwrite what the tracker determined. \n. Because they have matches with mode \"None\" associated with them. A \"old\" deck is only considered an arena deck if it has exclusively arena matches on it.\n. What do you mean not related to a deck?\n. So the question is how the games got in there in the first place?\nNo idea :).Could be some weird hearthstats syncing issue with the deck being considered constructed..? not sure. The date doesn't make much sense to me.\n. I don't know. Maybe you had the deck selected at some point. Not really an important issue if it's not happening continously IMO.\n. Will be fixed, yes.\n. 73dfdb7 should fix the issue where the deck selection dialog doesn't contain filtered decks.\n. 1. are all decks with versions I assume? that is already solved and will be fixed with the next update shortly. \n2. being worked on right now :)\n. new version is out, should fix 1. (you have to sync them again)\n2 is a serverside issue and will be fixed soon\n. What version, synced? from where to where? Is the total (ALL) correct?\n. Perfect, thank you.\n. fixed with v0.9.3\n. #370 should have the fix for you\n. :+1: \n. This is an issue with v0.8.0 (I think).\nTry manually downloading the latest version here: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/releases\n. Could you email me the PlayerDecks.xml and DeckStats.xml?\n. Oh, also: is the order of the versions correct?\n. possibly related to #662?\n. oops I forgot to update the new file it checks, thanks lol\nAs for account state.. probably not at the moment. sorry.\n. You're welcome :)\nTo fix the exporting: enable options > other > exporting > paste names from clipboard\nFYI: I'm not the one developing the OS X version ;)\n. :+1: \n. enable options > general > overlay > 'extra features':) \n. There is so much stuff in the options, no way to know everything :). No worries!\n. That is an issue with updating behaviour, sorry. Please manually download the latest version here: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/releases\nThe next update will fix this (not yet released). To prevent this from happening the next time you could disable \"minimize to tray\" until then.\n. You mean the numbers displayed on HearthStats? Yea, I think the latest is under \"current version\". The web end is still being worked on I think.\n@trigun0x2?\n. Okay, I will have a look, thanks.\n. How did your test decks end up with so many version, especially multiplicates?\nOther than that, they seem out of order on HearthStats for me but all are there.\n. Should be fixed with v0.9.3. Thank you for reporting this.\n. ~~HEARTHSTATS > DELETE SELECTED DECK will only delete one of the version, but clear all ids locally for it to be syncable again. So you can do that, manually delete the other and then resync.~~\nNvm. I misunderstood what you meant by version. Yes, that should work.\n. Sorry, I thought it uploaded two decks, not two versions. In which case I meant the second deck on hearthstats. But just ~~delete selected version~~ delete selected deck and syncing again should do the trick.\n. deck, yes. Sounds like something finally starts to work as intended!\n. Very helpful, thank you.\n. Where and how exactly did you delete decks?\n. Good news: stats are not gone. Working on a fix.\n. This should fix it: http://www.mediafire.com/download/z8qqs2y04c104vv/Hearthstone_Deck_Tracker-v0.9.4PRE1.zip\nSelect a deck with missing stats, HEARTHSTATS > DELETE SELECTED DECK, restart tracker. Please let me know if that works for you.\n. very good! sorry about that.\n. Finally an issue I don't need to panic over :). Fixed.\n. I would suggest trying to reinstall the latest .NET Framework before we look any further.\nFor the updater issue: try  #454\n. uuuh.. Windows 7?\nNeither clicking nor rightclick - show opens it?\n. So you can get it open by trying to open it, then restart it? \nIf not:  go to \"%AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker\" (Win+R, paste), open the config.xml and set <MinimizeToTray>true</MinimizeToTray> to false\n. Alright, thank you. As long as you can get it open at all you should be fine for a day I guess? :)\nShould be fixed now and there will probably be an update tomorrow night (~24 hours from now)\n. I should have time to work on this again mid next week, so some time then. \n. Please let me know if there's still any issues with the latest build here: https://github.com/Epix37/HDT-Test/releases\n. This seems to happen now for some reason.. not sure why. If anyone has ideas, please tell me.\n. ooh, right. thank you.\n. Yes, you are probably right. Thank you for the PRs!\n. Do you have an empty deck selected or \"cards\" in options > decks > player turned off?\n. Then please email me the \"Logs/hdt_log.txt\" file after this happens. (epikz37@gmail.com)\n. i appreciate it :)\nYou need to actually play a game with the tracker running before the log will show any valuable information. Restarting the tracker resets it.\n. Is this happening with any specific decks only?\n. Try if  options > overlay > reset helps. If not I will probably  have to implement some additional logging with the next update to figure this out. \n. Do decks show up properly in the tracker itself when you select it? \n. Does it show up in the player window? (options > general > additional windows) \n. Could one of you, without the tracker running, try to rename the \"config.xml\" (e.g. to \"config1.xml\") found in \"%AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker\" (Win+R, paste) and see if it works after? And if it does please send me the renamed config to epikz37@gmail.com,\n. @dvide I like having you around! Thanks for finding this. I'm not quite sure why that code was there either. :)\nEdit: I now remember. Otherwise the selected deck does not get set on start. I now just added a check for there being a selected deck.\nI kind of assumed the issue occoured while having a deck selected in the tracker. Explains making it hard to reproduce. \n. That is an issue with updating behaviour. Please manually download the latest version here: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/releases (should be fixed with this one).\nIf the current version doesn't open from the tray: rightclick - exit and start it again. Will be fixed with the next update.\n. Oh wow.. uhm.. yea.. \nI think the solution here is to just rename the Updater.exe (and make according changed in the updater and the tracker).\n. You have to choose \"arena run\" when creating a new deck to be able to add more than 2 of a card.\n. Didn't get around to this yet but it's on my todo list for the next update.\n. I think I found the issue. Do you guys have include obtained cards enabled in options > decks?\n. Could you upload the hdt_log.txt found in HearthstoneDeckTracker/Logs after that happened?  (www.pastebin.com)\n. @WaxPaper I do release tests build (usually in issue somewhere) every now and then when I feel it's necessary. Maybe I'll do that a bit more regular in the future. \nThis being one of the cases where feedback might be helpful, please check if the current build still has the same issues (I can't seem to reproduce it): https://github.com/Epix37/HDT-Test/releases\n. There were two issues with the deck selection dialog, the other one was related to \"include obtained\", this one seems not to be. Enabling the option should not fix it, no. \nIf the prerelease still has the issue, please upload the hdt_log.txt for me (see above).\nEdit: actually, with the prerelease the hdt_log.txt is saved in \"%AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker/Logs\"\n. @Pand3m0nia With what version is that?\n. > It'll keep looping back to the \"incorrect deck\" error until you either choose the \"no deck\" option or close the dialog menu, which will force the client to use no deck and turn off auto-detection.\nDid you cut that out by any chance? I can't seem to find that part in the log. \nCould you send your \"PlayerDecks.xml\" and \"config.xml\" files (\"%AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker\") to epikz37@gmail.com? Maybe that helps finding the issue.\n. This looks promising, I'm able to reproduce it. \n. Alright, I'm fairly certain I got it fixed. Please try the latest build: https://github.com/Epix37/HDT-Test/releases/tag/v0.9.6_PRE2\n. Great! :) Thanks for the help guys!\n. That it working as intended\n. Tags don't affect whether decks are categorized \"constructed\" or \"arena\". The types of matches on them do. I'm gonna add a way to \"convert\" in both directions for cases like this.\nI would guess the reason you no longer see them is because you're filtering for certain tags? Try DECKS > QUICK FILTER > ALL\n. The quickfilters sometimes don't react. Did changing the filter in DECKS > SORT / FILTER work then? \nYour decks that are miscategorized, Do the arena decks have non-arena games on them and constructed decks arena games?  (Either way, as I said: I'll add a way to change switch decks between arena and constructed)\n. Does that happen with all decks?\n. What do you mean by \"understand\"?\n. Try running as administrator. That issue will be fixed with the next update.\n. It it's not administrator please manually download the latest version here: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/releases\n. Is that just the time displayed on the website? iirc I pass the start time of matches and it did return that time when syncing decks back. If so, the correct dates are already there, just not used. Should be easy to fix in that case.\n. See #667\n. That is an issue with updating behaviour, sorry. Please manually download the latest version here: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/releases\n. Try (re)installing the latest .NET 4.5 Framework\n. The move game dialog now also let's you specify the target version.\n\n. The easiest is probably to just throw the whole control away and re-do it.\n. I did start working on it recently: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/tree/constructed-stats\nSome time Q2 2016 is probably a reasonable guess.\n. Anything I missed?\n\n(sorting not final)\n. Yes it's the same time filter as arena has. Plus I added \"last season\" for both.\nI'll look into multi select. That would probably make sense for (O.) Class and Region too.\nI was also thinking about adding regex support for the Opponent Name and Note fields. That would essentially allow multi select there as well.\nEdit: I think the multi select has to come later. There is no native support for this but I have a nice idea how to solve it. If anyone wants to PR this, I would basically like a ComboBox with CheckBox items that I just throw a [Flag] enum into. Using a ToggleButton + ContextMenu for the ComboBox is the easiest solution that comes to my mind\n. The current and last season have separate dropdown items, you can access all the other one via the 'custom' filter (i.e. setting a start and end date). Chances are you are not looking at past ones often enough to justify the UI clutter.\n. Added \"custom season\" to time filter, which allows to set a season range. E.g. 22-24 or 25-25 (current only)..\n. pre-release: https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/releases/tag/v0.14.3\n. Added with v0.14.4.\n. This should be fixed now.\n. awesome, thank you.\n. Now displayed on top of the deck (only) when editing.\n\n. fixed with edbb637\n. Hm, I can't reproduce this. \n. Most likely this issue: #303\n. Uh.. It should just use whatever time your pc is set to. That might explain missing games though. iirc, the upper bound in time filters for stats is the 11:59pm of the current day. \n. Please check if the games show up later. They might just not be displayed \"yet\". \nStats should stay when saving the deck as current.\n. Closing in favor of #1422.\n. You can turn on \"advanced text search\" (I think that's what it is called)  in options > general > other to achieve exactly this. \n. You have to run hearthstats > delete deck on each deck. It will probably give you a message that deleting was not successful but re-uploading should work again after. \n. Sync now only gets decks/matches since the last sync from hearthstats, force full sync gets all. \n. @andburn do you want me to add that one to the \"available plugins\" list?\n. Fixed with https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/608fd115b3e80e02943d8560c0cbf11ee2cff803.\nFor new matches only. Can't fix this for existing ones.\n. #859 maybe a viable alternative?\n. Please try this and let me know if the problem persists.\n. I like it, thank you.\n. That seems to be working for me.\nAny chance you have Discard game if incorrect deck enabled in options > other > record games and the decks don't match? Otherwise this could be related to #707.\n. To help figure this out, please play a game with a deck and selected version where it does not record the game and upload the hdt_log.txt found in \"HearthstoneDeckTracker/Logs\" afterwards. (www.pastebin.com)\n. You only sent the PlayerDecks.xml, I need the DeckStats.xml, too :). \n. Good news: I found a way to automatically recover the games. Most of them will not have a deck assigned but the next update will allow for moving multiple games at once to a different deck.\n\nNow to find the underlying issue.\n. Fixed. Should be working as intended with the next update.\nThanks for the help guys and thanks @hauntedjuan for the data!\n. Whoops. Should be good now :).\n. If anyone wants to do some testing, latest build:\nPlease back up your \"%AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker\" (Win+R, paste) folder, just in case\nhttps://github.com/Epix37/HDT-Test/releases\n. I deleted the one liked here and didn't update, sorry.\nNot sure why the two releases say 10 days ago but they are not. Both contain this fix.\n. Same issue as #712. I will look into it, thanks.\n. Actually running two instances would probably have a lot of issues that don't even cause crashes. Data would not be synced properly between them. \nWindowname should be the easiest solution here, I agree.\n. It now checks if the hdt_log.txt is locked to determine if another instance is running. This may not be the most elegant way, but since the file is already locked anyway checking for that seemed like the easiest solution. \nThe advantage of this, compared to processname, is that running multiple instances with different data directories (which you need anyway to run with multiple hs instances properly) will still work.\n. Just making the window bigger fixes the issue here, but you are right. I will add a scrollbar.\n. Hey, that looks good. \nWhat exactly would you want to do different from your second commit? Have the counter as a separate (moveable) object on the overlay?\n. Oooh. I'm a bit slow today apparently. I finally understood the issue.\nOld config values are not overwritten by default. \nTo make that happen add this:\nif(configVersion <= new Version(0, 9, 6, 0))\n{\n    if(!Config.Instance.PanelOrderPlayer.Contains(\"Fatigue Counter\"))\n    {\n        Config.Instance.Reset(\"PanelOrderPlayer\");\n        converted = true;\n    }\n    if(!Config.Instance.PanelOrderOpponent.Contains(\"Fatigue Counter\"))\n    {\n        Config.Instance.Reset(\"PanelOrderOpponent\");\n        converted = true;\n    }\n}\nto MainWindow_Load.ConvertLegacyConfig()\n. And done! Thank you!\n. Holding left ctrl while clicking \"show replay\" or doubleclicking a game now opens the old dialog.\n. There currently is a config setting for that. %AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker/config.xml: AlwaysOverwriteLogConfig\n. The easiest solution here would be to not replace the file but check on start if the required log types are there and add them if not.\nAnother issue you might run into is that the tracker clears the output_log.txt after each game for performance sake.\n. no longer overwrites the file but adds the required lines with v0.10.2.\n. I don't think there would be much use for this. \nProbably the easiest thing you could do is write a script that writes your output_logs line by line into the actual output_log (while hs is running). The tracker should pick that up just as a normal game. \n. Anything that's not relevant is ignored, yes.\n. Possibly, but I don't have any idea how. \n. You can currently kind of do that with this month and last month. More filters for stats are planned: #692.\n. Instead of selecting the tag after a game I think I would dynamically apply them based on the cards played by the opponent. \nSo this would work similar to the way deck-tags are managed, with the addition of each having a class and a set of cards associated that identifies the tag.\n. I like that idea. \nSomething like this possibly (simple tooltip): \n\n. With the coming addition of a \"show website\" feature (soon(TM)), removing urls from the notes entirely would probably be the easiest solution.\n. That would increase the minumum height of the window since all the icons on the left need to be visible. It could obviously be optional and the min height would increase depending on that, BUT if you need to see the notes (e.g. during a game) you can just leave the flyout open. \n. [oops, wrong issue]\n. And an acutual reply to this:\nThere are known issues when cards are marked as \"new\" in game. Otherwise it is supposed to be able to tell 1 from 2 missing cards,\n. The log would probably say that everything except the shown was found.\nWere the remaining 7 cards missed when exporting (do you own them) or are they not showing up on the incomplete report either?\nHave you tried lowering the speed in options > other > exporting?\n. This could possibly be a resolution issue. Are all the cards listed if you set the game resolution to 1024x768 ?\n. Alright, I will look into it. Thank you!\n. Hm weird... seemed to work fine for me :/. \n. Adjusted the delay before checking for the lock with higher updating speeds with v0.10.1\n. Stats are currently only displayed for the selected version, could that be the case?\n. Most likely same issue as #739. Will be fixed with the next update.\n. Released as-is with v0.9.7, will still see more improvement with the next update(s).\n. 1) Could you send me your playerdecks.xml and deckstats.xml again for testing?\n2) Yes, that is a good idea.\n. Fixed, thank you!\nI will add the option once the new options menu is merged into master.\n. I will just add \"active version\" (which is the current behaviour) and \"all versions\" (all time history) for now. I'm not sure the others are really that useful (I don't like the stats filter affecting other stuff in the first place), plus that doesn't require any new code :).\n. I like the idea.  How to phrase that though? \"current major\", \"selected major\"? Will people understand what that means? \n. There we go. \n\nStill not sure how happy I am with the naming.\n. Is the process still running after the logo disappears? Tray icon? Does starting as administrator work? \n. I will have a closer look at this next week.\n. Thank you!\nAs I said, still on my todo list. Can't really say when I get around to it though. (Or how long it takes to fix it)\n. Found and fixed this problem.\n. Now it is!\n. Very strange indeed. Might be an issue with some old decks worth versions. \nA deck being archived on hearthstats should not affect syncing. \n. So, one non-ranked game got recorded on the druid deck, yes?\nAnd the game that's not supposed to be there is a casual one?\nIs this consistent? (Do all e.g. casual games get recorded even though they're not supposed to?)\n(FYI: you can delete games in Deck > Games or Overall > Games)\n. \"None\" suggests that this was most likely just an issue with the log, a disconnect or something like that. \nIf you can't reproduce this I'll probably not consider this a problem for now.\n. Oh, I meant to change that. That you. I'll merge this when I get home. \n. OnSelectedDeckChanged is called on start if a deck is selected, and otherwise the edit menu is disabled, so you can't access the note dialog in that case. Stats only shows the overall part if no deck is selected. \nThis should not be an issue / the changes don't have any effect? Or am I missing something?\n. Please try reinstalling the .NET Framework and reboot.\n. Will be fixed with the next update!\n. I disagree, I think this would be pretty neat. But lots of other stuff has way higher priority.\n. FYI: Games without deck are tracked! In the stats screen: Filter > Games: Without deck\nThis has been requested a few times and I'm not a fan. To detect a deck has two copies of a card requires that card to be played two times in a single game, meaning it will most likely take a quite few games to complete the deck. You would most likely end up having to add the last few cards manually in many cases.\nAnd if you plan on playing multiple games with the deck anyway, why not take the 20 seconds it takes to create a deck in the tracker? FYI2: You can add cards with enter or 1-5 (to add 1st-5th) in the edit screen, to build decks very quickly\n. I may actually just have found a way to reliably import constructed decks from the game similar to the way it works for arena.\n. Give it a try: #762 :)\n. Depending on how well the constructed importing turns out to work, yes.\n. This is probably issue #268. That was fixed in the main window with v0.7.0 however and has been working flawlessly for me ever since. Is this an issue for anyone else?\nMy biggest problem is that I never understood why the \"fix\" there worked in the first place. So this might be a though one to fix. I'm going to try having the images as embedded resources. Maybe that helps?\nEdit: having the images as a resource doesn't seem to  help. (Still testable in the old game detail dialog where I didn't bother to fix the issue yet)\n. Same issue as #753. Saving screenshots / exporting used to remove invalid characters, that got lost for some reason. Will be fixed with the next update.\n. Fixed for the next update with #746.\n. Hmmm...\n1) I feel like this doesn't belong in the overlay. It clutters the screen a lot and is probably not really all that useful during a game. If you are at a level where that information is useufl for you, you most likely know all cards by name anyway and can see the relevant information by glancing at the cards left once. I could see that in some \"deck detail\" screen however, with pie charts and stuff like that.\n2) Opponent rank can be determined the same way the player rank currently is. Two rank assets are unloaded after the game (or one if they are the same?). In addition, the player rank also get's unloaded at the start of the game (the medal in the menu). From that it should be terminable what the opponent rank was. So if this get's added, I would prefer it to be automatic. Also it would need to be added to the notefield (like [HDT-opprank xx]) of the game when uploading to hearthstats, since they currently don't store the opponent rank).\n3) Yea, should no longer be necessary.\n. 1) For me it sits outside of the screen for all but one row :). It's too much to just slap it on the end of the deck. I would still vote for the \"deck detail\" flyout, at least as a base, otherwise it feels like we skipped a step. We can possibly extend parts of it to the overlay from there, but in a more \"organized\"(?) manner. As a separate, moveable and scalable panel, control over which mechanics to display, etc.\n2) it's this stuff.\n. Did you go back to the main menu before importing again?\n. Just tried exactly that, worked fine for me. One way of probably preventing that would be to have the user specify what class the deck will be Import from game: constructed > [Druid, Hunter, ...]. I would prefer to avoid doing that though.\n. I made a change to the class detection: ~~https://github.com/Epix37/HDT-Test/releases/tag/v0.9.7PRE4~~\nDo you still have the issue with that?\n. The easiest way of figuring out what's going on would probably be for you to debug through HandlePossibleConstructedCard and BtnConstructed_Click.\n. Brief explanation of how the whole thing works: \nOn exiting the collection screen all cards get unloaded, including the cards in the book on the left. Those are unloaded last though and can be easily filtered out by manacost. \nProblem: these may include low cost cards that are actually in the deck.\nSolution: there's also a \"card was already in cache\" message, that fires when the deck opens (arcane shot was on the left in the book, and is now also found in the deck). \nThe list of \"possible constructed cards\" then contains (or should contain) 4-8 druid cards (those on the first page, no way around that) plus all the cards found in the deck  and on the first page of that class.\nEdit: I found the issue but since I wrote this already, might aswell post it :). The part that filters out cards would kick in after the druid cards in some case. This now ignores the first 8 cards. \nBuild: https://github.com/Epix37/HDT-Test/releases/tag/v0.9.7PRE5\n. Wouldn't work. The cards are already loaded at that point and will therefore be unloaded when exiting the collection screen. Search filter resets when exiting so that won't work either. \nMaybe there's some way, but I don't see it. Doesn't really matter either way though since this seems to work now. \nProblem with automating is that you need to select which deck to import and have to start from the menu to make sure the user didn't open other decks before. (On that note: I have a local branch where I started working on starting the exporting process from any screen though :))\n. The problems seem to be related to golden versions of the card. I'll try to figure that out.\n. Should work a lot better now: https://github.com/Epix37/HDT-Test/releases/tag/v0.9.7PRE6\nWhat you have to do: run \"set up constructed importing\" in options > tracker > importing once. That usually shows up with the explanation when clicking the import menu item for the first time but you probably did that already.\nI will add a way to import new versions using this once it's working well enough.\nA few cards from the first page of a class might still be missing here or there but for the most part my testing seemed pretty good. Innervate is stubborn for some reason, no idea what's up with that.\n. That's weird. Same issue with all classes / decks? \nMaybe it's just the way you phared it, but you have to go back to the main menu after creating a deck, before importing. Importing must only consist of \"menu, collection, deck, back, back, import\".\nIf that doesn't work maybe try running the setup again, then restart hdt.\n. I agree, there might not be a solution to the druid issue. Though adding a few cards manually is not really the end of the world. \n\nSo !string.IsNullOrEmpty(c.PlayerClass) && c.PlayerClass != \"Druid\" returns false when the card is a neutral, which I think is not what you intended.\n\nThat actually is what I intended. I want to know if the deck contains any non-druid class cards. And if so, the druid cards can (and must) be ignored in the following count because a deck of another class was opened. The reason for the count check is that cards sometime get added out of order. I don't remember why but I had e.g. abusive sergeant as 8th or 9th unloaded card, causing _doneImportingConstructed to be set to true.\n. Just a sufficiently large number, yea. The issue was abusive sergant at 8 or 9, must be less than 15 (when each card x2). Maybe 11 is better, don't know. 10 seems to work though.\nI do not have a golden abusive sergeant, no.\n. released as \"beta\" with 0.9.7. \nI love how you can just slap \"beta\" on things nowadays and people are totally ok with it if things don't quite work. :).\n. Improved the behaviour of this and arena importing a bit with c42889f: Both items are always enabled and will show the instruction dialog if not enough cards were detected yet.\n. That only gets logged when in debug mode. None of the release builds ever do so. \n. IIRC, the HearthlyGaming log contains the account country. We could deduce the region from that. That's only logged on game launch though I think. Another way might be some config of the bnet client / hearthstone? I tried looking for something a few weeks back but couldn't find anything worthwhile in any of the configs.\nI thought about different profiles before, too. Should be very easy to implement. Although I would assume you wouldn't actually use different profiles for the region? That would mean you couldn't see stats for other regions / overall stats and would have to create/import decks multiple times. OR have means of copying and syncing decks across profiles etc.. Ugh!\nWe could probably rather have a special \"regions\" property on decks to separate those and a \"region\" field on games.\nThat's IF we can properly detect it. \n. HealthyGaming is one of the log \"types\" you can add to the log.config. \nThat config item sounds promising though!\n. I figured the name would be different everywhere. Shouldn't be much of a problem.\n. Perfect.  The region is now detected on game launch.\n. I have no idea what I'm doing... would this work?\nTimeZoneInfo timeZone = null;\nswitch(Game.CurrentRegion)\n{\n    case Region.EU:\n        timeZone = TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById(DateTime.Today.IsDaylightSavingTime() ? \"CEST\" : \"CET\");\n        break;\n    case Region.US:\n        timeZone = TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById(DateTime.Today.IsDaylightSavingTime() ? \"PST\" : \"PDT\");\n        break;\n    case Region.ASIA:\n        timeZone = TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById(\"KST\");\n        break;\n}\nvar offset = timeZone != null ? timeZone.GetUtcOffset(DateTime.Now) : new TimeSpan();\nvar date = (DateTime.Now + offset).Date;\nif(Config.Instance.GoldProgressLastReset.Date != date)\n{\n    Config.Instance.GoldProgressTotal = 0;\n    Config.Instance.GoldProgressLastReset = date;\n}\nLooking at FindSystemTimeZoneById, it probably needs to at least be Central Europe Standard Time and judging from the list here I don't need to check for summertime?\n. Alright, so this should now work I guess :).\n. It seems the game started unloading \"random\" medals lately, not sure what to do about that.\n. This is indeed related to the friendslist. \nThe problem is: your medal does not get unloaded when entering a game while the friendslist is open. Meanins there is no way to detect the rank (resulting in the dash). Another medal could now get unloaded if someone on the friendslist signs off or ranks up/down (resulting in the wrong rank). No way to detect that either.\nIf the friendslist was open, the last medal unloaded seems to be your own, in which case everything works as intended.\n. The game unloads assets (e.g. images) every now and then, when it no longer needs them. The log contains those unloads. One of those is the medal in the \"Play\" screen on the start of a game. That's the one I currently use to determine the rank. \nThe problem is: when the friendslist is open during the loading screen, that medal stays loaded (as it is on the top of your friendslist). \nThere is no message like \"started ranked game at rank X\", sadly :).\nAnother way would be to indeed use image recognition, but I'm yet hopeful that there is a better way.\n. 50% of the time during my testing today I didn't get any medal unloads at the end of games. Not sure why but that will probably not work. Plus (I think) the order in which your and your opponents medal (if not the same) are unloaded is random. Making it impossible to determine which is which.\n. Possible, but gets a lot more complicated with users not running HDT all the time, playing on multiple regions and so on. \nI'm still hoping for an automatic solution to this. \nHow often is the rank actually wrong? Another easy workaround would be to enable editing in the stats screen for at least the rank.\n. It's far from as simple as \"just converting the exe\" :). Very far.\nI have no idea if it's even theoretically possible android, so that's a no for now, sorry. \n. Does the tracker work at all? \n[12:29:18] LogReader: Error cleared log file: System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException: Could not find a part of the path 'D:\\Hearthstone_Data\\output_log.txt'.\nWould suggest otherwise. \nGiven, I think spectator does indeed have issue right now, fixing your hearthstone path might help (at least with other functionality). Options > other > tracker > set hearthstone path \n. What do you mean by disabling?\n. (This is actually what I've been working on for the past hour)\nSpectator mode detection is fixed (this also resulted in notedialog / deck detection behaving inproperly). Game result detection still has issues but I think most people won't care about recording spectator game stats anyway. \n. Could be related to aero. Try turning that on/off if you can.\n. So all is good? :) \nI don't think there is anything I can do about the issue itself. It's just due to the overlay being transparent.\n. How would that be faster to read?\nI see no reason to change it. \n. I think it's fine the way it is.\n. Do you have .Net Framework 4.5 installed?\n. Yes\n. You can manually set the path via \"option > other > tracker > set game path\". See if that helps.\n. That's something I planned on fixing myself, too. Go ahead :).\n. I think I found and fixed what caused the tag behaviour. \nAnd you can't usually have tags with the same name, only through that bug.\n. Here is the latest (hopefully final) build: https://github.com/Epix37/HDT-Test/releases/tag/v0.9.7PRE9\nSee if you can still reproduce the tag issue now.\n. Technically that would obviously be no problem and I wouldn't mind adding it but I'm interested in why. Is would require the same amount of clicks as it does currently. All loading times would be similar. \nShould the edit panel be better organized? Is the name textfield too small? What's the main reason for not wanting to use the normal edit? \n. The window now automatically moved to the left if opening edit causes it to go outside the screen. \nAs for the name editing, is this along the lines of what you had in mind?\n\n\n. Ah perfect, thanks.\n. I had no success reproducing this.\nCould you email me (epikz37@gmail.com) your PlayerDecks.xml and DecksStats.xml (found in %AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker - Win+R, paste) as well as the name of the deck you were trying to move the games to?\n. Hey, \nThe window should remember the size you set it to. I'll look into that. \nResizing any frames containing cards is difficult for the very reason you mentioned: cards graphics. Those are already at their maximum size and increasing would make them blurry.  Not really something I would want. \n. There is no way around that. \nI could possibly add it to the tracker ui somewhere. \n. Does anything other than All and Current Season make much sense here? Today maybe. \nStuff like Last week is probably not necessary.\nGiven the stats screen will get an overhaul at some point.\n. \n\nThe date picker is german on my system for some reason, even though nothing else is. Will be the appropriate language on other systems though.\n. I would say this is only makes sense for discarding when the cards don't match?\nA zero turn game is just that and shouldn't need this imo.\n. \n\n. It shows up fine in fullscreen mode for me. Does it by any chance show up if you move your cursor to the left or right of the gold in game?\nYou could also try turning on borderless window mode. \n. The positioning for that area works a bit differnt from the rest of the overlay items. Instead of using alt-enter, does the ingame options menu maybe contain the correct resolution for you? Setting it there and enabling fullscreen mode should fix this.\n. Try (re)installing .Net Framwork 4.5 and reboot\n. Great :) have fun!\n. Close HDT, open the config.xml in %AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker and set <ResolvedDeckStatsIds> to false\n. Could you email me your output_log.txt found in Hearthstone/Hearthstone_Data when this happens? (epikz37@gmail.com)\n. I had no success reproducing this. Neither with the output_log, nor the PlayerDecks and config used here. \nNor can I find what's supposed to cause the NullReferenceException in SetPlayerHero. Am I blind?\n. Let's leave this open since it's actually still not fixed :).\nAnd on that note, the workaround we found seems to be disabling \"auto deck selection\".\n. @dvide I'm not so sure. If that was the case, the log (above) would show \nLogger.WriteLine(\"Found more than 1 deck to switch to - last played: \" + lastDeck.Name, \"HandleGameStart\");\n. The only possible null exception I see is DeckList.Instance.Decks containing null\nhttps://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/blob/38a9a1108836012d433b8edadea295115a5ed215/Hearthstone%20Deck%20Tracker/GameEventHandler.cs#L327\nCould that be?\n. Sounds like HDT doesn't have permissions to access it's folders. \nI think creating the folders manually (HDT, HDT/Files and HDT/Images), then dropping the corresponding files in there worked before with this type of issue. \nJust adjusting the security properties of the folder might work, too.\nOr you are straight up missing files? Especially the \"Images\\HearthstoneDeckTracker.ico\"\n. Ok good :).\n. There's probably a better way than having the tabs. Redoing the stats screen is on my list for the near future. I'll have to play around with it a bit to see what works. \n. The tabs behave a bit more logical now. \nSelecting stats or games will select it for both deck and overall.\nMeaning:\n| action | selected tabs |\n| --- | --- |\n| starting | Deck : Stats |\n| click Overall | Overall : Stats |\n| click Games | Overall : Games |\n| click Deck | Deck : Games |\n. Yes, I will still redo it in some other way in the future. But this was quick to do and feels a lot better.\n. How about something like this actually: \n\n(the opponents \"breakdown\" is still a bit WIP)\nWith this stats would be displayed in a separate window by default. Not sure what to do yet with the space on the left. Probably some more graphs? Card mechanics breakdown, something like that? Oh and also #882.\nEdit: We don't even need the \"class\" tab, right? Stats for each class are already displayed in \"overall\" and the opponent breakdown changes depening on the selected version (deck) or class (overall). That should have everything covered.\n. You may want to give #545 a read, especially this\n. I don't think the tracker could even technically cause the game to crash, as there is no direct interaction between the two. Most likely just a random crash?\nI have not heard of anyone else having this issue. \n. The replay viewer will see imporovement at some point!\nYou can still access the old game viewer by holding CTRL whiling clicking \"show replay\" in the stats screen. Maybe this is close enough to what you are looking for for now.\n\n. [work in progress]\nhow is this? :)\n\nI will probably add checkboxes to the top, too, similar to the screenshot above.\n. Went with a context menu for the checkboxes, this way everthing stays very clean but you obviously need to know that it exists, not sure.\n\nI originally went with two lines because I still had \"Attack attackername -> defendername\", no way to fit that in one line :).\nSide to side comparison for single and double line:\n\nSingle like looks very odd in my opinion, even more so if you have different lenghts for the \"prefix\" (draw, attack, ...). Icons might look really good, if so you have suggestions on ones to use, please suggest away!\nAlso not quite sure on the grouping (checkboxes, icons) yet. Currently I have this\n(straight up the code but I'm lazy and it should be understandable enough)\n``` C#\nswitch(kp.Type)\n{\n    case KeyPointType.Attack:\n        if(!Config.Instance.ReplayViewerShowAttack)\n            continue;\n        break;\n    case KeyPointType.Death:\n        if(!Config.Instance.ReplayViewerShowDeath)\n            continue;\n        break;\n    case KeyPointType.DeckDiscard:\n    case KeyPointType.HandDiscard:\n        if(!Config.Instance.ReplayViewerShowDiscard)\n            continue;\n        break;\n    case KeyPointType.Draw:\n    case KeyPointType.Mulligan:\n    case KeyPointType.Obtain:\n    case KeyPointType.PlayToDeck:\n    case KeyPointType.PlayToHand:\n        if(!Config.Instance.ReplayViewerShowDraw)\n            continue;\n        break;\n    case KeyPointType.HeroPower:\n        if(!Config.Instance.ReplayViewerShowHeroPower)\n            continue;\n        break;\n    case KeyPointType.SecretPlayed:\n    case KeyPointType.SecretStolen:\n    case KeyPointType.SecretTriggered:\n        if(!Config.Instance.ReplayViewerShowSecret)\n            continue;\n        break;\n    case KeyPointType.Play:\n    case KeyPointType.PlaySpell:\n    case KeyPointType.Summon:\n        if(!Config.Instance.ReplayViewerShowPlay)\n            continue;\n        break;\n}\n```\n. It's already about double as wide as it was before, do you really want to have it go across half your screen? :) Plus... I tried and didn't work out too well, so if I can avoid it I'd like to. Centering wrapping text properly is ugly.\nI agree icons would be the way to go. Just need to find decent icons now.\n. Having ~6 colors might be hard to remember (especially not so common ones), plus it would probably look a bit weird, depening on how you implement that I guess. Icons would be a lot more self explanatory. \nSecretPlayed belongs to Play, good point. ~~I think I could agree on heropower, too.~~ Summon means mainly tokens, yes. I plan on merging multiple summons, Onyxia whelps whouls show as \"Summon Whelp x6\". Having it as a separate group might still be good though.\nI'm trying to find a place for the filter where it doesn't break the look too much.. Harder than one would expect. \nedit: this might be the way to go\n\n. Latest build: https://github.com/Epix37/HDT-Test/releases\nShould be pretty stable. More than the live version actually.\n. I think shapes would have the same issues as colors. I'm still voting icons :). I'll try to find (or even make) some tomorrow I think.\nEasy! Procs (Knife juggler, Rag, etc.) don't work anyway in replays :P. I don't see that happening any time soon either, as I can't get that information directly from the log. Would have to somehow deduce those...\n. @HandEyeProtege with 2) you mean removing all filters for a specific turn only?\n@Cu8eR on the \"Draw Faerie Dragon\"-like nodes? Currently not. That's a good idea though.\n. New build with all of the above: https://github.com/Epix37/HDT-Test/releases\n. I really suck with inkscape but to get an idea what it could look like:\n\n. Icons...\nI want to keep everything in one color to work with the accent I think. At least as long as I do it myself. Making that stuff is hard enough already :). \nDiscard: I was thinking - instead of + but a cross might work, too.\nDeath: yup\nHeroPower: really not sure\nSecret: yup\nAnd the one I have no idea what to do with: Play.\nMaybe an extra one for summon, too, or just the same as play.\n... I need to find someone who's good at making these sort of things.\n. Heropower: I think class icons (or class hero powers actually) are overkill. Something along these lines would problably be good:\n\nPlay.. yea.. idk. One face down, and one face up card might work if you could somehow get that clear enough on that scale. \nReally depents on whoever I can find for this (I put something in the newsticker now). \nI just don't want 6 icons in 4 inconsistent styles.\n. Oh those are awesome!\n. \nWent with these for now. Having play and heropower be the same icon should be fine.\n\n. How well the importing works highly depends on what cards are in the deck. Everything that's visible on the left side (in the book) may cause trouble. I would suggest running the setup for constructed importing agan and see if that solves it. (option > importing > set up constructed importing)\n. Do you mean the player deck window or the actual overlay?\n. I'm not able to reproduce this at all. All combinations of minimized, minimzed to tray, starting HS first, starting tracker fist, in game and in menu work fine for me. \n(I'm using the dev build obviously, so I could have unintentinally fixed this already)\n. I think I may have had a very similar issue all day long without realizing it. \nWhen HDT is started (no matter if minimized or not) after hearthstone, the overlay does not update until you click out of hearthstone and back in again once (not necessarily into the main HDT window).\nI have a strong feeling this is related. (If so, it's fixed now)\n. Could you send the config.xml found in %AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker (Win+R, paste) to epikz37@gmail.com ? Even following your steps I can't reproduce this. Maybe there's some specific setting that causes this.\n(Pre-releases do not have updated version numbers)\n. This very much sounds like it's a DPI problem. (please be a DPI problem!)\nTry prerelease 4 here: https://github.com/Epix37/HDT-Test/releases\n. Go to \"%appdata%/HearthstoneDeckTracker\" (Win+R, paste) and rename the \"DeckStats_backup.xml\" file to \"DeckStats.xml\"\nIf the problem persists, open the \"Backups\" folder, open the latest zip (or second to latest possibly) and replace the \"DeckStats.xml\" with the one from the zip.\n. Go to \"%appdata%/HearthstoneDeckTracker\" (Win+R, paste) and rename the \"DeckStats_backup.xml\" file to \"DeckStats.xml\"\nIf the problem persists, open the \"Backups\" folder, open the latest zip (or second to latest possibly) and replace the \"DeckStats.xml\" with the one from the zip.\n. What so you mean by \"all history\"? \n. What so you mean by \"all history\"? \n. In addition to what I said before, try \na) deleting the config.xml\nb) replacing all the files from one of the backup zips\n. Yea.. not sure why that was happening in the first place. Will be gone with the next update.\n. Yea.. not sure why that was happening in the first place. Will be gone with the next update.\n.

With the next update hide in menu will no longer affect that tooltip and there will be an option to have it turned on permanently.\n. See #471.\nThis is something I still plan on adding at some point and want in for the \"1.0\" release (whenever that's gonna be). So far it got delayed due to designtime exceptions using wpflocalizeextension and just my desire to constantly change the GUI. Having to change in over a dozen languages every time would make that quite hard.\n. I would guess this is some log issue. Probably not worth investing time into unless it keeps happening.\n.

You can increase the scaling for the two deck lists under options (advanced) > overlay > player/opponent. I think that might help in your case.\n. You can increase the scaling for the two deck lists under options (advanced) > overlay > player/opponent. I think that might help in your case.\n. I do rarely do things other than fixing reported bugs and implementing suggested features. \nPlease note that this is a project I work on\na) in my spare time\nb) for free\nand most important: c) for fun!\nPluigins are fun because it is something new to learn and try out. Having fun means I am less likely to get burnt out and am more likely keep adding and fixing stuff (given I have the time to do so). Makes sense?\nSO, you were speaking of problems. Please do elaborate.\n. My current test setup is the former. PRs would kinda defeat the purpose :).\nI just pushed it to a remote branch now: see here.\nObviously not done yet, probably lots of public/internal issues, but the basic functionality is there. Reference the exe, implement IPlugin, place dll in HDT/Plugins, good to go.\nThere are not really any events in the code plugins could hook on to at the moment either, might be something to consider. Probably the easiest by exposing an API for the most common things.\n. Not really sure how to handle events yet. Having \"normal\" public events means plugins could crash the whole app, no good. Just try-catching those means if the first throws an exception, no one else gets notified, no good either. \nMaybe having multiple interfaces plugins could implement is the way to go? \nIDeckManager:\n-OnNewDeckCreated\n-OnDeckSelected\n...\nIGameEvents:\n-OnGameStart\n-OnGameEnd\n-OnPlayerDraw\n...\nStuff like that?\n. @Cu8eR I do clean up from time to time, but often when it comes to how to spend my time (coding vs cleaning here), coding wins. As for the PRs, I don't completely dislike the ideas, that's why they are still there. None of those are very high priority though. Feel free to keep pointing out outdated/solved issues and I will gladly close them.\nActually on topic:\nI think I found a decent way of letting plugins have (save) access to events: the ones I added for a start. Currently there would be no way to unsubscribe from those events but I think chances are noone would do that anyway, ever, right? :) ~~Also as of now, the events would keep getting called even if the plugin is disabled (at a later point). Need to figure out something for that...~~ Figured out.\n. Added a few more events.\nHere is a test build: https://github.com/Epix37/HDT-Test/releases/tag/v0.9.8_PRE3_PLUGINS\n1) reference HearthstoneDeckTracker.exe\n2) implement Plugins.IPlugin\n3) do whatever!\n4) place YourPlugin.dll in Hearthstone Deck Tracker/Plugins\n- plugins are displayed under options > plugins\n- \"events\": API.DeckManagerEvents and API.GameEvents\nThis is one where I really need feedback more than ever. What other events or API fuctionallity would you guys want? What's public but should be internal? Vice-versa?\n. It would, yes.\n. Would a \"Plugins\" menu item (or even titlebar dropdown button) be sufficient? I could then give IPlugin a bool WantMenuEntry and MenuItem MenuEntry. \nBeing able to add entries to the main menu would technically not be an issue either but the menubar does not really handle too many items to well. If an item cant be fully displayed it just gets cut off.\n. As it stands, changing the UI is probably possible but very \"hacky\" and will probably easily break if things in the UI change.\n\nAdd an extra line of detail to the Deck Stats page, that showed the frequency each enemy class was encountered within the current filter time period (not just by this deck, by all decks)?  \n\nPossibly, not sure. That's something I would very much willing to have by default though, so a pullrequest would be a much better fit for this.\n\nAdd new filters to the deck stats (like server), replace existing filters (like change the Mode to a multi-select format, so you could pick Ranked + Casual, or change Timeframe to a date picker with Start and End times).  \n\nProbably not? Maybe. Again, I would have no problems with this as a default.\n\nEdit stats en masse, so i could select all games with a particular deck, and change the server to US or EU, for instance.  \n\nYes. But again, no need for that to be a plugin.\n\nadd a text box at the top of the deck list, so that I could enter letters and it would filter to show only decks with those letters in the name\n\nMaybe :). If it's implemented and integrated in a fitting way I would not mind having this as a default feature either.\n\nat the top of the deck list we have Arena, Constructed, and down the side the 9 classes plus archive. In one of those places I'd like to add specific tags (like \"Favourite\") so i could click and it would filter to decks with that tag, but also when i click one of the other buttons it would clear that filter (to avoid the menu fiddling).\n\nAgain maybe. And again something that I wouldn't really mind as a default feature.\nIn conclusion: Just because things can (or could) be done as plugins does not mean that's it's necessary, the best way or even the easiest way. All of the things above would be way easier to implement directly in the application, than into make them work as plugins.\n. @GiggliG Well, it's not neccessarily me doing the work :). But whoever would implement those as plugins might as well just submit a pullrequest for the feature. That's the point I was trying to make.\nAnother topic:\nNot sure if this will be actually useful for anyone but me, but the next pre/release (not 0.9.10) will have a simple debug window, which currently displays (live) all property of the Game class and all entites during a game. Accessible via options > tracker > logging > debugwindow.\nIf you are planning on making plugins it's probably at least interesting.\nhttp://imgur.com/a/8Gf4I\n. Plugins will be in the next update! So if anyone wanted to create plugins but wanted to hold off until it's actually in the software, it is now :). There will probably still be lots of modifications but (I think) nothing that should horribly break your code.\nV0.10.0 prerelease: https://github.com/Epix37/HDT-Test/releases/tag/v0.10_PRE1\nI will be adding your (open souce) plugins to a list in the main readme (or wiki?), unless you don't want me to obviously. The tracker's \"available plugins\" link will refer to that, at least for the moment.\nSmall wikl entry on plugin creation: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/Creating-Plugins\n. fixed and uploaded new build\n. At the moment there is no \"out of the box\" way to do this. You can probably make it work using reflection.\nWould exposing the overlay canvas element already be enough? \nEdit: Actually, that already is accessible. Helper.MainWindow.Overlay.CanvasInfo (not sure why it's called CanvasInfo...)\n. FYI: fatigue counters already exist :). See options > overlay > player/opponent. They should show up before the first fatigue draw.\n. I will have to investigate this a bit further, but they should usually be removed from stats again once the games gets back to the main menu. Do they not (consistently)?\n. Alright, pretty sure I got it fixed now.\n. Yea, I was too lazy to fix that here :).\nWill become completely obsolete with the coming changes to replays anyway: #804\n. How about replacing \"import opp deck\" with \"show opp deck\", which open a flyout containing the decklist and an import button? \nNo need for an extra issue, this is fine.\n. I don't think it get's used too much, but seeing the deck before getting booted out of the stats screen is proably a good thing.\n. There we go :)\n\n. Make sure \"TRACKER > AUTO DECK SELECTION\"  is enabled. \n. That's weird. Try replacing it with the one from the latest zip in the\n\"Backups\" folder.\n. Interesting... Do you have any special characters in your path?\n. To your question before: the Hearthstone path is (or should be) usually detected automatically. The button does exactly that for cases with multiple installations or detection issues.\nCan you reproduce the crash consistently by setting the path? Seems to work fine on my end.\n. Ah that makes more sense! I will look into this. Do so have save config/data in appdata disabled?\n. @MyopicCat  could you open an issue for that (so I don't forget)? I will have a look at that. \n. Perfect, thanks. \nAlso: \nHearthstone windowed / fullscreen? \nNote dialog popup after game or when back in menu? \n. Hm... I can't reproduce it.\nNote dialog stays focused for me.\n. Oh they finally fixed fullscreen mode? Awesome. \nThis sounds good :). \n. I guess that happens if someone else wins/loses rank in the mean time.\n. Closing in favor of #2117. Coming soon.\n. fixed, thanks\n. Probably same issue as #819 ? \n. Hm.. works completely fine for me.\n. Most likely #808. The overlay does not update until you click out of hearthstone once. \nTry if this version works: https://github.com/Epix37/HDT-Test/releases/tag/v0.10_PRE1\n. Do you have example URLs that do not work? \n. Ah, yes. I contacted the webmaster a while back about missing ids for the GvG cards, did not yet get a response.\nYou can use the NetDeck Extension if you are using chrome or the NetDeck Bookmarklet with any other browser. (Note: it can not get GvG cards from that website either, but all the classic cards will be imported this way)\n. Got it working now? :) No trouble!\n. No problem!\n. I'm not quite sure I see the necessity. You can see which cards are left in the deck (and hand, optinally) and how many. Whether a card was drawn, played or discarded doesn't really make a difference, does it? It's gone.\nWhat am I missing? \n. You mean when playing in \"no deck\"-mode?\nThough, still.. if the card shows up in the list but is not in your hand (which you can clearly see), you obviously can't play it. \nMaybe turning on \"options > overlay > player > highlight cards in hand\" is already sort of what you are looking for? (just in reverse)\n. I still don't see the value from knowing which cards were discarded and which were not.\nYou have two copies of Flamestike in your deck. With any combination of played/discarded, you both were removed from the deck. You now have no Flamestrikes left. Knowing if one or more of them were discarded adds no value and does not help you decide for a better play. In the current situation of the game you have no Flamestrikes you could draw or play.\nWhat's a scenario where that knowledge would help?\n. See #303\n. Oh I mixed something up in my generator. I was looking for applied machanics (e.g. mark of the wild giving taunt). Thanks for noticing.\nThis should only affect displayed mechanics in replays right? \nOh not even that actually. So this has no effect on anything right now, perfect.\n. Two possibilites: \n1) You have ClearLogFileAfterGame in the config disabled. (I did not test that too much that I can see that being an issue here)\n2) You are starting HDT (multiple times for some reason?) right after you won a ranked/casual game, in which you got your 3/3 wins 10 gold reward.\nI added a check for the latter now.\n. That's somewhere around line 20 in the config. But if you can't remember changing it for a specific reason you probably didn't. \nAh I see. And no, I have not had this happen yet (and I restart it a lot :)) but I managed to reproduce it when I tried to. The next update will fix that.\n. That happend roughly 3 days ago.\nDownload the latest version here\n. options > overlay > general > \"hide in spectator\"\n. Already fixed for the next update! :)\n. I have played around with this here and there, not really happy with it yet.\nStill very much on the todo list though.\n. Good point, I can see that being annoying. Works when removing cards, too, now.\nDisplaying more than 9 as a star is working as intended. Now with Gang Up, that could happen in some cases, but that's not worth investing any time into :). Very very rare case,\n. Too lazy to move your hand a few inches huh? ;)\nImplemented that, plus selecting another game while the flyout is open now loads that deck.\n. Most important question: was is Flame Leviathan?\n. Oh, do you have a replay of this game? You can find the replay files in \"%AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker/Replays\" (Win+R, paste).\n. Please do upload or email me the replay.\n. That doesn't work if you reply to the github email ;).\nepikz37@gmail.com\n. Alright, I excluded created flame leviathans from the information that reaches the tooltips. Thank you for reporting this.\n. Fixed for the next update with dbb8375 :)\n. Try (re)installing .NET 4.5\n. Could you post the full log?\nwww.pastebin.com\n. Ah :) it's the \"}\" in the deckname. \n. Fixed now!\n. The default option being cancel is how those mahapps flyouts work. I read some justification on why that is and it made some sense but I can't recall anything exact. \nHaving an option to disable the dialog is not a bad idea!\n. It never bothered me either, but now it probably ~~will~~ would :D.\nNew option: tracker > exporting > show dialog before exporting\n. Do things like polymorph move minions to REMOVED?\n. If I can come up with a good way to integrate it into the UI (overlay and windows), probably soon. Otherwise not sure. Also open for concepts.\n. @RedHatter that links to your HDT fork. Importing stats from heartharena is not supported. You can manually add games via (with the deck selected) \"stats > deck > games > add game\". \n. Try restarting hearthstone and/or setting the game path via \"options > tracker > settings > set hearthstone path\". \n. All in all pretty good idea an execution.\nFew things though:\n1) \"NEW DECK\" should stay it's own menu item. In general moving it into deck might work, but there's not really any need to do so. Plus when no deck is selected, the \"DECK\" item gets disabled, making it impossible to add decks when do you don't have any. This could obviously be changed but I would prefer the former for now.\n2) All menuitems, etc. should be all upper case\n3) \"CURVE\" does need to have it's own menu item (on that level). I see 3 options: \n3.1) Moving it into options somewhere (not very accessible)\n3.2) Moving it into DECK (not sure)\n3.3) Adding a context menu to the manacurve that lets you pick. I like this one the best by far.\nIn addition the manacurve would need some indicator of what's currently selected. \n. 3.4) (I like this even more) using the same, or a similar, selection the deckpicker uses:\n(mockup)\n\n. 3) you can basically just copy-paste from NewDeckPicker.xaml :). The manacurve in the UI will end up being a bit shorter but that's probably fine.\n. I also wouldn't mind helping out. Just let me know. \n. More or less. Rather than adding new graphs it loads the health / attack values in the current mana curve. \n. I changed it a bit to fit the general style better:\n\n(and implemented some parts in a slightly different way)\nI also tried dynamically changing the mana icon to attack/health but that just looks bad :/.\n. \n\n\nI certainly don't disagree but none of those look any good in my opinion. There's just too much space.\nI don't think the icon on the \"tab\" is necessary, neither does it fit the theme. \nThe other option I see is removing the graphics all together and going with something more \"metro-y\"\n. The numbers on the attack icons are way off-center and I feel like you have to look twice to even realize that those are health icons in the first one. They just look out of place. Not happening :). At least not with those.\nI'll try metro style (gonna post that tomorrow) and/or sleep on just leaving it as mana icons. From the 4 options above it looks by far the best. And since you can clearly see which one is selected it shouldn't be too confusing anyway.\n. This would be the \"clean\" alternative:\n\nIdk, the longer I look at it the more I like it. Fits the new selection above I guess.\nEdit: matching the deck picker a little better:\n\n. Turns out, the opponent name actually is \"The Innkeeper\" in those games. At least according to the log.\nFixed both those issues now though.\n. TRACKER > SORT/FILTER > Sort decks by: ... :)\n. 1) Why a new entity? Arena decks are exactly that. And clicking on \"STATS\" gives you all games of that run. The only thing currently missing is rewards.\n2) Kinda falls in the same category as 1, you can already fully edit arena decks. \nAm I missing something obvious?\n3) Should happen, yes.\n. I added recording of gold and dust rewards now. Not sure how to represent them in stats yet, but it's a start.\nIs 2) all that necessary? I would argue the case that you need to move all your arena games to a deck is not that common, plus if you do, you can just create the deck first, then move all games there.\n. I actually have the same issue at the moment, too.\n. Okay.. I have no idea. \n- Renamed old config, new one was generated. Works.\n- Generate diff, check each setting. Still works.\n- Restore old config, works...\nSo: Go to \"%AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker\", rename/delete the config.xml, start HDT and try exporting.\n. Closing in favor of #303\n. Try closing HDT and then deleting the config.xml in \"%AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker\"  (win + R, paste). \n. Great! :) \n. Saving via Enter from the name textbox makes sense too actually (no need for ctrl here imo). I'll try to implement both of those.\n. Try setting the patch via options > tracker > settings > set hearthstone path\n. Hm.\nTry manually editing the config: \"%AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker\" (Win+R, paste), open \"config.xml\" and set <HearthstoneDirectory>C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Hearthstone</HearthstoneDirectory> to the correct path. Without HDT running.\n. You can open it with any text editor. \n. The path of your hearthstone installation.\n. Did you close HDT before editing the config?\n. Did you try setting the path via options > tracker > settings > set hearthstone path?\nAlso see if starting HDT as admin has any effect. If neither works and it doesn't, I don't know what the problem could be :/.\n. Very strange. Glad you could make it work though!\n. Might be fixed for v0.10, iirc.\nPrerelease: https://github.com/Epix37/HDT-Test/releases\n. I should have probably mentioned that you need to re-download the deck. Make sure you have \"hearthstats > auto delete decks\" turned off, or delete the \"playerdecks.xml\" and \"deckstats.xml\" in \"%AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker\" (Win+R, paste) to delete everything locally.\n. I tried up and downloading a deck with 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 3.0 earlier, no issues. Maybe the probem is with the deck on hearthstats, upload might have been bad.\n. OH, were all the decks with this issue created on hearthstats? That makes a lot more sense now. I will have a look at that.\n. :).\nThis issue is fixed for the next update. Minor problem will be, that if you have 1.0, 1.1, 1.0 and sync, it will add 2.0 to the end, not replacing the 2nd 1.0. There's not much I can do about that (I think). It will work as expected though, if the deck is synced \"from scratch\".\n. Could be a problem with old decks on hearthstats? I just created created 3 new decks with multiple versions, synced, all there, modified all of them, all changes synced.\nCould you upload the log from you trying to full sync? You can find the log in \"%AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker/Logs\". www.pastebin.com\n. Don't worry :).\nThe logs actually do help a lot though. Could you link me two or three of the decks that have missing versions (hearthstats)? \n. A few things were fixed on the server side (I think those are live by now). Try if the syncing works for you now. \n. That crash should be fixed with v0.10.1\n. I'm slightly shocked I didn't have those already, lol. Thanks :).\n. Maybe loatheb was played/discarded, too? I can't see this hapening otherwise,\n. You need to download \"Hearthstone.Deck.Tracker-vX.X.X.zip\" under Releases.\n. One very unlikely thing i can think of: HDT enables Hearthstone logging. Maybe, for some reason your machine can not handle that? I have never heard anyone having that issue before, but who knows. Close Hearthstone, go to \"%LocalAppData%/Blizzard/Hearthstone\" and delete the \"log.config\" file (I would recommend not touching any of the others in there). See if the problems persists.\n. Idk, I did not really expect that to help. Possibly a too slow HDD?\nGood thing it's working again though. Enjoy your smoothly running game :).\n. Those cards should be removed usually. Apparently they are not (always)? Huh..\n. The log, the replay of that game (%AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker/Replays) and a screenshot of the displayed cards would probably help, yea!\n. Perfect, thanks. I'll have a look tomorrow.\n. Are your games still there? (stats > games)\nIf so, this is probably just a filter thing. See if changing the settings in \"options > tracker > stats > display\" makes any stats show up.\n. > Are your games still there? (stats > games)\n\nIf so, this is probably just a filter thing. See if changing the settings in \"options > tracker > stats > display\" makes any stats show up.\n. I thing you can try: restore your backup, delete the config.xml, start v0.9.10. Are the stats still gone?\n\nIf so, please do upload your backup,  yea.\n. I don't quite understand why, or what is happening how this is how it worked for me:\n1) Restore backup, delete config.xml\n2) Run v0.9.5 (no stats there at this point)\n3) Wait for it to automatically restart, stats are now all there\n4) Close v0.9.5, run v0.9.10. Stats are still all there.\n. see #692 and #799. Stats screen rework and after/with that. more filters, is coming. Possibly already with v0.10.0 (next release).\n2) you can filter both already\n. For the time being, may I suggest NetDeck ? :)\n. You have to enter the arena screen (or create the deck) and then go back to the main menu. The next update will behave a bit differently.\n. Should be working now (v0.10.9)\n. Yea... this one... used to happen with all the card lists, I still don't really know why it is/was happening.\n. See #303 :).\n. Thanks :).\n. No it wasn't and there's more involved than just moving the button.\n. I agree a new tab isn't really necessary here. Tags should do it perfectly fine (you can create new tags via DECK > EDIT TAGS). \nDisplaying the missing cards after exporting should work with the next update properly agian, too.\nAs for dust cost, that's something that would probably look decent in the (new) deck stats somewhere. Adding the new sorting filters shouldn't be much of a problem either.\n. Isn't that what we are talking about? That's what I was talking about anyway.\n. Not how I understood it, but that's what I plan on doing, yea. \nThe (now fixed) exporting shows the missing cards and their cost already anyway.\n. #859 would allow you to hide the over easily at any given time. \n. Any chance restarting hearthstone and your machine helps? Maybe try updating .Net framework... Not really sure what might cause this. \n. great!\n. Are you using a proxy by any chance? Apparently this can happen with proxys that don't support \"100-continue\".\nTry adding a new file to the HDT folder, called \"Hearthstone Deck Tracker.exe.config\" and paste this into it: \nXML\n<configuration>\n    <system.net>\n        <settings>\n            <servicePointManager expect100Continue=\"false\" />\n        </settings>\n    </system.net>\n</configuration>\nRestart HDT, see if you still have that problem.\n. Most likely the path to your hearthstone installation is incorrect (for whatever reason).\nTry setting it via options > tracker > settings > set hearthstone path. (I've heard a few times now that this does not work for some reason - alternaitve: go to %AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker, open the config.xml and set <HearthstoneDirectory>...</HearthstoneDirectory> to the correct path.\n. Try this then:\n- close HDT and hearthstone\n- copy the log.config from [HDT]/Files to \"%LocalAppData%/Blizzard/Hearthstone\"\n- Start both again, see if it works\n- if no: check if you find a \"output_log.txt\" in \"Hearthstone/Hearthston_Data\" and if so, if it contains any lines starting with \"[Power]\"\n. The log says playing against druid :).\nBut this tells me replacing the \"log.config\" should do the trick!\n. Hmm, maybe \"dont reset decks after a game\" is checked in options > overlay > general? Either way it should happen when a new game starts.\n. Yea the timer is a bit wonky.. Turns are not actually 90 seconds either though, but 70 seconds plus the animation delay up to a maximum of another 20 seconds :).\n. Try reinstalling .NET Framework 4.5.\n. great :)\n. Thanks @GiggliG \n. You have to create / import a deck in the main UI and select it. \n. [1:39:38 PM] Helper: Current version: 0.9.10.0 \nDoes this still happen with the latest update ? \n. Thanks for the clarification. Will most likely be fixed with v0.10.1 this weekend (or earlier if a more severe issue shows up). \n. Looks like that should do it, yes. Thanks! \n. All the names will now be automatically fixed with the next update, if the game has a replay attached.\n. fixed with v0.10.1\n. You can find the hearthstats menu under \"plugins\"  now. Even though it's not actually a plug-in, I'm running out of space in the menu bar :). \n. See #919.\n. Possibly a problem with the hearthstats servers? Not sure...\nCould you try again and after upload the log, found in \"%AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker/Logs\"? (WIn+R, paste)\n. How does that work? Doesn't the syncing have to complete for you to have the other issue?\nAlso, please do post a log for this issue.\n. This (at least in your case) seems to be the same problem causing it as in #884.\n. Updated to 1.1.2.0 now for next release.\n. Possibly #924?\nOtherwise try reinstalling .Net 4.5 maybe? That fixes way too many problems. \n. So OnLoad works fine and OnUpdate causes the crash? What are you doing in that method?\n. Oh, I think I know what this could be. \nTry setting the buildpath to something else and just copy your created .dll e.g. via the postbuild event to the plugins directory. \n. So I tracked down the issue: the crash happens in the PluginManager update method, if and only if the System.Windows.Interactivity.dll is in the Plugins directory.\nNo idea what to make of that though.\n. I think you could keep the buildpath set to Plugins, and then just delete the System.Windows.Interactivity.dll in postbuild.\n. There's a better solution actually: \nIn the reference properties set \"Copy Local\" to \"False\".\nYou can do that for System.Windows.Interactivity, as well as HDT and any other you might add.\n. This is how I get that kind of information in replays. But I agree, having those as entity properties would be handy. \nYou might also want to check out the debug window, found via \"options > tracker > logging (turn on in settings) > debugwindow\"\nThis should be easier actually:\npublic bool IsMinion\n{\n    get { return HasTag(GAME_TAG.CARDTYPE) && GetTag(GAME_TAG.CARDTYPE) == (int)TAG_CARDTYPE.MINION; }\n}\n. I added a few properties now (see c058cd9).\nIsOpponent,\nIsMinion,\nIsWeapon,\nIsInHand,\nIsInPlay,\nIsInGraveyard,\nIsInZone(zone)\nIsControlledBy(id)\nTAG_CARDTYPE.SPELL does apparently not exist, and since my game won't start at the moment apparently, I'm not sure how to deduce that. So IsSpell is missing for now.\nSuggestions for any others?\n. fixed, thanks\n. Cards are searched as \"[cardname] [artistname]\". Stalagg and Feugen are done by the same artist, Ragnaros and Majordomo are not, should be no problem.\n. Since you get the golden version of charge pretty early on (level 23 and 26), and charge is the first card in the list, this is probably likely not a problem for most people.\nBut yea.. might have to add the cardtype/rarity to the search again in some cases. Or just for all cards by default?\n. See my response in #932. This is a very unlikely problem.\n(Duplicate and mirror image, again, have different artists)\nIf you are aware of any specific cases, I would be happy to fix them.\n. Nothing specifically. I just worried doing this may have sideeffects I didn't see. Everything seems to be fine though.\n. Try restarting hearthstone and/or entering the \"Play\" screen once before starting the importing process.\nEdit: Also, try manually copying and overwriting the \"log.config\" from [HDT]/Files to \"%LocalAppData%/Blizzard/Hearthstone\". Restart Hearthstone after.\n. Do you have golden versions of stalagg / feugen? You need to specify that in \"options > tracker > exporting\". The artist name should not cause any trouble.\nWhat exactly do mean mean \"trouble finding burly rockjaw trogg\"?\nI guess that depends on the game resolution you set. You can also adjust the scaling / opacity of the card lists via \"options > overlay > player/opponent\".\n. Was fixed just today with #931 :).\n. should be fixed with v0.10.1\n. That is basically the entire log. Nothing about arena drafts/rewards, etc. is logged.\n. Huh, rewards actually are. TIL. I'm pretty sure that's it though.\nAs far as I know there is no way to track anything other than the selected class when it comes to arena.\n. There is indeed a way to manually fix it:\nopen \"[HDT]/Files/cardDB.enUS.xml\" and change the <Artist> in line 14540 (or just search \"burly\").\n. Fixed now. Seems like the artist was changed by a recent patch.\n. Why would you not search for the artist? It solves a lot of problems.\nI don't think Blizzard changing artist names is going to be something happening on a regular basiss.\n. see #919\n. Sorry, I have no idea what you mean. Could you elaborate a bit on what's not working and what you are trying to do / expect to happen?\n. Maybe asset unloading works differntly on some machines. Instead of just going back to the main menu, try clicking the \"play\" button and import.\nYou may also have to leave and reenter the arena once before starting the importing process (going back to the main menu and clicking import).\n. Very weird, but I guess if it works that way...\n. Fixed with 0012166. \nThe -1 bug... To be completely honest it's probably gonna stay like that for a while. Not very high up on the priority list and requires most likely a decent amount of work to figure out.\n. I guess the easier solution would be to have arena decks not affected by the selected mode at all. Doesn't make much sense anyway.\n. I tried OCR in the past but did not have too much success with it. \nI'm sure it's possible though. Reading the name plus the manacost of the card should end up being pretty error resistant. I would guess that'w how arenavalue does it. \nThe logs contain nothing about arena drafts and the only other ways I can think of for doing this would be TCP or memory. Neither of which are a good idea.\nHaving HearthArena integrated into thiss would be amazing.\n. Hey!\nWebsite says 502, but yes I would love to! As a plugin or directly in the software how ever you prefer. Feel free to email me if you want to talk in more detail: epikz37@gmail.com\n. And then there was this: https://github.com/rembound/Arena-Helper\n. Closing in favor of #2110.\n. Try reinstalling .NET 4.5 again or repairing it.\n. Shouldn't be the problem, no.\n~~Try this maybe: http://www.personalcomputerfixes.com/general-errors/how-to-fix-clr20r3-error/~~\n. I think the link above is specific to other software, sorry. Possibly try downloading a fresh copy of HDT? Or maybe installing an older version of .NET might work, who knows,\n. Added error notifications\n\n. I could see an argument both ways, but I think updating the names makes sense.\nNow, doing this with arena decks seems to work perfectly fine, constructed seems to require restarting HDT for it to take effect but that shouldn't be too big of a deal.\n. You can sort via TRACKER > SORT / FILTER. That always keeps the class order though. \nSplitting that and/or allowing more freedom might be a good idea.\n. Also already exists. \nI added an option to disable the forced class sorting:\n\nThis is across all tabs, but should do the trick. (and mainly: was quick to implement :))\n. You hold CTRL and then select \"ALL\" and the archived icon in the class bar. \nI thought about adding \"last used\", too. Might make it into the next version, not sure yet.\n. You can set what stats to display (all, selected version, selected major, ...) in options > tracker > stats > display, making this redundant if \"all\" is selected.\n. Might be somehow possible with a plugin, but I wouldn't know how.\nA plugin that switches Config.DisplayedStats while a key is pressed could work.\n. Yea you can manually add games: Select your deck, click \"STATS\" in the menu bar: Deck > Games > add new game\n. - Try restarting HDT and Hearthstone\n- Make sure <HearthstoneDirectory>...</HearthstoneDirectory> in the config.xml in \"%AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker\" (Win+R, paste) is set to the correct path\n- Copy the \"log.config\" from \"[HDT]/Files\" to \"%LocalAppData%/Blizzard/Hearthstone\" and overwrite the existing one\n. Then redownload the latest version again here: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/releases, and extract/overwrite everything. \n. Do those games have replays?\n. Very stange.

Stolen cards get marked as \"created\" now, should be fixed.\n. And this only happens when HDT is running?\nTry maybe updating the graphics card drivers.\n. The problem with setting the active deck via context menu or doubleclick (which currently open edit, I don't like changing that), is that it's not at all intuitive. Someone who never used the the app would probably have difficulty trying to figure out how it works. An obvious \"use this one\"-button is a lot clearer. \nFor the indicator I was thinking about something that's visible regardless of how the decklist is filtered/scrolled. A indicator similar to the notes one adds nothing new (it's bold already).\n. Sneak peek of where this is at right now:\n\nWorking on ironing out the last bugs caused by this change (and finding a place for tags).\nAlso comes with performance improvements for large numbers of decks!\nDoubleclicking on the \"active deck\" bar at the bottom will select the active deck and bring it into view.\nI will be releasing this as a beta update soon (probably this weekend) make sure you have options > tracker > settings > check for beta updates enabled if you want to help me test :). (I would appreciate it!)\nEdit: I will also be adding an option to choose between the current icons, the new ones seen above and the hearthstats ones.\n. Adding use deck to the context menu and being able to set the double-click actions are good ideas (any actions other than edit and use?). \nHaving an option to color the backgrounds should be easy to add, changing the layout maybe not so much. I will look into it but no promises. Plus \"I like the old better\" often happens with new things :). Might grow on you! \nAny ideas on how do display tags with this layout?  Adding the full list next to the stats does not look too good. There is probably some elegant solution.\n. Further work in progress. Those tags aren't too bad right?\n\nTo adress some of the things:\n- I would argue the numbers are \"difficult to see\" because you are used to looking for them on the right. This way it might even be easier to see which stats belong to which deck, especially if you have multiple decks of the same class (color) next to eachother.\n- The first screenshot was a bad example for the note. The N's are always bold, making them a bit easier to spot. While I still agree it's easier to see at a glance that, in your screenshot, exactly 6 decks have notes, when do you ever need that information? Whether or not a specific deck has a note is not harder to see at all imo.\n- Main reason for the use button on each deck: You can still activate a deck with a single click. Also it's immediately clear what you need to do in order for a deck to be \"active\".\n. I like using your decks for testing :P.\nNow possible to: \n- Choose between the layout form above and this one.\n- Choose between icon sets\nAlso added an acutal icon for notes. I think this solves the visibility issue?\n\nEdit: vertically centered the note icon (relative to the name) now, looks a bit better.\n. Released as beta update.\nIf you don't have the option checked: you can download here for testing\n. Added a \"legacy layout\" option:\n\n(active deck: bold, selected deck: semibold)\nI think this is a decent compromise. Any combination of removing the icon and centering text, with the use button still included just looks weird. Removing the use button is not an option, since I am the one who will otherwise be getting messages saying \"selecting decks does not work, pls fix\". And it really is just not intuitive.\n. I found that, with both selections being at the top, them having a gray background looks a bit odd, especially with the dark base theme.\nMaking the \"control backgrounds\" adjustable it not a totally bad idea, but adding it to the \"legacy deck layout\" optons is not the way to go. A separate option for it in the future is certainly a possibility but I would like to keep it like this for now. Having the light and dark base themes, means things have to adjust while backgrounds are transparent, but not when they are static gray. I don't feel like dealing with that right now :P.\nMaking the labels and use/active text black looks way too cluttered in my opinion:\n\nHighlighting the active should not be necessary I think, you can see the active deck at the bottom anyway.\n. If any of those are really still a problem in say, one to two weeks, we can talk about it. For now it's gonna stay this way.\nI did not implement doubleclick > activate or rightclick > use because they are completely redundant with the \"use\" button on each deck.\n. Feel free to leave more feedback (please do) but as I said, I'm gonna leave it like this for a week or two and we can pick it up then.\n@GiggliG Jump to active deck is there, doubleclicking though :).\n. See my post in #979 (work in progress).\n. Should be fine after just restarting hearthstone.\n. Ah, so you are getting the warning because you are deliberately using a deck that does not contain the cards you are playing?\nNot sure if removing the warning is the way to go (I would rather eventually fix bugs that cause it when not intended). Use the \"no deck mode\" might be the way to go in your case though.\n. There have not been any changes to the overlay in quite a while, did you maybe change something on your end? Hardware, drivers, etc?\n. Also see here: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/FAQ#why-is-my-game-so-choppy--fps-so-low-after-using-hdt\n. Haven't heard anything about it in a long time. Gonna close for now.\n. Try (re)installing .NET Framework 4.5\n. Probably doesn't make much sense for constructed, but see #946 for the arena part.\n. The decks are actually colored according to this: http://www.wowwiki.com/Class_colors\nAlso, the cards should usually give it away.\n. Fair point. It should be pretty easy to get used to the class colors though. \nAlso, if you have \"auto deck selection\" under the \"tracker\" menu point enabled, it will automatically switch to the deck you are currently using in-game (if saved in HDT).\n. - Casual or friend?\n- What did you do after he quit?

(Or try turning the overlay off in the options)\n2) Your harddrive might be too slow  to handle all the data logged by Hearthstone.

To that is added some, so called SLUSH, which ranges from 0 to at least 24 seconds depending on the animations playing out (as you correctly stated) and possibly some other factors I am not sure about.

To that is added some, so called SLUSH, which ranges from 0 to at least 24 seconds depending on the animations playing out (as you correctly stated) and possibly some other factors I am not sure about.

If I had the issue myself I might be able to find something, but this way around makes that impossible. \nAs far as I know this does happen without HDT running, right?

Probably the issue.\n. Probably some temporary server issues? I guess this is no longer relevant. \nFor the window: you can turn it off via options > tracker > settings > show login dialog.\n. most likely fixed with v0.11\n. The whole \"use\" thing needs some serious clarification... \nFor now I added a hint that hopefully helps with this at least a little bit.\n\n. Try rerunning the setup: options > importing > set up constructed importing.\n. That happens if HDT is closed while (re)writing the xml. Due to the OS shutting down or some other reason. Extactly for that reason the backups were added. Not sure what to do about it though - other than moving away from xml.\nThe config is now included in the backup aswell.\n. This should make things a bit easier in the future:\n\n. Yea, the whole arena syncing is still a bit of a temporary solution. Should be fixed some time in the future.\n. You could try reinstalling .NET 4.5 and DirectX. \n. Try (re)installing .NET Framework 4.5\n. The restarting crash is definitely an issue, but for HDT to track your deck you have to manually create the deck in HDT or import im from the game via the IMPORT > FROM GAME menu item.\n. I may have fixed the crash now. \nTry\na) manually restarting HDT after changing the path \nand/or \nb) manually setting it as described here: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker#faq (Win+R - paste \"%AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker\")\n. The hearthstone folder. It should look something like this: \n<HearthstoneDirectory>C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Hearthstone</HearthstoneDirectory>\n. That should still be there. It's the folder that also contains the \"Hearthstone Deck Tracker.exe\" - the one you downloaded & extracted, not the %AppData% one.\n. The method HDT uses to import decks has it's limits. The major one being that it can only detect what   cards are in a deck, not how many. Whether all the cards are added with 1 or 2 copies depends on which way around the total number of cards is closer to 30 such that it takes the least clicks to correct it. A deck with 17 different cards will have them set at 2 because 34 is closer to 30 than 17. \nNot sure about the random cards. You could try restarting HS and then re-running the setup process via options > tracker > importing > set up constructed importing.\n. Good idea.\nMight have to look into what gives a better value here, average or median.\n. Alternatively it might be somewhere \"off screen\" for some reason. See if you can alt-tab to the HDT window and if so, press \"Win+LeftArrow\" until you see it.\n. Alternatively you can do the same by rightclicking the tray icon.\n. Is this still an issue with v0.14?\n. :+1:\n. Try (re)installing .NET Framework 4.5\n. OBS can't capture transparent windows as far as I know. \nThere a two workarounds currently: \n1) You can use monitor capture to just capture game+overlay\n2) Enable options > overlay > deck windows, you can capture those\n. Oh if you could make that into a PR, that would be awesome! :)\n. A plugin is a even better solution, yea! The options item is neat :D.\nLet me know if you need help with anything!\n. Awesome!\nAs far as I can see, MahApps is up to date. Their latest release (github and nuget) was 1.1.2 on march 1st.\n. finally found and fixed this problem!\n. You are in the \"overall\" selection. Select \"Deck\" in the top left and it will re-appear :).\n. Well, \"overall\" contains games from all decks. You can access that without having a deck selected, meaning HDT wouldn't know which deck to add the game to at that point. That's why the button is only in the deck section.\nI admit it's not the most elegant of solutions. I still plan on improving the whole stats screen in the future.\n. Makes sense, thanks. \nUh.. yea.. I meant to fix the tests :X.\n. I am not able to reproduce this. \nCould you upload your config.xml (found in %AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker\" - Win+R, paste) somewhere? (please don't just post it as raw text here :))\nAnd secondly link the deck you were importing?\n. Probably related to #1162? If so, that might very well be fixed with the next update.\n. Please let me know if you still have these issues with the latest pre-release: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/releases/tag/v0.10.8\n. Hmm... Try lowering the speed in options > tracker > exporting, see if that helps.\n. 0 mana files are always bad! :)\nFix now, thank you.\n. Good idea. Added that.\n. Try this:\n- Restart Hearthstone\n- Re-run the importing setup: options > tracker > importing > set up constructed importing\n- Restart Hearthstone again\n- Try importing again (make sure you follow the instructions; options > tracker > importing > show constructed importing how-to)\n.

You can download the pre release for that here: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/releases/tag/v0.10.8\n. I love it!\n. Yes please :). I would say start with the overlay. Other than that, go crazy.\n. Hey,\nmake sure you actually have a deck set as \"active\".\nSee here for more detail: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/FAQ\nit's definitely a bit unintuitive in the current release. The next update should hopefully make is a bit clearer.\nYour games so far have been recorded to a \"default deck\". You can move them to the correct one via Games & Statistics > (Overall >) Games > *select all that belong to one deck* > move to other deck\n. Great :)\n. One last straw I can think of is that you might possibly have multiple Hearthstone installations? Make sure the one you point to is the one actually in use.\nOtherwise please do the following: \n- Close and Restart HDT and Hearthstone\n- Play a game (conceding a AI match is fine)\n- Upload the hdt_log.txt found in %AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker/Logs to pastebin and post the link to that here.\n. This looks like it might actually help! \nThe problem is right here: Could not find a part of the path 'C:\\Hearthstone_Data\\output_log.txt' - that's obviously not the correct path. \nEither HearthstoneDirectory in the config is for some reason set to only \"C:\\\" or maybe it contains some invalid characters?\nTry this: Close HDT, delete the config.xml, check if it works. If not, try setting the path again. If it still does not work please upload your config.xml to pastebin, maybe there's something weird going on.\n. Great! No problem!\n. When you close HDT, your FPS are back to normal right? Try enabling/disabling windows aero.\n. Will be fixed with the coming update.\n. Have a look at this: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/303#issuecomment-56195879\nThe important bit:\nThere is a pretty easy workaround. \nFind hearthstone.exe in C:\\Program Files (x86), right click, \nand select Properties. Then go to the Compatibility tab. \nCheck the box for \"Run this program in compatability mode for\" \nand select Windows 7. Then restart Hearthstone.\n(I'm gonna add that to the FAQ)\n. No worries, it's pretty deep in there :).\n. Same issue as #1226 (fixed)\n. Constructed importing is too unreliable for this to work.\n. The main reason to separate select and use is that this enables you to look at other decks during games (and without iterating though the log everytime you click on another deck). \nWith auto select working again since this update, you should usually not have the wrong deck active, even if you forget to click \"use\". Have you tried this since the update? (MAIN > AUTO DECK SELECTION). \n. Nevertheless, I added an option for this now since it seemed pretty straight forward to implement. Will need some testing though... might break a few things here and there when enabled.\n. That's exactly how the detection works, yea. As soon as you draw a card that's not in the deck it will trigger. If you are often switching between very similar decks of the same class that would obviously be the same problem still.\n. I guess this made it out quick. Had to release a crash fix, so this made it in :).\nLet me know if you find any issues with it.\n. Always something you miss... I'll probably get an update out tomorrow that fixes this. \nThanks for letting me know.\n. fixed with v0.10.10\n. Is this the case with every game or just the one you posted the log of?\n. Sadly not possible to attach files in github replies via email.\nI wouldn't worry about it for now though, probably just the oddball-game. Let me know if it happens again and I'll look into it!\n. Try redownloading it here: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/releases\nand extract it to a new folder. The zip definitely contains the exe, I doublechecked :).\nMaybe this is some antivirus problem?\n. The probem is that the overlay is showing when you have something other than hearthstone in foreground, right?\nYou can fix that by enabling options > overlay > general > hide if HS in background.\n. No problem :). Let me know if you have any more questions!\nAnd while we're at it, let me point you to the FAQ and Overlay sections in the wiki.\n. Could you upload the log, the next time that happens?\nSee here on where to find and upload the log\n. That's how I get you to update ;).\nSerious though, I can't seem to reproduce that issue. Lowering the version in the config.xml will get you the message, maybe you can.\n. Sorry, I meant the version.xml in the application folder, not the config. I'm too used to writing \"config.xml\", lol.\n. Since the decks have never been played, this is arguably the way \"last played\" should be sorted. (Also see #1009)\nI will look into adding an option that allows the old behaviour.\n. Currently you can't. I will look into that.\nHovering over the deck name will give you the full name in a tooltip though.\n. Things for TGT will be fixed as soon as possible. \nFor this there is a temporary, manual workaround: \n- options > tracker > settings > open appdata folder\n- close HDT\n- open config.xml with text editor\n- find this line <ExportAllSetsButtonY>0.639</ExportAllSetsButtonY> (~72)\n- change the value to 0.607\n- save & close\n- start HDT again, happy exporting!\n. Should be fine with v0.10.11\n. See #1253. Yes stuff is broken right now.\n. Working on it!\n. v0.10.11 should fix most issues.\n. v0.10.11 should fix most issues.\n. I actually need feedback asap on these, that's why I'm not releasing them as beta updates.\nHere is a new one that now also fixed Gangup and probably similar mechanics. These similar mechanics is what needs testing now. Things that put stuff in decks. Malorne, etc. \nOther than that I can't think of something specific right now. Play around with it, see if you notice anything.\nHere is the new download: http://www.mediafire.com/download/hucc7g0g002iojh/Hearthstone_Deck_Tracker-TGT-fixes_2.zip\n. only have an EU account sadly :/\n. this one should fix recycle and malorne (which were not a new problem since tgt):\nhttps://github.com/Epix37/HDT-Test/releases/tag/v0.10.TGT4\nShould be the final test release\n. Not sure yet. but something along those lines, yes.\nReleased the update. Thanks guys!\n. Seems to work fine for me. \nWhat I did:\n- Edit deck\n- Make changes, save as new version\nResult:\n- Deck set to newest version\n- Deck was set to active and selected\n- Overlay also shows new version\n. Working on it!\n. v0.10.11 should fix most issues.\n. Try updating to v0.10.11 and see if you still have the issue.\nIf so, try this: Close Hearthstone and HDT, go to [Your Hearthstone Folder]/Hearthstone_Dataand delete the output_log.txt. Then try again.\n. The only other thing I can think of right now that has sometimes an impact on performance is turning on/off windows aero. Maybe try that too. \n. the TGT update broke a lot of things. Just release an update that should fix most (if not all) of it.\n. Todays hearthstone update messed a lot of things up. v0.10.11 was released a few minutes ago and should fix most (if not all) of the issues.\n. 10/10 !\n. See #471.\nIt's planned eventuall but there is no ETA. Things keep changing and having to sort out over 10 translations ever time is not really the way to go. (Plus it's a huge amount of work to even integrate)\nI did add you to the list in the linked issue though. I'll let you know when the time comes :).\n. There is a hand and deck counter beneath the card lists.\n. I mean in the overlay, right underneath the list of cards HDT adds, there are also the counters. \n. Do you have any filters set (MAIN - QUICK FILTER -  ALL)  or the mode filter at the top of the deck picker set to constructed? \n. Lets try this then: \n- Go to options > tracker > backups\n- Create new\n- Show backup folder\n- Email the one that's called something like \"BackupManual_17082015\" to epikz37@gmail.com\nMaybe I can see what's going on.\n. Temporary server issues. should be back soon. Click \"continue as guest\"  for now. \n. Try restarting Hearthstone, maybe that's enough already. if not, give this a shot: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/FAQ#not-working\n. HearthStats was/is having some server issues, might be related to that? Should be fixed soon.\n. Okay, I see. I have not tested anything multi-instance in a very long time. Gonna check it out!\n. That's a differnet problem then. \nIf the FPS only drop while HDT is running then it's some likely something that can be fixed (Aero).\nIf the game is laggy after using HDT, no matter if HDT is running or not, means it's the log file. This one there is nothing we can do about. As you said, removing the log.config, is the only way.\n. The file causing this is the output_log.txt found in Hearthstone/Hearthstone_Data. Installing Hearthstone somewhere else would be the way of moving it.\n(The log.config makes it so Hearthstone generates the output_log)\n. It's not any perticular features that is causing this, it is the fact that hearthstone debug logging is turned on (which HDT is completely based on).\n. lots of redundant logging was added\n. The ones having problems: what graphics cards are you using?\n. Give this a shot: https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/3hjxg0/does_anyone_experience_problems_with_windows_10/cuafv6n?context=3\n. Maybe try also excluding \"... /Hearthstone/Hearthstone_Data\" \n. Probably just a weird coincidence we found,  but who knows. \n. Probably, yes. \nBut if you have the same issues without HDT running changing the buffer size will not do anything for you. And from what I understands that's the case for most?\n. Not yet. I will add that and upload a build for you guys to test tomorrow.\n. Also I need someone with the lag issues to try this: \n- open log.config in %LocalAppData%/Blizzard/Hearthstone\n- for all the logging namespaces:  set ConsolePrintingto false and FilePrinting to true\n- restart hearthstone and see if you still have the problems (HDT will not work)\n(!!even if you have no problems, this might not actually be the solution!!)\n. ConsolePrinting creates the Hearthstone_Data/output_out.txt and %LocalAppDaat%/Blizzard/Hearthstone/Logs/hearthstone_*.log files, while FilePrinting creates separate logfiles for each namespace in Hearthstone/Logs.\n. Implemented the new logger! \nGive this version a try: https://github.com/Epix37/HDT-Test/releases/tag/v0.10.18PRE2\nIt will automatically disable ConsolePrinting and enable FilePrinting.\n(if you go back to an old HDT version, you have to edit or delete the log.config)\nAlso very likely that there are still some bugs. \n. Pretty much, yes. The logs created by ConsolePrinting contain a lot of clutter and are written in duplicate. \nPlease play with that version a bit and see if you notice any problems. Things like draws/plays not being registered or it not resetting when it's supposed to, etc. \n. Now released as beta update v0.10.18\n. It seems the Power.log reader just stopped working while the rest of them continued on fine. Not sure what to make of that yet.\nEdit: if nothing else works, one possibility could be to monitor the size of the logfiles and if it changes without a logreader getting any new data, restart them.\n. - Fixed the LogReader issue with v0.10.19 (77705c5)\n- Fixed the deck count issue. Not in v0.10.19.\n. @BobT36 Yea I think I messed that up with the new LogReader, gonna fix it today\n@dvide I was able to reproduce it by setting the hearthstone client to chinese (card names are in the set language)\n. You think it's stable enough for an actual release? I'm hesitant but I can't think of anything or find anything broken (related to the changes).\n. The chances of finding that are probably pretty slim, so best way might be to just release it. I've been trying to break it for about half an hour now with different HS languages, rapidly switching decks with auto selection on (at the start/end/middle of games...), no issues. UpdateDelay at 10ms and 2000ms seem to work fine so that's probably a good sign. \nGonna play a few more games and then push it I think.\n.

Fixed for the next update with 544331a\n. That's actually a bug in hearthstone at the moment as far as I know. Currently there is no way to make this work again.\n. What exactly do you mean by reset stats? Delete all recorded games? Delete all decks? both?\nDeleting games:\n- STATS > STATISTICS & GAMES > Overall > Games\n- Set all filters to \"All\"\n- Select any game in the list, press ctrl + A\n- Click DELETE at the bottom\nDeleting decks (also deletes games)\n- Make sure all decks are visible\n  - MAIN > QUICK FILTER > ALL\n  - Select ALL in both bars above the deck picker\n- Select all decks (select a single one, ctrl+A)\n- Rightclick > delete\n. Creating a new version of a deck (edit > SAVE > v1.1) will also visually reset the stats in the deck picker. By default only stats for the selected version are displayed. This way can keep your old stats, too.\nIf you already deleted all games but like this solution better you can restore a backup via options > tracker > backups - select the latest and click restore selected.\n. Is it actually in the deck you created in HDT? You can edit the deck by doubleclicking it or rightclick > edit deck. \n. Hey,\nthe easiest solution could be simply restarting hearthstone.\nIf that does not help, try this: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/FAQ#not-working\n. no problem!\n. It is in there\n. See here: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/FAQ#how-can-i-add-games-manually\n. no worries :)\n. From googling around a bit it seems like it's some misconfiguration on your end that's causing this.\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/21835891/process-starturl-fails#comment33051080_21835891\nMaybe try changing your default browser and see if that does anything.\n. Might even work if you change it back now. Good to know that that works though :).\n. Could be related to the server issues that are going on :/.\nThe easiest should be to just delete the 0-1 run on hearthstats and manually add one to the other one.\n. Sounds like this might be your problem: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/FAQ#exporting-is-not-working-properly--missing-cards\n. no problem!\n. Manually selecting \"no deck\"? MAIN > USE NO DECK or \"systemtrayicon\" > use no deck\n. Why blizzard why,,,\n. #1031 \n. Deduction. Cards are entities and have two kinds of ids: a cardId (identifies which card it is) and an entityId that's unique in each game. If the opponent draws and mulligans a card with entityId 5, you don't know what that card is at that point but as soon as the plays it you can deduce that he mulliganed that card.\n. Any immediate changes coming or shall I merge?\n. I seem to be able to create any number of versions in HDT. I assume the problem is syncing version > 10 from hearthstats to HDT?\n. Will be fixed with the next update (probably monday).\n. See #548.\nShould come eventually!\nWhat you can do now: Enable options > overlay > interactivity to manually grey out secrets by clicking on them.\n. Did you update to v0.10.11? (https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/releases)\n. - options > tracker > settings > open appdata folder\n- close hdt\n- open config.xml with any text editor\n- make sure ExportAllSetsButtonY is set to this value: <ExportAllSetsButtonY>0.607</ExportAllSetsButtonY>\n. Uuhmm... #103 was the same issue I think. Doesn't seem like we actually found a solution.\nTry updating your video card drivers.\n. It's using WPF.\n. No animations there. I have no idea what this might be tbh.\n. Yay server issues :(...\nClick \"conintue as guest\" for now, sorry about that.\n. https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/Reporting-Issues\n. pasting it here was correct. though there's not much to see in that one sadly. are the crashes consistent? does restarting Hearthstone possibly fix it? \n. Sorry your first post appeared empty when I saw it earlier. \nThis is most likely one of two problems:\n1) ~~There are files missing, try re-extracting the download.~~ You did that, try number 2 :)\n2) Some werid permissons issue where HDT can't access the files. If this is the case, manually create all the folder found in the zip (\"Hearthstone Deck Tracker\", \"Hearthstone Deck Tracker/Files\", \"Hearthstone Deck Tracker/Image\", etc) and drop the coressponding files in those.\nLet me know if that helps. \n. Not able to reproduce this.\nDoes that happen consistently?\nThe next time it does, please post the HDT log (see here) and replay (*.hdtreplay) from that game (in the Replays folder in AppData)\n. That means it can for some reason not get the hearthstone window in foreground. Try turning on/off window mode gets you any different results.\n. It's most likely not that HDT can't find the window handle but can't get it to foreground. \nTry this:\n- Go to options > tracker > exporting and set Wait 0 seconds before starting to 3.\n- Start the exporting and when it says \"please dont move your mouse...\" tab to the hearthstone window.\n. :+1: andburn!\n. Which window? I just tested Player and Opponent, both seem fine. The overlay was never captureable, and if the plugin is not yet fixed, it should be soon. I think this is the new version (he accidentally released too early): https://github.com/stdscatchemall/HDTCompatabilityWindow/releases/tag/0.1.0\n. I think you missed the screenshot :).\nCould you post the hearthstats url of the deck?\n. I will have to look into that.\nA temporary solution that kind of solves your problem would be to move the opponent card counter above the cards. (options > overlay > opponent > \"little up arrow\" next to \"Card Counter\")\n. Mhh...\nSince it didn't show the last card, it crashed somewhere before this line?  https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/blob/master/Hearthstone%20Deck%20Tracker/Hearthstone/GameV2.cs#L934\n... I'm not sure what's supposed to be null here. Anyone seeing something I don't?\nEdit: oh the cardid might have been empty...? Hopefully this just related to the HS servers being slow right now.\n. Do you still have the same HDT session running? If so, or if you encounter this again, please post the log here. (Where to find and how to post logs)\n. Could you post the log after that happened?\nhttps://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/Reporting-Issues\n. fixed with v0.10.14\n. Could you post the latest* hearthstone log found in %LocalAppData%/Blizzard/Hearthstone/Logs` (Win+R, paste)? \n*Or second-to latest, if you restarted hearthstone since the draft\n(Please upload the log content to pastebin.com) \n. Damn. If you encounter this again please post the Hearthstone/HearthstoneData/output_log. (HDT clears this one after games which is why I didn't even afk for it, but hearthstone doesn't truncate it)\n. Just had this issue myself. The game actually just logs some cards twice for no apparent reason. \nI added a one second delay before considering duplicate detections now, that hopefully helps.\nEdit: hm.. looking at the log above again, one second will not be enough. What's the solution here? Discarding all duplicated it not really an option.\nEdit2: Is there a message when the draft process is over? Putting all duplicates aside and back in at the end would atlest void premature detection of 30 cards. (This also only happens during drafting, the logged cards when entering the arena screen with a complete deck seem to be fine)\nEdit3: Also, as was just pointed out to me again, this might just be related to the current lag issues.\n. I mean in the hearthstone log. Something I could use to detect when the draft is over, rather than just going by card count.\nIt's still likely that's this was just related to the server problems. Let me know if you encounter this  again.\n. Should be fixed.\n. Turn it on or change the color to, say, blue?\nTurning it on: options > overlay > player > highlight cards in hand / highlight last drawn card\nChaning it to a different color: You can't currently.\n. You can!\n. So the solution here might be add an option (or make it automatic based on OS) to set \nUser32.SetWindowExStyle(hwnd, User32.WsExTransparent);\nor\nUser32.SetWindowExStyle(hwnd, User32.WsExTransparent | User32.WsExToolWindow);\nwithout settings the overlay owner to mainwindow. This way it results either in the overlay being visible in the alt-tab switcher or it not working with virtual desktops. Maybe there is a solution for everything?\nFor the time being, anyone having this issue: feel free to use v0.10.15 if you don't mind your HDT window being always on top.\n. Do you have any display filters set / changed them? https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/FAQ#im-getting-no-stats-displayed-on-the-deck-list-screen-even-though-i-have-games-recorded\n. Do you see any oddities in STATS > GAMES & STATISTICS > OVERALL > GAMES? Please post a screenshot if you do.\n. Please check the games in overall > games. \nDid you sync with hearthstats?\n. I think the hearthstats servers went down for a bit earlier. \nIn the screenshot above, the grey text on the left.\n. This seems to be an issue related to the recent hearthstats server issues. (HDT sending duplicates of matches/decks because it never got a response). As all of the duplicates should have the exact same length, opponent name, etc, etc, I should be able to remove all of them with an update soon.\n. Found the problem, HDT-side fix is almost done, should be out tomorrow!\n. v0.10.14 fixes this.\n. I would suggest you just press don't fix, yea. \nAlternatively/additonaly, you could send me your files so I can have a look at the problem.\n- options > tracker > backups\n- create new\n- show backup directory\n- email the file called something like \"BackupManual_25082015.zip\" to epikz37@gmail.com\n. Let me know you still have issues with this one: https://github.com/Epix37/HDT-Test/releases/tag/v0.10.15PRE1\n. Perfect :).\n. Pushed that to live. Should hopefully be good now.\n. See #1323. Fix is on it's way!\n. If this is still a problem please check if you find any files in the \"Crash Reports\" folder in the HDT install dir. Also see https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/FAQ#not-starting\nClosing for now.\n. If you join in the middle of a spectator game a lot of information is missing. You can set the overlay to hidden while in spectator (option > overlay > general).\n. Here is a tracker for mac: https://github.com/bmichotte/HSTracker\nYou should at the very least find the path there.\n. Mmmh... how about 24? This feels a bit too big.\n. Try it and tell me what you think, that's why I asked :P.\nMaybe I could even settle for 26.\n. It's not wrong!\n. Closing in favor of #2224.\n. See #548.\nShould come eventually!\nWhat you can do now: Enable options > overlay > interactivity to manually grey out secrets by clicking on them.\n.  ~~No problems with Win10 sigh~~\nHow bad is this?

Fix incoming.\n. Okay, back to normal with v0.10.16. I've had better days...\n. I did have the same issue with Win10 afterall.\n. 75 is quite not correct either. See #1007.\n. It's related to your dpi settings. This currently happens when the dpi is set to something >100%.\n. Seems to be fixed with 9153391. \n. Same thing with a lot of things actually. Currently it looks for last entity id used before that card was created. It's far from correct in most cases but gives you the general idea.\n. Yup, possible! See here: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/FAQ#add-game\n. - options > overlay > general > unlock\n- move main timer all the way to the left\n- move small timer all the way to the right\n- move main timer back\n- lock overlay again\n. It's probably already running. Check your system tray.\n. Closing in favor of #2224\n. :+1:\n. Turns out it was related to the custom \"no stats\" label on the legacy layout. Fixed now.\n. This is related to your text size setting.  Don't ask me why but this seems to happen if your text size is set to e.g. 148%, but is fine at 147% and 149%.\nGive changing that a shot.\n. I had an idea about a concept today, not sure how practical that would actually be but it might be worth playing around with:\n\n. Guess I can close this.. HSLogReader.cs is no longer used. Changes need to be applies to LogReader/HSLogReaderV2.cs\n. The array size seems to update fine on it's own.\nChanges work nicely - the wording on At least {2} wins did not get gold reward may need some simplification? I'm not really sure what to change it to though...\n. Agreed on concede and disconnect not being the same thing. That said, I don't think a special indication is necessary (and I don't even know if there would be anything hinting to that in the logs).\n. No idea to be honest :/. Any problems with other sites or other decks on hearthhead?\n. No idea to be honest :/. Any problems with other sites or other decks on hearthhead?\n. I can't reproduce this, no.

Currently working on implementing the tracking based on entities, should make this easy to fix then.\n. Working on fixing all of this. Update will come hopefully next week.\n. I just realized: Turning off MAIN > AUTO DECK SELECTION should stop this behaviour for the time being.\n. Have a look at #588 \n. What website are we talking about exactly? Could you link a deck?\n. They didn't update the IDs for the new cards again :(.\nI suggest you use NetDeck\n. Fixed with v0.14.0\n. I'm currently re-implementing the way cards are tracked. There should be an update fixing this hopefully next week.\n. I just realized: Turning off MAIN > AUTO DECK SELECTION should stop this behaviour for the time being.\n. Also, please do try the latest pre-release and see if you find any remaining problems with mechanics like joust.\n. Data path refers to HDT data, not hearthstone data. Resettings the path and turning 'save in appdata' back on should fix the problem.\n. Maybe as an option? Not a huge fan of this being on by default. \n- You can sort by last played already\n- Additional clutter\n- USE button is \"harder to hit\"\nAlternatively, what might work is if we add a tooltip to decks (or an additional panel somewhere). Containing some more information on statistics as well as this. \nWhat do you think?\n. MAIN > SORT / FILTER\n. Nah, it's fine. Yea, if you could implement the option, would be great :).\n. Happens randomly or is it consistent?\n. Wait... they are sorted alphabetically.. what?\n. Does it fix itself or is that consistent throughout the game?\n. The sorting happens here, which calls this.\n. And the opponent card list is this one\n. I have not changed Helper.SortCardCollection in about a year. And it used to work.\nType is Minion, Spell, etc. yes. \nThe only thing I did change is that I pass it OpponentListView.Items, instead of OpponentListView.ItemsSource. I do the same thing for the player deck though and that seems to be fine(?).\n. The first one looks like \"order of play\" and type. Weird stuff...\n. I think I may have already accidentally stated the solution. Changing it back from OpponentListView.Items to OpponentListView.ItemsSource seems to solve the problem. Not sure why I even changed it in the first place. Need to do some more testing to see if this is actually it.\n. ~~Played a few games, seems to be fine. Give this version a shot: https://github.com/Epix37/HDT-Test/releases/tag/v0.10.18PRE1~~ Actually, I don't think that did it.\n. The problem was: when I created the card lists that are supposed to be displayed, I created new card instances instead of loading them from the database. In theory that's totally fine becuase, when e.g. the name is then accessed, the cards loads the data automatically. However, that does not happen for the cost. So when sorting the cards by cost before sorting them by name (which is the order it needs to happen in), the cost would not be loaded yet and therefore just be 0.\n. fixed with pre-release v0.10.18\n. Intentional change, the \"K\" is redundant.\n. I will make sure to add it :).\n. Your version of the Arena Helper Plugin is no longer compatible.\n. Lets leave this open for now :) I bet someone else is going to have the same problem.\n. fixed with pre-release v0.10.18\n. Should be fixed with the next update. (which is currently available as a pre-release)\n. That has been in the works for a few days :).\n. HDT aso has some serious options! :)\nYou can select which version(s) you want to see stats for via options > tracker > stats > display. (see also here)\n. See #999 and #1010. It's a good idea but not very straight forward to impement. \nSoon (TM). ;)\n. Any chance you were trying to import a deck without any class cards (i.e. neutrals only)?\n. You could just enable all filters but the ones you don't want to see I guess. (\"None\" shows all without any tags)\n. HDT gets all it's data from the hearthstone logs which are only generated iff that file exists. HDT without it is not possible. Also see #1274. \n. \"System.UnauthorizedAccessException: L'acc\u00e8s au chemin d'acc\u00e8s 'C:\\Users\\Gori\\AppData\\Roaming\\HearthstoneDeckTracker\\config.xml' est refus\u00e9\"\nTry maybe starting HDT as administrator.\n. Probably similar to #1374. \n. Most likely #1303 then!\n. Great :) no problem.\n. You can find those under STATS > GAMES & STATISTICS > (Overall >) Games when you set the \"Games\" filter at the top to \"All\" or \"Without deck\".\n. Did the crash occour during the importing or during the game?\n. I think I got the crash fixed.. not sure why anything there would be null.\nAs for the warning you saw: it doesn't check if you have them in game but checks if you have cards in the deck in HDT. The constructed importing is far from perfect, so there might be missing/wrong cards there.\n. Updated the pre-release download with the fix(es). \n(Needs to be manually downloaded again here https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/releases/tag/v0.10.18)\n. - Arena matches only get synced to hearthstats when they are actually on arena decks. Could this be the issue?\n- Matches with mode \"None\", \"Practice\", etc.. are not. Maybe the mode detection failed? You can check this under STATS > GAMES & STATISTICS > Games.\n- The flashing problem will be fixed with the next update (and is already fixed in the current pre-release: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/releases)\n. Is that with v0.10.16 or one of the pre-releases (17 and 18)?\nIn case of 0.10.16 this is most likely the same problem as #1399\n. should be fixed with v0.11.0\n. Try re-installing .NET 4.5\n. I don't think HDT is able to crash Hearthstone. There is no interaction with the process/memory/anything. Most likely a coincidence.\n. Try extracting the zip again. This could happen if some of the .xml files in the \"Files\" directory are missing.\n. Awesome :).\n. Hm.. works fine for me. Try restarting HDT and HS.\n. Try (re-)installing .NET Framework 4.5\n. That's why I sad (re-) installing :)\n. Yes. Repair might also work if that's an option.\n. http://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/autocad/troubleshooting/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/How-to-remove-and-reinstall-the-Microsoft-NET-Framework.html\n. Seems to work no problem for me. From the exception I would guess the window in not in foreground for some reason.\n. That's good I guess. Closing this for now.\n.

Please let me know if that helps. \nIf not:\n- options -  tracker - settings - open AppData folder\n- close HDT\n- delete/rename the config.xml \n. fixed with v0.11.1\n. What are your system specs?\nDoes it change if you disable the overlay? (options > overlay > general > hide overlay)\n. Maybe the same issue as #1459? (AMD drivers)\n. The ranked detection starts at 23:38 but the last asset is unloaded at 23:32. ~~Did you alt-f4 (or similar) out of the game by any chance?~~\n. Oh it's not even not detecting ranked but not detecting the game mode. \nYou idled in the victory screen after the game right? The mode detection times out after 5 minutes and only actually detects anything once you are back in the menu. \n.

Yea.. I have seen that (very rarely) too, no idea why it happens though. Restarting seems to fix it usually.\n. 1. Depends on what exactly you mean by accuracy. There are no missing actions for anything that's suppossed to be recorded (draws, attacks, ...) .\n2. There are probably a few things missing, from the top of my head: spell/trigger targets is one of them. Buffs should be included but are sometimes not updated until on the next action.\n3. I would say parsing replays would be the easiest way to go about that.\nThat said, replays will be changed soon. I'm working together with some of the HearthSim guys on a new replay format, which will basically be a xml represenation of the Power.log. See here) for more detail.\nNot only that, but I'm also in the process writing a C# library that will be\n- a C# implementation of the project linked above (parse log -> xml and vice versa)\n- able to parse the xml into \"usable data\", similar to the current json format, just better. The idea is that you will be able to do things like\n  - var gameState1 = replay.GetTurnStart(5);\n  - var gameState2 = replay.GetNextAction(ActionType.Attack);\n- hopefully able to parse hdtreplay to the new format\nThe lib is not available anywhere yet but will be open source as soon as I get it to a somewhat usable state (the coming week?). In case your application is also .NET, this should make some of your work a lot easier. I'd also welcome any collaboration :).\n. I'm fairly sure the xml replay implementation is definitely usable already. You should come join the #Hearthsim IRC channel on the Freenode network, jleclanche will be able to tell you exactly if there's anything not working yet. (You can also find me there usually - or alternatively on gitter)\nThe lib, which HDT will use, is a direct port of the python implementation at it's core, plus features to actually process those replays. \nA plugin might be the way to go, we'll see :).\n. See #1355.\n. Neat solution!\n. I would love to see that added, absolutely!\nYou can get secrets from other classes for example via Nefarian or Spellslinger.\n. That was quick! I will have a closer look later, very excited :).\nWhat I see right now though: I don't think removing the ability to manually grey out secrets by clicking is a good idea. You might either not want to enable the auto-greyout or it could mess it for some reason and this then leaves you with no way to correct it.\n. Workaround in #2186\n. I think I found and fixed the issue. I'll release a beta update later today. Please see if that still happens with that.\n. Okay no beta update, I don't feel like writing update notes right now.\nBuit here is a test release: https://github.com/Epix37/HDT-Test/releases/tag/v0.11.4PRE5\n.

Blizzard broke the gold tracking with TGT, then it was fixed for the broken logging and now Blizzard fixed it so it's broken again... :D\nIt's on the todo list for v0.11.5\n. @Cu8eR please read the posts.\n\nI then deleted and newly created both my HDT program and data folder, and copied my games, decks and settings from a backup to the newly created data folder. Since then, the deck auto-select is operational again.\n. options > overlay > opponent > highlight discarded from deck\ndespite the name, this also includes hand discards.\n. I think this is fixed.\n. Try uninstalling and reinstalling .NET Framework 4.5 and/or installing any new windows update.\n. Duplicate of #733.\n. Same as #1553\n. If you manually deleted decks on HearthStats, HDT will try to upload matches using the stored deck id. To \"reset\" the ids select all your (ctrl-a) and run HEARTHSTATS > DELETE SELECTED DECKS. Try syncing again after that.\n(Depending on what you mean by \"imported each deck manually from files\" this might not apply)\n\nWhat has me a little confused is that you are getting 400 and 404 error codes. Either those are some temporary server issues (I just tired it but had no issues), or maybe something changed with your firewall/proxy configuration?\n. @rembound \nFYI\nThe v0.11.4 beta release breaks a few things in places where the API is bypassed. \nHelper.MainWindow.Overlay has been move to Core.Overlay (and can also no longer be null).\nAre you directly accessing any other things? I'd be happy to add more API endpoints to make plugins more stable throughout changes. Just let me know what you need.\n. @NijeMiBrodo Arena Helper doesn't work with the current pre-release. If you want to use it, downgrade  to v0.11.3.\nWe will make sure it works properly with the next \"real\" release.\n. Might be related to this, which is supposed to deal with day changes, since the logs do not contain any date information in the timestamp. ~~Not sure why yet though.~~ Thinking about it.. that line doesn't make much sense.\nEdit: Hm.. nvm that seems correct afterall. If assuming the reader reads lines from 11:59pm day0 to 12:01am day1, the pased date would be day1, so 11:59pm day 1 would be later than \"now\" and needs to be set back 24 hours. So I'm not sure where the problem is then :/.\n. ~~Possibly also fixed with v0.12.2?~~\n. @irufus this has not been fixed, no. I looked into it a while ago and found that the PowerLogReader stops working, but others (I think Bob specifically in this case) don't. No idea what to make of that.\n. I can't seem to reproduce this issue, but I have a reasonable idea what the problem is: FileInfo.LastWriteTime  returns the time the file was started to be written to, rather than the last something was appended.\nCould you guys give this version a shot: https://github.com/Epix37/HDT-Test/releases/tag/v0.13.15_PRE1\n.

This allows for some pretty specific statistics, e.g. the average match time for \"wins vs druid from rank 3-5, in season 19-23\".\nWhen selecting 'active deck only' the matchups table is swapped out with the version breakdown one for that deck.\n.

Boom does not have deathrattle, but this was indeed wrong. I wonder how no one has ever noticed that. Will be fixed with the next update.\n. While I get the idea, I don't quite see the need since the rarity is barely used. So mistakes due to misspelling are fairly unlikely nor is there any performance to be gained here. \ncard.TypeRarity == Card.eTypeRarity.Legendary is in my opinion also a lot less readable (and more tedious to write) than card.Rarity == \"Legendary\". \nWhy not go with something like\nC#\npublic class Rarity\n{\n    public static string Legendary { get { return \"Legendary\" } };\n}\nThat would result in a much cleaner card.Rarity == Rarity.Legendary\n. Turns out there is actually a much cleaner solution: xml can be deserialized directly to enums. I guess I didn't know that at the time. Doing this with the rest of the card properties would probably be a good idea.\n. Closing in favor of #1642\n. Will be fixed with the next update. Was fixed with https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/344d94a6dbdc88fadd09ef4d24a084bca0df202e and https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/8f3e62fb1de389b85acaa3792c8ea83397f7663d. \n. Looks like something changed on hearthpwns end. This also is an issue in 0.12.2. Fixed for the next update.\n. There is current no API endpoint for that but you can just access the data directly.\nHere is an example on how you could get a list of all games for the deck \"deck\" where the player played a card with the cardid \"cardid\":\nC#\nHearthstone_Deck_Tracker.DeckList.Instance.Decks.FirstOrDefault(x => x.Name == \"deck\")\n                        .DeckStats.Games.Where(\n                                                g =>\n                                                g.TurnStats.Any(\n                                                                x =>\n                                                                x.Plays.Any(\n                                                                            p =>\n                                                                            p.Type == PlayType.PlayerDraw && p.CardId == \"cardid\")));\n. Glad it fixed itself. Did you restart hearthstone in the meantime? Could be something with that. \nHearthpwn importing not working is not related, they simply changed something on their website that causes cards to appear blank when importing decks.\n. Do you have options > overlay > general > don't reset decks after a game disabled? If so, try enabling that. I think this might be related.\n. One other thing: You mention mostly ranked, from the log I would say those games were mostly casual, is that right? Assuming those are the games in question, do you have casual games set to be recorded and displayed? (options > tracker > stats > record / display)\n. Do you mean the cards that remain on the overlay when you are in menu after the game due to that option? Those clear when you start a new match, yes.\n. That's great! Definitely not the intended way, no. I'll fix that!\n. I think I found and fixed the issue. \nTry enabling on recording stats for the game modes casual and other. That should solve the problem for the time being. \n. If the heartharena overwolf app removes something from the log.config, that would very well be the problem.\nPlease try starting HDT and Hearthstone before starting the heartharena app, see if the problem persists.\n. After playing a game and going back to menu, is there a \"Asset.log\" file in \"Hearthstone/Logs\"? If so, could upload it?\n. Do you have (menubar) MAIN > AUTO DECK SELECTION and options > tracker > general > autoselect deck if only one possible enabled?\n. Exporting as/to what specifically?\n. Works fine for me.

General feedback: Try to keep your PRs more coherent (? - not sure if that's the word I'm looking for). Two commits that are not at least somewhat related they should probably have their own PR. If there's some change in there that I don't agree with that means more work for at least one of us :).\nMore detailed:\n- Line endings: ~~not sure why the main project is different from the rest.~~ Looks like it's all CR LF, maybe some configuration on your end? You could commit only the one new line (LangVersion) though, that would at least keep it cleaner.\n- The color changes: Not a fan of the change. I think it doesn't really accomplish much besides adding more clutter.\n- Try to be more descriptive with commit messages than \"Fix #1696\". With this you need to actually look at the issue/commit to have any idea what was fixed.\n  - Does that actually completely fix it? What happens when e.g. Sludge Belcher dies? \n  - If a foreach has more than one line of \"content\" it should have braces (at least here :)). Coding style is obviously subjective.\n. - It all has CR LF on my end is what I mean.  Are there only LF on git for some reason? I usually push/pull as is. \n- #1696: I'm not sure about the order things are logged in.

Are you by any chance on a region that hasn't updated to 4.0.0.10833 yet? You can see the current version in the battle.net launcher next to the \"Play\" button.\nIf that's not the case please reproduce the issue and post the hdt logs. See here.\n. Oh that makes more sense now! :)\n. You should use Core.MainWindow.SelectDeck(null, true), rather than  DeckList.Instance.ActiveDeck = null;.\nAnd I think for this to really be useful it needs to re-select the last deck after leaving spectator if there was a deck selected previously. This can be done via Core.MainWindow.SelectLastUsedDeck() but HDT needs to keep some state (throughout sessions) of whether a deck was previously active. \n. Should be fixed.\n. Could you restart HDT, give it another try and post the HDT log here?\nSee here for how to get the log.\n. I'm getting closer but not close enough. Could you upload your latest HDT backup for me?

There will be a new update in a few minutes.\n. New update is out. Let me know if you still have issues.\n. Great! :) Thanks for reporting back.\n. Will be fixed with v0.13.3 later today!\n. That would come with an incredible amount of problems. From internal logic where decks are expected to have a class, to it just not being supported by the UI anywhere. \nIt would be a lot of work for something that would rarely find any use. I would suggest using \"no deck mode\" (menu: MAIN > USE NO DECK) instead.\n. You can download the latest version here and replace all the existing files. \n. To add on to this: same goes for Curse of Rafaam, Ancient Shade, Entomb, Excavated Evil, Elise Starseeker and Map to the Golden Monkey. All fixed for the next update.\n. Might be fixed with https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/7d1242575b7e716ecb71843b0b7e1ae2d5f989e2, I'll take another look though.\n.

Working on fixing game mode and rank detection and I have an idea what might be happening with the name. \nAs long as the games have a replay, the opponents class and name can be automatically recovered from that. I will add something to do this.\n. Data is stored under \"%AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker\" (i.e. OLD_DRIVE:\\Users\\USER\\AppData\\Roaming\\HearthstoneDeckTracker). If you move that to the new drive you should be good.\n. There is a STATS item in the menu bar (pretty much directly below the options button), that's the one you are looking for :).\n. Not really human readable but there is a replay format now: http://hearthsim.info/hsreplay/\nA web replay viewer is currently being worked on by the HearthSim community as well: https://github.com/HearthSim/joust\nYou can find more information about HearthSim here: http://hearthsim.info/, including an IRC channel.\n. It's the same order as in-game. \n. Fixed the obvious bug, not sure how to handle more complicated, admittedly rare, situations though. See commit message for details.\n. Permanently? (Only why HDT is open? Until reboot?)\nDoes it make a difference whether or not Hearthstone is running?\n. Fixed with v0.14.4.\n. Try changing to windowed/fullscreen and make sure the latter has a resolution set in game.\n. Seems to be working fine for me via IMPORT > FROM WEB. Are you using the NetDeck chrome extension? That seems to have an issue with getting the name at the moment. (@n4ru)\n. Rejected. Just archive old decks if you want to keep stats.\n. have you tried the csv plugin? https://github.com/andburn/hdt-plugin-statsconverter\n. > Unfortunately, for ending rank to work automatically, the rank detection would have to improve, so it would be reliable and also be able to track either both of your ranks (pre-game and post-game) or track your stars as well\nYes, this is the main problem right now, working on fixing that. When that's all done, this is certainly a good idea. (so is the season recap)\n. Does HDT create a crash report? If so please upload it (http://pastebin.com).\nAs for disabling it: you can do that under options > tracker > general > show arena reward dialog....\n. Sounds like it might have saved, yes.\nThe crash report folder is located with the .exe, not in appdata.\n. You should be able to find the games STATS > [OLD] GAMES & STATISTICS > overall > games, when you sete the \"games\" fitler to \"all\" or \"without deck\".\nYou can manually add arena runs:\n- Create a new arena deck via NEW > [CLASS] > arena, (add cards if desired and) save\n- select the new run under STATS > ARENA RUNS > Runs & matches\n- click \"add game\" to add new games\n. Check out MAIN > SORT/FILTER and MAIN > QUICK FILTER (menu bar).\nIs that what you are looking for?\n. https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/1853#issuecomment-189459255\n. Should be fixed\n. I think adding a none value to the enum is not the right approach here. IIRC there are several things that require a valid hero class (hearthstats syncing being one of them for example). Also changing enum indices always seems a bit dangerous. I don't think they are referred to by index anywhere but better save than sorry (adding it at the end would be saver).\n. Could it be one of these issues? https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/FAQ#exporting\n. The deck list in the overlay does not update when you draw cards, correct? \nDoes that happen only for golden ones? That would a a very unusual issue.\nOtherwise please see if this helps you out: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/FAQ#not-working\n. Importing: \nTry re-running the constructed importing setup (options > tracker > importing > set up constructed importing). The feature is sadly fear from perfect, but there is not much that can be done to improve it, just due to the nature of how it works (it checks for card images that were unloaded by the game). \nExporting: \nI'm not sure why it would work from web but not from a stored one, very strange. See if disabling options > tracker > exporting > prioritize golden card or any of the suggetions here help.\n. Closing in favor of #2250. See https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/2250#issuecomment-204116658 for info on the state of constructed importing.\n. Does this issue actually occour with non-latin languages besides russian? That's the only one I've seen this issue with so far.\n. I sent them a message. Let's see if we can make this happen :).\n. Amazing! Seems to work very well from what I can tell!\nMerged into rank_detection branch for now.\nSome changes I made:\n- Utility.RankDetection.Range needs to be a class or implement the base ctor to compile as C#5 (I added the latter)\n- Added Overlay.IsRankCovered() to make sure you only see the overlay flickering if actually necessary.\n- Added a DetectRanks() (extracted from TurnStart) call to Game end to deal with instant condeces (that just happened to happen to me while testing :))\n- Made DetectRanks() async void with a \"running\" check to not block the main thread with await RankDetection.Match().\n- Added friendslist detection to DetectRanks(), which waits for the FL to be closed and displays a message in the overlay before running Match() (this needs to not block the main thread even more).\n- Added a max number of tries to ranked detection if is disrups the user experience (i.e. overlay flickering). We might want to add a general max tries to avoid the overlay flickering x times once a deck list gets too large.\n- Completely (I think?) removed the old methods of rank(ed) detection.\n. Can't seem to reproduce this issue (anymore?).\n. See https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/2201#issuecomment-195804378\n. Should be the same dialog, is it not?\n. Oh.. yea I completely missed that.\n. Good to hear it's working now. Thank you for posting your solution.\n. You are most likely missing some files.

Looks like hearthstone is not writing the log file required for mode detection. \n. Possibly the same as #1553? If so, should be fixed.\n. Rank detection now waits for HS to be in foreground. \n@anonymous555 Could you post a screenshot of your game+overlay in ranked? HDT should normally briefly disable the overlay if the ranks might be covered by either deck list.\n. @anonymous555 part of the problem is most likely that v0.13.5 also requires the opponent rank to be detected for detection to be a success. That was changed with https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/758e1b027161f481f9e5374734b39e247a3461ec to only require the player rank.\nThe overlay should toggle though if the rank is covered - not sure why that's not happening.

Could you try it one more time and then post the HDT log here? See here for where to get that.\n. Very strange. HDT seems to be sending the key/mouse actions but they don't make it to Hearthstone for some reason. If you have multiple monitors, please try if moving the game to a different monitor helps.\nIf not, please enable options > tracker > settings > show log, set options > tracker > logging > log level to 1 and post the log again.\n. Do you have a crash log? That should log an exception (the one you posted) but not crash the application.\n. The crash logs contain the full log, so this might very well be in the log but not the reason for the crash. Does the application crash when you click \"latest replay\" without the directory existing?\n. What exactly is grey? The mana crystals? Those represent the rarity by default, you can change that by disabling options > tracker > general > rarity-colored card gems.\n. Should be fixed with v0.15.4\n. This might be fixed with the next version (current pre-release).\n. Have you tried the first two suggestions in the FAQ? https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/FAQ#exporting\n. That's great to hear! There were some improvements to exporting stability with v1.1.0.2.\n. HDT now uses Hearthstones native deck string importing system.. I think there was an issue on this somewhere... can't find it.\nEither way, this is a nice idea for the constructed stats overhaul.\n. Found it - dupe of #2014.\n. That will be with the next update. See #1739.\n. Seems to be working fine for me. Can you reproduce this and post the log? See here\n. See #1919.\n. I will be happy to add that with the new constructed stats.\n. This is with v0.13.3? (You can see the version number under \"help\" in the title bar or in the system tray icon tooltip)\nWhat game modes do you have the problem with?\n. This should hopefully be fixed with the next release.\n. Could you post the hdt logs of that happening? options > tracker > settings > open appdata folder, \"Logs\" folder, zip and upload the hdt_log files since you started using 0.13.6 (http://zippyshare.com).\n. @MarineKingAizen See if this helps / is the case for you: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/FAQ#ranked-games-are-recorded-as-casual\n. I think this has no negative consequences aside from something wrong being logged, or have you come across anything?\n. No error message of any sort? Any change after rebooting?\n. See #1815\n. Is this with v0.13.3? If so, please see if you still have that issue with the latest pre-release: v0.13.5.\n. Hearthstone Deck Tracker\\Plugins\\ArenaHelper\\x86\\opencv_ffmpeg300.dll do not exist.\nCan you check if that does indeed not exist? If so, try downloading ArenaHelper again.\n. There are definitely dlls missing though, that's why it crashes. I would guess Arena Helper usually downloads or generates them at runtime? Maybe @rembound can help here? \n. Could you post the related windows event log? See here, you should be able to find it under windows log > application.\n.

HSReplay should work with PowerTaskList - at least the python implementation - the only thing missing (still) is the CREATE_GAME line.\nIt only contains PowerTaskList because that is what HDT uses. It's a lot more consistent than GameState.\n. I think structure wise the only difference is that FULL_ENTITY lines always contain \"Updating\" rather than \"Creating\". \nOther than that, the main difference (and most important one for HDT) is that PowerTaskList does not have the \"UNKNOWN HUMAN PLAYER\" issue. \n. I don't think they are. \nI plan on generating hsreplay files by default some time early next year. As long as the conversion somewhat works (hdtreplay logs -> hsreplay) it should be fine.\n. Do you have the hdt log for that game?\n. Might be fixed. Let me know if it happens again.\n. It lauches both via the battlenet:// protocol. You may need to reinstall the battlenet launcher / hearthstone for it to work.\n. I'm not able to reproduce it. Could you try debugging/fixing it?\n. The worst case with screen dimming should be that ranked games are recorded as casual. \nHDT now uses another log to detect the rank (has to be enabled)  -  see if restarting Hearthstone and HDT helps. \n. Does it not record ranked at all or just as casual? \nCan you disable Flux and see if that fixed it? \n. @ginko147 could you post a screenshot of the hs + hdt overlay in a ranked game? \n. @MyopicCat screen dimming should not have any effect on areng games, only ranked vs casual. Can you post hdt logs of those games?\n@ginko147 Just had another look at the log you posted, the games not being recorded comes from the fact that it does not register them as casual and you have recording casual games disabled. So if you enable that they at least will be recorded (in the wrong mode, but still).\n. Made some adjustments.\nCan you guys give this version a shot? https://github.com/Epix37/HDT-Test/releases/tag/v0.13.7_PRE1\n. Can you try changing the resolutions and/or windowed/fullscreen?\n. Could you post a screenshot of a ranked game via the HDT build-in functionality? options > tracker > hotkeys and set a hotkey for screenshot.\n. No crash, it just freezes?\nAt least we now most likely know where the issue is. Ranked detection uses the same sort of screenshot for analysis. I'll upload a build in 2 hours or so with some more explicit logging that should help figure out what exactly is causing it.\nDoes the same happen for the others here?\n. Huh.. running that screenshot through the rank detection works perfectly fine for me. \nThere is one minor difference between the two screenshot implementations, let's hope that's the bug.\nTry this one: https://github.com/Epix37/HDT-Test/releases/tag/v0.13.7_PRE2\n. Awesome!\nCan I get one or two more confirmations on 0.13.7_PRE2 fixing it?\n. Released v0.13.7. Should be fixed!\n. Found the problem.... apparently updating games on HearthStats does not work, so when you changed the mode to ranked it just deleted the game but did not re-upload it. \nThat bug must have been around for about 8 months... that explains so much.\n. Should be fixed with v0.13.7.\n. Could you post the logs of those games? You can find them under %AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker/Logs (options > tracker > settings > open appdata folder). \n. @bstuparu see here for ranked games: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/1881#issuecomment-165717394\n. Still an issue with v0.13.7?\n. What happens if you press \"select manually\" and then provide your Hearthstone install dir?\n. It needs the Hearthstone folder. E.g. C:\\Program Files\\Hearthstone.\n. No problem :).\n. Please make a screenshot during a ranked game via the HDT hotkey (set up under options > tracker > hotkeys)  and post it here. \n. Possibly a windows update? \nNot entirely sure how those empty screenshots happen. Most likely something system-specific.\n. Give this version a try: https://github.com/Epix37/HDT-Test/releases/tag/v0.13.10_PRE2\n. Closing in favor of #2034\n. It can't detect the number of copies for cards, so it defaults to either 1 or 2 copies of each, depending on whatever is closer to 30.\n. Try enabling options > tracker > exporting > paste names from clipboard.\n. There should be a file mentioned in the crash log. Please try deleting that.\n. Could you explain the problem in a bit more detail? With, without deck? Screenshots and logs (see here) might help.\n. This is only an issue when no deck is selected, correct?\n. Could someone post the log (see here) after doing this:\n- restart HDT\n- try to create a deck for a class where the cards are missing\n. I was hoping to see exceptions along the lines of \"card could not be found in database\". This is very confusing.\nMaybe this is some config problem? Could you upload the config.xml found in %AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker (alternative: options > tracker > settings > open appdata folder)?\n. Should be fixed with v0.13.10\n. The UI side does not support settings mouse buttons so I never even tried this. Since there is no use for it internally, I'm leaning towards just disallowing mouse buttons. Is there any particular reason you would want to bind to mouse buttons?\n. Indeed nice catch. Any particular reason for try-finally instead of inverting the if?\nC#\nif(_game.OpponentMinionCount != 0)\n{\n    await _game.GameTime.WaitForDuration(AvengeDelay);\n    if(_game.OpponentMinionCount - _avengeDeathRattleCount > 0)\n        _game.OpponentSecrets.SetZero(CardIds.Secrets.Paladin.Avenge);\n}\n_awaitingAvenge = false;\n_avengeDeathRattleCount = 0;\n. See #2186\n. Duplicate of #1508.\n. #313\n. Open the window, alt-tab to it and then press Win+Left-Arrow until you see it.\n. Fixed with #1911. Closing in favor of #1907.\n. Are you sure you are on the latest versions on both? Works fine for me. \n. does not really \"solve\" anything\n. Should be fixed with v0.14\n. I can assure you HDT is not directly accessing any of those. The answer by @riQQ seems like the most reasonable explanation. \n. I'm not entirely sure what's causing this but the next release will have an option to force clear the search box between cards. That should hopefully help.\n. Closing in favor of #1906.\n. No idea why this happens. The crash will be fixed with the next release though.\n. Please enable options > tracker > settings > show log and set options > tracker > logging > log level to 1, then try again and post the log again.\n. This is probably a problem with the parenthesis. Weird thing is: it works fine for me and the deckname in-game contains none. \nTry removing them from the deckname in HDT.\n. Fixed with ~~c9f752f~~ bde4e16. Closing in favor of #2185.\n. Do you still have this problem with the v0.13.19 pre-release? https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/releases/tag/v0.13.19\n. See #1007 for further explanation on how the timer exactly works. I don't see a way to \"fix\" it.\n. The only \"modification\" HDT makes should be the log.config, so after deleting that (and not starting HDT again) everything should be back to normal.\nWhat has me most confused though is that it worked for a day.

If you did do that, it might be a problem with RAR Opener, try using 7-zip.\n. Local replay support has now been fully removed.. Probably fixed by updating to the latest MahApps version. I will do that at some point - hesitant because it will break every single plugin.\n. This should be fixed with v0.14.0.\n. Duplicate of #1031\n. I think I found the cause: Try disabling options > overlay > interactivity.\n.

Give this version a try: https://github.com/Epix37/HDT-Test/releases/tag/v0.13.10_PRE2\n. @tknights2015 can you doublecheck you used the \"Game Screenshot\" and not infact the \"Screenshot\" hotkey action? Those should not include the overlay :/.\nEdit: make sure to delete the hotkey again before downgrading to 13.9\n. Well, I changed nothing about the normal Screenshot hotkey functionality.. apparently same behaviour as before where it just started working again at some point. \nRank(ed) detection no longer uses that method of taking screenshots, but the \"game screenshot\" one.\n. what version of directX are you using? (win > run > dxdiag)\n. Perfect. Can anyone else confirm?\n. @Gr3yz With and without options > tracker > settings > alternative screen capture enabled?\nIf so, please make a screenshot with both hotkeys actions (screenshot, game screenshot) and post them here.\n.

Avenge is properly detected, the UI is just not updated. Fixed for v0.13.10.\n. Should be fixed with v0.13.10\n. What does the log look like?\n. Switching to GameAccountId-hi value or ServerIP (Net.log) based detection might be an option.\n. The window size is stored in the config just like anything else. There is a known issue where it doesn't properly restore to maximized after closing.\nCould this be related to HDT being force-closed when you shut down your machine?\n. The config is stored under %AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker\nThese are the relevant properties:\n<TrackerWindowLeft>\n  <TrackerWindowTop>\n  <WindowHeight>\n  <WindowWidth>\n. You can manually modify arena runs under STATS > ARENA RUNS > Runs & matches > add/delete/edit game. \n. You could record the replayviewer with any recording software I suppose. There is no \"export as video\", autoplay or any functionality like that, sorry.\n. You could keep presssing the down arrow to go to the next state, but there's no fancy graphics or animations so I'm not sure it would make for a good recording.\n. You could, but it's not something I would recomment the current replay viewer for, no. Actual recordings of the game make for a much better video. \n. See here: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/FAQ#not-working\n. I'm assuming you are talking about arena here? You can manually add games under STATS > ARENA RUNS > Runs & matches > add/edit/delete game, on the selected run (edit rewards is also possible there`). Adding entire new runs is a matter of creating a new arena deck (can be empty). \n\nIs there a graphical way of identifying and the crosses/losses and number of wins of a arena screen and binding that to the deck in use?\n\nCurrently not possible.\n. First Hearthstone launch per day sounds like a good solution.\n. Try creating an acccount on the website (here: http://hearthstats.net/users/sign_up?) and signing in with that.\n. Could you post the log after trying to login/register? (see here)\n. Should be fixed.\n. > 1. Change seconds from 30 to 15\n\n\nPlay game (will alert at 30 seconds, not 15)\n\n\nI'm not able to reproduce this, sound plays at the correct time for me.\n\nYou can also:\n3. Restart HDT\n4. \"Alert after X seconds\" now says 30 again\n\nValue was not being loaded correctly, this is now fixed.\n. There is no delayed detection for hunter secrets, so it being the same problem as Avenge is unlikely. \nThe hiding is also rather isolated and only depends on an special counter that is changed on triggered/played/stolen. So I'm not really sure how this happened. \n@knoxius: Logs from old sessions are stored in %AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker/Logs (Win+R, paste), could you upload the one that corresponds to that game?\n. Nothing changed in regards to logging. Is this problem only present with the latest version running? What happens when you use 13.7 again? No HDT at all? \n. See #1906 for a workaround. I sadly still don't know what's causing this.\n. Approved! Great plugin.\nI reverted the last change on the wiki (removal) for you.\n. This should be fixed with v0.14\n. Just doublechecked, definitely exists for me. Are you possibly trying to find it in a non-paladin deck?\n. See if v0.13.11 fixes this problem.\n. Perfect! \n. See #1906 for a workaround. I sadly still don't know what's causing this.\n. :+1:\n. Will be fixed with the next update. See #1906 for a workaround.\n. Using GameState instead of PowerTaskList can be enabled in the config but is no longer supported by HDT and could cause problems. Chances are PowerTaskList is closer to the actual animation, especially when multiple animations are queued. GameState will log everything instantly in that case. \nBtw, Gitter or IRC might be better suited for these kinds of questions.\n. That's the one.\nSee here: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2771290\n\nCause\nThe Windows Imaging Component (WIC) installation is damaged on the computer(s) exhibiting the problem.\nResolution\nOn Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 computers, you may be able to resolve this problem by installing the standalone WIC redistributable from the following download site. Windows Imaging Component For Windows Vista and later operating systems, try repairing the operating system installation. \n. There was no change from 0.13.8 to 0.13.9 that could cause this. Maybe it was just a matter of restarting Hearthstone (most likely this problem)?\n. Weird, but good to hear :).\n. Nice idea.\n\nI see two problems right now:\n- \"rebase\" might not be very clear for the average user. Something like \"update url\" or \"set url\" is probably easier to understand.\n- The menu item is currently missing from the DECKS menu in the menu bar.\n. Perfect! :+1:\n. See #1824.\n. Do you have options > overlay > player > include obtained cards enabled?\n. Go to %AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker (Win+R, paste) and delete the PlayerDecks.xml file. If there is a  PlayerDecks_backup.xml, rename it to PlayerDecks.xml. Otherwise go to the Backups folder and replace it with the PlayerDecks.xml from the latest zip.\n. Check out MAIN > SORT / FILTER (menu bar)\n. You are absolutely right, it's too hidden. I added a button for it to the main UI.\n\n. Is MAIN > AUTO DECK SELECTION in the menu bar enabled?\n. \nAside from the X being too thick, is this too noisy?\nEdit:\n\nI think this is going in the right direction, Still don't like the clear button though...\n. Cancel symbol works nicely, thanks.\nCompleted this with https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/cec1d5ce8f351cfc877cee292706016a16d99fe4.\nFinal result:\n\n. The problem with hiding autoselect somewhere in the options is this: If you have it enabled and get the list of decks to choose from but close the dialog / select \"no deck\", it's turned off and you have to fiddle with the options menu to turn it back on. (That reminds me I need to change the message for that :))\nI put the button on the left so that it is clearer it does something with the active deck without requiring any text. On the right it probably needs to read at least \"NO DECK\" - \"clear deck\" sounds a lot better now that I think of it. That said, I am concered the cancel buton alone is not clear enough.\nThis is it with the button:\n\nBiggest problem imo is that the active deck name is not really readable anymore at minimum window width.\n. That does look better\n\n. Two more things:\n- Please use tabs instead of spaces.\n- Currently, closing the news bar via its integrated close button would not update the checkbox in options.\n.

See here: https://github.com/rembound/Arena-Helper/issues/62\n. See #2261.\nIf running the import setup does not help there's probably not much I can do to fix it due to the nature of how the importing works.\n. See #2115.\n. ~~The biggest problem I see is that changing the signature of ParseDeckNameTemplate will cause the current arenahelper version to become incompatible. If at all possbile I would like to avoid breaking plugins.~~ Nvm, not really a problem after all.\n. @rembound FYI. \nHelper.ParseDeckNameTemplate now has an overload that accepts Deck as a parameter to allow for {Class} parsing. \"Worst case\": no deck is provided but the template contains {Class}, it's replaced with an empty string, resulting in {Class}_Arena => _Arena.\n. Not really sure why (or how) that happens. Can you run older versions?\n. Could you elaborate?\n. I'm not entirely sure if this is what your are looking for but there is a after-game note dialog popup you can enable via options > tracker > general > show note dialog after game.\n. That would probably make sense! I will do that :).\n. Not too sure what would cause this. See if your graphics cards drivers are up to date.\n. Automatically uploading the deck is extremely unpractical since would require the full deck to be played in a single game. \nSay you replace 1 card, during the course of the game you play all but 3 cards (both were already in the game). There is no way for HDT to know which card needs to be removed from the deck to make space for the new one. Even if you can determine the 3 missing cards from game one in the second, there is no way to know if any other modifications were made in the meantime. \nModifying the deck in HDT only takes 5 seconds and is far more reliable. \nOne thing I can do though is add a hotkey to edit the current deck. \n. Duplicate of #1410.\nFeel free to make such a plugin, sure.\n. No way of adding golden cards in HDT.\nThe easiest way would be to take 5 minutes and look through the menus and options menu.

A new one is planned for later this year, we'll see about things like custom constraints then :).\n. There are currently no plans to do so, as @culinko said, the plugin works fine.\nHDT will not be reading memory or traffic for as long as the logs exist.\n. See #2103\n. Has been discussed a lot, short answer: no, sorry.\nFor longer answers see here: #6, #263\n. It is now the CLEAR button on the bottom right of the deck picker. \n. See #2103.\nEdit: That is in case you mean HDT update. There has not been a (permanent) hs update since december.\n. Try restarting Hearthstone.\n. See #2103\n. I seem to have missed this.\nNot sure on the crash, but you will need separate configs for both systems or have Hearthstone installed in the same path. Then try disabling options > tracker > save data in appdata (enable advanced options for HDT >v0.13.13). \nBefore launching HDT on the second machine, make sure to clear the %AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker folder, or you might run into conflicts with the data, i.e. one will overwrite the other, depending on the config settings. \nAlso see #1507 and #545.\n. @Cu8eR has a valid point. Plus I perfer not downloading things without the user knowing.\n\ncouple times per week\n\nThat's a bit of an exaggeration:\n- v0.13.6/7: Dec 18\n- v0.13.8/9: Jan 29\n- v0.13.10/11: Feb 17\n- v0.13.12: Feb 23\nAnd if you don't want to update on client start, you don't have to. You can click \"not now\" (or whatever the button says).\n. Fair enough. With the next release a reminder with an \"update now\" button will be displayed below the title bar if the initial update dialog was declined.\n. Do you still see the games under arena - archived (archived is the folder icon to the right the class ones) in the deck picker (main UI)?\nIf these are indeed only old games, the easiest workaround would be to set the time filter to exclude them. \n. #2103\n. As a temporary workaround, disabling options > tracker > exporting > prioritize golden cards should do the trick.\n. It's not so much the fact that Poly Boar is golden, but rather that the normal Polymorph is not. HDT just checks if there is a card in the second slot, regardless whether it's golden or not.\nFor most language settings, the artists name is added to the search term to prevent this from happening. I'm not entirely sure why it's not enabled for all. Searching for \"Vance Kovacas\" seems to work fine regardless of what language I set Hearthstone to. Could you confirm that on your end?\n. Sorry, typo. Thanks for testing. I'll have a look at implementing it for all languages again then.\n. Try enabling options > tracker > exporting > paste names from clipboard.\n. I'm not entirely sure what you mean, could you rephrase the problem? \nStep by step, what do you do, what do you expect to happen, what does actually happen?\n. Issue 1:\nSeems to be working for me, possibly also a language problem. \nCould you reproduce the problem one more time and then post the hdt log? See here.\nSidenote: You can import - from web right away, without manually creating the deck first.\n. I think you are having the same underlying issue as #2115.\nYou can move the data folder by:\n1. unchecking options > tracker > settings > save data in appdata\n2. setting the new path via options > tracker > settings > set data path\nThat's if we are talking about the same data folder. If you want to move the installation, you can just move that folder, should be no problem there.\n. You should still have all your data after manually downloading and updating.\n. Yup!\n. No problem, don't worry about it :).\n. Point one and two here should solve your problem.\n. Now for the slightly more nitpicky things:\n- there are still a few unnecessary formatting changes.\n- the Hearthstone Deck Tracker.csproj change should probably be in the first commit\n- the first commit message should describe what the class does on it's own (especially since it has it's own commit), something along the lines of \"adds functionality to parse formatted strings on TextBlock\"\n. Spaces again :P.\n. Merged. I squashed the spaces commit and made 2 minor changes in Card.cs.\n. Could you remove the \"new line at end of file\" changes? ~~Other than that this looks good.~~\n. One more thing actually: No more than one change per commit doesn't have to be taken quite as literally :). \nCould you squash the first 3 commits into something like added config setting for StartHearthstoneWithHDT and reword the last to say launch hearthstone on start rather than start hearthstone.\n. Perfect! Merged.\n. See if points 1 and 2 here help to solve your problem: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/FAQ#not-working\n.

Unless you changed options > tracker > settings > store data in appdata, HDT stores everthing in %AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker (options > tracker > settings > open appdata folder). The data is independant of \"installations\", you have the same decks and stats, running HDT from 3 different folders. \nIf you did disablestore data in appdata, copying over everything (or just overwriting the files in the previous installation) should work just fine.\nOtherwise you can try restoring a previous backup under options > tracker > backups.\n.

This looks like the exact issue caused by a missing line in the log.config, see #2103. (therefore support)\nI need a hdt log of this problem for anything furher.\n. Source?\n. I just had a look. The latest Innkeeper enables hearthstone logging, but only the power log. That log does not contain any information regarding decks. So the logging can only be used for card tracking during the game.\nAll other information Innkeeper gathers is read from memory (or possibly traffic).\nFurther than that: Innkeeper overwrites the log.config (which, as I said, only contains power - hdt uses a lot of other ones). This means HDT will not work if starting HDT, then Innkeeper, then Hearthstone.\n. > All other information Innkeeper gathers is read from memory (or possibly traffic).\n. Let me elaborate on that: There is very little information in the logs regarding deck information. I'm fairly certain HDT is very close to \"as good as it can get\". The only alternatives being image recognition or OCR. \nWhat Innkeeper does is, it checks the Hearthstone process' memory for the deck information, which is of course complete and immediate. FYI, this is technically against the TOS (though, the chance of getting banned for it is fairly low).\n. Added with v0.14.0.\n. Some file permissions problem probably. Maybe HDT was still running somehow.\n. Could you upload the hdtreplay (%AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker/Replays) and if you can find it the hdt log (%AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker/Logs) of that game?\nYou can just paste those paths in the run dialog (Win+R).\n. Thank you. This should be fixed now for the next update.\n. Likely #2103 \n. @erismo Can you check if you still have the log of that game? options > tracker > settings > open appdata folder, in Logs. \n. Wait... You played paladin, not your opponent, right? That should not have displayed the secret list in the first place. \nThe log looks like things got messed up (HDT seemed rather confused as to who was who in that game), eventually resulting in what happened in your second post.\nIn addition to that I also tried reproducing this today without any success (just as culinko). \nSo I'm gonna consider this a non-issue for now. Do let me know if you see this happen again.\n. Seen this one before, sadly no clue what's causing it.\nTry updating your graphics card driver if possible.\n. That's planned, yes.\n. Progess:\n- [x] distinguish games\n- [x] distinguish decks\n- [x] filter decks\n- [x] filter cards\n. Added  with v0.14.4.\n. If your collection changed since you first set up constructed importing, you have to run the setup again to let HDT know which cards are on the first page for each class. \nTo do that: \n- enable advanced option (bottom left in options)\n- options > tracker > importing > set up constructed importing. Also read the last page for information on why it (almost) always imports too many or too few cards.\nI already explained to you why Innkeepers and HDT's importing work the way they do: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/2172#issuecomment-191406352.\n. Netdeck is a brower extension that allows for easier importing from websites.\nI think this works for firefox as well: https://netdeck.n4ru.it/browser-bookmarklet/\n. https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/Reporting-Issues\n. Should be fixed with the latest release?\n. No, I did mean the original issue. \nChanging the 'open appdata folder' behaviour doesn't make much sense, it does what it's supposed to do. An easy way for you to get to your installation would be to rightclick your shortcut and select \"open file location\".\n. This should be fixed with v0.14.0\n. Do you have logs of it failing to detect the new region when (re)starting HS?\n. Working on fixing this for the next release.\n@zaheer12a If the problem is permanent give this a shot.\n. Fixed with bde4e16.\n. Deleted the code comments. Quote andburn:\n\n@ShoestringTaz this is a reference to the piece of code that fixes the problem. It will be available with the next update to the tracker.\n. Please try if this helps: \n\nSync again, then create a new (empty) deck and delete it again. Restart HDT and check if the decks are still there.\n. Ok, please do this:\n1. Close HDT.\n2. open the AppData folder via options > tracker > settings > open appdata folder\n3. open the config.xml with any text editor\n4. change <LogLevel>0</LogLevel> to 1 (~line 175)\n5. start HDT again, then reproduce what I suggested previously\n6. post the log here (see here)\n. I didn't except it to work, I just need to see what happens :).\nCould you do that again but with force full sync this time? (Just force sync and then post the log again, that is)\n. Hm... this is a tough one.\nOne of the decks below has an issue where it references itself (probably as a version) somehow. \nLegendary Dragon Priest (Priest), Handlock (Warlock), Secrets Freeze Mage (Mage), Grim Patron Warrior (Warrior), Face Hunter (Hunter), Elemental Lord Shaman (Shaman), Demonlock (Warlock), Legend Secret Pally (Paladin)\nThe \"easiest\" way this could be solved might be (I'm not 100% sure this will work) to disable HEARTHSTATS > AUTO DELETE DECKS and AUTO DELETE GAMES, then do this:\n1. Force sync.\n2. Delete one of the decks.\n3. Restart HDT.\n4. Check if the other ones are still there. If not, back to 1 and try the next one.\nIf the deck are still there:\n1. Force sync again to get the deck back.\n2. Rightclick the corrupted deck > clone > selected version (important not to clone all versions).\n3. Select the corrupted deck in the deck picker (not the clone).\n4. STATS > [OLD] GAMES & STATISTICS > Deck > Games, select all games (ctrl+A).\n5. move to other deck, select the clone.\n6. Make sure all games are now correctly moved to the new deck, then enable the previously disabled hearthstats options again and delete the deck.\n. Hm...\nAre new locally created decks still there after restarting? (without force sync in that session)\n. Try this:\n1. On your laptop: select the decks and delete them on hearthstats via HEARTHSTATS > DELETE SELECTED DECK, then sync again. \n2. On your pc: force sync\n. Great, that's good to hear!\n. On the left hand side you can see all the action of that game. You can click those (and scroll through them with arrow-down) to get the state of the game at that point. It's not an automatic replay. \n. - Make sure Hearthstone is actually set to the resolution it \"pretends\" to be (check the options menu).\n- Resolutions that cause black bars at any of the sides cause rank detection to fail.\n- Screen dimming software is a possible issue.\nIf it's neither of those, please make screenshots in a ranked game via options (enable advanced) > hotkeys > game screenshot and screenshot (both!) and post those here.\n. @2percenter See if you have any outstanding windows updates. If so, try installing those.\n@bancron Try re-installing .NET Framework 4.5. If that does not help please also post the crash report here, it's most likely a different issue.\n. Oh? You should usually have 4.6 on Win10 by default. Try updating that then.\n. Already possible with display (deck/overlay) and arena, will of course also come for constructed with the rework on that.\n. So, adding one item for Past X days (needs better phrasing) that spawns a input text box should cover all of this. That would be fine I suppose.\n. Closing in favor of https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/692#issuecomment-213521877\n. See https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/692#issuecomment-194408494\n. See step 1 and 2 here: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/FAQ#not-working\n. Please restart HDT and Hearthstone, then reproduce the problem again and post the log here.\n. use no deck mode should be a lot better with v0.14.0 now.\n. Especially with standard/wild coming soon, this probably won't see much use.\n. Do you have windows error reporting enabled? If not, please do enable it.\nSee here: http://www.tomsguide.com/faq/id-2322283/disable-error-reporting-windows-laptop.html\n. Currently there's no way around that. \nThere's a chance games get saved to default in that case, check STATS > GAMES & STATISTICS > Overall > Games, for the Games filter select Without deck or All. If the game is there you can move it to the correct deck via the move to other deck button at the bottom.\n. Point 1 and 2 here should solve your problem: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/FAQ#not-working\n. Could you try if it works with this version: https://github.com/Epix37/HDT-Test/releases/tag/v0.13.15_PRE2\n. Try restoring the latest (one the one before that) backup under options (advanced) > tracker > backups.\n. No worries :) you're welcome.\n. Will be fixed with the next release (https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/097e0f7d95c07119770957946afbe260e01a84d4).\n. Please restart Hearthstone and HDT, reproduce the problem (collection > open deck > back to menu > import) and then post the log here - see here.\n. Just follow the instructions here: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/Setting-up-the-log.config\n. There is no coding involved. All you have to do is paste some text into a file.\n. Is options > overlay > general > hide card-age enabled?\n. Working on it!\n. Crap. \"artist\" only works with the english client.\n. Making sure I got all the \"artist\" translations correct now. \n(Updating HS like 12 times, fun...)\nv0.13.15 should be out in a few hours\n. Pre-release is out.\nDownload it here or enable options (advanced) > tracker > settings > check for BETA updates and restart HDT.\n. Do any of the standard suggestions help with that?\n. Good. Any other issue with the pre-release aside from cards not being added to the deck (e.g. elise)?\n. My best guess is your hearthstone client can't keep up. Try settings the exporting speed to slow / very slow.\n. Ok, I'm fairly certain then that it is due to a performance problem on your end. Not much I can do to fix that sadly.\nIf you want, you can try slowing it down even further by editing the DeckExportDelay value in the config (options > tracker > settings > open appdata folder, config.xml).\n. @ThorsAngerVaNeT see #2260 for that issue. Will be fixed with the next release.\n. Looking very nice! Doesn't cause any problems as far as I can see. \nCould you optipng the images?\n. Found and fixed the problem.\nThere should be a new release later today.\n. Time to update then :).\nYou can either download it manually via the link about or restart HDT and you should be promted to update.\n. Assuming you have a deck selected, cards always get added to yours deck automatically. (Does currently not work for no-deck mode)\nInclude obtained cards refers to cards that were added to the hand, rather than the deck. I guess I could clarify that a bit.\n. You can change the secret size under options (advanced) > overlay > opponent > secret scaling.\n. Those are currently not synced, correct. \nYou mean there are constructed decks created on hearthstats when you create a new arena run in HDT? If so, I think that's an issue on the HearthStats end.\n. \"They\" being mostly me, not sure. I'll look into it.\n@trigun0x2 I think arena decks appearing in constructed is an issue on your end.\n. I was able to reproduce this for one game, then restarted HDT and Hearthstone to get to debugging and everything works fine again. So.. not sure, give that a try I suppose.\nIf you can still reproduce the problem please post the log here.\n. Please try if you still have the problem with this version: https://github.com/Epix37/HDT-Test/releases/tag/v0.13.17_PRE1\n. This should be fixed with v0.13.17.\n. Could you upload the replays of those games? You can find them under options > tracker > settings > open appdata folder /Replays.\n. I think I found the problem. Please try if that still happens with this version: https://github.com/Epix37/HDT-Test/releases/tag/v0.13.17_PRE1\n. This should be fixed with v0.13.17.\n. Could you play a game where after the counter would update, then post the log? See here.\n. Please try if you still have the problem with this version: https://github.com/Epix37/HDT-Test/releases/tag/v0.13.17_PRE1\n. This should be fixed with v0.13.17.\n. What are your systems DPI settings set to?\n. Does the overlay have the same problem?\n. The list of the left are cards that were played, not drawn/created in hand.\nDoing this is something along the lines of #1351 #1995 and requires a lot of hardcoding for special interactions, i.e. a lot of work. \n. Closing in favor #2224.\n. See #2221\n. This should be fixed with v0.13.17.\n. That happens only when HDT is running?\nTry starting Hearthstone (with and without window mode), then HDT. \n. \"uninstalled\" as in removing the log.config?\n. That is, running HDTUninstaller and removing the Hearthstone logging? Otherwise, if you just removed the files you unzipped.. this would be very strange.\nCan you try it with Hearthstone set to windowed mode?\n. See if you have any outstanding windows or graphics card driver updates.\n. Having uninstalled everthing to the point where Hearthstone is working: Does doing this cause the same problem?\n. No that's indeed a bit weird. I would not have come up with it, good to know though!\nGlad you got it working :).\n. See #2179.\n. Closing in favor of #2250\n. Most likely the same problem as  for #2006.\n. Fixed with v0.14.0.\n. Are the cards, card counter, ... options under options > overlay > player/opponent enabled? options (advanced) > overlay > player/opponent > opacity set to max?\nIf so... this is very strange. Please post the hdt log and your latest backup (options > tracker > backups > show backup directory).\n. Not really sure what's going on there. Were you able to resolve it? Try clicking the \"reset\" button below \"unlock\".\n. Did you try everything I suggested here?\n. - options > overlay > general > hide decks enabled?\n- try resetting the overlay via options > overlay > general > reset\n- check if you see the deck regions when you unlock the overlay (button above reset)\n- try completely resetting the config by renaming the config.xml in %AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker (options > tracker > settings > open appdata folder) to anything else. make sure to close hdt before doing so.\n. If none of the suggestions here work I'm out of ideas on what the problem could be, sorry.\n. :+1:\n. You can find it under options (advanced) > overlay> interactivity. Checkbox in the bottom left enables advanced options.\n. - Could you post screenshots of that?\n- Try downloading the latest version and see if using a clean install helps. (You'll still have all your decks/stats even if you unzip it in a different location)\n- What are your systems DPI settings at? Try changing those.\n. You did not have any of these problems at versions before v0.13.17?\n. I think I got this mostly solved now. The next update should fix this.\n. Here's the latest build: https://github.com/Epix37/HDT-Test/releases/tag/v0.13.18_PRE1\nPlease let me know if there are any remaining DPI related problems.\nAny feedback on card themes and animations is also appreciated!\n. Fixed with v0.14.0.\n. Not too sure why that happens.. How long have you been using HDT? Could be an issues with configs that were created before DefaultValues existed.\nThere is no v0.13.18, v0.13.17 is the latest release.\n. Fixed with v0.14.0.\n. Fixed with v0.13.18\n. Most likely the same problem as #2165.\n. Fixed with v0.14.0.\n. - I don't want to rely on using IPs if not necessary, so for anything but china config should be the preferred method.\n- You don't need to specifically call Helper.GetCurrentRegion at this point, it is called on game start and stored in Game.CurrentRegion. The region can't change while the game is running.\n- Why the changes to Helper.GetRegionByServerIp?\n. It does enter more than just the cardname, namely the artist and cost values to void running such as 'Charge' (warrior spell) also showing everything that has a 'Charge' effect. That shouldn't cause any problems however.\nWhat version are you using? Since Hearthstone 4.2.0 you need v0.13.17 for exporting to work.\nAnother possibility is that is there are problem clearing the mana crystal. You can work around that by increasing the start delay under options (advanced) > tracker > exporting or disabling auto clear filters.\n. Are you using any screen dimming software?\nDoes hearthstone have black bars at any of the sides?\n. Please do this then:\n- Set up hotkeys for Screenshot and Game screenshot (options (advanced )> tracker > hotkeys).\n- Play a game to where the left list is covering most of the friendslist.\n- Take a screenshot with each of the hotkeys, with and without the friendslist open.\n- Post those here, along with the log of the game: see here.\n. Unless changed, all data is saved in %AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker. In that case the installation can be deleted without a problem, running a new one will pick up on all the data.\n. Could be the same problem rank detection has: https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/FAQ#ranked\n. Closing this for now then.\n. Happens because in-hand highlighting works based on CardIds rather than entities. Only an issue if cards are separated for some reason (e.g. 'include created'). Not sure if this is worth fixing.\n. This should be fixed with v0.14.0\n. What would be the reason one would want to do this? It would probably not make for very good \"statistics\", so.. mainly for replays?\n. Without spoiling too much, there should soon be a feature that should fit your needs pretty well. Stay tuned :wink:.\n. Since we only have the name, not the full battletag, I think that might not be possible in a reliable fashion.\n. @riQQ yeah, maybe. however not a feature I see happening anytime soon. \n. Now that's just not true. Almost every chance I get I say this feature is very far from perfect but it sadly is as good as it gets when it comes to importing constructed decks without reading the game memory. There is next to no information in the game logs about constructed decks.\nTry re-running setup via options (advanced) > tracker > importing > set up constructed importing.\n. Constructed importing works by checking the logs for unloaded assets (card images) when exiting the collection screen. This has two main problems:\n1) Each image is only unloaded once, meaning determining the count of cards is not possible\n2) The collection pages (on the left) also contain cards that get unloaded and there is no way to differentiate between those cards and the cards that were in a deck.\n(I think there also were some additional issues where golden cards get unloaded separately)\nThe second point is why the importing asks you to open all the first class pages - to see which cards get unloaded from them, so that those cards can be ignored when actually trying to import decks.\nThis means, when your collection changes, there is a chance the cards on the first page also change and with that HDT will ignore the wrong cards unless the setup in run again.\nSo the longer you use HDT (and the more your collection changes) the worse importing will get until the setup is re-run. And even then, this method is just wonky period.\nHope that sheds some light on the problem.\n. See #2234 about the first problem.\nThe second should hopefully be fixed with https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/3f1725bb6883428cab3eb2febf375e9584c45610. If you are not on china servers, check if it currently works after the second game.\n. Still an issue with v0.14.0?\n. Since those are cached values, that probably won't work once you open a card for the second time or have seen it before in your collection.\n. Done!\nI have avoided this so far because it looked awkward with cards popping in/out, for the opponent deck and when in no-deck mode or having the \"remove at count 0\" option enabled. \nSince that is no longer the case (the next update will have nice fading and update animations for the cards :smile:), this is a very good idea. \n. Added with v0.14.0.\n. Can not reproduce this. \nConceded a game in ranked, constructed and practice, with modes disabled under options > tracker > stats > record, none were recorded.\nAre you using the latest version? An issue like this was fixed with v0.13.13. See #2107.\n. From the log it looks like the stolen Elise was never played. Could either be a bug with entomb or a random issue where HDT missed something in the log for some reason.\n. Should be fixed with v0.14.0\n. I think this might be the same problem: #2186, please see if you find a solution there.\n. No worries.\nNot really sure what's causing it, no. Somehow decks can sometimes (rarely?) reference themselves as versions, preventing saving it (or anything else) to file.\n. 1. Thats after deleting the newest one?\n2. Do you have replay files / hdt logs for that?\n3. #2255\n. The arena issue should be fixed with v0.14.0.\n. What version of Windows and localization are you on? \nIs your ctrl key swapped with something else? \n. What's your system,  keyboard and HDT language set to? \nDoes switching the keyboard language to English help? \n. Was #262 ever a problem for you?\nI was under the assumption that it was a general problem and changed exporting to copy-paste by default for non-latin languages. \nIf you did not have that problem, reverting that change is probably the easiest solution.\n. Slim chance I found a better solution that reverting the change. Can you try exporting with this version: https://github.com/Epix37/HDT-Test/releases/tag/v0.13.18_PRE2_exporting\n. Oh it does? I did not really expect that. Great, thanks for testing.\n. Try running the setup again: options (advanced) > tracker > importing > set up constructed importing.\n. Closing in favor of #2250.\n. Do you have a hotkey set with ctrl+something?\n. Seems to be an issue with .NET: https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/2455692/system-notsupportedexception-unbekanntes-modifierkeys-element-strg-when-loading-wpf-application-on-net-460267\nSee if you can up or downgrade your .NET Framework installation.\n. Try clean/rebuild.\n. See https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/2281#issuecomment-203767750\n. Got the reordering fixed. \nCould you also post the deck you were using? export > screenshot > upload is probably the easiest way.\n. Sorry, and the cards that are missing? I.e. the ones the overlay warning contained. \nApparently I'm not logging that for some reason.\n. Alright, i updated the pre-release download again. \nI'm not sure I entirely solved the problem but I do think I may have isolated it well enough. Let me know if you are still having the same problems with the current download.\n. Did you actually draw cards that were not in the deck in that case? Deck detection works by checking if the drawn cards match the selected deck, so with the same class and especially before mulligan there is a chance it won't trigger. \n. Hm.. see if that problem remains. It seems to working fine for me.\n. The deck list still shows the wrong deck as selected, but it is correct in the game overlay, yes?\nIf it's only highlighted (selected) in the deck list but it does not say 'ACTIVE' and the name is not bold, then that's fine. \n. Could you post the logs of those games?\n(I'm going to bed for now, I'll have a look tomorrow.)\n. epix@hsdecktracker.net\n. Alright, I just spent about 13 hours rewriting basically the whole game state and deck tracking system.\nGive this a shot: https://github.com/Epix37/HDT-Test/releases/tag/v0.13.18.3\nI'm fairly confident the deck selection is fixed. There might be a few new issues (cards getting removed from deck lists/not appearing), but it seems to be ok for the most part. Card animations when going grayed out to normal are a bit wonky.\nLet me know how this one works for you.\n. I think there might be something weird going on with your hearthstone logging or config. \nTry this: \n- Close HDT and Hearthstone\n- Run \"HDTUninstaller.exe\" and remove the Hearthstone Logging\n- Go to \"%AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker\" (paste into Run dialog or explorer address bar), rename the \"config.xml\" to anything else\n- Go [Hearthstone Install Dir]/Logs, delete everything\n- Try again\n. Here's a fix for the crash: https://github.com/Epix37/HDT-Test/releases/tag/v0.13.18.4\n. Try running it without changing any default settings, see if you still have the problems.\n. You can delete the new config.xml then and rename your old one back. (Close HDT before doing that)\nIt seems HDT thinks your setup phase is done before it even started. \n- There is a slim chance this is some weird .NET issue, try updating/reinstalling your .NET Framework installation.\n- Try running HDT from a \"clean installation\" i.e. not overwriting the old files\n- Please email me the \"Power.log\" file from the \"Hearthstone/Logs\" folder after a game or two\n. I think I managed to fix it. Here goes nothing: https://github.com/Epix37/HDT-Test/releases/tag/v0.13.18.5\nI was able to reproduce the problem consistently and now I no longer can, so that's something I hope.\n(also fixed the above posted crash)\n.

That's fixed for the next update, not sure if this is the same problem though.\n. I mean I'm not sure it did not work in this case because of the reconnect detection. Could have other reasons. But I guess we will see.\nGonna close this for now. There should be another pre-relase today and probably a full release later this week.\n. Outdated.\n. See https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/FAQ#not-working\n. explained here https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/Setting-up-the-log.config\n. If that is set up correctly any you have no log files created/updated in <HearthstoneDir>\\Logs, it's likely the same problem as #2265.\n. Pasting %LocalAppData%/Blizzard/Hearthstone in the Run dialog is the quickest way of opening that location, is all.\n. Have a look at #2265. Sounds like you're having the same problem.\n. The log.config should not change when un/re-installing hearthstone I think.\n. HDT get's 99% of it's information from the files in Hearthstone/Logs, if Hearthstone does not create/update those HDT can't work :/.\n. This seems to be a pretty rare case, usually Hearthstone creates the logs just fine. \nNo idea why it happens. Probably something machine specific in your end.\n. You're welcome. Too bad it didn't end up working. I would be interested to know if the blizzard support would be willing to help you out with this. I doubt it though.\n@jleclanche any idea why Hearthstone might not create log files?\n. Great! Happy to hear you made it work.\nAnd thank you for getting back to be with how!\n. Try explicitly setting a resolution in hs and/or starting hdt as administrator. \n. What list are you talking about? Opponent? Player? With, without deck?\nCreated minions are now only visible in deck lists while in hand or deck (the former requires options > overlay > player > highlight cards in hand to be enabled), no longer when they were played. The reasoning being that is that there is not information to be gained by seeing cards that were not actually in the opponent/player deck after they are no longer relevant (i.e. already played). And it keeps the deck lists a lot cleaner.\nThere are special cases where those cards could be relevant, like when playing against mill rogue - that is something that would fit in well with a feature like #961.\n. You still can get that information from the state of the list it is now, can't you? If the card is not in the list it was from discover. Another way of telling would be to see if he previously had a card marked as created in his hand and now no longer does.\nThe last release before v0.14.0 was one v0.13.17: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/releases\n. Closing in favor of #961.\n. Fixed the issue where the choice from the initial dialog is not saved properly.\n@TemporalOnline do you have that problem with other settings as well? It might be that your config is just not saving for whatever reason. The theme saved just fine for me every time.\n@Gr3yz No, sorry. Also ChunkFive is not even remotely close to comic sans.\n. fixed with v0.14.1\n. I don't think this is something that would fine use in too many scenarios. You can just press Win+D at the end of your turn to minimize everything.\n. You could also play Hearthstone in windowed mode and press the minimize button.\nI don't really see a point in adding this, sorry.\n. \"Show main window\" does not refer to Hearthstone, it opens bring the HDT window to foreground.\nMy main reason for not wanting to do this is that this is a very specialized use case that maybe 0.01% (if that) of users will ever use. Plus there are easy workarounds for it.\nJust because I have features that sort of fit the same category, doesn't necessarily mean I want to add more of those. I would much rather get rid of a lot of things, but taking features away is most of the time not very appreciated. :).\n. You can change the scaling via options (advanced) > tracker > player/opponent\u00b0\n. This is working as intended currently. See my explanation in #2286.\n. I think returned currently only work for created (i.e. not drawn) cards.\nThose got caught in the crossfire when trying to make sure HDT doesn't display any information leaks. \nFixed with https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/1c4f7fc8c79e1b89a15cc51dfbd6787561cc84d3 and https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/6d24f19693faf1ba3a95e3ef306464c83ad5ebba.\n. fixed with v0.14.1\n. #2292\n. What do you mean by scaling? The automatic vertical scaling when there's too many cards or options (advanced) > overlay > player/opponent > scaling? The latter looks completely fine to me even at 60% scaling. Please post a screenshot of your issue.\n. Uhm.. there's a small chance it gets better when you set it to 79% or 81%. \nI think I can see what you mean, but there's a good chance that's just to the image being a jpg. The \"old\" screenshot looks just as blurry to me.\nEven then, there's nothing I can do about this, sorry. The font only has that one style.\n. The darkening will be less opaque will the next update (https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/f65247c32a96a083306ae71d636536319aab72b4). Making the green a bit more distinct. \nHave the green text darkened as well was an intended change though. It looks very out of place in the new themes otherwise.\nAn easy workaround you can do right now: Download this image and use it to replace the dark.png in Hearthstone Deck Tracker/Images/Themes/Bars/dark\n. fixed/improved with v0.14.1\n. This is with v0.14.0? Please provide screenshots / logs.\n. Is this still an issue with v0.14.0 then? \n. Closing this for now. Let me know if it happens again.\n. This is with v0.14.0? Please provide screenshots / logs.\n. Is this still an issue with v0.14.0 then? \n. Replays never had those indicators. The current replay viewer will also become obsolete soon and will therefore not be fixed/updated anymore.\n. The first screenshot is the \"show opponent deck\" button rather than the overlay during a game? That is already covered in #890 then.\n. Closing this for now (since it's with an old version). Let me know if you see the overlay part of this problem happen again.\n. Restarting hearthstone should solve the friends list error message.\nSee if setting a start delay or changing hearthstone to windows mode helps with the export.\n. Doesn't the game already do that in the bottom left? \n. I don't think there's much point in adding that, sorry. \nAsk blizzard to make it more readable :P. \n. Well, it seemed to be too easy to be true. Guess it was. \nIt will currently just decrease while the buff is in play. For some reason I thought the buff would get removed after Thaurissan is dead, which, of course it does not.\n. The values will now:\n- only increment if Thaurissan is still in play and not silenced\n- update at the start of the player turn, instead of the start of the next opponents turn\n. Fixed with v0.14.4.\n. :+1:\n. @Rembound could this be arena helper?\n. I was rather thinking that Arena Helper could have created duplicate arena runs (in combination with the HDT auto arena importing). \n. Thanks for the clarification rembound.\nNot sure what this is about then, but since you managed to work around it I'm gonna close this for now.\nLet me know if this persists to be a problem.\n. Why not post this in #2250 then? Closing in favor of that one.\nI'll take a look later, but just from looking at the code, saving that data should work fine. Maybe it just imported the same collection? Try modifying the original one before running it.\n. keep stats when deleting decks will keep the games under [old] games & statistics, however the arena statistics/runs are bound to the existence of decks. \nRather than deleting arena decks, you can just archive them. That keeps your list clean and the decks alive.\nIf you recently deleted a multitude of decks, you can revert to a backup under options (advanced) > tracker > backups.\n. Added an explanation (tool tip) for what the option exactly does.\n. Try increasing the start delay in options (advanced) > tracker > exporting. If that doesn't help, you can disable auto clear filters.\n. Try if running HDT as admin has any effect. \nBut yea. if that's not working I'm not sure how I would even go about fixing this. There's not much I can do beyond sending clicks/keystrokes.\n. Closing this for now.\n. string is a special case when it comes to the  == operator: if both sides are of type string, it always resolves to Equals. \nBesides that, using str.Equals(str2) is vulnerable to throw NullReferenceExceptions. The \"safe\" way to do it would be to use string.Equals(str1, str2), but that is exactly what the == operator does with two strings.\n. You can find the HearthDb library here: https://github.com/HearthSim/HearthDb\nCardSet has no names that are of any help, but HDT has HearthDbConverter.SetConverter method that turns those into the proper strings.\n. There is no way to change the font, nor are there currently plans for reverting the change or adding customization, sorry. \nYou'll get used to it :).\n. You should be able to just manually download it (as you did) and overwrite all the files. Make sure to actually extract the zip before running it.\n. Very strange. Glad you made it work though.\n. :+1:\n. Please provide logs (see here) and screenshots.\n. Closing for lack of response.\n. I agree with jleclanche here, enum duplication is not the way to go. At least if it's completely decoupled from HearthDb. Some wrapper that makes the set names more readable could be an option.\nEnums should also not have names containing underscores and words starting with lowercase. Solving this with attributes seems like the cleanest way to me: see here for reference - converter.\nThe point of HearthDb as a separate library was to be able to make it reusable and license it under MIT. Using it is the whole point of having it :).\n. Yes, HearthDb uses the same enums Hearthstone does. \n. You can manually add games via STATS > GAMES & STATISTICS > Deck > Games > add new game.\n. @ko-vasilev Does this break the collection tracker plugin?\nCan we somehow avoid that? Leave the old enum in as obsolete?\n. #2301\n. Closing in favor of #757. \nI sadly still have no idea why this happens.\n. #2301\n. I think this is correct.  \nThe cards in the list are the one still in the deck, likely those you mulliganed. v0.14 no longer displays created cards in the list unless they are in your deck or in you hand and 'include obtained cards'  is enabled. \nThe deck/hand counters all display the correct values. \n. I assume off of unstable portal? Then that's still working as intended (though I agree not optimal right now).\n. If not, this might also be related to the issue where the player list stops updating in some cases after mulligan. That's fixed with https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/f33c52758450b7701f97acf4fd6631e3dd3622fb.\n. Right. Probably the second thing I mentioned then.\n. All the cards in this brawl are \"created\" (the decks are swapped), so this is technically correct behavior.\nThe ability to show created cards in the list after they leave the deck/hand will be added in some fashion with #961.\nClosing in favor of #961.\n. I can squish the commits for you, no problem.\nI'm not sure making the old enum obsolete actually solves the problem though, I was waiting on a response from @ko-vasilev. :)\n. I was hoping there would be a way we could avoid breaking it, but I guess not huh?\n. Hm yeah... I can't really think of a way to make it work other than introducing a new property for the HearthDb Rarity and leaving the old one in as obsolete - which is not a good soluition.\nThis is not a change I want to break plugin compatibility for I think.\nMy suggestions now would be to leave this open until I have to break compatibility anyway (if I decide to update MahApps at some point for example).\n. I'm mainly concerned about the user experience. Everyone would have to manually update again. \n. might as well merge this now I guess\n. Merged as https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/294d737e6482ec897f3d8ba81d3859cff20dfbce.\n. Same as #757.\n. This does (should?) happen.\n. Just tried it to make sure this is indeed working, v0.14.1 does this.\n. The 'S' has been removed a long time ago, as were sources because they were not reliable. \nYou can find here what is currently displayed. \nSources will not come back, but something better will be added eventually, see https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/2224.\n. The rest of the translations come from automatically generated files. I wont be manually adding those.\nThis could either happen with #471, or if full card tool tips are added eventually.\n. You can turn off auto deck detection at the bottom of the deck picker.\n. Auto deck detection means it automatically tries to switch to the correct deck.\n. Could you post a log of this happening? See here: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/Reporting-Issues\n. @TemporalOnline (and @wodorost, if you want ;)) Try this release and let me know if that fixes it. \nI fixed the only issue related to auto deck switching and versions I could find. Lets hope that's the one.\n. Should be fixed with v0.14.4\n. See #1986 for why this won't be added to HDT.\nHowever, there is a plugin (I don't officially promote ;)) that does this: https://github.com/ko-vasilev/hearthstone-autosquelch\n. So does hdt crash over and over? Do you have any crash reports you could upload? \n. There should be a crash reports folder with the exe.\n. Huh.. how then did blizzard support come to the conclusion that hdt keeps crashing? Does that actually happen? \n. No problem. Good luck :/.\n. :+1: \n. See https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/FAQ#not-working\n. Closing due to lack of response.\n. I think this is the one you are looking for: options > tracker > overlay > player > wins\n. Try \n- speficially setting a resolution in Hearthstone\n- running Hearthstone in windowed mode / fullscreen\n- running HDT as administrator\n. See #1691\n. Same as #757.\n. Are the game modes you are trying to record enabled under options > tracker > stats > record?\n. With what game mode does this happen? Ranked?\nIf you have recording enabled for ranked, but not casual, it could be this problem: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/FAQ#ranked\n. What about black bars?\nTry changing the resolution and/or windowed/fullscreen mode.\n. Try enabling recording casual games, see if that at least saves the games. \n. Possible. HDT will auto enable alt screen capture if the default method fails. Try disabling it with the changed resolution.\n. Awesome! :)\n. Should be fixed by https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/5a25bc54665c8e7266ebbd6687e5834afe6e89cb. Closing for lack of response.\n. Never heard of this before.\nMaybe try reinstalling .NET Framework.\n. Video card driver and/or Windows updates could also help. \n. Great :).\n. - Anyfin plugin: https://github.com/ericBG/AnyfinCalculator\n- Graveyard: #868\n. Fixed :+1:\nGame.IsMulliganDone will still not update instantly, just due to the way player identification works after reconnect, but does now on the next opponent draw.\n. Could you post the corresponding Arena.log and hdt_log.txt files? (see here for the latter)\n. Neither list contains a single Snowchugger (GVG_002) - something doesn't make sense here. And if it was completely missing the list should show 27 cards, not 28.\n. This only happens when you import a existing arena run and you still get those 28 cards when you import manually via IMPORT > FROM ARENA right?\nI don't think this is worth trying to fix. There's probably not much I could do anyway if the data is missing from the log.\nEdit: Drafting a fresh deck works fine because it auto imports once 30 cards are reached. While drafting cards are always logged after they were picked.\n. Duplicate of #757.\n. HDT can't automatically start with Hearthstone. The setting you enabled works the other way around: It will attempt to start Hearthstone when you start HDT.\n. Does one of the decks HDT is switching between have more than one version?\n. Could you upload the logs of that happening? See here: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/Reporting-Issues\n. Yes, it's ChunkFive.\n. This is a bug in the game, Flame Leviathan is always revealed even when not drawn.\n. - Download the latest release here: https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/releases\n- Overwrite your current installation with the new files\n. Arena runs are only uploaded. See #1691.\nThere's no data saved in the installation folder. If you have backup of the \"%AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker\" folder, you can restore that, yes. \n. See #2286\n. Try running HDT as admin.\nOtherwise see here: https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/FAQ#exporting\n. More specifically: go to %AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker (Win+R, paste) and delete the PlayerDecks.xml file. If there is a PlayerDecks_backup.xml, rename it to PlayerDecks.xml. Otherwise go to the \"Backups\" folder and replace it with the PlayerDecks.xml from the latest zip.\n. Implemented with #2775\n. I need the hdt log, Power.log and Net.log (Hearthstone/Logs) of this.\n. Oh, this might be fixed with https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/445101bbbf40bef9016a6a6ebb49a8cc98431b6a\nTry the 14.3 pre-release: https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/releases/tag/v0.14.3\n. Is this still an issue?\n. Let me know if this is still an issue with v0.15.4.\n. Pre-release: https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/releases/tag/v0.14.3\n. If it worked any different, you would not able to tell which what the first secret was after the second was played. See #2338 for further explanation. \nNot a bug.\n. It checks on start.\n. These kind of questions are better suited for gitter: https://gitter.im/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker\n. I though I excluded arena decks. Oops, fixed that.\nBrawl showing up in constructed is working as intended. For all intents and purposes, those are constructed decks/games.\nIf you try to enter a too high season (e.g. 30) it will tell you what the current maximum number is.\nNo to the rest for now.\n. Duplicate #757\n. Currently it is only visible when the 'active deck only' filter is enabled. I changed it to be always visible now.\n. Updated with v0.14.4\n. Added the cancel button. \nNot too sure on the rest though. E.g. if you set the default operation to 'save', you would have to look for an option to be able to upload it. The 'upload' default behaviour you describe is another example of this just not working well. Don't I think this is a good idea.\nI have nothing against being able to set an imgur account, but it's not something I have time to do. If anyone wants to PR - feel free.\n. Added new screenshot dialog with v1.3. Can you be more specific than \"sometimes\"?\n. What kind of decks specifically\n. That's the kind of info I need :).\nFixed.\n. Has been fixed with https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/808705e8b6caf2143497ab13e631e57549596685\n. Well, that's why the speed options exist I guess. Works perfectly fine for me even at 20ms.\n. uncheck Sort/Filter (button right next to wild) > include 'standard' decks in 'wild'\n. Please provide screenshots/logs for the tracking issue. See here: https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/FAQ\nSwitching to no deck mode is not a good idea. If anything, the list should show [Legendaries (7)]. See #961.\n. See here: https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/FAQ#hdt-is-not-starting--crashing-at-start-up-how-do-i-fix-this\n. :+1: \n. Added the missing pack option. Thanks.\nSource on the 3rd pack? Patch notes only say this: \n\nAdditionally, you are slightly more likely to receive a second card pack from a different Standard set.\n. yeah, that's exactly what the patch notes say. I doubt you can get a 3rd pack.\n. Fixed with v0.14.5\n. This, along with a counter C'Thun, is planned for the next update - probably tomorrow.\n. Added with v0.14.5\n. options (advanced) > overlay > interactivity\n. Duplicate #2380\n. This looks like an issue with NetDeck. @n4ru\n\n\"NOOO...\" is just a unknown (not found) card.\n. Fixed with v0.14.5\n. As far as I can tell, there is no clear way to tell the format from the logs. \nCurrently it's purely based on cards played / deck selected. If either the deck is not standard viable or any non-created wild card was revealed, it's set to wild.\nThe two mediocre options I can think of right now:\n- use image recognition in the TOURNAMENT screen\n- use the asset log (I would prefer not to)\n. Fixed with v0.15\n. Perfect, thank you.\nMerged as https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/f60cfa45745f1945695cca38efedfdabe49e7e05.\n. Works fine for me. Are wild ranked games recorded as ranked for you? Either way see if any of this helps: https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/FAQ#ranked\n. :+1:\n. The cardDB files are no longer used.\n. #2380\n. https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/2384\nLeaving this one open for now so we don't get 10 more of these :).\n. There will be an update in a few hours.\n. Fixed with v0.14.5\n. fixed with https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/fbdc37e3fed808baedea41bde5c08898fb033021\n. Fixed with v0.14.5\n. This was fixed with v0.14.5. Closing Hearthstone should start a update check.\nHowever, you have to import the decks again, as they were saved without a class.\n. Oops! That's what happens when you (me) restart HDT at least once every game :P.\nFixed with v0.14.6: https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/releases/tag/v0.14.6\n. - It will re-appear if C'Thun is added to the deck again.\n- If C'Thun was played, in 99% of cases you can safely assume any effect will trigger.\n- You can set it to always on under options > overlay > player/opponent.\n. Yes, always on is always on.\n. It might be fine to keep it visible while C'Thun is on board/dead. Not sure.\n. Try downloading the latest release (here) and not overwriting the existing files (i.e. install it in a different location). You will keep all your data.\n. 1. was \"auto\" actually enabled?\n2. #2319 / #961\n. Can you reproduce it?\n. Oh, I see why the brawl thing happens. All cards in the current brawl are created after the initial cards in the deck and therefore ignored when it comes to auto deck detection. \nNot sure how to fix that. This is the cause of both of these problem though.\n. Turns out I actually managed to fix both of those problems now!\n. This happens because 1-5 allow you to add cards to deck. \nPressing shift will now block that.\n. Could you rephrase what you mean? Do you mean detecting the cards using image recognition?\n. I currently track the PROXY. Not sure why it would be created.\n. The proxy is not created until a RITUAL card is played. I assumed it would not create the proxy if there was no C'Thun. No logs yet.\n. Well crap, this is from a game without C'Thun in the deck: http://pastebin.com/VnXtN8iL\nKind of interesting though, this means if you obtain C'Thun by other means later in the game, it will have all the buffs regardless.\nAs for this issue: Preventing the counter from showing, if a active deck without C'Thun is used should solve most cases. I can't think a way to prevent it from showing when playing without a deck or if the opponent has no C'Thun.\n. Figured it out: SEEN_CTHUN player tag only gets set when it's revealed, i.e. there is a C'Thun in the deck.\n. Because you have options > overlay > deck **windows** > player enabled there.\n. Do this:\n1. go to options > tracker > settings\n2. click open appdata folder\n3. close HDT\n4. delete the config.xml file in that folder\n5. start HDT again\n. #2386\n. This is rather strange. Everything, including malwarebytes, shows no detection on virustotal: https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/09a03837d1c327e0595cbada7c74b4a53aae3ab23658a3b28a21381a88c8f3d4/analysis/\n. I am very confused. I downloaded and ran MBAM over v0.14.6 - same thing. However, v0.14.5 comes out clean. This is the difference between v0.14.5 and v0.14.6. One line, resetting one variable. \nEven more confusing: the current dev build also comes out clean.\nNo idea what this is about, but I uploaded the current build for you guys here: https://github.com/Epix37/HDT-Test/releases/tag/v0.14.6_dev1\nHope you feel better using this one :).\n. I ran it 3 times now to make sure I got the right file, nothing. Maybe it still has that filename registered as \"bad\" on your end? Try removing it from quarantine under History > Quarantine.\n. Is that the correct file? The modified date on the exe should be of today.\n. Updated to v0.14.7 to hopefully prevent this from happening further.\n. See https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/FAQ#not-working\n. It should appear by default.\n- Is options > overlay > hide enabled?\n- Try enabling options (advanced) > tracker > settings > ~~alternative~~ advanced window search.\n. Did you check/try the two points I mentioned?\n. Did you guys try this? https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/Setting-up-the-log.config\nIf that doesn't help please post the log after playing a few games. See here: https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/Reporting-Issues\n. Did you actually play a game during the HDT session you just posted the log of?\n. HDT does find any logs to read from. Either the game path is set incorrectly or Hearthstone is not creating log files.\nhttps://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/FAQ#not-working\nDoublecheck point 3 and 4.\n. See here: https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/FAQ#ranked\n. Does it go back to normal if you enable options > overlay > hide (completely)?\n. Fixed. This is an issue with games recorded before v0.14.5, where a weapon was played. \nIt should work again with the next release.\n. You healing the Acolyte also made no C'Thun apper on the board for him, right? That's essentially the data HDT uses. \nThe C'Thun counter becomes visible when the corresponding player entity is tagged with SEEN_CTHUN, that tag is applied at the same time the C'Thun proxy shows up on the side of the board. \n. What I meant by \"not overwriting\" was to extract the files somewhere else, essentially a fresh installation. \nYour data is by defauled stored at \"%AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker\", so if you unzip is somewhere else and run it, you will still have all your data.\n. That is the correct answer. There is no good method for auto detecting whether the opponent is playing Yogg. The only idea was to use a minimum number of spells cast to show it, but that's not only too inconsistent but would also show the counter for many decks that don't actually contain Yogg.\nThe missing auto option is intended.\n. Hm.. not really sure why this is happening again :/. \nRelated: #2260 \n. I wish I could, but I don't really know why this is happening :/.\n.

Amazing, as always!\nTwo things don't quite fit in I think: \n- the pattern seems too noisy compared to the rest\n- the black background of the bottom most panel. Using the same dark gray as the fade/countbox might be better.\n\nRank (Not sure this belongs on a deck screenshot)\n Wins/Losses (Percentage) (Like rank doesn't seem right)\n\nI agree, doesn't belong.\n\nMake all extra info optional (More options?)\n\nAll or nothing is fine. Either adding a second screenshot button, something like SCREENSHOT (WITH INFO), or a dialog with both options and remember functionality should work.\n\nGets the first tag (or class if no tags), first tag could be anything, favorite etc. not really much can do about that\n\nThere's only a very limited number of \"highlevel' deck types (Aggro, Control, Midrange, ...) only checking for those should work. Maybe including Brawl too.\n\nIts another chunk of code that needs to be updated with new sets \n\nAdding a DeckSets control sounds like the best solution here. Something you can just pass the deck.\n. You mean on each card? I disagree. That would adds a lot of noise to the screenshot, make it inconsistent with the rest of the app and also make it a lot harder to identify the included sets (assuming they are removed from the bottom panel).\n. My point still stands and I still disagree. I want to have as little options as possible on this, it's not a feature that needs customization. \n. Arena, Brawl and Adventure (if tagged as such?) should replace the Standard/Wild text. Icons for each would be nice.\nI don't think the deck version adds any value here. These would mostly be created to be shared with other people, who don't care about your local deck revisions.\n. Adventure icon might be nice, not sure how many of those decks are actually tagged as such - might have too check for multiple tags (adventure, pve, maybe others). \nI think numbers of spells/minions would be too much here. \nOther than that, @andburn, should I look into merging this or are there any outstanding changes?\n. I think we might want to check for any tag containing \"pve\"  or \"adventure\". IIRC, the default hearthpwn tag is \"pve adventure\". \nI'm gonna go through the code tomorrow - maybe wait for that so you don't have to push new commits 10 times :). \n. I don't think supporting extra language is feasible here. There's a good chance the meta types will change with time - I don't really feel like maintaining that in 16 languages. Possibly when general localization is added.\n@andburn Add using static HearthDb.CardIds.Collectible in DeckScreenshotWindow and I think we're gtm!\n. Not for now,\n. :+1:\nMerged with https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/729fbb6ac951a6ad6d681b949b24993f5e4dd49c.\n.

Likely not something that will be supported by HDT, sorry.\nSee here for more info: https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues?q=is%3Aissue+deck+prediction+is%3Aclosed\n. Try re-installing .Net Framework 4.5.\n. Are you asking for continuous syncing or a one time transfer to another machine? It sounds a bit like the latter  and it that case all you need to do it copy the %AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker (options > tracker > settings > open appdata folder) folder to the new machine.\n. We are working towards adding full syncing (decks, arena runs, stats, settings...) between multiple machines. I can't give you an eta yet, but it's definitely near the top of the list!\nThis should do the trick for getting Dropbox syncing working: \n\nA even better way to accomplish this is to use symbolic link this is how I configured my Deck-Tracker:\n1. Move the HearthstoneDeckTracker folder (with all the files) located in %APPDATA%\\HearthstoneDeckTracker to your Dropbox folder. Make sure that the original folder does not exist.\n2. Create a symbolic link that connects %APPDATA%\\HearthstoneDeckTracker with the dropbox folder use the command : \nmklink /j %APPDATA%\\HearthstoneDeckTracker d:\\dropbox\\HearthstoneDeckTracker\n3. Do the same way on all computers you wish to use.\n4. Enjoy your synced Hearthstone Deck Tracker\n\nNote: I have not tried this, so make sure you back up your %APPDATA%\\HearthstoneDeckTracker folder before doing it.\nSource: https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/545#issuecomment-70380390\n. Will be fixed with the next release.\n. - How exactly does multiboxing work with Hearthstone? From this it looks like you can use the same installation but have it output the logs to a different folder?\n- Without knowing what this option is for, it's not clear it's is supposed to do.\n- Even with multiple HDT installation you can currently only run it once (I think) - requiring multiple installation is not a good solution either way though. For this to work properly we probably want some kind of \"user profile system\" that allows you to have multiple HDT configurations. \n- The overlay is currently attached to the first Hearthstone instance found. This needs a system to mark a Hearthstone proc (window handle) as \"in use\". Ideally it can, at the same time, get the HS installation from the proc (assuming multiboxing requires multiple installations), so that starting a second HDT instance would automatically select the 2nd window and the correspondig log without any configuration.\n. Fair enough, that sounds like it works a lot better than I expected. Two very minor things and it'll be gtm then.\nCould you add instructions to the wiki on how to set it up?\nAlso: the email you used to commit is no associated with your account. If you want the commits to be associated with your account you need to add that email in settings. \n. Could you fixup the last 2 commits into 98989dd and a62e12b and rebase everything on master? Should be good to go then.\n. Merged as https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/compare/26f2f5d370ed...f1ad26762648.\n. You can resize the secrets under options > overlay > opponent.\n. I just get a 404 on that link.\n. - Do you see the selected deck in the overlay?\n- Is the deck set as 'active'? i.e. is the name displayed in the bottom bar of the HDT window, below the decks?\n. Yes you can! Have a look here: https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/Streaming-Instructions\n. Not sure how that works with XSplit, you might be able to do it the same way or otherwise you need to capture your screen instead of just the game. The overlay is a separate window in top of Hearthstone.\n. This sounds like there's some permission problem. Try running HDT as admin.\n. - Delete this folder C:\\Users\\Sora\\AppData\\Local\\HearthSim\n- If you can run HDT: go to options (advanced) > tracker > backups and restore the latest backup.\n- If you can't: go to %AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker and replace the files with the ones from the latest zip in the Backup directory.\n. Not possible, sorry. \n. Please post logs of that happening. See here: https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/Reporting-Issues\n. The log is reset with each HDT session (that one is basically empty). If you still roughly know when it happened the last time you can try to find the respective log in that folder. Otherwise please post the hdt_log.txt right after the issue occours.\n. From the log it looks like everything was saved just fine. Do you maybe have some filter set that causes the games to not be displayed?\nYou can reset the constructed filters via stats > constructed > filters > ... > reset (in the filters header). Also check options > tracker > stats > display if they don't show up in the deck list.\n. Did you try resetting the constructed filters (stats > constructed > filters > ... > reset)? The options > tracker > stats > display setting has no effect on those. \nThere's nothing in the log that would suggest the game was not saved :/.\nThis is from the last game (against Akkser):\n13:50:49|Info|GameEventHandler.HandleGameEnd >> Game ended...\n13:50:50|Info|GameEventHandler.HandleGameEnd >> Assigned current game to deck: control\n13:51:02|Info|GameEventHandler.SaveAndUpdateStats >> Saving DeckStats\n. You probably set some filter at some point and didn't notice it today (reset just sets it back to default). It's currently not very clear to see when filters are set - so this is somewhat common, yeah. I'll try to add some way of indicating it.\n. Actually, this might be the same as #2623. It seems for some reason ranks are not always detected.\n. Do those games have ranks?\n. Should be fixed with v0.15.5\n. You can clear the value in the max rank filter or manually set a rank by editing the game.\n. Change it to \"L1\" - \"\" (i.e. just leave the second field empty). \n. Probably #2584\n. Try deleting the HDTUpdate_new.exe and HDTUpdate.exe, then download and manually overwrite the files with the latest version: https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/releases/tag/v0.15.6\n. I think this is more likely a problem with the plugin itself. HDT does not touch any plugin config files.\n. That happened with v0.15. We get the decks from mono process memory now via HearthMirror.\n. It's a huge improvement, yeah! :D Very happy with it.\n. This is only used for importing from clipboard/file (card names) and NetDeck. I'm pretty sure something very close to 100% of decks on the web have at least one class card. Not worth fixing.\nEdit: Just realized this was mainly about deck string - but the same applies. Maybe 99.99% instead of 99.999% of decks have class cards when importing from strings. The workaround at that point it to manually create the deck in HDT.\n.

This is mainly an easy way of dealing with the squirrel updating behavior. Opposed to the old updater, it does not overwrite existing files but rather creates a second installation.\nThe first copy only happens on the initial app start with a verison greater than 0.15.13, to keep existing plugins working.\n. As long as it does not add new files this should not be an issue. Right now it will not update the local file if it's newer than the one in appdata. I was on the verge of changing this to make downgrading possible without restarting HDT twice or manually removing both installation, but this might be a good feature.\n.

Maybe this is a detection issue of some kind? \nCan you guys check your task manager for whether Hearthstone is actually running as 64 bit?\nEdit: Any chance there is another process called \"Hearthstone\" running?. You can find the source and specifically that part of the code here and here.\nIt seems to be a very edge case-y problem (I am not able to reproduce it and it's working fine for thousands of users). \nI would be extremely grateful if you managed to figure out why this is not working on your system!. Absolutely, no problem. Thank you for taking a look!. If I had any idea how, I would, sorry :/.. It sometimes working is interesting. See if it's somehow related to the order of starting HDT and the Battle.net client/Hearthstone, or some other software running/not running when you start either.. I just randomly had this issue too for a while, starting Hearthstone via the button in HDT seemed to work for me.. There is no way to change it currently. This is due to the fix to replays after the latest hearthstone update, causing \"player 1\" to always be the bottom player instead of the \"local player\". \nHowever, there is something new coming for replays very soon (next few days), making the current replay viewer obsolete!

You want to post your issue over at https://github.com/HearthSim/HSTracker.\n. ## Proposal 1 is implemented and can be used by any website that wants to support HDT importing!\nRequired properties:\n\nx-hearthstone:deck:  Name of the deck, HTML encoding is supported\nx-hearthstone:deck:cards: Comma separated list of CardId,, multiple copies need to be listed separately. E.g. CARD_ID1, CARD_ID1 for two copies\nx-hearthstone:deck:hero: CardId of the the hero, NOT the class name (HERO_01, not Warrior)\n\nOptional properties:\n\nx-hearthstone:deck:url: source url of the deck, HDT stored the pasted url when importing if not provided.\n\nExample:\n<meta property=\"x-hearthstone:deck\" content=\"Patron Warrior\"/>\n<meta property=\"x-hearthstone:deck:hero\" content=\"HERO_01\"/>\n<meta property=\"x-hearthstone:deck:cards\" content=\"NEW1_030,NEW1_030,EX1_001,EX1_001,...\"/>\n<meta property=\"x-hearthstone:deck:url\" content=\"http://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/612030-heroic-crone-1st-attempt\"/>. ### Now available on the wiki: \n- Implementation\n- Participating websites\nI'll leave this open for now, for any discussion on e.g. extending functionality.. It almost looks like your %LocalAppData% is not defined, but HDT is installed correctly - so I'm not really sure what's going on.\nOpen the command promp (Win+R, \"cmd\") and write echo %LocalAppData%. What does it say?\n. While this removes the warning, the Blizzard\\Hearthstone directory should be (and is) located in %LocalAppData% - this is where you manually updated the log.config and where the Hearthstone client looks for it.\nIt seems that for some reason HDT gets an empty value for %LocalAppData% on your system causing it to look at {CurrentDirectory}\\Blizzard\\Hearthstone rathern than C:\\Users\\Cosmo\\AppData\\Local\\Blizzard\\Hearthstone.\nIt's very possible that the underlying issue may causes other problems as well.\n. Tbh, I don't really know. The weird part is that HDT is installed in %LocalAppData% (and you are getting the correct output). \nIf you don't notice other problems - as long as you update the actual log.config whenever HDT says it was updated and you need to restart Hearthstone (shouldn't happen very often) - you might be ok.\n. There is an option to do that, though it's admittedly a bit hidden. If you press the double arrow button next to the arena/standard/wild filter, you will find a \"include 'standard' decks in 'wild' option at the very bottom.\n. Duplicate https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/2753\n. Merged as https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/20d23ffe4a58094baa4ff6f41752562771292aaa\n. Fixed with https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/784171b46c1d99500675a1fb75e3570c8359a51c\n. This is now fixed in the latest hsreplay beta build. Live should follow soon.\n. Duplicate #2753\n. Check if there is a Bars and Themes folder in {INSTALL_DIR}/Images. \n{INSTALL_DIR} depends on whether you downloaded the installer or the zip: \n- Installer: %LocalAppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker/app-1.0.5(.28)\n- Zip: You propably now where you unzipped it :).\nIf those folders are missing (or empty), try reinstalling.\n. Double click was changed in the latest hsreplay beta release to activate the deck instead. Since deck importing from the game works rather well now (last issues with updating changes properly will be fixed with the next release - currently, reselecting the deck fixes it), having double-click to edit seems unnecessary. \n. I'm trying to get rid of options that are not really necessary at the moment. This is not one I want to add one for. \nWhy do you need to edit decks in HDT on a regular basis? Maybe there's a better solution. \n. I guess my main point is: you can do the same thing directly in hearthstone and HDT will automatically pick up on any changes. Assuming the options (advanced) > tracker > importing > constructed settings are enabled.\n. I think it was turned off by default when coming from an old HDT version with a certain setting disabled.\nThat said, this feature currently has a minor bug where the UI/deck tracker doesn't always pick up on minor changes in decks. Reselecting the deck (in HDT) solves that and the next update will fix it. Just fyi :).\nI'm gonna close this then, great!\n. Since secret detection can potentially make mistakes, this is not something I would want to do.\n.

Try edit decks in game and import them via IMPORT > FROM GAME: CONSTRUCTED - you can also turn on auto importing in that menu.\n@ascejim I'm not really sure. Do you have auto importing and updating enabled under options (advanced) > tracker > importing? Please reproduce it and then upload the log - see here:  https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/Reporting-Issues\n. I think I found the issue - or at least one related to importing. It seems changes are imported to decks with better matching cards rather than matching IDs.\n@ascejim see if you are still having issues with this build: https://github.com/azeier/HDT-Test/releases/tag/1.0.5.29-4\nNote: it might still import some decks as new ones once due to the previous issues but should no longer in subsequent imports.\n. Oh, this happens only when manually edit decks in HDT? Yeah that is definitely not inteded. \nI thought were importing decks from the game. Then do the same thing I suggested for SNiLD above: \n\nTry edit decks in game and import them via IMPORT > FROM GAME: CONSTRUCTED - you can also turn on auto importing in that menu.\n. Alright, I found and fixed the issue!\n\nYou should be ok if you use automatic importing for now as mentioned above (I'd recommend it either way ;)).\n. Also, for manually saving as new versions: you can just delete the previous older one (lower/no version number). That's what HDT is currently failing to do.\n. @tinnvec turn off HEARTHSTATS > AUTO DELETE DECKS and AUTO DELETE GAMES for now\n. @beheh Is this fixable with the current oracle?\n.

Try to keep the underscores, yes. Those are used for Alt+{Key} commands (they are not visible).\n. Not very easily right now, no. You would have to build HDT locally and modify the pre-build script to not pull the changed from the repo.\n. Here is a release with that state of the translation in it: https://github.com/azeier/HDT-Test/releases/tag/v1.1.0.3\n. Are you maybe starting the wrong installation?\nHere's a new build: https://github.com/azeier/HDT-Test/releases/tag/v1.1.0.3.p1\nWhat stops you from just translating everything and then making all necessary changes at once?\n. Yeah, sorry for the delay. I'll try to get back to you later today.\n. - It most likely crashes because \"start with windows\" launches an HDT version that does not understand the config setting being pt-PT - there is no way around that atm\n- The custom build you downloaded here most likely updated, removing the pt-PT option again\n- Typo in MainWindow_Menu_Export_Clpiboard doesn't really matter, it's not user facing \n- Not sure about truncated string, I'll have  a look tomorrow.\n- There's separate strings for SameScaling (and in a bunch of other places) for consistency sake. Every UI element get's it's own. There is always the chance the same en-US string is translated differently in some languages.\n- I'll get you a build with the updated strings tomorrow.\n. Added pt-PT support for the next release. \nHere is a release with the updated strings: https://github.com/azeier/HDT-Test/releases/tag/v1.1.1\nThe config will reset if you start the normal HDT release (as of 1.1.1.0), as mentioned above. \nFor the cut off stings: That is a problem with the UI that might take some time to solve globally and is one of the reasons I have not bothered with the german translation too much. Kind of a workaround would be to reword some phrases in a shorter fashion, but I'm not sure that's worth it. It will get fixed eventually.\n. Fixed, thanks.\n. You have the filter for the opponent name set on the bottom left.\n. Try downloading the latest version (1.1.0): https://hsdecktracker.net/download\n. Great! :)\n. That sounds like it could be the first point here: https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/FAQ#exporting\n. Great!\n. :+1: thanks\n. 1) The new installer has a better updating system - you can download it here: https://hsdecktracker.net/download\n2) See https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/Setting-up-the-log.config\n. Do you get a crash report window in this case or does HDT just say \"Stopped responding\" (whatever the exact message is windows shows you :)).\n. Thanks for the report. This will be fixed with the next update.\n. Are you on the non-installer build (i.e. the one extracted from the zip)? If so, did you change the data storage location? See if options (advanced) > tracker > settings > save data in AppData is disabled.\n. If you go to stats > constructed > matches you can use ctrl-A to select everything and then click delete at the bottom.\n. You can use HDTs built-in screenshot functionality to take screenshots including the overlay: options (advanced) > tracker > hotkeys - create one for screenshot here.\n. Responded on the repo itself (https://github.com/azeier/HDT-TwitchPlugin/issues/8).\n. @riQQ What makes you come to that conclusion (idea)?\n. HearthMirror seems the least likely to me, \"interaction\" with Hearthstone is completely passive.\n. HearthDb uses hsdata.\n. Heh, I like this one.\nThanks for the report. Will be fixed with the next update.\n. Try playing around with the settings under options (advanced) > tracker > exporting. Specifically speed and paste names from clipboard.\n. - Any difference when running Hearthstone in windowed/fullscreen?\n- Could be an issue with software like RadeonPro - that is known to cause issues when exporting in some cases.\nOther than those I don't really have ideas what might cause this.\n. HDT now uses Hearthstones native deck string importing system.. We temporarily disabled deck lists on HSReplay.net for performance reasons. They should come back very soon.\n. Importing from their deck builder is not supported I think.\nHowever, we recently added support for any website to easily support HDT importing, using this spec: https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/2769\nThe major advantage being that this does not require any maintenance from our end (i.e. HDT updates) when the website layout changes. \nFeel free to reach out to them.\n. Do you have auto deck importing enabled? (options (advanced) > tracker > importing)\nWith that, this should not be an issue.\nThe alternative is turning off auto importing at the bottom of the decks list.\n. Try enabling auto importing then. HDT now picks up any change to a deck very reliably.\n. So this is resolved?\n. So this is resolved?\n. This will be fixed with the next update.\nSee https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/2853\n. This will be fixed with the next update.\nSee https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/2853\n. Issue moved to HearthSim/HSTracker #629 via ZenHub\n. I'd recommend switching to the new installer/updater: https://hsdecktracker.net/download\nThe old one has quite a few issues and will probably not see too much maintenance.\nThat said, the workaround there is probably to delete the HDTUpdate_new.exe file.\n. As @Binori said, yes. That functionality does no longer exist in the new installer because of the way the updating works. \nIf you need data at a different location you will have to stick with the zip version of HDT. Otherwise, moving everything to %AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker will restore all decks/stats.\n. The installer should create a new shortcut on your desktop / in your start menu. \n. That's the expected behavior, yes\nYou could try uninstalling (via windows Programs and Features) and reinstalling. \nHDT is installed to %LocalAppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker. \nIf you want to manually create a shortcut, you need to set the target to C:\\Users\\{USER}\\AppData\\Local\\HearthstoneDeckTracker\\Update.exe --processStart \"HearthstoneDeckTracker.exe\" and \"Start in\" to C:\\Users\\{USER}\\AppData\\Local\\HearthstoneDeckTracker\\app-1.1.1.\n\"Start in\" might be an issue if the shortcut does not auto regenerate on updates - which it should.\n. Make sure you have \"auto\" enabled at the bottom of the decks list.\n. Please keep it in english here.\nGoogle Translate\n\nso you need to keep the tincture, plugins here? it would be great if you return the ability to store settings in the program folder, ie the installation path.\n\nWIth the installer version of HDT changing the data directory is not possible for technical reasons. You can download a portable verison here: https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/releases/tag/v1.1.1.0 - This has those features enabled.\nThe updater on that one has a few issues and will likely not see much maintenance (and is worse in general). For reference: https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/2873\n. - See if reinstalling helps\n- Could be a DPI issue - if you have it set to something above 100% try fiddling with it a bit.\n. I'm not sure yet that will actually be the solution. This is a difficult one. \nThis is a bit of a shot in the dark, but try deleting the \"Logs\" folder within your hearthstone installation, see if that helps.\n. Translating the tooltips is not quite as easy, they are generated from Hearthstone files.\n. Try adding the Hearthstone directory (and possibly %LocalAppData%\\Blizzard\\Hearthstone\\Logs) as an exemption in your anti virus software. I started having some similar issues with windows defender after a windows update some time ago.\n. If it's the same with and without HDT running, just by the log.config existing, then this is not a problem with HDT. Check if there's any processes with high CPU usage in the scenario where the file exists and HDT is not running. \n. Or any with high disk usage, actually.\n. See #2873\n. See if you find a solution here: https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/FAQ#exporting\n. Related to #2110\n. Most likely not something we will add. \n. Try using this one:\nhttps://s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/hdt-downloads-asia/Hearthstone.Deck.Tracker-v1.1.1.1.zip\n. Try using this one:\nhttps://s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/hdt-downloads-asia/Hearthstone.Deck.Tracker-v1.1.1.1.zip\n. I think this belongs in the readme rather than in contributing.\n. You can use the HDT portable build (download here) to do this still.. Interesting issue.\nHard to tell what caused this or how it could even happen. Might not be worth worrying over.\nPlease let me know if you notice this again.\nFor future reference: most likely fix (actual issue is likely .IsPlayer not working correctly - tag not set?) should be something along these lines \ndiff\nHandleGameEnd()\n{\n    ...\n-    var player = _game.Entities.FirstOrDefault(e => e.Value?.IsPlayer ?? false).Value;\n-    if (player != null)\n-        _game.CurrentGameStats.PlayerName = player.Name;\n+    _game.CurrentGameStats.PlayerName = _game.Player.Name;\n    ...\n. Alright, looks good then.. HearthStats is no longer maintained by the new owner (or its' support in HDT) and we are working on a better solution.. Thanks for your opinion. You can disable it via options > overlay > general  > show card flavor text..... Judging from the log, the game should have been recorded fine. Make sure you don't have any stats filters set that might cause it to be hidden.. Are you having any issues due to it not existing? It might not be created if there's no data to store in it.. Matches played without an active deck are stored in DefaultDeckStats. If HDT doesn't need to create it it won't be created :P. I'm also fairly sure the condition for generating it changed since v0.6.0.\nI'm gonna close this since it's not actually an issue.. I agree. This is not something that needs a specific calculator in HDT.. Duplicate of #2738.\nThere are a few suggestions over in that issue, please give them a shot.\nIn short though: We don't know what might be causing this on some machines.. See here: https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/FAQ#not-working. Duplicate  #868. This happens because the \"best deck\" logic is factoring in the number of games. The reason being that your deck with 19-1 stats is actually a lot better than your 1-0 deck, even though the latter has the higher winrate. \nWe should probably change the factor to be logarithmic.. That looks good. Should definitely be an improvement overt the current formula.. Sounds like HDT has no permission to write to files. Try running HDT as admin.. Please do this:\n- Restart HDT\n- Delete a deck/change options\n- Open the appdata folder (see here: https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/Reporting-Issues)\n- Close HDT\n- Upload the hdt_log.txt (after closing hdt!) as described in the link above.. Looks good. It's definitely a permissions issue:\n\nAccess to the path 'C:\\Users\\Angel\\AppData\\Roaming\\HearthstoneDeckTracker...' is denied.\n\nGo to that path (one level up from where there Log folder was), rightclick on the HearthstoneDeckTracker folder and check the Security tab. Make sure \"Full control\" is set for your current user.. Attaching screenshots via email doesn't work sadly. You can directly upload them on github though.. That's the properties for the HDT shortcut, not the C:\\Users\\Angel\\AppData\\Roaming\\HearthstoneDeckTracker folder. Check that one :).. Yeah that looks good.. Not sure what's going on here :/.. You could try renaming the C:\\Users\\Angel\\AppData\\Roaming\\HearthstoneDeckTracker folder and running HDT again. If it can save changes, try copying the files from the renamed one over (without HDT running). . Awesome :). Glad we figured it out!. :+1: Thanks!. Jup, https://art.hearthstonejson.com/v1/tiles/CFM_713.png seems to be missing.\nSeveral are, in fact.. This should be fixed with the latest update (1.1.2.1).. This should be fixed with the latest update (1.1.2.1).. Have a look at options > overlay > general > unlock and options (advanced) > overlay > player > scaling.. We plan on doing something like that soon ;).. Should be pretty easy to add.. Yes, this is listed as a known issue in the update notes.\nWe do not always know whether the opponent has a minion in hand, and figuring it out (as far as possible) probably requires extensive logic.\nNot sure what to do about it yet.  @judge2020 Suggested some indicator for \"possibly grayed out\".. Issue moved to HearthSim/HSTracker #689 via ZenHub\n. This is fixed with https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/94ea5e34ad79181c267f9dc79e444f68479971d7. There should be a new release fairly soon.. \ud83d\udc4d . Could you guys upload logs for games where that happens?\nhttps://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/Reporting-Issues. Could you upload your PlayerDecks.xml file? It's in the same directory as the \"Logs\" folder.. That doesn't look right. Can you zip and upload the file? e.g. http://zippyshare.com - you might be able to just attack it here, too.. Yeah that out of memory crash is a known issue I still don't know how to fix (or why it happens) :(\nAs for the importing/selection issue, give this build a try please: https://github.com/azeier/HDT-Test/releases/download/v1.1.2.3/Hearthstone.Deck.Tracker-v1.1.2.3.zip\nIt looks like the deck you are having issues with only contains 29 cards and HDT has a bug (which I hopefully just fixed :)), where it doesn't detect the difference in decks \"that way around\". \nThe build above should now properly import the full deck.. I meant HDT only has 29 cards for the deck, somewhere one got lost.. You can just unzip it anywhere and run the exe. No need your current installation. . The splash screen always just shows the first 3 digits. I think the full version number is only ever printed in the log. Or you can check the exe > properties > details too.. That version should mainly fix HDT not recognizing cards (not properly importing decks). Let me know if you still notice that, e.g. with your druid deck.. @xrandalxflagg That's with the 1.1.2.3 release I linked above?. @Radiohawk58 can you post the logs since you launched 1.1.2.3 for the first time?. Did you by any chance start HDT mid-game before you manually fixed it? It looks like it auto imported 2 other decks just fine now.. @Heelythegreat are you logged in to hearthstats?. Could you guys upload logs for games where that happens?\nhttps://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/Reporting-Issues. Could you guys upload logs for games where that happens?\nhttps://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/Reporting-Issues. Oh! That is good to know. Thank you for the info.. Do you have the hdt log?. Is this problem exclusive to brawl?. I think this might be an issue specific to secrets that were created in the way the brawl does it. . This might be a logging change.

Here is a build with the fix: https://github.com/azeier/HDT-Test/releases/download/v1.1.2.2/Hearthstone.Deck.Tracker-v1.1.2.2.zip\nCan you guys confirm its fixed?. By web client you mean HearthStats? That is not going to be fixed, as HearthStats is no longer maintained. We are slowly deprecating the integration and are going to be working on a better replacement system soon.. The auto importing from Hearthstone is a rather new feature that does not have the HearthStats logic as part of it. That said, if you have all the auto uploading for it enabled, decks/versions should still be uploaded as soon as you play (upload) the first match with them.\nWe will try to move all data as complete as possible. Anything that's stored locally in HDT should be no problem.. Cards there were not found with the pre-update version will always be \"NOOO...\". Try just importing the decks again with the latest version installed.\nIf you downloaded it again, you should have the latest version installed. It should say \"1.1.2\" when you launch it.. Perfect :).. #2991. #2991. Maybe, my guess would be it ends up an infinite loop.. Are you on v1.1.4?

One is current turn - turn drawn and the other one is just turn drawn.\n(Given, the option naming is confusing). Changing values would make it very hard to keep track of specific cards.\nAnd as I said, there is really not much difference between the two methods. With the current implementation you can tell your opponent is keeping something special if he has a low number in hand on turn 15 just the same.\nI don't see any point in changing this, sorry..

Perfect, thanks :).. Are you by any chance somehow still on Hearthstone 8.0.4?. This will sadly be a bit of a guessing game, because I don't seem to have any problems with it myself.\nUnzip this HearthMirror.zip into %LocalAppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker/app-1.3.2 (or your HDT installation dir if you are using the zip version) and replace the existing HearthMirror.dll. See if that helps.\nYou can just paste that path into the windows run dialog (Win+R).\n. Try reinstalling HDT and rebooting . cool :). Same suggestions again.\nIf it doesn't help I don't know what it might be, sorry. . You need to update HDT to the latest version.. Why? All the information is already there. . But what's the usecase where that information needs to be stored rather than converted on demand? Faulty conversions seem very unlikely.\nI could maybe see a case when you are building a new system to use them as the primary way to store decks, but switching over to it or storing them in addition seems unnecessary.\nUsing it instead of the GUID does not work with the current system because decks have the same GUID across versions.. Convenience would make sense if it's something that's frequently used (like \"someString\".Trim() instead of StringHelper.Trim(\"someString\")), but I don't really see myself accessing a deck.DeckString property very often after the initial implementation.. It will always be Battle.net in my heart!\n(yeah you are right). Yeah :/ I'm not sure what to make reasonably smaller without causing overlapping here.\nSince 1.3.5 you can disable the my games panel under options (advanced) > tracker > general. But that's far from an actual solution, too.\nMaking the deck panel smaller also only helps so far, I'm open to suggestions here.  . please dont open duplicate issues .

The only way this crash could happen on 1.3.5 is if one of the libraries didn't get updated.. We won't be adding back the old exporting system, sorry. It's something I really don't want to maintain when there's an official system in place that does the job (with this exception) better than ours in the first place.\nYou'll have to ask Blizzard for it. They have a way in arena now to remove golden cards, adding the same thing for constructed is not unreasonable.\nClosing this since the original issue is a problem with Hearthstone, not HDT.. Merged as cec1800a1d39...3e18db195cdd. There will be a new release today. . Yes ;) . Done via #3387. Works completely fine for me. What does ctrl-tab even do?. Right, but it has no effect in HDT.. I think you have the wrong repo then, we don't use or have anything to do with overwolf.. Also just fyi: the email you used to commit is not associated with your github account..

Please open an issue for that, not a pull request.. Try restarting Hearthstone/rebooting. . Fixing this requires Squirrel 1.7.6, which doesn't seem very stable. Waiting for 1.7.7 or higher.. Fixed this to now say Runs: 0 (0% of total). Also removed the accidental space, it's correct in most cases without.. Enable these two options: options > overlay > general > hide card-age / hide card-marks. You need a (selected) deck to export. \nImport/export are from the point of view of HDT. Exporting a deck gives you e.g. the deck code for it. . HDT wasn't on the latest version when these decks were imported. Make sure you are on 1.3.5, then delete/import decks again. \n'Auto' should be blue. . You can get it here: https://hsdecktracker.net. The log looks fine for the most part. Try restarting HDT and hearthstone.. You need VS2017. I think the options > player > Include cards created in hand option should work here. It should show those cards in the list once drawn and remove them again once played.. \ud83d\udc4d . This has inconsistent behavior between switching from an arena or a non-arena deck to \"no deck mode\". It should probably show the panel in either case.. It doesn't matter when you build the solution, this problem only occurs if you are in a (standard) match while running the test. \nThere is no need to fix this on the test level, the underlying logic needs to be separated better.. Weird, the tests run fine for me as soon as I exit the match. . I'll merge this since it's a very minor change, but in general we'd rather encourage websites to implement meta tag based importing. . Auto select does ignore archived decks. Automatic importing will unarchive decks if it finds an exact match, instead of creating a new one. Which I think is the correct behavior. \nDepending on what your plugin does, adding a custom tag to decks might be a better solution. . HDT has a screenshot feature, including one click uploads to imgur, that suits the \"share to look at\" usecase a lot better.\nI don't think export as deckstring makes much sense on arena decks.. Shouldn't be too though. This needs to be extended to support any type of FrameworkElement and have a full list of \"viable types\".\nFeel free to take a crack at it! :). Perfect \ud83d\udc4d . Does opening and closing the friends list again help?. Should be fixed with the next release (1.4.1).. We're working on it, not entirely sure what's going on yet.. Should be working again now!. Does it actually stop or is the overlay just hidden? Might be https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/3143 - try checking/unchecking the \"hide in menu\" and \"hide if hs in background\" options.. There also seems to be a conflict with HearthArena currently, in case you are using that.. Can you give some more detail?\nWhere do you imagine this being? In the main UI, in the overlay?. I don't seem to be able to reproduce this. What do your overlay > general options look like?\nDoes resetting your config (rename %AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker/config.xml without HDT running) help?. - Close both\n- Start HDT\n- Start Hearthstone\n- Enter the \"Play\" menu\n- Start a match\n- Upload the log - https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/Reporting-Issues. The card stolen by Death Grip is revealed in game as well.\nIt is turned over just before entering the hand and visible in the history.. This is the repository and issue tracker for the mac version: https://github.com/HearthSim/HSTracker\nThis beta version has support for the expansion: https://twitter.com/hstracker_mac/status/896283985504030720. It should be released very soon hopefully.. Fixed with https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/5a25bc54665c8e7266ebbd6687e5834afe6e89cb. Is the quest somehow not revealed on discard? Not sure why this would happen.\nPlease reproduce it and post the HDT log here - https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/Reporting-Issues. Destroyed cards are still discarded for all intents and purposes. They get moved from HAND/DECK to SETASIDE. And they are revealed,   that's why you see them in the history in game and that's the entire reason HDT is able to remove them from the deck/show them on the opponent side.\nThe only exception for that seems to be quests. . We won't be adding the old method back sorry.\nAs far as I know the native method should be very reliable. Can you post the full deck string (including all the comments) for a deck you are having this issue with?. The list you posted only has 29 cards, that's why it's not working. . I'll add a warning in the export window if hearthstone won't be able to import it.\nYour easiest workaround will probably be to complete the deck in HDT.. Hearthstone shows you which cards were destroyed in the history (bar on the left)..

We no longer want to maintain custom importers.\nThis is something they should fix on their end.\nAs a workaround: You can use their copy deck button for importing decks to HDT.\n. Thanks @edzam :).\nThe test now works again - might as well keep it. The \"Web\" tests are not run by CI anyway.. Thanks!. Merged as https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/compare/184d6aaf3d0c...75743a815d20. Duplicate of #3358. Fixes for the next update.\nThis is an issue with Classic cards in general, I gave classic the wrong set in https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/c740cd6e0644b461bfe1e09a7d707db03ba8354f#diff-172b9c7f07647c2b2b261c97f5e5bff5R11 - which allows basic cards to be added instead of classic ones.. Fixed with https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/f48fcae3084d350d5b2c5450ba56cef8966916e3. This is definitely a bug, wild secrets are not intended to show up in arena.. #3248  or somewhere else?. You can disable those via options > overlay > general > hide card marks/age. Issue moved to HearthSim/HSTracker #882 via ZenHub\n. Fixed with v1.4.4. You will sadly have to manually update (overwrite your installation).. Can you consistently reproduce this with HDT running, and not without it?. Does it happen when exiting HDT or Hearthstone (above assumes the latter of course)?. Fixed with https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/f48fcae3084d350d5b2c5450ba56cef8966916e3. Does the resolution set in Hearthstone match the screen resolution?\nDoes the issue remain if Hearthstone is in Windowed mode?. > My theory is that the window in fullscreen mode uses some DirectX optimizations, thus taking control over the scale factor, making the system think it's being scaled by a factor of 1.\nIIRC the issue started happening after Hearthstone was updated to Unity 5.6(?), so that sounds reasonable to me.\nThis might be related: https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/screen-dot-setresolution-works-incorrectly-when-dpi-scaling-is-set-to-anything-else-than-100-percent-in-windowed-mode. Fixed with https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/f48fcae3084d350d5b2c5450ba56cef8966916e3. 7:26:51 PM|Error|PluginWrapper.OnButtonPress >> Graveyard\nSystem.MissingMethodException: Method not found: 'Void MahApps.Metro.Controls.Flyout.set_Header(System.String)'.\n   at HDT.Plugins.Graveyard.SettingsView.CreateSettingsFlyout()\n   at HDT.Plugins.Graveyard.SettingsView.get_Flyout()\n   at HDT.Plugins.Graveyard.GraveyardPlugin.OnButtonPress()\n   at Hearthstone_Deck_Tracker.Plugins.PluginWrapper.OnButtonPress() in D:\\GitHub\\Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker\\Hearthstone Deck Tracker\\Plugins\\PluginWrapper.cs:line 144\nThis is an issue specifically with Graveyard. Needs to be fixed on the plugins side, sorry.. Duplicate #3453. Merged as https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/a6326043396cc2608282dd931d51cf408ee82e70. This doesn't actually fix #2987 though, does it? This fixes the edge case where the opponent has a revealed minion in hand, i.e. one that was returned from play - which means something like sap or freezing trap was played by the player. In the majority of cases it will still not grey out correctly because it's either not possible to know or requires card type deduction based on played cards.. If your opponent has not yet played any cards but one secret and you play a minion. Nothing happens. You don't know whether that's because he has no minion in hand or it's not hidden cache, since none of the cards in his hand have the card type revealed.. Oh - I see, this handles that after the fact, interesting. . > If applicable, provide a log of the session where the problem occurred.\nSee here: https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/Reporting-Issues. What's the behaviour if you:\n1. Start HDT, start Hearthstone, close HDT\n2. Start Heartstone, start HDT, close HDT?\nIt seems unlikely HDT could be causing this. Try updating your graphics drivers.. > running the latest AMD graphics drivers.\nSorry. Maybe try reverting to a previous version then - seems highly likely that it's related to your system. There have not been any changes to HDTs overlay system in quite a while.\nYou could also try running HDT in compatibility mode. \n\"Hide in menus\" still having the issue makes sense. That doesn't actually disable the overlay, but only hides everything in it. . That sounds like it might be related to this somehow https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/3445. Actively being worked on.. Looking for testers for this.\nDeck selection and deck updating when picking loot should be working.\nDeck list and stats filtering is still on the todo list.\nDownload the development build here: https://github.com/HearthSim/HDT-dev-builds/releases/latest/\nThis build will replace your current HDT installation and automatically update to the stable release once that is available.. Pushed a new update to the dev release (either enable the checkbox in the bottom right or just reinstall from the link above).\nThis fixes a bug where importing the warlock deck wouldn't work correctly and adds dungeon and brawl support to the deck picker UI.\n@stephanechorne Were you playing warlock by any chance? If so see if the new build fixes it. Otherwise could you upload a log? See https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/Reporting-Issues. @Urtgard Showing the passive buffs is intended currently. Hiding them is a bit more complicated / ugly. I'll keep it in mind though - if there's more feedback about it I'll have a look again.. Pushed another update.\n\nFixed an issue where dungeon deck importing wouldn't work sometimes\nAdded menu options for disabling dungeon deck importing, name template and excluding passives (options (advanced) > tracker > importing) \n\n@Urtgard - found an easy way to add that afterall :P. Released with v1.5.7.\nThanks for testing guys.. @oompaloomp You should report that on the Dust Utility repo. And uninstall the plugin for now. You can remove it under %AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker/Plugins (just paste thisinto the run dialog - Win+R to open it). Fixed with https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/510051701186da5f343af60f307172a67946a502 for the next release.\nLeaving this open for the time being.. Fixed with v1.5.7. Try running the .NET Framework Repair Tool.. Fixed with v1.5.10. Closing in favor of #2738. Fixed with v1.5.10. I'm not gonna look through a +4,018 \u22123,607 PR, sorry.\nThis looks like a bunch of unnecessary changes.. I don't think I'll have time to look through this (and the other 2? PRs) in at least the next two weeks. This should probably be multiple PRs with reasonable diffs. \nOne obvious issue right now: no PR should include version increments.\n  . > I can only suggest that you download a copy of my forked version and test to make sure everything is working as I have done.\nThat's not a reasonable way to make sure this PR is fine. Me being busy for two weeks doesn't mean reviewing a +-3k diff isn't crazy. Not only that not checking what possibly non obvious implications all of the changes might have.\nThis should at least be split into PRs for:\n- Cleanup\n- .NET Core (see below - I'm not sure why this is necessary)\n- .NET Framework 4.7 (see below)\nThis allows for much easier selective merging. It's okay for PRs to depends on one another.\nThere are also still what looks like to me line ending changes that result in major unnecessary diffs in a lot of the files. Also the CHANGELOG is user facing and should not contain technical changes.\nTwo major questions I have:\n- What happens when HDT updates to the new version but the user only has .NET Framework 4.5 installed?\n- What are the advantages of .NET Core besides cross platform (which are not relevant in a WPF project)? . From what I could find out so far: It looks like Squirrel (our updater) is not able to upgrade .NET installations on update. Which means updating HDT to any newer .NET Framework version will not be possible. In addition to that, 15% of the HDT userbase are using the zipped version, which comes with it's own updater, that would also require a custom implementation. \nThere are possible workarounds like pushing an HDT update that installs the required .NET Framework version and then downloads another update only that version can download. That is super nasty though and really not something I want to do.\nOn top of all that: I have over the last two months been working on pulling basically all the non-UI code into a separate library and rewriting it (currently still a private project). Which means a lot of the changes here would have to be ported.\nIt doesn't seem like upgrading .NET Framework and using .NET Core (which I'm still not sure what the benefits of would be) are worth it at this point. If we had concrete plans to make HDT cross platform this might be a different story, but that is not currently on our roadmap.. See https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/pull/3535#issuecomment-361433328. This seems unlikely to happen and is not mergable at this point anymore anyway.. Manually merged: https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/compare/5706459bb8cb...9d9c74646aa5.\n\nSquashed commits\nFixed loading the checkbox state\nRemoved spaces between if/while and the parentheses.. Google drive sounds like it might be the issue. I think the running instance checks happens based on a lock on the log file. . I'm there's much better ways to do that yes. Using the log file is a very old hack.. Yep. Definitely not a HDT feature.. You can download the latest release as a portable version here: https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/releases/latest\n\nDownload the \"Hearthstone.Deck.Tracker-vX.X.X.zip\" file under assets instead of clicking on the big fat link. You can just unzip that anywhere you like. . As I said in #3535, I've been working on moving all the non HDT specific logic (i.e. pretty much everything but the UI and decks/stats) into a separate project. That includes the watchers and the resource generator. . Looks like this might be an issue with the font not supporting bold for those letters? The card tiles look fine.. This seems unlikely to happen and is not mergable at this point anymore anyway.. Didn't get around to this, sorry.\nMight look into a more generic solution if this event happens again.. HDT is not allowed to connect to anything on your machine. Try exempting it from your firewall or av.\nThe initial update check has to happen before any UI is loaded, but it's blocked and times out after 30 seconds.\nEdit: running HDT as administrator might also help.. Fixed with v1.5.13. Fixed with v1.5.13. Fixed with v1.5.13. Make sure you're on hearthstone 10.4.0 and try restarting both.. Great :). Should be fixed with v1.5.14. Your updater will fail to download this release again, but any following ones will be fine.. That was indeed not intended. \nWe require singled CLAs from contributors nowadays (I really should put that somewhere), since this is a very minor non-code fix I'm just gonna push a commit myself so we don't have to do that here \ud83d\ude04.\nWe're always happy about HDT contributors though, if you're generally interested just shoot me a message here or on discord!. See #3587.\nThis will be fixed with updates after 1.5.14. Hey, we require a signed CLA from any contributors. I sent you an invite to the repo, all the information you need should be available in the README.md. If you have any questions feel free to ask here or hit me up on our dev discord (azeier / Alex#8888).\nRegarding the actual PR: The changes are fine, but the commit message should contain information about what actually changed. I can just squash the commits and edit it in this case, but you should keep that in mind in the future.. There's a plugin for that: https://github.com/RedHatter/Graveyard. you can download a portable build here: https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/releases/latest. Thanks for your opinion.. See #2738. Thanks. Make sure to actually run the version you downloaded. \nIf you downloaded the installer it will have created a new shortcut on your desktop you need to use.\nTo update the portable build you need to download the \"Hearthstone.Deck.Tracker-v1.5.14.zip\" here https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/releases and overwrite all files in your installation directory.. Exactly right. The 1.5.14 updater will work fine for the next update.. As ceceita said. You should file an issue on the plugin repo.. Looks like HDT wasn't able to read data from the game correctly. I don't think we can do much about those specific replays, a lot of metadata is missing.\nTry restarting HDT and Hearthstone and see if this problem persists.. Logging out and back in under options > hsreplay.net > my account should fix this.. It defaults to 2018 for me. Is your machine time set to 2017 maybe?. Upstream issue on https://github.com/HearthSim/hsdata. Rotated cards are missing the set tag.. Temporarily fixed with https://github.com/HearthSim/HearthDb/commit/deaffb79b58c1dd58bf68b009807aee4ea308d63. Fixed with https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/d56609fcb94e37984fd8f52540b8e8638e0508d1. Leaving this open to hopefully prevent duplicates.. Nvm. Discarded cards don't show up. This is a info leak but I think we can hide it.. This is going to be tough to fix while still showing Baku/Genn in the deck list.\nI think the same thing also happened with e.g. Prince Malchezaar. Are you on 1.6.2?. Fixed with https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/1f1377f534ddeacb8de1d41305729d9844b3d1bd. Actually - I'm not sure whether this fixes it, but I removed the version number from the icon text for now. I suppose there is a chance of that being the problem.. Renaming the exe has all sorts of implications, definitely can't do that.. Fixed with https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/3658172744b84a8c7100b9467b5a59aaa4f2d26c. Should be fixed with v1.6.4.. Implemented with https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/277392dc00098e8af22b42c4015a38c5584d37be. Should be fixed with v1.6.4.. We had and fixed a server side issue that was causing this.. Fixed with https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/93cab94bad43a730be468c50b9eab66632457469.\nThis is a bug in Hearthstone.. This is exactly the bug in hearthstone, the drawn card has Far Sight set as the creator. You can also see this when looking at the drawn card in the sidebar.. Should be fixed with v1.6.4.. Can you be more specific what the problem is?. Why would it be?. Your filters are set to casual.. Hearthstone is a 32bit process and you can not access that from a 64bit one.. Test build available here: https://github.com/HearthSim/HDT-dev-builds/releases/latest\n(This replaces your existing HDT installation and will automatically update to the next stable release once available). Fixed with https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/0efe64a74ba270dee82815b817bcabcace863bc9. We might revisit that in the future but it's gonna stay persistent for the time being.. Looks good. I can take care of the localization for it.\nJust fyi: looks like the email you used to commit isn't associated with your github account.. You should be able to just rightclick the deck and remove the brawl tag under \"quick set tag\". This behavior should be fixed with the next release. Decks will not be tagged as brawl if they have any non-brawl games.. Could you post your full code (or at least more context)?. Because it's fixed. Make sure you're on the latest version - download on https://hsdecktracker.net.\nPlease don't open new issues to comment on issues. Just comment on the issue.. Sorry for ignoring the previous one, meant to comment that something like this should be possible. Much nicer solution indeed, thanks!. Thanks :). Sorry for the delay here. Changes look good. \nI added the new strings for you but yes, that is exactly how you would do it.\nFor reference: https://github.com/HearthSim/HDT-Localization/commit/2407788f9d1cddc8188b84d7168bbc6f497feb8c. This behavior should be fixed with the next release. Decks will not be tagged as brawl if they have any non-brawl games.. Fixed with https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/6f0173c5e4c56fc305e9c9cc5cc956e3eb97fa7b. Try logging out and in again under options.. Looks like blizzard changed something about the procotols. Don't have time to investigate right now, but this is the command that is no longer working: https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/blob/master/Hearthstone%20Deck%20Tracker/Utility/HearthstoneRunner.cs#L52. The \"name\" hasn't changed. battlenet://WTCG still opens the hearthstone tab on the launcher.. Since we can still launch the battle.net client via battlenet:// the easiest fix is probably:\n1. Run battlenet:// (already happens)\n2. Wait for the process (already happens)\n3. Get Battle.net.exe path via the running process\n4. Run <full_path>/Battle.net.exe --exec=\"WTCG\"\nI'm not sure how to best work around the Battle.net.beta client though. Is that the same executable?. I guess we actually know whether we find the Battle.net or Battle.net.beta process and thus find the correct executable path regardless. The above approach will work.. Gonna leave this open actually until the release it out, to prevent duplicates.\nThere should be a release around noon PST tomorrow.. Fixed with v1.6.8. Looks good. Thanks! I'll get a release out tomorrow. This doesn't seem like the right solution. I shouldn't have to check whether an options panel needs to now have a scrollviewer every time I add something new to it.. You wanna try this \"asking for help\" thing again? Maybe include a screenshot of your deck tracker and hsreplay.net settings page.. Hey, sorry that CLAassist bot is currently not actually in use. I sent you an invite to our CLA repo, you can find all the instructions in the README.\nPR looks great :).. Is this still an issue with v1.6.9?. A potential (preventative) solution to this might be to add a check in HearthMirror that read values (mostly strings I suppose) don't contain null characters, and throwing an exception in the case that they do to invalidate the entire read dataset.. This is working fine for me.. Yep that looks like a disconnect judging from the log.\nDisconnected games are extremely tough to merge into one, that's why in most cases we discard the part before the disconnect. There's not much we can do about the replay in this case, sorry.. Please make sure you are on v1.6.9 an post a log after a game where this happens. See https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/Reporting-Issues. Ah. I see you opened an issue on the correct project now. I'll close this.. You can contribute to translations here:\nhttps://translate.hsdecktracker.net\n(please use english for issues on our repos). I did respond to him via email regarding this pr - the gist:\n- I don't think checking the entity is null would actually help with anything.\n- I think that secret interaction depends on play order, so this fix might not be correct in all cases.\n- An argument has been added to the method without updating anything that calls it.\n- The argument entity is assigned to a non-existent class variable (when it doesn't need to be).\nI'm going to close this PR for now as it's not usable.. Here's a test build with a potential fix and improved logging that should help us figure out what's going on: https://github.com/HearthSim/HDT-dev-builds/releases/download/v1.7.5-dev3680/HDT-Installer.exe\nThis version will overwrite your current HDT installation but keep all stats/settings and will update to the next full release once it's available. \nPlease let us know whether you still experience the same issues with this release and include new logs if you do.. We may have figured out what's causing this. Try this build: https://github.com/HearthSim/HDT-dev-builds/releases/download/v1.7.5-dev3681/HDT-Installer.exe\nSame procedure: let us know whether you still experience the same issues with this release and include new logs if you do.. ~~Could you also post your <Hearthstone-Installation>/Logs/Power.log file?  Even if the issue is fixed with 3181, this would be good to have to maybe get some insight into the underlying cause.~~\nPosted in https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/3758#issuecomment-412314585 - Power.log looks fine.. I committed this via https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/1fe7527c735292bad9e038a4fdfa148291877810 because:\n- You removed the PR template\n- You have not signed the CLA yet (and not read the CONTRIBUTING.md as mentioned in the PR template)\n- The commit message should start with an uppercase character\n- The commit message should be imperative (I.e. Add Bommsday to...)\nGiven the size of this issue just committing it myself was the simper route. Thank you for bringing this to our attention though.\nI sent you an invite to our CLA repo to make future contributions easier. Everything should be explained in the readme of that repo. If you have any questions feel free to ask here, email me or message me on discord (http://discord.gg/hearthsim-devs).. This is an issue with how Hearthstone handles the cards created by Whizbang. The release will include a fix for this (and most likely automatically create the decks).. This and the opponent side of this have been fixed with https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/45405ff9579fe87bee77d4bdc95a8d537f7d6665. Here's a test release that should fix all the tracking issues and automatically import all the deck recipes when the whizbang deck is found: https://github.com/HearthSim/HDT-dev-builds/releases/download/v1.7.2-dev3668/HDT-Installer.exe\nThis version will overwrite your current installation (keeps settings etc) and automatically update to the next stable release once available.\nLet me know if you notice any issues.. Nice copy paste there lol... thanks.. Well this is unexpected. Yes this should definitely not happen and will be fixed.. \nI am not able to reproduce this. Can you provide a log for this?

HDT only uses PTL. Alright, this is an issue with Augmented Elekk + Academic Espionage:\n- Academic Espionage creates all cards and keeps them hidden.\n- Augmented Elekk creates copies of these cards but reveals the copies. . \nYou can actually see all the cards created by Augmented Elekk in the sidebar, so this is a bug on Blizzards end, not in HDT.. I'm going to leave this open for a week or two to avoid the 20 duplicates :).. Good job blizzard \ud83d\ude04 . Merged with some cleanup as https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/2fa315124c142af6e605dda0ea47d165eab5b0f9. Here's a test build with a potential fix and improved logging that should help us figure out what's going on: https://github.com/HearthSim/HDT-dev-builds/releases/download/v1.7.5-dev3680/HDT-Installer.exe\nThis version will overwrite your current HDT installation but keep all stats/settings and will update to the next full release once it's available. \nPlease let us know whether you still experience the same issues with this release and include new logs if you do.. I'm fairly confident this is the same underlying issue as #3743.. The log above still uses version 3680. Can you try version 3681 I linked here https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/3743#issuecomment-412306182 ?. Since this is very like the same issue as https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/3743 I'm going to close this to keep the conversation over there. If it turns out they are separate issues we can reopen this.. Fixed with https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/3084764c84f707d8141210401b9b96141f30da7b. Ever since deck codes were introduced importing from urls is no longer maintained and will likely be removed eventually. \nYou can paste deck codes you copy from any website into hdt.. It seems to work fine for me so the protocol generally still works.\nThis is likely an issue with your Hearthstone and/or Battle.net installation. Try reinstalling those.. Got another report of this. Looks like HDT fails to detect that the bnet process is running.\n\n. If I recall correctly, this behavior exists because HDT needs to consider transformed entities the original entity for deck tracking purposes. . This behavior should be fixed with the next release. Decks will not be tagged as brawl if they have any non-brawl games.. IIRC, this is not consistent?. I haven't seen it not working lately \ud83d\ude05 . Unless there's a bug in the current implementation, I'm pretty much out of ideas for reliable ways of detecting this.. Looking at the powerlog from the replay above, the current implementation should work. So this is likely just a bug in https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/a437e722f1894087695aeab0366340ffa494a400. You are filtering to \"Format: Wild\" in the top screenshot.. Awesome, thanks!. For the icon, what do you think about dynamically adding (the same way the actual text is added) a \"5+\" in the top left of the spell icon. Good chance this spell cost pattern is going to be reused by blizzard at some point.. here's a nicer icon too:\n\n. Merged as https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/21740fdcaa74b2c20b19f277727be1b4455df3aa.\n\nAdded translations\nFixed the player tracker not being reset at the start of the game by removing the PogoHopperPlayedCount > 0 checks in OverlayWindow.Update.cs. Good chance this is actually the same issue as #3771 . You don't need to close the PR for that. Any changes you push to your fork will automatically show up here.. Thanks for the logs guys. I have a good idea what the issue is, let me see if I can reproduce it. . I just released v1.7.7, which should fix this. Let me know if you still have any issues after updating (restarting will force an update).. I released v1.7.7 about an hour ago to fix a bunch of deck tracking issues. Make sure you update to that.\n\nIf it still doesn't work with v1.7.7 please reproduce the issue once more and post the logs here. See https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/Reporting-Issues#hdt-log-files. I can't do anything without logs. Please see my post above.. Thanks for the log!\nSince I'm not close to legend currently I sadly can't test this myself.\nI'm fairly confident I fixed the issue from your log, @replaythegame, however I don't know whether there are more issues hiding underneath. \n(Anyone with this problem) Please install this development build and let me know if you still have the same issue and include the log if you do: https://github.com/HearthSim/HDT-dev-builds/releases/download/v1.7.7.3773/HDT-Installer.exe\nThis will just replace your current HDT installation (retain all config and stats) and automatically update to the next full release. . Thanks for testing @replaythegame!\nRolling out v1.7.8 now. Let me know if there are more issues.. Duplicate of #3798. :+1: Looks good. I agree this is pretty borderline and we won't support it, sorry.. will be fixed with the next release.. Is this missing something? I see two assignments to CurrentBlock.EntityDiscardedByArchivist, but no usage of it.. This is being handled via email.. This is probably an issue with the latest hearthstone patch and will fix itself once the expansion is released. HDT automatically detects which possible decks whizbang should have (the recipes), however the majority of these decks currently contain cards from the new expansion and blizzard added a temporary serverside override. . Did you confirm this works? I would guess that at the time this code is executed the entities health hasn't changed yet.. Cool. Can you fix the broken test (I'm gonna guess the test minion has no health, so by adding some), and add another test to specifically test that this happens when the health is < 1?. Great! Thank you!. Especially if this is intended to only work within a certain block (which if I understand correctly, it is), I agree this makes sense to have on Block rathern than GameState.. Thanks for the fix!\nAnd thanks for reviewing it @riQQ \ud83d\ude03 .. Thank you!. Looks good \ud83d\udc4d . What's your source for the exact changes? Is there some way I can verify this without doing starting way too many rumble runs?. Should be fixed with v1.8.0. Hey @Danstahr, we still need the CLA from you before we can merge this. Looks like you accepted the invite to the repo (https://github.com/HearthSim/cla). Let me know if you have any questions or need any help with it.. Oh sorry I thought I had merged this.\nThanks for the fix!\nAnd thanks for reviewing it @riQQ!. I see a nullreference exception waiting to happen here. Should probably be moved two lines down.\n. this needs to be CheckboxUseAnimations\n. Please change indention to tabs, that removes unnecessary changes like this one.\n. One more thing: selectedDeck could in theory be null here. I think in reality there is no way for this method to be called without a deck being selected, but FirstOrDefault() should be follow by a null check nonetheless.\n. There is no need for a new config value, checking IgnoreNewsId != -1 is sufficient.\n. Checking this removes the ability for me to remotely enable the news bar again, which might be useful is some cases.\n. Extracting MainWindow.BtnCloseNews_OnClick() to a new method and calling it here would be much cleaner.\n. Game.IsRunning is currently only updated in Core.UpdateOverlayAsync and therefore always false at this point.\n. Please squash this into the previous commit.\n. Please use (Card)entity.Card.Clone() instead of passing the original card object here (same for opponent).\n. Should not change EOF here.\n. Can be a local variable.\n. No need for this. Should be converted to an expression (public void UpdateWindowHeight() => Height = StackPanelMain.ActualHeight + 42;)\n. Should use var and name should start with lowercase.\n. Should use var.\n. Should use var.\n. Should use var, use HearthDb.CardIds instead of raw card id strings.\n. Should be converted to an expression.\n. Should use HearthDb.CardIds instead of raw card id strings. (E.g. Collectible.Mage.JainaProudmoore)\n. Needs to check if any tag contains the phrase \"adventure\" or \"pve\".\n. Needs to check if any tag contains the phrase \"brawl\". \"Taverl brawl\" would fail here.\n. Redundant else keywords.\n. Checking for contains rather than equality might also be better here.\n. Should be converted to an expression.\n. Sorry, I meant all of the 'else' here are unnecessary, not just the last one :).\n. You can write this as \nC#\nvar timerState = Convert.ToInt32(Config.Instance.HideOpponentTimer) << 2\n                | Convert.ToInt32(Config.Instance.HidePlayerTimer) << 1\n                | Convert.ToInt32(Config.Instance.HideTurnTimer);\ntimerState = timerState == 7 ? 0 : timerState + 1;\nConfig.Instance.HideOpponentTimer = (timerState & 4) > 0;\nConfig.Instance.HidePlayerTimer = (timerState & 2) > 0;\nConfig.Instance.HideTurnTimer = (timerState & 1) > 0;\nThis also allows you to get rid of the HideTimerCycle config value entirely.\n. System.Windows qualifier is unnecessary for this and the line above.\n. There should not be a change here.\nProbably inconsistent line endings :/? I need to reformat everything at some point.\n. No need for braces around a single line.\n. For consistency sake, the name should be CheckBoxImportAll and the events CheckBoxImportAll_OnModified.\n. Invert if to reduce nesting\n. This can be converted to foreach (also use var).\n. Use var for declarations (same for CheckBox below).\n. Using as instead of casting implies it can be null. You should either change this to a cast or nullcheck chk. (Casting should be fine here)\n. CheckBoxes are theoretically tri-state - i.e. they can be null. Use CheckBox.IsChecked.HasValue && CheckBox.IsChecked.Value or CheckBox.IsChecked ?? false here.\n. Should be var modifiedCount = 0; or int modifiedCount;.\n. == true is redundant when looking at a boolean.\nThis should be either chk.IsChecked.HasValue && chk.IsChecked.Value, chk.IsChecked ?? false or chk.IsChecked == true (in this case it's a bool?).\n. This can be converted to an expression. See here.\n. Since you are using this in OnModified as well, c and chk can be extracted to a GetCheckBox method, making both methods a bit cleaner.\n. There is no need to have this as a separate method, it can be directly in Import.\n. Possible NRE here? tracked == null is checked above but this is reached anyway.\n. Did you test this? I think switching languages might cause problems with the way this feature is implemented.\n. There should be a better way of doing it (e.g. using CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo(...).NativeName), but I think translating this might be fine for now.\n. That makes sense, I expected it more to basically reset when changing the language (or possibly crash)  because it uses different strings. \n. You need to use string.IsNullOrEmpty here. If entity or card are null this will return false.\n. Please use xaml to subscribe to default events.. You can just call UpdateSearchResult(TextBoxSearch.Text) here, no need to go through the event method.. Theres is a JADE_GOLEM tag on the player entity (Core.Game.PlayerEntity and OpponentEntity respectively), which is current max ATK/HEALTH. You should use that one.. Should be  Options_Overlay_Player_Label_Jade. PlayerEntity can be null at the beginning of the game. \nThis needs to be Core.Game.PlayerEntity?.HasTag(JADE_GOLEM) ?? false\nWe also have a static using statement for GameTag in here, it can just be JADE_GOLEM instead of GameTag.JADE_GOLEM.. Same as above.. Can be defined inside the if, please use var.. Please use var. return and continue (below) should go on new lines,\nNo space after if please (same below).. use Path.Combine(...). Please use the ++ operator we thankfully have in C# :)\n...python why T_T. Could be reversed to reduce nesting. Unused imports. Whitespace :). Empty method. You should use using instead of manually disposing.. Can go into the object initializer (new WebClient {Headers = ...). Variable should be lowercase. The if condition allows plugin to be null here.. Should be outside the loop. Object initializer, using. Variable should be lowercase. You can just return this condition. Methods should be CamelCase. using, object initializer. Methods should be CamelCase. This should either be a cast or have a null check. No need for string here. plugin can be null , should be either a cast or needs a null check. using, object intializer, cast/nullcheck SelectedItem. This can just be an else on the if below.. This should probably be $(OutDir)? Also, why not keep $(TargetDir)?. This doesn't seem to work for me. I get the same error as AppVeyor when running bootstrap locally on a clean clone.. Assuming the line above works, this can probably be removed.. This file should probably be removed.. Even though this is no longer necessary when it's a separate case: as implies the value could be null, so (ex as ReflectionTypeLoadException) should either be a cast or handle the null case. And since there is a type check before it, this should be a cast.. Also please use the string keyword rather than the String class.. Default should be changed to false, then this is gtm.. returns on new lines please (for every return). With C#7 you can now use variable patterns like if(depObj is DockPanel dockPanel) and drop the var dockPanel = depObj as DockPanel; below.\n(also applies to all other is-as here). \"control\" should be nameof(control) - not that important here but in general more renaming resistant.\n(same below). Can be protected. You can omit the get here: OptionsControl => CheckBox. ShowHDTLogo doesn't seem to be named correctly. But that aside, why is this called separately here (a separate method at all) and not at the end of InitializeTheme?. No spaces between if and the parenthesis.. Did you verify this works?. You can probably drop these or inline the methods here.. \"Windows Accent\" should be a class level const. This could be written as CreateWindowsAccentStyle(Config.Instance.AccentName == WindowAccentName). Why generate it if it's not used?. What is this?. The cast to byte isn't necessary here. Unnecessary variable - should just be the const too.. Close calls are unnecessary, the using statements do that. Should be var. Can we call this just \"FriendlyChallengeWatcher\"? :P. No one line if statements please, this being multi line or a method is fine.. I feel like this should be moved into a prop (something like \"MenuModes\").. Run (and Stop?) should only be executed if the config setting is enabled.. We can probably shorten this to at least HearthMirrorFriendlyChallengeProvider too.. You can just add a static method in the Watchers class.. Something like that, yes.. There should be no Plugins folder in the root directory - this shouldn't be here.. No underscores in field (or any) names.. No underscores in field (or any) names.. This is a pretty nasty side effect for a getter. DateShownOnDeckTooltip should implement its own switch logic.. Should probably just be named something generic like DateFormat.. Use CamcelCase without underscores.. These should be LocDescription with the according localization strings.. Need to be a localizable string.. Unnecessary added line. No whitespace between switch and then opening parenthesis. No whitespace between if and then opening parenthesis. No whitespace between if and then opening parenthesis. No whitespace between if and then opening parenthesis. This file shouldn't be here.. Should start with uppercase. Should start with uppercase. Should start with uppercase. Newline EOF missing - there shouldn't be any changes to this file.. The name is very unclear. Should probably be something like SelectedDateOnDecks.. *Active sounds like a boolean. Should be something like SelectedDateFormat.. This is a bit of a convoluted name. Something like DateType makes it more clear what this is and makes it more \"reusable\".. With renaming the enum to DateType this can just be None. (localization string should be renamed too). With renaming the enum to DateType this can just be LastPlayed. (localization string should be renamed too). With renaming the enum to DateType this can just be LastEdited. (localization string should be renamed too). These should just be deleted if the logic is no longer relevant.. These should just be deleted if the logic is no longer relevant.. Should either have a null check (e.g. (sender as Control)?.DateContext) or just be a cast. . The null check needs to happen outside of this.. This needs to be localized but I will take care of that.. This needs to be localized but I will take care of that.. Unused import.. No spaces between control statements and the opening parenthesis.\nHearthDb has consts for all card ids. This should be entity.CardId == HearthDb.CardIds.Collectible.Rogue.PogoHopper.. Braces should start on the same line as the control statement.. This is the player class, this is always either the local or the opposing player. Player.Play() is only called with entities for that player. . This class is already scoped to either the local or the opposing player. You only need one counter.. This should use Player.RevealedEntities. PlayerEntities contains e.g. cards in hand.. This should use also use Player.RevealedEntities.. You don't need this. (It's also named incorrectly). Instead of OpponentSeenPogoHopper, check OpponentPogoHopper != null.. Inconsistent whitespace. I think csproj files are usually indented with spaces.. You can just use entity.Card.Cost here. Entity.Card already makes the Database.GetCardFromId call.. One line per statement. (This and the 4 above). This needs to more gracefully handle the case where GetDeckTemplate returns null (likely in the case of a new set release with a dungeon run type mode). . Method names should be capitalized.. suggestion\n                            if(gameState.CurrentBlock.CardId == Collectible.Neutral.AugmentedElekk). suggestion. ",
    "michaelb7k": "I've got a glitch where the card ages of the opponents cards doesn't line up - this seems to be a similar problem.\nAlso, the horizontal position of the player's deck is set to 80% to get it to show on screen.\nThis glitch occurs with the latest version of the program, 0.3.11 and earlier versions.\nDesktop resolution (Win7x64) is set to 1920_1200\nHearthstone resolution (windowed) is set to 1920_1080\nCuriously, the resolution of the window that Hearthstone has set is not as above but rather ~1845*1080.\nAdjusting the CustomWidth and CustomHeight values in the config does alter where overlay sits but not by much - I'm unable to get the overlay to matchup.\n. Running with that unfortunately didn't fix the problem.\nConfig was renamed, no config settings altered running new exe, restarted Hearthstone aswell to no luck.\n. It looks like the tracker is just making the overlay bigger than it should be.\nDesktop resolution (Win7x64) is set to 1920_1200\nHearthstone resolution (windowed) is set to 1920_1080\nThe dimensions of the window that Hearthstone has set is not as above resolution but rather ~1845*1080px.\nBut setting:-\n  0\n0\n1460\n860\nWill give correctish results.\nWhen setting the tracker to auto-detecting size (custom values of -1) the overlay is also bigger than window.\nAlso, occasionally when alt-tabbing into Hearthstone card ages are shifting position upon x-axis by some smallish amount (other overlays are fine and are staying put when this occurs).\n. Using a desktop computer with a widescreen 24inch monitor (1920*1200).\nNo action has been taken when the card ages have shifted.\nSome further resolution testings:\n1920_1080 resolution\n1460_860 overlay\n1650_1080\n1320_860\n1600_900\n1280_720\nIs the result of the call to User32.GetWindowRect logged at all?\nThe rest of the overlay sizes and variables?\n. They are with the exception of the 1920_1080 resolution which is 1845_1080.\nIt seems like the overlay is out by 0.2 almost exactly in all cases - not sure if that's a hint to anything.\n. Each resolution has a different offset - they're not all offset by the same.\nIf it's just a few people experiencing this then perhaps there are other priorites to get to - no need to worry too much I guess.\n. Source of bug discovered.\nIf the dpi setting within Windows is not set to 100% (ie. font scaling is set to something other) then the overlay will not be the same size as the game window.\nIn Windows 7 right-click desktop -> Screen Resolution -> Make text and other items larger or smaller -> Setting to 100% fixes sizes issues for all resolutions.\nThe code fix would be to take current dpi of screen into account.\nThis also seems to fix all offsets issues - no offset adjustments required so far.\n. Awesome!\nGlad we were able to tackle that one - can the faq on the front page be updated now?\n. 'Prioritize golden when exporting'\nOccasionally when exporting a deck to Hearthstone it will use a golden version of a card when two normals exist of that card, with the option deselected - hard to reproduce bug, occurs occasionally - versions 0.3.9 and earlier.\nAlso when exporting decks to Hearthstone, the 'all mana' button/filter in Hearthstone should be selected first - other wise cards that differ from the selected mana cost can't be found and imported.\nNoticed in version 0.3.9\nMaybe the program could automatically press the 'all mana' button first before searching/selecting cards?\n. It happens perhaps once every 5-6 deck creations - not too often.\nI've noticed it in a priest deck with the card 'Mind Blast'.\nPerhaps the wait for the double click could be a tad longer? Before auto-clicking the gold version?\nAppreciate the hard work you've put into creating the program :-)\n. Could storing the files in %appdata% be optional?\nOr create an option for using the program in a \"portable\" mode?\nIt's great to have the program running on an external hdd along with Hearthstone itself - gaming on the go anywhere on any pc - sadly hard to do with files being stored in %appdata%.\nCheers!\n. Cool! Thanks very much.\n. Tool Tips: would it be possible to include just card text if including images is out-of-reach?\nSimilar to how Hearthhead website includes this functionality:-\nhttp://www.hearthhead.com/tooltips\nOn that page lists example of both card art and text only - the text only version looks like it could be almost just as useful (and simpler to).\n. Great work on the tooltips!\nI'm sure alot of people will appreciate them :-)\n. Keep the same font throughout the tooltip?\nHow about keeping the bold tags from the card's data? -> Bold the \"Battlecry:\" text portion?\n. Tooltips are working perfectly well thank you.\nCould it be an idea to include a card's 'race' on the tooltip if it has one replacing it's 'type'?\neg. River Crocolisk would show as being a 'beast' at bottom of tooltip, not as a minion.\nWould card 'rarity' be a useful inclusion? How about flavour text? Could people make use of these?\n. Instead of hiding the symbols, how about using a dash '-' instead of a '0' if a card has no attack damage/health associated with it?\nDurability displaying with health icon seems it would be fine.\n. I can try :-)\nThis is my first time programming collaboratively with others and first time with github - just learning the basics at the moment.\nI've cloned my fork which I think is the right thing to do? Do I have to add another upstream back to original project? All new to me :-)\n. That's ok - can see how it'd be handy when batch creating decks.\nAt the moment though, the new deck will not have those tags set - it's just kind of a graphical glitch where the check boxes are ticked but the tags are not actually set. Unticking and then re-ticking the checkbox will set the tags.\nCreating a new instance of Deck should copy the tags from the previous deck? Only if the previous deck was a newly created deck not an altered deck.\n. If the tracker were to know the current resolution the game was running at, this would help to improve the auto-clicker.\nCurrent resolution the game is running at:-\n%AppData%\\Local\\Blizzard\\Hearthstone\\options.txt\n. It was occuring occasionally before with the old WindowRect to.\n. One way could be to use the 'popout' link for the deck - http://www.arenavalue.com/deckpopout.php?id=xWSKJL\nThen sendkeys ctr-a (select all), ctr-c (copy to clipboard), possibly fully automated?\nJust require deck id from the end of url http://www.arenavalue.com/s/xWSKJL\nThere's also a json for each deck available at:-\nhttp://www.arenavalue.com/helper/getdata.php?deck=xWSKJL\nNot sure how to access it though.\nThat particular json:- (grabbed through firebug)\nhttp://pastebin.com/a8ZuZGrP\n. That's cool\nAre they something that ought to be changed in this pull request or changed in the master after merging?\n. Updated the searchbox change. Variable name changed and value changed to '0.92'\nAlso reverted a couple of other things I had changed aswell\n-adding back the delay between mouse down/up in deckexporter - not sure if delay necessary or not - worked ok without\n-unsure whether canvasinfo is required to be resized either - working without also\n. A tiny bug I had noticed  - hopefully fixed!\nSecrets panel works well - great work!\n. No worries!\n. Glad it works!\n.

    "anonymous555": "A paper came out describing how to predict cards.  That's the way to go... predict cards, not entire decks.\nhttps://cdn.elie.net/talks/I-am-a-legend-defcon-22-slides-final.pdf\n. What percentage of the time I play against each enemy.  Allow date ranges like you already have for individual decks.  This helps track the meta.\nhttp://hearthstonetracker.com/\nHas a pie chart of this.\n. Here's a rough sketch.  The grid area showing mechanics can go elsewhere if you like.  I would update when selecting a new deck.\n\n. How about if the colors only showed when editing a deck.

I think your fix just handles it if a player plays a secret.\n. OK, I did a quick test with the 2nd try, and it looks like it works.  Thanks for the fast turnaround!\n. No, it just displays a .png.  No change to any existing text display code above the image.\n. I don't have time now to do what Epix37 suggested.

See #324 \n. Same here, it looks like games after the 1st aren't recorded.\n. The behavior looks like a general problem, stat boosts are applied in the NEXT action, not during the spell/summon action in which their effects would occur as viewed by the player.\n. See https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/pull/324\n. See https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/pull/324\n. Some older decks have the arena tag.  Could use that\n. It's only partially fixed. The name is now fixed on the main screen, but when I got to the stats page, the opponent in the individual game says \"The Innkeeper\".  Also when I try to show the replay it only shows the old replay viewer, not the new one.\n. FYI:  In my own sandbox, I display icons next to decks showing what card sets the deck uses (brm, gvg, etc).  You might want to consider adding that as well while you're at it.\n\n. It makes it easy to identify older decks that don't use new card sets. Maybe an option to enable?  But as editing isn't a bad idea either.\n. \n. I already asked for this here\nhttps://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/1044\nHe shows it when you edit a deck, but it would be much better to show this on the deck picker without editing.\n. See https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/1088\n. See https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/1045\n. I put my player deck on the left.  When I have a very large deck (like a reno deck with no duplicates), rank detection breaks.  But for smaller decks, rank detection works fine.  I wonder if the larger decks are covering up the rank icon and that is breaking it.  I use the overlay for decks, not an external window.\n. Well now I don't know what's going on, I had rank detection fail even for a smaller deck\n\n. With 13.7, now it detects small decks just fine.\nBut 13.7 still has problems with large decks.  Now it properly detects it was ranked mode.  But the rank number itself is not found.  \nI'm attaching a log of an example.\nhdtlog.txt\n. Its fixed now please close.

Thanks for the quick answer!\n1. Aha, I didn't consider languages. But 100 MB, really? It could be a rather small JPG, as long as the text is readable.\n2. Wow, I see now. I think the problem is that the luminosity of the blue is exactly the same as the gray, so the highlight is virtually invisible. Try choosing a much lighter shade of blue.\n3. Thanks!\n4. I forgot I had a #4 the first time around, but here goes. Related to the deck manager capabilities, it would be great to show the mana curve for each deck.\n. 1. I understand that you don't want to increase the size of your download by 600-1200 MB (i.e. include card images for all languages). One idea could be to let users download their own images. Google helped me find a zip of all the English cards. If the deck tracker assumed some kind of standardized naming/numbering scheme, maybe foreign users could provide easy downloads of the entire card set in their language. But maybe this is too much trouble for you, given that it's not exactly a core feature of your program.\n2. Funny, I stared at the colors of that image for two minutes and was confused when I couldn't see a difference. :) I get it now. That's fine with me.\n3. Awesome!\n4. Even awesomer!\n. Gorgeous! Just had another idea if you feel like making this even more useful (tell me when to stop): you could color code the mana bars by card type so you get minions, spells and weapons stacked on top of each other. Here's a quick photoshop of your first image: http://imgur.com/OivjGkU\n. I'm not sure what is more impressive - the program itself, your willingness to adopt our ideas or the speed of your coding. Absolutely amazing stuff! Could you make the tooltips available in-game on both your own and the opponent's deck? Another idea: how about a hotkey to show/hide the tracker? I think a function key such as F5 would be best, but anything would work.\n. Epix37, I noticed this wasn't included in the 0.4.x releases. Is full text search on the to do list or have you decided against it? If it's off I wonder if michaelb7k has a compiled version with his patch lying around that I could try out?\n. Awesome, thanks! Seems to be working just fine. As a reward/punishment for following the whims of your users, I just added another request for improving the stats functionality in a new thread. :)\n. Some thoughts:\n- Yes, please squish the time string. Skip the seconds. An option for 24-hour time would make it shorter, and it would pander to us Europeans (we also prefer day-month-year or year-month-day). Or maybe just use regional system settings and skip the options?\n- Even more room for notes would be great, and it's already crowded. So I'd like to be able to resize the window, but maybe you like the look of the thin panel? Or do you just want a fixed size to simplify button layout in other views?\n- I'd skip the stats overview table, since it looks messy and class-based stats without subtypes aren't very relevant anyway. I'd prefer aggregate numbers showing only something like: \"Win rate 55.0% (22 wins, 18 losses)\", but have nearby filtering options for class, date, notes, etc. that update these numbers dynamically. One decimal is more than enough for win rates, and no need to show loss rates. Note that filtering on notes is important!\n- I'd rather not have win rates on the deck selection buttons. They looked much cleaner before, and many of my deck names are now truncated. Perhaps show the same win rate string for the selected deck just above the mana curve?\n\nAll of the above are just my own preferences, feel free to disagree!\n. I take back what I said about the stats table, this version looks really nice. Please also consider filtering on notes, even if it's way down on your priorities list!\nAn idea for game details: would it be possible to record attacks and other game events in the log? Even if it becomes too messy to display in the tracker, then it would be possible to reconstruct the entire game. Maybe your tracker version 23.0 could feature an entire game replayer? :) Or someone else could code one using your log files ...\n. Too bad about the attacks. A combobox wouldn't work for the type of notes I take, because I jot down both hand type and special cards (e.g. \"ramp druid: ragnaros + ysera\"). This creates far too many combinations for a combobox. I think a text box would be best, with a contains-type filter. So \"zoo\" would match zoo, zoolock, and naxx zoo.\n. Well, you may want to filter on almost any column, so how about putting the comboboxes and textboxes right above the corresponding columns? I think they should be near the stats that they affect. You could also consider deleting the \"edit note\" button and putting the note textbox near the top of the game details screen.\n. I agree that features that could affect gameplay should be avoided because Blizzard may blacklist this program once they start smacking down on the growing bot infestation. The in-game decklists just give \"passive advantages\" that could also be achieved by taking paper notes, so Blizzard probably won't ban the tracker because of this. But maybe speeding up animations could possibly cross the line.\nJust to contradict myself a bit - an autosquelch feature would be awesome ... :)\n. Would it be possible to add the announced GvG cards to the database so that we can start building decks with them in the tracker? This would be useful even if they only had placeholder graphics for now (and even if all new cards used the same image). \nHere are all the cards that have been revealed (the site updates as new cards become known):\nhttp://www.hearthpwn.com/news/675-blizzcon-2014-new-expansion-announced-goblins-vs\nHere is a clean GvG image that you could crop:\nhttp://wow.zamimg.com/images/hearthstone/exp1/Goblins-vs-Gnomes-Key-Art-resized.jpg\n. Point taken about http://hearthstonejson.com, I didn't know that the card database was an external effort. But I don't see how having access to unplayable cards in the tracker would complicate the deck creation process. You can currently export decks with legendaries or other cards that you don't own yet into Hearthstone. All that happens is that unowned cards get skipped (because you get no hits in the HS card search box).\n. Do you know if Robert at hearthstonejson is planning an update? I e-mailed him yesterday but no response yet. Otherwise, maybe it would be possible to use his code to create the JSON file with the card info directly from the game?\nhttps://github.com/Sembiance/hearthstonejson\n.

Thanks, but that doesn't work for me. For some strange reason Hearthstone displays at somewhat smaller than my screen even when I set it to my full screen resolution (1920x1200).\nAs a workaround to make the prompt a bit less annoying, would it be possible to implement an optional delay of 5 seconds or so before it pops up?\nEDIT: Just got a better idea. Instead of a time delay, can you have the prompt wait until the user clicks past the victory/defeat screen? There seems to be an event for this, because when the prompt pops up the win or loss hasn't yet been registered in the tracker. But it is recorded as soon as you return to HS and click past that screen.\n. There already is one, see under Options/Tracker/General.\nHowever, there is a tiny glitch. The note dialog pops up as it should, but then the tracker window immediately steals its focus so you have to move or minimize the tracker to find it again. Epix37, consider this a small bug report!\n. Fullscreen, back in menu.\n. Things seem to have changed since BRM. Previously when I returned to HS menu after a game I was thrown back to the desktop, the note dialog popped up on top temporarily, and about a second later its focus got stolen by the main tracker window. I had to rummage around to find the dialog, enter the note, and alt-tab back to HS. (Often HS got stuck minimized, and neither alt-tabbing nor using the taskbar could maximize it again. Only way to get it back was using the task manager to maximize hearthstone.exe.)\nNow when a game ends the note dialog pops up on top of HS itself (in fullscreen mode). I enter the note and continue playing without seeing the desktop. Perfect behavior IMO. With BRM there were some changes related to fullscreen mode, so maybe everything is fixed now.\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/30yehq/rejoice_fullscreen_is_fixed/\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/317if2/dual_monitor_issue_fixed/\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/3127mh/windowed_fullscreen_works_again/\nI've only played a few games so I'm not sure everything is OK yet. Could you keep this issue open a few more days?\n. Just want to bump this up again. I think the issue was temporarily fixed by one of Blizzard's patches, but some time between the above comments in early April and early June the focus problem came back. Just like Elitesparkle says, the box has no focus when it pops up. I've reproduced this on three different computers with various versions of Windows (7, 8 and 8.1).\n. Interesting, I haven't played today so I haven't tested the latest update. I don't know how auto deck selection works - I assume it can only choose decks based on the cards that have been drawn, right? So if two decks differ based on only a card or two, do have to draw those cards to distinguish them. Or is it smarter somehow?\nThanks for the new option! \n. I haven't tried ranked in the new version yet, but I just played 23 arena games. Only 13 of those games were recorded at all, and none of them were identified as arena games (all were recorded as \"None\"). No dimming or similar software in use.\n. Had time to test a quick arena run with PRE2. Went 6-3, all games recorded correctly. Seems OK now!\n. Late to the party, but let me add my two cents anyway. I really miss double-click to edit. I'm a long time user of HDT and all my deck building and editing is done in the tracker. It's just so much faster and easier than doing it in Hearthstone. I don't use hsreplay, so now double-clicking on the deck does absolutely nothing instead of something very useful. Please at least give us an option to enable it!\n. ",

The other games' modes were all 'ranked' except for the last ranked game that I played yesterday, which also had the mode 'none' (doesn't show my rank as well). Not sure if this is important for you.\n. After I fixed it and removed around 240 matches, the following popup keeps coming up when I start the tracker.\n\nAfter clicking 'fix now', the tracker supposedly fixes it, but when I restart the tracker, I get the same popup. Should I just press don't fix?\n\n\n\n\nThey might be stats from a deleted deck or perhaps from a time when HDT didn't record the deck names or something like that. I guess the algorithm to detect duplicates fucks up somewhere (since I don't think those are really duplicate matches, not sure though), but I'm not sure why I keep getting the popup; they should have been deleted.\n. I really need some glasses... Great that it's being fixed and thanks for HDT; it's a great tool!\n. ",

Now that you added winrate to decks (that was awseome!), how do you see the possibility of order the decks by winrate?\nThank you guys for your hard work!!\n. Nice :D\n. Yes, I extract the new releases in the tracker folder overwriting the files and works nice :)\n. Yep, It's very important to know if the card is in his hand or if it was discarded :)\n. It's the psychology of the game. If you are playing handlock and you discard molten or similiar your play style change because you didn't have access to this card or you can rely on get the other copy. Maybe sounds weird but I think it's very important to difference between the cards played and the cards discarded to read the future plays, and even more in tournaments :)\n. Or maybe in grey? Nowadays I take notes when the opponent discard so it's no a big deal, just a suggestion hoping that you'll find a better solution :)\n.

    "ghost": "It just happened again. Nothing wrong with the card-mark this time.\nI played Mukla, my opponent used the 2 bananas and everything was fine.\nThen I ran Mukla into a freezing trap (my opponent was a Hunter).\nI replayed Mukla, but the 3rd and 4th Bananas he played were not added at all in my opponent's decklist (maybe you limited the counter for each card to 2).\nUnfortunately, I forgot to try to disconnect and reconnect...\nHere is the log file : http://wikisend.com/download/321040/output_log.txt\n. Another game.\nI tried to mill a Mage with Mukla. He received only 1 banana, the other one being burned.\nHe then used his only banana but it was written in white in his decklist (as a normal card).\nI didn't realized it immediately so i can't say when that happened but a few turn later, I noticed he had a Stolen card-mark in his hand (which he got the turn I played Mukla if I believe the age number). He never played that card so I don't know what it was (I am 90% sure I milled the second banana but there is a chance it might be my bad on this one (but then, why didn't he play it ALL game long if it was a banana?)).\nI restarted the tracker with no positive result.\nAnyway, here is the log file : http://wikisend.com/download/445302/output_log.txt\n.

The whole process of that New Deck tab confuses me.\nFirst, those buttons do not look like tabs, yet they function just like them.\nI think the buttons should be made to look like \"tabs\"\nBeyond that fact, I am not sure, I just want some kind of queue of how to close that deck, or something....You know what I mean.\n. Maybe some kind programmer out there will be able to fix this issue\nAnyone want to try!!!!\n. I just realized that the text for the button of that tab you are currently on changes to blue.\nWhat if we changed the button's background color as well when it is selected so it is MUCH easier to see?\n. First we must clean the MainWindow's code then that might work\n. @Epix37 since @waibcam added special features for our application into hearthnews, maybe we would want to make our application available in French?\n. @Epix37 how do you want to do this?

    "midorlo": "I would not take netdecks into account for this. There are tons of tons of duplicates that would mess up the results. Also - as you stated - you would have to maintain a full database for that which is bad. I propose to just query \"my decks\" (like shown in the pseudocode). Anyone actually powerusing your software (like me :P) will setup his decklists to guess for miracles, handlocks etc and then benefit from \"enemy has a draw chance of X for his molten giant\".\n. I was trying to circumvent the idea of a database because it would require alot of flat work that would be better put in code instead. Im still convinced that one doesnt really need one, but thats just my opinion :)\nTalking for myself, I save my variations. I use hss.io for deck management and your software for ingame assistance. As your software is able to import from them, it's win-win for me. But summing up your answer, you may be right for the casual user, and that's what counts at the end of the day I think :(\nFinally, looking at blacking out decks, I agree. Promting to change the deck's guess may be better than just doing it. But then, there are some really creative design decisions following up: Howto react visually to this? Just append the joker cards to the deck and coloring them? What about drawing chances? They're based on absolute occurences of cards which at this point would be unknown.\n. Wow that was fast. Good to hear :)\n. Is this still on the list? :P \n. ;(\n. Your code is yet too much for me to dive in, but maybe adding a mockup helps:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/d4J1GtR.png\nThings kept in mind:\n- The use case is answering the question: How did I perform today/this week, season,...?\n- No other use case should be threathened. One can x-out irrelevant data from the view.\n- The use case can be disabled (options -> [x] show global statistics)\nThe only \"not so userfriendly\" thing will be the games list. Imho, x-out'ing the \"deck\" statistics should change the games view to represent the global statistics. Another approach could be to work with click selections\n. - I guess it misses a mouse interaction for deselecting decks. Clicking(or maybe rightclicking?) a selected deck should deselect it.\n- Having no deck selected should disable the \"Current Deck\" View from the stats. \n- Having no deck still says  \"Deck : Mydeck(example)\" when opening the Stats view.\nDidnt find anything else, you did a pretty good job :)\n. Exactly :) \n. I spend some more time on this and now im pretty sure this should be done via a Tag Class. This will allow you to reuse it in various other contexts and maintain efficient matching etc.. Also, a possible class \"EnemyPlayer\" and \"EnemyDeck\" will give this context a huge data advantage(since you just inherit them and can use all your code for storing/loading). \nIll leave you the following diagrams (done on a tablet in a train, dont blame me ^^):\n\n\n\nAs for the class diagram, you will probably be able to add the following use cases:\n- How did I perform vs PlayerX?\n- What Decks does PlayerX play?\n- How many \"Cenarius\" did I see in Druid decks percentually? This week?\n- How many Players tagged \"Ropeplayers\" did I yet collect? How many of them have the tag \"bm\"? How many of them did I match against this week?\nAs you can see, the new data is flexible as hell, the use cases can probably be extended. \nI was probably totally unable to get my mind down to text, please ask for any unclear parts :-)\n. https://github.com/netzgeist/hearthstone-playernotes\nI made myself a small program, keeping track of players and notes.

    "sho-87": "what about having users do the deck database generation for you?\nwhenever a user of the tracker creates a new deck, it could auto upload to a database and check to see if the deck (or similar) already exists in the db. If so, ignore it, else upload the deck.\nthen when you're playing you can use whatever method you want to check off cards in the deck db to find the most likely match\nyou're still using a database, but this seems to be the best of both worlds as you circumvent the major headache of 1) creating the initial database, and 2) keeping it up to date. new decks would be auto uploaded to the db by users as the meta changes, and you can even purge the tables after x number of weeks/months\n. could you not just add a 'd' next to discarded cards?\n. Yeah Hearthstone runs on C, but I have the tracker on D (actually inside a dropbox folder so I can run it with the same config on desktop and laptop). I assume there will be a fix for this and that running on the same drive is not a requirement?\nI don't think its related to having multiple instances running.

Instead of OCR text recognition via a screenshot of the decklist (difficult because of the font probably), it could be possible to correlate each individual card icon to which card that icon represents.\nSince each icon is a specific size, you could have the deck tracker take a screenshot of the decklist, horizontally slice the decklist screenshot every X vertical pixels so it creates a separate image for each card (saved to a temporary folder), and then have the slices compared against a bank of all possibilities (4 for each card, gold or regular versions as well as 1 or 2 of that card).\nI'm no programmer, so this is all theory, but it does at least sound possible.\n.

OK found what it is: http://puu.sh/aH2t1/f89f69dd7d.jpg\nNo much you can do I guess ...\nThe only solution is to remove the prioritization for golden, right ?\n. hell yeah ! :)\n. Thanks :)\n. I'm really glad this is coming out.\nI just had the time to make few games yesterday evening when I saw your message.\nIt works fine for me but I guess we'll need more time to check it out ;)\nNot sure this is was you're expecting but I'm such a big fan of stats that I have to ask you for some improvements/todo : \n1. Is it possible to differentiate the stats between ranked/casual/adventure/arena mode ?\n2. Can you save, for each game, the cards played by the opponent player and make this \"deck\" taggable ?\n3. Do you plan to add filters on the Games ?\n4. Do you think it is technically possible to save your current rank ?\n5. Same for oppenent + his/her name as well ?\n6. Do you plan to add some graphics ? (like Hearthstone Tracker)\n7. Is it technically possible to track on which server are we (US, EU, Asia) ?\nI'll stop there for now :)\nI'm sorry if it's too much ... but this tool has again more potential with the stats ! :)\nGood job again ! You rock !\n. cool :)\n1 Yes there are for each menu button. If I'm not mistaken, it is :\nPlay: [Bob] ---RegisterScreenTourneys---\nSolo Adventures (+ Friend challenge ?) : [Bob] ---RegisterFriendChallenge---\nThe Arena: [Bob] ---RegisterScreenForge---\nThis occurs, before and after the game.\nHowever, I'm not sure if we can make the different bewteen ranked and casual/practice in Play mode... to investigate. The point 5 will help.\n2. sounds good !\n3. Well, beeing able to view only Ranked games or Won game, filter by date (specific dates or things like this month, last month, last week, this week, yesterday, today etc.)\nOf course, the table on the top should align with the results from the filters\n4. That's too bad. This information will be perfect for statistics purposes\n5. This point is less important and definitely a nice to have but can wait for better idea.\n6. cool\n7. not ideal but again, this is a nice to have.\n. Great!\nAs for the naming, I'm wondering if a table, like you have of the left side for Games, won't be better.\nYou could have colums like: Turn (0,1,2,etc.) Player (You, Ennemy), Action (Play, Draws, Mulligan, Pass ?), Card (the name of the card), Time (how many sec since begining of the turn)\nOf course, i'm not sure you could place the image of the card in the table (maybe a tooltip though) but I think it will be more readable like this.\nDoes it make sense ?\n. Honestly, I don't think this is a must have, really.\nIt's a nice to have maybe, but not more and definitely not the thing that this tool is missing.\n. I'm sorry if you took it like that. I didn't want to be rude but simply trying to place some priority into all demands Epix got.\nHowever I'll explain why I think this is not a must have:\nAs you said, all websites have this feature on (my website does for instance) but it makes sense because it is a website, not a software .\nHere, using this tool means you have PC with Hearthstone installed so you have already access to your collection of cards.\nAlso, most of people are importing decks created from communities on fan sites and, I think, only quite a few are doing it from the tool. And those people do probably know the cards and don't need to get details on it.\nNow, again, I'm not saying this shouldn't be done but I'm just saying that this is maybe a low priority.\n.

With my change it now interprets that as a legitimate coordinate.\n. Yeah it's weird. Is this something inherent to WPF @Epix37? What made you think that was a special value before? I didn't realise. Figured you just used -32000 as an arbitrary negative value before.\n. Yeah it's weird. Is this something inherent to WPF @Epix37? What made you think that was a special value before? I didn't realise. Figured you just used -32000 as an arbitrary negative value before.\n. Yeah I agree. The delay thing seems a bit hacky though. Like you say there must be some better way.\n. Yeah I agree. The delay thing seems a bit hacky though. Like you say there must be some better way.\n. Though it's probably worth getting out a quick hacky fix anyway to minimize the number of users who experience this problem. They won't even see the update screen to download the fixed version :(\n.

Hopefully nobody will be required to edit config files.\n@Epix37 Could just check if the Left and Top values are -32000 in LocationChanged event for now, and if so don't update the config variables.\nThis affects the PlayerWindow, OpponentWindow, and TimerWindow too.\n. @dhoepelman Yeah it'll still be solved if they know to check the release page and download the latest version.

Alright working on it, shouldn't take long.\n. Alright working on it, shouldn't take long.\n. Thanks for the help @dhoepelman :)\n. It's strange. I'm watching two events that fire when you minimize the window. \nOn my machine the first one that fires is the LocationChanged event. You can see in the event handler that the values for Window.Left and Window.Top have been changed to -32000. \nAfter that it fires the StateChanged event to inform you that the WindowState property has been changed to mimimized. Surprisingly though, here the Windows.Left and Windows.Top are back to normal. So it doesn't stay as -32000 the whole time it is minimized.\nIf you add the async and a small 1ms delay in the LocationChanged event, the values are also back to normal there too. So it's a very brief moment of time when that is the case.\n. Ah right, that's interesting yeah. Thanks.\n\nFinally the Windows 95 window manager tried coordinates (3000, 3000), This seemed to keep everybody happy. Not negative, not too large, but large enough that it wouldn't show up on the screen (at least not at screen resolutions that were readily available in 1995).\nIf you have a triple-monitor Windows 98 machine lying around, you can try this: Set the resolution of each monitor to 1024x768 and place them corner-to-corner. At the bottom right corner of the third monitor, you will see all your minimized windows parked out in the boonies.\"\n\nThat's hilarious.\nI realized you can pass a 'TimeSpan(long)' to Task.Delay to delay for increments of 100 nanoseconds. On my machine it turns from -32000 back to normal again somewhere between 0.1 ms and 1 ms.\n. We could just change it so that it only saves the window position on shutdown. We don't really need to keep track of every time the window location changes. It's not like it's saving the config file off every time either, so even if the program crashes it wouldn't be saved (not suggesting we do this or it'd save the file anew for every pixel moved while dragging). \nSame with other events like window heights and such things.\n. It should do because it's only a brief moment when that value is set, and then it goes back to normal. You'd have to minimize AND exit the program within a very small window, and that probably wouldn't even work because the WM_CLOSE message would probably be queued up to be processed after whatever message ends up setting the value back to normal. I could probably confirm that with Spy++. I'll have a look later on.\n. Good changes. \nI was thinking, we could also rename the Left and Top variables now like you did with 7b9b054, and remove the -32000 checks on load. Everybody's window positions will reset this time but then hopefully that will be the last of it.\n. Maybe yeah.\n. All right let's do it that way. I'll work on it now unless you want to do it?\n. Ok :) \n. Just ran into a bit of a weird bug with SerializableVersion.ToString().\n``` csharp\nSerializableVersion foo = new SerializableVersion();\nfoo.Major = 0;\nfoo.Minor = 3;\nfoo.Build = 0;\nfoo.Revision = 21;\nVersion bar = new Version(major:0, minor:3, build:0, revision:21);\nConsole.WriteLine(foo.ToString());\nConsole.WriteLine(bar.ToString());\n```\nThis outputs:\n\n0.3.21.0\n0.3.0.21\n\nHow bizarre!\nSo if you create a new Version(foo.ToString()), it interprets the incorrect string and so constructs an incorrect Version too. This means that Helper.GetCurrentVersion() technically doesn't load Version.xml correctly. It gets the build and revision numbers from Version.xml reversed and always has. So now they're reversed in the config files too.\nThat makes the logic in ConvertLegacyConfig a bit strange. I could just use configVersion <= new Version(major:0, minor:3, build:21, revision:0) to make the comparison. That works but I am wondering if it will cause other problems later on.\n. Yeah, unfortunately if you ever increment the build number and reset revision to zero in Version.xml (which is an increase in version number according to major.minor[.build[.revision]] interpretation), then when loaded it will think the new version is less than the previous version. That will certainly cause problems if I simply use configVersion <= new Version(major:0, minor:3, build:21, revision:0).\n. I'm thinking that maybe you already knew about this and never intend to increment the build number in Version.xml, since you do refer to it as v0.3.21 and not v0.3.0.21 like Version.xml might suggest. And then it just so happens that, when loaded, the revision number becomes the correct build number anyway in the program :)\nIf that's the case then am I free to use configVersion <= new Version(major:0, minor:3, build:21, revision:0) after all? It wouldn't hurt if you never increment the build number. You could even remove the Build field from Version.xml completely, so it doesn't tempt you.\nIf you ever do increment the build number then the update checking mechanism will fail too, as it will think the newVersion < currentVersion.\n. Ah I feel silly now. Just realised SerializableVersion is a part of the project. I thought it was a class in the standard library!\n. Oh, that's weird. I was using new Version(0, 3, 21, 0) when I tested it, and then I guess I figured I could just remove the last argument if we don't care about it. Didn't think to re-test it. Very surprised the default is -1 but nice catch!\n. Hi axewind,\nIf this is the same problem as issue #135 then there should be a fix for this in the next version, but for now try alt+tabbing to the deck tracker and then pressing WindowsKey+RightArrow. This should move the window into view. If it doesn't work try Alt+Space and then X.\nIt's caused by closing the application while it is minimised. The window's position gets saved as a crazy large negative number, and then of course you can't see it when you next open it. Until recently all negative window positions were ignored so it didn't show up as a problem.\n. If he has a Crash Reports folder, it'll probably be in System32 (or SysWOW64 on 64-bit Windows; that's where it redirects 32-bit programs, which is probably why copying Version.xml into System32 didn't work). It looks like that's where his current directory was set to, for some reason. You can achieve a similar thing if you launch an elevated command prompt and then type the full path of the exe to run it:\n\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32>\"C:\\Hearthstone Deck Tracker\\Hearthstone Deck Tracker.exe\"\n\nYou can also edit the 'Start in' field of a shortcut to change this.\nWere you doing anything funny like this to run the application, @Nhyte?\n. Yeah the program doesn't crash if it can't read Version.xml. It just keeps going so it doesn't appear in the crash reports. But then I guess the next file it tries to open is the program's icon, and when that fails the program crashes with that exception above. I can see that same thing in my own Crash Reports log in SysWOW64.\nNot sure why that's happening for users though, unless they're launching the app in these weird ways.\n. How about this? https://github.com/dvide/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/66083dd7f86b55114cd1b368c97bfdc49e468fdb\nYou can test it with the debugger by going to Properties for the project -> Debug -> Working directory. If you set this to some other random folder, it'll use that as the working directory when you launch the program using the debugger. The line of code I added simply sets the current working directory to the path of the exe at the start, so it ends up having no effect. Without the line of code it should crash in the same way above.\n. Yeah. I'm not sure what's causing it for the users, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't have anything to do with Version.xml or .ico files in particular. They're just the symptoms of the working directory not being what is expected.\n. Oh that's interesting. Perhaps what I said isn't true then.\n. Yeah I'm surprised it kept running. If the working directory was simply wrong then it should surely have crashed here, causing the .ico exception like it did for me while testing it.\nWhat do you mean by the config file? I don't think it will end up raising an exception anyway there because the AppData path is absolute, rather than relative to the working directory. Even if it's set to use a local config file, it won't matter if the config file doesn't exist where it's looking for it. It will just assume it's a new user and try to create a new config there. The only thing that would matter is if the user doesn't have write access to that folder.\n. Yeah that's very odd :) I have no idea.\n. My mum experienced this same NullPointer crash right after closing track-o-bot inbetween games, while HearthstoneDeckTracker was still open and Hearthstone was in the menu. When starting the next game the crash occurred.\nWe wanted to test whether track-o-bot was conflicting with HearthstoneDeckTracker and causing the other issue we were investigating (issue #175).\nThe crash may have just been a coincidence at that time though, caused by something else.\n. Yeah that seems more likely. Incidentally, I believe you can tell that it's not cardId because cardId isn't being dereferenced there specifically. So if cardId was null, then null would just be passed into the other functions where cardId is an argument. If and when cardId is first dereferenced in one of those functions, that's where the exception would be raised, and so that function would be at the top of the stack trace in the crash report.\n. Nice one. Auto-updater is sweet! :)\n. Looks good to me :)\n. Just had an idea. Not sure whether it's a good one but I'll run it by you guys.\nOn the deck export dialog, ask the user whether he/she owns a golden Feugen or Stalagg. These options would only show up if you're actually exporting a Feugen or Stalagg, and we will remember the setting so it will be seamless the next time. Default to 'No' of course as most people won't have them.\n\nOnly problem would be having to create a custom dialog control for this purpose.\n. Could do. I'm aware that it's probably a lot of work to create a custom messagebox dialog just for this purpose, for very little gain. I don't have much experience with WPF but I might have a go at implementing it, just for the fun and learning how to do it. \nWhat I don't want is to pop-up a separate window for this, so I'll have to figure out how to create a custom modal messagebox overlay like the one that already exists\u2014just with the added options on it. I like the way those messagebox dialogs are built right into their parent window and gray out the background and everything while they're open. Maybe if I take a look at how the MahApps library creates them, that will help to create a custom one.\nI do think the mockup is a good solution UI wise, because it lets the user know there is a potential problem right when they're exporting a deck, rather than having to notice the settings in the options tab and remember their implications for later. After all, it might be a year before they actually export a deck with Feugen and are surprised when it screws up. With the mockup, they're not likely to miss the questions and end up surprised. Likewise, it doesn't clutter the options tab with obscure settings, and in fact doesn't even show up at all if you're not exporting a Feugen or Stalagg.\n. That looks really good Epix!\n. I think this might be because file handles could still be open after enumerating through the temp files to copy them. When Updater tries to recursively delete the temp folder, it fails because it can't delete a file with a handle still open, and then the directory isn't empty, etc, causing this issue. I've created a pull request to at least stop it from crashing when this happens. It won't matter anyway if the temp folder doesn't get cleaned up, so we can get away with just fixing the symptom. Either way, the folder should get deleted next time the Updater starts (by then the file handles should have been released).\n. @Epix37 I've updated this to work with the new deck picker. Don't merge this yet as I haven't tested it much. Just wanted to share it with you to see what you think for now.\n. Here's what it looks like with the icon:\n\n. I don't think we should sync the archived status with HearthStats because of the way it works on there. It seems that on HearthStats, decks are automatically archived if they aren't used within a week, and there is no way to manually archive or unarchive a deck. I don't like that as I'd prefer to manage it manually, and in any case if we sync that data down from HearthStats people might get confused when their decks disappear.\nIt also doesn't seem to respect its own rules when games are uploaded via HDT. What I mean is, on HearthStats, I've got decks that have been archived automatically even though I have definitely played games with them in the past week. Perhaps it doesn't automatically unarchive a deck unless the game was added on the site manually or uploaded with their own client. It doesn't seem to respect it when HDT uploads the game (if that makes sense).\n. Just added the feature to automatically unarchive the deck if you edit it. Also EDIT > CLONE creates the cloned deck as unarchived. Because of this, I also changed it so that the cloned deck is automatically selected for you (in the same way that saving a new deck is automatically selected, with SAVE AS NEW or whatever). That way it's not creating the clone unarchived but leaving you in the archived class where you can't see it.\nHope that's okay.\n. Question: Do you think auto deck selection should filter out archived decks, or allow it to select them like any other deck? I'm not sure what the best thing would be there. I actually don't use it tbh (always select my deck manually) so I have no real understanding of what it does and its limitations.\n. What do you mean about \"[Archived]\" in the note?\n. Oh I see, so that it will sync the archived flag to other computers as well. Yeah, that makes sense, I wasn't thinking of that case.\n. I'm having an issue with deck versions where the master deck has archived=true, but an earlier version has archived=false and it's messing things up. I'm really confused right now :P\nIs DeckList.Instance.ActiveDeck always supposed to be the master deck, and DeckList.Instance.ActiveDeckVersion supposed to be the active version only? Say if you had a deck with 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2, and 1.1 is currently selected, is ActiveDeck supposed to always be 1.2 (the master deck which encompasses the others), and ActiveDeckVersion is supposed to be 1.1? That's how I thought it was supposed to work, or am I not understanding this?\n. Yeah I could do that I suppose. What I'm confused about actually is why AddUrlToNote or PostDeckAsync only ever seems to run once, with version 1.0 of deck.\nI have a deck with two versions, 1.1 and 1.0. When I delete the deck on HearthStats (HEARTHSTATS > DELETE SELECTED DECK) and resync, it only seems to run PostDeckAsync once for v1.0 (from what I can tell, using a breakpoint). Yet 1.1 is definitely being uploaded as well. Where is it uploading 1.1? :P\n. Ah okay I see. So I guess the easiest answer is to do what you said, just setting the archived flag on all versions.\nThough it seems that there is an issue with it uploading the correct note as well then. If I create a deck and add a note, then add a version 1.1 and then change the note, then I close HDT and delete PlayerDecks.xml. When I reopen it and sync, it will download the old note.\n. Yeah that's another issue. The same is true atm for archiving. If I archive a deck, it won't update the note on HearthStats to add the [HDT-archived] tag because there's nothing that tells it to. But I think that's technically a different issue really that needs to be addressed as well.\nProbably shouldn't reupload the whole deck again just for that either, if the API allows you to just update the note itself.\n. Is that not a bit overkill? In terms of reuploading the cards and everything all over again. Might be better to create a UpdateNoteAsync specifically for when only the note needs to change.\n. I've reworked the DeckPickerClassItem selection logic in NewDeckPicker.Selector_OnSelectionChanged. This has to do with multiple class selections. This fixes two existing bugs and also allows it to work with the new archived class.\nI'll explain how to reproduce the two existing bugs:\n1. Click on a class like Mage, then Ctrl-click 'All'. Instead of multi-selecting, it replaces the existing selection with 'All'. This was working as intended, because 'All' encompasses Mage anyway. However, this didn't work in reverse. If you click 'All' first, then Ctrl-click on Mage, it allows you to select them both. The changes fix this inconsistency. If 'All' is selected and you try to add a class other than 'Archived' to the existing selection, it will not allow it.\n2. Like above, click on a class like Mage, then Ctrl-click 'All'. Now click on 'Mage' again (without Ctrl). Previously it didn't reselect Mage. This was because the underlying control still thought Mage was selected when you Ctrl-clicked on 'All'. It looks unselected because its OnDeselected event was raised (by us), but the underlying control still thought that it was selected, so when you click on Mage again it doesn't consider it a new addition to the selection. The changes fix this problem too.\nThe logic now works with the new Archived class too. 'Archived' can be selected with any other class, including 'All'. All cannot be selected with any class except for 'Archived'. I like it this way because you can select 'All' and 'Archived' together and see all the decks, whether they're archived or not, and the little marker icon on the NewDeckPickerItem is really handy for differentiating between them. Same with using 'Archived' with specific classes.\nThe logic is very nested and fairly hairy but I thoroughly tested all possible code paths and combinations and I'm confident this is working very well now.\n. Definite improvement but not sure about the ALLCAPS. I started using CamelCase to save room, because deck names can't be longer than 24 chars in game. Now my MIDRANGEECHOMAGE (MidrangeEchoMage) reads more like MIDRANGEE CHO MAGE to my brain! :D\n. @Elitesparkle I wasn't saying that it exported as uppercase (didn't try it). Just meant that I stopped putting spaces in my deck names to save characters, and started using CamelCase to distinguish words.\n@Epix37 Don't worry about implementing this option just for me. I've put spaces back in the deck names and it's fine. I don't care about it that much. Only do it if enough other people really want it too.\n. Damn sorry, unfortunately we closed it since. We also did another full sync and downloaded the old decks on HearthStats this time, and it seemed to assign the old games to those decks correctly but the 2000 odd games in 'Strifecro MechMage Boom' still remained there too. In other words there were duplicate entries for each old game, one assigned to the correct deck and one to 'Strifecro MechMage Boom'. We deleted them all from 'Strifecro MechMage Boom' and everything seems fine now, other than maybe a few other bugs which I'll report in other threads.\n. Okay. Hope it works (don't think we'll be able to test the fix). As I say we've already deleted those extra games and it seems ok now. Hopefully it won't cause any issues that we didn't logout first or wait for the update :)\n. It didn't, thankfully (though she wouldn't have minded anyway).\n. Ah yes you're right. Those are all decks with versions :)\n. Just had a closer look. All versions are identical, both on HearthStats and HDT (despite the deck history column showing changes, which I assume are correct but I cannot verify the order). I don't think they were originally all identical on HearthStats, so I think HDT messed up when downloading them, and then reuploaded the messed up versions, overwriting the original ones on HearthStats? \nI've emailed those files you asked for. (Sorry that it's so unorganized BTW lol)\n. Maybe. It's unfortunate that we won't be able to test the fix to see if it also fixes this issue, since we won't be able to recreate the state her HearthStats account was in originally. Unless you can think of a way?\nBTW: HDT isn't prompting me to update to 0.9.3 (after restarting it). Should I just give it a little longer?\n. Hm, I've just updated to 0.9.3 and ran a full sync. \nOn 0.9.2 I changed one of my decks and overwrote it as v1.0 (since I've not got any games assigned to it, I didn't want multiple versions of it). At the time I checked and it updated that deck on HearthStats as v1.0 as it should have, not as a new version.\nNow that I've just run the full sync, it's added a second identical v1.0 on HearthStats. Not sure if this is something that's just been introduced in 0.9.3 (can't remember if I did a full sync in 0.9.2 sorry).\nDeck on HearthStats: ~~http://hearthstats.net/decks/giants-mage--29?locale=en~~ [link invalidated after deck deletion]\nIf I do HEARTHSTATS->DELETE SELECTED DECK, and then do another full sync, will it sort this you think?\n. By 'manually delete the other', do you mean delete on HearthStats website? I only have one version on HDT.\n. Delete selected deck you mean? :)\n. I just tested this on another deck. I edited a versionless deck in HDT, and resaved it as v1.0. It automatically updated the deck on HearthStats as v1.0 to correspond to the change (as expected). Then I did a full sync, and it didn't create two v1.0 this time on HearthStats. So that's good.\n. Okay that worked with the Giants Mage deck. \nObviously it invalidated the previous link when the deck got deleted, here's the new one:\nhttp://hearthstats.net/decks/giants-mage--32?locale=en\n. lol :+1: \n. It's the hdt_log.txt file. You can't write to Program Files directories unless the app is run as admin.\n. I think it's considered bad practice to output anything to the executable's own directory, so that would also include EXPORT > SCREENSHOT and EXPORT > SAVE AS XML. In the case of HDT it doesn't matter so much, because there is no installer. It requires that people unzip the program to their Program Files before they'll see this problem.\nBut just for good practice (and future proofing, if you were to ever make an installer), I think outputting the deck screenshots and XML export files somewhere else is a good idea too. Not AppData though because that's supposed to be for config files and such, hidden away from the user. These files are more like documents, so I think EXPORT > SCREENSHOT and EXPORT > SAVE AS XML should present the user with a save file dialog, so the user can choose where he/she wants to save them on a case by case basis.\nEDIT: Had a go at implementing this. See the referenced pull request below.\n. Actually, thinking about it, there might be a problem with the updater too? But if you attempt to run Updater.exe with elevated permissions, that will probably solve it. (Then the user should be presented with a UAC dialog before it updates.)\nEDIT: Had a go at implementing this. See the referenced pull request below.\n. See #694.\n. Ok I've figured out the bug and I believe it should be an easy thing for @Epix37 to fix. I'll leave it to him to do that though because I'm not sure why the offending code is there.\nFor now though there's an easy workaround: Just click DECKS > USE NO DECK in the menus and it should work properly. You'll need to do this again if you close the HDT and reopen it. This is only if you like to play without adding your decks to HDT though. If you play with decks set up, you should select your deck manually in the deck picker, because the auto deck selection is also broken atm (see #677).\n. Yeah I was assuming that too, if it wasn't for p3king in the other thread. Glad I could help :+1:\n. \nHere's how I added it. Was pretty simple, but just so you know for future maintenance.\n. Also changed the 'Save to file' button on the Log tab to use the SaveFileDialog too.\n. Unfortunately means users will have to download the latest version manually in order to even get this :)\n. That's actually a good idea, renaming the exe. Didn't think of doing that.\n. Sounds like it might be related to the 0.9.5 fix.\n@GaelicSmash Did you use the 'SAVE AS NEW (v1.0)' option to create these decks? I tested that out on 0.9.4 and whenever you had a game assigned to one of the decks it would also assign it to the other, so they would appear twice in Overall Games.\n@Epix37 To replicate: Download 0.9.4 and use a fresh config. Import Natural Remedies and save the deck. Edit Natural Remedies and call it 'Natural Remedies 2' and then use SAVE AS NEW (can also change some cards if you want but it doesn't matter). Edit Natural Remedies again and call it 'Natural Remedies 3' and then click SAVE AS NEW again. Now manually create a game assigned to Natural Remedies and it should show up triple in Overall Games, one for each deck.\n. @GaelicSmash How did you delete v1.0 and v1.1 then? I thought you couldn't delete deck versions?\n. Sorry, I'm just trying to understand. You said originally: '... I did have 3 versions of the\nsame deck (original & 1.1,1.2). As soon as I deleted the original & 1.1 ...'\nThat to me implies you deleted 1.0 and 1.1. Now you're saying you deleted 1.1 and 1.2. But I still don't understand how that's possible because as far as I'm aware, there's no function yet to delete a version of a deck, only the whole thing (all 3 versions). Did you delete the whole thing and then recreate one of the versions as a brand new deck?\n. Ok just want to make sure of something. Sorry if you feel like you've already answered this, but are you saying you had your 3 versions of the same deck set up like this?\n\nOr like this? (Where you choose which version you want to play from the dropdown list.)\n\n. Okay thanks, that's helpful. I think this bug has already been fixed then with 0.9.5. It might still affect decks created prior to 0.9.5 though, if they were saved at the time using this button:\n\n. Looks good :)\n. I like the filter by range of ranks idea. It'd be nice to see the win percentages of a deck within certain brackets of opponent's rank.\n. Managed to reproduce this with the config file and I used git bisect to track it down. The bug was introduced in this commit: ab5c45ea6d19\nSomething to do with the new deck picker.\nEDIT: Actually the config file is not needed to reproduce; just need to have no deck selected and then turn off auto deck selection. Then close HDT and reopen it.\n. Ok I think I've figured out why this is happening. We want Overlay.ListViewPlayer.ItemsSource = Game.PlayerDrawn when no deck is selected, but at the bottom of the LoadConfig method in MainWindow_Load.cs, it's forced to Game.PlayerDeck. This method runs after the OverlayWindowconstructor where it's set correctly, so if you first load HDT without a deck selected and then just start playing, you should see this bug.\nhttps://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/blob/ab5c45ea6d19cb58a8ed0ac4c4801ca492b3424a/Hearthstone%20Deck%20Tracker/MainWindow/MainWindow_Load.cs#L670-677\nAlso explains why I needed to close HDT and then reopen it to reproduce the bug, because it's set correctly when you deselect a deck (i.e. when you click on 'USE NO DECK' in the menu). So it would only appear when you next open the program.\n. Thanks @p3king!\n. @Epix37 I don't think that's the appropriate fix. I think it's now always going to assign the games to the latest version, rather than the selected version.\n\n. You can achieve this by holding down shift while clicking on the columns. Click 'VS' column without shift in order to sort by that column first, then hold shift and click 'Result' column, for example.\n. No it seems to be fairly unique to WPF elements. I like it though. Nice feature. Should become standardized imo.\nUsually apps can achieve the same thing by using a stable sorting algorithm, rather than an unstable sort. Unstable sort is usually faster, but stable sort will retain the previous order of any elements that share the same sorting key, so you can sort your columns in reverse order of importance. I.e. if you sort by 'Result' first, then you'd get all the losses above wins as expected. Then you sort by opponent's class, and because the algorithm is stable all the druid losses would still be above druid wins for example. An unstable sort doesn't guarantee that.\nIn this case it turns out to not be necessary to do that anyway because of the multi-select on columns. I looked into changing the sorting algorithm that the control uses to a stable sort, but it looks like it's more effort than it's worth. Very hacky solutions, and given you can already select multiple columns it's not strictly necessary.\n. I've always had this problem too, but I assumed it was a limitation that couldn't be worked around. Nice to know that's not the case. I've just tested it with exporting on a really slow speed (100ms) and it works like that for me, but not with anything faster. I can consistently export without skipping cards on 40ms so I've always left it on that. My hardware is not the greatest though; CPU is pretty old now.\n. Can confirm this works for me now at 40ms. Good job :+1:\n. Yeah I meant to say it also counts Old Murk-Eye towards the dust. It should skip soulbound cards.\n. Not sure whether this same bug happens in other circumstances, like auto deck selection or other cases. That needs to be investigated. I say this because it looked like it was only setting the notes context on the deck picker selection changed event, so I added it to startup as well, but it may also need to be added to other circumstances where the deck selection changes that I didn't look into yet.\n. To reproduce on master, open HDT (with a deck active) and immediately go to EDIT > NOTES and start typing a note. Don't click on anything else. It should crash. Also stats window won't have the title of the active deck like it's supposed to. \nDeckPickerList_OnSelectedDeckChanged isn't called on start for me. It seems that ListViewDecks_OnSelectionChanged is called, but it doesn't raise the OnSelectedDeckChanged event on start because _reselecting is true. Is that the real bug here?\n(The STATS menu button itself sets the deck context to the active deck before it shows you the stats, so I presume that's why it doesn't show 'Overall' stats when you click it (or raise any nullptr problems), but the stats window title or flyout header is still not set correctly on startup to the active deck name because that only happens in DeckPickerList_OnSelectedDeckChanged.)\n. Oooh, hope that pans out @Epix37 :+1: \n. It worked nicely first time I tried it with a druid deck, though I didn't save the deck. Then I deleted the deck in hearthstone and tried a hunter deck but it always just imports 6 cards from the druid deck (2 of each so 12 total).\n. Yeah. Tried closing down hearthstone and reopening and it seems to work again.\nEDIT: Now it's mixing them up, some cards from the druid deck and some from the mage deck I was importing.\n. It's weird, sometimes it works but most of the time I just get those 6 druid cards still. Can't figure out what I'm doing right when it works. Only had it work properly twice I think.\n. Still happens with 0.9.7PRE4. Yeah mostly neutrals, let the game fill the deck out for me.\n. I'll try that in a bit, see if I can figure out what's happening. I'm just going for a run now but I'll come back in about half an hour.\n. 0.9.7PRE5 works a lot better now :)\n. \"On exiting the collection screen all cards get unloaded, including the cards in the book on the left. Those are unloaded last though and can be easily filtered out by manacost.\"\nIf you type some random thing in the search field so that no cards appear in the book, would that help so that only the cards in the actual deck are unloaded when you close the deck screen? Or could you start counting the cards that get unloaded from that point on? Maybe this whole thing could be automated with virtual clicks, like with deck exporting.\nNot taken a deep look at it yet, so my thoughts might be nonsense.\n. That's a shame. The cards aren't unloaded when you actually perform the search then? Just when you exit the screen? I see.\nMaybe you could do Import -> Deck Slot 1-9 submenu. Not sure if the deckslots would be in consistent positions though on all resolutions.\nMy zoolock deck always has a sacrificial pact when it's not in the deck. And a druid deck I have doesn't include Innervate when it does have it. So it's not quite right yet unfortunately.\nDecks and my first pages:\n\n\n. Figured it was probably that. Hope there's a solution.\n. Seems to be working well for me, from a limited test. Still misses innervate like you said, and sometimes it misses random cards (missed an explosive sheep and mad scientist, but then I tried again and it worked that time), but the sacrificial pact doesn't show up anymore :)\n. In fact it misses any card that's on that first druid page.\n. Actually it seems that it never includes cards that are on the class's first page that I don't have a golden version of. If I have a golden version of the card, it won't miss it (whether I put the golden or non-golden one in my deck). This isn't for druid BTW, I think my comment above still applies to all the druid cards, whether I own golden versions or not.\n. Very strange, what I said above only seems to apply from Hunter to Paladin. From Priest onwards it works fine, so even if I don't have a golden version of the card it will pick it up. But with Hunter, Mage, and Paladin, it only picks up those cards on the first page when I own a golden version of them.\n. Hm it's working now, and I think it was failing before because Helper.SettingUpConstructedImporting got stuck on true somehow, even though I wasn't doing the 'setting up' process at the time. Not sure why it was true, but when debugging I noticed that it was and I think that explains why it would only add cards where I had a golden version. Now that I've reset that variable it appears to be working as expected. So all of the above was kind of a non-issue I think. What I don't understand is how it is possible that it was stuck on true though :/\n. I think I've figured out what's causing the issues with Druid.\nI think what happens when you open a Shaman deck, for example, is that it loads the Shaman cards first from the deck, then it loads the Shaman first page in the card collection book. Any cards that have already been loaded into the decklist that are also on the first page of the Shaman book cause the AlreadyInCache message. But it doesn't work the other way around, where it would fire the AlreadyInCache message when the cards being loaded in the decklist match cards that have already been loaded in the book.\nSo for example, with this Shaman:\n\nIf I open up the card collection and then immediately go to the Shaman first page, without opening the deck, I get 1 AlreadyInCache message for the golden Ancestral Healing. Then when I open up the deck, I get 1 AlreadyInCache message for the golden Feral Spirit, but I don't get any AlreadyInCache messages for the Lightning Bolt and Rockbiter Weapon.\nIf, however, I open up the card collection from scratch and then immediately open the Shaman deck, I do get the AlreadyInCache messages for the Lightning Bolt and Rockbiter Weapon, but that's because it must have loaded the deck first and THEN it opens up the first page of the Shaman book, and it's that which is firing the messages.\nSo with Druid, you cannot avoid loading the Druid first page immediately before you load a Druid deck, and so if a Druid deck contains Innervate, or anything from that first page, it doesn't fire the AlreadyInCache message for that card when the Druid deck is loaded. I'm not sure if there's a solution to that :(\n. I also think the statement here needs to be changed to:\nvar containsOtherThanDruid = Game.PossibleConstructedCards.Any(c => c.GetPlayerClass != \"Druid\");\nCard.PlayerClass is null when the card is a neutral, but Card.GetPlayerClass returns 'Netural' if Card.PlayerClass is null. So !string.IsNullOrEmpty(c.PlayerClass) && c.PlayerClass != \"Druid\" returns false when the card is a neutral, which I think is not what you intended.\n. Oh right, I see. My bad. So why the cardCount > 10? Why did you choose 10 I mean? Just a sufficiently large number? I was trying to figure that out earlier. Meant to ask.\nDo you have a golden Abusive Sergeant btw? Just noticed that the golden Feral Spirit I have in that Shaman deck is unloaded last (after Fire Elemental but before Ancestral Healing in the book). EDIT: Scratch that idea. Just tested it with a mage deck and my golden Arcane Intellect wasn't unloaded last. Doesn't even seem to always unload the golden Feral Spirit last, so I guess it's not deterministic.\n. Closing this since it's working now :)\n. Ah right okay thanks.\n. Try closing HearthstoneDeckTracker and deleting the config.xml file it refers to in %AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker, then reopen HDT. It should recreate the file with default settings. It sounds like perhaps the permissions on that file have messed up for some reason.\n. Probably related to #621 and #609. Looks like it's an anti-virus issue.\n. Maybe the AV changed the permissions on the folder, so even if you turn it off the problem remains. Can you go into your AV and see if you can find a reference to HDT and then unblock it or exclude it? It might free up the folder then. Do you use Bitdefender btw?\n. lol oh dear :( \n. That is strange. Does it recreate the folder and then crash the same as before? Not sure what to suggest, maybe @Epix37 will have some idea.\n. What does it look like for you if you right-click on the AppData HearthstoneDeckTracker folder and then go to Properties > Security tab, then click Advanced. Not that this would really help with anything I think, but I'm curious. This is what mine looks like:\n\nIgnore my computer's terrible name :P\n. This is a very useful feature. I've often wanted to see this information myself.\nIs there any way to detect what region the player is playing on (Americas, Asia, or Europe)? Then we could just reset it at the appropriate time for the region. It would also be useful to put that information in the game stats.\nIf we can't detect it, I was thinking that a profile switcher feature would be worth working on. It's a big feature but it would basically just load a separate config.xml, PlayerDecks.xml, DeckStats.xml, etc., depending on the selected profile. It would allow users who share the same computer and windows user, but have different Battle.NET accounts, to switch their HDT profile. It also allows the same user to play on different regions, where they might have different decks, by switching up their HDT profile. And then perhaps you could just have a combobox in the options for each profile to specify what region the profile is for, and use this for determining the reset time.\n. What's the HearthlyGaming log? \nJust had a look with Sysinternals Process Monitor. There's a file in %AppData%/Battle.net called d813f3dc.config on my machine that changes with the region switcher in the battle.net client. \n\"LastSelectedGameRegion\": \"EU\", - this takes the value EU, KR, or US. Under the WTCG game.\n. Ah right. Yeah I think the config item is the way to go :)\nI agree with your thoughts about the profile switcher as well.\n. On my mother's machine, the information is in ebca815c.config and not in d813f3dc.config. Not sure why the difference though.\n. I thought so too but they're the same two filenames that I have. Just that on hers it's in the other file.\nThe same key exists in ebca815c for me, but it's blank and doesn't update:\n\"LastSelectedGameRegion\": \"\"\nEither way it should be easy I think to get the information we need from them. Only trouble would be, I think, if it's not necessarily blank in one of the files, but then it also doesn't update when the region switches. Then we might not be able to figure out which one is accurate. \nMaybe it has something to do with which Battle.net account you're logged in as. Pretty sure I've logged into my mother's Battle.net account before on my machine, and she has logged into mine on hers. So that would make sense. I'll confirm later when my mum isn't playing WoW :+1: \n. %ProgramFiles(x86)%\\Hearthstone\\ConnectLog.txt contains the region information.\nTue Mar 10 22:54:06 2015 [ACCO] AccountListener.OnAccountLevelInfoUpdated account=50822816 currency=GBP accountRegion=2 currentRegion=3 country=GBR\ncurrentRegion can either be 1, 2, or 3 for Americas, Europe, or Asia respectively. I think this is the way to go; it's much easier to deal with.\nAlso looks like the HealthyGaming log only shows the account region information:\n[HealthyGaming] CAIS Active: False,  Accout Country: GBR,  Time: 9.991635,  Played Time: 0,  Rested Time: 0, Session Start Time: 1217480192\nHere I'm on the Asia region but it only shows my account region as Great Britain. I guess that's because I still buy packs on Asia with British Pounds.\n. Okay cool, so I assume the reset times are the same as the daily quests. \nSo that would be midnight in:\nEurope: CET (CEST in daylight savings),\nAmericas: PST (PDT in daylight savings),\nAsia: KST\nAccording to Hearthstone Wiki.\n. No idea either but playing around, I think it could work something like this:\n``` c#\nusing System;\nnamespace TimeZones\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        enum Region\n        {\n            EU,\n            US,\n            ASIA\n        }\n    class Config\n    {\n        public static Config Instance;\n        public DateTime?

I think it'll pick that up automatically.\n. I see how your way works now as well, and I think that would work fine. If it's not the same day as the last reset time, then reset gold progress and update the last reset time to today. Makes sense. I think you might need to use DateTime.UtcNow though, and would need to keep track of 3 seperate 'last reset' dates and gold progresses though I think, for each region.\n. Pretty sure you don't have to do any special checking for daylight savings now, because when you get var tz = TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById(\"Pacific Standard Time\") and do tz.GetUtcOffset(DateTime.UtcNow), it results in -07:00:00 even though PST is supposed to be UTC -8:00. But they're currently observing PDT which IS UTC -7:00.\nSo it looks like it's correct.\n. This seems like the easiest way to get the current date of the server:\nvar date = TimeZoneInfo.ConvertTimeFromUtc(DateTime.UtcNow, timeZone).Date\n. Looks good :)\n. I think you're confusing how the deck versioning works a little, and the problem is that there is no way at present to turn an existing deck into a version of another deck.\nThe way you're supposed to use deck versions is by using the version selector at the top right. So if you have 5 versions of the same deck, there would only be one deck shown in the deck list and 5 versions of that deck available to choose from in the combo box here:\n\nIf I were to edit this deck, I'd have the option of saving my changes as v1.5 (overwriting the latest version), or v1.6, or v2.0. Any of these would still only show one NO POWER HERE deck in the deck list, but if, for example, I'd saved my changes as v1.6, then I would be able to choose that from the version selector.\nWhen you resaved HANDLOCK-mod1 as HANDLOCK, that meant that you ended up with two decks both called HANDLOCK. It basically just renamed HANDLOCK-mod1 as HANDLOCK, but it didn't overwrite the existing deck called HANDLOCK because you are allowed to have two decks with the same name.\nSo now you have two separate decks, both called HANDLOCK, with neither having any versions (i.e. they're both considered separate decks, and both are at v1.0). Then you saved v1.1 of the deck you had just renamed. This created a separate version of that deck, identical to the first version. What I mean is, HearthstoneDeckTracker doesn't know that the two decks both called HANDLOCK are supposed to be versions of the same deck. It thinks they're two separate decks, and one of them now has two versions (v1.0 and v1.1).\nLikewise, when you saved HANDLOCK-mod2 as HANDLOCK v1.1, that again simply renamed HANDLOCK-mod2 to HANDLOCK and created a v1.1 for that renamed deck. That's correct though because, again, HANDLOCK-mod2 is considered a separate deck with no versions, so the next version up is v1.1 (or v2.0).\nUnfortunately though, there is currently no support for consolidating existing decks together, such that they would all appear like my screenshot as multiple versions of one deck. \nIn the next release I believe you'll be able to do it manually though, if you want to take the time. In the next release, you'll be able to move multiple games at once from one deck to another deck, and choose a specific version that you want to assign the games to. So when the next release hits, I believe you could recreate all of your versions off of the original HANDLOCK deck, then move all the games assigned to the 'mod' decks to their appropriate versions.\nTo be more clear, what I mean is the following (only when the next release hits). Rename your modified decks back to HANDLOCK-mod1, HANDLOCK-mod2, etc. (so that it's easier to see which one is which). Then go to your original HANDLOCK and edit the deck. Make the changes that would be required to bring it in line with HANDLOCK-mod1 and then save it as v1.1. Then edit the HANDLOCK deck again and make the changes that would be required to bring it in line with HANDLOCK-mod2, and save the deck as v1.2. Keep doing this until you've recreated all of the versions that you have. You should now be able to select which version you want from the combobox on HANDLOCK, just like my screenshot, but the problem is with the stats. The games that were played on HANDLOCK-mod1 are still assigned to HANDLOCK-mod1.\nBut then you can go into your game stats, and move all games assigned to HANDLOCK-mod1 to HANDLOCK (v1.1), all games assigned to HANDLOCK-mod2 to HANDLOCK (v1.2), etc. The next release will support moving multiple games at the same time, and moving the games to a specific version of a deck, so this step will have to wait until then. But I believe when you've done that for all the decks, you can then delete HANDLOCK-mod1, HANDLOCK-mod2, etc.\nHope this all makes sense. There's a lot in my post and it's complicated to explain so I apologize. \n. 8016d6b maintains the current deck selection when you are editing tags. Previously it would clear the active selection and reselect the active deck, mostly as a side effect of clearing the entire list of displayed decks and refilling it when updating. This meant you couldn't make two or more changes to tags on multiple decks without having to reselect all the decks manually after each change.\nLet me know if this is okay to merge to master.\n. :+1: Also fixed problem when selecting archived decks with unarchived decks. Now the archive button is visible when there is at least one unarchived deck in the current selection. Likewise, unarchive button is visible when there is at least one archived deck in the current selection. So if you select archived decks with unarchived decks, both menu items will be visible.\n. I've changed it so that it restores the original window position on edit panel close, or if the application is shut down when the edit panel is open. This isn't done if the user has moved the window in the meantime, however.\nThis way, if users like to keep their HDT on the right side of the screen in a consistent position, hopefully they won't have to move it around ever.\n. Now also shifts left when you keep the window on the right side of the left screen, or the right side of any screen, not just the rightmost screen. It's also smart about it though, so that if the right side of the original window was slightly overlapping onto the right screen, it will still shift left, but if the window was mostly all the way onto the right screen it will not. This is to ensure that, if the user likes to keep HDT on the left side of their right screen, it won't shift left if they inadvertently positioned the window a pixel or two overlapping onto the left screen. It only shifts left if the window was mostly on the left screen to begin with.\nIt also fully aligns the window to the right side of the screen if our moving it would leave more than 50px between the right side of the window and the right of the screen. This way, if the window was originally closer to the middle of the screen, it will fill the available space rather than leaving a big gap. But if the gap was originally small, the small gap will be maintained.\nI believe this will also work as expected for all screens if the user has three screens or more, but I've only tested it with my dual monitor setup.\n. Now that I see it, I see that this makes a lot of sense. Nice addition. :+1: \n. https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/blob/38a9a1108836012d433b8edadea295115a5ed215/Hearthstone%20Deck%20Tracker/GameEventHandler.cs#L344\nThink it might be this I added. I guess it should say if(deck != null && deck.Archived)\n. Hm that's true :)\n. I just tried adding a null deck to DeckList.Instance.Decks and then calling DeckList.Save(). The null deck isn't saved to PlayerDecks.xml and so it's not there when you reload either.\n. Did you perhaps download the souce code zip rather than the binary on the release page?\n. :+1: \n. Think this fixes it. 022df72 was searching the key space rather than the value space of the HeroIdDict.\n. Just noticed the 3 mana Warrior spell Charge has this issue with Kor'kron Elite, since Kor'kron Elite has the word Charge in its card text and they both share the same artist: Alex Horley Orlandelli.\n. I've noticed the same thing after the hearthstone patch. Really jerky every time I play a card etc. Not on an SSD though. They must have done something that affects the performance of the logging output. It's not a supported feature so I doubt Blizzard will do anything about it.\n. I did a few test games vs AI and recorded them @ 60fps so I can try to visually compare animation jerkiness. I tried every combination of ConsolePrinting, FilePrinting, or NoPrinting, with and without Windows Defender exclusions. I didn't have HDT running for any of the tests.\nHere are the results (best to watch them at 60fps):\nConsolePrinting NoExclusions 1\nConsolePrinting NoExclusions 2\nConsolePrinting Exclusions 1\nConsolePrinting Exclusions 2\nFilePrinting NoExclusions 1\nFilePrinting NoExclusions 2\nFilePrinting Exclusions\nNoPrinting NoExclusions\nNoPrinting Exclusions\nIt seems that FilePrinting rather than ConsolePrinting definitely helps for me. The best should of course be NoPrinting, but FilePrinting Exclusions and even FilePrinting NoExclusions feel identical to that.\nI think the Windows Defender exclusions did help too, but not by much. I thought that the exclusions didn't help at all before now, because I do still have noticable lag with ConsolePrinting Exclusions compared with NoPrinting. But when comparing the ConsolePrinting Exclusions videos with the ConsolePrinting NoExclusions videos, I do think it is better? Hard to tell though. I'm second guessing myself after watching them again. ConsolePrinting NoExclusions 1 seemed a bit worse than ConsolePrinting NoExclusions 2, so perhaps it's anomalous (for example, when I coined out the Fencing Coach on turn 2 it was particularly bad).\nHere are the Windows Defender exclusions I used. Not sure if only one of these helps or multiple:\n\nWindows 10 Pro\nIntel Core i5 760\nGTX 660 Ti\n12GB RAM\nNo SSD\n. Wow cool, I'll have a go with this later. I mean to empty my quest log tonight so I'll have to play at least 8 games or so. I'll keep an eye out for anything that doesn't seem right. :+1:\n. Sorry I haven't had a chance to test this yet. I'm excited to try it though.\n. Played eight games and everything went well up to that point, but on the ninth game it stopped tracking after the opening cards were shown and before I chose which cards to mulligan.\nThe game didn't save in the stats when it was finished (probably because I have 'discard games with zero turns' on), though a replay was saved with just the those same opening cards shown, and then it ends. The replay also didn't pick up my name (i.e. the replay filename is: (Priest) vs k\u00e4ften(Mage) 1721-090915.hdtreplay rather than dvide(Priest) vs k\u00e4ften(Mage) 1721-090915.hdtreplay).\nInterestingly the date created on the replay file itself is when the game actually ended, approx. 6 minutes later. So it didn't just save the replay file after the opening cards, thinking the game was already over.\nHere's the video of the game (not that it shows much):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyrJXApxKv4\nI'll send you the hdtreplay file by email and my log files from today's games.\nJust noticed as well that the card counts are wrong whenever I'm going second. The count of the number of cards left in the deck is consistently 1 more than it should be. Looking at my recordings of the first eight games, it's always the case when I go second. Whenever I go first, it seems to be correct. It looks like the enemy card counts are fine when they go first or second.\nThe next game I tried also didn't track, before I closed the game. I lost the overlay altogether, but it came back when I turned off 'hide in menu' during the game. Not that it was tracking anything at that point; just showing the deck I had active with all cards grayed out.\n. I restarted the game without restarting HDT and now the game I'm in seems to be tracking again.\n. Cool. So you think that this was caused by incorrect handling of non-ascii characters in my opponent's name? Actually the next game I played, where I said it also didn't track, my opponent had Cyrillic characters as well. So not sure if it just stopped working until I restarted the game or because they both just happened to have non-ascii characters. I imagine it's the former though.\nEDIT: And yeah, is the gold progress tracking supposed to be fixed? Because that wasn't working for me last night either. Just wondering in case it was fixed then broken again with the new namespace log readers.\n. @Epix37 That's good Epix, nice work :+1: everything else worked fine and no stuttering.\n. It's up to you. I'd be hesitant as well with this kind of change. I'd be surprised if there's not some obscure race condition type problems or something. I want to play some more tonight as I still have some Rogue quests to do, so I intend to test it a little more then.\n. Okay sounds good. This will help a lot of people I think :)\n. Same thing with Spellslinger I've noticed :)\n. You could also use 'attack:7' to search for Stalagg now too, and 'attack:4' for Feugen.\n. Pre-release seems to work fine for me on english client.\n.

    "WaxPaper": "I was just about to post this as a feature request (I already had it typed out)... Is this what you tried to do here, and it didn't work? Here was my request:\n\nIf you remember some of the early AHK and macro-based deck management scripts, some of them had the option to clear your current deck, which was really handy (and saves a little wear-and-tear on your mouse, over time). ;)\nWould it be possible to add a little button that gives this option? You could instruct the user to position their cursor on the first card in their deck and press a hotkey, or if the program is able to position the cursor itself, that would work too... Then it's just a simple matter of sending 30 mouse-clicks to the client and poof, the deck is gone.\nI know it's not THAT big of a deal for us to click our decks 30 times to clear them, but I also keep my decks named by class, which I never change. So people like me have to manually clear them each time. How bout it? Pretty please? Maybe even just a power-user option that could be flipped on via an .ini config line, with just hotkey support so you don't have to mess with any UI stuff?\nThanks!\n\nEDIT: Since I don't know much about coding, I wasn't able to figure out what his commit was supposed to do exactly, but I THINK I inferred it from the description... It looks like the feature I'm requesting is different, so I'm gonna go ahead and make a new post for it.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks man! ;)\n. Same here... I actually thought this was the reason for one of the last hotfixes, but now that I'm re-reading through the release notes I see that this issue wasn't specifically mentioned.\nWould a snippet of the log help you diagnose the issue at all?\n. Same here, Calioe... Anyone know of a workaround that helps until the next update gets released? It's not a problem with a parameter in the config file, for example, is it?\nEpix37, have you ever considered providing access to \"nightly\" (or however often you update) builds of the program? I know that we could always download the source here and compile it ourselves, but I personally don't have any programming knowledge and I don't have any software tools that would compile either... If it's a pretty easy thing to do, that's another story; I'll do some Googling and figure out how...\nBut otherwise, it would be cool to have access to development builds with the newest updates baked-in, if you have the time and willingness to compile some of your more substantial milestone updates, before they're ready for release...\n. @Epix37 I don't think I've ever had the \"include obtained cards\" option enabled, although when the bug first started happening it the latest release, I allowed the app to create a new, fresh ini config file just in case mine was corrupted or something... That didn't fix the problem, although I can't be sure I didn't have that option enabled previously.\nRegardless if I did, it wasn't working back then, so I'm not sure... Are you saying that enabling this option should fix the auto-selection bug? I'll try it out and get back to you here. I'll also give that newer version you linked a try; the pre-release 0.9.6 one...\nThanks...\n. @Epix37 So I tried enabling that option and as you eluded to about it being a different issue, it didn't help. I downloaded that new pre-release and tried using it (although I just let it use my current config instead of making a new one) and the bug seems to persist...\nhttp://pastebin.com/vyMAvh8i\nHere's a pastebin of the log; I tried to make it easier for you by snipping the relevant part. This log begins right as I'm starting a Casual game, which was followed by an Arena game (obviously using a different deck). One thing I noticed in the log is that the auto-selector did seem to find the correct deck even though it wasn't previously selected (the Paladin deck, after playing an Arena as Mage and having that selected), but for some reason the client is still recognizing it as incorrect.\nFrom there on, it's the usual bug, with the auto-deck selection menu being presented, although it won't \"initialize\" on a deck even if you manually select it. It'll keep looping back to the \"incorrect deck\" error until you either choose the \"no deck\" option or close the dialog menu, which will force the client to use no deck and turn off auto-detection.\nWhat else would help you debug this issue? Would log level 1 (instead of 0, like this one) help? Would a video screengrab of the problem happening help in any way? Thanks man...\n. @Epix37 I was describing what WILL happen if you do that, instead of just closing it the first time, which is what I did in that log... Actually I can't remember if I closed the dialog via the \"X\" in the corner or hit the \"Use No Deck\" button in that specific log; if it makes a difference, lemme know.\nAlso, here's another log at the \"1\" level, just in case it helps. Again, the log begins before I enter a casual game, with a different deck selected than the one I'm using: http://pastebin.com/T8qxYtCg\nAnd here's the Config and PlayerDecks files you asked for, in a zip: http://www15.zippyshare.com/v/WWv595I1/file.html\n. @Epix37  Could this be related to the \"Advanced Window Search\" option? The fact that you were able to reproduce it using my configs made me wonder about my settings, so I started looking around in there to see if there were some things I could disable...\nIt's not enough to make a call either way yet, although after I disabled that option a little while ago, I haven't seen the bug for the past few games... Don't know if it's coincidence or not, yet...\nEDIT: Nevermind, bug just happened....\n. @Epix37 Pre2 seems to be working so far, after the first couple games now... I'll let you know if that changes and the bug reemerges. Fingers crossed, though! Thanks for all your work, man...\n. Ditto! It's pretty tough to manipulate as-is; maybe something similar to the Windows shell would work, like CTRL-clicking selects multiple games? Even the shift-click to select multiple list items in a series would be cool, too...\n. Before ya close this issue, I wanted to let ya know that I've also been experiencing this for months. It used to eventually import the deck successfully from Hearthhead despite that error prompt he screenshotted, but the past month or so it just hangs forever and the program has to be killed to restart.\nCan I help you debug this with some log tracking or anything?\n. Before ya close this issue, I wanted to let ya know that I've also been experiencing this for months. It used to eventually import the deck successfully from Hearthhead despite that error prompt he screenshotted, but the past month or so it just hangs forever and the program has to be killed to restart.\nCan I help you debug this with some log tracking or anything?\n. I think what this guy's talking about it is when you export a decklist, from one that you created or modified (after exporting from a website, for example) into the Hearthstone client, the automatic export \"clicker\" adds the cards into the client in the order that you added them to the decklist.\nSo imagine I import a deck from a website, and then I remove a card I don't have -- like the 8-mana Alexandra, for example -- and replace it with a 2-mana Loot Hoarder. When I export that deck list into the game, the Loot Hoarder will be added last, after higher-costing cards.\nThat's just an example to help you figure out what this guy is describing. The end result is still the same, of course... That's why you probably don't get more people bringing it up as an issue, because it's probably just more of an OCD thing for some people. The majority of us don't really care what order the cards are added into the decklist, knowwhatImean? ;)\n. I haven't started using the archive function yet much, no... But it sounds like I should, so I will! Here's a link to the crash reports zipped in a file, by the way:\nhttp://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=00867679523341638155\nBut don't worry too much about it on my account, unless you wanna try to debug the issue in general, for stability and whatnot... I've been using the same install (well, the same portable folder location linked to my appdata folder after you included that ability) since the beginning, so it could be possible something's been corrupted along the way. I need to get around to cleaning up my deck database and maybe even wiping the appdata location to start fresh, and just import the decks and stats or whatever.\nThanks for the continued developments!\n. Sounds like the problem, yep. I'm downloading the test version now but I gotta run so I won't be able to actually test it out until later. If you wanna keep the Issues section tidy, maybe go ahead and close this one if I don't reply back within 24 hours; otherwise I'll hit you back up and try to confirm...\nThe reason I can't check it by just opening up one game is because based on the past behavior of the bug, I'm assuming I'd have to play through a few games to make sure it's not happening anymore. Unless there's a way to force-duplicate it, I suppose... But yeah thanks for your work!\n. That update seemed to have fixed it... Only played about 5 games, but it didn't happen when I played or when I tried to force it using the method you explained. Thanks again!\n. ",

It happened to me just a little before I posted this issue.  I generally leave HDT running all the time.  I think the general order of things happening based on the times on the release page is:\n1. HDT was already open since I leave it running, I started out on 0.6.0\n2. You released 0.6.1\n3. I started HS\n4. It checked for an update and found it?  It didn't pop up the HDT window with the update overlay so didn't notice it asking to update.\n5. I go do some other stuff for a while.\n6. You released 0.6.2\n7. I clicked to look at HDT and I see the update overlay\nClicking download at this point would get me 0.6.1 instead of 0.6.2, wouldn't it?  Briefly looking at the code, once ShowNewUpdateMessage is called it's already decided on which version to download and it looks like the updater doesn't check and just gets whichever specific version it's told to.\n. I also have this problem, though setting prioritize golden cards does make the exporting work.  If I set the speed to 150ms, then I can see it just clicks the normal card twice and doesn't try to click the golden card when I only have one normal and one golden card in my collection.\nI personally only put golden cards in if I have no choice, so I end up manually fixing the deck and leaving the prioritize option off.\n.

I'm also not a lawyer, but am a developer.  Not distributing it in source isn't what matters.\nIf you believe the FSF's take on linking, if your program is linked at all, that's no good.  This includes dynamic loading of libraries.  There's no \"deep\" use or \"light\" use or anything else.  The separation they want would require using pipes or sockets between the two pieces of code.  This is from GPLv2 section 2 and the FSF's FAQ about the GPL.\nHowever, the reason you can use Windows system DLLs is there is an explicit \"system library\" exception in the GPL.  This is in GPLv2 section 3.\nThe intent of the GPL is if you have a GPL application, you can get the source for the entire thing and not in a way that's more restrictive than the GPL provides.  The MS-PL requirement of using MS-PL is such a restriction beyond the GPL.\n. That's one reason why some projects require contributors to assign the copyright of contributions to the original author or an organization controlling the project.

go back into menu after it's over\nThe tracker will now have generated a \"Logs\" folder in it's folder, please\nsend me the file(s) it contains per email: epikz37@gmail.com\nAfter that you can

    "mvordeme": "The same thing actually happened to me a few minutes ago in Tavern Brawl. I am using version 0.10.7.\n. It is working really great. Thanks to whoever implemented it. :+1:\n. Another small thing: It seems that whenever I have zero stars, the recorded rank is the rank below (which is technically correct, of course). But then, maybe my opponent's rank was recorded, instead.\n. Could it be that this is partially working already? I had a few funny games where HDT started flashing halfway through the game and they were recorded twice. When I double-click them, only a list of drawn and played cards is displayed and not the replay viewer.\n. Yet another example: A Webspinner gave me Malorne, and when it died, I got the warning and Malorne was not added to the deck.\n. Today, the Malorne thing happened again, and I got the idea that maybe culinko's and my reports are actually related to #1046. It seems that the tracker can't deal with duplicate occurrences of legendary minions.\n. Then why does it work in other cases? Spare parts don't seem to be a problem for me, for example. Webspinner and Unstable Portal are usually working, too. Even Malorne is not a problem as long as he doesn't die and gets added to the deck a second time. I have only seen this kind of problem with legendary minions, lately.\n. It was just an idea after re-reading #1046. Sneed's Old Shredder is part of the deck and it brought up the warning when caught in a Freezing Trap. I don't remember having any trouble with Freezing Trap on other occasions.\n. Something similar happened to me yesterday. I wasn't sure it was caused by the Experimenter, but it seems my guess was right. After my opponent played the Experimenter, HDT constantly showed one more card in the opponent's hand than Hearthstone itself. Maybe HDT can't handle the fact that a certain minion is drawn but an entirely different minion is added to the hand.\n. Something similar happened to me yesterday.

Maybe HDT can't handle the fact that a certain minion is drawn but an entirely different minion is added to the hand.\n. Actually, this kind of thing is puzzling me. When I spectate a game, the tracker tries to match the deck and fails. Then I have to use no deck which denies me the option to save either of the used decks in the spectated game. But that is the only meaningful thing to do after a spectated game. The same goes for tavern brawls and class challenges with prepared decks.\nIt would be nice to be able to reconstruct a prepared deck from multiple plays of the same tavern brawl or class challenge. The interface could work like this:\nWhen I play for the first time, I have the option to create a new deck from the current game.

My impression is that it doesn't work any longer after I imported a new deck. When I restart the tracker, auto selection usually works again. I must admit that I didn't test that assumption thoroughly, though.\n. I wasn't too sure that maybe auto-selection works, only the deck to select is not unique. (It might be a good idea to present the player with a choice of eligible decks if that is the case.) But then after playing an arena, I played ranked with the only Shaman deck I have. I even watched HDT selecting the proper deck, but it didn't mark it active. It seems there is something confused about selecting and activating a deck. (If I remember correctly, there is another issue about deck version selection where active and selected decks are mixed up, but I can't seem to find it right now.)\n.

Is that intended behaviour? I'd assume that archived decks are not taken into account when switching, or else auto-detect would become entirely unusable over time.\n. I just checked the replay. Apart from archived decks, there is only one deck which matches the drawn cards. Could it be that the archived deck was only considered because it had been played more recently than the other one?\n. So far, things are looking good. Is the Tracker supposed to switch between constructed and arena? That's something which didn't work yesterday. A constructed deck was selected and I started an arena run. I got a pop-up window with the option to select no deck or something else I can't remember. The arena deck wasn't found, and I had to switch manually.\n. Hm, this time it worked.\n. This is awesome. Thank you.\n. ... and, of course, it would be nice to have a new deck type \"Tavern Brawl\". But I must say that importing Tavern Brawl decks from Hearthstone works almost flawlessly, already. Kudos :+1: \n. I have a different issue when exporting to Tavern Brawl (although I must say that it did work fine once):  When I try to export a deck to Tavern Brawl, the first thing HDT does is activate the 0 mana cost filter, and it subsequently does not find a single card. If I activate the filter myself (hoping that HDT will deactivate it), nothing changes.\n. This is funny. Last night, exporting to TB definitely didn't work, and I had to compose the deck manually. Tonight, I first checked my resolution because it sometimes changes to custom when I move the window around the screen, but it was still set to 1600 x 900 (windowed). Then I imported a constructed deck and after that a brawl deck without any problems. I even saw the mouse selecting the 0 mana filter, but it must have selected other filters later on.\n. Is it any use to post in this issue after it has been closed? I think I have found a clue and a work-around solution for this problem:\nThe problem has nothing to do with the resolution or windowed display, neither has it anything to do with the export settings. The only thing that counts is whether you did open a conversation window in the current session of Hearthstone or not. If you did, the export will not work. It will select the 0 Mana filter when trying to deselect it and not find a single card in the deck. If this happens, close Hearthstone and open it again. Now the export will work. At the beginning, this will cause Hearthstone to display the message Use the friends menu to start a conversation with a friend.\n. Going to, thanks.\n. I ran a couple of tests, and it seems that this problem has disappeared. Closed.\n. The same just happened to me in ranked play. I am using the latest version of HDT, and I don't remember it happening before.\nJust in case, here is the log: http://pastebin.com/BaZqT810\n. The mage happened to pull it out of an Unstable Portal. That could be part of the problem.\n. Same here. HDT even selects a deck and then complains if there are cards missing. Seems connected to  #1265 and may have to do with the changes in logging with HS version 3.0.0.\n. Yikes! Now a spectated game was even recorded (no rank, unknown human player, 0 turns, mode NONE).\n. Never happened to me before. Sometimes I wish games would be recorded, e.g. in TGT Brawl to be able to reconstruct the decks, but they aren't. This was the first time.\n. confirmed\n. I have seen similar problems, too, mainly because the tracker didn't recognize the end of a game and kept on drawing from the same deck. It happens consistently whenever a new quest pops up at the end of a game, but not only then.\n. That's due to the delay caused by all the animations going on in Hearthstone. HDT displays the cards as soon as they are drawn.\n. Looks like a duplicate of  #922.\n. This happens whenever there is no active deck. In order to enable automatic deck detection, there must be an active deck (left-click \"USE\"). If no deck is active, HDT will use no deck (Menu > Main > Use No Deck).\n. ... on the other hand, it might be those three mysterious games with a result of \"None\" in the statistics.\n. ",
    "MechaLynx": "Pretty sure I've seen this happen myself a few times and I wasn't even using HDT back in August 2014. Not a biggie, but it seems to still be there.\n. Is region even recorded or present in the logs?\n. Then I guess the only obstacle is overcoming the sheer terror of refactoring the internal indexing and the UI to accommodate this kind of search. I would love this stuff to be in there (as well as exportable reports based on composite searches), but I feel it's quite a major undertaking due to how the internals are built (I assume) and may break existing stats.\n. .NET already has an sql-like query syntax for lists or something doesn't it? Perhaps if the properties of games are all collected into a single massive monolithic object, list or list of pointers (or have an interface that pretends they exist in that format) and there's some search ui like the \"Additional Filters\" on hearthpwn (and other sites) to allow for composite searches. \nIn an ideal world, one would read all the games into an sqlite in-memory database and use proper sql mapped to a dynamic ui like the aforementioned one to create composite queries. A bit overkill, but definitely a once-and-for-all solution.\n. I assume you where using v0.10.16? How long has this been happening for?\nAlso, try using v0.10.15 and see if it still happens.\n. Wouldn't the Resource Monitor from the Task Manager on Win7/Vista show whether there is a lot of activity on the log file? I don't have this problem so I can't test it, but it might provide some insight and clear this up.\n. I didn't try to reproduce it (should have, sorry), so I'll try to do so and get back to you. In the meantime, here's a pastebin of config.xml, this is the deck I tried to import and as far as the conditions under which I imported it are concerned:\n- I already had a modified version of that deck in Hearthstone\n- Hearthstone was open with the deck visible in Tavern Brawl mode\n- I was copying the deck manually from the game to HDT until I remembered that I keep the original decks imported for reference and I must have been more than 20-25/30 in copying the deck over when I decided to do an import, at which point what I describe in the OP happened.\nedit - btw, since config.xml doesn't store this information, my OS is Win7 Pro SP1, .NET is 4.5.2 and the same since installation.\nedit2 - Here's a paste of htd_log.txt in case it's of some use. Curiously, I clearly had 3 imports of this deck after I triggered the filters again, but the log only shows 2 imports. Might be nothing, just noting it.\nP.S.: I empathize with the horror of massive pastes in posts, it's shocking every time :P\n. Might be better to post this on /r/hearthstone and/or hearthpwn. It would get more visibility there and, as you state yourself, this is not the appropriate place to post this.\n. Just confirming that generated Fireballs from Antonidas, Spare Parts and win/loss tracking appears to work perfectly fine.\n. Recycle has apparently always been problematic, so not really a new issue.\n. Nope, neither unfortunately. We did just test Recycle though, so that's done.\n. How consistent is this? Does it happen every single time?\n. Try turning Aero off and see if it keeps lagging like that.\n. Try turning Aero off and see if it keeps lagging like that.\n. I've tested this using the latest release 0.10.11 and it works as it should. As Epix said, make sure it's in the deck you've made in HDT (if it was made with HDT) and try 'Use no deck' to see if they show up then.\n. Are you using the latest release (v0.10.11)? I'm asking because there where changes with how this mechanic is handled recently.\nAlso, while I'm not the developer, the log file seems to indicate that the card was stolen from you, implying you had Malorne in your own deck. Is this correct?\n. It appears that the logging has changed since 3.0.0 and the changes are still being figured out. It may just be that reading the log file produces a false conclusion.\nI think the log file you posted is adequate along with the clarification of what happened. I don't think it's necessary (but then again, I don't really know for sure) but if you do want to post your deck, assuming you have imported it into HDT, you can just upload PlayerDecks.xml from %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\HearthstoneDeckTracker. Again, this is likely to be a side-effect of the recent changes and I don't think the deck is necessary, but that's how to provide more information.\nOne more detail though: Are you certain that HDT is showing you the correct deck? It's possible that it detected and used a similar deck with Malorne for you, even though your current deck doesn't have it. Very unlikely, but just making sure.\n. The XML snippet should be good enough. Thanks for the clarifications.\nI'm not the developer, but I'm sure Epix will appreciate the appreciation :P\n. The one common element I notice is that in both cases, the log counts the Malorne card on the opponent's deck as stolen on a previous turn.\n. This is a known problem and not related to HDT:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/3hhhxb/psa_casual_doesnt_give_win_gold_anymore/\nThe reason it's stuck is because HDT expects an update from the log files, but since Hearthstone isn't registering these changes anymore and apparently not logging them either, HDT has no reason to ever update the counter.\nThis will fix itself once Blizzard fixes this problem in Hearthstone.\n. This is super-sweet but I have a couple of worries to voice: The icons blend in with the game too much, or at least it seems like it. The indicators we have right now stand out clearly and so do the numbers in your version, but the icons might be too hard to distinguish. It might be really bad, considering the variety of card backs we have available.\nAlso, I have no idea, just by looking, what the two symbols on the rightmost cards are - I can deduce they're returned and spell-created cards, but at least the spell icon should be more clear. There is a sort of contradiction, from a UX standpoint, in using letters for some indicators and icons for others. You already solve the problem of having the turn marker replaced with the letter by combining them properly, but I think either icons or letters should be picked and stuck to.\nAll this said, I believe this should go into the main branch, if only for the combination of turn indicators and type markers on the cards. The issues I'm talking about can be fixed later and shouldn't be the source of any problems for users, apart from the possible problems I outline above.\n\nOn the more constructive side, here's what I think the icons should be for more clarity, unless letters are chosen (in which case they should all have clearly contrasting colors from their backgrounds and the cards):\n- keep should have no icon (what it is should be clear from contrast with mulligan)\n- mulligan should have an icon closer to arrow_switch from the silk icon set although not necessarily identical of course\n- returned should be something like the recycling symbol\n- spell can work through contrast with returned if left with the present icon.\n- coin is 100% clear, no changes needed\nI'll try to put up a canvas-based tester to allow some comparisons on icon contrast based on the card back so that it can be clearer that the icons don't unintentionally blend in with colors from the card backs. Alternatively of course, they could be placed about 90 degrees clockwise to their current position to allow more distance from the card back and have a slight border (like the letters and coin icons have) to contrast with the board background (although in that part, it never changes).\n. Is there any pattern to the kinds of games not recorded?\nThere is no definite maximum and certainly no maximum defined by the number of files or filesystem restrictions. Make sure that you have the types of games you want recorded selected from options -> tracker -> stats.\n. What are your selected options under options -> tracker -> general?\n. Try removing the \"Flash Hearthstone on turn start\" option and see if the behavior persists.\n. Just in case and for the sake of completeness, have you tried switching with HDT not running, not even minimized or anything like that?\n. Ok, I assume you're using v0.10.13 now, which version did you upgrade to the latest from? In other words, which was the last version you used that didn't have this problem?\n. That should do, just need to know the range of commits to check for this. I can't replicate the behavior because I don't have Windows 10, but someone else might and this way it's easier to know where to look for whatever broke this.\n. See if anything here fixes it.\n. Nice. Please close this issue unless you still have the problem. You can re-open it later if the problem re-appears and you can't find a solution from the FAQ. I would do it myself but this isn't my repository.\n. Not sure if this is relevant. I don't use Hearthstats at all, never synced or anything, but I still got the duplicates report:\n\nI told HDT to delete them and I didn't get the popup again, so all seems to be fine. I don't care if they where mis-matches, but this may be relevant if only sync-related duplicates where the target. Only 1 of them seems to be in the last 2 months, so it may be unrelated to Hearthstone lag, or I get it more often than others.\n. Can you post a pastebin of your log file (from options -> tracker -> logging -> save to file) hopefully right after it happens the next time? There are issues with some of the new cards but it's hard to test because there hasn't been enough time to collect them.\n. I can confirm this, Win7 Pro x64, using v0.11.15. I hadn't observed this happening before, even though I often use both windows open and overlapping in order to compare if I've transferred a deck properly to HDT.\nThe behavior is exactly as described by the OP. I did test with fullscreen and it happens there as well.\n. Doesn't fixing this restore issue #1321? I don't see why this can't be a conditional behind a setting, preset depending on the detected OS version. It's fine if a restart is required. Isn't critical in either case, it can wait.\n. There have been a lot of updates during the last few days because of the TGT release and various issues that appeared because of the changes. This isn't a problem, however, just to be sure, check the version number when there's an update to see if it's a new version, because if it isn't, it could be a bug or other problem.\nIf you want to make sure what's been going on isn't a bug, you can check the release history to see if it feels like the updates have been happening more frequently than the history shows. If you have HDT starting with windows it's likely that it's been checking for updates every time it starts, hence why it seems to update every time you reboot (then again, I'm not the developer, but that's how I understand it working).\n. This should be possible to do as an enhancement.\nHowever, if you, or anyone else who has the same need, have to check the last update to the deck, you can see it in PlayerDecks.xml which is in %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\HearthstoneDeckTracker\\ and you can get there through options -> tracker -> settings -> 'open appdata folder`. Once you open it, you can see each deck's last update at the bottom of the info for the deck. You're looking for:\n<LastEdited>2015-02-19T00:47:36.3044632+02:00</LastEdited>\nbut I don't know what counts as an update to give you specifics, however it should work as a workaround until (and if) this lands on a release.\n. Have you tried lowering the export speed from options -> tracker -> exporting -> speed?\n. I just got a crash playing Warlock in Brawl as well, was transformed to Jaraxxus and the crash happened once the match finished and I won:\nCrash report 2782015-187\nlog file\n. This is known and isn't a problem on HDT's side - Hearthstone's logging has changed and apparently it doesn't send information on this anymore or the format has changed. In any case, it doesn't seem like it can be fixed on this side, it's up to Blizz.\n. It's ok, it's a bit hard to check. You might want to close this issue however, since the problem is tracked with bug #1278 anyway.\n. Malorne is known to be problematic.\nProof isn't needed, but the log file could be useful. Here are the instructions on how to do that, if you're up to it.\n. Cards are referenced only using their id, which for Malorne is GVG_035.\nOn line 1088, your Malorne is killed and HDT gets confused about the deck. This is similar to issue #957 and Malorne has other ways of confusing HDT, like in issue #1290.\nCurrently the state of Hearthstone logging is unclear, since there are also issues with tracking gold rewards from wins (#1278) and this seems to be the case with Malorne, due to its mechanics. Things will have to settle down a bit before this stuff can be fixed I guess.\n.

Yeah, maybe you miss a turn or two, but it should know when the match started (and all the other info like opponent class, coin and such) and then just wait for the result. It's still better than a missing match. I was able to scramble something from the incomplete replay file, the only \"mystery\" for me was the number of turns. Does the log store the turn number related to start of the match or does it count over again from the moment you reconnected into the game?\nAlso on unrelated note, when I tried to link the incomplete replays to the games and running them by the tracker, it threw like 100 exceptions, so maybe you might want to display a warning if the replay file is damaged.

So you could choose a custom season number (1-x, we are currently in 25th season). First ranked season started in April 2014.\n. On the contrary, I am looking at my past seasons very often. To see how much I played in the past, how good was my deck against a certain class (e.g. how Rogue did against Paladin before and how it does now - my winrate dropped over time). Also when was the best meta for Control Warrior, Freeze Mage, etc. Using the start and end date takes too much time currently. The seasons filter is actually one of the most important filters for me and I would like it to be included now, because I doubt there will be any new filters anytime soon.\n.

I was looking at the issues with \"next update\" tag and found this one, was this fixed already?\n. This annoying bug should be fixed in the latest pre-release (0.13.4)!\n.

I was always surprised that you can see different stats depending on if you have deck selected or not when clicking on \"Stats\" button on the top.\nFew observations (inconsistencies) about the current behavior:\nGames tab: \n- \"Games\" selection is present only in overall tab\n- \"Apply tag filters\" and \"Player\" selection is present only in overall tab\n- \"Add new game\" button is present only in deck tab (so if the proposed behavior is accepted you need to add \"deck name\" and \"version\" as new fields into the game creation popup)\nStats tab:\n- \"Games\" selection is present only in overall tab\n- \"Apply tag filters\" and \"Show as percent\" is present only in overall tab (in the table itself)\n- tables in \"Deck\" display both % and numbers, table in overall only displays numbers (that's why there is filter) - this is kinda inconsistent, maybe you should be able to choose between \"percent\" and \"both\" (default display being the numbers only)\nOne other observation to note: The \"filtering\" layout is kinda inconsistent, because the checkmarks and selection buttons are in multiple places (perhaps all the buttons could be added into the filter area instead of being just above the games/stats itself? Those are filters too, you know.\nI also injected subtle request that I already asked for in one of the other tickets (sorry, couldn't help myself, i love arenas :P). Finally, here are the two sketches:\n\n\nIf you have no deck selected, the \"Overview deck: Wins - Losses\" table could be hidden or something like that.\n.

I still kinda like this viewer more :) As I was saying, it helps me fill out the opponent deck type quicker, because you know most of the cards by their color (e.g. Explosive Trap is red). So I was gonna use the old viewer until some automated way of detecting opponent's deck type will be available. Perhaps a button like \"Show Opp. Deck\" next to the \"Import Opp. Deck\" could be a viable option? The layout could look like the old replay viewer, but it would just display the cards grouped like a normal deck. This way I wouldn't need to use the old replay viewer at all ;) Anyway, should I create another ticket for that feature request?\n. That would be awesome, yeah! I just hope it won't upset people that they need to make an extra click to import the opp. deck :)\n. That's neat, I like it!\n. I couldn't reproduce this (windowed mode), the first letter was entered correctly.\n. Actually, I've found out that sometimes the two numbers are identical, sometimes they differ by 1, not sure why. 5/9 of my matches have same numbers, 4/9 of my matches have different numbers, sometimes the first one is bigger, sometimes the first one is smaller.\nOne example from my game: \n[Bob] legend rank 1989\n\"23 lines of text\"\n[Bob] legend rank 1988\nI guess you would need to test with someone who has legend rank to confirm what rank did the game show after the match to find out if the first or the second one is the correct number.\n. Can confirm it now, I've seen it on stream. It showed 400 right after the victory screen, but showed 399 when in deck selection. And it showed 400 again when playing a new game.\nInteresting, that means the menu legend rank is desynchronized with the ingame legend rank. Not sure which one is the \"correct\" one, then.\n. Thanks for the quick fix, much appreciated!\n. Yeah, I guess ever since I started using deck tracker I've become spoiled with all these crazy features and I want more :P You are a wizard though, implementing stuff at a speed of light!\n. I can't think of an example where the minion going from PLAY to GRAVEYARD wouldn't work.\n. Polymorph moves the original minion to SETASIDE.\n. Changed the first point to only include arena rewards. Changed second point to the ability to create arena deck instead of arena entity. Third and fourth points unchanged.\n. I wonder, can Arena Helper plugin automatically save the hero selection (the 3 hero choices with the one you've chosen) and all of the choices for the 30 cards that you've been offered?\n. I don't want to make another issue, so I report it here. I found out that grove tender has also images \"gift of mana\" and \"gift of card\" and anodized robo cub has images \"attack mode\" and \"tank mode\" (which are slightly different btw.). If those cards have images for all of their \"choose one\" choices, should the other druid cards have 3 images as well? (e.g. Cenarius or Keeper of the Grove).\n. I really doubt HS deck tracker caused any issues in this case. If you exit deck tracker and your problems still remain, it's not a fault of deck tracker, since the only thing it does is read the Hearthstone log. If you want to remove the deck tracker, just delete the unzipped folder and the app data folder (C:\\Users\\\"username\"\\AppData\\Roaming\\HearthstoneDeckTracker).\nAs for the link you provided, it's absolutely irrelevant, because quoting the guy: \" I scanned my system with Avast (founding tons of viruses, which got deleted/quatantined), I did even cleared my registry + used anti malware programs, which also found keysloggers and malicious files.\" This just blows my mind.\n. I'm sure he didn't mean aggression in general, just that if you really seek help, your posts shouldn't be passive aggressive.\n\"I wouldn't be surprised if his game stopped working because of this program moreso than the keyloggers and viruses.\"\nAre you really suggesting that viruses and keyloggers are less harmul than hs deck tracker? I really wanted to help you with the issues you've having, but unfortunately, you're crazy.\n. \"And the fact that he scanned and cleaned his computer and still has problems? Seems sketchy.\"\nEven if you remove malware and viruses, many times the damage they've done is unrecoverable (broken registry, missing/corrupted dll files, missing exe files, all sorts of stuff).\n\"And yes, the fact that you can get viruses and keyloggers (that get fixed by a simple scan & clean) that will do nothing to hearthstone\"\nYou have no idea how viruses work, I advise you read some pages on wikipedia. As I said earlier, even if you clean your system, it still can be very much corrupted.\nThe only thing this tracker does is read the hearthstone log. The tracker is open source, you can view all of its code here. As I told you in my previous post, if problems persist even if you close the tracker, the problem is not caused by tracker.\n. Glad that Epix37 managed to help you with the issue. I was wrong about tracker not being the culprit, I didn't know hearthstone has not enabled logging by default. My apologies.\n. Do you want me to paste the log? I still have the tracker open.\n. Log: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=nbdrabY3\nReplay (match starts approx 20:20): http://kopasite.net/up/f4v08gf66a7276i/culinko(Paladin)%20vs%20Gammoth(Mage)%202028-110415.hdtreplay\nThe example card in this match is grove tender (soot spewer was the 2nd portal): \n\n. Also, related to #718.\n. So, I reviewed some of my replays against Tempo Mages lately and it seems that other class cards (Shielded Minibot or Axe Flinger) are no longer included in the list, but neutral cards (Target Dummy, Oasis Snapjaw) and mage cards (Soot Spewer) are. Spare parts are not in the list, but things from Duplicate and Echo of Medivh are. Not sure about other \"out of the deck\" cards. Also, seems like it was fixed retroactively as well, because I can't see the Grove Tender from my initial post. Example screenshot (echo+duplicate):\n\n. When you click on stats > games, do you have selected Overall? Because if you have deck selected and the matches are not assigned to a deck, there will be no results.\n. 1) I agree, it could be next to \"Note filter\". Many times I search for players manually just to see if I already played against them, this would be great if I can just search for their name.\n2) You can already filter the opponent class, but not your class. It can be handy too, yeah.\n. Damn, I was in the Deck tab and not in Overall, whoops.\n. I'm not sure if it's related, but observed this behavior also with wrath. My opponent played wrath twice, both to draw a card and it was still showing 1 on the overlay. I didn't miss anything, double checked it in opp. deck and in the replay. It was the last match in this log.\nLog: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=sw7CvuP3\nReplay: http://kopasite.net/up/5ki4bw586h17k6n/culinko(Warrior)%20vs%20Azga(Druid)%200225-300415.hdtreplay\n. Observed this again with power word shield. But then I tabbed out to another program, then came back to Hearthstone and the overlay showed correctly two. I hope this helps you more.\nedit: I just tested it now with Naxx boss Faerlina. She played both rampages, but it only showed one. After I alt+tabbed and came back to Hearthstone, this line appeared in the log: [19:59:35] UpdateOverlay: Refreshed overlay topmost status (it appears every time I alt+tab, naturally).\n. I found out that this bug happens with \"Collection Tracker\" plugin. Multiple random images are missing every time. Is there anything I could do to help you find out what's causing this issue?\n. Closing in favor of #757.\n. @Epix37 Was this added with b001aba? And it it wasn't, could you make the button to not be exclusive to editing a deck? Thanks!\n. I don't think there is a need for a new tab. All of the \"planned\" decks are constructed decks anyway, so maybe just group them on the bottom of the list with some header or something like that. They could be tagged with new \"planned\" quick tag, too.\nAlso, some tickets about user's collection: #699, #602, #696 and #337.\n. Same as #299.\n. So, I found out that Hearthstone log shows you even the turn numbers (I reconnected at \"TAG_CHANGE Entity=GameEntity tag=TURN value=7\" and the game ended on value=17). Because the tracker knows what turn value to assign if match ends with the value 17 (I believe it's 8, because full 8 turns took play), you should be able to recollect all of the needed info for a full game entry.\nSo, the tracker just needs to join the starting info that took place before disconnect and reconnect (start time, coin) with the ending info (end time, result, conceded, turns, + other info like rank). I don't know when it gets nicknames, region, mode, deck and other stuff, but all should be there in the log (even in HDT log itself).\nThe replay and game files would still be incomplete/corrupted or missing (they could get auto-deleted or prefixed with something, I honestly don't care), but if we can get the whole game recorded for our stats, it would be a really great thing! (Currently I do all of this manually every time a disconnect happens to me).\n. This is the bug related to jousting I think.\n. It searches for \"Burly Rockjaw Trogg Chris Rahn\":\n\nBut the artist should be Aleksi Briclot:\n\n. Are you sure? There is some arena tracker that claims otherwise. \"Arena Tracker reads the Hearthstone log to keep track of your arena games and rewards.\"\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ArenaTracker/comments/2tyhmd/arena_tracker/\nedit: looking at the code, there should be [Rachelle] lines containing BoosterPackRewardData, CardRewardData, GoldRewardData and ArcaneDustRewardData.\n. So, would it be possible to store that info somewhere? Basically what I would like to have is the first thing from #875. I know I can screenshot the rewards screen manually or write the info down, but I'm pretty sure having the tracker do it automatically would be so much better. If there is no other important stuff in the log than the rewards and hero selection, you can close this issue I guess. I just wanted to find a way to not lose the valuable info from the log in case more stuff gets implemented later on.\n. Okay, so I enabled all txt logging and found out these things are logged:\n- Arena (drafting state, complete deck state, reward state, no draft state). [Ben] handles those. Timestamps are switched because I finished one run and then captured the drafting phase of next run after that. Unfortunately, I don't think you can trace the drafting picks or the complete deck anywhere.\nD 18:57:38.6403044 DraftManager.OnBegin - Got new draft deck with ID: 323195012\nD 18:57:38.6413045 SetDraftMode - DRAFTING\nD 19:03:25.1234860 SetDraftMode - ACTIVE_DRAFT_DECK (you get this line every time you click on \"Arena\" menu entry or after every arena match if you have an active arena deck)\nD 18:55:37.1950862 SetDraftMode - IN_REWARDS\nD 18:57:33.4161660 SetDraftMode - NO_ACTIVE_DRAFT\n- Arena hero pick.

I added all stuff to #875, I don't think I need this issue open anymore, now that I know what is and what isn't logged.\n. Yeah, see https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/935#issuecomment-98879408\n. https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/releases\nClick the first link in Downloads section.\n. Is this still an issue with the newest version?\n. Great work, thanks!\n. It would be great if you could somehow record drafts with OCR and I would definitely try to draft with HearthArena if it will display all the values automatically (even though I never tried HearthArena before, I was always too lazy to input all the things manually).\n. Great news! Also, I'm just wondering, would it be theoretically possible to track card pack openings with this method?\n. For common card picks, you can track only picked cards if you create an arena deck yourself. Because the draft is not in the log, you would need to add some OCR (#946). I requested some arena stats myself, too (n.3 in #875).\n. Also, sorting by winrate could be useful, too.\n. Oh, I'm blind, my fault. Tbh the \"Tracker\" menu is kinda unintuitive, I was expecting to find the sorting and filters elsewhere (initially I was trying to right click the search button, lol). Not sure if it's just me or someone else feels the same. But I can get used to it, though.\n. Related: #446.\n. Duplicate of #596.\n. #313\n. Another example: As Warlock, I stole Malorne with Sylvanas, then suicided him and the tracker displays the warning now.\n. It's not about duplicate legendary minions, it's about Malorne not being originally in the deck.\n. Even Malorne is not a problem as long as he doesn't die and gets added to the deck - This is the important part. He gets added to the deck as a 31st card. Spare parts and unstable portal add cards to your hand, not to your deck. The cards that add stuff to your deck (Gang Up, Iron Juggernaut) have been fixed already, but seems like Malorne hasn't been. As for spare parts, I didn't have any problems with them as far as i can tell, @NightKev did. But maybe all of this is related somehow, I'm sure @Epix37 will take a look at this once he comes back.\n. Alright, I tried to reproduce the bug with drawing double legendaries from Chromaggus in current version, there were no errors. The issue with Iron Juggernaut is fixed as well.\nSo the only issue here seems to be Malorne created from outside of the deck (Webspinner, Unstable Portal).\n. Is this still an issue?\n. Pretty sure these cards got milled, because of the boss hero power.\n. Pretty sure these cards got milled, because of the boss hero power.\n. Currently, there is no filter for opponent names. But somebody already suggested some new filters including yours in #692 :)\n. Currently, there is no filter for opponent names. But somebody already suggested some new filters including yours in #692 :)\n. So the possible solution that came to mind: Mark the stolen secrets green (same as other out-of-deck cards). Same goes if you happen to steal the secret back. This way you will see who played how many secrets from the deck if you ignore all the green ones. What do you think?\n. Great. Yeah, the joust will be a tough one.\nSorry, I'm just browsing through my reported issues and since you happen to have a bit time and you already fixed some of the issues, I'm using this as an opportunity to get more stuff fixed :P\n. The comparison could look like when you edit a deck and there is the diff. between versions, it looks very good.\n. I think a double click or right click -> use deck would work for me. The used deck could be in bold font and selected deck could have the border around it (like in 2nd picture). But I'm not the typical basic user, so maybe there should be a way to distinguish it a little bit more.\nAlso, if you are in a spectator mode (even when automatic deck picker is off) and you are switching up decks, the tracker is really unresponsive and it could even freeze. Sometimes I wanted to look at my decks during a spectator game, but it's not really pleasant experience. It makes sense now, because you said it reloads the log. So this would fix this issue as well.\n. I like the class selection at the top and the active deck info on the bottom. However, I like everything else the way it was before (stats on the right, note icons, colored decks). I hope there will be some options to choose the way we like it. Also I hope there will be multiple options to switch decks like right click -> use deck or double click on a deck.\n. Yeah, I know, I'm always reluctant to UI changes :P \nThe only reason why I don't like the deck stats on the left is because it's more difficult to see the numbers overshadowed by the huge deck names in between them.\nThe new note style and position is very hidden imho. Just compare it with the old look and you can quickly identify the 6 decks that have notes: http://i.imgur.com/uXO1f3W.png. It would definitely take more time with the new look.\nAlso I'm not sure about the multiple \"use\" buttons. Maybe show the \"use\" button only when you have that deck selected? I really don't know about this one.\n. The tags look really good, nice work there!\nCurrently, I write only missing cards and arena rewards into the notes for now and want to clear them later if I get the missing cards and/or if full arena rewards are implemented, that would allow me to see which decks still have notes and which don't and the small \"N\" is really not so visible next to the deck name. If it was positioned on the right, it would be visible more, but that would be weird next to the \"use\" button. Maybe a small note icon instead of a text?\n. This looks much better.\nI would still prefer an option to hide the class icons on the left and have the decks colored like before (it gives me more space without the icons and imho white background is very bright).\nAlso what about having the stats like before (framed and in 2 lines)? It looked more consistent and \"presenting\" that way.\nI was also thinking about another note icon, more colorful one. But even this one is more visible like the black \"N\" before.\nNice work so far!\nedit: Actually, now I realized that decks are aligned to the left and not centered like before. So I just like to request an option setting called \"Use old layout\" to save you work. It would still have the new functionality of separated select and use (with double click or right click -> use). There just needs to be a border around the selected deck. The only thing I'd change is the class icons, I like them more at the top than on the left. I'm sorry to let you down, I just like the current layout a lot and don't want my user experience to become a nuisance.\n. Fair enough. Actually, I really like this one :) Just a few nitpicks about this legacy layout:\nWhat do you think about the background under All/Arena/Constructed and the class picker being the old one (dark gray)? I think it fits the overall theme better.\nAnd what about tags (font & border) being black instead of gray, would that suck? Also, what about highlighting the \"ACTIVE\" text too, change the text color to black and/or bold font to be more visible.\nThis is all that come to mind. Thank you so much for providing this option, much appreciated!\nedit: Or did you change all of the dark gray backgrounds to white? I'd prefer that this layout would keep all the dark gray backgrounds that it once used to have, it feels really \"comfortable\".\n. Well, the tags look a bit weird, so definitely the gray is better. For the USE buttons, i thought only the active button will be black, rest stays gray.\nAs for the background thingy, I still like the old dark gray backgrounds, while using the Light base theme :/\n. Updated to v0.10.5.\nUsing legacy layout with Base Light theme and want to request a couple of things I'm still uncomfortable with:\n- Old font type/size on the deck names. The font is too big.\n- Old class icons in Games & Statistics. While I like the icons on decks, I still prefer the \"face\" icons on games and stats.\n- Old gray background under deck buttons.\n- Old gray headers. The gray feels more gentle and the transition from deck picker into stats is easier. Also helps a lot at night.\nDon't take this as a stubborn reaction from me, I just want to use Deck Tracker and be comfortable with it like I was before. I don't want it to become like the \"Arena Pack where you love Arena, but you're sick of the GvG packs\" just because of UI redesign for better functionality. I really appreciate your work on this program, it's the most developed tracker for HS that ever existed.\nAlso, couple of ideas to the new UI, I talked about some of them before:\n- Class name/Archived text on hover over class icons in deck picker.\n- Double click makes the deck active instead of opening the edit window.\n- Add right click-> use deck.\n. I know that you closed this ticket, but I think valid discussion could still be held. I reconsidered the old icons in stats, I'm actually starting to like the new ones. About the gray background, it's not really a ground-breaking issue and we can figure out that later. Though some UI parts are grey and some white and it just doesn't feel right. About the double click, I don't think it's redundant because of the use button, I would actually expect the double click to activate the deck (not open the edit window), now that we have this behavior of deck activating. At least an option for it would be great.\nHowever, I do think the text on the deck names is too big and I realized that the class icons are too big as well. I have made a picture of how the things could look like with smaller icons (same size as in the header), copied old font and moved the tags a little closer (maybe too close) to the use button. Because the icons would be a bit smaller, the button could be a few pixels thinner again. If the icons are too small, they could be slightly bigger than the ones from the header. My paint skills suck though, but I hope the pictures will show you what I have in mind.\nCurrent legacy layout:\n\nProposed change:\n\nThese two were inspired by GiggliG. I moved the notes and tags to the right. I'm not sure if this is the way to go, but showing it here to get more feedback on this.\n\nOnly notes on the right, vertically centered:\n\nI know that most of the time I have Deck Tracker in the background and just see the overlay, but nothing beats good user experience :)\n. Is this still an issue ever since the logging changed from log_output.txt to .log files?\n. #783 \n. Is this still an issue with the newest version?\n. Couldn't reproduce in 0.15.6.\n. Some animations are already included in the newest beta :)\n. I can add/remove tags without any problems with both quick set tag and edit tags (if by labels you mean tags).\nIf you are importing the Arena decks from the game, it won't give any tags to the decks in the next tracker version when you uncheck \"tag decks on import\". This one got fixed already.\n. Yeah, the 2nd issue will be fixed in new version (#968).\n. Yeah, if you pick any of the previous versions and you want to save it after editing, it lists the 1.4 as \n\"current\". It should list your version you picked as current with every other version too.\n. Does this still happen?\n. Also, I found that if you use a deck, Adventure games are not saved (there is no Adventure detection, so their mode is \"None\") and they are cleared on restart.\n. This still happens in the newest test version. Played one game with checked Practice recording (working as intended) and then unchecked recording for Practice, restarted both HDT and Hearthstone (just in case) and then the second match was still tracked with game mode \"None\".\n\n. Actually, I also have recording \"Other\" checked. Let me try to reproduce one more time without it.\n. I unchecked it, restarted both HS and HDT and it still happens. I am playing with no deck and the only checked game modes are Ranked, Casual and Arena. Right after I concede vs AI, I go to the stats, then click on ranked filter and back to All (to refresh the stats). The Practice game is still there (as None).\n. This happened again vs an adventure boss (Skelesaurus Hex). The match wasn't removed even after HDT restart. Using version 0.13.7. All the relevant logs here: http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=05187478452066627704\n\n. What do you mean by time independent? For example, currently, I can compare my Arena winrate for 2014, 2015 and 2016 and see if I improved over time.\n. I know this is a minor issue, but I noticed that you have more time recently, so maybe you could look at this. The only decks not sorted correctly are the decks without matches.\n. You da best!\n. Yeah, actually. Could it be possible to have the old behavior on Arena sorting? I just realized I am using sorting by \"Last Played\" and every time I create a new Arena deck, it gets added to the bottom. I think when I created this issue, I was thinking only about the constructed, hence the title. But then I completely forgot about it. This would help me a ton. Sorry for inconvenience.\n. Well, sometimes I just draft the deck and don't play any matches. But now that I think about it, I can edit all the decks from the oldest to newest and sort by \"Last Edited\". This would solve this problem.\n. Instead of changing  to 539214, the tracker added new Decks with new DeckIDs at the end of the DeckStats.xml. I am asking if I manually remove the empty decks at the end of the file and replace the  with 539214, if it will break something.\n. Haven't tried anything yet, just found out that bce5813f-a624-48c8-b06a-868b9728cf86 is the \"Main ID (current v1.3)\" and ce5bc079-34fe-479b-b995-bc2c25648570 that got created recently is the ID of v1.0. The priest deck is the only deck that has just one version, so that's why it didn't create anything new for that deck. In DeckStats.xml, the matches are grouped under the current (newest) Id, so that's why it created a new Deck there. Is it correct, that the HearthStatsDeckId is bound to v1.0 of the deck?\n. #1025. You don't really need to open more tickets for this issue.\n. Related to #1294.\n. Related to #1294.\n. I just tried to reproduce this specific issue with my friend and everything was working correctly.\n. I removed my previous post and investigated more:\n- I had Tempo Mage activated but played as Freeze Mage, only the warning was displayed that the cards don't match the deck.\n- I had Combo Druid activated but played as Freeze Mage, only Freeze Mage option appeared (I have 2 Mage decks).\n- I had Combo Druid activated but played as Handlock, nothing happened (I have 2 Warlock decks).\n- Also the first time I think I had Combo Priest active, but played as Druid (I have only 1 deck), the options displayed were Combo Druid and the newest Druid arena deck. But can't reproduce it again.\nI'm sending you an e-mail with the required data now.\n.

Combo Druid deactivated and deselected, but switched to 1.1.\nThis does not happen when selecting the desired deck before activating it.\n. @Epix37 Could you reopen this, please? Thanks.\n. Great, thanks!\n. Does this issue still happen?\n. #692 is talking about some new filters.\n. They haven't reduced the timer since beta. Turn timer is 75 seconds + slush time.\nAlso, there is already #1007 covering this issue :)\n. I believe there are 2 similar issues. See my last post in #1133.\n. Unfortunately, there is nothing you can do to fix it, because Deck Tracker needs the logging enabled. I was just pointing out about 2 different issues people are having. One is that once you close Deck Tracker, game is running smoothly (your issue) and the other one is that even if you close Deck Tracker, the game is still choppy and you need to disable logging as well to fix it.\n. Is this still an issue with the new arena importing method?\n. #1097.\n. But this sounds like a different problem, because his FPS return to normal once he closes Deck Tracker. So he still has logging enabled, which causes the FPS drops for other people.\n. Are you still experiencing this issue?\n. Just activate another deck or click Main->Use no deck.\n. It's intentional. You can highlight it if you check the setting in Options/Overlay/Opponent/Highlight discarded from deck.\n. Does this still happen?\n. Same as #425.\n. I think it's similar to #897. I observed this with only 2 of the same card. The Tracker didn't update the count unless you tabbed-out and go back into the Tracker (maybe opponent playing a new card would update it too, like in your case). Disregard the title, at first I thought my issue is related to secrets, but it's not. \n. Check the setting in Options->Overlay->Player->Highlight cards in hand.\n. Yeah, most likely the Antivirus issue.\nOn a related note, my HDTUpdate.exe couldn't update during the update process (I saw a warning in the HDT log after the update was done). The file is the same size, but just wanted you to know it happened.\n. Do you mean \"CreatedByVersion\"? If I change this, it will only tell me that the update was succesful.\n. Alright, tried to reproduce it again, but didn't happen this time. So probably GvG mechs fixed it in the meantime :P\n. Yeah, I'm the one \"responsible\" for this. I agree that having newly created decks at the top is good, but I just found it weird that if you play some matches with other decks, the decks with no matches would be sorted randomly in the middle if you sort by Last Played. As you can see in the other issue, I already regretted it for the Arena (I resorted to using the Last Modified because of that). Sorry!\n. @andburn If you're using no deck, games from all modes are still recorded as None and the matches will stay there until you restart the tracker. There's ticket for that (#1005), although I didn't test other modes than Practice/Spectate, I believe it happens with every mode. Doesn't happen if you use a deck.\n. If any of the players conceded.\n. All of the games are still recorded if you use no deck (#1005).\n. Is this still an issue?\n. Any news?\n. Does this still happen with the new arena importing method?\n. Is this same as #496?\n. Nice little hacks you got there, thanks :)\n. Does this still happen in the current version?\n. The second part is planned (#2224).\nCan you elaborate more on the Effigy report? And does it still happen?\n. This still happens to me every time I create a new deck or a deck version. Running on the newest 0.13.17.\n\n\n. Do you have \"Pop up Hearthstone on turn start\" enabled?\n. Could you check if your issue got fixed as well? I remember @Epix37 corrected the score calculation for when the game ended in a draw in 0.13.8, so it could potentially be this too.\n. Is this still an issue with 0.14.0?\n. I'm not sure if there is a way to determine that your opponent has disconnected other than reducing TIMEOUT value which indicates that your opponent didn't press the end turn button. There are also situations, where your opponent disconnected, but then managed to reconnect back to the game. Also I don't really think disconnects should be treated as conceded games, rather there could be some other indicator to show that your opponent disconnected from the game and never came back.\n. These two lines will get added when your opponent concedes:\nTAG_CHANGE Entity=YourOpponent tag=PLAYSTATE value=QUIT\nTAG_CHANGE Entity=YourOpponent tag=PLAYSTATE value=LOSING\nDetermining the disconnect by a life total wouldn't be a good idea, either. For example if you use Sacrificial Pact on Jaraxxus, you don't lower the opponent's hero below 0 health at all. Also, sometimes your opponent disconnects and then you kill him in 2 turns before \"Your opponent left\" message kicks in. When I'm looking at one of my logs where my opponent disconnected for 1 or 2 turns, the game ID seems to go to SETASIDE zone, but that could be the same case with not hitting the end turn button.\n.

If your opponent disconnects and reconnects to the game, the game is recorded normally. But if you're talking about you disconnecting and then reconnecting (or restarting the client in the middle of the game), the game would not be recorded (I haven't tested it in the newest version, though). The tickets for that: #299 (closed) and #922.\n. If your opponent disconnects and reconnects to the game, the game is recorded normally.

Already fixed with https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/7f027988072f637f89b360e479841566c9fdc93e, you have to wait for the new release, though.\n.

I'd love to see this for my Dragon Priest :)\n. I'd love to see this for my Dragon Priest :)\n. The option has been added into Tracker -> Settings -> Show news bar.\n. I can still confirm this in the newest pre-release (0.13.4). Also, the values only update for the deck currently in use (not updating for the selected deck as well).\n. Related: #953\n. Similar: #708.\n. Closing in favor of #446.\n. I created #847 for this issue.\n. Great news! This issue should be fixed in the next update.\n. I this still an issue?\n. Same as #1431, probably has to do something with Gold Tracking.\n. I'd still like to see mulligan notes included in the HDT, as suggested in the first post. But I agree that the latest suggestions would be better suited for a plugin, because that would be too complicated.\n. But then this ticket is about 2 (or even 3) different things. I suggest creating new tickets for the recent suggestions and leave this one for simple Mulligan notes, as suggested in the initial post. I can then move the posts over there and clean this ticket up.\n. Just a wild guess: isn't this happening because there are some characters (\u4e0b\u5348) in the time format?\n. Incorrect rank is not related to the rest of the games being tracked as Casual, it's related to a couple of other factors that make different assets being unloaded: friendlist opened at some point, opponent's rank, ranking up/down (see the discussion in #775).\n. This used to happen before (rarely), but I don't think I've seen it in a long time. Can someone confirm that this is fixed?\n. Same as #890, happens with other cards, not just Unstable Portal.\n. Does this still happen?\n. Yeah, they have changed misdirection in 3.1. Now it triggers every time there is 1 or more minions, doesn't matter if they have stealth or not. Blizzard made it easier for you to implement ;)\n. I think if you play effigy before the deathrattle minion, the secret triggers before the minion's deathrattle. If you play it after the minion, the minion's deathrattle will trigger first and effigy won't trigger. I might be wrong, though.\n. Are you still experiencing those crashes?\n. Maybe some kind of AM/PM issue?\n. See #1500.\n. \"The replay also uses a different visual format than the usual one\"\nThis means the replay file was not created and what you see is the \"old replay viewer\" which takes the cards from the xml file of the game. Did you notice some of the affected games to have 0 minute duration or saved game mode as \"None\"?\n. It would be cool to display the info somewhere, but I don't think this is the right place. Maybe in the deck picker or somewhere at the bottom, like hearthstone tracker does (though only total played time: https://gocorral.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/hearthstone-tracker-arenas.png)\n. Does this still happen to you?\n. Does this still happen to you?\n. This is not an issue with Deck Tracker. You simply disconnected from the game servers.\n. This is not an issue with Deck Tracker. You simply disconnected from the game servers.\n. Closing in favor of #1765.\n. The issue with Freezing Trap and Snake Trap not graying out automatically should already be fixed. Are you still experiencing the crash when manually graying out secrets?\n. I'll try to test your example with a friend later today and then I report back.\n. Does this still happen?\n. #1007 covers the 1st point.\n. Yeah, reproduced it 2/2 so far.\n. This has been fixed since, I can confirm that it no longer happens.\n. Do you have correct deck selected when going into queue for a match?\n. Does this still happen?\n. Does this still happen with the newest version?\n. Glad to hear that you could make it work!\n. Does this still happen?\n. Rank detection was improved and works 100% for me. This means deck tracker will know your highest and ending ranks now. Also, EndOfGame.log contains stuff that is logged every time you rank up, so this could also be used if it proves to be reliable.\n. Is https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/1005#issuecomment-167444142 related?\n. My path contains spaces as well, but I was able to start HDT with Windows successfully. Is this still an issue for you?\n. Can't reproduce anymore in 0.13.14 (Tank Up!, DIE, INSECT!), probably because of https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/a72bf45453df5a4db51a42112ea74e37a71be345.\n. Does this still happen?\n. This happened to me as well (didn't happen before at all). The first 2 matches were correctly marked as ranked.

Is this still an issue with the newest version?\n. @MarineKingAizen Your games were detected as Casual (#1852, #1889) and you have saving Casual games off. You should turn on saving games in Casual mode until this bug gets fixed. If you had selected saving Casual games and it still didn't record, then I can't help you with that.\n. Is this still an issue in the newest version?\n. Closing for now, let me know if this is still an issue and I will reopen it.\n. Does this still happen in the newest version?\n. Yes, it does: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/f4dd1aed4d4dba2cb3cc6c7fbcde5f320d71b9cd\nI just tested it now. If you have Reno in hand and his effect is active, he has a highlight, but it's barely visible, because the card is darkened (because it's in your hand). I am using the setting that highlights cards in my hand and not using the setting for colored rarity borders.\n@Epix37 could you change it so that if you have the Reno setting checked, the border highlight won't be darkened like the rest of the card in the overlay?\n. Related: #578 (losing streak indicator).\n. For me, there's a difference between automating stuff before queuing into an actual game and automating stuff inside of a game. So I wouldn't want this to be implemented either. But you are correct, there is some automation already.\n. \"NetDeckClipbardCheck: System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException (0x800401D0): OpenClipboard Failed (Exception from HRESULT: 0x800401D0 (CLIPBRD_E_CANT_OPEN))\"\nThis would suggest that a NetDeck plugin might have to do something with this crash.\n@n4ru you might want to take a look at this.\n. Reproduced the issue in 0.15.6, only happens if HDT is minimized in tray and after it happens, the HDT window is not interactible.\n\n. I just tested this with Innkeeper and Avenge didn't grey out after I attacked with my minion into his minion (he had 3 minions). The avenge still remains highlighted.\n\n[16:28:29] OpponentSecrets: Set secret to zero: Noble Sacrifice(1)\n[16:28:29] OpponentSecrets: Set secret to zero: Snake Trap(1)\n[16:28:29] OpponentSecrets: Set secret to zero: Freezing Trap(1)\n[16:28:30] Opponent PlayToGraveyard: id=91, cardId=CS2_101t, cardName=Silver Hand Recruit, turn=12, mark=Created, created=true\n[16:28:30] OpponentSecrets: Set secret to zero: Duplicate(1)\n[16:28:30] OpponentSecrets: Set secret to zero: Redemption(1)\n[16:28:30] OpponentSecrets: Set secret to zero: Effigy(1)\n[16:28:30] OpponentSecrets: Set secret to zero: Avenge(1)\n\nEdit: It seems like after you make another action (e.g. Hero Power), the Avenge is correctly greyed out.\n. Probably one of the hunter traps has a similar bug as Avenge (#2038). Not sure which one, though.\n. This improvement is really nice!\nI'm wondering, how often do people switch Auto deck selection on and off? I personally don't use it and I could totally see just a setting for it somewhere in the options. Not a big deal, though. Also, what do you think about the button for Use no deck on the very right instead of the very left?\n. Yeah, you got a point about the no deck button in options.\nWhat do you think about letters like \"A\" for autoselect, with a tooltip? Or maybe just AUTO and CLEAR?\n. Can you upload your DeckStats.xml (you can find it in %AppData%/Roaming/HearthstoneDeckTracker/) and tell me which decks are affected?\n.

See #1010.\n. See #1010.\n. Collection Tracker is working correctly for me, the plugin is not dead by any means. There have been some problems with the recent hdt update for some people with windows 10, but I'm sure these will be resolved in the near future. You should stop trying to enforce the Innkeeper's memory reading method into hdt.\n. A couple of skins appeared in the newest beta :)\n. > I was playing Paladin and it definitely grayed out the secret Sacred Trial after I summoned a Silver Hand Knight to make my 4th minion.\n\nThe Silver Hand Knight (Hero Power) was not played (from my hand, i.e.,) so it should not gray out the secret.\n\nAre you talking about Silver Hand Recruit? I just tested it vs Innkeeper and this didn't happen either with regular or upgraded hero power (with Justicar) when summoning recruits into 3 or 4 minions on my side of the board. The Sacred Trial was not grayed out in any of the cases.\n. The option you're looking for is already there :) Options > Overlay > Opponent > Highlight discarded from deck.\n. It's #1553.\n.

You can find them in (%AppData%/Roaming/HearthstoneDeckTracker/). As a workaround for fixing the issue, you can copy your old PlayerDecks.xml from the Backups directory.\n. Were you able to resolve the issue with your backups?\n. I'd love this feature. Either automatically showing the overlay, or a button called \"Show Opp. Deck\".\n. I think this is a dupe of #757.\n. Entomb on a full board destroying the targeted minion was a bug and it has been fixed since.\n. Dupe of #690, it's even your own issue :P\n. Dupe of #967.\n.

More info in #2430.\n. Duplicate of #2439. This will probably be implemented only as #868, though.\n. @andburn I love it! Amazing work! I agree with everything Epix said. Rank and W/L don't belong to the screenshot. Checking for only specific 'high-level' deck tags (Aggro/Face, Midrange, Control, Combo, Mill, Fatigue, Ramp, Tempo) and stuff like Brawl (or even Arena) would make the most sense, because I wouldn't want the decks having \"Favorite\" or \"Missing Cards\" tags exported :P\n. Already fixed with 59820c5, new version just hasn't been released yet.\n. See https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/FAQ#ranked-games-are-recorded-as-casual.\n.

The last interaction in your previous report was Sylvanas and then Brawl, with 2 secrets up from the Opponent's Yogg that has been played the turn before that. Possible Traps: Dart Trap, Snake Trap, Duplicate, Effigy, Ice Block, Spellbender, Avenge, Redemption, Sacred Trial and Competitive Spirit. However, I have no idea why the tracker stopped after the Brawl, but it's likely that it was related to one of the opponent's secret triggering and then Sylvanas dying.\nYour last report shows Harrison Jones destroying your opponent's Doomhammer and drawing you 6 cards as the last action. I experienced a similar thing with my opponent destroying my Blood Fury (Jaraxxus weapon) with Harrison as well. The overlay stopped working after that, same with HDT log.

Reminds me of #446, but that one takes the data from your past matches, rather than global data of other players.. Yeah I posted a part of the log, but later realized that it was only triggered by me rerolling a quest (it showed an old and a new quest in Achievements.log). Other quests were not displayed there at all, that's why I later removed my comment. Also Ben.log mentions how many active quests you have and updates every time you open the quest window.\nIt was a combination of me being busy/lost interest in the game that kept me away from HS.

Yes, it is possible to use the old replay viewer, however you should know it hasn't been maintained for a few months. \nEnable advanced settings -> Tracker -> Replays and enable old replay viewer.. This is likely because when you unload a plugin it simply calls PluginName.OnUnload() here and doesn't actually do anything to the plugin. The plugin has to manage not executing code if it is unloaded.\nCurrently, plugins are loaded straight into HDT and within the HDT AppDomain. It would be amazing to be able to load each individual plugin within its own AppDomain and unload that AppDomain after calling the OnUnload function.. duplicate of #3235 . There are already have similar controls in Settings -> advanced options -> hotkeys. You can bind a key to \"edit active deck\" in which it'll open the deck for editing and you can change it from there.\nThe hotkeys menu could be improved with more hotkey actions such as closing the options menu like you've said.. This may be possible with something like OnTopReplica capturing the entire screen that has HDT and HS on it and having it pass through the clicks. . \n\nHey, yeah I just changed how the cards list in each deck. Cards were wrapped with an \\ tag, and I've changed that to just being a \\ with only the card name being linked. I hope this isn't too much trouble to fix.. I don't think this type of tracking is possible to implement. The cards you switch into aren't sent to your client, and if they did, would not be shown in HDT as it would be an info leak.. That sounds like a cool idea. It very well could be a plugin, or perhaps a new project all together..

This is a potentially better method at doing the extracting with drag-and-drop.\nwhen reading a zip file, the name property of an entry seems to be null when it's a folder. I'm not sure why and if this is a bug, but as of now, it seems to work. This will also make sure the second entry contains a slash, otherwise the root contains multiple files,. Thanks on the discord!\nThis now will extract to the plugins folder regardless and then check if the directory is a single folder. if so, it will delete the folder which it just extracted to and re-extract correctly.\nThis fixes the problem with Arena Tracker (and various other plugins) while still maintaining the directory structure.. Lucky for you, there is already a plugin that aims for this functionality called Advisor. Instead of looking through Hearthpwn it uses Metastats:\n\nFirst, the import function of Advisor allows you to quickly import hundreds of standard archetype decks from MetaStats.net. Currently the top 5 played standard decks of each archetype and each class of the last 7 days are imported. \n\n. closed in favor of #3054 .

I think it's ready :) I'm open to any more suggestions or code I should refine.\nIt seems to work good right now, I tested running when the user has hit Github's rate limit and it seems to work fine. If so, when downloading available, it uses a cached version.\nIf it hits when checking for updates, it will simply show \"up to date\" and will only notify the user they have hit the rate limit if they try to update and have hit it. \nOne thing we could do to fix the GitHub rate limit issue may be to include a GitHub API key in the config, however, it may get hit too quick as more people are likely to use plugins over the Imgur screenshot uploader, which was already hitting the rate limit some (#2806).\nAnother solution may be to obtain via a cache on HearthSim's end and/or host a list of plugins and update details that would be updated every day/x hours. This would mean it only requests from github when a user goes to download, and not when checking.. I'll probably revisit this in a while when I have more time and a clear vision for the end goal, instead of something like this where it becomes something more and the code style falls apart. .

GitHub rehost:\n. See #3143. Do you mean delete or hide any decks the current account doesn't have?. Make sure auto-import is on in options (advanced) -> tracker -> importing. Hey, that plugin is no longer maintained by its original creator. We forked it and the HearthSim community is maintaining it at:\nhttps://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Collection-Tracker\nHowever please note we have not yet added Un'Goro implementation and the plugin is probably completely broken at the moment. It will likely be updated within 24 hours of this comment.. @ElfoOscuro it has now been updated for ungoro and should work.\nThere is also continuous importing so you no longer have to click \"import\" each time.. ^Means it's likely a problem with the Updater (checking for updates before opening) being unable to open the exe..

My guess is that you're using a CPU-based encoder in OBS, and when doing that the CPU is strained with having to always chroma key out the overlay hdt is putting up. Depending on your graphics card it would be better to use a gpu-accelerated encoder.. Closed in favor of #3235. duplicate of #3235 . HDT (the deck tracker) no longer controls exporting to hearthstone with the addition of deck strings. The Hearthstone client is the one that controls adding golden/regular cards.\nThe button messing up isn't HDT either, possibly post in hs-bugs.\n. A solution to the export golden/non-golden selection option would be to have an option in settings to use the old exporting mechanism.. ctrl+tab in most applications is switching the currently selected item, in chrome and web browsers it's the current tab. . similar\n2729 #2640 #263 #21 #6\n. https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows/issues/1040. Hearthstone handles what type of card to add to your deck, be it golden or regular. HDT cannot modify what type HS imports.\nFor more information see\n3290\nhttps://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/3287#issuecomment-307339091. You are not on creators update.\n\nOperating System: Windows 10 Pro Insider Preview 16232, .NET Framework: 461275\n\nBuild 1703 is the widely released creators update, and I can't find a source for that .Net build number . Based on your system info it looks like you are running some windows insider preview build. In order to reduce the amount of variables try unsubscribing from insider builds in Windows settings.. Pretty sure this is intended, as those cards did not originate from your deck. \nWe could have them appear with the \"gift box\"/\"created\" icon but adding 10 cards to the list will make it extremely cramped and you may end up not being able to read the card names. \n. If you were referring to cards in the deck (not yet drawn): #3100. Will be fixed with next HDT release.. possibly related to #3143, but instead crashing.. can you try:\nWin+R\ntry URL protocol handlers like blizzard:// or blizzardapp://\nand report if they open the blizzard app?\nIf possible we can add in handling for old and new battle.net installations.. We actually don't launch the exe's to start game processes, the exe's on your system like Hearthstone and the beta launcher will open battle.net if it wasn't passed any login arguments.\nhttps://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/blob/master/Hearthstone%20Deck%20Tracker/Utility/Helper.cs#L343\ncs\nProcess.Start(\"battlenet://WTCG\");\nIf the new blizzard app doesn't register any protocols the launch HS system may need to be changed.. Did you follow https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/Setting-up-the-log.config completely?. If you open and close Hearthstone, then open the log config, what does it have in it?. Duplicate of #2987\nThe synopsis is that HDT can't absolutely know if the opponent has a minion in their hand, which is required for Hidden Cache to trigger. . Stats/past replay start sync is already a highly requested feature. See the thread below for more details.\nDuplicate of #3235 . @edzam if you'd like, the meta tags were upgraded to where it needs just the deck string over the individual cards https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/RFC-Importing-Implementation.. Based on https://superuser.com/questions/639921/windows-8-pro-version-info-in-registry and results at https://goo.gl/search/windows+8+product+name+registry the registry key check should work.. fixed with release 1.4.2, reopen if this still occurs.. This is a known Hearthstone client bug, and is not related to Hearthstone Deck Tracker. see https://github.com/HearthSim/hs-bugs/issues/790. exception c0000005 is access violation.. The only HDT version that works with the latest Hearthstone is 1.5.0/1.5.1, both of which are on the updated MahApps.Metro. A bug has been created over there https://github.com/RedHatter/Graveyard/issues/24.. One problem is that ~~your system is still reporting Framework Version: v4.0.30319~~, and the error is that it can't find the GUI dll's HDT needs.. This is the windows tracker, please file at https://github.com/HearthSim/HSTracker/issues.. cc @HearthSim/hstracker ^\n. I was wondering, what are the proposed benefits of updating to .NET 4.7.1 compared to the downsides?\nAs of now, every Windows installation from Windows 8 includes .NET 4.5, with windows 7 getting \".NET Framework 4 Client Profile\" in windows update. If 4.7.1 would be required to run HDT, based on .net release history, users would need to download and install the latest .NET themselves or be on the Windows 10 fall creators update v1709 which could break existing HDT installations. \n. Could more information be provided on this to try to debug it? I'd like to know\n\nWhen do the frames drop? Is it only when cards are being played (log file being written to) or is it every x seconds?\nDo you have Nvidia shadowplay/ShareX enabled?\nAre the frame drops only micro-stutters, or does it feel like they last longer than ~0.1 seconds?\n\nOne thing to try is temporarily disabling windows defender real-time monitoring, as it may scan HS/HDT every time the log file is being managed.. Ref #2351 and https://github.com/HearthSim/hs-bugs/issues/19. System.Net.WebException: The request was aborted: Could not create SSL/TLS secure channel.\nLooks like an issue with contacting GitHub releases. Are you behind a proxy, VPN,  or something of the sorts that may try to intercept and/or kill a secure connection?\nAnother possible explanation is the TLS certificate it gave wasn't in the Windows Root CA store. Can you check the certificate chain?\n\nGo to https://github-production-release-asset-2e65be.s3.amazonaws.com/ \n\n(for chrome) click the \"secure\" next to the URL, click certificate, and post here what it says for \"issued by\" (https://judge2020.me/rqoonNugbW.gif)\n\n\n(for firefox) click the padlock, click the \"next\" arrow, then post here what it says for \"verified by\" (https://judge2020.me/b8354pdEqH.gif). The installer's main purpose is to seamlessly install the application in order to simplify the process, and make it feel like a modern app store-type app where installations and updates just work.\n\n\nThe installation and AppData directories only take up ~150 MB, which isn't much as SSD and hard drive storage prices keep getting cheaper.\nFor those that do want to control where installer files end up, the portable version is still maintained and likely won't be going anywhere for a while.. Are you able to visit hsreplay.net through your browser? Is there a Cloudflare challenge/captcha page first?. Relevant squirrel issue: https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows/issues/863, I'm not sure if this is something fixable in HDT itself.. Duplicate of #3235. Please include a log file with your report: instructions.. Can you try with 1.6.4? I'm able to install just fine on a new VM.\nAlso, see: windows log file reporting.. Also note, this should go on https://github.com/HearthSim/HSTracker as HSTracker is the mac app.. I originally thought the ? after card would return false if card was null, however I agree IsNullOrEmpty is probably much cleaner.\n. The header is inside the loop because when declared outside the loop, it would be reset to null after the first iteration and GitHub would not serve the request.. It's usually recommended to have Nuget in your path somewhere.. ",

Hmm im sorry but seems it still presents in the tracker. Try to do these steps:\n- start Windows with tracker autostarted\n- do not open tracker main window!\n- start HS\n- start any game with random deck for example\n- you will not see any cards for yourself.\n- click right mouse button on the HDT tray icon and choose 'Use no deck'\n- this will not work. You will not see your cards.\n- open main tracker window and choose Tracker > Use no deck\n- this will work. Cards will appear.\n. Thats because i want to see which cards came to my hand from drawing or from another way and which of them were discarded. The difference is that I can play cards from my hand and I cant play my discarded cards ^^\n. Yes I play 'no deck' mode.

Well, I've taken the time to create an actual icon, which is actually quite a bit of work. An icon is actually several images in a single file, with smaller sizes needing some extra work because of the limited number of pixels.\nFor this icon, I chose four sizes, as recommended by a website. The sizes are 256x256, 48x48, 32x32, and 16x16.\nI cleaned up the original image, and by itself the cleaned up image is used for the 256 size icon.\nI made a separate image and tweaked it a bit to avoid aliasing issues with the 48 and 32 size icons.\nThe 16 size icon is basically pixel art - at that size, even being in the resolution independent SVG format won't yield a satisfactory image.\nI used inkscape to create the original artwork (based on the Hearthstone \"deck book\" seen in Hearthstone when opening a pack), the gimp for the 16x16 icon, and the little-known utility @icon sushi to compile the images into an icon.\nI'm still new to GitHub, so I'm not sure of the best way to attach the files, so I'm using Dropbox to share the file:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/cylxlga9pz081so/hearthtrack.zip?dl=0\nThe contents are:\n- Two SVG files, which can be opened in Inkscape. hearthtrack_lowres is the one tweaked for the 48 and 32 size icons.\n- Four PNG files, which are the four icon sizes.\n- hearthtrack.ico, which is the final icon.\nMaking icons for all 20 colors would require 80 images, I don't think I have that amount of time.\nI'm actually a programmer, not an artist, by trade, but I do dabble in art from time to time. Hope it's satisfactory.\n. Okay, I've decided to go with the gray, since it is a color already used in your app, and for some odd reason that code seems rather sexy ;).\nHere is the link to the updated file:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/xqcegxtdyyj177a/hearthtrack.zip?dl=0\nEdit: I should note that all of the software I used is either open source or freeware, so if you ever want to make edits yourself using the same tools I used, you can.\n. You're welcome :).\n. > Disable \"Save files in AppData\" in Options > Other > Tracker, that saved all the data directly in the tracker folder.

Any alternative colors should remain relatively neutral, though, as it doesn't change color with the theme.\nI'm also thinking that shrinking it a bit to add a tiny bit of space around the edges may help, as it goes right up to the edges in the title bar.\n.

Gah, I was using HearthPwn.\nAh well, I suppose this will work too.\n. Do tell the Hearthstats folks to please require confirmation of email addresses. Otherwise, I could easily to pretend to be from somebody else's email address, and prevent somebody from signing up for hearthstats by creating a login before they do.\nEDIT: Never mind, I send him an email, and he responded :).\n. Thanks for the info, Epix.\nI was using the task manager to re-maximize the Hearthstone window, but fullscreen windowed should work better.\n. This is late, but I haven't looked at GitHub in a while . . . Gmail allows you to select an email to view, or to select multiple emails. They use checkboxes for multiple email selection. Some people may bemoan the addition of a clickable element on an individual item, yes, but it is acceptable design.\nGmail also displays tags inline with the title.\nGoogle's new \"Inbox\" product has a more modern design - it may be a good idea to see if you can pull some design cues from that. I can send an invite if you don't have it.\n. It wouldn't show up very well in the forums with a white background, but an inverted icon would definitely work with some color themes. I'm not at my PC right now to check with all of the themes, and those are just rough drafts anyways. \nAs far as the splash screen goes, I think that was put together by Epix, so that's up to him. I could try to come up with something, though.\nThe only thing I wouldn't want to do is to create an icon for each color theme. I have to create several sizes of the icon, and the smaller sizes of the icon require some tweaking and some pixel art to look good. That would just multiply the time it takes to create the icon. \n. Okay, I've created the new icon. Easier than expected this time, once I sat down to actually do it. The only size that needed special treatment was the 16x16 version of the icon, but that's to be expected as 16x16 is such an incredibly small size to work with. I decided to remove the \"spikes\" for that size.\nThe file includes:\n- The source .SVG files.\n- The new icon.\n- The 16x16 version of the icon for the system tray.\n- A \"ghostwhite\" XAML version, which has white as the base color for dark accents.\n- A \"ghostblack\" XAML version, which has black as the base color for light accents.\nYou can find the file here, on Dropbox.\n. Try going to options -> Settings and toggling the \"Advanced window search\" checkbox.\n. Yup, I noticed that as well.\n\n. I see I can update existing decks with a new version as well, very good! This definitely makes this a great deck tracker :).\n. ",

But i run HS always in fullscreen. I have only one screen though.\nAlso i noticed that it seems Blizzard changed the focus behaviour of HS with the release of GvG. Before that, i was able to have the tracker mainwindow (or for example the taskbar) ontop of HS, while HS was always shown in the background.

Yup, complete HS restart.\n. Yes, i always enable that option. Also, that minimize bug only happened when i didnt choose the option for the notedialog \"Wait until back in menu\" (but then the notedialog didnt disappear after setting the note which i assume was because of the not noticing end-of-match bug. The overlay wasnt hidden too when i choose that option even though i was in the menu).\n. Thx!

I'll continue testing and report any issues, but so far so good!\nThank you for your attention to this much appreciated enhancement.\n. I believe this is a Windows 8 or Windows 8 touchscreen issue, and I can reproduce the problem.  The issue is that in Windows 8 (at least on a touchscreen device) the card collection search UI is actually different than the search UI in Windows 7.  As the following image shows, in Windows 8 on a touchscreen, the text entry search box moves from the bottom of the screen to the top-right corner.\n\nThe weird thing is that the text entry box doesn't move until it is clicked on, and can revert back to the original location after a card is selected (but it will move again when clicked on).  This behavior throws off the scripting for HDT's export function.  I have experienced the same issue as OP when trying deck export to Hearthstone on a Windows 8 touchscreen machine (only 16-18 cards entered).  This happens every time.  The same deck is exported perfectly on my Windows 7 machine.\nThere is a pretty easy workaround.  Find hearthstone.exe in C:\\Program Files (x86), right click, and select Properties.  Then go to the Compatibility tab.  Check the box for \"Run this program in compatability mode for\" and select Windows 7.  Then restart Hearthstone.  \nLet me know if you need any further information.\n. I won't speak for Epix, but I suspect the card database used in the tracker comes from http://hearthstonejson.com.  So once that site adds the new cards, then Epix (or you, for that matter) can use the new database without duplication or waste of effort.\nPersonally, I wouldn't want the new cards showing up in the tracker now.  They're not available for play, and it would merely complicate the deck creation process (and potentially cause issues with the deck exporter).  I'm sure there are going to be websites that will allow you to theorycraft with the new cards.  Personally, I don't think the deck tracker is the right tool for the job.\n.

This tracker uses the log file generated by Hearthstone itself to provide tracking.  This is perfectly legal according to all available evidence from the game developers.  However, this log does not provide for exporting wholesale decks (although it can, helpfully, compile a whole or partial deck based on the cards you played last game or that your opponent played last game).\nTo pull whole decks from the client would require interacting with the game in a completely different manner than reading the log.  Whether such interaction would violate the TOS is much more questionable, and certainly more risky.  In light of the recent attention to third-party programs that improperly interact with the client, I, for one, believe in the old saying: \"Better safe than sorry.\"\n.

Edit: ninja'd by Epix  :)\n\nWhy does it also put the artist's name in the search bar when adding cards?\n\nBecause certain cards contain the name of other cards, creating conflicts.  For example, a search for Fireball will also return Archmage Antonidas because the Archmage Antonidas card contains the word \"Fireball\" in its description.  (Same will be true when GvG releases, since a search for Leper Gnome will also return Mekgineer Thermaplugg.)  Using the artist name helps avoids these conflicts.\nI'm not saying that there isn't a better/more accurate way to do this.  I'm just explaining the reason it works this way now.\n.

    "rdellaripa": "Just found this thread because I've gotten disconnected a few times today as games were ending, and they left the games as mode \"None\", which seems to cause problems with the sync to Hearthstats.\n. I, too, am having this issue, where if I have Auto Deck Selection enabled, and it tries to figure out a deck I've switched to, it constantly pops up the dialogue for which deck it could be. I think this started around the release of .9, or it could be that I have lots of decks and it's getting lost in them. If I can help figure it out, let me know.\n. So I had a thought about this this morning...what if the stats that are normally shown are for all the current .X versions (1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc) combined? That way if you've just swapped a couple cards here or there but it's basically the same deck, it displays the same stats, but if you've made significant enough changes to save it as, say, 2.0 instead of 1.8, the stats shown are just for 2.x. \n. Is there any existing phrasing in reference to the save function on 1.0, 1.1, 2.0? If not, I'd favor something like \"current major version\"...\n. Nope, I've tried that a few times. I also removed that deck with the\n\"UNKNOWN\" cards in it.

    "GiggliG": "With today's update, you can find games marked as \"None\" by looking at the stats filter with options, \"All\", \"With Deck\", \"Without Deck\". \nSelect Without Deck, and your games will hopefully show up. \nThen you can move them to the deck they should be assigned to.\nI hope this helps with hearthstats sync.\n.

Obviously manually added games wouldn't support the replay/game history feature, but would probably just need: Class Played, Opponent Class, Win/Loss, Coin/No Coin. \n. I cant comment on how this works, but the idea is something I find EXTREMELY useful.\n. lol, I'm up for testing.\nIf i install it in a separate folder, will it use its own data store, and is there a way I can import a COPY of my old data into it so it doesn't change that data in use? I'm worried about data corruption.\n. Okay, backed that up and will test this over the weekend.\n. I've done a quick test, and it looks good so far.\nI made a deck change in HDT, and saved it as v1.1.\nI then played a game in hearthstone, and realised I'd forgotten to make the change the deck there. That game then got saved as a v1.1 game, though it was still using the v1.0 deck list.\nSo I think you'll need a button to \"Move Game to other version of this deck\" like you have with \"Move to other deck\" because people will make the same mistake I did. I think it makes sense for these to be two different buttons, and the \"change version\" button should be greyed out if the active deck only has one version.\nSome feature suggestions:\nI'd like the (optional, not required) ability to put a text descriptor with a version name, like\nSecrets Mage, v1.1, Anti-aggro\nI think you could have a Version Switcher, at the top of the deck display, so you can see what versions exist, and change which one is active and displayed. This would not be in edit mode, but in normal mode.\nThis would allow people to flip through their versions, and also change which one HDT detects as the active one when playing hearthstone. I'm surer there are people who will create multiple versions, and then go back to an earlier version as the most effective one.\nIf you have this view version mode, you could have a popup or panel showing the differences between the current view, and the last version that was active - like on hearthpwn, where they have updates, like \"+1 Knife Juggler, -1 Cold Light Oracle\" or whataver\"\nIt could be a hovering tooltip somewhere , maybe, to avoid clutter, or could be a simple text added to the bottom of the deck list.\nHere's one out-there feature suggestion that I think will be very useful for some (like me) but maybe not for most, so i could understand if you skip this.\nHave an option for the program to treat major versions (v1, v2, v3) as separate decks, which each can appear as choices in the deck detection/selection screen when you play in hearthstone.\nFor example, I know some people maintain multiple versions of a deck that are almost identical, but switch between them depending on changes in the meta. I maintain two versions of several decks for playing in the US and EU servers, which are very similar, but have differences because my card collections aren't the same in those two servers. I'd love to be able to combine them into a single deck, and have HDT suggest the two major versions when I start a game (or use the correct one, when it detects the cards that only exist in that deck).\n. I'll continue testing, as I play more games :)\n. Another suggestion: with this change, all decks get (v1.0) shown as part of their name in the deck list.\nI suggest having that only show up if there is more than one version. Allowing people to see at a glance which of their decks have multiple versions.\nWill you also be integrating versions with the \"Update from Web\" feature? So that if a deck has changed online, the original version is saved, and a new version is added with the changes?\n. Regarding \"Update from web\": Every time I've used it, it has been \"The deck is up to date\" so I'm not sure what happens when it does find changes to update. So maybe my suggestion on that isn't needed.\n. One thing I've noticed.\nIn the stats section, it shows games broken down by version, like v1.0, v1.1.\nHowever, games from before the version feature was added are not listed in the first version. They are in ALL, but should be included in the first version of the deck too.\n. I haven't tried the new version yet, but I have one or two new suggestions:\nWhen you save a deck, you get the dropdown: Save 1.0, 1.1, 2.0 etc. I suggest adding to the bottom of this: \"New Deck\" (or having a separate button: \"Save as New\") and removing the pop up that appears after saving \"do you want to overwrite or save as a new deck\" \nThe Overwrite/New Copy dialog is a bit irritating, popping up every time you save. People used to using files are used to having \"Save\" and \"Save As New\" as separate functions. \nI also suggest having a Delete Version feature, and a \"Move This Version to New Deck\" features.\n. That's a good question about Save As. I just assumed you'd save it as 1.0 of the new deck. Since it's a new deck, you are starting over with that and no history so it probably ought to be 1.0.\nYour submenu idea is perfectly workable, but saving as other version numbers may be more complexity than is needed. \nDelete: I like the menu approach, but I don't know about a submenu.\n- EDIT\n  * DELETE (Deck)\n  * DELETE (Selected Version)\n  Since there's only two options, having a submenu is overkill.\nClone:\nYeah, with Clone I would just have Clone (entire deck) and Clone (selected version).\nLooking good!\n. I agree keeping games for historic reasons makes sense, but if you delete the deck it's very hard to get to view those games. Maybe the Stats/Overall frame could do a Class Played filter, to make that easier. \nSomething to also consider.\nWhen you save the deck, you still get that \"How do you wish to save the deck popup\" with Overwrite and Save as New options.\nI assume that dialog will be phased out? I hope so anyway, it always made me panic a little (thinking, \"If I overwrite, will I erase all my saved deck data?\"). Will there still be a need for it?\nThere's another popup that occurs when you clone a deck, that asks if you want to keep the history. It is very confusingly written.\nThe popup says, \nClone Game Stats?\n- \"Cloned games do not count towards class or overall stats.\n- Yes / No\nI am never sure which button to press to make a copy that has no stats, and it could be interpreted to mean that if you click Yes, you are agreeing with the text (Cloned games do not count against stats) and if you click No you are disagreeing with that.\nThis IMO should be rewritten as something like:\nTitle: History of Games Played\nText: \"Do you want to clone the history of games played, as well as the cards? (Whether you click yes or no, cloned games do not count towards overall stats.)\"\nButtons: Yes / No\n. Will there be a way to move games played from one version to another? I just noticed you have fixed the games not showing up in 1.0 correctly, but the three games I played in version 1.1 are listed under v 1.0. \nAlso, unrelated (I'd report this as a general bug, but it might just be this version): When you clone a deck, and keep the game history , the Name column is empty in the new deck's history (and the * which shows there someone conceded is missing too). \n. I'd like this, but there's a complication: People may play in more than one server (or even with more than one account) so could have more than one card collection.\nSo you'd need the ability to add cards to a specific collection, and then switch which collection HDT was using as the active collection, for the purpose of showing you (perhaps by highlightign) which cards in a deck aren't in that collection.\n. While this is true, i don't think the timer matters much when nozdormu is active - if you are taking time to look at the timer, you might be in trouble!\n. When you look at your stats on hearthstats, you can filter by Hearthstone Season, and there's also a graph of your win rate over time on your dashboard. It's clear from these that all my game history (going back to last July or August) was given the same date, Feb 12th, and almost the same time, which is the time of upload.\nIf this is just a display issue, and is fixable, great, but for now it does seem like hearthstats is using the upload time as the game played time. I understand how this might happen, because the hearthstats uploader is used in real time. So it might be a limitation on hearthstats end.\n. That would work, but I think it's smoother if it happens automatically. You can always go back to the deck you were in first by clicking a game you played with that deck.\nA supplementary suggestion: have the hovertext when you hover over a deck game show the name of the deck used.\n. That's a different suggestion. I wasn't talking about while playing, but while browsing your game history.\nI agree, when in game, it would be nice to change decks in HDT without it affecting the overlay.\nI'm not sure how best that would be to implement. When HDT doesn't detect a deck correctly, you have to select it manually to get it displayed in the overlay.\n. Is this enhancement likely to be added?\n. I see this issue too, being able to move multiple decks at once would be awesome.\n. You can already use the normal multi-select commands (eg. CTRL+left click to select several items at once), but when you move to another deck, only the top deck is actually moved.\n. Fantastic!\n. Excellent suggestions.\n. Date ranges?\nDoes the time box include the same date picking options as on the arena stats: pikcing custom allows you to select a start and an end date?\nAlso, the Mode: what I'd love is a multi-select option here, so you could filter on Ranked + Casual, or exclude Brawl + Innkeeper, say.\n. I would like to see the deck's name, too, but I don't think that screen has enough room for it.\nMy suggestion is to make it a hovertext, so when you hover the mouse over a deck, you see the deck name floating above it.\nI also submitted a request so that when you click on a game, it changes the active deck to the deck used in that game. Someone else suggested adding a button to do that. Either approach would be good.\n. Another thought:\nthat list could have a right-click menu for some obscure options, leaving the row of buttons at the bottom for the most well-used functions.\n. I've suggested this in the past, and I think it's a good idea. but it has a problem that some fraction of the userbase use HDT for multiple accounts, or multiple servers, where you have different libraries with different card collections.\n. I'm having this problem too.\nBasically, whenever I have it set to autodetect, it presents a list of decks to choose from, I pick the right deck, and it pops up the list again. No matter how many times I try, or which deck I pick, it will not accept it, and I have to disable deck detection and manually select my deck.\n. Update: this isn't happening all of the time. It's puzzling.\n. The OP has a clever suggestion, with two problems I can think of.\n1) Player card collection will change over time, so you need to be able to update with changes easily. (This could be automated using the same system).\n2) The bigger problem is, some people like me play on more than one server, and others use different accounts. So people will have multiple different deck collections to track. This makes it complex. But not insurmountable - there could be a dropdown setting to switch which collection is active.\n. I am not the developer, but I have had issues with dropbox sync before, with it locking files while they are being synced so the file doesn't get updated. When this happens, though, dropbox usually creates a copy of the file, so you can have a look at the files being synced and see if any of them have Copy (or your name, like \"Fenris Wolffe's Copy\") in the name.\nIf that is happening, it confirms DropBox is the culprit.\n. oh yes please! I would love this feature.\n. Do you need to update this to work with the  latest HDT? It doesn't seem to work for me any more.\n. Great!\n. Would there be someway to get logs from the android version of hearthstone in a format that would work with this?\n. Interesting idea, I like it. Though ideally you should be able to set up your own tagging categories.\n. That sounds pretty tricky to get right, and might need to be regularly updated with changes in the meta.\nI can imagine advantages to being able to assign custom tags manually to games, regardless.\n. Having seen how track-o-bot does it, I retract my early objection. Epix37's idea of basing an archetype on certain key cards seems like it would work. It would be nice to have the ability to override an automatic assignment though.\n. Great idea, and execution.\nWill this distinguish between decks with notes, and imported decks where the only note is the website url?\nMy preference would be to remove that url from the notes, and have a seperate button for that, as discussed in an earlier suggestion.\n. Some of the organisation seems a bit iffy.\nIn the old options section, the heading Decks contains things which are all about the overlay.\nSo I'd change the section you have above that goes like this:\nDecks \n-- General\n-- Opponent\nTo:\nOverlay\n- General (the stuff that's currently in General-> Overlay)\n- Additional Windows\n- Player\n- Opponent\n- Other (see below)\nMost of the options in General -> Other are also about the overlay, and should be moved to the Other tab suggested above. \nThe option seettings \"Full text in new deck, card tool tips in tracker, show deck stats in new window, keep stats when deleting deck\" should be moved to a section of their own.\nI'd replace the General and Other sections with something like:\nTracker \n- General (put whats currently in Other/Tracker)\n- Record Games\n- Export\n- Import\n- Settings (those settings I mentioned above could be moved here)\n- Logging\nI think that covers everything.\n. The files have been sent.\n. Great!\n. I had an idea for the options for this setting:\nDisplay Stats For:\n- Latest Version (current intended behavior I believe)\n- Active Version\n- All Time History (The setting I would prefer)\n- Active Filter from the stats tab\n. Good enough :)\n. There's a setting, \"Close with Hearthstone\" in Options --> Other. If you check that, whenever you close hearthstone, HDT will close, too, which could help you.\n. I'd love this, too.\n. I gave this try with this deck:\n\nHere's what got imported.\n\n. If this feature does prove reliable, one great feature would be to import to an already existing deck as an extra version.\nI think the most common way people will use this is, they'll take a deck they have in both HDT and hearthstone, modify it in hearthstone, and then export it to HDT and want the original deck there updated with the tweaks.\n. I've tried this with one deck, and had the same issue with my earlier post. The exported deck had mostly cards that weren't in the deck i created.\n. If you're an AAA games publisher, you don't even need to slap beta on it :)\n. I agree having a better filter for time would be great.\nI like the idea of showing multiple decks of the same class separately as with versions.\n. The way i solved this was as follows:\n- change the name of each deck you want to combine, like Handlock1, Handlock2, etc., so they sort in the deck list view properly\n- export screenshots of each deck you want to combine into one\n- Create a new deck, call it Handlock-new, set it up with the cards from the handlock1, and save it \n- select handlock1, look at stats view, move all games into handlock-new.\n- now go back to handlock-new, edit it, and enter the deck used in handlock2. Save it, and select version 1.1.\n- select handlock2, look at stats view, move all games to handlock-new, making sure version 1.1 is selected.\n- repeat until all handlock1, handlock2, etc. decks have been combined into handlock-new\n- review the handlock-new deck, make sure everything is correct\n- now delete all the old decks, and rename handlock-new to Handlock.\nThat's pretty tedious, but once it's done, it's done. It's very easy to proceed from there, making new versions when you need to and HDT will handle the stat tracking properly from now on.\n. I just tested this with mass tagging, and it worked perfectly, which will be a godsend.\nIt was very slow, though you did mention performance would be an issue, so that's not too much of a concern.\n. I had something weird happen\nI selected three decks, went to edit tags, and created a new tag \"Promising\". I then clicked UP, to move it up the list, and got a second tag of the same name. I think it created a new tag and moved that one up.\nI selected it again, and clicked Top - and a new tag of the same name appeared at the top of the tag list, while the original remained at the bottom.\nAside: you shouldn't be able to have multiple tags using the same name.\n. Sorry I didn't get to test this before the official update, but it does work now.\nThere is one glitch unrelated to multi-select:\n- Select the tag at the bottom of the tag list. \n- Click Up one or more times, so it is no longer the bottom entry.\n- Click down, repeatedly. The tag will stop moving when it is one above the bottom. Pressing down will not move it to the last position in the tag list.\nThe Bottom button works fine.\n. Yes, Epix, that screenshot is exactly what I had in mind.\nYou asked why: When I change the name, I'm always a little wary of accidentally incrementing the version number.  It does seem overkill to open the entire edit deck window just to change the name too,\n. I normally have Hide In Menu checked, and was a bit confused when the wins counter didn't show up till I guessed this was the cause.\nI think it would be nice, though not essential, for that to be an independent item that you switch on or off, independently of the other overlay elements.\n. I like that idea, too.\n. All, Current Season, This Week, and Today make sense to me. I agree that Previous periods don't make sense for this area.\n\"Since Last Expansion\" could make sense too, or being able to set a specific start date (\"From:\" ) in Options, though i could see why you might think those are going too far.\n. Excellent.\n. That's a good idea\n. I'm not 100% sure of what you mean by your first question, but the BAT file should contain the full path to your HS exe and the HDT exe.\nAfter the bat file is created, if you have used full paths for the above addresses, you can put it anyway. You can create a shortcut to the bat and add that shortcut to your taskbar or start menu.\nFor you last question, the answer is yes IF you have HDT set up to shut down with HS (it's a setting in the options). Otherwise, no you dont have to. but if you create a shortcut to the bat and put it somewhere convenient like your taskbar, you might as well.\n. That sounds good, but I'd still like something like the suggestion above, so that all 4 tabs are available from a single click.\n. Personally I like the fact you have Deck - Games and Overall- Games, plus Deck - Stats, and Overall - Stats as separate tabs. I dont see why you couldn't have 4 tabs (5 if you include Arena runs, which is a sensible addition).\nRegarding your idea of adding Deck as a Filter: it seems like a good compromise, except it doesn't take into account how many decks some people might have. Switching between Overall and Deck is somethign I do a lot, and being able to do it the current way (two clicks) is much better than having to use a drop down and scroll down a loooong list (I have over a 100 decks in my HDT) to find the one I want to look at. That will tiresome old very fast.\nI hadn't noticed all the inconsistencies you point out between the tabs, but those are good observations.\n. Would it be possible to have the frame containing the actions resizable, so i could expand it to make everything single line, or compress to make it double line?\nAlternatively, use a symbol or colour to represent Draws and another symbol or colour to represent Plays, Deaths, etc, then you can omit those words. \nEdit: I see you already thought of using icons. I do like that idea.\n. Just installed and had a look at replays. It's already a big improvement over the old version.\nRegarding the colour/icon suggestions: Is it possible to use different shaped boxes? It already looks like a flowchart, and a different flowchart-style container for each type of event might help. You'd need a key, though.\nOne thing to consider about grouping things like onyxia's multiple 1/1s, and also things like muster for battle, etc, is what happens if you have knife juggler down? You have to show the damage each summon causes.\n. Regarding hero power, would the class icon work? Or is that too detailed for this view?\n. For Play, maybe something like a card deck, with one card being drawn.\nSomething like simplified versions of\nhttp://www.clker.com/cliparts/8/5/4/b/11949911381154569537asso_carte_architetto_fr_01.svg.med.png\nor\nhttp://images.clipartpanda.com/open-giving-hands-clipart-hand-with-card-hi.png\n. Would this allow a plugin writer to create a plugin which exports the data you see on the stats screen to another file, like a csv spreadsheet?\n. That sounds great, andburn. Would you be able to choose between deck, class, or all stats for export? (Not that it really matters, you could filter after export if you grab everything).\nEpix, would a plugin be able to alter the layout of current forms? \nHere for instance here are a few features I'd like to see, and I wonder if plugins could make them?\n- Add an extra line of detail to the Deck Stats page,  that showed the frequency each enemy class was encountered within the current filter time period (not just by this deck, by all decks)? \n- Add new filters to the deck stats (like server), replace existing filters (like change the Mode to a multi-select format, so you could pick Ranked + Casual, or change Timeframe to a date picker with Start and End times).\n- Edit stats en masse, so i could select all games with a particular deck, and change the server to US or EU, for instance. \n- add a text box at the top of the deck list, so that I could enter letters and it would filter to show only decks with those letters in the name\n- at the top of the deck list we have Arena, Constructed, and down the side the 9 classes plus archive. In one of those places I'd like to add specific tags (like \"Favourite\") so i could click and it would filter to decks with that tag, but also when i click one of the other buttons it would clear that filter (to avoid the menu fiddling).\n. I see this happen from time to time with Innkeeper games. Sometimes they get removed automatically, sometimes i have to do it manually.\n. This looks awesome. I think you have the two most important functions shown already. \nAn Edit Active Deck could handy, to reduce friction for someone who edits their decks in Hearthstone than goes to HDT to do the same edits.\n. Did anything come of this idea? I don't see it in the latest update.\n. agreed.\n. Extra feature: On the overall stats tab, you can view win rates as wins or percentages, which is good.\nI'd like an extra line of data along the bottom, which is \"this class's games as a percentage of the total games played\"\nI do sometimes have to look at them and manually figure it out, and see, \"in the last month, 30% of my games have been against hunter, so i wont play something that is weak against hunter\".\nObviously this is just the step 1 from the suggestion in my previous post. HDT already calculates these percentages, because they are used in the average win rate, so it would be nice to display them.\n. Assuming you know where HDT keeps its data (%Appdata%/hearthstonedecktracker) you could try this:\n- Make sure HDT isn't running\n- Backup your data folder.\n- Delete the data folder (HDT) and the install folder\n- Do a new install of HDT\n- run it once, set up config how you want, shut it down\n- From your backup, copy and paste the Deckstats.xml. PlayerDecks.xml, and the Games and Replays folders. Don't copy the config.xml file unless you want to set up again.\nNow run HDT and see how it works.\nRemember to keep your Backup in case this doesn't work.\n. Oh yes, As Epix knows, I've panicked over what i thought was lost data before but I'd actually set a filter and later forgot about it. So click Tracker -> Quick Filter -> All to check this.\n. I'd like this too.\n. In your screenshot, the deck tracker is already appearing in hearthstone. See the white text at both sides of the heathstone window?\nWhat you need to do in HDT is go to New menu, and create the deck that you are using. Do this for each deck. (If you are using decks found online, you can usually use the import menu to import them into HDT).\nOnce you have your decks created in HDT, it will display properly in hearthstone.\n. I came here to post this issue too.\nNote: names from before the update show perfectly well. For new games, HDT now seems to be storing the class name in place of opponents name.\n. Since raising the issue above, I haven't seen this behaviour repeat. \nI had a deck where when i viewed it in hearthstone through the overlay, the displayed name was the wrong one. \nI went back to the tracker, opened the Edit Deck screen, saw the name was correct (the short name, not the web name). I then saved it again, and the name was now displayed properly in the overlay.\nNot sure why this happened - maybe it was just a glitch with that single deck.\n.

I don't know how easy this is, but it would make things so much easier for importing decks people often share on sites like reddit.\n. It's an interesting problem. \nFor showing the active deck, maybe you could change the border, or put a little symbol in the name box, like you do with the (N) for Notes. I think a red REC circle like on tv remotes would work pretty well. Placement: maybe bottom of \nI think you need a \"Go to active deck\" function too, maybe in rightclick\nYou could put a little horizontal function bar just below the All - Arena - Constructed headings, with buttons for functions like:\n- Use current deck\n- Go to active deck\n- Toggle sort by class cards first\n- compare deck (select one deck, click compare deck button, click second deck, and it compares them)\n- Clear tag filter\n- View Tags selection (I always thought this should be more visible)\nJust some ideas.\n. Very familiar looking deck list there :)\nI agree with the earlier commenter that the stats look better on the right where they are now. I like the % above, and wins below, and the positioning makes it easy to scan down the decks and see which is doing well. It's a lot less clear when they are on the left, and yiu have the names of decks between them.\nWhile having rows and rows \"USE\" wastes that valuable UI area with repetition that gives no information about the deck.\nPersonally, I'd swap them: put the Active/Use text where you have the percentage now. It fits better in the space where tags go, because it is kind of a tag. \nI also suggest changing the boarder around the enter deck that is active, not jhust making the text bold. So that it stands out visually, more clearly, when you are scrolling down a long list.\nI do like the way the tags look, that's really good.\nI also think the new Note symbol isn't as good as the original. By placing it at the end of the name - which is of variable length - it's less useful, because you cant scan down the list and see which decks have notes, without also scanning from side to side. The old position was always at the same horizontal position, so very easy to scan and see. \nI'd suggest if your going to put it near the deck name, put it at the left side of the name, not the right. But I vote for keeping it in the old position (though to match tag position, maybe at the bottom of the row rather than the top).\nActually....\nIf you keep the numbers at the right as they are now, and keep the note symbol in its current position, you can put Use/Active below the Notes symbol. Leaving the left of the row for tags. I think this would be more usable and scan-friendly.\n. I'm, also using the legacy view, thank you for incorporating it. It might be a pain for keeping multiple layouts updated, so thank you.\nBecause this is the internet so no one can ever be truly satisfied, I still have a couple of suggestions. :) Three functional ones, and two cosmetic ones.\nUse/Active: \nI just had what I think is a brilliant idea for how to represent this as an actual button. Each deck has a class icon that a lot of the time redundant (I am looking at a long list of druids right now). How about: you click that icon to make a deck active, and it adds an overlay over the icon (maybe a symbol, or the word \"Active\"). \nI believe this would work in both legacy and new layouts (admittedly it would probably make the new layouts unnecessary.)\nThe Notes Icon\nI don't have any great loyalty to the old notes symbol, but the new one does have the problem that it blends into the background too well. This is even more an issue in layout1/2, I think. Using an icon with a grey fill instead of a white or transparent fill would improve this.\nRegardless of icon used, I still think in all layouts it should over at the right side. Having it at the end of the names makes it hard to scan and see which decks have notes. When you scan down, you are also have to scan side to side, and it may sound like that's a minor thing, but it is a significant UI issue. being so close to the name adds to visual clutter, too. Over in the right side, in its old position, it is very easy to identify when scanning down a list. \nJump to Active Deck:\nIf you have a lot of decks its easy to scroll away from the active deck and lose track of where it is. However, the deck list now has an Active Deck layout at the bottom of list. Why not make this clickable, so that when you click it, the tracker automatically scrolls to the currently active deck?\nHighlight Active Deck:\nI think the best way to make clear which deck is active is to somehow highlight the entire row containing the deck title, tags, win%, class icon, etc. Like a heavier or coloured border around that row, or some shading in a different colour. You might invert it so the background is always black and the text is always white (or the class colour if that works). \n\"No Stats\"\nThis text doesn't look great in the legacy layout, but looks worse in Layout 2, and maybe layout 1. When you scroll down, that text is too big, and obscures easy reading. It becomes visual noise. It would be better IMO to have something like \"---\", or simply leave it empty.\nHope you find this useful, you know how much I love HDT and appreciate your work on it.\n. I hadn't noticed the issue had been closed when I made my post, sorry about that!\n. I would love this.\n. Interesting idea. You could probably add other graphs, like win rate over time.\n. I have seen this happen with Gnomish Experimenter, when it pulls a chicken.\n. I'm having the same issue, with the latest patch (10.6). I need to manually click each deck to active.\nOn one of the games, it popped up a message at the top of the hearthstone screen that the deck was the wrong one (various cards missing), and other games it gave no message.\n. I experienced a crash after tavern brawl too.\n. Are you suggesting skipping animations in the hearthstone client? That's not possible.\n. I confirm this is fixed.\n. I have noticed this too. It seems the stats dont update on the deck view page, until you cause them to update by changing the view. If you are looking at a druid deck for instance, click the All button and then come back to Druid, and the stats will have updated.\n. Great! I'll check that out tomorrow.\n. I didn't get a chance to test this out in the brawl, but have just installed it and will check it when this week's brawl opens up.\nFor normal use, it seems to be working fine. Is there anything you'd like to me to test specifically?\n. Check to see if HDT is minimised to the system tray. I fell victim to this once and facepalmed hard when I realised what the issue was.\n. You can capture it with OBS. It's a little tricky to set up the first time, but use the Window Capture option not Game Capture.\n. Is there a way to be sure these games are duplicates, or false positives?\nI am getting duplicates listed for games which have different dates. For example, look at top duplicate below:\n\nThe first game and its duplicates have the same duration, but use different versions of the deck, and the replay (old style) shows different games. And the dates of each duplicate are a month apart.\nIt seems like older games before HDT tracker recorded rank or opponent names produce a LOT of false positives. I have no confidence that any of the games shown in the dialog are actually duplicates because of this.\nSince it's showing me ~200 duplicates, and all of them are checked by default, I cant use this feature. I need them to be unchecked by default, so I can go through, check a few, click delete selected, then come back to it later to work through the rest when i have time.\nAlso, this feature should probably be added to a menu item, so that it isn't popping up at every launch of HDT.\nFinally, I'd suggest having the ability to click \"this is not a duplicate\" on games in the list, so it doesn't keep flagging them as duplicates later.\n. That worked great! It only found 2 duplicates, which really were duplicates, and the dialog didn't pop up on next launch.\nGreat work.\n. The stats i think do get tracked if you change to a different view (such as clicking a different class icon at the top of the deck list), then clicking a different deck to make it active, then switchihng backi to your deck and making it active again.\nIt's an annoyance, to be sure.\n. Have you checked filters? Both in the stats screen (check game mode is set to all), and also in top menu Main -> Sort/Filter -> All.\n. That would be a great plugin riQQ.\n. I've seen this happen a few times too now.\n. I would like to have the ability to add a label to the versions of a deck, so that when you look at a deck with multiple versions, you can have something descriptive next to each version number to remind you what's different about it.\nI sometimes play the same deck in EU and US, with just minor changes due to different card collections. Remembering which is which, especially if I tweak any of the decks to add new versions, is tricky.\n. That looks really good. There's a typo on the opponent's panel \"Opponenets\"\nFor Constructed, here are some stats features I'd like to see, mostly different filters:\n- Filter by server\n- Filter by Mode (checkbox, so you can combine seperate modes - so see stats of Casual + ranked, for instance)\n- Filter by Time (season/month mainly, but again the ability to combine them via checkboxes rather than radio buttons)\n- Custom time filter: set start date and end date\n- Filter by Tag - its possible to filter by tag alrteady, but its clunky, you have to set the universal deck filter first.\nAlso, I'd like the month tracking to include correct time zone offset for each server.\nHS's month starts a different time in EU and US and Asia servers, and this means there are some errors when looking at monthly stats especially if you play in a different time zone to the one blizzard uses.\n.

I have found a number of games where the Opponent Class is not saved (in the decks xml file it is an empty listing instead of, say, Hunter).\nFor these games, if I try to edit the game data, it crashes HDT every time.\nI tried to upload a crash report but it said this requires write permission to this repository.\n. That's great to know. Thanks!\nWhen correcting class and name, for games that cant be identified (maybe some brawl/none games for instance), you maybe could add a comment to the note section of the game, to let people find them and decide what to do with them.\n. For season recap. you need to account for difference between time zone of the computer running HDT/HS, and the timezone of the server.\nI play in both NA and EU, and HDT considers games that I play after this post, in NA (after midnight, 1st December) to be in the December season, when they are actually in the November season until 8AM local time. But games I play now in the EU server are actually in the December season. However, the December season starts at 11PM on 30th November, in my time zone, so if if I played games between 11 and midnight, it would consider them as part of the November season...\nTime zones are tricky!\n. Are you talking about the decklist overlay that shows while you are playing games?\nThat doesn't distinguish between golden and non-golden. I don't know why you'd need that information. With the overlay, all you need to know are what cards remain in your deck for their stats and powers, not whether they are golden or not.\n. I've noticed this with parentheses too. i remember it failing with another character too, cant remember what it was - maybe a \"+\".\nThe export shouldn't fail when the name isn't read properly. It should just enter what the name is detected as, without the failing characters, and then continue with the export.\n. Great idea.\n. If it happens again and I notice it immediately, I'll save the logs. But I tend not to notice it when it happens, but only notice it later. For instance, this suggestion was prompted by looking at the stats of a deck I've only played on the EU server, and I noticed the first 2 games, played at the start of february, were listed as being the asia server.\n(I checked the replays to make sure the games were assigned to the correrct deck, and confirmed they couldnt have been played on Asia because i dont have the cards there.)\nWhat I suspect may be happening is that it is using the last detected server, because I probably opened asia up earlier that day to check quests.\nAlso, it's a pain having to manually correct these one by one. It would be great to have an ability to edit games in bulk - e.g. select three games, change server in all 3 at once.\n. Another confirmation here: beta is working fine for me.\n. I find it is a bit flaky, sometimes it works okay, other times it misses out cards below a certain mana cost (not always the same).\nTry this - with HDT open, go to your collection, click on druid, then flip through your entire collection, one page at a time, till you reach the end.\nThen back out to the main menu. Then do what it says to import a collection: open collection, open deck, click back and again to the main menu, then do the import.\nSee how that works.\n. The deck recipes are all listed on hearthpwn, you can import them from there easily enough. That's what I did.\n.

I think they will be OK - just add a note into changelog or into readme and they will be happy. :)\n. +1 - I like this idea\n. @Epix37 could you add this feature with #465 465?\n. @Epix37 - it is already done, am I right?\n. Not bad idea - for example F2-F12 keys - turn on/off the feature\n. +1, it would be awesome. One problem - it needs to be reseted every new season\n. I can help you with Czech translation (Czech Republic)\n. It freezes even when HS is not running\n. No update available but it freezes - it is shorter but there is a freeze\nEDIT: with latest version it is not freezing so often, maybe in every 3-5 deck tracker start\n. good suggestion... same for counterspell secret when you play a spell card and nothing happens... or for vaporize\n. It would be nice to add a tag automatically\n. really waste of time and resources... sorry but you are a player and you should make a decision\n. useless feature\n. useless feature\n. But this is one of them :) is it really hard to push a print screen button after game? And moreover it is not realiable way how to prove anything\n. But this is one of them :) is it really hard to push a print screen button after game? And moreover it is not realiable way how to prove anything\n. I can confirm it... no highlight\n. Is it really useful? In almost 99% time you get opponnent which is on the same rank as you (or +-1). \n@Epix37 - what do you think? If it is possible why not, but as I said above - I really wanna know my rank\n. @Herr-Sepp - really nice feature - could you improve it a little bit according to @Epix37 ideas? I am looking for this !\n. @Epix37 - I can confirm this - 2 days ago I played Nozdurmu in my game and the timer was 90sec instead of 15sec\n. @NightKev @Epix37 I have already reported this some time ago... with newer version I have this problem only sometimes and only for 2-3 sec when I start my deck tracker - I think it is becuase of autoupdate component and loading my decks. After that all is OK\n. @Epix37 - you have added region detection system for reseting max daily gold progress (100 g/day) - maybe you could add tagging for a region where the game was played.\n. Really nice idea, I dont think that all filters mentioned above would be added but some of them are really useful\n. @Epix37 @Sokhar I cannot reproduce it\n. @azeier - your idea is really nice but I think it would be really difficult to associate automatically\n. @Epix37 - should be fixed, at least I canoot reproduce it anymore\n. I dont think it should be supported by this app. It could bring more issues\n@Epix37 \n. @Epix37 - it is done, am I right?\n. I cannot reproduce it\n. +1\n. @Epix37 - it can be closed... we have it now :) thank you!\n. I have same problem... maybe is possible to adjust where i wanna show it (and own setting for hide/show)\n. is there any tooltip with a card shown?\n. it could bring more problems than advantages :( please focus on fixing bugs and adding features which were reported here :)\n. @Epix37 - I fully understand, I have coding like a hobby (I am a member of 3 free open source projects).\nFirst of all, it would be really good if you can delete issues which are not relevant - I can fix some issues which are mentioned here on GitHub but I must to know what is a valid or invalid report. Also milestones and sort issues into categories would be nice. We have there over 165 issues, I think that almost 40% are out of date or not complete useless bug reports.\nI really like your Deck Tracker and I am happy everytime when you release a new version with new features and bug fixes. \nEDIT: What about these 4 PRs which are not merged? I really like the ideas, maybe you can add them in your way\n. @Epix37 I agree with you, I dont see any point for this \n. Maybe just add red /orange border for discarted cards\n. It would be awesome!\nEDIT:\n@Epix37 - what about to improve it? Blue full circle when active, empty grey circle when disable?\n. +1 - priest is my favourite class :) \n. is it something similar to https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/pull/324 ?\n. OK, but it is a little bit confusing with mana crystals for HP and attack :( is there any idea how to make it better?\nI would suggest:\n- add a small icon (mana, hp, attack) before the text \"mana\"/\"health\"/\"attack\"\n- hide mana crystals for health/attack tab\n. I disagree. It looks really good with attack and heath icons... just add mana icosn for mana tab and it would be great\n. 100 people, 100 feelings :) It looks good for me, yes, there is a small problem with centering but better than mana crystals. Dont forget that there is a same problem in game in cards - attack and hp is not centered on the card. I vote for health/attack icons\n. @Epix37 what about to show only total dust value of all cards in your deck?\n. They wanna show how many dust they need for crafting missing cards - this is a little bit difficult to implement\nI just wanna show total value all deck\n. I like this :) it looks professional :)\n. @culinko @Epix37 \nThis is fixed right? At least when you disable interactivity this issue disappears\n. @Epix37 - issue persists on latest v0.13.0 \n. Any progress here? Really needed, it would save a lot of time for me and nerves\n. Nice, really nice!\n. It would be nice additon, but I think there are more important features :) \n. +1, really nice idea! Just one thing - add settings for this\n. Cannot reproduce :(\n. Cannot reproduce\n. @Epix37 - this can be added to wiki under plugins tab\n. it is OK :)\n. Is it really needed? Hero power is shown in HS, in HDT there is no need to know it, or is it?\n. I would like to see this in the next release :) My life in HS would be much easier :)\n. @Epix37 - this can be add as a separate counter next to the \"Total attack counter added in last version\". Graphic could be almost same\n. @Epix37 - I cannot confirm this... at least not with latest version\n. I can confirm this @Epix37 \n. this cannot be fixed, only if @Epix37 add a setting to hide/show elements in the game by clicking on them - something was introduced here by epix, unfortunately I cannot find this issue here\n. yeah, we need more stats... we have a really good and advanced tracker with many useful features but we need stats too!\n. @anonymous555 - I see, but we need more stats. I really like the way how they are shown here: http://hearthstonetracker.com/screenshots#\nAlso @Epix37 has already done some changes here #799 , it is a good starting point. I would like to you only all-in-one tracker with everything inside. Now we have really nice tracker with a plenty of features, only stats missing. With them it would be masterpiece!\n. @Epix37 - this is really nice! Good job!\nI would like to see total time for every deck/class I have been playing\n- is there any text (legend) on mouse hover?\n. Oh, now I see :)\nGood job, I am waiting to final release\n. I hope this will be implemented in v0.14.x... according to the commits. Thank you!\n. Perfect! Thank you again. I am looking forward to test it and I hope that you will add more features into this later ;)\n. It has been added here: #1625 #1622 \nSo in 0.12.3 you will have this option in the settings\n.

Yes, thats it :)\n. \n. I can confirm that... but it happens only sometimes (windows 10, 64bit)\n. @Epix37 - when you change speed to normal, it works fine\n. @Epix37 can be closed - all of these kind of issues are because of default settings used for exporting in HDT -> maybe there should be a lower speed selected by default\n.

Sync works fine, but you have to try it later\n. @culinko - I think this occurs only sometimes, because of HearthStats servers - they are overloaded sometimes :( \n. Today, it works fine. This is an issue with Hearthstats website - maybe they are overloaded, just wait one or two hours and try again\n. All win10 issues reported here are because of bad settings - set fullscreen + set lower speed in exporting. This fixed all problems fir me and my friends on Win 10\n. I am interested too :+1: \n. No, it is not fixed when I restart my HDT. Just finish the match, do not click anywhere and check your timer - it is counting\n. Yes! Exactly... it should be stopped automaticaly\n. There is a message in the top left corner sometimes when the match starts during cards selection... it is shown for about 3 sec, it is really difficult to take a screenshot\n. Yes, it shows that these XXX cards are missing in my deck, but they are in my deck and they are shown in the right panel. Also when I pick them or use, they are shadowed in this panel... it happens sometimes, maybe problem with sync between HDT and HS?\n. Auto select deck feature is enabled... anyway I also select this deck manualy before I go into queue\n. Yes, something like statistic for every season :)\n. OK, so it will be fixed with new stats for constructed :+1: \n. I agree with Epix in that case. It would be really time consuming. Anyway I see your point \n. use dropbox or hearthstats\n. You are right\n. +1\n. I think this is implemented via https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/85c4d5dbc5f48c80bc98567616b49c0f63e727f1\n. I dont agree - update is sometimes neccesary to follow changes in HS client to a proper logging.\nIt is 10 second job, not more\n. I can reproduce it... maybe something changed during versions\n. Really good idea! and useful!\n. maybe better to use one of the web solution - hearthpwn.com\nYou can see rating, comments and easily import into HS\n. maybe better to use one of the web solution - hearthpwn.com\nYou can see rating, comments and easily import into HS\n. @Epix37 - ok, I restarted HS tracker and dates are shown... maybe could you add autorefresh without reseting tracker?\n. @Epix37 - for unknown decks too? just assing the correct deck?\n. @culinko - I agree with you - just tags should be fine - constructed/arena/brawl/adventure?\nanother seoarated tags should be aggro/control/tempo\nMaybe what about deck version? Show it under the name\n. Just one thing, what about PvE (Adventure) icon? Maybe number of spells/minions? Just suggestion from hearthpwn\nI like your latest version, really good! -thank you\n. I think he means a hero power - sometimes useful. I have seen this suggestion (similiar) before.\n. Yes, thats it!\n. ",
    "MarioZG": "Just a comment that might clarify.Using  laptop that has touchscreen running win 8.1. When I try to export deck using touchscreen, i can reproduce this issue, When I use mouse to navigate in game, all works fine, It seems it's not OS related, purely touchscreen,\n. I didn't spend too much time with UI, just made it work and displayable. If you think this might get pulled to master, i'll tidy this up.  \nIn terms of -1 icon, that sums up my icon design skills :).  I cannot guarantee anything much better than that.\nAs for additional message box during save - i had button initially to increase version, but I always forgot to click it before save, hence message box.  Drop down idea might work, with 3 options as in dialog (Major/Minor/None). None by default,  and when deck is edited switch it to major.\n. I should have some time later today/tomorrow to tidy UI - keep an eye for new commits ;)\n. I have polished this a little bit.\n- now it's just major version (1,2,3....)\n- added tickbox next to save \"increase version\"\n- improved history panel display\n- changed layout of deck stats. Works same way as overall stats, with separate tab for game list\n- added deck version to deck's game list\n- fixed version issue in help and  try icon\n- -1 icon is still the same :), can't work the graphics... \nAdded, when moving game to other deck, game is assigned to current version of target deck\nFell free to do any UI changes - i believe you have better feel for it ;) \n. That looks much better now.\nI would move dropdown with version selection next to save button. They seems to belong together, since they are part of save process.\n. Exactly. Looks perfect.\n. In feature branch, there is [XmlIgnore] Attrbute on PlayerDeckVersion propert of GameStats class, which  means that deck version is not stored with game. All stats are assigned to v 1.0 when you start application.\n. If you save with same version, current deck is added to history. Fix: https://github.com/MarioZG/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/aa9557ced64205d3c114679e9d8609ca9ca801ae\n. What would be difference between save as.. and clone?\nAlso for delete version we need to choose what to do with games assigned to it. Also delete? Seems bit a waste of collected data.\nDon't get me wrong, but as not too experienced user, i think i would be honestly scared seeing all these options in save menu. Would give me few minutes of thinking what is correct choice for me.\nMaybe we just need \"set active version\" option, to choose which one can be exported to game and assign new games to?\nBTW: I think this is very close to crating \"git for decks\":) \n. As for delete version, maybe it shouldn't be possible if there are any games assigned to specific version? User can either move games manually and then delete, or keep it for historical reasons (which makes a lot of sense i believe)\n. There's bunch o nulll exceptions when you run application without deck selected - https://github.com/MarioZG/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/cdcca5f28eb918e656f6cdb295ff271725b0b7eb \n. Thanks. That's pushed now.\n. Seems to works nice! well done!\nOne question - at this moment it logs players rank. Can we choose to log opponent's rank?\n. You just won a\u2026. ?. Closing.\n. Latest version.\nI don\u2019t use sync at all.\nFix at my fork: https://github.com/MarioZG/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/f6d6e94d30e759e9c51055b14c3f1350f0786c32\n. 1) I found is useful in few decks where i need too know how many minion types and spells was left in deck. Just being lazy and cannot be asked to count :)  It sits below card list, space is not used anyway. Could do as option?\n2) I'll have another look - couldn't find it in logs :/\n. ",

For example, to emote, you now have to long press the hero to simulate a right click.  To unselect a card to play you have to do weird things like drag the card all the way to the bottom of the screen to cancel the action.  It would be nice if there was an option that could be checked that would then make the exporting function properly without having to use compatibility mode (you just have to click on one area, then click to another area).  I might have a go at coding a fix since I can reproduce the issue quite easily.\n. I modified the code in my local branch and it worked just fine.

I've taken a look at this a few times in the past, but unfortunately their site is very unfriendly towards page scraping in the sense that most of the markup is loaded via javascript after the initial html is loaded.  I'm not sure of a good way to do it, but maybe Epix has an idea?\n. I can confirm that this seems to be broken for me as well with the latest release.  It used to work fine, but all of a sudden in full screen mode, it will not work.\n. I don't know the code that well but this seems like it would require extensive changes.\nEither HDT would have to know all of the cards you own, or you would manually have to \"mark\" them on a per deck basis.  I know there are websites around there that do keep track of your cards and provide similar functionality to what you're asking for, so it might easier to use one of those.\nBut who knows, epix is amazing, so maybe it's easier than I envisioned :)\n.

Maybe at the bottom, near the buttons but on the right side.\nThe following feedbacks are just litte layout details but maybe you want a feedback about those as well.\nIn the stats window I'd write \"Deck\" rather than \"Current Deck\" so that it doesn't seems like if there are both \"Current\" and \"Deck\" tabs.\nAlso, I think there is enough space to put the games below the second table in the \"Overall\" tab.\nI'd put it there and remove \"Stats\" and \"Game\" tabs.\nIn the big table, when a field is empty, I'd write \"-\" rather than \"-%\".\nEventually, I'd put the games filter after the note one.\n. > > If, for example, I'm playing an Arena game without a selected deck I can't look at one of my decks list and/or stats because, if I click it, it will change the deck that's loaded on the overlay and used for the current game.\n\nThat's just how it works though, not sure what I could reasonably do about that.\n\nI know but I wanted to write that anyways.\n\n\nWhen I don't use a deck, I don't think there is the need to show my win rate on top of my deck.\n\nMakes sense, changed that.\n\nHowever I'm not sure about that part.\nMaybe showing the overall win rate with the class you are using could be fine.\nThe same for the opponent, respectively.\n~~If you remove it, just don't cut the opponent class together with the win rate.~~\n. I was writing that to tell you to keep the opponent class but I removed that part and added a line to my second message.\n\nIf you remove it, just don't cut the opponent class together with the win rate.\n\nBy the way, I agree.\n. Yes, I mean that, without the numbers.\nBy the way, it's fine without.\nIt isn't really needed since you can see your opponent class looking at the battlefield.\nSince it is there just to say that the win rate is related to that class, there is no need to keep it when the numbers aren't there.\n. > - Add more filter (e.g. class)\nYou could consider to add a filter for the opponent class as well.\n\n\nApply decks > sort/filter to stats (?)\n\n\nThat question mark...\nBasically, when we are playing with a deck, we see our win rate based on every game recorded.\nThe win rate should be based on some filters. Maybe the same filters you use in the Stats > Deck tab but you could also add other filters somewhere else.\nAlso, I think the only filter really needed by this function is the timeframe one. Maybe the mode one as well. By the way, other filters won't be bad to be available.\nI forgot I said this in #403 already, if you mean the same thing I do.\n. > - Change time filters to \"this week/month/year\"\nWhat do you think about the following code?\nC#\nvar timeFrame = DateTime.Now.Date;\nswitch(comboboxString)\n    {\n    case \"Today\":\n        break;\n    case \"From Yesterday\":\n        timeFrame -= new TimeSpan(1, 0, 0, 0);\n        break;\n    case \"This Week\":\n        timeFrame -= new TimeSpan(timeFrame.DayOfWeek, 0, 0, 0);\n        break;\n    case \"This Month\":\n        timeFrame -= new TimeSpan(timeFrame.Day, 0, 0, 0);\n        break;\n    case \"This Year\":\n        timeFrame -= new TimeSpan(timeFrame.DayOfYear, 0, 0, 0);\n        break;\n    case \"All Time\":\n        timeFrame = new DateTime();\n        break;\n    }\nI added a new filter as well but I don't know what could be a good name to represent it.\nIt is useful when you play around 00:00.\n. > - Last 24th (instead of from yesterday maybe?)\nYes, \"Last 24 Hours\" looks better.\n\n\nPrevious week\n\n\nInteresting addition.\nShould it be \"Previous Week\" or \"Last 7 Days\"?\nMaybe both.\n\n\nPrevious month\n\n\nSame as previous one.\nYou could add similar filters for the years as well, even if they won't be that useful.\n. Nice. I really needed some of them.\n\nOookay, that was quite a bit more annoying than I expected it to be :).\n\nDeep down you know it was fun.\n\nIn hindsight.. start and end datepicker would have been a lot easier. But I always hate fiddling around with datepickers, so that's that.\n\nI guessed you didn't like them so I didn't even suggest that alternative.\n. About decks, I think I did a bit of confusion.\nI was talking about something similar to  #314.\nCheck my post there.\nAbout win rates, you did it already.\nI was just asking to hide them like it is now when you play without a deck.\n. If you use the card age option, any card with a zero on it but without an M has been kept.\nIt's true that, when you don't use the card age option, you'll lack that information.\n. You gain information only if you play with the card age option disabled.\nHowever, since there is this possibility, I agree with you.\n. I had got it. You didn't need to write all that text.\nI just wanted to point that detail out.\n. > Switching out the marks might be confusing (as you might know, even buying the correct packs isn't easy!).\nI agree the mulligan mark should stay.\n\nHow about just keeping the mulliganed mark and adding the kept mark? \n\nThis is what I was aiming for.\nThis way, even if the card age option is disabled, you can get what's being kept or mulliganed.\n\nAlso, I think you can't redraw your mulliganed cards? If that's the case there's still some value to knowing which ones are mulliganed since they have a higher probability of being good.\n\nConfirmed. You can't draw mulliganed cards again.\nAs Zeriyah, Blizzard's Community Manager, said on Blizzard forums:\n\nYou cannot get back the same card you just mulliganed. You can get back a card you mulliganed as your first draw, and you can mulligan into a second copy of a card you have in your deck, but you cannot get back the same card you just mulliganed back into your opening hand. The card you mulligan are indeed still set aside, new cards are drawn from the deck, and the mulliganed cards are shuffled back into the deck.\nIf there are instances where mulligans are not functioning as stated above, those can be considered bugs and should be reported on the Bug Report Forums with as much information as you can provide.\n\nEven if the official version confirms you can't draw the same card again after a mulligan, there have been some reported cases where it was clearly not working as intended.\nBack to your post, the card pool is made up of 30 card and, when mulliganing, you can set aside up to 3 cards (4 if you get The Coin). Even if slighty higher, the chance to get a good card after a mulligan isn't that different from the chance to get a good card in your hand before it.\nWhen mulliganing, the chance to get a good card increases by up to 0.52%.\nSince a slighty increase like this isn't relevant, as @Core-Xii said, a kept card is assumed to be good for the current matchup but a mulliganed card is just a random one.\n. Well done.\n. There is nothing else you need.\n. I've added the full crash report about the second attemp:\nhttp://pastebin.com/DpNqVES1\n. I did it from the Overall tab.\nI forgot to write that.\nHere is the crash report about the first attemp:\nhttp://pastebin.com/ehxwtRLf\n. The game had no game assigned since I was filtering the ones without deck.\nTo be clear, it isn't related to the latest update since I did it afterwards.\n. I did a test.\nI moved the game to a deck and then tried to delete the game. It crashed again.\n. Yes, it's working now.\n. I've got a log about this:\nhttp://pastebin.com/tQhrkGSY\n. I was going to get that too but the game crashed after the game so I've lost it.\n. For example, you could toggle the \"Hide (completely)\" check box that's in Options > General with a key event. Pressing the chosen key, the check box will change status (if checked, uncheck it; if unchecked, check it).\n. Nice feature.\n\na) could I clarify the explanation somehow?\n\nThe explanation is pretty clear.\nYou could add a check box labeled \"Don't show this again\" and make it unchecked by default.\n\nb) does this actually work reliably?\n\nI tried it once and it worked well.\nYou should add the Arena tag to the deck instead of the Constructed one.\nTo avoid naming issues, add the year to the date and use the 24 hours format when you add time and data in the deck name.\n. In the Overall tab, when the \"Show as percent\" check box is checked it should show the percentage of the games you have played against a given hero, when not it should show the number of games you have played against that given hero.\nAlso, I'd add that check box in the Deck tab as well.\n. Sure. I was just clarifing that, since there is that check box, it could show both percentage (when checked) and number (when unchecked) of games played.\n. No, let me clarify. I'm suggesting to add a new row to each table to show those values.\n. No problem.\n. I could help you with the Italian translation.\n. So, when a card is marked with an S you want to show the source of the \"stolen\" card and when it's marked with an R you want to show the returned card itself, right?\n. I agree. It's difficult to notice the cards quantity up there.\nIt should be somewhere near the mana curve graph.\n. That's a good place too but, since you can save uncomplete decks, I think it's a little better to have it near the mana curve graph.\n. Good idea.\n. I've played 5-6 games in the last 1-2 hours but I see only two records in the Stats.\nIt seems like there is only one record for each class/deck I've used.\nHere is the log:\nhttp://pastebin.com/6XPt0k9i\n. Ok.\nI've changed the ClearLogFileAfterGame string from false to true during a game (Ranked) and it didn't get recorded but the next one (Arena) did.\n. I should have figured that out.\nToo late. I'm on version 0.7.4 now.\nAnyways, check my first post on this issue again.\nI edited it because it wasn't describing the situation in the right way.\nMaybe this problem is related to class/deck switching, if even possible.\n. Yes, I did it already.\nThank you.\n. I see it as something similar to the \"Alert at X seconds\". Of course you have the timer on the screen, but the sound warning is good to have.\nIn this case, we have the stats but they are in another window. I could open that window after some games to see how I'm doing but a warning would be good to have.\nFurthermore, it would be a reminder for the decision to take a break after some losses.\nI'd like to have the option to enable/disable it.\n. I don't think that the attemp to predict part of the opponent deck is a big problem.\nWe try to predict the opponent deck with our mind already.\nWhen we are playing against Warrior, for example, at the start of the game we assume it is Control Warrior because it is more popular than other Warrior decks. The software should do this.\nTo do this, we just need to be able to build a deck or a part of a deck for each class. We don't need a detection feature. The list we preared will be loaded. If it is wrong (e.g. when loading Zoo core against Handlock or when we meet a less popular deck), we'll just ignore it while playing. We could also switch to another list or deactivate the function somehow.\n. As you wish.\n. I see.\nHow could it fail?\nHow do you detect it? Do you look for a particular log line?\n. I see.\nHow could it fail?\nHow do you detect it? Do you look for a particular log line?\n. For example, you could let it show a message when the screenshot has been successfully taken.\nEvery time a game ends, we'll just need to wait for that message and then click (like we do already) to proceed.\n.

Did you play that game from the beginning up to the moment you took the screenshot?\nI ask it because those numbers will always mess up when reconnecting to a previous game for how they are handled by the game itself.\n@Epix37, maybe they changed something about this after Goblins vs Gnomes came out. I've noticed that sometimes I see my opponent's name even after a disconnection. Check it.\nIf that's true, there is a chance to fix this issue, even if it isn't what he was trying to say, maybe.\n. > 2) I don't know of a way to tell which asset unload belongs to the player and which to the opponent.\nYou could check if they are loaded every time in the same order.\n. > One question - at this moment it logs players rank. Can we choose to log opponent's rank?\nRight. They are different sometimes.\n. > What do you guys think about the general idea? (it's not done)\nI like the way it is currently but I'll tell you my opinion about this version anyways.\n\n\nEasier to switch between classes\n\n\nDid you consider to put the bar to select classes horizontally, above the list?\n\n\nAllows to display multiple (selected) classes\n\n\nI think it looks better if you don't make the icons bigger when they aren't selected.\n\n\nWin% of class gets lost (I don't really want to put that on the icons) but you can see that in stats anyway.\n\n\nYou could add percetages and, why not, win-loss numbers below each icon or, if you keep it vertical, on their side.\nAt the end of each deck line, you should add the win-loss numbers as well, even if you don't end up releasing this new layout.\n. @Epix37, you could keep them uppercase on the tracker but make them\nlowercase when exporting to Hearthstone.\n\nIl 09/feb/2015 16:45 \"Jack Whitehead\" notifications@github.com ha scritto:\nDefinite improvement but not sure about the ALLCAPS.

That's the only way I can think of at the moment.\n\nI know but the issue seems different.\nI've just noticed those games don't belong to the Arena they are associated to.\nSome are even from the wrong class. I can see it from the cards played in the game history.\nThey have been linked to them somehow with the latest update, maybe.\nThe games causing this issue are all dated between 26 and 28 January 2015, except one that's dated 18 December 2014.\nCan you figure out how can it be?\nMaybe something related to deck names management.\n. I guess the decks haven't been labeled as Arena decks since there were those games associated to them.\nI'm manually changing the values since there were only 8 affected games.\nI still don't get why they weren't labeled as Arena games.\n. > Because they have matches with mode \"None\" associated with them. A \"old\" deck is only considered an arena deck if it has exclusively arena matches on it.\nYes, I've got that part but why there are games not related to a deck linked to it?\n. > What do you mean not related to a deck?\nFor example, there is a Druid deck named \"Arena 14-01 16:00\" that contains 8 games.\n5 of them are dated 14 January and they are, in order, 2 wins and 3 losses.\n3 of them were labeled as \"None\", don't have opponent's names and are dated 27 Jaunary.\n. > So the question is how the games got in there in the first place?\n\nNo idea :).Could be some weird hearthstats syncing issue with the deck being considered constructed..? not sure. The date doesn't make much sense to me.\n\nSyncing is off.\nIt's clear that the last 3 games don't belong to that Arena run since the first 5 games make it a 2-3 run, so it's over.\nHow could it be that those games have the wrong deck set?\n. > I don't know. Maybe you had the deck selected at some point.\nIt could be.\n\nNot really an important issue if it's not happening continously IMO.\n\nOf course.\nI was just trying to understand what happened.\n. Ok, I've deleted those strange games and changed deck to Arena mode manually.\n\nThere is another issue. When a wrong deck is detected and there is one of those new \"filters\" up (e.g. Arena), you can't chose a deck that's from the other category (e.g. Constructed) because it won't be listed in the window appearing.\n\nWhat about this?\n. > Suggestion: when you select a game in the Stats --> Overall --> Games list, the deck that game was played with becomes selected in HDT.\nI think adding a button to load the deck in the main window will be a good idea.\n. Sometimes I need to open a different deck while playing. The same is true\nfor the stats.\nSelecting another deck shouldn't change the one on the overlay\nautomatically. There should be a button to load it manually.\nIf you make it change automatically when looking at the stats as well, we\ncouldn't select a game record while playing to avoid loading another deck\non the overlay.\nYou could just say it isn't needed to do those things while playing but I\nthink it's a good improvement.\n\nThat would work, but I think it's smoother if it happens automatically.\nYou can always go back to the deck you were in first by clicking a game you\nplayed with that deck.\nA supplementary suggestion: have the hovertext when you hover over a deck\ngame show the name of the deck used.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. I know it's different but it's related to it.\nThat's a different suggestion. I wasn't talking about while playing, but\nwhile browsing your game history.\nI agree, when in game, it would be nice to change decks in HDT without it\naffecting the overlay.\nI'm not sure how best that would be to implement. When HDT doesn't detect\na deck correctly, you have to select it manually to get it displayed in the\noverlay.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Actually I decided to open this issue just for that, then I added the rest.\nI like the filter by range of ranks idea. It'd be nice to see the win\npercentages of a deck within certain brackets of opponent's rank.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. What about showing the notes on the left of the mana curve graph?\nI don't think it's a problem not to see 3 decks without scrolling down.\n. Confirmed.\n. Could it be related to the fact I'm opening the friend list and/or the chat?\nIf yes, you should check both the medal and the game start (or end, whichever is better).\n\nWhat do you think?\n. Interesting idea.\nYou could add a window that's showed when there is a possible error in the\nRank detection. In this window, the user should confirm a Rank, detected or\ncalculated from previous game, and/or modify it.\n\nFor a completely different way of doing it, why not just let the user input their current Rank and stars and then calculate their subsequent ranks based on wins, losses, etc. I'm going to guess that it's quite possible to program things like win streaks and such?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. > I am all for the automatic rank calculation. It could also calculate automatically your next season's starting rank, depending at which rank you've ended in the previous season.\n\nFor the start of a new season conversion, you could use my pseudocode:\nC\nint BonusStars = 25 - OldRank;\nIf BonusStars <= 10 Then\n  {\n    NewRank = RoundUp (26 - (BonusStars / 2));\n    If BonusStars Mod 2 = 0 Then\n      NewStars = 1\n    Else\n      NewStars = 2;\n  }\nElse\n  {\n    NewRank = RoundUp (26 - 5 - ((BonusStars - 10)/ 3));\n    If (BonusStars + 1) Mod 3 = 0 Then\n      NewStars = 1\n    Else If\n      BonusStars Mod 3 = 0 NewStars = 2\n    Else\n      NewStars = 3;\n  }\n\nCurrently, the tracker attaches your pre-match rank to the game, but when you rank up or down, it will sometimes attach the newly achieved (post-match) rank. I've checked the logs and it happens because the post-match rank asset is sometimes unloaded second and sometimes first. Same happens if your opponent has different rank, it assigns you his rank sometimes.\n\nWe should also consider that the tracker can't see the difference between, for example, Rank 5 with 5 stars and Rank 4 without stars, even if they are actually the same Rank.\n. What about disabling the interface, rather than hiding it, when we choose to hide the overlay in Spectator mode?\nThis way the window for a wrong deck detection should't appear.\n. > What do you mean by disabling?\nWhen we choose to hide, I think the software is still doing the same work but we can't see it on the overlay. I guess it since it still detects wrong decks.\nInstead, if I chose to hide, the software shouldn't load the same things and do the same operations since I won't see them.\nI don't know if my explanation is clear.\n\n(This is actually what I've been working on for the past hour)\nSpectator mode detection is fixed (this also resulted in notedialog / deck detection behaving inproperly).\n\nNice.\n\nGame result detection still has issues but I think most people won't care about recording spectator game stats anyway.\n\nWhat do you mean? Is it related to the \"Record Spectator\" check box?\nDoes it record when check? What happens when not checked?\n. > How would that be faster to read?\nBecause each line will have 2 values at the end, on the same line, rather than 2 values on 2 different lines.\nIf I have 2-3 decks for each class, the color will help me to \"align\" the numbers but, if I have more, it will be difficult to read without looking insistently.\n. > I think it's fine the way it is.\nI don't. :D\nNevermind.\n. You could add it as a separate element, like the rest, so that we could\nenable or disable it.\nBut this won't be enough.\nYou should also create a special overlay configuration, that could be\nchosen checking an option, and put it in place of the current \"Hide in\nmenu\" or as a new option (e.g. \"Hide in menu, keep 3 wins counter\") to keep\nboth.\n\nThere is no way around that.\nI could possibly add it to the tracker ui somewhere.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Nice.\n. > I would say this is only makes sense for discarding when the cards don't match?\nA zero turn game is just that and shouldn't need this imo.\n\nYou are right.\nWell done.\n. I think that when the note dialog popups, it doesn't have focus.\nI have to click on it every time to be able to write.\n. @Epix37, could you add a \"Cancel\" button and a \"Retry\" button so we could cancel the import or update of a given deck and try again?\nIt could be useful in those cases.\n. Pretty interesting.\n. I think a table for deck, class and overall respectively would be fine.\nThe table should have:\n- number of wins in the first column;\n- classes in the first row;\n- win rates in the cells;\n- overall win rates in the last column;\n- average win rates by class in the last row.\nA graph would be really good.\n. > Do you like any of the button placements? What/how would you change it? (I'm not entirely happy with any of those yet)\nPlacing the button there doesn't look nice.\nI would opt for a mouse listener (e.g. double click) instead.\n\nAn alternative would maybe be to place a universal \"use\" button somewhere.\n\nYou could add a new option called Use (or Active) in the Deck men\u00f9.\n\nShould there be a global indicator of what deck is currently set active? The decklist on the right will not always represent the active deck now. (I tried placing a deck-item outside of the picker to indicate the active one, didn't really look any good)\n\nSomething similar to the notes indicator would be nice (e.g. the letter A in a circle, as Active).\n. > The problem with setting the active deck via context menu or doubleclick (which currently open edit, I don't like changing that), is that it's not at all intuitive. Someone who never used the the app would probably have difficulty trying to figure out how it works. An obvious \"use this one\"-button is a lot clearer.\nI see.\nThen go for a button.\nA button for each deck in the picker looks bad.\nYou could place it above or below the deck list.\n\nFor the indicator I was thinking about something that's visible regardless of how the decklist is filtered/scrolled. A indicator similar to the notes one adds nothing new (it's bold already).\n\nWhat do you think about adding a text line showing the selected deck somewhere?\nFor example: \"Using: Handlock\".\nYou could place it near the button.\n. > I can add/remove tags without any problems with both quick set tag and edit tags (if by labels you mean tags).\nYes, I meant tags.\nI can remove tags as well, except for those 2 tags. They are bugged somehow.\n\nIf you are importing the Arena decks from the game, it won't give any tags to the decks in the next tracker version when you uncheck \"tag decks on import\". This one got fixed already.\n\nOkay.\nI'm importing the Arena deck from the game ~~and I have that option enabled.~~ but that option is disabled.\nI've just seen it to be sure.\n. Some of my Arena decks still have the Arena tag, but I don't have that tag in my list.\nI've just used a workaround to fix the problem: add a new tag and remove it.\n. @culinko, the case described by @GiggliG is exactly what made me suggest this feature.\n. Confirmed.\nI've just noticed the bug and I was going to report it.\n. @Epix37, I suggest you to add two buttons somewhere in the options to manually add and remove a victory to the counter respectively.\n. > Works for me.\nI've tried many times, even changing the respective value in the config.xml, but it didn't work properly.\nSometimes it were loading, sometimes not.\nI did another try and now it's loading fine.\nI don't know how it's possible.\n\nDo you use the current version?\n\nYes, version 0.10.16.\n. > Works for me.\nI've tried many times, even changing the respective value in the config.xml, but it didn't work properly.\nSometimes it were loading, sometimes not.\nI did another try and now it's loading fine.\nI don't know how it's possible.\n\nDo you use the current version?\n\nYes, version 0.10.16.\n. > So... does work?\nNo, I still have the same issue.\n. > So... does work?\nNo, I still have the same issue.\n. It's working again, somehow.\nIl 07/set/2015 10:40, \"Epix\" notifications@github.com ha scritto:\n\nSo... does work?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/1386#issuecomment-138237063\n.\n. > For now you can turn it on again by setting  in the config to -1.\n\nWhen I've seen there were the value 7, I didn't know which value to set to enable it again.\nThanks. \n. In case you need some ideas, see my old issue about this topic: #586.\n. > Exporting as/to what specifically?\nI had noticed the problem using those:\n- Export > Copy IDs to Clipboard\n- Export >  Copy Names to Clipboard\nThis one should have the same issue:\n- Export > Save as XML\n. > Works fine for me.\nOk.\n\nAre you maybe only cloning the latest version but stats are on older ones?\n\nMaybe.\nI don't remember.\n. At the turn 3 I forced a disconnection to get the following logs.\nI noticed that as soon as the game ended the reconnection, the overlay changed from game version to menu version because the Gold progress bar was visible during the rest of the match.\nAfter some time I used the hotkeys to call a deck reset, but it just forced the note dialog to pop up.\nNothing else happened.\nI tried also to disable the automatic deck selection, change the deck manually and activate the no deck mode, but it didn't work. I just got the note dialog again and again.\nAt the end, in the stats window, I've got a game with the correct duration and the note I wrote in the latest note dialog.\nCalling the latest replay, though, the history was the following:\n\nTurn 3\nPlayer\nDraw: Azure Drake\nDraw: Sludge Belcher\nDraw: Loatheb\nDraw: Mad Scientist\nPlay: Mad Scientist\nAttack: Entity 24\nDraw: Frostbolt\nDraw: Frostbolt\nOpponent\nDraw: Unstable Portal\nPlay: Unstable Portal\nPlayer\nPlay: Fireblast (Hero Power)\nPlay: Fireblast (Hero Power)\n\nThose replay information are wrong.\nAs you can see from the logs, I played Mad Scientist on my turn 2 and used Fireblast on my turn 3.\nAdditionally, it's impossible a player used Hero Power 2 times in the same turn.\nLog:\nhttp://pastebin.com/8jQ7sKVc\nPower.log:\nhttp://pastebin.com/b1jZwwSd\nhttp://pastebin.com/XQZxwAc5\nNet.log:\nhttp://pastebin.com/8gATxWKs\nReplay.hdtreplay:\nhttp://tempsend.com/07CB6DCEB5\n. > Added the cancel button.\nNice.\n\nNot too sure on the rest though. E.g. if you set the default operation to 'save', you would have to look for an option to be able to upload it. The 'upload' default behaviour you describe is another example of this just not working well. Don't I think this is a good idea.\n\nIf I click Save to store a screenshot in a folder, it means I don't want to update it, that I will do it manually or using a different site.\nEven if you don't want to do what I said about the upload, I think it would still be a good idea to let us set Save as a default operation to save the screenshots in a given path. Save & Upload and Upload will stay the same.\nJust add a checkbox in the same window (e.g \"Remember this selection.\") and another one in the options so that users can disable it when they change mind.\n\nI have nothing against being able to set an imgur account, but it's not something I have time to do. If anyone wants to PR - feel free.\n\nI know, I know.\n. Some decks have that issue, and it happens every time they load on the overlay or when I export them in game.\n. A Constructed deck that has 3 minor versions and, if I don't remember wrong, the first version has been created using the cloning function from the last version of another deck that I've then deleted.\nI named it in a different way when I created it and then edited the name.\nThe original name is used on the overlay and when exporting it.\nThe new name is used in the tracker.\nIf I edit the name, the original name doesn't change.\n. Basically when you rename a deck you edit a field but when you load the name in order to show it on the overlay or when exporting you load a different field.\n. When I tried at 60 ms it clicked the button that suggests cards. Check it.\n. > Added the missing pack option. Thanks.\nYou are welcome.\n\nSource on the 3rd pack? \n\nI don't have, that's why I said I can't confirm that, but someone has got a second pack at as low as 3-3.\n. > yeah, that's exactly what the patch notes say. I doubt you can get a 3rd pack.\nYou are right. I did a wrong assumption.\n. Nice idea, but keep it optional, please.\n. I have some ideas about things to add:\n- Format: based on cards in it, show if the deck is Standard legal or not;\n- Sets: as you do in the tracker, show an icon for each cards set needed to build it;\n- Rank: show the best Rank you have reached with that deck version;\n- Wins/Losses (Percentage): show how many games you have won and lost, win rate included.\n\n@Elitesparkle why would you want it optional out of interest, specifically when would the extra info interfere with the way you use the screenshot?\n\nSometimes you don't need to show too many information (e.g. you don't know the deck author, you didn't give a name to your new deck yet, you don't want to show your Rank and/or win rate).\n.

    "rrwoods": "Bump!\nI'd like this as well.\n. I was wondering about this as well.  Is there some way of determining which cards the arena is offering you, so that you could use a drafting assistant without having to manually type the cards?\nI'd be willing to work on an extension to do such a thing (I think HearthArena has an API, and if not I'd be willing to open a dialogue with them about it as well), but I don't know if there's a way to get what we want.  The above poster mentioned ArenaValue using OCR to determine the cards it's offering you; how reliable is this?\n. I have grand visions for how HearthArena integration would look and function (automatic deck creation and naming, deck coverage overlays during drafting) and I'd be totally on top of writing an extension or contributing to the project directly -- IF we could find some way of figuring the picks without examining memory or traffic.\n. As was pointed out on that thread, you can only work on so much a time when you have so few developers.  When you asked the question before, HA was still very much in the phase of having the recommendations solidified -- the algorithm is the most important part, and if it isn't right then it's not doing its job.  (If the latest coop stream is any indication, the algorithm still has a lot of work to be done on it, but it's pretty solid.)\nNow I get the impression the HA guys have a little more time to work on nice-to-haves.\n. -- Actually, come to think of it, making the version you go back to be configurable would be sweet; I often make extremely minor changes to a deck that I don't think I'd want to erase the win % stats.\n. My bad!  I'll close this.\n. In the same game, I eventually drew the jousted card, and the tracker went nuts -- it continuously did the following, with about a 2-5 second pause between each bullet point:\n- the entire overlay disappears\n- the overlay reappears, in a \"fresh\" state (my decklist has all 30 cards normally rendered, my opponent's playlist is empty)\n- the overlay \"draws\"/\"plays\" all the cards that were played in the game to this point (all the cards in my hand turn orange, their playlist accurately reflects what they've played, PLUS my jousted card is gone from the deck and theirs is in the playlist)\n- repeat from step 1.\nThe game recorded the result correctly.\n.

Send all feedback and issues to the plugins own page.\n@Epix37 this can probably be closed now\n. There is an icon set available at http://game-icons.net/ under CC BY 3.0 in SVG and PNG. Until someone comes forward to do some custom icons, they are not bad. There's lots of possible of options, I've just picked out a few that might be useful.\n\nhttp://game-icons.net/lorc/originals/wood-axe.html\nhttp://game-icons.net/lorc/originals/skull-crack.html\nhttp://game-icons.net/lorc/originals/ace.html\nhttp://game-icons.net/lorc/originals/poker-hand.html\nhttp://game-icons.net/lorc/originals/prayer.html\nhttp://game-icons.net/lorc/originals/cowled.html\nhttp://game-icons.net/lorc/originals/pawn.html\nhttp://game-icons.net/felbrigg/arrows/thrust.html\nhttp://game-icons.net/lorc/originals/lob-arrow.html\nhttp://game-icons.net/lorc/originals/uncertainty.html\nhttp://game-icons.net/willdabeast/deviations/orb-wand.html\nhttp://game-icons.net/lorc/originals/pirate-grave.html\n. I think plugins are a great idea, it will really help you to concentrate on the core functionality. I've already got some ideas, have to go look at the code.\n. I've been trying out the plugin interface with a quick implementation of @GiggliG stats to csv idea. It all seems to work great. I can't think of any other events at the moment, you seem to have the relevant ones covered. As regards public vs internal nothing jumps out at me yet, but I didn't really look that close :smile:\nI do like the menu item or toolbar idea. The plugins menu item sounds best, otherwise the menu bar will get out of hand. It will make the plugins functionality more accessible too.\n. The debug window could be very useful, great feature.\n. The plugin functionality is looking good. I have a couple of requests/suggestions:\n- Could you add a wrapper method in Helper for User32.GetHearthstoneRect(), so it can be accessed from a plugin. It would make using Helper.CaptureHearthstone() easier, and avoid some duplication.\n- Also, is it possible for the plugin code to check sub-directories of the /Plugins directory? The plugins could exist in their own directories, enabling them to have some configs or other libraries without interfering with others. (Unless there is a way of packing all the needed stuff into the one dll?).\n. @TehJumpingJawa If you are still interested in this I might have a solution. HearthstoneTracker has a companion add-in for Excel, it can be downloaded here. It allows you to get your stats into CSV format.\nIf you could use this and give me a sample of the CSV output, I could make an importer for HDT.\n. I tried OCR on an extension I've been working on for HDT to automatically create a list of a users card collection(s) (more on that another time). Similar to @Epix37 I had little success with it. I think the problem is the text on the cards isn't straight, and also the text size varies depending on the length of the card name.\nThe most reliable way I've seen of recognizing cards is a PHash (Perceptual Hash). I came across it on a Twitch Bot that uses it to recognize cards on stream, supposedly Trump uses/used it. It hasn't been updated in long time and its in C++, so I never bothered with. \nI had another look at it when I saw this thread and it turns out that HearthstoneTracker has an implementation of a pHash in C#. I've been playing around with his implementation using a simple console application and a small number of cards and it seems to work ok. Seeing that its Open Source shouldn't be any problem using it in HDT?. I'm working on getting all the card images from the web so I can create all the pHashes and do some proper testing. I'll report back soon :smile:\n. In theory, yes. If this method works as good as it seems (a big if at the moment). I've a feeling the gold cards would cause a problem though, because of the animations. Something to look at down the road maybe.\n. Thanks for letting us know. I've put some time in already, but I learned stuff so its not wasted. Looking forward to see what you come up with :+1:\n. @Epix37 I found some of the auto selection problems (#1122) are caused by having no deck active. I think it could be the IsUsingPremade check here.\n. @Epix37 I found some of the auto selection problems (#1122) are caused by having no deck active. I think it could be the IsUsingPremade check here.\n. I think a new icon would be cool, and a revamped splash screen too maybe. I like these two \n \nThey could also work inverted I think.\n. @jmundi1704 How did you move the log file to SSD, did you use a symlink?\n. AFAIK there are two log files, one where ever the OS is %LocalAppData%\\Blizzard\\Hearthstone\\Logs and one where Hearthstone is installed <Hearthstone_Install_Dir>\\Hearthstone_Data\\output_log.txt. Maybe you need to exclude them both?\n. Confirming this too.\nThe new hero's have new ids:\nJaina is CardID=HERO_08 and Medivh is CardID=HERO_08a\nso the tracker is treating them as unknown. Its easily fixed.\nI'm guessing @Epix37 is away atm, so I'm sure all the new patch problems will be sorted out when he returns.\n. @antoinejoerg if you still have this problem:\n@chucklu is right your Hearthstone path seems to be wrong. Go to options > tracker > settings and press Set Hearthstone Path point it to the Hearthstone install directory.\n. Same problem as #1091 and related to #1094. It's due to the new layout of the collection manager, the button that filters cards by set specifically. Basically, the first card search is now being blocked, making the first card in a deck be the first card in that hero's list (or the second one if you have gold prioritized).\nAnyway, I've submitted a fix for it.\n. Sorry, I didn't mean that you could apply the fix yourself. \nI meant I've submitted some code that will fix the problem, but it has to be approved and added to the code base. Then it should be available in the next update.\n. I came across something similar today too, in the left deck pane after an import from web.\n\nI wasn't able to reproduce it to see what might be causing it, though.\n. I think by default the auto selection feature will only select a deck if no other is possible. For example, if you have Face Hunter, Midrange Hunter and Hybrid Hunter in your deck list, when you play with one of those decks - it is difficult for the program to tell them apart.\nPersonally, I'd recommend just manually selecting your decks by pressing the USE text to the right of the deck name.\n.

I had another look at this, and it seems for auto-select to work you still need to have a deck set as Active. Maybe give that a try.\n. Well, all I know from the testing I have done is that with no deck set as Active (the same thing as selecting Use No Deck) the auto-select mechanism doesn't kick in. But, once any deck is set as Active then the auto-select works and will reset the deck based on whats been played. I'm sure this won't be the solution for everyone. I'm merely putting it out there in the hope that it may help some people, while we wait for a fix.\n.

If you can find the Iron Juggernaut game's replay file, you would then need to upload it to a site like Dropbox or Mega and post a link to it here.\n. It's hard to know what caused the problem. Hopefully, you will be able to recover the data from them. Backing up your current files and simply removing the \"__corrupted_\" might even work. If not you could upload the problem files somewhere and we could have a look at them.\n. There are some pictures here\n@riQQ  beat me to it :smile: \n. @mvordeme Does it only happen in Brawl exporting or also in constructed? What resolution are you running Hearthstone at and is it fullscreen or windowed? Probably same problem as #1162.\n. If they ever do break the constructed rules, your Arena/Brawl type is a good idea - it would be straightforward to implement too.\nIn the meantime, I made a test build of HDT with all the latest Pull Requests. So we can test out if the brawl game type works ok, amongst other things. You can get it over at my fork of HDT. If you give it a try, make sure to back up all you data first just in case :smile: \n. I just wanted to make sure if it was recording brawl games consistently. There might be a proper update soon, with Epix back :smiley:, can just wait until then.\n. I'm not sure if you want to turn off highlighting of the last drawn card, or if you want no deck tracking at all, just a static list of cards. You can turn off highlighting in options > overlay > player. If its just a card list you want, you can use Export > Screenshot function and display the resulting image on your stream. If you do use the screenshot function, you need to make sure the deck you want to screenshot is Selected and made Active (this is to avoid a possible crash, that should be fixed in next update).\n. It is a known issue (#1152), it should be fixed in the next update.\n. @Mistrelvous Can you post a couple of images of the collection manager, one with the zero mana on and one with it off (both taken from within Hearthstone using the Print Screen keyboard button).\nAlso:\n- What resolution is Hearthstone set at?\n- Have you tried exporting when in fullscreen?\n. I'm glad you got a solution. \nThe reason I asked for the screenshots was because the tracker takes a screenshot internally and tries to determine if the zero mana crystal is selected or not. I thought that process might be broken and was going to check it with your screenshots. If you could post them, I'd still like a look.\n. Yeah you're right, reddit is probably the best place.\n. Have you got the replays/logs?\n. Are you sure that log is from a Brawl game, its a game between a Paladin and Warrior?\n. Mmm, Ok.\nAre you using the latest version 0.10.11?\nCheck to see if Brawl is listed under the Record For section of options > tracker > stats, it is off by default. Although, it seems to be recording as none anyway so it can't be that.\n. I think something may still have gone wrong, because if it was off in the options then the games shouldn't have been recorded at all. In you screenshot the brawls were recorded as None. I'll test it out a bit.\n. This must be something to do with your specific setup. Here are some things you could do that might help us:\n1. What version of windows is it 7,8 or 10?\n2. What other programs are running when this happens?\n3. Download & run WinSpy and put Hearthstone in windowed mode, drag the icon from WinSpy to the Hearthstone window. Post a screenshot like the one below with the result.\n\n. Ok, so it wasn't what I thought. I do notice there is a green border around your HDT windows. Some quick googling tells me Comodo is running HDT in sandbox mode which must be limiting its actions. You'll have to do some research, but you should be able add an exception according to that article.\n. No problem. Glad we found out what it was in the end!\n. This is probably my most wanted feature too, I have been thinking about it for ages. \nI'd like to see something that improves on the hearthstone builder, with better filtering, plus card ratings and maybe synergies. Something like the Magic duels builder, but less fancy :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: \n\n\nIt will be a some time, before we see anything like it though :disappointed: \n. I agree that a cover flow style wouldn't be very practical. I do like Epix's general mock-up, I'd have the cards as a grid that you can page or scroll (like hearthstone). The idea of a single search/filter box is nice and ties in with the hearthstone search box. However, I think you would still need to have the filters on the left as they are easier to use for the average user (command line interfaces are scary for most!).\nWhen I get the card art and tool-tips sorted, Soon\u2122. I'll start on implementing something like this.\n. You can do this already, on the stats page select Overall and Stats, that gives the table below (you can use the Mode filter to show only arena):\n\n.

This happens with the unstable portals brawl too (#1190), so we can still test it now that they've changed it from webspinners.\nI've been trying to figure it out, without success. The GameStats object always seems to be correct, something must be happening in the loading/saving of the stats to file or the stats page?\nIt can vary wildly: \n- not saving the game at all,\n- saving it but with both players as Mage,\n- even saving the game correctly with the right heros, but its displayed on the stats page as Mage vs Mage (something to do with VerifiedHeros not sure how that works).\n. Yeah, it wouldn't be worth the effort to get all the brawl stuff working. I'll have another look at the hero thing, see if I can fix that at least.\n. @GaryKing definitely problems with Webspinner and Unstable Portal brawls (#1489)\n. Some discussion about this at #1489.\nThe actual games seem to be being recorded correctly, something is happening when they are saved to file and/or loaded to the stats screen. \n. Ok so I haven't tried this, but I see no reason why it wouldn't work.\n1. Create a folder in your dropbox directory for your tracker data.\n2. Go to Options > Tracker > Settings and press Set Data Path, then select the folder you just created.\n3.

To add my two cents. I like the idea of an enum for the rarity, but this does seem to be an overly complicated way of doing it.\nAs a side note, it is generally a good idea to keep the number of commits in a pull request small and clear. You can squash your local commits using git rebase, see this article.

This is strange, no idea why its not clicking on the cards. There are a few other issues that may be related (#1859, #1853, #1793). I'll see if I can figure something out. \n. Great, that's good to know.\n. This is strange, seems to be the same problem as #1654.\nNot sure what to suggest since you've already tried a few things. Are you running hearthstone windowed or fullscreen? It could be worth trying fullscreen if your not already. Did you get the message in the deck tracker telling you are missing all the cards from the deck? Can you think of anything you might have changed or added recently, like a plugin or something?\nThe key has to be with Feugen & Stalagg because they're treated a bit differently when exporting. Do you have golden versions of them?\n. Damn, must've missed those tests after my last change. Fixed now.\n. Hardcoded a special case for V07TRON, I think it should work ok. Got rid of the green text too.\n. This is likely an issue with the Hearthstats servers, due to the scheduled downtime earlier. Until the problem is fixed you can use the continue as guest option, on the login screen, to use the tracker.\n. See Epix's response in #1668\n. I noticed this too. They are from last weeks brawl, Ragnaros and Neferian respectively, not sure how it happened.\n. This doesn't look possible, unfortunately. The site uses images only, and doesn't seem to have any usable card info that the tracker can extract.\nhtml\n<li>\n  <a href=\"#\" class=\"card\" data-cardid=\"211\" data-original-title=\"\" title=\"\">\n    <img src=\"http://cdn.teamarchon.com/images/cardbars_num/211.png\" alt=\"\">\n    <div class=\"card-num card-num-2\">2</div>\n  </a>\n</li>\n. Nice additions :+1: \nIt'll be interesting to see how it works when people test it out\n. Can you post a screenshot of hearthstone during a ranked game, and also the HDT log.\n. Thanks for the info. You're right that HDT tries to detect rank at the start of each turn and at the end of a game. It also has a limit to the number of times it will try to detect during a single game, so the switching windows is most likely the cause. I'm sure there is something we can do to improve it. If you could post a screenshot of a game, it would still be useful to see what HS looks like at your resolution.\n. The program is supposed to check if the rank icon is covered and hide the overlay briefly while it does the detection. It must not be working correctly. I'll test it out a bit myself.\nIf you could also post a screenshot of a game when you are using a large deck, that could be useful too.\n. @dphil unfortunately I don't think there's much that can be done regarding the screen dimmer problem, because the image detection is very sensitive to any variations.\nWe could put something in the FAQ though, to help troubleshoot problems.\n. You have probably accidentally downloaded the source code. You need to get the Hearthstone.Deck.Tracker zip file from this address https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/releases/latest\n. You should be able to change the setting in the config file %AppData%\\HearthstoneDeckTracker\\config.xml. When HDT is not running open the config file and look for the line containing <DeckExportDelay>150</DeckExportDelay> and change the number to whatever. The change won't be reflected in the options, but the new delay will be used when exporting. Hopefully, it works out for you.\n. @rapid383 if you have a crash log post it, it should be in a Crash Reports folder where you installed the tracker. If not post the hdt_log.txt found in %AppData%\\HearthstoneDeckTracker (directly after you experience a crash).\n. You can copy paste %AppData%\\HearthstoneDeckTracker\\Logs into windows explorer address bar and press return to go to the straight to the log folder. Or navigate to C:\\Users\\YOUR_USERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\HearthstoneDeckTracker\\Logs\nIt might also be worth retrying the steps in the ArenaHelper Readme again, and checking the issues there too, for example \"Everytime I try opening arena helper it crashes HDT\".\n. No you don't need the source code files. If you followed the steps it should work?\n. You have probably downloaded the source code by accident get the latest release zip file from https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/releases/latest\n(Another possibility is your virus software may have deleted the exe for some reason)\n. Can confirm this, the language change is never saved must be like this since HearthDB was added, @Epix37 its this line.\n. @EAldanaJ its good you found a solution, but it should really work with all resolutions so its still sort of a problem. Also, unless your replays look like this: \nThen it is probably not recording replays correctly and showing the old replay viewer, another problem :smile:.\n. This was also confirmed by @mrsimpleman on gitter, in his case only Mage and Warlock class cards showed up. Can't confirm it personally though.\n. I've been working on this feature for a while now, it uses the artwork from the game files. Don't know when it will be finished though :disappointed:\n. @lessismoremate what region did you change from and to, it may help solve the problem? Did you change from Turkish to English too?\n. Its very subtle, discussion #1926\n. Events should fire when a card is visually played. If you want it before that see #1672.\n. I think its fine.\nIt could be confused with deleting a deck.\nMaybe a symbol like this instead?\n\n. There already is an option to add a note, options > tracker > notifications > show note dialog after game\n. ~~Crap, I actually did optimize them but it looks like I must have messed up the rebase/reordering and the originals got pushed. Will fix it.~~\nUpdated now.\n. Nothing to do with the Deck Tracker, it has already been fixed. The Collection Tracker uses its own implementation (see here), which needs to be updated. As you know there already is an issue over on the Collection Tracker's page.\n. go to options > appearance > card theme and select Classic\n. The EndGame plugin can do this now, see the Readme for more.\n\n. This is pretty cool idea.\n@Elitesparkle why would you want it optional out of interest, specifically when would the extra info interfere with the way you use the screenshot?\n. Updated\n- changed the patterns as suggested, does look better\n\n- icons for arena and brawl\n\n- created set icons control\n- use only predefined tags (Midrange, Aggro, Control, Tempo, Combo)\n- add option to export menu \"Screenshot (with info)\"\n. Added an adventure icon for completeness (uses adventure or pve tags).\n\nShould be OK to megre now.\n. Updated as separate commit so diff is clear. Will squash it when your happy.\n. Ok should be good now :shipit: \n. @HEPEBAP For reasons below I think you must be referencing the regular HDT release. A solution is to build HDT from source and reference HearthstoneDeckTracker.exe and HearthDB.dll from the Hearthstone Deck Tracker\\bin\\Release or Hearthstone Deck Tracker\\bin\\Debug directories.\n@Epix37 I had a similar query from someone before, with the stats plugin. I thought then it was just something to do with their setup. It turns out there seems to be a problem compiling plugins if you reference the regular HDT release, and attempt to use that reference in xaml.\nxmlns:hdt=\"clr-namespace:Hearthstone_Deck_Tracker.Controls;assembly=HearthstoneDeckTracker\"\nLooks like its down to the renaming in the HDT post-build\nren \"..\\Hearthstone Deck Tracker\\HearthstoneDeckTracker.exe\" \"Hearthstone Deck Tracker.exe\"\nren \"..\\Hearthstone Deck Tracker\\HearthstoneDeckTracker.exe.config\" \"Hearthstone Deck Tracker.exe.config\"\nThe spaces mess the reference up as far as the xaml is concerned. Compiles fine if you use the Debug or Release versions directly, or if you just rename the files to remove the spaces again. I'll make a note of it on the plugin readme.\n. Check the Backups folder in AppData, the latest zip file should have a backup of your PlayerDecks (stats too but you probably won't need to restore them).\n. Done\n. The Time filter defaults to Season (the current month), so you're only getting June games. Set it to something else e.g. AllTime.\n. Have you tried these step in the FAQ?\n. For reference:\n OG_280\n OG_279\n. 279 is custom I somehow messed it up, so you can replace it with a copy of 280. I'll make a note of it.\n. There is no need to create multiple issues (#2625)\n. There is no need to create multiple issues (#2625)\n. Both links work fine for me on Win10.\nRestart HDT and try to import those links again. \nThen post the hdt_log.txt file (see this wiki page on where to locate the log file).\n. weird a 403, must be something strange going on at your end - can't think what though :confused:\n. Looks like you have accidentally downloaded the source code you need to download the zip from https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/releases/latest\n. Updated\nAlso, changed the window size slightly it seemed too small.\n. By default data is stored in C:\\Users\\<your_username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\HearthstoneDeckTracker.\nYou can open this directory quickly by pressing Windows Key + R  then type %APPDATA%\\HearthstoneDeckTracker followed by the OK button.\n. This is a Squirrel (the installer library) issue, there seems to be problem creating shortcuts on some computers (https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows/issues/509).\nThe best work around is to create your own shortcut with the following target:\nC:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\HearthstoneDeckTracker\\Update.exe --processStart \"HearthstoneDeckTracker.exe\"\nThis should still work after any HDT updates.\n. You can. Disable the Constructed card limits check box at the bottom of the card list.\n\nYou are right though, it would make sense to have this disabled by default for tavern brawl.\n. looking into it now. Does this compile for you? The renaming of id to actionStartingCardId causes build errors for me on lines 482, 487 & 492 those lines still use id.\n. Its using Deck.TagList, so it will catch brawl in any tag. Same for adventure, pve below.\n. Looks like this is leftover from me copying PlayerWindow, will get rid of it and just call Close() directly.\n. ",

You can just create the folder for the plugins and add the plugins of your choice to sub-folders.\n. You are probably opening Hearthstone Deck Tracker.exe.config.

If you take a look at the Available Plugins wiki page, there's a plugin that is exactly doing this: Hearthstone-Collection-Tracker.\n. See #1906, there's a workaround.\n.

I'm sorry, I need the PlayerDecks.xml, too.\n. There's no deck Main Druid in your PlayerDecks.xml. That's the one causing the error in the log. So the error is probably caused by trying to upload games that don't belong to a deck.\n. Create a new deck and assign these games to the new one via Move to other deck at Stats > [Old] Games & Statistics.\n. It tested it with your files and got the upload to work:\n- Clone the deck Ramp Druid without matches\n- Go to Stats > [Old] Games & Statistics and select all matches of the old Ramp Druid and click Move to other deck to move them to the new clone\n- Force full sync\n.

Did HDT stop working or was it Hearthstone?\n. Is there a log entry in the windows event log for the HDT crash itself (not the installer crash)?\nWhat's the error when you run HDT again?\nThe installer crash is likely a Squirrel issue.

What was the solution?\n. That's why I wrote it as a question. In your first post you said it was crashing constantly. Has it stopped crashing? What did you change?\n. Okay, thanks for the clarification.\n. The Hearth Arena tierlist is only meaningful for Arena. If you want help drafting, you can try https://github.com/rembound/Arena-Helper.\n. It's still there. After enabling Advanced options in the options, there's the option Show mana curve in the Tracker > General tab. You can see the mana curve below the deck list in the main window. To see the overload curve change the selection in the drop-down list from Mana to Overload.\n\nAlso isnt there a plugin for tracking from twitch streams for viewers?\n\nCan you clarify what you mean by that?\n. This is not a squirrel issue.\nSee #2873.\n. See #2873.\n. There should be a new shortcut on your desktop to launch HDT. If not, see #2881.\n.

I can't reproduce this even with setting back my windows time to the 29th november. Can you give specific instruction to reproduce this?\nAre always the earliest games missing or are there games missing from somewhere in between?. Okay, i can reproduce the issue.. Hidden Cache can only be greyed out if your opponent plays a minion, that was in his hand when you played a minion.. This is a HSTracker isssue. Post there: https://github.com/HearthSim/HSTracker..

For reference: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4367664/application-crashes-with-internal-error-in-the-net-runtime.. I don't know. Has HDT been working before? What changed when it stopped working? Any problems with other programs? Have you tried disabling your anti-virus software?. > Have you tried disabling your anti-virus software?\nOther than that I don't really know what else to do. I'm sorry.. There is https://github.com/arkein/Hearthstone-Treasury.. I haven't tried it, but it should at least track quest completion when you're rewarded gold.. The is a scaling option for the overlay (Options > Overlay> Player / Opponent).. The settings are saved at %AppData%\\HearthstoneDeckTracker..

Duplicate of #2738. Is this still happening?. Error was probably related to HearthMirror. Game mode couldn't be determined and there were errors importing constructed decks, but mirror status was okay.. If Hearthstone is already running, when HDT is started for the first time, Hearthstone has to be restarted so that HDT can work..

Check this: https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/FAQ#not-working.. So there are log files in the Hearthstone dir?. You can do this by manually editing the XML files, but it's probably not that easy.. You have to replace the folder from which you are running HDT.. Your data is stored at %APPDATA%\\HearthstoneDeckTracker by default. If you haven't disabled storing your data in appdata, you should be good (This advanced option is only available in the portable / no-installer version)..

Are you talking about the Stats window or the deck overview in the main window?\nFor the deck overview, you can change what's displayed in the options (Tracker > Stats > Display: Versions). So your decks still have stats?. Have you checked this https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/FAQ#games-andor-stats-are-not-being-saved?. I've got the same problem.\nError message is the following on Windows 7 x64:\n\nerror MSB3091: Task failed because \"resgen.exe\" was not found, or the correct Microsoft Windows SDK is not installed. The task is looking for \"resgen.exe\" in the \"bin\" subdirectory beneath the location specified in the InstallationFolder value of the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v8.0A\\WinSDK-NetFx35Tools-x86. You may be able to solve the problem by doing one of the following:  1) Install the Microsoft Windows SDK.  2) Install Visual Studio 2010.  3) Manually set the above registry key to the correct location.  4) Pass the correct location into the \"ToolPath\" parameter of the task.\n\nThe windows sdk is not installed. The registry key does not exist on my pc.. After installing the .NET Framework 4.5 SDK from the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows 8, the error stays the same. I don't know why it's looking for the NetFx 3.5 Tools. The Windows SDK 8 only contains NetFx 4.0 Tools.. With the proposed change, SdkToolsPath=C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v10.0A\\bin\\NETFX 4.6.1 Tools\\ is used. ~~This seems to be wrong, too.~~. I tested this with a simple test project with resources and targeting .NET Framework 4.5:\nThe GenerateResources task is called with Task Parameter:SdkToolsPath=C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v10.0A\\bin\\NETFX 4.6.1 Tools\\, so this change should be correct.\n@azeier could you check which path is used on your machine by setting the MSBuild project build output verbosity to Diagnostic in Tools > Options > Project and Solutions > Build and Run.. VisualStudio calls GenerateResource with $(TargetFrameworkSDKToolsDirectory), if $(ResgenToolPath) isn't defined, which it isn't by default (see Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets). So in my opinion this PR is correct.\n@azeier it works for you without the addition, because resgen.exe version 3.5 can be found on your installation. This version is used when the parameter SdkToolsPath of the GenerateResource task is not defined (see https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/f45785fb104c30080024affe855cd10ad27c6d4e/src/Tasks/GenerateResource.cs#L906-L921)..

Glad it works now ;). I can't reproduce this with Collection Tracker. Which plugins don't work for you?. It is probably caused by the HDT update that also updated the UI Framework MahApps.Metro.. Afaik the old version doesn't work with the latest Hearthstone update.. See https://github.com/RedHatter/Graveyard/issues/26 for an unofficial update of the Graveyard plugin.. And #3396.. Should be the same as #3421. Check this issue for further information.. c06d007e is module not found, there is still something wrong with your .NET Framework. @judge2020 Framework Version: v4.0.30319 is reported for all .NET installations with version 4 or higher at this place. There is no indication that Hearthstone was restarted during this HDT session, as there is no log line containing Info|Core.UpdateOverlayAsync >> Exited game. Could you reproduce this and post a HDT log.\nSteps:\n- start HS and HDT\n- play and restart HS after playing\n- play until the bug happens again\n- upload HDT log of this session. Related to #3359. Duplicate of #3359. Is this the same as #3445?. Does this happen too, if you disable your second screen in windows?. Sorry, forgot the following:\n- change the setting\n- quit HDT\n- then post the log. The line for HDT closing is missing, have you really closed HDT? Is the process gone (see Task Manager)?\n|Info|MainWindow.Window_Closing >> Shutting down.... If that line isn't there, your config won't be saved. It's very strange, that this line doesn't appear in your log. This means the code saving the config on quitting HDT isn't executed. So it won't save any options your changing. Is that true?\nIt works for me.\n. Can you try changing <RemoveCardsFromDeck>false</RemoveCardsFromDeck> in %appdata%\\HearthstoneDeckTracker\\config.xml from false to true, while HDT is closed?. No, as an opponent plays cards their card type is revealed and if it's a minion and was in the hand as the player played a minion, the secret is greyed out. It worked in my test. Maybe the method name MinionRevealed is misleading.. Yes, I know. But in this case all cards in the opponent's hand are tracked and checked when the data of the corresponding entity is updated (e.g. through playing or through a reveal).. Please provide crash logs and windows logs (see https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/Reporting-Issues). Try up- or downgrading your graphics card driver.. You can try updating DirectX. Which windows version are you using?. See #2676, there's a workaround that could help you.. You could have tried uninstalling that one update but okay.. Which files did you copy exactly? Have you tried reinstalling?. Stack trace might be the same as in #2201.\nCan you check / post the contents of the folder %LOCALAPPDATA%\\HearthstoneDeckTracker\\<insert-latest-version-here>\\Images.

If you can reproduce it, please provide the file Power.log from the directory <Hearthstone installation path>\\Logs.. Thanks for clarification.

System.UnauthorizedAccessException: Access to the path 'C:\\Users\\Kevin\\AppData\\Roaming\\HearthstoneDeckTracker\\hsreplay_decks.cache' is denied.\nHDT can't access anything under the path C:\\Users\\Kevin\\AppData\\Roaming\\HearthstoneDeckTracker. Check your permissions for this path.. https://goo.gl/search/windows+edit+permissions. Almost certainly you made a mistake somewhere.\nAlternatively you can try running HDT as admin.\nEdit: is the folder and/or the files read only (see properties)?. Have you deleted the corresponding decks?. These are arena decks without any games. \nMaybe there was an issue saving the stats file or those games weren't tracked or recorded for stats.. Duplicate of #3644. Duplicate of #3644. Duplicate of #3658. Are you using the installer version or the portable version?. Can you post HDT and setup log files please: https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/Reporting-Issues. Is there a corresponding error with the source .NET Runtime?. You still haven't answered this:\n\nIs there a corresponding error with the source .NET Runtime?. I was probably not clear enough. In the windows event viewer there's the column Source. I want to know if there is another error next to the error you posted, that has the source .NET Runtime.. Does it crash if you run Windows in safe mode?\n\n\nThis seems to be happening with other applications: \n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50265172/appcrash-kernelbase-dll\n- http://www.prepared3d.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8780\n- https://answers.microsoft.com/de-de/windowslive/forum/moviemaker-wlinstall/kernelbasedll-fehler-beim-starten/01e4e8b4-4c29-4969-8aaa-2d6db0e57fc4\nSadly, no solution yet.. It's most likely a driver or another program causing this problem. Did you update or install a new software just before this happened?

(4.7.2)?\nYes, it should. But i don't know a fix for this. It's definitely a .NET Framework issue.\nI'm closing this as you're fine with the workaround.. Duplicate of #3602. Duplicate of #3039. This has to be investigated further as Squirrel should support this:\nhttps://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows/blob/b25c9fa1e4d60f8969137532a95bd53bb5a8de1f/src/Squirrel/UpdateManager.ApplyReleases.cs#L418. Please provide crash logs. See https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/Reporting-Issues (sections HDT crash logs and Windows log files). Do you see the process starting in the task manager?. Please check the Windows event log and post the entries you found: https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/Reporting-Issues#windows-log-files. Is there a file named SquirrelSetup.log in %LocalAppData%\\HearthstoneDeckTracker. Could you upload it?. Try renaming the folder %LOCALAPPDATA%\\HearthstoneDeckTracker and reinstalling.. Looks like the HDT version wasn't downloaded completely. But that's just a guess.. Decks can't be updated retroactively. You'll have to reimport them.. If there is no backup, there is no way to restore the stats.. HDT was changed so that corrupted config files shouldn't happen anymore.. Somehow Pyros is tracked as removed from deck:\n3:51:46 PM|Info|Player.PlayToGraveyard >> [Opponent] id=49, cardId=UNG_027, cardName=Pyros, zonePos=0,Info={turn=2, originalZone=DECK, OriginalController=2}\n3:51:46 PM|Info|Player.CreateInHand >> [Opponent] id=70, cardId=, cardName=, zonePos=5,Info={turn=2, mark=Created, created=true, originalZone=HAND, hasOutstandingTagChanges=true}\n3:51:46 PM|Info|Player.RemoveFromDeck >> [Opponent] id=49, cardId=UNG_027, cardName=Pyros, zonePos=0,Info={turn=2, discarded=true, originalZone=DECK, OriginalController=2}. Yes, post a log please.. Thanks for reporting back. Glad you found the issue.. Try reinstalling / repairing .NET Framework.. Check the filters.. Please post a screnshot of the stats window.. That's the option window, please post a screenshot of the window / view opened by clicking stats > constructed in the toolbar.. @Eisigerhauch these are just Arena decks with no matches. @PanterA60 your stats files got corrupted, see the first screenshot in your first post. This can happen if the computer crashes / is turned of while HDT is writing the stats files.. The corruption shouldn't happen again starting with 1.7.6 (see b04f47268f540739364fc5f6798f56e46881b3b7).. The stats in the screenshot were all recorded after corruption of the original stats files, so there is nothing else going on. This issue is fixed.. Implements #3218. Can you post a screenshot of the error message? Does it mention a log?. Can you upload the file %LOCALAPPDATA%\\HearthstoneDeckTracker\\SquirrelSetup.log. Yeah, that's fine.. @x-ProgrammEd-x make sure you are using the latest version. See #3662.. Duplicate of #3587. The new version is fixed and should update correctly.. If i remember correctly, you can see that the game was indeed moved after restarting. So this is a UI update problem.. Please provide the HDT log corresponding to this problem. See https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/Reporting-Issues#hdt-log-files.. Duplicate of #3743. HearthstoneJSON, the card database for HDT, is extracted from game data. It does not have the Entourage property set for Kalimos, so there's no automatic way for HDT to know the associated cards.. That's how Arena works. A run is tied to a deck. Changing this behavior would be quite some work.. https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/Reporting-Issues. Duplicate of #3728. Did you mean to post to https://github.com/HearthSim/hs-bugs?. Post log files (Windows and setup): https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/Reporting-Issues. Is there anything in the Windows event viewer: https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/Reporting-Issues#windows-log-files?. Good, thanks for reporting back..

Copied from Discord:\n\nAvast is known to cause problems: make sure you got all folders mentioned here: https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/2738#issuecomment-396091386\nIf you have all of them, it may be another program causing these issues\nYou'll have to find that out by yourself, trying windows safe mode, and disabling programs incrementally in normal mode\nClosing an anti virus doesn't really disable it\nYou can temporarily uninstall Avast to check if it's really Avast. If it is, you'll have to play with the settings or ask their support.\n. Right now there is no way to do this via the HDT API and i doubt there will be a way, because this is borderline imo.\n\nYou should be able to programatically input keyboard / mouse events to Hearthstone via C#.. Filtering issue. Fixed by https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/2ef5980cef985d6fc2bcc28066aa2f0a6ffd5800.. Wait for the next release.

See https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/Reporting-Issues#hdt-log-files.\nMy guess is that you can manually create that folder and the log.config file and Hearthstone should read the one corresponding to the logged in Windows user account.. No, one of the statements only assigns the cardId deduced from the log. Duplicate of #3816.

It looks like you didn't extract the zip properly.. Please specify what isn't working. From the logs HDT starts just fine.. Fixed in v1.7.15. Post the log file please: https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/Reporting-Issues#hdt-log-files. Would you please share what you found out. Thank you.. You have the wrong issue tracker, open an issue here: https://github.com/HearthSim/HSTracker. I'll check it out on the weekend.. Imo the notice doesn't stand out enough. And I think placing it as a status bar at the top or the bottom may be better.\nAlso, when it's loading up with saved filters, the filter indicator incorrectly shows filters offline\n\n. One comment is still open. I think the variable LastAddedCardId should be a field of the block and not of the gamestate. What do you think?\nEdit: Otherwise it's looking good now, it worked in my test :+1:. I took a look at the power log and its reduced form looks like this:\nBLOCK_START BlockType=PLAY Fal'dorei Strider\n    BLOCK_START BlockType=POWER Fal'dorei Strider\n        Shuffle 3\n    BLOCK_END\n    BLOCK_START BlockType=TRIGGER Augmented Elekk\n        Shuffle 1\n    BLOCK_END\n    BLOCK_START BlockType=TRIGGER Augmented Elekk\n        Shuffle 1\n    BLOCK_END\n    BLOCK_START BlockType=TRIGGER Augmented Elekk\n        Shuffle 1\n    BLOCK_END\nBLOCK_END\nThis means, that the property would have to be in the parent block. The question left open is what does it look like when cards are shuffled by other means e.g. Academic Espionage (a spell).. Tested and confiremd working with Elekk and Dire Frenzy. Lgtm..

No, I need you record the game end with 0 turns in local,but not uploaded to website.\nI need to check if I have conceded 2 games in causal to decide whether continue concede or defeat the opponent. I have met this problem too,HDT just record the deck in the background,do not show the deck automatically.\nWhen I try to switch to another random deck, it will auto check deck and switch to the correct one. Is it possible for you to distinct same deck for different account?\nsame deck has different winrate for different hearthstone account\nthis bug  might be fixed by the advice mentioned by @judge2020  in #3149 . I believe it's the same problem as #3182 ,it's not the problem about the same deck in different account.. switch to use another deck,and begin a new game,then HDT will switch back to the correct deck and record the game https://hsreplay.net/replay/erbY8GeYNBSQZ7iLDSrFY7\nand here is the log.txt\n. I have met this problem again,and this is the second game in a new account https://hsreplay.net/replay/Hb4GFRXenMVMEmpwNpsrjj\nthe first game was not recorded by HDT,the second game can be recorded because I switch to a irrelevant deck then HDT switch back and start working.\nHere is the log.txt\n. @judge2020  No,I mean just auto import the deck I have played in game.. @judge2020 yes,I have checked that.\nIf I have 18 decks,the HDT will auto 18 decks,evenif  I just want to use 5 decks.\nI will delete all decks in HDT,and check the auto import again\n. I found the HDT record too many decks, 252 decks for my computer. @judge2020 I have confirmed that the HDT will auto import all decks in account when I switch to game menu. @azeier  ok,I will wait for this\nmaybe you can just delete the deck with no stats after user exiting the game. After lots of times uploading ,I can upload the record finally.\nIs it possible to config the reupload times in setting?. maybe you can upload the log file,you can find the log file by https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/Reporting-Issues. @stretch97  please check the crash log,you can send the log file to my emailbox 244657538@qq.com because I can not access the Amazon server.\nyou nedd also pload it here for other people to check\n.

Have you filed a bug on https://bugs.winehq.org?\n. Closing, there's nothing we can do about hearthstats issues.. @sebastientromp the problem is that the Hearthstone state is much more complex than chess', so a replay format has to track not only what moves were made, but everything that resulted from it.\nIf you just want the player's plays, you can strip everything but the SendOption tags as it's always about \"Here are your <Options>, pick an option and send it with <SendOption>\", but it doesn't seem particularly useful.\nFor example, in chess, board state is predetermined at the beginning of a game. Here in Hearthstone, you have to create all the entities first. Which hero are you using? Which hero power do you get with it? Which cards have been dealt to you?\nAdditionally, when the opponent plays something, it's not enough to say \"Opponent played Fireball on x\". You have to already know that the opponent had a card in hand, and that card became fireball, otherwise you don't know how many cards the opponent has in hand. So now you have to keep track of reveal/unreveal.. etc.\nAll in all I simply do not see a way to create a human readable notation that is also programmatically usable. You can make the hsreplay format human-readable by adding names to attributes though.\n. Ping me on the #hearthsim channel if you want to talk about this further.\n. It's not possible, nor is it planned.\n. We fixed a ton of OOM issues a few releases ago. Closing - reopen if you're still getting issues..

Wine isn't detecting the correct architecture (and in general, running wine foo.exe should run foo the same way as on windows).\n. What do you mean exactly?\n. I'd say you're missing the counters.\n. @305jeff We're working on adding some of that syncing to hsreplay.net, but it'll take some time. In the mean time, symlinks are the best way.\n. At the moment I don't think so, sorry. \n. @NickSloter Try updating to 1.0: https://hsdecktracker.net/download/\nThis shouldn't happen anymore. Closing for now. Reopen if it's still not working after upgrading to 1.0.\n. There is already a played spell tracker. By default, it shows only when you have yogg'saron in your deck or hand.\nThanks for the feedback!\n. Merging into #2584.\n. @xtreemmasheen3k2 Hey, we just announced the HSReplay.net HDT beta! Download the Beta channel here if you want to try it out: https://github.com/HearthSim/HDT-Releases-HSReplay/releases/download/v1.0.5.24/HDT-Installer.exe\n. @xtreemmasheen3k2 Hey, we just announced the HSReplay.net HDT beta! Download the Beta channel here if you want to try it out: https://github.com/HearthSim/HDT-Releases-HSReplay/releases/download/v1.0.5.24/HDT-Installer.exe\n. Have you looked at this page? https://hsreplay.net/account/social/connections/\nMake sure you log out of Battle.net before clicking \"Connect a Battle.net account\". Let me know if you're still having issues.\n. Ah, I see. Account deletes are not instantaneous (so that they can be reverted), but there's a bug that prevents them from being reactivated on log-in. I'll get that fixed - in the mean time, I deleted your account, you should be able to sign up again.\n. It's not really bannable, but for the time being it's out of scope for HDT. \n. @ChuckJrster i see you closed the issue. I don't know if this is fixed for you, but you should know everything hearthstats-related is no longer maintained and may be removed in a future version.\n. How to claim your account: https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/FAQ#claim-account\nHave you tried restarting hdt and attempting the claim again?\nIf that doesn't work, email me your hsreplay.cache file in %APPDATA%/HearthstoneDeckTracker/hsreplay.cache to jerome@hearthsim.net and I'll take a further look.\n. @amw2104 with proposal 1, multi-deck support is less clear. That's its main downside and why I prefer prop 2.\n. That's pretty contrived, requires localization and all.\nI think what would possibly make the most sense is making both optional, but relying on class to determine the deck's class (essentially that means class should always be present for class decks). \n. @postcasio The problem is two-fold:\n1. If that structure is built in JS, then it's not scrapeable without a JS engine (which defeats the point of the spec)\n2. It puts very strict requirements on the website's DOM. This may require reworking or implementing a lot of code (eg. some websites straight up use images for decklists).\n. It looks like we'll be going for the meta tag proposal. ~~To that end, I've been trying to figure out how to make it work with multiple decks on the same page.~~\n~~Amendment to the proposal:~~\n- ~~An optional x-deck-id html attribute can be added to the meta tags. This ID will uniquely identify a deck with an ID of the website's choosing (for example, a database ID, a UUID, whatever).~~\n- ~~If more than one deck is to be on the page, the x-deck-id must be specified on all tags.~~\n. We'll be moving forwards with the meta tag proposal regardless of the outcome of the above amendment. Once we get to supporting multiple decks we'll confirm whether that's what's in place.\n. I confirmed something neat: Having multiple identical sets of opengraph tags with different values is valid. Github does it, in fact:\nhtml\n    <meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/modules/open_graph/github-logo.png\">\n    <meta property=\"og:image:type\" content=\"image/png\">\n    <meta property=\"og:image:width\" content=\"1200\">\n    <meta property=\"og:image:height\" content=\"1200\">\n    <meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/modules/open_graph/github-mark.png\">\n    <meta property=\"og:image:type\" content=\"image/png\">\n    <meta property=\"og:image:width\" content=\"1200\">\n    <meta property=\"og:image:height\" content=\"620\">\n    <meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/modules/open_graph/github-octocat.png\">\n    <meta property=\"og:image:type\" content=\"image/png\">\n    <meta property=\"og:image:width\" content=\"1200\">\n    <meta property=\"og:image:height\" content=\"620\">\nThus I think we are safe to say that this spec implicitly supports multiple decks by specifying multiple blocks of decks in a row. This isn't implemented in any tracker but there wouldn't be an issue doing so.\nI think we're good to close the issue. Discussion can still happen here either way, but this is done and done. Yay!. Actually, I will reopen this to discuss deck types real quick. The number one request in here has been to add deck types. Since we first worked on this, we found the DeckType enum and I would like to use it.\nHere is the DeckType enum:\n```py\nclass DeckType(IntEnum):\n    \"PegasusShared.DeckType\"\nUNKNOWN_DECK_TYPE = 0\nNORMAL_DECK = 1\nAI_DECK = 2\nDRAFT_DECK = 4\nPRECON_DECK = 5\nTAVERN_BRAWL_DECK = 6\nFSG_BRAWL_DECK = 7\nHIDDEN_DECK = 1000\n\n```\nThe values (I'm going from memory, would have to double-check them before putting them into the spec):\n\nNORMAL_DECK: A generic deck that goes in the collection manager.\nAI_DECK: A deck that is used by the AI (pve adventures, tutorial etc).\nDRAFT_DECK: An arena deck.\nPRECON_DECK: I believe these are the 9 preconstructed decks you get when starting the game. I'm not sure they're still used since the collection manager revamp / deck slot increase.\nTAVERN_BRAWL_DECK: Your weekly constructed brawl deck. This does not include the \"randomized\" brawl decks and the preconstructed brawl decks; it's only for decks you build yourself in brawl.\nFSG_BRAWL_DECK: Likely related to the new fireside gathering stuff in 8.0.0. I don't know how that works.\nHIDDEN_DECK: No idea. Internal.\n\nI suspect we can allow all the values except UNKNOWN_DECK_TYPEand HIDDEN_DECK, default to NORMAL_DECK if not found. We should also use the string enum, not its numeric value, to avoid confusion.\nThis would look like the following:\n<meta property=\"x-hearthstone:deck:type\" content=\"TAVERN_BRAWL_DECK\"/>\nThoughts?. Yes, deck strings have been added to the spec as well. They replace the cards and hero properties, although both methods will be supported for a long time (we recommend implementations switch to using deckstrings however). . Closing this yes, since deckstrings are a thing now this doesn't make much sense to support anymore. The documentation is all there in case someone in the future is curious.. Is it possible your permissions are messed up somehow? Have you ran hdt as admin at some point or some such?\nAt this point I'd recommend backing up your settings, uninstalling hdt completely, reinstalling it and restoring the settings manually.\n.

Tracking in https://github.com/HearthSim/joust/issues/133\n. There are no plans to remove it right now, a lot of people actually use it. Maybe later down the line if we see that change.\n. - Which country are you in / what ISP?\n- What web browser are you using?\n- What's the exact link of the download URL in question?

Closing this as it seems to be on your end, there isn't much we can do.\n. Good to see it's solved!\n. Same issue as #2811?\n. Great!\n. You need to rebase it; it doesn't contain your commits right now.\n. Can you link the commit containing the localization?\nOtherwise if you are not familiar with git, the simplest will be to take the strings file, reset or re-clone the repo to current master, and commit once again on top of it.\nI know @azeier wanted to move translations to their own repo anyway, which would simplify things.\n. Can you take a look at #2811 and see if the same fix works for you?\n. Great!\n. @TemporalOnline You don't need to claim your account. The only way they don't get uploaded, is if you have uploading explicitly disabled for that game mode (in the replay section of the stats).\n. Call Pet isn't a secret. Do you mean Cat Trick?\n. That's because Duplicate is a Wild card.\n. > I'm wondering what the status of the site is since the original owner sold it.\nAs far as we know, HearthStats is dead and unmaintained. Which is why we're working on personal stats on HSReplay.net to give users a migration option.\n. > would (or could) it be an option to upload one's entire HDT history once you get the HSReplay.net based personal stats up and running (migrating from hearthstats not an option for me as it's turned into such a mess - I'm wondering if I'm not the only one). It would be nice to have the history.\nNot sure it'll be possible to import from Hearthstats. Hearthstats gathers a lot less information about games than we do on HSReplay.net (in fact, it doesnt even gather the game's contents). But if you have game replays on HDT, those can be imported into your HSReplay.net account by simply opening the replay from HDT and viewing it, as this is the new replay viewer. We'll do stats over any game you have on your account!\n\ndo you have feel for when the HSReplay.net based personal stats are likely to be up and running - will be keen to try it out of course!\n\nNo idea, sorry, we have a bunch of open threads right now but it's currently at the top of the list. If you know Python, you can help - it's open source :)\n. Hey there! \nTake a look at the following repository:\nhttps://github.com/HearthSim/HDT-Localization\nIf you file a pull request with String.pt-PT.resx, that will do the trick.\n. ResX Resource Manager is what other translators are using:\nhttps://resxresourcemanager.codeplex.com/\nYou can download the repository directly (top right, green button), and take example from the other Strings.*.resx files. Then if you don't use github, you can attach a Strings.pt-PT.resx file to this issue, and we'll take care of the rest for you.\n. Thanks for your interest! Let me know if you need any more help.\n. @cachirro No worries. Your help is appreciated.\n. This is probably worth tracking in #2224\n. Do you mean on HDT or on the website?\nI'm closing this because you mistakenly filed a pull request instead of an issue.\n. Do you have a screenshot of what you mean?\n.

I don't think it's a bug - it's actually intended by blizzard, given that jousts create a copy of the minion, it's impossible to know whether the jousted minion is a different one or the same one.\nThat said, HDT could simply not add a second copy of the minion if one is already present as it can't know better.\n. Yes, it's meant to prevent info leaks (eg. knowing when the opponent draws a card that was jousted).\n. More info: https://github.com/HearthSim/hs-bugs/issues/132\n. You shouldn't be building a signed release, as you don't have a certificate for it.\n. It's not about the program, you are missing the certificate.

Debug is probably what you want.\n. Squirrel is one of our release modes. It's for distribution only.\n. Closing - please reopen if you're still having issues.. HDT updates in the background by default. If you're seeing release notes, the update's already happened.. Do you mean that it's not made obvious enough that HDT has been updated when you see the release notes? . If that's the case we can probably stuff in an \"HDT has been updated to x.y.z\" somewhere but I thought we did that already.. @azeier that's the 404 for the image. did you grab it too early or is it just missing? cc @andburn . @andburn the algorithm in generate_card_textures.py is not picking up on the tile.

Hearthstats is essentially dead and unmaintained. I doubt it'll change.. @winterismute I think this would fit perfectly in a plugin.. Logfiles won't be enough. You'll need to hook into HearthMirror functionality: https://github.com/HearthSim/HearthMirror. Also, you'll probably need to add that functionality to HM ;). @culinko did you post a log? if there is an event in the log then that's pretty useful to know to trigger a memory scan.\nAlso where have you been dude? :). Reroll triggers are still pretty useful, as this would be a needed feature in a quest tracker.\nAlso, we're mirroring the IRC channel on discord now, so you won't have an excuse to be MIA anymore ;). You can ask for help on our discord server. Just ping Alex there.. So you guys know, pack tracking on HSReplay.net can be turned on with some configuration modification. The packs are currently not displayed on the site but if this ever happens, you can start tracking them right now. Just let me know if you're interested and I'll help you turn it on.. It might be related to TLS configuration on your machine. It's also possible you're legitimately being MITM'd and it's being caught. The former seems more likely... but it wouldnt necessarily be reproducible with curl, it could be specific to c#.. Closing, I don't think there's anything we can do about this.\nFor those landing here through Google, here is how to claim your account on HSReplay.net:\nhttps://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/FAQ#claim-account. Not sure I understand. You say you uninstalled, then it stopped tracking? Or what happened to make it stop tracking?\nBy default HDT doesn't delete user data on uninstall. Did you look at whether the stats are still saved somewhere?. - Is it possible you have an antivirus running that's quarantining the config files?\n- Do you only lose your decks/stats or also the HDT configuration?\n- Are you logged into HearthStats?\n- Did you claim an HSReplay.net account?. Yeah it's not available. I think we can remove support for it.. @garyking arrow up/down will go to previous/next action on HSReplay.net. Does that help?. @garyking noted. Theres an event log which you can enable with the gear icon; it's super buggy right now though, which is why it's not very obvious. We'll add scrolling and click-to-go when we do a second pass on it.. @PuppetMaster000 if you're concerned with the hsreplay.net stats those can be merged very easily. It's just the local ones that are hard.. Yes, if you log in with the same account, that's what will happen. Your replays will be under the same account.\nThe local data (decks) are not mergeable yet tho :(. Can you email your config files to contact@hearthsim.info? I'll see what I can do.. Yeah, both the old and new ones. I'll take a look at them tomorrow see if there's a way to merge them.. We're really unlikely to do this in HSReplay.net any time soon, because it requires quite a lot of processing to do right.\nIf someone wants to implement something like this on top of the HSReplay format I s'pose it would be cool, but I'm going to close this issue as it's simply not a feasible project on our side atm (and wouldn't be in HDT either way).. I'll talk to him, see if we can add native HDT imports. I'll talk to him, see if we can add native HDT imports. pls. Oh you think you can stop me?!. I don't understand, what is the tracker not doing exactly?. Doing this will require constantly updating the submodule reference though, which is a PITA especially for the i18n repo. If anything they should be subtrees?. It defaults to the head when initializing, but your commit initializes it. Submodules always have a commit reference in a tree. Thus if this gets merged as-is, it will forever reference the commits it initialized to, until it's updated.. In other words, submodules work nicely when you are dealing with libraries which are infrequently released. Not if you're dealing with a cousin repo.. I don't really know what we can do there. There's already a retry with backoffs in HDT which should be good enough for most cases, but the API server being in the USA means it won't necessarily be reachable from China.\nWe're getting a fair amount of uploads from China though so this is maybe something you can fix with your provider, I dunno :/ Closing because there's nothing more we can really do I think.. What does this have to do with HDT?. What does this have to do with HDT?. HDT doesn't do anything with Battle.net. Does it happen if HDT is not running?. HDT doesn't do anything with Battle.net.

Hey there,\nThis isn't really the spot to report this, an easier way is to contact us at contact@hsreplay.net.\nI've had this issue happen to myself before however and it's (usually) related to HDT not correctly auto-detecting the current deck. You could check your latest replays, see if the full deck is available on the right of the replay. If that's the issue, the fix it to ensure the deck has been imported correctly into HDT.\nI believe @azeier is working on improving deck autodetection. If that's the issue it should get better in the future.. I'm seeing TLS issues. That indeed sounds like it could be firewall/antivirus interfering. Have you tried temporarily disabling the firewall and seeing if it's still happening? If it does then it's something else.\nYou could also have the firewall whitelist hsdecktracker.net, githubusercontent.com and amazonaws.com. That might help.. That sounds like a disconnect..

    "rolandschulz": "I think it would be very useful. At least right now one sees mostly the same decks just with a few tech cards replaced (at least for rank 8-4). And just showing the most common cards for a certain deck type is not more than one can achieve with a 2nd monitor or piece of paper showing list of decks. Thus it doesn't give an unfair advantage but is cheaper and more convenient and thus useful in HDT. For those few cards which are often replaced one could list each option with the percentage each is selected among the top decks selected from whatever source (HDT database or some website). Another advantage of being able to select the deck type in game would be that this information could be used for the statics/tagging. That way the static matrix which currently shows the overall stats (for each class vs each other class) could show each deck type vs each deck type. Thus one could see how often one wins/loses with/against zoo/handlock separately.\n. There doesn't seem to be a v0.9.7 tag but only PRE5 and PRE6 but those are older than your fix and thus shouldn't contain it.\n. A more robust solution than OCR might be to do an image comparison to all known cards. Of course one would still need to do image recognition to find the borders of each card slot. And it would also be hard with localization. Just an idea if someone wants to do the plugin.\n. A more robust solution than OCR might be to do an image comparison to all known cards.

I will test it out tonight and report back any issues.\n. Same issue as OP here.\n. Hi Epix37 - yes it happens with HSDT running. I've never had it freeze on start and the updates always pop up fine on start. I get the feeling that when I open HSDT from the system tray, there is an update window that I can't see, which disables my access to the actual program. Just a guess. Thanks!\n. It sounds like these are separate issues. I've never had HSDT freeze except when an update is available and I open it while playing HS.\n. Correct - I have not found a way to \"unfreeze\" it once this happens. Eventually I just force close it, restart, and the update notification pops up.\n. Just happened again with the latest update. I was playing HS and noticed suddenly that after a game it didn't reload my deck...it just stayed with all the cards greyed out then started lighting them up as I drew them...kind of like reverse-mode. When I opened it from the notification pane, it was the same as before: everything greyed out, can't click or do anything.\nThen I played around some more...\nThis time I found that if I shift+right click on it in the task bar and maximize it, suddenly the update notification is there. It remains even if I then restore it back to normal size. Hope this helps!\n. Still having the same problem. At least the workaround I found is easy.\nRegarding your question in the above referenced thread, I am on Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit.\n. This just happened again with the latest update. See the link for a screenshot:\nhttp://puu.sh/fKGRD/5bcedd2805.png\n. Happened again with this update - screenshot here:\nhttp://puu.sh/gjbcD/1e65c67387.png\nThanks again for your awesome work and dedication.\n. Good morning! Status update on this? I have disabled minimize to system tray but do miss it a bit! Thanks.\n. I have the same issue with spare parts and unstable portal. I tried deleting the entire HSDT folder and re-downloading...left the appdata folder untouched except I copied over the new log.config as suggested.\n. I stopped playing the mage deck so I'm not seeing the same errors with unstable portal and spare parts...but I just played against a warrior with Iron Juggernaut and it seems like drawing the bomb caused it to think I played the wrong cards again...there's definitely still something wrong.\n. Will do. Thanks!\n. I've had this happening to me all week, at least. It does seem like after turn 10 it starts marking all cards as 0. Very disorienting!\n. Kind of unrelated, but have you noticed that when you draw a card, it no longer shows up in the deck tracker before it's actually drawn? I definitely miss seeing the card highlight on the tracker before it even shows up in my hand!\n. Is the symbolic link still the best way to accomplish this? I just got a Surface Pro 4 and want to keep stats synced between it and my desktop. Hearthstats syncing is doing half the job, but it does not include decks/replays/etc., so it's not quite what I want.\nThanks!\n. @jleclanche Thank you for the response. The issue I see with the symlinks and Dropbox is that it appears to mirror the entire config file as well...so all my settings would have to be exactly the same on each computer. That seems problematic since the Surface Pro 4 has a different resolution/positioning of all the items. Is there any way to work around that?\nThanks!\n. @jleclanche So I didn't give up and thought maybe the solution is to create a second symlink...move the config.xml file to another location and create a symlink in Dropbox so that the config.xml is local and everything else is in Dropbox.\nmklink d:\\dropbox\\HearthstoneDeckTracker\\config.xml %APPDATA%\\config.xml\nTesting this now, but in theory it makes sense, no? This is my first time using mklink so I'm just trying stuff. I'm not sure if it's necessary to add a /h argument to make it a hard link...as I haven't read an explanation about symlink vs. /h hardlink that really makes sense to me!\nThanks again,\nJeff\n. Ok there was a little complication...Dropbox sync'd the symlink as a normal file, which prevented me from creating a symlink on the Surface. I found a little trick to get Dropbox to ignore the config.xml file, allowing me to create two separate symlinks on the different computers:\nhttp://superuser.com/questions/469776/how-to-exclude-files-not-folders-from-dropbox-sync\n_To exclude FILES, not folders, from Dropbox, there is a trick you can do:\nMove the file somewhere else\nCreate a folder with the same name in place of the file\nGo to Dropbox selective sync options and ignore the folder, this will also delete it\nMove the file back in place_\nSo now the question is whether or not this will function properly where HSDT is fully sync'd via Dropbox EXCEPT for separate local symlink'd config.xml files.\nTesting continues!\n. I'm happy to say that after playing games on both devices a few different times, everything appears to be syncing perfectly via Dropbox...AND the symlink for the separate config files is working as well!\n. I made this into a little mini-guide:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/4zi860/how_to_sync_hearthstone_deck_tracker_on_multiple/\n. @TheOneGodKing You have three directories in your command for some reason.

    "Core-Xii": "I know that that information is already available; I'm suggesting that this information is more useful than its counterpart, and that this change improves the gaining of that information at a glance.\n. You are correct in that the information is already there. My suggestion pertains to the visual communication of that information. Hearthstone Deck Tracker marks cards that have some unique property - such as the coin, Thoughtstolen cards, etcetera. Having drawn a card randomly is not a unique property, as that is the case with most cards. However, specifically having kept a card in a starting hand makes it LESS random than the other ones, since the player consciously chose to keep it. So to display this fact in a more obvious manner, is of greater utility. (the kept cards, marked, stand out visually more prominently, assuming mulliganed cards aren't marked anymore. Among the 0's, the cards with, say, a \"K\" mark are clearly visually recognizable as having been kept)\nIt can be argued that the decision to mulligan a card also indicates the player's conscious choice to rather re-roll it for a better one - however, as that specific card is then shuffled back into the player's deck and replaced with a random one, it cannot be tracked. Thus, it's more useful to mark the inverse.\n. ",

And it seems Windows 10 has a bug in font fallback handling, where previous Windows works well.\nIn my Win 10, with UI font set to \"Segoe UI\", some chinese punctuation will display as boxes, just like the screenshot. If the UI font is \"Microsoft YaHei UI\", the card name will display correctly. (However there are some other places such as the edit note dialog where it displays incorrectly. I suspect MahApps.Metro hardcoded \"Segoe UI\" somewhere).\nTo workaround the bug, try these steps:\n1. Change Windows Display Language to Russian.\n2. Relogin. Backup registry HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Control Panel\\Desktop\\WindowMetrics, especially all *Font values.\n3. Change Windows Display Language back.\n4. Relogin. Restore the registry backup.\nPS: The bug also affects other programs such as Visual Studio 2015 (or 2013?). If you have VS installed, try typing Russian in the upper-right search box with non-Russian Windows Display Language. I guess it can be reproduced.\n. It also happens in user generated content such as deck names, notes. I don't think there is a good solution here.\n. I think it's okay for merge now :)\n. I tried to hide the TextBlock showing alternative texts by setting Visibility property here. However it does not work as expected. Do you have some idea?\n. Nice catch! I will update it soon.\n. ",

    "BVA64": "I like this feature!\nSome minor improvements suggestions:\n- If the opponent has multiple secrets in play and one triggers the triggered secret should automatically be grayed out from the list because we can't have the same secret twice in play at the same time\n- In constructed if two secrets of one type were already triggered the opponent can not have any more in his hand and such a secret could also be automatically grayed out in the list \n. After some testing I found that the above is not 100% reliable either. Under some circumstances HS fails to log the change of the current player.\nAs an alternative I can see checking the \"player\" element from a Zone line for changes:\n\n[Zone] ZoneChangeList.ProcessChanges() - id=57 local=False [name=Stampeding Kodo id=61 zone=PLAY zonePos=3 cardId=NEW1_041 player=2] zone from OPPOSING HAND -> OPPOSING PLAY\n\n1 is the player. 2 is the opponent.\n. I came to the same conclusion. :(\nOne could also check the color of the end turn button in a similar fashion as the golden card detection is done.\n. What about checking for power messages above the threshold uninterrupted by\nany zone messages (or zone messages caught by one of the regexps)? This\nwould avoid possible miracle rouge style long turns to be considered as two\nturns.\nBut I agree that the existing solution would work probably for 99% of the\ncases.\n. Right! I missed that bit.\n. Some further data. In the linked game I had the following situation:\nOpponent turn: Round 3 (based on available mana on screen), Drawn card numbered as 4\nRound 8: Drawn card number 10 (should have been 9 considering the previous glitch in round numbering)\nBUT\nRound 9: Card number still 10!\nTracker log: http://pastebin.com/Zw8pJ4YS\nHS Log: http://www.mediafire.com/download/9y4dw5qg223v6oe/output_log.zip\n. I would combine them like this:\n1.  tag=CURRENT_PLAYER, no false positives, if it is there then it means end of turn (worked from me 90% of the time)\n2. if not 1, color of the end turn button can be checked. Glitches of the button could be mitigated by checking the right half of the button which is usually ok even when glitched. Also we can detect glitches if the result is off from the expected average colors and ignore the result.\n3. if all else fails we can use the threshold as now.\nNot sure if 2 is worth the effort but it is your call. \n. Another way: look for \n\n[Power] GameState.DebugPrintOptions() -   option 0 type=END_TURN mainEntity=\n\nHopefully this is written for all turn ends.\n. Yes. It is fixed.\n. A log about a situation where the opponents Webspinner was destroyed by my Northshire Cleric. On lines 392-398 you can see that the death of the Webspinner triggered the addition of a card with id=72 to the hand of the opponent. This is the only place I could find where the two id's were linked.\nhttp://pastebin.com/GUUDfnrB\n. The issue still persists with the new log reader.\n. It is a bit hard for me to find the matching log sections to a game to give an example. What about saving the raw log data into the replay file as well. Just a thought.\n. Works much better now.\nAlso found some issues when the Tinkertown Technicians combo is activated. No card is shown as a tooltip at all on the S marker. The card draw is also missing from the ReplayView.\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/?9so4w7b9bqkfdlb\n. You can leave it like this I guess. It's not a major issue.\n. A multi-level tree would solve the issue. I'm closing this one. \n. A possibly similar issue with Faceless Manipulator on turn 16. The FM is shown when played and subsequently disappears but the unit it turned into is not shown.\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/?hibyaxe7y4n6b7i\n. Recombobulator now works fine. Thaddius is also shown as expected.\nSome other messages have appeared as a side effect which are fine like:\n\nPlaySpell Power Word Shield\nSummon Power Word Shield\nDraw Auchanai Souldprist\n\nThis issue can be closed.\n. It looks like the same issue is present also for the order of the minions on the board. \nTurn 12: I played the Kezan Mystic to the far right. In ReplayView it is shown to be in the middle. In Turn 13 it is shown in the correct position.\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/download/73hjf9xu189nhq4/BVA64(Priest)_vs_Tardotron(Shaman)_2210-060115.hdtreplay\nThe issue I believe is somewhere in the method ResolveZonePos run before the replay is saved. In the saved json replay file the elements are already in the wrong \"order\".\n. Great! Thanks! \n. A similar issue later on in turn 19 where the Sword of Justice increased a summoned SHR to 2/2 but on screen it still remained 1/1.\n. Strangely enough in turn 21 another SHR recruit was buffed as expected.\n. I made some changes to save the log into the replay file. #552 \nNo changes were made to the way the JSON file is handled.\n.

There is a tooltip if you move your mouse over the \"S\" letter that shows the source of the stolen card. \nIf the tooltip is not shown make sure you have the latest version (this is a fairly recent feature) and that it is turned on under Options -> General -> Overlay -> Card-mark tooltips.\n. hdt_log_1450247510.txt\nTimestamp: [10:39:08]\n. hdt_log_1468237973.txt\n.

    "thesh0ck": "TL;DR: All of the information needed for statistical calculations of any sort (ex. mana it cost \nto kill a minion vs. that killed minions cost etc..) is in fact in the logs and could be parsed \nrather easily.\nIts all there in my logs as far as I can see, everything the game itself is using to calculate\n health, damage, attacks, spells, abilities etc. I would write it myself but I do not know the\n language used.\nPerhaps this information would be useful to others though if this is not something you wish\nto incorporate, so anyone can feel free to repost it on reddit etc in case anyone else is \nplanning such a thing and you feel it will help.\nI want to start by saying that I realize you must know most of this from creating the code to \ntrack the decks, however I must be verbose for clarity. \nEntities in the logs are identified by a 'zone=' in which they live. For example 'zone=HAND' \nmeans this line describes something related to a card in the players hand as you must well \nknow. What you need to look at for statistics is, 'zone=PLAY', because every card on the \nboard, every attack damage, every point spent, every defense damage, every power used, \nis tracked in the PLAY zone. Also the zone=GRAVEYARD is helpful as well, because this \nindicates a card is either not placed on the board (I.E. a spell), or the card on the board is \ndestroyed and thus being removed.\nJust as with the HAND zone, every source, target, card, power, etc in the PLAY zone has a\n zonePos. It is likely you have used this when tracking cards in the hands, because the hand \nhas its own zonePos for each card as well as an id= that distinguishes duplicate cards in the \nhand/field.\nSo in the zonePos= field for zone=PLAY, your player, and the other players actual character \n(Jaina, Thrall, etc) live in zonePos=0 for your respected sides. Your hero power is also loaded \nas a card in zonePos=0 at the beginning of the game, as well a any weapon equipped. All live \nin zonePos=0. Regardless any damage done to zonePos=0 would be to your character (which \nalso has a unique id when attacked) That is, unless it is for example, a card that damages or \ndestroys a weapon, which would instead 'remove' the 'card', (again identified in the attack log \nline by its uinique id=), that is the weapon in zonePos=0 from the zone PLAY to the zone \ngraveyard, or do damage to it which is also logged.\nFollowing that, zonePos=1 would be the first card in the center of the field and so on for the \nrest of the play field.\nEverything has a unique id=, zone=, and zonePos= so it can all be accurately tracked (this is, \nin fact how the game keeps track itself.)\nSo on to the statistics part. Now that we know how to track where every card that is played, \nhow do we use this to track cards played against other cards, damage done, and resource \ncosts used?\nSimple, all of that is in the logs as well.\nFrom one of my logs we have an ACTION_START as below:\n[Power] GameState.DebugPrintPower() - ACTION_START Entity=[name=Lightwarden id=55 \nzone=PLAY zonePos=1 cardId=EX1_001 player=2] SubType=ATTACK Index=-1 Target=\n[name=Mirror Image id=70 zone=PLAY zonePos=3 cardId=CS2_mirror player=1]\nThis is defined as:\n```\n    Entity=[name= is the 'Full Name' of the thing being used to attack.\n                id= a unique id given to each entity: players, cards, hero powers, weapons, most \n                      of which are generated at the beginning of the game (your chars, decks etc) \n                      to ensure everything is unique. \n                zone=PLAY this thin is being used directly on the field.\n                zonePos is the place on the field the source is located.\n                cardid well, you obviously know this one by now. =)\n               ]\nSubType is set to ATTACK so in this case something is attacking something\n             else on the PLAY field. Interesting.\n\nTarget=[name=  the \"Full Name\" of the thing \n              id= unique id\n              zone= PLAY, again this something else on the field.\n              zonePos= is the place this item is on the field.\n              cardid= you know.\n             ]\n\n```\nSo this tells us what is attacking what. Good. Now we can lookup the card mana values \nalready easily enough, but those are given to us all throughout the logs as well for example \nwhen a card is placed in the field:\n[Power] GameState.DebugPrintPower() - ACTION_START Entity=[name=Frostwolf Grunt id=70 \nzone=HAND zonePos=6 cardId=CS2_121 player=2] SubType=PLAY Index=0 Target=0\nFollowed by serveral \"TAG\" log lines:\n[Power] GameState.DebugPrintPower() -     TAG_CHANGE Entity=Noctorne \n                tag=RESOURCES_USED value=2\n  [Power] GameState.DebugPrintPower() -     TAG_CHANGE Entity=Noctorne \n                tag=NUM_CARDS_PLAYED_THIS_TURN value=1\n  [Power] GameState.DebugPrintPower() -     TAG_CHANGE Entity=Noctorne \n                tag=NUM_MINIONS_PLAYED_THIS_TURN value=1\nSo we can see this cost 2 resources, I have only played 1 card this turn, and since it was a \nminion, it shows I have played a minion.\nSo with what we have so far, we can track all resources used(or wasted) per turn, cards \nplayed per turn, minions played per turn, and what is attacking what (which we can already \ngrab the mana values for both, but it kindly informs us anyway).  We can also track damage \nper turn, (per spell/minion/weapon/hero power), per mana used that turn, and overall damage \nvs mana usage, as well as track minion deaths and the minions/spells it took to kill them.  By \nkeeping track of this information, it can give us a mana/spell/minion/weapon/hero power cost \nper each minion killed. There are attacker/defender tags that show damage numbers, player \nhealth etc.\nAs far as I can see, everything the game does is recorded in the order it happened, with \nunique ids for everything, sometimes split across several log lines in clear sections, that can \nbe parsed.  So it is all there. Someone just needs to run with it.\n--sh0ck \n. ",

It affects both the game and the mouse curser, and I've had several games where I just couldn't move the mouse enough to finish in time, which is more frustrating than going without hearthstone tracker.\nI haven't made any changes to my setup, so I don't really know how to troubleshoot it.

I think to do this, you can expose some of the same functionality you used for the replay and just add to the cards list of actions as the game progresses.

The first one is probably due to some changes in the WinAPI. I'm currently using Windows 10 preview.

The config has been updated, such that the standard value of DataDirPath is set to \".\" now, since \".[file].xml\" should be a valid path in the older versions. Could you double check this?\n. - Only one installation is required for multiboxing. But using symlinks, we are able to output the logs to different directories (setting the Logs folder as a directory symlink to another directory). The symlink can be changed to a different directory every time another instance of hearthstone is started.\n- Currently, I'm using multiple HDT installations with a script to sync all installations afterwards and automatically create symlinks and start Hearthstone for different regions (by rewriting the battle.net configuration file between starts of different Hearthstone instances).\n- HDT can be run as often as you want. It shuts down if it cannot get write access to its own log file. However, changing the data directory for HDT creates separate log files for all installations. You can have as many instances of HDT running at the same time as you want.\n- A \"user profile system\" is currently just different HDT tracker installations that work independently by setting the data directory locally and not use a global configuration from AppData.\n- Note that while HDT indeed attaches to the first hearthstone instance found, this is always the instance that is \"the most recently started\". Thus by starting hearthstone and the corresponding HDT alternating, every HDT instance attaches to the correct Hearthstone instance.\nI agree that this is not an optimal solution. However, it works (I'm running that setup for multiple month now). Allowing multiboxing with a single instance of HDT requires some major reworking of existing systems, which is not feasible for the amount of users that will actively use that feature. I just proposed this change because some people over at reddit asked about HDT multiboxing and I wanted to provide my workaround that does the job for multiple month now (and because I'm lazy and I try to update HDT as infrequently as possible to not have to reimplement this feature).\nUltimately, it is not meant to be a major feature, but to provide a workaround for users that want to multibox, since the implementation of a real solution is just too much work.\n.

Oh dear, it appears that even with the beta2 you posted, I am still experiencing \"the opponent's card list is completely missing, including the % stats\" on new matches sometimes, but not all the time. The secrets list does also not appear when this is happening. I'm not sure what the cause may be. Will report back if I notice any patterns.\n. Okay, I figured it out, actually. I am using the option \"hide leftmost cards when friendslist is open\". If I open my friendslist and then click anywhere on the screen to close it, the UI stays hidden.

Cheers thanks for the tag.\nThis looks particular annoying, I'll get it fixed asap.\nCould you give me some examples of decklist sites and exact links that cause this behavior?\n. It's because the deckbuilding page uses a different function to import. I'll be taking a look into this tonight and hopefully fixing the issue assuming it's my end (99% sure it is).

I'm not home so can't check for a few hours.\nNetdeck shouldn't have any issues working with any new cards (except for non-english sites), so this caught me by surprise surprised.\nWithout checking the code I'm betting the issue is identical to #2384 if it's only HearthPwn.\n.

It does click, but just sligthy above where it is supposed to do it. It can also type in the correct name.\n.

Used the sync to upload v1.0.0 to hearthstats. Removed the lowest mana cost card, added a card from the next mana slot. Saved as v2.0.0 . Sync. Removed lowest card... saved as v3.0.0 ...Saved v3.1.0\nThe multiplicates are purely from deck tracker syncing.\n. v3.1 in tracker:\n\nAfter syncing to hearthstats, latest version:\n\n. http://hearthstats.net/profiles/69381?locale=en\n. I don't think this would ever be a fully automated thing. I would imagine that for the first run, it would take at least 10 inputs from the user. They would have to switch classes manually. \nAfter the first run, the user could manually trigger a re-scan (either full or only checking for cards not found in the user's library). Maybe also build in an option where you can manually add an individual card?\n. I made the same mistake. There are some hotkeys in the game. For instance, to export to hearthstone is 'alt' + 'x' + 'h'\nIf you press alt, the characters in the top menu become underlined etc...\n. For me, it is that the edit panel is larger than the standard window. If I click edit, the size of the tracker almost doubles in size. This often leads to having move the window as it will be partly of the screen. It also require you 'refocus' your vision and find the deck name. You also have to move your mouse a fair distance to click the save button. \nIts all really tiny stuff that doesn't matter, but it does lead to a (very) slightly diminished user experience. \n.

Good call :)\n. Ever thought about adding a menu option to either skip the \"export deckname to Hearthstone\" screen, or set the default option to export instead of cancel?\n. Its a super small thing that hadn't really bothered me too much before, but after exporting a bunch of times in a row it seemed worth a mention ^_^. \n. Control-s sounds like it should work 'globally' when the edit page is open. That actually makes a lot more sense. \nControl-enter is the same as submitting a comment and it felt right from being within the edit name textbox. Being able to save from anywhere would be better.\n. Hijacking this a little bit. @Epix37 Is there a way to show all decks (including archived) at one time?\n. And while I'm thinking about this, does a sort by last played/stats updated option make sense?\n.

I used the \"Import from Last Game\" option and then manually added the remaining cards if that helps.\n.

I have tried with it both enabled and disabled with no success, still get the same dialog box appearing and can't select a deck.\n. @Epix37,\nSo I played a game with my Shaman deck, with the Auto-select option checked and nothing happened.

Hi again,\nThe Auto deck selector doesn't seem to work if I just start a game with no deck selected and the Auto deck selector option checked. Nothing happens, no error message appears. If I select a wrong deck it will select the correct deck.\n. @Epix37 , ah ok, thanks.\n. @Epix37, I have minimal technical knowledge, but is there not some log file that has the Rank during the current game? Or is a screen grab the only way?\n. Might it not be easier then to maybe use the medal displayed after a game instead, since then there won't be any interfering lists or such.\n. For a completely different way of doing it, why not just let the user input their current Rank and stars and then calculate their subsequent ranks based on wins, losses, etc. I'm going to guess that it's quite possible to program things like win streaks and such?\n. Hahahaha, that worked, I feel like quite the idiot (although all my deck tags are gone)... Thanks. Would you happen to know what I accidentally clicked or changed for that to happen?\n. When I try export to Hearthstone it usually goes up to exactly 16 cards then stops. It also has told me that I don't own certain cards when I do in fact own them.\n. When I try export to Hearthstone it usually goes up to exactly 16 cards then stops. It also has told me that I don't own certain cards when I do in fact own them.\n. It would seem they don't, and there are games before the update that don't show either, so it seems that when the \"Rank\" isn't detected the app doesn't register the game as \"Ranked\".\n. Is there any way to make the past games without a Rank still reflect as Ranked games? Since currently those games aren't counting towards my Ranked statistics?\n. Since the Rank is \"-\" what do I change the Rank Filter to? Since currently it's L1 - 25.\n. Ah ok, thanks. I initially tried changing it to '0' but it didn't seem to like that.\n.

Minimize all windows is very annoying when you play HS just in background. If this is too much work in your opinion then maybe you can add these kind of behaviour to Hotkeys Events? It even fit with the rest of events. \nThere is already \"Show main window\" event to assign then maybe you could add \"Minimize main window\"  event? I would really appreciate this addition...\n\nGreetings!\n. I don't understand why \"Start Hearthstone\", \"Show main window\", \"Game Screenshot\" events from Options (hotkeys) have sense for you (all of them are also build into Windows or Game) but \"Minimize main window\" has no sense. This is the same value as Start HS, \"Show main window\". You can do these events also by clicking icons manually in Windows.\nBut I respect your decision. Thank you for great app, will donate again in the future for sure. Have a nice day! :)\n. Exactly, new version installer doesn't respect old HDT settings about custom Data folder so you lose all settings, decks etc. and have to copy them manually. This is very annoying.\nThanks for the workaround though.\n. ",
    "Mistrelvous": "Hmm.. if this is not happening for others, there might be another explanation.. It appears the changes I made to my deck in version 2.1 made it so the deck was the exact same composition as version 1.0. So, maybe having 2 versions of a deck with the exact same composition can cause the tracker to be confused and therefore not track match results altogether. I wish there was a way to delete a version of a deck (e.g. I want to delete version 2.1 but want to keep version 1.0 and 2.0) but I guess that is not possible right now. \nI'll try editing version 2.1 to be different from version 1.0 and then see if the match results from version 1.0 are being saved.\n. Just wanted to update you on this issue. I tried editing version 2.1 of my deck to be different from version 1.0 and then played a game with version 1.0 deck. The game was not recorded at all. During the game, the cards were being tracked but after the game, the deck tracker treated it like the game didn't exist at all.\nI looked at the log afterward and it was like I had nothing in the past 20 minutes:\n[9:38:30 AM] Helper: Checking for updates...\n[9:38:30 AM] Helper: Current version: 0.9.5.0\n[9:38:30 AM] Load: Copied log.config to C:\\Users\\owner\\AppData\\Local\\Blizzard\\Hearthstone\\log.config (AlwaysOverwriteLogConfig)\n[9:38:30 AM] Game: set CurrentGameMode to None\n[9:38:30 AM] Game: Done loading card database (enUS)\n[9:38:30 AM] Game: >>>>>>>>>>> Reset <<<<<<<<<<<\n[9:38:30 AM] OpponentSecrets: Cleared secrets\n[9:38:31 AM] Tracker: Set player itemsource as playerdeck\n[9:38:31 AM] Game: >>>>>>>>>>> Reset <<<<<<<<<<<\n[9:38:31 AM] OpponentSecrets: Cleared secrets\n[9:38:37 AM] Game: >>>>>>>>>>> Reset <<<<<<<<<<<\n[9:38:37 AM] OpponentSecrets: Cleared secrets\n[9:38:37 AM] Tracker: Switched to deck: Warrior\nI'm just going to delete the deck completely and save the old deck as a new one. It's not ideal but I don't know what else to do. \n. Hey Epix, I tried out the latest pre-release but I don't think the problem has been solved. Exporting worked great the first time but when I tried exporting another deck, the issue of the tracker occasionally selecting a random incorrect low mana card came up again. For example, in one of the decks I tried to export, it replaced Preparation (on my list) with Conceal (not on my list). Like I said, I can easily make the manual switch of changing Conceal to Preparation myself, but I'm not sure why the tracker chooses the wrong low mana card so frequently.  \nI tried a third time with the latest pre-release and the zero mana button being stuck issue happened. I took a screenshot of what I see after the tracker fails to import a deck after getting stuck on zero mana and I'm going to attach it to this message.\n\n. The 4th time I tried exporting, everything went smoothly, just like the first time. I am not sure what is causing the tracker to occasionally make export errors but sometimes it works smoothly, sometimes it does not. I wrote my initial message because it seemed to me that the instances of the tracker experiencing difficulty exporting decks occurs more often than exports running smoothly.\n. I tried lowering the speed to normal (60ms), but the same issues and inconsistency occurs. First attempt at exporting a deck, the deck loads 100% correctly. 2nd attempt, deck loads correctly except a random low cost card from the chosen class has replaced a card from my decklist. 3rd attempt, the tracker gets stuck on zero mana button and only cards with zero mana within the deck are loaded (pretty much exactly what happened in my screenshot above).\n@andburn My resolution is set to 1920 x 1080. As soon as I open Hearthstone, I set it to 1920 x 1080. This is because I don't run Hearthstone in fullscreen so the game leaves a blank spot under resolution when I open it. Thus, every time I open it, I make sure to set resolution to 1920 x 1080. \n@andburn I tried exporting in fullscreen as you suggested for my third attempt at exporting and the result was mentioned earlier in this message: the tracker got stuck on zero mana button and only cards with zero mana within the deck were loaded in the game. I'm not sure why you want me to post screenshots of the collection manager with zero mana selected and unselected. I know how to toggle mana selection. I never touch the mana selection button. When exporting however, the tracker does this on its own. It clicks the zero mana button twice to ensure that no single mana option is selected.\n. I think I found a solution to this issue. \nHere is what my export settings were when the issues were occurring:\n-Speed: Fast (40ms) \n-Wait: 0 seconds\n-Prioritize Golden Cards\n-Set Deck Name\n-Auto Clear Cards\n-Show dialog before exporting\nI then changed it to the following and so far, the tracker has been 100% successful after 4 tries:\n-Speed: Normal (60ms) \n-Wait: 1 seconds\n-Prioritize Golden Cards\n-Set Deck Name\n-Auto Clear Cards\n-Show dialog before exporting\nFor some reason, the wait \"1\" second option makes the export work flawlessly. That, or it is the combination of 1 second wait + 60ms speed setting. Or maybe I just got lucky 4 times in a row. Either way, I think setting the default options of the tracker when exporting decks to wait 1 second and also normal (60ms) speed might help other users not run into the problems mentioned above.\n. Thanks anburn, was freaking out about possibly losing the great-looking classic gems. :)\n. My HDT just crashes completely when I click Export. Never had a similar issue until most recent release.\n. ",
    "Taho22": "Having the same issue.  Tracker is not keeping stats for games played with v1.0 of a deck that I'm using.  Any work-around?  Should I just make it again or something.  What is the point of having versions if you cannot go back to play previous versions?\n. Sorry, I didn't see this in time and deleted the offending deck (all its versions).  I then recreated it with a new name.  After that, it seemed to be working correctly (only has 1.0 version now).\nThe offending deck had multiple versions which I had played and kept stats on, but I had never played version 1.0.  Then, I recently got the card I needed to complete the 1.0 version.  I switched to the 1.0 version.  The in-game card tracking would work correctly, but then no games/stats were being recorded.  It was like those games never happened.\nMaybe it has something to do with the fact that I never played the 1.0 version before I played other versions.\nIf I notice it again with a different deck, I will upload the file you are requesting.\n. ",
    "hauntedjuan": "Whoops. Sent it now.\n. The pleasure is mine!\n. ",
    "VicTT": "It sounds like the most reasonably compatible solution. Thanks for the fix!\n. I was thinking of doing just that, but then I thought that perhaps there are other people like me that don't always have their PC with them but still play HS whenever possible (work, school, friends, etc.) on other computers. Therefore, in order to keep their stats tracked, they would only have to upload the output_log.txt on their dropbox or whatever, and then use the Tracker to update their away-from-home progress. It's not a mandatory feature, but I have a few HS friends that play away from home; I couldn't speculate on just how widespread the phenomenon is, though I'm tempted to think that in corporate work environments where the user has no administrative privileges, this would come in very handy, as it is much easier to upload a file than to convince your boss that he should convince IT that Hearthstone Deck Tracker is something you can't do without. Does the Tracker currently ignore lines from loggers that it didn't register?\n. I second this request.\n. Yep. And on that note, the games didn't take 0 turns either. That's something I noticed a long while ago...assumed you were aware of it/fixing it..\nP.S. Looked for replays in replay folder; at least 2 of them (the Rogue ones at the bottom have replays). Also there's \"Halg(Druid) vs UNKNOWN HUMAN PLAYER(Shaman) 0235-080515.hdtreplay\" in the replay folder that's not showing up.\n. Also, when I reopened HDT, some Brawl decks that had stats before lost stats, including the ones that were \"recorded correctly\" today.\n. Thanks for the suggestion: you were right; it was not enabled. Before the update, I had logging enabled for every game mode, but Brawl must have got introduced in the last patch. This should be documented to prevent dupes from other people noticing this.\n. ",
    "mnixo": "Thanks!\nYeah, I thought it would make sense to make as a distinct option from the card counter but was unable to do it. As it is right now, it is being called in it's own option element, which I can't make it work (it doens't show up by itself), and in the card counter option element. What's left to do is to decide what method is the best.\n. I knew I was missing some sort of small detail. Awesome.\nEverything is in the right place now. I've also done some tests and everything seemed smooth. Ready to merge.\n. ",

    "ajukraine": "It would be wonderful feature, which gives the possibility to import existing logs into the tracker.

So I would like just to archive my logs, while I'm playing on Linux machine, and then import all of them on Windows machine. Thus I'll not loose my gaming history. I use it to track how good my improvements to decks are.\nWould it be possible to implement such a feature? If not, I'll try to allocate some time and try to do it on my own. But I guess, you can do that much faster then me.\n. ",

If there is only 1 needed and you have 0 it works properly.\nI tried it on an other machine, clean installion, but the result is the same.\nI use version 0.10.0.\nAlso the associated bugfix ebde19d seems to be unrelated.\n.

Maybe just make the \"Overlay\" the tab, as GiggliG suggested above, and then have a \"Decklist\" sub-category.\nFor a bunch of the options, try to avoid repeated words. That makes the options seem way more complicated than they are. Change: \"Record Ranked\", \"Record Arena\", \"Record Casual\", etc. to a bit of text that says \"Record the following game types:\", with the checklists saying \"Ranked\", \"Arena\", \"Casual\", etc. The \"Other/Tracker\" menu is way cluttered, break off stuff like \"AppData\" and \"Launch options\".\n.

    "Akejj": "Hey I got the same problem but the aero thing didn't fix it. It has something to do with my other monitor I feel like. I have a 2nd monitor which has native 1920x1080 resolution but is 60hz while my main monitor is 144hz. When I unplug my 2nd monitor hearthstone has max fps but whenever I plug my 2nd monitor in and have hearthstone + hearthstone deck tracker open the fps drops to ~79. Without hearthstone deck tracker the game runs smoothly. The same problem occurs while the game is ran in fullscreen or windowed mode. When in windowed mode the fps drops even more to ~55. Dropping the resolution to 1024x768 in the game and running it in windowed mode I get fairly high fps ~187.\nJust asking if there would be any other fix or suggestion. Thanks.\n. I don't know.. I have no idea what could cause that :/. I haven't changed any hardware, doubt it's about drivers because everything else runs smooth. Also I got a decent computer.\n. ",

So I fixed this issue with this and felt pretty silly that it was something simple and within instructions, However i ran into a different issue now. I was able to open HDT and create a deck and save it, as well as have it show up when i open hearthstone. But, that is the extent of this, it does nothing else past this and when i play the same deck in game nothing is tracked. It is the exact same issue as #369. I tried installing it on my laptop as well but no avail and i run into the same problem. I looked for a config.xml file and i seem to be lacking one to make the change you suggested as a fix in the other thread as well.\n. Fixed. Thanks!\n. ",

    "smikula": "That looks awesome!  The checkboxes to show or hide things like attacks/deaths/etc. would be perfect to get rid of the clutter, but you'd still have the option to see them if you wanted.\nNitpicky feedback: it would be great if each event could fit on a single line.  Maybe instead of using text like \"Play\" or \"HeroPower\" you could find a small icon that would represent each action.  And I don't think it would be a problem if the name of the card gets cut off; 99% of the time I'll know what something like \"Oasis S...\" is and you could show the full text on hover.\nI can't wait to see this in action!\n. GiggliG's color idea is a good one.  I was brainstorming about icons, but I don't have anything specific to point you to.  I'll see if I can find any, but might not have a chance for the next couple days.  (I do agree that if you keep the prefix the double lines look better.)\nI like the context menu.  (Maybe you could make it a \"Filter\" dropdown so people can discover it.)  Regarding groupings, I think the only one that seems weird to me is the \"play\" group.  If I had that checked, I'd expect to see ALL cards that get played, including secrets.  And I think you could even lump hero power into that group too.  And I assume \"summon\" means when a card summons a token, like Violet Teacher or Razorfen Hunter?  I'd probably make that a separate grouping instead of including it with plays.  (Imagine what the replay would look like after playing Onyxia!)\n. I'm loving the latest build!  This is going to be so much more useable for me.\nThe one issue I'm noticing is if I'm looking at a filtered set of events (Play + HeroPower) and I want to see more events to make sense of the turn I'm looking at.  I can think of two solutions:\n1) If I have a row selected and I change the filter, keep that row selected.  (And keep it scrolled to the same position in the view.)\n2) Have some option on the \"Turn X\" row to toggle showing all events for that turn.  Probably a bit more complicated, but gives you finer control over what you're looking at.\n. Yep, that's exactly what I meant.  Between that and once you get icons in, I think you've nailed everything I was looking for our of a replay viewer!\nHow are you doing on the icons?  Besides the ones you show above, here are a couple I was imagining.\nDiscard: Cards with a red X over them instead of + sign.  (Your + above could be green to contrast with it.)\nDeath: A black skull.\nHero power: A golden circle.\nSecret: A question mark.\n. Oh, play -- I forgot about that one!  I was imagining something like this: \nExcept, you know, nicer.  Sadly I'm completely inept when it comes to coming up with graphical stuff.  I am pretty good at searching for clip art and munging it to fit my needs, though.  :)\n. As a side thought: you have so many people using the deck tracker, I'm sure SOME of them have graphical talents.  Next time you post an update on reddit (or wherever) you could ask for help with icons and I bet people would jump at the chance.\n. Count me as a +1 for thinking plugins are a great idea.  I've been toying with the idea of building a metagame tracking website, and it would be awesome if a HDT plugin could submit game results every time a game finishes.\nI haven't had a chance to look at the HDT code much yet, but it sounds like you've already got most of what I'd need -- basically just an event every time a game ends and a way to get at the replay so I can see what cards got played.\nThe one other thing I can think of is some way to hook into the UI, like the way Hearthstats gets a dropdown off the main toolbar.\n.

I am testing now but pretty sure this is going to fix it for me since the game path was set wrong on mine. Thanks\n\nhttps://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/FAQ#not-working. For me it would be the left panel, look at the screenshot there is so much blank space. Maybe making the classes and the type of deck into drop down menus would allow that panel to be a lot less wide. Also could that same panel be resizable. Those same menu's could wrap down onto next line as it is made smaller. The same menus could also be moved up into the menu bar so the panel could be made smaller. Are you referring to the deck panel as the left or right? The list of cards is pretty important so I would rather the left panel was made smaller. Maybe these ideas will help. As for removing the new panel I haven't decided if I like it or not but I think I like it and don't want to turn it off. Thanks. Maybe in the mean time you could move the exit button over so it could be viewed.. Same here, not working with Monster Hunt.. Missed the other post, duplicate..

Yes. Here's what my typical deck creation process has been up till now.\nGo into game, create deck. Use HearthStats Companion to upload deck to HearthStats. Any revisions I make to the deck I do directly on the website because I have my doubts that the Companion would do versioning correctly.\nWhy I would love this to work is that the HearthStats Companion, for all it does well, has a number of outstanding bugs that I'm finding it harder and harder to put up with. I'd love one tool to do all my interaction with the site just the way you have set up. You seem to be much more responsive here, which is awesome.\n. Considering I haven't been using the Deck Tracker as intended just yet,\nthis won't be a problem.\nOn Sat, Apr 11, 2015 at 2:36 PM, Epix notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n:).\nThis issue is fixed for the next update. Minor problem will be, that if\nyou have 1.0, 1.1, 1.0 and sync, it will add 2.0 to the end, not replacing\nthe 2nd 1.0. There's not much I can do about that (I think). It will work\nas expected though, if the deck is synced \"from scratch\".\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/884#issuecomment-91896701\n.\n. I hate to reopen a ticket, but this is not fixed. Now, rather than not showing all versions of these decks, it doesn't sync ANY version of the deck at all. In fact, the mech mage deck I mentioned as an example isn't even in the list of decks available to be synced.\n\nIn fact, the only deck in my list that has more than one version is my mid-range druid, which has a 1.0 and a 1.1. After that, it seems to ignore every deck with multiple versions.\n. OK. I ran a full sync and it gave me a list of decks. I pulled them all in, and then the deck list shows as empty. If I close the app and re-open it, the decks are there, although with the versioning issue I mentioned.\nPastebin here: http://pastebin.com/WtL7Tfv3\nSo I then deleted all the decks and tried again. Again, the same basic stuff in the log. If I click on one of the class icons while the list appears to be empty, I get an appcrash with the following info: http://pastebin.com/QBxBWeUB\n. And I apologize if I seem as if I'm harping. I actually work in IT, and I don't want to be a problem customer!\n. This is probably the biggest one as far as impact goes for obvious reasons.\nAnother one.\nI've been trying to avoid changing the major version number of a deck since I found this app, so those are the only two I could find quickly.\n. I get versioning now. Yay!\nI still get the crash mentioned in the second pastebin above, but the log looks a little different now: http://pastebin.com/C7DiDBL3\nNote that it tries to pull a deck with no name toward the end of the log. I'm not sure if that means anything.\n. I have the same problem. Also, Issue #884 is not fixed. See my update to that ticket.\n. Good question! :)\nI have this problem when I have synced once and try to re-sync to see if it picked up missing deck versions. This is where it hangs as far as I can tell:\n[5:53:33 PM] Load: Copied log.config to C:\\Users\\Administrator\\AppData\\Local\\Blizzard\\Hearthstone\\log.config (AlwaysOverwriteLogConfig)\n[5:53:33 PM] Game: set CurrentGameMode to None\n[5:53:33 PM] Game: >>>>>>>>>>> Reset <<<<<<<<<<<\n[5:53:33 PM] OpponentSecrets: Cleared secrets\n[5:53:34 PM] Tracker: Set player itemsource as PlayerDeck\n[5:53:34 PM] Tracker: Switched to deck: Dubbel Chow-Rag Druid\n[5:53:34 PM] Game: >>>>>>>>>>> Reset <<<<<<<<<<<\n[5:53:34 PM] OpponentSecrets: Cleared secrets\n[5:53:35 PM] Helper: Checking for updates...\n[5:53:35 PM] Helper: Current version: 0.10.0.0\n[5:53:35 PM] BackupManager: Running BackupManager\n[5:53:35 PM] BackupManager: Creating backup for today\n[5:53:35 PM] PluginManager: Loading Plugins...\n[5:53:35 PM] Helper: Latest version: 0.10.0.0\n[5:54:31 PM] HearthStatsManager: starting sync process: forceFullSync=True, background=False\n[5:54:31 PM] HearthStatsManager: Checking HearthStats for new decks...\n[5:54:31 PM] HearthStatsManager: trying to download decks\n[5:54:31 PM] HearthStatsAPI: getting decks since 0\n[5:54:35 PM] HearthStatsAPI: error converting DeckObject: System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.\n   at Hearthstone_Deck_Tracker.HearthStats.API.Objects.DeckObject.ToDeck(CardObject[] cards, String[] rawTags, DeckVersion[] versions, String version)\n[5:54:36 PM] HearthStatsManager: There was an error syncing with HearthStats:\nSystem.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.\n   at Hearthstone_Deck_Tracker.HearthStats.API.HearthStatsManager.<>c__DisplayClass22.b__40(Deck localDeck)\n   at System.Linq.Enumerable.AllTSource\n   at Hearthstone_Deck_Tracker.HearthStats.API.HearthStatsManager.<>c__DisplayClass21.b__38(Deck deck)\n   at System.Linq.Enumerable.WhereListIterator1.MoveNext()\n   at System.Collections.Generic.List1..ctor(IEnumerable1 collection)\n   at System.Linq.Enumerable.ToList[TSource](IEnumerable1 source)\n   at Hearthstone_Deck_Tracker.HearthStats.API.HearthStatsManager.d__1.MoveNext()\n.

    "Wieners": "@culinko I linked that dude because I wouldn't be surprised if his game stopped working because of this program moreso than the keyloggers and viruses.\n@FenrisWolffe Why is it then that I've only started having problems with hearthstone after downloading this program? It has to have done SOMEthing. There is absolutely zero reason for my hearthstone to just randomly stop working after playing since like August 20th 2013. The only thing that I've recently done that is hearthstone related besides playing this game is get this program. Is that really a coincidence that my game would stop working at the same time? I should be able to play without this program running or even on my computer anymore yes? And I don't think you know what aggression is if that's what you're labeling my post as.\n. @culinko I'm very skeptical that it's the viruses and keyloggers when his game sounds like it's doing the same things as mine and we downloaded the same program and both had problems with hearthstone at pretty much the same time after downloading it. And the fact that he scanned and cleaned his computer and still has problems? Seems sketchy.\nAnd yes, the fact that you can get viruses and keyloggers (that get fixed by a simple scan & clean) that will do nothing to hearthstone, but apparently since I downloaded this program I can no longer play... I would have to say that this program was more harmful to my computer then any viruses or keyloggers would have been.\nBut who knows, maybe it's not the program. I'm very skeptical that it isn't. If you think you can help go for it.\n. @culinko \"As I told you in my previous post, if problems persist even if you close the tracker, the problem is not caused by tracker.\" \nDo you realize how frustrating this is to hear when I've played fine for literal years until the day I put this program on my computer? It's unfathomable that it isn't something this program has done. All I want to do is remove any trace of this program and pray that it's fixed afterwards.\nHere's the timeline of my hearthstone experience. \nAugust 20th 2013: Game runs smoothly on low and high quality.\nApril 10th 2015: Download HS tracker and try to use it, makes my game chug. \"Guess this program doesn't work on my comp.\" Uninstall it and then try to play hearthstone and the chug is still there, and WORSE.\nThen I start troubleshooting and i'm unable to find any idea of the problem so I post here.\n. @FenrisWolffe I've done this and it's still chugging. I don't know what to do.\n. @Epix37 Oh my god that fixed it. It's running smoothly again now. My computer is from 2008 and hasn't changed much besides me upgrading the ram from 4gb to 8, so it probably just sucks too hard to use it. Thanks a bunch though.\n. ",

Found a fix \nCheck all virus protection programs running on your pc and disable them or allow deck tracker through also if this does not work you can go to users your name mine is tony then app data find hearthstone folder blizzard and blizzard entertainment and delete them. \nThen re-download the game and re download deck tracker. Dont open hearthstone link deck tracker to open with hearthstone and find the file path also fix the log.config file again boot it up and your good to go. \nDeleting all folder will clear old cache folders and log folders and the game this fixes this issue. \nAgain thanks for all your support Epix37.\n.

    "pjbingham": "+1 for being able to delete deck versions\nOf the 2 options of how to do it. You have 1.0, 1.1 and 1,2:\n1. if you delete 1.1, you will remain with 1.0 and 1.2.\n2. if you delete 1.1, you will remain with 1.0 and 1.1 (the old 1.2 becomes the new 1.1).\nOption 2 seems the logical approach and the one for those (including me) who care about the numbering - it allows you to decide what deck is associated with a particular number and vice versa.\nMy use case:\nI want to be able to experiment with different variations of a deck, but only keep the increments for versions I play for any length of time.  At the moment I have decks where the relevant history is (e.g.) 1.0, 1.3, 1.7 (the intervening versions being the variations I tried out before settling on the next iteration of the deck).  Logically this is really 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 of course, but the numbering doesn't reflect that - i.e. there is a process, with changes of its own that I don't want to keep, I go through before settling on the next version.  At the moment I can't use the deck tracker to reflect this.\n. Thanks for getting back on this so soon.  I guess I'll just log HDT out of hearthstats and leave it that way then. \nCouple of questions about your future plans:\n- would (or could) it be an option to upload one's entire HDT history once you get the HSReplay.net based personal stats up and running (migrating from hearthstats not an option for me as it's turned into such a mess - I'm wondering if I'm not the only one).  It would be nice to have the history.\n- do you have feel for when the HSReplay.net based personal stats are likely to be up and running - will be keen to try it out of course!\n. > Not sure it'll be possible to import from Hearthstats. Hearthstats gathers a lot less information about games than we do on HSReplay.net (in fact, it doesnt even gather the game's contents). \nNot an issue for me - my hearthstats data was all corrupted anyway - hence the questions.\n\nWe'll do stats over any game you have on your account!\n\nThis sounds great stuff (I'm in!) - and I'm liking the features implemented so far too - for games uploaded so far and in the future.  However, the history is important too for the stats to be useful - and there are a lot games in it...\n\nBut if you have game replays on HDT, those can be imported into your HSReplay.net account by simply opening the replay from HDT and viewing it, as this is the new replay viewer. \n\n... so I think importing all that history one at a time wouldn't be feasible.  I think a batch upload would be essential - could it be a possibility?\nShould I be logging this feature request elsewhere on github or was it already implied within your plans for stats?\nI can't remember - does HSReplay also import decklists so you can refer to, share, etc. like the games themselves?\netc. etc. - actually, it's occurred to me I'm setting about basically just asking \"will it do all the same things hearthstats did?\" Hearthstats had a great featureset.  It's a shame it got sold then left to die by its new owners.  Are you using it as a model or starting point for your intended new featureset, or taking a different approach?\n\nNo idea, sorry, we have a bunch of open threads right now but it's currently at the top of the list. If you know Python, you can help - it's open source :)\n\nI wish.  Sadly only know enough about Python to be dangerous, I suspect, at the moment (and time is a factor for getting better - it's not the day job sadly).  I'll spread the word though.\n. I agree the use case is similar to #1413 .  Apologies I missed that one.\nI did find #2110.  Agree the use case relating to operators there is also relevant, but (personally) I'm not interested in being able save combinations of tags myself - so wasn't sure whether to raise a separate case for the NOT operator (only).  Erred on the side of caution...\nWhat's the view - is this something you're think would be good and/or looking at adding?. ",

    "OriginalAlienOne": "It seems to be fine now after a major windows update (I'm on Windows 10 Insider) and a restart to the computer.\n. I came on here to echo that I'm experiencing the same issue when playing a Shaman deck... What I've found is that if I play a joust card that draws a card for me and then places it back in my deck, the deck tracker shows it as having been drawn and no longer in the deck. So, when the card is actually drawn, the deck tracker freaks out and then keeps asking me what deck I am playing. The only thing I can do is exit out of the box, which disables the auto deck selection feature. If I select which deck I am playing, the pop-up will just re-appear in one second after a flash.\nI have a feeling that this might have something to do with a legendary minion being drawn during the joust mechanic, and then the deck tracker thinks it has been drawn. When I actually draw the card and have it placed in my hand, the deck tracker thinks that I must be playing another deck, because I can't have two of the same legendary in my deck.\n.

Auto-deck just doesn't always automatically select a deck, so I have to Alt-Tab out of the game to manually select the deck.\n. No\n. I'm sorting by \"Last modified\" for now, which is roughly similar to \"Last played\" for me.\n. Is syncing to Hearth Stats still not working for anyone else? The site itself is up, but syncing still doesn't seem to work.\n. These are Arena runs that were uploaded a few weeks ago so I don't think they are related to the recent problems.\nOkay I will do them manually if there aren't too many of them.\nAre there potential problems with resetting on the Hearth Stats website and then force syncing in HDT though?\n. This needs a few more fixes too.\nLike: If Duplicate is used by the opponent, then HDT should know what the two created cards are. It displays the \"created card\" symbol, but hovering that should show exactly what card they are. It doesn't seem to do that right now.\nThe same goes for King Mukla, who gives the opponent two bananas. Those bananas should be explicitly marked as bananas somehow, such as when hovering.\n. Probably better to not even bother guessing what card was given to the opponent, because if it's wrong then it can be misleading and therefore possibly dangerous. If you assume that the card the opponent was given is +1 Attack because HDT says so, for instance, then you would play around that, etc.\n. Also, for the Cutpurse card, when it attacks a Hero, it awards its user with a Coin. HDT should immediately mark the card given to the opponent as a Coin, since it obviously is one.\n. Sure, a different indicator would be fine, too. But I think an indicator is still necessary.\nHow does the concede indicator work? I assume that the logs indicate that the opponent conceded?\nCouldn't a disconnect be determined by simply checking the logs to see if the game ends when one of the players has a life total of 0 or less? If the game ends where both players still have more than 0 life, then surely that means that there was a disconnect.\n. The colored borders are hardly noticeable. I just went to check them out right now because I never realized they were there.\n. I tried that before but couldn't find it (and still can't). Strange.\n. Yep I'm seeing this too. It seems to think Arena games should reward the 10 gold for every 3 wins, when it shouldn't.\n. Yes, or Spellslinger too.\nOkay, I look forward to using this feature more. It's definitely the most useful feature that I overlooked (because of all the big warning signs on the page where you enable this feature). The most useful feature of HDT overall, that is probably not as well known as it should be, is the replay feature.\n. Yep I've been having this problem too recently. I'm not sure what causes it, or how to fix it. I usually just try a combination of restarting Hearthstone, HDT, etc. until it's fixed.\n. I noticed that when this problem happens, it seems to be because the last recorded game was not completely recorded. For instance, in the last game that was recorded before it kept getting recorded multiple times, the log finished on Turn 10 even though the game ends around Turn 15. So to fix the problem, I had to remove the game from HDT so that HDT wouldn't continuously try to \"complete\" that game.\nIt looks like your latest changes should fix this, so hopefully it does indeed.\n. No\n. I haven't had a crash when adding Arena games, but I've had problems adding Arena games nonetheless, lately.\nI've got the setting to \"auto-import Arena games\", so when I choose the 30th card in an Arena game, it should automatically import in HDT. This works about 75% of the time. The remaining 25%, HDT will, for some reason, not recognize one or two cards, which are usually the 3rd copy of a specific card. So for instance, if I drafted 3 Flamestrikes, then HDT sometimes won't auto-import the game. So when I go to manually import it, it will indeed say \"29 / 30 cards\", and then I notice that Flamestrike only says \"2\" in HDT when it should be 3, so I fix that manually.\nHopefully this latest change fixes that too.\n. They were already exported to HS, on the same day I checked for this option. I did, however, save them as v1.1, after I made some changes, but I don't think that matters? If I recall, HDT still noticed the changes for one deck comparing my 1.1 to the original from the web.\n. HDT crashes for me every time I play the new Tavern Brawl released today. It uses two unique heroes, so I'm guessing that could be the problem. HDT only crashes when the game ends.\nThe game doesn't crash in ranked games.\n. I've already got that enabled but it still didn't highlight the cards.\n. No, duration is fine, and game mode is fine. The problem just happened now again, in an Arena game, with the latest HDT version that's supposed to fix bugs where HDT can't recognize the end of a game.\nAbout 10% of my games are not saved properly in HDT. It might be because, if I finish a game and want to see the replay, I'll immediately tab out of the game after returning to the Hearthstone main menu, and perhaps this doesn't give HDT enough time to properly save the game?\n. Yes that's possible that the name is too long. Like you've done, is probably best to include the version number and trim the name, since the user expects the version number to be there if they have it checkmarked. It'll be obvious to the user that the name was trimmed, and so they'll probably figure out the reason for that.\n. Yes same issue. I'm not sure why the other issue was closed though when it hasn't been resolved yet?\n. @imsomony You don't have to do it that way. You can just import the deck into HDT, edit the deck, remove Geddon, then re-add him. Then it will export just fine.\n. Yes, would be nice if it was very obvious when the highlight is active on Reno.\n. Also a similar issue, is that the stats for vs. class have the % symbol but the stats for the deck doesn't, at least when the score is 0-0 for each.\n. Same problem with me. I attacked a Silver Hand Recruit with my Muster for Battle weapon and the Avenge didn't grey out, with multiple enemies on the board. I'm using the latest HDT version as of a few minutes ago.\nSorry I forgot the turn; I'm not at my PC at the moment. It's near the end of the game I think. If you search for \"Muster\" then it should be near there.\nGary(Paladin) vs Thorad(Paladin) 2230-290116.hdtreplay.zip\n. Yes that's what I'd like @knoxius. It should only scan Constructed decks in Casual/Ranked, and Arena decks in Arena.\nI mentioned this issue before; at the time, the issue was that an Arena deck was auto-selected when I was playing in Ranked, and that was fixed, but this current related issue still exists.\n. I've had weird problems with HDT since about a week ago with the latest version, as well. For instance, once during a game, when the opponent had an empty hand, HDT thought they still had 3 cards in hand, so every card they drew added +1 to that total. Then at the end of that game, HDT wouldn't show the overlay for future games anymore, until I restarted both HS and HDT.\nI do use Innkeeper. I don't think I started it within the past week though, so I haven't given it a chance to auto-update. \nWhat conflicts does Innkeeper have with HDT? I don't run Innkeeper all the time; I only run it to upload my cards to HearthPwn, then close it. So that shouldn't be a problem?\n. For decks and arena, we can just show stats from a specific X date to today, but not a rolling date range of the past X days though. So we always have to change the X date every once in a while.\n. Yep I've got the same problem. Opponent deck list no longer disappears when opening friends list. This started a few versions ago, like the OP.\n. I tried all those suggestions and none of them fixed the problem. I've been using Flux for years, but didn't used to have this problem with HDT before. Enabling \"Alternate screen capture\" still doesn't hide the opponent's deck list when I open my friends list.\n. I found the problem. It's because I have the opponent's deck list set to align vertically in the middle, yet HDT probably still thinks that the list is at the top. So only after there's a few cards in the list, then opening the friends list will hide the deck list. \nSo the setting to hide the opp. deck list needs to take into account whether the user is vertically aligning the opponent's deck list.\n. How about keeping the config files in Dropbox and then creating a Windows symlink from the original HDT config location to the Dropbox location, so HDT can't tell the difference?\n. If I set it to Always On, though, then does it still appear if I don't even have C'Thun in my deck?\n. Okay then I think \"Always\" should just keep it visible only when C'Thun is in your deck, regardless of whether it's alive or dead. Also, \"Always\" should also keep the C'Thun counter visible even before I play my first C'Thun minion, because I notice that the counter doesn't appear until then.\nThere doesn't seem like any reason at all to show the C'Thun counter if you don't even have him in your deck.\n. I just played a game where I played C'Thun with zero buffs, as a vanilla 6/6. This was with a Renolock deck, so it is possible to never draw any C'Thun cards, however unlikely that is. I played him because the opponent was playing Zoolock and filled the board with tentacles, so even 6 missiles was good enough in that situation. \nSo there are definitely times when you play C'Thun with no buffs. And so it gets weird when you have a game where he is played, and the counter doesn't even appear when he's played. Which is why the counter should immediately appear when HDT recognizes that my deck is a C'Thun deck.\n. The C'Thun counter should absolutely remain on the board during the entire game, for the player if C'Thun is detected in their deck, and for the opponent if they have played at least one C'Thun buff card, or C'Thun itself.\nI say this because I just had a game vs. a Priest who entombed my C'Thun, then played their own C'Thun, I killed that, then the counter disappeared. Then they played their second C'Thun, but the counter was gone by then. Let's say the C'Thun counter was at 16, and I was at 15 health with an empty board, then I could have armored up as a Warrior to prevent lethal, for instance.\n. Yep \"auto\" was enabled at the time. And I always check that it's enabled.\n. Yeah I just played Brawl just now, and still HDT doesn't ask for a deck. I included a log. I've had this problem for weeks.\nGame log.txt\n. So if I want cards to appear in my deck list, then I have to enable the \"show obtained cards in my deck\" setting? The reason I keep that off is because it clutters up my deck list way too much, when I want to see how many outs I have for draws, etc. Especially when playing Renolock, where the deck list is already long, adding more cards is a problem. \nSo that's why I think it's best the way it was before, where if you're in no-deck mode and \"show obtained cards in my deck\" is disabled, then cards still appeared, because they aren't obtained. Unless they still come from Discover, of course.\n. Okay if it's just this one brawl then that's fine. \nI'll try and test no-deck mode when I have time, by playing a deck that isn't in HDT.\n. #1 is not fixed. #2 is fixed.\nPlaying the current brawl still doesn't ask me if I want to change to no-deck mode. But brawl cards now do appear in my deck list if I'm in no-deck mode.\nEDIT: Nevermind #1 is fixed too. I just had to play out one turn, but that's fine.\n. Yeah I think it makes more sense for him to appear as himself rather than the card he transformed into, because ultimately I think it's best to know what cards the opponent purposely put in their deck, so we can then deduce why they did it, etc. and try to figure out their game plan.\n. I'm pretty sure that HDT does not know that the opponent didn't have C'Thun. HDT only knows what the servers tells it. The reason it didn't show the counter is because this is basically a bug.\nIn my opinion, HDT should have showed the C'Thun counter once they have a minion that buffs C'Thun, like in your case. HDT should assume that the opponent is playing a C'Thun deck once they have any minion that buffs C'Thun, since that's the safer assumption than not doing so. I have definitely played C'Thun without ever playing any C'Thun buff cards, although yes it is rare.\n. One thing I noticed was that in the current Brawl, I played as Warlock and I played a C'Thun buff card. The image of C'Thun did not appear as it normally does. So it only appears if I have C'Thun in my deck? Then if HDT could somehow piggyback off of that animation, and only show the counter when that graphic appears, then that would make sense too.\nNote that I was in no-deck mode since I was playing a Brawl, so HDT couldn't have known if I had C'Thun in my deck or not.\n. How would HDT auto-detect Yogg unless he's already played by the opponent...?\n. You'd need someone to manage this in the long term otherwise it'd be a useless feature. Not really worth it. \n. You'd need someone to manage this in the long term otherwise it'd be a useless feature. Not really worth it. \n. Got a log or screenshot of this? I can't imagine how HDT could know the result? What card did it end up being?\n. Attached\nTavern Brawl HDT game log.txt\n. Yeah the dialog came up when I just tried the Brawl again. It seems like the dialog comes later if I go second.\n. Yeah that was the reason I suggested this. The brackets often take up more space than the deck name's max length in HS. Of course I know I can remove these manually, but they are in about 50% of the top decks on Hearthpwn, and they rarely contain useful information, as you can see from my examples.\n. @azeier does it perhaps also make sense to add a counter for the next Jade Golem size, for both the player and opponent? Similar to the C'Thun tracker, where it only appears for the player if they have a Jade card in their deck, or for the opponent when they play a Jade card.\nAlso, when the opponent shuffles 3 copies of Jade Idol into their deck, HDT only shows 1 copy as shuffled rather than 3.. So the secret will not activate if the opponent does not have any minions in their hand after I play a minion, so it becomes difficult to determine if the secret did not activate because it's not Hidden Cache, or if the opponent simply does not have a minion in hand? Ah, okay.. Yes that's what I meant. I know that it makes a 1/1 copy. So that's a clue that that minion is in the deck, and HDT should reflect that.. @judge2020 What known bugs are there with the old replay viewer? Or possible bugs that can crop up in the future? Also, I noticed that my hand is at the top of the replay and the opponent is at the bottom, even when this wasn't the case before. It should be flipped to reflect the position in the actual game.\n@jleclanche Yes up/down arrow helps. Although it'd still be nice to have a scrollable list of events so I can scroll it and immediately see where Flamestrike was used, for instance, and click to get there.. @tympollack That's a problem that can't be fixed as far as I know, since HDT doesn't know if the opponent has a minion in their hand. Hidden Cache does not activate if the opponent does not have a minion in their hand.. Yep that fixed it.. ",

I've only just started using it so it's hard for me to say, some threads reference this from months ago though. \nDo we think this may be an SSD related issue? (Obv to do with the logging itself). As my PC is a beasty x64, 4.2ghz I7 Hex core, 16GB RAM etc, but lags like shit with every action (attacking with a minion, playing a card etc), but no SSD. My girlfriend's PC that is far worse has an SSD, and she has no lag / choppiness at all.\nPresuming I shouldn't have to exclude this in Windows Defender, if it is turned off?

Opened my pack, then tried again (without closing HS), still had the lag. \nAgain, this is COMPLETELY FINE on my girlfriend's PC, though she has both HS and the log running on her SSD. Same windows version, and less powerful hardware than mine. I'll try post her specs tomorrow.\n. Meh it's getting on a bit now, but 3gb vram (2 chips on the one card), and it still runs everything I've threw at it on ultra. My monitor is 120fps too and I always get a decent framerate. \nStill though this is to do with HS itself, not graphical issues, it's purely the logging that's the problem. And yeah for now I've just disabled the logging and running without the tracker. Shame though as it's really good.\nI've also now excluded \" \\Hearthstone_Data\\output_log.txt\" in both Norton and Windows Defender (Though I have the latter disabled), I'm not sure but it may have felt there was a slight reduction in the lag, but there was still a noticeable 1-3 sec delay when hitting with a minion or performing an action.

Can't see why they can't have a \"combat\" log, and \"debug\" log setting. \nYeah logging isn't officially supported for what we're using it for, but considering how popular deck trackers and the like are with streamers, it would be silly for them to ignore it.\n. Cheers Irifus. \nCan we give an increased buffer size a try?\n. Does v0.10.17  include this?\nI understand that it's likely the HS logging that's the issue. However it would be good to give it a try with the buffer increased on this end too. \nDoubt Blizz will ever sort it, but at least we can badger them about it then.\n. Before change: It lags up 1-2 secs when playing a card, attacking, and when damage is dealt / minion dies. If I'm clicking too much then Windows thinks HS isn't responding. FPS is definitely affected as I can actually regrow the veg on the Pandaria map heh, (I usually have >60fps so there's a bug in HS where it doesn't regrow).\nAfter change: As far as I can tell, there's now no FPS drop/lag at all! DT didn't show anything though as you mentioned.\nWould be nice to test the buffer thing anyway, post back when you've put up a new version, cheers. (Disabled my Norton autoprotect too, but encountered no difference before changing those parameters).\nThen again if fileprinting is on, and consoleprinting is off, doesn't that mean logging to the hard disk isn't actually the problem? (So changing the IO buffer wouldn't affect that), for me at least.\nHere's my log.config:\n[Zone]\nLogLevel=1\nFilePrinting=true\nConsolePrinting=false\nScreenPrinting=false\n[Bob]\nLogLevel=1\nFilePrinting=true\nConsolePrinting=false\nScreenPrinting=false\n[Power]\nLogLevel=1\nFilePrinting=true\nConsolePrinting=false\nScreenPrinting=false\n[Asset]\nLogLevel=1\nFilePrinting=true\nConsolePrinting=false\nScreenPrinting=false\n[Rachelle]\nLogLevel=1\nFilePrinting=true\nConsolePrinting=false\nScreenPrinting=false\n[Arena]\nLogLevel=1\nFilePrinting=true\nConsolePrinting=false\nScreenPrinting=false\n. Ahh I see, so it likely is those log files then. Hmm well it's narrowed it down at least.\n. Interesting. Nice testing you did. I only excluded the Hearthstone and Log Files folders, from both Norton and Windows Def (though I have the latter switched off, and Norton doesn't seem to make a difference).\nI had no lag at all with only FilePrinting on.\n. Looks to be working! Just played two games (innkeeper and play mode) with HDT on and working, and no visible lag! \nThere was obviously still an FPS drop in general as I could regrow the veg in the pandaria map, however it didn't affect my play at all. \nSo what's changed, Hearthstone was reading/writing to a single, huge log file (and you reading it) was causing the lag, we're now using multiple, smaller files and reading from those (with a larger buffer to accommodate too)? \nNote: At first I thought this was shipped without the .exe, but my Norton was quarantining it heh. So those with Norton Internet Security on Aggressive, you may need to restore it from quarantine. \n. Aye thanks a lot mate, I'm betting this will solve it for the majority of cases. It's certainly 100% tolerable for me now, and I can now play with the veg XD\nI'll give this version a play with and report any issues. Looked fine on my last game though.\n. Using 0.10.19 atm and seems to be ok so far. Just won 1 ranked game though and the gold tracker still says 0/3? Deck stats correctly show 1-0 though.\n. Yep I do. Switching it off removed the Coin from the tracker, but my Silverback Patriarch (obtained from a Webspinner) still showed in the tracker, and highlighted in green, even after it was played, and died.\nI presumed Include Obtained would just mean those cards appear in my deck in the tracker? But would still be greyed out / de-highlighted in the normal way as the Obtained cards were played.\nGold tracking now works btw! <3 Also see my mail about the FPS improvement.\nI'd test more (such as with Unstable Portal and so on), but need some sleep.\n. Yeah I understand that. Obtained cards being added to the tracker deck and highlighted when drawn works correctly.\nI'd expect them to be de-highlighted and greyed out when played though (as with other cards) if that's possible, rather than still showing as if they're in my hand. \nTurning the Obtained option off would just not show them at all ya? (Not what I want)\nAnd yep I'll keep an eye out as I use more webspinners / portals etc. :) \nAn easy way of testing would probably be to do the Webspinner or Portal challenges in the Naxx / Blackrock levels?\n. Yep, just tested vs High Justice Grimstone, all cards summoned from portals appear correctly in hand, but stay highlighted in green even after they're played. As the posted above notes, this causes confusion between what I have in my hand, and what I \"Obtained\" but have already played.\nI'd expect them to be greyed out when played, as with other cards. Maybe use a symbol to designate obtained (as with enemy cards), OR keep them highlighted, but change the colour. \n. ",

Default and current \nlanguages are french but some of the keys sent to hearthstone seem to be \nthe US equivalents : cf [12]Basic naxxramas transformed in hearthstone \nin )&\u00e9^Basic xxx : & and 1 are on the same key, 2 and \u00e9 too, the \nbrackets i don't understand the translation but there must be a logical \nreason :)\nIf i can be of any help to resolve this, please tell.\nHastur.\nLe 07/07/2015 18:08, andburn a \u00e9crit :\n\n@Epix37 https://github.com/Epix37 is the one responsible for this \ngreat app. I'm just helping out :smile:\nYour attachments don't seem to have made it to github, maybe only Epix \ngets them. If you could post the information here directly I might be \nable to get to the bottom of it.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub \nhttps://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/1123#issuecomment-119252828.\n. Hi\nLooks like second option was the one which works.\nThanks a lot.\nI'll have to check what's done when that box is not checked :)\n\nLe 09/07/2015 15:48, andburn a \u00e9crit :\n\n@hastuur https://github.com/hastuur I am not really sure what is \ncausing the problem, but there are a few things you can try:\n1. Make sure you are using the latest version of the tracker\n   (0.10.7). Press the /help/ button the version is shown at the\n   bottom left.\n2. Go to |Options > Tracker > Exporting| and check /Paste names from\n   clipboard/, this can help in exactly this situation.\n3. If the previous two options don't work it must be something to do\n   with Windows and the language/keyboard set up.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub \nhttps://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/1123#issuecomment-119974525.\n. \n",

From what I can tell, the issue lies with the fact that the Application uses D3D9. Windows 10 doesn't seem to support it very well, and OBS definitely doesn't work with D3D9 + Windows 10 nicely...\nEdit: After some experimenting, I found out that the lack of a window causes it to be uncapturable (on windows 10 at least). I added a window to it and took off \"Allow Transparency\" and it captures perfectly. Now of course, this ruins the overlay so I have to find a better solution to fix it for Windows 10, but at least I've isolated the issue.\n. That's what I was using, but I wanted the overlay itself because of how nice it looks personally. So I modified the original app code and added a compatibility window. Basically, all it does is sit behind Hearthstone. It's a full window so it captures, and you can chroma key the black caused by the lack of texture, or if I really wanted to, I could add a real color to chroma out. It work for what it needs to and it doesn't add much extra memory usage. What I might do is actually add a full implementation of it with a toggle in the settings, then make a pull request with it. For now, it's getting late, and until I know it's stable, i'm gonna keep it personal.]\nIn terms of OBS and transparent windows, it has support for PNG's, alpha backgrounds on webpages and such, but the issue at the root is that the window is a WindowStyle.None window which causes the capture issue. It SHOULD capture the text with a black screen if that's the case (from the way I see it), but it doesn't.\n. I've decided to go down the plugin route for this. I introduced the idea to Kripparrian (where I did integrate it), but he stuck with the Player/Opponent Window, so now, I'm making it into a plugin :)\nI'm also doing something no one else has (see screenshot below):\nNote the extra TreeViewItem... http://stdscatchemall.com/Screenshots/Hearthstone_Deck_Tracker_2015-08-15_12-50-28.png\nIt was a PAINNNNN at first to capture the TreeView, but once i found a method to do it, it's now super easy :D\n. At this point, I'm just trying to think of what other settings to add to it. Since i made a direct copy of OverlayWindow (in order to preserve functionality, and change a few settings to accommodate the window size and a couple of other things), it maintains all the same functionality as you change the overlay settings. So I can't really think of anything other than what I've got... \n. Plugin is added to available plugins page! \n. I just realized that I forgot to request that you update MahApps to the most recent version. There were some issues compiling with the old version when I made the program. The latest version works fine with the application :) My plugin won't show up in the plugins list because it's running on the newer version :(\n. Yeah, it's on 1.1.2, and the issue seems to have gone away. It seemed like it was a bug with the project or something, don't really know. It's gone. I'm trying to determine why it won't show up in the plugins list, and will update the wiki as soon as I fix it!\n. K. I've officially stopped bouncing back and fourth on this. It's working now :D\n.

you have stuttering then opening a pack and see if you still have stuttering, that oddly fixs it for me atm as long as i dont close and reopen HS.  at some point it would be nice to do a poll for what hard wear ppl have and OS softer running in the background to try and work out some common ground. \n. imo with the testing i have done its the game thats stuttering as its out putting the logs not

I do the same when I am in a lost position.\nWins and losses due to loss of connection are different. I have \"won\" games that I should have lost when my opponent disconnected, and lost games that I should have won when my connection failed.\nMy preference would be to have separate marks for concede and disconnect. If only one mark is possible, then a mark for disconnected games would, in my opinion, carry more value than a mark for conceded games.\nObviously, I have no idea whether it is at all possible to extract disconnects from the log files HDT uses. :)\n. Thanks, Megablue! I guess that your log file can be a great help for Epix in finding the issue. I checked my log directory and found nothing, but I did find XML files for all games played, including the ones that failed. I have uploaded the last game to http://www.juti.nl/hugo/Game_341f0794-9e69-45ad-bcb1-67919c1717cf.zip .\nI did not try restarting HDT during the game, figuring that starting HDT mid-game would confuse it even more. Thanks for confirming that.\nOn your suggestion that it might be related to jousting: I checked the decks I used the two times it happened. The first time I did not have any joust cards (but my opponent might). The second time I did have a joust card. Not sure if I played it when the error occured, I will definitely watch what happens to HDT before and after playing joust cards from now on.\n. Some more observations:\n1. It does indeed appear to be related to jousting. Just had it happen again, and it did start after the joust.\n2. Not 100% sure yet, but it appears that once the game is over, HDT will recover even if you just start a new game, without quitting and restarting HS and/or HDT.\n. Wow, that is fast - I am impressed!\nThanks for all your good work, Epix!\n. I don't know where I can find the version number, but I never knowingly installed a pre-release and I assume that those will not be used by the auto-updater, so probably 0.10.16.\nI have run into the #1399 bug as well, but after reading the feedback here I have disabled the automatic deck selection, and now that behaviour is no longer happening for me.\n. I was going to comment that all these cards have in common that they are Rare and from the Classic set. However, the report by PhateREF changed that - Naturalize is also a Classic card, but it's of Common rarity.. ",

    "pagem": "Better than having a note pop-up could the underlying deck list have additional metadata about cards to mulligan for and based on the opponent class highlight these cards in the decklist for the initial turn and also highlight them in the opening hand?\nTo work really well I guess there would need to be changes to the metadata feed from sites like Hearthpwn to include mulligan info in the original data feed so maybe too much work...\n. Agree it is more complicated than just providing facility to see a custom note but the idea with inclusion in the underlying deck meta data is that this information could travel with the deck list from sites such as HWPWN. \nThis does mean, it is probably even more complicated, it needs support from the deck listing sites.\nI have posted a question on some other forums regarding use of or defintion of a standard data format for decklists. So far no response but I thought that if a well used tool such as HDT (this) defined and enabled mulligan info in an underlying decklist data structure and the exporting of said data structures then deck listing websites may well update their software to support it.\nKind of \"if you build it they will come\".\nMy biggest concerns with the pop-up note idea are\n1) Effort required to complete the note as some decks can be complex and listing against different opponent classes may require long notes\n2) Pop up on has to be shown on an already overlay heavy screen - of course this depends on how this additional overlay is shown\nNot saying that the note idea is wrong or a bad one btw ;) Just my thoughts.\n.

Played against a mage and won so went to 3-0 and this showed in the game tracking against the deck in HDT, but when I look at the stats there is nothing showing for Arena runs today.\nThen played a Constructed game as hunter. Played against a mage and won. And checking the Constructed stats the game details are showing together with my custom notes. So no issue recording and showing stats for constructed just arena in this instance.\nAttached is the log file.\nhdt_log.txt\n. Duplicate of #2653 ?\n. Was there a fix for this issue?\nI just noticed that since last update my stats are gone under the stats tab. Nothing for Arena or Constructed.\nI had this same problem several years ago and it seemed to go away.\nNote: I don't use the full stats much these days instead I use the stat pane that appears when you select a deck.

Card Z lasted on the board an average of 2.6 turns.\n... etc ...\nI don't want to take too much of your time, but do you feel the xml Power.log implementation from HearthSim is far enough along (or stable enough) to begin developing against? IE, I can use the above tool to generate my own xml from my Power.log, and then once HDT begins saving replays in that form it will be easier for users to contribute. I assume the goal is for HDT to export in a compatible format or is even a direct C# port.\nIs this something you feel would be valuable to include in HDT either as a plugin or as part of the core (similar to contributing to Hearthstats)? Maybe time will have to tell how successful my project is before \"dirty-ing\" your codebase.\nEdit: For backwards compatibility purposes, it may be a good idea to use the output_log.txt included in your existing replays, parse those myself. Straight from the horse's mouth as they say. I'd also look toward the future and implement the power.log xml implementation.\n. ",

I've started developing something for my own purposes that's similar to what @SpectralCoding is suggesting, a plugin for HDT that calculates different metrics based on replays of games. Examples of metrics I've been thinking about are: win rate when specific card is played, how well it trades (2 for 1), (3 for 1), or card advantage (either draw or put something into play).\nIf either of you are interested in collaborating or working on this together let me know. Right now I've just been using it myself since it runs quite slowly (Goes through each KeyPoint of each Replay extracting statistics), but I want to release it open source eventually as well.\n. ",

Redemption and Effigy will not trigger if there are 7 minions in play after the deathrattle. The code as written assumes these secrets always trigger on minion death.\nNot sure how to fix. Could create a list of minions with \"deathrattle: add minion to play\", but sounds annoying to maintain. We listen for the Tag change to identify minion death, but I couldn't identify where the \"minion deathrattle about to happen\" state is stored. Any ideas?\n. I don't remember seeing this number. It lists the total number of secrets your opponent has in play?\n. Here's a UI change which would allow the player to extract the most amount of information, but still be easy to use:\nWhen the player puts their mouse on one of the opponent's individual secrets (the question mark bubbles near the opponent), the available secrets list changes - instead of showing the aggregate view, it shows you the possibilities for that single secret.\nWhen the player's mouse is anywhere else, it shows what it shows today.\n.

Just to provide an additional idea: I applied the symlink method using Microsoft OneDrive instead of Dropbox - and on quick glance it does seem to work well (at least between my Laptop and my main PC).\nHowever, I haven't tried this syncing to a Surface yet, but might try that as well as soon as I have the opportunity to do so.\n. OK thanks for the feedback. I have been searching whether this topic was discussed already but obviously have missed the threads you linked. So sorry for opening a duplicate issue.. Sure, the full deck string from when I encountered the issue most recently (today) is below.\nHowever, this is just one example. In general, I'd say 60-70 % of my exports run into the above mentioned error message.\n```\nTest\nClass: Warlock\nFormat: Wild\nYear of the Mammoth\n\n2x (1) Possessed Villager\n2x (1) Power Overwhelming\n2x (1) Voidwalker\n1x (2) Defile\n2x (3) Darkshire Councilman\n2x (3) Imp Gang Boss\n2x (3) Shadow Bolt\n1x (4) Blastcrystal Potion\n2x (4) Crystalweaver\n1x (4) Hellfire\n1x (4) Ravenous Pterrordax\n2x (4) Shadowflame\n2x (4) Voidcaller\n2x (5) Despicable Dreadlord\n2x (5) Doomguard\n1x (6) Kabal Trafficker\n1x (9) Mal'Ganis\n1x (10) Bloodreaver Gul'dan\n\nAAEBAf0GB+fLAv2/ArYH58EC7L8Cwg+X0wIL9q4CzgYwtKwC8BGSB8e7ApMBjg73zQL3BAA=\n\nTo use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone\nGenerated by HDT - https://hsdecktracker.net\n```. Sorry BTW for the large and bold font, that wasn't deliberate.\nI presume it's because the string from HDT adds all these # characters?. Ah, thanks for the explanation, so that's why.\nAnd as the most common export for me is an opponent deck, I run into the error so often because they are hardly ever complete. Bad luck for me I guess! ;-). Yeah, the warning is probably a good idea, thanks for considering this! And thanks also for the workaround tip, I had the same thought when you explained the reason for the error! :). ",

Awesome idea, for some reason I never think of symlinks outside of Linux operating systems xD Symlinked HDT config folder to Google Drive folder, it seems to be working, I'll check how the sync goes when I'm home ^^\n.

    "rembound": "I added the API changes. Hopefully it works now.\n. It is normal for the opencv_ffmpeg300.dll file to not exist. It will not crash because of it.\n@rapid383 mailed me a crash report before that I've attached:\nCrash report 8122015-2232.txt\n. Try to install the debug dll in: https://github.com/rembound/Arena-Helper/issues/33#issuecomment-165782349\nMaybe this will give you more debug information in the log file.\n. As I said in the other thread:\n\nNo new messages probably means that the crash doesn't occur in the tested code. Maybe some dll or library is incompatible with your system. I can't solve the problem at this point.\n. @Spray21 Open up %appdata% in windows explorer and go to the HearthstoneDeckTracker\\ArenaHelper\\ directory. Deleting the Decks directory might solve the problem. You could also try to delete the entire ArenaHelper directory in the appdata dir.\n\nSee also: https://github.com/rembound/Arena-Helper/issues/33\n. Will add support in the next version of Arena Helper.\n. I can see that auto-saving of decks is enabled during a draft. I use the SetNewDeck, SaveDeck, SelectDeck functions to partially build the deck. I have noticed that GameV2.Reset is called each time after saving the deck. This will reset the logreaders and results in having to process the entire log file again. I use LogEvents.OnArenaLogLine.Add(OnArenaLogLine) to process card picks. I have compensated for this behavior by filtering old loglines. If the log file is big, a lot of lines are processed each time a SaveDeck is called in the OnUpdate, which results in a delay. Edit: The pastebin log indicates that the SaveDeck etc. functions are costly on their own as well, but the delay is not critical to the functionality.\nThere is one other issue that comes up. Sometimes the logreader stops functioning after the GameV2.Reset is called. I can see that the actual HS logfile gets updated, but the logreaders don't get any new lines to process. Only restarting Hearthstone fixes it. When the issue happens, I can see In the HDT log that Restarting LogReaders. is displayed, but afterwards Stopped LogReaders. is displayed without ever starting the logreaders. Maybe this is a threading issue, by calling GameV2.Reset multiple times.\n. Arena Helper does not mess with old arena runs. If you use the save deck functionality, it adds new decks, but they are saved with the correct flags. Otherwise it does not interfere with deck tracker.\n. Decks aren't saved by default. The user would have to enable auto-saving or click the save deck button, in addition to clicking the HDT import prompt. Each deck also contains a unique guid, until a new deck is created. In my stats, I only see one arena run without stats in a long list of runs. In addition, I have never seen a duplicated deck.\n. @Bloomer24 This is an installation error. Check out my comments at: https://github.com/rembound/Arena-Helper/issues/75#issuecomment-202046640\n. The auto-updater of Arena Helper writes to the old plugin directory, so this would break the updater. After the official release, I can add support for the new plugin directory, but manual installation would be required. The auto-installer would keep popping up, until a newer version is installed.\n. Ah, thanks for clarifying. I assumed it loaded the plugins from the APPDATA directory, so syncing would be redundant.\n. Thanks for reporting! I have fixed it in the latest release.\nHsLogReaderConstants was changed into LogConstants. ",

So this is an info leak in Hearthstone itself.. mb the unknow cards are the new arena cards , the id of the cards is BCON_XXX becouse they were voted at BlizzCon\n\nSeem similar to this https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/3586 but update fix it. mb related to\nPlayer's cards shuffled by Psychic Scream are shown as in-hand for the player when drawn by the opponent #3519\n. it's not a real bug , it was caused by this https://githubengineering.com/crypto-removal-notice/ was a change by github to make connections more secure when downloading files and that blocked the updates from version < 1.15.13 to version > 1.15.14.\nI think if you manualy update, next time you can use the autoupdater like in the past.. You have last version ? 0.8.8\nhttps://github.com/rembound/Arena-Helper/releases\nif you have last version i think you have to open the issue on plugin page\nhttps://github.com/rembound/Arena-Helper/issues. shows 2018 for me , never used that function..\n. im not a code expert but i think you can try look here, i dont know if there are new ways to do it ..\nhttps://github.com/rembound/Arena-Helper\nArena-Helper is a plugin that supports plugins ... im bad at code mb you can check how arena helper detects it using HearthMirror [ i see you posted there ]. i think same problem as this\nhttps://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/3602\nhttps://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/3568\nhttps://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/3519. in the judge2020 link , user WolfspiritM wrote\n\nI figured out what the reason is:\nhttps://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows/blob/master/src/Squirrel/TrayHelper.cs#L106\nThis checks for the exe in the package being inside the path of the TrayIcon, however the Path is converted to lowercase a few lines above. So if the exe does have uppercase letters it's not recognized and it jumps to \"keepItem\". My temporary fix is to rename my .exe to lowercase, but I think that should be fixed.\n\nso i think the fix is to call it hearthstone deck tracker instead of Hearthstone Deck Tracker , it's a bit bad  ... . mb related to this?\nhttps://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/3632\n. can be this ? i dont know\nhttps://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows/issues/1094. workaround here \n\nWhat works on the other hand is giving it a favorite tag and removing that tag again\n\nhttps://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/3671\n. i posted on discord , the problem is caused by whizbang decks not imported in HDT.\nI dont know workarounds to import them without having the card.. i think is becouse you have whizbang deck , and it imports all the recipes again..\nthis becouse if you start a game with whizbang and you random \"trees are friends\" and that is deleted from the list , it will cause bugs not finding that \"recipe\" .\nI think we can convert this bug to a new request , a new separate tab where this whizbang decks are imported and so they are not visible in normal view.\nsry for my english. is more like entomb - psychic scream - etc info leak ..\nriQQ words\n\nAs the minion entities don't change, HDT knows, when this specific entity is drawn. So this is an info leak in Hearthstone itself.. with advanced options active , what options do you have in Tracker -> General\nAutomatically select decks [ reccomended ]\nAutomatically \"USE\" decks. [ disables buttons on decks ]\n\ni have the first enabled and the second disabled. this is a infoleak at hearthstone , but a fix on hdt can hide it .. \nI reported to blizzard in the past , i dont know why they dont want to fix it . yeah, it's becouse at some point i dont know why they decided to not load plugins from install folder , infact if the install plugin folder the one you use with portable version they put this file\n \"READ THIS.txt\"\n\nPLUGINS INSTALLED TO THIS DIRECTORY WILL BE REMOVED!\nPlease install your new plugins to '%AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker'.\n'options > tracker > plugins > plugins folder' will open that directory for you.\n\nso i think that force the creation of the new folder.\nSo the behaviour is intended , but is bad for who want to use it as portable whitout placing new files on pc.\n. i got this problem in the past when i archived all the whizbang decks becouse i dont want to see them in the normal list .. but when played they return back in \"home\" screen .\nIn my case i found a workaround , i dont archive them but i assign a tag \"whizbang\" and i filter them out from view.\nThis dont solve your problem , but i just want to confirm the bug is present.. https://hsreplay.net/replay/iWejVuXKFnfjUE4Z74ubtF#turn=12b\nminion attacking and die to explosive trap marks missdirection checked but is not .. . the card tracks damage itself via card text [ X left , Ready ] so i dont know how usefull it is ..\nis not like https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/3837 where the counter is totaly missing.\nbtw there is a card tooltip bug in hdt showing always [ 0 left! @ Ready! ] mb you can improve that to show the real counter.\n.

I made a change in one of the non-tracking decks (it seems this resets the stats for it) and it started tracking it again. Maybe something gets corrupted under specific circumstances?\nI added the check that suppresses resetting after games and will see if it will help and get back to you, but I have a question. Will a new game clean the previously drawn cards or is there a manual way of resetting?\n. Nice! By the way - great job with that application, it's really impressive work :)\n. It seems so far that disabling the deck reset post-game prevented the lost stats. Is this the intended way of working or is it just a workaround? Should I close the issue?\n. The issue came back regardless of the not-reset setting. I made change to a deck of mine so stats reset to 0-0. Then I went and won a game. 1-0 for a couple of seconds and then it went back to 0-0 like it was happening before. Played cards remained visible, so I know the reset setting is off.\nI can send another log if that will help you.\n. I did what you told me, it seems to be working so far, will keep an eye on it.

Just make a Hearthstats account and log into it to sync your decks and stats.\n. Seems like fun happenings with Avenge. Per the wiki:\n- Like all death-related triggers, Avenge may activate before or after the dying minion's Deathrattle, depending on the order of play. This can be significant because Avenge only chooses a target when it activates, not when it first checks for trigger conditions. If the Avenge was put into play before the minion, it will select a random friendly minion and grant it the Avenge buff before any Deathrattle; while if the minion was put into play first, its Deathrattle (if any) will trigger before the Avenge.[7] This allows order of play to affect both targeting and activation.\n- If this Secret is active while a friendly minion is killed, but there are no others on the board, it will remain hidden and not activate.\n. It might be possible that the hero from the adventure was imported instead of the card itself.\n. Opponent is misspelled on the left side at the probabilities.\n.

    "gardian06": "was doing some brawls earlier, and when facing mages 'that always got option for, and picked secrets' the secret helper would sometimes show results of attack hero, and sometimes wouldn't. I would sometimes be watching a youtube video on my second screen, but given my hardware (i7-4790, 32GB RAM, and a GTX 650Ti) I shouldn't be seeing any inconsistencies from a background program. monitoring console outputs.\nin one case the mage had played the secret, and when i did the attack test (would not have been lethal damage) it removed ice block from consideration, but left ice barrier (secret did not trigger)\nanother case I cast a targeted spell against one of their creature, the spell succeeded. the helper removed spellbender, but left counterspell as a possible.\nin another case I had killed one of their minions (secret did not trigger) effigy was removed from list, but duplicate was left.\nas a seperate question is there a way instead of just greying out the tested secrets to remove them from the list, or possibly to clean up multiple secrets in play as secret paladin just looks atrocious with 4s, and 5s next to all of them. this becomes especially evident when there are multiple secrets each with a different age.\n. were they all Rexaar, or were some of them Aleria, and if so did it make a difference in whether it was recorded or not?\n. in windows logs: right click my computer -> manage (must have admin privileges on account) -> in the left tree pain drill down system tools -> event viewer->windows logs -> application\nlook for anything that has a red x, or yellow triangle from immediately after the program is launched until you close it after the not responding message. if there is an error code then it would help.\n. how was the deck created in the deck tracker? did you use the automated system, or did you create it in the deck tracker manually?\n. thanks is there a way to add arena rewards to a run?\n. I was thinking something along the lines of moderate image recognition (compare only no guessing)  considering there is not that much different between golden and non-golden cards. and the names do appear to standout relatively well (I'm sure there may be exceptions, but they should be just that)\nwhere the program already has the images of the cards as they appear in lists, and does not need to really guess, the only parts the program needs to recognize is mana cost, and then the count, and where mana cost is also part of the card image we are only talking about 1 real test for recognition being the existance of a 2 or not in the count\nI was thinking of first checking for the existence of the scroll bar (if no scroll bar then we can . then using the first third of the card in the list (this would include the mana cost and in most cases a majority of the first word if not the complete thing) then do compares to get mana cost of the first card in the list where the majority of decks start at either 0, 1, or 2 we can find this quickly then use knowledge of the pattern that is used to by the game to order the cards in the list (spells, class minions, minions) walking through the list making sure to check mana cost first just in case it changes (if it is different then test on how much of a jump there was typically 1)\nexplaining further gets complicated for me to follow so I created a flowchart of what I was thinking. it looks a lot cleaner in openOfficeDraw, but was able to get to jpeg\n\n. if the entire deck fits into 1 screenshot then yes that analogy could be used, but if the scroll bar exists (more then 21 unique cards) then a single screen shot will not work. either the user will need to scroll the bar, or have to enter the cards manually. \nfrom a user point of view: if you have the image of a decklist at highest focus, and in the expected possition of a decklist then it might be possible to have this import system import that deck. not sure if you are talking about for the perpose of falsifying data, or what the goal would be. as the deck tracker already has the ability to import decks from the web (currently hearthpwn)\nfrom the point of memory allocation (constructors, destructors, and assignments) taking one image of the decklist as it exists holding that in memory as an object, and then for the prospectCard have a seperate memory object and just keep reassigning that would be the most efficient in my mind.\n. also applies to all minnions with 10 or more stat point, example: deathwing Dragon lord.\nthough for some reason C'thun \"when in play\" (see issue here: #2795) shows the correct stat value\n.

Ok, thanks for letting me know. The C# implementation works with GameState though, which is why I'm asking.\nDo you know what the differences between PowerTaskList and GameState are?\n.

All of my games record correctly with v13.3 and do not record correctly with 13.7\n. This is a new log from a game today.  Monitor resolution and in game resolution set to the same  1920x1200. Game setting is also High Quality. Does not make any difference if full screen or windowed.\nlog_19122015-121651.txt\nEdited to add: Also tried on medium quality and still ranked recorded as casual.\n. Ok Screen shot\n\nLog file\nlog_18122015-193410.txt\nGame record- (edited) to correct.\n\n. After I took the screenshot in game above, and  4 others, one in game.  The last 2  screenshots are empty, as if nothing is there.  I also replicated this again in the most current game in this log. All 6 screen shots with the HDT screenshot function are blank.\nlog_19122015-211525.txt\nBlank image\n\nAlso there are 2 crash reports around this time.\nCrash report 19122015-1946.txt\nCrash report 19122015-1947.txt\n. I restarted Heartstone and HDT and screenshots work now and games are recorded as ranked.\nNo settings changed.\nlog_19122015-23949.txt\n\n\n. With no changes, not closing HDT or Hearthstone.  Ranked games started again being logged as casual and screenshots with no data (blank)\nlog_19122015-231930.txt\n\n. This issue is still happening.\n. This issue has resolved for me with no action or changes on my part.\n. Not sure if it was a windows update, but possible I have not changed anything on this computer. As of now, my games are recording correctly.  I did have one game, in the last few weeks that did not record at all, but the ones that are recording at this time appear to be correct in ranked and casual.\n. A really, really good idea\n. Issue is also with 13.9 version. Was previously working in 13.7\n\nWhy does this happen with every update now?\n. Screen shots using HDT  hot keys during this game. All are blank.\nlog_1122016-174232.txt\n. v0.13.10_PRE2\n1. Played 2 ranked  games.Both were recorded correctly.\n\n1. Exported a deck to Game- Worked correctly and all cards were added to deck correctly.\n3.Flavor Text tool tips were displaying in game, but are also displaying when game is minimized and not in a game.\n\n\nGame Screenshot hotkey - Worked for first 3 screen shots. All after this were blank.\nPlayed and additional ranked game and restarted HDT still blank screen shots. Below are screen shots in order taken from the 2 ranked games.\n\n\nLog from testing\nhttp://pastebin.com/q3Jn6z6Y\n. I did not use the Game screenshot key. I used the screenshot. Will test with the Game Screen hot hotkey and report back. Also, I just restarted HDT and Heartstone and took 5 screenshots with the screenshot hot key and none were blank. With nothing else changed.\n. Game Screen shot also appears to be working correctly. 5 taken in last game, all correct.\nRanked recorded correctly.\nDo I need to go back to the 13.9 version?\n. Just for reference. I downgraded back to 13.9.  First screenshots taken in ranked ( 2) were blank. I restarted HDT from within the app and the next screen shot worked. Ranked game recorded correctly\nLog file\nhttp://pastebin.com/PgH8AYaM\n. Version is DirectX 11\n. V13.11 ranked records correctly with the alternative screenshot enabled.  Screenshots also correct using \"Game Screenshot\" hotkey.\n. Along the same, with Auto Deck selection enabled, not selecting the deck. Automatically opening a pop up with decks, even though there are limited deck options\n. Export in the prerelease works, but I had to export the deck deck 4 times before all the cards were exported correctly ( less than 30 cards first 3 tries) Successively more cards imported in each subsequent export from HDT to HS\n. I had done this previously\nWindows 7\nSpeed is normal\nWait 2 seconds.\nThe post above was not the normal 1 or 2 cards that are missing.  If I can remember correctly, the 1st import only imported no cards, the 2nd import 17,  the 3rd import 20 something and the last import all 30.\nTried another class deck. Imported 28 of 30 cards, but another issue. Imported 6 incorrect cards that were not in the deck. Deleted the deck and imported the same deck again and imported correctly.\n. Decks are importing with 13.16 however still the issue with the first import not importing many cards on the firsts import. example:\nlog file http://pastebin.com/F3bN5pat\nImport 1\nImport 2 - no changes with HDT. deleted the first deck and imported again.\nhttp://imgur.com/a/Bg7vi\n. I slowed it down to very slow and wait 3 seconds.  Did 2 imports and got 27 cards on each. So that is close to importing all cards.\n. Thank you. I can live with it. Just did not have this problem before the HS update. Maybe missing 1-3 cards, but no so many.  In any case thanks for the tips and love the HDT.  Appreciate all that you do.\n. Export on version 13.7 works on exporting for me also.\n. I am seeing something similar to this and this issue wan not present before the 4.2 HS update.\nRather than importing the entire deck and having to adjust the numbers of each card, HDT is importing cards not even in the deck and not importing all the cards.\nThis is a screen shot of a imported deck and the original deck list.\n\n. Still having this issue. Almost all cards are incorrect, up to 4 or 5 casting cost. Have run the constructed set-up multiple times and results in no change.\n. Currently when importing, entire first page is added to the deck and nothing until higher casting cost cards.  Ran the constructed set up just prior to this import.\nlog_2742016-19957.txt\n\n. It works me me also. Haven't tested updating an existing or other versions, but initial imports on new decks works great.  Thank you , Thank you !!\n. Reverted to 14.7 and works fine. Issue is with 14.8\n. Yes version is 8.0 and was  working prior to the HDT update and also works when reverted to HDT 14.7.  Will try again later with updated HDT to 14.8\n. Experienced this tonight. Selected one deck, with HDT on Auto.  HDT changed decks to a similar deck. Decks have completely different names.  Windows 10 OS\nVersion 15.6  Log files attached\nhdt_log_1467088971.txt\n. Will test later today also\n. This seem to have been fixed for me in v0.15.3.pre2.\n. If you mean another deck, then no unless I archived a deck instead of deleting it. And this would be unlikely as this is a Free to play account and I usually add cards or change the deck when I get new cards on the account.\n. For the record, this was not a basic deck  that was originally.  The import is working now with the same exact deck and changes. Made no app or HS changes.\n. This would be great, as the full text is usually to long for HS\n.

    "dphil": "Hm. I went to try to reproduce it, and it recorded a couple ranked matches in a row correctly. I restarted both HDT and Hearthstone to try again, and this time it recorded my next ranked match as Casual again. I hadn't taken a screenshot in-game since I assumed everything was working fine again, but after the issue arose again, I did save the log file:\nlog_11122015-15258.txt\nThe log is from the following sequence of actions:\n1) Starting up HDT\n2) Starting up Hearthstone\n3) Going to Play mode, and clicking the Play button (\"Ranked\" was already selected in-game) and playing a match to completion, then clicking on the victory screen to return to the Play mode menu.\nIn case it is relevant, I play Hearthstone in windowed mode with the option for the game notes window to pop up at the end of the match to record any of my own notes about the match (which I generally do and did so for this match).\nAt 3:12:48 in the log it says \"Game: Set CurrentGameMode to Casual\". This was when I clicked on the \"Play\" button in the main Hearthstone menu to go into the Play mode screen. As mentioned before, the \"Ranked\" button was already selected, not Casual. Granted, maybe HDT simply defaults to Casual and then does some secondary detection for ranked mode later on (at the end of the match?), I don't know.\nHere's the last portion of the log after the game ends and I click the victory screen to return to the Play mode screen:\n[3:21:17 PM] HandleGameEnd: Waiting for game mode to be saved to game...\n[3:21:18 PM] RankedDetection: Captured image is null\n[3:21:18 PM] GameEventHandler: No ranks were detected.\n[3:21:32 PM] HandleGameEnd: Game mode was saved, continuing.\n[3:21:32 PM] HearthStatsManager: trying to upload match: Win vs Shaman, 11/12/2015 3:13:02 PM\n[3:21:32 PM] HearthStatsAPI: Game Win vs Shaman, 11/12/2015 3:13:02 PM is not valid (invalid game mode: None)\n[3:22:33 PM] UpdateOverlay: Refreshed overlay topmost status\n[3:22:38 PM] HandleInMenu: Game is now in menu.\n[3:22:39 PM] GameEventHandler: Set CurrentGameStats.GameMode to Casual\n[3:22:39 PM] GameEventHandler: Saving DeckStats\nIs this where it normally detects if the game was a ranked match? If so it seems to have failed. Does the game screen need to be in front/selected for this to work properly? I often switch to other windows during a match.\n. I played  a few more matches, restarting HDT and Hearthstone each time, and I can't consistently reproduce the issue. Sometimes it detects it as ranked, sometimes not.\nIn the latest match I played, it correctly recorded it as a ranked match, and I found where it identified it as such in the log:\n[4:22:19 PM] UpdateOverlay: Refreshed overlay topmost status\n[4:22:26 PM] GameEventHandler: Trying to detect ranks... (tries=0, overlaytoggles=0)\n[4:22:26 PM] Overlay: No ranks should be covered by any decks.\n[4:22:26 PM] GameEventHandler: --- Opponent turn 1 ---\n[4:22:27 PM] GameEventHandler: Rank detection successful! Player=5, Opponent=5\n[4:22:27 PM] Game: Set CurrentGameMode to Ranked\nSo right near the start of the match (Turn 1) it was able to identify our ranks and set it to ranked mode. Looking back at the log file of the failed match attached in my previous post, I see that it tried numerous times to detect the ranks, but always failed, sometimes with the message \"Captured image is null\", sometimes without that message. I'm not sure why it fails in some matches but not others. these are all at the same rank (5). Again, I often jump between different windows while I'm playing, so maybe that is interfering with something?\n. Ok after a little more testing I think I might know what's going on. It appears to attempt to detect ranks at the start of each player's turn. Whenever I have HS in the background and another window in the forefront at the start of a turn, it is unable to detect ranks (as indicated by the log - \"Captured image is null...No ranks were detected\"). I suppose it's possible that, for the incorrectly tagged matches, I opened my browser or whatever at the end of every single one of my turns until the start of my next turn (at which point the HS icon in the taskbar flashes to notify me), thus denying HDT every start-of-turn chance to visually detect the ranks. Therefore at the end of the match, HDT can't tell if the game was ranked or not, and so it defaults to Casual? This is my theory, anyway.\nIs there any clean automated way to resolve this? Or will it simply be a necessity to manually ensure that HDT gets at least one start-of-turn phase with HS in the forefront to detect the ranks?\n. Hi andburn,\nI just played another ranked match where I made sure the game screen was in the foreground at the start of multiple turns (I think on the first turn it was in the background though), but for some reason it still wasn't detecting the ranks and thus recorded it as a casual game in the end.\nHere is the log (the log just covers the one ranked match; no other games): \nlog_13122015-124051.txt\nAnd here is a screenshot during the game, which is as it typically appears when I play:\n\nI use a screen dimming app so the image may look slightly dim. I'm not sure if that interferes with the rank detection at all. I play Hearthstone in windowed mode on a 30-inch 2560x1440 screen. I typically play with the Hearthstone window taking up about 1/4th of my screen (as in the above screenshot which is 1063x827.\n. Aha, I think I know what's going on now. There were sort of 2 problems I was encountering. One (as already discussed earlier in this thread) was the issue of having HS in the background at the start of turns so HDT wasn't able to detect the ranks.\nBut it seems the other problem was due to the screen dimming app I've been using (I use bootcamped Windows on a Mac machine, and the manual brightness controls don't work properly so I use a 3rd-party app). After my above post I decided to test it out. I found consistently that if I set the dimmer below a certain threshold, it was never detecting the ranks even with HS in the foreground. But as soon as I increased the brightness above a certain point, it immediately detected the ranks at the start of the next turn.\nSo in that case perhaps it is possible to relax the tolerance of the image detection so it can still determine ranks at dimmer settings, or else maybe put a warning somewhere that screen dimmers can interfere with it.\n. @andburn No worries, I know I'm probably in the vast minority for that particular issue, and it's easy enough for me to work around anyway by just adjusting the dimmer for one turn each match. But yeah maybe an FAQ post or something could help anyone who has this issue in the future. Cheers.\n. Screenshot of what I mean: \n\nAll of those except the very last (topmost) game were spectated in an uninterrupted streak. I assume the first one (at the bottom of the list) is \"None\" because it has trouble detecting if you jump into spectating after a match has started, which is fine. However after registering the next 5 games correctly as Spectator mode, suddenly it goes back to \"None\" for the next few (again, disregarding the last game where I stopped and re-started spectating). And notice how for some reason it only recorded opponent's name, # turns and game result for that one (3rd-last) match.\n. ",

    "LudiusMaximus": "Hi there, I am having the same problem as MantiBrutalis: also I am running HS on a rather old machine (Dual Core, 4 GB RAM) such that the animations of adding cards to the deck or even the loading of new cards after entering the search strings is somewhat delayed. The effect is that sometimes some cards are missed during export.\nHowever, changing the  entry in config.xml does not show any effect. And when I close and restart HST, the entry is reset automatically to the previous value (150).\nHelp would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\n. This issue does not occur any more for me, even though I did not change my PC. Have not tried it for some time, so I cannot say with which version it got resolved.\n. ",
    "KoRRo": "even if my pc is pretty powerful i had the same problem before moving hs from my mechanical disk to my ssd. for me it looked like hs was too slow reading the cards and loading them in memory. a workaround that worked pretty well was to turn all the collection pages before exporting, so all the cards were already in memory when exporting. if changing the configuration isn't enough you could try this, maybe it could also be added to the faq.\n.

That seems like a strange programming choice, but I hope (not necessarily assume) they have their reasons. Well, if that's what they're doing, I suppose this is even less relevant than I thought.\nAlthough, I don't think it would be TOO complicated to add a bit of code that checks if the card shown in the Joust can be in that person's deck (Hallazeal in Priest could not be a thing). \n.

For example I just noticed today that non of my games recorded.  \nI think in the past I've had it happen mid session, so maybe there is some bug that happens in certain game conditions that stops the recording for the session.\nAlso is there a way to manually add games from the app data files so I don't have to just manually add them in the HDT \"add game ui\".   I'd like to have the full review and everything.\nI see xml docs in AppData/Roaming/HDT/Games but I am having trouble attaching them in a zip file for some reason.

    "MarineKingAizen": "I am running v0.13.3 and the mode I often have problems with is ranked. The issue doesn't consistently happen, just sometimes and for no apparent reason that I can see. What I can say is this, once it fails to record a game for a certain deck, it will continue not recording games until I reboot the tracker.\n. Ok now I have the new patch and the tracker is dropping more games than ever before. It's not recording almost anything : (\n. LOG ATTACHED\nHi Epix, I currently have v0.13.7 and I am still experiencing the same problem, games are not recording. Every once in a while a few games will record, but most often they won't.\nThis morning I played 3 games and none of them recorded, neither for the deck nor under All Games, I checked for all modes as well and nothing. It's as if the tracker missed the entire session. I've attached the log for todays 3 games, perhaps you can shine some light on the issue. Thanks.\nhdt_log.txt\n. Thanks for the tip culinko. I did enable the tracker to record all game types including casual and that did improve the recording rate a lot. However there are still a lot of games not being recording. If I had to put number to it, I'd say about 30% of the games are not recorded even though I have all the record modes enabled.\nAnother interesting thing, when I delete stats from a deck or multiple decks and then switch back the main screen it still shows all the wins/losses next to their respective decks, even though I just deleted those games. It shouldn't be showing anything next to a deck if I cleared all the games, but there it sits and won't refresh to 0/0 until I shut down HDT and reboot it.\n. @culinko Thanks for asking, it's been pretty solid over the last few versions. All games are recording now, but they almost always record as casual even though I'm playing ladder. That's not a big deal to me, I don't care which mode it says, just as long as the games record. So all in all, I'd say my problem is fixed. Thanks again.\n. ",

ActivePlayer.Player : ActivePlayer.Opponent;\nOn turn 1, both IsPlayer and IsOpponent are set to false in the referenced Entity, so this conditional is always false and sets ActivePlayer.Opponent as the active player. I'll try to see where in the code the Entity is initialized incorrectly.\n. This is as far as I'm able to determine. The debugger shows that the Tags attached to Entities[id] are a lot different on turn 1 from subsequent turns. On turn 1, the tags are PLAYSTATE, CURRENT_PLAYER, and if the game is outside of Solo Adventure, also TIMEOUT. It seems that the IsPlayer and IsOpponent fields are set based on the presence of the PLAYER_ID tag, which is absent on the first turn for some reason. Consequently, these fields are not set, and the conditional in TagChangeHandler.cs is always false.\n. @Epix37 Hearthstone_Deck_Tracker.API.OnTurnStart passes the incorrect ActivePlayer enum to registered callbacks on the first turn if the player went first.\n. This bug has been fixed. I believe https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/ad664c87d1d9a49c36ea1ef8e24a412a5dd7e636 is the responsible commit.\n. ",

    "DerfelKadarn": "Same problem here. I'm running HDT on a Win10 VM on a Mac using Parallels.\n. I almost never had Rank or Game mode issues in the previous version. I wonder if there is an option (you mentioned one in a previous post) to re-enable the log-based detection. I'm kind of stuck between two versions 0.13.3 didn't handle Entomb properly so reverting will probably be as annoying. \n. I play in 3 different computers and manage it by setting the Data Path to my Dropbox folder. You should have your tracker > settings save data/config in appdata set to False and update by downloading the ZIP distribution rather than the automatic update. One thing you need to remember is to close HDT when you finish using it on one computer before moving to another.\nIf you see your progress missing on the other computer, go to your dropbox folder and right click the Deckstats.xml file and restore it to the previous version. This file always grows, so the file that contains the most updated data is the largest one (unless you have deleted a deck with its stats). Thanks, makes sense. Closing. hdt_log.txt\nIt also happens on v1.7.10. Log uploaded. I know. The only visible thing in the log is the time it takes to reinitialize the overlay (45 seconds). Downgrading to v1.7.5 in the meantime which solves for now.. One more thing that might be worth mentioning is that I'm redirecting the AppData Folder to Dropbox . I do this to share stats progress with my laptop which is also running Parallels.. I was wondering if there's any updates on this. Unfortunately using 1.7.5 is no longer an option. This happened exactly between 1.7.5 and 1.7.6. If not a solution, a workaround or a clue of what's causing it would be greatly appreciated.. Yes. That's the first thing I tried. Guys, any plans for this?\nUnfortunately I play on a Mac and have to use parallels to run the Windows version of HDT (the mac version is terrible). The problem is most probably related to this: \n\"Improved stability when saving files\" listed under the release notes for v1.7.6.\nNow I believe that with the next expansion still a couple of months away there might be some time to look into this and help out a 2-year premium subscriber?\nThanks in advance. One more thing that I didn't mention. My deckstats.xml file is 41.6Mb. I was trying to reduce the size but even deleting it won't work as it recovers it from a backup automatically. Any recommendation here? Maybe a smaller file would speed up the end of game process. I determined that is not the replay (I see the dropbox notification almost immediately) or the anonymous data upload as disabling it doesn't change anything. If there's anything that you want me to try to help troubleshooting, just let me know.. Here is the log. It looks like the file size theory is correct, is taking > 1min to save the file.\nhdt_log.txt\n. ",

No, because the v13.5 and older works with a different game/rank detection as mentioned in the patch notes, the resolution or messing with it can make the tracker not recognizing the game and not recording any information from it, iwch like i said for me solved that way\n@andburn yeah thats the new replay system i dont like that much but its very very accurate and on the spot for each play we make in game\n.

Thanks man, will give it a try.\n. i'm looking at neutral as the base, and german as a help guide, but after done i need to test the file on the program to make needed adjustments.\nmy question is, i see strings with _, should this be kept or ignored?\nlike _new for example.\n. is there a way i can export my WIP file to HDT so i can see the results and adjust where needed?\n. ok, so i'll do as much as i can for now, give it to you, and then wait for you to put it in the program, and then check for errors or needed adjustments.\n. i'm changing some letters for the alt+ function, so i then need to see in the program to see if i repeated some by mistake on a certain screen.\n. oops, wrong button, sorry i closed this :)\nhere is the file with what i've done so far, already more than DE, so not bad. I will do more when i see this in app so i have a better idea.\nStrings.pt-PT.zip\n. thanks Azeier, will test it now and add more stuff.\nI want to point out that the game has NO support for PT-PT, the real one, like many apps out there, they just go for pt-br and that's it, very sad.\nSo, since some Brazilian terms make no sense in pt-pt, i will not use them, like classes names, and will not invent some portuguese ones, will leave the original english ones.\nSo please make sure to point the difference in HDT, either use:\npt-pt\npt-br\nor:\nPortugu\u00eas (Portugal)\nPortugu\u00eas (Brazil) \n. here is today's work:\nStrings.pt-PT.zip\n. hey guys, did a little more work on it, here it is:\nStrings.pt-PT.zip\n. if you can compile a new release, i would appreciate it. \n. or if it is possible (i have no idea if it is) point me to instructions to compile it so i can test the files i created.\ni don't know why, but i no longer can select portuguese in HDT, disappeared from the options, i only get english, russian and chinese.\ni remember that the time before it disapeared, HDT had some errors in red, then the next day it was gone.\n. nothing, i just like to see what i'm doing, sorry for my method. i will not bother you again to compile.\n. i go the same error as the other time, i install that build, i select portuguese, i use it with no problems, go to bed, next day program starts with red warning about config.xml being corrupted and backup was restored, and i no longer have portuguese language to chose from.\ni put back the config file from that build and it works again, but maybe something is wrong here.\nps: this string has a typo: MainWindow_Menu_Export_Clpiboard\npps: in options, overlay, general, several strings are being truncated. is this a bug? because i see nothing to the right, show there is usable space there, text should show there\n. here is latest update:\nStrings.pt-PT.zip\nplease note:\n- somehow config.xml gets corrupt when i use portuguese (explanation on previous post)\n- this string has a typo: MainWindow_Menu_Export_Clpiboard\n- several strings are being truncated in options (explanation on previous post)\n. any comment on my notes?\nalso i can't select portuguese anymore, even if i unpack the latest file you gave me here, portuguese won't show up on appearance options, very weird stuff.\n. Thanks @azeier \nalso, why do you use repeated strings, for example:\nOptions_Overlay_Opponent_CheckBox_SameScaling\nOptions_Overlay_Player_CheckBox_SameScaling\nboth use same text (there are more examples of this), why not use just one entry?\nif you need \"samescaling\" string, read it from X place\nthis would avoid the possibility of the 2 strings having 2 different texts, when it should be the same\nps: here is a bunch more of strings added: \nStrings.pt-PT.zip\n.

Same stuff.\nAfter she won a game, her deck was showing the same stats 11-11 (50%). In HDT? Same thing, 11-11 (50%).\nShe \"Sync'd now\". HDT was showing 12-11 (52%).\nShe really have to Sync to have her stats updated. On my desktop, I don't have to do that.\n. I went to her Stats and put \"Ranked\" in \"Mode\" to display all her Ranked games. Hell, no games AT ALL were recorded. \nIt's all recorded as \"Casual\" games.\n. Does having the \"Alternative screen capture\" option checked may cause a problem?\n. Problem solved.\nBy unchecking the \"Alternative screen capture\" option, her stats now update, and HDT now recognize she plays ranked games.\nThank you for your support, and keep up the good work with HDT, an AMAZING tool!!\n. Yes, there is a single .txt file in the Crash Reports directory. (a big file if you ask me)\nThere are lots of events in the events viewer.\nWhat I am experiencing is that program sometimes stop to function at random moment. It freezes and then, I am forced to shut it down.\n. Just saw that the file are dated from 2015. I had Win 7 at that time.\nHowever, I uploaded a screen capture from my Event Viewer.\n\n.

    "Jecoms": "That would be directly interacting with the game client instead of just displaying information. It would be akin to botting and it could flag you as using 3rd party software that violates the TOS. The reason this program is tolerated by Blizzard is because it is just tracking readily available information for you. It's not playing for you or making decisions for you.\n. Other suggestions I have would be to implement more enums when referencing titles from a set. i.e. The different card sets are referenced by their string name instead of an enum.\nLooking deeper, I saw that you already have a CardSet Enum in your DB library. I was going to add an enum of the same name, but without having the code for the DB to make sure they match I'll leave it alone. It would be nice to have enums for the card set in the tracker code, though.\n. Ah. That was my Java bleeding through. I suppose I should have realized it wouldn't be an issue since you don't use the String object class. Another reason to like C# more!\nI'll look into contributing more meaningful code after I've spent more time in it.\n. I realize this, but I didn't want to couple it to his reference library. Since a conversion dictionary was used, I figured it was intended to keep them separate. Either way, an enum is an improvement.\n. I can refactor to use the HearthDB in that case. I think there was one area that required a comparison to a more readable string so I could handle that with the description attribute as you suggested. I'll make the changes this afternoon.\n. At this point we can't use the HearthDB CardSet enum because it doesn't have a constant for Whispers of the Old Gods. Further, are the enums derived from the game files? They are very poorly named (GvG is PE1?). It would be much better and more usable if they were named properly.\nIf the plan is to reduce duplication of enums between HearthDB and HDT, there is currently duplication of the Rarity enum in both. The HDT enum could be replaced by the HearthDB enum.\n. Well that didn't work as planned. Sorry I'm still learning the git commands. Will squash them down to one commit tonight. I can also mark the Rarity enum with the Obsolete annotation if you would like.\n. I'll resubmit with a single commit and the Obsolete Annotation.\n. I don't know what is wrong with the white space upon submitting a pull request. It looks fine in VS.\n. ",

If I only play ranked games which I do then I guess I can just view casual stats and it will work somewhat. Another issue is that when you go to hearthstats dashboard it is somehow mixing up and leaving games out. I installed this program yesterday and all was fine, I also played around 25 games on my main deck with it. Today all games show up as casual and I play another 30 games on my main. When I go to the website it only shows that I have played what appears as some random number of total games with said deck.\nI added up both my casual / ranked games and the number of games it shows I played online is neither of these numbers nor the combination of the two. What makes things even more strange is that I just now made a random deck and played 2 quick games in ranked. I go to the website and it shows I played 2 games no problem. I really wish this program would work correctly, It looks much better than others out there, but I might be forced to switch.\n. I think I figured out how to fix it, well at least for me anyway. When I turn stats into view in it's own window then it causes this problem. I went back into the settings and changed it back so that when I view stats it does not open it's own window. It's opens it in the same window and I just hit the back arrow to go back.\nI tested this a few more times switching off and on and it's definitely what's causing the problem for me. I switch the setting back and have had no issues since. Everything is running great. \n. ",

FYI:\nIn the \"Stats\" page, if you change the \"Rank\" filter (I had changed it from L1 to 5), and afterwards change the game \"Mode: filter back to \"All\" or \"Casual\", it seems to still use the set \"Rank\" filter, and not show any casual games as a result.  To fix it, I had to go change the Mode back to Ranked, then change the Rank filter back to L1 to 25, then change the Mode filter back to All/Casual for my Casual games to show again.\n. ",

    "TemporalOnline": "Hey man, something went warry, remember when I said everything was working fine? Well, after I rebooted, now HDT detects the beginning of the game as the end, and ends with the notification of \"(not detected) - (not detected) loss\" window. The blinking and all came back. I will go back to 13.09 until all is ok for now ;)\nPS: Rebooted with 13.09, all is well, something changed in the detection system from 13.09 to 13.10(and 11).\n. @Radiohawk58\nThe 13.09 is here: https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/releases\nyou scroll down and there will it be.\nI don't know where you put your installation of HDT, but wherever it is, first extract the zipped 13.09, (it will create a folder) and copy it. Then, go to the folder where HDT is installed (mine is inside hearthstone's folder) and copy all that is inside there to that folder. Copy that folder there replacing all files and that did it for me.\n. HDT from nowhere started to track my gold (it is not the true value, but it is tracking).\nSo, I believe I may have a use case for this bug: From 2 days ago, (sometimes this happens, it is random) I have been receiving my quests in the middle of the day instead of the usual 12:00 AM (ET? EST? It is sometime after 4AM here) and yesterday I got my gold capped.\nI believe HDT detected I was capped yesterday AND just started tracking again now that it thinks my real reset started.\nOne suggestion to correct it: As you did with the timer (which I would have preferred to be customizable instead of hard coded 75 or 95s, but I digress) you could implement a \"hard reset gold\" and \"hard track gold\", not based on whatever you may have been getting from the logs, but based on my preference.\nThe \"hard reset gold\" button would reset my current gold amount for the \"day\".\nThe \"hard track gold\" checkbox would track my gold progression no matter what (I believe i should also say how many wins I already have, as I will be \"resetting\" it, but is not a pressing issue).\nI mean, HDT is obviously tracking my progress, but based on this erroneous time based reset of my quests, it was thinking I was capped when I obviously, in game, was not.\nAnother suggestion, in order for it to be better than having to go through menus every time, is to make the coin clickable (the visor with the wins and gold for the day in the menu), maybe make a checkbox on HDT to let me interact with the gold visor, just like I do with secrets, this way:\nIf I click the coin, it goes red when it is force tracking, goes yellow when normal tracking;\nIf I click the \"wins: x/3\", it will go 0/3, 1/3, 2/3... etc;\nIf I click the (X/100G), it could go from wherever it is up to 100, then back to 0;\nOf course, all this hidden in the \"expert\" menu you just did.\nThank you very much!\n. It is tracking gold (up to this moment). I was already with 20(they were not detected) but it is tracking :)\n. I already tried that, it always revert to the squared one :(\nEDIT: After 7 or 8 tries, it stuck. I don't know what happened.\n. @Epix37 I think my problem was that I changed my HDT and games directory to a directory(where I installed HDT) inside my hearthstone installation, because I use the same one in various machines (and OSs, I play it on my linux machine also), but don't worry, I don't report linux problems, those I fix myself.\nWhat I'm trying to say is that I have my settings on a non-standard (non-appdata folder) for convenience/easy moving and sometimes it seems I have to redo my setting (also, sometimes after updating and asking to show my \"appdata\" folder, it crashes). It stuck after I redid my setting.\n. Please, try this: I will say what happens on my computer:\nThe problem gets REALLY apparent when you are in \"unlocked\" mode:\nWith this I was able to force my opponent's yogg counter to \"come back\" (it was hidden away from my hearthstone's window view):\n-STEP 1:\n1)Start Hearthstone;\n2)Set hearthstone to window mode;\n3)Restore Hearthstone to a position like top,left=0,0 and bottom,right=bottom-50,left-maximum you can(You can't resize hearthstone's window at will, just go with me here);\n4)Maximize Hearthstone;\n5)Restore hearthstone again to make sure it remembers its \"windowed size\" position;\n6)Maximize it again;\n-STEP 2:\n7)Start HDT;\n8)Unlock overlays;\n9)Set overlays at will, put Yogg and Cthun counters to the rightmost position you can.\n10)Lock overlays;\n11)Start game;\n12)Restore window to \"windowed size\";\nAT this point you might see both player's counters (Yogg and Cthun) \"disappeared\" from view. They are \"hidden\" in the same position because they \"drifted\", unlike the other overlays, they seem to be on another \"plane\", when you manually resize the window, they will drift through what I seem to call a \"relative space\", like if you are multiplying my resize of 400 pixels by 0,1 and they move at most 40 pixels.\nThis is 100 times worse if you do that while the overlay is unlocked, if you even attempt to resize the window while the overlay is unlocked, some overlays will SUPER compensate while others will move like turtles.\nI can make a video if you need to see this in action.\nThank you!\n. PS: I just discovered that in order to reproduce the problem, you have to put the yogg/chtun/atk overlays at the TOPMOST RIGHTMOST(not just rightmost) side of the window (number 9).\nI tried to move them to try to keep them inside the window in all positions, and when I put them on the bottom side, they were kept inside the window. I don't know why.\n. Happened again:\n\n\nIf I close and open HDT in hopes of it reloading the current game, same thing happens, the notification none-none pops up and that's that.\n. If it is, would it be too difficult to show in the splash screen something like \"downloading new...\" as a feedback to know what is happening? HDT keeps taking up to 30 secs to go up every time I start it now (sometimes it is \"just\" 15 secs, but used to be 5).\nThe tick \"check for updates\" is ticked, but the beta one is not.\n.

HDT keeps taking up to 30 secs to go up every time I start it now (sometimes it is \"just\" 15 secs, but used to be 5).\nThe tick \"check for updates\" is ticked, but the beta one is not.\n. No, no button is shown to me.\nI decided to untick the check updates (the non-beta one) too. It is lightning fast again, now.\nDoes HDT still show on the news bar if it has an update? I Wish to keep it unticked, as I use to close it alongside battle.net because \"batlle.net helper\" use to eat 30% of my pc's power every time I browse youtube, and then I just turn them all off (HDT, Batlle.net etc) when I'm not playing.\nThanks!\n. Looks like it was the ArenaHelper plugin:\nhdt_log_1471053413.txt\nI'll go ask them to make the update after the splash, OR ask you to make the plugins to work on a different thread - unless you didn't \"threadproof\" HDT (which would be akim to remake the entire thing, so, I'll not ask for this :) )\n. You can't, as this is a design philosophy of HDT, because guessing or even loading an opposite deck could bring HDT to be thought of \"more than what could be done with pen and paper\" and be banished for it.\nI myself disagree, but I can see his point.\n. Looks like a backup of 1.0.5.28, another from 1.0.5.29 from yesterday, another dir called packages, squirrelsetup.log and Update.exe.\nMy problem is that I had all my shortcuts everywhere pointing to the dir inside the hearthstone folder (when I travel, it is easier to copy it all than to keep copying things from everywhere) where I keep the HDT folder and all its things(I tried to set again the APP path and Data Path to there again) and the updater deleted the executable from THERE. And didn't put another on the desktop pointing to anywhere.\nThat's why I \"panicked\" :)\n.

Sorry for the late reply, I was trying to reproduce my conditions, nothing abnormal has happened since then.\nI backup my system weekly, so if hearthstone one day decides to delete strange things from its folder, I'm not worried. As I said, it is easier to set both app and path there, then just copy the entire path from my PC to the Note on the fly when I travel or something.\nAnother thing I usually do to programs I trust and that I have to keep giving permission is to give them admin using another program called \"UACpass\", which creates a service that runs in admin level and then if it need to update or work it doesn't have to keep bothering me as it used to happen while I had W8(up until last month, looks like it has eased on W10). I don't know if maybe that has something to do with anything, maybe before it didn't have permission to change things on the programs folder and now it has. Just a guess, but anyway, nothing strange has happened now.\nIf something happens again, I'll keep you posted :)\nThank you!\n.

Once it \"stabilizes\" after the data is loaded into memory, this is no longer a problem.\nOne more thing I might add is that the \"Zero crystal\" sometimes remains uncleared for me when exporting, causing a 0/30 cards exported fail (as the exporter cannot find the filtered cards in the 0-mana range obviously). However this is pretty rare since the 0.13.9 update, I experienced this more before and less frequently now. This may also have to do with either the inability to \"catch up\" (load to RAM) to HDT on my low end machine, causing missclicks by the exporter or an issue with my display resolution (1366x768).\n.

I just want to do it in the downtime, which is, for me at least, after I close Hearthstone. \nIf the popup still appeared at that point, that would be perfect, so it would just be swapping the moment when it appeared.

Any ideas ?\n. @Epix37 The log is exactly this same after I turn plugins on, and try to restart HDT. All plugins are affected, currently I'm using  3, Treasury, hearth arena uploader, and \"arena helper\". All of them are turned off after 3/4 relaunch. The most problems occur when I use \"launch with windows\" option\", each time I restart my pc, and HDT launches, plugins are disabled, and after each crash. MY HDT often crashed at the beggining of the game.\nThat's how my log looks after 1/2 relaunch, where the plugins are still enabled, in this case, I onyl enabled treasury : \n\n09:53:14|Info|OverlayWindow.Update >> Refreshed overlay topmost status\n09:53:15|Info|MainWindow.SelectDeck >> Switched to deck: Arena 23-07 07:08 (v1.0)\n09:53:15|Warning|LogReaderManager.Stop >> LogReaders could not be stopped, stop already in progress.\n09:53:15|Info|GameV2.Reset >> -------- Reset ---------\n09:53:15|Info|OpponentSecrets.ClearSecrets >> Cleared secrets\n09:53:16|Info|BackupManager.Run >> Running BackupManager\n09:53:16|Info|BackupManager.Run >> Backup for today already exists\n09:53:16|Info|PluginManager.LoadPlugins >> Loading Plugins...\n09:53:16|Info|PluginWrapper.Load >> Loading Treasury\n09:53:16|Info|PluginWrapper.IsEnabled >> Enabled Treasury\n\nAnd sometimes, it launches without this part : \n\n09:53:16|Info|PluginWrapper.Load >> Loading Treasury\n09:53:16|Info|PluginWrapper.IsEnabled >> Enabled Treasury\n. Actually, it appears that, after all crashes and/or pc restart plugins turned off, including change in plugins.xml, and ticking \"launch with windows start\" on and off fixed the issue, witch is pretty weird.\n. \n",

I agree that this is technically not \"stats\" anymore when used in this way. But someway of recording this info without having to go back and delete all the matches I don't care about would be nice.\n. OK, that's great!\n. Along similar lines it would also be cool if the UI could in some way notify you if your current opponent is someone who you've played against previously (by checking existing stats for a record containing that opponent)\n. @Epix37 Understood.\n.

When I was battling the innkeeper he used Shadow Madness on my healbot and it appeared in the tracker overlay for my opponent.\nSorry for reposting an existing issue. And yes, this is exactly the same problem as the other thread describes. Even when I delete the deck and remake it the same thing happens again.\n. Here is the log: http://pastebin.com/bFaqiu55\n\nAs for screenshots:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n. Log.txt\nNo matter how many times I do this it gives identical logs. Sorry about double posting the same thing.. I did it again step by step and the log remains the same. Yes, the process in Task Manager is gone. The line you wrote was not found in the log.\nWhen you check \"Remove cards if none remaining\" and close HDT, do you experience the same issue or is it just on my end? I can live with checking it every time I open the program if it is just me.. It is saving every other change in options I make, except this one. Very peculiar indeed. Well, I guess there is nothing to be done. Thanks for your time anyway :). It worked! After changing the code HDT started saving this setting and it no longer unchecks itself after restarting the program. Thank you \ud83d\udc4d. Exactly the same behavior as in my tracker.. Yes, the tracker is updated to \"Release v1.7.6 - 2018-10-02\". I can confirm that it works like that for me as well. Once I exited Battle.net from the tray and clicked on the \"Start Hearthstone\" button it started the Battle.net app and Hearthstone launched as well.\nThe problem is that the button should start the game regardless if Battle.net is stated or not. It was working like that in previous versions of Hearthstone so I would assume it should work like that now as well.. ",

I tried as you requested, I was not able to reproduce it again with another deck. However I was able to reproduce it with that deck.\nI restored a backup, only the version 1.0 and 1.1 of that deck were there, edited it and saved to anew version and got the two entries like you see in the screenshot. If I delete one of them the other is still in the deck tracker, however all recorded stats are gone.\nI made a video from that process, unfortunately I'm not able to upload it as an attachment here, neither WMV, MP4 nor packed as ZIP.\nIt looks like this is something special with that deck, I found a workaround for me: I archived the unwanted deck, so it is only visible if I choose to display all decks. After that I edited the PlayerDecks.xml using notepad++ to find the archived deck and deleted the whole deck node for that deck. After that the deck list looks like expected and I still have all the recorded stats.\nSo you may close the issue as kind of strange singularity. If you want to investigate further I can create and upload a backup which only holds this (these two) decks.\n. As you requested, I have tried to minimize the decks and deleted all decks and most of the recorded files from within HDT.

    "astradamus": "Do C'Thun conditionals account for Mistcaller's buff if C'Thun is in your deck? I.E. If you play Dark Arrakoa -> Mistcaller -> Ancient Shieldbearer, do you gain 10 armor? My guess is no, and if that's the case, I'd find it confusing if it respected Mistcaller's buff unless C'Thun was in hand or in play (at which point we know that the buff is respected, see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSVvBFHsoLs).\n. Yeah, culinko tested and confirmed that C'Thun conditionals don't respect the MC buff unless C'Thun is in hand or play  (since the buff is not placed on cards in the deck but rather placed on them as they are drawn from it). The \"proxy C'Thun\" in setaside doesn't the buff, which is what gets checked when CThun isn't in hand/play. I would consider that a bug. That said I think you're definitely right, as long as C'Thun IS affected by the buff the counter should be updated accordingly because in that case it does affect his behavior and that of his buddies.\n. Uh I wanted to edit my comment but now I can't see the two latest posts, so I'll just shoehorn this in here presuming they'll reappear: not only does MC not update cards in the deck directly, but it appears extremely unlikely that CThun conditionals even examine the cards in the deck even if it did.

    "wavecycle": "Thanks for the reply! I'm using Wine and PlayonLinux. \nFirst stumbling block has been installing Dotnet 4.5. I've tried the quick way, namely to create a new 32 bit wine prefix through PoL (1.7.49 according to WineHQ Dotnet page ) and then install the dotnet45 component. This retro installs whatever previous versions of dotnet it thinks are required. At the end of this I run the Dotnet diagnostic tool and when i check the versions I get:\n- 2.0: SP2 verifies\n- 3.0: SP1 verifies\n- 3.5: verifies\n- 4 Client: verifies\n- 4 Full: verifies\n- 4.5: Verifies\nThen I try run the Hearthstone Deck Tracker.exe in the folder and nothing happens. BTW I have placed the HDT folder inside the prefix's program files folder.\nI have also tried the long way round with the dotnet install using wintricks to install from the earliest versions, using the the wine versions as listed in the  WineHQ Dotnet page ). Checking each version along the way to check it is working. At the end I run the file and nothing happens.\nI found another link referring to dotnet installation problems for another game..and that suggested using winetricks to install gdiplus and vcrun2005. I tried that, tried running the HDT exe in the prefix and nothing happens! Well not nothing..I got a slight flickering that looks like a piece of a cursor but nothing else.\nI've also tried running another tracker \"Hearthstone Tracker\" and it wouldn't work without the dotnet 4.5 install. After the 4.5 install the Hearthstone Tracker install runs successfully but when it tries to start the app afterwards nothing happens.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n. justin@trollbox:~/.PlayOnLinux/wineprefix/HS_32/drive_c/Program Files/Hearthstone Deck Tracker$ wine \"Hearthstone Deck Tracker.exe\"\nsystem.reg is not a valid registry file\nuserdef.reg is not a valid registry file\nuser.reg is not a valid registry file\nerr:process:create_process starting 64-bit process L\"C:\\windows\\system32\\wineboot.exe\" not supported in 32-bit wineprefix\nerr:process:start_wineboot failed to start wineboot, err 193\nerr:process:create_process starting 64-bit process L\"C:\\windows\\system32\\explorer.exe\" not supported in 32-bit wineprefix\nerr:ole:CoGetClassObject class {079aa557-4a18-424a-8eee-e39f0a8d41b9} not registered\nerr:ole:CoGetClassObject no class object {079aa557-4a18-424a-8eee-e39f0a8d41b9} could be created for context 0x1\nerr:mscoree:LoadLibraryShim error reading registry key for installroot\nThe entry point method could not be loaded\njustin@trollbox:~/.PlayOnLinux/wineprefix/HS_32/drive_c/Program Files/Hearthstone Deck Tracker$ ^C\njustin@trollbox:~/.PlayOnLinux/wineprefix/HS_32/drive_c/Program Files/Hearthstone Deck Tracker$ \n.

I version of playonlinux Wine I was using was shipping using an older version of libgnutls. I upgrade some things and it's working now. Thanks @borisbabic for the instructions..

No - I'm getting an error message when downloading the update \"There was an error installing the latest update. Press any key to open the website for manual download.\". After trying to manually download I still end up with HDT not recognizing that I'm in game... in any mode. It's not recognizing any decks and is repeatedly telling me there is a new download, do I want to download now. I've tried ignoring - closing both HDT and Hearthstone. Still getting nothing. On the manual download, when I try to open the application after the download I get a Windows alert saying that it's interfered with my action because what I'm trying to do could compromise my PC (sorry... didn't write down the exact language).

I got a guaranteed workaround by opening OBS, HS and HDT. Afterwards enabling the separate capturable overlay window. \nAs long as that option is enabled AFTER HS goes into lobby it works. Starting HS has an effect on the capturable window. I guess the panel/device is invalidated which causes the overlay to autoreset but the capturable window doesn't receive this notification through its message pump. The result of this is that the window still points to an invalidated screen buffer.. I looked into it again and updated the streaming instructions page on the WIKI. I don't have any issues anymore capturing the overlay on stream.. Since you said it happened after a crash and you're running Creator's update; run DISM to fix broken components of Windows (.net 4.7 is part of these).\nThis only works if your Windows Update isn't broken:\n\nOpen an elevated command prompt\nGo to start\nType cmd\nRight click the suggested program (command prompt [cmd.exe]) and choose run as administrator\n\n\nexecute dism /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth, this uses Windows Update to fix corrupt component packages\nexecute sfc /scannow, this will fix corrupt component files \n\nAfterwards deck tracker might work again, if not run the .Net repair tool again.. From the logs i guess there is some kind of ownership issue with/within your Windows folder making it fail integrity tests. Strange to see that Windows itself seems to not care and doesn't try to explicitly fix this.\nPerforming a restore from a new installation medium is already grey zone where i would consider clean reinstalling windows entirely. Not that i recommend that in every situation but it's the option which has definite success.. Seems like dism couldn't open the wim file for restoring.. i actually wonder if the container index matters, because the media tools builds an install for each windows 10 version (pro, home, enterprise and student [i think]). it might be you have home edition installed so you'll have to pick index 2. -> this is guesswork since the log doesn't explain anything.\nAbout 2017-08-21 19:12:21, Warning               DISM   DISM OS Provider: PID=14536 TID=3524 Unable to set the DLL search path to the servicing stack folder.

What is the value of the (only) key, it should have a path as value? Does the keyname match a foldername inside C:\\Windows\\servicing\\Version ?\nEDIT: Can you list us all items found under C:\\Windows\\servicing\\Version?. According to your screenshots your folder layout is normal. I expected dism getting confused if multiple servicing versions would be defined. Maybe the contents of the folder which is used as registry value for the key 10.0.15063.410 is different? Below is a screenshot of the contents of the folder on my computer. (I have the same servicing version)\n\nI'm at the end of my knowledge here. The last 2 things i can suggest are the following.\nCheck the wim file contents by using dism /get-wiminfo /wimfile:F:\\sources\\install.wim. (change the path to point to your mounted install iso.) Remember the index value that matches the install container for your version of windows, which is pro or home or another derivate. Rerun dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:wim:F:\\sources\\install.wim:1 /limitaccess, replace 1 with the correct index value. Try the command a second time if the first one still fails.\nIf that doesn't work run the windows setup again from the mounted install and do an inplace upgrade/restore. BUT i'm not sure to what extend your system will be changed and which effects it will have on your installed programs.\n. Maybe something interferes with the mounting process. \nCopying the install.esd file to your desktop (where your user has full security control) and using it from there works?. ",

See https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/blob/master/Resources/Tiles/KAR_004a.png (compare https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/blob/master/Resources/Tiles/KAR_009.png).. This does appear to be connection issues, so a reupload/retry setting would help alleviate this problem.. @Latency Huge parts of your commits seem to be just replacing the LF line endings with CRLF. Make sure your editors/git respect the line endings as set out in the .editorconfig (LF only). Otherwise the diffs become unreadable.\nYou can set up your git to use LF only by setting the core.eol setting.. This is probably due to the recently disabled insecure protocols on GitHub's end: https://githubengineering.com/crypto-removal-notice/. @PyroGenesis Yes, afaik the UI was partially broken.. Looks like this is resolved.. Could you please share the URL of the replays here (the ones that say \"The uploaded file is not a valid replay\")?. Duplicate of #3445. Duplicate of #3587. Can someone else reproduce this?. Isn't that the opposite?\nAdditionally it appears that for this report the opposing player was using Whizbang.. Replay and Power Log.. ",

Hi,\nI was looking at similar problems and hmm, for some users this helped:\n\n\nTry run HDT as Admin\n\n\nSet service: \"Performance Logs & Alerts\" to automatic and starting.\n\n\nChange the DEP (DATA Execution prevention) to \"Turn on DEP for essential Windows programs and services only.\"\n\n\nYou can also try install updates from Windows Update, if you haven't and try newest portable version of HDT: https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/releases/download/v1.6.5/Hearthstone.Deck.Tracker-v1.6.5.zip\nIf none of this helps, you can also try creating new user profile in windows and install HDT on it and try it then.\nReply here if any of this resolved your problem.. Can you check if you open manually HDT from: C:\\Users\\UserName\\AppData\\Local\\HearthstoneDeckTracker its updated? Updating HDT before 1.5.14 will fail, because security protocol changed. It's possible that you have 2 versions of HDT atm.\nCheck this comment: https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/3660#issuecomment-399039612.

I have my interface set to remove cards from the deck overlay as I draw them.. It's worth noting I've been noticing this behavior for months now, so this isn't a new bug.  It doesn't occur often.  I notice it every few days or so.  . It happened again.  It occurred immediately after I cast Entomb upon my opponent's Raza the Chained.  In the first screenshot I linked I hadn't yet cast Entomb (and hadn't yet used Shadow Visions to get a copy of it), so I dunno how related Entomb is.  Either way, there's clearly a rare bug occurring somewhere.\nOddly, Lightbomb is also out of order.  I never cast it or got a copy of it in this game.\nUpdate: Turns out I mulligan'ed Lightbomb.\nHere's the game: https://hsreplay.net/replay/yCgCDPHEDQChVLmawDeY3i\n\n. Now that I'm looking for it I've been seeing it a lot lately.  At least 7-8 times in the past 24 hours.  I could inundate you with screenshots, but you'd rather useful data.  So here's something of note: it occurred immediately after the mulligan.  The four cards I handed back in the mulligan were: Azure Drake, The Lich King, Shadow Word: Death, and Northshire Cleric.  You can see the mulligan/game here:\nhttps://hsreplay.net/replay/SaYVbmaE2tLHuYJTHjJxdV\nI'll keep testing and see if I can decipher any rhyme or reason for the misordering.  I'm starting to notice certain patterns.  I've never seen it happen at 1-3 value, for example.\n\n. It happened again yesterday. I noticed it on turn 2.  It's worth noting I had just Mulligan'ed Velen, although whether or not that's a coincidence is unclear.\n\n. The fact that the bug occurred immediately after a mulligan (see one of my examples above) suggests the mulligan is involved.  I\"ll start providing links to the games themselves, so we can investigate this a bit more.  . Another screenshot.  Here's the game from which it occurred:\nhttps://hsreplay.net/replay/jpW4zgBcLaqiD3DQjUjXN8\nI grabbed the screenshot immediately as the mulligan ended -- the screen is still dark and you can see the coin appearing.  Sure enough, I returned Dragonfire Potion to my deck during the mulligan.\nIt's worth noting that now that I'm checking my order I'm noticing this occur a lot more often.  It's occurring in more games than the few from which I'm grabbing screenshots.\nSince the bug can occur immediately after the mulligan phase or casting Entomb, I'm guessing it occurs when cards are shuffled into your deck.  I can't explain why it doesn't appear to happen with low-cost cards.  I do mulligan them back fairly often.  Probably a side effect of the bug itself.\n\n. It happened again.  And sure enough, it involved a card I mulligan'ed (Velen).  Clearly it has to do with mulliganing cards, although I suspect Entomb (or other shuffle into your deck functions) may trigger it as well.)\nIs there anything in particular about this bug you want me to look for / report?\nGame here: https://hsreplay.net/replay/n7np6cVLayFTasbNgkjpri\n\n. Was looking back at the original images from which my screenshots were based and comparing them to the games in question.  Sure enough, in the story for the second screenshot in which Lightbomb was out of order, I had mulligan'ed it.\nAt this point I'll stop providing commentary on the issue unless I discover something new to report.  It's clearly happens from both mulligans and from casting Entomb, so it's likely a bug resulting from anything that involves cards being reshuffled into a deck.  Not sure why it doesn't affect low value cards; it's likely a quirk resulting from the bug.  (I thought it only affected the most expensive card shuffled back into a deck, but that's not the case as I also mulligane'ed Holy Nova in the first screenshot.. Just an FYI this bug can affect two cards returned during the mulligan.\n\n. I unchecked the box a week ago and haven't noticed the ordering bug since.  \nI'll continue playing with the box unchecked and let you know if I spot the error.. I can confirm this bug still exists.  \nIn this game...\nhttps://hsreplay.net/replay/9qPpnRWU4HFS3iuYHZEHHQ\n... I played two Duskbreakers.  The first died in short order.  The second was tossed into my opponent's deck with Psychic Scream.  At the end of the game when my deck was completely empty, it still appears to be in my (empty) deck.  You'll notice the minion is actually on my opponent's side of the battlefield at that point.\n. ",

The only difference is when I was pasting names from clipboard, literally nothing showed up in the search field.  The speed changes changed the speed as would be expected.\n. Well I just changed Hearthstone to windowed mode... and it worked!  Then I set it back to fullscreen... and it still works!  I don't actually think that was the issue though.  As much as I hate saying, \"did you try turning it off and on again?\" I recently had a power-out and had to boot up my computer again.  I leave my computer running 24/7.  So, the reboot may have solved it.\nAlso, I do use Radeon cards (MSI 7970x2), but it does not look like I have \"RadeonPro\" installed.  Just \"AMD Radeon Settings\".\n. ",

Unable to import through construct or any method, also tried to manually created a deck and play a game using exact same deck and no tracking of card usage.\nI have tried all of the proposed solutions above and non seems working.\nHDT log below:\n2:50:17 PM|Info|Core.Initialize >> HDT: 1.1.1.1, Operating System: Windows 10 Home 14393, .NET Framework: 394802\n2:50:17 PM|Info|Updater.StartupUpdateCheck >> Checking for updates\n2:50:17 PM|Info|Updater.GetReleaseUrl >> Downloading releases file\n2:50:18 PM|Info|Updater.GetReleaseUrl >> using 'live' release: https://github.com/HearthSim/HDT-Releases\n2:50:19 PM|Info|Updater.SquirrelUpdate >> Checking for updates (ignoreDelta=False)\n2:50:20 PM|Info|Updater.SquirrelUpdate >> No new updated available\n2:50:20 PM|Info|SplashScreenWindow.ShowConditional >> Showing splashscreen...\n2:50:20 PM|Info|ThemeManager.LoadThemes >> Found theme: classic\n2:50:20 PM|Info|ThemeManager.LoadThemes >> Found theme: dark\n2:50:20 PM|Info|ThemeManager.LoadThemes >> Found theme: frost\n2:50:20 PM|Info|ThemeManager.LoadThemes >> Found theme: minimal\n2:50:20 PM|Info|GameV2.Reset >> -------- Reset ---------\n2:50:20 PM|Info|OpponentSecrets.ClearSecrets >> Cleared secrets\n2:50:21 PM|Info|OverlayWindow.Update >> Refreshed overlay topmost status\n2:50:22 PM|Warning|LogReaderManager.Stop >> LogReaders could not be stopped, stop already in progress.\n2:50:22 PM|Info|GameV2.Reset >> -------- Reset ---------\n2:50:22 PM|Info|OpponentSecrets.ClearSecrets >> Cleared secrets\n2:50:22 PM|Info|BackupManager.Run >> Running BackupManager\n2:50:22 PM|Info|BackupManager.Run >> Backup for today already exists\n2:50:22 PM|Info|PluginManager.LoadPlugins >> Loading Plugins...\n2:50:22 PM|Info|ApiWrapper.UpdateAccountStatus >> Checking account status...\n2:50:22 PM|Info|ApiWrapper.UpdateAccountStatus >> Id=333658, Username=, Status=Registered\n2:50:30 PM|Info|OverlayWindow.Update >> Refreshed overlay topmost status\n2:50:46 PM|Info|MainWindow.ShowImportDialog >> Waiting for TOURNAMENT screen...\n2:50:48 PM|Info|OverlayWindow.Update >> Refreshed overlay topmost status\n2:54:51 PM|Info|OverlayWindow.Update >> Refreshed overlay topmost status\n2:54:53 PM|Info|Core.UpdateOverlayAsync >> Exited game\n2:54:53 PM|Info|Core.UpdateOverlayAsync >> Reset region\n2:54:53 PM|Info|LogReaderManager.Stop >> Stopped LogReaders.\n2:54:53 PM|Info|GameV2.Reset >> -------- Reset ---------\n2:54:53 PM|Info|OpponentSecrets.ClearSecrets >> Cleared secrets\n2:54:54 PM|Info|LogReaderManager.Restart >> Restarting LogReaders.\n2:54:56 PM|Info|MainWindow.Window_Closing >> Shutting down...\n2:54:56 PM|Info|LogReaderManager.Stop >> Stopped LogReaders.\nAny help would be highly appreciated\n. @riQQ Thank you kindly for your speedy reply. Is the log supposed to be AppData\\Roaming\\HearthstoneDeckTracker? If so then no there is no LoadingScreen.log\nAlso no LoadingScreen.log under Hearthstone folder as well\n. \nNot sure if this helps. Seems like HDT is not linked to HS somehow; however I am able to use HDT's \"START LAUNCHER / HEARTHSTONE\" function and therefore I believe the path is set correctly.\nMuch appreciated your time\n. \nDon't see any Logs subfolder of the HS Installation directory\nI only see Logs folder for HDT which was posted above\n. @riQQ I see what you mean and what log file you are looking for now -\n2016-11-02 16:51:08.799: System Info:\n2016-11-02 16:51:08.831: SystemInfo -

(A note, go to your file explorer, type %appdata% at the top and it'll take you to the directory with the folder in it)\nSearch for 100. This value is how often per second the app checks for data from Hearthstone's log files. (100 is 100 milliseconds, so 10 times per second) Changing it to a higher value (mine's at 500, so just twice a second) drastically improved my performance._. ",
    "Mercury48": "I gave it some thought and I came up with a pretty nice and super-simple formula to calculate which the best performing deck is.\nI want to check with you guys, though. The formula works pretty nicely even when the number of games (with a given deck) is really small (1, 2... games). That said, I still think that such a small sample of games should not be taken into consideration when we talk about statistics.\nSo, I suggest that I add a condition nonetheless. Something like: \"number_of_games_played >= x\"\nIf you agree with me, what do you propose that the value of 'x' should be? maybe 5 or 10 games in order to account for them? what do you think?. to give you an idea, the formula is as simple as:  Games / (Loses + 1)\nthis takes into account not only win-rate but number of games as well without throwing things off-balance. I include a .txt with some calculations I've already put down to check it's results.\nIn short, this formula calculates indexes, then I will compare them and use the greater number.\nIt will make calculations like this:\na) 5 wins out of 8 games (for short 5/8) -> index = 2\nb) 31/60 -> 2\nc) 21/37 -> 2.17\n(there are more calculations within the .txt.)\nWhen there is a draw, the deck with the largest sample (most games) will be the one to be picked.\nfor example, the program would pick (in that order):\n44/50 (7.14) > 18/20 (6.6) > 7/8 (4) > 21/37 (2.17) > 31/60 (2) > 5/8 (2) > 9/20 (1.66)\nas you see, the formula prioritizes stable results like 44/50 over 18/20 even though the later has technically a higher win rate (90% vs. 88%).\nI believe that it is really balanced, safe and simple and it will help the players know their efficiency\nDoes it look good? Should I go ahead and implement it?\nformula_behavior_calculations.txt\n. -> replaced 'LastPlayedDate' checkbox and added a combobox with more options for what date is shown on the decks on the DeckPicker deck-list.\n-> renamed some variables and added 'ShowDateOnDecksOptions' class.

Thanks.. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12769264/openclipboard-failed-when-copy-pasting-data-from-wpf-datagrid\nAccording to this thread, instead of \nClipboard.SetText(data);\nthe usage of\nClipboard.SetDataObject(data);\nshould fix that common WPF issue.. It is a helpful meta information without the need of any conversions.\nFor example, you don't need to convert the decklist information into a deckstring if you want to export the deck via deckstring. Conversions between deckstring and decklist can be faulty, the deckstring cannot.\nI think it is even the better GUID, because it identifies a deck uniquely while holding it's complete decklist at the same time. If I am correct, the GUID is randomly generated and has nothing to do with the deck's content.. Ah ok, I see the necessity of GUIDs.\nOn demand conversion is a good way here, if you rarely do exports to deckstrings.\nFor convenience reasons, one could give the Deck class a property named Deckstring which returns it's deckstring using the DeckSerializer.Serialize() method. Then you don't store double information and have easy access without the need to use Helper classes/methods.\nJust an idea. ;). It could be useful for addon devs like me!\nBut this is what we have extension methods for. ;)\nThanks nevertheless..

The quest ist not revealed or discarded, it is destroyed in your deck by skulking geist (like all other 1-mana spells).\nIf I understand @freakaz0id1 correctly, HDT doesn't recognize when spells get destroyed in your deck?\nI believe, this also happened to me with naturalize being in my deck when I played skulking geist....

    "Kamamura": "Hello, I am having the same problem, made an account just to be able to comment. \nProblem started with the 1.2.0 update (Ungoro cards introduction). I thought it was related to new cards not being out yet, but it persisted even after release. The problem manifests as HDT overlay not being visible when HS window has focus. However, when I switch focus to HDS, and for example change Opacity of the overlay, the overlay reappears, and changes opacity and/or position according to settings. However, the second focus returns to HS window, the Overlay immediately disappears - true for Full Screen and Window mode.\nHowever, the overlay is actually being rendered, because if I resize the HS window, or drag it around, the overlay sort of lags behind, and is briefly visible when the HS window is dragged/resized.\nThe problem disappears when HDT is run as administrator, however, for security reasons, I would prefer to run applications as HDT under a non-privileged user. I will assist in debugging if asked. \nAny assistance/solution would be greatly appreciated.\nThank you for your fantastic work. . Would any debug output help the author to determine the cause of the problem? I am affected when running the client unprivileged, and I am willing to provide assistance in troubleshooting. \nIt's clearly related to permissions, perhaps the most recent Windows update changed something critical?.

The latest version 5 is a partial solution for me. When I start HS, the overlay does not appear, and is rendered \"below\" the main output as before. However when I switch focus to HDT and then back to HS, the overlay is suddenly visible and works without problems until I close HS. \nSo not perfect, but much better than before. . Hello, I just want to report that the latest version 1.2.3 did not work for me without switching focus to the Decktracker and back. However, the problem seems to have corrected itself with the latest Windows 10 update. The Decktracker now works like it did before the problem appeared. My hypothesis is that Microsoft corrected a bug introduced in the previous update that originally broke the Decktracker. . ",

    "ManJelL": "Running the HDT in administrator didnt help me either. I'm using Windows 7 with the latest update. Tryed everything. Why is there no fix after one week?. It must have something to do with the order of the active windows. It sometimes apears randomly. Also disabling the overlay in the options a few times does make it show up. But it disapears again after you click somewhere in the game.. Whatever it is, what is causing this, it got something to do with the latest heartstone update. I didnt install any windows 7 updates until today (set to manual update-mode).. The latest build fixed it for me. Thank you!. Weird. I noticed that the card tooltips on the decklist dont apear ingame.. ",
    "rorgier10": "I also have the same problem, Hearthstone is on top above the decktracker. \nDecktracker still functions in all it's ways, like giving the wins and losses and flashing on the start of my turn.\nTried re installing Decktracker multiple times and restarting aswell. Running as admin does not do anything for me. (running windows 7)\nHopefully this gets fixed soon, love this application. \nIf I can help in any just ask.. Going to try this as soon as the hearthstone servers are working again, I'll update as soon as they work\n. Putting another application on top of hearthstone in windowed is possible like normal, if i put discord on top of hearthstone hearthstone still runs and all, but whenever clicking hearthstone discord goes to the background, but this is the same for all applications.\nWhile moving hearthstone in windowed mode the decks of the decktracker lack behind just a little so you can see them moving behind the hearthstone window and cathing up and going underneath it again.. The 1.2.2 overlay 3 seems to working fine for now, will try to see if all the settings work.\nI will update as soon as possible and post de HDT log aswell.\nUpdate: Does not work if you have Hide if HS in background checked on.\nUpdate 2: Here is the log:\ndpaste log. The hide HDT while HS is in background now works.\nhttp://dpaste.com/317J13T\n. For me it does yes.\nUpdate: Found a weird thing, whenever a match is finished it kinda alt-tabs me out of game for like 3 seconds and then goes back into it. (show the game but also the windows bar and all). Well it fixed the weid behavior at the end of a game, but now the overlay does not stay active after alt-tabbing out the game. It works just fine when starting the game and playing but as soon as I open another window the whole overlay is gone.. That is correct. \n(so at this moment the overlay 4 works the best for me, i only have to deal with the weird behavior after a match has ended for only like 3 seconds)\n. The overlay 6 only works with Hide if HS in background disabled. When I enable this it sits behind hearthstone again and we are back to the beginning for me atleast. Version 4 is the one I use now, because it works the best for me at this moment. \nIs there any way to fix the end game like disabling the thing what caused the weird behavior? (the child window thing) Because I feel the child window is what fixes it for me.\n. 5 got completely rid of the child window you said. And the thing is, the child window is what I think is fixing the problem for me, the only thing is, is that it is causing the weird behavior at the end of the game. my question was: is there a way so you could implement the child window and fix something at the end of the game (so i can alt tab my game and have the Hide if HS in background). After some fiddling with the options 6 seems to be working for me aswell now.\nHere are the logs still:\nWith Hide if HS in background enabled: http://dpaste.com/20S30TN\nWith Hide if HS in background disabled: http://dpaste.com/1Q8NFS5. haha uhm well, I turned a lot of things on and off and ended up with the same settings, but now everything was working... sorry that this does not help at all. I am using graveyard, heartharena and trouble at the mill. Also using msi afterburner overlay. I have tried turning them off but it seems not to matter. However I think turning those off and back on again made overlay 6 work for me.( Not 100% sure)\n. Now it does not work anymore when Hide when HS in background is active. \nVersion 6 was working fine, even on the startup.. @azeier Well you might be right. after trying version 8 a couple of times. It somehow works. The same thing with 6. The first use is not working, restarting HDT and everything works fine like it should. No idea what is causing that first time to not work though.. For me the 1.2.3 overlay9 works for me.\nFun/weird side note: after 2 weeks of just using an older version (1.2.2overlay8) for some reason the 1.2.3 normal version worked for me. not a clue why.. ",
    "MonsieurChaunce": "Hey was just about to respond when you closed it. I'm having the same problem and I'm almost positive it's a layers issue. The tracker will show up when you mess with its setting but as soon as you go back into the game it disappears. The player window will have the same exact behavior unless you check the topmost option for it like you said. Once that's checked it remains visible while everything else is behind hearthstone client. \nI should also note that you can sometimes get the normal deck tracker window to stay up in the client while messing with its settings under options, but I have yet to find a reliable way to replicate that behavior it seems hit or miss on what causes it to stay up until you tab out of the client again. Hope this helps with a fix! Good luck. The latest build worked for me on fixing whatever the problem was, I'll send logs when I'm home from work tonight.. ",

    "WillGresham": "Hopefully this will be useful. I installed HDT a few days ago and saw the issue immediately (v1.2.3). HDT has not previously been installed on this computer. OS is Windows 7 SP1.\nNotes on issue:\n- Running as Admin has no bearing on the issue being present for me\n- Issue occurs while game is running in Fullscreen mode only while the 'Hide if HS is in background' option is off\n- Running windowed seems to keep the deck tracker on top regardless\n- Issue happens in regardless of if you're in a menu or a game.\nAdditionally, the issue does not seems to be occurring when changing focus using Alt+Tab, only when interacting with the HS icon in the task bar or bringing focus back by clicking on the HS window (e.g. multiple screen setup)\nSteps to reproduce:\n- Open HDT (Not as Admin, enable show in menu if required, ensure 'Hide if HS is in background' is NOT enabled)\n- Open HS (Ensure Fullscreen)\n- Focus on another application by clicking on it or by tabbing out of HS\n- Using your mouse, either select the HS icon in the task bar, or select the HS window if still visible\n- Repeat the above 2 steps\nThe HDT overlay disappears for me at this point consistently (Drop and regain focus on HS twice with mouse interaction). As mentioned above, this only seems to be happening in Fullscreen, and when changing focus with the Mouse.

Are the replacement cards added to the deck list once they're drawn? (Is it just the new cards in hand that \"did not originate from your deck\" or is that all cards?)\nA bit confusing since cards inserted into your deck, e.g. by Raptor Hatchling or Elise Trailblazer, do appear in the list. Then again, I guess the cards added to your hand from the Un'Goro Pack spell itself don't get added to the list.\nI know there's an option for showing/hiding \"gift\" cards in your opponent's deck list (\"Include created cards\"); maybe something similar for your own deck list would be nice.. Makes sense. I doubt I'll have another Renounce Darkness anytime soon to test with, so feel free to close this if you think it's WAI.. Is there a way to force Wild format during tests? Or to just not use any state that the build may have lying around?\nThe alternative is to ensure Standard only secrets are being checked, e.g. replace HunterSecrets.All in the test with HunterSecrets.GetCards(true), but then we're only testing Standard.. To clarify, the test failure continues after closing the Hearthstone client (and the deck tracker of course).\nI actually didn't run the tests until after the first time I launched and exited my build, so I never saw these tests pass at first. I assumed they were just broken, and it wasn't until I started debugging it that I found the root of the problem.. understood, I have no affiliation with the site -- thanks though!. er, this is when searching the Options overlay, not the deckbuilder @judge2020 .

I'd prefer to make this a generic public abstract class OptionWrapper<T> because we really want to parameterize OptionControl. For instance, CheckBoxWrapper would be an OptionWrapper<CheckBox> whose OptionControl is already a CheckBox, so it wouldn't need a separate CheckBox property that refers to the same control as OptionControl.\nBut I couldn't make that work with collections. eg, I couldn't find a way to do this:\nprivate List<OptionWrapper<T>> LoadWrappers()\n{\n  var optionWrappers = new List<OptionWrapper<T>>; \n  // ...  \n}\nAny thoughts? I haven't touched C# in 9 years.... Actually I found a way to do this by making an interface. Here's what that looks like diffed against this PR. But maybe that's more complicated than it's worth? Deriving an OptionWrapper<T> from an interface OptionWrapper is weird to me, coming from C++.. Done. Sweet. Done in a few places.. Done.. Done.. Done.. ",

I am normally fairly good at troubleshooting but this is a bit beyond me... :(. yes ran the repair tool, all good. its windows 10 with all latest updates and its 64 bit\ncan anyone make sense of the 'stacktrace'?. I suppose there could be something corrupt within my .NET framework the fix tool didn't manage to correct. The non-installer version throws up the same error (held out hope there for a bit). I tried uninstalling the .NET framework 4.7 from control panel and reinstalling it but the installation says it won't install because a newer version is already installed on my machine (this is after uninstalling ver 4.7 and restarting my pc). Any way I can totally uninstall all components of the .NET framework on my pc and then reinstall?. I would appreciate any advice since I've grown so accustomed to playing HS with my decktracker, I don't feel like playing without it :(. Alright, I have done as instructed. Here are the results:\n\nHere is the dism.log (txt):\ndism.log.txt\nHere is the cbs.log (txt):\nCBS.log.txt\nNot sure about the 'source' option mentioned in the cmd dialog. I ugraded my win8.1 to win10 via the free upgrade microsoft provided to windows users, so I have a folder on c: called 'Windows10Upgrade', but thats about it.\nAs for the sfc /scannow results, this was actually the first thing I did after the crash and the results were the same as shown in the cmd dialog above (pic) - of course I don't pretend to understand the cbs.log.\nDo you think I should reboot and use advanced recovery options to reboot into command prompt and try these two operations again? I don't see how that would solve the 'source' problem from the dism operation though.....\nAs always, your advice would be much appreciated, I am at the limits of my tech savvy-ness \n. At a raised command prompt, /StartComponentCleanup returns this error:\n\nafterwhich sfc /scannow retuns the same error as before.\nUsed media tools to create the ISO as instructed, mounted to G: then executed the dism command with the drive changed to G: instead of F:\nThis returned the same error as before, as did the subsequent sfc /scannow operation\nAfter these operations, dism checkhealth returned this:\n\nI even found these links and basically tried these approaches:\nhttp://www.thewindowsclub.com/dism-fails-source-files-could-not-be-found\nhave not tried this one yet (it seems not to really fix anything that isn't already working):\nhttp://www.thewindowsclub.com/repair-corrupt-windows-image-error-0x800f0906\nThoughts? Advice? Tweaks to the procedure? Thank you for your continued assistance, in advance.. @Bert-Proesmans yeah, I know a clean install would definitely solve the problem, but there are so many application plugins and add-ons that I no longer know where the licenses are or even where the installation files are. I am a video editor, you can imagine how many plug-ins and independent add-ons I've piled on to my Adobe Suite over the years. They literally number in the hundreds from Photoshop to Premiere to After Effects. \nA clean install would basically mean losing all of them, some of which I use regularly in my work. I usually take great care with my machine but a lightning strike caused a power outage which caused this crash, which was a particularly bad one since it was in the middle of some processor intensive stuff.\nWhat do you guys think? Is a clean install my only option here?\n. Here's the log:\ndism.log.txt\nDid all the above steps both in safe mode and by rebooting into raised command prompt. Same results.\n. Also tried the steps in the two articles listed at the bottom of the last post with screengrabs, also in safe mode and again in (rebooted into) command prompt . Hmm, that makes sense. I don't understand what I found in the places you asked me to look though:\n\nAnd in the windows folder:\n\n\n. Do I have to set a value for dism to recognise the windows boot source I created as source? Should there already be a value set or is there usually not?. @Bert-Proesmans , appreciate the continued assistance. Hope it doesn't take too much of your time.. @Bert-Proesmans  thanks for the advice. I'll try it. But the restore keeps personal files and wipes installed programs and apps - I can't do that. So if the dism modifications don't work, I'll have to get used to playing HS without the deck tracker again, which will be a pity. It makes the game so much more involved, competitive and interesting to play (without having to resort to a pen and paper.. I'll leave the thread open for any of your fellow Windows geniuses who happen by, trip on a rock and fall down this rabbit hole.. @Bert-Proesmans  - I encountered a snag trying to follow that last try you gave me - in trying to find the right index, the dism operation returned the following error (this is after I mounted the ISO on H:):\n\nI tried it again having extracted the entire contents of the ISO to a formatted thumbdrive (also H:\\ but an actual drive instead of a virtual one this time) and the result was the same. Any idea what is causing this error?. I also checked my directory as you displayed (yours) above - I have the same 20 files, no differences.. Actually there isn't a 'install.wim' there. But there is a 'install.esd'. So, running the command returns 'File not found'.\nWhy isn't there a 'install.wim' in my iso image? How do I rectify this?. @riQQ the previous comment was in response to your question. Well spotted, by the way.. @ @Zawodowiec1532 Thanks, will try.\n. @Zawodowiec1532 ok, tried it multiple times with different indexes with the same error each time:\n\nI don't see how trying it in safe mode would find the source any better. Sigh.\n. @Zawodowiec1532 if you mean this:\n\nthen yes I have tried it already. No help.\nI'm looking through the links you sent and trying to decipher them as best I can.\n\"Try this command again without :esd: prefix\" - which command?\n\"If this not help, probably you can mount this image manually.\nDism /Mount-Image /ImageFile:C:\\test\\images\\myimage.esd /index:1 /MountDir:C:\\test\\offline\" - \nI assume you mean change C: to the drive letter of my image.\nI have tried doing it two ways previously - by using a physical USB for the image file so it does not need mounting and has its own drive letter and second, by using PowerISO to mount the ISO version of the image to a virtual drive.

I have three monitors, scaled 150% 150% and 100% (2 UHD, 1 1080p), and setting them all to any consistent screen scaling seems to work. Furthermore, turning on this compatibility option for the HDT executable (\"override high DPI scaling behaviour\") seems to force the issue and allow me to use mixed scaling (requires a restart of HDT to take effect)\n\n. You might like to try this workaround in the meantime.. ",
    "strican": "Just to comment, it looks like the issue is that the app is only System DPI aware rather than Per-Monitor DPI aware. Here's some more details.\nIt also appears that there is a related issue in that Metro Windows are not DPI aware.. After looking at this for a while today, I'm not sure my previous assessment was actually correct. It does appear that the system properly handles any calls for apps that are not Per Monitor DPI Aware. Everything still scales appropriately, and the any value the app sees is just converted to use the system DPI.\nHowever, there's a difference in behavior when the app is fullscreen and windowed. When windowed (or when attached to another windowed app), the value we get for ClientToScreen is appropriately scaled. However, in fullscreen the value we get is exactly the screen size in raw pixels.\nFor example, here's my setup:\n\nPrimary monitor: 3840x2160 at 250% scale factor\nSecondary monitor: 3840x2160 at 150% scale factor\n\nWhen fullscreen, the values we get from GetClientRect is 2304x1296. After ClientToScreen, we get 3840x2160, which is exactly the screen size. However, if you go windowed, you'll actually get the same scale factor after the ClientToScreen call, just accounting for the offset in screen coordinates.\nYou'll note that 2304 = 3840 x 1.5 / 2.5, so something is getting crossed in the system such that it forgets that it's supposed to hide the actual system scale factor from us. My theory is that the window in fullscreen mode uses some DirectX optimizations, thus taking control over the scale factor, making the system think it's being scaled by a factor of 1.\nSince as far as I can tell, we're getting the wrong values from ClientToScreen, I'm not sure if this is actually actionable at the moment. I'll try digging around to see if this is a known issue, but I haven't found anything yet.. Hey, @Ivniinvi, can you provide some more details? I'm not able to repro this locally. The win tracking seems to be ignoring dungeon runs for me.. ",

Even when I have Innkeeper AND HDT turned off and uninstalled, I'm still getting these funky blacked out graphics.~~\n~~Now, the question is, in my talks with Blizzard, did it work fine?~~\n~~Ugh, thank you for your help, and sorry for bothering.~~\n. As it turns out, I was incorrect: HDT was running as a process in the system tray. When I uninstalled Overwolf and Innkeeper, the only deciding factor between when there were or weren't graphical glitches was when HDT was open, regardless of what order it was opened in, before or after HS. . Strangely, I was able to somewhat resolve the issue: by disabling fullscreen in Hearthstone. When I disable full screen and then just maximize the window, I can't get the graphical errors to occur. . Alright, I have (sort of, temporarily) fixed the problem. \n\u2022 In the Blizzard App, select the Options drop down in the Hearthstone tab and select Show in Explorer\n\u2022 Right-click on Hearthstone.exe and select Properties\n\u2022 Go to the Compatibility tab and check the box \u2018Disable fullscreen optimizations\u2019\n\u2022 Press Apply and OK\nFor whatever, reason, after I've done those steps, I can fullscreen Hearthstone with (as yet) no problems. I will update this later after a day of rigorous play depending on how well it lasted.. Except that, as far as I can find, support has stopped for it and there's no tracking for Witchwood. . Okay, great!\nBut I have to ask, why is the plugin in 'Outdated Plugins' if there's functionality separate from what HDT does on its own?. I'd still prefer if that functionality were just migrated over, like the rest of it has been, but since there's a workaround, I suppose there's no reason to keep it open further. . I'd prefer HDT, just like the plugin had it, or something similar. Like, just a popup when you open the store, that shows you the chances of getting a card for a deck (or a card you don't have), next to each pack.\n. ",

Hello Hunter,\nActually, even the fall creators build (which I run) doesn\u2019t come with 4.7.1.   I have installed the SDK & RTs for development purposes for the IDE.\nThere are many changes since .NET 4.5.   You can read them on the version history for the .NET Framework and specifically for only v4.7.1 here https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet/tree/master/releases/net471 .\nThe work for the PR is to fix many vulnerabilities for NPE hotpoint and exception prone areas.    This is not really a necessity, but upgrading to the new compiler build configuration required that I fix the hierarchy of the namespaces for many of the files that were not in their corresponding folders.  Everything was intertwined.  The build configurations for the dependency libraries (in my PR) now support .NET Core 2.0 & .NET 4.7.1 framework for anybody who wishes to compile against them in the future.\nIn efforts to try to make the HSDT proj the same way, it really wasn\u2019t possible.   Many of the libraries like System.Drawing and Xaml and bunches of GUI aren\u2019t supported in Core yet.. which is why Xamarin still exists.\nI spent lots of hours trying to at least use the new CLA for it, but I couldn\u2019t get it to work.\nWhat I do have now, is something in between both for the new HSDT project build configuration.

Hello Alex,\nThank you for getting back to me!\nYes, I understand you are busy.  I acknowledged that the last time I had heard from you.\nIn regards to the PR, I have gone ahead and branched a copy yesterday and went over every diff within it 2x already over the past few weeks.   It looks correct.\nThe build configurations have completely changed.  All of these changes are updates to the libraries and the outdated framework versioning.\nTo build against assemblies not x-targeted for .NET Core or STD simply won\u2019t work.   I have repacked the dependency assemblies to make this happen and it is strong named signed.\nYou can read more about the advantages and improvements here:\n https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/cesardelatorre/2016/06/27/net-core-1-0-net-framework-xamarin-the-whatand-when-to-use-it/#why-dotnet-core\nThere still are a few reasons for strong naming an assembly, and if you need to, there are new options for reducing the pain, including (OSS signing and automatic binding redirects)\nIn regards to updated to .NET Core..  means that this project will only ever be allowed to run on Windows.   The GUI library support is not a feature set of CORE yet.. which is why Xamarin still exists.  But it will be around the corner.. hence the reason why the msbuild configuration to CLP was not possible after spending efforts to try and get this to work.  It will crap out on the Xaml stuff.    Also, there are some problems with the AutoGenerateBindingRedirects.    About 4 of the xaml files that specifically used the MahApps library I couldn\u2019t get to work with the new build configuration.\nHence, I have had to settle for one that is in-between what is currently being used today at the ones found in the dependency assemblies I have provided in my release.\nYou should be able to see the differences in the layout and changes with the build-tools in the UI under the References section.\nI spent days on trying to make this happen.. and I spent at least 3 weeks in the changes relating to the PR.   I am volunteering my efforts on this for the betterment of the project and the community at no cost.\nThis should answer your last two questions.   It doesn\u2019t matter one way or another if the current project is in .NET 4.5.  In fact, it requires that I install those RT\u2019s just to get the project to work anyway.\nOne reasons is because outdated versions of .NET Framework do not come out of the box installed in Windows 10.  You can add these separate but it comes with v4.6-v4.6.2.   The new version v1709 is said to run on 4.7.\nSo, why is it that if I need to use a framework version that has about 10x less features and fixes to that of the latest one, that I wouldn\u2019t just install the most recent version?  Since I have to install 4.5 anyway, why not just install the latest one instead just to get the project to work?\nMany projects now have updated their libraries to target against framework versions greater than >=  v4.5.   This means that you will NOT be able to use them until you update the framework version of your project to match. \nAlso, during my PR, I had went ahead and updated the NuGet package versions just because it is a 1-click easy to do thing and make sure everything is up-to-date.\nWhether it is required or not, is a matter of debate.   Internal issues may be present within these 3rd party assemblies that you and I are obviously unaware of without inspection.   This could be one of the reasons for why there is an update being provided to begin with.   Without changing major build versions, semantics should be the same and if not, suddle ones at best.   I have already made sure after doing this, that the project compiles so that validates any discrepancies to those concerns.\nIf you have any additional questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to ask.  There is much to learn with this project and I have many questions I wish to know in other sections of the project as well.. It was recommended that I try to split this PR into 2-4 smaller ones.\nI have since done this for :\n1.  ResourceGenerator\n2. Build configuration migration\n3.  Hotpoint / NPE cleanup\n4.  Namespace refactoring to match the new build configurations are still left in this one here.\nIn fact, all 4x issues are bundled into this PR as final release on my fork in (master).. The build configurations have been considerably consolidated and updated completely to support the new format.  It is not dependant upon .NET Core at all.  In fact, I do not include the 'FrameworkVersion'  to include Core in the main ASM.  Dependency assemblies support both and they compile just fine and were easy to port since they are APIs which do not necessarily include XAML page files and resources.\nNote, these build configurations are easier to use / add plugins / resources / NuGet packages / etc. and have better handling for binding redirects.\nUpdating the framework allows the project to be able to use 3rd party plugins / libraries that are compiled with targeted framework versions greater than what the project currently supports.  Since my system does not have .NET 4.5 installed nor does it even come with Widows 10, would require that I have to install the RTs and SDK anyway.\nAlso, there are benefits to upgrading, as newer features and fixes are within the framework itself.  This can be illustrated as depicted in my fork; specifically, for the NuGet packages being used in the ResourceGenerator v2 upgrade required as example.\nAs for squirrel, and everything else in the project, it should work the same and backwards compatible.    I removed a few references / usings in which it wasn't being used in the file as code cleanup / analyzers depicted.   Yet, these appeared to be identified in somebody else's commit as noticeable inference anyway. \nI do know that I am getting the dialog window to appear OnLoad, prompting to do a code update, but I hadn't initiated it to test as of yet.\nThis PR looks rather large. I am thinking it has mostly to do with refactoring the namespaces to be in alignment with the folder hierarchy matching default build rules within the new build configuration now.\nSee also:\n```\n     App.xaml \n\n<!-- XAML elements -->\n<Page Include=\"**\\*.xaml\" SubType=\"Designer\" Generator=\"MSBuild:Compile\" Exclude=\"App.xaml\" />\n<Compile Update=\"**\\*.xaml.cs\" SubType=\"Designer\" DependentUpon=\"%(Filename)\" />\n\n<!-- Resources -->\n<Resource Include=\"Images\\**\\*.ico\" />\n<Resource Include=\"Images\\**\\*.png\" />\n<Resource Include=\"Resources\\**\\*.png\" />\n<Resource Include=\"Resources\\**\\*.jpg\" />\n<Resource Include=\"Resources\\Chunkfive.otf\" />\n\n```\nGlobbing has been restored to nest the designer file under the page.\nI am not totally sold on intellisense working in XAML with this.\nI believe that the Generator should change from Generator=\"MSBuild:Compile\" to Generator=\"MSBuild:XamlIntelliSenseFileGenerator\"\nIf anybody wants to confirm this & resolve... that would be great!\nIf you go on Gitub/dotnet and read the experimental workarounds for support we are trying to add with the new build configurations and compiler, you can see it is rather challenging.    XAML is not a feature of .NET Core yet and using new build configurations that potentially can target ALL frameworks has its qwirks.\nFirst of all, default build rules are now internal.  Targets for pre-build / post-build & its synopsis have changed and specific concerns relating to CLP as illustrated here.\nSetting the XAML pages to be Included (instead of Updated) && enabled within the VS IDE, disable the file completely.  This breaks the designer entirely and will not get the project to load properly as discovered.  It took me several attempts and weeks to figure out how to get this to work properly and extensive research all over the internet as workaround.\nIn my previous PR, it addressed a compromise (medium) of this new release and the original one found within the project.   But, I finally was able to get it working with the new build configuration this weekend.\nAlso, without having to use explicit rules to enable backwards compatibility support for old MSBuild rules and conventions requires that additional rules be added to handle the XAML files.   By default, we can see rules added above to specifically override **\\*.*  -  But this does not support globbing, so I have added a line to fix that.\nTo keep the build configuration small and tidy and the project namespaces consistent, refactoring should persist to preserve ordering and adhere to the new build rules.\nFinally, the main UI assembly must be forced to compile as x86 to keep visibility to the dependency Process.Module assemblies that are required to load .. specifically \"mono.dll\" -\n \"Hearthmirror\\ProcessView.cs\" since \"Hearthstone.exe\" is targeting x86.\n\"You have to compile your program using the same architecture as the target-process. The target-process loaded modules that establish x86-support on x64-OS, hence you got to compile using x86-architecture in order to aquire x86-modules from the target-process.\" - Zat\nDependency assemblies can be targeted to AnyCPU, which will support both and SN'd now to add reference to the GAC or dependent assemblies that may require it in the future.  Also, it is possible that migrations can be made to now 'pack' dependency project assemblies as NuGet packages and have bootstrap automation update the packages with NuGet package manager & restore.   This will eliminate much of what the confusing batch files are doing for handling this today and make visibility & versioning easier to work with as shown by the elimination / modifications of particular batch files in my PRs.. See reference 3539. This looks pretty consolidated now!   Anybody care to code review this?. ResourceGenerator now migrated into a nupkg.\nPostBuild.bat now eliminated and integrated as pre-load into DeckTracker.Core startup internal.\nSee release notes for ResourceGenerator and project here.. 6 months later you just now get to this?. Somebody recently had made these changes.. where they took out the RelativeSource=foo\nI just merged it as is..  take it up with the other guy.  There were about 2-4 of these.\n\nRelativeSource={RelativeSource AncestorType=deckPicker:DeckPickerItem}}\"\n\nAlso there were a couple changes where  Margin=\"5\" was removed on select .xaml files.\nI only merged them!

I did not make changes to the GUIs.

This exact problem is also happening to me. From the user side it seem to happen randomly after playing some matches, from the developer side I don't know what is causing that.. @ArsileLuci  well, you are humble, but things as they are: it is critical bug since HDT was developed to track our cards, and due to this bug it can't do its main task.. The problem still happen with the debug version. @riQQ has pointed a hint about this issue could be related with Baku, I don't know but the next log file has logged two matches, the first one versus a warrior it was all ok, but the second match the opponent had Baku and HDT switched our hero and decks...\nhdt_log - Baku changes cards.txt\n11:47:19 PM|Warning|TurnTimer.Start >> Waiting for player entity\n11:47:20 PM|Info|TagChangeActions.SetHeroAsync >> Found hero with id=76\n11:47:20 PM|Info|GameEventHandler.SetPlayerHero >> Player=Rogue\n11:47:20 PM|Info|TagChangeActions.SetHeroAsync >> Found hero with id=78\n11:47:20 PM|Info|GameEventHandler.SetOpponentHero >> Opponent=Druid\nI was the druid and my opponent was the rogue:\n\n. Everything seem to work fine with the 1.7.5 DEBUG version, I wonder when these changes will be applied to the normal release version.. I didn't suffered it anymore, seems fixed.. Will the developer(s) fix this issue?, HDT will be useless while it can't be used for its main purpose due this bug.... Hi, thanks for support this issue. I'm writting this comment because I answered to the other issue with Baku ( https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/issues/3743#issuecomment-412299982 ) but I can't play HS to test this other problem until some hours later after now, just I'm writting this to let know that I'm not ignoring this problem, I will test it in some hours from now and then I'll say whether it still happen or not. Then in some hours I will edit this comment to remove all this and follow the discussion.. Ok so I tried the debug version for a couple of hours, I played about 20 games (many of them I conceded at mulligan), and at first I was hopeful that the error would not happen because before using this debug version the problem was happening in an average of after 2-3 matches, and during the first hours playing with this debug version everything went well, however, in the last game (which is also the last game recorded in the log) the problem happened again: my deck tracker wasn't updated for the entire match.\nHere is the log of my full session playing: hdt_log.txt\nPS: the problematic match starts at line 3479.. Of course, here is the Power.log, It had a size of 20 mb so I cutted it, in this log you can see the last two matches I had with player name: De3#2127, which are the same last two matches recorded in the hdt_log.txt that I provided above. The second match with that player is when the problem has occured in HDT...\nPower_.log\nIf helpful, I noticed PlayerID=1 and PlayerID=2 are switched in the second match, that means something important, or maybe it just mean the order of the player which starts at the first turn?..
