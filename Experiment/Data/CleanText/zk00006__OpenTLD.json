Clarification please: Is it necessary to use OpenCV Version 2.2 for some feature, or did you just install the latest, and would 2.1 be sufficient? \nReason I ask is because at least on many linux distros (e.g Ubuntu), there is no packaged version of 2.2 available yet, and having to build it manually could be difficult.

Fair enough.\nSo far it was really straightforward. Octave is coded for matlab compatibility after all.\nOutside of compile.m (which is only executed once for a code version, and therefore not relevant performance-wise) I see 4 instances of such an if-then (commit #ba6deda96c8881e502d298319abbe4dfca9f2281), of which 1 is in the init_workspace.m (which is probably also only executed once per run), and 2 could probably be eliminated by adjusting the code slightly. One of those is most probably (but not yet confirmed) a capitalization problem (FSPECIAL should be fspecial), the other a matrix dimension mismatch matlab ignores/compensates for, but octave recognizes.\nOf course it's your decision not to merge, but I don't think that the if/then statements alone will impact performance significantly; much more performance loss will come from algorithms/functions which are much slower in octave than in matlab (I think pdist() may be a candidate). Just one way to find out. Maybe I'm wrong :-)\nSo, do you want to make a TLD-octave branch, and merge the PR into that?

Install 32-bit MATLAB, then try again... I'm out of options.\n\nGood luck,\n- Ray.\n. Awesome, that's what I thought.  I haven't changed the code and recompiled yet.... but I'm wondering if this would make a significant effect to the results, in comparison to what has already been published.  Has anyone tried?  If not, I'll most likely do it over the next few days, and see what the results look like on the already provided test image sequence.  Either way, awesome work!\n. Dear Sballest:\nFirst Issue:  This is already being done.  If you look at the tldExample.m code, the positions of the bounding boxes across all of the frames are being stored in tld.bb.  tld.bb is a 4 x N array, where in each column, the first two elements denote the x,y co-ordinates of the top-left corner, and the last two of the bottom-right corner.\nSecond Issue:  These are stored as pX, pEx, nX, nEx.  pX and pEx.  pX and pEx are the feature vectors, and image patches of object model over the video sequence that are labelled positive, and are belonging to the object.  nX and nEx are the same as the previous, but are for the negative labelled ones.  All you would have to do is modify the code so that you skip the training, and re-use these before starting to tracker code.  I haven't done it myself, but that's what you'd do.\nHope this helps,\n- Ray.\n. Oh yes... just to make it clear, for the first issue, N is the total # of frames in the image sequence... just so that there's no confusion.\nGood luck!\n- Ray.\n. Hello,\nY[I] is a label array that determines what's a positive and what's a negative sample.  Y[I] = 1 means that the I'TH bounding box is denoted as positive, meaning that the object should be contained within this box.  Similar situation for the negative.\nNow, x would be an N x 1 vector (in this case, N is 10 in the current implementation), where each element of the vector is the output of 1 fern in the forest.  Each element is a 13-bit binary number, where each bit is a feature.  Each feature is related to the signed difference between two random locations.  Therefore, for each bounding box, we will have 10 sets (ferns) of random locations.  There are 13 random locations for each set (13 features per fern).  Therefore, each output of a fern is placed in a location in x.\nNow, measure_forest(x) determines the probability that given the bounding box, which is denoted by the aforementioned vector, that the object is contained within the bounding box.  Remember, you figure out the x value from the measure_bbox_offset() function.  This function will give you your feature vector x.  Also, the random locations for each fern is determined by the tldGenerateFeatures.m MATLAB script.\nNow, once you have this, you look at each fern output (each element of the vector), and determine the a posteriori probability that this particular fern output belongs to a positive sample.  Remember, each fern will have positive and negative histograms.  Once you determine the feature vector from the fern, you look up the number of positive and negative samples using this feature vector as the index (let's call them nP and nN respectively), and to determine the probability, you would do (nP / (nP + nN)).  You do this for the rest of the ferns, and add up all of the probabilities over all ferns, and you average them out.\nNow, the reason why if(measure_forest(x) <= thrP) is there is because during training or re-training, if x belongs to a positive bounding box BUT it does not pass the threshold of thrP, this means that we have to update the forest.  If you read the paper, during the training phase, when we pass the threshold of 0.5, this should mean that the object is there, but if it isn't, you need add this positive sample to the forest.\nSimilarly, if you look at the thrN, if we use measure_forest(x) and it's GREATER than thrN... this means that the bounding box is classified to have the object in it, when it clearly SHOULDN'T be, so you need to update the tree again so that this negative sample is added to the forest.\nHope this helps,\n- Ray.\n. That's exactly it.  There's no point in adding this training value to the forest if the feature vector is already classified as positive.  Same thing for the negative samples too.  You nailed it right on the head.\nGlad to have helped!\nGood luck,\n- Ray.\n. Dear Krzysztof,\nYou need to take a look at the code at the beginning.  You'll see that when the list of positive and negative examples are initialized, the FIRST positive example is placed at the beginning of the list on purpose, followed by a random permutation of positive and negative examples.  This is done on purpose so that the model is trained properly.\ni.e.\nx = [pEx(:,1) x(:,idx)];\ny = [1 y(:,idx)];\nYou will then see that when the loop runs at the first iteration, there will always be one positive example added.  After, the model (positive or negative) keep increasing in size, once they pass certain tests.\nHope this helps,\n- Ray.\n. If you use the patch with OpenCV 2.2 it'll work.  I actually gave up after a certain point because the libraries weren't compiling for me.  I just installed the 32-bit version of MATLAB... easiest thing for me.\n. I don't know buddy.... install 32-bit MATLAB instead, then try doing it.  That's what I did.\nGood luck,\n- Ray.\n. Yup, a callback was written to do that.

Install 32-bit MATLAB, then try again... I'm out of options.\n\nGood luck,\n- Ray.\n. Awesome, that's what I thought.  I haven't changed the code and recompiled yet.... but I'm wondering if this would make a significant effect to the results, in comparison to what has already been published.  Has anyone tried?  If not, I'll most likely do it over the next few days, and see what the results look like on the already provided test image sequence.  Either way, awesome work!\n. Dear Sballest:\nFirst Issue:  This is already being done.  If you look at the tldExample.m code, the positions of the bounding boxes across all of the frames are being stored in tld.bb.  tld.bb is a 4 x N array, where in each column, the first two elements denote the x,y co-ordinates of the top-left corner, and the last two of the bottom-right corner.\nSecond Issue:  These are stored as pX, pEx, nX, nEx.  pX and pEx.  pX and pEx are the feature vectors, and image patches of object model over the video sequence that are labelled positive, and are belonging to the object.  nX and nEx are the same as the previous, but are for the negative labelled ones.  All you would have to do is modify the code so that you skip the training, and re-use these before starting to tracker code.  I haven't done it myself, but that's what you'd do.\nHope this helps,\n- Ray.\n. Oh yes... just to make it clear, for the first issue, N is the total # of frames in the image sequence... just so that there's no confusion.\nGood luck!\n- Ray.\n. Hello,\nY[I] is a label array that determines what's a positive and what's a negative sample.  Y[I] = 1 means that the I'TH bounding box is denoted as positive, meaning that the object should be contained within this box.  Similar situation for the negative.\nNow, x would be an N x 1 vector (in this case, N is 10 in the current implementation), where each element of the vector is the output of 1 fern in the forest.  Each element is a 13-bit binary number, where each bit is a feature.  Each feature is related to the signed difference between two random locations.  Therefore, for each bounding box, we will have 10 sets (ferns) of random locations.  There are 13 random locations for each set (13 features per fern).  Therefore, each output of a fern is placed in a location in x.\nNow, measure_forest(x) determines the probability that given the bounding box, which is denoted by the aforementioned vector, that the object is contained within the bounding box.  Remember, you figure out the x value from the measure_bbox_offset() function.  This function will give you your feature vector x.  Also, the random locations for each fern is determined by the tldGenerateFeatures.m MATLAB script.\nNow, once you have this, you look at each fern output (each element of the vector), and determine the a posteriori probability that this particular fern output belongs to a positive sample.  Remember, each fern will have positive and negative histograms.  Once you determine the feature vector from the fern, you look up the number of positive and negative samples using this feature vector as the index (let's call them nP and nN respectively), and to determine the probability, you would do (nP / (nP + nN)).  You do this for the rest of the ferns, and add up all of the probabilities over all ferns, and you average them out.\nNow, the reason why if(measure_forest(x) <= thrP) is there is because during training or re-training, if x belongs to a positive bounding box BUT it does not pass the threshold of thrP, this means that we have to update the forest.  If you read the paper, during the training phase, when we pass the threshold of 0.5, this should mean that the object is there, but if it isn't, you need add this positive sample to the forest.\nSimilarly, if you look at the thrN, if we use measure_forest(x) and it's GREATER than thrN... this means that the bounding box is classified to have the object in it, when it clearly SHOULDN'T be, so you need to update the tree again so that this negative sample is added to the forest.\nHope this helps,\n- Ray.\n. That's exactly it.  There's no point in adding this training value to the forest if the feature vector is already classified as positive.  Same thing for the negative samples too.  You nailed it right on the head.\nGlad to have helped!\nGood luck,\n- Ray.\n. Dear Krzysztof,\nYou need to take a look at the code at the beginning.  You'll see that when the list of positive and negative examples are initialized, the FIRST positive example is placed at the beginning of the list on purpose, followed by a random permutation of positive and negative examples.  This is done on purpose so that the model is trained properly.\ni.e.\nx = [pEx(:,1) x(:,idx)];\ny = [1 y(:,idx)];\nYou will then see that when the loop runs at the first iteration, there will always be one positive example added.  After, the model (positive or negative) keep increasing in size, once they pass certain tests.\nHope this helps,\n- Ray.\n. If you use the patch with OpenCV 2.2 it'll work.  I actually gave up after a certain point because the libraries weren't compiling for me.  I just installed the 32-bit version of MATLAB... easiest thing for me.\n. I don't know buddy.... install 32-bit MATLAB instead, then try doing it.  That's what I did.\nGood luck,\n- Ray.\n. Yup, a callback was written to do that. You can comment out that code if you\nlike.\n. https://github.com/zk00006/OpenTLD/zipball/master\n. ",

    "freda82": "Hi!\nI know this issue have not been adressed in about 9 months but I will write here anyway=)\nI have a question regarding the traning phase as well.\nIn the code we use bootstrapping = 2 but we use the same traning samples in both bootstrapping runs. \nSo my question is:\n1. I'm a bit couries of how this bootstrapping process improve the classifier? \nWhen I started to think.. The number of positive and negative examples added in the forest will not necessarily be the same between the 2 runs due the order of negative and positive examples drawn from the permutation and the thresholds you mentioned above. \nOne thing that the bootstrapping process does with the current thresholds of pThrs = 0.5 and nThrs = 0.0 is that it will reduce the probability for getting a positive response from the forest for a certain patch. For example:\nIf we only hade one node n1 and we where to perform the bootstrapping process with the following sequence of positive and negative examples added to it:\nbootstrap run 1:\n1. p_ex added | pn = (nr_pex)/(nr_pex+nr_nex) = 1\n2. p_ex will not be added since pn > 0.5\n3. n_ex added | pn = 0,5 (nr_pex = 1, nr_ex = 1)\n4. n_ex added | pn = 1/3 (nr_pex = 1, nr_ex = 2)\n5. n_ex added | pn = 1/4 (nr_pex = 1, nr_ex = 3)\nBootstrap run 2:\n1. p_ex added | pn = 2/5 (nr_pex = 2, nr_ex = 3)\n2. p_ex added | pn = 3/6 (nr_pex = 3, nr_ex = 3)\n3. n_ex added | pn = 3/7 (nr_pex = 3, nr_ex = 4)\n4. n_ex added | pn = 3/8 (nr_pex = 3, nr_ex = 5)\n5. n_ex added | pn = 3/9 (nr_pex = 3, nr_ex = 6)\nFinal pn = 3/9.\nIf we where to adjust the thresholds pThrs = 1 we would have pn = 4/10 which would give a higher probability for it to give a positive response. So by changing these parameters in traning we can decide if the classifier should have a higher probability of giving a false positive then giving a positive false.\nIs this how you can see the bootstrapping process in TLD?\nBest regards\nFredrik\n.
