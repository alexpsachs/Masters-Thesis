    "JimBobSquarePants": "Does this also list stylecop analysers as a dependency in the output Nuget package?\n. A managed implementation would be amazing! :smile:  I've been really unhappy with the way I've had to implement seam carving at the moment. \n. Would this be something you would be interested in adding to V3?\n. From @KvanTTT on December 1, 2015 15:6\nI'am not interested in this library in near future :( I'am doing another things.\n. From @dampee on December 1, 2015 15:52\n@KvanTTT how difficult would it to port?\n. From @KvanTTT on December 1, 2015 16:43\n@dampee, I think it is not difficult. The only thing my library is using unsafe code snippent for performance reason (this may not compatible with Mono and some devices, but it can be removed). Are they allowed in ImageProcessor?\n. @KvanTTT  There's tons of unsafe code in Corefx https://github.com/dotnet/corefxlab/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=unsafe so I'm not opposed to using it in ImageProcessor. \nI avoided it before as I was targeting some old PCL stuff (WP8) which didn't support it but I'm sure now there are places within my codebase which could benefit. Would need lots of testing to determine where though.\n@dampee If you're gonna attempt a port I would test unsafe vs safe blocks to see whether there is a speedup since we're not using System.Drawing anymore. It may be the case that it could even slow things down.\n. From @dampee on December 2, 2015 0:17\nDon't worry (yet).  I'll touch first some simple things by the end of the year.  Just looking around what I can do.  (But too busy right now for customers)\n. From @voidstar69 on January 23, 2016 14:27\n@JimBobSquarePants is this the sort of change that you are looking for?\nChanging Color.Lerp from this:\n```\n    public static Color Lerp(Color from, Color to, float amount)\n    {\n        amount = amount.Clamp(0f, 1f);\n    if (Math.Abs(from.A - 1) < Epsilon && Math.Abs(to.A - 1) < Epsilon)\n    {\n        return from + (to - from) * amount;\n    }\n\n    // Premultiplied.\n    return from * (1 - amount) + to;\n}\n\n```\nto this:\n```\n    public static Color Lerp(Color from, Color to, float amount)\n    {\n        amount = amount.Clamp(0f, 1f);\n    if (Math.Abs(from.A - 1) < Epsilon && Math.Abs(to.A - 1) < Epsilon)\n    {\n        return Vector4.Lerp(from, to, amount);\n    }\n\n    // Premultiplied.\n    // TODO: not sure how to use Vector4.Lerp here\n    return from * (1 - amount) + to;\n}\n\n```\nmight improve performance by making use of the Vector4.Lerp method (need to measure performance to be certain).\n. You're absolutely correct. I can use the built in Vector4.Lerp in that situation. The Color minus operator utilizes the backing vector but we might as well cut out the middle man.\nThe code, I believe, would be: \nreturn Vector4.Lerp(from.backingVector, to.backingVector, amount);\nFor premultiplied alpha we'd probably have to fall back to the non SIMD approach. \nI'd imagine it would be a very tiny performance improvement but every little most certainly helps.\n. I think it might be possible to vectorize bits and bobs throughout, maybe in colorspace conversions or running through lists. I know the subsampling scaling in jpeg decoder is vectorised in libjpeg turbo also. \nI just don't know the Numerics API's well enough though to figure out what could benefit. . Closing this. @antonfirsov has done incredible work to implement vectorization throughout the library.. From @christopherbauer on January 11, 2016 3:50\nLooks like we have the two missing color spaces merged into the v3 branch.\n. Yup... Forgot to close this. Thanks!\n. From @tompazourek on January 16, 2016 14:19\nI wrote a .NET library that deals with color spaces. Might be useful:\nhttps://github.com/tompazourek/Colourful\n. Hi Tom,\nI'm sure that would be very useful. Would it be possible for you to cast your eye over the work we have done already to see if we have done anything daft?\nCheers\nJames \n. From @tompazourek on January 17, 2016 13:14\nHi James,\nI had a brief look at the color conversions. Just few observations and notes:\n- Note that in the RGB color space the color is unambiguous only if accompanied by an RGB color space (working space). For, example this means that when you have an RGB triplet (0.6, 0.7, 0.1), it will represent slightly different colors if you say that the color space is sRGB or other (Apple RGB, Adobe RGB, CIE RGB). But I guess that for simplicity, you can just assume that all RGB triplets are in sRGB. Each of these RGB color spaces can have different reference colors, reference white points and different mechanisms for compressing the channels from their linear versions.\n- For XYZ and LAB color spaces, the color is unambiguous only if the reference white point is specified since the XYZ and LAB triplets are always relative to it. So if you have an XYZ triplet relative to D65 white point and the same triplet relative to D50 white point, each of these represent a different color since the D65 white is a bit more bluer than D50 white. If you don't have the white point, you cannot really tell what color it is, you can only assume that it might be D65 or D50 since these two are very common and these two are also used in most of the RGB spaces. If you convert from RGB and don't perform any transformation that would change the white point (these transformations are called chromatic adaptations - like Bradford chromatic adaptation), the target reference white point will be the same as the RGB white point (in sRGB space it is D65). It's possible that the coefficients that you use for conversion already contain some chromatic adaptation that will make the output white point different than D65 from sRGB. I didn't investigate that far.\n-  When you're converting from RGB triplet to XYZ/LAB triplet, the RGB channels have to be linear before conversion, otherwise the results will not be correct. It's possible that the coefficients that you use for conversion already have the transformation from normal RGB to linear RGB in them. I didn't investigate that far. To battle the issue where I don't know if an RGB color is linear or compressed, I separated those in two color spaces in my library: RGBColor and LinearRGBColor. Not sure if this is possible or good decision in ImageProcessor.\nFor verifying if the conversions are correct, I always used this website, since I believe it yields good results: http://www.brucelindbloom.com/index.html?Eqn_RGB_XYZ_Matrix.html (the RGB you use will probably be sRGB, the white point of XYZ/LAB will be probably either D65 or D50 in your case). This might be useful for some tests that the numbers are alright. \nNote that if you'd decide to implement all this hassle with white points, you might for example be able to easily do things like white balance correction. However the white-point-aware and RGB-workin-space-aware conversions require more work and might not perform well and be more difficult to optimize.\n. Thanks Tom,\nThis is all excellent feedback which I really appreciate! :+1: I'll annotate your input with my response to make it clear for anyone following what we are talking about.\n\nNote that in the RGB color space the color is unambiguous only if accompanied by an RGB color space (working space). For, example this means that when you have an RGB triplet (0.6, 0.7, 0.1), it will represent slightly different colors if you say that the color space is sRGB or other (Apple RGB, Adobe RGB, CIE RGB). But I guess that for simplicity, you can just assume that all RGB triplets are in sRGB. Each of these RGB color spaces can have different reference colors, reference white \n\nThe Color struct defaults to the sRGB colorspace. I chose this since jpeg uses that as default (bitmap too?)  and it's by far the most common format. Realistically I should be specifying the color format since gif or png files do not require gamma correction for interpolation etc in order to produce the correct output. This, at present, is leading me to perform unnecessary conversion to linear RGB when working with those image formats.\n\nFor XYZ and LAB color spaces, the color is unambiguous only if the reference white point is specified since the XYZ and LAB triplets are always relative to it. So if you have an XYZ triplet relative to D65 white point and the same triplet relative to D50 white point, each of these represent a different color since the D65 white is a bit more bluer than D50 white. If you don't have the white point, you cannot really tell what color it is, you can only assume that it might be D65 or D50 since these two are very common and these two are also used in most of the RGB spaces. If you convert from RGB and don't perform any transformation that would change the white point (these transformations are called chromatic adaptations - like Bradford chromatic adaptation), the target reference white point will be the same as the RGB white point (in sRGB space it is D65). It's possible that the coefficients that you use for conversion already contain some chromatic adaptation that will make the output white point different than D65 from sRGB. I didn't investigate that far.\n\nI'll need to investigate this further as I didn't write the conversion code for those color spaces. Tests do seem to pass however, I do want to get all this correct. \n\nWhen you're converting from RGB triplet to XYZ/LAB triplet, the RGB channels have to be linear before conversion, otherwise the results will not be correct. It's possible that the coefficients that you use for conversion already have the transformation from normal RGB to linear RGB in them. I didn't investigate that far. To battle the issue where I don't know if an RGB color is linear or compressed, I separated those in two color spaces in my library: RGBColor and LinearRGBColor. Not sure if this is possible or good decision in ImageProcessor.\n\nThe Color struct contains two methods Compress and Expand which performs companding from sRGB to linear RGB. We are definitely performing the correct calculation in our implicit casting in regards to that. As for separation of the structures.... Well truth be told I don't know whether that would be wise or not. Thinking about it there is no reason, that I can think of, for me to not simply use linear color throughout and then use each IImageFormat to convert the color to it's respective color space on decode/encode. I'm already premultiplying any alpha that way. That would greatly reduce any overheads inherent in multiple conversion and hopefully reduce confusion for developers using the software.\nThere's a lot to think about now. I'm definitely edging towards linear throughout. I'm not so worried about conversion performance, clever use of vectors should help with that and a developer wanting to perform those type of conversions will understand the overheads involved.  \nIf you would like to get involved in the project you expertise would be most welcome!\n. Reopening this as I want to get it exactly right. I want to cater for Whitepoint etc.\n. From @manu-rv on June 30, 2016 20:29\nI wanted to understand the code base before moving to complex features. \nSince this is unassigned, I would like to take up this feature.\n. @manu-rv Awesome! Most of the code is there already but still need the additional white point work added.\n. From @Ciantic on October 26, 2016 10:59\nUmm, what does the checkmarks represent? Are they implemented already?\nI'm having a problems with a one CMYK png image which I convert to resized JPG. It seems to come out as incorrect single color image. I'm trying to come up a simple repro as I look this problem further.\n. @Ciantic The checkmarks mean I have created structs that represent each colorspace and conversion between them.\n\nI'm having a problems with a one CMYK png image which I convert to resized JPG. It seems to come out as incorrect single color image. I'm trying to come up a simple repro as I look this problem further.\n\nPng's don't support CMYK so I don't know what you mean?\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics\np.s. I'm assuming you mean using the core library yeah?\n. Hi @iamcarbon \nAdding support for P3 is a separate process from these colorspaces.\nIt would require adding the ability to read/write color profiles to jpeg which is something I'd like to support but haven't gotten around to. it. I've raised another issue #74 to cover this requirement.\nCheers\nJames. >I don't know if this is the right spot to ask this question...\nHi @SepiaGroup I suspect you know the answer to this... Not really as it's unrelated. \nJpeg's are generally not saved in RGB colorspaces but in a YCbCr representation of the sRGB colorspace. System Drawing does this as do most others. I suspect what you are actually seeing is the result of our current lack of support for ICC color profiles #74. \nIf you could add your image to that issue it would be most useful.  . Hi @tompazourek it's been a while since we chatted but...\nI'm starting to look into color conversion based on ICC profiles and it looks to me like a large portion of your Colourful.NET codebase would help me greatly in making the color management side a possibility. I wouldn't be able to simply reference your library as there are changes I would have to make and a lot of deep integration required so I wanted to make sure it was ok that I used your library as a base for my work. \nI know your license is MIT but I wanted your approval first.\nCheers\nJames. Thanks Tom, that's brilliant!\nI can do some optimization on the color classes (convert to structs, use vectors etc) so I can add some speed there and make better use of CPU caches. \nI'll give you a shout if I get stuck. \ud83d\ude04 \nCheers!\nJames. Closing this now we have the ColorspaceConverter in dev. Many, many thanks to all involved who made that possible. . From @dampee on December 21, 2015 12:57\nIf I get through my color space, I'll see what I can do for January.  Any startingpoints, hints, ... ?\n. That'd be great if you could!\nHonestly.... Not got much of a clue. I think the source for Cairo might be a place to start looking around as I think a few libraries wrap around it. I'm trying to get my head around this just now.\nhttps://github.com/mono/sysdrawing-coregraphics/blob/master/System.Drawing.Drawing2D/PathGradientBrush.cs\n. From @mweber26 on March 16, 2016 12:49\nI don't understand this issue.  What are the brushes for?  There doesn't appear to be any drawing code to use them.\n. I've expanded on the issue. We'd obviously have to create bezier classes, a draw method, etc \nI found a good primer on Beziers here. http://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/\n. From @cartman300 on May 25, 2016 0:34\nIs there any progress on this? I have quite a good idea how to implement these. Might give it a go.\n. @cartman300 None whatsoever. \nI'm not the greatest mathemagician in the world so I struggle with this kind of stuff so If you know how to do it please give it a go. I would really appreciate it!\nI'm essentially looking at first implementing path drawing. I think we should be able to break bezier and quadratic curves into neat methods and take advantage of the new vector types for things like Vector.Dot etc.  Being able to set line thickness would very useful also. \nCheers! \n. From @cartman300 on May 25, 2016 23:11\n\nI've implemented this in my fork\n. @cartman300 This is incredible! I'm super happy to see this come together. :smile: \nThe syntax is great also; really clean and pretty much exactly what I wanted. I had a quick look through the source code and I can see that you're still working on thickness. What's the status of antialiasing?\nBuzzing with this demo. I appreciate it so much!\n. From @cartman300 on May 29, 2016 0:23\nEh, i forgot antialiasing was a thing. I should definitely implement it. Maybe even some kind of serial image processor, because stuff like this can't be parallelized easily (in fact, it makes it slower). I also have to fix the b\u00e9zier paths because they don't stack easily, got no idea why yet.\n. Excellent. Thanks! \nYou can actually turn off the parallel nature of the processors by overriding the Parallelism property, setting it to 1. I do that here in Resizer\n. Hey @cartman300, Just found this excellent document on line drawing where at the end they deal with line thickness and antialiasing. We can certainly simplify the code sample by applying some of the Vector methods. I'm hoping it would be as useful to you as it looks. \nBresenham.pdf\n. From @cartman300 on June 5, 2016 23:34\nYes that's useful, but in the following weeks i'm not really sure if i'm gonna have any time to do any programming. But i'm certainly gonna have time after June ends.\nDidn't forget about this.\n. @cartman300 No worries :smile: . I've got a busy time ahead of me also with travel and other projects.\n. Hey @cartman300 Just a quick checkin. Do you reckon you would get any time soon to have a further look at this?\n. From @cartman300 on August 5, 2016 1:26\nOH yes thanks for reminding me :V I'm gonna take a look tomorrow\n. @cartman300  Sweet! That's great news!\n. From @cartman300 on August 6, 2016 6:51\nOkay i reforked the repo and restarted the work. Had kind of a hard time figuring out where to put the brush stuffs (might need refactoring later).\nAntialiasing should be a separate filter so you can choose different methods and also because i have no idea how to fill polygons with edge antialiasing with reasonable performance. \n. Yeah, we can always move it around. I'm deliberately keeping a very flat namespace for the library so feature discovery is easy. \nOnce we can get a working version we can work on improving performance so don't worry about that at this stage. I still have a lot of optimisation work to o on the project.\nJust to note, whatever solution you do plese make sure you are using the generic Image<T,TP> terminology throughout so that the methods can be reused for different pixel formats. I f you get stuck at all or spot anything daft I have done please let me know.\n. From @cartman300 on August 6, 2016 17:1\nHow would i go on about directly manipulating pixels in an Image? When i lock it, i get a generic type T for the pixels and i have no idea what to do with it.\n. Good question. The IPackedVector<TP> interface allows for conversion to and from Vector4 where the X, Y, Z, & W components represent each RGBA component in applicable packed vector implementations. \nHere's an example of me using those methds to change the alpha component of each pixel. \nhttps://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageProcessor/blob/93be57e7c664506115d8dcb098fd6f404f201332/src/ImageProcessorCore/Filters/Processors/AlphaProcessor.cs#L61\n. I'm moving this to v1.1 as it's far too big a scope of functionality to include just now. Hopefully we can all club together and get a really great API working for this.\n. Hey @cartman300 what happened to the source code from when you wrote the demo? I was going to see if I could continue your work but various methods seem to be missing.\n. From @cartman300 19th September 2016\nThe source code was very ugly and i deleted the old repository so i can re-clone the project again and reimplement it again. Got unexpectedly very busy lately so i can't guarantee anything, can give general guidelines tho.\nCurrently what's on top of my mind:\nThe easiest way would be to write a \"software renderer\" of some kind to render polygons to an image, that part can be later reused.\nAfter that you can use math to generate points on a path with variable resolution, you can change different path types by just changing the formula (just going along the line and spitting out points)\nTo give thickness to the lines, you can inflate by generating concentric circles with a variable radius (relative to each point along the line) and use math to generate convex polygons for each path segment and draw them in-order\n. From @cartman300 19th September 2016\nThis part might come in handy, isn't the most efficient but should get you started\nhttps://github.com/cartman300/Libraria/blob/master/LibrariaShared/Maths.cs#L39\n.

From @eByte23 October 7th 2016\nI'll have a play around over the weekend and see how I go. Can't promise anything but I'll take a look.\n. Hi @tocsoft \nI think shiny might be a bit of an understatement. This is simply awesome to see!\nYou're way out of my comfort zone here (A bit mathsy for me) so the only thing I will be able to offer will be optimization tips and API guidance. (On that not it might be an idea to rebase your fork from my master branch. I've been simplifying things)\nThe output looks beautiful though and the API neat and tidy and in keeping with what I have tried to do with the rest of the library. \nI know that @EvK was having a play around with this also but I haven't seen any public output there yet. There was mention in the conversations we had on Gitter about difficulty offsetting thick Bezier curves. Is this a problem you have already solved? Perhaps you could both share ideas?\nI notice you have created a couple of new types PointF and RectangleF. I've been contemplating removing Point and using Vector2 only. What would be your thoughts on that? I've found that every method I've used Point for so far has involved casting to/from Vector2 so I'm very much inclined to drop it. That looks like it would simplify your API also.\nTruly blown away by this. Thanks for making the effort to contribute \ud83d\udcaf . The only thing I've spotted so far a bit off is the direct use of Color. I'd avoid that and stick to TColor for now like BackgroundColor does. Eventually there'll probably have to be static implementations of colors for the different IPackedPixel types but I'm not in any rush to do that as each color can pack a vector or use a constructor anyway. . >I had a play with just using TColor throughout but it felt rather dirty when you wanted to instantiate brushes and pens manually instead of using extension methods, or if you wanted to retain one for use between manipulations (and don't use var).\nThat's not gonna work I'm afraid.... The different IPackedPixel<TPacked> vectors operate at different ranges when represented by a Vector4. E.g. Byte4 operates on a scale of 0 to 255, Color at 0 to 1, NormalizedShort4 at -1 to 1, and probably the weirdest Short2 which operates at -32767 to 32767 for the first component pair and 0 to 1 for the second component pair. (These are all straight from XNA and MonoGame). The ToBytes and FromBytes methods handle this scaling but we only ever want to use them in the individual image formats. \nThe way I have handled this is to make a concrete implementation of my generic types that I know I am going to have to create instances of for Color.\nImage is really Image<Color,uint> as are the non-generic PixelAccessor and PixelArea. \n\nI think I like having Point and PointF for a public API as they are more prescriptive to end users but as soon as you get into internals then I can see using Vector2 all the way.\n\nOk, let's keep them for now but I might still drop them in the future. \nDon't worry about doing all the HatchBrush styles, I think what you have done so far is more than enough, If someone desperately needs them then they probably know how to write one anyway. Let's focus on correctness and optimization of the algorithms. Regarding that maybe this is useful?\nhttp://www.angusj.com/delphi/clipper.php. Since you would be multiplying the alpha component by a value it should be ok for most cases. Some implementations simply ignore alpha anyway so there's nothing you can do about that. \nYeah, the license is an odd one but as long as we include an original copyright we should be ok. . Oh mean to say. Check out Vector4BlendTransforms.PremultipliedLerp for a nicer blending function. It automatically premultiplies the values for you when blending. You get a much nicer output.. That's a treasure trove of shiny now! The pen path stuff looks simple enough to use. Looking forward to a final PR. From @robertjf on January 13, 2016 0:53\n@JimBobSquarePants I have a little spare time at the moment and can take a look at it - have had a look through the walkthroughs etc.\nHave you started a project for this in Visual Studio yet?  If so do you want to check it in and I'll start with that, or do you want me to start from scratch?  And is your preference to use Visual Studio IDE or configure it under dnx instead?\n. Awesome! Thanks mate :+1: \nI haven't started a project yet, I planned to set a docs folder and stick a web project in there to do it all so I could preview. \n. From @priyanshu92 on May 5, 2016 15:42\n@JimBobSquarePants  I looked at it and created a sample documentation following their tutorials and I was able to create it but it doesn't seem to work on .NET Core projects :confused:  with project extension as **.xproj. I think currently it only supports .csproj files. :disappointed: \nLet me know if I can help.\n. @priyanshu92 Thanks for giving it a go, I had issues myself when I tried. Maybe I should look elsewhere for something to use. \nIdeally I want something people can make pull requests against. I just wish Jekyll wasn't such a chore on Windows machines.\n. You're on! \ud83d\ude04 That would be awesome!\nIf possible I would like to get them to build into a /docs/ folder so that I can host from github pages easily. \n. Oh! I thought that was how the netcore docs were generated?\n. YYYAAAAAAASSSSSSSSS!!!!!!\n. Aye... That's a bit mental. Github pages can be served from a /docs/ folder in the master repo so we should be able to build it in there much easier.\n. I could add an app to azure that serves any images perhaps\n. Apologies for the slow reply, birthday weekend....\nI think we should go with adding this to the main repo. There's will be no images initially since it will be purely API docs. Anything additional custom images I can serve from Azure, another github pages repo, or somewhere else, as and when required.\nIdeally I would serve the documentation from a /docs/ folder in the main repo. I will need to either preserve a CNAME file containing the domain http://imagesharp.net within that folder or  recreate it on build.\nhttps://support.dnsimple.com/articles/github-pages/#one-final-step\n. Yeah, we just need to get the docs up and running. Hoping to have that for beta1.

I have never used BenchMarkDotNet but I heard about it recently, I guess this is a good opportunity to try it!\nMaybe a new set of tests (performance) should be created for this? I think the benchmark should be done on small, medium, large and huge images (32x32, 512x512, 1024x1024, 10Kx10K ?).\nI never heard of Scientist.Net before but maybe it could be used to compare even with other similar libraries (AForge.Net, etc.) ?\nI'll do some tests with BenchMarkDotNet to see if it does the job, and report back here.\n.

From @voidstar69 on May 1, 2016 9:4\nI have tried installing BenchmarkDotNet into ImageProcessorCore.Tests via Nuget, both the official release and the prerelease. I cannot use either - the prerelease appears to need the NETStandard libraries, and the official release appears to not support DNXCore 5.0.\n@JimBobSquarePants @rold2007 Have you managed to get BenchmarkDotNet working to benchmark an existing unit test in ImageProcessorCore?\n. @voidstar69 Truth be told I've not tried, I've only used it outside for testing. I'll have a look as soon as I can. \nIt's probably best, however, to put the benchmark tests into a separate NET 4.6 console project so that I can do direct comparisons against System.Drawing.\n. @voidstar69 Just added it to the repo now :smile: \n. From @voidstar69 on May 19, 2016 21:12\n@JimBobSquarePants Thanks for adding BenchmarkDotNet to the repo, looks like it will be very useful to compare against System.Drawing.\nI have started off by looking at the performance of Crop. On my laptop the System.Drawing version take about 800us, while the Core version takes about 1380us.\nI tried a minor optimisation in Crop.cs, changing this:\nfor (int x = startX; x < endX; x++)\n{\n    target[x, y] = source[x + sourceX, y + sourceY];\n}\nto this:\nArray.Copy(source.Pixels, (((y + sourceY) * source.Width) + (startX + sourceX)) * 4,\n    target.Pixels, ((y * target.Width) + startX) * 4,\n    (endX - startX) * 4);\nThis appears to speed up the crop from 1380us to about 1330us. A small but significant improvement. You should test for a similar performance improvement on your PC, in case this is specific to my PC.\nOne downside is that the array index calculation is now exposed in Crop.cs, whereas before it was hidden away in ImageBase.this[].\nSome other things I noticed:\n- If the target rectangle (top-left) x and y are non-zero, I believe the crop will be incorrect because the source coordinates are offset by this target x and y.\n- ImageBase pins the memory of pixelArray, but never calls GCHandle.Free to unpin this memory. Additionally keeping lots of memory blocks pinned for long periods will degrade the garbage collector. As long as ImageBase objects are constructed and then disposed not long later, this probably is not a problem. The alternative would be to pin this memory on-demand, and unpin it at a convenient time, i.e. at the end of each image operation.\n. Hi @voidstar69 Thanks for having a look at this. Have you go the latest version of the codebase?\nI have a test against Crop here which resulted in Crop taking half the time of System.Drawing on my machine. Admittedly results will vary depending on how many cores you have (Also make sure you are running in release mode?) \n\nIf the target rectangle (top-left) x and y are non-zero, I believe the crop will be incorrect because the source coordinates are offset by this target x and y.\n\nI'll need to add a unit test to double check against the target. The current code was submitted as a bug fix. \n\nImageBase pins the memory of pixelArray, but never calls GCHandle.Free to unpin this memory. \n\nI do call GCHandle.Free() I think you must have just missed it. Image now implements IDisposable and the method is called when disposing of the instance. \nWhat I do need to know is whether I should be checking and calling Free() when using SetPixels() or whether simply updating the handle is sufficient. \n. From @mattwarren on May 20, 2016 8:53\nHi, I'm one of the developers for BenchmarkDotNet and it's cool to see you using it, I added you to our list.\nBTW there's a Diagnostics Nuget package that might be help you out. It gives you information about memory allocations and method inlining that might be useful to have in your benchmarks\n. Hi @mattwarren thanks for dropping by. \nThat package sounds like it would definitely be very useful thank you! Happy to have made your list. :smile:\n. From @voidstar69 on May 21, 2016 18:17\nHi @JimBobSquarePants, I got the latest code from the Core branch before I tried my changes, and I did test them in Release mode.\nThat is the same test that I ran on my machine, but the performance profile is different for me (i5 CPU, 4 logical processors). What were your timings in us (microseconds)? If you try out my Array.Copy code, does it make Crop faster or slower on your machine?\nYou are right about GCHandle.Free - I was searching the file for this exact text, rather than pixelHandles.Free.\nAs for SetPixels() I suspect that if Free() is not called before calling GCHandle.Alloc() again, the previous memory block will remain pinned in memory. So Free() should be called if pixelsHandle is not null.\n. @voidstar69 I've taken your advise on board re SetPixels() as that seems like a logical interpretation of expected behaviour. The code will be in the next push. \nAs for timings. Here's the timing on my main laptop. It's got waaay less cores than my work machine which has twelve. On that machine ImageProcessorCore is 0.46 when scaled which is good and quick.\n```\nBenchmarkDotNet=v0.9.6.0\nOS=Microsoft Windows NT 6.2.9200.0\nProcessor=Intel(R) Processor 5Y70 CPU @ 1.10GHz, ProcessorCount=4\nFrequency=1266597 ticks, Resolution=789.5171 ns, Timer=TSC\nHostCLR=MS.NET 4.0.30319.42000, Arch=64-bit RELEASE [RyuJIT]\nJitModules=clrjit-v4.6.1080.0\nType=Crop  Mode=Throughput\n              Method |    Median |    StdDev | Scaled |\n\n------------------------ |---------- |---------- |------- |\n     System.Drawing Crop | 1.0361 ms | 0.1025 ms |   1.00 |\n ImageProcessorCore Crop | 1.7126 ms | 0.0806 ms |   1.65 |\n```\nUsing your code addition\n```\nBenchmarkDotNet=v0.9.6.0\nOS=Microsoft Windows NT 6.2.9200.0\nProcessor=Intel(R) Processor 5Y70 CPU @ 1.10GHz, ProcessorCount=4\nFrequency=1266597 ticks, Resolution=789.5171 ns, Timer=TSC\nHostCLR=MS.NET 4.0.30319.42000, Arch=64-bit RELEASE [RyuJIT]\nJitModules=clrjit-v4.6.1080.0\nType=Crop  Mode=Throughput\n              Method |        Median |     StdDev | Scaled |\n\n------------------------ |-------------- |----------- |------- |\n     System.Drawing Crop |   847.2536 us | 26.1538 us |   1.00 |\n ImageProcessorCore Crop | 1,397.4700 us | 59.5903 us |   1.65 |\n```\nI ran the tests a few times and the difference was negligible so I don't want to change the code yet (big emphasis on the yet)\nYou have got me thinking though which is awesome. IImageBase should have a method to set a row in one move. There must be a way we can copy an entire row in one in an unsafe context to maximize performance. So if you, I or anyone reading wants to set aside the time to tests and benchmark an approach that would be excellent. \n. One thing that we should definitely have a look at which affects all processes is how I manage threading.\nin ParallelImageProcessor.cs I split up jobs into tasks\nhttps://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageProcessor/blob/0300f596b0c59a7187ba7ce0efcf0d9e98932a4f/src/ImageProcessorCore/ParallelImageProcessor.cs#L45\nI determine the number of tasks based on multiplying the processor count by 2 which I will freely admit was a number plucked out from the air.\nI would love to have someone review this process to see if I am falling short somewhere and taking the wrong approach. \n. Well ain't this nice... :smile: \n```\n// * Summary *\nBenchmarkDotNet=v0.9.7.0\nOS=Microsoft Windows NT 6.2.9200.0\nProcessor=Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-1650 0 3.20GHz, ProcessorCount=12\nFrequency=3117489 ticks, Resolution=320.7710 ns, Timer=TSC\nHostCLR=MS.NET 4.0.30319.42000, Arch=64-bit RELEASE [RyuJIT]\nJitModules=clrjit-v4.6.1063.1\nType=Resize  Mode=Throughput\n                Method |    Median |    StdDev | Scaled |\n\n-------------------------- |---------- |---------- |------- |\n     System.Drawing Resize | 2.6414 ms | 0.0395 ms |   1.00 |\n ImageProcessorCore Resize | 1.7930 ms | 0.0773 ms |   0.68 |\n// * BenchmarkRunner: End ***\nGlobal total time: 00:00:30 (30.42 sec)\n```\n.

Hi @danijel-peric \nThanks for your info but you're actually benchmarking the wrong codebase. This issue has been raised specifically for ImageProcessor.Core.\nThere's going to be some overhead using the legacy ImageFactory code as I copy the image over to a new pixel format when loading. If you were going to benchmark you should be benchmarking the Resize method only. There is absolutely no parallel code used in the example workflow you have provided. \n. From @rold2007 on July 3, 2016 1:0\n@danijel-peric : Also, make sure you compare apples with apples. Resize methods like nearest neighbor and bicubic have a very different speed, and quality. But I'm not even sure what ImageProcessor is using.\n. From @danijel-peric on July 3, 2016 7:25\n:), it looks i have tested with old ImageFactory which was on https://www.nuget.org/packages/ImageProcessor\nsorry, will do another test with ImageProcessor.Core, so in order to get it i need to download source? and build it, do you have binary files somewhere for download? \n. Yeah, they're on MyGet, you can see it in the readme. There's benchmark tests in the source though. \n. From @mattwarren on July 7, 2016 16:59\n@JimBobSquarePants I'm sorry I never replied to your previous comment.\nYes if you could open an issue that would be great, otherwise I'll forget about this problem!!\nAlso if you can point me so a (simple) test project that repos the issue that would also be helpful.\n. From @Grebe-M on July 7, 2016 20:42\nI did some tests regarding the crop function and it really shows that the benchmarks should test for different image sizes:\nI ran three crop variations:\n1 - The current implementation\n2 - The slightly modified version with Array.Copy\n```\nParallel.For(\n    startY,\n    endY,\n    y =>\n{\n     Array.Copy(\n        source.Pixels,\n        (((y + sourceY)source.Width) + (startX + sourceX))4,\n        target.Pixels, ((ytarget.Width) + startX)4,\n        (endX - startX)*4);\nthis.OnRowProcessed();\n\n});\n```\n3 - The slightly modified version with Array.Copy but single threaded\n```\nfor (int y = startY; y < endY; y++)\n{\n     Array.Copy(\n        source.Pixels,\n        (((y + sourceY)source.Width) + (startX + sourceX))4,\n        target.Pixels, ((ytarget.Width) + startX)4,\n        (endX - startX)*4);\nthis.OnRowProcessed();\n\n}\n```\nThe results were as follows:\nBenchmarkDotNet=v0.9.7.0\nOS=Microsoft Windows NT 6.1.7601 Service Pack 1\nProcessor=Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E3-1231 v3 3.40GHz, ProcessorCount=8\nFrequency=3320332 ticks, Resolution=301.1747 ns, Timer=TSC\nHostCLR=MS.NET 4.0.30319.42000, Arch=64-bit RELEASE [RyuJIT]\nJitModules=clrjit-v4.6.1076.0\nType=Crop  Mode=Throughput  \nImage size: 400x400, Crop size: 100x100\n1.\n| Method | Median | StdDev | Scaled |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| System.Drawing Crop | 381.9870 us | 1.3519 us | 1.00 |\n| ImageProcessorCore Crop | 672.7337 us | 23.0420 us | 1.76 |\n2.\n| Method | Median | StdDev | Scaled |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| System.Drawing Crop | 383.0861 us | 1.7525 us | 1.00 |\n| ImageProcessorCore Crop | 626.6772 us | 12.6071 us | 1.64 |\n3.\n| Method | Median | StdDev | Scaled |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| System.Drawing Crop | 384.2923 us | 2.4667 us | 1.00 |\n| ImageProcessorCore Crop | 580.5539 us | 18.4702 us | 1.51 |\nAnd with larger images:\nImage size: 4000x4000, Crop size: 1000x1000\n1.\n| Method | Median | StdDev | Scaled |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| System.Drawing Crop | 36.4692 ms | 0.1921 ms | 1.00 |\n| ImageProcessorCore Crop | 12.4009 ms | 0.1998 ms | 0.34 |\n2.\n| Method | Median | StdDev | Scaled |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| System.Drawing Crop | 36.4490 ms | 0.1024 ms | 1.00 |\n| ImageProcessorCore Crop | 12.1453 ms | 0.1576 ms | 0.33 |\n3.\n| Method | Median | StdDev | Scaled |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| System.Drawing Crop | 37.0588 ms | 0.3184 ms | 1.00 |\n| ImageProcessorCore Crop | 15.0092 ms | 0.1711 ms | 0.41 |\n. @Grebe-M That's some really interesting stats! Thanks for taking the time to produce them. Very cool to see the advantage we have on larger images.\nThe benchmarking needs a lot of work but I'm going to need help putting it all together. If you or anyone else can devote the time to help me do so that would be very much appreciated. It would give me the confidence to push the project further out of alpha status.\n. @mattwarren Thanks, I'll see if I can rustle something simple up over the next few days to repeat my issue. \n. From @mattwarren on July 8, 2016 8:55\n@Grebe-M I don't if you are aware of not, but BenchmarkDotNet supports parameterised benchmarks that might help you here. It works on fields and properties e.g.\n``` csharp\npublic class IntroParams\n{\n    [Params(100, 200)]\n    public int A { get; set; }\n[Params(10, 20)]\npublic int B { get; set; }\n\n[Benchmark]\npublic void Benchmark()\n{\n    Thread.Sleep(A + B + 5);\n}\n\n}\n```\nProduces the following results:\n| Method | Median | StdDev | A | B |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Benchmark | 115.3325 ms | 0.0242 ms | 100 | 10 |\n| Benchmark | 125.3282 ms | 0.0245 ms | 100 | 20 |\n| Benchmark | 215.3024 ms | 0.0375 ms | 200 | 10 |\n| Benchmark | 225.2710 ms | 0.0434 ms | 200 | 20 |\n. From @Grebe-M on July 8, 2016 10:8\n@mattwarren I was not aware, but because every possible combination gets tested seperately it's not the best solution in this particular case. I'd like to have parameter pairs that get used. For example I'd like to define something like this:\n```\npublic class Crop\n{\n    private class CropBenchParameters\n    {\n        public int Width { get; set; }\n        public int Height { get; set; }\n        public int CropWidth { get; set; }\n        public int CropHeigth { get; set; }\n    }\nprivate List<CropBenchParameters> parameters = new List<CropBenchParameters>\n{\n    new CropBenchParameters\n    {\n        Width = 96,\n        Height = 96,\n        CropWidth = 32,\n        CropHeigth = 32\n    },\n    new CropBenchParameters\n    {\n        Width = 1920,\n        Height = 1080,\n        CropWidth = 1280,\n        CropHeigth = 1024\n    },\n    new CropBenchParameters\n    {\n        Width = 4096,\n        Height = 4096,\n        CropWidth = 4077,\n        CropHeigth = 4029\n    }\n};\n\n}\n```\nAnd then loop through the list and every loop is a seperate benchmark. Is something like this possible with BenchmarkDotNet?\n. From @Romanx on July 11, 2016 10:10\n@Grebe-M It's not possible as I tried it however making a parameter of an Index in an array and passing that into your test method and looking up your params works. \nThere is obviously the overhead of lookup on the array during your benchmarks so if you're doing sensitive perf testing it may not be useful though.\n. From @mattwarren on July 11, 2016 12:32\nAnother trick you can use is to setup \"modes\" of you benchmark as Enum values and then in a [Setup] method create the relevant Width, Height, etc for that mode. This way you don't pay any extra code in the [Benchmark] method itself.\nSee the modes in https://gist.github.com/mattwarren/8190ab7e4b139764d686d9bb279711b2 as an example.\n. From @Romanx 12th July 2016\n@mattwarren That's really useful. Thanks!\n. I was asked about this issue so I thought I'd comment here with some updates on progress made and where I'd like to focus on.\nSince I opened the thread we've:\nReduced the amount of memory used per image by 75% by adopting a generic API and using bytes per color component by default.\nReduced operational memory by half for filters by operating on the input image without copying.\nSped up pixel access by almost 50% by using Unsafe\nReduced the number of allocations in Resize by removing private variables\nThere's probably more but I can't think what they are off the top of my head.\nAreas I'd really like to focus on.\nEncoders/Decoders. I've done barely any optimisation work there at all. I'm fairly sure a lot of the code could be rewritten to use pointers. I'd also like to utilize the Big/Little Endian writers more and optimise within there. I've a feeling that there is now classes for writing pointers to streams which we could use within them.\nI'm utterly convinced I could use SIMD a lot more also. Within the encoders and within my individual algorithms. I'm not that sharp with them though and docs are sparse so don't really know where to start.\n. From @NeelBhatt 14th July 2016\nI like this package and have wrote basic blog for decoding of JPEG using this. which is here:\nhttps://neelbhatt40.wordpress.com/2016/09/14/jpeg-decoder-for-net-core/\nThanks for the Nuget package.\n. Hi @NeelBhatt Thanks for the publicity! \ud83d\ude04\nI'd just like to suggest some updates to your blog if that's ok to correct a few details.\nJust to clarify. The ImageProcessor version (2.4.4) published in Nuget is the legacy version that runs on the full .NET Framework. That version is in a separate branch in this repo called Framework.\nWhat you are looking for to work on .NET Standard 1.1 + is the ImageProcessorCore package which is only on MyGet for the time being. That is hosted here. https://www.myget.org/gallery/imageprocessor\nI hope that clears things up a little.\nCheers\nJames\n. From @NeelBhatt 14th July 2016\nOh okay so you mean for .Net core, we need to download it from the link you mentioned in your comment correct? Also can it be downloaded from your Github repository?\nI will surely change that. Thanks :)\n. Just to note. Focus is now on Encoders/Decoders. Bmp is great! The rest.... \n. Hey @antonfirsov That's great! Which classes in particular were you looking at? Please say the Jpeg decoder/encoder...\nI would \u2764\ufe0f if you could have a look at that if you could? I'm focusing on png just now. \n. Excellent stuff! I got memory usage down on the encoder but the decoder is a mess!\n. @antonfirsov That's still progress so don't lose heart yet. I have a big book on the jpeg spec at home and am investigating the different implementations. Already forked libjpeg-turbo \ud83d\ude04 \nTranslating to the floating point version shouldn't be beyond us. There's a faster, slightly less accurate version here also https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/blob/master/jidctflt.c \nFluxJpeg has implementations we can adapt that i'd like to investigate also. \nhttps://github.com/briandonahue/FluxJpeg.Core/blob/master/FJCore/FDCT.cs\nhttps://github.com/briandonahue/FluxJpeg.Core/blob/master/FJCore/DCT.cs\nIntrigued by their inverse... It seems very simplistic.\n. It's libjpeg.net. You don't wanna see the source, its brutal and super slow. \n. Could you PR with what you have please and I'll have a tinker from there. \n. @boguscoder Thanks!\n. Awwwwwww yeaaaaaaaaah!\nThat's a brilliant improvement! \nDefinitely looking to pull the changes in though I'll need you to strip your PR down to the minimum changes please first. You've got 28 files changed so far, some of which are completely unrelated (png filters)\n. Closing this as we have come a long way performance wise and it does no good to keep this issue open.. Hi @Bartmax \nIt means exactly that. Png files can be interlaced but it is strongly recommended not to do that as it hurts compression, increasing filesize. \nSee \n- http://stackoverflow.com/a/14124340/427899\n- http://blog.codinghorror.com/getting-the-most-out-of-png/ \nInterlaced png files are generally uncommon so I haven't gone out of my way to support them cos it's complex. I could maybe add support in the future though as there is good reference material to base my code on so if you could share a failing image that would be really useful.\n. From @Bartmax on May 6, 2016 4:39\nThanks for the fast reply.\nHere is a sample file that is failing. I have 3 out of 10 that seems to be interlaced :(\n\n. No worries. I'll branch off and try to tinker with it. Fingers crossed it's not too difficult.\n. This is tricky stuff...\nI've been looking at the spec and also the Golang implementation.\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/\nhttps://golang.org/src/image/png/reader.go\nReading up it looks like I need to decode each scanline 8 times which will require some significant refactoring here. \nhttps://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageProcessor/blob/7d28a87716e4b7c2dea73bc0fb804873d30372f6/src/ImageProcessorCore/Formats/Png/PngDecoderCore.cs#L242\nI could really do with someone who has done this before stepping up and adding the code.\n. From @MarcosMeli on August 29, 2016 16:28\n@JimBobSquarePants \nJust a little question here. There is an option to use the .Net native image load implementation and convert the resulting Bitmap to the format you need ?\nie. try to use custom decode for the pngs but, if interlaced, so use Bitmap constructor: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/z7ha67kw(v=vs.110).aspx\nThanks\n. From @dlemstra on August 29, 2016 16:59\nThe library should build on .NET Core where we don't have the Image class of System.Drawing. Adding it to the encoder should be the way to go.\n. From @MarcosMeli on August 29, 2016 17:50\n@dlemstra Thanks for clarification, I understand now.\n. Had a crack at this and I'm so close. I'm reading the stream fine without error but something isn't right after. It looks like my offset calculation is wrong. Could someone have a look?\n\n. Ok @Bartmax so I'm almost there with this. \nI can decode your rgb image perfectly now and my rgba image also. I have one test image though (rgb 8x8) that is showing a two pixel error and I don't know why. If anyone reading could have a look that would be great.\nHere's your image decoded then encoded in non-interlaced mode.\n\n . Thanks for highlighting the failing tests, not sure how that slipped through but they are unrelated. I've fixed them in my branch.\nI managed to fix the decoder! Turns out I wasn't clearing an array at the correct time. . Don't worry, you were useful \ud83d\udc4d \nI've merged my branch and you should see a shiny new working build now. . From @dlemstra on August 18, 2016 21:30\nThe EXIF won't be parsed until you try to get information from it. When the decoder reads the EXIF data it just reads a bunch of bytes and stores them in an array. The encoder will then just copy those bytes in the output image. I don't think this will have a noticeable effect on your performance.\n@JimBobSquarePants Might be good to still have an option disable reading/writing metadata in the encoder/decoder though.\np.s. Waar gebruik je dit?\n. Yeah, we could do that as an overload I'm sure and pass the option through to the decoder. \n. From @KLuuKer on August 19, 2016 7:46\n@dlemstra our company makes a saas webshop and end users don't need to see EXIF data (if it exists in the first place). It also makes the file bigger if it's included, and with allot of users hitting the site it saves a ton of bandwidth (for all parties involved moving that data around).\np.s. h\u00e9 kijk een nederlander :)\n. From @dlemstra on August 19, 2016 8:10\nIf optimization of file size is an issue then you might also want to take a look at a feature that exists in my library (Magick.NET). It will require an extra dependency but it works on .NET Core on Windows. If you need to have it work on an other platform you will need to wait a while.\nMy library has a class that can be used to compress the size of a JPEG/PNG/GIF without loss of quality. I have created a tiny example for the lossless compression here: https://magick.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Lossless%20compression&referringTitle=Documentation\n. From @KLuuKer on August 19, 2016 8:28\nUnfortunately i have to run on linux and windows so that's not a option.\nI am also not a fan of using native dll's for security reasons.\n. From @dlemstra on August 19, 2016 8:42\nI think we will make this 'NoExif' option an extra option that you can pass to the SaveAsFormat() methods. And we will also need to add an option for when an image is read. Maybe we could also add LoadAsJpeg @JimBobSquarePants ?\n. From @KLuuKer on August 19, 2016 9:8\nMaybe name it 'NoMetadata' (as its a more generic term), for when there will be supported for WebM\\WebP and to skip loading of RIFF data\n. From @dlemstra on August 19, 2016 9:16\nThe quotes were added to try to clarify that my name was just a suggestion :smile: . I personally think IgnoreMetadata is a better name and yes it should be used by multiple coders. Planning to work on ImageMagick this weekend so you will need to wait a bit before this will be added.\np.s. You could help us out and send us a pull request :smiley_cat: We can continue this conversation on gitter if you need more info.\n. From @akusmin on September 15, 2016 9:19\n@KLuuKer , there is workaround. Just set image ExifProfile to null.\nRegards\n. From @kierenj on September 7, 2016 20:27\nI realise how unhelpful this comment right here is, but TIFF decoding across the board can be really tricky to get right - there are loads of compression formats, and even fairly respected tools (from MS / Atalasoft) get it wrong even with 1-bit images.  I think some archiving formats even require special licensing to implement correctly.  It might be worth identifying a small subset of formats to support!\n. @kierenj It's certainly not an unhelpful comment. Tiff would be hard and I'm sorely tempted to let someone else figure it out and concentrate on what we have already. I'm just dreading the day someone tells me that the library is useless without it. There's always someone!\n. @chrisvandijk Good effort but have you benchmarked that codec? The Bitmiracle jpeg codec was about 10x slower and used 190MB more to process a small test image compared to our codec. I imagine the Tiff one will be the same. I'd be careful using it. \n@Andy-Wilkinson you have been playing around with Tiff haven't you with your own stuff? I wonder if we can use some of it?. @chrisvandijk understandable. Tiff is a complex format so I'm pushing it to the backburner until I can get everything else out of the way... Not looking forward to tackling it!. @antonfirsov I've found with those ports though there's about a million lines more code than I'd like to read nested in there.\n@Andy-Wilkinson That would be absolutely brilliant if you could! \ud83d\udcaf . @sandorfr We've already got a WIP TIFF PR in progress #119 \nThe BitMiracle repositories, to put it nicely, are junk. Poorly ported, slow, bloated implementations that are useful only for testing against.. There's been a lot of changes in the main repo since the PR was opened. We'll have to do a lot of work to update the codebase before support can be completed.. Yep, we have a Tiff branch with a lot of code written already. Post v1 we will work to complete it. . No idea. I'm going to need waaaaay more information than that. \n. From @Bartmax on September 6, 2016 1:19\nWhat kind of information?\nThis happens on azure standard-size machine. It doesn't on local machine, and I can repro if I choose to resize ~7 images of about ~20mb each to a resolution of 600px width (keeping aspect) that ends in about ~45kb. (just an example). Almost any time-consuming resize process returns that error.\nThe resize does happen and after that (since I cache the resized images) the site works with no prob.\nIt looks like a timeout of some sorts.\n. Are those images 20MB each compressed or do you mean in memory?\nHow long are they individually taking?\nIf the resize is actually taking place then you might be on track. It sounds like there is some sort of response timeout taking place which would be in the realms of the ASP team to instruct you on working around. It can't be an imageprocessor specific issue since no exceptions are thrown by the library and we are successfully encoding.\nI haven't actually used ASP.NET Core yet so I'm not going to be much help I'm afraid.\n. From @Bartmax on September 6, 2016 12:49\n@JimBobSquarePants 20mb compressed.\nEach image takes a considerable amount of time. don't know exactly how much\nI will try to investigate a little further and then cross reference to the aspnet team.\nI'll let you know if I discover something.\n. Thanks!\n. Hey @Bartmax have you seen this come up again recently? We've been doing some serious memory and performance optimisation in the repo. \n. Thanks. Is this with the latest codebase? I can't think why it would be us but I'd like to be sure. \n. Ah excellent work recreating the issue without the library! I think we should close this here then really since it's not specific to ImageSharp. . From @dlemstra on September 7, 2016 8:59\n@JimBobSquarePants We call this Compose in ImageMagick. Maybe we should add a Compose Sampler? I can add this.\n. There's no 2D drawing in ImageProcessor yet.....\n I have an open ticket #264 that would cover paths etc but that still has work to do. Whatever we make I want it to be feature rich, easy to use and powerful. The architecture would be difference from the standard samplers. \n. From @dlemstra on September 7, 2016 9:30\nThis is not drawing text/paths. Its drawing one image on top of another image. In other words copy pixels from the source image to the destination image. I would prefer to do this in a Compose sampler so we could add features like only copying one channel.\n. @dlemstra I'd actually like to have a look at splitting channels. The blend processor can merge based on lerping but that's all or nothing. \n. From @Emyr42 on September 13, 2016 17:11\nusing (Graphics g = Graphics.FromImage(_resultImage)) {  g.DrawImage(_otherImage, x, y); }\nCreate an ImageFactory using a Stream (wherever you got _otherImage, or save _otherImage to a MemoryStream)...\n_otherImageFactory.Overlay(\n    new ImageLayer\n    {\n        Image = _resultImage,\n        Position = new System.Drawing.Point(x, y)\n    }\n);\nMaybe Overlay needs more parameters?\n. THATS NOT CORE \n. From @Emyr42 on September 13, 2016 21:34\nNo need to shout. Other projects make it a little more obvious by having distinct repositories.\n. From @Emyr42 on September 13, 2016 22:32\n```\n        using (FileStream streamFoo = File.OpenRead(@\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\\Common7\\IDE\\ProjectTemplates\\Extensibility\\1033\\VSShellTemplate\\VSShellStubExe\\Documentation\\Images\\AppEnv.jpg\"))\n        using (FileStream streamBar = File.OpenRead(@\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\\Common7\\IDE\\Extensions\\InstallShield\\InstallShieldProject\\1033\\IS-text-200wide.jpg\"))\n        using (FileStream output = File.OpenWrite(@\"C:\\Users\\aam00\\Desktop\\foobar2.jpg\"))\n        {\n            Image imageFoo = new Image(streamFoo);\n            Image imageBar = new Image(streamBar);\n        imageFoo.Blend(imageBar, 100);\n\n        imageFoo.Save(output);\n    }\n\n```\nThis works, overlaying at (0,0).\n\nThis fails silently if the file already exists. Setting the stream length to 0 doesn't truncate it.\nI also tried positioning the overlay:\nimageFoo.Blend(imageBar, 100, new Rectangle(50, 30, imageBar.Width, imageBar.Height));\nThe Rectangle parameter doesn't behave as expected. Rather than being sizing for the positioned image, the width and height seem to crop the overlay relative to (0,0).\n\n. Sorry, didn't mean to. Was on my phone. Will have a proper look when I get to a desktop. \n. @Emyr42 You're absolutely correct. We need another parameter, most likely a rectangle, the first rectangle signifies the area of interest of the image to blend.  The second would represent to location to drop the image. \nMy thought would be that if the second rectangle dimensions do not match that of the source image we would scale it. \nWhat do you think?\n. Oh @Emyr42 meant to ask, \n\nThis fails silently if the file already exists. Setting the stream length to 0 doesn't truncate it.\n\nWhat do you mean by this?\n. Blend now supports setting the position and the size of the overlaid image. Composition is also premultiplied for better blending (I think I got the maths correct for that).\n\n. From @christopherbauer on 12th January 2016\nHey Jim, I was eyeing for something like this, but my initial thought seemed like this might be too simple. I don't have internet atm but the pseudo code I came up with was:\ncsharp\npublic Color multiply (Color destination) {\n    if(destination == Black)\n        return Black;\n    if(destination == White)\n         return this;\n    return new Color(this.R * destination.R, this.G * destination.G, this.B * destination.B);\n}\nI'm going to need to do a bit more work to get backdrop alpha correct per: \nCr = (1 - \u03b1b) x Cs + \u03b1b x B(Cb, Cs)\nCr: the result color\nB: the formula that does the blending\nCs: the source color\nCb: the backdrop color\n\u03b1b: the backdrop alpha\nAnd I am missing clamping here, but it seems to conform to the multiply section of the w3 blending spec. Could it be so simple? If so when I get home I'll start right on it with tests happily.\n. Hi Christopher,\nThe only complexity involved that I see is that the color component values in the Color class are premultiplied. I'm not sure what issues that would cause with the formulas given.\nI think we should move Lerp, Multiply and any other transforms into a new ColorTransforms.cspartial struct just to make it easier to see what is going on.\nOnce we have factored alpha into equations we can look at utilizing the backing vectors in the calculations also.\n. From @christopherbauer 13th January 2016\nYes I'm sure you've found this already, but if anyone else also takes a look a good link for some reading is https://developer.nvidia.com/content/alpha-blending-pre-or-not-pre.\nI'll look more into better tests for this branch and doing the work without multiplication via some of the library functions. I'll validate against the examples from the links as well.\n. Yeah chum, read that, then promptly forgot about it. I'd like to double check Lerp against it, I was having issues when mixing alpha and non alpha colors.\n. From @christopherbauer 13th January 2016\nI've been reading up on the premultiplied thing, it seems pretty random really, with whether or not something is actually premultiplied being up to whether or not the application that created the file following the spec for the file type. Like pngs are supposed to be non-premultiplied by default. Do we have a way of detecting this or a way of guaranteeing we have the type we're expecting?\n. I premultiply the values when I read from pngs then translate back when I'm saving.\nhttps://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageProcessor/blob/V3/src/ImageProcessor/Formats/Png/TrueColorReader.cs#L53\nWhether I should be doing this by default... Who know's. I could do with some advice from someone who knows more than I do.\n. From @christopherbauer 16th January 2016\nYeah I am going to start on trying to determine how to do this \"the right way\". Using the example from https://developer.nvidia.com/content/alpha-blending-pre-or-not-pre I'll be trying to determine how to get the multiply blending to return a \"greenish red\" instead of (what I expect will be) the \"drab green\" in the implementation we merged today. I'll also shift Lerp to the new partial later. After that I can start attacking the other blend modes.\nI've also cleaned the comments up in this issue so that if anyone else wants to grab one of the blend modes they don't have to read our back-and-forth. Hope you don't mind.\n. From @Quintinon 29th January 2016\nI'm looking into helping some with this as I've been wanting to get (back) into OSS. Most of these seem straight forward to implement. I'm interested in attempting to do some performance improvements later as those are always \"fun\". I've got some ideas on performance that might help but I need to learn the code base first, so for now I'll start work on the screen blend.\n. From @Quintinon 29th January 2016\nI just noticed this was assigned to someone, if I should be working on a different item let me know, I won't be able to start working on it until this weekend anyways.\n. Hi @Quintinon, Love that you want to get involved! @christopherbauer do you want to work together on this?\nWould love to see what you could add performance wise also!\n. From @christopherbauer 14th February 2016\nOh gosh I'm sorry I started a new job and have had no time to even think on this (actually work I've done for ImageProcessor is really making me an all-star over there! :)). I'd love for @Quintinon to take on some of the work here if they are still interested, and if you've already started on screen mode blending give us a heads up! \ud83d\udc4d\n. From @christopherbauer 21st April 2016\nHo @JimBobSquarePants. I've been quite lax in my open source contributions because of the new job. I want to get started on the things we discussed in issue #329, are you still okay with what we discussed back in Feb or is there something more pressing I can look into?\n. Hi @christopherbauer that's no problem. Work always takes first priority. \nYeah, I'm happy for you to continue with that. On that note though, I want to write it all in a way that assumes all colors are premultiplied as that's how the class is intended to be used. If a developer ignores what I will be putting in the documentation then that will be their issue \ud83d\ude1c \n. From @voidstar69 11th August 2016\nIs anyone working on adding the remaining blending modes? If not, I would like to work on adding them.\n. @voidstar69 if @christopherbauer is happy for you to take over that then definitely go for it. All the original complexity is now gone as Color is now no longer premultiplied. It should be a case of simply plugging through them as per the described formulae.\n. From @CVertex  16th August 2016\nHey dudes,\nYears and years ago (when I was in uni) I wrote a multiply/add/exclude blend modes for a project. I remember being using some bitwise tricks for doing fast multiply to save on ops.\nI did some googling yesterday and found better techniques employed in https://github.com/teichgraf/WriteableBitmapEx/blob/master/Source/WriteableBitmapEx/WriteableBitmapBlitExtensions.cs\nMaybe worth using for inspiration? (when u start optimizing of course)\nCheers\n. @CVertex Man! Code like that hurts my eyes! I much prefer hiding everything behind my PixelAcessor!\nWhich reminds me, I need to optimise that to return a whole column or row.\nThanks for the link though, useful!\n. From @CVertex 19th August 2016\nWhat's the status of this? Blend modes are fun, I might help if you're not finished.. \nIf you can layout a rough structure and pattern, it'll make it easier.\nFrom what I can see, I'd make blend modes part of the Overlay op, but maybe we want it in more places?\n. Dunno what the progress is just now. \nI think we should actually implement them as extension methods for Vector4 that way we can use them for all IPackedVector types. After we can add some syntactic sugar by wrapping the methods in the Color struct.\ne.g. \n```\nVector4 Lighten(Vector4 first Vector4 second) {\n    // Do your thang...\n}\nColor Lighten(Color source Color background) {\n    return new Color(Vector4.Lighten(source.ToVector4(), background.ToVector4());\n}\n```\n. From @CVertex 21st August 2016\n@JimBobSquarePants Okay cool.\nDefining these ops at a pixel level will work for multiply and many of the separable operations should be fine. However, you could miss some perf opportunities by not running these on regions or whole images.\nFor region based operations, like saturation and blend, how do you want those to be structured?\nI think you can run these in multiple passes if you want to leverage ParallelFx. Prob need to do some more reading.\nThoughts?\n. @CVertex To be honest, I'm not sure. I've struggled with the granularity requirements of the API at several points.\nMy gut feeling is to define at pixel level and then look for opportunities to enhance performance when they occur. Most operations internally are by pixel anyway and to allow the possibility of manipulation outside of the current processor architecture would always be a bonus.\n. From @CVertex 22nd August 2016\n@JimBobSquarePants I hear ya dude..\nLet's start with the pixel level ops and see how that feels for accomplishing some things..\n. Hi @codegateau  thanks for your PR but I'm not sure what you are trying to achieve here?\nI already have a working jpeg implementation within the master branch. It's extremely rough around the edges being a port from the Golang implementation but I plan to improve upon that given time.\nCould you explain further?\nCheers\nJames\n. From @dlemstra on October 31, 2016 13:7\nCan you add a link to the original jpg file? Github changed it into a PNG file. Is this the correct link: https://yooocanlive.azureedge.net/images/98bc0f36fcc4444e9889e152aa4ceb5d?\nAnd can you move your issue to the new repo: https://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp? The Core branch has been renamed.\n. From @gdoron on October 31, 2016 13:14\n@dlemstra \nTry this one:\nhttp://yooocan.com/images/temp/bad%20image.jpeg\n(For future readers, this image will be deleted, I had to upload it to our server)\nThanks!\n. From @gdoron on October 31, 2016 13:19\nBTW, in case you delete go to the link and read the story,\nThis is a Halloween costume a father made for his disabled I hate this word kid.\nThey \"dressed\" the wheelchair in a Ghostbusters car costume. AMAZING STUFF!.\n. @gdoron Great story, really heart-warming! \ud83d\ude04 \nI'm going to move this issue over to the correct repo as I have moved everything. We can continue the discussion there. \n. Ok, @gdoron,\nI used jpegsnoop to analyse the image and it is technically corrupt as it's missing an EOI (End Of Image) marker. \nTheoretically it would still be possible to decode the image (Windows can) by calculating the number of expected MCU's (Minimum Coded Unit) if we are able to read the height and the width from the image header and stopping decoding once we have reached that value. Typically those are 8x8 units but can also be 16x8 or 16x16 depending on the subsampling. \nMore info on MCU's can be found here\nIt's not going to be easy to fix but I'll give it my best shot. \n. @gdoron Whatever originally encoded the image probably has a bug. Or maybe even something has happened during file copy in some instance. It happens often enough.\n. Yeah that's nasty!\nWe should have an MCU count in the decoder, working out whether to throw should be a case of checking against that count. If you could have a look that would be awesome. I would suggest looking at the source code for JpegSnoop on GitHub, that can detect missing EOI markers, warn and successfully decode them.. No worries, thanks for trying. It's on my list of thinks to work through so will get it done eventually.. Ah excellent! \ud83d\udc4d   @mellinoe  This is a good start, I wasn't looking forward to doing this.\nThere's a couple of other files that will require updating also to finish up.\nAll the protected methods here\nhttps://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/blob/d4f8f8ceac73d35617108701981789da534954e7/src/ImageSharp/Image/PixelAccessor.cs#L232\nAnd their overrides here\nhttps://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/blob/d4f8f8ceac73d35617108701981789da534954e7/src/ImageSharp/PixelAccessor.cs\nLooking at the original implementations, I don't believe we need to check for endianness since we know the order in which the bytes are stored and will deliver them the correct way in the decoders/encoders.\n. @mellinoe Yeah of course, The methods identified in PixelAccessor<TColor, TPacked> and the optimised PixelAccessor classes allow it to read and write to the encoders in the the requested order. These methods will eventually be used to optimise the codecs (Bmp has already been done)\nComponentOrder.XYZW is the equivalent of RGBA in Color and ComponentOrder.ZYXW of BGRA.\nThere is a visual test DecodeThenEncodeImageFromStreamShouldSucceed Which should be giving your garbled output with your PR in its current status. Fixing, the order we read/write in the identified methods should fix them.\nHope that helps!\n. Yeah, will do. \ud83d\ude42 \n. Odd... I would have sworn we would have had to change those methods. \n@mellinoe  As long as everything is now working for you (no more red) then I'm happy to merge this. @dlemstra Can you just double check I've not missed something?\n. Me also, Excellent stuff. Very much appreciated @mellinoe \n. I don't understand what you mean. According to this blog post Xamarin should be able to consume net standard libraries. https://blog.xamarin.com/net-standard-library-support-for-xamarin/ \n. It's netstandard 1.1 which Xamarin should support. The library is specifically designed to run on as many platforms as possible.\nhttps://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/blob/7b2897600e152d8bdc41d23b10ee69d04223158f/src/ImageSharp/project.json#L51\n. Great to see this open.\nHow easy is it to set a custom theme? \nAlso, how easy would it be to preserve a CNAME file in the output? Does the builder clear everything out?\n. @M-Zuber Don't worry, no rush! \ud83d\ude04 \n. Yeah, I agree. Only custom markdown should be present already. (I still need to read up on how that works). Yeah? OK, you're the boss! \ud83d\ude04 . Thanks for this! Good to see and really appreciate it. \nDo you have any benchmarks for before and after?\nI'll get a fix for the encoder asap. Will have to roll back to a working version and incrementally make changes to figure out what is wrong.\nThe 4bpp fix should be easy enough I'm sure. \n. @boguscoder The improvements were more about memory usage. I'll merge this and run some tests locally regarding the fixed keyword usage.  I'll have a look then at fixing the  4bbp png issue now that I have fixed the encoder.\n. @boguscoder  Here's the current state of play with the decoder with your changes and a couple of additional tweaks.\n```\nHost Process Environment Information:\nBenchmarkDotNet-Dev.Core=v0.9.9.0\nOS=Microsoft Windows NT 6.2.9200.0\nProcessor=Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700HQ CPU 2.60GHz, ProcessorCount=8\nFrequency=2531249 ticks, Resolution=395.0619 ns, Timer=TSC\nCLR=MS.NET 4.0.30319.42000, Arch=64-bit RELEASE [RyuJIT]\nGC=Concurrent Workstation\nJitModules=clrjit-v4.6.1586.0\nType=DecodePng  Mode=Throughput\n```\n| Method | Median | StdDev | Scaled | Scaled-SD | Gen 0 | Gen 1 | Gen 2 | Bytes Allocated/Op |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| System.Drawing Png | 3.1796 ms | 0.1052 ms | 1.00 | 0.00 | - | - | 47.10 | 90,395.43 |\n| ImageSharp Png | 11.7749 ms | 0.4999 ms | 3.72 | 0.19 | 69.00 | 1.00 | 178.00 | 503,921.20 |\nThat's half the memory we were using before so a nice improvement. \nThe obvious memory hog right now is the allocation of memory when assigning chunk data.

Everything here should be threadsafe but maybe it isn't.\nAnd it's definitely fine before the commit at the top of the thread? And only happens when encoding png files?\nIf so, The only real change I have made to the png encoder is using is an ArrayPool<T> to reduce allocation but that is supposed to be threadsafe also. \n. Ok... Can you do me a huge favour please and also test gif and bitmap. I want to narrow it down to the png encoder.\n. Thanks for all that... Yeah bmps are uncompressed, they'll be massive. \nThe quantizer is pretty good for gifs, I need to optimise it yet though, far too slow.\nThe encoder it is then. I'll knock up a parallel test and keep at it. \n. Give that push a go please. I was able to recreate the issue with a test and fix it. Bonus was a 20% memory usage reduction. \n. Sorry, didn't mean to close that. \nYeah, I've read that, if you look I'm only ever reading the bytesPerScanline value length from each buffer. I was just doing some debugging in parallel experimenting with something else though and sometimes that value wasn't correct. \nI can't for the life of me see how that would happen though, all the variables are private instance ones.  \nIt's after 1am here so I won't be able to do anything more tonight I'm afraid. I'll have another look when I'm more fresh.\n. Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more...\n. Hi @antonfirsov thanks for this.,\nThere's a lot of additional files included in this PR, could you please remove them so we can continue. \nCheers\nJames\n. @antonfirsov This is some seriously impressive refactoring work! The memory reduction is fantastic and the perf boost is a good boost so far. \nThe vector stuff is way beyond me I'm afraid so you are on your own there. \n. @antonfirsov No worries, \ud83d\ude04 \nI use GitHub Desktop now to avoid issues like this. I can update from the origin master to my fork in 1 click. \n. Wow... I'm reading through this code and it'll take me a wee while to get my head around it. I'll download and have a proper read over lunch. I may have to ask you to add some method descriptions/comments if there's anything I just don't get.\nI'd just like to express my thanks first though for the effort you've made. It's brilliant!\n. I'd like to say I could understand that... \ud83d\ude04 \n. Hey @antonfirsov would it be possible for you to give this one last polish before I merge the PR in? \nI'd like to get it up to the commenting and formatting standards that the rest of the library is using as one of the goals for the library is ease of understanding and contribution. It would go a great deal to helping me understand your work better also.\nThanks!. It depends... If you still have your csproj you can do it fairly automatically using Stylecop Analysers. Otherwise the Resharper StyleCop extension will give you some automatic fixes and suggestions.\nWe actually have Analysers in the repo but in xproj it only works on build and you have to follow the output messages to navigate and manually fix the formatting. Excellent. Thanks!. Hmmm... I'd go with v0 to v etc... like you have with the r0 values above. Couldn't find the equivalent in the master branch so not too sure what they represent.. Thanks for the updates... \ud83d\udcaf \nI'm going to merge this in now in it's current form as I want to do some refactoring of the way we use formats. The merge conflicts in JpegEncoderCore.cs  were odd, don't know why git had an issue as they were simple enough once I had the IDE opened.\nLooking forward to what else you can bring once you are able to do so again. This is really great!. Just been running some benchmarks and it seems memory usage has skyrocketed again..\nMethod |       Mean |    StdDev | Scaled | Scaled-StdDev |    Gen 0 |    Gen 1 |    Gen 2 | Allocated |\n---------------------- |----------- |---------- |------- |-------------- |--------- |--------- |--------- |---------- |\n'System.Drawing Jpeg' |  7.9317 ms | 0.1200 ms |   1.00 |          0.00 |        - |        - |        - | 260.61 kB |\n'ImageSharp Jpeg' | 34.0607 ms | 0.3736 ms |   4.30 |          0.08 | 387.5000 | 387.5000 | 387.5000 |   6.82 MB |.

Yeah @antonfirsov... Something's not correct here \n@adamsitnik, Sorry for the name drop but would you be able to explain these numbers for us a little bit more please? The results are a bit confusing and unexpected.. Thanks @adamsitnik That's really good of you to pitch in. It's a lot more clear now.\n@antonfirsov That's the number of GC collects per 1K operations I believe.\n. That \u2b06\ufe0f is AWESOME!. We can now do some pretty crazy things.\nvar image = new Image(inputStream)\n    .To<Bgr565, ushort>()\n    .To<Bgra4444, ushort>()\n    .To<Bgra5551, ushort>()\n    .To<Byte4, uint>()\n    .To<HalfSingle, ushort>()\n    .To<HalfVector2, uint>()\n    .To<HalfVector4, ulong>()\n    .To<Rg32, uint>()\n    .To<Rgba1010102, uint>()\n    .To<NormalizedByte2, ushort>()\n    .To<NormalizedByte4, uint>()\n    .To<NormalizedShort2, uint>()\n    .To<NormalizedShort4, ulong>()\n    .To<Short2, uint>()\n    .To<Short4, ulong>()\n    .Save(outputStream);\nWHAAAAAAAAAAAAT???!!!!!. \ud83d\ude04 It's actually in good shape what with the scaling and offset adjustments. It's red simply because HalfSingle only preserves the red channel. I deliberately left out Alpha8 since it would preserve nothing in a jpeg.\n\n\n. Hmmmm... Probably the ArrayPool stuff again. Odd, it really doesn't seem to be threadsafe. \nWould you be able to fork the repo and conduct your tests with a reverted decoder? I'll test myself when I can. . Och not at all, at least it looks like it should be an easy fix then. Would you like to give it a go? You have the advantage of tests that work. \nI really need to beef up my parallel test. . Hi @lukemurray \nWould it be possible to post an actual code sample. I want to be sure you are not trying to lock an already locked image. \nCheers\nJames. Hmmm... Nothing seems amiss there that I can see. \nI think what is most likely happening is that it's attempting to crop with a rectangle outwith the bounds of the image. Maybe a bounds check gone wrong? \nThe best way to ascertain what is happening would be to download the source and attach a debugger. Without that it's going to be incredibly difficult for me to properly diagnose and fix the issue.\nThe place to look is the PixelAccessor<TColor,TPacked> indexer.. It most certainly should, I just need to do it in a way that doesn't hurt performance. \nRealistically it should never hit the point you did though and input should be sanitized. Better sanitation of input is on my ever-growing todo list.. Cheers for that. Merged \ud83d\udcaf . Hi Alex, \nI actually had a version that was interpolating the result but it didn't seem to make much a difference with the output. \nI'll try again some time but it's not high on the priority list just now. Maybe someone from the community can step up.\nCheers\nJames. I had another go. \nhttps://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/commit/b168a1d766330e333fc4ba24756b184d81f999e6\nOutput is still exactly the same as before. Answers on a postcard..... \ud83d\ude16 . No worries.... I'll crack it eventually. . @alex-birch It's been almost a year but I've finally cracked it!. Hi @gk7gk7 please see #14 \nThere are new options available on the latest build which allow both setting position and size. Please download that and give it a go.\nCheers\nJames. @cleftheris not to my knowledge could you be more specific please. It's impossible to determine what you mean. . Excellent! Thanks for this \ud83d\udcaf . How are you using the library?\nThe default quality of the Jpeg encoder is 75, which is settable. \nI doubt very much this has anything to do with the resize algorithms. (Which are configurable to suite your needs).. Hmmmm.... Setting the Quality property on the Image class should work.  \nThis property will most likely disappear pretty soon though as we refactor the codec API to make it more sensible (see #26) so the approach you are taking will be a little more future proof.. No worries \ud83d\ude04 . Hi @davidliang2008  Glad you're a fan of our work \ud83d\udc4d \nWe're actually gonna refactor the save methods. As part of this Quality will get dropped from everything but jpeg anyway since they're not really controlling the quality of the output, rather the color palette. \nCheers\nJames. @tocsoft You're a coding machine!!!\nI'll do a quick review of the code to make sure everything fits. I have a couple of questions about the partial usage and IDisposable so I'll add them in the review. \nI'd also like to ask your thoughts on the API itself.\nHow did you find it to work with and extend? Did it feel natural and straightforward or are there things you would change if you could?\nHow is the current performance of the drawing algorithms. Were there API limitations that you feel had a negative impact on performance?. @prepare I've been following your work. \ud83d\udc4d I'll open a specific issue for font rendering so we can chat.\n@antonfirsov Yeah, I saw pretty much the same and identified a pretty big issue on a hot path too, see my comments above.\n@tocsoft There's a few things here I'd like to change. \nMultiDimensional arrays. Either use a linear or jagged array - both are way faster.\nIDisposable. There doesn't seem to be any requirement for it and I swear I saw static references to IDisposable objects in the code somewhere. \nPoint, PointF. They're not adding anything to the API and require enumerable allocations every time they are used. I say scrap em.\nLinq. Linq is useful but a performance killer, especially on hot paths like in DrawPathProcessor We need to find alternatives to that. \n. #38 for font support.. Replacing that Linq statement in DrawPathProcessor with a simple loop. \nvar dist = this.paths.Select(p => p.Distance(offsetX, offsetY)).OrderBy(p => p.DistanceFromPath).First();\n```\nvar dist = Closest(offsetX, offsetY);\nprivate PointInfo Closest(int x, int y)\n{\n    PointInfo result = default(PointInfo);\n    float distance = float.MaxValue;\nfor (int i = 0; i < this.paths.Length; i++)\n{\n    var p = this.paths[i].Distance(x, y);\n    if (p.DistanceFromPath < distance)\n    {\n        distance = p.DistanceFromPath;\n        result = p;\n    }\n}\n\nreturn result;\n\n}\n```\nBefore\nMethod |       Mean |    StdErr |    StdDev | Scaled | Scaled-StdDev |      Gen 0 |     Gen 1 |    Gen 2 | Allocated |\n---------------------------- |----------- |---------- |---------- |------- |-------------- |----------- |---------- |--------- |---------- |\n'System.Drawing Draw Lines' |  3.5471 ms | 0.0681 ms | 0.2549 ms |   1.00 |          0.00 |  1246.8750 |  434.3750 | 434.3750 |   5.15 MB |\n'ImageSharp Draw Lines' | 35.8006 ms | 0.2836 ms | 1.0983 ms |  10.14 |          0.70 | 41125.0000 | 1269.5313 | 437.5000 | 135.68 MB |\nAfter\nMethod |       Mean |    StdErr |    StdDev | Scaled | Scaled-StdDev |     Gen 0 |    Gen 1 |    Gen 2 | Allocated |\n---------------------------- |----------- |---------- |---------- |------- |-------------- |---------- |--------- |--------- |---------- |\n'System.Drawing Draw Lines' |  3.5000 ms | 0.0356 ms | 0.1380 ms |   1.00 |          0.00 | 1115.6250 | 303.1250 | 303.1250 |   5.15 MB |\n'ImageSharp Draw Lines' | 10.4963 ms | 0.1033 ms | 0.4258 ms |   3.00 |          0.16 |  929.8986 | 868.2432 | 867.3986 |   7.66 MB |. @tocsoft meant to ask as I didn't see. Is there antialiasing options? I didn't see any. I'd like to be able to optionally turn antialiasing off if need be. . You survived the first round of code bashing! \ud83c\udf89 \nI always feel like I'm doing something horrible doing code reviews. It's all too easy to come across as too picky or simply miss intent. \nI think with a little bit of work we can actually out-perform System.Drawing which is simply brilliant so it shows you're definitely well on the right track. \nOne other thing I was thinking perf wise was passing params to methods. That allocates an array which we have no control over. I was think that if we passed arrays instead the end user could pool them if need be which would give them greater power over performance. What do you think?\nRe: antialias, I would prefer more granular control if possible. I see why Graphics was created but I'm not a fan. . >You can still pass in an array when using params, just save those people who don't care about the array to not have to deal with them but allows those that do care to care.\n@tocsoft Oh yeah! totally forgot that. Ignore me then.\nThere's not much in the speed difference in those array benchmarks but definitely a difference in allocations. Do you think the lack of length enforcement is a major issue? I use jagged arrays throughout the convolution classes.\n@antonfirsov I think I'd have to see a gist to understand you properly. I think I get the principle though so if we can, we should do that now.. Just had a quick look at the updates before I go to bed. It's looking much better now. \nI'll run the benchmarks in the morning but I reckon they must be much closer than before. If you're happy then I'll merge the PR then and we can continue with any improvements after. \nThanks again for your efforts. It's been brilliant! . Good luck! Everything is merged no. Good times!. @dlemstra I think splitting up the library is still a wise idea. I just need to get my head around the build/publish/deployment process with correct versioning etc. @Jeavon might be able to help there.\n@tocsoft @prepare I've deliberately left the rest of the library supporting streams only to allow support for netstandard1.1 Is this going to cause problems?. Great stuff! . Agreed. Option 2 would be best. I'd like to keep the original rectangle as is and use it simply for expressing an area of interest. I might even drop the original Ellipse as I'm not sure it's being used anywhere. . Hi @pconfig thanks for raising this and supplying the offending image. \n@dlemstra You had a quick look at this didn't you? Could you note your findings here please and I'll see if I can figure out how to get it working. . Ok... So what we originally thought was CMYK was actually YCCK... (I really do hate Jpeg and Adobe most of all.)\nI've added the conversion method but without ICC profile support we're not going to be able to get the hue/saturation 100% correct. . I'd say that's more than a tiny boost. Great stuff!. Ah this is great! I'm trying to make the code as readable as possible so this really helps. \ud83d\udc4d . That's great to hear! Thanks for helping out \ud83d\ude04 . Yeah... Ideally we should load the images once and then clone them when testing using the new Image(image) constructor. This will much reduce the overall testing time. \nHowever, I'm not sure how we would then test output appropriately. Certain tests we can run and mathematically ensure output accuracy but others require human interaction to test the output visually. \nI think we should definitely try to improve the test performance but also understand that testing this library is a different beast to testing many libraries.\nWhat's everyone's thoughts on this?\nOn AssemblyInitialzeAttribute. xUnit doesn't have a similar attribute nor is adding it. https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/431 though they demonstrate achieving the same effect through their extensibility model.\nhttps://github.com/xunit/samples.xunit/tree/27d39b6833c3bd1ed607054db99bb925f810d456/AssemblyFixtureExample\n. @tocsoft They'll run an order of magnitude quicker in release mode. No bounds checks on the indexer for one.. I\u2019m gonna close this. Our tests are a different beast after two years. . @tocsoft Let's see if we can get this build situation sorted. It might well take our combined powers but we really should be separating the projects as early as possible. \nI'll leave you and @prepare to chat performance for now as I'll really need to study the code in order to spot anything and you will both already know where to look when optimizing. \nOn embedding the library. @prepare What are your plans for LayoutFarm/Typography? Will there be a nuget package we could rely on and if so, what will be the base install availability. I hear NetStandard 1.1 is possible?. Hi @vidstige good to hear from you and excellent work on your package!\nYeah, we'd really like to support your library rather than simply taking source code so we thought consuming a nuget package would be a good way to do it. That way any changes or improvements we make can be made directly in your repo and benefit everybody. \nOne thing we need to be sure of though is minimum framework support. At the moment with your code integrated directly we are able to support netstandard 1.1. Is that something you will be able to easily support?. I think porting clipper would definitely be the best bet. It's not been updated since Jan 2014 so we should be safe for discrepancies. I think once we remove some of the compiler conditionals too and perform a cleanup we'll see places we can use numerics to improve our performance too.\nIt is a black box though so....\n\n!. Happy to merge this then. Thanks!. @olivif Nice work!\n\n\nSA1649 - File name must match first type name (4)\n\n\nI'm up for renaming to the explicit generic version. I just used the current naming on a whim as I was refactoring the brushes. \n\n\nSA1401 - Field must be private (4)\n\n\nIf it's not references anywhere outside the class make it a private field, otherwise a property.\n\n\nCS0219 - The variable <> is assigned but its value is never used (4)\n\n\nIf they're not used it's an oversight and the variables should never be assigned.\nOf course run the tests to make sure nothing breaks \ud83d\ude38 \n. Whoop! \ud83c\udf89 . And the winner of the \"First person to push errors\" award goes to me!. @dlemstra Over to you..... It seems odd that Vector2.One and Vector2.Zero passed to a constructor would produce the same hashcode though since the hashcodes are based on the packed value. Definitely worth investigating.. Thanks for checking!. Hi @tocsoft Nice work getting this ported! I've merged everything in and the tests all seem to pass. \nDo you have Resharper? I noticed it was warning me about a few unused methods in the Clipper files. Just wanted to check you are seeing the same. . I can pull them out, it's no biggie. Can barely code without Resharper now. Actually got the license from doing open source. . @olivif Great! \nI think I can improve on this after the merge and actually use IEquality comparers rather than dynamic and object.. Hi @jarroda \nI had a look and it's some optimizations to the gif decoder that appear to have broken the decoder. I have created a branch to work on the problem and have managed to revert the code to get a working code sample. I need to reapply the optimizations though one at a time in order to get a final working version so it may take a day or two. \nCheers\nJames. Fixed now. Getting an odd result on a couple of frames when using the Octree Quantizer but the others work. Enjoy!. Yeah, there's no reason why it couldn't Several of the image formats support reading and writing grayscale images. Storing the image in grayscale would be as simple as implementing an IPackedPixel format. \nIt might be an idea to add a built in one actually. . @tocsoft \nThat's pretty damn cool!\nThe only thing concerns me about this PR is the introduction of the new IReadOnlyPixelAccessor<TColor>. I don't think it is required and we should pass the concrete PixelAccessor<TColor>. I'm fairly certain using the interface on a hotpath will slow things down and we are never going to require another implementation of the functionality anyway. (If we test, we test the real thing).\nUsing the interface also restricts us if we ever need to change the functionality, Changing an interface is major version stuff. \n. @antonfirsov 46  files is a lot of changes to review! I think next time it might be prudent to split the changes up a little. \nDo you have to before benchmarks so we can compare like for like? My current machine has thermal limiting which ruins benchmarking.\nDo you have at idea what causes the slowdown on larger images? It's quite a dramatic change.\n. @antonfirsov I just updated your links to use the timestamped versions so we can never lose them.\nA 2X improvement is nice! The memory improvements are incredible also. Great stuff! \nI'll tell you what though, that C# is starting to look less and less so... I'm gonna have to upskill to keep up with you.\nDon't worry about the size of the PR, it's easy to get addicted... 4 1/2 years I've found myself doing imaging for now. No idea how I got here! \nWe'll definitely have to try to make future changes more incremental though I think, or at least write as many comments per code as we can. Some of the changes are really quite difficult to follow. \nDefinitely keen to see what plans you have re parallelization. Not read that article before and will need to check some existing work now. \nAs for the decoder... You're crazy but I love it!  . @antonfirsov \n\nHowever functions with lacking comments often belong to the original Jpeg codebase where I fail to understand all the details.\n\nAbsolutely appreciate how difficult this must be for you. The original Golang implementation is a mess. I don't know how they manage the framework with such low standards.\n\nThe only thing that could help us here is to early-adapt Span. It's already moved to the corefx repo from corefxlabs, and the API seems to be pretty stable. We can include it as git submodule. I think we need to introduce it in ImageSharp before it gets too late!\n\nAgreed. There's a couple of things missing (Fill, Clear) but they are coming soon. We should definitely be  careful while using it in it's current form though as things will be subject to change still I'm sure.\nLet's go ahead and try adding Span<T> we know we will be using it. \n\nI'll be very happy if we could find a way to speed-up merging my work.\n\nYes, and I've been giving it some thought. The contributions that you, @tocsoft and @olivif have provided so far have been extraordinary and the library simply wouldn't be anywhere as good as it is just now without your efforts. So... I'm extending an invite to the three of you. If you would like and you think you can provide the commitment over time I can officially add you all to the team. \nBut....\n\nIt's paramount that we stick to the rules as I set them (StyleCop sets them). It's tried and tested and the only way I can ensure consistency throughout the library. \nWe'll still use PR's for larger changes but smaller incremental changes could be made much more easily. \nWhat do you think?. @antonfirsov Great stuff! Let's get the final changes you suggested to PixelArea done and a little cleanup and I'll merge this later today. Welcome aboard! \ud83d\ude04 . Awesome! I've sent you both invites and added you to the readme. \n\nDo you think it would make sense to create PRs for everything?\n\nPR's are probably the best thing to do for the most part but sometimes i'll forget.. @olivif Yeah that's fine. Go ahead.. @antonfirsov  TBH I'm not even sure AlmostEqual should be a thing. It's a hack. I would vote for removing it and doing comparisons like any other object containing floating point properties. . @olivif  Yeah mostly for testing.  . @antonfirsov  Every day is a school day! Sorry @olivif let's keep it then. . I'm gonna merge this now unless anyone has any objections. The performance benefits are obvious and it doesn't overcomplicate the API. @antonfirsov What's the biggest cause of the allocations? We seem to be using huge amounts of memory compared to System.Drawing.. Ah you've got me there! No worries.\n\nImageBase.pixelBuffer not beiing pooled. Nothing, but Image : IDisposable can save us. \ud83d\ude1e\n\nReally? I'm not seeing this with the other formats. I'm assuming it is due to the benchmark running on multiple images?. I'll merge this now then continue our conversation. \n\nLarge images also bring in the LOH fragmentation issue \ud83d\ude22\n\nYou're gonna get LOH framentation with image processing anyway you cut it since you need to pin the array for processing. \nIDisposable could be a possibility but it introduces a lot of complexity throughout the API. For example, creating and assigning new TColor arrays to images like in Crop. We'd have to rent the array from within the processor but return it when the image is disposed. That feels spaghetti to me.\n. That's the argument in a nutshell. IDisposable isn't difficult (or certainly shouldn't be) but I've seen it misused so many times it bothers me. (Why ImageProcessor exists essentially). \nI may have  a play around with a branch to see what I come up with.  . I think IDisposable would be the last complicated approach. I'll try to have a look at that today.\n\nImageSharp arrays are not always pinned. Only when you Lock()them for a PixelAccessor.\n\nYeah but you should pin a large array if you are doing unsafe manip. I can't think of a better way to do what we are doing just now.. @olivif Good fix for <= Definitely a bug.. >ImageSharp.Transforms\nContains methods like Resize, Crop, Skew, Rotate - Anything that alters the dimensions of the image.\nImageSharp.Effects\nContains methods like Gaussian Blur, Pixelate, Edge Detection - Anything that maintains the original image dimensions.\nTransforms and Effects can be merged into one project now I have removed IImageSampler.\n@dlemstra Drawing.Text should definitely be a separate library since we are introducing a dependency.. @tocsoft Maybe ImageSharp.Processors? Transforms are a specific form of image processing. Dunno though, naming is hard!. We'll really have to put some thought to how to build, version, and deploy all those projects though. At the moment I have no idea how we will manage it all.. @tocsoft What you've demoed is really cool but it introduces an issue. What happens if there are no changes within individual projects? Upping the version number and releasing a new package when there are no changes breaks semantic versioning which is a big no-no.\nPerhaps we could figure out a way to detect whether the individual projects have changed (via git) and only bump the version number then?\nOn Formats... I intend for users to have to register formats in the manner Asp.NET Core requires registering Middleware and other objects - Convention always trumps configuration. \nReflection is a nightmare, take a look at the crap I have to do in ImageProcessor.\nhttps://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageProcessor/blob/bfa1105ff6dc9d517740b12b1ad598e20d84afb8/src/ImageProcessor/Configuration/ImageProcessorBootstrapper.cs#L95\nhttps://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageProcessor/blob/bfa1105ff6dc9d517740b12b1ad598e20d84afb8/src/ImageProcessor/Common/Helpers/TypeFinder.cs \n@olivif Processing works for me. Namespacing also.\n@antonfirsov I'd like to keep some stuff under the same flat namespace Common, Helpers, Exceptions, Image, PixelAccessor etc. In VS2017 we will be able to explicitly state folders as non namespaced with Resharper so warnings will go away.. We shouldn't use the Asp DI since that would be a dependency limiting our deployment possibilities. \nA static Bootstrapper allows third parties to create formats and then register them without having to use reflection or any other craziness. It also works in every conceivable application environment I can think of. (Reflection don't work with statically linked libraries for example)\nIf I add it to Image as a constructor argument I then have to use that overload for all images (including internally created ones) which simply wouldn't be possible.\nThat article is interesting but to me it boils down to application requirements. . Sweet. Looking forward to seeing what you come up with. \nBasically, as it stands, without correct individual versioning there is no advantage to be gained in splitting up the library since we cannot release individual projects out-of-band.\n\n@JimBobSquarePants what about users who need different bootstrapping configurations in a single process? It's uncommon, but it can happen in extreme cases with laaaaarge applications.\n\nTell them to bugger off for being awkward.. @antonfirsov I was being tongue -in-cheek about the buffer off thing. @tocsoft solution seems like a sound plan.\nExtension methods... Yeah, I guess they should all be flat. It makes discovery much easier for the end-user.. What's the current opinion on this? I'll need to be merged before #64 . @antonfirsov At first I thought this would cause conflict issues but there's no reason why that should be the case if we do this with the same strictness as our normal unit tests. \nWanna create a PR?. VS2017 won't be happening anytime soon. I just uninstalled it. Carry on..... Hi @mateusleonardi \nHave you added the MyGet feed to your project? Follow the link from the Readme and click \"Connect to feed\" on the gallery page.\nhttps://www.myget.org/F/imagesharp/api/v3/index.json\n\nI'm using Visual Studio 2015 but my server is linux so it's necessary my server be able to download your package using \"dotnet restore\" from the linux. \n\nI don't understand what you mean. You wouldn't use dotnet restore on your linux server, there should be no project files there only your build/deployment output.\n\nI tried to run it with ASP .NET Core 1.1.0 and I couldn't.\nIs it possible to upgrade the asp .net core for this project?\n\nYou're doing something wrong there. I can do this no problem without any changes. Is your project.json file correct?\n\nCould you do me a favour and in the future use the Gitter Chatroom for general questions. The issue tracker is primarily for issues only. \nCheers\nJames\n. @tocsoft Probably... Can't get the tests to pass on AppVeyor just now, everything works locally but I can't figure out from the limited stacktrace what is going wrong.. Cheers! Not sure why those numbers are different either.. Fixed it, the initializer code was never getting called and the image class was not throwing an error when there were no formats. All fixed now and ready for further review.. I'm tentatively approving this. Can everyone cast one final look at the updates and also read the versioning info in build/Program.cs to double check the logic. If we're all happy we can then merge and carry on. @tocsoft You can do the honours \ud83d\ude04 \nGreat work!!. Let's make sure we add the library names to the readme also. . https://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/blob/master/contributing.md. Urgggghh... So you're using a package that some idiot decided to add to Nuget which has absolutely nothing to do with me and you are expecting me to fix it?. Ah great stuff! I'll do a quick review now.. http://sampleicc.sourceforge.net/\nhttp://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/TagNames/ICC_Profile.html\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/ImageApp/Listings/ICC_h.html. Hi @JBildstein,\nThanks so much for getting in touch and helping out! ICC profiles are are complicated beast and your experience is most welcome! \nI've made a start in a feature/icc branch by adding a large number of the tags and descriptions from the specification. \nhttps://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/commit/be197bd5b66136ddcc749614c5303d52f9467843\nI've shifted my focus just now though to porting the color conversion code from Colourful.NET into our library replacing the current colorspaces (We can't use your conversion code as a basis as it uses reflection.Emit) I'll be doing a lot of work within that conversion to boost performance. I've made a good start, just not pushed anything yet.\nIf you could focus on ICC reading/writing that would be great!\nManaging the combination of our work is the trickiest part and I think the best way to do this is as follows.\n\nI give you temporary write access to the repo.\nI create a work-in-progress PR from my feature branch. \nWe can continue to push to the feature branch until we are happy with the changes.  \n\nDoing the above make handling merges much easier and allows us to move rapidly. \nHow does that sound?\nCheers\nJames. I've created the PR here. If you work on the feature/icc branch it'll automatically update.\nhttps://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/pull/144\nI'll be having a very close look at your library to combine the best of both worlds.. This is almost ready to close. A few conversion bits and we're laughing \ud83d\udc4f . @pkese  We still don't have conversion using those classes in our jpeg decoder. Once we have them I'll close this.. @JBildstein No worries there, we've got time \ud83d\ude04 . If there's anything I can help with please let me know.. Good man, no worries. Using scaled integers with bit-shifting like this is a pretty standard way to optimize code like this. The original DCT code did this for example. \nYeah push benchmarks to master if you like. . @antonfirsov True that... I wonder sometimes whether we are, to coin a phrase my mother uses trying to \"make a silk purse out of a sows ear\". basing our decoder on the Golang implementation. Yeah it works but it's so messy it feels like it has to be fundamentally architecturally flawed. \nI was very briefly looking at the codebase for Google's new jpeg decoder/encoder and it's a joy to read the code in comparison with Golangs. Everything is right where I'd expect it to be. \nhttps://github.com/google/guetzli\nThe way they color transform is interesting also. \nhttps://github.com/google/guetzli/blob/master/guetzli/color_transform.h#L211\nI wonder whether we should try and build an alternative as an experiment? . I think multithreading will be a patch rather than a solution. We can beat System.Drawing with our Bmp format on a single thread so it should theoretically be possible to do the same (or at least come close with Jpeg) \nThe refactoring work you've done so far is amazing but I don't want you to go so far down a path trying to refactor that codebase that it becomes a chore. \nMaybe have a look at libjpeg-turbo and see if there is any idea we can borrow from there?. @anton That's great news on the performance front!\nI would certainly also prefer to keep our current work if we can continue to refactor the code to increase performance and reduce overheads and pinch bits from other libraries. We do seem to have a pressing issue with the jpeg encoder though. \nDownload and take a look at https://github.com/bleroy/core-imaging-playground and run the LoadResizeSave method in Program.cs (Don't bother running the benchmarks)\nOur jpeg output is awful compared to the others even if I set the supsampling to 4:4:4 and the quality to 100% (Oddly 4:4:4 is worse than 4:2:0 which it simply shouldn't be)\nI'm thinking of digging out the old encoder I wrote in the jpeg branch updating the code and having a look at the output quality there and, if the quality is better, attempt to discern what the differences are. . Grim eh? I was pretty gutted to discover this. . J'accuse! \ud83d\ude1d \nThanks for investigating this and I'm glad you found a cause. I'll leave it in your capable hands for now and I won't merge this in either. (We'll see whether we need it first) . Good work. I've just pushed a change that changes our subsampling rules to match those of Photoshop 4:4:4 default falling to 4:2:0 at <=50% quality. That improves the output quality but increases the size. Gonna experiment with the quality + this PR's changes now.. I'm finding the output is actually more pleasing to my eye (I tiny bit sharper for bleroys images; closer to ImageMagick) so once the CI checks pass I'm merging it. . I can actually pretty much mimic ImageMagick using the Lanczos3Resampler, our filesize is larger though as  we use standard Huffman tables rather than optimized. \nhttp://www.impulseadventure.com/photo/optimized-jpeg.html. Interesting, yeah that should definitely be slower. \nThe main feature I'd like to see really is progressive encoding. Any other features I expect developer to help add if they really require the functionality. \nI want to revisit the color code again for CMYK and YccK decoding myself. Looking at BitMiracle they do a lot of table building (I think guetzli precalculates them as I recall) and our output seems over saturated.\nhttps://github.com/BitMiracle/libjpeg.net/blob/master/LibJpeg/Classic/Internal/jpeg_color_deconverter.cs\nIncidentally I think we should add BitMiracle to our decoding encoding benchmarks.. Oh wow! Yeah, big difference. I'll have a good dig through your changes tonight to get my head round them.. Re progressive, not yet. Will keep looking. . That code is poorly ported, and I suspect very slow but the lookup principle is one I've seen in various implementations now. \nI've been benchmarking different approaches but agree we could test more. . Hi @sanghv1987 \nCould you please read over the Contribution Guidelines highlighted to you when you raised this issue. It is imperative that you supply the version numbers as it makes it difficult for us to triage issues otherwise.\nAlso, please do not combine issues when raising them. \nTesting the images I can see that there is indeed a bug in our decoding of interlaced png files. However, I see no issue with the jpeg file. You have simply saved it at a lower quality (hint: Image has a Quality property).\nCould you please supply those version numbers.\nThanks \nJames. The png in question is an 8bit interlaced image with no filtering. I'm not sure what is going wrong yet. Looks like an offsetting calculation issue in the Adam7 deinterlacing though.. @sanghv1987 We've just pushed a fix for the png decoder. We've also done some work to improve jpeg output also. Please download the update from MyGet.. @dlemstra Was the genius here. Fixed it in a heartbeat after I spent hours looking at it. . DotTrace yeah? It's throwing for me when testing cases inherit FileTestBase\n```\nThe type initializer for 'ImageSharp.Tests.FileTestBase' threw an exception.\nUnable to find Formats directory at any of these locations [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\TestImages\\Formats\\, C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\tests\\ImageSharp.Tests\\TestImages\\Formats\\, C:\\TestImages\\Formats]\n   at ImageSharp.Tests.GeneralFormatTests.DecodeThenEncodeImageFromStreamShouldSucceed() in C:\\development\\github\\ImageSharp\\tests\\ImageSharp.Tests\\Formats\\GeneralFormatTests.cs:line 53\n   at ImageSharp.Tests.TestFile.Create(String file) in C:\\development\\github\\ImageSharp\\tests\\ImageSharp.Tests\\TestFile.cs:line 89\n   at ImageSharp.Tests.FileTestBase..cctor() in C:\\development\\github\\ImageSharp\\tests\\ImageSharp.Tests\\FileTestBase.cs:line 19\n   at ImageSharp.Tests.TestFile.GetFormatsDirectory() in C:\\development\\github\\ImageSharp\\tests\\ImageSharp.Tests\\TestFile.cs:line 151\n   at ImageSharp.Tests.TestFile..cctor() in C:\\development\\github\\ImageSharp\\tests\\ImageSharp.Tests\\TestFile.cs:line 27\n```. No concerns, merge away \ud83d\udc4d . @dlemstra @tocsoft Thanks.. That answer does the trick but...\n@dj-nitehawk It's best to also explain why ImageSharp is actually doing the right thing without AutoRotate\nImageSharp is actually correctly resizing those images.\nJpeg files have specific values in something called the Start of Frame marker which defines the width and height of the image. ImageSharp, like any other library (e.g System.Drawing) will read those values to determine the correct dimensions and layout of the byte array to store that image data. \nThe EXIF metadata contained within the image is additional, unrelated data that is sometimes used to determine how the image is displayed (i.e. rotation).\nThis data does not determine how the width and height of an image is calculated. Software like Photoshop might (I haven't tested) present the image in a rotated fashion with the dimensions swapped to make it less confusing for the end user but a graphics library will not.\nI hope that makes sense . Odd... I'll double check the loop property logic later. Is it just on Facebook, if so could they be altering the displayed image?. Thanks for the code sample. \nIf the problem only exists on Facebook then I suspect Facebook is changing the file. I would do a compare between the file saved and the file rendered. I suspect they purposely alter the loop count to reduce animation in Facebook posts. . >but why original .gif file working\nI'm sorry, I don't understand.. Are you using the various config packages listed in the readme?. They should get automatically loaded. It could be the case that you are not directly using any of the methods so the binary is not loaded. Try adding them using the Configuration.Default method. . Good point @tocsoft \n```\npublic static void StripExif(Stream stream)\n{\n    // exception thrown here\n    var image = new Image(stream);\n// strip Exif tags\n\n}\n```\n@vaindil  It looks like you are not resetting the stream after you are copying to it. Try setting the position to 0 before creating the image.\n. Don't worry about it! We're all learning. :smile:. As far as I'm aware NET 4.6.1 was the first version to have vectors baked in. 4.5 requires the reference. Will double check. . Absolutely! I hate all the project target stuff so that would really help. . >You probably allready are aware of that but with System.Drawing it takes on avg: 300ms and with ImageSharp arround 1300ms. Anyway to speed it up?\nWell I guess I could start a multinational tech giant, throw millions of dollars and thousands of man hours at it...\nSeriously, this is alpha software developed by a very small team of dedicated individuals trying to do some good in the world. The only way we can make our jpeg codecs faster and produce more optimized output is with help, of which we get very little. \n\nIt looks like the ImageSharp Resized image contains a bit more green.\n\nWell... They'll be using different samplers won't they? HighQualityBicubic isn't really Bicubic, if it was then the output would be the same. Personally if you want high quality output I would recommend the Lanczos3 resampler (for enlarging probably MitchellNetravali).. @wcrooy There really was no intent on being rude so I'll apologise here as well as Twitter.\n@davepermen The greenness might have been caused by a lower level of accuracy translating RGBA to YCrCr in the jpeg encoder (and the reverse in the decoder) I pushed a change last night that to my eye improved things and a per-pixel comparison in Beyond Compare indicated that the rgb values were less green. If someone else could confirm that it would be great.\n@jackmott That benchmark is just for resize though yeah? The issues we have are mostly in the jpeg decoder. One of our team @antonfirsov has done some extraordinary work speeding it up so far (10x faster than BitMiracle.LibJpeg.NET, using over 170MB less memory in my recent testing) but it's still ~4-5 slower than System.Drawing. . Hmmmm... I can't explain that then. Our color translation should be very accurate. . Oh, those versions aren't the latest btw. You're at least 5 builds behind. . @wcrooy Here's the latest comparisons. There's certainly less green in the later version than before now that the conversion accuracy has been improved. Still more than System.Drawing though.\nAs far as I can see the algorithms I'm using are correct. The resamplers have been tested using ImageWorsener to ensure accuracy and the color transform output matches other libraries passing equivalent unit tests. I'd like to see the output from those other libraries you tested against if I could to do a full spectrum compare.\nSystem.Drawing\n\nImageSharp Old\n\nImageSharp Latest\n\n. @wcrooy Good news! \nI finally got around to switching out our color conversion methods with ones mathematically identical to those used by libjpeg and libjpeg turbo. If you check out the PR mentioned above you'll see a quite dramatic difference.\nThanks for your patience \ud83d\udc4d . Thanks yeah, a duplicate. Let's close this. . Thanks for this. I haven't forgotten it and once the team has a look we'll see about getting it merged \ud83d\udc4d . Sweet. I'll merge it then. . Will give it a shot. Thanks!. I've just pushed the new project.json files. Everything seems to work locally. \nhttps://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/commit/75b541b33fae28e256d2ef72b95aa39e23895247. Great stuff. Thanks @mellinoe for the pointers!. I think this is exactly how you are supposed to do this. Nice work! @tocsoft . I'm happy to merge this as is. We should test to see if system.drawing can decode a broken progressive jpeg some time before attempting a fix for that. If not, we'll just skip it.. @tocsoft  I had a play around with this as I realized that the image in #18 is progressive so I thought we should at least try to get something going for it. I've added the image to the repo and here's the current status. I'm not sure what causes that output, maybe @antonfirsov knows? Non-progressive renders fine.\n\n. Yeah, not my finest work. The offending exception in Bytes seems to get called everywhere though.. No worries, will do. . @tocsoft You know you're probably the only one with the chops to do this right? \ud83d\ude1b . @jongleur1983 Nah, we just forgot to tag the issue in the PR to do it automatically. Thanks for your help here. Wizard stuff! \ud83d\udc4d . No that should be fine. Mono supports NetStandard\nhttps://blog.xamarin.com/net-standard-library-support-for-xamarin/. >(Previously, I just downloaded the package and renamed it to zip to extract the DLLs).\n@nah0y That's a very odd way to add a dependency to a project. It completely bypassess all the usefulness that Nuget brings. MonoDevelop uses Nuget package manager yeah? \n@tocsoft I was experimenting with VS2017 again last night and the references it setup and pulled in were different to what we have. I wonder whether we are doing something wrong?. @nah0y Thanks for that information. I'll have a look (Time to dig out my wife's MacBook and pretend I know how to use it \ud83d\ude04 ) I suspect we just have to add configuration for another runtime dependency tree for Mono.\nNuget is the way to go. It allows handling dependencies in an elegant way which allows very incremental version control on all dependencies. + you don't want to be checking in dll's into your source control as they just use up space. . @tocsoft Ok, I'll see what I can do.. @nah0y Give 1.0.0-alpha1-00073 a go. It works for me on both NET45 and NET46 projects. \nGotta say this is some of the most impressive refactoring work i've ever seen, well done!\nI've identified a small issue though. It looks like we are somehow missing the data from the first MCU. This happens in both baseline and progressive jpegs. I couldn't see an obvious cause but I'm sure you'll spot the issue straight away.\n\nWe'll need to update the path in DecodeJpeg benchmark also to match new structure.\n. Don't worry, I almost did too! :smile:. Great stuff! I got caught out a few times with that when deallocating the png encoder.  I'll review this sometime this evening. Gotta date by the pool this afternoon. :smile:. All tests are passing and all looks clean so I'm gonna merge this. Only thing I would change would be the name of Array struct in DecodedBlockMemento just to avoid clashes. . I thought it would be something like that. Thanks for confirming. . @tocsoft Thanks for the extra info. Realistically we should only be pushing the doc changes when commited on the main branch with our work going on in a develop branch (which I plan to create and make default soon). That should considerable reduce our churn.. Will have to check with @tocsoft on the appveyor stuff but I'll build the docs locally today and have a play around. . @M-Zuber Is this PR up to date? I can't see any Wyam stuff.. I'm gonna merge this in now so I can start working on the VS2017 version. Will figure out how to do a new Docs recipe later. Cheers for all your help! \ud83d\udcaf . Thanks @daveaglick. Appreciated, btw great work Wyam is impressive!\nIf you hold off til then it'll be easier to manage the merge. I'm trying to convert the project to 2017 just now and it might be easier to do after that.. @daveaglick Dropping you a ping here as I will need your help. I want to use the docs recipe but use my own theme/markup with http://responsivebp.com/ It seems like I should replace each cshtml file with my own but a few pointers would be most appreciated.. @eat-sleep-code Can you please stop deleting the issue template. It's there for a reason. . @eat-sleep-code Also...\nhttps://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp#packages\n\nThe ImageSharp library is made up of multiple packages, to make ImageSharp do anything useful you will want to make sure you include at least one format as a dependency otherwise you will not be able to save/load any images.. Hmmm... Something amiss here. 946ms on my laptop.\n\nCould you do me a favor and tell me what the results of Vector.IsHardwareAccelerated is on your machine? I'm assuming false. Are you compiling in 32 or 64bit mode?\nMono supports NET4.6 as I recall, would it be possible to bump to that and get back to us?\nI'll double check we're not doing something daft and releasing our code in debug mode also.\n. Definitely in release mode. https://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/blob/f14dd6f91adcda9569bbf49fdff6c613ac2948bd/build/Program.cs#L106. @antonfirsov I believe a standalone metadata editor would be the best tool for that job of which there are several out in the wild. Could we build one? Yeah certainly, Probably pretty easy with the existing tools we have now but trying to configure the existing decoders to only parse metadata while ignoring the pixels seems like it would add a lot of complexity and overhead to our code. \n@clegendre Could you do me a favor and check the value Anton asked for and also post a code sample + device specifications. 1 min is slow... crazy slow even without SIMD. I don't see how we are doing enough work to even cause that much time to be consumed.. Please use the Gitter chatroom to discuss new features as described in the contribution guidlines. \n\nDo you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?\nSuggest your change in the ImageSharp Gitter Chat Room and start writing code\nDo not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.. I'll look into that. Thanks, quick question though... Why did you delete the issue template?. Thanks for chipping in there @eat-sleep-code. @Auersberg let us know how you get on  \ud83d\ude04 . @Auersberg I think you're correct there. Thanks for investigating.. Thanks, I had to wait to merge a big performance based PR before I could have a look at this. Will do asap unless you fancy knocking up a PR?. Hey @Auersberg that should be the issue fixed now. It turned out we had a little bit more to do than originally thought as we had to cater for both JFIF nd EXIF resolution properties when decoding different jpegs. \n\nPlease let me know if there are any further issues and thanks for the exceptional detail you provided to help us out. \ud83d\udcaf . It's 96 by default in System.Drawing also. . >you could even have a version of setpixels that is optimized to just swap the backing data from the new pooled pixel accessor and the image that would prevent the copy and mean that the old data would be freed up with the pooled accessor (would have to be careful not to do this when both sets of data are needed to be retained, but if the method was internal and was called something else then it shouldn't be a problem)\n@tocsoft  Isn't that exactly what I'm doing?\nhttps://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/blob/41f96faa7b23fb51463541231f0b0faf5aaa1f1c/src/ImageSharp/Image/ImageBase%7BTColor%7D.cs#L163. Please do, looking forward to seeing what you come up with. . @KLuuKer Good thinking!. So it turns out there is no error thrown after all! I could have sworn it used to. That means the catch block is gone.\n\nSetPixels() is no longer maintainable as a safe API in it's current form! Specially not as a public API.\n\n@antonfirsov Could you expand upon that? \n. @antonfirsov I was convinced it was but it isn't and I don't know why\nhttps://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/blob/94ca0779e3e0c7842742df9bb64c6a405af08a74/tests/ImageSharp.Tests/Image/PixelPoolTests.cs#L48\nScratch that, fails miserably online but not locally. \ud83d\ude16 . @tocsoft I like that, much less leaky. We'd want internal void SwapPixelsBuffers to be protected rather than internal so devs can use it though would we not?. @tocsoft Ok then, we've still got plenty of time to review that anyway. Can you post the resize benchmark results under your version please (should be the same) and if everyone's happy then you can update the PR with your changes.. Any reason I shouldn't merge this now?. @antonfirsov I'm taking that as a yes \ud83d\ude09 . I'll do that in a mo and skip CI.. >While I've been fixing the changes to remove the Apply ImageProcessors extension method I makes me think it might be worth updating IImageProcessor to take in a Region instead a rectangle and then all out processors can leverage polygons to apply there logic instead of just a rectangle.\n\n. The only issue I see with using the Shapes shapes directly would be that it would be odd referencing the namespace in order to pass parameters to our methods. . I'm happy to merge now. Last call for any additional comment! . Sorry, I pushed a small change which messed things up for you. Should be fixed.. I'm happy to have this merged. Actually planned to do the same after seeing your comment in the benchmarking code the other day. . @dlemstra I thought the same thing. \n@antonfirsov VS keeps telling me in the output window that we can speed up our compilation. I haven't followed the given instructions though yet.. Looks good to me now.. >i resolved this the issue i was having in building the source.\n@SepiaGroup That does really resolve the issue does it? Also, don't do that. Now you have a dependency issue. \nYour issue is that you are using the incorrect url to pull from. Where did you find that? \nEven following the url you provided by clicking on it throws a 404 so you should have been able to see that the url is incorrect.\nThe correct url for the package feed is:\nV3\nhttps://www.myget.org/F/imagesharp/api/v3/index.json\nV2\nhttps://www.myget.org/F/imagesharp/\nYou can find these by following the link in the readme file. \nP.S. I cannot stress this enough. Please do not delete the issue template. Doing so should have been a red flag to you submitting the issue as you didn't do the prerequisite research.\n. Hi @chrisvandijk thanks for the extra info. I'll look into this asap.\n\nIf I resave the file with another program, it works as expected.\n\nCan you clarify exactly what you mean here? What software did you use to load and resave the image?\nCheers\nJames. Excellent. I can analyse both now. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . The once the next png build finishes ImageSharp.Formats.Png.1.0.0-alpha2-00049 you should be able to load that image with no issues. Thanks again! \ud83d\udc4d . @antonfirsov We'll get there eventually. I was looking at https://github.com/JaCraig/Structure.Sketching to see if there was any indication on how the expected results there were generated but I couldn't see anything.. I think we might be stuck with the latter for result comparison as we are going to generate different results from ImageMagick and others at times. . No risk here so merging.. You're absolutely right there, this was a lazy benchmark. \ud83d\ude08 \nWas trying to push the changes before you did your work to change the typeparams so we didn't get merge conflicts. \nI would explain the closeness in that despite us using the 1D array we can never eliminate the bounds checks since the calling method has no knowledge of the underlying array bounds despite inlining.\nFor me this PR is more about API improvements than anything. Creating and populating a 5x1 jagged array is horrible compared to a 2D array and we are able to better the perf and provide the nicer API.\nYou wanna push your better benchmark in and we can merge this? . @tocsoft can we revert this change please and introduce any changes incrementally. The strict was static for a reason. We're now creating a new 1D array per instance. . The implicit operator creates a new instance of Fast2DArray. This is only called per instance of the processors. Before we created only one instance of Fast2DArray to use for all. Each Fast2DArray constructor creates a new 1D array also. . The width height constructor is fine. It's the private static changes are the issue. . Och @tocsoft sorry! Totally misread the diff!\nThought you had changed the static versions to this and was casting in the constructor. Your change is great!\n```\nprivate static readonly new float[,] KirschWest =\n              new float[,]\n              {\n                 { 5, -3, -3 },\n                 { 5,  0, -3 },\n                 { 5, -3, -3 }\n              });\n              };\n```\nNever try to read diffs on your mobile... . Is everyone happy to merge?. @antonfirsov None. all looks great to me. . Good idea! I'm assuming this is all tested and works? \nI don't have a Linux install to test on and even if I did I'd probably immediately break it with my amateurish keyboard banging.. First of I'll just note. Gitter is the correct channel for discussions like this as per the contribution guidelines. We now have a code coverage bot joining in.\nI have plans for fixing the dependency graph when we switch to VS2017. I can reference netstandard 1.6 yet create our 1.1, 1.3 etc targets much more easily there. Doing so before that switch is a waste of resources. . No worries \ud83d\ude04 \nThe way we have it now is definitely incorrect and needs to be changed to netstandard1.6 and it will. I will be keeping the low targets though. I have one of those 12 phones. \ud83d\ude1d . @Toxantron  As long as you can assure me that we don't lose the ability to install against our currently defined targets and also that the test runner will still run. Every time I've tried to upgrade our dependencies the test runner has broken in VS2015 . :smile: Yeah it's been troublesome. Certain we can sort it all soon though, thanks for trying! . @dlemstra @tocsoft We probably should change any to not use them. I've actually been burnt by that issue in the past.. Great. @dlemstra do you want to do the honours? :shipit: . Thanks for the info. Give the latest version (1.0.0-alpha2-00111) a pop.. Hi @Bartmax. This is a better fit for a discussion in Gitter. Could we continue it there please instead? . Cheers! Yeah much better. . It failed due to 160 fails unit tests. They all seem to involve the Drawing package. \nSee the console here https://ci.appveyor.com/project/JamesSouth/imagesharp/build/1.0.0.570. The appveyor build is windows so we know it works for now. Happy to merge and experiment in the future. Should be fixed now. . Thanks for adding demo code there @agr \nIt was a regression due to changes during optimization. If you give it 10 minutes there should be a new working build available. \nCheers\nJames. Great to see this opened! . @Andy-Wilkinson Hoping the merge makes things a lot easier for you!. @Andy-Wilkinson Just passing through to say, I'm blown away by the effort you are putting in here. It's incredible! \ud83d\udc4d . @Andy-Wilkinson I've had a go at fixing those merge conflicts for you but I could have made a mistake. Please let me know I've I've broken things for you.. Hi @Andy-Wilkinson \nI managed to update your fork with the latest code from our master with all test passing. \nI had a look at the effort, so far.. It's absolutely incredible! \ud83d\udc4d \nThe API is solidifying now so we should be able to make the effort to help you out a lot more to complete this (We should have helped more earlier). There's a lot of new performance goodies on offer within the codebase that we can apply in some places (memory management for example).\nI'd love to get the ball rolling again so let me know when you have some free time. . Just trying to keep this so that it builds and doesn't get too out of date. . Hi @Andy-Wilkinson \nJust dropping you a message to see whether this PR is something that that you will be able to continue with or whether we should merge it now into our own separate branch to continue working on? Ideally we would love to have your help but if that's not possible that's totally cool also.\nAdditionally would it be possible to re-sign the CLA? We lost a lot of signatures by accident when we globalized the tool across all our repositories. \nCheers\nJames. Hi @Andy-Wilkinson \nThanks for the update, I appreciate it and all your amazing efforts so far. \nI'll merge this in as-is then into a new tiff-codec branch which will then allow other contributors to help out.  . Hi @KuroThing \nThat will be because there is no WebP on the current roadmap. We're trying to replicate and improve on the functionality offered by System.Drawing for now. Once we have that, maybe.... maybe we might have a go at adding WebP. . They can recommend all they like, the browser support for those formats is terrible!. > Is it going to be reaaaally hard?\n\ud83d\ude06 \nThat's the one. I cannot imagine it's gonna be any easier than jpeg to do which has been brutal.. @simeyla \n\nThat is precisely WHY many people use a library like this. Because they need to automate the creation of JPG / WEBP / PNG files based on inconsistent browser support.\n\nIn your opinion. Plenty of other applications for this library actually. Web dev is a small fish in a big pond. \nIf you need transparency have you investigated palletized png's? You shouldn't be using png for photo style images anyway, it's the wrong format. \nI don't need WebP just now and it's both incredibly complicated and way down my priority list so if you want it, submit a PR and get things moving.\n@ststeiger \n\nFirefox already supports webp.\n\nNo it doesn't. It has a partially complete leaky decoder. . @martonx I'm afraid concrete development would be exactly the help we would require just now. Supporting the format will definitely be a focus post V1 but we cannot apply any effort towards it just now as we simply don't have the people and time.. Thanks @ststeiger \ud83d\udc4d \nIf you get around to making a start before we do please let us know and we'll provide any assistance you require.. @martonx No movement I'm afraid.. There's talk of the whole memory management thing pluggable. . But yeah, close this. The behaviour is expected. ArrayPool<T> pulls a minimum of then reuses which is beneficial in most circumstances.. @tocsoft You happy to have this merged? j'approuve.. \n. @antonfirsov You've been busy!\nI had a look at the two builds to see if I could figure out why the tests were failing the first time and not the second. No idea!. I'm happy with this now. \ud83d\udc4d . Yusssssss! Can we make our new color types now or shall we wait til I do the 2017 build? . Okily dokily.... Great to hear. I'll sit on my hands til then \ud83d\ude04 . I've given the build server a kick for you. Some proper voodoo in your optimized operations so expect questions \ud83d\ude04 . Yep. :shipit: I wanna start my VS2017 work.. @blackcity Thanks for investigating. \ud83d\udc4d \nI had a look also using PngAnalyzer which was able to decode the image as can windows itself which suggests to me that the default behaviour of most decoders is to jump out as soon a we hi the end marker.\n@vinhhrv  I've changed the code to do the same. The image now decodes properly so get the next version once it has finished building.. I'm sorry I do not understand. What is wrong with the image?. Hmmm.... The image has an odd ICC profile embedded within it. If it's not just ImageSharp causing the issue then I'm inclined to say it'll be unsupported on most libraries. That said we have no ICC profile embedding at all. It's on my TODO list. \nSee #74 . @vinhhrv \nWe now have ICC preservation within our codebase but the output will still be incorrect as there is a conversion from CMYK to RGB taking place within the decoding process. (This is the same as libjpeg) \nWe do have a work-in-progress PR in place which will allow us to use the embedded ICC profile to perform a more accurate color conversion. #273 \nOnce that's in we should be able to replicate the Windows decoder which is the only one that performs the conversion correctly.. Thanks for raising all these points @antonfirsov . I've commented below.\n1. Already discussed, having consensus:\n\nParall.For()\n\nBenchmark, and define best practices based on benchmark results\nApply the best practices (Remove Parallel.For-s, change granularity, etc.)\n\n\nAgree on both. I want the library to gain as much as possible from being used in parallel. These benchmarks leave us wanting.\n\nCommon Vector4 pixel type\n\nImplement with bulk operations (Specially the To/From Vector4 conversions ;)\n\n\nLooking forward to adding this. We need to decide on the range for the properties though. Ideally for maximum performance we wouldn't scale and only clamp when using ToBytes but I'm assuming most consumers would expect any vectorized properties to range from 0-1. Maybe we can default to not scaling but add  PackFromVector4(Vector4 vector) and ToNormalizedVector4()?\n\nResize performance\n\nUse ToVector4() bulk conversion\nApply data-oriented microoptimizations\nReduce resampler window sizes (I suppose most of the values in horizontalValues are near to zero) \nThis point was not part of my experiment, we can expect further speedup from this.\n\n\nAgree on your first two points but not convinced by the latter. Close to zero won't cut it for many consumers, trust me, they'll spot any difference from other libraries. Resampling accuracy has to be absolutely spot on and I don't want to sacrifice it for a few milliseconds. \nYour initial benchmarks without our faster Color struct were extremely promising anyway 2x faster as I recall? That's pretty fast!\nJpeg\n\nRemove unnecesary -> byte[] conversions in Jpeg encoder/decoder, pack pixels from floating point values \nShould perform better with the new Vector4 common pixel type\nDecoder: Optimize Huffmann decoding\nEncoder: Refactor Encode***() logic into a JpegScanEncoder type (same pattern as in the decoder)\n\nAgree (If we could speed up the decoder that would be absolutely brilliant. That's our biggest bottleneck at the mo). Had to reread the code for your last point re the Encoder but yeah. If anything just to clean it up a bit more. Speed is pretty good so far.\n2. New, potentially controversial topics\nInternal API\n\nReview PixelArea \nIt's mostly destroyed few lines after it's creation (in the same method, not passed further as a parameter) \nFeels like it doesn't worth to encapsulate the ComponentOrder, having a switch statement on it\nMost usages could be replaced with ArrayBuffer + BufferPointer + specific bulk call\n..... etc ... feels smelly. Or at least not ready to be public.\nUtilize new Buffer API-s in codecs \n\nMost raw array usage + pooling boilerplate could be replaced with PinnedBuffer-s\n\n\nI'm all for replacing the usage with Buffer API where we can. Two things should be doing the same job.\n\nI'm assuming you mean the switch copying to/from in PixelAccessor<T>. Yeah, I'd rather there was no switch though a switch per row isn't that bad.\nIt definitely shouldn't be public. \n\n\nConvolution processors\n\nKernels matrices are really small, allocating them on the heap is shooting ourselves in the foot\nWe can invent a new \"quasi-dynamic\" value type matrix struct instead\n\n\nWe could.... Don't know if it's all that worth it though. We only initialise these arrays once. Plus the Gaussian kernel can be any size.\n\nOctreeQuantizer\n\nBenchmark octree PNG encoder vs. palette PNG encoder on a large image (I suppose Octree is really slow now)\nReview algorithmic complexity \nHow does the tree look like when built from large images? \nDoes insertion perform in O(1)?\nData-oriented optimization: Allocate OctreeNode-s as structs in a continous memory area\n\n\nDon't compare Octree vs Palette. The output quality difference between the two is massive. Octree gives the best output quality/perf combo; see this article for a summary of different approaches. I've already reduced memory consumption dramatically. \nAlso don't compare our encoding speed with System.Drawing as the output quality is also massive. Dunno what the approach in System.Drawing is but it's absolutely terrible, worse than our palette quantizer. I'd like to see our encoder get closer though. I'd like to see the decoder speed up however. At the mo it's over 2x slower. Same with Gif. \nComplexity is unknown at the moment. I had to extend the original algorithm to allow for multiple alpha values to properly support indexed png's I would be interested in experimenting with any memory optimizations though.\n. @antonfirsov Apologies for the slow reply on this, there's a lot to digest. \nOctree\nRegarding the Octree Quantizer with a complexity of O(n*n)? There's already a maximum depth of 8 for each level. An Octree is initialized with that limit so I don't understand how you would reduce that maximum value and continue to utilize that algorithm. \nI do see though how we can improve on the memory layout of nodes though by turning them into structs so I encourage that improvement.\nI've knocked up a proper benchmark comparing all our Quantization algorithms (Palette, Octree, Wu) by encoding an indexed Png with quality set to 256. The original benchmark we had comparing to System.Drawing didn't ask the right questions as System.Drawing cannot save indexed Png's and therefore would never use any quantization. \nMethod | LargeImage |        Mean |    StdErr |     StdDev |      Median | Scaled | Scaled-StdDev |    Gen 0 |    Gen 1 |    Gen 2 | Allocated |\n---------------------------------- |----------- |------------ |---------- |----------- |------------ |------- |-------------- |--------- |--------- |--------- |---------- |\n'ImageSharp Octree Png' |      False | 353.8687 ms | 3.1196 ms | 12.0823 ms | 352.1816 ms |   1.00 |          0.00 | 800.0000 | 583.3333 | 237.5000 |   9.16 MB |\n'ImageSharp Octree NoDither Png' |      False |  76.2996 ms | 0.7592 ms |  6.7054 ms |  78.5256 ms |   0.22 |          0.02 | 412.7907 | 225.2907 |        - |   3.08 MB |\n'ImageSharp Palette Png' |      False | 434.3553 ms | 4.4461 ms | 37.4638 ms | 423.4140 ms |   1.23 |          0.11 | 425.5952 | 288.6905 | 232.1429 |   6.85 MB |\n'ImageSharp Palette NoDither Png' |      False |  86.8364 ms | 1.1569 ms | 11.5107 ms |  86.4912 ms |   0.25 |          0.03 | 417.5000 | 292.5000 | 230.0000 |   1.99 MB |\n'ImageSharp Wu Png' |      False | 144.5337 ms | 1.4385 ms | 13.8720 ms | 142.1108 ms |   0.41 |          0.04 |        - |        - |        - | 872.71 kB |\nAs you can see it's the dithering algorithm that dramatically slows the implementation down. Dithering is slow though as we touch multiple pixels on each pixel.\nOctree without dither is actually the fastest of our algorithms. \nI have noticed an implementation issue though in the Octree quantizer, we're using euclidean distance to look up the palette when dithering instead of the Octree QuantizePixel method. That's wrong and gives us the wrong result so it should be switched out. There's should be a simple optimization we can make to check against the previous pixel to speed up the second pass and reduce lookups. That will be a quick win.\nI'd like to get to grips with all that GC collection also.  \nResizing\nI'm still not convinced we can use a smaller weight map when resampling. Each item within the map is a required index and doing different seems to go against information and code samples I have read.\nhttp://entropymine.com/imageworsener/resample/ \nWe're already scaling our maps correctly only performing that calculation once.  \nI'd like to see the bulk operation resizing algorithm in action to see the speedup there before we even consider touching weighted maps. Our unpacked Color struct should also be a major priority. \nConvolution\nWhat kind of struct do you have in mind for that? We are already using the custom Fast2dArray<T> struct for those operations. \nDOD etc\nYes, but let's not be too hard on ourselves. The library isn't slow. \nAPI changes\nWell it's a good thing we've had almost a 2 year alpha then isn't it \ud83d\ude04 I'm all for making all but our desired endpoints internal except for the IImageProcessor implementation classes. They should be protected as they can be used for combining imaging effects see the EntropyCropProcessor for example.\n. OK, ok, you've got me.....\nLet's\nA. Internalize absolutely everything we don't need and only publicize objects on demand. \nB. Get issues opened for various discussion points.\nI can take on A if you like. Easy win. \nP.S I'm really enjoying these discussions. I think it brings out the best in all of us \ud83e\udd47 \n. I think we can make some pretty major improvements with some of the changes. We might never beat PresentationCore (That's really fast) but I think we can get a lot closer. \nI'm hoping that we can attract some of the major performance players that got stuck into Asp.Net Core. I think many are put of though as they expect a requirement to understand the image processing algorithms. . See #137 For part A. I'm off to bed now.. Thanks @jackmott I didn't actually know about the improvements in that regard. \nDefinitely worth taking the time to experiment with the processors to see what we come up with.. @jackmott @antonfirsov \nIs there a known theory we can work from for determining these partition ranges or is it a case of identifying ranges based on struct sizes etc and experimenting via benchmarking? . I don't know. You haven't supplied a version number, dimensions, colorspace info, whether it's baseline or progressive, nor the image itself. . @TechnikEmpire Sorry if I came across as condescending, it's been a rough couple of weeks and I'm not great at online conversation at times. I'm glad you found the solution and I hope the hardware will not be too expensive to replace. \nYour assistance at any time would be, of course, most welcome. . Oh... I was gonna kill that branch as it's based on the RC and the includes weren't quite right. I've already started redoing the project and have stylcop etc working perfectly so far. . Ok... I'll have a look through everything. Cheers! . Just pushed a change to the stylecop.json include which should fix your issue. \nI'm wondering, why wouldn't we have all the drawing code in the drawing project? Brushes, Pens, etc in the core don't make sense to me.. We also shouldn't need the package references to buffers, vectors etc in the drawing package since we consume them via core. . OK. I'll give it a pop tonight; AdditionalFiles is the correct include method. Just pushed another change to drawing to remove the package references. If you have the chance to move that code please do. . @tocsoft Looks like we're not alone re the copyright header issue. https://github.com/DotNetAnalyzers/StyleCopAnalyzers/issues/2310. I think we're almost there. C#7 specific things can be performed after the merge. . Great stuff! I'm super happy that we've pulled this off. Thanks for figuring out the tricky bits @tocsoft \nRegarding IDE stability, That'll come both Microsoft and Jetbrains are working hard on it. \nI'll merge this at lunch. \ud83d\ude04 . Thanks for the detail @niksan321 and for the extra info @blackcity \ud83d\udc4d \n@dlemstra tagging you here as this will affect Magick.Net also. Easy one this. I'll merge it now. . >What about non-C#7 users? Will they be able to consume indexers on PixelAccessor?\nAs far as I understand they can yes, they just get the value-type as normal. I think... \n\nI also want to work on the resize code soon. I want to replace the first-pass pixelaccessor with a PinnedBuffer of Vector4-s here!\n\nAbsolutely, I've not started on the work and want to ensure we have designed benchmarks etc before any implementation. Let's do resize first.. You've given me the fear now. Sound's like we'd have to make the indexer internal and use public get/set methods. . The more I think about this the more I don't like it. There's places we can use ref local but not here.. @antonfirsov Oh yeah?! Where is it. @ZhiqiangTao Soooooooo........ @antonfirsov I managed to refactor that method.

Great work @tocsoft ! \ud83d\udcaf . Thanks for working on this. It's great improvement. \ud83d\udcaf . Is anyone else concerned about the sheer amount of GC in the benchmarks? I haven't done any investigation at all but the numbers seem very high to me. . It's sooooo good finally having the tooling to profile properly again. \ud83d\ude04 . I'll have a wee go just in case.  Scratch that, didn't read your comment properly. Let's merge this! :shipit: . @antonfirsov I think we should try and make this a priority now if we're gonna get it in for V1. . @antonfirsov Have a look and estimate it then. Looking at it myself I'm envisaging quite a lot of API changes to allow it which makes me think maybe it's for V2 instead.. @tocsoft I'll do a review of this asap. I'm reading up on chromatic adaption just now so I can write unit tests.. I'm happy to have this merged now. . @JBildstein I think merging in your BitConverter changes might have broken the ICC reader tests. Could you possibly have a look once you have a moment.. No worries :smile: Thanks for fixing it so quickly! . @JBildstein I think we're in a place now where we can actually start to do some conversion within jpeg. Any idea where to start? . @JBildstein Ok, so jpeg now loads and stores the profile now. We need to now wire up the conversion code. I think I have everything we need there but could really do with your input when you have a moment.. @JBildstein I'm able to read and write the ICC profile data from most of our images now. \nThere is a CMYK image in the test solution though that throws an error when trying to parse/write the entries in it's 29 ICC profile markers. I've written the wrapping reading/writing code correctly, something is going wroing in either ICCDataReader or ICCDataWriter. Stack trace on that error. Happens with our YCCK and CMYK image.

You're missing something. \ud83d\ude09 \n\nImage.Load(stream);\nImage<TColor>.Load(stream);\nhttps://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/blob/cfca14aab55880f26a1fc6dfefdda253900afe86/src/ImageSharp/Image.FromStream.cs#L27\nhttps://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/blob/cfca14aab55880f26a1fc6dfefdda253900afe86/src/ImageSharp/Image.FromStream.cs#L117. Looks like this is fixed as of 1.0.0-alpha5-00036 so closing.. Bowing down to your experience here but I'm assuming that's what most other libraries do by default?. Cool. I'm good with that then \ud83d\udc4d . Hi @kensan73, \nThe discussion group - Gitter is actually mentioned in the main repo readme and in the contribution guidelines that would have popped up when you created the issue. I'll try and make it a bit more obvious for future readers. \nLet's move the conversation to there to start with and see what we can do. \nCheers \nJames. We can certainly make our pool configurable but we have to look at a use case issue here also. \nUsing 1GB ram for any serious image processing is simply a no-go. You'll run out of contiguous memory in the LOH pretty quickly if you work with multiple images. We're pooling yes but the pool is smart and will not grossly over-deliver on array requests. Making the pool more configurable will still lead to very similar memory consumption as it will end up allocating a new array anyway. \nI would like to double check our codebase though to ensure we're not missing something in Jpeg. I'm sure we're good but maybe we can make it leaner than it is. . @antonfirsov \nThe issue could be here. We're copying the block since it's a struct then not returning the block back to the pool by disposing of it.\nhttps://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/blob/be363c9a279385bef846fd042a7a70885b8f8431/src/ImageSharp/Formats/Jpeg/Components/Decoder/JpegBlockProcessor.cs#L50. @antonfirsov, @BrianJThomson @DeCarabas  This is a worrying predicament and one of many reasons why I hate the way Jpeg's have been dealt with in the past. In a perfect world there would be no history of broken images and we wouldn't have to hack our code to support them.\nA switch, I think would be a sticking plaster at best and I don't think that should be target outcome. I appreciate the difficulty here though and the work you've done so far @antonfirsov is extraordinary.\nLet's try to spread awareness off this issue before anyone makes a start on anything. If we are lucky we might catch the eye of someone who has had to deal with this before. It might even just need a fresh pair of eyes.\nI'll share it on Twitter now.. @antonfirsov Agreed. I also think the enum proposed by @tocsoft would be a good fit. Simple yet obvious in intent.\nI never thought people would attempt to use the libraries for multi-megapixel images with the expectation that we would be constrained by limitations similar to that of System.Drawing so it's an intriguing prospect to be able to do so. \nAs such I'm looking for someone with experience with memory mapped files to step up and help out allowing these changes cough @blackcity. I see from the comments they are NetStandard 1.3+ - Should we perhaps make that our target now to reduce #if directives?\nJpeg is a very tough spec and admittedly the maths are beyond me for the most part of it and the changes would be a huge amount of work for @antonfirsov to do alone so if we can get some community help to add optimizations at any level that really would be appreciated. . Can you show how you ar using the library? There should be nothing that doesn't either get returned or handled by GC. . Nothing wrong with the code as long as you clean up that outstream instance. \nI know of no memory leaks within the library and I've tested it a lot to ensure that. Are you running in 32 or 64 bit mode?. \ud83d\udc4d Bravo. This looks very comprehensive. Agree on the naming change. \nQuick Q on this comment. I'm assuming it has to do with .NET Core 2.0 making Span<T> available or the BufferPool?\n\nTo make MemoryManager extensible by users, we will need the new standard corefx (and maybe even corefxlab!) libraries.\ncorefx Sytem.Memory will be released with .NET Core 2.0. I'm gonna use it being nearly 1am here as an excuse for missing that! \ud83d\ude16 . Beta 1 contained the relevant changes, beta 2 builds on those changes. :shipit: . @tocsoft I get your point but I'd rather keep them in for now just to make the class BitConverter API complete. \n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/src/mscorlib/src/System/BitConverter.cs. 2X speedup plus much cleaner code. I'm happy to merge this unless someone spots something I've missed?. I'd like to do a proper test against the supplied image comparing multiple decoders to see what the result is. There may be more variance than we think. . @sgjsakura @antonfirsov There's something more to this. \nI've been doing some experimenting in LinqPad with the following methods: An equivalent of our shifting method and a known, accurate formula.\nGiven an input YCbCr with the following values. \nbyte Y = 243;\nbyte Cb = 117;\nbyte Cr = 133;\nWe get the following results:\n\nShifting rgb (250, 243, 224)\nAccurate rgb(250, 244, 223)\n\nAs you can see, our method is slightly inaccurate but nowhere near the level of inaccuracy that the later pixel value is. This means we must be somehow introducing error elsewhere.\n``` csharp\npublic void ToRGBShift(byte y, byte cb, byte cr)\n{\n    int ccb = cb - 128;\n    int ccr = cr - 128;\n// Speed up the algorithm by removing floating point calculation\n// Scale by 65536, add .5F and truncate value. We use bit shifting to divide the result\nint r0 = (int)((1.402F * 65536) + .5F) * ccr; // (1.402F * 65536) + .5F\nint g0 = (int)((0.344136F * 65536) + .5F) * ccb; // (0.344136F * 65536) + .5F\nint g1 = (int)((0.714136F * 65536) + .5F) * ccr; // (0.714136F  * 65536) + .5F\nint b0 = (int)((1.772F * 65536) + .5F) * ccb; // (1.772F * 65536) + .5F\n\nbyte r = (byte)(y + (r0 >> 16)).Clamp(0, 255);\nbyte g = (byte)(y - (g0 >> 16) - (g1 >> 16)).Clamp(0, 255);\nbyte b = (byte)(y + (b0 >> 16)).Clamp(0, 255);\n\nColor.FromArgb(255, r, g, b).Dump();\n\n}\npublic void ToRGB(byte y, byte bcb, byte bcr)\n{\n    double cb = bcb - 128;\n    double cr = bcr - 128;\nbyte r = (byte)(Math.Round(y + (1.402 * cr), MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero).Clamp(0, 255));\nbyte g = (byte)(Math.Round(y - (0.344136 * cb) - (0.714136 * cr), MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero).Clamp(0, 255));\nbyte b = (byte)(Math.Round(y + (1.772 * cb), MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero)).Clamp(0, 255);\n\nColor.FromArgb(255, r, g, b).Dump();\n\n}\n```\n. >So I would like to know how Photoshop and MS Paint do to decode the pixels\nWouldn't we all! \ud83d\ude04 \nThe maths are pretty simple all in all, we just need to find a better middle ground between speed and accuracy than we have just now. . @antonfirsov Don't let this stress you out my friend. We have plenty of time and I'm sure more people will join in to help out. :smile: . ### Update:\nI've just pushed code that makes our color conversion code the same as libjpeg and ran some tests decoding the image and saving it as a bmp. \nI'm still getting differences and the color conversion code is now not a contributing factor. I tested this by running both our fast and a high-precision version of the conversion code against the image.\nI'm wondering whether it has something to do with our float/byte conversion when doing our DCT transform?\n@antonfirsov I think I might be onto something with the float/byte conversion. Upping this to 127.5F get's us closer. . I'm gonna close this. Our testing shows a massive improvement. Great minds think alike. \ud83d\ude04 \nYeah, Out of scope for this PR but let's definite refactor that soon. . Updated link for GitHub repo. \nhttps://github.com/PsdPlugin/PsdPlugin\nWhile this is most certainly something for the future. We should actually have a look at our API now to ensure that we can implement layering in a sane way that works with our existing codecs. \nCC/ @tocsoft @antonfirsov @dlemstra . @vinhhrv @HelmuthWcs \nThe causes that throw that exception are different in both images. \nThe first image is actually correct and highlight a bug in the decoder.\nThe seconds image however is buggy and will require a workaround. Here's the output from JpegSnoop\n```\n Decoding SCAN Data \n  OFFSET: 0x0000D03B\n  Scan Decode Mode: Full IDCT (AC + DC)\nScan Data encountered marker   0xFFD9 @ 0x00785631.0\n ERROR: Can't find huffman bitstring @ 0x0078562F.1, table 1, value [0xffffb200]\n ERROR: Bad huffman code @ 0x0078562F.0\n*** ERROR: Bad scan data in MCU(449,224): Chr(Cr) CSS(0,0) @ Offset 0x0078562F.1\n           MCU located at pixel=(7184,3584)\n```. Fantastic @piamancini Thanks for that! \ud83d\udc4d . Hi @mhamri \nCan you please update to the most recent version 1.0.0-alpha5-00047and let me know what the output is like?\nUpdate, I tested it myself and this is the output of an indexed png.\n\nNote. I had to upload a screenshot of the image as Github was corrupting the upload.\nScratch that, the image definitely has transparent areas which is a bug.\nThe image you have uploaded which you say is from tinypng is a jpeg?\nCheers\nJames. @mhamri You should be able to update your version now and get the correct output.. Weird... Working on this just now. I can see the problem just not sure how to avoid it. \nSee #163 . Should be fixed now. . \n. I'm gonna merge this now. We need to have a good look through png for performance boosters at some point though, I think it's a prime candidate for our buffer slicing tools.. Is this a fix for #132 ? Awesome and thank you! I'll look at it asap.. Great stuff! Thanks for taking the time to submit a fix.. @dlemstra As soon as you're happy with this could you do the merge please. You're the boss of this part. . Hi @SebastianStehle \nThere's nothing wrong with what you're doing. It seems that the way we quantize the image to reduce the color palette when encoding that image (It's an indexed png with 183 entries in the alpha palette table) can't seem to handle the distribution of alpha values. \nIt's frustrating to discover this as I thought we had png pretty much 100% correct. I'v been experimenting for a couple of hours now to no avail.\nCheers\nJames. Oh wow @SebastianStehle you're the reason I thought this library was possible. If it hadn't been for your prior work I would never have dreamed of attempting it. Thank you! \ud83d\udc4d \nBack to the issue... @tocsoft Our encoder actually supports more than one transparent index, it's just that when the transparent threshold is set to the default of 0  we only add values that fall below that threshold. \nI believe we might actually be doing something wrong when both capturing and encoding transparent values in indexed png's . I'll need to have a look at the spec again and probably the source for libpng also. If either of you feel like investigating the issue in the interim though please do. . Hey @a-jahanshahlo don't hijack old issues like this. Your issue is completely unrelated.\nI also cannot replicate your issue. Here's the output of beta5 on my machine.\n\n. Questions on Gitter please. . On your observations @tocsoft \n\nObservations\nApplying this fix makes me notice 2 things;\n\nThe OctreeQuantizer seems to introduce some odd difference in the alpha values of the indexed\npixels.\nThe OctreeQuantizer will produce compound errors between encodings even if the the number of different colors in the image is already below the threshold. i.e. encode indexed, decode, and with no changes encode as indexed again does not produce exactly the same pixel data.\n\n\nThe Octree isn't a true Octree, rather a hacky attempt to allow full range alpha. It almost works but as you say some of the alpha differences are odd. This is probably due to the way I am applying the mask to provide a pixel index. (I need it to be less than 8).\nhttps://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/blob/13a4a2613feef13c473a3f2688febb539c3c4902/src/ImageSharp/Quantizers/Octree/OctreeQuantizer.cs#L457\n```\nprivate static readonly int[] Mask = { 0x100, 0x80, 0x40, 0x20, 0x10, 0x08, 0x04, 0x02, 0x01 };\nint index = ((buffer[3] & Mask[0]) >> (shift - 3)) |\n            ((buffer[2] & Mask[level + 1]) >> (shift - 2)) |\n            ((buffer[1] & Mask[level + 1]) >> (shift - 1)) |\n            ((buffer[0] & Mask[level + 1]) >> shift);\n```\nThe original code would have been.\n```\nprivate static readonly int[] Mask = { 0x80, 0x40, 0x20, 0x10, 0x08, 0x04, 0x02, 0x01 };\nint index = ((buffer[2] & Mask[level + 1]) >> (shift - 2)) |\n            ((buffer[1] & Mask[level + 1]) >> (shift - 1)) |\n            ((buffer[0] & Mask[level + 1]) >> shift);\n``\nI had a quick go just then at altering the allowable max depth to be 15 and using the correct((buffer[3] & Mask[level + 1]) >> (shift - 3))` (essentially producing what seems to be called a hextree) which almost worked but there's something amiss with white pixels causing them to become transparent. \nI'm not sure whether that is of any use though to be honest as memory usage will shoot up and speed down.\nI had a play around using the Wu Quantizer with your changes and the output was excellent even without dithering. We could match the quality of the image from issue #170 yet produce smaller output than tinypng. I might have another go at producing dithering in that quantizer.\nIf that succeeds I'll probably return the Octree to it's original state which serves Gif well and would boost performance there. We'll then make Wu the default for png and carefully comment both explaining the difference in transparency ranges.\nEither way, decoding and encoding an indexed png will not produce identical output unless we followed the quantization method exactly used on the original image.\nWhat do you think?\n. We'd have to store the palette and somehow keep track of the operations performed on the image to determine whether there were changes to the color palette. I'm not sure that would be possible. \nPersonally I'd expect slight differences with indexed png since they are lossy by nature.\nBTW - Here's the original and output from the Wu Quantizer. The difference is minimal really considering we saved .65kb\n\n\n. Ah right.. so count unique colors then make no attempt to reduce the palette if it's smaller. We'd probably have to set a size limit on that calculation if we were to do it so not to slow things down too much...\nOn the difference in opacity... \u00af_(\u30c4)_/\u00af . We get absolutely fantastic quality from the WuQuantizer now. Here's us vs pngquant\nOriginal 73.8kb\n\nImageSharp 21.8kb\n\npngquant 22.8kb\n\n. Hi @oscarld \nWhat you need to do is set the PngColorType to PngColorType.Palette\nc#\nusing (var image = Image.Load(inputStream))\n{\n   image.SaveAsPng(cachedStream, new PngEncoder\n   {\n      PngColorType = PngColorType.Palette\n   });\n}\nAn explanation:\nIn your first code example you have a slightly smaller than the original because you are reducing the number of colors in the image. There is only a slight decrease as you are still saving the image using a 32bit RGBA pixel format.\nIn your second example Your image is larger because the original must have been previous optimized for web and the quantizer is not actually being used in the encoding process because, again, you are still saving the image using a 32bit RGBA pixel format. (Our encoder outputs smaller images than System.Drawing but cannot match a dedicated optimizer due to time constraints)\nHere's the output of the image where the PngEncoder has been passed the PngColorType option. As you can see it is much smaller at 457,910 bytes\n\nHowever, I would try to consider not using png as a format for saving photographs when possible unless you specifically require alpha transparency since you will never achieve good compression. Rather you should a codec designed specifically for photographs like jpeg.\nHere's your image saved as a jpeg at 85% Quality.\n\nThat wipes the floor with png producing a high quality image at only 189,010 bytes.\nHope that makes sense\nIf you have any more questions, don't hesitate to visit our Gitter channel so we can help there.\nCheers\nJames\n. Hi @andrecarlucci,\nTheoretically yes. \nHere's a collection of all the pixel formats we support out of the box. It's the same as XNA and MonoGame covering the multitude of types used by graphics cards in gaming. \nAdding your own type would be a case of implementing the IPixel interface. \nImage<TColor> itself supports creating instances without decoding an image format so you would be able to new up an instance and map your byte array to the image TColor[]\nThis might all be a bit clunky to use though so I would be very interested in seeing your use case to ensure that our API exposes enough useful public methods to allow raw pixel manipulation from byte streams. Our emphasis so far has most definitely been on decoding/encoding from image formats. \nCheers\nJames\nP.S We normally use Gitter for questions rather than the issue tracker.. @antonfirsov That's all cool. \ud83d\ude0e \n\nRgba32 and Color are actually different in that Rgba32 implements IPackedVector and has the PackedValue property. I created it for interoperability with MonoGame should anyone ever want to use it.\nColorVector feels clumsy name-wise to me also but I wanted something that differentiated it from the \"Packed\" types. Open to suggestions! \ud83d\ude04 . >Its trivial to make Color implementing IPackedVector, and they will be exactly the same!\n\nIs it? I must be missing something then. If I'm explicitly declaring the struct layout order PackedValue would have to be a field which I can't use as that can't implement an interface, only a property or method can. . ColorVector actually supports the same transforms and static members as Color also differentiating it from the rest. I'll keep mulling it over but merge this for now.. YOU ARE MY HERO! \ud83e\udd47 \nI've been banging my head against this for days. Completely forgot that Matrix4x4 uses the standard equation matrices in a transposed manner. Thanks! . @antonfirsov It's been a steep learning curve but I'm proud of what we are collectively achieving.\n@tocsoft @dlemstra I agree , we should move them. I'll do it in a mo as part of this PR I think ImageSharp.PixelFormats would probably be the best fit name-wise. \nRegarding the use of Color and instructing users. Documentation would be the best bet. I don't think we should introduce obsolete warning since we are still in alpha. (Cannot WAIT for beta status)\nI'll add something to the readme.. Hi @csengineer13 \nThat would be great thanks! \ud83d\ude04 \nI was thinking initially that we could simply refer to the benchmarks from https://github.com/bleroy/core-imaging-playground but that only really covers a resizing scenario so we should definitely create something more comprehensive.\nPerhaps use that as a starting point and create a full benchmarking suite from there?\nIf you create a PR and mark it WIP we can guide as it is written. This seems so work well so far.\n. Nice. Thanks!. Hi @makotech222 \nThanks for providing so much information. We really appreciate it when people fill in the form properly.\nIt took me a while but I managed to replicate your issue and provide a fix. There's some oddities in the way NetStandard 1.6.1 works with references but that should be fixed with NetStandard 2.0.0 \nI've uploaded some test projects I created to demonstrate the issue, created a new alpha to fix it and will describe here what I discovered.\nIn the zip file you will find three separate projects.\n\nTest.ISharp - A NetCore 1.1 console application directly referencing 1.0.0-alpha6-00065. This works with no issues.\nTest.ISharp.Classic461 - A classic .Net 4.6.1 console application directly referencing 1.0.0-alpha6-00065. This works with no issues.\nTest.ISharp.Multiple A NetStandard 1.3 class library referencing 1.0.0-alpha6-00066 with two consuming console projects. The first NetCore 1.1 the second .Net 4.6.1. Everything built correctly but at runtime errors were thrown. This was where the fun started!\n\nWhen testing Test.ISharp.Multiple against 1.0.0-alpha6-00065 the NetCore project worked first time without any problems. \nThe .NET 4.6.1 project however first complained that it could not find the ImageSharp binary. I had to directly reference it in both the class library and consuming console application.\nRerunning the application then threw your error. I fixed this by adding a direct reference to System.IO.Compression v4.3.0 to ImageSharp. If you update your reference to 1.0.0-alpha6-00066 everthing should now JustWork\u2122\nLet me know if you have any further issues.\nCheers\nJames\nImageSharp.Tests.zip\n. I don't think that's related to us. We've already added Vectors as a dependency. Did you add ImageSharp as a dependency to the console app also?\nSounds like an assembly redirect issue.. See my comment above.\n\nThe .NET 4.6.1 project however first complained that it could not find the ImageSharp binary. I had to directly reference it in both the class library and consuming console application.\n\nIt seems to be a quirk with the current build system/standard combination. NetStandard 2.0.0 should fix this.\nYour new issue is due to https://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/commit/cf62f7725dfff87a2c5468c1e3f94243d9e6adde\nYou'll need to get the latest in all projects, clean, then build again.\nColor is now the more accurately named Rgba32 (We're making sure we are inline with CoreClr naming conventions).. No worries as all. :smile:. I'm closing this. As @blackcity correctly states, it's not our responsibility to handle network streams. \nNo other graphics library would be expected to either. \nWe only copy to a MemoryStream if the given stream is not seekable so I wouldn't be inclined to make this async internally. Nothing to stop calling code from being async though. . Hi @chausner\n\nI am not sure if any changes have been made since I reported this issue but last time I checked, ImageSharp would not recognize invalid, truncated images, for example, due to exactly that issue.\n\nI'm afraid you thought exactly wrong. ImageSharp failed to read some images incorrectly because it was failing to recover from invalid data or missing data within poorly encoded or corrupt images. I actually fixed an issue within the png decoder to better handle that yesterday. We've also done work elsewhere to ensure that we respect hitting the ends of streams correctly.  Everything else is safely behind our decoder sanitation code.\nI don't know what experience you have had writing image decoders but they all work to the same pattern of identifying specific markers within the image and processing those markers. All but a few issues are due to mistakes made in other encoders. \nWe can now successfully decode many corrupt images and include them in our test suite.\n\nThe idea of the abstract Stream class is to allow APIs to support reading from arbitrary types of data sources, whether the data comes from a file, memory or the network.\n\nI know what they are for. We handle both file and memory streams. We do not handle chunked network streams and require that stream to be completely populated before passing the the image. That's perfectly reasonable in my opinion.\n\nInstead of internally copying non-seekable streams to a MemoryStream, why not simply throw an exception when CanSeek is false?\n\nBecause it makes life a lot easier for me. It's very rare that someone will pass a non-seekable stream to the library but when they do it's much quicker and easier for me to simply transparently handle that situation than to walk someone through why their code is failing. It's almost always someone with very limited experience that would require an entire course on streams before they'd understand what was happening. \nHope that clarifies things\nCheers\nJames. Fantastic work. Really appreciated! \ud83d\udcaf . Q: If I wanted to fix my arrays, how would I then access them quickly in my Pack method without using fixed wrapper which is slow?. I am 99% there with making the changes, I can't figure out how to get a reference to my fixed YCbCrToRgbTables* table to pass to the method.\nWorking in managed code all my career really has left me with knowledge gaps!\nI can fix the arrays etc but since I'm operating in an anonymous lambda with Parallel.For I have to fix for each row. This seems to cost me a few ms. @antonfirsov @tocsoft  Think I've got it now.. @antonfirsov Absolutely! I'm off to bed now so will see what everyone thinks in the morning. \nManaged to shave a few ms off the decoder so happy there. Sub 30ms in the DecodeJpeg benchmark for the first time on my machine. \nWe should compile a jpeg decoder todo list to see if we can attract passing optimizers. If they know what the issues are they will be in a better position to help out.  \nSomething super weird going on with those RgbaVector tests btw. Never fails on my machine. 50% fail rate online.. \n. @RehanSaeed This more a question for our gitter channel but I'll attempt to answer.\nOutput size is something we care deeply about and has been a major focus alongside performance. It's not something I would like to spend a great deal of time benchmarking or reporting on though as there's no easy way to report the data. \nI'll summarize what we do know now though.\n\nBitmap - There will be no difference since it's an uncompressed format. \nJpeg - There's simply too many variables. resampling algorithms, color accuracy. They all contribute to the image size so sometimes we win, sometimes System.Drawing wins.\nGif - System.Drawing produces such poor output that such a comparison is meaningless.  We however can produce incredibly detailed 256 color output (see the Calliphora fly below) and support animated gifs\nPng - We use a smarter heuristic algorithm than System.Drawing and will always produce smaller output (~10-15%). We also support smaller indexed pngs and are able to produce images that match the quality, yet beat the size of PngQuant\n\nAll in all I believe we do much better than System.Drawing in both quality and size of our image output. \nWe cannot, however, compete with a dedicated set of tools like ImageMin. ImageMin uses a multitude of different tools that use various techniques (some brute force) to optimize images, none of which can be ran in a particularly performant manner.\nHope that helps\nJames\nOur gif output\n\n. @RehanSaeed Happy to help! \ud83d\ude04 \nYeah, the ImageMin toolset is a great target to aim for. It'll be interesting to see what we can achieve in the future.. @lzcd My money is a tooling thing. Is it ImageSharp or ImageSharp.Drawing?\nI've been trying to find an old issue in the repo where I walked through testing install on different environments but for some reason I can't. \nI'll have a dig around. It might well be that we have to explicitly include packages we are not.. @Drawaes When you have some time could you possibly have a look at this?\nI've been trying to debug the issue for a couple of hours now to no avail. \nFrom what I can see the crc reading that is taking place within ZlibInflateStream is causing the private currentDataRemaining field in DeframeStream to be negative -4. Then, and I'm not sure how it's getting called, DeframeStream.Read(byte[] buffer, int offset, int count) is called which throws our error.\nI'm a wee bit stumped.. Wizzzzzzaaaard!. @srudenko This is now fixed with #196 Should be good to go \ud83d\ude04 . Here's a list of additional issues related to jpeg that we would like to get help with.\nhttps://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aarea%3Aformats%3Ajpeg. Should be possible with an ImageBrush. @tocsoft Wanna knock up an example?\nP.s @agoretsky please use the Gitter channel for questions. This tracker is for issues, hence the template. Thanks!. I'm gonna add the other fixes to this PR so don't merge yet.\n. Merging this. I've performed a visual test on all the processors and all is good.  . All good now. Merging, Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . I should be able to identify most of these pretty quickly. I'd much rather remove the new target when it's not needed than do the check, much less allocations.. Done with #195\nI want to sort out our tests now though. Our tests approach for testing the filters is inconsistent. . Hi @Sniger87 \nThe readme specifically states VS2017 as a minimum requirement so you really have to use that. As @vpenades correctly states (thanks for that btw \ud83d\udc4d ) don't use 32bit. MS don't support SIMD yet on 32bit platforms but will do when they switch out the jitter as part of the NetStandard 2.0.0 release in a couple of months. So until then performance will be pretty poor. \nHopefully all this is possible for you and makes sense.\nCheers\nJames. No worries \ud83d\ude04 . It's cos we're so cutting edge \ud83d\ude04 . Oh wow, that's nasty! Will have a look asap. . Just waiting on a PR review for this one.. Thanks @vpenades but before we go any further I have a few questions. \n\nWhat is wrong with the original equations and if there is something why not fix them? \nWhere are the corresponding unit tests? My original equations match the results from the W3C specification. \nWhat is the performance of your methods, have you benchmarked them?. I have a feeling invoking the function per pixel will be slow. \n\nCheers\nJames\nP.S Absolutely love the flexibility of the design here. just concerned about the performance implication of passing a Func around as a parameter. . Thanks for replying @vpenades \n\nWhen I needed to do that I also tried the standard W3C formulas, and soon discovered that, of all the formulas, only the AlphaBlend formula does preserve correctly the alpha value. All others, Multiply, Add, Overlay, etc... only work correctly if the target image is completely opaque.\n\nSo does your output produce identical results to Photoshop? I find it odd that the spec here would be incorrect. They describe the correct behavior as the following.\n\nThe result of the mixing function is modulated by the backdrop alpha. A fully opaque backdrop allows the mixing function to be fully realized. A transparent backdrop will cause the final result to be a weighted average between the source color and mixed color with the weight controlled by the backdrop alpha. The value of the new color becomes:\n\nNow I'm not 100% convinced that my work was correct (I am truly terrible at maths) but we should still align with a specification so that results can be compared with that specification. \nRegarding unit tests. Stick them in with all the other color tests in the tests project. I plan to refactor that project soon. \nI'd love to see something working based on your PR, the idea of library-wide composition functionality is truly exciting! \ud83d\ude04 . In that case we could probably do a quick check against the background alpha and choose a path as to which method to use. It might be the case though that the difference is negligible and we can just always use yours (if the results are the same for fully opaque backgrounds). We should benchmark both sets of functions to be sure. . @antonfirsov I would definitely like to avoid enums where possible though the PorterDuff equations are a known set so we should be ok with that here - Same as our Colorblindness methods. That would leave only the enum public.\nI am concerned with performance though so I'm interested in anything we can do to approach this in the best possible manner - One that works well with line drawing also. Happy to do the work here of course now we have the correct equations.\nWith your pattern what actually goes in the BulkApply method in the base class? Each function has it's own distinct equation so there wouldn't be anything as far as I can see to go there.\n. I spotted the pattern but I'm not sure we even need the base class - There's nothing for the functions to inherit. \n. All good. Thanks!. @tocsoft Do we wanna merge this in now or wait for any T4 stuff? I say now if internal and optimize in beta.. \n. Hi @Daniel15 \nSee http://sixlabors.com/2017/04/08/watermarks/ for information on text measuring.\nWe will get decent documentation out as soon as we can to make finding info easier. We're just utterly swamped now getting the library in shape to launch the first beta.\nHope the example all makes sense.\nCheers\nJames. That's great to hear!\nWe're building docs using Wyam in our feature/docs branch - You can build them locally using the instructions found here\nhttps://wyam.io/docs/usage/command-line\nThe one's in the repo just now are completely unfinished and will change quite dramatically; The API docs do generate though. I'm actually, this second, working on them. . Imma gonna merge this. It all works and any changes can be made internally. . We've been using these classes to read formats we know to be stored either big or little endian format. How does this affect that?. I'll check the physical output of the decode/encode tests to be sure. . Ok coke. Thanks!. \ud83d\ude04 Yeah true but hey still clunky! Generics all the way baby!. Yeah, you're right. That would better reflect existing types like Enumerable also.. Thanks! @dlemstra . Almost finished making the other changes but the last one would require me to create an overload for every overload of Load. Even saying it sounds crazy. Devs should use the generic method. \nI'm going with Image.Load<TPixel> since that matches existing patterns.. @dlemstra ok coke. Only cos you're awesome \ud83d\ude04 . OK. So adding the Rgba32 overloads for all the Load methods was less work than I thought.\nRgba32 can use either Image.Load()or Image.Load<Rgba32>()\nAll other pixel formats would use Image.Load<TPixel>()\nI think we're good to go now.. Thanks for finishing this up guys, was way past my bedtime! . I'll merge it now. Thanks @FireNero really appreciate your help! \ud83d\udc4d . Does this change for Mono 5 I wonder? . I'm fairly certain codecov is utterly bonkers. Some of the files that are reporting as a loss in coverage are completely unrelated. . Maaan that's so much cleaner! I totally forgot about the implicit cast from Buffer to BufferSpan! \ud83d\ude04 \nI think we could get away with DebugGuard, everything else looks sweet!. @dlemstra I moves it cos these classes/structs require a specific knowledge of the code base and are not commonly used. . Great work!. Hi @xeora \nCould you please resubmit this with version numbers etc and the offending image? We've nothing to go on since you deleted the template for some reason.\nCheers\nJames. >I already customize your code a lot to work faster\nWhy would you do this; It's an open source project? If you find issues or have performance related concerns why not create PR's and give back?\nWe still require a test image to triage against.. @xeora \nI assure you I am perfectly calm. There are glaring issue here however. \n\nYou initially raised the ticket with no version number, stacktrace, code sample, nor image. \nYou raised the issue based on a heavily modified codebase that we have no ability, obligation, nor intent to support. \n\nNow you have, to your credit, provide a potential code fix but we have no way to \"deeply investigate\" whether that fix is appropriate since you have not provided us with a broken image to test against. \nWe also do not know what the expected outcome should be. Does System.Drawing successfully open this image? Does MSPaint, Adobe, Libjpeg?\nIf you can provide us with that image we can double check that fix and move forward. Without that we cannot. . >Authorization afaik shouldn't be ImageSharp's concern. You would plug in your authorization middleware before the ImageSharp.Web one and that would be responsible for handling anything authz-wise.\nGreat! I thought/hoped it would be the case. . @clausjensen I've actually started writing some code. Baby steps though. \nhttps://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/tree/e4d3aedb33af44bf8b384fa6a277b31bbfb2a381/src/ImageSharp.Web. @clausjensen  @KLuuKer  I'll set up issues for each item later tonight. \nRe caching, that's what IDistributedCache is for. Want multitenancy, switch to Azure caching or another implementation. . @lfoust \n\nIt would be great if the mapping between the inputs and how they make it to the middleware was configurable so that people can use whatever routing or conventions they want and the image middleware would handle the heavy lifting.\n\nThat feels to me like opening a can of worms. I would stick with a single unified URL Querystring API with identifiers for IImageService implementations using a prefix.\ne.g. http://mysite.com/remote/http://remote-image.jpg?width=200 would resolve to the RemoteImageService since we are using the remote prefix.\nIf an IImageService had an empty prefix e.g. PhysicalFileImageService it would match all image requests containing recognized querystring parameters. Any implementations like this would be a last resort and only called when there are no prefix matching services.\nAll the inputs you mentioned would come from the Querystring API\n\nwidth=200\nheight=100\nquality=75\nformat=png\nxy=20&xy=50 (This is the standard method to pass arrays through qs params, though very verbose)\n\nNote IMO It's better to use more descriptive parameters as we would support more processors as plugins.\nThere are no standards around this as far as I'm aware. \n\nAnother big consideration in the design is making sure the response is property formatted to be consumed by a CDN. It is great to support IDistrubutedCache but ultimately CDNs are the best and most common way to cache images.\n\nExactly. My thought would be that use the file system IDistrubutedCache for smaller sites but if you want scaling you would use an Azure or Amazon based implementations (This is something I would probably build privately and sell licenses for - Gotta earn something from my years or work!). Those caches would be installed on a custom endpoint that the CDN will request if no matching image is found on their system.\n@romain-preston \nEach IImageService should definitely have something like Task<bool> ShouldProcessAsync(HttpContext context) though I think we would have already split the request URL into different parts for processing so would pass them to the method.\nOn Step 5. Each installed processor would accept and parse the querystring NameValueCollection and return a result accordingly. All instruction sets are querystring only. Every CDN I know allows caching by querystring params.\n\nAnother consideration:\nit would be helpfull to design the IImageServices in a chaining fashion\u2026\nWe could then imagine something like :\nAzureStoreImageService => ImageManipulationService\n\nI don't see any benefit in this. Each service is responsible for matching a pattern and returning an image. Chaining would only add overheads and complexity. \n. Have a look at the current codebase. I've defined some of the interfaces and a rough guide in code + comments of the pipeline. I'm gonna need help working out the new HttpContext.Request/Response parts sorted + writing tests, creating a test website etc.\nhttps://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/tree/dotweb/src/ImageSharp.Web. @andrewlock Thanks for having a look. Your feedback is fantastic I really, really appreciate it. \ud83d\udc4d \nSoooo.. I've implemented some changes. \nFirst I stripped out all that IHostingEnvironment parameters. The environment is now passed through DI when I add the services. Much cleaner!\nUsers can implement their own implementations and configure them using the following overload in Startup (Use non-generic for default).\nc#\npublic void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)\n{\n    services.UseImageSharpServices<MyCustomImageSharpConfiguration>();\n}\nSecondly I created something called an IUriParser that looks like this. \nc#\n/// <summary>\n/// Defines a contract for parsing commands from URI's\n/// </summary>\npublic interface IUriParser\n{\n    /// <summary>\n    /// Returns a collection of commands from the current request\n    /// </summary>\n    /// <param name=\"context\">Encapsulates all HTTP-specific information about an individual HTTP request</param>\n    /// <returns>The <see cref=\"IDictionary{TKey,TValue}\"/></returns>\n    IDictionary<string, string> ParseUriCommands(HttpContext context);\n}\nThis allows you to create your own dictionary of commands from the request so if you chose to.  /resize/{width}/{height}/{path} would be a possible. Personally I would always use querystring params though since they're dead easy to parse. \nIt's looking pretty clean and it runs smoothly. \ud83d\ude04 \nThere's still tests,  a couple of built in processors, custom events to add and some 404 handling but I'm very happy with it all now. \nLooking forward to any further feedback.\np.s. Your blog was invaluable today. I learnt an absolute ton about config reading through it.  \ud83c\udf7b \n. @clausjensen The config stuff took me most of the day to set up, BIG learning curve! :neckbeard:  I think other devs should be able to configure it pretty easily in the future though though setting up their own configuration classes which is simple enough. Always open to suggestions though. Great! I'm totally obsessed with this now \ud83d\ude04 . Aha! services.TryAddEnumerable was exactly what I have been looking for! I was trying to go that route but couldn't figure it out. Thanks!\nRe your other comments.\n\nI agree re IImageService I actually thought the very same this morning so have renamed it to IImageResolver\nUsing Func<HttpContext, bool> in IImageWebProcessor is a great idea! Much, much smarter and more flexible.\nI've been considering this but I don't think that's the correct place for it. Ideally we should be breaking much sooner than hitting the resolver. I'll outline an alternative plan below. \n\nI'll add an Action<IDictionary<string,string>> To the ImageSharpMiddlewareOptions class. We'll call it something like OnValidate.\nIn that method developers can read the commands using CommandParser and change them at will if they do not match requirements or could pose a danger.\ne.g Here's what the default implementation would look like. \n``` c#\n/// \n/// Gets or sets the additional validation method used to augment commands.\n/// This is called once the commands have been gathered and before an  has been assigned.\n/// Emptying the dictionary will ensure that the middleware will ignore the request.\n/// \npublic Action> OnValidate { get; set; } = (commands) =>\n{\n    CommandParser parser = CommandParser.Instance;\n    uint width = parser.ParseValue(commands.GetValueOrDefault(ResizeWebProcessor.Width));\n    uint height = parser.ParseValue(commands.GetValueOrDefault(ResizeWebProcessor.Height));\nif (width > 4000 && height > 4000)\n{\n    commands.Remove(ResizeWebProcessor.Width);\n    commands.Remove(ResizeWebProcessor.Height);\n}\n\n};\n```\nThis, in my opinion, is super powerful and allows direct control over everything that comes in very early in the pipeline. What do you think?\nRegarding the PR? It's always great to get them and looking at your code it's a great improvement. I'm a little confused by the TODO: though? Do you think it's possible, or whether they should even be optional? If someone wan't to change the default they can use the other overload no?\n. @andrewlock So I took your idea and ran with it hard! (Thanks for that \ud83d\udc4d )\nYou can now do the following.\n``` c#\n// Add the default service and options.\nservices.AddImageSharp();\n// Or add the default service and custom options.\nservices.AddImageSharp(\n    options =>\n        {\n            options.MaxBrowserCacheDays = 7;\n            options.MaxCacheDays = 365;\n            options.OnValidate = (context, dictionary) => { };\n            options.OnPrepareResponse = context => { };\n        });\n// Or we can fine-grain control adding the default options and configure all other services.\nservices.AddImageSharpCore()\n        .SetCache()\n        .SetUriParser()\n        .AddResolver()\n        .AddProcessor();\n// Or we can fine-grain control adding custom options and configure all other services.\nservices.AddImageSharpCore(\n        options =>\n            {\n                options.MaxBrowserCacheDays = 7;\n                options.MaxCacheDays = 365;\n                options.OnValidate = (context, dictionary) => { };\n                options.OnPrepareResponse = context => { };\n            })\n        .SetCache()\n        .SetUriParser()\n        .AddResolver()\n        .AddProcessor();\n```\nThere are also factory overloads for each builder method that will allow adding services from configuration files.\nI think I've now covered all configuration bases with proper DI. What do you think?. Ah yes, good spot. Thanks for your help! \ud83d\ude04 . Hi @sebastienros \n\nI understand that they would just act as \"caches\" meaning the local web application would still have to load the content and serve it, hence invalidating the CDN part of it?\n\nThat's not how I would use the cache no. For scaled applications that require a CDN you would install the middleware into a single application that would be the end point for your CDN. All you client facing applications would request the images using the url + querystring from the CDN and that would only call the endpoint when it is not contained within it's own cache. You gain the full benefit of the CDN then. \nCDN storage would be a pluggable cache which I plan to develop separately. \nDoes that make sense? \nOne major con I see in your approach would be load time. If you are creating the urls on the server that means for each image in your site you need to run through the entire generation pipline before the page is even rendered. That process could include http requests if you are checking for file changes. Anything goes wrong and your pages would be timing out. Url generation would even potentially slow down build generation. It's also no good for CMS applications. \nRequesting images on demand and creating the urls is very common practise. \nThe middleware I've written already provides easily configurable mechanisms for preventing DOS attacks\nHandling updated files would be an easy addition to make to the current process I think we'd alter the code here and in other cache implementations to check. \nRetrieving a file via a resolver provides very little overhead. (An image would have to be loaded for processing anyway) and allows the configuration of images from multiple locations included restricted ones.  \nI think the middleware I've created will cover the requirements for most use cases. I've written this kind of stuff before with ImageProcessor.Web and will ensure this covers everything that does and more before final release.\nCheers\nJames\n. I think you might be correct. There's a mix here of IEquatable<T> and inheritance plus only Equals(object) is only implemented in the base classes. As far as I know you should only implement it on sealed classes and always do both Equals(object) and GetHashCode(). Bravo @dlemstra you were bang on the money. It took me a few hours but I fixed the IEquatable implementation to work properly with inheritance. . @dlemstra @JBildstein One thing I have noticed since I refactored the inheritance to work is that there appears to be more ICC data coming out than going in. Any idea what could cause it?. Think I've fixed it with the last commit.. @JBildstein It does appear to vary from image to image. Definitely worth looking into. We should get the ball rolling with color transforms based on the profile also. Today I learned that WIC doesn't preserve the profile it just performs the change based on it. . Can you resubmit the issue please. This time with the template filled in properly. How are we supposed to know what version of Core, ImageSharp or anything you are using?  . This is the kind of thing I wish we had the .NET team helping us out with. Not a clue what is going on unless there is something missing due to the AspNetCore preview shift to netcoreapp2.0?. @BravoTango86 So the previous version was working on ASP.NET Core 2.0 Preview?\nWe also changed System.Memory to 4.4.0-preview1-25305-02 so we could use Span<T>. I think this is outwith our power to sort for now then I'm afraid. \ud83d\ude1e  \nWe can only wait until the dust has settled and the Microsoft libraries are out of preview.. Yeah, that's what the stacktrace above says. \n@antonfirsov What are your thoughts on this? Seems like a dependency issue in the MS libraries but I'm wondering whether there is something funky going on. i.e. a change in the underlying libraries.. @antonfirsov I didn't spot that! Well done! \nYeah, that fix is fine by me. You wanna do it?. @dbeuchler @BravoTango86 Once the CI has finished building we should have it working properly now. Please test and let us know.. @dlemstra You mean a RAW format? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_image_format\nThis is different though, there's no format only bytes.. This is the best approach IMO. It's clean and conveys the right message.. I dunno how we would manage lazy loading across the entire library. I can't see it being feasible. \nI was wondering whether formats though could have Decode/EncodeFrame methods for when a frame is detected on decode we store the bytes with the frame and only decode when needed.\nThis is all to cater for an extreme scenario though.\nFrom Gitter:\n\nI am developing a video game engine and am currently trying to add functionality for recording the screen and saving it as a gif file. Every third frame gets saved as an array of RGBA data and all the frames get encoded into one gif file and saved when the user stops recording. At a resolution of 1920x1080, that is a memory increase of 166 MB a second. My idea was that you could save every frame as a file in a temporary directory and provide the gif encoder with streams of these files.\n\nPersonally though I think pluggable memory management with tempfile backing would be the best solution if we were to offer one. Gifs like this would be absolutely huge in size. . >For me it looks like a 2.0 candidate feature ;) I wonder if we can prepare or API to provide such features in the future without breaking changes.\nMebbies... Though I'm more than happy to break everything come v2 \ud83d\ude08 . @TodesBrot Did you ever get a chance to re-investigate this?. @TodesBrot Bugger... Zero idea what could cause this. \ud83d\ude1e . Thanks @TodesBrot this is really useful! \ud83d\udc4d There's two things we need to do then.\n\nReport this upstream in the Mono bugtracker.\nSee if there is a way to force your zlib wrapper to read the last bytes (could you perhaps experiment with that?). Looks like raising Mono issue is gonna get easier \ud83d\ude04 \n\nhttps://twitter.com/migueldeicaza/status/937769295723089921. @TodesBrot Would you be able to run a test against the latest nightly. We discovered a Mono bug which we reported and found a workaround for. I think it should have squashed the issue.. You can thank the wizard that is @dlemstra for that one! . Agreed, we do. . Thanks! Really appreciate it.. @antonfirsov @vpenades @JulianRooze \nThis is all great input, thanks for contributing!\nRegarding PoolConfiguration I don't think adding a temporary API would be a wise idea. I'd much rather we focused on getting the design right with the help of the community. \nIf we continue our design discussion here and also ensure that the PR is delivered as WIP so that interested parties can chip in as it's developed then I'm sure we can deliver something powerful.\nRegarding Block8x8 We'll definitely have to alter our behaviour within PixelDataPool<T> to act a bit smarter. We currently create a block of 50 arrays at an arbitary length (matching the default in ArrayPool.Shared) per T.  @JulianRooze You've highlighted the issues there well.\nIs 50 too much in this instance? Definitely. Per jpeg we max out at 4 Components. I would probably limit this pool to 4 x Processor.Count to handle parallelism. \nWhatever we go with, let's ensure individual implementations are provided enough information to make good decisions and work granularly. \nI see this stuff as a major priority so am happy to delay beta 3 until we have it in place. \n@vpenades I did not know that about the shared pool. We don't use that for Buffer<T> and co but we might elsewhere still.\n. @antonfirsov I'm hoping some of the new SIMD API's coming will allow us to run DCT without having to use singles. We could drop the whole thing by 75% then. . c#\nvar image1 = ArrayPoolMemoryManager.Default.CreateImage<Rgba32>(512,512);\nThis API is semanticly troublesome and unintuitive. If someone came to the library as a first time user I would be incredibly surprised if they logically surmised loading images in this way. \nIt's a graphics library, and, as such, the semantic focus has to centre around the Image<T> class.\n\nmy feeling is that the default \"easy to use\" API favours a certain use case of ImageSharp, which is running continuously as a web service, and makes it utterly complicated for all other use cases. \n\nI strongly disagree here. Your proposed API gives us no advantage, that I can fathom, over passing a specific memory manager to an image constructor since any factory based logic could be internally derived. \n. Hi @GeorgePlotnikov , \n@antonfirsov is point on this issue and is planning on working on it in the latter half of this month, I'm sure he'll welcome any use-case information you can provide. \ud83d\udc4d  . Yeah you're absolutely right there. We need to organize the primitives. \nDropping integer based ones is probably infeasible since there are places outside the library that with expect integer values and unless they are careful they can fall fowl of incorrect rounding behaviour. We should create the missing primitives and offer implicit casting throughout and make sure our API looks correct from the outside.\n// Implicit casting works in reverse also.\nRectange -> RectangleF \nPoint -> PointF -> Vector2\nSize -> SizeF\nThis is a pretty easy task if someone wants to take it on?. That would be absolutely brilliant if you could!\nYeah you're right. Explicit for the reverse. \nI actually quite like the System.Drawing methods on the primitives so am happy to flesh them out to match also. Their all in corefx now so trivial to copy anything we need from there. \n. No worries. I can do this, thanks for giving it a go.\n@tocsoft I'm thinking use explicit PointF to Point etc using truncation, but define a Round method for specific requirements. That, to me would be behavior developers would expect as it matches int, float etc.. Yeah happy to do that. . Answered in Gitter also but will here also.\n\nI did but decided not to since I didn't have control of inlining plus I've no idea how long they will actually stick around the framework for.. Hey @Saftpresse99 Our Gitter channel is the best place to ask questions. I'm gonna close this issue so please ask there if you need anything else. Cheers!\n\n@NightOwl888 Thanks for answering the question \ud83d\udc4d . @antonfirsov Great! Once this builds with the updates I'm gonna merge the PR. \nWe still require more changes within the tests to improve consistency and coverage but this is a healthy start. \n@tocsoft I think the tests are still very useful and provide important coverage. I'd like to do comparison with example files in the future to ensure we don't regress at any point though. . Hey @vad3x thanks for the raising the issue and providing a great code sample for reproduction.\nI've pushed a fix for the issue just now so you should now get the correct values.\nCheers\nJames. Hi Oscar,\nWe don't support progressive encoding yet. We're hoping someone in the community will step up and help us. It's hard! \nCheers\nJames\nP.s. We have a gitter channel for questions. The issue tracker us for well.... Issues. . Thanks @antonfirsov You pushed the code to where I was aiming for! I keep forgetting the relationships between Buffer2D, Buffer, and Span. Good work!\nEverything works perfectly and incidentally this is the fastest I've ever seen the resizer working on my machine.  \ud83d\ude04  \nBenchmarkDotNet=v0.10.1, OS=Microsoft Windows NT 6.2.9200.0\nProcessor=Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6600U CPU 2.60GHz, ProcessorCount=4\nFrequency=2742185 Hz, Resolution=364.6727 ns, Timer=TSC\n  [Host]     : Clr 4.0.30319.42000, 64bit RyuJIT-v4.7.2046.0\n  DefaultJob : Clr 4.0.30319.42000, 64bit RyuJIT-v4.7.2046.0\nMethod |       Mean |    StdDev | Scaled | Scaled-StdDev | Allocated |\n------------------------ |----------- |---------- |------- |-------------- |---------- |\n'System.Drawing Resize' | 61.8849 ms | 1.5651 ms |   1.00 |          0.00 |     512 B |\n'ImageSharp Resize' | 28.9082 ms | 0.6396 ms |   0.47 |          0.01 |  16.91 MB |.

We really appreciate that \ud83d\udc4d . We've got a fix. Thanks @tocsoft and I'll merge it in a mo. \nFor the curious whatever is taking the picture is adding data I don't recognize to the App2 marker It's header starts with IntelMknote\\0MK which I couldn't find any info on..

Could you please use the Gitter channel that we link to in the readme and contribution guidlines for questions and we can try to figure out what you are asking for. \nCheers\nJames. Ah good man. Yeah, not worth the effort. This all looks great then!. Imma gonna merge this. \ud83d\udc4d . Excellent!

Hi @devedse \nThanks for supplying us with so much information; this is very odd indeed. I believe this relates to #155 \nWe need to get to the bottom of it. \nCheers\nJames. You're additional info is very important so don't worry. :smile: Tbh understanding jpeg eludes me. We're going wrong somewhere but I'm not sure where.. @antonfirsov I had a look at the rounding there and we probably should be adding .5F there but that isn't the cause of our issue. I've previously checked the YCbCr conversion and that meets accuracy standards. (I used slow but high precision conversion to compare and our decoder was still incorrect) so it's not that either.\nThe error must be elsewhere, I just don't know where that is. We're sometimes showing an error of +-3 per color component.. @devedse Thanks for clarifying the conversion accuracy.\nThe channel is populated here. https://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/blob/b165c54bb5c3a0c17cf6ce45f0f47fee9ff980fb/src/ImageSharp/Formats/Jpeg/Components/Decoder/JpegPixelArea.cs#L109. @devedse Could you please try that image against the new decoder I have been building in the jpeg-port branch. I think the colors are all correct there. . I think there's always going to be minor differences in decoders. I've read that System.Drawing even differs slightly on 32 and 64bit machines. . I've tried to keep casting to an absolute minimum in my test decoder to reduce error. . @devedse We're in the midst of a complete rewrite of the jpeg decoder which will likely utilise floating point maths throughout (so we can use SIMD). We'll revisit this once we have completed that work.. I think we've done enough work now to ensure adequate accuracy for our decoder. \nDifferent decoders yield different results with varying levels of consistency per image. We're well within acceptable parameters.. Our MathF class only actually exists due to the linked CoreFX issue. I wanted to be prepared to switch out easily when it's available. \nClamp is also  via System.Math so we don't want to expose our extensions yet either. . Yeah, we don't support 48bpp png yet... Something to definitely look into. . @xakep139 That should do it \ud83d\ude04 . Very odd, it's only a small png which I can decode/encode no problem.\nCould you share some code samples? Are you running in 32bit or 64bit mode? Are there any other contributory factors that could be eating up memory?. @tocsoft That would suggest an issue with DeflateStream on Mono to me. \n@aloisdeniel Really not sure what to do about this. It seems to be a tooling issue. \ud83d\ude1e . Nah, I'd rather raise a bug in the Mono repo. SharpZibLib is way slower. . @carcer What about the latest build? Drop me an email and I'll see if I can replicate it.. Great. It's very late here now so I'll have a look tomorrow.. @carcer I've tested against the image you sent (thanks for that) using the latest code and everything is decoding correctly for me. \nSilly question but.... You're disposing of your images yeah? . Good man, let me know how you get on. \ud83d\ude04 . @houseme-brandon \nLooking at the stacktrace that error is throwing in the jpeg decoder, it hasn't hit png yet. \nWhat's your Base64StreamToByteArray method doing? are you pooling arrays or creating a new one each time?. @houseme-brandon  I can immediately see two  non-pooled arrays both in Convert.FromBase64String and ToArray\nThat will be where you are using up all your memory. \nLook up ArrayPool<T> in System.Buffers you should be able to use that to at least copy the input stream to. Removing the allocation from decoding the encoded string though I don't know. . @houseme-brandon If you're running in 32bit mode it will be a lack of contiguous memory that's your issue. Shift to 64bit and you should be fine. \nI'm actually impressed that we were able to run images of those dimensions. I've seen System.Drawing balk at less in 32bit mode.. Discussions like this are great for other readers who run into the same problem. I'm just glad you got it sorted. \ud83d\ude04 . We've got #431 in the works just now which should dramatically reduce the amount of memory we consume when pooling plus give some options to configure your own memory providers. \nThat said, I'd always recommend 64bit for anything that requires working with images in the megapixels.. Are you using the beta2 release? @antonfirsov did some interim work in a recent nightly to reduce pooling consumption that might help you. I would grab that from MyGet and see if it helps. \nAlso, if you can get away without transparency try loading the image in Rgb24.\nThat's a big image though which will always cause problems on 32bit systems due to the limits on available contiguous memory. . >For some reason beta works faster ~14%, and Rgba32 doesn't give huge memory savings so I will stay with beta0002 and Rgba32.\nYou can't stay on beta forever... \ud83d\ude04 \nIf you read #431 You'll understand why there is more memory allocated for your benchmark. \nWe were creating too large an object pool in the beta so while you are seeing only low allocations in your benchmark, you're not seeing the pre-allocated memory that was set aside for the array pool. Memory that is locked away for nothing else but ImageSharp to use for the entire run-time of the application. The nightly reduces this pooling and allows the garbage collector to much more effectively free up contiguous memory and avoid Out of Memory Exceptions. Smaller images that lie within the pool bounds still use pooled memory.\nThe beta is also faster than the nightly because we were incorrectly missing alpha pre-multiplication as part of the resampling process which let to errors when resizing images with semi transparent pixels. Adding the overhead of premultiplication slows performance down but also fixes what would have been quite a major bug.\nRgba32 is faster because certain paths have been heavily optimized for that pixel format. We'll add optimizations for Rgb24 and others in the future. \n. Can someone test this issue please against the latest nightlies. We've squashed several png bugs and completely rewritten memory management to half the memory used by default.. Thanks @alexsorokoletov \nI'm fairly certain we've squashed the issues around this now but yeah, it could be an idea to do something like that. \ud83d\udc4d . Excellent! Thanks for the update. \ud83d\udc4d . Good man. Meant to approve it before. . Hi @boban984 \nYeah I guess it should be possible, we'd probably have to pass the chunks as extra params to the encoder.If you'd fancy lending a hand that would be great! \ud83d\udc4d \nCheers\nJames. I'll have to have a good read of the spec again to determine what is what. . @JamesMatchett I'd still consider myself an amateur after all these years \ud83d\ude04 \nIt would be smashing if you could help here, we'd all really appreciate it!\n. Yeah, it's a simple enough change. I'll merge it. . \nBravissimo!!\nI absolutely love this, from the static format detection to the way you've split out the encoders and decoders. Really, really nice! I think we have our format API. \ud83d\udc4d . Yes, You load the image as the given TPixel type. \n\nImage.Load(stream) and Image<Rgba32>.Load both load the type as Rgba32\nImage<Rgba24>.Load loads the type as Rgba24\n\nand so on.... Really this is a misuse of the issue tracker. The question should have been asked in Gitter. \nIt's a sensible requirement though so let's continue here and add the correct tags. . @xakep139 If you can't use unsafe code in your library use System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe That has a SizeOf<T> method.. Fixed with #292 . Hi @mhamri \nPlease don't delete the issue template. It's there for very good reason.\nYour original image is not a gif so of course there will be quality loss. Dithering is also turned off by default with animated gifs to prevent pixel dancing. . Hi @MeLikeChoco - Just tested using Paint.NET and zero is a valid parameter value there so we should do the same. \nShould be simple enough to fix. Thanks!. @MeLikeChoco Finally got around to fixing this. \nRe your question.. You could always add random noise to individual pixels.. Thank you! Very much appreciated!. Thinking about it we should probably just leave dithering on and people can turn it off if they need to. . @JBildstein Thanks for the fix. Is \"xx\" something that we would find in existing profiles today?. Ok, I'm happy with that then. We can always change it if need be. Thanks!. Maybe out overloads?. Hi @AmadeusW \nWe've actually merged those changes into #299 as part of our beta1 launch. We've got one thing we're trying to work out regarding the best fit for our image frame API and we'll be set to launch that. \nAs far as contributors go, yes, always. We'd love to have you help out. There's a lot of up-for-grabs issues currently open.\nCheers\nJames. @tocsoft I've assigned this to you since you're by far and away the expert here.. Closing now as in nightlies. Ummmmmm.... ImageSharp is an alpha?! We are using those versions because we need them to build a performant and usable library. \nThose previews will cease to be once Netcore 2 is released so I really wouldn't worry. . Use Gitter please. @JBildstein Quick technical question. Do you think we could tie this in somehow with the SIMD colorspace transforms in our jpeg decoder?\nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/tree/8b2b7c780821a18db351e796ce41178c9ce95e95/src/ImageSharp/Formats/Jpeg/Common/Decoder/ColorConverters\ncc @antonfirsov . @JBildstein I think we can manage something like that. Thanks. \ud83d\udc4d . @JBildstein Apologies but I think I just broke the build merging master into your branch!. @JBildstein That's great news! I'm at your disposal so I'll try to get my head around the calculator for you and offer any advice help where I can.. Hey @JBildstein I got this back up to date with the master. 1097 commits!\nYou'll have to resign the CLA again I'm afraid because we had to reimplement it to work as a single sign up across all our projects.. Great to hear! Looking forward to seeing whatever genius you produce.. Oh that's great news! \ud83d\ude04 \nI hope the rapid churn isn't causing you too many problems. I can see there's some conflicts going on already. I think you can just use all the listed files from master.. Ace... I've just merged the colorspace API into master, don't know if that's any interest/use to you.. Thanks @mellinoe for your comments. That chart is very useful!\nThere's work for us to do before you could really make any changes (Buffer<short> to Block8x8 refactoring) but by my understanding there are two places libjpeg turbo uses SIMD to speed up operations which we should also do. I've highlighted the relevant parts of our codebase.\n\nDCT transforms forward and Inverse.\nColorspace transforms\n\nI'm way out of my comfort zone here with Vector<T>, I just don't \"get it\" to be honest so any insight there would be really useful.. Hey @antonfirsov ! The colorspace stuff I thought was pretty good! \ud83d\ude1d \nI agree, Let's close this PR and open a new one. Make sure we capture the EXIF fixes I added also though.\nI think the PdfJS based decoder is good enough for beta despite the comparative decrease in speed. It can already successfully decode every single rogue image across all our jpeg issues and produces a very similar output to libjpeg. Make it work; make it work fast.\nDuring beta we can tackle performance issues and ensure we don't regress using your new qa lab code. \nSo let's do two PR's, one to switch out the decoder, then a second WIP one for performance improvements. \n. Great! \ud83d\udc4d . @tocsoft How big a change to the IImageProcessor<T> API are we talking here? Ideally I'd rather not have to have something that developers cannot implement themselves with our primitives. \nHappy with the rest of the changes btw. It'll take me a while to get used to Mutate()returning void though. . Sorry, I meant future changes for preventing double cloning.. @tocsoft I can't make my mind up about this. \nMutate() and Clone() look good on the surface but we also have the Apply (Formerly Run - I just changed the name) delegate. It feels like we've added a level of abstraction and misdirection that makes the code more difficult to follow + adds new overheads (heap allocation due to capturing of params). What benefit does it bring? \nI also find the processing context stuff confusing, calls like: \nsource.Configuration.ImageOperationsProvider.CreateImageProcessingContext are a red flag to me. Discovery of methods four levels deep is virtually nonexistent.\nThe internal interface IInternalImageProcessingContext<TPixel> and its default implementation are a flag also. What other implementations are we expecting? Does this abstraction need to happen?\nI'm struggling a little to recognize the codebase tbh, that could be the flu I have just now limiting me but it all feels more complicated than it should be.... and the more complicated it is, the slower it is and the slower we, and others can develop against it. One of my primary goals with this library was readability. I don't want to sacrifice that.\n@antonfirsov @dlemstra What are your thoughts?. \n\nMutate() and Clone() look good on the surface but we also have the Apply (Formerly Run - I just changed the name) delegate. It feels like we've added a level of abstraction and misdirection that makes the code more difficult to follow + adds new overheads (heap allocation due to capturing of params). What benefit does it bring?\nBenefit is that its obvious to all consumers of image sharp about image operations being mutative and not confusing users into thinking that can dispose of the returned image and expect the original back (i've seen this confusion many times thus a huge red flag to me)\n\nSorry... I means just the Apply() bit. Mutate() and Clone() are great!\n\nI also find the processing context stuff confusing, calls like: source.Configuration.ImageOperationsProvider.CreateImageProcessingContext are a red flag to me. Discovery of methods four levels deep is virtually nonexistent.\nthis method is only used internally and only exists for testing purposes, it allow us to actually unit test out extension method logic without the stupid overhead of trying to run the processor and guess if the settings looked with based on pixel data returning.\n\nWe should document those classes then and if there's only one context implementation simplify the methodology for now. I can't see us introducing new contexts.\n\nThe process of developing new IImageProcessors hasn't changed... its just that they should really be standalone and not require any processing logic in the extension methods like we have at the moment (and the only reason I had to add Run()) which to a massive architectural/design red flag separating the logic across many file.\n\nRun/Apply shouldn't be public then. Let's get rid of that logic then and move the offending code to the processors. I meant to do it ages ago.\n. Run makes me think of Task which doesn't feel contextually correct. Apply makes me think of JavaScript's function.Apply which would be contextually correct. . None yet I'm afraid, we've not had the opportunity (sickness, time constraints etc). You'll see something here as soon as we do.. Thanks. Yeah images that break our decoder are always useful. I'll get stuck in asap. Stuck doing stuff for my day job just now.. I've checked everything and the new fix works. Enjoy!. Great @ascensio ! Nice test additions also. That's my bad, I think I might have broken that with some refactoring. . Merged now. Thanks again for the fix, appreciate it!. @antonfirsov I don't see any reason why we can't actually use our IImageFormatDetector API to correctly determine and assign the decoder. Shouldn't need to be too fancy, we'll already have a filestream and we can read it, assign, and reset the stream.. Everything I've tested against on a Windows box (Photos, Paint.Net, Paint, Paint3D) will load that image even though it thinks it's a jpeg (details still says jpeg)\nThat for me is enough to say let's just load it.. Why did you delete the template?. I have no issue making them public. @antonfirsov @tocsoft @dlemstra thoughts?. Your wish is granted! :smile:\nThe latest builds on MyGet now allow exporting of frames \nc#\nusing( var img = Image.Load(source))\n{\n    foreach (var frame in img.Frames)\n    {\n        using (Image<TPixel> cloned = img.Frames.ExportFrame(i))\n        {\n         // Save cloned frame\n        }\n    }\n}. I just copy/pasted the surrounding code above to be honest. It doesn't do anything now I look at it. I'll update.. Thanks @xakep139 for raising this. \n@dlemstra and I actually discussed this last night. We should make sure we preserve the information by moving any compression logic where is is required. \nTo properly fix the issue we're going to have to introduce encoding support for those pixel depths also. . Hi @funkyOne \nThis should really be a question not an issue. The grain is due to the chosen error ditherer and will differ from image to image. \nNQuant uses a Wu Quantizer but doesn't support error dithering (I had a quick look at the code and saw no trace of one), that works well for some images but terribly for others. PngQuant uses a Median Cut Quantizer with a Floyd Steinburg ditherer with extra tweaks to limit the color range of chosen colors. We use a Sierra Lite ditherer without the tweaks as it's much faster. \nNote: PngQuant is specifically designed with for only one task so can afford to tweak it's ditherer to customise the equation, we have to keep it mathematically pure.\nAll this is configurable though (Look for the Dither property on the quantizer) I would experiment and see what gives you the best output. You might even be better off using the Octree Quantizer in your case, you never know. We actually support all the dithering and diffusion algorithms on this page. http://www.tannerhelland.com/4660/dithering-eleven-algorithms-source-code/\nHope that helps\nCheers\nJames. @funkyOne No worries... I'm actually curious to see what is causing the difference now. I'll have to download the nQuant source to see what is going on. The original images you uploaded contain much less colors in the ImageSharp palette than the nQuant one. . That second example looks like a bug to me. I'm gonna re open this. . @funkyOne I don't have the second image anymore to accurately test against but I retested our current output from dev branch 1.0.0-dev002212 against your original image. \nOur new output is on the left, as you can see it's far superior. We've changed a couple of things.\n\nWe now assign the same number of bits available for each color component for comparison when reducing the color palette as NQuant does.\nWe introduce less error into the image when dithering to ensure blocks of color do not have unnecessary error introduced.\n\n\nI'm going to close this now but if you have any further issues let me know.\n. Duplicate of #184 . I wonder if #166 and the fix #167 are related to this?. Turns out it was a change to another method causing this. We were offsetting when we didn't need to anymore. \nThanks for the PR with the test. That really helped and made the fix much easier to implement. \ud83d\udcaf \nI'll get a build out asap with the fix, something has gone wrong with the transition to SixLabors.. What's that error telling me? . Most likely. We should double check the PR against all given images in both issues. @xakep139 @antonfirsov Refresh my memory. What information are we seeking from this API and what is it's use case?. Thanks @xakep139 \nOk that makes sense, as long as we are not trying to use it to automatically determine the PixelFormat to use.\n@antonfirsov Would we then use reflection to determine which decoders support what we need?. Yeah let's leave it simple there and try not to expose another public API yet.. Many, many thanks @xakep139 and @denisivan0v ! \ud83e\udd47 \nThis is an incredibly valuable addition to the library and we're so happy you stuck with us to get it merged in!. Hi @hardhub \nYou're looking at the Nuget package description instead of the MyGet one which you would have installed. The Nuget hosted package is a placeholder just now. \nCheers\nJames. That's a VS issue then. The MyGet repo contains none of those description comments.. Ooh this is exciting! \ud83d\ude01 . @antonfirsov I'm closing this one for now so we can create a clean one based on the beta-1 codebase without any additional commits.. Yeah, too slow I thought, I liked your qa code so went for it :smile:\nI've already fixed the oil paint issue. png.... I'm hoping someone can easily fix the interlace bug as we had it working before. I was thinking we could get the hackfest pointing at this branch? \nAh... That makes sense, yeah let's get that setup then. \n. Skip for now and raise an issue. . That's annoying re progressive jpeg but my thoughts on that are it will be the effect of accumulative IDCT error so something we can fix when we use floating point. \nRe dither, I'll revisit the class design, the bug may not be one, dithering operates on the pixels on the right side and below the original so that first pixel will likely be unchanged. There might be a bounds check bug like in oil pain so I'll check it out.. Yeah, before IDCT I would expect everything to be exact. Hopefully the issue becomes obvious.  Good luck reading that code though! . @antonfirsov I'll have a look. Fingers crossed it's something obvious to me. \nI still think the PdfJS port is still the more viable option for the beta as it stands despite progressive issues since it can handle all the broken images.. I've just fixed the error diffusor so that test now passes.\nI think Ordered is fine as a class name because that is a type of dither algorithm (See DITHER.TXT) in the solution.\nI'll have a look at wiring up a webpage to allow us to save pdf.js images from for comparison. Let's go with the PDFJs decoder for now anyway for stability.. @tocsoft Is there any CI config stuff we need to do after we merge? I'd like to knock out a blog post to go with it also since the first beta is such a big deal. Also, git tagging, we should be doing that I think?. Holy Moly! \ud83d\udc4d . 2x Faster than before.\n```\nBenchmarkDotNet=v0.10.9, OS=Windows 10 Redstone 2 (10.0.15063)\nProcessor=Intel Core i7-6600U CPU 2.60GHz (Skylake), ProcessorCount=4\nFrequency=2742187 Hz, Resolution=364.6724 ns, Timer=TSC\n.NET Core SDK=2.0.0\n  [Host]     : .NET Core 1.1.2 (Framework 4.6.25211.01), 64bit RyuJIT\n  DefaultJob : .NET Core 1.1.2 (Framework 4.6.25211.01), 64bit RyuJIT\n        Method |     Mean |    Error |   StdDev | Allocated |\n\n------------------ |---------:|---------:|---------:|----------:|\n 'ImageSharp Jpeg' | 74.50 ms | 1.445 ms | 1.351 ms |   7.87 KB |\n```.

Everything is building in #299 \ud83d\udc4d . Hi @TJK2017\nYou forgot to put the relevant stacktrace here but thankfully it was on the Stackoverflow question.\nThe answer was given there also. The error is thrown not by us but by the underlying stream you are attempting to write to.\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Http.Internal.ReferenceReadStream.Write(byte[] buffer, int offset, int count)\nDon't try to write to that stream, create another (e.g. a MemoryStream) and you will be fine. \nHope that makes sense. No worries, every day is an opportunity to learn something new. :smile:. Hi @ToniaDemchuk This is an interesting exception.\nes-XL is not a known culture according to the following code.\ncsharp\nvar cultures = CultureInfo.GetCultures(CultureTypes.AllCultures);\nstring[] names = cultures.Select(c => c.Name).ToArray();\nWhat happens when you create a CultureInfo instance using the value on your test machine? On mine it falls back to es which I would expect from the following notes.\nNotes to Callers:\nThe .NET Framework 3.5 and earlier versions throw an ArgumentException if name is not a valid culture name. Starting with the .NET Framework 4, this constructor throws a CultureNotFoundException. Starting with apps that run under the .NET Framework 4 or later on Windows 7 or later, the method attempts to retrieve a CultureInfo object whose identifier is name from the operating system; if the operating system does not support that culture, and if name is not the name of a supplementary or replacement culture, the method throws a CultureNotFoundException exception?\nI can tweak the code to try and load the language code only but I want to be sure of the exception first. \nIs it a CultureNotFoundException?\nCheers\nJames. No worries Tonia, :smile:\nJohannes, if you wanna PR with tests that would be great! :+1:\nWhat I think would be the best fix would be to fall back to the language code first since that is what Windows 10 does. if that doesn't parse, then fall back to invariant . It will most likely be for v1 though so I'd like to keep it open and see if anything has changed by then. . Fairly certain this is a duplicate. Did you check?. Yup. Duplicate of #178 \nThanks for raising this though and thanks for the test image. This really helps us. \ud83d\udc4d \n. Hi @larssb .\nI've never tried to run the code via Powershell, let alone on MacOs (I'm utterly useless with a Mac, they make me feel like an idiot) so I'm not much help I'm afraid. \nIt might be better if you ask these questions in our Gitter forum though. There's more eyes there and definitely more Cross Os experience. I'm sure there'll be someone lurking who can help you.\nCheers\nJames. Nice work! I'm glad you figured it out. \ud83d\udc4d . Because we are trying to design better primitives with which we can provide a more usable, faster API. \nWhy did you delete the issue template? Did you not read our contribution guidelines? . Here's the thing... System.Drawing is dead. Sure they're building a shim just now but it's gonna be poor performing, buggy, and will only serve large organisation temporarily who lack the ability to migrate large quantities of code. There's zero incentive for me to build implicit operators (btw they shouldn't be implicit) for obsolete technology. \n\nI just revised the Size types between the core and .net core, I don't see differences between them ?!\n\nYou'll have missed the inlining instructions, hashcode generation code and operators between our primitives and vector types then.\nIf you had read the contribution guidelines as you were prompted to when raising this question you would have known that questions belong in our Gitter channel. It's. A much better place for questions where we can discuss such subjects in depth.\n. Thanks! \nThis will definitely be related to #301.

Only a few changes.\nI would:\n\nReverse the order of the parameters in a few operations e.g. InsertFrame(int index, ImageFrame<T> source) to put it more inline with things like List<T>. \nRename RemoveFrame(int index) to ExportFrame(int index).\nRename DeleteFrame(int index) to RemoveFrame(int index)\nChange the AddFrame variants and InsertFrame to be simply void without a return type.\nAdd a CreateFrame method that creates and appends the frame to the end of the collection. We could control the entire lifecycle then. \n\nI don't think we should removeIDisposable. In fact, I think we should make ImageFrameCollection implement IDisposable since its lifecycle is so tightly coupled to that of the ImageFrameCollection.. True that, good point.. Thanks @JBildstein Appreciate it!. LGTM \ud83d\udc4d . The Frame suffix seems nice and explicit to me but I don't think that the APIs should live in the ImageFrameCollection. (Don't ask me why it just doesn't feel right). @antonfirsov Yeah, that describes it well. . TIL. 8388608 is the number of bits in a megabyte. How the number works in FastRound I still have no idea.. @antonfirsov I ran the benchmarks on master and my branch. The allocations are now present in both.. @antonfirsov Yeah, It had me worried I'd done something. Will have a look at that other branch. Maybe we're not cleaning up properly. . @antonfirsov You're right. Will figure out something better. . @antonfirsov We already have a comprehensive suite of tests for EXIF metadata parsing and ICC profile parsing though so as far as I'm concerned we cover that well enough. All we really need to do with that is ensure it's captured correctly which I've asserted with my refactor. . Testing private fields is very brittle and exposing them purely for testing breaks encapsulation. Where do we draw the line?\nI'm all for adding a test that ensures the metadata EXIF, ICC properties are populated but the rest... I'm not convinced yet.. @antonfirsov I think we might be talking about slightly different things here. \nI also believe we should be breaking up our code into smaller, more testable encapsulated objects. However, I believe we should be testing those objects themselves, not their state within a larger class. I.E. I shouldn't need a full integration test when I know my individual components are tested. \nWhite box testing requires explicit knowledge of the internal behaviour. We control the codebase yes but we, IMO, should be aiming to allow refactoring of those internals while keeping maintenance churn of the tests low. I shouldn't be avoiding the use of private fields.\nOur public API is narrow but that's not a bad thing.\nIn this particular case, If I reintroduce the AdobeMarker and JFifMarker structs, alter them slightly, and add tests for them I should be confident that the individual components work well while keeping them private fields.. I'm gonna push a few changes later that will help us with this particular scenario but I agree yeah, there is a balance. . @antonfirsov I'm gonna merge this for now. I agree though that I'd like to get the testing better per marker by creating a type per marker. One thing that would really help would be restricting the InputProcessor to the ScanDecoder. It's only there that we really need it. . Och we all missed it. \ud83d\ude04 . Hi @caetanator \nWould it be possible for you to re-consolidate this PR and simplify the sheer number of changes you are making? It's becoming impossible to review. PR's really should be small and individually feature based. It's probably wise to split this PR into several, more manageable chunks as we now have 46 files to review. \nI'm seeing a recurring pattern of failing builds also. It's imperative that you test your builds locally in  release mode as otherwise you are just slowing down our build server. I believe you also have failing tests which you should ensure are passing before adding code (You'll see that once you push a working build). \nDon't let this put you off. We really appreciate your help putting this together! \nCheers\nJames. Thanks @caetanator we really appreciate the effort, it's just a little to big to pull in all at once. \nLooking forward to the new PR's \ud83d\udc4d . Hi @prw56 \nAre you sure you're using the latest version? GuassianBlur etc do not live on the image class in beta1. \nCould you provide version numbers?. Hello?!. No worries, like I said, those methods are not members of the image class anymore. You need to use the Mutate or Clone methods to access them. . Would it be possible for you to upload a replicable sample, please? I don't understand how this could be possible.\nThanks! . I figured it out....\nYou're not supposed to use using aliases for namespaces, they're for classes. \ne.g.\nusing IS = SixLabors.ImageSharp is incorrect.\nusing IS = SixLabors.ImageSharp.Image is correct.. @antonfirsov Nothing dramatic, Only a couple of milliseconds as those loops would break out early before anyway. \nI'd love to see if we could simdify that section one day. . Imma gonna merge this as it's good. . Hi @FelixLeChat ,\nThe transparent sections of the image are not actually fully transparent, rather only the alpha component of the pixels is set to zero.\nYou'll need to manually set the background color (Using the new beta API).\ncsharp\nimage.Mutate(x => x.BackgroundColor(Rgba32.White));\nCheers\nJames\n. I disagree. The encoding overheads in my opinion are too high and it's technically incorrect. \nAdding the method to the consumers pipeline code is trivial. Consumers should know what they are operating on. . Codecov is whack. There's now way this could bring coverage down. . Sure about what? The coverage changes? It's reporting changes in totally unconnected code. Bits for example is an internal strict specific to jpeg decoding. . Some yeah, some no. I've seen this before. Definitely wonky at times. . I'm gonna merge this. It fixes our issue for now and we can always think of something better in the future.. @xakep139 Thanks for raising this with all the info.  \ud83d\udc4d \nYou were pretty close with the fix. We just had to handle negative numbers also and reverse the stream so we can handle corruption in between chunks anywhere in the image.. @xakep139 No worries \ud83d\ude04 . We could maybe do it but I don't know what the acceptable level of variance would be and how much it would differ between images since quantization is lossy. . Codecov is wild. How can it report a 6.43% decrease with zero code changes?. @tocsoft I'll get a test added in the morning. I have a pretty good idea how to do so. . Good thinking. Would certainly save overheads. . I'm gonna merge this now as I want to keep the ball rolling.. @antonfirsov I'm happy to delay beta-2 for this. The fix is an important one. . Check https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/blob/e59af65ff41bc5435edb7852724d7e142098a80f/README.md \nto see what it looks like. Thanks for this; really appreciate it! Just one small comment where I think we can reduce allocations.. Thanks again @georgexcollins Everything was great! \ud83d\udc4d . Imma gonna merge this. All tests are passing and my code is sweet. . >Sorry for asking stupid questions.\nNo such thing \ud83d\ude04 \nGlad you figured it out.. I've handled this before, we just need to add a few more header identifiers. Will update asap.. I wasn't able to replicate this with the given image btw. . Thanks, @johannesegger, appreciate it!\nWe'll get that updated. In the future can you please raise issues using the issue template we provide. It just makes things a little easier for us to keep track of. \nCheers\nJames. No idea how to make this build, I updated the submodule with a new image.\n@antonfirsov a little help please when you have the opportunity. . Hi @georgexcollins \nSorry for the delay. Thanks for submitting this. \nBefore we can consider accepting the PR we'll have to get a few things StyleCop things sorted out so it will build so if you can try building it in release mode locally and fix that, that would be great.\nI'll do a full PR review as soon as possible. \nCheers\nJames. Definitely something worthwhile so we should try to get it working well. \ud83d\udc4d \nI wonder whether we could adapt the work done here (originally a port of ImageSharp)?  It's based upon a similar weights principle. I really like the way affine transforms have been implemented here.  \nhttps://github.com/JaCraig/Structure.Sketching/blob/3ef7cf83a825b7bd962dfe6682475e8fceade597/Structure.Sketching/Filters/Resampling/BaseClasses/AffineBaseClass.cs#L132. Hi @georgexcollins \nMany, many thanks for your help with this but I'm going to close this PR in favour of #386 \nYou invigorated me to have another crack at the problem and as such I'm managed to create a solution that handles all the different IResampler implementations. \nI couldn't have done it without you.\nCheers\nJames. Hi @krystyna93 The error message is telling exactly what the problem is.\nYou are trying to install the library into an unsupported environment (NETCore 2.0)\nYou need to target a .NETStandard target.\nSee the chart here\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\nCheers\nJames\n. Hi @irium \nThey're internal at the moment for precisely that reason. We want to do some API and optimization work first to ensure that what we release is both usable and performant. As soon as we're happy we'll make the namespace public.\nCheers\nJames. Forgot to close this. They're all public now in the nightlies.. Hi @Lapinou42\nWe're not using actually reflection in that method.\nCould you please attempt to narrow down the issue by creating a simple application that calls only Unsafe.Add(ref byte, int) \nIf that throws then you will need to raise an issue with Xamarin.\nCheers\nJames. Thanks. Can you post the code you used to narrow it down please? . Thanks @antonfirsov I was thinking the same after a bit of reading. . Thanks @tocsoft , @antonfirsov we good?. @antonfirsov Yeah we do in the unit test project, it's been around for ages but it was depending on the Xyzw method. \nThe problem optimising something like this is it has to consumable both per-pixel and per row plus ordered dither implementations can have different matrices of different dimensions.. I'm marking this as work-in-progress. I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong and the initial maths were totally incorrect. . \nIt's aliiiiiiive!\n. Go home codecov, you're drunk.. Still a lot of refactoring to do. Inheritance needs sorting out and some decision making code changed, (Expand, Center)\nI'm gonna need a hand designing the Transform API so we put together something really useful for developers to consume. . Zero idea why the Appveyor build failed. All tests passed. . Ok, I think this is ready for review now. . @tocsoft Thanks for reviewing \ud83d\udc4d . I spent ages checking the output, both upscaling and downscaling, (hence the different weight methods) so I can guarantee attractive results.\nI've been putting some thought towards performing the transform/sampling as a single operation and as long as we can apply the blending operation it should be possible. It depends on how we want to treat the current resize process though. Do we replace that with a scaled transform so we can use the same code? It might be for best imo. . @antonfirsov I've pushed an update that fixes the Lanczos banding and improves edge output overall. There's scope to improving edge handling to reduce darkening of edge pixels but I have a horrible feeling that will require companding to/from the linear color space to transform with the appropriate gamma value. That would be painfully slow with our per-pixel calculations. \ud83d\ude41 \nYou'll see some slight internal ringing with the larger Lancsoz samplers when you zoom right in but that's expected.\nAccording to the ImageMagick source (resample.c) this paper contains all the secrets to resampling.  but it's a bit too mathsy for me. \nRegarding Image sizes. I've updated the algorthim to +-.5F in the correct manner but our output size is still 1px smaller in both directions than ImageMagick. I have no idea why, as technically everything I have done is correct. It doesn't seem to be cropping anything other than in nearest neighbor mode which is to be expected. (Other samplers definitely hit those edges correctly just a little darker than i'd like).\nRegarding tests. Yes, I want samples to compare to but they have to be based upon what we think is the best possible output from our algorithm. Comparing to ImageMagick per pixel will be fruitless so I think we should simply use that for aspirational purposes  re edge handling. \nOh and Matrix translations. I don't know how to do the maths to adjust the canvas for those. \n. @antonfirsov Wires crossed, sorry! \ud83d\ude04 . @antonfirsov I think since we had to zoom in so much we can probably do without. \nI don't know if you have ever had a good look at System.Drawings rotation but it's pretty ropey zoomed in also. \nThe only thing that really bothers me is the darkening of edge pixels. I can't figure out reading the IM source how they manage to keep the component values intact.\n. @antonfirsov Please push the test. It's be useful for working against.\nI know why we get darker pixels (It's due to a lack of samples as we hit the edge and stop) and I'm gonna try a workaround idea I have. \nRe the matrix transforms. I'm going to move automatic centering to the separate Rotate and Skew processors since this is what people will expect for them. This will make Transform itself free-form. \nI'll have a look at the DrawImageProcessor to integrate the transforms into there also.. @antonfirsov So I'm fairly certain ImageMagick cheats on the rotation to get those super nice edges. \nhttps://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/d60778438c241c445ea589a59474750de7bb9a2e/MagickCore/shear.c#L1781\nIt looks to me like they apply a border matching the background, shear, then crop. \nLooks like LibVips had the same issue we did though and solved it by premultiplying the values by the alpha first. \nhttps://github.com/jcupitt/libvips/issues/291\nhttps://github.com/jcupitt/libvips/blob/e9b7231ac0ab1fde2c995a6e8bf14d989b408ab0/libvips/resample/affine.c#L528\nI've refactored our processors to allow free-form transforms using the Transform extension. I've aso enhanced that method to allow the passing of a target rectangle as you suggested.\nI've still to add transforms to the DrawImage API but I thought I'd let you have a look at my updates first plus it's getting late.. Well I'll be damned! \ud83d\ude04 \n\n. >1. When no destination rectangle is specified, the calculated one has an ad-hoc clipping on the left + padding on the right:\n\nI think it should fit the image into the transformed input rectangle when rectangle is not specified by the user.\nWhen we don't have an explicit rectangle set we default to the world bounds of the matrix transform. (Is that wise? I don't know. Maybe we should simply stick with the source rectangle... Actually, I think I prefer that.)\nIn either case, since you are rotating at point 0,0 you will always get cut off. This is why both Rotate and Skew methods specifically recenter the image.\n\n\nWhen drawing the image into the same rectangle, there is a minor 1px offset compared to the ImageMagick output:\n\n\nDoesn't look like a big issue, but I think at this point we should have our output as correct as possible in order to have good regression testing introduced.\nThe ImageMagick output was produced with the following command:\nmagick convert Orig.png -matte -virtual-pixel Transparent -distort AffineProjection 0.6427876,0.7660444,-0.7660444,0.6427876,0,0 Rot50Magick.png\nI don't know If I'm bothered by this. I'm confident in my maths so far.\n. @antonfirsov \n\n\nOk, I've made a few changes based on your suggestions.\n\nWe now use KnownResamplers.Bicubic for our default transforms\nWhen no rectangle is passed to the freeform transforms the processor will use the source value\nI've added a TransformHelpers class with a single method GetTransformedBoundingRectangle which makes it easier to calculate the bounding box of a transform. Developers can then use that result to calculate the correct translation values based on the rectangle X and Y values.. Ok, I'll have another look myself and see if I can find anything.. I think what you are seeing here is the difference in resampling algotithms + mathematical approach to the rotation.\n\nBelow is an example of three of our resamplers. Bicubic, Robidoux, and Spline, hopefully you can see the subpixel offsetting in the output. They're definitely using something closer to Spline anyway as you can see the smoothing on the patterned gradient\n\nAnd zoomed.\n\n. @antonfirsov \nHmmmm. Many of the transforms will have a rectangles with negative origins (any rotate). Any offsetting we do would be the equivalent of going 0->width, 0->height would it not since both values reflect the offset?\nThat's what we are currently doing anyway.. Ah yes! That makes perfect sense now. Great explanation! :+1:. @antonfirsov The Travis build is failing due to a change in the minimum dotnet-dev version. Needs to be 1.0.4 I've fixed that in #386 . I believe this is related to #470 and as such should be fixed in beta4. @kentcb would you be able to confirm? . @TodesBrot I can't replicate this in the current master. Here's the output from there. Can you give it a try from the repo.\n\n. Thanks, let us know how you get on. . I think this might be an array pooling thing as the LZW decoder doesn't use clean arrays to read from.\nWould you be able to alter the code locally in GifDecoderCore to clear the array before decoding? Also the global color table?. @TodesBrot I've actually just pushed a branch that should fix this for you, could you please dl, build it and test against it? . @TodesBrot Versioning has gone out of whack for our CI server (Gitversion bug) so SixLabors.ImageSharp.1.0.0-ci0030 will contain the fix.. Hi @Spawnkid \nWe probably should reorganize the namespaces for the two libraries but I'm a little confused by the approach you're taking.\nExtension methods (hence the namespace) are most commonly used as extensions to method instance and are not called via static invocation.\ne.g. \nc#\nimg.SaveAsPng(stream)\nYou'll get no ambiguity doing it properly like that.\nHope that makes sense.\nCheers\nJames\n. Glad you found an answer.  I think perhaps you should have raised this on the issue tracker for ZXing.\nAnyway...  In regards to your question.\nbcWriter.Write(value) is of type Image<Rgba64> yeah?\nIf so.... Why not?\nc#\nImage<Rgba64> output = bcWriter.Write(value);\noutput.SaveAsPng(img); // btw img is not a good parameter name for a stream.\noutput.Dispose();\nBtw, there's no reason to use Rgba64 as your pixel format type. The png encoder will convert that to Rgba32.. Happy to help, any other issues please let me know \ud83d\ude04 . @tocsoft Yeah, it's heavy going with the inlining but I think it's best to be safe than sorry here.\nWe need to be as fast as possible with these algorithms and their use is specific to png so code replication shouldn't be an issue. I'm hoping one day we can switch out the Crc32 method with the SIMD instruction once we have that API.. I know what's causing this and it's an easy fix.\nWe're incorrectly limiting the possible huffman table count to 2 for non-progressive jpegs. It's actually ok to have up to 4 dc and 4 ac tables.\nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/blob/f49bd9bec547dbdb4ab5fd581a47f8cd428683c0/src/ImageSharp/Formats/Jpeg/GolangPort/OrigJpegDecoderCore.cs#L691\nDeleting the conditional after the logical OR operator on this line will fix it. I would do it now but it's already 1:37am here.. @J0nKn1ght it'll be available in the nightlies right now if you add the myget endpoint in the read me to your Nuget.config.  . Codecov is doing this a lot just now. Very frustrating, a rebuild always fixes it. . @J0nKn1ght There's something wrong with our CI server build numbering. The latest build is actually \nhttps://www.myget.org/feed/sixlabors/package/nuget/SixLabors.ImageSharp/1.0.0-ci0026\nWe'll get the numbers sorted asap.. No worries \ud83d\ude04 . Hey @777olexandr \nThere's nothing wrong with our resampling algorithms, what your are seeing is the result of the default jpeg encoding quality options. If you change them, then the artifacts will go away.\nWe've chosen those options as default as they work well for photos (which is what jpeg is designed for) you'd be much better off saving an image with crisp lines like that as a 24 bit png, it's likely to be a smaller file also. \nHope that makes sense.\nCheers\nJames. @777olexandr \nNo worries, happy to help. \ud83d\ude04 \nI would never rely on the image extension over the file headers to determine the format. The header will return the correct value and it's all too easy for someone to save a file with the wrong extension.\nHere's a bulletproof way if saving the files with the correct format.\n``` c#\n// Create a new config.\nvar config = new Configuration(\n                new PngConfigurationModule(),\n                new JpegConfigurationModule(),\n                new GifConfigurationModule(),\n                new BmpConfigurationModule());\nvar jpegEncoder = (JpegEncoder)config.FindEncoder(new JpegFormat());\n// Alter the jpeg encoder values\njpegEncoder.Subsample = JpegSubsample.Ratio444; // This is automatically set if the quality is over 90\njpegEncoder.Quality = 90; // This should be a good value.\nusing (var instream = // Your input stream)\nusing (var outStream = // I'm assuming a FileStream))\nusing (var image = Image.Load(config, instream, out IImageFormat format))\n{\n    // Edit the image\nimage.Save(outStream, format);\n\n}\n``` \nRegarding your second issue I imagine it is because you haven't reset the input stream to the original  position. (normally 0) you need to do that as we cannot assume developers actually want us to.\nDoes all this make sense?. @777olexandr Sorry, I forgot that method was internal, I've updated the sample for you and that should now work. \nDoing it on save won't work unless you used a switch again which is what we want to avoid. \n\nAlso in my code the Load method is used in constructor and Save in a method \"Get\" because I'v wrapped it in a class that has multiple methods with chain like functionality. So the Get method is last point where caller can get the resulting Stream. Probably there is a bad thing about releasing resources but I'v found your method \"Dispose\" and will put it in Get method, is this ok? How do I get format out of Load method? Or this is impossible and then I'll just add private field with it to my class.\n\nGlad you figured out the format thing. \nI can't tell from your description when you are disposing of objects but it's important that you do so. The using statement in my sample automatically did that but calling Dispose will do also. Make sure you do the same for any streams or anything else implementing IDisposable.\n. @tocsoft I completely forgot about that API! \nYeah, that's definitely the best way to go.. Hi @mgrishkov \nNormally we use this issue tracker for issues (bugs) only and our Gitter chatroom for questions but I'll answer here for brevity.\nIf you want to auto rotate an image based on its EXIF metadata you can use the AutoOrient method\ne.g. \nc#\nimage.Mutate( x => x.AutoOrient());\nTo alter or remove EXIF data (if it exists) is a case of setting either the image.MetaData.ExifProfile property to null  or removing the individual tag image.MetaData.ExifProfile.RemoveValue(ExifTag.Orientation)\nHope that makes sense.\nCheers,\nJames. Thanks @rspeele \nRest assured we'll be refactoring all those issues away and everything will live neatly in their own namespaces for beta3.\nJust to note though, we'll probably be dropping netstandard 1.1 support so your NET 4.5.2 program will not be possible, you'll have to bump up to NET 4.6.1. I'm up for that also if that's easier. We can keep the Six Labors site more marketing based.. Closing for now as we have the basics in place and we have #411. . @iamcarbon I'll have a look at this with our latest build, I just did some work on the gif decoder. Hopefully it's simple enough to fix.. @iamcarbon Turns out this one has a left offset + width for the ImageDescriptor on frame 1 that is greater than the actual image width. Easy fix again thankfully \ud83d\ude04 \nBTW this tool is super useful for looking at individual frames.\nhttps://github.com/ata4/gifiddle. @antonfirsov Yeah, happy to see that moved to reference images. I'm 100% confident that the algorithmic output is good. . @antonfirsov I don't understand what the thresholding is doing now. Why is the difference negative? why is it not 0 since we are comparing with our own output? How are the test images generated?. @antonfirsov Much better yeah! I'm gonna merge this now. We should chat sometime  about these Linux issues in Slack to see if we can figure out what is going on. . @iamcarbon I've had a quick look and have identified the issue.\nThose two images have Application Extension Blocks with an incorrect length of 252. I checked the spec and it should be 11. (The blocks are padded with 0's which is the gif terminator so we don't actually return an image which causes the thrown exception. I'll see if that can be made more explicit.)\nHere's a great description.\nhttp://www.matthewflickinger.com/lab/whatsinagif/bits_and_bytes.asp#application_extension_block\nAnyway, it's an easy fix as the header actually tells us what length to skip so I've sorted that locally.\nI'll have a quick look at #403 also and see if I can push a fix for both at the same time.. @iamcarbon The build number for this is 1.0.0-ci.33.build.579. Hi @Menighin \nYeah we do have a forum for general chat. It's highlighted in the contribution guidelines that pop up when you raise an issue. You're not the first to miss it so no worries \ud83d\ude04  \nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/blob/deb1c9c8a6c0e09219e36edc12c49cb1aaf4fc60/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#do-you-have-questions-about-consuming-the-library-or-the-source-code\nIn answer to your question. Yes we can. You need the overload that accepts a pen that creates an outline\nc#\nimage.Mutate(x => x.DrawText(\"ImageSharp\", font, Brushes.Solid(Rgba32.Black), Pens.Solid(Rgba32.Red, 2), Vector2.Zero));\n\nHope that helps\nCheers\nJames. Impressive! \nHow did you test this without banging your head against the Appveyor brick wall?. Hi @robertbaker \nI can see in your stacktrace you are running in Azure. (Thanks for that!)\nAre you running in 32bit mode? If so I cannot recommend that as you will too easily run out of contiguous memory. \nCheers\nJames\n. No. I'm afraid not. You have a maximum amount of contiguous memory, 1Gb i think, in 32bit mode that is shared across any running applications. We work hard to limit our usage but can only ask out of what is available. I would never recommend running a website that did any image processing in 32bit mode. \nWhy would you not want to switch? . Hi @zeus82 \nThanks for the detail and the input image. It turns out that image is not a valid png.\n\nhttp://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/CgBI_file_format\nThere's quite a few differences between the format\n\nextra critical chunk (CgBI)\nbyteswapped (RGBA -> BGRA) pixel data, presumably for high-speed direct blitting to the framebuffer\nzlib header, footer, and CRC removed from the IDAT chunk\npremultiplied alpha (color' = color * alpha / 255)\n\n@antonfirsov @tocsoft @dlemstra \nTheoretically it looks like we could potentially handle these changes with some updates to our decoder based on the following, it looks like a lot of work though for all our different color types:\nhttp://www.axelbrz.com.ar/?mod=iphone-png-images-normalizer\nI don't know if we should attempt this for V1 though. What do you think?. Ha! Doesn't it! I only have Edge installed at the mo cos I had to get my laptop replaced. That renders something but it ain't pretty. Yeah let's leave it for now then. . Ok, have moved it to futures. Gonna do a little cleanup in the png decoder around the zlib headers to remove an allocation I saw that we don't need anyway. . @qmfrederik Thanks for the input; that a really useful tool! \ud83d\udc4d \nI'm going to get around to natively handling this one day, need to do some cleanup of the decoder first though.. @antonfirsov Top notch suggestions; I completely agree. \nI know how to setup the docfx stuff (except git submodules but I can read up on that)\nI want to refactor the namespaces for the API docs but work on other docs can start as soon as anyone has an opportunity.. Hi @asterixorobelix \nThanks for taking the effort and time to add that page but we do not intend to use the wiki pages for documentation. Rather we plan to use docfx as described in #402 to host both Q&A style documentation as well as API documentation.\nThis allows us to maintain a single location for our documentation for both cases which makes our work a lot easier to do.. Hi @cheesebar \nCan you please add the missing version information and also the image in question. . @cheesebar Thanks for the additional information. Did the issue go away? \nIf you don't fancy sharing an image publicly you can email me one and we can still try to work out the problem. . Hi @asterixorobelix \nI'm very glad you like the package. \nWe don't support non-raster image formats like SVG and it's unlikely that we will add the format to the core library.\nIt's more likely that someone would use ImageSharp as a basis for rendering SVG, in fact, someone has already suggested doing such with a popular library.  https://github.com/vvvv/SVG/issues/346\nHope that makes sense\nCheers\nJames\n. Nuget really need to fix this. I'll nag again.. Hi @asterixorobelix \nI don't know if you read the Contribution Guidelines when you raised this and your previous issue but we actually have a Gitter chatroom for questions. This tracker is for issues only.\nIn answer to your question. The width and height, represent the width and the height of the image in pixels.\nTo access the individual pixels you use the indexer as you have demonstrated. The pixel at [200, 200] is white and the pixel at [125, 180] is grey. \nThose numbers you have posted beside them are the Vector4 representation of those pixels (each pixel component divided by 255F). I'm not sure how you came up with them other than by calling ToVector4() on the index since the ToString() representation of the Rgba32 struct should represent the byte values ranging from 0 - 255. \nI hope that makes sense.\nCheers\nJames. No such thing as dumb questions. Ask away! \ud83d\ude04 . Hi @feliwir \nWhat you are seeing is actually correct behaviour. ImageSharp supports about 20 different pixel formats and as such the encoders and decoders are format agnostic. \nWhat you need to do is to pass a new instance of the BmpEncoder class as the second parameter when saving the image with the BmpBitsPerPixel property set to BmpBitsPerPixel.Pixel32.\nHope that makes sense\nCheers\nJames. @tocsoft Just saw this related issue in the OxyPlot repo\nhttps://github.com/oxyplot/oxyplot/issues/1188. Hi @martonx,\nI've just tested both the image and the resampler using the latest beta on Nuget\nhttps://www.nuget.org/packages/SixLabors.ImageSharp/1.0.0-beta0002\nand I was able to resize the image without issue. \n\nSince you did not provide a version number as requested in the contribution guidelines when you opened the issue and that I can see you are using the new Image(imageByteArray) constructor I can only conclude that you are using the fake RevStackCore-ImageSharp that someone added to Nuget without our permission.\nThis a a copy of a very early alpha that should never be used. \nP.S\nIt looks like you are using MemoryStream.ToArray() a lot in your code. That's going to cause you issues down the line as you are allocating too much memory. I recommend using streams directly. \n. No worries :smile: I'm hoping Nuget will help us remove it eventually. I am trying to do so. \n  . Hold on! So what is actually causing the error and why can we not use an int (the actual type of the dimensions in out Image<T> class) to set the value?\nThe issue here seems to be a larger issue on of a lack of type safety within the API. If the following will throw at runtime then it shouldn't be possible.\nc#\nprofile.SetValue(ExifTag.PixelXDimension, source.Width); \nprofile.SetValue(ExifTag.PixelYDimension, source.Height);\nThis PR is obsolete anyway since Rotate will change with #386 when it finally gets merged.\nReading the spec we also have ImageWidth and ImageLength for uncompressed image formats which both support short and long values. \nWe should update #386 to fix this and update the missing tags if present. We should also have a look at creating extension methods for ExifProfile to simplify this process and do the conversion for us already.\nExifProfile.SetImageDimensions or suchlike.. @dlemstra I wonder, do you think it is possible to solve our ExifValue needing to support multiple ExifDataType values by using flags? \nWe could then combine the values like ExifDataType.Short | ExifDataType.Long and support both lengths.\n. Closing in favour of #448 \nThanks @musukvl for your help! \ud83d\udc4d . It's that RevStackCore ImageSharp library that is the problem. It's a copy of an early alpha of the library that some prat decided to publish without our permission and have refused to remove. Nuget have also been utterly useless so far in removing it for us. \nDelete that junk and you'll be fine. . Yeah, frustrating \ud83d\ude26 . @antonfirsov I think the blend implementation we have that takes Span<T>already caters for any performance implications. If we offer an additional per-pixel API that should be ok.   . Remind me to go through the codebase and standardize any Instance Current properties.. I'd say it only affects only the convolution based processors so theoretically shouldn't be too big a deal. That said a PR would be most welcome. . You reckon? I don't think any of the drawing stuff really cares about edge pixels. I could be wrong though, it's not an area I've looked at in a while. . Hi @vpendes,\nThanks for all the detail. Can you do me a favour and add something that is missing though? Reference output of equivalent operations created with another library or two?\nWithout such we have no indicator of what the correct output should be, only your expectation. \nCheers\nJames. Thanks for the images. I appreciate it.\n\nThe rule of thumb is that, for any operation, if the pixel is fully transparent, it's color should be irrelevant for any subsequent operation, and that not only includes blending, but also blurs, resizes, etc.\n\nI would argue that should not actually be a hard rule. You can lose pixel information that could be important further down the line.\n\nI can figure supporting this is expensive... my guess is that IPixel could have a fast bool IsFullyTransparent property to check if an image has any fully transparent pixel, and choose between the current paths and the \"transparent pixel aware\" paths.\n\nWe'd have to check the W property on the expended Vector4 itself as anything else would require double unpacking which would be computationally infeasable.\nWhat I think we are looking at here as a solution is premultiplication. \nYou can see the theory here \nhttp://entropymine.com/imageworsener/resizealpha/\nWe'd need to create fast operations for performing premultiplication perations and the reverse on rows of images and single pixels to correctly handle the alpha component.\nWe've actually taken that into consideration when performing affine transforms in our new Affine transform methods PR.\nLibVips went through similar issues.\nhttps://github.com/lovell/sharp/pull/213\nhttps://github.com/jcupitt/libvips/issues/291\n. Interestingly LibVips has added Premultiply and Unpremultiply methods to the image itself. That definitely the simplest solution! (Though maybe not the most performant)\nhttps://github.com/jcupitt/libvips/issues/291#issuecomment-100172537\n@antonfirsov @tocsoft @dlemstra Would love to have your thoughts here.\n. @vpenades Good point. We'll have to go with the first approach of working directly on the Vector4 within the algorithms. . @vpenades I disagree. If you look at the linked issues it's blur they specifically mention.  . @vpenades Some pixels formats, e.g Short4 operate in the vector range -37267 to 37267so we can't do that. Premultiplication and reversal is the answer, I just need to get round to it.. @saucecontrol Many thanks for your input here, I had not covered the weight normalization requirements and they are vital to producing the correct output. What I'll look at is per-row (or per-pixel if I can't do row) premultiplication and reversal within the algorithms themselves to that I'm always working in floating point and do not lose precision. A couple of extension methods to Vector4 should make that easier. Your blog posts btw are simply brilliant!\n@vpenades Thanks for the test image, I'll use it to test against and will most likely add it to the repo. This task is now my priority since everyone else is working on  memory management. Hopefully I can get a fixed build out in the next couple of days.. @vpenades Here's the result of blurring your test image using premultiplication (dead easy to add to the source since they all use convolution base classes) Is this the output you would expect? If so I can fix resize also.\n\n. Haha! @vpenades you're a genius! \ud83e\udd23 \nThis should be a standard test image for all libraries.\n\n. @saucecontrol I'm terrible for blogging. I know I should do more but I find it so difficult to string enough of what is going on in my head together to be meaningful.. Aaaaaand it's in, thanks for the suggestion and excellent testing image.. Bugger... Is it just that method? . Ok, fingers crossed it's something simple. The equations are all in the spec for comparison as I recall. . @tocsoft I've not looked at the formulas but these lines looks incredibly suspicious to me. \nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/blob/8899f23c1ddf8044d4dea7d5055386f684120761/src/ImageSharp/PixelFormats/PixelBlenders/PorterDuffFunctions.Generated.cs#L81\nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/blob/8899f23c1ddf8044d4dea7d5055386f684120761/src/ImageSharp/PixelFormats/PixelBlenders/PorterDuffFunctions.Generated.cs#L184. Ok.. So I created a small program based on the above code using images similar to the ones in the spec so we can compare\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/compositing-1/#porterduffcompositingoperators\nporter-duff-tests.zip\nThere's a few issues I've spotted straight away: \n\nDestIn, and In are both definitely incorrect\nSubtract is wrong also (and misnamed)\n\nIt's difficult to know what is right or wrong though as we use different naming conventions from the spec.\nWe need to:\n\nMatch naming\nComplete the list so we contain all the options.\nFix our issues.\n\nThis is not something I'm confident in my own ability to solve so I will definitely need help.\n. Fixed with #493 . Tut tut, what happened to Gitter :smile: \nInteresting proposal, something I've never considered as I try to avoid having many images on the go at the same time. Linq queries like that could be terribly expensive. \nI'm up for it though if kept simple. . Fixed with #292 . Will do! :smile:. There's an overload for Image.Load that passes an IImageFormat as an out parameter which will give you what you need. \nP.S. We have a Gitter channel for questions. \ud83d\ude04 . I'm adding a link here to a Windows classic desktop app targeting NET 4.7.1 running beta 2 built using VS 15.5.3\nI'm able to resize a png (thus touching compression at runtime) without issue.\nhttps://1drv.ms/u/s!AhWs_teP7rZGwdMRLgclPUcb4E4mMA. Here's another console app this time targeting both NetCore 2.0 and NetFramework 4.7.1\nhttps://1drv.ms/u/s!AhWs_teP7rZGwdMbfM4EwwueQkiCow. Nice unwelcome rant but what has this got to do with our library and immediate issue? . We're only writing these to help migration. I think it's up to individual library providers to create interop solutions. DirectX, OpenGL and Vulkan textures are going to be included in gaming engines and will be specific to their API's. \nVeldrid for example has managed it without us having to write a line of code. . I guarantee it's something different with the zlibstream implementation in Mono. It's the only wildcard in the entire decoder.. Hi @justintubbs \nThanks for the info, Can you fix those image links please so I can have a look at them. I'm getting a 403 error.\n@antonfirsov Looking at the codebase it looks like we are not calling the EnsureNoEOF at any point but rather EnsureNoError without checking to see wther we have image data first.\n. @justintubbs Those attached images are pngs?. @justintubbs Can you provide the appropriate jpegs please? Otherwise I'm going to have to close this issue. \nThanks!. @alexsorokoletov You can see them? Great! \nCan you do me a huge favor and add them in a zip file to this thread? We're all getting 403 Forbidden statuses when trying to view the images.. Thanks for that! I can confirm that both images work perfectly with the latest nightlies. \nClosing this issue.. Hi @justintubbs \nAs with #440 I cannot access the images to investigate them. Could you please allow access.\nCheers\nJames. I'm unable to replicate this using the current repository codebase with any of your posted images nor with any new images generated using the Window Snipping Tool in either format. Would you be able to test against that code locally?\nI'm using:\n- Windows 10 Version 1709 (OS Build 16299.192)\n- Snipping Tool 10.0.16299\n. @saucecontrol Thanks for that! I couldn't see the wood for the trees there. \n@justintubbs The way you are loading the images is unconventional. Normally you would use Image<TPixel>.Load(Stream). That method attempts to identify the correct codec to use and will throw an exception if it cannot do so.\nWe've already opened #442 that will add throwing an exception if there is not data contained within the png and we can ensure all other decoders do similar with appropriate messaging.  . No one in those examples is copying one stream to another. If you copy to a memory stream it's gonna be at the length position in copy completion. I'm not sure why you are not using the filestream directly. \nWe can check if the position is equal to the length and throw there but nothing more. . Och, no need for an apology at all! It's taught us that we need to make our error messages more developer friendly and add that check. \ud83d\ude04 . We should definitely throw here but I'm not sure this will be the fix for #441 since the OP would notice if there is no image data. Something nasty is waiting us no doubt. . @endink  Please resubmit this using the issue template. We cannot help you without one.. Thanks, we're also going to require the source image.. Hi @endink \nI'm able to resize and save the image to 150 x150 without issue. Are you sure all your variables are correct?\n\n. No worries, glad you found a solution. \ud83d\udc4d . @antonfirsov Great! Yeah, I had a look at batching myself and couldn't see anything obvious. Once those API's are in we can revisit. . @dlemstra Yeah, that looks like the issue, good work.\n@GeorgePlotnikov It looks like you are also using the preview of NETCore 2.1 Have you tried the 2.0 release? The library should be stable against that.\nI'm not sure what (or even if) we will have to do when 2.1 reaches RTM but I'll ask around. \n. >I will try to downgrade System.Memory then, I'd rather not use a nightly in production\nTut tut... You shouldn't be using a beta in production! \ud83d\ude09 \nProgress is moving swiftly with beta3 and we should have it out in the next few days - a week max. \nWe will be moving your cheese around though with lots of namespace changes (sensible ones). We should have API docs though to help you migrate.. We'll get there soon. It's difficult to build something like this when the goalposts are moved so often upstream.\n\nbut it's just too many issues just to make a simple thumbnail\n\nNothing simple about a thumbnail Have you seen the code in that class. Resizing it hard! \ud83d\ude04 . What version of System.Memory are you using? Have you tried the steps above?\nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/issues/447#issuecomment-370795694. I would grab the nightlies from our MyGet feed. That should work fine.. >@JimBobSquarePants Is there any plan/release date when using ImageSharp with .NET Core 2.1 will be supported? At least basic scenarios like LoadingImage from FileName\nDon't be that guy. .NET Core 2.1 isn't even released yet.. We already support the release candidate with beta 4. I\u2019ve tested the final release against it and it works . Yes of course. You should probably read the api documentation linked from our readme.. @nla-brandonjames \nUnfortunately we don't have support for saving progressive jpegs. See #10 It's something I REALLY want though.\nWe'd need support from someone in the community if we are in any way likely to get it for v1.0 as jpeg is.... complicated. At the moment you would have to post process the images using something like mozjpeg. \nCheers\nJames\nP.S In the future could you please ask questions in the Gitter channel? We're trying to keep the issue tracker clear so we can stay on top of things. . Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . Hi @mfe- \nThat looks like a Mono issue to me. We don't and shouldn't need to do anything special since we are building to the .NET Standard. \nPerhaps @TodesBrot can shed some light on the difference between the two stream types? I have never used Xamarin.. >Loading the Image took about 3 Minutes\nOuch!. I'm closing this as it really boils down to SIMD support on ARM chips which should be coming. \nhttps://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/22940\nHowever we could be limited to netcore only?\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/24346. @vpenades Good catch\nWe should strip out the following tags on all transforms\n- SubjectLocation\n- SubjectArea\nAnd possibly strip out the following on scale/crop (not sure about these)\n- SubjectDistance\n- SubjectDistanceRange\n. Yeah, you're right, we don't need to touch SubjectDistance and SubjectDistanceRange.\n\nBy strip the tags, you mean remove them? or adjust the values? \n\nI meant remove them as I don't know how feasible it would be to recalculate them based on the transform. We're gonna have unlimited composable affine transforms in the next beta. Happy to take suggestions though if you can think of something better?\nThat's some great code you have there btw, stuff we should probably have in core. It seems a lot of work based on our current API/capabilites for you to get the information you need in a usable form. \n. @vpenades You and I need to chat about those suggestions in your repo btw, would love your help implementing some of the changes. We need people like you writing code based on our work to help us make sure it does what you need/expect it to do. \ud83d\udc4d . @vpenades I've pushed a quick fix for your resize issue to the nightlies. If you can open a new issue regarding SubjectDistance and friends we can have a separate discussion there and hopefully incorporate some of your work. . @dlemstra What are your thoughts here? \nWe need to delete the invalid override in ResizeProcessor (My bad) but should we also have this logic?. Hi @JoshaMunnik \nThanks for your submission here, we really, really appreciate it! \ud83d\udc4d \nAt this time though I think it's best that we only support the types as dictated by the EXIF specification to avoid any potential confusion. \nCheers\nJames\n. Great work! \nI'm happy for the swap methods to remain in the individual classes to be honest. Better localization. . We can now do cool things like pass a custom palette to an ordered dither matrix\n\nOr error diffuser\n\nOr pass custom colors to all our thresholders\n\n\n. I do plan on adding reference images, I just wanted to wait after we've cleaned up all our PR's a little. . I'm gonna merge this now. I'm happy with it and don't want to block future work. . Answers on a postcard guys. This works locally and on Travis.\n. \nI thought this would be easy! Lots of test refactoring due to new Span<T> and friends rules. Was having a hell of a time with floating point comparison on AppVeyor also. (They must use really cheap chips)\nIt works though now.\n. @antonfirsov Thanks for the review and the extra cleanup. Keeping the samples in one location is best.\nHappy to drop netstandard1.1 if everyone agrees. That loses NET 4.5.2 support but I think everyone should be on at least NET 4.6.1 anyway.\nRe the failing tests, they're now passing on our Travis and AppVeyor builds but it comes down to equality comparers in the IRgbWorkingSpace implementations and the Adapt caller relying on them. I plan to have a good look at that. \nRe .vscode/launch.json I say point it at the benchmarks.. Hi @mphipps1 \nNormally we would use our Gitter channel for questions such as this. It helps us stay on top of issues.\nSetting individual pixels is performed via the indexer on Image<TPixel>\nbm[x,y] = Rgba32.Red;\nHope that helps,\nJames. I've wondered before whether we should create GetPixel SetPixel methods to act as syntactic sugar but I've never managed to convince myself that they're worth it. We're basically dealing with a 2D array so the indexer semantically works well. \nThe Draw- commands are specialist functions that require additional computation so I wouldn't classify them as the same API-wise.\nEither way, we'll have API docs soon so discoverability will be much improved.. @antonfirsov Yeah, let's add it, it should be a quick win.. The nightlies support preview 2 so you should be able to run with the latest there. . >As a bonus, it could be great to be able to modify the metadata of an image file, without modifying the actual compressed image.\nThat would be a very nice bonus. Probably for V2, Lets close this issue and open another for that specific functionality.. @antonfirsov Aye probs,\nBasically all EXIF stuff is handled in the base class. I just forgot to delete an override that existed before I added the functionality to the base.. Hi there, \nThat version number looks suspicious, have you downloaded the official SixLabors package? It should be beta2. \nCheers\nJames. I'll need to see the image in question before I can make any judgement so could you please upload it?\nIf you're looking for the imageformat btw there's an overload for Load that has an out parameter.\n. Hi @daniherculano84 \nI posted an answer hours ago but somehow GitHub didn't actually save it. \ud83d\ude41 \nI tested your image with the latest nightly and although I don't recall any changes between that and the beta (I haven't tested against the beta) you will see from the screenshot that the image dimensions are reported correctly. \n\nI would download the nightly from our MyGet repo listed in the readme and give that a go.\nCheers\nJames. Thanks @denisivan0v  for all the info and the sample program. We really, really, appreciate it when people like you make the extra effort. \ud83d\udc4d \n@antonfirsov This is an odd one. \nJpegSnoop is reporting a YCCK color profile same as our YCCK sample in the repo so I don't know off the top of my head what the cause would be. \n```\n Marker: APP14 (xFFEE) \n  OFFSET: 0x00000014\n  Length            = 14\n  DCTEncodeVersion  = 25600\n  APP14Flags0       = 0\n  APP14Flags1       = 0\n  ColorTransform    = 2 [YCCK]\n```\nCould you have a look when you can?I'm not gonna have a chance for at least a week and a half.. I've just checked this using the PDFJS port and it decodes correctly. I should be able to use it as a reference for the Golang one.. Ok.... The conversion algorithm itself looks correct, the input data less so. \nFor [0,0] the k value should be 255 but we're getting 128. The Golang port is simply too complicated for me to understand without a lot of picking apart and testing so I don't know why that is the case. Maybe we are pulling the wrong component list somehow. cb and cr are both 128.\nI still find the readability of that decoder an issue. I only wish we'd managed to make the other one a bit faster, I've forgotten most of the code I wrote for it but I could understand the pipeline more.\njpeg is hard \u2639\ufe0f . @antonfirsov Yeah of course.\nThe PDFJs method that I used to determine the correct k value is here.\nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/blob/98a777322f548a2a193bcf7bf31f6ca4d348cd67/src/ImageSharp/Formats/Jpeg/PdfJsPort/Components/PdfJsYCbCrToRgbTables.cs#L102\nFor the Golang port we are looking here.\nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/blob/98a777322f548a2a193bcf7bf31f6ca4d348cd67/src/ImageSharp/Formats/Jpeg/Common/Decoder/ColorConverters/JpegColorConverter.FromYccK.cs#L18\nUsing the sample image we should get input YCbCrk values for each component at [0,0] of 0, 128, 128, 255 which when converted to RGBA gives us white. The Golang values are 0, 128, 128, 128.. >@JimBobSquarePants as far as I understand, the conversion methods are correct in both decoders, they are just consuming the wrong k in the \"golang\" case. I guess the \"golang\" spectral data is wrong for the input provided in this issue (the \"pdfjs\" one is inaccurate for others).\n@antonfirsov Yeah that's right, the maths is correct, just the input is funky. I'll see what I can do.. >@JimBobSquarePants I think SixLabors.ImageSharp.Web.Memory.BufferDataPool shouldn't be public! It's has all the drawbacks of an uncofigurable/unreplaceable singleton!\n(I don't think it's the main issue in this example however.)\nAh... How do you suggest we make it possible for devs implementing IImageResolver to use pooling then? We use the pool to allow reading of input streams for the PhysicalFileSystemResolver without allocation.. @antonfirsov @valse \nIn DrawImage we're making a deep clone of the input image if the dimensions don't match. It looks like we're cleaning up after ourselves but that's gonna create a whole heap of extra memory pressure if those images are large. \nI'd like to refactor this to remove the clone and make it a bit more readable.. Just created a PR to remove the clone. Making the pool configurable sounds like a plan, I'll do that next.. @valse #471 will get rid of the issue.. Reopening as the solution can be improved upon.\nWe should add a parameter to the explicit Pad method to allow a shortcut to setting the color. \n.Mutate(x => x.Pad(int width, int height, TPixel color))\n.Mutate(x => x.Pad(GraphicsOptions options, int width, int height, TPixel color))\nResize itself will probably stay the same as we don't want to make ResizeOptions a generic type. . Hi @wozzo \nAt present we do not support reading/writing either IPTC or XMP metadata which both support keywords. EXIF does not have such a tag. \nWe're always looking for contributions though to add those metadata specifications. \nHope that clears it up.\nCheers\nJames. @tocsoft What's your thoughts on this? I've seen it pop up a few times now. Where should I be looking to investigate?. I think we need to create reference implementations to compare against. I have no real idea what the correct behavior should be. . I believe this has now been fixed in beta4. Will close for now. @benwilliamson please reopen if you continue to have the issue.. @tocsoft I was actually thinking the same when I was out for a walk earlier. I vote drop the size parameter entirely as draw whatever they give us. . @tocsoft Ok, I've stripped out the size parameter completely, It already feels better to consume. \nI added a couple of quick cleanups to our transform code so we could better test passing a transformed image to the method. Nothing major, just making things more sensible.. Hi @bvandier \nI've been meaning to refactor that particular section of code for a while now. Once #474 is merged the options will be reusable.\nCheers\nJames. @antonfirsov It's actually all really trivial stuff, basically copy/pasting code from one location to another and tweaking the input parameters \ud83d\ude04 . I'm gonna hopefully get a chance to review your PR at lunch, if not then definitely tonight \ud83d\udc4d . Before I merge this, quick question. Since the bounds are always going to be a Rectangle of (0, 0, width, height) I wonder whether we should just preserve the Size instead?. Ok, I'm happy with this for now then using GetCurrentSize(). Any future changes can be handled in a separate PR.. >Maybe it could be cleaner to have a image formats decoupled from Configurationinto it's own class ImageFormatsCollection that would keeps all the functionality related to image formats management, and would let Configuration to be greatly simplified.\n@vpenades Looking at Configuration class I'm inclined to agree. A separate PR though I think. \n@antonfirsov Re throughput performance? Perhaps it's as simple as the abstraction costs due to using interfaces? I can't see anything that stands out.. @antonfirsov I'm happy for this to be merged now. \ud83d\udc4d \nUnsafe<T> is fantastically readable really (It's such a great API!) so I have no issue replacing indexer access on hot paths with that. That can be done as small individual PR's though as we benchmark after the beta. (I'm really hoping the final push will be all about optimization with very few bug fixes/changes)\n. WithTemporalBuffer<T> is very nice! I really should get better at reading up on the API's I use, I wasn't aware of the before/after action overloads to Parallel.For\nOk, rock on, I'll leave merging to you.. That's a neat trick you used to access the fixed Data field in the unfixed indexer expression in FixedInt32Buffer16 and co. I'll have to remember that one. . That's all merged in now. Thanks for the PR! \ud83d\udc4d . Hi @ambroselittle \n\nHowever, that issue is closed, saying it was fixed in an alpha, but the issue persists in beta.\n\nWe chose to not automatically seek to the beginning of the stream for consumers because we wanted to be able to read streams where the image might not be at the beginning of the stream (This happens).\nThat behaviour catering for the minority makes it cumbersome for developers who don't want to have to set the position so should change.\nWhat we can do:\nI can make it so that the default behaviour of the stream loading methods resets the position of the stream to 0. Overloads offering a ReadOrigin parameter can choose the current position if they require.\nWhat we can maybe do:\nWe need to be able to seek streams and copy non-seekable streams (MD5Stream is non-seekable) to a MemoryStream to make it seekable.\nYou can see that here:\nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/blob/47a8533b7d7b43b490d4958d2702490a580d9d34/src/ImageSharp/Image/Image.FromStream.cs#L253\nNow that relies on the ability of a stream to support Read which your stream doesn't. However, we may be able to simply pass the stream to the MemoryStream contructor instead of copying.\nIs that how you wrapped the MD5Stream? If you can show me how you did it I can update the open PR and make it automagically work\nCheers\nJames\n. @antonfirsov \nOK.... This is getting a little confusing now. I wrote the following test code to consume an MD5Stream and run it past our copying code. It all seems to just work. \n@ambroselittle Have you tried the nightlies from MyGet? I'm wondering whether we have changed something since the beta? And, I know this is a daft question but the response stream is definitely an MD5Stream?\nIs there something obvious I've missed?\n``` c#\nusing System;\nusing System.IO;\nusing System.Security.Cryptography;\nusing Amazon.Runtime.Internal.Util;\nnamespace StreamTester\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Testing Md5Stream\");\n        using (var fs = File.OpenRead(\"Calliphora.jpg\"))\n        {\n            var length = fs.Length;\n            var hash = GetHash(fs);\n\n            MD5Stream stream = new MD5Stream(fs, hash, length);\n\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Can read - {stream.CanRead}\"); // True\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Can seek - {stream.CanSeek}\"); // False\n\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Stream was successfully copied to a memory stream and reset to beginning - {WithSeekableStream(stream, s => s is MemoryStream && s.Position == 0)}\");\n\n            // This all prints\n            // Testing Md5Stream\n            // Can read - True\n            // Can Seek - False\n            // Stream was successfully copied to a memory stream and reset to beginning - True\n        }\n\n        Console.ReadLine();\n    }\n\n    static byte[] GetHash(FileStream fs)\n    {\n        using (var ms = new MemoryStream())\n        {\n            fs.CopyTo(ms);\n            fs.Position = 0;\n\n            using (var hashAlgorithm = MD5.Create())\n            {\n                return hashAlgorithm.ComputeHash(ms.ToArray());\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    private static T WithSeekableStream<T>(Stream stream, Func<Stream, T> action)\n    {\n        if (!stream.CanRead)\n        {\n            throw new NotSupportedException(\"Cannot read from the stream.\");\n        }\n\n        if (stream.CanSeek)\n        {\n            return action(stream);\n        }\n\n        // We want to be able to load images from things like HttpContext.Request.Body\n        using (var memoryStream = new MemoryStream())\n        {\n            stream.CopyTo(memoryStream);\n            memoryStream.Position = 0;\n            return action(memoryStream);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n}\n```. @ambroselittle I'm just glad we figured this out! \ud83d\ude04 \nI don't know why System.Drawing would have worked on a disposed stream, maybe they don't do our additional check. We don't want to remove that CanRead check though as it eliminates potential bugs.\nI think this discussion has proved fruitful though and the addition of reading control for seekable streams is a good one.\nI'll close this once the associated PR is merged.. Ah of course!. Cheers @vpenades !!\n@tocsoft Could you please review this PR as you wrote the original configuration code. Thanks!. LGTM, I've just updated the PR from master and will merge tomorrow if no complaints. \ud83d\udc4d . Glad it wasn't something buried deep in the scan decoder or something else crazy. You're added method is much neater. \nI'll merge once the build is passed, hopefully tweaking the tests will bring up the coverage. . @antonfirsov There's actually two issues embedded in one there, I missed the second issue that simply passing the stream doesn't work.\n@tocsoft I had a look through the AWS code. MD5Stream is both non-readable and non-seekable. We're throwing because it's non-readable and CopyTo() relies on the stream being readable. \nHowever, the OP managed to wrap the stream in a MemoryStream (I'm assuming through the constructor but I don't want to have to download the SDK to check) so I've asked him how. We should use that approach rather than our existing one if this is the case.\nRegarding using Configuration, I designed it like Stream.Seek(SeekOrigin) which the localized context works well with. I guess I could move it there though, it might actually make the code a little cleaner.. I'm putting this on hold for the moment. Something funky is going on.\nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/issues/477#issuecomment-369424708. Ok... So it turns out #477 was user error. \nI think there's still merit in adding some granular control to our stream seeking behavior so with that in mind I've changed the default to ReadOrigin.Current and removed the extra exception. \nDefault behaviour is still the same as prior to the PR, we just have extra options now.\n. @antonfirsov \nI checked the first image and we're throwing because when we check for the first expected RST marker we get 255,255 instead of 255,208. \nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/blob/bc65aead9b04bb911236f3b1fc67bd08773c8c2b/src/ImageSharp/Formats/Jpeg/GolangPort/Components/Decoder/OrigJpegScanDecoder.cs#L207\nWhat I don't know is what we should do here. Do we rewind and continue? Should we expect the next marker? . RST markers are used to resync decoding of scan data when the image is corrupt. \nThey're distributed at an interval defined in the DRI (Define Restart Interval) marker. This means that every n MCU blocks a RSTn marker can be found. The first marker will be RST0, then RST1 etc, after RST7 repeating from RST0.\nHow you actually use them do do so is a mystery to me. I think however I've found the logic used in libjpeg turbo. https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/blob/077e5bb4e0f6761c034e7c1f7e7a4120f580f1a0/jdmarker.c#L1209. You get a partially decoded image. Same as PdfJs version.\n\n. No worries.\nYeah, just grab the latest from here.\nhttps://www.myget.org/feed/sixlabors/package/nuget/SixLabors.ImageSharp. Which tests are failing? We should feedback if we can.. That's good news! I'll let you have a dig around for now, I'm on the day job.. Do all the tests pass on 2.1 now? I haven't installed the preview bits yet.. No worries, let's get this in for now and fix the 2.1 bugs later. . Imma gonna merge this now, I hate these things stacking up. . Go team! That looks much better! \ud83d\udc4d . Hi @KANekT \nThe issue tracker should only be used for issues, not questions (please read the contribution guidelines).\nI'll answer though since it's your first offence \ud83d\ude1d \nWe removed the size parameter from DrawImage because the internal clone required used too much memory. \nSee https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/pull/471\nInstead you now have to resize the image before passing it to the other DrawImage method.\n``` c#\npublic static class WaterMark\n{\n    public static IImageProcessingContext ApplyScalingWaterMark(\n        this IImageProcessingContext processingContext,\n        string cacheFolder)\n        where TPixel : struct, IPixel\n    {\n        return processingContext.Apply(\n            image =>\n            {\n                string path = Path.Combine(cacheFolder, \"logo.png\");\n            if (!File.Exists(path))\n            {\n                return;\n            }\n\n            // Dispose of logo once used.\n            using (var logo = Image.Load<TPixel>(path))\n            {\n                bool worh = image.Width > image.Height;\n                double coff = worh\n                            ? image.Width * 0.1 / Math.Min(logo.Width, logo.Height)\n                            : image.Height * 0.1 / Math.Max(logo.Width, logo.Height);\n\n                var size = new Size((int)(logo.Width * coff), (int)(logo.Height * coff));\n                var location = new Point(image.Width - size.Width - 5, image.Height - size.Height - 5);\n\n                // Resize the logo\n                logo.Mutate(i => i.Resize(size));\n\n                image.Mutate(i => i.DrawImage(logo, PixelBlenderMode.Normal, 0.5f, location));\n            }\n        });\n}\n\n}\n```\nP.S You were't disposing of your logo after use. Image<TPixel> implements IDisposable and should always be disposed of once used.\n. @LeslieMurphy Are you sure you definitely have beta3. We removed the size parameter before then. \nGitter is probably best for questions just now.. We need to deal with nothing. Our operations work well. You STILL haven't described why 1mb is wrong. . The difference is staring you in the face. You've clearly demonstrated what affects the output size.\nYour input images are probably saved at 100 quality, you're saving at 75 and then 90. This changes the way the quantizer within jpeg uses colors and sampling and can cause a massive drop in image size with very little difference in quality. Something you could have easily researched. It's all on Wikipedia for example. \nNow....\nI need you to stop posting here. This is an issue tracker, for real issues not a forum for you to discuss your fantastical ideas. We have clear guidelines which you obviously ignored. If you continue to waste our time you will be blocked. Do you understand? . @antonfirsov You've got me there! \ud83d\ude04  \nWe can't afford another round of massive churn after this before V1 so yeah, if we want to implement #142 we should keep the processors internal for now.\nI imagine value type kernels would be the last big task before V1. Do you think you would be able to allocate (haha) time in order to take that on?\n. >We need to decide if we should make it possible to implement it in a 1.* version, without major breaking changes\nIt all depends on how much it will affect the IResampler API. We've got calling overloads in Resize that use the type as a parameter. Resize will probably be our most utilized method so we need to be very careful.\nI'm happy to wait til V2 for #142 also though. \nShip a working version, hopefully make enough money to allow us all to live of this should we choose to and then add everything we've learned from V1* to V2 . @dlemstra Yeah much better I think. What's your thoughts on the rest of the PR?. I've moved Overlays back to Drawing again. I think devs will expect Drawing. @tocsoft   Re. Documentation, Yeah, I would like to write some comprehensive sections on the various image formats, how they work, what they support etc. I really want to make knowledge of things like quantization more accessible to developers since it's so cryptic or absent from System.Drawing.\nThe maximum palette length really is only a concern of the quantizers and the code we had before was pretty hacky internally. . Ok.... \nI've dropped the Dither property on IQuantizer and renamed the DitherType property to Diffuser on both that and IFrameQuantizer<TPixel>. \nQuantizers dither by default and can be easily set to not do so.. I'm tacking on a naming convention change to the API with this PR.\nThe convention is as follows.\n\nKnownXXX. Any open-ended collection of algorithms e.g. KnownQuantizers, KnownResamplers\nXXXMode. Any closed operation enumeration  e.g AnchorPositionMode, FlipMode\nXXXType. Any enumeration of a data type e.g ExifDataType. \n\nI also shifted some primitives I'd missed that are shared by the metadata profiles.\nI know I shouldn't mix and match in a single PR but I forgot to change branch and I'm too tired to untangle the commits. . What's the position on this now. Can I merge it in?. Hey @gordon-matt \nWe don't have the same PixelFormat enumeration as System.Drawing as we use whatever the given TPixel type parameter is to organize the memory layout we operate in. An image could have been stored in indexed format but with Rgba32 we operate in a 32bit space.\nIn our nightlies and soon to be released beta we can help you though.\nWe have a new property PixelTypeInfo on the IImageInfo interface (used by both ImageInfo and Image<TPixel> types) that contains a  property BitsPerPixel representing the number of bits per pixel that the original image was stored in. If that value is greater than 8 you know it's not an indexed image.\n(int)(Math.Pow(2, image.PixelFormat.BitsPerPixel) will give you the palette length.\nIncidentally color palettes are usually padded to match the bits per pixel value so your above code might not give an accurate representation of the actual colors. Only a histogram can truly offer you that.\nHope that all makes sense.\nCheers\nJames\nP.S. Questions are really used for the Gitter channel not the Issue tracker, that's why we have the template, contribution guidelines etc.\n. Hi @jherby2k \nWe can probably do that yes but please in future use the Gitter channel to discuss feature request as described in the contribution guidelines.. No worries, it's just I get the fear every time someone opens up an issue \ud83d\ude28 . Hi @steven-gong \nCan you please try this again using the issue template. We cannot accept issues without them. Thanks, that's much better!\nCan you test the image against the latest build. I'm fairly certain we fixed this since beta 2\nCheers\nJames. Hi @steven-gong @NickyM \nThanks for reporting this.\nThis is interesting. We're actually reading the correct density units from the image but what we are reporting back though is the aspect ratio not the resolution. \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG_File_Interchange_Format#Resolution_and_aspect_ratio\nHere's the second image using aspect ratio density units.\n\nHere's an image using the resolution density units.\n\nI'm wondering whether there is a better way of expressing this. @dlemstra how does ImageMagick report it back to the user?\nPerhaps we should add the following enumeration to the IImageInfo interface?\n``` c#\n    /// \n    /// Provides enumeration of available pixel density units.\n    /// \n    public enum DensityUnits : byte\n    {\n        /// \n        /// No units; width:height pixel aspect ratio = Ydensity:Xdensity\n        /// \n        AspectRatio = 0,\n    /// <summary>\n    /// Pixels per inch (2.54 cm)\n    /// </summary>\n    PixelsPerInch = 1, // Other image formats would default to this.\n\n    /// <summary>\n    /// Pixels per centimeter.\n    /// </summary>\n    PixelsPerCentimeter = 2\n}\n\n```. Hey @steven-gong @NickyM \nI've introduced #649 to improve resolution handling within the library. Once merged you'll also know what unit of measurement is used when querying resolution metadata. \nExplorer is talking absolute nonsense for both the images in this issue.. I'm gonna merge this now as I got the params stuff in.. Perhaps, I could be wrong though and the fix could be super simple.  .

Forgive my ignorance but isn't the masking something that happens now with our Porter Duff operators?. What about the nightlies? We can't really investigate anything from the old beta until we know it's also broken in the nightlies. \n\nI have verified that I am running the latest version of ImageSharp.

We have a Gitter channel for that. . If you can get a working build in the next ten minutes or so I\u2019m happy to add this to the beta we\u2019re packaging up just  now. Ok let\u2019s wait then and release first. I\u2019m reviewing on my phone. . @antonfirsov @tocsoft @dlemstra Any objections to this? LGTM.. OK, now the pointer is pinned I'm gonna merge this in. Thanks for the effort @iamcarbon and thanks everyone for reviewing. \ud83d\udc4d . Please use the issue template. Definitely seems like #504 then. We might have to take a performance hit there to fix it as it\u2019s caused by bad inlining.. @lukapor Can you please confirm for me that the issue exists in release mode only?. @lukapor Did you see @antonfirsov question? It would really help us out if you could provide that info.. Fantastic, thanks, we really appreciate that!. Closing this as #504 is now fixed.. @nfdevil Well there's your problem.\nThe current System.Memory preview version we are depending on is the one on Nuget\nSystem.Memory 4.5.0-preview1-26216-02\nThe version you have in your solution is from the Myget feed which must have breaking changes. \n. Great! I'll close this off now then. Enjoy!. @xakep139 beta3 targets the preview1 dependencies. There's breaking changes in preview2. \n@iamcarbon submitted a PR updating to a couple of days ago so that is now in the nightlies.. The nightlies already are. Haha. You caught me at a good time :smile:. Next 24 hours hopefully . Nuget ImageSharp.Web has not been updated yet and still targets the beta3 of ImageSharp. You probably had the old version of ImageSharp installed. Yup, and if you look at our source you'll see we use MemoryMarshal.Cast throughout.. You\u2019re using beta4 yeah? We could push out another beta if necessary easily enough . I wish I knew what was causing this. All our current released stack should be targeting the RC.. @johnnyoshika see my comment above.\nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/issues/510#issuecomment-393911300\nWe haven't pushed the new ImageSharp.Web yet even on MyGet. There's an open PR I need to review tonight if I can.. You need this update ImageSharp to beta4 and your system references also.. ImageSharp beta4 is on Nuget. You should be able to update to that. . https://www.nuget.org/packages/SixLabors.ImageSharp/1.0.0-beta0004\nImageSharp not ImageSharp.Web. Got some work to do on it first but I\u2019ll try tonight. But swamped of late.. Though we may hold out for the impending beta 5. This week sometime hopefully . Thanks mate! I really appreciate that! . Oh no, again?! Can you point me to the Nuget package? . Ah no, that package is great, it allows Veldrid to load gpu textures via ImageSharp. Just needs an update, I should PR.  . We don't have a released build for beta 5 yet. I'm waiting on some benchmark results.. > We don't have a released build for beta 5 yet. I'm waiting on some benchmark results.\nI really don't want to have to repeat myself again.. The current ToVector4 PackFromVector4 methods produce the same values as MonoGame. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s good reason in gaming engines for those ranges so I would be inclined to keep both.. Yeah, that\u2019s not a bug. We also even show in the example code in the readme that the File API overload requires netstandard 1.3+. >Can you explain why you can't target net451? Usually any code that compiles for netstandard2.0 will also compile against net451!\nThe lowest .NET Framework target version compatible with netstandard 2.0 with the .NET Core 2.0 SDK is 4.6.1\n. @stevehipwell You do understand with an explicit 451 target you're asking us to target a brand new library against an obsolete framework with no security updates available?. @stevehipwell \n\nTargeting net451 will allow better support for .NET 4.5.1, .NET 4.6, Mono 4.6 to 5.2. \n\nAll of those frameworks are supported by Net Standard 1.1 \nI think you are failing to understand exactly what a standard is. I suggest you look again at the picture I posted above.\n\nI don't see the problem in doing so as the framework choice is down to the package consumers who might have a valid reason for requiring net451 (e.g. Windows Server 2008).\n\nYou might not see a problem but I most definitely do. \nTargeting .NET 4.5.1:\n- Adds complexity to the build\n- Can severely limit future development\n- Means that I am now referencing unsupported binaries that may well contain security issues.\nAnd for what? So you can avoid using a FileStream in your consuming code and support an operating system that has another 1 1/2 years of support?\nThere's a sense of entitlement here I am detecting that I find deeply unpleasant. You are asking me to do what a soon to be trillion dollar company will not and cannot do. \nI'm going to lock this issue now and I suggest you have a good think about your attitude towards open source.\n. I'm also torn on this one. But I'm strongly erring toward keeping the target. I'll explain why.\nMy plan has always been to support the various target frameworks for as long as Microsoft do and no longer. \nSince netstandard 1.1 is the lowest target we can build against that gives us support for .NET 4.5.2 I planned to support that until it reached end-of-life.\nAccording to this StackOverflow answer though that means supporting 1.1 until 2023-01-10\nDo I want to support it for that long? That's a long time away!\nRealistically we have to ask ourselves. Does supporting 1.1 actively harm us? It is:\n\nDramatically increasing the development complexity of the library?\nSeverely limiting our ability to improve the performance of the library?\nPreventing future feature development?\n\nI'm inclined to say no to the above questions. \nI absolutely hate having #ifdef's in the codebase (super-super hate) but I think we have gotten off very lightly so far. Microsoft have been brilliant in offering many of the new API's to lower targets so we've been able to capitalize well there. That may change for future performance enhancements (SIMD intrinsics) but I don't know.\nI'm not too concerned about slow Span<T>. We can use Unsafe<T> in hotpaths and keep the performance \"fast enough\". I doubt very much we shall ever be the bottleneck in a legacy targeted application.\nI'm planning on introducing dual licensing very soon and I do want to snag every available potential customer we can. If keeping the target low (lower than any of the competition) helps us do that then great. This project has taken 3 years of my life so far and if I don't get to make a decent living off the back of it I shall be crushed.\n. That\u2019s an excellent suggestion regarding the documentation link. We\u2019ll definitely do that, thanks! \nThere\u2019s also the SimpleGcMemoryManager that doesn\u2019t pool so give that a try also.\nWe\u2019re gonna try everything in our power to reduce the number of allocations for V1 so maybe we can bring the numbers down slightly.\nWe\u2019re also going to work hard on writing the most comprehensive documentation we can think make things as easy as possible to discover and understand. . Please. Questions on Gitter, issues only here.\nThis is also the wrong repository for Middleware.. Hey @mabead can you please use the issue template for opening issues. Thanks!. Fixed with #571 . Last week. No worries, hopefully not too long before we can do a release proper.. If you continue to open issues without using the template I am going to have to block you from the repo. This is incredibly disrespectful.. @mabead Thanks for fixing the issues, I appreciate it! \ud83d\udc4d \nThat's not a bad stat! Hopefully we can figure out what causes the issues quite swiftly and get a fix. The jpeg decoding one's will probably be the most difficult. EXIF, I'm sure we can handle easily enough. . @dlemstra  Yeah? I'll run some local tests to double check but that's great news. Thanks for checking.. I\u2019ll have another look. The decoder itself is super solid now so it\u2019ll be an issue with the EXIF parsing . Should be fixed properly now. Other EXIF fixes will be in as soon as the CI build finishes.. Duplicate of #121 . Looking good! We've got a failing test though that is affecting all test platforms.. Good man! Ever grateful as always! \ud83d\udc4d \nNote to self: We should make sure any of our other libraries using System.Memory do the same. Or introduce it if they're not.. @antonfirsov I've added that link to the main site also.. Getting a commonly failing BytesToGeneric test in net 462 32bit failing at the moment on multiple PR's Any insight into that?. @antonfirsov Have you seen the changes I made to the scan decoder? That fixes the spectral progressive results to make them closer to System.Drawing.\nThe Golang scan parser cannot handle certain images, reporting a bad RST marker when there isn't one and also throwing at no EOI marker when there is one. \nI think we can increase any further accuracy with floating point color transforms and IDCT.\nEDIT.\nThe scan decoder issues in the Golang code might well be caused by the use of byte stuffing outwith the decoder. I would love to be able to introduce that logic into the PDFjs decoder for decoding the Huffman tree but I think it can only go in that direction. I've already tried to move the parsing logic using simple stream reading outwith the decoder into the Golang port and failed miserably. . https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/pull/525/commits/e4a09ab6265aec6602b84b2a09363ae91e927d38\n. @antonfirsov No worries, easy to miss.... They pass! \ud83d\ude04 \nI'll have a look at implementing IRawJpegData, If I get stuck I'll holler.. @antonfirsov Just looked at that interface properly....\n\n. I think we should probably fall back to the LUT approach for non SIMD chipsets like libjpeg turbo does. I got the LUT code from there. . I managed to get the SIMD post processing working. The output is now pretty much perfect and comparable in speed to the Golang decoder.\nHere's the latest benchmark batch.\nMethod | Runtime |                    TestImage |      Mean |       Error |    StdDev | Scaled | ScaledSD |    Gen 0 | Allocated |\n--------------------------------- |-------- |----------------------------- |----------:|------------:|----------:|-------:|---------:|---------:|----------:|\n'Decode Jpeg - System.Drawing' |    Core |  Jpg/baseline/Calliphora.jpg |  7.409 ms |   7.0365 ms | 0.3976 ms |   1.00 |     0.00 | 117.1875 | 254.11 KB |\n'Decode Jpeg - ImageSharp' |    Core |  Jpg/baseline/Calliphora.jpg | 35.561 ms |   6.8921 ms | 0.3894 ms |   4.81 |     0.22 |        - |  46.04 KB |\n'Decode Jpeg - ImageSharp PdfJs' |    Core |  Jpg/baseline/Calliphora.jpg | 37.293 ms |   5.2162 ms | 0.2947 ms |   5.04 |     0.22 |        - |   16.2 KB |\n|         |                              |           |             |           |        |          |          |           |\n'Decode Jpeg - System.Drawing' |    Core | Jpg/baseline/jpeg420exif.jpg | 24.202 ms |  37.9453 ms | 2.1440 ms |   1.00 |     0.00 | 343.7500 | 757.04 KB |\n'Decode Jpeg - ImageSharp' |    Core | Jpg/baseline/jpeg420exif.jpg | 95.730 ms |  54.3914 ms | 3.0732 ms |   3.98 |     0.32 | 250.0000 | 547.05 KB |\n'Decode Jpeg - ImageSharp PdfJs' |    Core | Jpg/baseline/jpeg420exif.jpg | 94.450 ms |  77.0658 ms | 4.3544 ms |   3.92 |     0.33 | 250.0000 | 517.03 KB |\n|         |                              |           |             |           |        |          |          |           |\n'Decode Jpeg - System.Drawing' |     Clr |  Jpg/baseline/Calliphora.jpg |  7.085 ms |   0.2152 ms | 0.0122 ms |   1.00 |     0.00 | 117.1875 | 254.47 KB |\n'Decode Jpeg - ImageSharp' |     Clr |  Jpg/baseline/Calliphora.jpg | 43.173 ms |  34.4280 ms | 1.9452 ms |   6.09 |     0.22 |        - |  49.13 KB |\n'Decode Jpeg - ImageSharp PdfJs' |     Clr |  Jpg/baseline/Calliphora.jpg | 37.125 ms |   7.2886 ms | 0.4118 ms |   5.24 |     0.05 |        - |     19 KB |\n|         |                              |           |             |           |        |          |          |           |\n'Decode Jpeg - System.Drawing' |     Clr | Jpg/baseline/jpeg420exif.jpg | 18.049 ms |   4.3151 ms | 0.2438 ms |   1.00 |     0.00 | 343.7500 | 757.89 KB |\n'Decode Jpeg - ImageSharp' |     Clr | Jpg/baseline/jpeg420exif.jpg | 86.762 ms |  13.9237 ms | 0.7867 ms |   4.81 |     0.06 | 250.0000 | 550.65 KB |\n'Decode Jpeg - ImageSharp PdfJs' |     Clr | Jpg/baseline/jpeg420exif.jpg | 93.774 ms | 115.3087 ms | 6.5152 ms |   5.20 |     0.30 | 250.0000 | 520.51 KB |\nTODO:\n\n[x] Fix failing properties test \n[x] Add tests for Identify()\n[x] Add images from #517 #518 and tests\nTry to speed up non SIMD colorspace transforms.\n[x] General cleanup. @antonfirsov I think we can call this a success! \ud83d\ude04 \n\nI've managed to reduce a lot of the duplication within the scan decoder but don't want to do much with the refs as I think I'll end up hurting the performance.

If we could somehow remove the requirement of the large intermediate Vector4 buffer for resizing that would take a lot of pressure off also.\nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/blob/597f02fc11b3cc689d72a74adbf5d13411e14bf3/src/ImageSharp/Processing/Transforms/Processors/ResizeProcessor.cs#L298\nOriginal inspiration for the resize algorithm manages to avoid it. \nhttp://www.realtimerendering.com/resources/GraphicsGems/gemsiii/filter_rcg.c\n. Yeah I think so. \nIt's only happening sporadically in 32 bit mode which means that the double B property on the Foo test struct is probably failing the equality test. We should be using a custom equality comparer during our equality assertion. . @iamcarbon Do we have any before/after benchmarks for this? Code looks much more sane. As discussed. We need to add the following to IPixel\n``` c#\nPackFromArgb32(Argb32 source)\nToArgb32 (ref Argb32 dest) \n```\nWe also need to add the following to PixelOperations<TPixel>\n``` c#\nPackFromArgb32(ReadOnlySpan source, Span destPixels, int count)\nPackFromArgb32Bytes(ReadOnlySpan sourceBytes, Span destPixels, int count)\nToArgb32(ReadOnlySpan sourcePixels, Span dest, int count)\nToArgb32Bytes(ReadOnlySpan sourceColors, Span destBytes, int count)\n```. Closing this as it's now in the nightlies.. Hi @denisivan0v \nGood catch! I'll get this merged once the CI finished \ud83d\udc4d . No worries! Thanks for the PR! \ud83d\ude04 . @vpenades  You definitely know a lot more about this than I do. Fancy giving a PR a go?. Leave as much detail as you can here describing the required changes and we'll see what we can do.\nA bit rushed myself just now so completely understand.. @dlemstra @antonfirsov @tocsoft Thoughts on this?. That\u2019s my thoughts also chaps, just wanted to make sure I wasn\u2019t missing something. Thanks for your input. \nSorry @Jjag we\u2019ll be sticking with the behaviour as is. Please let us know if you spot anything else. . @Jjagg Love these kind of PR's! They really help with the documentation down the line.. Thanks! I'll review it today. . @jongleur1983 Locally yeah? Make sure you update all your got submodules. There could be reference image changes.. @jongleur1983 @woutware included a fix for your issue in #548 which is now merged so your tests should pass locally now.. Where are we with this PR? I'm seeing lots of reference images missing. \nhttps://ci.appveyor.com/project/six-labors/imagesharp/build/1.0.0-PullRequest00542001291/job/g37aqb2n440iun56. @jongleur1983 Ok no worries, I wanted to make sure you didn't need anything from us. \nLooking forward to seeing this merged in, the output looks amazing! . I've just pushed a bunch of additional tests. This should be ready for review now. . The mutate method is not missing you just need to use the correct namespace. ImageSharp.Processing. I'll have to properly download and have a look. \nI envisioned we would simply alter QuantizedFrame<TPixel> to have an IBuffer<TPixel> for the palette and IBuffer2D for the pixels while making the frame itself implement IDisposable. @iamcarbon  Yeah dithering is slow. Anything you can do to improve that would be great. \nWeeping at resize benchmarks just now. We're much slower than SD again because we do the resize correctly with alpha premultiplication which adds an extra step. . @iamcarbon I think we can speed things up further quite simply by introducing a global color palette option. \nInstead of using the Octree (Or whatever) throughout, and generating a local palette for each frame, when in global mode we could use the PaletteQuantizer to quantize the subsequent frames based on the palette created by the first frame. \nThis should speed up processing, memory consumption, and reduce the file size of the output images. Making it optional (probably default) we can offer local tables for people who need them.. @iamcarbon I'm gonna close in this favour of #637 as I've covered the memory improvements you made plus added another heap of improvements.\nI'd love to see how much faster your crazy gif encodes now!. @antonfirsov Surprising comparison results here. 32bit passing 64 bit failing? WTF?. @antonfirsov Back to you; do your magic please. . >Bottom-LeftOrTop:\n\n\nBottom-RightOrBottom:\n\n@JimBobSquarePants you sure TaperCorner works fine? Isn't it the inverse of the intended? Or I'm getting it wrong?\n\n@antonfirsov I think it's correct. \nIn the first example we are choosing to taper the \"Bottom\" side on either the \"Left\" or \"Top\" corner. Since \"Left\" is possible regardless of whether \"Top\" is impossible \"Left\" is chosen. \nIn the seconds example we are choosing to taper the \"Bottom\" side on either the \"Right\" or \"Bottom\" corner. Since \"Right\" is possible regardless of whether \"Bottom\" is possible \"Right\" is chosen. \nThe original article with source code for the class this is based on can be found here:\nhttp://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2009/07/Taper-Transforms-with-Matrix3DProjection-An-Analytical-Approach.html\nSkiaSharp have an example here:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/user-interface/graphics/skiasharp/transforms/non-affine\nI can attempt to compare against the demos. (Feel free to have a look first though) https://developer.xamarin.com/samples/xamarin-forms/SkiaSharpForms/Demos/\n. Behaviour confirmed \ud83d\ude04 \n\n\n. Yeah I felt a little guilty posting that \ud83d\ude04 \nHere's the comparative images side by side and scaled.\nBottom-LeftOrTop:\n\n\nBottom-RightOrBottom:\n\n\n. Ah no... I can see how this is confusing but the language is correct. \nA classic definition of taper would be \n\nto become progressively smaller toward one end.\n\nYou're tapering towards the bottom edge and choosing which corner to taper with. . \nHaha! \ud83e\udd23 \nIt's amazing really the trouble we've had with this. Will be happy when MS push all their Vector2 fixes.. @antonfirsov Can you have a look over my changes here please. This should be good to pull in for now. If you can figure out why bumping up the MinGetBits const breaks some images that would be lovely, I've added my thoughts to the codebase.\n@iamcarbon Some of this might interest you as the last commit changed the byte reading within the scan decoder to more closely match libjpeg. There's a much better potential for implementing fast Huffman decoding now which could save ~10ms on decoding. I'm stuck but if you are keen to take on the challenge let me know.. Regarding the \u201cTry\u201d changes. Without them the decoder will try to return a value even if it hits the end of a stream within an MCU. Libjpeg uses CheckBits to do th same thing. \nRegarding the JPEG struct. I simply don\u2019t know. There\u2019s no rules to dictate which order markers should be in as far as I\u2019m aware. . Ok, I\u2019m happy to go with that. Will change in a mo.

I'm gonna create a new issue once we get his merged regarding the scan decoder. \nI want to get it replaced eventually and will put my thoughts in the issue.. Merged so closing this. Thanks for the PR! \ud83d\udc4d . @antonfirsov BackgroundColor does operate on all frames.\nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/blob/01d04268d6cc93ea9936274d84397fa9b1b2b0d4/src/ImageSharp/Processing/Overlays/Processors/BackgroundColorProcessor.cs#L43\nWe need it because it performs a different action, doesn't require a brush (therefore can live in ImageSharp) and can operate only on the background layer (i.e you cannot overwrite original color data, only blend against it.)\nIt's super useful for padding out areas of non-transparent image formats following ResizeMode.Pad. I think I get @antonfirsov 's issue with the BackgroundColor as a property. As soon as anyone writes to the image then it becomes invalid. \n@woutware I think we'll have to drop the convenience of the property and simply rely on setting the background color per frame. (This is seriously fine grained stuff anyway so I doubt it will be an issue.)\n. We're nearly there with this, looking forward to seeing it merged! \ud83d\udc4d . Thanks @woutware for taking the time to put this together. Much appreciated! \ud83d\udc4d . Have you compared the output of the encoder saving to a file to the redecoded output from your image viewer? Encoding the byte array to a string simply encoded the bytes, the method is lossless.. @z-tc Hello?. Ah awesome, good to know, thanks! \ud83d\ude04 . Jpegs don't support opacity.. \ud83d\ude04 Happens to the best of us. \nThanks for filling in the issue template properly though, really appreciate it \ud83d\udc4d . @antonfirsov Whenever you think something is good merge away! :smile:. @JBildstein Was hoping you'd see this. What would be indicative in the header that the profile is corrupt. I'm assuming it's reported length is greater than Int32.MaxValue?. Ooft! This is great! We can now finally expose the memory API's we need for interop and per row augmentation. . @JBildstein If you were able to PR something that would be really useful. I still don't know the inner workings of ICC profiles yet to do a good job.. You rock! \ud83e\udd18 . @antonfirsov I'm up for that. I'll create a milestone and we can attach issues..

Hi @AtwindYu \nThanks for raising this issue. Would it be possible to add an image demonstrating the blurring? \nCheers\nJames. Is that alph9 in the image a version number?. Could you answer my question above please? That looks like you\u2019re printing using an alpha.. Are you connected to the right Myget feed for the nightlies? (It\u2019s linked from the README) Alpha 9 is a very old version number from the old MyGet feed.\nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/blob/master/README.md#installation\n. That\u2019s what I\u2019m finding confusing. I\u2019ll need to try to recreate locally but I want to make sure I have all the relevant info first. . @AtwindYu That all make sense now. Thanks for the updated sample and detail. That\u2019s really really helpful. :+1:. Issue confirmed using current latest of all packages from nightlies.\nxml\n    <PackageReference Include=\"SixLabors.Core\" Version=\"1.0.0-ci0007\" />\n    <PackageReference Include=\"SixLabors.Fonts\" Version=\"1.0.0-ci0022\" />\n    <PackageReference Include=\"SixLabors.ImageSharp\" Version=\"1.0.0-dev001327\" />\n    <PackageReference Include=\"SixLabors.ImageSharp.Drawing\" Version=\"1.0.0-dev001327\" />\n    <PackageReference Include=\"SixLabors.Shapes\" Version=\"1.0.0-ci0018\" />\n    <PackageReference Include=\"SixLabors.Shapes.Text\" Version=\"1.0.0-ci0018\" />\n\n. Closing now as in nightlies. Looking at the linked issue I think it's safe to say we can close this now. Thanks for raising the issue and providing so much information.. @Leonardo-Ferreira @antonfirsov \nI do have a plan I want to enact which would allow loading a whole suite of new pixel formats. It might not make v1 though. . Ok.. With any of the latest dev builds  you can use the SixLabors.ImageSharp.ColorSpaces.Conversion.ColorSpaceConverter to bulk convert a span of Rgba32 or Rgb24 to Cmyk and back again.\n. @brianpopow Good work! We should double check our other blittable types. Rgba32 Rgb24, Bgr24, and Argb32.. Ok, let's leave it at that, no point changing working code. \nI've just updated your PR from master, will merge once it's built.. Haha there\u2019s plenty of them already in the codebase.. @antonfirsov That sounds like a plan to me. Let\u2019s do it :+1:. Thanks @bpopow \nLooks similar to #559 and #562 @JBildstein over to you \ud83d\ude09 . Those failing tests scare the crap out of me. We\u2019re already having to do workarounds for things that should just work cos MS aren\u2019t testing robustly enough across chipsets. I\u2019d hate to think this is more of that. . I've checked this with beta 5 exporting at both 24 and 32 bit and the output is as expected with the correct alpha.\n\n. Hi @jtorjo \nCould you please add an example of your expected output vs the actual?. That's very odd. I'm not able to replicate the issue.\nIs that code sample complete? You're passing a double to the method which wont compile.\nBefore\n\nAfter\n\n. @jtorjo No worries, it happens. I'm just relieved! \ud83d\ude04 . WTF Travis! . There's a bug somewhere in the PR. \ud83d\ude41 Tests are failing locally.. Yeah those tests need rewriting. The initial tests were copied from monogame. I keep planning on cleaning them up but it\u2019s a time consuming job. . CLosing these as I don't think we have any more skipped tests and all the pixel formats have been rewritten anyway.. Can you update to beta 4 and see how you get on please?. @spawnkid That\u2019s not the same exception. You\u2019ve got reference issues. . @Tarek-Samy Heads up. There's a new update from MS where they specifically recommend a minimum of NET Framework 4.7.2 When referencing netstandard 2.0 binaries. \nThat's out of our hands now. You'll have to upgrade.. @Splamy top notch work, Well done! \ud83d\udc4d \nI just had a look at the Mono issue tracker and the issue hasn't been raised there so I will go ahead and copy your issue across there. Hopefully they can provide a workaround because I cannot see one. \nDo you have the Mono version?. Looks like Mono will be porting in CoreFX code\nhttps://github.com/mono/mono/issues/6974. @Splamy @baulig Our overridden Read method will return 0 yes, but from DeflateStream only when it reaches the end of the stream.\nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/blob/301c2cec662169bb330ac74c1bb44a9943885586/src/ImageSharp/Formats/Png/Zlib/ZlibInflateStream.cs#L111\nI'll need someone to confirm the chunk lengths reported back for the IDAT chunks for the test image in Mono. That way I can ensure that whatever odd behavior is happening to return 0 is definitely happening in the DeflateStream. \nThey should be 65535 and 43423. @TodesBrot No, that'll be a stream issue. The error is thrown when a format cannot be established. . No worries, Happens all the time \ud83d\ude04 . Closing this now Mono have fixed it. \nhttps://github.com/mono/mono/pull/10329. Guard should be internal. We should fix that. @hypeartist Very useful indeed! I've got something I can debug against now. Thanks!. I had another look at StbImage and managed to decode our Calliphora jpeg. It's a lot faster but there's inaccuracy in the spectral output compared to our current implementation. I think it might be better to try to improve our existing decoder instead of attempting a new port. . If you could pull the off I would be blown away! Have a look at our code, it should just be the huffman decoder you need to port. . It\u2019s totally up to you but we\u2019ve already got all the marker parsing code in place plus we have SIMD optimized IDCT and colorspace conversion code.\nAs far as I understand the Mozjpeg source it\u2019s only two jdhuff files to port. Brilliant thanks! . @antonfirsov Perhaps, yeah... Naming is hard, it's the Scan segment we're decoding but it's Huffman encoded. \nThose two sections will definitely be slowing us down. \n\n\nTryReadBit() We should be working with a 4-byte buffer that gets cleared out when we hit a restart marker. \n\n\nTryDecodeHuffman should be using a LUT for most of the returned results. Something like 95% of the code values should hit that LUT. \n\n\nThere's established practises that we should definitely be trying to adapt from MozJpeg, I just haven't managed to get it working with restart markers.. @antonfirsov @hypeartist @saucecontrol\nSo I revisited this problem this morning and took another look at porting the huffman decoder from StbSharp. \nCheck out the ScanDecoder.cs class in the new-jpeg-scan-decoder branch.\nI'm actually getting somewhere! \nI'm working on baseline currently, with 6/10 tests passing with spectral accuracy. I think the failing tests are due to me not reading the correct byte following a marker (I could be wrong though).\nI could really do with another pair of eyes on the problem as I think once we have baseline ported, progressive will follow swiftly. It's definitely worth it imo as without any additional optimisation the port is already yielding healthy performance improvements (PdfJs Port). \n```\nBenchmarkDotNet=v0.10.14, OS=Windows 10.0.17134\nIntel Core i7-6600U CPU 2.60GHz (Skylake), 1 CPU, 4 logical and 2 physical cores\nFrequency=2742192 Hz, Resolution=364.6718 ns, Timer=TSC\n.NET Core SDK=2.1.300\n  [Host]     : .NET Core 2.0.7 (CoreCLR 4.6.26328.01, CoreFX 4.6.26403.03), 64bit RyuJIT\n  Job-JQBLQX : .NET Framework 4.7.1 (CLR 4.0.30319.42000), 64bit RyuJIT-v4.7.3110.0\n  Job-UIHOCS : .NET Core 2.0.7 (CoreCLR 4.6.26328.01, CoreFX 4.6.26403.03), 64bit RyuJIT\nLaunchCount=1  TargetCount=3  WarmupCount=3\n                       Method | Runtime |                    TestImage |      Mean |      Error |    StdDev | Scaled | ScaledSD |    Gen 0 | Allocated |\n\n--------------------------------- |-------- |----------------------------- |----------:|-----------:|----------:|-------:|---------:|---------:|----------:|\n   'Decode Jpeg - System.Drawing' |     Clr |  Jpg/baseline/Calliphora.jpg |  7.280 ms |   2.821 ms | 0.1594 ms |   1.00 |     0.00 | 117.1875 | 254.47 KB |\n       'Decode Jpeg - ImageSharp' |     Clr |  Jpg/baseline/Calliphora.jpg | 36.378 ms |  12.269 ms | 0.6932 ms |   5.00 |     0.12 |        - |  52.63 KB |\n 'Decode Jpeg - ImageSharp PdfJs' |     Clr |  Jpg/baseline/Calliphora.jpg | 28.817 ms |  33.441 ms | 1.8895 ms |   3.96 |     0.22 |        - |  25.25 KB |\n                                  |         |                              |           |            |           |        |          |          |           |\n   'Decode Jpeg - System.Drawing' |    Core |  Jpg/baseline/Calliphora.jpg |  8.807 ms |  13.427 ms | 0.7587 ms |   1.00 |     0.00 | 117.1875 | 254.11 KB |\n       'Decode Jpeg - ImageSharp' |    Core |  Jpg/baseline/Calliphora.jpg | 37.305 ms |  12.295 ms | 0.6947 ms |   4.26 |     0.31 |        - |  47.73 KB |\n 'Decode Jpeg - ImageSharp PdfJs' |    Core |  Jpg/baseline/Calliphora.jpg | 29.534 ms |  19.468 ms | 1.1000 ms |   3.37 |     0.26 |        - |   21.5 KB |\n                                  |         |                              |           |            |           |        |          |          |           |\n   'Decode Jpeg - System.Drawing' |     Clr | Jpg/baseline/jpeg420exif.jpg | 18.796 ms |  12.260 ms | 0.6927 ms |   1.00 |     0.00 | 343.7500 | 757.89 KB |\n       'Decode Jpeg - ImageSharp' |     Clr | Jpg/baseline/jpeg420exif.jpg | 88.237 ms |  20.475 ms | 1.1569 ms |   4.70 |     0.15 | 250.0000 | 564.65 KB |\n 'Decode Jpeg - ImageSharp PdfJs' |     Clr | Jpg/baseline/jpeg420exif.jpg | 61.836 ms |  15.687 ms | 0.8863 ms |   3.29 |     0.10 | 250.0000 | 535.01 KB |\n                                  |         |                              |           |            |           |        |          |          |           |\n   'Decode Jpeg - System.Drawing' |    Core | Jpg/baseline/jpeg420exif.jpg | 19.141 ms |  16.113 ms | 0.9104 ms |   1.00 |     0.00 | 343.7500 | 757.04 KB |\n       'Decode Jpeg - ImageSharp' |    Core | Jpg/baseline/jpeg420exif.jpg | 94.172 ms | 130.098 ms | 7.3508 ms |   4.93 |     0.37 | 250.0000 | 548.71 KB |\n 'Decode Jpeg - ImageSharp PdfJs' |    Core | Jpg/baseline/jpeg420exif.jpg | 64.507 ms |  37.116 ms | 2.0971 ms |   3.38 |     0.16 | 250.0000 | 522.28 KB |\n``. 9/10 working now. OnlyMultiScanBaselineCMYK.jpgto go.. Got both baseline and progressive working!! Latest changes pushed to the branch, will cleanup code asap.. Different tests failing nowRgba64toBgr24andRgba32` weird!. @brianpopow Nice detective work! \ud83e\udd47 \nAs long as we can interop with MonoGame's Rgba64 I'm happy with using double. \nHowever, I would suggest changing the Pack method and keeping the current constructor intact.\nWe should probably raise an issue with MonoGame also. . Agreed. I think we should be safe to merge this and move on. \n@brianpopow Thanks for making such an awesome effort to refactor these tests and investigate issues. It must have been a chore of a job!. If we believe that the Span API's will provide us with enough performance improvements in the other codecs I'm happy for this to go in. Eventually we would be able to remove the definitions as the API's eventually becomes standard which I am sure they will.\nWe do have to be careful though. A scatter of ifdefs in the codecs are ok, elsewhere though I think is a definite no-no.. @antonfirsov Agree with both points. \ud83d\udc4d . Looks like some assembly binding issues in the tests for netcore. Looks good though me, hopefully we can beef up our CI server soon. I\u2019ll chase up our DNF application. . HI @davidliang2008 \nThanks for filling out such a complete issue. It's really great to see! \ud83d\udc4d \nIt looks to me like the crop method is working as expected, a negative crop is technically is not a crop, it's a pad.\nIt looks to me, in your second example, like you need to use the Resize method passing the ResizeOptions. With that you can choose ResizeMode.BoxPad combined with the appropriate AnchorPosition to preserve the crop but pad out the image to the expected size.\nDoes that make sense?\nCheers\nJames\n. I'm planning on writing a full tutorial on resizing images to accompany the API documentation to make it all very clear. It's just a matter of getting the time together though. \ud83d\ude41 \nWould it be possible for you to provide the actual parameter values you are passing to the methods so I can recreate locally? Expected result images would be really useful also. I should be able to piece you together a solution then and tweak the code if need be.\nThose centre coordinates are used when using ResizeMode.Crop to shift the center point when cropping pixels that fall outwith the aspect ratio. All the default values can be found by looking at the source code for now. . Thanks for the extra info, I'm going to run some tests ASAP. \nIn the interim it might be an idea for you to have a look at the DrawImage API. Looking at your expected output this looks like the most appropriate tool to me.\nYou should be able to crop your image then place it wherever you like on the canvas.. >With DrawImage API, it seems like I can hack around and get what I want. But I would love to see changes in .Resize() call so that the gaps on the left and top are preserved @JimBobSquarePants \ud83d\udc4d .\nThen we would be misappropriating Resize(). It's a scaling operation only and always should be.\nSame with Crop(). I'll be changing the method to throw an ArgumentOutOfRangeException if the coordinates are negative.\nDrawImage() is the correct API to use. You're arbitrarily positioning the cropped image on the location of a canvas. That's exactly what the method is for.\nThink about it, all the System.Drawing methods are actually DrawImage under the surface.\nAnyway, glad you got it sorted and were able to build what you wanted, it looks really neat! \ud83d\udc4d \nI'll keep this open while I make my sanitation changes.. @saefren\nI can\u2019t possibly imagine where you get the idea that this library aims to be an alternative to either of the mentioned libraries. It\u2019s unfathomable, quite an extraordinary leap. \nAsk yourself this. How would you do that operation in System.Drawing or in SkiaSharp? Would you expect them to do all the work for you? \nImageSharp is a 2D graphics API that offers low level functionality. It\u2019s used as a basis for algorithms. That means you have to do some work yourself.\nCrop is crop is crop. We cut off the parts you don\u2019t want. \nYou\u2019re right about the dimensions though, we should be throwing in both. . > Well no, I would not expect System.Drawing to do this but this library is not on the same 'level'?\nWhich library are you referring to now? If ImageSharp then yes, it is the equivalent of System.Drawing.\nWhy are you commenting on a repository about a completely unrelated library?. Hey @marcpabst \nGlad we were able to help you. Just a note to say would you please use the Gitter channel for future questions? We're trying to stay on top of the issue tracker here and limiting it to issues only. \ud83d\ude09 \nThanks!. I wonder... would creating a raw 1x1px Argb image and saving it do the same thing? Will help us rule out the load method then.. Thanks @jongleur1983 That's exactly what we need here.. Hi @bpopow \nThanks for this; yeah great suggestion! \nWe should support these bit depths. We'll have to do some work first though. \nCurrently we can decode 16 bit Rgb and Rgba pngs but we actually cheat when we do so and reduce the pixel data into an 8 bit equivalent. \nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/blob/cdc63adb9469d4bc654601fe16398138c4c6ca50/src/ImageSharp/Formats/Png/PngDecoderCore.cs#L733\nTo do this properly we should probably add the API to convert to/from Rgba64, create an Rgb48 pixel format, with additional methods and map these values. We'll eventually have to add write support also as there's no point having readonly data if we can't preserve it.\nWill need some help doing this though, I'm a bit swamped with infrastructural work at the moment.\nNotes: \nThe scaled vector methods should help us here with conversion from Rgba64 and Rgb48.\nCheers\nJames. Implementation specification notes.\nhttp://ftp-osl.osuosl.org/pub/libpng/documents/pngext-1.5.0.html#C.eXIf. @brianpopow Ah fantastic, Thanks! \nYeah our EXIF API is nicely decoupled from the individual image formats so once you have reading/writing the chunk identifiers it should work immediately.. I thought we had optimized this! Was confused it was still an issue.\nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/blob/cdc63adb9469d4bc654601fe16398138c4c6ca50/src/ImageSharp.Drawing/Processing/Drawing/Processors/FillProcessor.cs#L56. @antonfirsov @tocsoft @dlemstra and anyone else reading this.\nI've got the fundamentals in place for reading 16 bit png's but need some help on the writing side. \nI need to figure out a way to set both the bit depth and the color type when encoding without complex sanitation to ensure that the values are correct. \ne.g A 2 color palette image is never going to be a 16 bit image. \nI'm stuck figuring it out.\nScratch that, enums to the rescue!. Failing tests are due to me changing png encoder grayscale conversion algorithm to ITU-R recommendation 709  matching the libpng implementation.\nWill reference images tomorrow and add specific bitdepth reference images plus tests.. @antonfirsov Yup, as long as the image pixel format is of high enough resolution then the accuracy is maintained. We\u2019ll have Rgb48 and Rgba64 now to make that easier.. This is ready to review now. \nSorry about the size of this chaps but it turned out adding two new pixel formats with associated operations was a big job touching everywhere.\nI had a hell of a time with image comparison as I had to switch to comparing using Rgba64 and I had to get rid of the System.Drawing comparer for pngs as it was losing accuracy on decode. \nAnyway, it works, we now have full 16 bit support.. @antonfirsov The CRC won't tell us enough to determine things are correct, only that the compressed data integrity is ok so we can ignore that. I'll revert the reference decoder changes though and do some cleanup there and I'll use tolerance for the 16 bit ones. Using Rgba32 as our pixel format might actually preserve the same data.\nI also just double checked the rgb-16-alpha.png image using BeyondCompare and it's an exact match so that's ok.\n@dlemstra If you could rig something in the tests to bridge between an Magick.NET image and ours that would be amazing!. Hey @antonfirsov Can you do me a biggie and have a look at the image comparison code? The new font tests are failing with some pretty big differences after the merge. It could be rounding errors creeping in during conversion to/from Rgba64 but it could be something different. \nPerhaps we should use different comparers for 16 bit and 8 bit pixels formats?\ne.g.\n```\nFontShapesAreRenderedCorrectly_LargeText(provider: Solid2480x3508_(255,255,255,25\nSixLabors.ImageSharp.Tests.TestUtilities.ImageComparison.ImageDifferenceIsOverThresholdException : Image difference is over threshold!\nReport ImageFrame 0: \nTotal difference: 0.1764%\n[\u0394(1542,1542,1542,0) @ (819,6)];\n[\u0394(-1542,-1542,-1542,0) @ (822,6)];\n[\u0394(1285,1285,1285,0) @ (832,6)];\n[\u0394(2570,2570,2570,0) @ (833,6)];\n[\u0394(1542,1542,1542,0) @ (834,6)]...\n``. @antonfirsov No need to look over theImageComprarerit's correct. There was something, not quite right about the text drawing reference images that made them different. I recreated them and everything works.. Merging this, it's solid and blocking other work.. <strike>Looks like theFontShapesAreRenderedCorrectly` test is failing.\nAh you know this already though, didn't spot the unticked checkbox.. where TKey : IEquatable<TKey> nothing worse that slow lookups.. I'll leave this one for @dlemstra to review but I'm thinking we should make the EXIF00 bytes the sole responsibility of the jpeg format if it's unused in png.. @brianpopow Looks great to me \ud83d\udc4d thanks for persevering!\n@dlemstra Would you be able to cast your eye over it just to be certain I haven't missed anything?. @brianpopow I'm going to have a look at this PR this evening and fix the merge conflicts and any final tweaks, thanks for being so patient with us and helping out! \ud83d\udc4d . Ok merging this now as it all looks good to me.  Thanks @brianpopow for adding this, much appreciated! \ud83d\udc4d . All good now, @antonfirsov I'll leave you to merge. \ud83d\udc4d . SixLabors.ImageSharp.Processing?. Yeah we\u2019ve been keeping them internal to work on the API. Is there something missing from the current edge detection processors? We could work together to fix that? . Perhaps we should make that operation an Enum? . I'll have to have a look to see if we can use separableness without breaking anything. Feel free to have a dig around yourself.  . Hi @peter-bozovic \nThere's nothing implemented just now, who knows in the future?\nPlease don't use the issue tracker for questions. We have a Gitter channel for such.\nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp#questions\nCheers\nJames. That works for me. We don\u2019t want to be encouraging allocations by making it easy. Turns out we were throwing when we didn't need to. Those progressive images have DHT markers with no following data, but the code could already handle that. I'll merge the PR as soon as it builds.. @mariansam That should be unnecessary.\n@jeffreyleblanc225 Can you confirm that you are not trying to execute on a lower framework version than the target environment? I.E. Does it only have .NET 4.0 installed?. Hi @SamVanheer \nNo plans as yet, we're concentrating on common formats System.Drawing can open. Maybe post V1.\nCheers\nJames\nP.S. Question on the Gitter channel please.. @TodesBrot A couple of issues here with your tests.\n\nYou don't dispose of any of your images yet clone for each frame. This adds pressure to the GC.\nYou're using inaccurate time methods to determine the benchmark result.\n\nThat said, I am aware of some performance issues with the gif encoder (unrelated to dithering, we're allocating where we shouldn't and don't handle global color tables) which I have a PR coming for.\nRestoreToBackground has no effect on encoding. What you are probably seeing is the consequence of that GC pressure as we do extra work on decoding.\nI think it's best here if you understand quite how much extra work goes into dithering.\nDithering is traditionally a serial process with and error calculation passed to neighbouring pixels (bottom, right) that depends on the result of the previous pixel calculation. This dramatically improves the output quality of a palette encoded image We're arguably better than PngQuant at quantization + dithering.\nThe default dithering algorithm we use is the popular Floyd-Steinberg algorithm developed in 1975. This is represented by the following matrix:\nc#\n{ 0, 0, 7 },\n{ 3, 5, 1 }\nFor each pixel in the quantized image we have to perform 5 separate operations. 1 on the input pixel and 1 for each of the 4 neighbours. This, of course, adds a lot of processing overhead. Which is unavoidable if you want serious quality (Check out a System.Drawing gif sometime, you'll claw your eyes out.). \nNow it may be possible for us to make that a parallel process. According to this document I found anyway but we'll have to see whether it's possible to implement this.\nFor some images, dithering is not the correct choice. If you have blocky edges, for example like in your sprite. I would turn off dithering. We've chosen to enable dithering by default as most gifs have softer edges and require much higher quality output than sprites.\nSo... It might be possible to speed up dithering (I'd really like to) but we're going to be no slower with our dithering approach currently than anyone else.. @TodesBrot with #637 I've managed to make gif encoding about 6x faster than it was previously. Output quality is improved also.. Should be fixed now with #637. Thanks @Jjagg this would be a great improvement.\nJust a quick note. IImageProcessor implementations should be separate from codecs so any behaviour should be written as part of the codec codebase itself.. @antonfirsov Looks like there a couple of problems to solve here.\n\nWe need to avoid allocating large buffers and conduct a thorough review of various known allocation hotspots. \nResize #642, \nWuFrameQuantizer<T>, \nJpegPostProcessor family \nReview our GetPixelSpan<T>() and GetPixelMemory<T>() API's as it looks like the limit is 2GB https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/26603 which mearns we fall far short of theoretical limits for jpeg for example at 65535 x 65535. ReadOnlySequence<T> does look to me like what we should expose but I don't know yet how we interop that with things like System.Drawing.\nShould we still have issues after the above, provide a neat way to warn when those limits are exceeded during allocation.\n\nI'd additionally consider dropping the RgbaVector pixel format as that of limited use with no codecs able to preserve the information anyway.\nWhen do we do part 2 though? 1.0 seems the safest bet but how long would that take?. Ok. Good to review once tests have passed.. Hey @iamcarbon Check this, 6x speedup!\nWith the new global palette mode we're down to 56 seconds with 11.3Mb output.\n\nWith the local palette mode it's 1 minute with 13Mb output.\n\nHere's the two images to compare. Local, of course is flawless, global suffers slightly since the image reuses the palette from the first frame.\ngifs.zip. Ok chum, looking forward to seeing a new one in the future, I think it's a great addition to the library!. Looks good! Nice to see the codebase becoming really clean!. @vpenades Are all these blend modes covered by the SVG spec? If so, perhaps we can use that as a definitive reference. \nI must admit, I currently know very little on the subject, hence my lack of response. . @vpenades Wouldn't that be an issue with the implementation itself? I would consider our equality operators are doing the correct thing. . ```\n        public static Vector4 In(Vector4 dst, Vector4 src, Vector4 blend)\n        {\n            float alpha = dst.W * src.W; \n        Vector4 color = src * alpha;                  // premultiply\n        color /= MathF.Max(alpha, Constants.Epsilon); // unpremultiply\n        color.W = alpha;\n\n        return color;\n    }\n\n```\nIn the above sample if dst.W * src.W is equal to 0 then the color is already <0,0,0,0> before you unpremultiply, the only thing you are avoiding by adding the MathF.Max  is color becoming <NaN, NaN, NaN, 0> which gets converted to <0,0,0,0> when packing back from the vector anyway.\nIt looks to me like the reference image is incorrect and the test output is actually expected since the algorithm can only operate in the RGB space and input image is masking RGB values with an opacity of 0. If the reference image actually used transparent pixels instead of masking then I would expect the images to match.\nNot sure about the above now. The algorithm above doesn't seem to match the SVG spec.\nNote I have no idea what Dca nor X, Y, Z mean sing the spec writers helpfully decided to not define them.\n```\nf(Sc,Dc) = Dc\nX        = 1\nY        = 0\nZ        = 0\nDca' = Dca \u00d7 Sa Da'  = Sa \u00d7 Da \n```\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/SVGCompositing/#comp-op-dst-in. >So, you assume if Alpha is 0, the RGB must be zero too? both for input and output of functions?\nNot quite, I'll annotate your sample to explain what I mean. Apologies for confusion.\n``` c#\n        public static Vector4 In(Vector4 dst, Vector4 src, Vector4 blend)\n        {\n            float alpha = dst.W * src.W; \n       // If alpha here is 0 then color = Vector4.Zero since you are multiplying by 0;\n        Vector4 color = src * alpha;                  // premultiply \n        color /= MathF.Max(alpha, Constants.Epsilon); // unpremultiply\n        color.W = alpha;\n\n        return color;\n    }\n\n``. @vpenades  We've got failing tests inSolidFillBlendedShapesTests`. Can you double check your output and update https://github.com/SixLabors/Imagesharp.Tests.Images/pull/1 accordingly.\nhttps://ci.appveyor.com/project/six-labors/imagesharp/build/1.0.0-PullRequest00641001725/job/ep7txx8yph2spk81/tests. @vpenades Yeah it's simply due to the missing images. That's ok just now though and I don't want to add the complication of messing with the build scripts to get them working. Regarding the test images. Yeah, we'll probably end up moving them back in.\nThanks for the explanation on the other images btw, I found this from the IBM Developer Works documentation and example code with which we could theoretically use to generate comparison images. \nhttps://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-mer0918/index.html\nLooking at the new output though. There's one image that strikes me as odd.\n_1DarkBlueRect_2BlendHotPinkRect_3BlendSemiTransparentRedEllipse_mode-DestAtop\n\nI would expect only the part of the destination image that overlaps the source image to be drawn with the part of the source image that doesn't overlap the destination image drawn also. Maybe I'm missing something though? \nThe other example reflects that expected behaviour.\n_1DarkBlueRect_2BlendBlackEllipse_mode-DestAtop\n\n. @vpenades Ah yes! Great explanation. It makes perfect sense now. \nIt's really interesting to look at that with the explanation in mind. Once you focus inside the rectangular bounds of the ellipse it's exactly how I'd expect it. \nI think I'm happy with this and will give it one last pass before merging it and the test images in. \nThanks for taking the effort to figure out what is what I consider to be mind-boggling subject and thanks for pushing us to include it in the library \ud83d\udc4d . >Personally, I would split it into two enumerations, which would be an API breaking change.\nThen we would most definitely need to introduce this before RC1.. @antonfirsov I'm assigning this one to you for now since you're more likely to get it right than me. Hoping someone from the community will step up though and give us a breather.. Nice changes! That class looks very clean now and I like the inline and error helpers!\nHow the hell does S.D decode the full stream so damn quickly, it's infuriating!. I'm gonna merge this now to work on namespacing.. @brianpopow Definitely! I'd love to get a common set of histogram based operations put together.. JPEG or PNG? . Ah it's just that you said PNG in the issue description \ud83d\ude04 \nLooks like we're being overzealous with our ICC check. Time to consult the expert...\n@JBildstein What do you think? I would have thought the IsValid() check should just return false?. You rock! \ud83e\udd18 . @iamcarbon Nice work with the colorspaces! \ud83d\udc4d . Ready for review.. Failing build seems to be an Appveyor bug. Failed to upload artifacts.. @antonfirsov I actually thought this would be more disruptive than I thought but looking at the source it might well be ok. @funcylambda You have my blessing.\nWe'll have to also update ICloningImageProcessor<TPixel>.CloneAndApply.. My only issue with this is that it's not really a fair comparison as long as we are premultiplying. \nI wonder why we are getting slower perf on Core? I've noticed that on many of our benchmarks recently.. @tzachshabtay I think it should move to options yes. It adds a lot of overhead. . Feel free to merge whenever . @iamcarbon \nI wonder.... Should we just add any missing color spaces to the Colorful API and just ditch our implementation? With the improvements you made to that library for 2.0 it must be getting faster now and it's more accurate than we are since we only use single precision?\nWe could also add some bulk conversion methods I've been adding in another branch.\nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/blob/7c5343ab808c80fa311aa070210530b1cbdd607a/src/ImageSharp/ColorSpaces/Conversion/ColorSpaceConverter.CieLab.cs#L46\nCurrently we have, and they lack.\n\nHsl\nHsv\nYCbCr\nCmyk\n\nWhat do you think?.

I suggest you use that. . > - [X] I have verified that I am running the latest version of ImageSharp\nImageSharp version: v1.0.0-alpha9-00194 is not the latest version by a long way. In fact, we never released any alphas on Nuget so the version you are using is not supported by us..\nThe latest release on Nuget is beta4. Update to that version and your issue will go away.\n. You mean the MyGet repository for developmental build? That changed when the repository moved to the SixLabors organization. It's linked from the readme.\nhttps://www.myget.org/feed/sixlabors/package/nuget/SixLabors.ImageSharp\nI linked to the Nuget beta when commented above.. Still tons of work to do here to improve tests coverage. API itself is sound though I believe.. >1. IColorConversion and implementations\nNo color converter is used through the IColorConversion interface, which raises the question whether it's a meaningful abstraction. Can we imagine an actual use case, where a user actually needs an abstract TFrom -> TResult colorspace converter?\n\n\nIf not: we should remove the interface, and turn all converters into one of the following: \nStatic classes taking the whitepoint as a parameter\nStructs taking whitepoint at construction time\nIf yes: Bulk conversion should be part of the API to avoid per-pixel virtual calls\n\n\nIColorConversion<TFrom, TResult>  is used to enforce the conversion rule only. It's never called directly so there's no virtual calls to avoid. We could simply remove it with the individual classes static however they are currently only initialized once as the converter is initialized.\nThe bulk conversion calls are currently part of the ColorSpaceConverter class API since some of the per-pixel methods require adaptation. \n\n\nIChromaticAdaptation and VonKriesChromaticAdaptation\nSame as 1.: Do we need the abstraction? If yes, we need to move bulk operations here.\n\n\nYes, we need the abstraction, there's potentially more adaptation classes to add. I don't see how we could add the bulk transforms to that interface since it is called as part of a per-pixel conversion process. \n\n\nThe code is full of on-the-fly per-pixel converter class allocations now.\nWe should avoid (re)instantiation of converters when doing bulk conversion (see comments in 1.)\n\n\nAs far as I'm aware everything is only allocated once, when ColorSpaceConverter is initialized. \nI'm considering making ColorSpaceConverter immutable and passing an options class to the constructor. That would remove all of the checking logic that takes place internally and simplify things. \nI'm not sure about doing anything more dramatic than that (adding the adapter or whitepoint as a parameter to conversion etc).\nBear in mind we're already 4x faster than the Colorful library this API is based on. . @antonfirsov  Current state of play - CieXyz To CieLab following latest immutability changes.\n```\n// * Summary *\nBenchmarkDotNet=v0.10.14, OS=Windows 10.0.17134\nIntel Core i7-6600U CPU 2.60GHz (Skylake), 1 CPU, 4 logical and 2 physical cores\nFrequency=2742189 Hz, Resolution=364.6722 ns, Timer=TSC\n.NET Core SDK=2.1.300\n  [Host]     : .NET Core 2.0.9 (CoreCLR 4.6.26614.01, CoreFX 4.6.26614.01), 64bit RyuJIT\n  DefaultJob : .NET Core 2.0.9 (CoreCLR 4.6.26614.01, CoreFX 4.6.26614.01), 64bit RyuJIT\n           Method |       Mean |     Error |   StdDev | Scaled | ScaledSD |\n\n--------------------- |-----------:|----------:|---------:|-------:|---------:|\n  'Colourful Convert' | 1,090.0 ns | 24.385 ns | 71.52 ns |   1.00 |     0.00 |\n 'ImageSharp Convert' |   199.5 ns |  4.735 ns | 13.81 ns |   0.18 |     0.02 |\n// * Hints *\nOutliers\n  ColorspaceCieXyzToCieLabConvert.'Colourful Convert': Default  -> 1 outlier  was  removed\n  ColorspaceCieXyzToCieLabConvert.'ImageSharp Convert': Default -> 2 outliers were removed\n// * Legends *\n  Mean     : Arithmetic mean of all measurements\n  Error    : Half of 99.9% confidence interval\n  StdDev   : Standard deviation of all measurements\n  Scaled   : Mean(CurrentBenchmark) / Mean(BaselineBenchmark)\n  ScaledSD : Standard deviation of ratio of distribution of [CurrentBenchmark] and [BaselineBenchmark]\n  1 ns     : 1 Nanosecond (0.000000001 sec)\n// * BenchmarkRunner: End **\n// * Artifacts cleanup \n```. Good spot regarding the allocation. I'll remove that. \nMy concern with moving the comparison and validation code out of the loop is that there is then no way to enforce that the output is the expected one when a span of CieXyz structs with varying whitepoint values is passed to the bulk method. \nI'd love to remove the branching and allow SIMD optimization but I can't, hand-on-heart state that we won't come up against that scenario.\nRegarding the validation, I'm wondering whether we should throw at all, we could simple return the input color.\nI'm gonna remove the IColorConversion<TFrom, TResult> interface. You're right, it's smell.. Nope, you\u2019re absolutely correct. Wood for the trees.... Yeah, if you have time rock on! . @antonfirsov I've been revisiting this PR and the method you suggested and I cannot see how adding it will give use any advantage. \nAs it stands we loop through the span and perform conversion + adaptation in a single loop. If we introduce that method and attempt to integrate it into a bulk conversion we have to loop through and create the unadapted destination span, then loop through again to create the adapted version.. >I think I fail to understand this. But if you mean that it's an issue to create a temporary buffer to call the bulk variant of IChromaticAdaptation.Adapt(...) before calling bulk conversion on the adapted data -it shouldn't be. A MemoryAllocator could quickly allocate it, and with the bulk optimization, the execution will be faster.\n@antonfirsov What I mean it that for many, if not most conversions, the Adapt method comes after the initial conversion which takes place inside the loop. \nIn pseudo code.\nc#\n(for var i = 0 etc){\n var d = ToDWithAdapt(source[i]);\n}\nIn order to do the actual optimization we'd have to stop calling the single methods and inline their code. That dramatically decreases our code reuse and increases the tests we need to write. (I already have to write so, so many conversion tests). Possible of course but so much work...\nOnce inlined I don't think we'll need an allocater so I'll add the method to the interface now and we can add a chore optimization task to the tracker.\n. Right... let\u2019s get this merged. . I\u2019ll try and temporarily turn it off. . Closing in favour of #706 as it's easier to add a new PR than mess about with git and CLA signing.\nThanks @chrischip for your contribution \ud83d\udc4d . Always be using the issue template. Questions on Gitter please. . Questions on the Gitter channel please. It\u2019s clearly noted in the readme. Hint. If you\u2019re deleting an issue template, you\u2019re doing something wrong.. These code coverage results really don't count for much do they? Why would ProjectiveTransformHelper.cs coverage decrease?. This is by design and hasn\u2019t changed.\nThe default png color mode has always been 32bit to support the alpha channel. If you want to save it as 24 bit you have to explicitly do so.\nJpeg doesn\u2019t have an alpha channel so will always be 24 bit. . >It can take up to 30 seconds with an image of 1000x1000 pixels on my machine.\nFor 256 greylevels it would take ~500 ms.\nI'd like to see if we can do anything to improve this as the output is incredible!. Great! Looking forward to seeing what you come up with \ud83d\udc4d . That sounds much more promising!\nIt looks to me like the sum of your samples is off. When interpolating the sum of your samples should equal 1. This maintains the correct brightness. I\u2019d choose clamping to deal with edge pixels also. . @brianpopow no worries, looking forward to seeing this complete. . @brianpopow You're getting bitten by Stylecop \ud83d\udc6e \nProcessing/Processors/Normalization/HistogramEqualizationProcessor.cs(23,26): error CS1572: XML comment has a param tag for 'tiles', but there is no parameter by that name [/home/travis/build/SixLabors/ImageSharp/src/ImageSharp/ImageSharp.csproj]. @brianpopow Thanks for continuing to work on this. \nWould it be possible to share the output side-by-side for the two approaches. I'd like to see if the quality difference is due to a bug or whether is an algorithmic limitation.. @brianpopow Thanks for this, the output looks great and your findings make sense. I'll do a deep dive review on this later on today. \nAs far as tests go. Any algorithmic result should be tested and we can add reference images to the submodule repo to ensure there are no regression issues when applying any future optimization. . I will review this, I promise!. @brianpopow I've started reviewing this and have spotted a few places I should be able to ramp up performance. I'll push directly to your PR once finished.. Hi @brianpopow \nAs you'll be able to see from your commit logs I've been doing some performance work on the various processors. So far I've more than doubled the speed of both the global and tiled processors which is great. \ud83d\ude04 \nI've got some questions on the sliding window implementation though if I may?\nIs there a particular reason you go by column, then by row? By working the way it currently is we are working against the way the image is laid out in memory which will be slowing everything down, additionally this prevents us from using our normal optimized APIs for grabbing a row slice and operating on that. \nWould you be able to change that? I could then do further optimizations to improve the performance.. @brianpopow I'll have a look at the before/after and see if there is anything I can spot. There might be something that isn't getting cleared out that should that was affecting even the before output.. >I am tempted to remove this optimization, because im unsure if its working correctly. For 256 grey values this would not make much of a difference, but for 65536 it would add like 25% time on top.\nI'd try that and see if it makes a difference. We can always look for optimization opportunities once we have the correct output. This all assumes of course that the original output before our refactor was correct?. @brianpopow Finally getting round to having another look at this to get it finished. \nTwo questions:\n\nIs it a requirement of the algorithm to mirror edges? We can optimize things quite a lot if we can remove the reflection and simply reuse the edge pixels (we do that when resampling in the resizer).\nWould it be possible to gather the histogram values for each tile by row instead of per column? We could simply slice then copy. \n. Hi @brianpopow \n\n\n1. Mirroring the edges is the best way i know to deal with the borders of the image where there is no data. I do not understand exactly what you mean by reusing the edge pixels. Can you point me to an example source code line where this is done in th resizer?\n\nIt's actually pretty simple, instead of mirroring you reuse the 0 and source.Width pixels when sampling. So in your current code you have:\nc#\nif (x < 0)\n{\n    x = Math.Abs(x);\n}\nelse if (x >= source.Width)\n{\n    int diff = x - source.Width;\n    x = source.Width - diff - 1;\n}\nIn the most simplistic terms you would have\nc#\nif (x < 0)\n{\n    x = 0;\n}\nelse if (x >= source.Width)\n{\n    x = x - source.Width -1;\n}\nThis yields a different result on the image edges but the algorithm still works. I'm fairly certain we can optimize that example further though if we were going per-row instead of per-column within the tile.\n\n2. We now move the window from left to right. This means when we move one pixel, we need to remove one column from the left and add another on the right. When i was moving the window from top to bottom i could read a row (with the size of the window) when moving one pixel down, but you said this is not a good idea.\n    Maybe i do not understand exactly what you mean or you see something i do not see here, but when moving the window from left to right we need to read a column when moving the window.\n\nThere must be something I am not understanding about the algorithm. \nWhen I first suggested going top down it was because you were using a parallel for 0 => source.Width which meant you couldn't slice a row to operate on it. You're now going 0 => source.Height on the outermost loop now which is good but you're now operating per column within the tile and I don't understand why?\nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/pull/673/commits/8f19e5edd23f13fd1ddf93b4e795f82e7f1334bb#diff-6ca0f7e3ceae4a5676d95d4de12f7b8bR62\n\nIm sorry that i could not be more helpful here.\n\nNever say that chum, your work is amazing.. > ok i understand now what you mean, but we can not do that. That would over amplify the edge pixels in the border. The edge pixels would be added multiple times to the histogram, worst case is the corners of the image where it would lead adding the same value as often as the window width\nReading the linked article I understand now that sampling is more accurate away from the edge border so mirroring seems to be the valid approach.\n\nIf you we move the window from top to bottom, which was the case in the commit you pointed out, we would add one row on the bottom and remove one from the top.\n\nDefinitely preferred over columns as we can do span.Slice(x, range).Copy() for anything other than edge pixels.\nGonna have a good read through the article. It explains the process very clearly. \ud83d\udc4d . Sorry... on holiday. \nYeah, grab per row but do a fast and slow path since we only need mirroring on edges. . https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta5.  Hi @KozakSergii \nThanks for raising this and thanks for supplying the image to test against. I'd really like to flesh out the bmp format support to cover cases like this and the detail you've provided will help.\nCheers\nJames. We should check our implementation against the two decoders in Firefox and Chrome. I could do with help here as my C++ is not great.\nhttps://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/blink.git/+/master/Source/platform/image-decoders/bmp/BMPImageReader.cpp\nhttps://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/image/decoders/nsBMPDecoder.cpp. @dlemstra Thanks! I've gotta know what's going on with the coverage report though. -11.12% on ProjectiveTransformHelper.cs?!. @antonfirsov Haha.. It was basically the wrong variable getting tested against in our bitmasking for-loop. I'm glad it was an easy one to spot. Anything more difficult and I'd have been buggered.. And you think it\u2019s ImagSharp because?. Nice coverage!. Super into this. Do we need to update the code coverage configuration in the build now to ensure that runs?. Confirmed. Thanks for raising this.  . @tzachshabtay I think I might do that actually; the lock felt ugly. Thanks!\nUpdate, the dictionary is breaking two tests as I'd need to implement IEquatable<IImageFormat> for the formats. That's too much for me to bother with so I'm gonna leave it as-is.. We call it when adding both encoders and decoders since they are independent operations . @3itao8 Thanks for raising this. \nNot related to the issue at hand but I notice you are not disposing of images after use. Image<TPixel> implements IDisposable. @vpenades Coverage changes aren't failing, there's differences against the reference files.. @vpenades Can you have a look at the generated output from these changes compared the master? \nWe've got differences appearing on NET 4.7.1 and NET 4.6.2 in 64 bit mode.\nhttps://ci.appveyor.com/project/six-labors/imagesharp/build/1.0.0-PullRequest00686001835\nIt's likely minor but best to cast your eye over to ensure nothing has gone wrong. If you're happy with the output please open a new PR against our reference images repository.. I'm happy to merge this now unless anyone objects.. Wouldn't it be better to create a specific ICO decoder that then calls BitmapDecoder and adding a new SkipHeader option to IBmpDecoderOptions?\nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/blob/301c2cec662169bb330ac74c1bb44a9943885586/src/ImageSharp/Formats/Bmp/IBmpDecoderOptions.cs#L9. @antonfirsov  @TodesBrot I'm happy to add this change to IBmpDecoderOptions.cs as the icon documentation I found clearly states that it only required the DIB BITMAPINFOHEADER.\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms997538.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396\n@tocsoft  On the case of an Icon format. It could simply be stored as a multi-frame image if we didn't have the height width restrictions on the frames. \n. @springy76 As I recall we are treating each frame as such to make it easier and faster to clone frames. (It's been a while so I could be wrong).\nIn Gif we use the Left and Top properties specified in the Image Descriptor for each frame to draw the pixel data into the Image Fame essentially offsetting it against a blank canvas.\nI wonder whether we should be capturing the Top Left values in the ImageFrame<TPixel> class and then only checking (Frame (Left + Width)) = Image Width and the same for height. \nThis would allow us to preserve enough information to allow encoding of Ico files and optimize our Gif encoder also to ignore the transparent pixels.. @tocsoft That was the other place; I recall now. Thanks!\nI think with the additional properties we can/and should still treat Resize in the same way. In my mind it would be business as usual except at the encoder time where we only encode what we need.. @springy76 What we mean regarding resize is that we calculate the interpolation weights once per image because we are confident we can apply the same scaling calculation across all frames since they have the same dimensions.\nYeah, we already handle the disposal mode well for both the decoder and encoder.  We thankfully don't need to handle rendering the images, just ensuring that we match the spec when encoding/decoding. I would imagine truecolor gifs would be a case of encoding individual offset 256 color frames, setting the repeat count and delay fields.. I'm guessing we should be measuring and clamping somewhere?. @kolpav Can you please provide a reduced code sample to replicate the issue we can use in tests. That would be really useful to us.. @kolpav That should be enough, Thanks!. I see you didn\u2019t try using a single palette. What is the output size when you use a new GifEncoder instance with GifColorTableMode set to Global?. I had a look at the image. It has a global palette containing 64 entries. \nWe can replicate this using the following code.\nc#\nusing (var img = Image.Load(@\"C:\\leo.gif\"))\n{\n    img.Mutate(x => x.Resize(400, 0));\n    var encoder = new GifEncoder()\n    {\n        ColorTableMode = GifColorTableMode.Global,\n        Quantizer = new OctreeQuantizer(64)\n    };\n    img.Save(@\"C:\\leo_resized.gif\", encoder);\n}\nOutput 298kb.\n\nNote there's no explicit need to call Quantize() as the gif encoder does that already but defaults to a 256 color palette hence the instructional change. Capturing the input palette length is no use to use because as soon as you changethe image the palette become obsolete.\n. I chose 64 because that was the length of the input palette, most likely since the image is grayscale. We\u2019ve chosen 255+transparency as the default because that covers most gifs. . @dlemstra The build issues are an odd Appveyor SDK thing. I've got a fix in #689. @antonfirsov I\u2019d love to see if we can dump the derived types and use an abstraction of the various format requirements if possible. It depends on how much we can effectively share. . @antonfirsov I've updated the approach to use @dlemstra 's idea of dictionaries to store properties.\nI think this is much better but I'm torn as to whether we should replace the ImageProperty struct with specific properties.. @antonfirsov Thanks for pushing me on this. It feels really clean now with your design.. @antonfirsov Adding the missing meta management isn't that difficult. I've just done Png and will add the others later.. @antonfirsov I've added proper metadata and encoder settings management for gif, png, and bmp for now. There's not really anything in jpeg I can add currently. \nIt might be feasible, if it's not too much of a performance hog, to estimate the input quality of jpeg files in the manner ImageMagick does and add that to the JpegMetaData class.\nhttps://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/f362c02083d27211b913c6e44794f0ac6edaf2bd/coders/jpeg.c#L855. @antonfirsov I've cleaned up the API, and preserving quality now works. I've also stripped the IgnoreMetadata property from the encoder options. I don't like that it's there and not in others.. If someone wants to strip the metadata they can simply delete it.. I'm glad you pushed me!. >With 1.0.0-beta0003, calling Image.Load on the attached file throws the following exception:\n1.0.0-beta0003?. Fixed with #699 .

I'm fairly certain Corefx is currently using a managed implementation rather than the native implementation used on other platforms. Perhaps the interpretation of CompressionLevel.Optimal is somehow different?\nI'm not concerned about this though unless you cannot decode the NET Core versions on other platforms. Would you be able to check this for me?. >If anything I\u2019d assume (different) native implementations would give different results, but in this case net472 on Windows gives the same result as netcoreapp2.1 on Linux. \nYou've got me then, I don't know what the underlying behaviour is for NET Core on different platforms.\nIf it's not an issue to decode the images on different platforms then I'm happy to close this (though it might be an idea to create a test case for deflate stream to see if we need to raise an issue on CoreFX repo). Out of curiosity, which platform created the smaller file?. @jherby2k Great find! That clears that up then. \ud83d\udc4d . Hi @Exocomp \nYes, It's in the API docs linked from the readme. \nc#\nvar info = Image.Identify(Stream stream);\nhttps://docs.sixlabors.com/api/ImageSharp/SixLabors.ImageSharp.Image.html#SixLabors_ImageSharp_Image_Identify_Stream_\nThere's additional format specific information available in the latest nightlies now too.\nc#\nvar gifInfo = Image.Identify(Stream stream).MetaData.GetFormatMetaData(GifFormat.Instance);\nvar pngInfo = Image.Identify(Stream stream).MetaData.GetFormatMetaData(PngFormat.Instance);\nvar jpegInfo = Image.Identify(Stream stream).MetaData.GetFormatMetaData(JpegFormat.Instance);\nvar bmpInfo = Image.Identify(Stream stream).MetaData.GetFormatMetaData(BmpFormat.Instance);\nCheers\nJames\nP.S Please do not use this issue tracker for questions; we need to keep it for issues only. There's a Gitter channel where you'll get plenty of help.. I had a look at the tests and the image you supplied does not actually meet the png specification.\nHere's what PNG Analyzer makes of your image:\n\nAs you can see the image is an indexed image with 573 colors in the palette. I've highlighted below where it violates the specification.\n\nThe PLTE chunk contains from 1 to 256 palette entries, each a three-byte series of the form:\nRed | 1 byte\n-- | --\nGreen | 1 byte\nBlue | 1 byte\nThe number of entries is determined from the chunk length. A chunk length not divisible by 3 is an error.\nThis chunk shall appear for colour type 3, and may appear for colour types 2 and 6; it shall not appear for colour types 0 and 4. There shall not be more than one PLTE chunk.\nFor colour type 3 (indexed-colour), the PLTE chunk is required. The first entry in PLTE is referenced by pixel value 0, the second by pixel value 1, etc. The number of palette entries shall not exceed the range that can be represented in the image bit depth (for example, 24 = 16 for a bit depth of 4). It is permissible to have fewer entries than the bit depth would allow. In that case, any out-of-range pixel value found in the image data is an error.\n\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-PNG-20031110/#11PLTE\nSo... To explain why your images passed the test before. \nIn v1.0.0-dev001866, when using the png encoder with no instruction as you do in your test.\nc#\nimg.SaveAsPng(fs)\nWe would have blindly encoded the image as 32bit true color. This would have preserved the invalid colors in your palette but you would no longer have had an indexed png and we would likely have created a larger image than required.\nWith 1.0.0-dev001874 that behaviour has changed as we can now track whether the image was decoded from an indexed png and use that information to ensure that we encode the image in the same color type. In this case we encode the image in conformance to the specification and max out at 256 colors. \nI believe that this is the correct thing to do. We preserve the integrity of spec compliant images and ensure we do not increase the size of the output compared to the input. We also supply the tools via the metadata information to allow you to make smart encoding decisions.\n. @antonfirsov I've added some more deep cloning and will add tests now to ensure they all do what they should.. Looking through the code it appears when we clone an image everything is deep cloned except for the Configuration. We can't currently perform a deep clone of that type. Do you think it's something we would require? \nIf so that means we'd have to move the new interfaces to SixLabors.Core to ensure MemoryAllocator can be cloned deeply. . @antonfirsov That's all good points and an interesting code sample. \nI think we should keep it simple. We're explicitly creating a singleton for the default configuration and to clone that configuration when creating a deep clone of an image, in my mind, seems silly. We don't actually use the current ShallowCopy() method anywhere in the code, only the tests.\nIf someone wants a clone of an image with a new configuration they can already do this.\n``` c#\nvar configuration = new Configuration(\n                new PngConfigurationModule(),\n                new JpegConfigurationModule(),\n                new GifConfigurationModule(),\n                new BmpConfigurationModule());\nIEnumerable> clonedFrames = image.Frames.Select(x => x.Clone());\nvar clone = new Image(configuration, image.MetaData.DeepClone(), clonedFrames);\n```\nWe could make it easier to do this by creating overloads for Clone() and CloneAs() which take a Configuration parameter, then all they have to do is create a new one. \nAnything else.... Probably overkill.\nI might just change IDeepCloneable.DeepClone() to IDeepCloneable.Clone() to make it all look less confusing for the consumer.. I'll do some minor cleanup then and get this merged.. @antonfirsov Good idea! . Oh well done!!!!!! Thank you!. Is everyone happy to have this merged?. Hi @Davidsv \nI think this is a reasonable request. Aspect ratio, or closest possible to. Fancy creating a PR?\nCheers\nJames. Always work like this I think. A simple Math.Max(1, dimension). . Ready for review. Are you sure you are in the correct repo? ImageSharp has nothing to do with PDF files.. - [ ]  I have verified that I am running the latest version of ImageSharp\n@BitSchupser we have a beta 5 now.\n@antonfirsov I just checked this against the latest nightly and the issue still stands. I'm assuming the fix is as simple as using AllocationOptions.Clean when we allocate the byte buffer in InternalDetectFormat.\nJust want to check something also. ArrayPoolMemoryAllocator.ReleaseRetainedResources is implemented as follows.\nc#\npublic override void ReleaseRetainedResources()\n{\n    this.InitArrayPools();\n}\nI'm assuming we're simply relying on the GC to clear up the old pools?\n. Fix confirmed and PR Opened #715 . Oh you didn\u2019t need to close this, you could have pushed more changes to the branch and it would have automatically updated. Never apologise either, there\u2019s a steep learning curve that comes with working with the library. . @dlemstra Aye, to anyone with a deep knowledge of jpeg! \ud83d\ude1d . I'm just gonna go ahead and merge this. I'm happy with the results plus 100% confident the cleanup is a massive improvement. . Haven't forgotten about this. Will get it merged eventually! . @SimantoR This is next on my todo list for review and will helping you finish it off.. Good catch! \ud83d\udc4d . I'm gonna do #730 at the same time otherwise we're writing code we'll immediately delete.. @jongleur1983 Ok. So I've fixed up all the pixels formats and commented out all the old tests. \nI need to do two things now to complete this PR:\n\nAdd a new suite of tests to cover IPixel functionality\nAdd optimized overloads for the PixelOperations methods. . Got four tests failing due to ToString change in Rgba32 as the reference image path depended on original name. We should update that. Perhaps hex?\n\nhttps://ci.appveyor.com/project/six-labors/imagesharp/builds/19386791/job/x9ru3njufhn9ec6j/tests. Much happier with this now. The structure has much greater conformity and all IPixel operations are covered in both singular and bulk forms.\nGotta fix up the ToString() methods to use invariant culture but I'll wait til the other PR's come in first to drop NetStandard 1.1. Ready for review.\nCode coverage is a bit less than I would like but I'm done now. It's been 10 days writing this. . @antonfirsov Yeah, all the IPixel conversions have optimized bulk implementations so there should be no performance loss. It should actually be faster in some cases than before.. @antonfirsov Those results are extraordinary, I'm very surprised!\nLet's do it here now. A new PR will be another very large one again probably too large to digest. We know where we are here and can review knowing exactly what we are looking at having recently worked on the files.\nScaledVector4 will have to be updated also. . I was tempted to do it all here but for sanities sake lets do Rgba32 here and immediately raise an issue for next priority for Vector4. We don't want to be blocking any open PR's . @antonfirsov works for me! \ud83d\udc4d . @antonfirsov Github's having all sorts of issues just now.. I'm happy to dump s.ToTarget(ref t) and keep t.PackFromSource(s) \nI don't think we need to use partial classes. They're really only used in low level code that's been internal for a long time.. The bug then is in the bmp decoder, not the resize process. We'll need to fix that.\nWhat's the alpha channel for then in a bmp?. @juddski Sorry for the slow reply here. I'm currently reading up on bitmap format and studying the mozilla implementation.\nhttps://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/image/decoders/nsBMPDecoder.cpp. If we update the support listed in #320 we can fix this. I'd have to check the image but is it V4 or V3?\n@dlemstra I'm strongly in favor of the second option. . @juddski Bmp headers for the different versions all have different lengths. So 40 in your case is V3.\n```\n    WIN_V2 = 12,\n    WIN_V3 = 40,\n    WIN_V4 = 108,\n    WIN_V5 = 124,\n// OS2_V1 is omitted; it's the same as WIN_V2.\nOS2_V2_MIN = 16,    // Minimum allowed value for OS2v2.\nOS2_V2_MAX = 64,    // Maximum allowed value for OS2v2.\n\nWIN_ICO = WIN_V3,\n\n```. @dlemstra Option 2 is the way to go. See what Mozilla do, it looks like as soon as they find a non-zero value they switch to fast processing.\nhttps://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/image/decoders/nsBMPDecoder.cpp#858\nc++\ncase 32:\n      if (mH.mCompression == Compression::RGB && mIsWithinICO &&\n          mH.mBpp == 32) {\n        // This is a special case only used for 32bpp WinBMPv3-ICO files, which\n        // could be in either 0RGB or ARGB format. We start by assuming it's\n        // an 0RGB image. If we hit a non-zero alpha value, then we know it's\n        // actually an ARGB image, and change tack accordingly.\n        // (Note: a fully-transparent ARGB image is indistinguishable from a\n        // 0RGB image, and we will render such an image as a 0RGB image, i.e.\n        // opaquely. This is unlikely to be a problem in practice.). @brianpopow It's definitely a bug in the decoder. \nResizing only highlights the issue as the images are alpha premultiplied as part of that process. All the decoders I have looked at now - Chrome, Mozilla, Gimp do the check described in the code sample above to check each alpha value for V3 32bit during decoding, defaulting to fully opaque when not set.. Agreed. Let's wait untill then and reevaluate based on our current state and what tools we have available. . @wc-matteo \nYeah, bitmap support covers the more common types so far. @dlemstra Is there code we can use as inspiration from ImageMagick? . That's good news! \ud83c\udf89 . If we update the support listed in #320 we can fix this. Yeah, the tide has definitely turned. RC1 shall be strong named.. That\u2019s utter bollocks. Strong naming should never be used for security. MS literally warn you not to in their documentation. . https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/app-domains/strong-named-assemblies\n\nDo not rely on strong names for security. They provide a unique identity only.. It looks like there's actually an issue with how we're decoding the mask png. \n\nIt's a 1bit grayscale png with a transparency marker and somehow we are not picking up on that marker.\nIf you make your mask a 32bit image it will work fine.\n\nEdit.\nI've figured out the issue and will push a bug fix soon. . Marking this WIP as I want to investigate some things.. This will do for now. Any optimization to quantizers can come later.. Awesome! . @iamcarbon You're the man!. The problem we have here is that the image itself is incorrectly encoded by Pixelmator.\nThe ratio should be set correctly as part of the JPEG File Interchange Format Version 1.02 specification.\n\nI believe we should be following the ratio as defined in the JFIF APP0 marker explicitly since EXIF metadata is supplementary. I would suggest raising this with Pixelmator.\n. And dispose of your image...\nAnd read #733 . @Horusiath Could you try the latest nightlies please? I'd like to see how the recent improvements fair.\nWe were using SIMD already in it's limited capacity and @antonfirsov has already added some further improvements utilizing the new Core 2.1 API's both to the resampling algorithm and scanline processing. . > On the other hand, the GDI+ jpeg codecs beat us because they are powered by WIC as backend.\nI'd give my right arm to see the source code. It's about as fast as a jpeg decoder gets.. Have you tried the latest version. I.E the nightlies? . There's a good chance the issue is related to https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/issues/723 which I fixed a few weeks back. Just tested against 1.0.0-dev002072. Confirmed to be fixed.. Looks like the EXIF metadata is somehow corrupted @dlemstra I'll need your help here.. Alpha? The latest is linked from the readme. As of just now it's 1.0.0-dev002072 which is about 2 years more recent.\nhttps://www.myget.org/feed/sixlabors/package/nuget/SixLabors.ImageSharp. Haha... Fingers crossed it all works for you now. Any issues hit us up! \ud83d\ude04 . A would add the image from #750 in case we change the underlying implementation and introduce a regressive bug.. That makes sense me. We're not losing when rounding then. . Yeah, I was just waiting on it to finish building . > @antonfirsov feel free to tweek the tolerances... I never get the level them right.\nI commented about this in Gitter the other week. I find the tolerance comparer confusing. \nCurrent the default threshold is 3.921569E-07 calculated as ((1 / 255F) * 65535) / (100 * 100 * 65535) which is defined as\n1% of all pixels in a 100*100 pixel area are allowed to have a difference of 1 unit \nThat's amazing technically that we can calculate this but far too complicated to use. \nI want to simply pass something like 2% and if the image is more than 2% different then it fails.\n. @antonfirsov Ok that makes more sense!. Is the error a point of origin calculation issue? . Failing test was OOM Exception when loading new EXIF test image. Will keep an eye on it and restrict it to x64 if it fails again.. Hi @dmanning23 \nThanks for filling in so much data when opening the issues. We appreciate that!\nYour performance problems will be due to a lack of SIMD support on Android devices.\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/50433924/xamarin-no-hardware-acceleration-when-deployin-to-device/50434306#50434306 \nThat's a real pain for us at the moment because our code is really starting to perform well on devices where hardware acceleration is supported and this puts us in a bad light. \nHowever, the future is starting to look a little brighter. Mono are adding the System.Runtime.Intrinsics namespace to their framework which as I understand it comes with hardware acceleration for ARM devices.\nhttps://github.com/mono/mono/issues/7711.. @antonfirsov I think you're reading it backwards. Dev is faster.\n\nAlso switching from the \"beta\" to \"dev\" build of ImageSharp was significantly faster.\n\nOctree won't be the bottleneck there, even on an unsupported platform. I think the speed issue is simply more noticable since there's multiple frames to process. I would actually always recommend this as the default gif quantizer unless you have a dedicated palette you would like to use, though we use the palette generated by the first frame for subsequent frames by default in dev..\nThe Wu Quantizer supports multiple transparency values which is great for png. It's also much more memory hungry and intensive than Octree. It's also actually a little slower in dev now than in the beta as it uses half the memory but is much better at reducing the color palette. . @antonfirsov I doubt there's anything you couldn't speed up! \ud83d\ude04 . @dmanning23 That'll be because there was no dithering in the alphas which slows things down a lot but also dramatically increases quality. If you don't need it though turn it off by passing a custom IQuantizer instance.. I managed to improve performance of the dithering algorithm previously, I'll have another look to see if there is more low hanging fruit I can trim.. @jackmott Is this with the beta5 build or the nightlies? They should be a lot faster. \nTrouble I'm having here is that I have nothing to compare against since System.Drawing doesn't natively handle animated gifs. \nDithering is the bottleneck. I've optimized it a lot but the complexity of the algorithm slows things down. . @jackmott It would have to be per-frame parallelization since I cannot figure out how to parallelize the sequential error diffusion algorithm. Here's the only non-firewalled article I can find on the subject. \nhttps://community.arm.com/graphics/b/blog/posts/when-parallelism-gets-tricky-accelerating-floyd-steinberg-on-the-mali-gpu\nIf you could figure that out it would no longer be a bottleneck since without dithering the output performance if pretty quick.\nDefo use the dev builds btw. They're solid and much faster.. Think I might have just figured out a way to reduce the amount of dithering we do yet keep good quality.. @dmanning23  Thanks for the info and initial research\nhttps://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/advanced_topics/limitations/\nI have no experience with mobile development so hopefully someone reads this and has a clue what this actually means.. Ah great stuff. I think I actually left a TODO in the code base regarding this. . Fixed with #764 . Hey @devedse this all looks great! Thanks for making the effort to fix this for us. \nI'll pull it down for a final review but from looking on GitHub I can't see anything amiss. \nIn the interim could you please sign the CLA? Cheers! \ud83d\udc4d . @antonfirsov To answer your questions regarding the tRNS chunk.\nWhen decoding either grayscale,  24bit, or 48bit color types, if the chunk is encountered we decode to Rgba32 and Rgba64 pixel formats (we don't have a GrayAlpha pixel format) and set the alpha component to fully opaque for any pixel that does not match the value contained within the chunk.\nWhen encoding we use the Rgb24, Rgb48, Gray8, or Gray16 pixel format layouts and assign a color that should be regarded as transparent to the chunk.\nDoes that make sense?. @antonfirsov \n\nBut what happens when we encounter pixels matching the value? Do we decode fully transparent pixels in those cases?\n\nWe set the alpha component to 0 leaving the other component data intact.\n\nDo we alter transparent pixels to chunk-defined pixels when encoding?\n\nNo the tRNS chunk is simply a marker. Pixels are encoded as normal. Delete the tRNS chunk and you have an opaque image.\n@devedse \nWe have some test images already that might cover your needs but there's an official suite here.\nhttp://www.schaik.com/pngsuite/. @devedse I've updated the code to check for the correct bit depth and also reduce allocations.\nOnce we add the tests images from the collection I linked this is good to go.. Tests added and correct behaviour confirmed. I think this is good to go now.. Hi @mjshero\nA transparent pixel, correctly, by default is an empty one containing 0 for all component values. What you want is the equivalent off the CSS \u201ctransparent\u201d color. You can use the BackgroundColor method with Rgba32.Transparent to set this.\nHope that makes sense\nP.S please use Gitter for questions in the future and do not delete the issue template. . Hi @dmanning23 \nI've been putting some thought to this and I think I've come up with a good class design that will let us incrementally add workarounds for AOT compiler limitations without negatively impact the public API.\nThis design allows you to call a single method at startup that will allow you to easily seed the compiler. \n``` c#\n// Seed a single pixel format.\nAotCompiler.Seed();\n// Seed two pixel formats.\nAotCompiler.Seed();\n// Seed three pixel formats.\nAotCompiler.Seed();\n```\nI'm assuming, I could be wrong of course, that you need to tell the compiler about each pixel format you intend to use. If not, great, we can simplify.\nHere's a stubbed out class that I would like you to use to add your methods. \n``` c#\n// Copyright (c) Six Labors and contributors.\n// Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.\nusing SixLabors.ImageSharp.PixelFormats;\nnamespace SixLabors.ImageSharp.Advanced\n{\n    /// \n    /// Unlike traditional Mono/.NET, code on the iPhone is statically compiled ahead of time instead of being\n    /// compiled on demand by a JIT compiler.

Even things as simple as Rgba32 equality. Considering we're using ushort.Equals there I don't think they are fixable.\nJust tried to create a reduced sample for the Rgba32 comparison error.

I would say this is critical, but maybe I can live without it, if we can't do it now.\nYou're a hard taskmaster you know that right? \ud83d\ude1d . @antonfirsov I've added all the Skew overloads to both builders and relevant additional tests for them also. Any additional tests we can add when cleaning up.. Which is not the one listed in the readme.. Have you tried the nightlies? This should be fixed with #770. That\u2019s great to hear!

For that we need to widen all kernel values from float to Vector4.\n@antonfirsov I'll have to take your word for it. I can't see that optimization myself. \n. @iamcarbon Just landed back in Oz. Will review properly when over my jet lag.\nTwo things I\u2019d like to see/discuss though. \n1. Potential use of Type forwarded HashCode from CoreFx. The API for that is lush.\n2. What does a stack trace for Guard vs non Guard look like? . Legend!. Pulling this in now. Thanks again!!. It occurs to me that this adds decoding support not encoding so the image data will be lost. We should get the work done to allow supporting encoding also. . @antonfirsov \n\nIs it possible to have 12 bit precision jpegs for colorspaces other than YCbCr? (eg. CMYK, YCCK, RGB)\n\nYes, when 12bit support was added to the jpeg specification it covered all color spaces. On that note we cannot preserve that color data when saving the jpeg. We'll need to add the equivalent colorspace transformation code to the encoder with any additional requirements.  . @antonfirsov Just spent the last 20 mins scouring the internet for an official source of test images and I've come up with nothing. libjpeg-turbo's repo contains 1 12bit file that doesn't appear to be supported by anything I have on my machine. https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/tree/master/testimages\n. @feliwir @antonfirsov I had some time so I updated everything in the branch, removed some of the Linq stuff from the color converter and merged the reference image. \nWe're getting very close to having this ready to merge \ud83c\udf89 \nQuestion though. Shall we had encoding 12bit jpegs to this PR or open a new Issue/PR. We'll need to create optimized color conversion methods to handle this.. @antonfirsov When you have a chance can you please conduct a final review?. Merged. Thanks @feliwir !. @antonfirsov Nope. I'll update from master and get it merged. @swoolcock Thanks for your help!\n\nNote that although JPEG will now also load without crashing, it is incredibly slow on Xamarin.iOS. A 1366x768 JPEG takes about 5 seconds to load on an iPad Pro.\n\nOn that note, it's due to the current lack of SIMD support on those platforms - Our hands are tied by MS. There is improved support coming in NET Core 3.0 and future Mono though so fingers crossed we get what we need.. Hi there, \nCan you do me a favour and compare against the latest dev build? We\u2019ve updated the convolution code there so it would be good to see if anything has changed. \nCheers! . Would it be possible to share your code?. Thanks for that, appreciate it.. \nReading through your code it looks to me that the difference is simply the sampling radius per pixel. You sample the entire image while we sample (2 * sigma) + 1.\nBtw I'm not very good at maths so you lost me with the graphs.\nThis was a good read and helped make sense of what you are saying. http://dev.theomader.com/gaussian-kernel-calculator/. CSS makes an absolute meal of it, oversampling edge pixels but produces a similar blur to @Poyo-SSB method.\n\n. > It appears that the shape of the actual kernel is different despite what the code seems to output.\nI think you're correct. The calculated kernel dimensions are too small. I rewrote the kernel generation code based on the guide here http://chemaguerra.com/gaussian-filter-radius/ to preserve a minimum kernel radius of Ceiling(sigma * 3) and here is the result.\n\n. I\u2019ll create a PR shortly. @wchill Thanks for providing so much detail here, really appreciate it. \nI'm not sure what is going wrong here. Given four points of the CSS driven output it appears that the basic output from a transform doesn't match.\nWith the given rectangle (0, 0, 290, 154) from the image dimensions I would expect the following results\nTL = x: 52, y:165\nTR = x:358, y:109\nBL = x:115, y:372\nBR = x:600, y:600\nbut if I transform the BR property of the rectangle I get the following.\n``` c#\nvoid Main()\n{\n    var m1 = new Matrix4x4(\n    0.260987f, -0.434909f, 0, -0.0022184f,\n    0.373196f, 0.949882f, 0, -0.000312129f,\n    0, 0, 1, 0,\n    52, 165, 0, 1);\nVector2 GetVector(float x, float y)\n{\n    const float Epsilon = 0.0000001F;\n    var v3 = Vector3.Transform(new Vector3(x, y, 1F), m1);\n    return new Vector2(v3.X, v3.Y) / Math.Max(v3.Z, Epsilon);\n}\n\n// Demo how the transform from a Vector3 into 2D space matches Vector2 transform.\nVector2 v2 = Vector2.Transform(new Vector2(290, 154), m1);\nv2.Dump();\n\nVector2 v2A = GetVector(290, 154);\nv2A.Dump();\n\n// <185.1584, 185.1582>\n   // Expected 600, 600\n\n}\n```\nWhich is different. I'm wondering whether the row/column values in the Matrix4x4 represent different indexes?. @wchill Sorry, I meant if there was some row/column major funkiness going on, the MS docs aren't great.\nYou're bang on the money with your fix. When I originally ported the taper transform methods from the skiasharp docs I forgot to take into consideration that the 3rd column/row of their SKMatrix struct is the same as our 4th row/column in Matrix4x4 this meant I was using the wrong method to flatten down the transform into the 2D space - Really obvious in retrospect....\nI've opened #788 to fix this. Once built you will be able to write the code like this and the library will automatically calculate the correct output canvas size.\n``` c#\nusing (var image = Image.Load(\"test.png\"))\n{\n    var matrix = new Matrix4x4(\n        0.260987f, -0.434909f, 0, -0.0022184f,\n        0.373196f, 0.949882f, 0, -0.000312129f,\n        0, 0, 1, 0,\n        52, 165, 0, 1);\nimage.Mutate(x => x.Transform(new ProjectiveTransformBuilder().AppendMatrix(matrix)));\nimage.Save(\"canvas.png\");\n\n}\n```. >Do you mean I can skip creating an intermediate canvas?\nExactly that. In our dev builds we now calculate the correct output bounds of the transform and draw the transformed pixels accordingly. We take into account translations to offset images, shrinking or growing the canvas when required. It's all much easier to use.\nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/blob/3917e397f597fc74eab3fee90e6006cd28fbf5a1/src/ImageSharp/Processing/Processors/Transforms/TransformUtils.cs#L288\nFor example: Here's the output of your transform against a solid block using the code in the PR. I've colored in the background so you can see where we have offset the positive translation. No intermediate canvas required.\n\n. As of 1.0.0-dev002271\nbash\nPM> Install-Package SixLabors.ImageSharp -Version 1.0.0-dev002271 -Source https://www.myget.org/F/sixlabors/api/v3/index.json\n\n. > We should probably add at least one reference-image based test case to ensure correctness, with a reference image generated by CSS.\n@antonfirsov  I would but CSS blur over-samples past the edge of the image so we can't compare. \nAdditionally we use a constrained kernel when sampling, capturing 97% of the Gaussian integral but ignoring changes generally invisible to the human eye when compared to an infinite kernel.  . @brianpopow None of our reference decoders can correctly decode the bmp so I've disabled the comparison for now.. Whoop! Thanks for your help!. @brianpopow No worries. When comparing a decoder we save the output (defaults to 32bit png) so we can view it manually then we call the CompareToOriginal extension method which compares our decoded result against a reference decoder (System.Drawing for bitmaps). \nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/blob/c3a6040cdf066400cee0f377b53f6140f52a4b41/tests/ImageSharp.Tests/Formats/Bmp/BmpDecoderTests.cs#L54\nThat reference you added yesterday would be useful only when testing encoding once we can encode that bitmap type. You would normally just add the image to the input folder for testing the decoder. . Merged. Thanks so much for your help with bitmaps. I don't understand the various specs well enough just now and you've really made a positive difference to the library. \ud83d\udc4d  . @brianpopow Great work! This all looks good to me so once it's built I'll merge it. \nI took the liberty to fix #732 here also since it was blocking your tests.. We have a template. It's incredibly frustrating that you have chosen not to use it.. Can you give the latest dev build a try and make sure you\u2019re using the latest Mono. I think we\u2019ve solved this. (Funkiness in Xamarin\u2019s deflatestream implementation) . We\u2019ve got a MyGet feed (link in readme) where you can get the latest build. Was gonna hold out for an RC release but am beginning to think a beta6 might be wise to give us some breathing room. I\u2019ll get one on Nuget after Christmas. (It\u2019s Christmas Day already here in Sydney) . Not yet, actually chatting to our lawyer this evening so RC might move forward. Will have to plan timescales with the other chaps.. Hi @Nacimota \nThis is one of those situations where what Photoshop does I'd describe as wonky. Here's a fiddle demonstrating what CSS does. As you can see the output matches the behaviour there exactly which is what I would expect.\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/37dyftxz/\n\nI don't plan on adding a filter that replicates the unorthodox behaviour but if you wanted to the maths is demonstrated here.\nhttp://graficaobscura.com/matrix/index.html \nHope that makes sense.\nCheers\nJames\n. Now that is interesting! \nHere's the source for hue rotation in Chromium. Our matrice calculation looks the same (different indices but that's due to the 1D nature of their array). I'll do some experimentation. \nhttps://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/cc/paint/render_surface_filters.cc?l=72. Are you sure you\u2019re reading the correct part of your input stream? . Here's your problem. They're not Jpeg's, they're WebP images. See #121 for the story there. Hoping for community help to get started supporting that image format.\n\n. Hi @sardok \n\n1024x36000\n\nThat's not a moderate image, that's a massive one!! Can we have it for testing against please?\n\nI believe the size of the image does not hit to 2GB or 4GB buffer limits which are mentioned in some other issues.\n\nWhen we see these errors it's actually due to multiplication, I'll try to explain. \nWe request everything from a single pool as bytes to prevent having to maintain multiple pools. This means that we request the struct as bytes and then cast to the appropriate layout. Unfortunately this means when processing large collections of larger structs we can make requests over the maximum allowable length.\nWe're going to need to have a look at specific areas of the library. I've identified them previously as jpeg decoding and image resizing. @antonfirsov has already done some work to reduce the overheads in resizing but we'll have to see what we can do in the decoder also.\n. @sardok Excellent. Thanks!. Starting to get really annoyed by tests randomly failing in different environments. The NET Core tests pass on my machine.. > We should probably add tests based on images in #802. For my naive eyes they look like important special cases.\nI did consider that but it only really adds regression protection which we already have covered with our sample files. I could replace the samples though.\n\nWe may consider renaming it to ColorMatrix and keep it inside the bounds of ImageSharp\n\nThis did cross my mind also, I just like the conformity of naming it currently has with Numerics. It's a coin toss.\n. Haha... I\u2019ll rename it tomorrow then. . @CoenraadS Jpegs are 24 bit (8 bits per channel). You are never going to be able to save an 8bit jpeg.\nThe difference in size is probably due to a combination of different output quality, metadata preservation and resampling algorithm. \nThe performance difference in Resize is dubious, like-for-like benchmarks show that we normally come out on top and also produce higher quality output. This does depend on many factors, CPU etc.  If you're saving at 10% quality you should be using Nearest Neighbor for resizing as it's way faster.\nSkiaSharp decodes and encode jpegs faster because they use libjpeg-turbo under the hood. We do not have the SIMD tools available yet to allow faster decoding but we can probably speed up encoding a lot by optimizing our color transforms (It's on the TODO list).\nOnce you align the output quality you'll find the performance much closer. \nAnyway it's milliseconds and our API is an order of magnitude nice to use.\n. @CoenraadS Actually you are correct! We should support 8 bit encoding!. Recommend that we pause this until we get the new SIMD APIs in System.Runtime.Intrinsics.. That was quick! \ud83d\udcaf . @brianpopow Those new exceptions are going to start to hurt performance and coverage. Would it be possible for you to refactor them out into a static BmpThrowHelper class like the ThrowHelper class in the jpeg decoder?. Merged. Thanks again, couldn't do this without you!. JpegSnoop Output\nIt's YccK I wonder if we are not parsing the color mode properly. cc/ @antonfirsov \nNope. Everything looks fine. It's happening after the scan decoder I think. \n```\nJPEGsnoop 1.8.0 by Calvin Hass\n  http://www.impulseadventure.com/photo/\n\nFilename:

YCbCr. Just running a debug pass on the image now.. @brianpopow Again amazing work, you rock! \ud83d\udc4d . Beginning to really dislike the disconnect between MS dev teams and technologies.. >I see other ImageSharp issue in our DB that are marked as fixed. Have y'all ever managed to get a version of this building for Release UWP?\n@MattWhilden  I can't be sure that anyone actually has, in fact, I doubt very much someone has. We have some older issues that I closed due to a lack of support on the UWP side not ours.. @brianpopow Perfect! Thanks very much for this \ud83d\udc4d . Nice work. I had trouble sourcing test images for this myself.. @brianpopow Just so you know you are now known as the Bitmap King \ud83d\udc51 . I'm gonna go ahead and merge this. Coverage is 100% and all tests pass.. @Lakritzator Ah this is great! \ud83d\udc4d . There's a fair amount of work here so if anyone fancies chipping in please do.. Thanks for this. Got four failing tests now that will need fixing as their expecting the old processor.\nhttps://ci.appveyor.com/project/six-labors/imagesharp/builds/22506131/job/t3ow5thwuq4awq8q/tests. I\u2019m not seeing anything in the code that suggests this cannot be achieved using the color matrix. \nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/blob/master/src/ImageSharp/Processing/KnownFilterMatrices.cs. > * .NET Framework version: dotnet core 3.0 preview2\nHi @sunnycase \nWe haven't built this against Net Core 3.0 yet. I imagine your issue will be due to a bug in 3.0 since it is only  a preview. . >Yes, .Net Core 2.0 doesn't have this issue.\nYeah, so I would suggest raising an issue there. Referencing this one, it'll be up to Microsoft to fix.. \u2b06\ufe0f Thanks @sunnycase !!. Great stuff!. We based ours on ImageMagick but I did the port and don\u2019t read C well at all. I\u2019ve most likely messed it up so please have a look if you can. . @dlemstra Just compared the current master source to the point in time source i ported from. It's identical so I must have missed something.. @dlemstra Good spot! That should simply mean we're adding a bunch of zeros we don't need to but I've just realized Block8x8F doesn't implement IEquatable<T> so we might be getting issues there.\n@Marcel0024 By my understanding they are simply the tables themselves.\njpeg_info->quant_tbl_ptrs[0]->quantval[53] is the 53rd index of the first quantization table.\n. @dlemstra Confirmed. Test example1.jpg now returns 99. I'll push a fix.. @antonfirsov Agree with all the above. \nForgot to add WIP. I want as many eyes on this as possible as I develop it and hopefully some assistance as I'm off to Seattle on Sunday.. @antonfirsov We're doing something weird in ResizeProcessor when companding.\nOur pattern is. \npremultiply => expand => operate => unpremultiply => compress\nWhen it should be (requires change to companding algorithm)\npremultiply => expand => operate => compress => unpremultiply\nor \nexpand => premultiply => operate => unpremultiply => compress\n. Is this class still in use?. Is this still required or can it go?. \u2708\ufe0f VROOOOOOOOOM......\nThat's the sound of all this going over my head. Could you please add some comments here so I can figure out what is going on? It's proper into CS territory here.. I wish I knew what I and J stood for. I can't find anything in my big book o' jpeg and the original source had no comments. Any ideas what they represent?. Could do with a little cleanup here.. By my understanding we would be looking at some perf improvements switching to span when it's out. Is that correct?. Do you reckon we could use Vector<T> here on the loop?. Maybe we should move this into the benchmark project?. Could you please add a few comments here describing what you are testing?. Ok, Let's keep it then. \nAs far as I'm aware there isn't. BenchmarkDotNet now includes accurate memory analysis but doesn't give us the detail we require. This might actually end up being a pattern we could adopt elsewhere in the tests. . Ok, Do you want to do that now or after this PR is merged?. I'm looking forward to being able to use it. I think it's get me out of some tricky situations I have with pixel rows in my Png codec where I want the byte array for unmanaged use but not the first item, plus I don't want to copy it. . \ud83d\udc4d . I think the values represent the last two used index positions within the block but I'd have to have another read through. \nNo worries, we'll figure it out eventually.. \ud83d\udc4d . Cool, just comment in the T4 template then. . I'll leave that up to you then depending on how you want to handle the encoder refactor.. We do need to fix a merge conflict though in JpegEncoderCore.cs . No worries, I might even be able to do it based on your prior work. . Aye maybe one day.... This is a good idea.. Great!. I don't use var myself but I can clean this up after the merging the PR so don't worry about it. . Do we need to be specific here? It's caused problems in the past when collaborating.. Could you possibly note how these work and how you would make other patterns?. Partial class with a single part.. There's a lot of noop disposable instances here and I can't see why the IDisposable pattern is being used at all. . If we do require IDisposable (Which I don't think we do )we're not cleaning up after ourselves.. No instances of the applicator would get disposed of using the current pattern.. These casts and returns are returning a new array instance on each constructor. I think we should move everything to Vector2 only. . Vector2[] ? We know the length.. Can this be done without Linq?. Again this cast and return is creating allocation overheads. Vector2 FTW!. This line is an absolute performance killer. For each pixel we are creating two arrays. One for Select, one for OrderBy. We need to find a way to avoid this or the memory usage will be incredible. . Kewl. I have no idea what version I have installed but I think it's the latest. . Ok coke... Do we need them to be IDisposable? I don't mind the pattern as long as it's truly necessary. They're a great way to handle array pooling for example. . Github wouldn't let me follow those links for some reason but I'll take your word for it \ud83d\ude09 . Sweet.. True that but it's amazing how these little things add up. Was just reading something on Twitter there about a \"peanut butter\" effect of small number of allocations adding up that I found interesting. There's just something about Point and PointF that make me feel like we're building something \"enterprisey\" by copying the structures. . Excellent. That one I provided below was a quick bash but made a massive difference.. Excellent! Thanks for that.. Eureeka! Ok, I totally get it now. Sorry for the confusion. . This and the other Vector2 stuff is great!. Do we still need this?. Don't save the bitmap in the benchmarks. We end up benchmarking the encoder also. Return the rectangle as a result BMDN works better with returns. . @olivif  What is the resultant type of x in this bit of code?\nvar x = (byte)1 + (byte)2;\nI'm sure you know this already but it's an int due to implicit casting since bytes don't have an + operator. (This is the simplest example I could think of as an easy mistake to make using var)\nI work with streams a lot and I've lost count of the amount of times that the wrong value has been passed to a BinaryWriter due to the use of var. That's always a nightmare to debug!\nI know it's more common to use now but in certain critical codebases like the Roslyn compiler it's still banned. \nI honestly believe that it's having a negative effect on modern programming. Devs aren't learning their types nor the framework properly as a result and are being careless, using var mostly because they don't know what the return type of a method should be.\n . You're better than I then! I tried C++ once..... Nope, too hard! \ud83d\ude04 . I don't think we need this. PixelAccessor<TColor> isn't an extension point.. Och... I wouldn't worry about it. Anyone writing a new brush should know not to do that. . @antonfirsov Output will be different. Different color models only store certain information. . See the output here when I'm doing crazy things\nhttps://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/issues/27. @antonfirsov I think the confusion is there as you are passing the int params by ref also. The compiler is heavily optimised for passing small structs so it's uncommon to see them passed by reference.. Some odd spacing here.... Do we have new decoder benchmarks to go with the changes?. Good thinking. Could you elaborate on this?. Surprised this still builds while failing SA1650? (No spaces in params description). Description please.. r0, r4, and invsqrt2h are assigned but not used.. Cheeky! \ud83d\ude09 You know my OCD will require me to move this eventually.. var,var,var,var,vaaaaaarrrrrr. Some descriptions here please. . How much of this can we keep when we switch to Span<T>?. If a method is used only by one class is should probably live in that class.. Try to keep descriptions on one line if short. Makes things easier to read.. I'd guess it was there for developer sanitation. If I now incorrectly pass an object with no width height I don't get any warning. @dlemstra is that the intention?\nI'd rather it remained. It shouldn't be a performance hit running in debug only.. Can be readonly. I don't see a use of this overload yet?. RowStride for consistency with PixelAccessor<TColor>. Why encapsulate this with a new reference? ArrayPool<byte>.Shared is already static.. Ha! I actually wrote this myself the other day then never pushed it. Great minds...... This is cool.. Wouldn't it be easier to use the overload specifying the decimal places as we have elsewhere?. return new Image<Color>(other);. Ah of course, makes sense now. I forgot we do that.. Yeah, easy enough to fix. Don't worry about it. \nThis is by far the best plugin for VS to remove trailing whitespace btw, it does it automatically on save.\nhttps://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.TrailingWhitespaceVisualizer. Okily dokily... They're better of in the class though than in a utility class. They swiftly become dumping grounds.. Good good. \ud83d\ude04 . Cool!. Monsters! I'm gonna pitch in there.. Definitely re-enable it then.. I'm forever finding new trinkets.. How about explicit method calls instead of a switch then? More boilerplate for us but should yield much better performance.. My bad! All cool then. . It'll add a performance boost to the Color version also. I'll do that once we've merged this PR so don't worry about it. . I'd rather something much more explicit so yeah, I'm cool with that.. Resharper will actually warn if you don't do this since there is the potential for the hashcode to change during the lifetime of the object. I've not been crazy strict about it though, especially in the IPackedPixel implementations. Truth be told, I'm not sure it's something I should really be concerned about.\nhttp://www.jetbrains.com/resharperplatform/help?Keyword=NonReadonlyMemberInGetHashCode. I've a feeling I have a few different values for Epsilon littered throughout the codebase. They should probably all be the same. . Sounds like a plan!. Make new Vector3(255) a private static member. It reduces the allocations.. \u2b06\ufe0f What @olivif said.. Properties?. This is interesting. Some neat refactoring undoing the existing mess!. Lazy loading of the Bytes.Buffer? . That's only 128 bytes. Should we just use the ArrayPool?. The remaining parameter is only used for precondition checks. Really this line should be. this.ReadFull(this.Temp, 0, remaining);. Nice work!!. This doesn't seem to be in use any more.. Yeah happy to change this. As @antonfirsov noted correctly yesterday Equals and AlmostEquals should really be separate. My original code was buggy. . Yup. Will have a look at that. . This is required for Image<TColor>(Stream stream). No, I've removed it now and the same in ImageFrame. I didn't write the original tests so can't really comment on them. . Lazy is threadsafe, static Bootstrapper property newing up isn't see http://csharpindepth.com/Articles/General/Singleton.aspx. Reflection requires looking through every dll in the bin folder, anything in App_Code and elsewhere. It really slows down startup, especially if someone has installed frameworks like DevExpress or Telerik. Have been there and done it with ImageProcessor. You do not want this. . I'm using Lazy for both thread safety and lazy initialization. Even a static property isn't initialized until the class is called. . That should never happen. I need to split up the branches so there is a dev and master. Dev builds should always have a build suffix. Alpha, beta, RC etc . Definitely keep the tests together. I want to throw Stylecop at them though so they are properly formatted and annotated. . I didn't know these existed and now I see them I certainly don't like the first one. ImageBase shouldn't have a and extension method converting it to an ImagFrame as it should have no idea what an ImageFrame should be, the calling code should use the constructor. \nNot convinced by the second method etiher. Again the constructor could have been used.  . Yeah, great stuff!  Move the logic into a static method and we're good.. We don't need this nor the others.  The default behaviour is now for Configuration.Default to automagically load the types and I want to use the same syntax for adding all image formats.. StyleCop please.\nWhat's the output of this process? i.e What version numbers are generated?. What does build-inner do? The file is empty. . Can we put all these processors back please. I don't understand why they were all moved.. I guarantee there's some coding standard applied to those tests also. Stylecop or not they need to be cleaner, conform to a basic set of rules and naming standards and be instantly obvious what they are testing. . Nope... Processing is a library name, processors should be anything inheriting ImageProcessor. Happy to be merciful if it helps productivity. Let's all try to clean up as we update tests and make sure we don't introduce new formatting issues and we'll be fine \ud83d\ude04.. Much prefer seeing the concrete implementation.. var... Incidentally the rule used for var in the Microsoft libraries is that it can only be used when the type is present on the same line. I don't think many people know this.. Can we use the XML docs for private methods also please. Some (many) might see it as overkill but we do most of our really complicated stuff in private methods so it's good to add additional documentation and really helps with intellisense internally. Oh and all those vars below please.. Can we expand this description slightly please. It's all still rocket science to me \ud83d\ude80 . I'm assuming this is just to explicitly test the overload. Default is anti-alias yeah?. Missed this. Agreed, should be faster also. . Not a fan of T4 to be honest. Another syntax to learn that lingers.. I think the number depends on the individual encoding. https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ee720036(v=vs.85).aspx#_jpegprogressivedecoding. You're not counting the mcu's anymore? This doesn't fix the issue now with the image in #18 . Great. Easy change to make. \ud83d\udc4d . Can we use Pascal casing for method names please?. Odd namespace \ud83d\ude09 . Why are we creating new shape paths for the unit tests? Are we expecting developers to have to do the same in their own code? . Do you not use the default whitespace setting within VS?. Surely no need for the extension method now if we are moving it to ImageBase<TColor>?. No var.\nWill intersections code be in Shapes?. Let's try to be a little more descriptive with params. e.g. The region of interest, The region withing the image to draw, etc. Remember... You're the only person who really understands this stuff \ud83d\ude1d . This looks nice to me. We should be able to use ref returns eventually.. \"a something\"?. I take it you have Ghostdoc or something? No need for <value/>. /// <returns>The <see cref=\"Image{TColor}\"/>.</returns>. Various. Is Path now ambiguous?. Does this mean I can have an Ellipse struct implementing IShape and pass that?  (Hint: I really want to be able to draw ellipses \ud83d\ude1d ). I'm assuming we have ready made implementations of IPath, IShape etc?. Maybe we could use implicit casting?. \"The x\", They X Factor, The X-Men? \ud83d\ude09 \nvar. Much nicer!. You can use <inheritdoc/> for interface or base class overloads.. Oops! Yeah that should definitely be Image<TColor>. Do we still need these constants?\nWe can probably do public double HorizontalResolution {get; set;} = 96\n. Now I know why you were asking.... Tests need a cleanup to be honest. We've got a lot of integration tests but we really need a lot more simple AAA unit tests. \nWe should look at CoreFX for inspiration. Their tests are a great example of how to keep the tests concise and descriptive. . I guess all profiles should probably have a common Sync method enforced by an interface. . @antonfirsov You and your naming! \ud83d\ude1d I'll actually allow that in tests since naming is so totally different from normal source and it does improve readability in these cases.. Meant to respond to this earlier. We're inconsistent in the library. Sometimes we throw, sometimes we clamp. Leave it as is just now but we should readers the library again before final release. . I wonder whether we should use netstandard names as directives e.g. \n```\n// We'd have to define this in our 45 and 461 sections also.\nif  (NETSTANDARD13)\n// Do your thang!\n\nendif\n```\nMy reasoning is that we know what API's are available for each standard. . var. I think it's possible to simplify this. VS2017 projects seem to reference neststandard1.6 for each standard implementation. We'll figure that out when we switch in a couple of weeks though when the RTM hits.. RTM's not out until 7th March as far as I was aware?. Maybe... I'd like to have a dig around some of the MS stuff to see what their convention is.. Oh yeah! We switched to float[][] in the edge detection algorithms.. Good to know! Just merged master back in.. Aye this was original written before we could do that. Will update.. Tests target netstandard1.1 and net4.5.1 just now. Won't switch till we move to VS2017. Odd.. I was only getting those options and no file overloads in my VS instance.. It's doing a lot more work than before.... I added caching in the distance lookup but maybe there is more we can do. \nThe Quantizer can be set so dithering could be turned off if they don't want it. I'm making it opt-out since the quality difference is so dramatic.. Ah sorry, misread that. Slower without dithering? Hmmm....\n. Laziness \ud83d\ude08 I was reading from the samples I found that were using bytes. Ordered dithering requires bytes though since we are using to/.from bytes to reduce complexity for all pixel formats. Happy to switch to fast flat array. Throw one into this PR if you like?. Will do \ud83d\ude04... We can enhance after this PR is merged. \nShall I make a start on our new Color struct or do you want to do that?\nGet some sleep! \ud83d\udecc . Some Fast2DArray<T> benchmarks. Faster than a jagged array for most situations (including ours) and between 50-60% faster than 2D array across the board. Safer than jagged array also API -wise.\nFast2DArray<T>  FTW! Great suggestion @antonfirsov After I merge this PR i'll apply it to our convolution filters also.\n```\nBenchmarkDotNet=v0.10.1, OS=Microsoft Windows NT 6.2.9200.0\nProcessor=Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6600U CPU 2.60GHz, ProcessorCount=4\nFrequency=2742188 Hz, Resolution=364.6723 ns, Timer=TSC\n  [Host]     : Clr 4.0.30319.42000, 64bit RyuJIT-v4.6.1586.0\n  DefaultJob : Clr 4.0.30319.42000, 64bit RyuJIT-v4.6.1586.0\nAllocated=0 B\n```\nMethod | Count |      Mean |    StdErr |    StdDev | Scaled | Scaled-StdDev |\n------------------------------------ |------ |---------- |---------- |---------- |------- |-------------- |\n'Array access using 2D array' |    10 | 1.3680 ns | 0.0110 ns | 0.0395 ns |   1.00 |          0.00 |\n'Array access using a jagged array' |    10 | 0.5169 ns | 0.0121 ns | 0.0453 ns |   0.38 |          0.03 |\n'Array access using Fast2DArray' |    10 | 0.5076 ns | 0.0332 ns | 0.1243 ns |   0.37 |          0.09 |\n'Array access using 2D array' |   100 | 1.0366 ns | 0.0370 ns | 0.1432 ns |   1.00 |          0.00 |\n'Array access using a jagged array' |   100 | 0.4906 ns | 0.0101 ns | 0.0365 ns |   0.48 |          0.08 |\n'Array access using Fast2DArray' |   100 | 0.5683 ns | 0.0240 ns | 0.0931 ns |   0.56 |          0.12 |\n'Array access using 2D array' |  1000 | 0.9641 ns | 0.0405 ns | 0.1569 ns |   1.00 |          0.00 |\n'Array access using a jagged array' |  1000 | 0.6315 ns | 0.0350 ns | 0.1308 ns |   0.67 |          0.16 |\n'Array access using Fast2DArray' |  1000 | 0.5521 ns | 0.0307 ns | 0.1147 ns |   0.58 |          0.14 |\n'Array access using 2D array' | 10000 | 1.0596 ns | 0.0380 ns | 0.1470 ns |   1.00 |          0.00 |\n'Array access using a jagged array' | 10000 | 0.5105 ns | 0.0173 ns | 0.0624 ns |   0.49 |          0.08 |\n'Array access using Fast2DArray' | 10000 | 0.4680 ns | 0.0211 ns | 0.0819 ns |   0.45 |          0.09 |. \ud83d\udc4d Why the hell that should be required though is a mystery. Mental.. You mean the PNG Encoder ? \nThe WuQuantizer doesn't support dithering (for now) as I couldn't get the output correct so I switched it for the octree one which does. If you're encoding indexed png's you really want the output to be top notch so I thought the switch was important. \n. Glad you fixed this and Vignette.. This is great! Being able to create any color from a hex is a powerful addition.. What happens to PackedValue ? We need this to be enforced by an interface so that we can provide signature compatibility to MonoGame types. That's why IPackedVector<T> still existed despite us not using it. . Everyone should probably have the later version now. Was thinking of bumping dependencies to 4.3.0 also soon.. We don't use the property but I'm sure Monogame must. We, of course,  don't want to implement it for our optimized types nor use the interface for typeparams. Time to check the Monogamr source. . The only direct reference to the property is here\nhttps://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/blob/7c3d6870a38f8a5e479e64d935d692f2610e1cda/MonoGame.Framework/Net/PacketReader.cs#L84\nhttps://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/blob/7c3d6870a38f8a5e479e64d935d692f2610e1cda/MonoGame.Framework/Net/PacketWriter.cs#L74\nAll I'm thinking is that all the existing IPackedVector<TPacked> implementations could continue as is but with the interface separate from IPixel<TColor>. I know it seems really odd but I really want to ensure that we have the greatest range of coverage possible when considering compatibility. . Couldn't this be \nreturn options as IBmpEncoderOptions ?? new BmpEncoderOptions(options);. Amazed that the specs don't restrict this. Good catch.. When is it possible to call new GifDecoderCore(null) ?. Nice addition!. Thinking about that we should probably reduce the value now we have dithering. Our output should be much cleaner. Do you know of any other encoders that offer this option? We should follow the most common default.. Well that answers my question earlier \ud83d\ude04 . So much cleaner!. I think we have that marked as 80 and below for 420 in the quality XML comments, 91 is the correct value for switching so we should say 90. . Yup, should be 90 here.. Is this something we should be handling in the options?. Ummmmm.... I think it was because I was having versioning problems with xunit. This might be ok now.. I think it might pull for all. . Drop the word \"Pack\" here as per my commit comments.. Is this enforced by the IPackedPixel interface or any other interfaces?. I like this. Definitely best to reuse code.. \"whether\". Same as commit query, how was this value picked? It's gonna be something I probably should know I'm sure.. @tocsoft What was the reasoning behind this? . Ah right thanks... Anything bigger than that they would be better off using something taht supported file based paging anyway. . Sweet. Didn't see.. Thought as much thanks! @antonfirsov I've we are still able to lock an array then we should reintroduce the check in the manner you suggested in your comments.. Prefix with private here please. Not a fan of using the implicit declaration.. If it's unused then yes. I introduced it ages ago and the functionality has since been superseded with better objects. . Indeed I did. Not used to seeing them. I'm assuming we want to keep them private then?. @tocsoft No, keep it as-is with the required cast. Best not to expose anything we don't explicitly want to. . We should probably put an explanation here as to what is going on. After reading this http://lolengine.net/blog/2011/3/20/understanding-fast-float-integer-conversions I still don't get the last value.. I need to get better at reading this kind of stuff.. I'm assuming this is benchmarked since you're always teaching me \ud83d\ude04 . I remember thinking I was going to have to do something like this before I discovered the unsafe type. Interesting to see it come back.. For Perf?. I like that this is all encapsulated away now.. \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83d\ude04 I'll read up then. Those API additions look interesting! Definitely needed.. No we can't assume that. Someone could have multiple images in a stream or other information. Best we can do is look for the identifier at the position we are currently at. . Agreed, great stuff. The others really should be. We should add a chore tag for issues so we can do this \ud83d\ude1d   . I would like this to be a thing.. I've used known max values in the past. That would be my favored approach\nhttps://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/blob/0b5396d0df399dc0eb7968d1479a3e93378de1aa/src/ImageSharp.Formats.Png/PngDecoderCore.cs#L50\nFor additional larger values I've rented/returned the buffer and made sure I was careful reading them.. I do like that class though. Clever idea!. That would be great! \ud83d\udc4d . inheritdoc. Good to see Fast2DArray<bool> introduced here.. brushed. Does scanlineWidth represent the width of the full scanline here or the slice length? It looks on the surface here like you could potentially overrun your slice. . How is this default calculated?. This could potentially use ref returns + Unsafe.Add<T> @antonfirsov Am i correct?. Love the flexibility this brings! . Great stuff! Yeah, I dunno how they'll do that. Odd . Sounds legit. \ud83d\udc4d . Any reason for not using the static method CreateClean to generate the clean buffer?. Cool. I would say so. Intent is really obviously then. . This feels odd. We're extending the non-generic Image class with Image methods. I get that it works, it just feels odd.. XML docs please. Using's should be inside #if. Unused references in here. Buffer, Diagnostics, Linq. Can be. \nImage<TColor> img = WithSeekableStream(stream, s => Decode<TColor>(stream, options, config));. Unused references in here. Buffer, Diagnostics, Linq, Text. How do I now deep clone an image?. Good thinking. Format tests Hurrah! \ud83c\udf7e . We'll try and get the other merged first. Just added a  review now.. Rainbow. Can I get some descriptions on the private methods here. Just to ensure everyone can easily see exactly what we are testing.. Not sure I follow here but pixel data will be different in jpeg since it's a lossy format. . True dat. . Yeah, that'd be much more explicit. . Aye, Enumerable does the same. . Agreed. I'd really like to see a more centralized approach. Glad you're making progress! . I say drop it. 1.3 covers everything we had before except NET 4.5 Which I don't want to support anyway.. I wanted Color and ColorVector to have the same available static properties without having to directly call that file. . Sweet. I'll be duplicating the Color.Transforms class also eventually. Just wanna get this in first.. I wanted to keep this these as lightweight struct as I was accessing it so much. Since I can't define a parameterless constructor I used a method. I need to fix this actually since I don't think it's threadsafe.. Can we now rename this to ZLibInflateStream for consistancy?. Use DebugGuard here.. Ah right!... Sorry, knackered. Late here and I've been working on ICC profile stuff. . No need to do this. Use the <content> tag for additional partial classes. I actually need to go through the solution and fix duplicate tags on many partial classes.. Are these used? I don't think they are.. See previous <content> comment. Fix other class and you can remove this.. Unused references.. Unused references. Let's use the summary descriptions from Vector4BlendTransforms here.. Can we fix the class descriptions for all these default types to reflect their functionality.. Has anyone benchmarked this? The existing functions that implement  Vector4BlendTransforms.cs are per-pixel. I think we should actually scrap that class + Rgba32 and RgbaVector transforms and us a single set of functions throughout. . Use the method summaries from Vector4BlendTransforms.cs. See above. Is there anything stopping you doing this as part of the PR?. Why can this not be parallel? I see we are using the 3x faster parallel version in Polaroid() but this one for Glow(). What's this all about?. There's a bug here. We're not passing the resized image to our blend method.. I'm gonna have to learn T4 template syntax aren't I? \ud83d\ude1d \nI don't find this that hard, just time consuming.. I thought BufferSpan<T> already used that no?. Or do you mean for when we switch it out?. I'm confused.\nhttps://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/blob/f018838ff98f53573e2761ba7b0d61c44f1951b9/src/ImageSharp/Common/Memory/BufferSpan%7BT%7D.cs#L103. \ud83d\udc4d . Sweet. . \ud83d\udc4d . @antonfirsov Ah yeah, make sense. Didn't realize they were using intrinsics.\nRe T4, we're already using it for Block8x8F so I'm not adverse to it I just want use to be kept to a bare minimum. . This doesn't need to compose as Normal should return Source if not transparent. . Vignette and anything calling it should use the same approach. Time to delete Vector4BlendTransforms. Ignore this. Utter nonsense, Head's not in the game this morning. . Awesome, J'approuve!. Mind and update the tests!. Yeah, that's clearer, will do.. Ugh, just realised that VS doesn't currently support intellisense based on inheritdoc. I don't want to stop using it though as it massively cuts down on errors duplicating XML docs and Wyam already supports it for our API docs. \nIt looks like MVC are planning to use post processing to augment their XML output. I think we should follow suite. \nhttps://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/issues/928. Original logic was incorrect. DisposalMethod.Unspecified is already the default and unless we are doing something crazy with the gif between decoding/encoding we should definitely copy the properties across. Devs have the power now to set each frame value independently should they choose. . Yeah, good to remove.. There's no harm in doing this. We want to inline as many small private methods as we can really. . If I declare the byte as non-ref though am I not creating a copy? . The reason I kept it like that was due to the encoder versions requiring the refs (We don't want to declare them twice for encoding then counting) so it felt better to use the same pattern. It does all feel hella clunky though. \nI really wish we could do some sort of clever wrapper using Span<T> and #ifdefs . Yeah very little pinning going on in the library now. . @antonfirsov  blahFooBarPointer would be the technically correct name methinks. I reckon this is good to go now.\n@KodrAus Easy enough to miss when you're not used to the Span<T> style api. fooBarBaseRef?. Shortening to Ref is fine since ref is a known keyword.. Go for it. Just realised that we're not actually renting those arrays.. Thanks for explaining @antonfirsov Yeah, limited by current IPixel API and how we then communicate with streams. This is a workaround to get things working at least.   . The API was a good start but we have better toys to play with now so sounds good to me. Let's see what you come up with. . YES!! Love it! . Do what you need on this PR. . I'm assuming you mean bulk operations etc? I can internalize this for now. It's not something that is explicitly required for the moment. . The API is actually very similar to the EXIF profile API. If we don't lazy initialize the properties we could potentially really hurt decoding performance. It should never be slow enough to negatively affect the user once we are past that point though.\nI've always assumed we want this to be writable so this looks correct to me.. All cool. \ud83d\udc4d  I've internalized all of it for now. \nThe only reason IColorConversion.Convert() is not static is because some converters require the specific whitepoint to be passed. I guess we could refactor that to pass the whitepoint. \nIChromaticAdaptation exists as there are multiple possible adaption types, we only use VonKriesChromaticAdaptation for now though. However, there's no need for us to be passing IColorConversion etc through the constructor, they're concrete with no alternative methods.\nBear in mind it's already 96% faster than the original code from Colourful! \ud83d\ude04 . Agree. Drop it, the implicit cast is enough and I think MS want to push people to use Span<T> as much as possible. . Ah yes, of course!\nI'm happy to change pixels to Span<TPixel> makes sense and certainly does no harm.. I'm assuming I'm able to assign that once vs evaluating it on each request?\ne.g.\nthis.pixelBuffer = newPixels;\nthis.Pixels = new Span<TPixel>(this.pixelBuffer, 0, this.Width * this.Height);\nvs\npublic Span<TPixel> Pixels => new Span<TPixel>(this.pixelBuffer, 0, this.Width * this.Height). Yeah, there's a few places I'd like to visit in the codebase re PixelAccessor. \ne.g\nhttps://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/blob/631545a7561817fb7aff2defb4422dbff41c96d6/src/ImageSharp/Formats/Gif/GifDecoderCore.cs#L477\nBut I think I'll leave that till after this PR. We've touched a lot of files already and I'd like to get the public API out there first.. I went with evaluating each time to follow existing patterns.. Of course, yeah. Thanks!. Cool. Will do.. Yeah, good idea will do that.. Is there an eta on ReadOnlyBuffer<T>?. OK... I just want to be careful about anything we add to a public API. . Cool. I'll have a good dig through asap.. It does certainly seem that way. Every reference I checked the span length is sufficient. \nThis is a fantastic piece of work btw @antonfirsov The API is so much better now and all tests are passing. Other than this it's got the full seal of approval. \nDo you think the next move after this would be to pass the Vector4 instances by ref? 4 floats must be expensive copying around. Actually surprised System.Numerics doesn't use ref more.. If you think it's best to keep count then I support your judgement.. Yeah, that makes sense to me.. Sucking up to @antonfirsov  now! \ud83d\ude1b \nGood to see!. The great thing about source control is we can always change it in the future. It's not a blocker for this PR as far as I'm concerned. . It should be. I think we're implementing all the Porter Duff equations.. You might wanna change this. . PointF good \ud83d\udc4d . Had a quick look at the RectangularPolygon? source since I didn't know what it was. Was surprised not to see Vector2.Distance in the distance calculations. Am I missing something obvious?. I think we should try to use Buffer<T> as much as possible in new code. I there we can then organise what pool to use per type.. Cool. Was just curious, Need to get stuck into that source. \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83d\udc4d Quality should be a property of the encoder. Having it global just confuses everybody.. I don't think I'm using any of this anymore. It can go.. This is supposedly faster. This needs fixing properly. This means that the test files are now lazy loaded. No more mental CPU after every build!. You wanna give that a pop as one of the initial refactorings? I would probably go with the latter approach making it ArrayPool friendly. . Yeah, definitely a misnomer. It's a port of the libjpeg turbo method plus libjpeg.net. I'm not sure what is causing the poor performance (I was certainly expecting better)\nIf you can separate that out, great! All the examples I've found do it as a single process though. . I don't think we should be trying to predict behavior. If we want grouped operations we should create processors to do that. I.E anything using matrices can actually be combined (we should actually do that), maybe even affine transforms (I tried combining rotate and skew once, it didn't go well \ud83d\ude1d).\nTo me, an imaging API should be imperative, We should optimize the building blocks yeah, but we should strictly follow the input instructions. . Yes we should!\nI like Mutate() and Clone() but I'm still not comfortable with the Apply() lambda indirection, much preferring the simplicity that was present before when invoking the processors. Writing an IImageProcessor should be easy enough for anyone with the requirement to do so. \nI still feel strongly also that our API should be imperative and we should always only operate on what instructions we are given. \nSo I'm voting to remove Apply() for now.\n. I don't fancy CurrentImage much either.\nWhat use cases are we thinking of? Before there was just a simple loop so each processor always had access to the up-to-date image dimensions from the image passed to the processor.. Ah... Hold on @antonfirsov , I think this just clicked. \nApply() is good, very good in fact, I'd somehow missed DelegateProcessor and how that works. Apologies to all for my slowness here. I can't believe I missed that! \ud83d\ude33 \n@tocsoft You have my approval. Let's update this from our main branch and do comment cleanup/namespace changes and get it out there. \ud83d\udc4d \n. @antonfirsov I think the difference is that we were looking at 200+ changes and have visibility of the internals which complicates things. There's a phrase in English \"Can't see the wood for the trees\" which describes perfectly my issues with understanding here.\nWe should flesh out and heavily comment our examples to make things easier for consumers to understand. I like the name ApplyDelegateProcessor() as it describes exactly what we are doing but do we need the user to be aware of the underlying operation? Maybe with the correct intellisense docs Apply() can be enough.. I just hit upgrade. Blame MS. :tongue:. Yeah, we can fix that as we optimize post beta.. @antonfirsov I see where you're going there and it does seem safer. As far as I can see we don't actually new up a frame anywhere within our codebase.\n@tocsoft I'd rather we treated images as a whole and avoid adding IFrameProcessor's. Seems like we'd be creating a complexity level that would be difficult to follow. . This isn't currently being used?. I know this doesn't appear to speed things up in the benchmarks but I think these should probably be static. It would reduce memory pressure and every little helps. . Sorry, I mean the Vector<T> instance. I've seen similar elsewhere with Vector4 also.. No worries.. Ok, lets leave it as it is just now then. I'll let you do the merge \ud83d\udc4d . Some of them (the non-buggy ones) I would say we could get rid of.. I like that a lot!. Bugger... Turns out the equality operators do not compare the sequence. https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Memory/src/System/Span.cs#L308. Span has a specialized SequenceEquals for bytes. Was gonna use it but now can't get ASCII encoding on 1.1. Yeah, thought just grabbing the package would be easy and I rushed a workaround so fixing it would be great! \nOnly thing I'd like to do now is split the ParseStream method into two methods separating out the marker searching and the switch statement. \nI experimented with using the raw stream for all the bits outside the ScanDecoder but never got that working... We'd be able to associate the InputProcessor with the decoder only and possibly speed that portion of the code up. Another time perhaps. . No. Good spot. I'll delete it, thought I already had. . Can we use the same casing style here please as the rest of the solution. BitmapCoreHeader, Also rename the folder so there are no spaces. . Casing as before please. Casing please. How does this relate to the CieXyz struct already present in the library. Can we reuse that?. Casing again please.. Duplicate <TargetFrameworks/> declarations. What were the requirements for 2.0? . Nit. IMO this should be <see/>.. Why have we touched this? Are we now able to do the profiling we needed this for. @antonfirsov What are your thoughts?. Unfortunately not, it's far too large. I'd like to investigate pooling and copying the stream though, to an instance contained within the ExifProfile class.. This line is breaking the build. It needs to be a property.. I made the assumption that if one exists, both will. Why wouldn't you do this? I had users asking for EXIF parity with ImageProcessor. . Will do, good point.. We would yeah, crop also. I'd love to have it centralized but how would it be aware of the required changes?. I think this could be better using Buffer2D<Bgr24> you would pool the array then and avoid the multiplier.. @antonfirsov Sorry yeah, I meant Buffer2D, looking below though at the decompression routing I don't know if it's possible to use it though. Depends on what cmd[0] yields. \n@georgexcollins What do you think? You're the only one out of us who knows this part of the format \ud83d\ude04 . Yeah, I wanna replace all of them and remove the method very soon.. Indeed! I'll have a look. I don't think we can do that actually since we do not know which row to write to in UncompressRle8\nI've merged as-is for now.. @georgexcollins The CreateClean methods should work fine to create an instance that is clean for the required number of elements. \nIt is possible however that the underlying array could have populated param type elements at the tail but they are outwith the maximum possible position in the 2D Buffer.\nFeel free to submit another PR if you think you can improve on what you have. \ud83d\ude04 . Fool of a Took! @antonfirsov You're absolutely right of course, I can't believe I missed that! \n@georgexcollins I'm gonna add that optimisation as part of #368 to save you the effort. \n. If it doesn't work in parallel there's little point using Parallel.For. Why are these unchecked? Can we really go outwith int bounds?\n. I'd really like to get this working for any passed in resampling algorithm rather than just bilinear.  Could we refactor this to use weighting algorithms? @antonfirsov What do you think?. How do I choose between rotation sampling algorithm?. \ud83d\udc4d . Resize essentially calculates a collection of sampled weights for rows and columns based on the given algorithm and the input output size, then a window (of length determined by the algorithm) within that collection is summed and the input vector is then multiplied by that sum. \nOur implementation is complicated to follow but it's a good sacrifice to make for the superior performance it delivers.\nThere's a good introduction to resampling here.\nhttp://entropymine.com/imageworsener/resample/. I'll refactor to not use default and throw after the switch . I think you've found an issue. I'm not sampling the offset correctly .\nI'm starting at zero when I should be starting at -radius. I'll have a look.. I noticed this also. With a single Transform method I could simplify the affine transforms to a single class rather than duplicating code. \nYou need the rounded center in order to get the length of the window no?. Much better results now for the larger window samplers. We still get slight offsetting for those samplers but that's simply how they work and our output images are tiny so we notice it more. \nNo-one in their right mind would use a Lanczos8 sampler for rotation anyway \ud83d\ude1b. . PR on Core submitted https://github.com/SixLabors/Core/pull/11. In rotate, yeah, i'm gonna refactor that. The potential time saved is not worth the code complexity.\nRe our resampling, fixing the dimensions is easy - a missing MathF.Ceiling when calculating the bounds. I cannot get it to match the ImageMagick quality though and I don't know why. \ud83d\ude26 \nMaybe I'm using the wrong weights or something. . I'll have a look. The CreateDestination method is used to determine the size of the destination output in the base class so we require a known height/width then. This takes place before BeforeApply so I might not be able to do much.. I think I'm gonna drop the expand option and always expand the canvas as it's the most common use-case by far. if someone wants to crop it they can do so as a separate operation. \nIt's making the maths annoying and overly complicated for our optimized methods. . Dammit! I knew this, just forgot. wish we had a way around that.. We don't use anything useful from the base class now so this will be refactored to stand alone. This is where the bug was, I was adding the shifted component instead of the originals, the rest is optimization code.. Both the original C codebase and the C# port use ABGR ordering in their calculations. I changed it to RGBA in this one ages ago but that complicates debugging so I changed it back.. Previously the rotations that fell under that category (90, 180, 270) actually ignored the expanded value and automatically expanded anyway. Not updating them was a mistake on my part.. Tbh, I don't think it is better. . Depends on how we do the testing. We really should have an expected output + comparison to prevent regression bugs for all these but I wanted approval of the output before I created standard files.. Aye maybe. Let's get the basics in first then expand. Those Transform.Origin values could maybe complicate things . Perhaps, I'd probably choose Triangle though for performance. . No, the extents are used for getting the sub-pixel values to pass to the resampler. If you round them that's how you end up with the crappy output I had initially plus you'd get gaps or no output at all for resamplers with a radius < 1. . Does this give much of a performance boost? Didn't know if it would be worth the allocation.. I know \ud83d\ude41 . They're all definitely accurate. I just wanted to wait til We have this in before updating/adding test images.. Will update.. Some yes, some no. I'm happy to drop the ones we don't leaving only the ones that require extra parameters.. OK, will do.. I don't think this is correct. The last translation back will be incorrect due to pre-scaling. \nIn order to calculate the correct matrix you would need to also alter the last translate back to take into consideration the new dimensions.\nvar translateBack = Matrix3x2.CreateTranslation(toCenter * s);\n. Using a Rectangle allows us to use Rectangle.Intersect though and easily handle negative values. \nI'm not really following what your expectations are (I must be feeling slow), would it be possible for you to diagram them out? We should see what other libraries do also. . \ud83d\udc4d Great news, thanks!. Let's use two distinct methods here with overloads. I'm not a big fan of using optional parameters in inherited methods; it can often lead to breaking changes since this could well become a public API. . Agreed. . That situation will happen more often than not since 3 out of 4 of our currently supported image formats are commonly RGB.\nIf it's going to be part of the interface then both The property and its type should be renamed as it's just confusing now. What would the equivalent information be called in other libraries?. Lets flesh out the property descriptors here. This doesn't tell me anything and wont help with docs.. Was hoping this wouldn't trip you up. Good research. \ud83d\udc4d . Image<T> and ImageFrame<T> are already reference types?. Please add xml docs\n. We need a better description than this.\nI don't like the name. RawPixelTypeInfo or RawPixelFormatInfo perhaps? Naming is hard!\nWhatever we choose the property name on the interface should match.. You'd need to keep it in sync with changes to TPixel in that case and the PR utilizes it purely for the raw format. It can be one or the other, not both.. Why were the namespaces altered in this class?. >But maybe these are just different things, and sharing a common interface is an LSP violation.\nI'm not sure... Reading through the code again I now see why I'm uneasy and suggested the change. It's because it's merging the two identities as one.\nSee https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/pull/292/files/9f719d5b9423083c112a69144e98a15bbb8c9409#diff-b4f626cf509fdbafd46cc45da8aed941R429 for example. The code takes the raw input format and passes it into the image, which now contains conflicting information. \nMy Suggestion:\n\nDrop that new overload to the Image<TPixel> constructor and calculate the PixelTypeInfo property automatically in our current constructor.\nKeep naming as-is, including interface sharing.\nWrite decent intellisense documentation describing what ImageInfo is, clearly highlighting that it contains the raw info.\n\nThat way we preserve two separate identities. The current raw identity that can be used for making informed decisions as to what TPixel to use etc, and our point-in-time representation of the image pixels.\n. @antonfirsov The former.\nFor Image<TPixel> the PixelType property represents TPixel\nFor ImageInfo the PixelType property represents bits per pixel of the source image.\nKeeping it in sync for Image<TPixel> is simple since it can be calculated in the constructor.. Yeah, let's do the rename. \ud83d\udc4d \n. Do we need this?. Let's keep it then. I want everyone to be able to test the project in their desired IDE.. Either work for me. I'll let you decide.. Absolutely! Merge this as soon as you are satisfied with it. . This variable needs renaming then. It was never correct to begin with really. It needs to describe exactly what the purpose is (I can't think of a good name).. Yeah that's better. \ud83d\udc4d I'll update the submodule and get this merged.. I was actually wondering about that when I wrote it. Should have profiled but I didn't know whether requesting the property twice was slower.. Where? Am I being blind?. Dammit! :smile:. Why? In the statement you cannot see from the right hand side what the type is. Your suggestion deliberately obfuscates the codebase.. Is this array always jagged?. Since we know that the maximum length is 4 could we stackalloc the array and pass it as a sliced Span<byte> to the Interpolate method?. This looks like it could be vectorized but I could be wrong, @antonfirsov  What do you think?. This and others can use MathF. We have a helper Fast2DArray<T> which might be useful here for n-length 2D objects, it's faster than the jagged array. Though if we template the interpolation we should look at custom structs for each known 2D grid since they'd be much faster.. Sorry, I mean Span<float>.\nThis is what I mean:\nWe use a struct wrapping around a fixed buffer and convert Vector4 to it using Unsafe.As. \nWe can then slice that buffer using Span<float> and prevent any allocation on the heap plus reduce the number of methods you need.\n``` c#\n    unsafe class Program\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Using Unsafe to do clever things!\");\n        Vector4 v = new Vector4(1, 2, 3, 4);\n        Floats f = Unsafe.As<Vector4, Floats>(ref v);\n\n        Interpolate(new Span<float>(f.Values, 1));\n        Interpolate(new Span<float>(f.Values, 2));\n        Interpolate(new Span<float>(f.Values, 3));\n        Interpolate(new Span<float>(f.Values, 4));\n\n        Console.ReadLine();\n    }\n\n    private static void Interpolate(Span<float> span)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Span of length {span.Length} passed.\");\n        for (int i = 0; i < span.Length; i++)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Value at {i} equals {span[i]}\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public unsafe struct Floats\n    {\n        public fixed float Values[4];\n    }\n}\n\nThis will print out.\nUsing Unsafe to do clever things!\nSpan of length 1 passed.\nValue at 0 equals 1\nSpan of length 2 passed.\nValue at 0 equals 1\nValue at 1 equals 2\nSpan of length 3 passed.\nValue at 0 equals 1\nValue at 1 equals 2\nValue at 2 equals 3\nSpan of length 4 passed.\nValue at 0 equals 1\nValue at 1 equals 2\nValue at 2 equals 3\nValue at 3 equals 4\n``. Ah yeah! That would work, we only care about a minimum value at this point. Ace!.typeof(T)would be a compile time calculation and less expensive.. This only works if your vector range is0-1, forShort4ranges from-37267to37267`. That's why I've relied on the image format to handle transparency so far.. The scaled approach is the same I found in the libjpeg source so I wonder why it would produce such different output? Happy for you to replace it in the future with your SIMD wizardry though!. I do wonder whether we should be using the ScaledVector approach for all our methods. it would slow things down slightly for the more exotic types though.. >Maybe we can have ToVector4 and ToScaledVector4 side by side\nI would actually like to see that in the API. Imagine how easy conversion code within the RGBA space would be then!. Good catch! The default implementation would have only worked when mutating not cloning. I've updated and added tests.. Let's get a PR in place against Shapes to add those API's.. This was probably a hangover from the old try..catch..finally pattern from when we were directly using ArrayPool. Are we leaving this TODO for when we PR Shapes?. Didn't know Span had a Fill method. Neat!. When shall we make this and others public?. Diff wouldn't let me highlight where I wanted to\nGetReferenceToOrigo I'm assuming this is a typo? GetReferenceToOrigin perhaps?. AllocateClean2D?. Let's do a follow up once we've done Shapes.. \ud83d\udc4d . Cool, I'm looking forward to MS getting that released. . \ud83d\ude04 Haha... Far better than any language skills I've accumulated.. >If we are unsure, how about hiding this behind IInternalImageProcessingContext<T> to avoid exposing it to users? (While not being blocked by thinking too much on this stuff.)\n@antonfirsov I guess.... Not a huge fan of that though because I then need to cast/check when consuming. \nI just can't see a way to pass the information to the constructors and ensure that the actual processor state is predictable. Making Bounds() a method  communicated, to my eye, that this was a mutable state and shouldn't be read once and reused. \nI could add better comments explicitly declaring that.. No need to pass the parameter here now or to the InputProcessor.. Formatting/encoding? I wish GitHub would highlight what causes mass changes like this.. Can we rename ImageFormatsManager to ImageFormatManager and the property names to match please.. Shouldn't the ImageFormatManager constructor accept these instead?. Great! keep it as-is then . Ah that's better! \ud83d\udc4d . Based on my normal expectations I would be inclined to think the same. However, I think many other devs would expect it to JustWork\u2122. If a stream is non-seekable then it's always gonna end up at 0 since we copy it to a MemoryStream. I thought best to throw rather than silently ignore.. Haha! We'll see what the other chaps think. Off to bed now so will come back to it in the morning. . I would be inclined to remove them. . I wouldn't bother, we've broken tons of things recently and we'll be moving things about more when be fix up the namespaces.. >ImageFormatManager; for example, we can have a derived configuration with a custom memory manager, but image formats shared with default, so if a new format is added later at runtime, the derived configurations automatically pick that new format.\nBut what happens if someone want a more restrictive list in a separate location? It would then be a lot of work creating and populating the new manager.\n. I would expect so yeah. .NET needs a DeepClone() method to make this all easier!. I'm happy to move them there. \ud83d\udc4d . We'll need this to pass to the FrameQuantizerBase{TPixel} class as the constructor takes the IQuantizer interface. You have got me thinking though about the Dither property. We don't need it as long as this is set but we'll have to reverse the default behavior in order to avoid the dev having to pass null to a constructor (which I find icky). Currently the default constructor diffuses.\ne.g \n\nnew OctreeQuantizer() 255 colors, no diffusion\nnew OctreeQuantizer(128) 28 colors, no diffusion\nnew OctreeQuantizer(DiffuseMode.FloydSteinberg) 255 colors, FloydSteinberg.Diffusion\nnew OctreeQuantizer(DiffuseMode.FloydSteinberg, 128) 128 colors, FloydSteinberg.Diffusion\n\nI'll probably change the DitherType name to DiffuseMode also to match the dithering API.\nOr maybe passing null is ok?\n. We don't use the KnownXXX anymore within the API, I dropped that with the namespace refactor since it didn't match the normal MS convention.. > XXXMode intuitively suggests a closed API to me. \nYeah, you're right, it does doesn't it. Mode isn't a standard suffix, the naming is usually something that would clash horribly with our namespaces.\nI'm happy to change all our static aggregators to use the prefix Known again as it does open up the API.\n. I'll ask Immo. Yeah they should....\ud83d\ude0b . Haha new I'd missed something \ud83d\ude04 Updated.. stackalloc + Span<byte> ?. \ud83d\udc4d A good, simple win. We could use Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(FileType + FileVersion) though to make it a little less \"Magic\". The <see cref=\"ReadOnlySpan{byte}\"/>?. See #489 also. Trying to think of a situation where it could be 0. Everything else looks great.. I really wish ExifValue was strongly typed. Can't see how that would be possible though.. TryGetValue is the best pattern. The more of that the better. \ud83d\udc4d . Much cleaner \ud83d\udc4f . I\u2019m not convinced by the need for this. We don\u2019t have it for the existing vector methods and we don\u2019t need any temporary allocations just now. . My bad, they do exist. Was looking in the wrong place! Will update now. I've pushed the PixelOperations plus tests but in this instance I do not feel that we warrant that allocation at all. We're over-complicating a very simple operation. We're looping in PixelOperations! \nWhat I have noticed though is that we cannot run a parallel operation within ImageFrame<T> using anything other the default configuration ParallelOptions values for the action. \nWe are passing MemoryManager instance to the frame constructor when we should be passing the Configuration instance.. Ok, forgot about the Rgba32 optimizations you did. I've made the change and am using the default configuration for now. I'll open another PR for passing the Configuration instance. Damn that's nice!. I think you might be reading this wrong. I\u2019m getting the expected output. Hold on, you\u2019re right! This path is definitely called, how the hell did I produce correct output. \nI\u2019ll update and investigate . Yeah you end up with a black and white image. Agreed. Will get on that.. I think these would be better expressed in hex so we can match them should we ever require a hex editor. . Much cleaner!. I love seeing code like this replaced with BinaryPrimitives. \ud83d\udc4d Was wondering about this.. Could we refactor this test to use the PngChunkType enum + BinaryPrimitives?. Clever!. It's probably better to actually do the stackalloc now. We'll forget otherwise. . Because the images are actually fine. I checked them with jpeg snoop and there were no errors. . I didn't realize that. Thought they were all buggered.\nI want to do a big refactor of the unit tests, grouping everything properly into namespaces etc. . I thought it would be better cache wise. Benchmark is looking good with it also. Blindly copied from wherever I got the original Huffman code. If short works great!. \ud83d\udc6e . Found the reference. \nhttps://github.com/mozilla/mozjpeg/blob/master/jdhuff.c#L235\n. This is a micro-optimization but remember span is slower than array on older platforms so we should be careful not to reduce throughput.. dest.A = this.PackedValue to save some shifting.. So much nicer!. These should be generated via PixelOperations{TPixel}.Generated.tt. Are we not missing the method generation here for Rgba32, Rgb24, Bgra32, and Bgr24?. No worries, I'm cloning your fork now so will have a look . I'd actually like to keep this as a separate entity if I can. . Can we remove all the #ifdefs please.. This is a neat refactoring! Can you rewrite it to use the standard for loop syntax though to improve readability. That ++x gets lost in the body.. It's funny... Whatever source I used when first writing these filters had \"predicator\", it's definitely \"predictor\" though, they use that word in the spec! \ud83d\ude04 . Good! This was a hangover from when we didn't have the interface methods.. This should yield a big improvement.. Good fix, thanks! \nTBH though we should be testing the content of the error message, rather simply that the error is thrown.. I'll have to do some tests locally to ensure the output is expected. The class is based on a Skia example and and old Charles Petzold blog post.. Yeah should not. The content is unimportant . It was easier than tracking both positions. We could compare I guess then only seek if required. . I'm not a fan of nullable type properties on classes. I'm voting no.. Thanks for adding the extra tests, they affirm the expected output well.. My issue with nullable properties is that you cannot now be confident as a consumer of their value. TPixel is a struct anyway so doesn\u2019t need to be nullable. Assign a default(TPixel) initial value. . Transparent isn\u2019t the same as default. Rgb = 255.. Could you please rename this to backgroundColor. Clear would be a verb.. It wasn't a question of handicapping the API nor one of fear. Nullable properties have their place, just not in any API where you hold all the cards.\nTake for example the new ResponseHeaders class from Microsoft.Http.Abstractions. The ContentLength property there is of type long? this makes perfect sense since the HttpResponse might not provide a content-length header.  \nWe have absolute control over that property and assigning it so Nullable would have been the incorrect option design wise.\nOn that note... I wonder whether this should be a property of the ImageFrame<T> itself?  That way we base any non-background color assigned frames on the root frame which would keep the property in line with the Width/Height properties. . this.PixelBuffer.Span.Fill()?. Clearing is a process and belongs in the processing namespace; we don't want to clutter the ImageFrame class. We also never want to expose the ParallelOptions as a field. They are part of the Configuration Class and are globally set.. clearColor => backgroundColor. Move this to the ImageFrame<TPixel> and add to the constructor there. Use RootFrame as a default for subsequent frames. No need for field. Assign straight to the property. (When you move all this to ImageFrame). Does this have a caller? The above code works directly on the Span. \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83d\udc4d . This is good! I actually wanted to introduce the configuration as a parameter and drop the MemoryManager overload so we're halfway there. . Let's create an overload for this that accepts a color, then we cover all bases.. I think we don\u2019t actually need the interface. I can\u2019t see why someone would need to implement it themselves. . Yeah, always choose overloads.. Does this marker declare it's length? If so we might be able to simply skip the length.. We can just skip the remaining value same as the other markers. . I don't think so as far as I'm aware.. Ideally we should update Core and let this dependency float through implicitly.. @iamcarbon Good man. \ud83d\udc4d . ReadOnlySpan<byte>. Target buffer is of type TPixel. Would we not check this before iterating. Guard.IsTrue(frames.Count > 0)?. Nice!. Love it.. \ud83d\udcaf . Good idea!. Legit, forgot about IEnumerable.. Yeah this should be GradientBrushBase.. It was Resharper, probably due to the struct being a partial.. Can we move this to AssignResolution and rename that to InitDerivedMetaDataProperties, The return above prevents us reading more than we need to when we are identifying images.. Can we move this to InitDerivedMetaDataProperties. Both Decode and Identify call ParseStream in both decoders. We want to return at that point in PdfJs decoder to avoid reading the entire SOS segment when we don\u2019t need to. So using break slows us down. \nI can move the method if you like? Save you the bother.. \ud83d\udc4d It's only public as we use it for tests. The class is internal so not available to consumers.. It doesn't seem to affect our testing timings much so I'm inclined to keep it simple for now.. I'm just looking at that exact segment. Thought it might be that! \ud83d\ude04 \n. Move this to Dispose or stick it in a try..catch..finally. I don't like this out API we don't know where the buffer is coming from so can't follow it's lifecycle. I think QuantizedFrame should be IDisposable and manage its own buffers.. We'll need to clean up and consolidate these Guard classes sometime. I don't think there's anything in the ImageSharp ones that couldn't be moved to Core. I'm actually tempted to make them public.. When do we get to ditch this class? I don't think it's used much now.. Interpolate the constant Size here.. Why do we stackalloc one but not the other?. You mean always false yeah? Been struggling to find a definitive answer but I think 65535x65535 is the maximum size on a 64 bit machine.\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/29175585/what-is-the-maximum-resolution-of-c-sharp-net-bitmap. You've defined GetRootFramePixelBuffer() below but are not using it here.. Lock is an odd name now that we are not pinning. Wouldn't GetRootFramePixelBuffer() also call this? Is it required anymore?. I think we're crossing wires here. 65535 is the max value for a ushort so not anywhere close to int.MaxValue. Incidentally that's the maximum length of any dimensions for a jpeg also. . I have thought about that before but it varies from format to format so we can't. \nI should print this out and frame it btw, I think it's the first time I've ever corrected you! \ud83d\ude1d . Can we avoid this allocation per iteration. Do we know yet whether that identifier is specific to jpeg?. Processors should be immutable. I've already gone through and changed all others before.. Seems to be both CI environments, well variants anyway.. Defo would like a second opinion on this. I had to change some tolerances, I'm assuming code round actually hid differences before.. Yeah, this is useless, but it was the only way I could do any testing just now by round tripping. We need a better reference encoder for png. Yup, very much agree. . Maybe.... We'd probably have to scale up and down via shifting to preserve accuracy though.... Check out the new method using offset + shift I nicked from libpng. Much better!. I want to move the Exif identifier out of the ExifProfile as that's defined as part of the App1 segment itself in section 4.7.2 of the specification. \nhttp://www.exif.org/Exif2-2.PDF\nIdeally we should pass the marker to the ToByteArray method when exporting. The ExifProfile constructor should have an overload accepting the marker. . Fantastic, thanks! . The ExifProfile needs to be format agnostic.. Pass through the code as a ReadonlySpan<bye> copying that to the output array.. Again, pass this to the method. I don't think this should be a member of the options and should only be determined by the DisposalMethod enumeration.. Set via DisposalMethod. We tend to just use the elvis operator in cases like this.. I think they're ok in this class. It appears to me that what you're doing actually conforms to the specification no?. Isn't this unnecessary for the first frame?. Remove this please.. We need to alter this slightly as there's extra checks and balances.\nimage.MetaData.SyncProfiles(); is required before writing according to the jpeg encoder and we need additional length checks as the spec dictates it's length should match jpeg limitations. \nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/blob/d171acba8051063a68467e912f1a81fae1126ed8/src/ImageSharp/Formats/Jpeg/JpegEncoderCore.cs#L608. @dlemstra What do you think?. Do we need these references? They were commented out.. It\u2019s weird. The exact same difference before and after the update. . I did think about this but if someone creates a custom PaletteQuantizer implementation then it doesn't matter what frame is used. Plus it would vary from image to image.. I've read a lot of Java source \ud83d\ude04 . Wow yeah! It's definitely different to the output on my machine. That explains that then.\nI need to get my head around the tolerance values. At the moment writing 1.5F/100 (Is that 1% over 100 pixels?) isn't immediately intuitive and we should write a helper that makes it more clear.\n . I thought there were improvements to what can be inlined that would allow this. I could be wrong though. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f . That's much more clear, thanks!. Looking at this it appears we should simply the split data into 64k chunks.  http://dev.exiv2.org/issues/1232\nThat means we need an extend method, like the ICC readeron decoding.\nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/blob/d7bd82b79ee396a42b13a83563e4fbdd951c2a55/src/ImageSharp/Formats/Jpeg/PdfJsPort/PdfJsJpegDecoderCore.cs#L508. Good catch!. I like having a class but I think you're right about the tables property. I'll hide that away and introduce a GetTableSpan() method.. Will do!. Sometimes I miss Resharper.. I'll split out the Refinement part into a separate method.. Good catch!. Got the unused, different line though so Github won't see it.. Big allocation here. Use the MemoryAllocator.. Allocation. Allocation. We appear to be getting the luminance twice?. SixLabors.ImageSharp.Processing.Normalization?. What rule are you applying re Inlining? I would consider both properties an equality methods ideal candidates. . Aye good thinking, that's likely the case (would like to check sometime though to be certain). Colorspace code is performing well anyway.. I'll update it to <see cref=\"PixelResolutionUnit.PixelsPerInch\"/> since that would be the default on a new instance.. Almost. The PixelResolutionUnit enum also has PixelResolutionUnit.PixelsPerMeter. That's why I haven't added it.. Overload?. Use Previous Visual Studio 2017 image in appveyor.yml. \nhttps://ci.appveyor.com/project/six-labors/imagesharp/build/1.0.0-PullRequest00649000167\nCan someone raise an issue with them please. I'm not gonna be online for long this evening.. NM. Managed to do it . \nhttps://github.com/appveyor/ci/issues/2519. Way ahead of you \ud83d\ude09 \nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/commit/1223f786240d05cd7c2abd80565389a7b747dd1e#diff-fdada74c86b339c6ed2bc530c7c8b390R13. We're mixing two DebugGuard methods now. We should ditch the ImageSharp one.. Yeah, though I was wondering whether we should just make them public and avoid duplication? They're useful and well tested.. Hide them then. We can investigate private packages like they use for ASP Core in the future . Should this min value be 1?. I'm pleading still jetlagged. Good spot, I've opened https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/pull/671 to deal with it.\nWhat do you think elsewhere? Looking good?. We should do something to reduce the allocations here.. I feel like we can possibly do some offsetting and move the Abs out of the loop here.. AddPixelsToHistogram. Much more readable! \ud83d\udc4d . We should keep an eye out for more things like this but I suspect you already have it covered \ud83d\udc4d . Good catch. Yeah I'll add a simple one.. \ud83d\ude0d . I'm tempted to remove this class and have each format Info implement the interface. The internal constructors on those derived classes allow us the freedom to alter the classes but this classes would now be fixed and exposed.. I considered that actually. Probably wise.. Agreed. I wanted to use IImageFormat but what instance do you use as a key and how do you access it from the extension methods?. I don't mind not sharing. I avoids potential ambiguity and ensures future format support can't break anything. . I like this!!!. Yeah, what I wanted though was a means of enforcing the standard. I'm still not sure.. What do these new constraining checks do?. Do we want to throw?. Are these called by per-row operations or are they purely for per-pixel operations?. I couldn't find the callee Blend method in the diff but it's imperative now that if we are mixing pixel formats and conversion to/from Vector4 needs to used the scaled conversion methods.. I think this is what I was referring to before. Should be ToScaledVector4() with the reverse PackFromScaledVector4() on repacking.. If they are called from bulk we shouldn't be clamping per pixel.. I think it'll be best to fix clamping here while we are working on it.\nIn the internal method PorterDuffFunctions.NormalSrc(Vector4 backdrop, Vector4 source, float opacity) the opacity is clamped before being used as a multiplier.\nAs far as I can see that method is only called by.\nPorterDuffFunctions.NormalSrc<TPixel>(TPixel backdrop, TPixel source, float opacity)\nNormalSrc.Blend(TPixel background, TPixel source, float amount)\nNormalSrc.BlendFunction(Span<Vector4> destination, ReadOnlySpan<Vector4> background, ReadOnlySpan<Vector4> source, float amount)\nNormalSrc.BlendFunction(Span<Vector4> destination, ReadOnlySpan<Vector4> background, ReadOnlySpan<Vector4> source, ReadOnlySpan<float> amount)\nThe clamping should take place in the caller methods not the callee, same for the other operations. Only the last method taking the ReadOnlySpan<float> amount requires per-pixel clamping of the values but that seems like something we could do with Vector<float> in the caller in supported architectures.. Thankfully all the changes required can be done in the T4 templates.. I'm happy to make the changes if you like?. @vpenades @antonfirsov Confirmed that changing this fixes tests in 64bit on Net Framework 4.7.1 and 4.6.2\nWe'll need to figure out how to create a reduced sample to report.. Absolutely agree on both methods. We've already constrained the type to a reference type so no need for the complexity.\nI'd actually consider doing similar to ImageMetaData and ImageFrameMetaData. We check and create the metadata in the decoders but it really should always be there.. It just looked weird that's all when we had a mix of both Clone() and DeepClone() together. I'll revert it though. . 4096. \"of the\" both type params.. 64*64 seems like a good default to me. What was the theory behind the decision?. (dividend > 0) ? 1 + ((dividend - 1) / divisor) : (dividend / divisor) Maybe? Seems to work in my local tests.. Agreed \ud83d\udc4d . Good tests! \ud83d\udc4d . Loving this, very clever! \ud83d\udc4d . There's something not right here. We're getting pixels from the end of a row overwriting pixels at the start.\n\n\n. Fixed. Thanks @dlemstra for spotting my daft mistakes.. We avoid index checks using Unsafe. I love how simple this becomes.. Much better as a bool.. Been a big fan of this pattern since you first introduced it. \ud83d\udc4d . If you look at the other thresholding methods we allow the passing the upper and lower thresholding colors as parameters. \nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/blob/c513e574002a4314a7ab8e20613ab4b6eadcf1dd/src/ImageSharp/Processing/Processors/Binarization/BinaryThresholdProcessor.cs#L35\nP.S add braces for if..else. ulong. Use Rectangle.Intersect and then use the bounds in place of height/width below.. You can simplify this using the new default keyword. Rgb24 rgb = default. This looks like it can be parallelized since sum = 0 at each y row. Use ParallelHelper.IterateRows. If you move these declarations inside the loop you can parallelize this also.. I was imagining something a lot simpler than what you've added.\n``` c#\n// Ensure size is populated across both dimensions.\n// These dimensions are used to calculate the final dimensions determined by the mode algorithm.\nconst int min = 1;\nif (tempWidth == 0 && tempHeight > 0)\n{\n    tempWidth = (int)MathF.Max(min, MathF.Round(sourceSize.Width * tempHeight / (float)sourceSize.Height));\n}\nif (tempHeight == 0 && tempWidth > 0)\n{\n    tempHeight = (int)MathF.Max(min, MathF.Round(sourceSize.Height * tempWidth / (float)sourceSize.Width));\n}\n```\nThen delete the two Guard statements below.. Sorry, yeah keep the Guards. I think duplication is ok in this instance. The methods signature for EnsureSizeBothDimensions just doesn't feel right to me.  . Thought I'd got these... Will update.. Matches StbSharp. Matches StbSharp. Why unsafe?. Don't use IImageProcessor<TPixel> unless you know exactly what you're doing.. \ud83d\udc4d Great idea. Really interested in the idea of moving these to PixelOperations. The optimization opportunity there is fantastic.. There was a brief moment a few years back when this method actually existed in the library before! It was used when parsing decimal values for conversion into a Rational.. Much better name.. Good work on this. I'm too lazy at times to do the appropriate discovery work you did.. I like how simple this is now.. I've been using Ref suffix to avoid confusion in most places but happy with Ptr here.. This can be optimized. . This and others is incorrect. Will lead to a packed value of 255.. * 257. This only works with Vector4 but is being used for Rgba32 etc.. Agreed. I agree. I\u2019m glad you brought this up as they\u2019ve never sat well with me. Will do that tomorrow . You mean the reference to the offset? I only know that inside the loop. . I think to make this worthwhile I'd have to premultiply the pixels of the entire working area in one go which would mean allocating a Vector4 buffer for the entire working area +  radius top and bottom. I think this would quickly become unwieldy.  . I'd have to add a GetRowSpan() method to the matrix. \nI just remembered why it doesn't exist. As I recall when benchmarking the matrice code the dimensions were so small that creating the span was more expensive than simply indexing. We're only talking about 3x3 in most cases. . These checks were there originally because this would have been two loops and there was no guarantee that the matrices were the same dimensions. However I just checked and all the matrices using the method are so I'll clean this up.. DenseMatrix<T> is a readonly struct. The indexer is benchmarked to be as fast as raw 1D array indexing. . Agreed. I'll merge this for now  and we can bash out some designs in the future. I'd like to get this right before we make the processors public.\nFYI. Re the benchmark. It benchmarks iterating across entire arrays of different sizes.\nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/blob/13850d1fec2af49176d08a3576c5e07b7430e476/tests/ImageSharp.Benchmarks/General/Array2D.cs#L113\n. What does s stand for and why do we limit?. .ToRgb24 is soon to be gone as an individual method. We have ToRgb24(Span<TPixel>. See #729 \n. intersect.Width. .85 (1.0 - 0.15) what does this mean?. Yup Windows phone is dead now and the only reason I clung on.\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard#net-implementation-support. It'll likely be several different PR's to our different repos.. We can ditch this also. Merged, and I've updated this PR from master so should be good to use now.. I don't follow. Are you saying that ToRgba() is 9x slower than ToRgba(ref Rgba)? I would have thought the cost of the pointer would outweigh any benefit especially in 64bit mode.. You might wanna benchmark this. The IComparableExtensions version should be a good bit faster.\nI do, however want to ditch the extension method for more clear MathUtils.Clamp*** methods. . Could this perhaps be private so it cannot be called without sanitation? . Add one if you need one.. I do recall reading somewhere it wasn't.. I'm favoring the TypeName(field, field, field) format now for ToString constituency.. Would these come under our Primitives namespace?. How come these are reassigned?. I need to make sure I add the results like this when benchmarking. Really good idea.. Ah right... Makes sense then. Carry on! . We should update the docs to remove \"packed\". Great! Let's update the variable name to describe that.. Perfect!. No worries, I'll update the reference file name later on, will do for now.. That's a good idea. We can and should use both the name and the type.. That works for me.. We should be checking the bit depth here also.. I don't think we need this.. component is unused now.. I wonder where else we can apply this?. Neat trick. This makes me think that your IDCT/Colorspace code is very fast and we're still missing an optimization opportunity somewhere in the Huffman decoding process. \nLooking through the MozJpeg/LibJpegTurbo code there's  decode_mcu_fast and decode_mcu_slow in jdhuff.c which seems to back this up.. We might not be able to use it in gif as individual frames sometimes only contain data in some pixels but both png and bmp should definitely benefit.. > My thought is that S.D is slow for progressive images for some reason.\nThat's what I mean. They're not able to use an optimized path. Looking at jdphuff.c there's no fast/slow branching so they have to do what we do. I think for us to match them, we should look at the jdhuff.c file and see what we can make of it and how it compares to our baseline decoder.. The error would only occur if someone did this which would compile because I'm having to hack the generic constraints. \nc#\nvar quantizer = new PaletteQuantizer<Rgba32>(palette);\nvar frameQuantizer = quantizer.CreateFrameQuantizer<Rgb24>(configuration);\nWhat I will do is mask the generic methods in that class with non-generic versions.\nc#\nvar quantizer = new PaletteQuantizer<Rgba32>(palette);\nvar frameQuantizer = quantizer.CreateFrameQuantizer(configuration);\nThe only way for them to cause the error now would be to explicitly cast...\nc#\nvar quantizer = new PaletteQuantizer<Rgba32>(palette);\nvar frameQuantizer = ((IQuantizer)quantizer).CreateFrameQuantizer<Rgb24>(configuration);\nIn which case the error message should be sufficient. \n. Thanks. I've added some basic tests for palette, octree and wu quantizers . Do we still require the custom AotGetPalette method? Looks to me like we can just call GetPalette().. Ah yes, of course... Carry on! \ud83d\ude04 . Very silly of me eh? \ud83d\ude04 . Struggling to follow this online. Why are we adding count here?. Actually I think it's ok as we already throw if the combination is invalid.. Both have 100% coverage as far as I\u2019m aware. . Uh oh! . I dunno, can\u2019t precalculate the correct output canvas then. That\u2019s why size is a requirement of the constructors. The size provided via the context is provided too late.. Are they possible with Matrix4x4?. Any optimisation would be welcome. I hate that it\u2019s on the fly . What is? The conditional?. It\u2019s seems to cover everything I could throw at it, shrinking and growing when need be. There\u2019s actually similar code for handling free transforms in the net framework. . Happy to drop. It was there to allow reuse but yeah, probably not needed. . Yeah, that\u2019s cleaner.. I did experiment with that naming but syntactically it felt incomplete. . Hi would I then fix up the rotation matrix? I need the size to centralise it. . Theoretically yeah I guess. Feel free to have a pop. . Ah yes, I like that! . I\u2019ll double check. I\u2019ve still got R# disabled so my machine doesn\u2019t overheat. Yeah, I think you\u2019re right. I wrote this on a train with a hangover so might have missed a few things. MathFExtensions.DegreeToRadian in Core provides this already.. Well this is a pleasant surprise! I didn't know it had a constructor that too a 3x2 matrix :smile:. we use the entire MathF internal class on unsupported target frameworks. Dunno what rules we should apply. . I've updated Core to expose new GeometryUtilities. I can live with this just now. I don't want to have to do too many calculations outside of these dedicated processors.. I don't think this error is specific to transforms. This image never runs through that code but is a span copy. I think it's got something to do with Rgba32. \n\n. Are we ok using a pointer here without fixing?. Can be readonly.. Could you add a brief description here of what exactly you are testing for?. Ah yes, missed that. Didn't see the Pin() method on Memory<T>.. Not worth us trying to fix it. NN is low quality anyway and 32bit NET Framework would be increasingly rare. I\u2019d put a note and skip test on those platforms. . Remove this comment please.. Fix spelling. These values are being calculated more than once in the same partial struct.. Repeated description. You can also do this as:\n```\nvar hash = new HashCode();\nhash.Add(this.Signature);\n// etc\nreturn hash.ToHashCode();\n```\n. Are you able to shed any light into what issues are blocking us upgrading xunit?. Like I said.... Lush! :smile:. Good man! \ud83d\udc4d . Hmmm... Read section 4.7 here. Lossless jpeg supports additional precision so we should bear that in mind when naming our enum. https://www.w3.org/Graphics/JPEG/itu-t81.pdf\n\nFor DCT-based processes, two alternative sample precisions are specified: either 8 bits or 12 bits per sample. Applications which use samples with other precisions can use either 8-bit or 12-bit precision by shifting their source image samples appropriately. The baseline process uses only 8-bit precision. DCT-based implementations which handle 12-bit source image samples are likely to need greater computational resources than those which handle only 8-bit source images. Consequently in this Specification separate normative requirements are defined for 8-bit and 12-bit DCT-based processes.\nFor lossless processes the sample precision is specified to be from 2 to 16 bits. Can these be hex so it's easier to match them in an editor.. Youthink there's a bug in the reference decoder then?. How does this affect alpha values. Will decoders now have to check each byte to see if we are the V3 ICO variant? \n\nIt would be really nice if we stored the header type as an enum Name - Length in the metadata and gradually build up our ability to write each type starting with v3 and v4.. Can you change this to say \"No readable SOFn (Start Of Frame) marker found\" and move the check to ProcessStartOfScanMarker(). No, don't bother, just add to the comment saying you have done this.. @brianpopow Ah so that was just a method name change. I thought we were changing the header itself!\nWe already have a method to encode 32bit bitmaps, I'm assuming we're doing that wrong then.\nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/blob/db0fc0dd7df4b23236120312419f21916b6c6d8a/src/ImageSharp/Formats/Bmp/BmpEncoderCore.cs#L163\nBy V3 ICO variant I mean this. https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/issues/732#issuecomment-447151183\nYeah, we are not using the metadata, we certainly should be.\n. I've seen the similar handling code in several decoders now. Chrome, Mozilla, ImageMagick, Gimp, all do this when decoding V3 bitmaps. It is hacky IMO also but a necessary evil. \nI'm all for writing the V4 header! \ud83d\udc4d . I just copied what they do with Numerics tests. I think it still adds value as it ensures we touch every field when calculating the hashcode. See below. I don't think it has any practical application outside of ImageSharp.. As you touched upon below this does make sense if our struct is an optimized form of a Matrix5x5 in the manner that Matrix3x2 is an optimized Matrix3x3 which it is. \nMost importantly it works!\nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/blob/f10a96c2d9b288019e7a4b3bcca04cd7ce87179f/tests/ImageSharp.Tests/Processing/Processors/Filters/FilterTest.cs#L45. Are tiles always equal dimensions?. Yeah, that'll be gone in the next commit. I forgot to lazy create the fast AC tables also so none of it actually works!. Agreed. Will do.. Separate declarations are preferred . This isn't doing what the description in the linked document does.\nhttps://microsoft.github.io/Win2D/html/T_Microsoft_Graphics_Canvas_Effects_LuminanceToAlphaEffect.htm\nThe linked effect changes the calculated alpha component to the calculated luminance and each pixel color component to 0.\nYours looks like you are multiplying the color components by the luminance and maintaining the original alpha value.. Ah ok so it's a combination of the three methods. \nWhat I don't understand about your calculation then is that it the result doesn't spread evenly across all pixels like I would expect. (I can't find any papers or equivalent methods describing this)\nThe algorithm in my head would be the inverse of the grayscale matrix algorithm. Where 0 would be completely grayscale and 1 remained unchanged.\n. Ok.... So even if we are simply adjusting the luminance this doesn't match any known formula I could fathom.\nIt seems to be nearly accurate if all the input vector values are the same but different should the individual component values change.\nFor example given the following input:\nInput\n<1, 1, 1, 1>\nAmount\n0.667\nWith your calculation the result looks like this.\nLuminance Calc\n<0.333, 0.333, 0.333, 1>\nAnd the result of converting the Rgba input to YcbCr and adjusting the luminance is as follows\nRound Trip Luminance Calc BTU.601\n<0.3333333, 0.3333333, 0.3333333, 1>\nRound Trip Luminance Calc BTU.709\n<0.3333333, 0.3333333, 0.3333333, 1>\nThat looks good to me, the luminance change has been spread nicely across all pixel components.\nHowever, given the following input:\nInput\n<0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1>\nAmount\n0.667\nYour calculation yields the following vector.\nLuminance Calc\n<0.1724779, 0.3449559, 0.5174338, 1>\nWhereas round-tripping yields the following.\nRound Trip Luminance Calc 601\n<-0.0509804, 0.1960784, 0.4470589, 1>\nRound Trip Luminance Calc 709\n<-0.05882353, 0.1882353, 0.4392157, 1>\nHere's the full dump from LinqPad.

The reason I\u2019m trying to understand the algorithm and reproduce it is because its functionality does not conform to its name. What you are doing is some sort of histogram contraction not luminance reduction. \nWhen we add a processor to the core library it should contain functionality that is both correct and useful for all. Currently this feels like something that would be better suited to your personal project as it\u2019s functionality is specific to your requirements only. \nOnce we get the required bits of the library exposed you would be able to implement it as a processor with all the additional performance tools. Right now you should still be able to implement it but you would have to iterate per pixel and handle premultiplication yourself. . Ah! Bad James!. Logic would dictate yes but I can add a rough benchmark to test I suppose.. ",
    "dlemstra": "I was wondering that also. I haven't tested that yet but I can take a look at it. And we should probably also create a .ruleset file that we should configure in the same way as the stylecop.json file (http://stackoverflow.com/a/38094474/2410453)\nEdit: It does, will try to figure out how we can get rid of it there.\n. Just pushed a patch to resolve the dependency.\n. I personally think that we should create a new repo (e.g. ImageSharp.Docs (too bad that google owns this TLD)) and store the docs there. Doing so will keep the history of this project clean and keep it a bit smaller.\n. Would it be possible to add examples that include images to the documentation? That will have a big impact on the size of the project. And we should only update the documentation when a new release has been published so keeping it in sync is probably not an issue.\n. Yes this is the library that replaces ImageProcessor.Core. The NuGet package was published to reserve the namespace (see: https://www.nuget.org/packages/ImageSharp/). You should use the MyGet repository (https://www.myget.org/gallery/imagesharp) if you want to use the latest development build of this project.\nThe name has also changed so you should be using ImageSharp instead now.\n. The page (https://www.myget.org/gallery/imagesharp) contains a button 'Connect to feed' that will give you the proper URL.\n. I think you are right that we can remove the endianness check since we don't care about the actual integer value. Feel free to remove them. I can add some unit tests for the PixelAccesor after this has been merged but feel free to do them yourself :)\n. I just pushed some unit tests (https://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/commit/e82a5f6e3c0e019d542e0471222d39a7f7a13fac) that make sure the optimized version of PixelAccessor still works after your changes. Copying in your file breaks these tests but its pretty easy to resolve. You will need to fix the order here: https://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/blob/master/src/ImageSharp/PixelAccessor.cs#L63 and here https://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/blob/master/src/ImageSharp/PixelAccessor.cs#L80.\n. Looks great, and thanks for the help. I'll let you handle the merge @JimBobSquarePants.\n. There should be less allocations though because you are using the input array. Still think it should be good to merge your changes.\n. @KLuuKer Making a small sidestep here... Why are you not setting the ExifProfile to null to remove the profile? I do think I still need to add a RemoveInvalidTags() and a Clear() method to the class.\n. @olivif  I am working on some changes to the encoders. I used different naming but I will use yours to explain what I did. I added anIEncoderOptions argument to the Encode method and added and IBmpEncoderOptions argument in the SaveAsBmp method but your idea got me thinking. The encoder method has two overloads. One with IEncoderOptions and one with IBmpEncoderOptions. I could try to cast the object that is passed in to the IEncoderOptions overload and call the IBmpEncoderOptions overload if that works. Then someone could creat a single object that implements the various encoder options. The only issue with that is that you have some kind of hidden functionality. I would rather make it so people can see it in the API.. The IBmpEncoderOptions will only be available in the BmpEncoder. Moving it from a property to the constructor is prob a good idea and I will try and make that work. But that won't really change much for the rest of the API. The Save method: public Image<TColor> Save(Stream stream, IEncoderOptions options) will have the same signature.. I wonder if font support should be in a separate library that uses both the font and the Imagesharp library. What are your thoughts about this @JimBobSquarePants?. We have been talking about splitting stuff up and yes I think we should create an ImageSharp.Drawing library. You can find the other parts here: https://gitter.im/ImageSharp/General?at=584378420da034021b65da62. We already had ImageSharp.Drawing as a separate library.. My vote would also be for option 2 because we might add extra stuff that is only for drawing.. The issue is this line: https://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/blob/master/src/ImageSharp/Formats/Jpg/JpegDecoderCore.cs#L1189. With 4 channels CMYK should be assumed (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/imageio/metadata/doc-files/jpeg_metadata.html). But it looks like only YCbCr is supported in the block inside the if. \n\nIf an Adobe APP14 marker segment is present, the colorspace is determined by consulting the transform flag. The transform flag takes one of three values:\n2 - The image is encoded as YCCK (implicitly converted from CMYK on encoding).\n1 - The image is encoded as YCbCr (implicitly converted from RGB on encoding).\n0 - Unknown. 3-channel images are assumed to be RGB, 4-channel images are assumed to be CMYK\n. Thanks for helping us out with fixing those warnings. I noticed that some of your params/returns don't start with a capital letter. I know it is a bit OCD but could you change that?. There is a StyleCop rule for this but it has not yet been implemented. I am waiting on my pull request (https://github.com/DotNetAnalyzers/StyleCopAnalyzers/pull/2242) being accepted and then can we enable the rule in this project.. A big part in this being slow is the performance of the image decoders and encoders. We are working on improving them and help with this would be really appreciated. . @ vidstige Your NuGet package seems to target net20 instead of netstandard. Are you planning to support netstandard?. Can you rebase this pull request? I made some changes to Bootstrapper.cs that broke this.. Thanks for the fix \ud83d\ude4c. I pushed a patch to make sure that OpenCover will return the exit code from the test. It should now fail when it does not pass the tests.. Great success \ud83d\udc4f All the warnings are gone (after I fixed one that I just added \ud83d\udc4e). I just enabled warnings as errors for the release build. And AppVeyor does a release build so that should prevent us adding extra warnings.. These changes seem to add another extra 4 minutes to our AppVeyor build. But we are building net451 and that should not affect this. Do you have any idea what could have caused this @olivif? Maybe it was just a one time delay?. I found something else. It looks like the tests did not complete properly: \n\nYour build:\n```\nxUnit.net .NET CLI test runner (64-bit Desktop .NET win81-x64)\n  Discovering: ImageSharp.Tests\n  Discovered:  ImageSharp.Tests\n  Starting:    ImageSharp.Tests\n```\nOne of mine:\nxUnit.net .NET CLI test runner (64-bit Desktop .NET win81-x64)\n  Discovering: ImageSharp.Tests\n  Discovered:  ImageSharp.Tests\n  Starting:    ImageSharp.Tests\n  Finished:    ImageSharp.Tests\n=== TEST EXECUTION SUMMARY ===\n   ImageSharp.Tests  Total: 353, Errors: 0, Failed: 0, Skipped: 0, Time: 436.371s\nI don't know how you could trigger a build with a new commit. What I would do in this case would be doing is changing white space inside CodeCoverage.runsettings then do an 'amend commit'  and force push that to your branch. I have done this myself a couple times in another project and that seems to trigger a new build.. Seems like this was a one off. It looks like you added an extra commit to trigger the build. Are you going to reset your master to the previous commit or should I go ahead and merge this?. It is possible that there is HashCode collision, should not be a problem. I did some minor refactoring of your code and now all values are enabled again. . I did some debugging and it turns out that the ulong that is created has the same hashcode.\n```\n\nulong a = 4323521613979991040;\nulong b = 0;\nConsole.WriteLine(a.GetHashCode())\n0\nConsole.WriteLine(b.GetHashCode())\n0\n```. I wonder if we should always have them under the same version number. I think we only need to bump versions when something has changed in that area.\n\np.s. I wonder if we should split up the text drawing in a separate library but maybe we are taking a step to far then.. I don't understand why we would need to be able to inject the bootstrapper. I even remember someone saying people who want this should bugger off: https://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/issues/64#issuecomment-269628881. I think this adds extra complexity to the library and it is a feature that will probably be never used.. I had a chat with @JimBobSquarePants about this and he came up with an example where one part of the process was only allowed to read only jpeg (e.g. upload) and another parts was allowed to write all of the formats. At first sight this looked like a feature that would not be used but I think there can actually be a real world usage for this. I was just a bit worried that we would need to pass it around all the time. But if we can limit the use of the bootstrapper to just the image it should be okay. I do think we probably need to rename the bootstrapper into something like configuration or settings because the name does not really fit the usage any more.. @antonfirsov  Maybe we should make some of these public then? We should be careful with that though. Another solution could be including (link) them in each project where we need them.. You will \"loose contrast\" when you do that operation. First of all you are resizing an image and that will change the colors because multiple pixels are combined into a new pixel. And the format that you are using is JPG which is a lossy format and during conversions some of the information will be lost. You are getting the expected output. You could decide to call .GaussianSharpen(0.5f) on the image before saving i. That will \"sharpen\" it a bit but my advice would be keeping the image like it is now.. Closed by accident, we still need to fix the PNG stuff.. It also took me hours \ud83d\ude04 but found it within 10 minutes after a full night's sleep.. You could call .AutoOrient on the image before you resize it. This will rotate the image to the \"correct\" orientation.. I am guessing that Facebook is changing the image. When you view the image it looks okay: https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1840003%2F21365920%2F1c479680-c6bd-11e6-80e7-ad4016976a7f.gif. I don't have Facebook so I cannot check what is going on there.. Facebook is telling me to login but I don't have an account so I can't check that page. Is this your output image: https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1840003%2F21365920%2F1c479680-c6bd-11e6-80e7-ad4016976a7f.gif? It looks okay to me.. Your problem is clear but I have no idea how you end up with the output file. First you tell us that you resize the image an now you suddenly add a watermark. Can you share a small code sample that we can use to reproduce the issue?. Couldn't you use one variable that contains the count and decrement that with the result of scan.ProcessBlocks and change the while to count being bigger than zero?. I am actually one of the developers for the ImageMagick project and just looked through our code to see how it is done. It should not be very difficult to add this to ImageSharp.  . I wonder which part is slow, what is the output of the following code.\n```C#\nStopwatch sw1 = new Stopwatch();\nsw1.Start();\nstring tmpFilePath = Path.GetTempPath() + \"x-imagesharp\" + Path.GetExtension(filePath);\nusing (FileStream stream = File.OpenRead(filePath))\nusing (FileStream output = File.OpenWrite(tmpFilePath))\n{\n    Image image = new Image(stream);\n    sw1.Stop();\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Image sharp read: \" + sw1.ElapsedMilliseconds);\n    sw1.Restart();\nimage.Resize(200, 300);\nsw1.Stop();\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Image sharp resize: \" + sw1.ElapsedMilliseconds);\nsw1.Restart();\n\nimage.Save(output);\nsw1.Stop();\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Image sharp save: \" + sw1.ElapsedMilliseconds);\n\n}\n``. In ImageMagick we also update the EXIF profile when the image is saved. I will add this feature later today. Thanks @Auersberg.. Cool idea to have support for both 1.0 and 1.3. When my project targets 1.4 it will pick the 1.3 version instead of the 1.1 one? I don't like the double negative in!NO_FILE_IO. You could useNETSTANDARD1_3instead. . @antonfirsov I don't think we need coverage for debug only stuff. I did not run the tests because I thought they would not be affected.. The library is specifically designed to run on as many platforms as possible. We would like to keep it at netstandard 1.1.. Yeah mean the other 10 right? I also got one of those. And I really hope someone will come and help me with making Magick.NET cross-platform.. I could use help with this issue: https://github.com/dlemstra/Magick.NET/issues/16. This is for creating a Linux compilation script that I can use to build the native library. Would love to get some help with that \ud83d\ude03 . I also prefer to use overloads instead of optional arguments. The current code base already uses a lot of optional arguments so that is why I used that. I can change it inside this pull request to use overloads instead of optional arguments. Your thought @JimBobSquarePants?. Just pushed the last change. I think we are ready to merge.. We should probably create a new issue/pull request to remove all the optional arguments.. You are not disposing the image instances that you create. And I would advise you to reduce your code to a smaller sample that demonstrates we are not cleaning up memory properly. Your code example is way to big for us now.. I am now wondering if we should add a configuration setting where the user can enable or disable array pooling. Some systems might need the memory returned after usage.. Not sure if I like this way of testing. We are now testing if private method calls are done correctly. I rather have a test that makes sure that the options are being used. We could probably do that by setting IgnoreMetadata to true/false and check the size of the resulting stream?. Much better now. You can probably move the code fromSaveInternalback toSave.. I rather have the copying of the metadata in the copy constructor. Don't really like the LoadFrom method because you can call it multiple times. But it makes no sense to me to have this option. Also leaving a minor comment about the argument order. My OCD says configuration should be first.. Go ahead and merge it.. If we are going to create an ArrayPoolProvider (sounds like a good idea) we should offer two implementations. One that reuses the pool (our default) and one that just creates a new one all the time. Otherwise we need null checks everywhere we use pools.. @antonfirsov In ImageMagick we swap to disk when we run out of memory. Maybe we could make the MemoryManager do that automatically?. Do you have some before/after benchmarks?. What is the position of your MemoryStream? I have the feeling it is not at the start?. This project is using the same code as my Magick.NET project and I tried to apply your fix there. But your unit test passes without any problems without the patch applied. You can see my fixed test in the referenced commit.. Maybe I was not being clear enough. When I only add the unit test to my project it passes but I would expect it to fail. I ran the test through the debugger and there are two values that are ExifDataType.Undefined. One has the value1forNumberOfComponentsand the other one has4as the value. This means it will pass the unit test if you check if the value is not0. This is before applying your fix inExifReader.cs.. I think you are correct and the behavior should be changed. I will pick this up next week.. Thanks for the detailed bug report. I'll take a look at this since it will probably also affect Magick.NET.. That is not the correct behavior, the other pixels should be preserved. And please don't delete the issue template next time. Now we don't know which version you have used. . I have to agree with @tocsoft and I also likeImage.Load()` better. Maybe we should have the following options available:\n\nImage<TPixel>.Load()\nImage.Load<TPixel>()\nImage.Load() = Image.Load<Rgba32>()\n\nI would also like the last one to be available because most people will probably only use the Rgba32 variant. I don't mind that it returns an Image<Rgba32> but I just don't want to tell it every time.. I do think we only need that for two overloads. The one with only a file name and the one with only a stream. And if you want more you should use one of the generic overloads.. That should be extra super awesome instead of just awesome. And thanks great leader!. I do think we need to check if this.Bytes.J - this.Bytes.I is smaller than the length in the else block: https://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/blob/master/src/ImageSharp/Formats/Jpeg/Components/Decoder/InputProcessor.cs#L166 and return DecoderErrorCode.UnexpectedEndOfStream if it is.. Something weird is happening, I did some poor man debugging:\nC#\nIccTagDataEntry[] items = inData.Where(t => inData[0].Equals(t)).ToArray();\nif (items.Length == 0)\n{\n    throw new System.NotImplementedException(string.Join(\"\\n\", inData.Select(t => t.Signature.ToString() + \"_\" + t.TagSignature.ToString())));\n}\nIf I do a break instead the test passes. Off to work now, I hope this will help you further. \n. I am guessing that there is a funky Equals overload in one of the entries here: https://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/tree/023cce36aee5d8bd26de17cf131afbb8f1bef3ba/src/ImageSharp/MetaData/Profiles/ICC/TagDataEntries. I also wonder about the implementation you chose. I would let public override bool Equals(IccTagDataEntry other) call public bool Equals(IccChromaticityTagDataEntry other) instead of the other way around.. I wonder if we should create a Format for this so you can both load and save raw pixel data. Image.Load(data, new RawDecoderOptions { Width = 30, Height = 30 }});. Thats not what I mean't. I mean raw (Data?) pixel data in bytes. And make it possible to both read and write it using an encoder and decoder. Instead of having a new Load overload for this.. Using an decoder/encoder for this would also make it possible to add some specific options in the future. That would make it possible to read only the data of the red channel as a double (in bytes). That might be a step to far at this point but it won't be that easy to remove your new load methods from the public API when we would want to do that.. @JimBobSquarePants Maybe we should introduce lazy pixel loading? And only decode the pixels when the are needed by an image operation or the encoder. This would also make it possible to just change the metadata of an image. The encoder would detect that the pixel data is still stored in the encoded format and would just write it to disc.. @vpenades Did you take a look a ImageMagick back then? This can handle extremely large images.\np.s. I am one of the authors.. I think we should add that extra chunk to the IPngEncoderOptions to write it to the file. And when it is read it should be added to the MetaData of the Image. Maybe use an extension method? I hope I have some time this week to finally work on the refactoring of the options.. @boban984 It might be wise to wait till made those changes :) The public API is very likely to change.. Just did a quick test to see if the image was actually corrupt. ImageMagick can read it without any issues and ImageMagick normally is very strict about errors inside an image. Means this is most likely an issue inside the decoder.. You will need to use the overload that has an IImageFormat as an out argument.. Thanks for this fix \ud83d\udc4d . I get the following error with ImageMagick:\nidentify: zTXt: CRC error 'versioning-1_1.png' @ warning/png.c/MagickPNGWarningHandler/1709.\nMaybe this will help someone solve the issue. It looks like the image chunk is not corrupt.. In ImageMagick we just report a warning when the CRC of the zTXt is incorrect. I just did a quick check of our decoder and we report corrupt Image Chunk for every chunk. I thought this was an exception for an invalid IDAT chunk. I wonder if we should only throw an exception when the CRC of a critical chunk is invalid? Maybe we could also include the name of the chunk in the exception?. We should not touch the transparent pixels. When the image is saved in a format that does not support transparency it is the user their responsibility to change the transparent pixels. If we change them to another color this might cause unwanted behavior. Calling image.Background(Rgba32.White) is not a work around but something that should/can be done by the user.. Next time please use gitter to ask questions. You can get that information from the exif profile in the metadata of the image.. And thanks for letting us know how you solved it.. What do you want in the byte array?. Your bitmap is compressed with RLE and we don't support that at the moment. That is why you got the NotSupportedException.. You should not Dispose the outputImageStream passed to the FileStreamResult object. That class becomes the owner and will release it themselves.. Could you add a small code sample so we can easily reproduce your issue?. Looks fine to me, cannot merge on my phone because the codecov is \"lower\". Thanks for fixing those typos \ud83d\udc4d . This is not correct. The value of ExifTag.PixelXDimension can either be a short or a long.\n@musukvl It might be better to remove the current exif tag and add a new exif tag that is either a short or a long depending on the value,. @JimBobSquarePants We should probably add support for that but not sure yet how to implement that. Might have time to look at that this weekend.. @TodesBrot Could you give me some instruction on how to compile and run an application that uses ImageSharp with Mono on Ubuntu 16.04.3? Would like to debug the problem but I am unable to get an application running.. @TodesBrot I don't have any Mono experience so forgive me for asking dumb questions. How do I get a simple application that only reads the image with ImageSharp running on Ubuntu? Can I just run the Windows executable with Mono?. I tried to run a simple executable on Mono that uses ImageSharp (netstandard 1.3 build) to read an image but I got the following error:\nCould not load signature of SixLabors.ImageSharp.Formats.Png.PngImageFormatDetector:DetectFormat due to: Could not load file or assembly 'System.Memory, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51' or one of its dependencies. assembly:System.Memory, Version= 4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51 type:<unknown type> member:<none>\nCould not load signature of SixLabors.ImageSharp.Formats.IImageFormatDetector:DetectFormat due to: Could not load file or assembly 'System.Memory, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51' or one of its dependencies. assembly:System.Memory, Version=4.0.0. 0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51 type:<unknown type> member:<none>.

The PR with the workaround has been merged.. This will happen when there is no data chunk in the file. I think this PR will fix the issue: #442. We can add a unit test once we can access those images.. Checking if Position == Length sounds like a good plan to aid developers. But we will need to check if we can use those properties. Not sure what we need to check for that though.. And it looks like you deleted the issue template. Could you please provide is with some instructions on how to reproduce this?. Looks like this is related to this issue: https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/14727. Seeing that exception in one of the comments.. You should remove the code in AfterImageApply from the ResizeProcessor instead. There is already some logic for this in the TransformProcessorBase class so the ResizeProcessor should not this.. Turns it is the [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)] on the Swap method. Details can be found here: https://github.com/mono/mono/issues/6777. Maybe just removing that attribute could solve our issue?. @JimBobSquarePants Can we merge in the grammatical errors? To make sure this doesn't get to big? Maybe a new PR and rebase this one?. If you need support for those formats at the moment you might want to take a look at my project: https://github.com/dlemstra/Magick.NET.. Why do we need to change the ExifValue API? Not sure what the benefit of making it immutable is.. @JimBobSquarePants I looks like this is issues is gone now we swapped the JPEG decoder.. I have to agree with @tocsoft. If we tell it to move frame 2 to index 4 it should got to index 4 and not index 3.. Thanks for helping out @coenm.. @antonfirsov You can probably do this with Magick.NET (Q16) by loading an image and getting the pixels of that image.. Want me to close this one?  And isn't #694 a different issue? Also feel free to add some tests to this PR.. I mean #695 where I said 694. Could we get this in a separate PR? \nThe problem here is that the position has been changed from an uint to an int to avoid casting when reading from the span. Will close this one. \np.s. Pinged you on twitter.. Did you attach the correct result files? Because ImageMagick thinks they are the same:\ncompare -metric rmse 45563771-5b96ba80-b81c-11e8-9946-c983bad52834.png 45563772-5b96ba80-b81c-11e8-80af-43989dae45a6.png null:\n0 (0). The problem seems to be that are reading an alpha channel but should ignore it because BMP3 (40 bytes header) should not support the alpha channel. \nI found this in the comments of the code of ImageMagick:\n\n/\n          We should ignore the alpha value in BMP3 files but there have been\n          reports about 32 bit files with alpha. We do a quick check to see if\n          the alpha channel contains a value that is not zero (default value).\n          If we find a non zero value we asume the program that wrote the file\n          wants to use the alpha channel.\n        /\n\nI think we have two options when solving this issue:\n\nWe add FromBgr32 to the pixel operations where we ignore the alpha channel but still read it.\nWe read the pixels with FromBgra32 and after we read each row we check if we found an alpha pixel that is not zero. And after all the rows have been read we check if we found a non zero value. When this is not the case we change all the alpha pixels to opaque.\n\nI would opt for option two but that could give use a performance degradation. Maybe we should let the user decide between option 1 and 2 and make 1 the default?. This image is V3. Will implement option 2 then and submit a PR.. Not sure what Mozilla is doing. Option two is what ImageMagick does.. I think we should be able to add support for this. And the file coders/bmp.c could give some insight on how this is done in ImageMagick.. What happens when you use Mutate instead of Clone?. Looks like 2.1 returns an empty string instead.. Have you tried any of the workarounds mentioned here: https://support.frozenmountain.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000767214-Known-Issue-with-Xamarin-iOS-10-10.. Thanks for the fixes \ud83d\udc4d . @Metalnem It looks like your message is automated/auto generated. Would it be possible to also include a stack trace?. Could you remove the numbering?. I can take a look at this when I am back home in two weeks. Might be possible we made some changes in ImageMagick since this was added to ImageSharp.. There is a difference in the code. The sum does not check if the quantum tables are null. But that does not seem to be the case here.. I am now busy merging and doing some minor refactoring. The FlagsHelper is gone and only the GetSortedValues is still used but I wonder if we really need it.. All is used in the PixelAccessorTests but we really don't want to use it here :). The intention is that the developer should get a notification when they call the method with an invalid x and y offset. Calling this method with an x or y offset that does nothing is also considered invalid.  The caller should add a check for this instead of doing a non-copy inside this class.. Some of these are all ones of mine :) But thanks for reviewing them.. Are you sure this change is correct? Maybe @JimBobSquarePants can comment if the AlmostEquals was intended behavior?. I also like it better to have a build.cmd file that builds the projects No need to edit appveyor.yml and easier to test locally.. Not sure if we need this kind of fancy version number stuff. The build should probably only just add a build number to the current version.. My OCD says we need a capital letter here \ud83d\ude1b . Do we need this xproj file? It will be deprecated in a couple months.. We should probably have a look at the tags for each project, we could do that later though. Same goes for the description.. I also think we need to check if we still need all these dependencies. Maybe some of the projects no longer require all the dependencies?. I wonder if we should leave these two in the primary package and maybe even make them public? I wrote these myself and that are really tiny so maybe we should refactor them out or add these methods to the public interface. Your thoughts @JimBobSquarePants ?. After seeing so many pieces of shared (duplicated) code and the comment from @antonfirsov and now making something public that should not be public I do think we should use InternalsVisibleTo for the Helpers and keep them all together inside the ImageSharp project. Wonder what @JimBobSquarePants thinks.. Happy that you did not split up the test project. Maybe others feel different but I think we should keep all the tests in one project.. Shouldn't we rename this to Drawing.Processing?. I think it is cleaner to use the AddImageFormat method instead of duplicating the checks.. I have to agree with @antonfirsov on this, cleaner to have a method for this.. They are public so that's why I did not remove them. I did not use auto properties with HorizontalResolution  because I want to protect them from being set to a value lower or equal to zero. I am okay with removing the constants and setting it in the constructor. Can I go ahead and change this?. Yeah, code talks better than twitter \ud83d\ude04.. Personally not a big fan of throwing exceptions inside properties. Rather ignore invalid values. What do you prefer @JimBobSquarePants?. As you have noticed I have a different way of writing the tests. I use Arrange, Act, Assert, Act, Assert ... a lot of times. But I do think we need some common way of how we set up tests. We have a lot of different styles now. I think we need some help from our Grand High Eternal Dictator @JimBobSquarePants . To me it felt like the logic should be inside the ImageMetaData class.. Okay i'll move it to the ExifProfile.. We might want to wait a while before we take the RTM version? Been working with it all day on Friday and it was not very friendly. Had a couple of unexpected crashes.. Maybe !NETSTANDARD1_1 ?. It looks like a mistake that I forgot to use the quantizer from the options. Thanks @antonfirsov! I could not set it inside the options due to the {TColor} restriction.. Yeah I could and should have done that.. This will happen when you call the constructor of Image without options (options=null). The GifDecoder will just forward the value.. I can take a look at what we do inside ImageMagick but I think we always use dithering.. I updated the comments.. Fixed and removed the remarks from the interface.. Should this not be an enum?. This guard feels wrong? You are guarding that isWrongSize is true?. Should this not be curveEntries.Length > 0?. You could to Encoding.GetEncoding(\"ASCII\") instead: https://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/blob/a82d28f563279c433d9474981774c1745f8d25ca/src/ImageSharp/Formats/Png/PngDecoderOptions.cs#L15. Why do you want to do this?. Maybe you could do this lazy and only read them when the property is requested?. Also the wrong way around? data.Length >= 128 Maybe use MustBeGreaterThanOrEqualTo? You probably want to check all the Guard.IsTrue checks? There are more incorrect ones.. See my other comment. This logic seems to be gone because the DisposalMethod has been moved to IMetaData. Maybe you should make the DisposalMethod nullable so you can check if you can copy the value from the original. But I do wonder if this logic makes any sense though. We can probably just have DisposalMethod.Unspecified as the default.. Not sure why you want to use inheritdoc here but don't do it for the other fields. Think it's better to just put the comments here. Never seen inheritdoc do anything in the code completion.. Do we really need this?. You probably want to remove the second check from this if? You moved it inside already.. I know this is correct but the statement looks confusing when you look at it the first time. Maybe you should call it hasFrames instead? . I would rather have this implemented explicitly to make it more clear users should use the IImageFormatProvider implementation. That means not just this method but the whole IImageFormatHost interface.. Not sure why we would need this at this moment. I thinks its better to remove it at this moment.. Shouldn't we call this FileExtensionToMimeTypeMapping.. Shouldn't this be FindFileExtensionEncoder(string extension)? We are only asking this for a single extension.. Do we need the internal set for this internal class?. I think we can move the BmpConstants.MimeTypes and BmpConstants.FileExtensions to this class? The constants are now only used by the providers. This comment is meant for all the IImageFormatProviders. Maybe we should move this to the Constants class? We use the same encoding for both the png and gif encoder/decoder. Constants.DefaultTextEncoding?. I don't think we should put the TextEncoding in the constructor and set the rest of the options as properties. Setting all of them as properties is probably the way to go.. Should be include this change in this pull request? Maybe better to create a new issue for this to resolve the TODO you mentioned?. Why did you remove this?. We should move this interface to a separate file.. I wonder if we should have this method as an internal method on the Configuration class? Maybe also DiscoverDecoder?. Fair point. Better keep it public then.. It is possible that we add the ExifTag.PixelYDimension value. And I wonder if we should do this operation. Otherwise we need to this in a lot of spots. I personally think we shouldn't do this.. Doesn't this mean that you would also need to add something to the resize processor? Maybe we could do this logic inside Sync method of the ExifProfile if you really think we need this?. I wonder if you need the Vector2 here. Why is that better than float sizeX = maxX -minX?. I wonder if this will be correct for auto rotated images. This had this.Expand set to false which would mean that we would not update the values. But I do think we could update the values though. Not sure why we didn't?. You are now reusing the sampler across threads. Good change \ud83d\udc4d . Do we need those commented out lines?. Looks like you are missing an a here.. \ud83d\udc4d . UpdateDimensionalMetData\nUpdateDimensionalMetaData\n\ud83d\ude1b . I don't think we should make this the default. We should not seek within the stream unless the user instructs us to do so.. Shouldn't this be config.ReadOrigin != ReadOrigin.Current or config.ReadOrigin == ReadOrigin.Begin?. I personally think this is a bad decision but you are the \"Grand High Eternal Dictator\" so you have the final say. I do think we need an option for this and it is a great idea to add this but this should not be the default.. Maybe I don't understand what this method should do but shouldn't it copy the data from the stream to a memory stream to make it seekable? The ReadOrigin is an option for the input stream or also for the stream that we create?. This list should not be mutable.. Small typo, no biggie.... You should also check if this.data starts with the exif id and skip the first 6 bytes when includeExifIdCode is false.. You could also increment i when you set the values so you don't need the duplicate code block in the else part.. Should we rename the struct because it no longer is a short/ Int16?. Can you please cleanup these redundant comments? The method below the comment is self explanatory.. I wonder if this logic should be handled inside the ExifProfile class. It feels like this should be handled inside the decoder itself.. Feels a bit odd that we need to pass in the extra data. Can this not be handled inside the encoder/decoder?. Do we really need this comment?. Can you remove this comment instead? Not every JPEG file has an IccProfile.. Looks like other PR's also have build issues?. Maybe we also need to test that we don't allow adding duplicates?. \ud83d\udc83 . Should you not move the i outside the for loop and use it here?. Do we also need checks for values like 3,5,7? But do we really need this check, we cannot enter this method with a higher value?. I wonder if it would not be more efficient to just increment by 1 instead?. Better to do the -1 here \ud83d\udc4d . We probably should. Could we do this in a separate PR please?. Could we use latest here instead?. Good catch. Wondering if we really need this as a property instead of just using Encoding.ASCII where we need it. Or maybe rename the field?. Do we need the duplication?. Do we no longer need the count check?. Should this still be commented?. Should this still be commented?. Okay \ud83d\udc4d Just wanted to make sure that you not missed this.. Small typo here. Thanks for adding these images.. Are you fixing a bug here or creating one? sqrtPow != MathF.Sqrt(y / yn) and pow != y / yn.. Maybe you could reverse the order to make it more clear that you are adding cmd[0] to count?. Maybe you could also 'calculate' Size-1 once?. Good catch \ud83d\udc4d . Maybe you could just increment i3 instead of doing the multiplication? You then also don't need the i3+6/7/8?. I think I prefer the old method. What are you fixing here?. That is a good catch. And thanks for clearing it up. Missed that you optimized the division away.. Thanks for the explanation.. It is indeed a tiny optimization. Maybe put the division in a variable inside to make it more clear that this is the aspect ration? You can also move percentHeight and percentWidth. These are only used at one spot.. I really prefer using Guard instead of the null-coalescing operator.. CurveType.GetHashCode()?. this.ColorantType.GetHashCode()?. Why are we not using HashHelpers.Combine here?. this.InputChannelCount.GetHashCode()?. this.Illuminant.GetHashCode()?\nThis is happening in other places also, now starting to wonder if you should not use GetHashCode for an int?. Maybe use offsetRow instead and reorder the arguments to gave a more clear signature?. Using minRow and offsetColumn just looked a bit confusing. Could you not use min or offset for both?. ",
    "olivif": "I see usage of Vector4 in a bunch of places now, are there any remaining areas which we need to convert? \ud83d\ude04 . @JimBobSquarePants I'd like to help out on perf investigations, any pointers on where I can start/what to focus on? Should we start with some documentation on bechmarking in ImageSharp and an overview of the areas and if anyone is actively looking into them? \ud83d\ude04 \nBtw, I ran benchmark.cmd on a few of the profiles, but it's a bit difficult to go from there.\nAlso, I searched a bit on benchmarking with xUnit, found NBench and xUnit Perf, not sure if anyone has already looked into these.. Ahh I think I see now. Benchmarking will give you the overall numbers and help you compare against a baseline (be it a different lib or an earlier version of your lib), whereas the profiler will actually tell you what is slow (or provide enough info on all the parts so you can hunt yourself). \nHmm I'm surprised the VS profiler didn't work with a core project, maybe the tooling for core is not all fully out there. . I did a little bit of digging through the code on this, and had some thoughts and questions. \nSo, if I understand correctly, we want to have an options class - for encoders let's say for now - so EncoderOptions. \nThese options would be used in all IImageEncoders in Encode, possibly like this \npublic void Encode<TColor, TPacked>(Image<TColor, TPacked> image, Stream stream, IEncoderOptions encoderOptions)\nThere seems to be some overlap in the options between encoders but encoders also have options that are specific to them, and therefore doesn't make sense to have in the generic EncoderOptions - for example the BmpEncoderCore uses BmpBitsPerPixel. \nOne idea to solve this is to have a generic IEncoderOptions which has all the common options - if any, and then have derived options for any other format specific ones. \nI tried this out in a branch for BmpEncoder - it works, but I think it sucks a little bit because of the casting to the concrete type in BmpEncoder. Also, it would be good if the core encoders could actually be IImageEncoders and share an interface - which using this they could do if the IEncoderOptions is added to the Encode interface, but then the cast would have to move inside the Core object. Which maybe is OK. \nThoughts?. > The encoder method has two overloads. One with IEncoderOptions and one with IBmpEncoderOptions. \nWill the IBmpEncoderOptionsoverload be in the IEncoderinterface? If it is, then it would be a bit odd to have format specific stuff in there. If it's not, it would also be kind of odd since you wouldn't be enforcing the specific encoding method on let's say a new type of encoder. \n\nThen someone could create a single object that implements the various encoder options. \n\nHmm this got me thinking as well. We are trying to solve this using an approach that involves passing in the options at \"encoding time\", so when calling encode. Here's another idea, what if we push the options initialization into the constructor? Right now even with this Encode approach it's half in ctor half in the method, since you have some defaults anyway. So, we push the responsibility of initializing the encoder with the correct configuration in the ctor. Whoever knows the concrete type will know they need to pass in a Bmp specific options and that seems a little less weird. The only challenge with this is that you need to create an encoder per encode operation, if you want different options. Not sure if that works with the other parts of the stack, haven't dug much into the upper layers.. Yep, that sounds great to me! Clean interface and specific implementation options hidden in the implementation. Perfection \u2764\ufe0f . @antonfirsov have you noticed any impact on the duration of the test suite after this change? I saw some reflection so I'm wondering if that is slowing it down at all \ud83d\ude04 . Haha loved the giga pixels comment! I agree, I think caching the already loaded images is a great start. Don't really want to highjack your PR though so feel free to make that change in another PR or write up a comment on one of the issues with some details so someone else can pick it up :smile:\nAlso, on the main focus of the PR, I think it's great! This will give us the ability to have more tests with less duplication.. thanks @dlemstra. fixed the uppercase issue now. I also looked into if this can be a stylecop rule, so we can automate it, unfortunately couldn't find anything \ud83d\ude1e . @dlemstra awesome!. Thanks for merging! Yes, I have some more ideas on how to improve it, just wanted to start with a small-ish PR to kick things off :smile:. I see \ud83d\ude04 I had a quick look now through the tests in the slow bucket, I see most of them are reading all test files from disk. I know MSTest has an AssemblyInitializeAttribute  where we could read up the files once per test suite. Not sure if xUnit has it, but that could go a long way despite the decoders/encoders being slow. \ncc @antonfirsov since I see he has a PR out for refactoring some of the testing #42 \n. @antonfirsov I think you're right on the money there, the slow tests we have are mostly end to end tests actually. I also think you touched upon a great point there, we cannot win against an k * n * m space. \nI remembered reading about this exact problem on the google testing blog - Just say no to more end to end tests. What they recommend is implementing the following test pyramid pattern:\n 10% end-to-end tests\n 20% integration tests\n* 70% unit tests\n\nSounds a bit counter intuitive but testing all possible combinations of the product - end to end - is a losing battle. We could also go down the route of only enabling some tests in some configurations, but then we will run into the test lab/flakiness problems. \n\nWith the current developer capacity, is it possible to increase the set of \"true\" unit tests, in order reduce the other (functional/manual/visual) set? (I think this is practically impossible now :( )\n\nI think this would provide immense value to the team, imagine how much fast we can iterate and focus on the product. For instance, while I was making the stylecop changes I had 3 commits, for every commit I had run the tests about 2 times, plus once before submitting the PR. Test run is 4 mins, so that was 28 mins in total. . I did a little test today to see how much coverage the slow tests are giving us, good news is it's not that much actually. Or at least not as much as I expected \ud83d\ude04 \nCoverage with all tests - slow, medium, fast - 63%\n\nCoverage with fast tests - medium, fast  - 42%\n\nThe biggest gap I saw was on Processors and Quantizers.. wow, thanks @tocsoft, that was an awesome tip. They run in a minute in release mode. . thanks @JimBobSquarePants! \ud83d\ude04 makes sense! will see what I can do.. thanks @dlemstra, just rebased and fixed all the remaining warnings. 0 warnings \ud83c\udf88 \nlooks like I broke some tests though, having a look at that now. Doesnt the appveyor build catch broken tests? \ud83d\ude15 . OK I found the bug and fixed it, it was super interesting actually. \nHere's what I did, I changed the Bytes Bytes field in the JpegDecoderCore from an internal field to a private backing field with a get only property. However, because Bytes is a mutable struct, this line would no longer work as intended, since we were changing the Bytes struct on a copy really. \nbyte c = decoder.Bytes.ReadByteStuffedByte(decoder.InputStream, out errorCode);\nSo the fix was to make sure we reflect the changes property on the internal bytes. \n// Grab the decode bytes, use them and then set them\n// back on the decoder.\nvar decoderBytes = decoder.Bytes;\nbyte c = decoderBytes.ReadByteStuffedByte(decoder.InputStream, out errorCode);\ndecoder.Bytes = decoderBytes;. @dlemstra awesome!. Thanks for merging guys. Indeed, it was so rewarding to see zero warnings :smile:\nWe can consider enabling warnings as errors so we can't accidentally introduce some more before it gets out of control. Maybe if we can only do it on appveyor builds? It's a bit excessive and annoying to not be able to build locally because of stylecop.. Hmm that's odd. Let me have a look at the build logs, see if I can spot anything \ud83d\ude04 Nothing should add that much really, I can also trigger a couple more builds on this branch to see if it was a one off.. Ah OK I think I found something. On this particular build seems like we had trouble connecting to codecov the first time, so we retried. The retry seems to have a back off mechanism behind it so the time between retries kept expanding. \n==> Uploading\n    .url https://codecov.io\n    .query job=JamesSouth%2Fimagesharp%2Fv1.0.0-alpha-000176&branch=master&slug=JimBobSquarePants%2FImageSharp&build=yh5eb877jbyk8fna&service=appveyor&pr=50&commit=cf1dd55e6f729ff1fc22e4378addcfcd0456169a&package=py2.0.5\n    Pinging Codecov...\n    Retrying... in 30s\n    Pinging Codecov...\n    Retrying... in 60s\n    Pinging Codecov...\n    Retrying... in 90s\nwhereas on another build off of master I compared with \n==> Uploading\n    .url https://codecov.io\n    .query package=py2.0.5&commit=d2669d09724ca82bd48b3763ca772343aa8baee1&slug=JimBobSquarePants%2FImageSharp&service=appveyor&job=JamesSouth%2Fimagesharp%2Fv1.0.0-alpha-000177&branch=master&build=np3weco8y2r48j5p\n    Pinging Codecov...\n    Uploading to S3...\nI think it was intermittent but I would love to re-trigger the build on the PR a few times to make sure. \nDo you know if I can retrigger a build without a new commit? \ud83d\ude04 .

No worries @JimBobSquarePants, it was fun \ud83d\ude04 \nYes, I look forward to seeing how the comparer stuff can work, I struggled a bit to find a nice way of doing it for all objects, not used to xUnit so I'm still trying to get used to the Theory mindset and generic datasets.  . > Yes, and I've been giving it some thought. The contributions that you, @tocsoft and @olivif have provided so far have been extraordinary and the library simply wouldn't be anywhere as good as it is just now without your efforts. So... I'm extending an invite to the three of you. If you would like and you think you can provide the commitment over time I can officially add you all to the team.\nThis was the first thing I read as I woke up, I have to say that's a pretty nice way to start the day \ud83c\udf70. I'd love to join, I've had a really great time contributing to this project and I'm super excited about what we can do with it. \n\nWe'll still use PR's for larger changes but smaller incremental changes could be made much more easily.\n\nActually was thinking a bit about this. Do you think it would make sense to create PRs for everything? Even if you merge them yourself 2 seconds later, it gives me and the others the ability to go back to closed PRs and see what was added, maybe with a nice description next to it. And I can ask a question or two, it would be a great learning tool for the new people or anyone wanting to contribute really. And you also get the post code-review benefits. What do you think? \ud83d\ude04 \n\nI have to get used to that StyleCop guy however, we are definitely not friends yet\n\nTakes a bit of time but now it's just second nature to me, so give it a while. I can definitely see what @JimBobSquarePants is saying, I've worked on some really large projects, and it is pretty nice to browse the code and know where things are and have them be structured, named, documented in the same way.  . All fixed, this is ready to be merged if there's nothing else \ud83d\ude04 I don't know why codecov is shouting at me, the coverage should be the same ... thanks @tocsoft !. Moving comment here since it's hidden up there. \n@JimBobSquarePants \n\nI've a feeling I have a few different values for Epsilon littered throughout the codebase. They should probably all be the same.\n\nYeah, they are everywhere. These are the instances I could find. Are we OK with changing all of them to 0.001f ? I also need to look in the tests see if this will break something and potentially refactor there to use a test epsilon or the same one.\nFind all \"Epsilon =\", Subfolders, Find Results 1, Entire Solution, \"\"\n Colors\\Spaces\\CieLab.cs(26):        private const float Epsilon = 0.001f;\n Colors\\Spaces\\CieXyz.cs(26):        private const float Epsilon = 0.001f;\n Colors\\Spaces\\Cmyk.cs(25):        private const float Epsilon = 0.001f;\n Colors\\Spaces\\Hsl.cs(25):        private const float Epsilon = 0.001F;\n Colors\\Spaces\\Hsv.cs(25):        private const float Epsilon = 0.001F;\n Colors\\ColorspaceTransforms.cs(25):        private const float Epsilon = 0.001F;\n Colors\\Vector4BlendTransforms.cs(20):        private const float Epsilon = 0.0001F;\n Common\\Helpers\\ImageMaths.cs(94):            const float Epsilon = .00001F;\n Common\\Helpers\\ImageMaths.cs(169):            const float Epsilon = .00001f;\n Common\\Helpers\\ImageMaths.cs(281):            const float Epsilon = .00001F;\n Drawing\\Processors\\DrawPathProcessor.cs(30):        private const float Epsilon = 0.001f;\n Drawing\\Processors\\FillShapeProcessor.cs(24):        private const float Epsilon = 0.001f;\n Filters\\Processors\\Effects\\BackgroundColorProcessor.cs(22):        private const float Epsilon = 0.001f;\n Filters\\Processors\\Transforms\\RotateProcessor.cs(73):            const float Epsilon = .0001F;\n Filters\\Processors\\Transforms\\RotateProcessor.cs(94):            const float Epsilon = .0001F;\n Numerics\\LongRational.cs(93):            double epsilon = bestPrecision ? double.Epsilon : .000001;\n Quantizers\\Wu\\WuQuantizer.cs(39):        private const float Epsilon = 1e-5F;. @JimBobSquarePants I was thinking about that actually. Who actually uses equality for color spaces? Is it only for test? . @antonfirsov yes, that is true. Equals should use 0 precision right? Or rather, this return this.backingVector.Equals(other.backingVector);. @antonfirsov I will do this, but in another PR as this one is already getting quite big.  . Now it's ready to be merged, unless anyone has any other thoughts \ud83d\ude04 I removed the Common namespace as @dlemstra suggested. Using my super powers to merge now \ud83d\udcaa . How about Processing instead of Processors? Seems a bit more customer friendly to me :smile: and then inside we will have effects and transforms, each with their own namespace?\nI had a similar thought with Text being its own thing, but based on the dependencies argument I now agree.\nAlso I am in favour of keeping the library as a whole with one version number. I see no reason to break it down. Let's say the processing DLL doesn't change but there are changes in the core which the processing depends on. Deosnt that count as a new version anyway, since the behaviour has changed? :Smile:\nGreat effort @tocsoft, I think this is definitely the right thing to do!. Yes, I considered moving them out but I had the same thought as @tocsoft, they are very specific to the class. . thanks for merging guys! you are right on the allocations @antonfirsov, forgot Vector3/4 are structs \ud83d\ude04  . Great fix, pretty interesting bug on xUnit. Thanks Andy!. why not using var? \ud83d\ude04 The rule I use these days is: use var by default, unless the type cannot be easily inferred from reading the code. It makes the code more maintainable - for instance if I change from an IEnumerable to IList, etc, I don't need to update all the places, it kinda just works. . @JimBobSquarePants this is super interesting, I've actually never run into these type problems due to var, thanks for sharing \ud83d\ude04 . I understand the perils now, up until now it was just the maintainability argument for me, but now I see how it could go wrong. \n\nI honestly believe that it's having a negative effect on modern programming. Devs aren't learning their types nor the framework properly as a result and are being careless, using var mostly because they don't know what the return type of a method should be.\n\nI fully agree here. I was fortunate enough to write a lot of C++ before coming to C# but I realize that might not be the norm these days. . Haha! Well, it was great at the time and definitely learnt a lot. Would I go back to unmanaged without a really good reason? Probably not \ud83d\ude04 . Could use Path.Combine here to avoid all the / concatenation \ud83d\ude04 . Maybe we never use All? . Not sure I understand why this is needed. If we had the strong enum type we could just do enum.ToString no? \ud83d\ude04 . Any existing tests which we should convert to this model for consistency? Maybe make a note or create an issue or something so we don't lose track of it \ud83d\ude04 . I see there is some more parsing below but didn't dig too much. Maybe you can briefly explain how it works? \u2699\ufe0f . Why not make them instance methods? Sounds a lot nicer, since that is the intention. Static is also generally harder to test. . While we're on cleanup, I don't think these refs are needed here. It will be passed by reference not value anyway, the only time you'd want to use ref is if you want to re-assign the object and thus change the reference.  . Ohh it is a struct, did not see that coming! That makes sense, don't mind me then :smile:. That's my rule as well. If anyone else has a need for it then it can move into a common place.. Actually I haven't hit that rule at all. It should trigger on parameter docs, class docs. Maybe they've changed the spec for it. Ahhh, it's been disabled, see here.  . I completely agree, I was just following the pattern the other color spaces use. I can fix all of them while I'm at it, I thought maybe there was a reason for it \ud83d\ude04 . I've made the changes locally, I'll wait for an ack from @JimBobSquarePants before pushing \ud83d\ude04 . Ahh I see. Well, since the backing vector doesn't change, we can actually make it readonly no?\nYup, tried it out locally, no complaints when I change the backing vector to be readonly. It's only assigned in the ctor \ud83d\ude04 . Agreed and fixed \ud83d\ude04 . good catch! Fixed this one, also made a note to fix it in other places \ud83d\ude04 . You can make it a property, I think that's what it wants :). ",
    "antonfirsov": "Subsampling is not an issue, the only test input where it goes over 1% is the cmyk watch:\n\n. Hi, I \"ported\" your projects to .NET 4.6 & managed to play with DotPeek.\nI think the main issue is having classes where using structs would be a much better choice. The code needs a LOT of systematic refactor. I would be happy to contribute, but I also want to avoid duplicate work. Any advices? (What to touch/not touch?)\n. Yes, its the jpeg :)\nI will start with a few small changes this week to proof my ideas first.\n. Lost some of my initial optimism. Only managed to gain ~10% speed growth by reducing allocations + array flattening in the jpeg decoder. Even with ArrayPool-s!\nThe main bottlenecks are the IDCT.Transform() and JpegDecoderCore.DecodeHuffman() functions.\nAfter analyzing the libjpeg code, I have the following conclusions:\n1. Transform could be replaced by a faster floating point implementation:\nhttps://dev.w3.org/Amaya/libjpeg/jidctflt.c\n2. It might be not enough, libjpeg DCT logic is much more complex\nI can play a bit more this weekend, but if you want to go 100% managed, someone has to become a jpeg expert sooner or later.\n. I tried the FluxJpeg implementation ... actually it's slower. Maybe we need a floating point IDCT with System.Numerics.\n. This library contains a libjpeg port in C#:\nhttps://imagetools.codeplex.com/\nShouldn't we adapt this instead of the golang port?\n. Just sent a PR, but conflicted :( I'm not sure if it's worth to merge in it's current form.\nCurrently I'm experimenting with SIMD IDCT implementations.

My workaround was to define a temporal 4.6 project, and reference ImageSharp as a dll (bin\\Release\\net45\\ImageSharp.dll).\nIf the infrastructure is ready, it's really easy to profile .NET 4.6 code with dotTrace or with VS profiler. Finding and eliminating bottlenecks is an exciting game, think of a detective movie! :). @chrisvandijk @JimBobSquarepants One big \"advantage\" of these naive C ports is that its really not that hard to make the first steps towards speeding & cleaning them up. \nSomeone with time & a profiler could check it, and estimate the efforts needed reuse/refactor elements of that code. . @gdoron It seems we managed to fix this. \n\nYeah, we are getting many images like that lately... \n\nI would be very happy if you could provide some feedback about the situation with your inputs based on our latest build! :smile:.

Unfortunately there is insufficient information in the projects DotSettings file, so ReSharper is applying my own defaults. It would be nice to have a project-specific DotSettings file with all the rules. Or as a quick solution: can you send me your own DotSettings? ... or does StyleCop provide any auto-refactoring tools? (it's a new thing for me)\nOr any other suggessions? Did I overlook something? :). Hi!\nI'm planning to finish the PR & answer your questions this weekend. / It's still friday in Budapest :) /.

Hi!\nI had a quick look at the implementation. Unfortunately there are a few points that will definitely effect the performance:\nbool[,]\nMultidimensional arrays are slow I suggest to flatten them into a 1-dimensional array.\nIEnumerable<T> and Linq with value types\nEven frequent & redundant .ToArray() calls are better, than using IEnumerable<T> and Linq with \"stream-like\" data. I suggest using simple arrays where possible, even if you break the encapsulation rules a little bit on API-s like ILineSegment.AsSimpleLinearPath() . Later we can use Span\nList<T>\nWhen the length of the result is known, or for members like BezierLineSegment.linePoints it's better to use arrays! (And if AsSimpleLinearPath()  returns an array, you can return the array directly without torturing the GC with Enumerator instance creation.). @tocsoft it's ok, if we can suppose that the brushes are cached most of the time and not createted on the fly.\nHowever, all of your patterns seem to be 4x4 in size. Isn't it possible to cache the FG/BG/Etc colors into a ~~Matrix4x4~~ ColorBuffer4x4 structure and batch the OnApply() -> IBrushApplicator.GetColor() -> IBrush.GetColor() calls to work on multiple pixels per call?\nThe difference in execution time will be HUGE.\nOr is this an optimization for another time? @JimBobSquarePants what do you think?. I'm skeptical about the memory part. Jagged arrays do RowCount+1 allocations. Are you sure there are no other differences?\nIt's also very hard to pool jagged arrays.. @JimBobSquarePants I will create a gist tonight (morning in Sydney). @tocsoft @JimBobSquarePants I have some really crazy optimization ideas coming into my mind, can't wait to share that gist :)\nI also think, that for now this PR is very good as is, optimization can be added later.. Ok guys, I will blow your mind another time, today I'd be happy enough if I could just finish my own PR & go to bed :D. @olivif @JimBobSquarePants I can improve TestImageFactory to cache already loaded / created images, so in the end the total execution time of the current unit tests can be decreased.\nI think the effect of reflection is negligible in a forest of gigapixels :). I'm closing this in favor of #57!. @olivif @JimBobSquarePants the most significant (and kind-of desired) outcome of my PR could be an increased amount of unit tests, which well .. makes the execution time even more longer. The standard approach to unit tests is \"Make them more, run them all!\". I think the the main issue is, that most of the test cases in the library are not actual unit tests.\nBy my opinion, discouraging testing, and not increasing (or decreasing) the current coverage would be a very bad solution. If the pixel type Rgba1010102 and the Jpeg codec are both supposed to be working & supported library features, we need to prove with automatic tests, that the Jpeg codec works for Rgba1010102 with different codec configurations. I think we need more tests, but maybe we don't want to run all of them in all scenarios. We need to ask questions like:\n\nHow should we mange the growing {pixel types} X {input images} X {features} test space, while keeping the whole set under coverage? We can try optimizations and caching, but we can't win against a K*N*M  ~~*Width*Height~~ -sized space.\nIf it's technically possible to disable/enable tests by specific testing configurations (it is!), shouldn't we reorganize the tests & categorize them by different testing scenarios?\nWhat tests are actual unit tests (operating on small amount of data, running quickly, having assertions)? \nWhat tests are intended to be verified visually?\nWhat tests should be executed by CI, can we ignore some of them on AppVeyor?\nDo developers working on specific features need to run all the tests when they apply modifications?\nWith the current developer capacity, is it possible to increase the set of \"true\" unit tests, in order reduce the other (functional/manual/visual) set? (I think this is practically impossible now :( )\n. @merijndejonge as a start, I suggest to check out the related piece of docs. (Note: IPackedPixel has been replaced with IPixel<TSelf>.)\n\nAfter checking it out, feel free to ask further questions on our gitter channel, you will get answers much faster there.. @JimBobSquarePants:\nTo have a proper before/after comparsion I have to reproduce EncodeJpegMutliple with the code on your master branch. I will take the time for this around 11PM CET, but there will be no big differences compared to my inital benchmarks (posted on gitter):\nBefore:\nhttps://github.com/antonfirsov/ImageSharp/blob/e936fb4643516b09c489914ebad8cdf6151866b0/JpegEncoderResults01.md\nAfter:\nhttps://github.com/antonfirsov/ImageSharp/blob/e936fb4643516b09c489914ebad8cdf6151866b0/JpegEncoderResults03.md\nSorry for the large amount_of_changes/PR ratio, but I got addicted to this project. There is actually even more stuff waiting to be pushed to your review queue :D I'm already working on a decoder code cleanup, which might enable more optimizations.\nLarger images:\nIt seems to me that Scaled entry \"scales\" with the number of my cores. To prove this, I have to reproduce the benchmarks with only 1 core assigned to the process. I will be very happy if this is the case, because I see a possibility to parallelize the CPU-intensive work (DCT, color conversion, zigzagging etc.). However it's not trivial, if I want to avoid false sharing.. > I'll tell you what though, that C# is starting to look less and less so...\nUnfortunately C#-s nice abstractions are not zero cost and you must drop some of them, or do strange tricks with them if you need data driven code taking care of cache coherence. With Jpeg I went so far, that I ended up writing C code in C#. I'm not happy with this. \nThe only thing that could help us here is to early-adapt Span<T>. It's already moved to the corefx repo from corefxlabs, and the API seems to be pretty stable. We can include it as git submodule. I think we need to introduce it in ImageSharp before it gets too late!\n\nWe'll definitely have to try to make future changes more incremental though I think, or at least write as many comments per code as we can. Some of the changes are really quite difficult to follow.\n\nI was waiting for #57 being accepted before opening this PR & I will open my next one (with lot's of changes again) as soon as this one will be closed.\nI see a pretty high chance this project could become my main focus of everyday-geekness-outside-work in the next few months. I'm full of perf improvement ideas, but I can also contribute to features+bugfixes if you find that more important.  I'll be very happy if we could find a way to speed-up merging my work. If you need more docs & comments from my side, I'm happy with it. However functions with lacking comments often belong to the original Jpeg codebase where I fail to understand all the details.. Cool!\nI have to get used to that StyleCop guy however, we are definitely not friends yet :D It's tried & tested mostly with projects having a different focus & it makes things extra difficult & non-straightforward with the C-ish struct-ful code we have to develop for perf critical parts. \nBut I'd :heart:  to be taken by :oncoming_police_car:  &  baton beaten if this is the price for contributing to a great library! :D. I wonder: is it possible that some day AlmostEquals() and it's friends will need to take a variable epsilon from outside?. Having such things like AlmostEqual is quite usual in graphical applications, becasue of numerical instability!\nExample use case: in the assertion part of the test cases you can load a pre-defined reference image and compare it with an epsilon to the actual one, because you really can't expect exact equality with floating point algorithms!. But it must not be mixed with standard Equals!\nThis code is wrong\nIt can happen that v1.GethHashCode() != v2.GetHashCode() while v1.Equals(v2) == true !. Better & faster if it's a completely separate thing.. Just delegate it to backingVector.Equals(other.backingVector). @JimBobSquarePants \n\nWhat's the biggest cause of the allocations? \n\nImageBase<T>.pixelBuffer not beiing pooled. Nothing, but Image : IDisposable can save us. :disappointed:. @JimBobSquarePants @olivif The explanation for the public field stuff:\nhttps://gist.github.com/antonfirsov/ea30e8c68bca20308a97c469929d51bf\nHere is my rule!\nPreconditions:\n- Having a mutable S struct (perf critical code)\n- Having a struct as member in an other type B\n- The struct member must be manipulated by a 3rd type C\nImplication:\n- The struct must not be exposed through a property, need a public member instead!\nThe only clean & safe alternative to this rule is to not have mutable structs :P \nC#7 ref returns can can help on this.. I did benchmarking with dotTrace memory profiler a few weeks ago, everything was pointing towards ImageBase.pixelBuffer.\n\nI'm assuming it is due to the benchmark running on multiple images?\n\nlarge images + multiple images = real life scenario. All the other benchmarks are liers! :D\nLarge images also bring in the LOH fragmentation issue :cry: . But it's our internal code! We are hardcore crazy people, we can manage it! :laughing: \nIn my opinion the only tradoff exist between: keeping the public API as simple as possible --VS-- maximizing performance.. - How about an optional PooledImage<TColor> : IDisposable?\n- Or an optional ArrayPool<TColor> parameter?\n- Or ImageBase<TColor> : IDisposable with a finalizer that helps out noob users 90% of the time?. Or an optional\ninterface IPooledImageFactory\n{\n    Image<TColor> Create<TColor>( .... ); // x N-constructors\n    void Release(IImage<TColor> image);\n}\nyou should at least leave an option for users who care about memory pressure.\n\nYou're gonna get LOH framentation with image processing anyway you cut it since you need to pin the array for processing.\n\nImageSharp arrays are not always pinned. Only when you Lock()them for a PixelAccessor. + With fast version of Span<T> maybe it's not necessary to pin the array.. :+1:  for not placing all the stuff under a single ImageSharp namespace. It would be soooo C++!\n:+1: for having a single version number for simplicity!. > On Formats... I intend for users to have to register formats in the manner Asp.NET Core requires registering Middleware and other objects - Convention always trumps configuration.\nHaving a static bootstrapper reminds me the service locator anti-pattern. Shouldn't a bootstrapper/configuration be an optional parameter on methods and Image constructors? Or shouldn't we integrate aspnet/DI somehow?. @JimBobSquarePants what about users who need different bootstrapping configurations in a single process? It's uncommon, but it can happen in extreme cases with laaaaarge applications.. > Basically, as it stands, without correct individual versioning there is no advantage to be gained in splitting up the library since we cannot release individual projects out-of-band.\nDisagree! Advantages could be:\n- For users: Reduced number of dependenciess --> smaller deployment package size\n- For us: Modularized ImageSharp solution, better separation\n\nTell them to bugger off for being awkward.\n\n:rofl: You're right, different configuration requirements should be very uncommon for an image processing library.. @tocsoft I was thinking about the same actually. There's no need to push a complicated API towards basic users. \n@JimBobSquarePants maybe it's YAGNI, but who knows, the zoo of users is large :D. @olivif these constants seem to be quite common, I'm using many of them in Jpeg across multiple classes. Don't we need a common place for them in ImageSharp/Numerics or ImageSharp/Colors? @dlemstra @JimBobSquarePants @tocsoft Your thoughts?. Ok, actually only new Vector4(255) seems to be super-common, maybe it doesn't worth to create a utility class only for this.\nPS:\n@olivif this change does not reduce number of allocations, because Vector4 is a value type. The code looks definitely better, but I'm not sure about the effects on performance, they can be even negative! The difference could be tested by inlining the constants in DCT.cs.. I just wanted to point out some misunderstandings. The code is definitely better, I think we should merge it now!. @JimBobSquarePants any initial, quick feedback? :). I will wait for the outcome of @JimBobSquarePants -s fight against VS2017.. @dlemstra I had sooo many issues with configuration systems (& other solutions) relying on global variables. Most modern frameworks tend to avoid this. Maybe you're right and for an image processing library it's YAGNI, but I think it's still worth to follow the best practices. If ImageSharp will be the NextGen(TM) image processing library of the .NET core world, I think some large and complex applications will make use of this feature.\nThe complexity is mostly about having an optional argument for Image constructors, it's not that hard to manage. . How should we manage common utility classes/methods that:\n- Are practical to be exposed to all ImageSharp subprojects and used in common, but\n- Are part of our implementation details, so it's better to hide them on ImageSharp public API-s?\nIs it a good practice to utilize [InternalsVisibleTo(\"...\")]  for this?. Shouldn't Configuration.SyncRoot be an instance member now? \nOFF: Is it really not allowed to comment on unchanged lines in a PR or have I missed something? . On my machine manually executing build.cmd results in:\nCS2001: Source file 'C:\\.....\\tocsofg.split-projects\\build\\../src/ImageSharp/stylecop.json' could not be found.\nBut I'm not a build system expert, and it's late here, so if there's no one else to reproduce it, or it was not designed for local execution, don't listen to me.\n:+1: for the versioning strategy. Yeahh, well done! Can't wait to review this!. @corradolab Agree with @tocsoft. Moving the position of a stream inside the decoder goes against the best practices.\nJust imagine the case, when the caller has a stream, where the image data is starting somewhere in the middle, and moves Position to the right place before decoding.. @JimBobSquarePants I still hope it can be done better, maybe using integers is not the best. Want to play a bit with benchmarks first to elaborate the most optimal way. (around 11pm CET)\nIs it ok if I push benchmark changes directly to the master?\nI know the (Encode|Decode)JpegMultiple benchmarks demand more patience, but running them could provide more information on this :smile: . Everything depends on the context. You need to be very cautious with float <-> int, float <-> byte, int <-> byte conversions, because they are quite expensive.\nRegarding accuracy: Maybe we could adopt an image comparsion techniques from MonoGame tests in the future.. I'm also thinking about a full replacement sometimes, and this guetzli library looks really nice. I'm not happy with the current results, because on large images System.Drawing is still much more faster on large images. Finding the reason is on my list, hope it's just multithreading.\nHowever doing the \"refactor to patterns\" approach in the past 2 months, I realized that that if we do it the right way, in the end will be impossible to recognize the original golang mess. Your mom is right, evolution works like this! :smile: . Improved the benchmarks so they reflect the context of the problem better. Played with other algorithms, none of them can beat the simplest scalar integer approach :smile: \nVector<T> really sucks. It can't even perform a vectorized dot product :cry: I wish I went to bed earlier instead.\nI think you should merge your changes!\nMethod |          Mean |     StdDev | Scaled | Scaled-StdDev |\n-------------------------------------------------------- |-------------- |----------- |------- |-------------- |\n                             'Floating Point Conversion' |   537.3523 ns |  2.3920 ns |   1.00 |          0.00 |\n                        'Simd Floating Point Conversion' |   767.8779 ns |  1.9016 ns |   1.43 |          0.01 |\n                             'Scaled Integer Conversion' |   497.1790 ns |  1.9141 ns |   0.93 |          0.01 |\n               'Scaled Integer Conversion + Vector<int>' |   604.9561 ns |  1.8976 ns |   1.13 |          0.01 |\n 'Scaled Integer Conversion + Vector<int> + Dot Product' | 7,053.9099 ns | 31.2488 ns |  13.13 |          0.08 |\n                         'Scaled Integer LUT Conversion' |   715.6920 ns |  1.9436 ns |   1.33 |          0.01 |. @JimBobSquarePants \nTested your changes the ***JpegMultiple benchmarks. The optimization factor is significant. On small images our encoder is now faster than System.Drawing!\nORIGINAL\nOPTIMIZED\nI also checked the images at TestOutput\\JpegTests and the results seem to be correct.\nRegarding the deep refactor of the Jpeg codec:\nI discourage now to start a full port-to-C#-from-scratch approach: at the current state it can bring much more \"chore\" work than a full clenup of our current codebase. The most (performance) critical part of the codec is the scan encoder/decoder part (DCT algorithms zigzagging etc.). It's now optimized for the CLR, covered with tests, and in the case of the decoder, moved to it's own class (JpegScanDecoder). It's prepared for further optimizations like parallelization.\nI'd rather suggest to follow a mixed approach: Maybe we can port an existing library like guetzli (or parts of it), and replace the scan part with our already CLR-optimized one. \nI spent large amounts of time digging for ideas to speedup the DCT part. Have not found anything that could be used with CLR. Maybe there is something \"around\" the SOS part, I've missed, but unlikely.\nHowever, I will continue my research. Are there any specific features you want to see in our codecs other than ICC profiles and progressive encoding?. Wanted to play with gif octrees and other perf related stuff, but it seems I gonna have a jpeg weekend :D. Okkay I have to confess! \nThe quality drop has been introduced to the encoder with the Block8x8F refactor :(\nDon't know yet, if it's an essential weakness of the floating point FDCT implementation or it's a mistake somewhere around it's application.\nI'm going to investigate this issue. If it's not possible to use a floating point SIMD alogorithm without a quality drop, I will refactor the code to use integer blocks again. \nI will also think about the guetzli port.. @JimBobSquarePants I made a rounding bug in Block8x8F.UnZigDivRound(). Fixed and pushed it. I see no quality difference compared to the old integer-based version now. However, System.Drawing  quality is still better.\nCheck out JpegTests.LoadResizeSave() if you want to compare our current results to bleroy-s ones. Added 2 of it's test images.. Yeah, in Jpeg we can spend endless amount of time to add features :)\nIf we ever start implementing/porting these, it's important to provide configuration and scaling options for the encoder. There is a  speed VS compression level VS image quality tradeoff. It won't be nice to enforce the same encoder characteristics for all users. \nAn example: guetzli uses double precision numbers in their DCT implementation for scaled blocks. I think it's needed to achieve their image quality. Made no benchmarks yet, but it should be slower than a single-precision SIMD implementation, like ours.. Isn't it just standard (poorly ported, therefore slow) libjpeg code, or have they added some special stuff?\nBy my opinion, it would be nice to have separate unit tests for these color converter pieces of code, so we can compare, refactor and optimize different implementations systematically and independently from all the other jpeg mess. I developed and optimized Block8x8F this way, it's a very efficient methodology.. Regarding progressive encoding:\nhave you seen any library out there that's not based on libjpeg and is capable to do it? (I don't care about the language.). Just pushed a change, that optimizes yesterdays rounding algorithm. (It became quite slow with the integers)\nBefore\nAfter. @JimBobSquarePants added a quickfix to this PR to address this issue.\nNow R# users should be capable to profile tests without the use of  the Sandbox46 project, however based on @tocsoft -s feedback it is still useful for vanilla VS users.\nShould we merge this? Any concerns?. @jackmott  @wcrooy or anyone who is interested in the speed of jpeg decoder/decoder:\nFor me the next step would be to figure out whether System.Drawing achieves it's performance by utilizing multiple cores. If the answer is yes, then it's possible to win this \"fight\" :)\nIt would be nice to have an optional switch on our benchmarks, so we can run them with single thread affinity, and compare the results.\nAny help, suggestion, PR is welcome :smile: . There is JobExtensions.WithAffinity(), but haven't played with it yet. \nWe need to find a way to (at least roughly) measure the parallel speedup of different solutions.. Sandbox46 has net461 as target framework. After altering the references in  ImageSharp.Sandbox46.csproj to the new dll-s this PR provides, and uninstalling the System.Numerics.Vectors nuget package it Just Worked (TM).\nNo trouble in other test projects, everything seems fine to me!. Seems OK to me. We can take care of the progressive stuff later.. No idea yet, maybe I can dive into the progressive stuff after some sleep.\nRegarding ~~@tocsoft~~ -s latest commit: I think it's better to have an exception, than having this output. People will keep complaining, and the code is quite messy with these try-catches.. Wait ... it was your commit @JimBobSquarePants :laughing: My concerns are the same though.. Yeah, no idea how to implement this in a clean way. It seems to be an actually exceptional exception. \nExcept for the users having these buggy inputs regularly.. Okkay, started to read jpeg articles to figure out the progressive stuff, hope I can deal with it.\nI think we should merge this (without d05b06b), I will create a new PR if I manage to fix #18 . We are currently waiting for reliable VS2017 tooling (for C#7 ref returns) and for new official corefx packages for Span<T> and other low level memory management stuff. \nI think we could introduce design changes based on these features. :+1: for something like IPixelStorageProvider. . For implementations plans see: #565.. I always checked my outputs, so stupid I missed this anomaly in the left corner :smile:. I think I fixed it. Need to be careful with Array.Lengthon rented arrays...\n@JimBobSquarePants @dlemstra @tocsoft anyone interested in a review? Or should we just Merge N'Go? :smile: . Ohh that Southern Hemisphere alternative universe... :smile: . Okkay! Thanks!. FYI: the cause of codecov-io complainments is the lack of tests for the new error handler else branches in the Jpeg Decoder. We need more bad input images for exhaustive \"EOF-tolerance\" testing.. @nah0y I'm afraid, there is no hardware SIMD acceleration for System.Numerics.Vectors types in your runtime. After a quick (non-exhausting) googling it seems Mono added this feature only a month ago.\nWhat is the value of System.Numerics.Vector.IsHardwareAccelerated in release mode?\nIf it's false, the only way to speed up ImageSharp jpeg encoder/decoder is to upgrade to the latest mono framework/runtime. (You probably need to build from sources.). Renamed the issue to hold more information about the context.. @nah0y yeah you need a new mono version, 4.8 should be the next one, but I see no info about System.Numerics.Vectors in their roadmap. Maybe you should ask on their forums.\nThanks for sharing your results. Looking at resize performance is on my list. Strange it's that slow on Mono. . @nah0y I don't know if you are still interested, but recently I figured out that SIMD support will be shipped with mono 5.0.\nWe are also working on perf. improvements meanwhile.. @clegendre Unfortunately I'm unfamiliar with mobile development and the details of the Xamarin architecture. 4k*3k means lots of pixels, what are the expected times for that operation (using other libraries/applications) on your mobile device? \nAlso: What is the value of  System.Numerics.Vector.IsHardwareAccelerated on your device? Are you sure you tested it in release mode?\nIt seems, that it's not necessary to decode the image pixels in your use case, only the exif data + resave the modified exif with the original pixel data. @JimBobSquarePants shouldn't we add support for this?. @KLuuKer I don't think it's a good idea. SetPixels() is a public function, users consuming it from a release binary will not notice they are doing something wrong when a non-buffered array is \"released\".\n@JimBobSquarePants \nLooking forward for @tocsoft -s gist, maybe his work fill change my mind, but currently I'm very concerned, this PR would leave a fundamental problem that must be fixed in the near future: \nSetPixels() is no longer maintainable as a safe API in it's current form! Specially not as a public API.\nThe presence of the empty catch{} block is a good indicator (code smell), that something is wrong.\nI would rather delegate the ownership management of the buffers to a separate safe, PixelStorageProvider-like abstract class as commented under #88 with a default ArrayPool-driven implementation. It should care about the concern of safely swapping the buffer under an image. It will also enable supporting many custom scenarios in the future.\nI would be happy to create a PR for this after #97 is merged!. It's a leaky abstraction now:\nIt's intended to be used used with arrays rented from PixelPool<TColor>, but it's not enforced, nor verified when we call SetPixels(). We will know we made something wrong only when Dispoese() throws an exception internal to ArrayPool. (Worse, if not throwing anything ...). @JimBobSquarePants it's not well documented but as I understand there must be an exception thrown, when you return a non-pooled array.. @JimBobSquarePants a non-throwing could be even worse: the user makes a mistake by using SetPixels() with a non buffered array and he will not notice it at all!\n@tocsoft Good job, SwapPixelsBuffers() is much better than SetPixels() was! This way it's not blinking in red in my eyes anymore! :) \nHowever I feel buffer management/swapping is not a PixelAccessor concern, that's why I want to think about moving this logic to a separate class later.. Lets get it finished! ;) This IDisposable is really not that :bat:IDisposable:bat: !. @vpenades \n- Large managed buffers mostly end up on Large Object Heap.\n- Literally speaking it's just managed memory, like basic (small) objects, but in practice they are really expensive to  manage by the GC. It's a leaky abstraction, and a major performance bottleneck for an imaging library.\n- The .NET team addressed this issue by defining a utility called ArrayPool. It follows a Rent/Return logic which is very similar to the allocate/free logic of unmanaged resources. Much safer though: if you forget to return the array it will be GC-d, no memory leak will happen.\n- The backing buffers of ImageSharp images are pooled now: arrays are rented in the constructor, and returned in Dispose().. > In my case, I wanted to use imageSharp in a project that moves images from one filter to another, in a way that's not easy to tell when to dispose an image.\nI suggest you to describe your issue in a more specific way on our gitter channel! We can help you to find the best solution for your use case :). Thanks! Almost did the same merge :). My only concern is compilation speed.\nMaybe I'm not using Visual Studio and the projects in a proper way, but currently when I need to run a single test after a small change in the ImageSharp core project Projects \u2715 Targets compilations are executed. Adding a new target will make Edit+Compile+Run cycles even longer, having a bad effect on productivity.\nIs it possible to solve this?. I think we can address the compilation speed issue later. Maybe after switching to VS2017.. @ZhiqiangTao\n- Make sure you are using the newest official MyGet packages\n- Image formats live in separate packages. Make sure you are referencing ImageSharp.Formats.Jpeg\n- When posting an issue, do not remove the issue template, it's here for a reason. @JimBobSquarePants your issue with tests is exactly the reason why I'm dreaming about a statistical image comparer and reference output images for processor and codec test cases :). Seems they are checking for exact binary equality.\nNot a roboust solution once you have floating point algorithms.. To generate the expected results:\n- We can use a tool like ImageMagick\n- Or sometimes maybe we can generate them with our own implementations after we made sure visually the output is OK. - Not the best solution, but still protects us from breaking something unintentionally.. Awesome idea! . UPDATE: unfortunately the situation is more complicated, see next comment.\nIt was very strange to me the difference difference between jagged and Fast2DArray is that slight, so I looked at your benchmark, and was like \noh nooo,\n\nThere is simply too much noise: JIT is a stupid guy, it will generate tons of useless instructions around the real stuff we want to measure. \nUPDATE: My previous statement is not completely true. I learnt that the effect of other JIT optimizations (like bounds check elimination) can be more significant, than the ceremonial cost of invoking the benchmarks.\n.. So I made a modified version of the benchmarks, also including a raw 1D variant.\nWith these ~we have results that make sense!~ I felt the results are better:\nMethod | Count |       Mean |    StdErr |    StdDev | Scaled | Scaled-StdDev |\n------------------------------------ |------ |----------- |---------- |---------- |------- |-------------- |\nFlatArrayIndex |     4 | 12.4112 ns | 0.1515 ns | 0.6061 ns |   0.63 |          0.03 |\n'Array access using 2D array' |     4 | 19.6437 ns | 0.0178 ns | 0.0689 ns |   1.00 |          0.00 |\n'Array access using a jagged array' |     4 | 16.3029 ns | 0.0202 ns | 0.0781 ns |   0.83 |          0.00 |\n'Array access using Fast2DArray' |     4 | 12.5566 ns | 0.0190 ns | 0.0658 ns |   0.64 |          0.00 |\n | | | | | | |\nFlatArrayIndex |    16 | 12.8350 ns | 0.1215 ns | 0.4707 ns |   0.63 |          0.03 |\n'Array access using 2D array' |    16 | 20.3895 ns | 0.2246 ns | 0.8700 ns |   1.00 |          0.00 |\n'Array access using a jagged array' |    16 | 16.2835 ns | 0.0276 ns | 0.1068 ns |   0.80 |          0.03 |\n'Array access using Fast2DArray' |    16 | 12.9458 ns | 0.0320 ns | 0.1240 ns |   0.64 |          0.03 |\n | | | | | | |\nFlatArrayIndex |   128 | 12.0066 ns | 0.0161 ns | 0.0625 ns |   0.60 |          0.01 |\n'Array access using 2D array' |   128 | 19.8725 ns | 0.0476 ns | 0.1844 ns |   1.00 |          0.00 |\n'Array access using a jagged array' |   128 | 16.7680 ns | 0.0909 ns | 0.3522 ns |   0.84 |          0.02 |\n'Array access using Fast2DArray' |   128 | 12.9790 ns | 0.0630 ns | 0.2270 ns |   0.65 |          0.01 |\nNotice, there is almost no difference between the flat and the Fast2DArray variant.\nFor contrast: on my machine the original benchmark results are really strange and misleading!\nShould I push my changes into this pr? :).

(As it does in your original benchmark.) Confused now about my knowledge of JIT, but still being untrustful towards small nanobenchmarks anyways. They lack the context that matters to JIT to apply optimizations.. Seems ok to me.. @dlemstra now the exception is thrown only in debug mode, which makes one of the tests failing on CI.  Theoretical question of the day: do we need coverage for debug only stuff? . @JimBobSquarepants @dlemstra @tocsoft Any other change requests except bringing back  IPackedVector < T > ? . I think a VSCode installation is enough to test this,  we don't even need linux. . Well done, seems OK to me!. @Toxantron Needed \"BenchmarkDotNet.Core\": \"0.10.2\" reference to make it work on Windows, dropped the change  into this PR. Hope it's still working fine on your linux machine.. I have no idea why did appveyor fail on my commit :(\nWith these set of changes, the only strange thing I got is the following message when I run the benchmarks from command line with dotnet:\n`Assembly ImageSharp.Benchmarks, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null which defines benchmarks references non-optimized CoreCompat.System.Drawing`\nHave no explanation for this, results are almost the same.. Burlesque mode on: Reverted the change, now it seems to be OK without the additional dependency. \nI've been playing with Job attributes [CoreJob, ClrJob] - maybe there was a configuration where they were working only with the extra dependency.\nIf one other contributor could try this on Windows, and confirm that everything is OK, I think we should merge this, and continue our experiments from there. @JimBobSquarePants thoughts?. Ehh sorry, my fault again \ud83d\ude05 \nThanks for fixing it @JimBobSquarePants!. @Andy-Wilkinson I wanted to try the code, but I couln't find a working solution. \n@JimBobSquarePants will finish switching all our stuff in main branch to VS2017 soon. You can integrate your work better then :). Using a using block would be much safer, than calling .Dispose() manually.\nI don't think we can reproduce your scenario from the sample above. If you are 100% sure ImageSharp-s code is leaking, it must be do so in a simple, short, standalone console application too. That would be very helpful, and definitely a thing we should investigate.. I think @tocsoft is right, it works as expected. The arrays managed by ArrayPool are being reused if you create images with same, or smaller sizes. We do this to avoid allocation overhead and LOH fragmentation\nIf the \"leaked memory\" stops growing after the application is warmed up, I think you have nothing to be worried about.. Can anyone help me investigating why do my changes break NamedColors<Color> stuff on appveyor? It is totally OK on may machine. I have no idea what should I do :(\nUPDATE:\nThe build was succesful for the second time, after a minor change having no effect on NamedColors! What's going on?. Ok, then I would merge this soon.\nFYI: Renamed ArrayPointer<T> to BufferPointer<T> to match PinnedBuffer<T>-s name. \nThere would be a third member in this family called BufferArea<T>, it seemed to be better to follow a common naming convention.. I'm still working on making bulkpixels used. Very close to finish it. Need 1 or 2 days until the last PR comes :) . @drunkappveyor is drunk again. @JimBobSquarepants should I merge this now? . @JimBobSquarePants\nRe: Convolution processors:\n\nWe only initialise these arrays once.\n\nIt's not about the cost of initializing an array, it's about heap allocated VS stack allocated data. With a stack allocated kernel matrix you can be 100% sure the coefficients are always in the L1 cache, and you have a pretty high chance they actually fit into CPU registers. It's a common practice in imaging libraries to keep this data stack-allocated. The difference in perf should be huge.\nRe: Resize resampler window\n\nClose to zero won't cut it for many consumers, trust me, they'll spot any difference from other libraries. \n\nI mean,  about >=80% of the values in the window could be <0.0001. You can safely drop them without loss of quality, no human being can spot it :) Most libraries do this stuff with small kernel matrices. Using a window of destinationWidh size seems to be a large waste of CPU resources.\nRe: Octree\n\nDon't compare Octree vs Palette.\n\nI don't want to. I just want  to have a benchmark that proves, that the current Octree implementation is horribly slow :) I mean, in orders of magnitude slower than it should be! There are two major issues I noticed in the code:\n- The depth of the tree is not limited. It means, that the worst case complexity for building the tree could be as bad as O(n*n). This is not acceptable, we should introduce a depth limit as a parameter. With a wisely chosen, (relatively large) limit we can improve the speed without loosing quality, reducing the algorithmic complexity to O(n).\n- Nodes are allocated with new. Turning them into struct-s and implementing a custom allocator logic that \"allocates\" them in a continous memory area (an array) should improve a lot. They can reference each other by C#7 ref locals then.\nI'd really like to see an up-to-grab issue for each of these topics. It can help keeping track of our work, and if we are lucky, new contributors could pick them.. @JimBobSquarePants \nHere is a list of topics I'd like to open issues for:\n- Convolution processors and value type kernels (API breaking!)\n- Resize: investigate sampler window (API breaking?)\n- Improve Octree (benchmark, limit tree depth, value type nodes)\n- Implementing/porting a statistical image comparer for test output verification\n- Jpeg\n  - Huffmann decoder optimization (current bottleneck in JpegDecoder)\n  - Eliminate all internal non-floating point data\n  - Refactor the encoder\n  - (Should we have one jpeg issue for all of them?)\nPoints that might be simpler to solve without opening issues (?), but we still need to track our work:\n- Review PixelArea (API breaking!)\n- Reviewing Parallel.For usages\nUPDATE\nThe most urgent topics are the ones that affect the public API. (At least if we don't want the library to stick with slow-by-design API-s ...). I go on with my monolouge here, trying to give a more general context to my proposals.\nOn modern architectures the most expensive CPU operation is accessing the memory:\n\nIt means that code optimizations should focus on reducing cache misses. This can be achieved by making good choices on data structures and reducing non-cache-friendly operations (like virtual calls) on hot paths. \nAll in all: \n- Making a library fast is 90% about the design, and only 10% about occasional microoptimizations.\n- I'd really love to see more Data Oriented Design and Systems Programming approach in ImageSharp!\nI know this is a relatively new thing in the world of .NET library development (prepared by Joe Duffy-s brilliant work, and driven by .NET Core's business goals today), but we are the guys who love to learn new things aren't we? :) \nI think if we want to develop this library with a performance-as-a-feature mindset, it's mandatory to change our coding style to follow DOD principles!. ### TLDR\nI'm asking for:\n- Opening individual issues, so we can track our investigations (on perf related and non-perf related) topics better\n- Internalizing stuff where design changes can bring in improvements (ie. convolution processors)\nOn internalization\n~I'm happy we agreed on internalization!~ This way these points will not block the beta. Customization and extensibility is not necessarily a 1.0 feature anyways :)\nUPDATE\nAfter a second careful read, I noticed that you don't want to internalize processor implementations. With processors where the perf issues are caused by design choices you have 3 options then:\n- Stick with a slow solution\n- Break the public API\n- Introduce a new processor implementation for the same thing\nNone of them sounds good to me.\nRegarding topics I started to discuss:\nI'm still quite sure (let's say 80% sure), that my assumptions are true on all of them. At this point I base my critiques on investigation of the code and my knowledge on the specific algorithms and cache friendly development practices (mostly adopted from C++).\nThe problem is that even a proper benchmark based proof, or other proper investigation could take a large amount of time, for each topic! As you see, even discussing them in a single issue is quite hard. That's why I suggested opening individual issues for all of them.\nIf we open them, I will continuously add the results of my investigations to the issues, proving that we can improve a lot on each topics! If the investigation shows that I was wrong, I will be happy to close the issue. (But it wont! :)\nAlso, if a new developer wants to join in, and help with perf, this could be a good guide about where to start.. #### RE Octree\n\nThere's already a maximum depth of 8 for each level.\n\nI mean the total depth of the tree, not individual levels!\nWhat was the image size on your benchmarks? I noticed issues with large images (2000*2000 min). A proper benchmark would have the image size in MegaPixels as [Params] and check the growth of computation time against the growth of the input size. I'm quite sure it won't be linear.\nUPDATE:\nRE Convolution kernels\nFast2DArray<T> is just a wrapper over a heap object. I mean real value type object like Matrix4x4. I know this is not trivial because of the different kernel sizes, but I have an idea to solve this! You can expect 2x speedup or more! But I need time to elaborate it, that's why I'm suggesting internalization.. > The library isn't slow.\nDepends on the benchmarks you use. It's not hard to construct benchmarks (for real life scenarios!) that prove the opposite :P Okkay, maybe it's not slow, but there is a lot of space for improvements! And I know the specific points where we can improve!  :). @blackcity I'm not saying I want to optimize with native code. I'm saying I want to adapt DOD techniques which are usually uncommon in pure C# code, but quite common in C/C++ projects. \nJust being curious: what is your use case? (Input format, typical image sizes, applied processors, output format) . @JimBobSquarePants happy to see #137 open! \nI will take care of B, continously adding my points.. > which might improve performance.\nMight or might not :) [System.Runtime.InteropServices.FieldOffset(1)] is an unaligned costruct, therefore  it might be implemented with more or more expensive CPU instuctions than the \"more aligned\" [System.Runtime.InteropServices.FieldOffset(4)] case.\nThe best way to investigate the FieldOffset VS bitshift question is to create two benchmarks comparing these implementations.. @jackmott @JimBobSquarePants I was also thinking about fine-tuning the workload sizes, and came to the conclusion that we need a nested range-based solution to reduce cache misses and false sharing, having a for(i=range.Min;i<range.Max;i++) -style loop inside the parallel lambda.\nI wasn't aware that Partitioner could simplify our job here, so thanks for the hint! \ud83d\udc4d . @TechnikEmpire please, post your image here, and I will investigate it! Our jpeg decoder is strongly optimized with SIMD for a certain super-common category of images, but not yet for others. There is a lot of work here, and we are a very small team.\nReacting your deleted post:\nYeah, @JimBobSquarePants was a bit rude here, but let's not start flaming each other here, and get back to a constructive path! I'm sure everyone here wants to make this library better. @JimBobSquarePants spent crazy amounts of time to start the library and shape a good API. When I joined the team, I did the same to make it faster. I strongly believe, that in long term it's possible to achieve close-to native performance. It's just a matter of invested work.. @TechnikEmpire no worries, I'm glad, you figured it out!\nAlso good to know, if you have have came across the posts of a guy on StackOverflow evangelizing that the library is slow: he was \"benchmarking\" it in Debug mode.. Updated my VS2017, and my R# to 2017.1 EAP.  Everything seems to work fine what I need for a smooth workflow, including performance profiling with Sandbox46. Well done! :+1: \nIDE stability is very far from perfect though, at least for R# users.. What about non-C#7 users? Will they be able to consume indexers on PixelAccessor?\nI'm really curious about the amount of perf improvement this code change brings. We need a (non-nano) benchmark to emulate the \"pack-to-refreturns\"  (and purely that!) scenario, informing us about the effects of this microoptimization technique.\nI also want to work on the resize code soon. I want to replace the first-pass pixelaccessor with a PinnedBuffer of Vector4-s here! . > As far as I understand they can yes, they just get the value-type as normal. I think...\nHow about setting the value? Haven't researched this topic yet, not sure if everything works as we expect. Or... I dont even know what to expect from IL features that are not in the languge. Fun fact: array indexers are implemented as ref returns from the very beginning (!), but its a languge-level hack. . @JimBobSquarepants check out my idea on octree optimization ;) . I have made a quite detailed response on #130. Really need your feedback :). @tocsoft how about an internal IImageTestCallbacks interface and an optional internal Image<T>.TestCallbacks property?\nIt's a common issue with TDD, that it has an effect on the design, but I generally support everything, that improves testability! We need to find clever ways to restrict the side effects.. Looks good to me. @dlemstra do you approve this?. @ZhiqiangTao see answers on #123. Looks good to me! \nPixelArea is internal, all memory utils are internal, processors are internal ... can't think of anything else.. OK found one another thing: \nProtected virtual methods in Quantizer base class. Per-pixel virtual calls lead to instant cache misses, I don't think users should hook into them.. I think we should merge this so everyone can continue his work without conflicts :). Completed the first 2 points in #141 resulting in a 30% drop in execution time. Switching to a Vector4 -based pixeltype could bring in additional 10% or more for the non-compand case because of the faster bulk-conversions.\nI'm not planning to touch the others before the beta. Anyone who has interest: feel free to contribute or write your suggestions :). I'll checkout the code and do a quick investigation + review now.. Managed to track down allocations with the basic VS memory profiler! :)\n\nThe most allocations are done by 'SixLabors.Shapes.InternalPath.FindIntersections()`. I suspect it's this line.\n@tocsoft I think you can solve internally without using heap objects :)\nSome usefult info on call times, if you want to speed up things a bit:\n\nI think applying Vector2 SIMD operations and some inlining in intersection calculator could help here ;)\nI don't think we should bother with optimization right in this PR, I'm adding my comments for information.. Personally I would like to see this merged ASAP, so I can resolve conflicts with changes I made on the speedup-resize branch. I can't see any fundamental problem here, we can do optimization later.. I think it's enough to move out if-s from the inner loop. We can benchmark a version where they are outside the outer loops, but I don't think it's worth the efforts.. @JimBobSquarePants hmm .. originally I wanted to polish + standardize our memory management in the next few months, but there are many uncertainties around that topic, so maybe I'll grab this one instead.\nThere is a lot of work here though, but maybe we can make it into 1.0.. Makes sense to me :+1: \nWe can even consider the following: With static Load() methods we are capable to pass an IImageDecoder or an IImageFormat explicitly:\n- Users might restrict their load call to a specific decoder. If they know their image format, we don't need to force them having a seekable stream, or construct a MemoryStream internally (for header detection).\n- Better encapsulation for tests: the decoder selection logic won't be executed when we are testing a specific decoder.. Hmm ... you're right, but maybe it's worth to define an Image.Load(stream, decoder, options) wrapper for the sake of API consistency.. @tocsoft just wanted to post the same ;)\n@MaddoScientisto few questions:\n- Can you share the stack trace of Inner Exception 2?\n- Is the same exception thrown when the image width is <1024?. @MaddoScientisto there's no need!\nWhat is the value of Vector.IsHardwareAccelerated on your machine?. Should be fixed with the next new package release. (1.0.0-alpha5-00036)\n@MaddoScientisto @kierenj Can you check the situation with your bad (32 bit?) configs where Vector.IsHardwareAccelerated == false?. @MattWhilden So it happened sometimes on 64bit ~RyuJIT~ runtime? I could only reproduce it by forcing a 32 bit build. Or was this UWP specific?\nOur reporters were all .NET core server users AFAIK.. Yeah my comment was also really confused, nevermind it,\nI think I get it now: \nsimilar issues used to happen on the Native runtime too .. but this is not the case anymore :)\nIf this also means that all the System.Numerics.Vectors stuff is SIMD accelerated on .NET Native now, it should be really good news for ImageSharp UWP users because we heavily rely on SIMD optimizations :). @DeCarabas Thank you for your detailed report!\n@JimBobSquarePants based on these issues it seems obvious to me, that we need to make our pooling configurable. My proposal:\nhttps://gist.github.com/antonfirsov/25301496604015fbfe7f2b90d608a190. Individual pools could be customized by implementing custom IArrayPoolProvider -s. There will be no such thing as Configuration.DecodedJpegBlockArrayPoolLimit because it's an implementation detail we want to hide.\n@DeCarabas why do you feel a byte-measured limit is hard to tune?\n@tocsoft I would be much happier to operate on \"typeless\" generic byte[] buffers but I'm afraid Unsafe.As<> is just too unsafe, and it would lead to bugs like #146.\nThe problem is that Unsafe.As<int[]>(new byte[1]).GetType() == typeof(byte[]).. @DeCarabas our main difficulties:\n- Jpeg decoder implementation is changing rapidly, so it's really dangerous to expose this kind of super-specific fine-tuning option on a public API. \n- Not only DecodedBlock-s are pooled. There are dozens of different places using array pools in different codec implementations. We have to think about all the use cases, not just yours :) \nWe can only solve these by thinking in a general way.\nWhat could be a fair compromise for me: we can introduce IDecoderOptions.ArrayPoolProviderOverride , so you can tune the pooling for a specific decoding process. It will limit down, or disable pooling for DecodedBlock and temporal jpeg image buffers (JpegPixelArea.Pixels) as well.\nAlso totally agree with @JimBobSquarePants: a fragmented LOH could also lead to OutOfMemoryException-s.. I think we would provide an easy way to disable pooling by setting Configuration.ArrayPoolProvider to null or a similar construct. By implementing your own ArrayPool you can take even more control, eg. add flushing. (There is no such builtin feature in the default System.Buffers implementation ).. hmm ... maybe this isn't just normal ArrayPool behaviour, it can be an actual leak.\n@BrianThomson I'm planning to reproduce your use case within a console application. ~Have you used the same 13MB JPEG multiple times? How many requests resulted in 2.4GB allocation? Is it growing linearly with the number of requests?~\nEDIT:\nIf this was the result of a single Image.Load() call, can you post that image?\n@dlemstra re ArrayPoolProvider:\nI think we need to finish this investigation before implementing anything. Also: if I understand you properly, an ArrayPoolProvider returning a new ArrayPool on every request is basically implementing the non-pooling case in a complicated way: allocating 1 instance of ArrayPool<T> and 1 instance of T[] at for each Rent() request. I think we need to find something better for this.. @JimBobSquarePants DecodedBlockArray is a struct, but the wrapped array inside it will be copied by reference, so we are not creating+copying an actual new array here.\nAlso not returning to the pool will result in GC-ing te array, and the issue is with the arrays that are actually kept in the pool.\nWe need to benchmark + memory profile the ArrayPool behavour with big images + different image sizes to investigate this properly.. @BrianThomson your problem seems to be pretty different. Actually, it's the opposite of @DeCarabas 's one:\nWith our current hard-coded settings DecodedBlock ArrayPool-s are switching to a non-pooling behaviour at these input sizes, so you must be running out of LOH memory.\nTry executing this, after you finished your request:\nGCSettings.LargeObjectHeapCompactionMode = GCLargeObjectHeapCompactionMode.CompactOnce;\nGC.Collect();\nImageSharp should not eat up 2.4GB decoding a single Jpeg, or at least I can't reproduce that case. With a 29MB Jpeg I was able to keep the memory consumption under 1.5GB using GCSettings.LargeObjectHeapCompactionMode.\nIf your experience is different, a sample image with simple reproduction steps is really welcome!\nAlso keep in mind, that our current Jpeg solution we have chosen an optimization which tries to reduce CPU load with a relatively large memory footprint. I'm in favor of this approach, because memory seems to be much easier to scale than CPU.. @BrianJThomson can you share your test app (or a simplified version of your test app) together with the test image(s) you are using? It would be very helpful!\n@JimBobSquarePants This DecodedBlock[] -specific memory issue also can be interpreted as a side effect of #90 (which fixed #18). It's possible to implement a decoder option which disables the two-step decoding, because most users do not need it. It will complicate the decoders code though.. I can try to fix this by introducing a switch IJpegDecoderOptions.SingleStep on the public API. By enabling it, the large memory consumption by DecodedBlock[] will be entirely eliminated, but you won't be able to decode corrupt progressive Jpeg-s perfectly (see this comment on #18).\nMaking a fix that handles both corner cases (very large Jpegs + erroneous progressive Jpegs) seems to be really hard, and needs unpredictable amount of time. I won't be able to do it in the next 6-8 weeks.\n@JimBobSquarePants @BrianJThomson @DeCarabas thoughts?. @JimBobSquarePants I'm taking back my previous comments, because I got lost in details of the current implementation. We have to make one step back, because the problem is more general, and leads to hard CPU vs Memory design questions.\nA few numbers on 10k x 10k images:\n- 10k*10k Pixels = 100MP\n- A 100MP image uses 400MB of memory even with the compact, uint packed in-memory representation!\n- With a Vector4-based (CPU-optimized!) pixel type it would be 1.6GB!\n- DecodedBlock arrays are basically holding a similar intermediate representation with the total size of Pixels * 4 * Channels bytes, which is ~1.2GB for a 10k\u00d710k 3-channel image!\nHere is the hard problem:\n- In our current plans the default pixel type would be based on Vector4 becuse it enables much faster execution paths utilizing SIMD, and removing/speeding-up conversion operations. \nBut: Image : Image<Vector4Color> would use 4-times more memory than the current Image : Image<UInt32Color> solution!\n- Following the design plan preferring Vector4, I'm planning a Vector4-all-the-way Jpeg refactor in order to speed-up and simplify the decoder. \nBut: it would consume Pixels * 4 * Channels bytes instead of Pixels * Channels bytes in all cases, even if we elminate DecodedBlock arrays! Users with 100MP Jpegs will end up using 1.6GB for the decoder process instead of 400MB.\nPersonally I think memory is a cheaper, and more scalable resource than CPU, so in the general case it is better to optimize reducing the CPU load, even with a price of a larger memory footprint. Maybe we should find a general way to provide alternative implementations and guidelines for users having their memory as bottleneck.. @DeCarabas\nRe 3: \nConversion between packed representations and Vector4 is expensive in terms of CPU work. If we want to run fast, we need to keep all the buffers in Vector4 where possible.\nRe 2: \nIt is possible for non-progressive Jpegs, but needs a lot of investigation and refactor work, and our resources are very limited at the moment. With progressive Jpegs we have to keep all the decoded blocks between different scans, so it's even harder.\n@BrianJThomson your test image is non-progressive. Is this a general situation in your use-cases?\n@tocsoft agree that we can try doing some magic with Unsafe-casting, to reduce the number of our arraypools, but it won't save users with large images and memory limits. With Vector4 intermediate representation 1.6GB is a theoretical minimum for a 100MP image. (Unless we implement an optimization @DeCarabas described in his point 2.)\n@blackcity Good hint, need to have a look at at memory mapped files!. @JimBobSquarePants I have a very strong feeling that we need a switch on IDecoderOptions (and/or Configuration) which gives a hint for different implementations whether they should optimize for CPU or memory. This way we can give control to users without polluting the public API with implementation-specific details.\nThis could reduce the current \"solve everything\" expectations for Jpeg decoder to manageable requirements. If our implementations get smarter with time, we can ignore this switch without breaking the public API.\nEg.: I have an idea to refactor the Jpeg decoder so it would use <500MB  for 100MP images but run slower. With some more work it's even possible to do it in the progressive case. . @blackcity nice work!\n\nDoes it work reliably on all devices and target platforms (Linux, MacOs)?\n\nI might be naive, but I think if it's the part of the standard, than it should be OK.\n\nHow does the massive parallel and unsafe code work with MMF. Is it reliable?\n\nWe should avoid parallel processing when operating on MMF buffers. It's not hard to do so in Jpeg code.\n\nLater this should be a generic memory manager accessible for all types in the library of course.\n\nDo you think it's possible to integrate it with our core memory buffer class? (It will not be pinned, I'm currently removing all the pointers.). I've been thinking on this issue for weeks. It is a hard one not only because the tricky implementation details. Defining a public memory management API which allows the right customization options is a non-trivial design task, because the solution has to be maintainable and future-proof.\nWe need to keep the doors open for the future standard memory management libraries like:\n- System.Memory\n- System.Buffers.Primitives\nI think I managed to came up with a design which meets all the user requests described in this discussion, and also keeps things extensible. I'd like to introduce a MemoryManager class, which could solve following stuff:\n- Allows enabling, disabling, configuring and flushing ArrayPool-s\n- Does the first steps towards making our memory management pluggable, without exposing the internal details\n  - This will allow using MMF for certain tasks as part of our core memory logic\n  - In the future it will be possible to use MemoryManagers which allocate (or refer to) unmanaged memory\nHere is my proposal\nIt doesn't deal with implementation details, only with the API. To integrate the MMF stuff, we need to change BufferSpan to make it work with unmanaged pointers. (Just like System.Span does,) \n@JimBobSquarePants @tocsoft @dlemstra @blackcity @DeCarabas can you have a look?. I think only Span<T> will be finished for that time. We can decide then to:\n- Wait for the System.Buffers.Primitives to be finalized\n- Go with our own buffer API-s. They might fit image processing needs better anyways.\nI made a big mistake in the proposal ignoring the fact that ArrayPool<T> is generic.  Gonna fix it now.. @tocsoft ReleaseMemory() might be misleading, specially for an unmanaged MemoryManager, because it does not release anything that is being used by the library at the moment of the ReleaseMemory() call. I think we need to find a better name. Renamed it to Reset() for now.\n@JimBobSquarePants I also have an excuse: never should make gists before lunch! :) Updated it now. Things became a bit more complex around the pooling manager.\n@dlemstra It might be possible to implement a MemoryManager which does swapping, but it seems to be a really difficult at the moment. It might be good enough for our users if we allow them switching to MMF over certain buffer sizes (see the JpegMMF example).. @DeCarabas @BrianJThomson If you are still using ImageSharp, check out the beta (on NuGet!), the Jpeg decoder uses much less memory now! Let me know if the situation is still critical for you!. Finally, something will prevent me from adding bugs! ^^. This is intentional:\nBasically, we target 1.1 to access the widest possible range of platform implementations, while additionally targeting newer platforms (like 1.3) let's us to provide API-s which could not be provided with 1.1. Thanks for the detailed feedback!\nThere are several rounding conversions in the Jpeg Decoder code resulting in cumulated roundoff errors bigger than necessary.\nI'm planning to do a floating-point-all-the-way refactor for Jpeg decoder; @JimBobSquarePants will implement a Vector4-based pixel type. Let's see the results after these changes have been implemented!\nHowever I'm afraid we can't provide 100% numerical correctness. because ImageSharp codebase depends heavily on floating point SIMD operations.. I'm quite sure the Jpeg refactor I'm planning will bring benefits in both performance and accuracy. \nIt's a lot of work though, and my list is pretty long. :( . Yeah, I'm planning to open a \"JpegDecoder Improvements\" issue, summarizing all the Jpeg Decoder related TODO-s, so anyone who wants to join the project could pick it ;). Yeah, maybe I could rethink the rounding logic here one day with a clean afternoon brain :). @sgjsakura our Jpeg accuracy has been improved a lot with beta-1 (now available on NuGet). Do you find the results good enough now?. @brianpopow should be fixed as soon as we merge #571 (very soon!). @vinhhrv sorry, I made & deleted a comment by mistake! I thought this was duplicate of 146. \n132 is not fixed yet, definitely a duplicate here :). @NelsonFord the decoded image is not a Jpeg in the memory any longer, it's smaller only in the HDD. You can buy cheaper tapes for your C64! ;)\n@vinhhrv Guetzli is not a general-case Jpeg encoder, it is for users who can invest large amount of CPU work to make their images smaller. We don't have plans to implement such feature at the moment. \nAlso, please use our gitter channel to discuss these kinds of quick ideas. See our contribuiton guide!. @tocsoft he has a link in the issue description :). It's merged now, so I'm a bit late, but I have a few remarks here:\n- There is no real difference between the new Color struct and the old one which is Rgba32 now. The memory layout is the same, the API-s seem to be the same, only the implementations are different. I wonder if we need them both.\n- I think we should find a better name for ColorVector. The name should reflect the semantic details of that struct, like RgbaVector. (To be honest I also don't like the name Color for the same reason, but I understand if it's here for API simplicity.). Its trivial to make Color implementing IPackedVector<uint>, and they will be exactly the same!\nIts ok to maintain monogame compatibility, but monogame actually doesn't do anything through that interface. The compatibility is here by having identical binary buffer formats, no one will use an interface with small value types (boxing!), they will just memcpy the buffers. So I dont think \"packed types\" is a real category, and its not worth to bring noise to our colorspace model by having two identical structures with an artifical difference between their implemented interfaces. \nI think VectorRgba or RgbaVector is a good name for ColorVector. Its rgba and its a vector :) . There are two options:\n1. Having an \"additional\" uint field with [FieldOffset(0)]  that overlaps the struct. It can be manipulated by the by the property  then. \n2. return Unsafe.As<Color, uint>(ref this) should also do the job. . @JimBobSquarePants much better! \ud83d\udc4d \nCould be even better if I had the money for that bribe! \ud83d\ude04\n\nI want the relationship to Color to be obvious.\n\nThe only relationship is the order of the components. Even if you keep the name Color for API simplicity, for me it feels cleaner to provide descriptive names for the rest, including the Vector4 pixel type.. Looks good to me.\nI \u2764\ufe0f how ImageSharp API evolves, finding it's path towards the best possible imaging solution in C#.. I definitely want this! :)\nOur ImageSharp.Benchmarks.csproj project currently targets net461 only. It would be nice to have something that utilizes all those [***Job]-s. I'm really interested in mono numbers.\nBut it also needs to be configurable, because in certain cases I want to run benchmarks on one framework only to have a quick feedback.. Just checked some stuff manually:\nDecoding ImageSharp-encoded Png-s seem to work correctly with all PngColorType-s after this change.. @JimBobSquarePants the answer to your question is here\nYou need to turn your instance methods into static methods accepting a pointer :(. But unlike in Block8x8F, you don't need casting in your table structs.\nWith a YCbCrToRgbTables* table you can use table->CrRTable[i]. @JimBobSquarePants it's never too late late to learn new stuff! :)\nHaven't tested it offline, but looks good to me now.\n. @JimBobSquarePants  It should be the same thing that happens with other tests involving SIMD. (Like my case with ColorVectorTransformTests yesterday.)\nI have a pretty long, and detailed TODO list regarding JpegDecoder. I also want to see this written down as an issue, so we can argue about the points/prioritize them/inform potential new contributors.. @FireNero thanks for the refactor help you done here!\nWe still need to implement that MemoryManager to provide more control over the ArrayPool behaviour, but it's not a Jpeg-specific task to implement it.\nIt would be nice to find people to help with the other (harder) points or the smaller issues from this list!. I started to work on the generic compression stuff. See:\n- PackedBuffer\n- CompressedBuffer\n- CompressedBufferTests\nMy plan is to store the JpegDecoderCore.DecodedBlocks in a CompressedBuffer when PerformanceCharacteristic == LowestMemory and use DummyPackedBuffer otherwise. The same could be done to jpeg image channels later.. Closing this in favor of #298.. If this issue is actually related to multithreading, I wonder if this workaround helps:\nC#\nif (IntPtr.Size == 4) // 32 bit process\n{\n    Configuration.Default.ParallelOptions.MaxDegreeOfParallelism = 1;\n}. My concerns here:\n- Isn't it possible to go without the PixelTransformMode enum? It violates the open/closed principle, thus extensibility: for a new pixel function we need to extend the enum touching the core library code.\n- The design could be changed in a way, that's much better in terms of performance, however it's a bigger refactor. @vpenades are you interested making those changes? If not, @JimBobSquarePants how should we manage yet another public API thing, that's slow by design?. Here is a proposal, that addresses both of my concerns above:\n```C#\npublic abstract class PixelTransform\n  where TBckPixel : IPixel\n  where TsrcPixel : IPixel\n{\n  public abstract TBckPixel Apply(TBckPixel backdrop, TsrcPixel source, float opacity);\ninternal virtual void BulkApply(BufferSpan backdrop, BufferSpan source, float opacity) \n  { \n    // default slow bulk implementation here\n  }\n}\npublic class PorterDuffSubstract : PixelTransform\n  where TBckPixel : IPixel\n  where TsrcPixel : IPixel\n{\n  public abstract TBckPixel  Apply(TBckPixel backdrop, TsrcPixel source, float opacity)\n  {\n    // ...\n  }\ninternal override void BulkApply(BufferSpan backdrop, BufferSpan source, float opacity)\n  {\n    // Optimized bulk implementation here\n  }\n}\n``. @JimBobSquarePants the base classesBulkApply()calls it's own abstractApply` for each pixel in the span.\nHowever this default implementation will be slow, because the Apply call won't be inlined here. That's why we need to override BulkApply in subclasses which will be boilderplate code actually, but run fast.\nThis pattern is very similar to BulkPixelOperations<T>.\nUPDATE: Made several edits.. @tocsoft I'm sceptical if it's possible to do this without hurting performance. (Actually 90% sure it isn't.) Off topic here, so let's continoue this discussion on gitter :). @vpenades you might be right that the perf is equivalent to a virtual call.\nThe problem is that when you are processing a large data stream like an image, you even can't afford a virtual call at per item (per pixel) level, because it will lead to frequent cache misses!\nWe need an inlined call here. \nI suggest you to also try this in your own work, it will be much faster! ;). @vpenades the work you've done is great, and it's really valuable! I'm sure we gonna merge it, we just want to refactor it a bit ;)\nUnless I'm missing something, my PixelTransform<T> proposal is basically equivalent to what you posted as RowBlender<T> in terms of performance, but it seems to be more flexible.\n~@JimBobSquarePants when we've argreed on the final pattern, we need to find the way to manage this refactor. Who's gonna do it? on which branch? etc.~\nNevermind, now I see @tocsoft is actually doing it.. @daveaglick Scripty is definitely in the category of projects I'd \u2764\ufe0f to work on. The .NET world needs better metaprogramming support!\nThe problem is that currently I'm struggling to keep on with my ImageSharp TODO-s :( Maybe in the next few months I'll have some time to pick something from your issue list \ud83d\ude04. Unfortunately the pixel type (Argb32) is a noise for most of the server-side users, however it should not be an issue, because people are usually going with var.\nWith a static, Argb32-specific Image class, the following code should keep compiling:\nC#\nusing (var image = Image.Load(\"foo.jpg\"))\n{\n    image.Resize(image.Width / 2, image.Height / 2)\n         .Save(\"bar.jpg\"); \n}\nPS: @JimBobSquarePants I know this is not your favorite argument, but still true \ud83d\ude04. Looks good now, thanks a lot @FireNero!\nHas anyone any concerns, or can I merge this now? @JimBobSquarePants?. @JimBobSquarePants needed to do a bit more refactor than I expected. Now it's your turn to review my changes!. I think I'm done here (unless someone finds a mistake).\nSpan<T> is now literally everywhere!. Also none of my web browsers can decode it (Chrome, Edge).\nI'd say, being able to decode this is a nice to have feature, but from our point of view it has a low priority.\n@xeora if you could help us by trying your code changes on our existing tests, and make a PR if it doesn't break them, that would be nice :). Cool, throwing an exception shouldn't be that hard. Running into an infinite loop is definitely a bug.. Well I have no .NET Core 2.0 installed, but I think I got it! We have a Span<T> on the heap by instantiating WeightsWindow[]! Looks like I violated the rule I keep bullying people with ^^ (But it was OK with BufferSpan<T>! :P)\nIt works with .NET core 1.1 because it lacks the runtime-provided native span.\nThe quickest workaround that comes into my mind:\nLet's pin WeightsBuffer.dataBuffer (Making use of Buffer2D<T>.Pin()), and let's turn WeightsWindow.Span into a pointer again. This should not affect performance.. @dlemstra I think implementing this feature as a decoder would be misleading to the users. It's a very special case.. > That would make it possible to read only the data of the red channel as a double (in bytes).\nThis can be solved by LoadFromPixelData (super fast) + a pixel type conversion call. I think this API is easier to understand, than exposing complicated DecoderOptions.. I'm not big fan of lazy solutions. Makes the lifecycle and program behaviour unpredictable. Eg: reading a pixel could trigger an expensive, multi-thread jpeg decoder execution ... brrr!\nI think MemoryManager + MMF should help us here. Can't wait for having the time to implement it ... :disappointed:\nStoring frames as encoded streams seems to be the ultimate solution for @TodesBrot's use-case, but it seems to be really complex, and needs lot of work. For me it looks like a 2.0 candidate feature ;) I wonder if we can prepare or API to provide such features in the future without breaking changes.. @TodesBrot I wonder if someone can investigate this, unfortunately there are no mobile developers in the current team AFAIK :( Is it possible to reproduce this on an emulator?. @mhamri it looks like duplicate of #151, but thanks for the detailed description of your use-case!\nThe memory usage drop from 4GB to 3GB is random, we haven't done actual improvements on this. I think it depends on the input images your service is processing. Do your inputs have a common characteristic? (eg: large photos). If yes, it might be helpful to post a few of them.\nImplementing #225 and certain points of #192 should help on this. Unfortunately both are big tasks, so we need your patience here.. It is ArrayPool. Pools large arrays in a shared (static) pool to reduce gc pressure and prevent LOH issues. We understand this is not the best behavior for many users though, so we want to make this configurable. . There might be an unexpected behavior (missing dispose calls?) that came with #210. Looks like we need to do a deeper investigation here. @JimBobSquarePants I think we really need to find a way to stress test the library with a larger test image pack. . @mhamri If you are still using ImageSharp, check out the beta, the Jpeg decoder uses much less memory now! Let me know if the situation is still critical for you!. @vpenades An MMF-based memory manager could achieve the same tradoff (running slower, but using less memory) in a more simple way.\nBTW there is a new property GCSettings.LargeObjectCompactionMode since 4.5.1 to address the LOH fragmentation issue.. @JulianRooze I plan to realize my roadmap in February, so it will be part of our 1.0 release or maybe even some beta. Is this late for you?\nThe only thing I can propose as a quickfix is is to add a temporal configuration API to control the behavior of PixelDataPool for beta-3:\nC#\n[Obsolete(\"This is a temporal API, use it for your own risk!\")]\npublic static class PoolConfiguration\n{\n    [Obsolete(\"This is a temporal API, use it for your own risk!\")]\n    public static int MaximumPooledBufferSizeInBytes { get; set; }\n}\n@JimBobSquarePants what do you think?. @vpenades \n\n[...] if not used, or the GC needs memory, these arrays would be reclaimed by the GC at some point\n\nThe GC runs quite frequently, which means that in this case the \"pooled\" arrays would be GC-d instaneously in most cases. This would go against the whole concept of pooling.\n@JimBobSquarePants an other (less dirty) proposal:\nBy lowering the value of MaximumExpectedImageSize we could ensure that those large outlier images do not eat up the memory of users with limited environments, while still having the pooling mechanism for more common smaller images.\n  . @vpenades you are totally right about the issues you pointed out! I share all your concerns and fixing up our internal memory management is my top priority as soon as I get back to work on ImageSharp in February!\nI just want to point out that having expensive resources retained by a pool for a longer period is just normal pooling behavior by definition. (Just have a look at other pooling mechanisms in the .NET framework. ThreadPools, connection pools etc.) So I disagree with your suggestions: having temporal \"pools\" is not pooling. It would hurt performance for the majority of our server users. (The vast majority of our user base!)\nThe big issue is that our pooling mechanism is not configurable at the moment, which makes the library to perform poorly in many scenarios, like yours. As I said, this is a top concern for me! I believe that solving this by providing generalized memory management is a very worthy strategy in long term, because it will enable cool features, big flexibility + integration with new Microsoft API-s & other libraries.. Re ArrayPool<T>.Shared:\nFor me it was clear from the beginning, that it's a design mistake :P We are not using it AFAIK. We concentrated all our \"Memory as a Resource\" logic into PixelDataPool and Buffer<T> classes, so it would be easier to refactor + customize this behavior library-wide.. @JulianRooze it's strange to see Jpeg decoder to still eat up that much. Are you using beta-2?. Btw. the logic in CalculateMaxArrayLength is totally stupid. Gonna replace it in a lightweight PR in a way that will also help on the jpeg decoder + Block8x8 issue.. @tocsoft @rytmis There are a few non-trivail limitations making it impossible to back everything with byte[] + single ArrayPool<byte> + unsafe cast:\n- Currently we need an API to extract, or mimick the extraction of a T[] array from IBuffer<T> ** because several API-s need it (SIMD, streams). Newer, Span<T> and Memory<T> based API-s are on the way, but not yet ready + unsupported in current .NET Framework versions. (Most likely it gonna be NETStandard 2.x). \n- So we need to work with arrays! If possible, without copying. How can we achieve the byte[] -> T[]conversion? Maybe this?\nC#\nbyte[] a = new byte[42];\nT[] b = Unsafe.As<T[]>(a);\nTried it, doesn't work! :( Would make SIMD and stream API-s to fail. (We actually had a SIMD + 32 bit VM related issue earlier because of this trick.)\n \"extract, or mimick the extraction\": With unmanaged memory buffers  we need to copy the bytes into an array + work + copy it back to the Span<T>. I have an idea to do this in a uniform safe way, but it's really tricky, gonna explain it later.. Actually .. we can probably make this work! Or at least if it's true that all our decoders read their data into temporal byte[] arrays, and we don't need that IBuffer<T> <-> Stream interop, we can get rid of all array usages, and go with Span<T> everywhere!\n@tocsoft @rytmis If you also think it's possible, than never mind my previous comment :). @JulianRooze @vpenades Yeah Memory<T> rocks!\nSpan<T> should be always constructed on the fly when returned from properties/methods, this way you can ensure its kept on stack. We have to be very careful in order to never store it as a member + never capture it by a lambda.\nThe official guide on perf-centric API-s:\n- Use Span<T> on synchronous API surfaces\n- Use Memory<T> on asynchronous ones\nThe problem is that the second one is not yet available in the official System.Memory beta package. This is exactly the reason why we removed all Span<T> API-s from our public API surface until it's released.. @vpenades I think you're really missing the concept of pooling. Lifecycle of a pool should be bound to session or application lifecycle. For per request object-reusing: I won't call it pooling.\nDon't get me wrong, we have several issues with our current implementation which are gonna be fixed with #431. I'm quite sure that in a server application, you don't need stuff like temporal \"pooling\" or disabling pools. Fine-tuning the parameters should be a knife sharp enough to allow optimizing your service throughput.\nI'm unsure however what's the deal on Xamarin. It's an entirely different runtime. But with #431 you will be able to implement your idea and use temporal pools for individual resizing requests! :). I think we need something like a MemoryManager.ReleaseAllRetainedResources() method for this :). @tocsoft do you have any concrete suggestions on implementing your MemoryUsageHint proposal with ArrayPoolMemoryManager ? I can't see any differences in the actual lifecycle for the Temporary/Process/Image cases.. I see, thanks!\nGood question if this model is future-proof enough however, because: \n1. In case of Memory Mapped Files it might be more efficient to read/write blocks into a temporal buffer, than use Span<T>-s pointing right into the MMF. I don't know however, because I'm not yet familiar with MMF-s.\n\nThis statement is not true IMO:\nWe will have a single long term retained buffer for all the image pixel buffer. \n\n\n\nIn most use cases (eg. thumbnail generation in stateless services), Image<T> is just as temporal as the Block8x8 buffers in the Jpeg decoder. And Block8x8 buffers are almost as large as the resulting Rgba32 buffer. It's hard to distinguish.. I've been also thinking on the Buffer<T>.Array topic.\nIt seems that we need it only in special cases, to interop with Stream API-s, which are always using byte[] across their full API surface. In these cases, MemoryManager must return a buffer backed by a managed byte array regardless of the MemoryManager implementation.\nI think we need a type-safe solution for this, distingushing temporal byte buffers from the rest of memory buffers:\n```C#\ninterface IBuffer : IDisposable \n{\n    ...\n}\ninterface IManagedByteBuffer : IBuffer\n{\n    byte[] Array { get; }\n}\ninterface IMemoryManager \n{\n    IBuffer Allocate(MemoryUsageHint hint, int size);\nIManagedByteBuffer AllocateManagedByteBuffer(int size); // always temporal!\n\n}\n```\n. @vpenades I would be more than happy to have a look at your experiments. Could be a good basis for benchmarks. Is it possible to pack your code into a standalone demo console app?. Looks cool! :) Reminds me Project Gemini a bit, but your focus is quite different.\nThe best thing is that it builds without issues for me! :) Let me know if you can share some code + reproduction steps which could be used to stress ImageSharp with mipmap generation.. @JulianRooze I think merging #436 should lead to very similar results, but in a future-proof way, with no temporal API-s.\n~Is your package on your own MyGet feed, or is it a public package on nuget.org? If it's on nuget.org, can you please remove it, and move it to MyGet? We are strongly against unofficial packages, because we have no control over them.~\nThe official solution is on the way, the official half-solution is going to be merged today!\n~Your input about this topic was really valuable and appreciated, it really helped me a lot to figure things out. I would be really happy, if we could find a solution inside the box, which is good for all parties! :)~. @JulianRooze sorry, stupid me, haven't noticed your link, need more \u2615\ufe0f. Nevermind my previous comment!. @vpenades it's definitely not worth for us to introduce breaking changes of this manner for 1.0.\nThere's nothing you won't be able to solve by using a custom Configuration instead of the default one. \n(edit: I mean one or more configuration instances.)\n\"Temporal pools\", releasing memory, isolation of multiple different memory managers in a single process - all possible. Gonna add docs and samples for these scenarios.. @GeorgePlotnikov even answering a few questions would be very helpful:\n- Do you use beta-2 or nightlies? If you work with beta, can you try nightlies, and report back? There was some improvement with #436!\n- Based on your screenshots, it looks to me that your app's memory consumption stops growing at 160MB. Is my understanding correct? Or have you just stopped stressing your application?\n- This is really not a classic \"memory leak\"! There is an optimization tradeoff: the more memory you allow to be taken (and \"never returned\") by ArrayPool-s, the less is the pressure on GC, increasing your applications throughput. In ideal case, this is how the memory consumption should grow with time in your app. What is the acceptable level of maximum retained memory for your application?\n\nIf you need some help with the implementation I can grab some.\n\nI want to finish this work before the end of the next week. If you really have some time to join in now, let me know, and I gonna break down the remaining work into smaller tasks. The more help I get from the community, the more time remains for me to work on #411 (documentation)! \ud83d\ude04 \n. For everyone's invormation:\nThe work started with #431 is now being continued on the feature/memory-manager branch.\nThis is the API I'm targeting currently:\n```C#\ninterface IBuffer : IDisposable \n{\n    Span Span { get; }\n    // No T[] is exposed!\n}\ninterface IManagedByteBuffer : IBuffer\n{\n    // Exposing an array to work with .NET API-s consuming byte[]\n    byte[] Array { get; }\n}\n// I suggest using an abstract class instead of an interface,\n// because I don't want to make the methods and IBuffer public at this point!\npublic abstract class MemoryManager\n{\n    // Let's keep the interface as narrow as possible! \n    // There will be shortcuts like AllocateClean() through extension methods.\n    internal abstract IBuffer Allocate(int size, bool clear)\n        where T : struct;\n// Mostly used by decoders working with streams.\ninternal abstract IManagedByteBuffer AllocateManagedByteBuffer(int size);\n\ninternal abstract void Release<T>(Buffer<T> buffer)\n    where T : struct;\n\npublic abstract void ReleaseAllRetainedResources();\n\n}\n```\n@tocsoft I suggest adding MemoryUsageHint later, when we are more familiar with specific solutions like unmanaged memory and MMF.. @vpenades \n\nMemory as a wrapper of Span , wouldn't IBuffer and IManagedByteBuffer be a redundancy of Memory??\n\nMemory<T> is not a wrapper of Span<T>. They are technically different views of the same thing. IBuffer<T> is the counterpart of OwnedMemory. I will consider switching to OwnedMemory as soon as it's on NuGet + I see more use cases & docs to understand it's reference counting logic better.\n\nWhat about mixing memory managers?\n\nI think it should be a goal to allow this, ~but not in the current iteration~. UPDATE: I was thinking of composite \"mixed\" memory managers. We should definitely investigate what happens if different memory managers are used, and interfere in the same process.\n\nI ask, because I've seen there's some \"SwapBuffers\" being used in some processors, so if the SwapBuffers swap memory created with distinct memory managers, it can lead to trying to release a buffer with the wrong manager.\n\nGood point, we need to check this behavior in processors, and define rules for buffer moving & ownership management. In some cases copying them might be inevitable.\n\nwill they use the memory manager associated with the \"current image\", or they will need a memory manager to be passed to them too?\n\nPassing a MemoryManager to Mutate() and Clone() could be a solution.\nThere are lots of tasks and concerns. In the current iteration I would like to focus on the absolute minimum listed in \"Tasks for Milestone 1.0\". Even implementing this takes more time than I expected. It is a deep codebase refactor and brings tons of seemingly unrelated tasks like #469.\nWe can add future points like Composite memory managers, or Memory<T> integration later in an iterative way through independent PR-s. As always, community contribution is welcome. If you feel some of those points are important, and urgent for your use case, feel free to grab them! \ud83d\ude04 . The situation is not that bad. I guess there is a solution evolving on my branch:\n- The method MemoryManager.Release() is gone now. IBuffer<T> implementations are now coupled to their MemoryManagers, containing their own dispose/release logic.\n- The swapping trick introduced by @tocsoft, is in fact coupled to owners of buffers, not the IBuffer<T> itself, and I'd like to keep it that way! (Buffer2D<T> is also a thin wrapper over IBuffer<T>, thus a buffer owner now.)\nLet me know if I'm wrong, but I think these rules are sufficient to keep buffer ownership logic safe, and prevent different MemoryManager instances from interfering with each other.. @vpenades the method you are looking for is Image.LoadPixelData<TPixel>(data, width, height)!\nLater, it will be also possible to wrap an existing memory area to be able to temporarily manage it as an \"Image\". Dispose() will have no effect in the case if memory ownership is external. This feature requires the availability of Memory<T>, so we can have a clean & standard API for that.\n. @GeorgePlotnikov thanks for the answers!\nCan you try if it's any better for you with the latest nightlies? Would be very helpful information for future fine-tuning tips!. Thanks! \nThat's still quite too much of memory being eaten up :(\nThe exception that ended your experiment might be a Jpeg bug ... or a totally corrupt \"jpeg\", that can't be loaded by any library. Can you share the file?. @vpenades It's not allowed to touch managed objects in a finalizer! It's only here to free up the unmanaged handles if the developer forgot to call Dispose().\nA developer should not rely on finalizers, you should properly manage the disposal of your objects.\n. Sorry, misunderstood your comment. It's a bug in my code! Gonna be fixed.. I'm almost done, a PR is coming soon.\nHowever .. I'm not yet happy. Based on the feedback in this + other threads, there is some strange behavior I haven't understood yet. \ud83d\udc7b The memory keeps growing for users even when I supposed it should stop doing so.\nWe need to do a proper load testing investigation before releasing beta-3!. I'm closing this epic, because it's 99% done. Individual issues like #650 should cover the rest.. What kind of stream do you need? One with a specific format? Or just raw pixel data? Also: Please use our gitter channel for questions!. @tocsoft I think we should extend these visual tests later to compare the output to a reference output instead (stored in a test image + reference image repostory / NuGet package). These updated tests should be executed on CI too. (This could have saved me from several bugs I made during my refactors.)\nEven without proper assertions these tests still cover some stuff, at least from making exception throwing bugs.. Everything looks good to me now!. Cool! This is basically corefxlab Buffer<T> logic now. Should not significantly regress performance.\nPushed a minor optimization + some clenup. Looks good to me now, but it could be wise to double check it.. @JimBobSquarePants yeah, but we should be honest to ourselves, and should not forget that this is not a fair comparison considering the throughput issues of parallel processing :)\nThis should not be demotivating however, we can make the situation much better!. Pushed another change that T4-s most of the Rgba32.PixelOperations. This way it will be easier to apply any refactors (eg signature changes) in the future.  It's enough to modify 6 method templates now instead of 22 methods with docs.\n@JimBobSquarePants RE ref Vector4: It doesn't look like it's worth it. \nOnly ~5% difference with Vector4-backed pixel types, no change for other ones. We should provide & use bulk implementations for these conversion methods anyways.. Thanks for fixing this! I really missed the multi-framework benchmarking feature.\nIt works for me on Windows with both core and clr 4.6.1!. @IldarKhayrutdinov there's no need for such formalities! :)\nFeel free to submit a PR, we will review, and most likely accept it (probably after a few change requests).. @devedse in the best case this might be caused by rounding inaccuracy in Block8x8F.CopyColorsTo(). Adding 0.5 before casting to bytes might help here.\nIn the worst case we need a deep refactor of the codebase to fix this; introducing an elegant management of Speed <-> Memory <-> Quality tradeoffs (see #192).. @devedse your feedback and investigation is really useful! \nI'm planning to have a deep dive back into the Jpeg decoder in ~4 weeks. I will start by analyzing and TDD-ing the IDCT + color conversion chain based on your observations.. @Inumedia we want to keep our public API as narrow as possible keeping our ability to change these internal utilities as our design evolves, so I don't think these API-s should be public. \nA possible change for MathF: A standard MathF class is coming, we should adapt it in the future.\nThese utilities are really thin, so you can easily include them into your project. If you are implementing a new pixel type you might also PR it into ImageSharp ;). @houseme-brandon looks like your doing a chain of unnecessary transformations on very large data buffers. Can you try CryptoStream to decode your base64 input, and feed the result stream to Image.Load() to avoid those allocations?. [ The example I found is not the best one, because it's writing the stream, you need to read it :) ]. @houseme-brandon have you any information about the typical sizes of the images you test your application with? Can you share some of them?\nAlso: can you try to attach a memory profiler to your application following these instructions, and share your results with us? (Make sure you choose \"Memory usage\" instead of CPU). It would be very helpful both for you and us! :). @houseme-brandon those are pretty large images! After a quick calculation, it seems that each 4032 x 3024 sized Image<Rgba32> would consume about 50MB after decompression! There is nothing to do about this, this is the cost of uncompressed in-memory representation of an RGBA image.\nWhat is the memory limit of your VM/app service? Also: Make sure you are running it in a 64 bit process. \nMy current assumption is that, our internal array pool is growing beyond your memory limit before getting into a balanced state when it stops growing.\nAs a first step, it would be nice to prove this. Unfortunately, the memory profile you posted doesn't help. We need something much more detailed, with information about the object graphs. VS memory profiler, or ReSharper memory profiler could do the job.. @alexsorokoletov are you using our nightlies? If not, can you try them? There was some improvement with #436.\nIf yous still have the crashes with the nightlies, can you help us by describing your use case? How many requests do you have before the crash? Are those large images outliers or typical?. https://www.myget.org/feed/sixlabors/package/nuget/SixLabors.ImageSharp. AFAIK, you can't do that currently. @JimBobSquarePants shouldn't we convert this into a feature request issue or open a new one? . @OskarKlintrot At the time ImageSharp get's RC, these libraries will be in an RC state as well. We are building a future-proof API with the newest netstandard/netcore toys, so this is a reasonable tradeoff. \"Being in preview\" is a transitive relation, so I don't see any problem with using preview packages in a preview library.\nI can only qute the disclaimer from our README.md:\n\nImageSharp has made excellent progress and contains many great features but is still considered by us to be in early stages (alpha). As such, we cannot support its use on production environments until the library reaches release candidate status.. Yeah gitter is our forum for initial feature discussions.\n\nA short answer though:\nYou can workaround this by reading your network/file stream into MemoryStream asynchronously, then pass it to Image.Load(). Our initial implementation would be the same, implementing fine-grain async stream processing in codecs is not a key priority at the moment. It's extremely hard for a format like jpeg, we need to make our  jpeg decoder faster & more memory friendly first.. ### Optimization (long term plan)\nAs far as I know integer type Vector<T> lacks SIMD support for operations as basic as multiplication. Just run this benchmark if you don't believe me :P\nI wonder if @mellinoe or someone else has an idea regarding Vector<short>, but I'm 90% sure, there is no easy win here. If we want a fast decoder we have no other options than following this plan:\n1. Modularizing the decoder (described in next point)\n2. Refactor the decoder to process the input MCU-by-MCU right into the TPixel[] output buffer instead of processing them into large intermediate \"pixel areas\".\n(-> radically reduced memory footprint)\n3. Migrate to floats. (-> speed up!)\nModularization (short term plan)\nAs far as I understand the Jpeg decoding process could be broken down to the following well defined main steps:\nStream processing logic:\n1.1.  Building up the huffman tables\nInput: The stream\nOutput: the HuffmanTables data structure.\n1.2. Decoding the content of the stream (scans) into 8x8 blocks based on the tables\nInput: The stream + HuffmanTables\nOutput: Decoded blocks.\nTransformation logic:\n\n\nApply IDCT on the blocks\nInput: A DCT encoded block\nOutput: A block of color values\n\n\nTransform YCbCr/Ycck/Cmyk etc. blocks into TPixel data\nInput: 1-3 blocks in jpeg color spaces\nOutput: A span of TPixel colors\n\n\nThe granularity for steps 1.2-3. should be one MCU/Block, so we can properly test + reorganize the code according to steps described in the optimization part.\nI think we should find a way to independently unit test these steps. For steps 2-3 this is relatively easy, I suggest to follow the \"Reference implementation\" approach I used with Block8x8F tests. In order to make step 3. testable we should clean up the LinearizeBlockData() logic. It's really hard to follow what's going on here. We should test the color transformation with reference implementations at block level. I will decribe this method better in a follow-up comment.\nModularizing + testing Step 1. is a bit harder though. As a first step, we should try to encapsulate the stream processing logic into a separate InputProcessor class decoupling it's logic from ScanDecoder.\nIt's worth to define a separate structure for integer blocks (Block8x8Int), it's more type-safe and makes it easier to replace it with Block8x8F.\nI know it's a hard job, but  I would be really happy to get help on this both from team members and new contributors.. ## Unit Testing\nThe concept\n\nA sample unit test following this concept. (Ok, it lacks the corner cases :stuck_out_tongue:)\nThe reference implementation lives in the Test project, does not get changed, and does not depend on the tested code, so if we know that the reference implementation is correct at the point when the test was implemented, we can assume it keeps it's correctness, so we can use it to cross-validate the actual implementation any time in the future.\nWith this approach we do not have to capture meaningless blobs of data, copying it to the code. The reference implementation produces validation data in a transparent way that actually makes sense. \nI prefer to implement these tests before doing any changes to the code. Well worth the efforts!\nPs.:\nI haven't read this concept in books, it was just a straightforward idea that came into my mind when I was about to optimize DCT & IDCT. So I did a quick sanity check now, by googling \"unit testing FFT\" which is a similar, but widely used mathematical method. The results show that I was not the only one to came to this conclusion, looks like the authors of a popular FFT library used a similar (but more sophisticated) approach.\nExample: Testing the YCbCr -> TPixel colorspace conversion\n\nInput: Random-generated Y, Cb and Cr blocks. (3 x Block8x8Int)\nOutput: Span<TPixel> of 64 color values.\nReference impl.: The simplest possible YCbCr->TPixel conversion code that operates on 3 input blocks and outputs Span<TPixel>. No optimizations, no LUT-s!\n\u0104ctual impl.: The related method in the decoder. *\n\n*Ooops ... looks like we don't have that method at the moment ... that's why I call this a modularization refactor :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: Good testing improves the code, and our understanding of the code as well! :guitar: We really need that logic to be understood and separated to enable future refactors.. @mellinoe this is a really useful piece of information, thank you! I'm already researching integer DCT algorithms.\n@JimBobSquarePants 1.-2. points of my plan are still valid though, and we need that coverage, modularity + cleaning up the LinearizeBlockData() stuff before starting any vectorization. Color transformations will be much faster with SIMD.. @JimBobSquarePants just found a standard-compliant IDCT reference implementation to test our code against.. Bad news ... looks like neither integer division, nor bit shifting is supported. @mellinoe can you confirm or deny this?\nI don't think it's possible to build efficient integer DCT and colorspace conversion algorithms without having at least bit shifting supported by SIMD.\n. For everyone's information:\nThe new decoder should be based on this port, because the stream parsing and the CPU-intensive processing logic is clearly separated here. This makes work on progressive jpeg-s easier. So good job @JimBobSquarePants, this decoder is a really-really good thing! (Despite it's messy and slow IDCT and colorspace transformation and logic, which has to be replaced :P)\nHowever, I suggest to open a new clean WIP PR, removing the noise we gathered here. I could describe my implementation plan there, and track the work. I also wiped the out the description in #192 to keep all information up-to-date.\nThere are some possibilities for incremental work. We can release our beta with the initial slow variant of the PdfJs decoder (if we find it good enough for a beta), and improve performance later. We need to keep all the classes of the original golang port in the repository though, to keep the useful logic and tests refactored as we add changes.\n@JimBobSquarePants thoughts?. @JimBobSquarePants I just merged jpeg-port into my jpeg-lab branch, organizing tests+classes+namespaces in a cleaner way. \nFor a while I'm planning to do refactors that keep both decoders working, so we can just merge back jpeg-lab into jpeg-port and use this (#274) PR for the switch-out process. . @JimBobSquarePants @tocsoft\nfinding a clean & maintainable solution for the double cloning issue seems really hard, I'm struggling since hours with no success. One thing seems pretty sure: the IImageProcessor<T> API has to be changed to manage the copying family of processors in a clean way.\nI don't think any of our users are implementing their own processors though, so probably a minor change on that API somewhere between the beta and the RC should not be an issue. Thoughts? :). @JimBobSquarePants @tocsoft tried to clarify the avatar example by adding some docs, comments + a variant, that does the trick without Apply().\n@JimBobSquarePants if you say that users who are not messed with 200 git changes+flu should understand all this, I believe you! :smile:\nEverything looks good to me now!. Here is the only problem left:\n- On one hand, we should merge this ASAP to unblock upcoming PR-s.\n- On the other hand: this is a big change, and we need to explain it to our users first, together with the reasons driving to this change. I'm afraid, we should write a blog post before merging.. :+1: Good thinking!. @deliotomaz this image is actually a BMP with an incorrect extension. Image.Load(\"PATH\") enforces to use the decoder that belongs to the given extension, so if you are not sure about it's correctness, use Image.Load(Stream) instead!\n@JimBobSquarePants should we close this issue, or should we invent some fancy logic for cases like this?. @JimBobSquarePants I think the expected behavior is not trivial, we have several options here:\n\nUse the decoder that belongs to the extension, throw if it's not correct (that's what we do now).\nIgnore the file extension, use the real decoder that belongs to the header. (What if the user actually does want to notice this?)\nThrow an exception that the format does not belong to the extension. (Maybe too paranoid.). @JimBobSquarePants what does .Select((f, i) => (f, i)) do in your sample code? Or is it just a typo?. @xakep139 nice job!\nI wonder if instead of having a dedicated DetectPixelSize() method, wouldn't it be better to introduce and return a PixelTypeInfo object instead? We could bridge it to our PixelFormats later.. @xakep139 no, the PixelTypeInfo thing is the only one, but we are releasing our first beta soon, which means that we need to be very strict defining our public API. I think we need to implement this with the PixelTypeInfo stuff now, because there is no chance to change it later.\n\n@JimBobSquarePants any suggestions to manage this?\n. @xakep139 thanks! (And also thanks for your patience!)\nSomeone has to refactor your work to the PixelTypeInfo style so we can merge it. I'll try to be that someone ...\nCan I push right to your branch?. @xakep139 Sorry for the late response! I gonna deal with this during my ImageSharp hackaton in Feburary. It could be related to #430, because we should probably use the same PixelFormatInfo class on both API-s.\nI would probably move the method DetectPixelType() into another interface to reduce API pollution, because not every IImageDecoder can implement it now:\n```C#\ninternal interface IPixelTypeDetector\n{\n    PixelTypeInfo DetectPixelType(Configuration configuration, Stream stream)\n}\npublic class PngDecoder : IImageDecoder, IPixelTypeDetector\n{\n   ...\n}\n```\n@JimBobSquarePants I really think this is a valuable feature, and we should merge this. Thoughts about my ideas?. Actually, I wanted to keep things as dumb as:\n```C#\npublic static class Image\n{\n    ...\npublic static bool TryDetectPixelType(Configuration config, Stream stream, out PixelTypeInfo pixelTypeInfo)\n{\n    IImageDecoder decoder = DiscoverDecoder(stream, Configuration config);\n    IPixelTypeDetector detector = decoder as IPixelTypeDetector;\n    if (detector == null) return false;\n    pixelTypeInfo = detector.DetectPixelType(config, stream);\n    return true;\n}\n\n...\n\n}\n```\nI'm afraid that going any further, and exposing IPixelTypeDetector publicly + registering it into Configuration really means starting the design of a public metadata API, which I think is outside the scope of this PR.. @denisivan0v thanks for joining in!\nI really hope we'll be able to figure out how to provide the feature you need. But let's start with a very important disclaimer:\nFor the ImageSharp team, maintaining a consistent & clean API has a higher priority than individual features! So expect us to be very strict at the review process.\nThe major issue is that ImageSharp has not been designed to support metadata-only scenarios. I understand however that many users need it, and I think it's worth for us to find a way for supporting them, so they don't have to look for other libraries. (@JimBobSquarePants do you agree?)\nHowever, to avoid the design lavine I foresee here, this feature set should be limited and/or isolated at this point, with future-proof API modifications only.\n. @devedse so these images should be identical if decoded with a correct PNG decoder?\nWe should add these tests to my new integration test suite, the current test architecture on master is not suitable for such reference image based tests. You have images \"1\" and \"2\". Which one should be considered as \"expected\" and which one as \"actual\"?. @devedse I'm closing this in favor of #301. We have some skipped failing tests indicating bugs in PNG decoder on the beta-1 branch. \nLet's see what will be the result with the rest of your images, when someone manages to fix these bugs!. @JimBobSquarePants hmm .. interesting approach. I thought we will just disable MyGet releases, and merge+review the PR-s one-by one, but OK, maybe we can speed up things a bit! :) There are several  issues though we need to deal with:\n1. Rightfully failing tests introduced by qa-lab indicating bugs (OilPaint, Png). What should we do with those?\n2. We need to find a good place for the external image repository. Currently it's under my personal account. I'd create a clean repository under SixLabors and just copy all the stuff here to make it smaller, by removing history. Can I go on with this?\n3. #298 was WIP, so I disabled some of the StyleCop rules, beacuse I don't want to document stuff that's gonna be eventually refactored after a few days (or hours). I need to re-enable it and fix the issues.\nAll in all: I know how to deal with (2)-(3), if I have the greenlight, I'll start working on this. I need your decision on (1).\nRe external images\nThey are pulled in with git submodules. This is basically ...\n\nThe main points:\n- You need to tell git explicitly to pull in the submodule repositories as well. In my client it's configured to automatically do the job. We probably need to extend the build code to make it work on CI as well.\n- A submodule reference contains a specific revision number, you need to explicitly update it.\nSoo .. it's quite similar to NuGet, but it's 100% git.. @tocsoft I think you are aware of this, but I need to emphasize: if you have big images in the history, git is gonna pull them in the future regardless of being deleted (git is all about changes..)\nSo what I would do is to:\n- Create an orphan branch in SixLabors/TestImages and copy the stuff here + delete the old master\n- Rename TestImages: The actual input images (\"TestImages\") are still kept in the ImageSharp repo after my QA work, to simplify adding new tests (without reference image assertions). The purpose of the external repository is actually \"Various kinds of external images\" (reference images, load test images etc.). That's why I named it Imagesharp.Tests.Images, but I'm open for better names.\n- OR: go the simple way, and create a new repository.\nThoughts?. @tocsoft \n1. No idea\n2. 48bpp png issue: should be a bug in PNG decoder in mono System.Drawing. The simplest workaround would be to ignore them if we detect mono. Will think on ways to implement this.\n+1: Should we keep the failing PNG tests failing, or shuld we Skip them for now?. The failing DitherTests indicated a bug. Skipped them for now together with the Png stuff. Opened #300 and #301.. Okkay guys, looks like I managed to green out everything.\nLet's have a quick last-minute API Review! This is our last chance to introduce breaking changes.\n@JimBobSquarePants a few comments on Dither API: \n- I think you should apply postfixes on Ditherer and ErrorDiffuser class names. We really should not have a class named just Ordered on our public API, even if it's nested deeply into other namespaces.\n- Is it OK to have the ditherers in SixLabors.ImageSharp.Dithering? Shouldn't they belong to SixLabors.ImageSharp.Processing.Dithering instead? They are used by an ImageProcessor as well.. @JimBobSquarePants bad news:\nI covered the progressive cases with reference images produced by ImageMagick, and discovered that the PDF.js decoder is actually significantly less accurate for progressive jpegs. \n3 of our tests are failing now, because the difference is above the 0.5% threshold I defined.. @JimBobSquarePants Re progressive Jpeg: \nI want to make sure this is the case. We need to define regression tests for the spectral data being produced by (PdfJs) JpegDecoderCore.ParseStream() as I described in #298. \nI want to use BitMiracle to produce the reference data, because their output seems to be correct. As far as I understand, we should expect exact equality at this point.. @JimBobSquarePants bad news again:\nLooks like the PdfJs port produces wrong results for progressive jpeg-s even before IDCT. Check out SpectralJpegTests.CompareSpectralResults() on the jpeg-lab branch. The verification data is produced by BitMiracle libjpeg.NET. I don't think the data is wrong, because the resulting image is much more similar to the libjpeg-turbo output.. @JimBobSquarePants it's up to you to decide which decoder is better for users in it's current state :) We can switch them again or even combine them later.\nHowever, I just realized, I can achieve the same low-memory two-pass behavior with the old one by reordering a few operations. Would be an easier start for me, if the spectral data is correct in the old one in the progressive case. \nFor PDF.js I think we need to verify if the original javascript implementation is correct for progressive images. It's easy to do with ImageComparer.Tolerant(0,0).. please, lets do the span api cleanup before we merge!\nsee gitter for my suggestion. . I mean my newest proposal: hiding everything including .GetPixelReference(), exposing GetPixelSpan() as an extension method. Or if we lack the time to find consensus, lets just hide everything for now, I can PR my idea later. . @tocsoft good job! The only problem I have with this is naming. The namespace should not be *.Whatever.Unsafe for two reasons:\n- Span is not unsafe! It's exactly the opposite: overflow errors avoided by bounds checnking + the CoreCLR 2.0 is actually guaranteeing 100% thread safety by throwing an exception on a heap capture of a span.\n- The the word Unsafe could still conflict with SRCS.Unsafe even if prefixed by Advanced..\nLet's just name it SixLabors.ImageSharp.Advanced or SixLabors.ImageSharp.Dangerous!. :+1:  cool! I take back my second *.Dangerous proposal anyways, because the word dangerous means a different thing in MS terminology. SixLabors.ImageSharp.Advanced is the best!. Pushed my YCbCr SIMD optimization right into beta-1. Benchmarked with unit tests for now, the speedup is significant.\nBefore:\n\nAfter:\n. Made some further decoder optimazation by optimizing PackFromVector4().\nMy current results are much better than yesterday. @JimBobSquarePants being keen of the results on your machine.. Woops ... that merge was accidental, thought I'm pushing to your branch @mormegil-cz :confused: \nAnyways I tried the code, and it worked and looked good to me, so hope you don't mind this @JimBobSquarePants. (AppVeyor failed to do it's job again though.)\n@mormegil-cz  thanks for your contribution, good job! :). @JimBobSquarePants that array is only 40 bytes in size, and it's allocated only once per decoder execution, doesn't worth to bother with pools and buffers in such cases.\nAlready merged this into #299. Another chance for AppVeyor to fight it's post-eclipse depression :P. @pammann-work Is this about assertions failing (and not Span-related exceptions and crashes) right?\nCan you do a favor for us, and try changing your test to use the image[x, y] indexer instead of row span? :)\nIf my assumptions are right right, this has nothing to do with Span<T>. It is a strange pixel-type conversion issue we experience on Linux. I'm quite sure we already had an open issue for this, but I was unable to find it. @JimBobSquarePants  @dlemstra do you remember which one is it?. Wait ... I just realized this issue has been opened in August. So .. this is the issue I was talking about. I need more cofee.. This has been most likely fixed by #591 (possible duplicate of #576).\nWe plan to expose .GetRowSpan() again soon (see #565). @KLuuKer this modularity is actually what I plan. Our users don't need to know about the backing IDCT algorithms. We can introduce something easy for them though, like:\nC#\npublic enum PerformanceMode\n{\n    Fast,\n    Accurate\n}. I'm closing this because there is nothing wrong with the accuracy of our IDCT implementation. All I needed to do was this.\nInaccurate is the new accurate!. @larssb I think it's the Sandbox46 project. It's a special profiling project, you don't need it to produce a build.\nDoes removing it from the solution help?\nAlso try removing ImageSharp.Benchmarks as well!. Shouldn't we merge this right into beta-1 and add new PNG tests together with the images from #313 #314?. @hasanayan this is default ArrayPool behaviour. The pools are retaining the arrays for future reuse. This will actually result in more optimal memory usage and better performance. We had several discussions on the pros and contras regarding this topic (see #123 #151 #224). If this is really an issue for you, #225 should provide a solution.. @JimBobSquarePants I think we should keep our stuff sealed. People should  follow practices like composition over inheritance for these cases like integral images.. Everything LGTM except the mutable ImageFrameCollection API. It's much easier to maintain a consistent Image<T> state if we close down that list.. We are really short on time, so OK for now.\nIn long term I'm planning to suggest deep changes to the frame API, because I'm not happy with the  \"greatest common divisor\" approach we used to pick the gif model as an universal model for Image<TPixel>.\nHope we can go for an early 2.0 .... @ahsonkhan the main reason is that the copy implementation of slow span did not look optimized when we added Span to the library. However, it looks promising now, so we may revise this, but it means we need to invest time into doing benchmarks.\nOne thing is sure: Buffer.MemoryCopy() - which drives our current copy implementation - is really fast for large buffers.. TBH - after having a second look - I think even the current (slow) Span<T>.CopyTo() implementation won't outperform Buffer.MemoryCopy().. @ahsonkhan great benchmarks! \ud83d\udc4d And thanks for taking the time for reviewing our stuff! \ud83d\ude04\nI believe a cross platform library should be fast on old platforms as well, so I think we should not depend on Fast Span only perf features. This makes SpanHelper.Copy stay for a while, because it's still faster for small to mid sizes.\nRe additional count argument: it's just an occasional result of our PixelOperations design, there's no need for that argument in a generic copy method.. @tocsoft I don't think GetPixelReference(x, y) is useful as a general pixel manipulator API. It's actually a false promise to users who want fast pixel access, because it's still applying the y*Width multiplication for each call. I think we should remove this method to have a cleaner API in long term. People who need fast pixel access in safe ways should use the Span<T> and Memory<T> methods in the future.\nWhat we need now is a simple method for users who want to go unsafe and do pointer arithmetic with SRCS.Unsafe() or by pinning the buffer. I think this is what @mellinoe needs. For this purpose having something like a .DangerousGetPinnableReferenceToPixelBuffer() extension method is much cleaner. (Less verbose name proposals: GetReferenceToFirstPixel() or GetReferenceToPixelBuffer()). @tocsoft but why do you need ref access to all/random pixels? I can't imagine any real-life use case utilizing ref locals for any other reason than performance.. Modified + extended the docs on DangerousGetPinnableReferenceToPixelBuffer giving the user some info on the underlying buffer.\n\nSuch a reference [...] must never be dereferenced.\n\nThis would be only true, if the image had 0 pixels, which is not allowed.\nEverything looks good to me now, but agree with @mellinoe, a test might be useful. I think it's totally fine to use Unsafe.CopyBlock() + an array in the tests, no need to create an unsafe buffer.\nShould we add the test in this PR?. Thanks @mellinoe!\n@tocsoft I think we need to expose a TPixel[] equivalent of this method. Would be wise to add it to this PR.\nGonna do it today, and I think we can merge this afterwards.. Wait, I found a serious issue!\nThere would be a name collision for users using both:\nSixLabors.ImageSharp.ImageExtensions\nSixLabors.ImageSharp.Advanced.ImageExtensions\nLet's rename the second one! What should it be? AdvancedImageExtensions?. Changes in progress ... will also polish the test cases a bit.. Done!\nI know we are in beta now, but shouldn't we rename this method?\nI think that the zero-argument SavePixelData() overload should return TPixel[] instead of byte[]!. You might be right, let's keep the current names then! \nEverything LGTM for me now.. Like the API-s and the naming! . @JimBobSquarePants I think you have this feeling because all of them are returning an Image<T> instance. This makes them more bound to Image<T> than ImageFrameCollection<T> where everything operates on frame instances only.. @tocsoft All LGTM. Like that we manage the lifecycle of frames through our API now, preserving valid state for Image<T>.\nWe probably need a gif manipulator example, because the behavior of some functions (eg. AddFrame(otherFrame)) is not trivial now.. @JimBobSquarePants some good points to start:\n- An online toy to play with the bits of an IEEE-754 single precision float\n- The Wikipedia article for Float32\nTBH I haven't took the time to understand FastRound yet. For me, the only way is to take a pen, a paper + at least a half free hour to play with the bits.. @JimBobSquarePants just noticed your update. What test have you been running to spot the allocations?. But they weren't there in our previous benchmarks, and the regression is quite dramatic.\nIt must have been introduced by #344 then. @tocsoft any idea?. Everything looks good now but there is one thing I miss very much: \nWe should add proper test cases to ensure we actually can detect the header markers. (Exif, JFif, Icc, Adobe). What we currently have is very limited and doesn't really help us keeping our code correct while doing refactors.\n@JimBobSquarePants you look to understand this stuff well now, you probably know what we should assert for to have a better coverage. I think it's worth to do it in this PR.. @JimBobSquarePants actually, I was thinking about integration-like tests:\nSomething like parsing image streams in MetaDataOnly mode, and asserting that the information in the headers is correctly fetched. We have something for Exif & JFif, but the rest is at 0% coverage AFAIK. \nThis stuff is less trivial, but this is exactly why we need it much more!\nMaybe there is some implicit coverage caused by having some test images with Icc and Adobe markers properly color processed because we can correctly read the headers, but I think it's time to make it explicit, defining [Fact]-s saying \"we can process this/that header\".. @JimBobSquarePants  I'm not talking about full Exif & ICC metadata parsing tests. What we need to do in the Jpeg test code is to ensure that we can detect the profile, and run the necessary initialization blocks for a given input stream.\nI do not agree that your new tests are good enough for this, because ProfileResolver.IsProfile() is just very small and quite trivial part of the logic.  There is a lot more stuff happening around it which is much easier to break: reading the necessary amount of bytes, skipping bytes etc.\nWhat we need to do:\n- Pick an image for each of the application headers (Exif, JFif, ICC, Adobe)\n- Run JpegDecoderCore with MetaDataOnly == true (to exclude the stuff that's not needed for these tests)\n- Ensure that the critical internal JpegDecoderCore properties (indicating we have read the markers) are correctly set\nThis is critical for having a correct coverage for the code you refactored now + Developing these tests by itself can help us evolving towards a better & more testable design.. @JimBobSquarePants I am testing internals (classes, structs, properties, sometimes fields) all the way in Jpeg & all our other internal utils and I'm on the strong opinion that it's worth all the tradeoffs! \nFor code with complicated internal logic & narrow public API (like Jpeg) black box testing is exactly the opposite of TDD. And I believe that TDD brings a huge value into our codebase by \n- Helping to keep our code correct between refactors \n- Pushing it towards modularity \n- Better maintainability\n- Reduced number of bugs.\nIt means that we should aim for White-box testing indicating that we should not be afraid to expose internals to tests. Everything that's important enough to be tested independently should be made internal and tested! It's a \"by design\" characteristic of white-box testing.. @JimBobSquarePants in ideal case you are right, but you need to take into consideration the following points which make things really different:\n- This is mostly ported code\n- The time/timing factor\nIt's just impossible to turn these ported monsters into proper modular code in a few commits, not even in a few PR-s. What we can do is to cover them as they are, and use this coverage to support our current and future refactoring. With time, not only our code gets better but also our tests.\nThe result is the same: better, modular, and tested code, but I believe that the road leading here is less painful with the test-first approach. Actually: based on my previous Jpeg experience, it depends on our testing strategy if we ever get here!\nIn this particular case the most important is to test if the outcome of the ProcessApp1Marker, ProcessApp2Marker etc. functions is correct (the proper marker/profile data is initialized). To move these methods into independent modules you need to do lots of error prone refactors.\nWhy not adding the tests before all the refactors that bring bugs into our code?. Haven't read this book yet, but I beleive this is the game we play here, and I'm sure it has a bit different winning strategy than the one when you develop modular components from scratch.. @JimBobSquarePants good job, it's much better now! I like that now we have modular stuff that can be used by both PdfJsPort and GoLangPort decoders.\nI see further possibilities to improve both the code and the tests though (the coverage of Process****Marker methods is still implicit), but we can fix this later. For mow everything LGTM.. @tocsoft is it intentional that we still have the samples in this repository?\nWe should probably merge this, and move every example project to SixLabors/Samples afterwards.. @caetanator can you provide test images for the header types you implemented? . @caetanator my previous comment (regarding test images) became outdated, so I'm pasting it here:\nWe have these unit tests to test the BMP decoder. We need to add all test images covering the new headers to our test image suite to tests/Images/Input/*.\nUnfortunately we need to make sure the images are not too big before pushing them. Can you share the links to your test images so I can have a look?. @prw56 are you sure you're using Mutate/Clone properly? Have you read this blogpost? . @JimBobSquarePants it's possible to simdify it. We need to eliminate this if by splitting the loop into 2 loops first.\nAn untrivial if inside a loop has a very bad effect on CPU pipelines + branch prediction, so I expect significant speedup from removing it.. Wonder if we can find a way to regression-test gif encoding. ImageSharp Encoder VS ImageSharp decoder as a start?. @JimBobSquarePants I really want to review this, but I'm being short on time now. Do we still have a few days for this, or do you want to go fast because of beta-2?. Also, I'm copying my gitter comment here, because it's relevant:\n\nshouldn't we add 300x300-c.gif to our test images?. :+1: definitely better! . @jsfeldman what is your OS + .NET Framework version to run ImageSharp?. > I believe I was using Safari 10 [...]\n\n@jsfeldman I mean the OS you use to run dotnet to read the image, not the software you use to save it. I can't find this information in your report.\nSomeone reported a similar issue on our gitter channel, and I have a suspicion that the issue is specific to Unix-based systems.\nPlease don't close the issue :) We need to find out if it's ImageSharp-related.\n  . @JimBobSquarePants you may forgot to push your changes to ImageSharp.Tests.Images. The last commit is still mine on that repo.\nI don't know how it works with GH Desktop, but I usually enter the submodule dir, commit + push changes before updating & pushing the main repo.. @Lapinou42 @JimBobSquarePants \nI think the AOT compiler somehow fails to discover, that on this execution path it has to compile Unsafe.Add<T>(ref T, int) with byte as a generic argument.\nIt's definitely an issue with the Xamarin/mono AOT compiler. I will try to find out where is the official place to post issues for them.\nMeanwhile an amateurish workaround idea:\nTry doing a dummy Unsafe.Add<byte>(ref byte, int) call somewhere around the entry point of your application. I hope, it will make it to AOT compile the method for the whole app. I'm not familiar with Xamarin, but you probably can achive the same with linker.xml.. @Lapinou42 thanks for opening the issue on Xamarin Bugzilla! I also posted a comment, hope it helps.\nI suppose, the workaround does not work, because the Unsafe.Add method is AggressiveInlined.. @Lapinou42 I've noticed your latest comment on Bugzilla. Regarding this comment:\n\nWe noticed it's very slow on both side (iOS / Android) when we need to convert from Image to native image object.\n\nI'm being curious about your native image pixel format, and how do you implement conversion from Image<Rgba32> to native image objects? :). @Lapinou42 the NSImage.AsJpeg() -> ImageSharp jpeg decoding step seems unnecessary. \nIf you are familiar with the underlying UIImage + CGImage  + CGContext... API-s, you can try extracting the pixel data into a byte[] array of Rgba32 format or into an Rgba32[] array directly. Then you can use our Image.LoadPixelData<Rgba32>(data) to construct an ImageSharp image in a more efficient way.\nUsing .AsPNG() should be also faster. Jpeg is a super expensive stuff if your .NET runtime doesnt support SIMD.. @JimBobSquarePants yeah, everything looks fine for me for now. \nHowever that ditherer code could be optimized a lot later. Being curious: do we have (at least integration) tests for it now?. @JimBobSquarePants Just pushed a modification so RotateWithSampler is executed with all known resamplers + a single angle.\nBy scrolling through the result files you can notice a \"shape shifting\" behavior, that seems strange to me. Is this the expected behavior of the resamplers?. @JimBobSquarePants I compared our results to ImageMagick output I think there are some inaccuracies (which were there before this PR as well).\nImageMagick output (with Paeth filter):\n\nOur output with NearestNeighbour filter (same as the parameterless rotation before this PR):\n\nOur output with Triangle filter:\n\nConclusions:\n\nOur output dimensions are inaccurate. The right corner of the pattern is bitten off the screen.\nIt looks like there is an unnecessary global translation applied to our output.\nImageMagick output looks much smoother compared to all our filters. Is it because the Paeth filter?. Awesome! :) Gonna review this tonight!. Pushed my changes to TransformTests, haven't played with ImageMagick yet. \n@JimBobSquarePants maybe not that important, but looks like there are artifacts with Lancos5 & Lancos8. If we can't figure it out now, for me it is OK to put them on our known issues list. (Or maybe it's actually the result of the resampler logic.). @JimBobSquarePants I didn't mean to use ImageMagick output as reference, I just want to manually compare it to ours before moving on.. @JimBobSquarePants now I understand why are ImageMagick dimensions larger: they extend the image with the resampling radius to keep the resampled (blurred) edge pixels on the image. We are currently cropping those 1-3 pixels when rotating an image that has \"significant\" parts on corners.\n\nI wonder if there are users who will need this, or this something that won't be noticed by anyone ever?. @JimBobSquarePants I'm also trying to investigate this. Managed to define a failing test with a 5x5 full white image. Should I push it now?\nMy suspicion is that we are sampling some virtual black pixels from the \"outer space\".. @JimBobSquarePants @tocsoft @dlemstra and anyone reading this:\nHere is the final dilemma to answer about our TransformProcessor + affine matrix rules:\nLooks we are using a pixel origin convention based on image center (w/2, h/2). (Eg. a rotation matrix will rotate around the center of the image (after an automatic translation to the center)). Are we sure this what most \"bring your own matrix\" users want? ImageMagick affine transforms are based at the top left corner as far as I understand. Looks like OpenCV works the same way. It might be less intuitive, but it is more correct mathematically IMO, and I think users working with Matrix3x2 should be able to do their math.\nThoughts?. @JimBobSquarePants finally did some progress with my output verification point, and looks like I found a few minor issues. Reproduction: run the test cases doing 50deg rotation without rescaling or translating the image.\n\n\nWhen no destination rectangle is specified, the calculated one has an ad-hoc clipping on the left + padding on the right:\n\nI think it should fit the image into the transformed input rectangle when rectangle is not specified by the user.\n\n\nWhen drawing the image into the same rectangle, there is a minor 1px offset compared to the ImageMagick output:\n\n\nDoesn't look like a big issue, but I think at this point we should have our output as correct as possible in order to have good regression testing introduced.\nThe ImageMagick output was produced with the following command:\nmagick convert Orig.png -matte -virtual-pixel Transparent -distort AffineProjection 0.6427876,0.7660444,-0.7660444,0.6427876,0,0 Rot50Magick.png\n@dlemstra can you confirm whether I'm using ImageMagick correctly? The matrix is exactly the same we produce in the Matrix3x2 m = rotate * scale * translate; line.. > When no rectangle is passed to the freeform transforms the processor will use the source value\n\n\nThis makes the most sense to me as well!\n\nI don't know If I'm bothered by this. I'm confident in my maths so far.\n\nI went on producing test cases, and I'm quite sure now that the ImageMagick output is correct and somehow our result has an unnecessary (+1, 0) offset. Can't spot the issue in the code however, and it's late now. Will keep hunting tomorrow.. @JimBobSquarePants pushed a better test case for this: Transform_RotateScale_ManuallyCentered\nOriginal:\n\nImageMagick:\n\nImageSharp:\n\nNot sure if the x error is 1px, migh be actually a sup-pixel value (0.5?).. @JimBobSquarePants I think we can mark our output correct then, good news!\nTonight I gonna do my final review on tests + push the reference images.. @JimBobSquarePants just pushed some new test cases, and it looks like there are issues with the  rectangle parameter on TransformProcessor, or at least I would expect a different behavior.\nThere is a test case trying to define the target rectangle with a negative origo (-5, -5). I expect this virtual position to be the origo of the transformed new image, so a (+5,+5) translation should be applied to the result, but there is no such translation.\nI would find it very useful to define such virtual viewports:\nit can handle the situations where a transform moves parts of an image to negative coordinates without applying an additional translation to my affine transform.. @JimBobSquarePants pushed another case for Transform_IntoRectangle. With an origin of (5,0) and dimensions of W=5,H=10 I expect to keep the right part of the transformed shape, not the left one. Currently the result for this case is the same as the result for (0,0) + W=5,H=10. This means that the rectangle origin is an ignored information, which makes no sense to me. \nA possible solution:\n- We should replace targetRectangle with Size targetDimensions in AffineProcessor<T>, the Rectangle parameter in the extension method should be also replaced with a Size.\n- We can define an additional extension method that takes a Rectangle and applies a Matrix3x2.CreateTranslation(-rectangle.Location) to the matrix. This variant should behave the way I expect from the current one.. @JimBobSquarePants okkay, here's a better explanation!\nLet's say we have the following input image of dimensions 200x100:\n\nI'm going to apply the following transformation logic:\nC#\nvar m = Matrix4x4.CreateScale(2.0, 1.0);\nvar rectangle = new Rectangle(100, 0, 100, 100);\nimage.Mutate(i => i.Transform(m, KnownResamplers.Spline, rectangle))\nAnd here is my point:\n\nGonna push the fix right into this PR, just need your approval :). @fdncred unfortunately, it's not possible to define pixel types with size below 1byte with our current architecture. We may consider it for 2.0.\nMay I ask you about your use case and goal? Maybe there is a workaround for you :). I mean: a custom pixel type with bi-level behavior (but 8bpp physical memory density) might be good enough for you.. If your primary goal is processing speed, those 8-32bpp pixel formats perform better usually, because you have to run cheaper packing/unpacking operations.\nI'm not saying that it's impossible to do those processing operations efficiently with 1bpp, but it's really hard, and it is a very specific area. Our engine is usually packing/unpacking pixel rows into Vector4 (_m128) blocks before doing the processing work. This way we can keep our code accurate, relatively fast (SIMD-optimized), but still readable.. @JimBobSquarePants I had the same idea. @dlemstra I added a test-case for this in #397.. @JimBobSquarePants for me it feels much simpler to maintain a single repo for all the docs.\nI think we should host manual and generated documentations on the same site. (Just as Velrid docs do.). @JimBobSquarePants just made the output images smaller + grouped the output of all filter test classes into a subfolder. If you are happy with the results, I think we can push them to the reference images repository. Note: There is no need for reference images for the ******InBox variants,. How did I enable StyleCop for ImageSharp.Tests? :scream: . OK, it was just a small issue in the ImageSharp project.. Managed to provide proper coverage from only 35.6 KB of test images!\nIt's really not hard to add these tests now, would be nice if we could add this to the list of responsibilities of PR openers. Can I somehow help to turn this into a rule? Maybe we need an official testing guide + batch scripts to copy images?. @JimBobSquarePants Looks like there are numeric (or reference decoder?) errors under Linux, resulting in small differences between the calculated and the expected images, causing the travis build to fail. The hacky stuff you see is a workaround by introducing a relatively higher threshold when detecting Linux.\nThe trick is ugly and complicated, so I gonna undo it, and skip the CompareToReferenceOutput() step on Linux instead. Having the verification done on appveyor-only should be enough to catch regressions.\nThe reference output is the copy of our own, but in order to allow changes in the implementation, we should always use a (very small) tolerance when testing floating point algorithms.. Does it look better now? :). Only Windows + GDI based decoders seem do decode it properly. I consider this issue as low-priority one, definitely not a show-stopper for V 1.0.. @ambroselittle we have a few sample projects in a separate repository, but yeah that's not well visible.. note to self, but might be interesting to others until the information is actually available in our docs\nMy gitter comment explaining difference between System.Drawing.Imaging.PixelFormat and our pixel types.\n\nBoth Span<T> and our Image<T> are strongly typed (the pixel type should be known at compile time), while System.Drawing (and I guess also Accord.Net) exposes a raw untyped void* buffer through BitmapData, and provide a PixelFormat enumeration which is runtime data. Currently we do not provide out of the box interop helpers to bridge the two, you need to figure out it yourself.\nBgra32 (thus Image<Bgra32>) is the counterpart of PixelFormat.Format32bppArgb which is the default AFAIK\nHere is an example that wraps the raw memory data of System.Drawing.Bitmap as an Image<Bgra32>, without copying it, but this is rather advanced System.Memory stuff, you need to figure out how Memory<T> and MemoryManager<T> works.. @tachyon1337 looks like you are the maintainer of the package in question. We have regular issues because people are downloading your package by mistake. (See: #425 #422)\n\nIt was an early & unstable version of our library. Since then, we improved our implementation a lot, and our API went under a significant change. Keeping the alpha package online is really unprofessional, and it hurts everyone.\nIs it possible to take it down for the best of the users? We already tried to reach you using official channels AFAIK.. @dlemstra can you confirm if this change is correct and we should merge it?\n@musukvl can you sign the CLA so we can merge the change? :)\n\nAlexey Ryazhskikh seems not to be a GitHub user. \n\nI don't understand why does CLAassistant claim this :(\n/cc @JimBobSquarePants @tocsoft \n. @vpenades we need to do a performance review of these API-s before turning them public. This issue is very similar to #381.\n@JimBobSquarePants should we add this on our 1.0 milestone?. The current state of the PixelBlender API looks good an future-proof to me, so I think we can manage this for RC1 or 1.0.. PixelBlender<T> is a very thin and clean API now, introducing stuff like delgates would just make it worse. We can consider introducing an IPixelBlender<T> interface, but I see no benefit from this. There abstract classes across the whold .NET framework (ArrayPool<T>, Stream etc.) as well as the SixLabors libraries (MemoryAllocator) without having a base interface, and it seems much simpler to me.\nTo allow passing a pixel blender to GraphicsOptions, we need to introduce some kind of factory mechanism (IPixelBlenderFactory with a .CreatePixelBlender<T>(colorBlendingMode, alphaCompositionMode) method ?), but this is not a trivial design job, so I would remove (3) from the scope of this proposal.  We can deal with that concern later.. @vpenades interesting proposal, but really not easy to implement because of the cross-library architectural impact it brings. Might be a candidate feature for 2.0, but with our current focus, I'm afraid it's a bit off the radar, unless someone from the community takes care of it.\nBut we really want to hear the voice of the users, so anyone else having interest in this, please vote/leave your comments! :). It probably also affects drawing.. Supporting tiling would mean to me that we need to support \"cross boundary\" drawing in a way like this:\n\nBlack lines represent image the boundary, the green hearth represents a single shape drawn by ImageSharp.Drawing.\nI view this as a complex feature set based on managing virtual coordinate systems.. @vpenades I agree that we should introduce a base interface.\nHowever, exposing anything over Width, Height and MetaData brings non-trivial API design questions. For example PixelType should be a PixelTypeInfo instead of System.Type (see #292).\nRegarding the indexer in your proposed IImage<TPixel> interface:\nIt will perform very poorly, because of the per-pixel virtual calls. I'd rather wait for System.Memory becoming official before exposing new pixel-manipulation API-s.\n@JimBobSquarePants @tocsoft thoughts? Should we add IImage in 1.0?\nI'm voting yes :). @JimBobSquarePants check out #225 and Gitter conversations if you want (+have some time) to keep track of this! :). @vpenades\nre: different memory usage scenarios\nThe hard part is the context-bound automatical release of pools after each operation, but maybe we can figure this out. It's very easy however to provide a safe API for manual release of these resources: \nWhen you are finished with all the image manipulation work, you can just call MemoryManager.Default.ReleaseRetainedResources(). (It should not affect images/buffers being in use.)\nre: MemoryManager consistence:\n\nWhat happens if you switch memory manager on the fly, when you've already allocated images, or worse, when there's some asynchronous background image processing running.\n\nMy suggestion (could work with both Configuration.Default and user-managed Configuration-s:\n```C#\npublic class Configuration\n{\n    ...\npublic IMemoryManager MemoryManager \n{\n    get { return this.memoryManager; } \n    set \n    { \n        if (this.memoryManager.IsTouched) throw new InvalidOperationException();\n        this.memoryManager = value;\n    }\n}\n\n}\n```\n. @vpenades your scenario is exactly the reason why usin Configuration.Default is not mandatory at all! You can have as many instances of the Configuration object, thus MemoryManager as you want. Just make sure, you use the proper Image.Load(configuration, etc ...) overloads.\nIf it was only up to me to decide, I would maybe even drop the singleton, because I consider it an antipattern, but it would complicate the API, thus raise the barrier of entry for new users.. Calling Configuration.Default.MemoryManager.Anything() was only demonstrational in my examples. You can operate on the Configuration/MemoryManager instance of your choice.. Hey @rytmis! Do you have interest/time to continue working on this?\nIf you can't make it, I'd prefer pulling your work into a separate branch, finish it there, and open a new PR in the end.\nGonna have time for this in the middle of the next week.. You already helped a lot, thanks!\nI have some time, so I'll grab it from now then. In order to stick to my personal plans I need to finish it before the end of the next week. Probably gonna ask for some input.\nDon't talk nonsense about your skills, you're doing cool stuff according to your blog and GH contribution history! \ud83d\ude04. Closed this in favor of #475. @Latency I'm not able to build your project, half of the solution is reported being missing. \nInstalling and using ImageSharp in an empty 4.7.1 project works perfectly for me! Have you tried cleaning/reinstalling your NuGet stuff?. @Latency your bundled solution works perfectly for me! (Image.Load() is being called without problems.) Looks like the problem is related to your environment. Might be a .NET Framework / .NET Standard issue. I suggest to ask for help on Microsoft forums.\nPlease check out our latest comments on gitter and #434! We are not going to accept your PR-s.. @rytmis good experiment and useful calculations! Gonna reduce maxArraysPerBucket, but I think, in usual cases it is very unlikely to get even close to those theoretical limits, specially with the largest 32MB buckets.\nI'm also unsure about my math, but if your service is kinda stateless (so buffers are always returned to the pool when a request is finished), you need to stress your application in a way so it reaches a maximum peek of ~10 concurrent ~4000x2000 sized image uploads to approach the 50% ArrayPool fill factor.\nFor me it feels that if this is a realistic scenario in your environment then:\n- It is very likely that your gonna experience memory issues even without ArrayPool because of LOH fragmentation: The .NET GC has not been designed to follow such a stress.\n- For image processing applications, you should really consider using a less limited container, or use load balancing techniques to reduce the load of your individual containers, regardless of the image processing framework you use.\nBut instead of guessing, I really want to model this by defining proper load testing benchmarks. It's not easy for me to design them to be realistic, so any input and review would be really appreciated!. @rytmis I think you really need outliers of size >128MB to reach that 1.5 GB peek. Now that the maximum pool size is reduced significantly (while still covering typical image sizes), I expect your application's memory usage to be stabilized at much lower levels.\nWhether ArrayPool is good for imaging or not:\nI'm on the strong opinion, that there always exists an L > 0 upper limit for the pool size which leads to better throughput with pooling enabled than without it. In practice, the memory used by the pool should stop growing after a certain number of requests, way beyond it's theoretical limit:\n(updated graph)\n\nI'm quite sure I will be able proove this later with benchmarks.\nThis limit might be lower for certain applications + scenarios, pretty high for others, but never zero, if you optimize for throughput. It's really unfortunate, that bugs we made in ImageSharp (+lack of possibility to customize stuff) led to a debate on ArrayPools with those strong counter-opinions :disappointed: If you are using ASP.NET MVC, you already have ArrayPools in your application!. @vpenades totally understand it. You'll be able to implent this kind of logict after merging #431.. @rytmis pushed a change based on your observations. Gonna adapt this logic in #431.. I'm merging this now. If anyone is about to try our next nightlies because of this change: your feedback is really appreciated.. Gonna have look at this in February. I also want to setup CI with Mono.. I wonder if we actually need the Linux component to reproduce the issue? Isn't just Mono + Windows enough?. @dlemstra what version of mono have you tried? You need at least 5.2.0 as far as I understand.. But ... earlier versions should be able to run .NET Standard 1.*\nNot easy to figure this out :(. We can add hints and remarks in docs, and maybe in exception messages when we fail to recognize the header.. LGTM + works locally for me.. All looks good to me!\nWish I could find ways to significantly optimize Premultiply() by batching + SIMD, but at first glance, failed to figure out anything worth to give a try. We need vector element shuffling intrinsics for that, currently not available in .NET vector API-s.. @molinch what version of System.Memory does does your project refer to? It's current (4.5) API is not backwards compatible with the previous 4.4 preview.\nI assume your project is referencing the 4.5 preview, while ImageSharp beta has been compiled against 4.4. In that case the solution is easy however: just check out our latest nightlies, we moved to 4.5 with #482 .. NuGet is pulling the newest version by default as far as I understand.\n@JimBobSquarePants this is a very serious issue. All new users + all users doing a NuGet update will encounter it. Fortunately beta-3 is coming very soon.. @boradakash:\nThat's a super-old buggy version, we had many fixes/changes since that. Please read this article for the major API change introducing Mutate/Clone:\nhttps://sixlabors.com/blog/announcing-imagesharp-beta-1/. > Loading the Image took about 3 Minutes. [4128x3096]\nUnfortuanately Xamarin runtime lacks SIMD support + has poor Generics implementation at the moment. ImageSharp performance relies heavily on these fetures. Hope they gonna improve this in the future.. It's crazy, these fields are not even next to each other! :S Maybe strange behavior was somehow related to generics in ComparableExtensions.Swap<T>().\nThe change looks good to me!. Posted this into mono gitter channel: \n\nLooks like a generic Swap(ref T a, ref T b) method is able to corrupt the owner object of a and/or b when a/b comes from the heap.\n\nHope someone will be able to figure it out. These images remind me of the good-old CGA days! ^^\n\nHope I can do a proper review later this week.. @JimBobSquarePants When I try to run multiple DitherTests in parallel (only DitherTests!), they all fail with NullReferenceException. My stack trace is ending with:\nat SixLabors.ImageSharp.PixelFormats.NamedColors`1.GetWebSafePalette() in c:\\dev\\ImageSharp\\_common\\src\\ImageSharp\\PixelFormats\\NamedColors{TPixel}.cs:line 733\n   at SixLabors.ImageSharp.PixelFormats.NamedColors`1..cctor() in c:\\dev\\ImageSharp\\_common\\src\\ImageSharp\\PixelFormats\\NamedColors{TPixel}.cs:line 728\nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/pull/456/files\nMy suggestion is to back the WebSafePalette property with the thread-safe variant of Lazy<T>.. Aaaaand fixed it!\nI'm unfamiliar with the math behind this stuff, but those images look cool, so it must be correct! :)\nI think it would be good to have some regression testing by calling .CompareToReferenceImage() for a well selected subset of input images (to make future optimizations safe!). I really don't know which images should we choose however.\n\nOr pass custom colors to all our thresholders\n\nWould be nice to have a test case demonstrating it. (Or at least I wasn't able to find the pink bike in the test output \ud83d\ude04 . @Toxantron the AvatarWithRoundedCorner doesn't live in this repository any longer. How should we change .vscode/launch.json?. Can we merge this after changing .vscode/launch.json? \nThere are too much open PR-s now, makes it harder to manage conflicts.. @mphipps1 a little note about manipulating individual pixels:\nour image[x,y] indexer is way faster than the same feature in System.Drawing, but it's still not the most efficient way, if want to touch 120k pixels. We will provide lower level API-s for this through Memory<T> as soon as the newest version of the System.Memory module becomes official on NuGet.. Manipulating individual pixels should be really considered as a primitive operation. Attempts to handle it as a high-level drawing operation will most likely end up introducing significant overhead in any image processing library :). @msmolka the 4.5 version of System.Memory used by .NET Core 2.1 is not yet available on NuGet, thus we are not able to support it in our beta ImageSharp package published on NuGet.\nThis means that we only support .NET Core <= 2.0 at the moment. I hope 2.1 reaches preview state soon, so we can add support for it.. Looks like we've got a green light to fix this. Here's what we need to do:\n- [x] Update the package reference\n- [x] adopt a few API changes like span.DangerousGetPinnableReference() -> MemoryMarshal.GetReference(span)\n- [x] Add netcoreapp2.1 target to the test project\n- [x] Configure at least one of our CI platforms to also run tests on 2.1\nThe last one is not critical, but I'm pretty much into testing everything that's considered to be a feature.\n@JimBobSquarePants should we add this to the beta-3 milestone?. According to gitter news a PR is actually being prepared for this :). I think #577 closes this. 2.1 should work fine in nightlies.\nappveyor test execution will be added with .NET Core 2.1 RC2. @vpenades we have Image.Identify() for this since the merging of #292. Do you lack some other functionality here, or just missed it? :). @vpenades see this spontaneous design discussion to see API choices we made.. @jimbobsquarepants not sure if I understand the nature of the issue #453, but I think it would be very important to add a regression test with the image provided by vpenades. (before we forget it :smile:). Maybe I can check this in the next few days. Will definitely do it for beta3.. @JimBobSquarePants I will also try to check it as soon as I'm finished with the MemoryManager stuff.\nCan you point me to the code parts you investigated? (\"k value\"). @JimBobSquarePants as far as I understand, the conversion methods are correct in both decoders, they are just consuming the wrong k in the \"golang\" case. I guess the \"golang\" spectral data is wrong for the input provided in this issue (the \"pdfjs\" one is inaccurate for others).\nWe have these tests to verify the spectral coefficients produced in the stream parsing phase directly against libjpeg-turbo launched as a separate process (windows only execution).\nCurrently the pdfjs spectral test cases are skipped (many failing!) but you can enable them to play around. For the input in this issue I expect the opposite: ~pdfjs fails & golang succeeds~. I mean: golang fails pdfjs succeeds - seems like bed time for me! :)\nAny further investingation, or even a branch with new failing spectral tests is a progress IMO \ud83d\ude04 . @valse why don't you create a new image with the desired width of im1.Width+im2.Width, and draw the two input images here? Resize() is for scaling the input image.. @valse thanks that's very useful feedback! \ud83d\udc4d Normally, the memory usage should not grow with your use case, so this might be a bug. Gonna try to investigate it during my work on #225.\nIt's a huge job however, so I really need all the help the community can provide! I you could make a small, self containing console app reproducing this issue, there is higher chance I'll be able to fix the issue and maybe provide a workaround for you that works with the current official beta.. @valse thanks! Gonna memory profile it within a few days.\n@JimBobSquarePants I think SixLabors.ImageSharp.Web.Memory.BufferDataPool shouldn't be public! It's  has all the drawbacks of an uncofigurable/unreplaceable singleton!\n(I don't think it's the main issue in this example however.). @valse can you also try with the newest nightlies? I'm curious if it's any better.\nFinishing #225 should provide a solution for this. There will be a PR this week, and I hope it will be merged before the end of the next week.. >  How do you suggest we make it possible for devs implementing IImageResolver to use pooling then?\nHard question. Maybe they can use an ArrayPool instance configured by their own. Maybe you can try passing around a configurable array pool abstraction (IBufferDataPool) with dependency injection. But I have only partial understanding of the web middleware, so these are just random thoughts + demonstraiting my usual reaction to singletons again / \ud83d\ude31 \ud83d\udc80 / \ud83d\ude06\nRe DrawImage:\nYeah that cloning seems unnecessary. Somehow we managed to eliminate it in other processors.. Then we should definitely use Size.\nThought I added a few more comments here, but can't find them, so I'm going to repeat them:\n1. Naming: I think we should name this method GetCurrentSize().\n2. I have an idea to internalize this stuff painlessly, maybe I'll send a PR later hiding Size/Bounds and the MemoryManager from the IImageProcessingContext<T> API surface. We should not block ourselves thinking too much on this, but if we have a bit of extra time, I think it's worth to do this extra work to keep the interface as narrow as possible.. >    Run some resizes, like with the current stress tests.\n\nStop using ImageSharp, and run a full GC collection, one that also tries to free any large object.\n   Test result: how much memory was actually freed, and how much is still locked by the array pools?\n\n@vpenades as you wish!\nOn this chart you can see the effect of calling MemoryManager.ReleaseRetainedResources() + GC.Collect() after ~200 requests:\n\n\nSo, to use an alternative memory manager, there's two choices: [...]\n\nYes, you always need to explicitly pass a memory manager to individual operations. I suggest you to implement an ImagingContext class which owns a  ~MemoryManager~ Configuraition+MemoryManager for you and encapsulates your commonly used Image factory methods & maybe some operations. As @JimBobSquarePants explained, we did not want such a thing to be part of our core API, because it complicates things, and hardens the learning curve of the library, while not needed by the 90% of our users.\n. @JimBobSquarePants a quick initial investigation regarding the regression in speed:\nLooks like there are several factors behind that, scattered through the whole codebase.\nThe most significant is probably Span<T> indexer, and the use of IBuffer<T>.Span (accessing elements in a lazy way: buffer.Span[i]). Span is being used now on many places where we've been using locally pooled arrays earlier, it has a high impact therefore.\nI've been running my benchmarks on .NET 4.6.1 runtime (was simpler to work with command line), where indexing Span<T> is significantly slower than indexing arrays. The slowdown of the ReadByteStuffedByteUnsafe() is a quite trivial example in the Jpeg decoder:\n\nLike it or not, but if we want the library to be fast on the classic .NET, we have to replace indexers with Unsafe.Add(ref base, i) on hot path.\nI will continue my investigation and maybe apply fixes on the weakest points.. @JimBobSquarePants check out my latest optimization commits. Pushed stuff that would normally deserve a separate explanatory PR.\nMaybe I'll add a few more of these (only for stuff that's covered!), and we can merge afterwards.. Okkay, I guess I managed to bring back speed to previous levels with just a few changes, so no one would feel there's a regression.. @JimBobSquarePants \nRe Parallel.For parameters:\nI also discovered them yesterday! I was googling for that feature (I was quite sure it must exist), and it was right here on the Parallel.For, API we just failed to notice it :)\nRe indexable fixed structs:\nIt's quite an unsafe trick, so one should be very careful using it. Strictly speaking, it should be named something like GetItemUnsafe(idx) instead of simply being an indexer, but that naming is soooo verbose.. I'm merging this now, further optimizations and API changes will be added as separate PR-s.. @JimBobSquarePants based on this answer, I don't think auto seeking is what the \"just work\" behavior meant to do here.\nLooks like we just fail to copy the contents of the MD5Stream to MemoryStream internally for some reason.. @JimBobSquarePants  re mixing the two decoders, this is how I imagine it:\n1. Adapt OrigJpegScanDecoder (the SOS parser) into the PdfJs stream parsing logic, this can be tested & debugged independently with the help of SpectralJpegTests\n2. Implement IRawJpegData by the pdfjs port, so we can feed the spectral results to JpegImagePostProcessor. @JimBobSquarePants I think there is a misunderstanding. Isn't the point of #477 that we are failing to load from a non-seekable stream?\nIn that case this is only a \"fix\" for the workaround that asks the user to manually load the image into a memory stream. We are just rewinding the stream to the beginning, so the user shouldn't.\nIf my understanding is correct, I think we should not do this, this is quite unconventional. We should investigate the issue with non-seekable streams instead.. @JimBobSquarePants Depends on what RST marker is. Wish I knew, need to check it \ud83d\ude03\n. What happens if we ignore the verification?. @iamcarbon you're right, those test failures are most likely unrelated to System.Memory. I was hoping that with this PR we can introduce actual support for 2.1 but It's getting too hard.\nMaybe we should leave it for now, and just update the package. We can figure out the next steps later.. My test output from the point where stuff starts to fail. Many failing, mostly Drawing stuff.. Actually .. they are all drawing related, maybe with the same root cause. Maybe there is a simple fix :). Nope .. I really should be in bed now! \ud83d\ude04. No, I just approved the T4 changes I requested. If we want, we can fix the drawing stuff later.\nThe tooling is not very friendly, or at least not with the VS2017+R# versions I have installed, so I haven't started debugging it.. @cemalpolat can you be more specific? We hardly understand your issue. \nWhen getting incorrect results: Are you trying to resize + save your image with System.Drawing? Or are you trying ImageSharp? (We do not depend on OS services at all btw.)\nIf you are looking for basic ImageSharp resize examples, just go through our main README.. If your issue is ImageSharp specific, and you are getting results different from what you expect:\nCan you please share a basic code snippet/console application reproducing your issue with your sample image attached?. So you mean file size. It wasn't clear from your original post, \"image size\" usually means image dimensions. \nBy applying filters like blackwite or grayscale, you are loosing information, and jpeg is a compressed format, so it works as expected.\nDo you also get a 4x smaller file size after applying AutoOrient (without doing a resize)? Can you share a sample image reproducing the issue?\nCan you also explain why is this an issue in your application? Is the image quality insufficient?. 1. Images please.\n2. Explain please: why is this behavior wrong for you? It's a good thing to have smaller files.. Another counter-argument against publishing the processors (and I promise, this would be the last one \ud83d\ude04):\nImplementing #142 won't be possible without breaking public API. Are we fine with this?\nIt would also affect IResampler API.. Unfortunately, I can't make for 1.0 \ud83d\ude1e, it's a quite a lot of work & I'm starting my new job in a week.\nWe need to decide if we should make it possible to implement it in a 1.*  version, without major breaking changes. \nThe price is: keeping things internal and/or investing extra effort into making our API more future-proof.. Naive apporach:\nIResampler should be something like IResampler<TMatrix> & ResizeProcessor should be also generic to keep stuff boxing & virtual call free + utilize JIT-time optimizations.\nAdvanced approach:\nFinding a way to hide generics behind nested implementation classes using tricks like double dispatch. The public API should be still touched, but in a less intrusive way.. Had another look, and still looks good to me.\nI think the only non-trivial decision here is to have the drawing code in SixLabors.ImageSharp.Processing.Overlays instead of SixLabors.ImageSharp.Processing.Drawing. Can't decide if it's good or not. Thoughts?. @jherby2k we got it in with #567. Check out beta4!\nFor future planes see #565.. @JimBobSquarePants great analysis of the problem! To summarize things further:\nThis is how our output looks like with following the original order in the article:\n\nThe list of the failing Blenders:\n- ATop\n- In\n- Out\n- Dest Atop\n- Dest In\n- Dest Out. Might be related to (or actually the same issue as) #572 and SixLabors/Shapes/#42.\n@tocsoft is my supposition right?. Shouldn't be fixed yet. SL.ImageSharp.Drawing is still referencing shapes 1.0.0-ci0018.\nWe still need a PR updating shapes.\n. @JimBobSquarePants only in SL.Shapes: SixLabors/Shapes#43\nWe need to update the reference to have these issues closed.. Fixed with #596  in beta4.. The default jpeg quality is 75:\nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/blob/master/src/ImageSharp/Formats/Jpeg/JpegEncoder.cs\nYou can change it to 100 on a new JpegEncoder instance and passing it to image.Save(). Does this help? (Remember: jpeg is a lossy format!). Also:\nimage.Mutate(x => x.BackgroundColor(Rgba32.White));\ndoesnt this eliminate the backround artifact?. @MartinDawson sorry, I missed that you actually called .BackgroundColor(). Also remember to dispose your images!\n@JimBobSquarePants there might be an actual .Clone() bug lurk in there, we should probably investigate this further.. @riverar is this fixed with ImageSharp beta4 + .NET Core RC1?. @riverar thanks for checking!. @riverar what is the CPU you experienced this with?. Great PR!\nThe question is about the level of impact on public API, because if there are significant breaking changes, we should consider adding them quickly to beta-3. (Maybe separate PR?). Those API changes seem to be really small, maybe they won't gonna hurt anyone, or will they?\nTBH, I'm afraid of pushing last-minute changes into releases, even if they seem super-safe, and done by smart people :) It's too late here to trust my code-review skills, \n. @dlemstra How large can the count of ExifProfile.Values grow in extreme cases? If it can grow high, I think making it struct might be benefitical from performance point of view. \nI've seen lot's of exif allocations the last time I profiled my LoadTest project, but can't recall where it was exactly.. Yeah pinning is the standard practice flwhen consuming pointer API-s, it's cheap for short periods AFAIK.. @tocsoft this is how the SixLaborsSampleAB.woff font intentionally looks like right?\nThe output looks fine with OpenSans-Regular.ttf:\n- Tests\n- Results\n@lukapor do you still have the issue with ImageSharp beta4 + .NET Core RC1?. @lukapor it would be very helpful if you could share the type of your CPU!\n(Seems like these issues are HW specific)\n. @martinpetrovaj how does your project's dependency graph look like? Which versions are actually pulled by nuget and copied to your bin?\nSystem.Memory hasn't changed between RC1 and the official 1.0 (the referenced PR is already part of the RC1). Are you sure you don't have other packages pulling in pre-RC1 versions of that package?\nCan you make sure you updated all the System.* references to the official 1.0 everywhere?. @martinpetrovaj I also feel quite stupid when debugging these package hell issues. The whole thing doesn't make sense to me, and I have no idea how to reproduce it.\nAre you running on .NET Core 2.1 runtime?\nCan you do us a favor and try pulling our newest MyGet packages? There is some (not too high :disappointed:) chance that it may make the issue go away. In that case we will release a new hotfix beta ASAP. . @martinpetrovaj great news, thanks!\n@JimBobSquarePants @tocsoft we need to push a   new beta through the whole stack.. @labmorales the issue being subject of this thread is fixed. By making sure your project is using only the new official versions of System.Memory, there should be no type load errors related to System.Span<T>.\nBased on your comment, it seems to me that you are facing a compatibility problem related to ImageSharp.Web. I suggest to join our gitter channel, I'm pretty sure someone will be able to help you.. @JimBobSquarepants to avoid further confusion:\nThe latest NuGet release of IS.Web is beta0003, which is incompatible with the current IS beta0005. This is the root cause of the issue @labmorales is experiencing. Is this correct?. Good news is that the majority of the 32bit test failures is caused by floating point inaccuracies rooted in architecture mismatch of reference / actual output. This could be fixed by increasing the tolerance.\nThe most serious difference I noticed is in BlackWhiteTest.ApplyBlackWhiteFilter().. And yeah ... one major disadvantage of this change is that appveyor is going to run for ages :. Dropped the RunExtendedTests.cmd test execution mode. All configurations are executed as separate job using run-tests.ps1. I wish we could execute them in parallel. Is it possible for open-source licenses?. I consider this PR ready for review, if the current build passes.\n@tocsoft was there any reason for automatic test execution when calling build.ps1 locally? I removed it, because there are too many runtime+architecture combinations now. It's probably better to run tests explicitly using run-tests.ps1.. @stevehipwell just open a stream using File.OpenRead(fileName) and pass it to Image.Load(...).\n@JimBobSquarePants on one hand, I really really want to get rid of NET Standard 1.1, but on the other hand there are so many large enterprises having stupid IT limitations keeping them in the stone age. I really wish we knew how many users do we have amongst such companies. @stevehipwell is this your case? \ud83d\ude04 . Originally, I was a big supporter of this move, but now I'm concerned that we can hurt enterprise users with it. I'm fine, if this is only a small group of people, but unfortunately, we don't know for sure.. @mabead does this help:\nhttps://sixlabors.github.io/docs/articles/ImageSharp/MemoryManagement.html\n?\nI also recommend you to rethink your scaling strategy, if possible. A memory limit of 1GB is too low for image processing applications, specially if you need to handle very large images.. I'm really curious if falling back to SimpleGcMemoryManager could help here.\nAn MMF MemoryManager could definitely solve this.. Would be wise to add one of the images to our test suite before we close the issue.\n. @JimBobSquarePants we should also add a well visible link at http://sixlabors.com/, eg. by having \"About, Projects, Documentation, Blog\" in the header, but I have no idea how to do that.. @JimBobSquarepants the pdfjs spectral results are buggy, even in the original javascript code. We already discussed this. I don't support the decoder switch in the proposed form. \nWe can reuse the pdfjs stream parsing orchestration code (it's definitely cleaner), while keeping my \"golang\" scan parser. It produces correct results for all images in our test suite - pdfjs dpesn't.. @JimBobSquarePants sorry, my fault, I missed that point.\nWhat happens if you unskip VerifySpectralCorrectness_PdfJs?. Floating point color postprocessing is now entirely decoupled from the pdfjs code btw. JpegImagePostprocessor just needs an IRawJpegData implementation.. Good news! In that case we should probably enable  all pdfjs tests in this PR.\nDoing the swap is really just doing an interface implementation from that point! ;). @darrenkopp your CPU is quite old, it does not have AVX2 support. I wonder if .NET SIMD is utilized at all. What is the value of Vector.IsHardwareAccelerated?. @darrenkopp @JimBobSquarePants  I think it's easy to explain this:\nYou need a CPU with AVX2 support to enable the optimized SIMD color conversion path in our current code. It's actually much faster than any other possible implementation. The pdfjs implementation utilizes a LUT based optimiziation. It's faster than the non-SIMD floating point path, but it's also less accurate.\nMost of today's CPU-s are AVX2-enabled, specially in cloud environments.. @JimBobSquarePants seems like a good plan! A few concerns however:\n1. I would not bother too much with this point in this PR:\n\nTry to speed up non SIMD colorspace transforms.\n\nWhatever we do it will get complicated. Doesn't worth the effort IMO (at least not now). Most CPU-s support AVX2 now, the only considerable platform without good SIMD support is Xamarin, but .. well it's another long and painful story :)\n2. I would instead add a point addressing the code duplications!\nI'm quite sure we can find out something after a quick brainstorming.. @JimBobSquarePants Good job!\nHow did you produce the reference png-s? Have you used jpeg2png.cmd? Unlike our other tests, where utilizing an external tool is really hard, I want libjpeg-turbo to be our standard tool here instead of self-generating them.. @JimBobSquarePants a few points:\n- Can you run DecodeJpegMultiple and share the results? Will take a bit longer to run + melt your CPU, but worth it!\n- The amount of AggressiveInlining worries me, it might be actually contraproductive + makes it really hard to profile the code. (A profiler can't follow & report inline methods!) Let's reduce it a bit! My suggestion:\n  - Receive, ReceiveAndExtend: Inlined\n  - DecodeACFirst, DecodeACSuccessive: NOT inlined\n  - DecodeMcuDCSuccessive, DecodeBlockACFirst, DecodeMcuACFirst ... (all the short methods): Inlined\n  - DecodeScanBaseline, DecodeScanProgressive: NOT Inlined\n- Good job by reducing the duplication, but I still consider the amount of codedups very high. I'm happy to reduce it in a follow-up PR however.. @JimBobSquarePants cool, we are almost done with the PR, the only thing we need to change is to generate the reference images with libjpeg. You need imagemagick in order to use jpeg2png.cmd.\nIf you can't make it now, I will do it in the evening.. GC is prone to LOH fragmentation issues, so I'm afraid using SimpleGcMemoryManager could be even more vulnerable to OOM.\nWe need to utilize MMF to support these memory constrained scaling approaches tbh.\nWhat is the resize request frequency in yoir production environment? What are the most typical image dimensions?. @mabead this is a very useful usage information! I really appreciate it, thanks!. @mabead it's most likely because your'e processing requests infrequently. Good to know this!. @LiangZugeng\n- SimpleGcMemoryManager in our docs\n- How to configure MemoryManagers\nLet me know if it helps!. Well done! Should we merge this when appveyor is finished?. @wexman I'm not really familiar with WPF ImageSource-es, but can you construct an image source wrapping raw RGBA byte[] data?\nIn that case you can export Image<Rgba32>-s contents using the image.SavePixelData(byteArray) extension method. This is the best we have at the moment. Smarter, Span<T>-based low level interop API-s are about to be published in 1.0.\nPS:\nWe have a gitter channel for questions.. @springy76 there is a solution on the way.\nI'm not (yet) familiar with WPF image sources, but I hope it makes it possible to do zero-copy interop.. TestCop says:\nthis PR got merged too quickly, there are no tests at all for the new packing method!. Great news! I will be AFK tomorrow, but looking forward to review the results in the next few days!\nIt might be also worth to make the output somewhat smaller to save some submodule bandwidth (-> electricity, trees, dolphins etc.), but do no bother with it, if it complicates things too much.. @jongleur1983 thanks!\nGonna fix up your tests a little bit and push the reference images.. Everything looks good now @jongleur1983's local test running issues are unrelated to his PR.\nI'm planning to merge this soon, let me know if there are blocker issues we've missed, so I shouldn't!. Finally merged!\n@jongleur1983 thanks for pushing the rename!. @JimBobSquarePants @iamcarbon this is a good quick improvement on quantizers, however I know for sure the root cause for the long time and high memory usage of OctreeQuantizer (therefore default gif encoder).\nThere is an opportunity for a huge asymptotic optimization, because the current tree is unbalanced + not limited in depth. It's also possible to store the tree in a way that embraces memory locality, but this should be the second step.\nI believe that these steps together should bring those 4-6 minutes well below 1min, but this is a big a task for a couple of days.. @JimBobSquarePants the difference is not big however. I suspect the root cause is a difference between SIMD and software implementations of Vector4 operations.\nHope it's not CPU dependent & locally reproducible.. Bottom-LeftOrTop:\n\nBottom-RightOrBottom:\n\n@JimBobSquarePants you sure TaperCorner works fine? Isn't it the inverse of the intended? Or I'm getting it wrong?. LOL .. that image!\nBut isn't the first example tapering towards the right corner? Or should I start over my English courses? :D. It seems to me that the original definition is wrong, because the \"tapered\" edge is not on the left (but on the right!) corner of the image.\n\nBut again, it might be just my wrong understanding of the term \"tapering\".. I understand now.\nThe PR is in a perfect state, sorry for the long linguistic session! :). Well .. almost. Haven't noticed, the tests are failing again, gonna check it out now.. #### TryReadBit\nOk, the TryReadBit() call is not that hot and it might be worth to communicate the result through a return bool for better readability.\nmetadataOnly\nUnfortunately, in metadataOnly mode we still read 721 invalid \"file markers\" for Snake.jpg. I think the semantic of remaining might be different for SOS. If you debug through MetaDataIsParsedCorrectly_PdfJs with useIdentify == false VS useIdentify == true the issue becomes clear!\nDoes Jpeg allow to place an APP marker (or any other metadata-related marker) after a SOS? If not, we are probably fine if we just break out of the while loop instead of continuing in a faulted state.. I think it's very unlikely (if not impossible) to find an APP marker after a Scan. If you can't find a better solution, I vote for jumping out of the loop when metaData == true and we reach SOS. Feels like, the chance of incorrect behavior is lower if we do so.. I guess this article confirms my assumption. Of course, nothing is official in Jpegland :). Looks much better!\nGonna do a final review tomorrow.. Everything is fine now, we should do the merge, and implement further improvements in new PR-s.. Opened #553 to deal with the coverage issues. Hope it can be merged quickly.. From the Separation of Concerns point of view, I'm still not a big fan of introducing a BackgroundColor property on an imaging API. (It would be fine on a canvas API!)\nBut if you guys find it powerful and useful & vote to keep it, I would not resists.\nOne question:\n- Do we still need BackgroundColorProcessor?\n- If yes:\n  - Shouln't we optimize it as well?\n  - Shouldn't it change the ImageFrame.BackgroundColor for all frames?. @woutware the constructor taking backgroundColor + it's auto-filling optimization are cool things, I have no issue with them! \nThe purist part of me just wants to drop the background color parameter after initialization, and leave the post-constructor job of initializing new frames with the proper color to the user. Only very a small minority of our users do manual multi-frame gif manipulation!. It's @JimBobSquarePants's job to decide it from now. He is the Grand High Eternal Dictator! \ud83d\ude06 \n(+ my question abut BackgroundColorProcessor still stands, mostly addressed to him.). @JimBobSquarePants thanks, I understand now!\nShouldn't BackgroundColorProcessor alter ImageFrame.BackgroundColor (if we keep the property)?. @jtorjo gonna check out your LogWizard tool, cuz it might be useful for my job. So thanks for making this mistake! :). \nUnexpected behavior confirmed.. Everything looks good now.\n@JimBobSquarePants I hope you don't mind that I'm merging this.. It is dump-jpeg-coeffs.exe being executed by Process.Start(). Do you know a better way of executing a command line utility from managed code?. @jongleur1983 great, thanks for the investigation!\nDo you want to PR it, or would you rather leave it to us?. Fixed in #561. @tmm360 your issue should be fixed in nightlies once we merge #560.\n@JimBobSquarePants I think we need to release a new beta to have ImageSharp propely beta tested against 2.1 RC1 (finally having a stable System.Memory API I hope). @jherby2k I like your API proposal pretty much, we should implement it.\nBut it's important to make sure we have good docs on these methods, because currently it's very easy to confuse Load() with LoadPixelData() from the beginners POV in my opinion.\nOur current docs on Image.Load(byte[] data) aren't really helpful:\nCreate a new instance of the <see cref=\"Image{Rgba32}\"/> class from the given byte array.. #607 has been merged. We are progressing, but there are many issues I failed to notice when making the proposal:\n- Exposing image.GetPixelMemory() is not trivial\n- Exposing Image.Load<TPixel>(ReadOnlySpan<byte>) API-s also not trivial (/cc @jherby2k)\nSee the updated issue description for more details!. @jherby2k unfortunately, \"spanified stream\" isn't a thing that helps here, but I figured it out!\nWe can pin the span and use UnmanagedMemoryStream.\nGonna PR it soon.. @jherby2k ahh, you mean creating a MemoryStream and writing the span into it? I wanted to avoid this, it's a huge allocation :). We may need to introduce further API changes to allow handling very large unmanaged buffers and memory mapped files, but the topic is not yet clear for me. I'm leaving a few links here, so we can find them later:\n- An article on the new API-s\n- Memory-mapped files and Memory<T>: dotnet/corefx#26603. Best System.Memory article so far:\nhttps://www.codemag.com/Article/1807051/Introducing-.NET-Core-2.1-Flagship-Types-Span-T-and-Memory-T. All tasks are done, so I'm closing this epic.. Not everyone knows about Span<T>, and there are only a few who really understand it. I would expect many users looking for the good-old byte[] overload, so maybe it's better to keep it.\nAn other donwside is loosing binary compatiblity, but I don't mind that, because no one cares about binary compatiblity in .NET Core world these days \ud83d\ude06 (At least not before reaching RC.). Did some refactor on JpegDecoderTests + added another test image for #159.\nEverything LGTM now, feel free to merge!. @JimBobSquarePants the example code suggests that he is not using an alpha.\n@AtwindYu the question is the source of the marked information in the sample output image you posted in this thread. Is it an old output?. @diegogarciaa try rendering smaller parts of the text on manually defined locations.. Reopening this for now, see:\nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/issues/496#issuecomment-391323991. Fixed with #596  in beta4.. @JimiSmith can you have a look at your \"dependencies\" in Visual Studio? Is there soemthing unrelated to ImageSharp, that pulls in a reference to System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe?\nTroubleshooting idea 0: try referencing the 4.5.0-rc1 version of the package directly.. @JimiSmith I'm not familiar with Azure Functions at all, but this looks pretty familiar to binding redirect issues I used to face in some complex projects.\nA quick \"no idea what I'm googling for\" search gave me these:\n- https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-host/issues/992\n- https://codopia.wordpress.com/2017/07/21/how-to-fix-the-assembly-binding-redirect-problem-in-azure-functions/\nI wonder if it helps.. @Leonardo-Ferreira unfortunately, there is no built-in way for this at the moment. Here are the tasks we should complete to implement this feature:\n- [ ] provide a new IPixel implemntation\n- [ ] Add a .FromCmyk(...) method to IPixel and PixelOperations\n- [ ] Integrate the conversion into the Jpeg decoder\nIt's very easy to do a RGB -> CMYK conversion in your application code however as a workaround.. @brianpopow should be a CLR code generation bug again. Thanks for figuring this out!. It pretty much looks like this is fixed with #591.. Damn.\nI have a repository for hacking AppVeyor gonna continue my experiments here. (Don't want to start adding commits like these to ImageSharp.). Ok, it's mission impossible, the tooling bug won.\nGonna redefine the purpose of this PR:\nLet's just add the 2.1 setup for now to enable manual execution, disable 2.1 test execution on CI, and define manual 2.1 test execution to be part of our (self)review process.\nWe can release beta4 this way. The bug is gonna be fixed in rc2. According to @brianpopow, it's already fixed in nightlies. (Big thanks for him for pointing my attention to dotnet/cli#9240 a few days ago!)\n@JimBobSquarePants does it sound like a plan?. Ok, we need to fix travis here (by disabling 2.1/moving back to 2.0) + we should reference the newst sl.drawing package to fix the drawing artifact issues.\nLet's hope we can do it by let's say Wednessday. I'm AFK until tomorrow evening.. I'm closing this in favor of #585. I don't think AppVeyor the test failures are related to the changes in this PR. Created #580 to check it in a quick and dirty way.. I think the issue has been introduced by using the newest \"VS 2017 Preview\" AppVeyor image.\nI think we can workaround (\ud83d\ude1e)  this by using that image only for 2.1.. Quirky behavior proven.. @JimBobSquarePants reopened #580 to test both CI builds with an empty PR.. @brianpopow good news, thanks, the code looks much better now!\nThis issue is totally crazy.. @isualize do you know the memory limit of your container? If it's too low is it possible to scale it up? Any info/estimation regarding your load? (no of requests/minute)\nNot my favorite advice but also try out SimpleGcMemoryManager.. @isualize your usage data might be super-valuable for us!\nIf we add allocation tracing to beta5, are you interested sharing future ImageSharp logs with us?\nThis would help us solving memory issues.. @isualize @andymac4182 thanks! :+1: @tocsoft is working on a Telemetry solution that will minimize the efforts on your side, hope we can make it into beta5.\nI also hope that with #642 I can significantly reduce the memory consumption for resizing use-cases. It is planned for RC1.. @isualize the upper limit for overall memory usage under a 64bit process depends on your container/OS, it can be as high as 8 TB. I've been just wondering if there is a theoretical/practical limit for a single contiguous buffer allocation putting an upper limit on our image dimensions.. @kroymann thank you, this would be very helpful, and we are super interested in this!\nI'm quite busy with all kind of stuff these weeks (kinda \"out of SixLabors imaginary office\"), so it's unlikely that we will be able to add common logging/telemetry before 1.0. \nHowever, if you have a logging logic in your application it would be very helpful if you share any kind of ImageSharp-specific logs with us!\nEvent's we are interested in:\n- decoding/encoding images: format, dimensions, file sizes (if available)\n- processing: parameters (eg. in case of resize: source dimensions, dest dimensions, resampler type)\n- OOM (when occures): stack trace\nGeneral data:\n- Timestamps for all events\n- Hardware configuration (type of CPU, available memory)\nIf you are able to share this kind of usage data, feel free to PM me on our gitter channel.. @Tarek-Samy further memory management improvements are planned to upcoming versions. Those assemly loading errors really suck, but I think it's not a sustainable strategy to stick with an old version.\nCan you open an issue describing the error you get with beta 6 adding as many details as possible? (Project structure all referenced packages etc.)\nI hope we can find a workaround for you, and also help other people facing these issues.. @Splamy thanks a lot for taking the time to investigate this!\nWe probably should raise a mono issue (again!), and implement a workaround within our codebase.. @JimBobSquarePants isn't \"Faster Jpeg Huffman Decoding\" a better title for this?\nGonna post some up-to-date profiler results tonight, but TryDecodeHuffman() and TryReadBit() are our major Jpeg Decoder bottlenecks as far as I remember.\n@hypeartist in my opinion the fastest way to look for improvement opportunities is doing a comparative debug/analysis against other decoders. Doing a full port is very time consuming + having something fast in languages like C, C++, go, rust etc. doesn't guarantee the same code will be fast in C#. (We've been there several times!)\nIf you can figure out something, please let us know! Any help is appreciated.. Performance profile for running all the JpegProfilingBenchmarks.DecodeJpeg_PdfJs() (baseline) cases together (some AggressiveInlining were removed to get more information about the calls, but not all):\n\n. @Antecer start here:\nhttps://sixlabors.github.io/docs/articles/intro.html\nYou need the .DrawImage() extension method from the Sixlabors.ImageSharp.Drawing package.\nHave a look at our \"draw a watermark on image\" example.\nAlso:\nask questions on our gitter channel, our issue tracker is for issues & feature requests only!. @brianpopow yeah feel free!\nWe need to update our CI, so I'm curious what will be the outcome of this.. @JimBobSquarePants @brianpopow we need to run those tests locally in 32 bit + older runtime, and analyse whether they need skipping, deleting, or a fix/workaround.\nUnfortunately I'm out of \"ImageSharp office\" at least for a week :(. I think the difference in the result is negligable, our test assertion shouldn't be that strict when dealing with floats. We need R, G, B, A properties on Rgba64 however to implement tolerant assertions.. @brianpopow with which framework did it fail? The older ones only?. @brianpopow definitely an untraceable JIT bug that got ~lost in the fog~ fixed meanwhile.\nYour output suggests that the bug is probably in the code generated for the aggressively inlined Rgb24(byte r, byte g, byte b) constructor.\nYour test change is fine, TBH I do not want to spend more efforts on this kind of stuff - unless a user finds an actual bug related to this issue.. > [..]  allows us to use the new apis in NETCOREAPP2.1.\n@iamcarbon we need to pollute our code with #ifdef-s if we do. I think it's not a good strategy from the maintenance point of view. \nThe PR also introduces a maintenance cost of keeping an extra target compiled in the core library (slower compilations locally + on CI).\nQuestions:\n- Are there any .NET Core 2.1 API-s available at the moment we really want to utilize because of the benefits they bring?\n- Is there any killer benefit from the users POV if we target .NET Core 2.1 directly?. @iamcarbon well done thanks!\nCan you validate if dotnet xunit -f netcoreapp2.1 covers the new #if-ed code paths (by pulling in the platform specific dll instead of the netstandard one)? Any appveyor configuration suggestion if it doesn't?. Can't remember for sure, but this line is probably a workaround for a similar issue.. Pushed a few changes, because I'm quite OCD-ish about really having the coverage we need. @JimBobSquarePants hope you're fine with them.\nI'd say let's merge this, I'm curious about the new NuGet package being generated by our nightlies!\nHowever we should expect super long and boring test execution from now. It might be worth to disable some of the target_framework-s  in appveyor.yml (which?) or ask Santa Claus to rent us a test machine up in the clouds. \u2601\ufe0f \ud83c\udf28 . @marcpabst  We plan to expose safe, and low level pixel manipulation API-s based on System.Memory types Span<T> and Memory<T>, enabling interop scenarios like yours. See #565 for details.\nMeanwhile you can use a temporary API at your own risk. I'm about to deprecate it as soon as the Span<T> / Memory<T> stuff get's into the final code. This API may not be part of our final 1.0 release:\n```C#\nusing SixLabors.ImageSharp.Advanced;\nusing (Image image = LoadMyImage())\n{\n    fixed (Rgba32* pixelPtr = &image.DangerousGetPinnableReferenceToPixelBuffer())\n    {\n        // interop code on pixelPtr\n    }\n}\n```\nNote 1: this code is utilizing ref locals!\nNote 2: The final System.Memory based version would look like this:\nC#\nfixed (Rgba32* pixelPtr =&MemoryMarshal.GetReference(image.PixelMemory))\n{\n    // interop code on pixelPtr\n}. @tocsoft good finding thanks!\nI think I can find a way to manage this without touching the IBuffer<T> API. Now I think we should make that interface as narrow as possible, because it might make sense to replace it with IMemoryOwner<T>.. @tocsoft after thinking a lot, it seems still most reasonable to manage the ownership move/swap logic in Buffer2D<TPixel>. This way all IBuffer<T>-s are returned to their own allocators/pools on .Dispose().\nImage<T> and ImageFrame<T> swapping logic is now delegated to the implementation in Buffer2D<TPixel>.SwapOrCopyContent(). It has the following rules:\n- We can always swap the contents of two Buffer2D<T> instances if their inner buffers both own their memory (regardless of their original MemoryAllocator-s).\n- If one of the inner buffers is only consumed, and the sizes are same, we can copy the contents to the destination buffer\n- If one of the inner buffers is only consumed, and the sizes are different, the operation is invalid, and an exception is thrown.\nFor me it seems we are good with these rules, added a plenty of tests to ensure they work.. @tocsoft made GetPixelMemory() and GetPixelRowMemory(y) internal for now. I plan to do the IBuffer<T>  :left_right_arrow: MemoryManager<T> separation in a separate PR (very soon).\nGonna merge this, if you are fine with the current status.. Double checked, image.Mutate(c => c.Fill(color)) will call into the optimized path @JimBobSquarePants mentioned. @tzachshabtay I'm quite sure it must have been some other draw call in your benchmark reporting ShapeRegion.Scan.\nI think we should close this issue.. @JimBobSquarePants will this resolve #285?. We can even skip the CRC point in this PR, adding an issue for it.\nThe point is that if our 64bpp/48bpp output is most likely fine, and we are sure we do not break existing code/test logic, that is an increment compared to what we currently have in the main branch.. @dlemstra is there an easy way to dump raw pixel data from libpng output?. @dlemstra do I get the full Rgba64 value from 16bit png images? ~Is it possible without writing C++ code (eg. using Magick.NET)?~ (Ohh .. yes)\nAny hint/link for start?\n@JimBobSquarePants \ud83d\udc4d for the revert, we should not risk our existing test coverage. If we could load a raw pixel data dump, and do a comparison against it, then we are good with the 16bit stuff! I'll see what I can do tonight.\nDecode_64Bpp_Rgba64_rgb-16-alpha.png is fine, it just looked like memory garbage to me \ud83d\ude04 . @JimBobSquarePants I'll have a look tomorrow!. Good news!\nI won't be able do make progress with Magick.NET testing now, so I think it's fine to merge this as-is + add an issue for the 16bit testing topic.\nI want to do a second review however in the next few days, hope I can do it by Saturday night.. @tocsoft I think what you need is to increase the tolerance a bit for the tests still failing. There are floating point implementation differences, leading to super-minor differences in the output.. @tocsoft I pushed a few refactors, if you're fine with them, I'm happy to merge this.. Btw. defining a library-wide cache infrastructure is a good idea! (Not easy though.)\nI discourage mixing caching concern with the allocator concern however. A short proposal:\n```C#\npublic interface ICache\n{\n    bool TryLookup(TKey key, out TResult);\n    void Clear();\n}\npublic class Configuration\n{\n    // ...\n    public ICache Cache { get; set; } = new NullCache(); // no caching by default?\n    // ...\n}\npublic interface IImageProcessingContext\n{\n    // ...\n    public ICache Cache { get; set; } = new DefaultCache();\n    // ...\n}\n```. @tocsoft good catch, fixed!. Yeah, I think this is the right place!. @vpenades I'm strongly against per-pixel delegates, because it's a performance-killer.. Makes sense, but we should be aware that we would be responsible supporting our users with all span-related stuff then.\nStill unsure whether it's good or not. Definitely wouldn't do it without adding more explanatory docs on the pixel manipulation. We are still lagging behind with that topic.. Let's add a test image from #624 before we forget it! :). @jeffreyleblanc225 we are supporting .NET 4.6.1 indirectly by supporting .NET Standard 2.0. In most cases this should work without any issues.\nIf you could investigate & post your NuGet dependencies + stack trace to this exception, maybe we can help tracing the root cause.. > I'm targeting 4.6.1, running on 4\nI missed this point in my previous reply. Does this mean is this mean that only 4.0 framework is installed on the target environment? Executing on a lower framework version than the target environment is an unsupported scenario in .NET.. Good catch! After seeing this PR and #627 I think we should turn Guard.NotNull() into a generic method to prevent the incorrect usage:\nC#\npublic static Guard.NotNull<T>(T obj) where T : class { ... }. We can probably handle this specific case with resize, but it looks like there is a is an upper limit for contiguous (managed?) buffers (4GB or 2GB, not sure yet).\nIf we want to support images bigger than 30,000 x 30,000 [Rgba32 pixels] = 4GB (or maybe 22,000 * 22,000 [Rgba32 pixels] = 2GB) we need to integrate advanced memory utilities like ReadOnlySequence into our memory management subsystem. This might be beyond our goals for 1.0.\n@EvK @DanStout regarding your use case: isn't it sufficient to throw a specific exception in those extreme cases?\n@JimBobSquarePants your thoughts on the topic?. Maybe there is no theoretical limit (at least not for native OS virtual memory) & it's just my system throwing OutOfMemoryException for new Vector4[Int32.MaxValue].\nNevertheless, we should avoid allocations of this kind.. @vpenades check out IReadOnlySequence<T>, it's a relatively simple, and standard way to achieve a very similar solution. (Yet I think we won't be able to make it into 1.0). @vpenades some of the test failures report relatively high difference, eg. _1DarkBlueRect_2BlendHotPinkRect_3BlendSemiTransparentRedEllipse<Rgba32>(provider: Blank250x250[Rgba32], mode: Src) has 1.14%. Are you sure it's not a bug/specification change?. Our current ref images should follow the definition in #493 and the article it references. If it's not the case, it means we have a bug here.\nExcuse us for the super slow progress on this PR! Unfortunately, this is an area I'm really not familiar with.  @JimBobSquarePants is fighting jpeg, namespace refactor and his flu. @tocsoft works on telemetry.  I think we need some extra patience with this, unless @dlemstra has some time to review this and help understanding the root cause of the differences.. @JimBobSquarePants pushed some code simplification, and a benchmark to quickly test ParseStream(). There is no change in performance:\nBaseline, Before:\n```\n                           Method | Runtime |                    TestImage |     Mean |     Error |    StdDev | Scaled | ScaledSD |    Gen 0 | Allocated |\n--------------------------------- |-------- |----------------------------- |---------:|----------:|----------:|-------:|---------:|---------:|----------:|\n            'System.Drawing FULL' |     Clr | Jpg/baseline/jpeg420exif.jpg | 18.35 ms |  8.224 ms | 0.4647 ms |   1.00 |     0.00 | 218.7500 | 757.88 KB |\n PdfJsJpegDecoderCore.ParseStream |     Clr | Jpg/baseline/jpeg420exif.jpg | 19.64 ms | 13.984 ms | 0.7901 ms |   1.07 |     0.04 |        - |     15 KB |\n                                  |         |                              |          |           |           |        |          |          |           |\n            'System.Drawing FULL' |    Core | Jpg/baseline/jpeg420exif.jpg | 18.36 ms |  4.017 ms | 0.2270 ms |   1.00 |     0.00 | 218.7500 | 757.04 KB |\n PdfJsJpegDecoderCore.ParseStream |    Core | Jpg/baseline/jpeg420exif.jpg | 21.21 ms | 10.237 ms | 0.5784 ms |   1.16 |     0.03 |        - |  14.84 KB |\n```\nBaseline, After:\nMethod | Runtime |                    TestImage |     Mean |    Error |    StdDev | Scaled | ScaledSD |    Gen 0 | Allocated |\n--------------------------------- |-------- |----------------------------- |---------:|---------:|----------:|-------:|---------:|---------:|----------:|\n            'System.Drawing FULL' |     Clr | Jpg/baseline/jpeg420exif.jpg | 18.38 ms | 7.007 ms | 0.3959 ms |   1.00 |     0.00 | 218.7500 | 757.88 KB |\n PdfJsJpegDecoderCore.ParseStream |     Clr | Jpg/baseline/jpeg420exif.jpg | 19.71 ms | 1.502 ms | 0.0849 ms |   1.07 |     0.02 |        - |     15 KB |\n                                  |         |                              |          |          |           |        |          |          |           |\n            'System.Drawing FULL' |    Core | Jpg/baseline/jpeg420exif.jpg | 17.86 ms | 1.077 ms | 0.0609 ms |   1.00 |     0.00 | 218.7500 | 757.04 KB |\n PdfJsJpegDecoderCore.ParseStream |    Core | Jpg/baseline/jpeg420exif.jpg | 20.84 ms | 7.756 ms | 0.4382 ms |   1.17 |     0.02 |        - |  14.88 KB |. Don't ask how, but it's possible to optimize huffman decoding with SIMD.. @funcylambda thanks volunteering, and sorry for the late reaction!\nActually, I received some critical voices on this proposal from @JimBobSquarePants  and @tocsoft, because it's possible to control the Configuration instances with the current API by binding them to Image<T> instances at initalization.\nTheir opinion is that it should be good enough for 1.0, mine is that we can add more flexibility with this feature. (IImageProcessingContext<T>.Configuration > Image<T>.Configuration > Configuration.Default)\nI think a community PR won't do any harm here, because it won't distract the core team from our main priorities. @JimBobSquarePants @tocsoft thoughts?. @JimBobSquarePants you're right, I think I will defer my detailed perf. article until we make premultiplication optional or maybe even until #642 is implemented.\nNevertheless, we can merge this, and extend the bechmark later, when the premultiplication switch is available.. @Felixking this is solved in beta4, and won't work with earlier versions because of API changes in System.Memory.\nIf you need help upgrading, please join our gitter channel and ask your questions here! Mutate() is member of the SixLabors.ImageSharp.Processing namespace. Check out our API docs for other specific processing extension methods.. @Felixking the library is quite stable for most cases, but there is still a lot to do before we can leave the pre-release state: https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/milestones\nEg. API changes, like simplification of namespeces to improve API discoverability for users without ReSharper :smile: (This is expected for beta5). What's going on in AppVeyorLand again? \ud83d\ude1e . @tocsoft just implemented your suggestion, check out the new sample test case.\nThis should allow implementing a powerful interop library.\n@JimBobSquarePants @tocsoft be aware that we are throwing InvalidOperationException when someone tries to mutate + resize an image instance that wraps an existing memory. (Which is kinda fine in such an advanced scenario IMO). @eat-sleep-code  please check our intro docs about our packages:\nhttps://sixlabors.github.io/docs/articles/intro.html\n. @JimBobSquarePants it's unfortunate that I can only comment on your changes here. If we want to publish the API, we need a full review here including the work of JBildstein.\nGonna try to be more specific:\n- This allocation is performed for each pixel, when called through the bulk conversion method. We can (and should) avoid this.\n- It's possible to execute these comparisons only once per bulk-conversion\n- The validation and the white point equality comparison should be also performed only once, when we are doing bulk conversion.\n- \u2191\u2191\u2191 Same for all color spaces!\n- If we do the previous refactors, it should enable Adapt(span, span) and ChromaticAdaptation.Transform(span, span) overloads\nGenerally speaking, what we need is to make sure that the bulk conversion API-s are real optimization enablers by:\n- Making sure certain operations are performed only once if we do bulk conversion (or such an optimization is possible in the future without API change)\n- Making sure the API and the design is prepared for adapting SIMD optimizations in the future (eg. converting multiple colors in a single step with AVX2 etc.)\nI still have the feeling that an unused abstraction (IColorConversion<TFrom, TResult>) is a code smell, and we should get rid of it, while real abstractions should include bulk variants. (Or at least we should validate, it's possible to introduce them without public API changes.). > My concern with moving the comparison and validation code out of the loop is that there is then no way to enforce that the output is the expected one when a span of CieXyz structs with varying whitepoint values is passed to the bulk method.\nCorrect me if I'm missing something, but it looks to me that it's not possible to have varying white points here. The result of the expression !this.whitePoint.Equals(this.targetLabWhitePoint) && this.performChromaticAdaptation only depends on parameters known at construction time. We can even cache this bool inside the constructor!. @JimBobSquarePants Now I can't see any technical issue about adding the following bulk method to IChromaticAdaptation:\nC#\nvoid Transform(Span<CieXyz> sourceColors, Span<CieXyz> destColors, CieXyz sourceWhitePoint, in CieXyz targetWhitePoint);\nThis way we can enable optimized bulk-conversion, but this may lead to API changes (just as I expected), because we need a MemoryAllocator<T> for the creation of temporary buffers. We can pass a Configuration instance to ColorSpaceConverter for this.\nDo you want me to push these changes?. Accidentally pushed Guard / DebugGuard changes here :. I guess we mean the same: Initial conversion could be done in a bulk way into a temporary buffer.\nWith ColorSpaceConverterOptions now we have the flexibility to add this later. I also consider it a time consuming, and low priority task, I just wanted the API to be future proof.. @JimBobSquarePants hope you are happy with the changes I just pushed.. @chrischip can you register the email address associated your first commit on GitHub?\n@JimBobSquarePants is it possible to dismiss CLAassistant for this PR?. Related piece of docs:\nhttps://sixlabors.github.io/docs/articles/intro.html. @jherby2k in our current design Image<T> does not preserve the bit rate / color model of the original encoded data.. The new ImageSharp.Web beta package will be released in the next few days.. It's cool to see that we conform to a spec from a standard. Great job!. Why do we even try adding duplicates? Maybe we should just remove that part of code.. My guess is that it's most likely a SixLabors.Fonts issue. An isolated/simplified, glyph-level reproduction would help a lot.\n@tocsoft any idea what goes wrong & why it's more visible with this font?\n. @TodesBrot is this an ICO-specific use case? Or do you know other cases where a BMP stream is provided without a header?. @JimBobSquarePants good job, I think we can merge this. Thanks to your patience, it's way much better now than the original proposal!. @JimBobSquarePants I don't think MemoryAllocator should be a clonable object. It's a good question whether we should clone Configuration when cloning an image. When a user is working with Configuration.Default, having several instances != Configuration.Default after doing a DeepClone on an Image<T> would be an unexpected side effect in the majority of the cases.\nSo in the end we have this complicated issue:\n- Configuration should be Deep Clonable\n- When deep copying an Image<T>, majority of the users probably do not want to copy Configuration (and they for sure do not want to deep clone MemoryAllocator!), but maybe some users intentionally need it.\nIt's a general issue with the concept of cloning. How deep should it be? It always depends on the context & the use case. I used to solve this with a rather complex pattern:\n```C#\npublic interface IDuplicationContext\n{\n    // can hook any logic here\n    // eg. track complex object graphs with loops, or enforce shallow copy at certain points\n    T Duplicate(T source); \n}\npublic interface IDuplicatable\n{\n    object Duplicate(IDuplicationContext ctx);\n}\npublic class SimplestPossibleDuplicationContext : IDuplicationContext\n{\n    public T Duplicate(T source)\n    {\n        if (T is IDuplicatable dup) return (T)dup.Duplicate(this);\n        return source;\n    }\n}\npublic class Head : IDuplicatable\n{\n    public object Duplicate(IDuplicationContext ctx) { .... }\n}\npublic class Cat : IDuplicatable\n{\n    public Head Head { get; private set; }\n    public int Legs { get; private set; }\npublic object Duplicate(IDuplicationContext ctx)\n{\n    Cat clone = new Cat();\n    clone.Head = ctx.Duplicate(this.Head);\n    clone.Legs = this.Legs;\n    return clone;\n}\n\n}\n```\nGood question if we can keep it simple, avoiding stuff like this? Or can we somehow simplify the concept of deep cloning without users experiencing unwanted side effects?. Yeah, looks like the solution is that Image<T> should not be IDeepCloneable. image.Clone() should do a deep copy of all the metadata however. (Which seems to be already implemented based on the code changes.). @JimBobSquarePants all fixed!. Yeah hex is better for this purpose. Ok, actually this might be good, I haven't noticed the new optimized bulk implementations!\nSo never mind my comment regarding dp.PackFromScaledVector4(sp.ToScaledVector4());! Gonna have a second look on Thursday.. @JimBobSquarePants in this benchmark I emulated a scenario which is similar to the ToRgba32() stuff happening in PNG encoder, and certain processors (eg. Binarization, Dithering).\nIt turns out, that even in these cases the retval version is significantly slower.\nAlso benchmarked ToVector4() - same stuff, with less difference. I can't really explain this, but we should change to a CopyTo(ref ...) style API in both cases.\nThe question is when? We have two options:\n1. Change it in this PR, open issue for ToVector4(). Milestone: RC1 (API change)\n2. Merge this PR, open issue for both ToRgba32() and ToVector4(). Milestone: RC1 (API change, perf regression!). One possible explanation is that JIT is not capable for Return value optimization in most cases.\n~Do you mean also finishing up the Vector4 stuff here?`~ Should/can we split the work somehow?\nEdit:\nJust noticed your edit on Vector4. @JimBobSquarePants my feeling is that it would be much simpler to merge this as is, right after #742 and carry out all my proposed API changes together in a new PR.. Is something wrong with GitHub at the moment?\nThe status checks are not being updated + the git changelog I see with my client is out of sync with the stuff presented on GitHub web.\n\n. Is something wrong with GitHub at the moment?\nThe status checks are not being updated + the git changelog I see with my client is out of sync with the stuff presented on GitHub web.\n\n. @JimBobSquarePants any idea how to ping the CLA assistant? Pressing \"Recheck PR-s\" on it's UI did not help.. OK, it seem there are still issues with service availability, let's check again after a few hours.. ResizeProcessor's current CPU sampling profile:\n\n. I'm closing this, because it turned out that conversion to SOA buffers so ineffective without shuffling intrinsics, that it renders the whole thing unworthy for now.\nWe should replan this stuff when the experiments with .NET core 3.0 and the new intrinsics are started.\nI hope it's still possible to close the performance gap with optimizations like #768.. I'm not saying we are happy about this, but that Microsoft recommendation is a game changer. We should definitely do this now, maybe for RC1 already.. @JimBobSquarePants @dlemstra all findings were addressed. Gonna merge this as soon as the compilation is finished so we can go on with #729.. @iamcarbon in my original proposal I supposed that the spannified stream API's are also available on .NET FW 4.7.2, but looks like the full unification is out of scope until .NET Standard 2.1 :(. @Horusiath I don't think we ever advertised ImageSharp as a \"high performance library\", I would rather say it's a continously evolving library.\nI really hope, that for the final 1.0 release we will be able to close the performance gap compared to System.Drawing, which is a theoretical limit with the current RyuJIT capabilities. The integration of dotnet/corefx#22940 into .NET Core 3.0 / .NET Framework 4.8 will open up new opportunities in the future. \nPlease note that just about 2 years ago we started from being 10-20x slower, and we achieved these improvements working in our free time. We are investigating the possibilities to find a sustainable business model to fund the project, so we can invest more time into the performance improvements.. And of course the remarks on Mutate and Dispose are valid!. System.Numerics.Vectors is a limited subset. We miss operations as basic as shuffle or shifting(<<, >>) .. @Horusiath FYI my benchmark results for a very similar scenario, downscaling and resaving a 2048 x 1536 Jpeg to 512 x 384.\nThese results are a bit better than yours, here is a speculative explanation:\nWe probably perform better on high-end CPU-s operating on high frequencies, because this setup is accelerating the effect of Intel's state-of-art AVX2 implementations. It is very likely that the GDI+ Drawing  API-s do not utilize the newest SIMD instructions, because by benchmarking only Resize, it looks like we are already faster than System.Drawing.\nOn the other hand, the GDI+ jpeg codecs beat us because they are powered by WIC as backend.. I also needed to browse corefx code for hours. Everything is based on Levi Boderick's ideas in dotnet/corefx#26303.. @dmanning23 those old versions are no longer supported in any way, and will never work after the recent changes in dotnet runtimes and libraries.\nSince we are still in development phase (haven't reached 1.0 yet), we can only help if you are using the newest beta or dev/myget version. If you are experiencing performance regressions, you should open an issue describing your performance problem with detailed explanation + benchmarks.. @dmanning23 check out the URL @JimBobSquarePants linked in his answer. The feed you linked is from the Mesozoic Era, everything has been published under F/sixlabors in the last 2 years.  I really hope none of our docs does reference it any longer.. I have a feeling that when we fix such bugs, we always have to add end-to-end regression tests with a test image, even if a unit test has been added based on the root cause.\n@JimBobSquarePants @dlemstra am I overthinking?. @JimBobSquarePants should we merge this then?. @tocsoft I pushed a minor typo-fix/cleanup commit.\nBuilds are failing because the tolerance is too strict now. Should I change it?\nI'm also happy to push some regression tests based on the information in #685, I'm just not sure about the availability of the \"Baskerville Old Face\" system font. Is it always present on Windows OS?. > I want to simply pass something like 2% and if the image is more than 2% different then it fails.\nBasically, this is what ImageComparer.TolerantPercentage(...) is giving to you. I just wanted to describe a mathematically exact definition for this. The point is that it's suming up both the number of different pixels and the amount of difference.. @JimBobSquarePants actually, we can simplify the comparison and the way we parameterize it by rebasing it on scaled Vector4 pixel values.. @tocsoft if we allow higher differences with AccuracyMultiple = 2 the \"wandering\" is visually well visible on the output images (check the images in my comment). \nThe smaller the reported difference is, the more correct the output feels, so I think the difference ratio is a good quantitative value to benchmark output correctness.. Or maybe I'm missing the point of your comment? \ud83d\ude15 . Depends on how vicious your test is. The users reporting these issues are usually rendering full pages of text, so I created a full page output in my test case.\n6th line was kinda Ok. But I wasn't happy with the 7th line:\n\nThe strangest thing to me that correct/incorrect lines were repeated cyclically.. Anything against merging this now?. @dmanning23 if you experienced better performance in earlier versions, it's most likely because we used a different quantizer as default. (@JimBobSquarePants: was it WuQuantizer?)\nYou can try setting a different quantizer. By tuning GifEncoder and quantizer parameters it might be possible to find a reasonalbe tradeoff for image quality VS encoder speed.\nLack of SIMD support on Xamarin is a big blocker for performance improvements on mobile, but gif is somewhat special, because  the current OctreeQuantizer implementation is sub-optimal in general. We should improve this,  but this is a huge task, and it is unlikely we can manage it before 1.0.\n. @JimBobSquarePants there was a statement in #752 about an old alpha being faster than later releases. It might be of course inaccurate, but I reacted to that in my comment.\nOctreeQuantizer is good stuff but there are big optimization oppurtunities for it (based on benchmarks I did earlier + my understanding of the code). I'm not sure how does it compare to other quantizers, it was just a hint to try them, but I may be wrong.. It seems to me that you are facing this specific limiatation.\n@dmanning23 can you try a little experiment for us?\n1. Create an application referencing the dev/MyGet version of ImageSharp and System.Memory, that does nothing else but\n2. PixelOperations<Bgra32> operations = PixelOperations<Bgra32>.Instance\n3. Invoke something like this method on the instance created in (2.), using reflection. \nNotes: \n    - reflection is needed because the method is internal\n    - to get an instance to Span<T> you can use the extension method array.AsSpan()\n    - Span<T> is implictily convertible to ReadOnlySpan<T>)\n. @dmanning23 as @JimBobSquarePants mentioned, there are no Xamarin devs in the core team, but I have a few more ideas to try, if it's possible for you to use a manually built version of ImageSharp. . > and set the alpha component to fully opaque for any pixel that does not match the value contained within the chunk\nBut what happens when we encounter pixels matching the value? Do we decode fully transparent pixels in those cases? \nDo we alter transparent pixels to chunk-defined pixels when encoding?. @devedse input images for decoder tests.. @dmanning thanks for this contribution! If it works for you I would say it's fine. \nOne minor thing: I know there is no good way for testing this stuff without adding an AOT target in our CI, but I would feel more safe if there were unit tests which at least make sure these methods can be inoked without causing trouble. (Eg Exceptions). @JimBobSquarePants @dmanning23 just one other thing:\nHow about \u02dbrenaming AotCompiler to AotCompilerTools? (More correct semantics I guess.). Yeah I've been working on this a lot, almost all evenings during the last week. My next move is to apply similar basic refactors to ResizeProcessor before dismounting the whole thing.. @metscore this issue seems to be a duplicate of #636.\nThere is already a discussion analyzing root causes. Please let us know about your thoughts/ideas on that thread!. Btw we plan to fix the issue for RC1. Updates will be posted on #636!. @JimBobSquarePants I will review this during the weekend.. @JimBobSquarePants one other API suggestion (which is pretty much related to my previous suggestions):\nAsking the user to feed the source image size to Transform Builders seems unnecessary to me. The size is available on IImageProcessingContext<T> when a transform is being applied. We can prepend it to the matrix created by the Transform Builders. This will simplify the API usage on consumer side, and allow more flexibility.. @JimBobSquarePants OK, how about this:\nI push some more tests + extend the projective API right now, you deal with the rest?\nHow about the method namings? Should I change them? Still feel the word Matrix is unnecessary in method names, and it will become somewhat outdated if we shift to the matrix factory design.. @JimBobSquarePants I also implemented my size-decoupling idea within the Affine API-s, but this is all for today. Projective API-s still need to be adapted. \nAnd we still may want to find a workaround for the .NET 4.6.2 issue, however it's debug-only. (I think it is Vector2 tricking us again.). @JimBobSquarePants checking it now. Is the issue reproducible on your PC? (.NET 4.6.2/4.7.2 test execution + Debug). @JimBobSquarePants for me it still fails.\nWe either should do the Vector2 -> Vector4 workaround, or leave a note somewhere in the contribution guide that Debug test execution is only supported on .NET Core 2.1.. @JimBobSquarePants what is still missing:\n- Unit Tests for TransformUtils: Should test the created transformations for correctness using sample input points paired with expected transformed destination points. I would say this is critical, but maybe I can live without it, if we can't do it now.\n- Skew in ProjectiveTransformBuilder (Could be added in a follow up PR)\n- Unit tests for AppendSkew: Similar to rotation tests: we should test that the transformation being appended/prepended is the same transformation that is produced by TransformUtils. (Less critical, could be added in a follow up PR). Opend #780 to \"deal\" with the Debug mode issues, we probalby shouldn't bother working around this in product code any longer.\nI don't want to be too hard at this PR, up to you to decide. I'm just trying to save our future selves from writing these tests when we touch the code again \ud83d\ude04. @vicfergar I wonder how should we extend the AOT seeding utility introduced in #767 to make this work.\nWe lack both the knowledge and the time to investigate this, so any hints from the community would be very helpful.. @johnnyoshika in our readme or in our docs you can read about accessing our official myget/nuget feeds.\nThe links above contained versions, which were outdated a long time ago, those versions were not supported in any form in the past 1.5-2 years, it was time to delete the feeds.. @johnnyoshika our apologies, thank you for informing us!. @JimBobSquarePants I also have executed the benchmarks and the results are very similar (almost no  speedup for Core, significant speedup for classic Clr).\nI had to apply huge hacks on my system due to live audio latency issues, and it behaves somewhat slower now for high CPU load benchmarks, making my old results no longer applicable as baseline.. @JimBobSquarePants managed to improve my comments a bit.\nActually, the main reason behind this PR is that I realized I can AVX2-optimize the convolution. For that we need to widen all kernel values from float to Vector4. With the original implementation the kernel map would grow too big in memory. With this optimization it should be tolerable for the majority of the cases. (Except when sourceLength or destinationLength is a large prime, having no common divisor, but I think this is usually not true for real life cases.). I'm merging this, so I can push the next PR from my queue. Thanks for the review!. @JimBobSquarePants then we should find or generate 12 bit test jpegs for all the colorspaces, the feature is only partially tested otherwise!\nWe can decode the reference output with the ImageMagick reference decoder. The encoder could be implemented/tested separately.. Ok, this means that those aren't real use cases on pure statistical basis, so we can leave them untested.\nStandard meets reality.. I the improvement opportunities I mentioned are still there (introducing an enum for 8bit/12bit, test cases for 12 bit color conversion), but let's just merge this as-is, and do the improvements later!. It was a typical intermittent test failure, related to test-only code. Restarting the build helped.. A reminder that I should add AutoOrient to our FAQ TODO list in #411.. @SaltyDH cool that you are interested in this! :)\nUnfortunately, these classes are kinda messy, and need a lot of refactor before making them public. We can only take care of this past 1.0.. @dmanning23 thanks for investigating this!\nI think we will drop those methods from the public API before 1.0. \n/cc @swoolcock . Re Matrix5x4:\n- Multiplication and identity actually makes sense if Matrix5x4 is an optimized form for a Matrix5x5 having an invariant (0,0,0,0,1) row/column the same way as Matrix3x2 is really just an optimized Matrix3x3.\n- We may consider renaming it to ColorMatrix and keep it inside the bounds of ImageSharp. > I don't think it has any practical application outside of ImageSharp.\nIf we keep the class within the bounds of ImageSharp, and only use it only for colorspace transformations, it makes the most sense to name it ColorMatrix. Fight me! \ud83d\ude04\n(The rest of my findings are obsolete.). I'm not sure whether there are more performance-related bits which are not covered by the text in #808, #809 and #642.\nIf not, we can close this issue in favor of those.. Ok, actually opened #810 for the SIMD bits of #808, however we should address them together. @CoenraadS I'm closing this in favor of the specific issues, but let me know if I'm missing something!. @michasacuer great news! Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . Looks like an AOT compilation issue to me, similar to the mono/Xamarin ones.\nI wonder whether the workaround we provided in #767 and #785 helps.. Looks good so far!. @Metalnem what is the simplest way to produce malformed input for a given format? Is my understanding correct that I need to learn afl-fuzz for this?. @Sergio0694 unfortunately, certain sporadic errors are common, this has nothing to do with your commit. Just triggered the failing build again.. @Sergio0694 I'm not very proficient with color filters, let's wait for @JimBobSquarePants 's answer.. @kgrosvenor yes it it should be AFAIK. Please upgrade to the latest beta!\nIf you still experience issues, please join our gitter channel for discussions.. Strictly speaking: not. But: JpegEncoderCore still has to be refactored to use Block8x8F, and it's more safe to do it in 2 steps, as described in the comment. I think it would be better to remove it (together with the old Blockclass), when JpegEncoderCore refactor is finished.\nOr we can keep it in a different repository/branch.. Definetly. It IS source code. It's common to keep T4 templates in the repository.\nsee: (System/Numerics/Vector.tt). I think the purpose of these functions is simple. (e.g. transposing the block) I will try to add some comments here.\nA few words about the implementation: \nThe methods are unrolled loops that work on a constant-sized (8x8) block. In C# it's typically faster to access fields of a struct, than array indexing or unsafe+pointers. (See: Matrix classes in XNA or WPF)\nFirst I started to implement these methods by hand, but quicky realized that I will go faster with T4, and the code will be more reliable. It's also easier to maintain & understand the T4 metaprogram, than the bloated output code.. To be honest, I only understand about 10% of the whole Jpeg decoding stuff. I don't even know what's happening inside the DCT implementation methods. I'm just trying to figure out what are the building blocks of the algorithm, and refactoring the code to make the blocks run faster.\nMaybe in the future I will will dive into the theoretical details in order to port libjpeg-turbo.. Hopefully. However, the main purpose would be to have a code more conform to the style of the new fancy super-fast .NET API-s.\nI think Span<T> would be very useful for the whole ImageSharp project. (Simplify existing code, integrate into the forecoming System.IO.Pipelines API.). Yeah definately :). I think we need Block8x8F here. JpegEncoderCore should be refactored to use it instead of the old Block class.. Good question. There are many arguments for and against.\nI could not figure out how to run dotTrace against BenchmarkDotNet benchmarks easily, while there is a straightforward way to profile unit tests. If performance is a long term goal, it's important to make profiling as easy as unit testing. \nIs there any R# support for BenchmarkDotNet?. I'll try my best :). After :(\nI don't have the time for that in the next 2-3 weeks.. Maybe we can develop an xUnit extension that uses BenchmarkDotNet internally, or at least helps eliminating the boilerplate code.. could not figure out where's the conflict now, can you help me?. +1 for adding this. I'm also unable to compile without the specific version. (Have VS2017 & VS2015 udpate3 & newest netcore tools installed). OMG :S Thanks for pointing this out! :+1: . Many components of the processors could be tested this way. Unfortunately I'm not yet familiar with their code.. http://devopsreactions.tumblr.com/post/109288736875/useful-code-snippet. The BMP output  differs from the input Jpeg with with several pixel formats. I don't know if it's a pixel type  specific \"feature\", or a bug. Decoders/encoders should be covered better somehow, but it's a longer discussion.. Slow:\npublic unsafe float this[int idx]\n{\n    [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)]\n    get\n    {\n        fixed (Block8x8F* p = &this)\n        {\n            float* fp = (float*)p;\n            return fp[idx];\n        }\n    }\n}\nFast:\n[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)]\npublic static unsafe float GetScalarAt(Block8x8F* blockPtr, int idx)\n{\n    float* fp = (float*)blockPtr;\n    return fp[idx];\n}\nThere's no need to fix the block if it's on the stack, or if it's an element of an already-fixed heap object. Unfortunately the only way to \"express\" this in C# is to have a static method that takes Block8x8F* :(. \nHuffmanTree should be a class in a \"normal\" C# code. I made it to be a struct because I wanted to improve data locality by removing the \"array of objects\" memory structure in JpegDecoderCore.huffmanTrees.\nHuffmanTree has lots of members, so copying it inside a nested loop would slow down the code at a noticable level.. But:\nProcessDefineHuffmanTablesMarkerLoop() should be really moved to HuffmannTree. I'm already working on a decoder code cleanup to enable further optimizations. I will take care of this too. Thanks for noticing the anomaly! :). Image != Image<Color>, because it creates PixelAccessor instead of PixelAccessor<Color>, which has different method overloads.\nDistinguishing between them in test cases results in increased test coverage. There is PixelTypes.StandardImageClass VS PixelTypes.Color to do this. ImageFactory : GenericFactory<Color> serves the StandardImageClass case, so not returning new Image<Color>(other) is the purpose of this override.. LOL. I'm working with xUnit since 1.5 years, and I haven't noticed this overload yet :D. R# StyleCop \"cleanup\" analyzer, you had one job!\nNot using it: I have to manually find all the trailing whitespaces & other stuff StyleCop doesn't like.\nUsing it: I get these \"fine\" cleanups.\nI think the good old find&replace could help here.. In most of the cases this is my rule too, but:\n1. Style(Killer)Cop places this method at a random place in JpegEncoderCore. I have to scroll up & down, impossible to oversee the code :(\n2. JpegEncoderCore has still too much code. If certain parts are members of static utility classes, it makes things easier for a future split-up/refactor.. Good news: It might be refactored out of the encoder, because the decoder also has some cases, when it could be better to have a Block8x8F X 4 value type, than a new  Block8x8F[4] array.. This work is in progress for the decoder, I will describe all the details in my forcoming PR in comments & .MD. \nThe changes I want to implement in the encoder will follow the same logic. . StyleCop extension again. At least I managed to remove the extra spaces here :D. Dat controversial var. With simple types I dont like it either. With complex types ... I will refactor it for consistency :)\nSometimes I introduce vars unintentionally with R#. @JimBobSquarePants @dlemstra \nint width = Math.Min(area.Width, this.Width - targetX);\nint height = Math.Min(area.Height, this.Height - targetY);\nThis will be calculated 2X then. It seems wasteful to me & also seems to be a code smell. It's not the only thing I don't like about the design of the current PixelArea <--> PixelAccessor and other copying solutions. The switch statements on ComponentOrder are very inefficient perf killers.\nIt's not the right time to change the design however, so now I will re-enable the check and duplicate code on the call site, but we should definitely come back to rethink this.. https://github.com/antonfirsov/ImageSharp/blob/jpeg-optimizations/src/ImageSharp/Formats/Jpg/JpegEncoderCore.cs#L459. I'm afraid, using ArrayPool<T>.Shared is not the best for this library. Sample issue: What if you exceed the maximum size with large images?\nI used it here because I was \"lazy\" to find the best solution for PixelArea\u02db. In such cases defining an extra indirection level could be useful for a future refactor. I will leave a comment about this.. Much better! This will add instant perf boost to non-Color pixel type code using IPackedBytes.ToBytes(). Lots of refactor work however, Maybe I can take care of this later.. Yeah, but I still don't like the idea of controlling a major aspect of a class with a bool parameter. It was a lazy solution from my side, I'd like to see something like PixelArea<T>.CreateWithRentedBuffer() instead. What do you think?. The methods returning MutableSpan<T> are not \"spanny\", need to refactor them. (Next time, if possible.). @dlemstra @JimBobSquarePants  regarding CheckDimensions:\nI made this hack to conform to the current dimension-checking API definition of CopyTo().\nIt's like if you defined Array.Copy() to throw an exception with Array.Copy(src, dest, 0). There are reasons .NET guys have not chosen this definition :). Really need to sleep, just made the field readonly for now :( Actually using a rented buffer could be the default behavior, if Bytes is not coming from the outside, but I wanted to keep the existing Gif & Png code safe. Confused now, we have to think this over later.. I intentionally wanted to keep it similar to the original C++ code. Even it's mistakes can serve as documentation if someone ever goes into DCT implementation details. This is not the core codebase, it's here for testing & documentation.. I like explicit things better, when possible. Lazy loads are for the case, where you don't want to think about lifecycle, letting it \"just happen\" :smile: . It really doesn't matter with the frequency JpegDecoderCore instances are created. Actually this should be an on-stack buffer in the future. Don't want to early-optimize this now.. Kill 'Em All!. Is it really a robust solution to have this kind of \"stringly typed\" assertions? Instead of these long test cases wouldn't it be better to have multiple short AAA-style tests?. For bootstrapping the test framework, I think it's good enough for now.\nHowever, we need to find a more straightforward way for registration when #64 is finished. I think most of the users would vote for a .RegisterAllKnownFormats() extension method. (No idea how could we make it)\n. Yeah, It's pretty straightforward to do this, but having an extra dll sitting on the top of all the other dll-s is raping the nice modularization system :D\nI would rather use :bat:Reflection:bat: for this. (We are talking about an optional utility class!). We can refactor them later then :). ... and it can introduce unwanted asmloadexceptions. I don't want this, I want something smarter :) Will think about this!. Ooops .. I forgot to remove this from my previous PR. I will change this to ImageSharp.Sandbox46 with #66. The metadata/copyright parts are pretty the same for all the AssemblyInfo.cs-s. Don't we need a solution level AssemblyInfo.Common.cs for these parts? Is it possible with project.json?. It's very practical to have this method, but I don't like the idea of having a whole package for this, messing up the dependency graph.\nI'd rather define a simple, convention based utility which is placed in ImageSharp.dll, and uses reflection without enumerating / loading all the dll-s, only looks for ImageSharp core modules.. :+1:  for the idea of having this \"smart autoconfiguration\"\nI think it would be better to have this code in a  static Configuration.CreateDefaultInstance() method instead of a parametric base constructor.. @dlemstra these are non-throwing checks, while AddImageFormat() throws an exception when something is missing. I see no straightforward way to refactor this without catching first-chance exceptions on normal execution path.. @JimBobSquarePants do you want to StyleCop test projects with the current SC rules? :cry: \nKeep in mind, that the current actual code coverage of this project is very low. The ~80% coverage shown by codecov is brought mostly by \"integration\" tests executing everything on every image without any automatic assertions. These are not unit tests. If you remove this cheat from the coverage metric, the results will be very disappointing.\nUnit tests should be small, self-documenting pieces of code with a very low barrier to entry for writing them to encourage developers to write more and more of them. By forcing to xml-doc everything, and forcing developers to focus on formatting details, you will discourage people to do TDD!\nJust look at corefx test code. There are no xml docs at all. And these are Microsoft people spending their job time to write them. How can you expect people who are spending their free time for this project to do an extra +30% work of formatting & \"documenting\" test cases? (Well-named, clean AAA test cases are already documented!)\nI'm happy to add some comments on non trivial parts, specially if asked for. But making a general overrestricted rule from this, overseen by dumb robots will be a crime against TDD & will act against the goal of having more real code coverage.\nTDD is my main methodology to develop software, and I think I'm not alone with this. I strongly disagree with this idea :(\n. > they need to be cleaner, conform to a basic set of rules and naming standards and be instantly obvious what they are testing.\nAgreed. There are many test classes being non-conform to the basic formatting rules of the library, and this is not good. I just wanted to warn, that simply copy-pasting the default StyleCop behavior to the tests would be harmful to the project. \nShouldn't we open a discussion about this? Or as an alternative you can just be a Wise and Merciful Dictator, and everything should be OK :laughing: . You are always using a maxIntersections-sized buffer. It would be safer to move the buffer & the renting outside the using block and the loop. It's also wise to have try {} finally{} around rented buffers.. Cool to have this delegatele-free quicksort!\nHowever, there is some bloated code around with X/Y. @JimBobSquarePants  I think we should consider using T4 for this, or for stuff like IPackedBytes.ToYxzwqp() implementations. I'm definitely sure, there will be more of this!. + I think it makes no sense to use Vector2 here. For brushes you are casting int-s to cast them back to float-s. It's expensive. Maybe it's better to turn PointInfo.SearchPoint into a Point instead\n+ Need to profile code, but I'm quite sure we can make significant performance gain relatively cheaply by having a batched \"big brother\" of GetColor for brushes:\npublic virtual void PopulateRow(int y, int fromX, int toX, Span<TColor> destination)\nMaybe this story is about a future PR.\n. Apologies, shouldn't review code late in the night :smile:. Maybe this is not the best example to \"lobby\" for T4. However in more complex cases we can use it as a replacement for OO & functional abstractions to apply the DRY principle. \nUnfortunately this is the simpliest tool for this in the .NET world at the moment.. ref returns won't help too much if we use them with abstract methods here. We really shouldn't have abstract methods operating on per-pixel granularity. It's a massive cache-efficiency killer on a hot (burning!) execution path.\nI'm thinking on sane ways to enable this optimization technique in ImageSharp. If it gets it's way into the library, hope we will be able to bring it into SixLabors.Shapes too, so we can boost ImageSharp drawing perf.. I wonder why do we silently ignore <=0 values instead of throwing an exception. Is this some kind of standard imaging behavior I don't know about? :). I really believe that unit tests are more valuable, if they contain a single AAA block / test case and have a descriptive name saying an actual Fact about the component under test. \nA little bit longer to write, easier to maintain and understand.. Wouldn't it be better to move this method into ExifProfile and use it as this.ExifProfile?.Sync(this)?. I also think corefx tests show a good example, I strongly support following their standard:\n- One test case is testing only one aspect of a \"thing\" (proving one fact), no long test cases containing multiple AAA blocks\n- All facts/theories have a descriptive name, no need for additional comments\n- If the fact (to be proven by the test) is coplex enough, it's encouraged to use underscores in it's name to improve readability.. It seems to be a Profile-concern to sync it from an ImageMetadata.. float[][] is still crazy slow. We need at least something like this. \nEven better to have simple on-stack value types for these small matrices. (Need to invent a trick for this).. Hmm, this has nothing to do with the Dithering. \nI think we need a benchmark measuring the perf effects of switching quantizers. OctreeQuantizer seemed to be really slow when I tested it with Gif.\nCertainly a winner in quality though.. @JimBobSquarePants why are you using byte-s here? I think perf would be much better with floats.\nI also keep promoting my idea to flatten these arrays.\n. I just wondered why did you change PngDecoder in the Dithering PR :)\nBut at least it helped to notice this change :)\nI made this benchmark a month ago:\nMethod | InputCategory |          Mean |   Scaled | Scaled-StdDev | Allocated |\n------------------------------------- |-------------- |-------------- |--------- |-------------- |---------- |\n     'EncodeGifMultiple - ImageSharp' |     AllImages | 8,283.9980 ms | 3,691.26 |          0.00 |  72.11 MB |\n 'EncodeGifMultiple - System.Drawing' |     AllImages |     2.2442 ms |     1.00 |          0.00 |   3.22 MB |\nOk, it's running on multiple Gif frames, while in PNG we have only one, but still very strange.. Flat arrays make CPU caches happy!. Ehh not getting answers on discussions if I don't keep pressing F5. \nIt's too late here to write working code :( I can do it next time. Will sketch BulkOperations instead, keep your eyes on gitter ;). The generic version does not seem to provide any kind of useful polymorphic behaviour to me. Looks like a legacy concept even in monogame. Having interfaces only to enforce signature (not for the sake of polymorphism) ...  not my favorite practice. . Browsing it online it seemed to me they use the generic interface only in reflection code. Have not checked with VS yet. . Yeah IPngEncoderOptions.Quantizer is not used in PngEncoderCore!. When build the lib on Windows this would be simply ignored, while building on Linux will download the necessary binaries, right? Some NuGet expert could clarify this to me :). @JimBobSquarePants does this change break something? Do you know why \"tests\" was not present in the original list?. Yeah it would better to allocate only one instance. \nBulkPixelOperations is stateless + an instance is rarely requested so allocating it multiple times did not seemed to be a big issue for me.. Wouln't it be better to add a comment into IPixel.BulkOperations instead, to point the user to BulkPixelOperations<T>.Instance?\nI seems unlikely to me this will ever cause a trouble, and the current solution is much better in terms of simplicity. (StyleCop requires putting the field and the property miles away from each other, causing maintance overhead.). It's 2^14.\nNever seen an image larger than 8192*8192, so picked the next power-of-two value.. Yeah, it's defined by IPixel<T>.. The only place where PixelAccessor<T> is constructed from an outsider array is ArrayExtensions.Lock(this TColor[] pixels, int width, int height). That method is currently unused, and I don't think it's useful at all. Shouln't we remove it instead?. To be honest, I don't understand it either :D \nHere's what's happened: Tried the code in the arcticle -> works. Optimized it with SIMD -> still works.. I found out since that I can simplify this code without a perf drop.. Just run the current version of the ArrayCopy benchmark :). Empirically, using the ArrayCopy benchmark.\nWould be nice to check it on other machines / architectures / frameworks though.. Yeah. PixelDataPool<T>.Dirty saves 25% inToVector4SimdAligned().\nI suppose the cleaning implementation in ArrayPool is suboptimal, maybe we shouldn't use it at all, and do PinnedBuffer.Clean() instead.. @JimBobSquarePants I can investigate this as part of this PR.. If you want to understand this stuff, you need to dig yourself into IEEE specs, and counting bits on paper. Alternatively, we can just accept it works, like we did with the DCT implementation. \nIts like accepting a complex math thesis and not bothering with the proof. \nThis implementation could be replaced in the future using new Vector API-s.. Okkay, it's a static class again, no longer clearing, we can call explicit clear methods instead:\n- ImageBase<T>.ClearPixels()\n- PinnedBuffer<T>.Clear()\n- ArrayPointer<T>.Clear(int). Yeah, all this mess could be replaced with a simple Widen() --> ConvertToSingle() chain.. These .csproj-s no longer exist, we should delete outdated references.\nAlso: we should remove the old .dll references in this project, and make sure everything works with the new netstandard project references. (I also can do this, but I need to update my VS2017 first..). I think we can't assume that the TIFF image starts at the beginning of the stream. (Or at least we don't do this in other codecs.). Isn't it possible to do buffered read without allocating new arrays? \nYou can store them as pre-allocated members, if the arrays are expected to have a known upper limit. If the limit is not known and/or or the arrays are too big, we should introduce the following utility class to reuse buffers:\n```C#\nclass AutoGrowBuffer : IDisposable\n{\n    private PinnedBuffer currentBuffer;\n    public AutoGrowBuffer(int initialSize)\n    {\n        this.currentBuffer = new PinnedBuffer(initialSize);\n    }\n// BufferSpan<T> should be very similar to BufferPointer<T> (or a replacement!), having a Length property.  I will implement it, if we agree on the design.\n\npublic BufferSpan GetBufferSpan(int length)\n    {\n        if (this.currentBuffer.Array.Length < length)\n        {\n            this.currentBuffer.Dispose();\n            this.currentBuffer = new PinnedBuffer(length);\n        }\n        return new BufferSpan(this.currentBuffer, length);\n    } \npublic void Dispose()\n   {\n       this.currentBuffer .Dispose();\n   }\n}\n// USAGE:\nprivate AutoGrowBuffer signedRationalBuffer;\n// BufferSpan should be very similar to BufferPointer (or a replacement!), having a Length property.  I will implement it, if we agree on the design.\npublic BufferSpan ReadSignedRationalSpan(ref TiffIfdEntry entry)\n{\n    ....\n    BufferSpan result = this.signedRationalBuffer.GetBufferSpan(entry.Count);\n    ....\n}\n``\n/CC @JimBobSquarePants . @JimBobSquarePants has introduced several classes to deal with endianness in streams. Shouldn't we use them in Tiff decoder too?\nTheir implementations definitely need some optimization by eliminating super-frequent virtual calls, but we could follow an \"optimize once, win everywhere\" approach by using them!. I definitely <3 this approach in testing! \nI wish all our codecs were under this level of unit testing.. This is definitely a place for Span-like stuff. Better encapsulation for data-chunk operations without unecessary allocations! I think I need to turn my 'BufferPointer<T>'  into 'BufferSpan<T>'. It will be almost System.Span compatible then! . Great! We dont need to bother with uncommon cases, I just wanted to give some general hints based on the code :) . It should! Can be done withUnsafe.AsRef(ptr)`. \nThis has no effect on C# < 7 users here, because BufferPointer is internal.\nHappy you spotted this change because, I'm turning BufferPointer <T> into BufferSpan<T> at the moment. Also wanted to add this indexer, but let's merge this first then to have less conflicts :)\nBTW: ref return methods, like Unsafe.AsRef<T>(ptr) are not visible for C#6 users. It means that Span<T> indexer will be a ... VS2017-only feature!!! I have no idea how does Microsoft plan to manage this..... These ifs are distracting CPU ~branch predictors~ pipelines. Isn't it possible to solve this with pure multiplications instead? Same for PremultipliedLerp() implementation. . I think it's better to use (non-debug) Guard here for more safety. DebugGuard is useful on :fire: :fire: execution paths, like indexer implementations.. Ok, one change serious thing: PatternBrushAppicator.Apply() seems to be uncovered!. All hail @codecov-io!. No it was occasional. Could be more readable with CreateClean().. Can you add some explanation, links, etc. about how these factors work?. Seems, you will be confilcting with yourself here :(. Shouldn't this be named differently? eg. CheckSimilarity()\nIt does an assertion!. In the case of Jpeg-s we can pass a higher threshold to ImageComparer.VisualComparer().. Sometimes theory arguments work without being explicitly IXunitSerializable, sometimes they don't. \nHave you figured out the magic parts? :). I think we should aim to replace these individual pools with PinnedBuffer-s when touching different implementations along the library to centralize the buffer logic, and make future refactor work easier. \n(It won't be pinned I'm almost done removing all the pointers.). @JimBobSquarePants this line is uncovered.\nCurrently we are not able to test code on #if NETSTANDARD1_1 path. We should change our test project configuration, or drop the 1.1 target.. We have Buffer<byte> : IDisposable class now to encapsulate renting/returning and possible future memory operations.\nI think it's similar to corefxlab OwnedArray<T> or something.. This works only with Image<Rgba32>! (Our fault, the non-rgba case is not covered by tests though.)\nA general and simple way to do this conversion:\nBulkPixelOperations<TPixel>.Instance.PackFromXyzwBytes(sourceColorSpan, destByteSpan, count)\nIn case of Rgba32 it will delegate to an optimized memory copy call.. Nevermind this point, if you don't have time to figure it out :) I'm planning a library-wide refactor to replace all individual ArrayPool usages.. @JimBobSquarePants but you forgot to turnYCbCrTable into a fixed instance array. Currently you are initializing a static array in an instance method, which doesn't make too much sense.\nActually, this table is much bigger than Unzig, su I'm not sure if it's worth to move it's data to the stack. It might be OK in it's current form, but in this case you should turn it into a static class as @tocsoft suggests. The hybrid form is useles and confusing.. @JimBobSquarePants see my comment on RgbToYCbCrTables, the same could be applied to YCbCrToRgbTables!\nAn additional thing: it's really important to move these 4 tables into a contigous memory area.  It will reduce the chance of cache misses. You have 2 options for this:\n1. Do it like you did in RgbToYCbCrTables, and turn YCbCrToRgbTables into a static class\n2. Turn all the four static readonly int[] arrays into fixed instance arrays.\nI guess in case of YCbCrToRgbTables the second approach would be faster (no additions needed).. It's possible to eliminate these +...Offset operations.\n- If you choose to move RgbToYCbCrTables into a fixed array, split it into 8 different arrays!\n- You can also pin YCbCrTable at the beginning of the ToYCbCr() call, and move 8 pointers to a struct that could be passed to Allocate(). With my proposal this would be PixelTransform<TPixel, TPixel> PixelTransform { get; private set; }. With my proposal, we can do PixelTransform.BulkApply(target.GetRowSpan(y), source.GetRowSpan(y), alpha) here instead the nested for loop.. Cool! My continuous typos and edits also did not help to make it understandable :). I thought your'e planning to also add single-pixel operations here. You haven't, so I have no perf-related concerns regarding pixel packing \ud83d\udc4d . I'm not familiar enough with processors, but don't we have naturally a BufferSpan<Vector4> at call site instead of BufferSpan<TPixel> in some cases? Eg. I know this is the case for certain operations of the ResizeProcessor.\nIf this is true AND our pixel functions operated on Vector4 instead of TPixel we can eliminate lots of useless packing/unpacking calls.. I think it might be worth to provide Vector4 versions for these functions.\nAdvantages:\n- We can introduce a BufferSpan<Vector4>-based bulk-composer method in pixel blender.\n- We can optimize PixelBlender.Compose(BufferSpan<T>, BufferSpan<T>, float) to use PixelOperations<T>.ToVector4(span, span) / PixelOperations<T>.FromVector4(span, span).\n- We could even use Vector4 based bulk-composer in our processors. (See my comment on PixelBlender<T>). @JimBobSquarePants a long term practical question to think about: \nI think its really worth to DRY away this kind of perf-related boilerplate in the library! Currently it's really hard to refactor this stuff. Optimization and metaprogramming are usually walking hand in hand. Unlsess someone has a better idea, we should T4 this kind of code. (AFAIK the only usable metaprogramming tool in .NET). I know this is counter-intuitive, and kills code readability, but we should not use Span<T> indexer  in this library on hot path. (Neither the official one!) It will be 30% slower on all runtimes except corefx.\nDangerousGetPinnableReference() + Unsafe.Add() FTW!\nRegarding the refactor costs of multiple functions, see my previous comment!. I meant operations like PackFromBytesXyz(byte, byte, byte). Currently BufferSpan indexer has a complicated and slow implementation (in order to correctly handle stuff like AsBytes). Unfortunately the same is true for the official \"slow span\". You cant implement a fast span without having byref members. . We get a reference (managed pointer) to the first item of the span with DangerousGetPinnableReference(), then offset it by index to return the indexed position.\nMy point is that it's enough to call DangerousGetPinnableReference() once for the whole loop. We can't implement this short-circuit inside the Span<T> itself, because private T ref referenceToStartElement is not possible in CLR. \nOnly for coreclr codebase owners for fast span implementation :). It's not that bad. Quite similar to old ASP/ASPX synthax. The only problem is the lack of builtin intellisense support.\nWanna see a real nightmare from the world of metaprogramming? Check out this!. Nevertheless, if I got the greenlight for T4 from @JimBobSquarePants, I will refactor this later (for all the implementations), so @tocsoft don't bother with it.. Yeah I also seen that, and I like it pretty much, but I'm not sure if we can trust Scripty in long term. @daveaglick is practically the only main contributor, and he seems to be pretty busy with other projects as well.. We should remove CreatePooled() / ReturnPooled() entirely, because this is an ownership/lifecycle concern. JpegDecoderCore and YCbCrImage should own (create + dispose) Buffer2D<byte> instead. \nJpegPixelArea has to be a temporal struct to manage a (sub)area of pixels owned by Buffer2D<byte>.. We are not writing to above. I have the feeling, it would be cleaner to go without ref for these variables:\nC#\nbyte above = Unsafe.Add(ref previousScanline, x);\n(ref -s are implicitly converted to non-refs). Not entirely sure on this point, but:\nWouldn't it be better to take two BufferSpan<byte> parameters in these methods, and keep the \"reference extracting\" step as an implementation detail?\nAdvantage: cleaner method declaration.\nDisadvantage: code duplication in method bodies.. It will be copied by value in all cases to make the necessary calculations. For me it feels better to do it right in the variable declaration. . Not sure if I understand this right now, I'll have another look tomorrow. If possible, I prefer span on the API-s. . Maybe we need a common naming rule for these variables. \nI have to confess that I'm also mixing stuff: sometimes I name them blahFooBarPointer, while on other places I use blahFooBarBase. This is confusing.. @JimBobSquarePants fooBarPointer suggests it's a native pointer. fooBarBaseReference seems to be the most correct name (but too verbose?).. OFF:\n@KodrAus really cool to see a Rust developer around! Learning Rust is on my long list of things I want to do one time! :). There is no need to pass bytesPerScanline as a 3rd parameter, if the scanline span had the lenght bytesPerScanline.\nCan I drop this in into this PR? I would also replace PngDecoderCore.scanLine and PngDecoderCore.previousScanline with Buffer<T>.. @JimBobSquarePants maybe DebugGuard could be enough here?. @tocsoft the problem is with the IPixel.To***Bytes() API-s. They consume an array now.\nI think we definitely need to change that, but this is a more complex topic, outside the scope of this refactor.\nTemporally we can change them to void ToXyzBytes(Span<byte> bytes, int startIndex) style, but I have an idea for a better solution :smile: . Yes, there will be perf. issues. Even with the void ToXyzBytes(Span<byte> bytes, int startIndex) version.\nThese API-s should be optimized further in terms of performance and type safety:\nWe don't want to set random bytes in a span or an array here. What we actually want is: setting a single Rgba32 /  Argb32 / Rgb24 / Arg24  structure at a certain memory location.. Still, I don't think it's a good API in it's current form. \n1. As described in this issue it can't be used with Span<T>.\n2. There are several places where we are allocating 4-sized arrays to extract RGBA values. This is neither efficient, nor type-safe.\nI wanted to propose changing this for a long time. I want to use this occasion, and @JimBobSquarePants's fresh head, so it's time for a gist! ;). @JimBobSquarePants Here it is!. I will do it soon then. Is it possible to temporally change IPixel API to consume Span<byte>+ index and rollback changes on PixelOperations<T> to use spans again? \nSeems easier to make the PixelOperations<T> rollback it in this PR, than doing it later.. I'm totally unfamiliar with the ICC stuff, and I'm not sure if it's worth to overthink it's API, but considering the fact that the API is public I think it's worth to ask a few questions:\n\nAre we sure the lazy initialization way is the best way here? For a big header it could produce an overhead on an unexpected point from the users POV (reading a property).\nIs it really a good way to expose this stuff through List<T>? Do intend it to be writable?. I see many optimization possibilities regarding the ColorSpaceConverter API. Are we sure we need it to be public for the beta/1.0?. Yeah, a general bulk conversion could be really useful in some scenarios (like Jpeg), but I see very high chance that it's also possible to optimize the simple conversion. There are chains of calls on heap object instances. There is an IColorConversion<in T, out TResult> interface implemented by stateless objects, and used 99% oft the time through the concrete instances. I'm sure it's possible to find a better way to do this. \n\nSome concreate ideas:\n- Making IColorConversion.Convert() implementations invokable through static methods. \n- Review of IChromaticAdaptation. Currently it introduces lot's of non-inlinable virtual method calls.\n- Evalute possibilities to turn some of the classes into struct-s, and play with generic constraints to make more of the invocations inlineable. Really cool to have all these new features, and the implementation is good and clean for the first iteration! :smile: \nAlso good to see it being internal for now, so we don't have to freeze it with the beta! ;). What was your goal with LoadPixelData<TPixel>(Configuration config, byte[] data, int width, int height) ? Is it meant to be a stream in TPixel format or is it meant to be a stream of Rgba32.\n\nIt's not well documented, the user needs to guess.\nIf the sourceBytes meant to have it's memory layout in TPixel format, we don't need PackFromRawBytes(). It's always a memcpy, you can just call SpanHelpers.Copy(data, buffer.Span.AsBytes(), size)\nIf sourceBytes meant to be in Rgba32, your PackFromRawBytes() implementation is wrong!\n\nPersonally I think we need the first variant here: loading byte data having identical memory layout to TPixel[]. In this case you just need to unsafe cast your byte span to TPixel span, no need for an extra copy.. I wonder if we even need the array variant of the API-s. There is an implicit cast from TPixel[] to Span<TPixel>.. NonPortableCast is your friend!. From the other hand, it's still an unknown type for many developers. @JimBobSquarePants thoughts?. Span should not be used as member in classes!\nMS is planning to provide a Roslyn analyzer to ensure this.\nI think we should change the Pixels property to return a Span<TPixel> instead having this member! There are several reasons to do this:\n\nThe \"tail\" of the pixelBuffer array is junk (extra bytes allocated by ArrayPool), so current Pixels.Length returns a random power-of-2 number unrelated to Width*Height\n\nExposing pixel data as an array won't be possible after introducing pluggable memory management. The source of the Pixels span might be unmanaged memory, an MMF buffer or anything.. We can use Buffer2D on these places, possibly replacing all usages of PixelAccessor. \nBut this change might be big enough to keep it for another PR ... Assigning it to an auto property would be the same as having it as a field, because autoprops have implicit backing fields. Spans have to be always created on the fly. . Wouldn't it be better to DRY all these Fill+Fill+CheckSimilarity calls away into a common ImageComparer.EnsureProcessorChangesAreConstrained(sourceImage, processedImage) method?. We should remove PixelTypes.StandardImageClass and replace all usages with PixelTypes.Rgba32. StandardImageClass was here to test the behaviour of the Image : Image<Color> subclass, now outdated.. Span-:policeman: says:\nSpan<T> is stack only! Should never be used as member in classes!. The situation raises an API question:\n\n\nYou can take a ReadOnlySpan<T> and copy its data into an ImageSharp.Memory.Buffer<T> inside.\n\nBut in an other overload you can take a float[] without copying anything (faster).\n\nI wonder if it's OK to implement an API having this heterogenous behaviour, or should we just ignore span for now on places like this?\nFYI: What you really need here is called ReadOnlyBuffer<T> in the future API-s. (Kind-of ReadOnlySpan<T> that can be used as member.). Don't think so. System.Buffers.Primitives looks very experimental to me.\nThe S.B.Buffer<T> and S.B.ReadOnlyBuffer<T> structs are really simple cousins of Span<T>, but the other stuff happening here ... really strange. Still haven't figured out how exactly they do refcounting. (It's ways more simple in C++!)\nMaybe I'm gonna try to introduce some of them as an ImageSharp internal as I did with BufferSpan<T>, but I'm not sure if their design fits our needs. Have to go deeper.. It's a bit more complicated because of the Span<byte> overloads (PackTo/PackFrom****Bytes), where Span<byte> could be both source and destination. Because of them, the simplest solution was to specify the pixel count explicitly everywhere.\nI think I can manage it without count, but need to have a deeper look at the call sites.. Alright, let's keep the current version for now, maybe someone will find a better option later as the code evolves.. Isn't it better to have a single samples project, with different code examples residing in different classes? (Launching them with some kind of sample switcher in Main())\nWe need many of them later. Having a separate project for each one - looks too heavyweight for me.. Would be much easier to refactor/optimize them!. Is this now a closed set of well known and commonly used pixel blenders that doesn't need to be extended?. should be ClearImageFormatDetectors(). The argument name should be refactored as well.. I have plans to fix stuff like this. The test image repository provider code should be shared between tests and benchmarks.. The inner part of the loop could be an instance method of Component.. It's really worth to introduce Block8x8Int and refactor this into Buffer<Block8x8Int>.\nA quick candidate implementation utilizing Fixed-size buffers and having an .AsSpan() method to help incremental refactoring:\n```C#\ninternal unsafe struct Block8x8Int\n{\n    private fixed short data[64];\npublic Span<short> AsSpan() => new Span<short>(this.data, 64);\n\npublic ref short this[int idx] => ref Unsafe.Add(ref Unsafe.As<Block8x8Int, short>(ref this), idx);\n\n}\n``\n. Or .. maybe it's better to allocate it as a private memberBuffer blockDatato beArrayPool-friendly, but we should expose it only through apublic Span BlockData { get; }property utilizingNonPortableCast`.. This method is not fast at all :(\n\nI'd rather separate the quantaziation logic from IDCT to make it modular and testable. See no real benefits from doing them in one step. We can optimize later.. Okkay, this one seems easy for me ... but I really don't want to code all the refactors and tests by my own. You have better knowledge on the new decoder code now.\nWe also got the integration testing task as a jpeg optimization prerequisite. I want to focus on that in the next 1-2 weeks.. We should be consistent:\n- Either by redesigning our whole API to be fully extension method focused, so not only Mutate(), but all the methods/properties producing derived results from a narrow core API, should be extension methods. So even image.Bounds would become an image.Bounds() extension method.\n- Or just turn both Mutate(operations) and Clone(operations) to instance methods as well. The naming seems inconsistent here.\nIt should be probably IImageOperationsFactory + CreateImageOperations(), or IImageOperationsProvider + GetImageOperations().\n. This method is unused.. For most processors we (eg. Resize()) we are allocating a new Width*Height image area twice!\n- First calling this copy constructor\n- Second time in the processor itself\nSo the issue Eric Mellino pointed out on gitter is still here, having two allocations is unnecessary. We should find a way to avoid this during this API validation process. I'm not saying that we should refactor everything now, but we need to make sure it is possible with the new API!. I'm not sure if it's possible without changing IImageProcessor<TPixel> design.\nThe processors doing allocation of a new image buffer should be able to take the source and destination image buffers from the outside instead. It would make SwapPixelBuffers() unnecessary:\nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/blob/master/src/ImageSharp/Processing/Processors/Transforms/ResizeProcessor.cs#L97\n@JimBobSquarePants thoughts?. I may play around with this, making a proposal in the weekend.. Shouldn't we find a less verbose name for this? How about IImageProcessingContext<TPixel>? //image.Mutate(ctx => ctx.Resize(..) ). Wasn't your intention to internalize this?. Typo: Cloneing...\nCan't we avoid code duplication by subclassing ImageProcessor<TPixel>?. I'm also really confused about the Run() / Apply() + DelegateProcessor<T> stuff. Is the purpose of this to allow users to access image data (sizes etc) in the processing lambda?\nI think we should find a way to enable ApplyRoundedCorners() to work on IImageProcessingContext<T>, it's just too much indirection now.. It still makes things more complicated which were simple before the Mutate/Clone API change. I had to debug through the code to understand it, and it also confused @JimBobSquarePants, so I think he is right, and we should find a simpler way to manage accessing the image inside the processing lambda.\nHow about IImageProcessingContext<T>.CurrentImage? . I think speeding up individual processors by eliminating per-pixel virtual calls everywhere + introducing #142 could bring much more at this point, than any chaining optimization.\nOptimizing processor chains sounds like a 2.0 feature for me. At this point having a straightforward API is more important IMO.\n. @JimBobSquarePants shouln't we try to make a decision on this before @tocsoft leaves on holidays?\nTo avoid conflicts in the Tests project, it would be wise to build my regression testing PR based on top of mutate-api. I need the test stuff to proceed with jpeg.. Yeah, but that means, we need something like IImageProcessingContext<T>.CurrentImage to extract \"intermediate\" image dimensions etc. for the next processing step.\nUnless someone finds a better solution, I'm totally fine with it.. @JimBobSquarePants If we just remove Apply() without an easy replacement, that means the user has to implement his own ImageProcessor-s just to enable very basic use cases.. Or we can probably just update this example, and suggest doing operations like this in two steps:\nC#\nimage.Mutate(ctx => ctx.Resize(....));\nimage.Mutate(ctx => DrawTheRoundedCorners(ctx, ....));\nSorry for thinking loudly and slowly across 3 comments :laughing:. @JimBobSquarePants @tocsoft my only concern: will this be clear for users? (We both needed time to understand it...)\nWouldn't it be better to split the steps in the example instead, as I suggested in my previous comment? Or to show multiple variants of ConvertToAvatar(): one operating in two steps, another one with Apply().\nAnd finally: Don't we need a more descriptive name for Apply()? Like ApplyDelegateProcessor() or RunDelegateProcessor() or RunInlineProcessor()?. @tocsoft are you sure internal is detected by xUnit?. Unix systems are case-sensitive, so you have to rename this to palette-8pp.png, to match the filename. There is a test failure on travis because of that.. duplicate package references!!! :skull_and_crossbones: . Wow, worked with this code a lot but haven't spotted this all the time! I think this is because these values were originally defined as Vector4.. Is it valid to have 0 frames? Shouldn't we throw in the constructor instead?. Is it really a good idea to expose a mutable List API on ImageFrameCollection? Feels like the API surface is to wide now.\nI'd rather keep it as an immuatble collection. If someone wants to implement a gif frame manipulator tool with ImageSharp (looks like a very uncommon use case), he should probably construct new image instances after calculating the frames.. Q1: Shouldn't we throw ObjectDisposedException instead of returning null then?\nQ2: Looks like it's possible to dispose an ImageFrameCollection without disposing the underlying image bringing Image<T> into an invalid state. Shouldn't we drop IDisposable from ImageFrameCollection<T> API and dispose frames directly from Image<T>.Dispose()?. It's probably matter of API taste, but I would utilize builder pattern instead, having some kind of ImageBuilder object to construct multi-frame images. This looks like a more convenient way to preserve valid object state. Constructing ImageFrame instances of a certain size, and verifying it against the image dimensions when calling ImageFrameCollection.Add() looks a bit clanky to me.\nBut looks like ImageSharp API follows mutable style on many other places (like ImageMetaData) so maybe it's easier to conform to this style everywhere for 1.0.\nHow about encapsulating the consistance rules into ImageFrameCollection by hiding ImageFrame<T> constructors and define methods on ImageFrameCollection<T>:\nC#\npublic ImageFrame<T> AppendNewFrame() { }\npublic ImageFrame<T> InsertNewFrame(int index) { }\n?\n@JimBobSquarePants thoughts?. We could probably expose a SavePixelData(byte[] buffer, int offset) and a SavePixelData(byte[] buffer) variant publicly.. Nice! It wasn't yet here when I was editing the document \ud83d\ude04. There are 2 solutions:\n1. a static method taking 3 tuples by ref.\n2. Defining a new struct for 3 tuples. \nNot sure if its worth to bother with this at the moment. . Agree, will do it. . +Yeah the jitter tends to eliminate dead code afaik. . @JimBobSquarePants I don't think there is a difference in this case.\nA non-static, non-virtual method acts like a static method taking this as the first argument. You should turn a method to static when you realize that you actually do not use this inside it. This is not the case here. (Or I'm just missing something?). I got it inlined into the methods above with ReSharper while trying to optimize stuff. Unfortunately it made only a very tiny difference. \nI want to leave it here for now for documentation purposes / future use.. The behaviour of JIT intrinsics is quite different to the behaviour we used to with normal data types / instructions.\n- new Vector<float>(128f) should translate into a single CPU instruction initializing an AVX register from a constant\n- new Vector4(128f) will do the same but with an SSE register AFAIK\nIf you make it static it will be ... well, actually what you gonna see depends on the quality of the JIT code generator. By my experience, for Vector4 it tends to generate optimized code, but I never trust what it's doing with Vector<T>.\nTL;DR: The simplest way to make sure that optimized code will be generated is to new it up, like I did \ud83d\ude04 . Do we still need these? Very few tests are using them, and those are not Jpeg related.. Just realized that we can simplifiy a lot on these comparisons using something like this:\n```C#\nstatic class ProfileIdentifiers\n{\n    public static readonly byte[] Icc = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(\"ICC_PROFILE\\0\");\n}\nstatic bool IsProfile(Span bytesToCheck, Span profileIdentifier)\n{\n    return bytesToCheck.Slice(0, profileIdentifier.Length).Equals(profileIdenfiier);\n}\n...\nif (IsProfile(profile, ProfileIdentifiers.Icc))\n{\n    // process the ICC profile\n}\n. Oops. Hope there is an easy to use helper somewhere around. AFAIK Span is being used to operate on string slices in Kestrel.. I always forget, everything is NuGet package now. It should be very simple to get the ASCII bytes for these characters though:C#\nstatic byte[] ToAsciiBytes(string str) => str.Select(c => (byte) c).ToArray();\n```\nI can add these changes this in the weekend.. @caetanator why have you removed this?\n(Unfortunately there are no vscode users in the ImageSharp core team, but some of our users find this very useful.). I think the reason might be similar to the .vscode/tasks.json removal.\n@caetanator can we ask you to undo all changes in this PR which are workarounds specific to your work environment?. @JimBobSquarePants @caetanator \nI think we should keep these structures as data transfer objects as similar to the standard as possible. I see no advantage from utilizing the ImageSharp colorspace stuff here.. @caetanator we have these unit tests to test the BMP decoder. We need to add all test images covering the new headers to our test image suite to tests/Images/Input/*.\nUnfortunately we need to make sure the images are not too big before pushing them. Can you share the links to your test images so I can have a look?. I wonder if we can reuse this.Temp  on these locations.. We should add a test case as well by extending theory data in PngDecoderTests! . @JimBobSquarePants good point! Don't you mean Buffer2D<byte> actually? I'm not familiar with the format, but line 258 suggests that values in data are indexing into the colors palette.\n@georgexcollins Buffer<T> and Buffer2D<T> is our centralized memory management helper to overcome GC limitations. Currently it abstracts away pooling, but it will be capable of more magic in the future, so it's important to use it everywhere for large buffers.. This has nothing to do with this PR, but I leave my notes here as a reminder:\nAdding an image to TestImages.Bmp.All adds a new test case to BmpTests (so \ud83d\udc4d for adding test coverage for your work @georgexcollins), but we should make TestImages.Bmp.All local to the BmpTests class, because the current situation is hard to follow.. Maybe not for this PR but ...\nthere are only 5 frames in this gif. By saving all of them as PNG we can introduce quite good regression testing for the gif decoder!. Cool to see more of these dropped!. Just one another perf trick: \nby using Buffer2D<byte> instead of Buffer<byte> you can easily avoid repeating the y * width multiplications for each pixel of a row: \n- Get a Span<byte> bufferRow = buffer.GetRowSpan(y) right before the inner loop\n- You can index the row Span inside the loop without multiplication: bufferRow[x]. @JimBobSquarePants I mean the code reading the uncompressed buffer after UncompressRle8,  inside the for loops. The inner loop is always using the y-th row of buffer -> it can read a row span instead.\nUncompressRle8 can process the data into buffer.Span as if it was an array.. I think it's possible to go without the Invert() method by managing newY as a loop variable, but the benefits are not significant ... just talking my idea.. We need a more consistent behavior if we want to expose this publicly. Currently it:\n- Throws in debug mode for an index being out of range (indicating an incorrect usage)\n- Silently, returns Alpha in release mode (this behavior is undocumented!). If we are fine with the current results, it would be wise, to push the results into the reference image repository, and add image.CompareToReferenceOutput(provider, ImageComparer.Tolerant()); here. At least for a few resamplers.. It's actually a SixLabors.Core issue, but I noticed that Point.Rotate() is the same as Point.Skew(), the code should be moved into a single Point.Transfrom() method IMO, and we should add new overloads, accepting matrix by ref to reduce the copy operations.\nI wonder if it's possible to do a better resampling strategy. Currently our weights window is centered at a rounded position. I should read more image processing literature.. Very strange logic through the inheritance hierarchy. Aren't we fine by always calculating ResizeRectangle from the affine matrix without specializations?. I think the we should not force having a know ResizeRectangle at constructor time. We should probably turn CreateNewCanvas() into a Rectangle CalculateDestRectangle(sourceRectangle) calling it, and setting ResizeRectangle inside the BeforeApply() step.\nResizeProcessor could return a static size, known at constructor time then.. Unfortunately, it doesn't help here. These method's are resolved dynamically through the interface, so they can not be inlined.. I think z should be something like angleDeg.\nx and y is not used at all! We should do translation and verify offsetting + cropping!\nWill do this.. We probably should keep these here, in the generic transform test class + drop them in RotateTest and SkewTest.. Now that we introduced TransformProcessor and TransformTests, I think RotateTests should focus mostly on corner cases it specializes. (See my comment on TransformTests). Let's do this with the test pattern instead! (-> smaller actual and reference outputs).\nI also suggest to have two [Theory]-s to cover this stuff:\n- One for going through all the ResamplerName-s using it as a theory parameter + fixing a single transform value\n- Another one to test different transform parameters with a single resampler.\nThis way we can cover everything without bloating the test-space.. I will do this very soon!. An API idea:\nMaybe we could provide a few shortcuts for common affine transforms:\n```C#\npublic enum TransformOrigin { Center, TopLeft }\npublic static IImageProcessingContext Transform(this IImageProcessingContext source, \n    float rotationAngle, \n    Vector2 scale, \n    Vector2 translation, \n    TransformOrigin origin = TransformOrigin.Center);\npublic static IImageProcessingContext Transform(this IImageProcessingContext source, \n    float rotationAngle = 0, \n    float uniformScale = 1, \n    float translationX = 0, float translationY = 0, \n    TransformOrigin origin = TransformOrigin.Center);\n// etc ...\n. Maybe we should allow users to define their own `targetRectangle`. Some of them might need deterministic output sizes instead of automatically fitting the transformed image. This would allow them to crop or extend the result image.. For Resize, default resampler is `KnownResamplers.Bicubic`. Shouldn't we be consistent here?. I think we should stop using `DefaultFiles` in new test cases & keep it for legacy tests only.\nFor filters, I suggest to test using `[WithTestPatternImages]` + probably `CalliphoraPartial.png` to have it tested against a realistic photo as well.. If the color filters are correct (which I assume is true), it's safe to add reference images + a `CompareToReferenceOutput()` call here.. Optimization opportunity (absolutely not urgent, we can postpone it to a follow-up PR):\nCreate a temporal `(endX-startX)` -sized `Buffer<Vector4>`, and use `PixelOperations` to pack+unpack.. `Parallel.For` ... I can't live ... with or without you .... Is this correct in cases like `maxXY.X < 0`? Isn't it better to have:C#\nvar extents = new Vector4(\n    MathF.Round(maxXY.X),\n    MathF.Round(maxXY.Y),\n    MathF.Round(minXY.X),\n    MathF.Round(minXY.Y));\n``\n?. Bulk packing/unpacking is much faster now forRgba32`.\nBuffer<T> uses a pooled array normally, so it shouldn't be an issue to construct some of them. However, we should not produce an instance for each row, and Parallel.For prevents us to new it up it in the outer scope. I have an idea to deal with all these Parallel.For-s, but this issue is at the very end of my queue now :(\n. This method needs a review + extensive unit testing including cases having a rectangle with a negative origo.\nI suggest to internalize it in this PR instead, so we can focus on the rest.. I wonder if we still need these subclasses?. @JimBobSquarePants this transform does not care with target image dimensions. An example:\nIf we have a 10x10 shape in the center of an 50x50 image and we want to scale it down by the factor of 0.5 keeping it in the center of the original 50x50 canvas, we move it to the origo ((-25,-25)), scale it, than move it back with a(+25,+25) vector.\nIn my tests the cropping is done manually by defining the new canvas \"after\" the transform.. The XY values of targetRectangle are actually never used! It could be a Size instead of Rectangle.. No worries, it's easy to tell them in a few images. Will do it in the next few days.\nThe implementation should be also easy, could be done within an hour.. @rytmis ArrayPool is actually really useful in small-mid dynamic array allocation use cases, because it reduces GC pressure + improves data locality!\nCheck out it's usages in aspnet mvc. \nAn example: it's providing ArrayPool<char> to Newtonsoft.Json through it's own IArrayPool<T> abstraction.. Not sure if we need minSizeBytes at all. The correct value should be found by benchmarking. I'd say it's an early optimization at this point, and would prefer to drop it for simplicity.\nAlso see my comment on Configuration.MemoryManager for an explanation about why is small-to-mid array pooling benefitical.. The maximum pool size should be configurable from the outside! (maximumPoolSizeInBytes)\nI pretty sure, that lowering the default maximum to more sane value alone would solve most of the Out Of Memory errors users have!. In our new design (backing everyting with byte[] arrays), this should be actually a constant and the default value for the  maximumPoolSizeInBytes parameter. (See my previous comment.). My biggest mistake was defining this value that high. It probably costs 100-s of \u20ac-s for Azure users :)\nI guess a value like 4096 * 4096 would do for now. Should be determined by proper load testing benchmarks later.. This is a typical case, where using ArrayPool is better than newing up an array! See my comment on Configuration.MemoryManager.. Now I see why does the \"backing everything with byte[]\" design work with streams:\nBecause Stream.Read() works with byte[] as well, so there is no type mismatch. Should we replace ArrayPool<byte> with ArrayPool<char>, I'm pretty sure the whole thing will fail.\nThe current way of exposing Buffer<T>.Array is extremely dangeorus. I will think about safer constructs.. I disagree. We should pass the MemoryManager from ImageFrameCollection<TPixel> to this method!\nThis is the MemoryManager responsible for the allocation of all the Image<T> pixel data!. Unfortunately we need to propagate that parameter here :( \nIt's possible to do this incrementally by defining a temporal construct with an optional memoryManager = null parameter and calling memoryManager ?? Configuration.Default.MemoryManager.Allocate2D<TPixel>(width, height, true).\nWe should get rid of PixelAccessor anyways, so leave it for now if you want. If you feel the chore work is just too much, leave it then :)\nWe should get rid of both PixelAccessor<T> and PixelArea<T> anyways. They are legacy constructs.. Yeah this is actully forcing us to make API design decisions. I think it should be a parameter of Blend(). @tocsoft thoughts?. GetMaxCode()  gonna pin/unpin this.MaxCodes several times inside a loop. We need to find a better way. Pinning outside the loop, or applying ref arithmetics with SRCS.Unsafe could do the job.\nDo you want me to deal with this?. I think we need to find a better name for this :) NullMemoryManager suggests me, that it's always returning null instead of a memory block with a valid memory address.\n@JimBobSquarePants @tocsoft suggestions?. I suppose this value holds the native pixel type in the stream, after Identify().\nWhat's the deal with Image.Load<TPixel>()? What if typeof(TPixel) \u2260 the native pixel type in the stream ?. However, if we rename it to something like OriginalPixelType, while keeping it in IImage means that we added another source stream specific, metadata-like property to the Image<T> class, which is mostly intended to represent raw image/pixel data.\nMy suggestion:\nLet's name it OriginalPixelType and move it into the ImageMetaData class.. @JimBobSquarePants I proposed this class and naming in order to make it extendable in a way like this:\n```C#\npublic class PixelTypeInfo\n{\n    public System.Type PixelType { get; }\n    public int BitsPerPixel { get; }\ninternal PixelTypeInfo(int bitsPerPixel, System.Type pixelType = null)\n{\n    this.BitsPerPixel = bitsPerPixel;\n}\n\npublic static PixelTypeInfo Create<TPixel>() where TPixel \n    :  IPixel<TPixel> => \n    new PixelTypeInfo(Unsafe.SizeOf<TPixel>(), typeof(TPixel));\n\n}\n```\nThis will enable integrating it deeper with our pixel type infrastructure, and provide non-generic pixel-type related API-s. As a bridge between native (image format/stream bound) pixel type data and our internal pixel types, this class will not necessarily represent \"raw\"/native pixel type information only.. Okkay, let's sum up the situation, so we can figure it out:\n- @tocsoft Not sure if I'm comfortable with this fact, but we already have MetaData exposed on Image<TPixel>.\n- We need to include Width+Height (or maybe SixLabors.Size?) into the metadata-only result. Currently it's not exposed on ImageMetadata.\n  - @denisivan0v solved this by defining ImageInfo : IImage as the metadata-only result\n  - But maybe these are just different things, and sharing a common interface is an LSP violation.\n@denisivan0v @xakep139 do you actually need the ImageInfo/Image<T> polymorphism? Eg: do you want to mix them in heterogenous containers? For me it feels like an unrealistic scenario.. @JimBobSquarePants I'm not sure if I'm following you correctly. \nDo you suggest to keep the PixelType property on the IImage interface + keep it in sync with TPixel in case of Image<TPixel>? Or the opposite: always exposing the raw type after Image.Load<TPixel>() regardless of TPixel?. Makes sense, and looks like being in sync with my vision about the role of PixelTypeInfo as a bridge between TPixel and raw formats, and future pixel-type agnostic Image API-s. (System.Drawing is decoding images into their native formats, we might implement this feature with IImage.)\nHowever I'm still unsure if the result of Identify() is actually an image. Maybe we should rename to IImageInfo, and reserve IImage for future use cases: \nIImage should represent an image that actually has pixels, so it could be used with processors, .Mutate(), .Clone() etc.\nI think we should implement the following hierarchy in long term:\n```C#\n// Has Dimensions + PixelTypeInfo + Metadata\npublic interface IImageInfo { ... }\n// Also has pixels, could be used with ImageProcessor-s.\npublic interface IImage : IImageInfo { ... }\ninternal class ImageInfo : IImageInfo { ... }\npublic class Image : IImage { ... }\n. I'd rather call this `ProjectiveTransformProcessor` or `HomographyTransformProcessor`. Good that it's internal for now. How about finishing projective transforms in a follow-up PR? I'd rather have this merged first, it's already *The PR That Has Been Under Review For The Longest Time In History* :). @JimBobSquarePants I probably changed the semantics you originally intended for the `Rectangle` parameter. Check out the tests and my illustration in [this comment](https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/pull/386#issuecomment-357104963).\nIf everyone's happy with it, we can merge the PR.. @JimBobSquarePants I renamed it back to `rectangle`, I hope my comments explain it better now. If still unsatisfied & there is no better idea, we can internalize this overload for now. \nThe one with the `destinationSize` parameter is that really matters.. We can drop an unnecessary constructor invocation for perf here:C#\npremultiplied.W = w;\nreturn premultiplied;\n``. \ud83d\udc4d for being Kaboom-proof!. Depends on whatif (((i >> j) & 1) == 1)does. We need to eliminate branches inside loops for vectorization..IsDisposedis the usual convention in .NET. If you are looking for a minimum (and not actually a distance value), it's enough to callVector4.DistanceSquared()to spare several expensive and unnecessary square root calculations.. Yeah that ranging stuff is quite complicated, I still can't follow it. Maybe we can haveToVector4andToScaledVector4side by side, letting the ImageProcessor to pick one of them. The refactor path could be also easier.\nNeverheless this is just a basic implementation for testing purposes used by***IsNotBoundToSinglePixelType` theories, and we are testing just a few pixel types in those.. Its not a proper correctness testing for now, I'm comparing the orinal image against the one that's saved by our encoder then decoded by S.D. The goal was to cath regressions.\nHowever  there are a few results with 444+Q=100 encoding which should be better IMO. Libjpeg can is able to choose from several code paths AFAIK depending on configuration + architecture, LUT is just one of them and SIMD is preferred whenever available. (At least the decoder works this way.). Let's go for it then! \n(Post 1.0 I guess). As far as I understand, this is always the boundary of the initial image.\nWhat happens if someone applies multiple operations, with the sizes sizeA > sizeB > sizeC ?\nC#\nimage.Mutate(c => c.Resize(sizeA).Resize(sizeB).Resize(sizeC) );. \ud83d\udc4d . I'm still a bit worried if this method is good for us:\nWe have added a visible state to an object that looked kinda stateless towards it's consumers. I remember we did not want to expose source/destination images on the interface for some reason, but actually, if we are exposing Bounds, it's almost the same. \nI understand the reason however, that you need this because the initialization logic lives now mostly inside the processor constructors, but maybe there are other solutions to achieve the same goals.\n@tocsoft your thoughts?\nIf we are unsure, how about hiding this behind IInternalImageProcessingContext<T> to avoid exposing it to users? (While not being blocked by thinking too much on this stuff.). Yeah, that would allow us to get rid of the AllocateFake<T> workaround entirely.. We need Memory<T> for the memory interop stuff, for the rest we need a proper API review. Not sure if stuff like .GetMemoryManager() should be public.. It's just my Hunglish :D. Should we do it now, or in a follow up PR pair?. Thanks for fixing it!. Actually defaulting to this logic would be the best, but I felt it's more safe to continuously refactor stuff towards it, also keeping the exception throwing where we haven't yet implemented the \"smart\" error management.. I'm not convinced at all that we need to do this, specially not by default!\nSee my comment on #477.\nOr am I missing something? \ud83d\ude15 . We also need to apply these changes to the .tt files. This code is auto-generated.. @iamcarbon you don't need that! T4 is just a dumb tool for generating the code, it doesn't need to know what the generated code does or references. Actually you can generate any text with it. The syntax is almost the same as classic ASP.\nJust replace the text where you see .DangerousGetPinnableReference() ! :). @tocsoft @JimBobSquarePants wouldn't it be cleaner to have our API without these shortcuts, exposing AddImageFormat(), SetEncoder() etc. only on ImageFormatManager and not on Configuration?\nOr should we keep them for compatibility?. Normally I would expect this kind of constructor to do a deep copy. Wouldn't it be better to have a Configuration.ShallowCopy() method instead to be more explicit?. @vpenades I suggested a separate ShallowCopy() method instead of this constructor, because I don't like a constructor doing a shallow copy implicitly. Being more verbose here is better IMO:\nC#\nConfiguration myConfig = Configuration.Default.ShallowCopy();\nmyConfig.MemoryManager = ...;. We can push this up to IImageInfo.\nActually there are Width + Height properties here, so maybe it should be an extension method.. Bounds()  could be an extension method on IImageInfo.. :+1: for dropping the enum! I think we should also change the name to KnownQuantizers to match our typical convention.. I see. I guess  we do not use simple plural for these classes to avoid collision with namespaces?\nXXXMode intuitively suggests a closed API to me. Is this the standard MS convention now?. To me it looks like the Known prefix is the least worst of all those options. Any recommendation from MS?. Shouldn the docs mention that dithering is enabled with this ctr? (I'm following the twitter conversaton :) ). How about naming this KnownDitherers to match KnowDiffusers?. Isn't KnownFilterMatrices a better naming for this?. Not sure if it's worth to turn this into a struct. The instances are not frequents, so there are no performance benefits, however it makes it easier to users to make mistakes:\nDefault-constructed instances are invalid (BitsPerPixel == 0) + it introduces the cognitive load of struct/value semantics. (Note: we plan to add more fields like a reference to the pixel type etc.)\nThoughts?. The only change I strongly suggest is to introduce new batch primitives for PackFromScaledVector4() and ToScaledVector4() in PixelOperations<T> .\nWe could drop the for loop then, and push the data through a temporary Vector4 buffer.. ParallelFor.WithTemporaryBuffer could help providing the buffer efficiently.. We need to pin this! (fixed (...) { ... }). @dlemstra are you happy with IReadOnlyList? It seems fine to me, because it lets indexing the collection while keeping it immutable.. Is this list intended to be mutable from the outside?. We need to solve this then, but it could be done in a  separate PR then to minimalize the current changeset.. I'll leave a few comments to clarify my point though:\n\nWe're over-complicating a very simple operation. We're looping in PixelOperations!\n\nThe point of PixelOperations<T> is to allow SIMD optimized path for specific operations. The optimized path for unscaled Rgba <-> Vector4 packing is about 2x faster than the standard. It could be actually reused in the scaled Rgba32 case!\n\nin this instance I do not feel that we warrant that allocation at all\n\nParallelFor.WithTemporaryBuffer allows us to solve the above point from only ParallelOptions.MaxDegreeOfParallelism number of buffer \"allocations\" (which are actually pooled array usages!).. I know, I also did it several times, but it's most likely not worth to inline methods with complex loops inside them.. By casting the byte reference to Rgb24 reference, it's possible to have just one Unsafe.Add() inside the loop, also eliminating i * 3.. You forgot to assign to assign the reference to a value.\nDoesn't this break any tests ??? :fearful:\nIf not, I think we should add them ASAP. Unsafe optimizations could not be carried out safely without proper coverage.. This line does not do anything, but adds i to a reference, and drops the return value:\nC#\nUnsafe.Add(ref rgb24Ref, i);\nWe need this:\nC#\nUnsafe.Add(ref rgb24Ref, i) = rgb;\nStrange it doesn't break anything. Is this path actually executed?. Does this fail if you reintroduce the mistake in WriteApplicationExtension()?\nIf yes, I'm happy to merge this!. I suggest to remove AggressiveInlining here, might help producing cleaner profiler results.. It might be better to consume a Span<short> on method surface, unless it's really worth to micro-optimize by taking a reference.\nStoring the block data as a Span<short> member of PdfJsScanDecoder is even better. It's a stack-only struct!. We need tests for pdfjs Identify(). (The test case is called JpegDecoderTests.DetectPixelSize() for the standard path now.). I can see that there are significant changes coming with your next commits (Block8x8 migration), so nevermind this for now.. I suggest to to store the \"reference\" to the current block memory area as a Span<short> member right into the PdfJsScanDecoder struct. It would eliminate some of the repetitive code. We can extract the reference in methods like DecodeACFirst. I don't expect noticable performance regression from this change, but the code will be cleaner:\n- No need to pass blockDataRef as method argument\n- No need to pass offset. I fail to follow why did you named this \"false positive\".. Not all of the images labeled as \"issues\" are actually invalid. I meant this to indicate a regression test based on an GH issue. We may need to find a better naming for the whole thing.. You can bring this to the stack, by usiing my ZigZag structure + extending it with the Unsafe.Add() indexer trick.. Good question if it's worth to use byte buffer here.\nDoesn't worth to bother much with it now, but a few notes for future ourselves:\n- Indexing byte[] is most likely slower, but the buffer itself is smaller, increasing the chance to fit the CPU cachelines.\n- Would be nice to benchmark the micro-scenario\n. How about this without pinning? \nC#\nref BmpFileHeader dest = ref Unsafe.As<byte, BmpFileHeader>(ref MemoryMarshal.GetReference(buffer));\ndest = this;\nDoesn't really matter here, but it's most likely faster :). Just wondering why don't you do the casting trick here?. See my comment on BmpFileHeader.WriteTo(). @JimBobSquarePants Why do we store Int64 here? Values are copared against a short inside DecodeHuffman().. I suggest to define a small private struct instead of Tuple<float, TPixel>. It provides:\n- Better readability\n- Better memory locality (Tuple<>-s are classes on the heap). @JimBobSquarePants added some tests to cover CreateTaperMatrix() parameters. I may get it wrong but the XxxOrYyy stuff might be the inverse of the intended. Can you check the output?. Cool suff! Covers basic cases & good for testing without getting outside the scope of the library.. We can simply drop those assertions IMO.. while(x < bytesPerPixel) ?. Wonder why do we need to seek the stream on every read?. Not sure if I like this.\nDoes it worth to pollute our object model in this manner just to make it easier to add frames of a \"default\" color when producing gif-s manually? (0.01% of ImageSharp use-cases I guess).\n@JimBobSquarePants @tocsoft thoughts?. I refactor this logic into an IsSolidBrushWithoutBlending property or similar for better readability.. @JimBobSquarepants I remember having a conversation about optional arguments, with the conclusion that we should prefer overloads instead because of better binary compatibility.\nIs this still a thing we should follow?. After \"ignoring\" SOS, the decoder will start scanning through the contents of the SOS block using tens (hundreds? thousands?) of FindNextFileMarker() calls returning invalid \"file markers\". I don't think this is the expected behavior.\nCan't this behavior push the decoder into a faulted state leading to ignore some further actual file markers it shouldn't ignore, even in metadata-only state?. Accidentally commented this on OrigJpegDecoderCore instead of PdfJsDecoderCore. \nActually I only investigetad the latter, and the issue is present here! Haven't checked OrigJpegDecoderCore.. .. so the issue happens here actually.. I guess it should.\nHowever, ProcessSOS does not depend on it as far as I understand.. Please use spaces for indentation instead of tabs! (Like the rest of the file.). Why this change?\nExchanging an int + a bool through the stack is slower than doing the same using only an int, and we are on a hot path here AFAIK.. Considering we have comparison against reference images now, do these assertions still add value to the tests?. No need to inherit FileTestBase.. This addition is accidental I guess.. We should consume ReadOnlySpan in all overloads.. My mistake that I also forgot about this in #565 :). Ok, one naming question mostly to @JimBobSquarePants :\nShouldn't we name this GradientBrushBase or simply GradientBrush to match our current naming patterns?. VerifySpectralCorrectness_PdfJs/Golang should test the first step, here we only need to test JpegImagePostProcessor, so parsing input with both decoders doesn't add value here. \nIt's totally fine to run JpegImagePostProcessorTests with the default jpeg decoder only, which is PdfJsDecoderCore now.\n. I'm getting \"Qualifier is redundant\" tips everywhere.\nI wonder which analyzer added the namespace qualifiers?. Can't we keep caching smaller images on 32bit?\n(By providing an upper megapixel limit.). Here it is I think!\nYou need to always clear the buffer.. @tocsoft the same could be true for Span<T>:\n```C#\nSpan testSpan = default;\nusing (IBuffer buffer = allocator.Allocate(10))\n{\n    // span is assigned, we are on the same method stack in the using block:\n    testSpan = buffer.GetSpan(); \n}\nusing (IBuffer somethingElse= allocator.Allocate(10))\n{\n     somethingElse.GetSpan()[5] = 666;\n}\n// we are out of the intended scope here:\nint naiveUsersValue = testSpan[5];\n```\nDespite the dangers I think both image.GetPixelMemory() and image.GetPixelRowMemory(y) are useful methods for advanced users, because they allow heaping pixel rows, so users can use them in async API-s etc.\nWhat we can do is:\n1. Document these pitfals\n2. Introduce a new level of indirection: Decouple IBuffer<T> from MemoryManager<T>, so we can transparently swap the buffer behind the Memory<T> instance.\nImplementing point 2. would take many hours, delaying the open-up of memory API-s further. We can actually do it later, as an additional increment.. @tocsoft you can't do the following with span:\nC#\nasync Task DoOperationOnPixelsAsync(Span<Rgba32> pixels)\n{\n    await .....;\n    await ........;\n}\nOne of our users (on gitter) walked into this pitfall resulting in a runtime failure, and he blamed ImageSharp for it. (This is fine, we can't expect everyone to understand stack-only types.) We decided to hide the Span<T> API-s because of this story. There was a quite valid reasoning, that we should expose only the Memory<T> variant.\nI say we should expose either both the Span and the Memory API-s or neither of them. If we can't agree, I say let's internalize everything for now, turning this PR into a refactor one.\n@JimBobSquarePants your thoughts?. Actually ... you don't even need to have a goal of implementing something in a separate async operation for let's say perf. If you are implementing an ASP.NET controller, being in an async context most of the time, it's very easy to walk into a pitfall of this kind.. @mellinoe sorry for pulling you in, but I think your opinion might be very useful here!\n@iamcarbon - same for you :)\nTLDR:\n- Exposing only Span<TPixel> API-s is dangerous, because it may lead to heap captures for users who don't follow (or don't know about) coding patterns we suggest.\n- Exposing Memory<TPixel> API-s is dangerous, because the memory may point to an \"outdated\" location after certain processors being executed. (Unless we spend many extra hours of coding.). @tocsoft if no one disagrees, I'm being tempted to accept your reasoning.\nExposing Memory<T> could be an incremental addition later.. Forgot to remove this, good catch!. Always false of course :)\n65535 * 65535 = 4 294 836 225 and int.MaxValue = 2 147 483 647 so Width and Height can't exceed those values in any case.\nWidth and Height should be defined as long if we want to allow those sizes. (But I think we don't.). Omg true that, I should not make statements before lunch!\nMaybe we should define something like an Image.MaximumDimension constant.. I think it already happened a few times! \ud83d\ude04\nFixed this stuff in my newest commit.. As far as I understand, in most cases image processor properties are readonly and initialized from the constructors. Why are there exceptions, and are we sure we need them?\nI think we need a guideline for this.\nHint:\nReadonly properties will allow input check at constructor time + readonly logic is more in sync with the \"one-shot\" nature of our processors.. This is the expected output right?\n\nDon't we need another test? More complex path (eg. circle) but simpler brush/pen. I'm happy to add it.. What if Brush and Pen are both null? Shouldn't we throw?\n(Same for all text processors.). Don't we need a dedicated GlyphParameters struct/class with proper equals + gethashcode implementations  instead of an integer key here? Collisions may lead to bugs!. I think this threshold is too high now, will do some experiments lowering it.. @tocsoft can you confirm, if the output is correct?\n\nThe first point in path is X=120, Y=300, but the text starts on the top, so I'm a bit confused. Is it center aligned?. Most of the processors were not designed to be reusable, they cache stuff of their current execution. Making them reusable would mean that we need to implement and unit test proper reset logic for them, which is a statefulness hell IMO.. You mean the .DrawText() overloads taking IPath? That might be fine, it's an advanced scenario.\nHaving these image-based tests for TextBuilder.GenerateGlyphs(text, path, style) here might be still useful!. We should probably consider generating these default implementations later.. Hope we can do this later more efficiently without float-packing.\nI guess doing just dest.R = (byte)(this.R / 255) will lead to rounding errors.. Is it travis? Can't we make it environment specific?. We should find a different testing method for those bit depths then, otherwise we are testing PngDecoder against itself in all our test cases, loosing the point of the regression testing.. For me it looks like you are testing the decoders result against itself, running it one another time inside VerifyEncoder(). Or am I missing something?. \ud83d\udc4d seems good, but it might be worth to have another look tomorrow. All our tests depend on this stuff \ud83d\ude04. \"({R},{G},{B})\" is much better for debugging.. Two calls to DebugSave() and CompareToOriginal() would more straightforward and readable in a decoder test. ( (VerifyEncoder() does the same though.). Even if S.D decoder is inaccurate, and the output seems visually perfect, this high level of tolerance seems worrying for me. It might be a sign that something is wrong somewhere (maybe the comparison logic). What is the percentage difference if you lower the threshold?. Why do we need this dramatic (~10x) increase in tolerance?. Super-strange. I hope it's not my algorithm that sucks.\nMaybe we could print the \"last modified\" timestamp of submodule files, or something like that.. @JimBobSquarePants I think I figured it out! \nActually, it fails for me locally when I change the tolerance back to the original value. This is my actual output image for palette size 80:\n\nIt differs from both the current and the past version of the same image in the ReferenceOutput repository. Can you confirm that it means that the actual output of the execution on my PC differs from yours? This could be only explained by hardware (CPU) differences. I suspect a method like WuFrameQuantizer<T>.Volume() as the source.\nIf that is the case, this is exactly the reason why we have a tolerance in our comparer :) I think you have overshoot the tolerance however, based on my local tests 1.5F/100 should be good enough. It's not a percentage value in this class, you defined 22.73% actually! (I usually postfix my stuff with ***Percent when I mean percentage.). We should probably allow the user to select the baseline frame.. Do you swear you never coded in Java? \ud83d\ude04 . There are still many optimization opportunities left here, but we need to change (extend?) the IErrorDiffuser API for that.\nNot related to this PR but [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)] is unnecessary on Dither<TPixel>(). The compiler won't be able to inline it.. @JimBobSquarePants tolerance == 0.01 means 1%, which can be interpreted as the following:\n- Either: An RGB image should be white, but 1% of white pixels are black (the rest is white)\n- Or: all the pixels in the image have a 1% difference compared to the expected values\nI tried to explain this here but I think I wasn't clear enough.\nImageComparer.TolerantPercentage() is a helper that expects tolerance value scaled to 0-100. The value will be scaled back to the 0-1.0 interval internally. It's useful because tolerance values are typically very small.. If you invoke a method through interface or virtual call on a base class, it can't be inlined, because the code is not known at JIT time. (The virtual invocation is responsible to dispatch the method at runtime.). The type name should be renamed accordingly.. I wonder if we really need this class in it's current form. Either we should hide the Table property and encapsulate actual logic (initialization, retrieval of rows) inside the class, or we should drop it and define a helper method that creates  Buffer2d<short>.. Would be nice to have better names or some comments about the semantics of less trivial variables.. acHuffmanTable and fastAC  are unused. The method is quite long, might be worth to refactor internal branches into separate methods.. The method can be static. This should be probably a member of the FastACTables class.. I suppose autoproperty code is always inlined by the JIT, no need for explicit requests.. Methods with IL code shorter than 32 bytes are usually inlined even in old .NET frameworks. Heuristics got more sophisticated since then.. I know there were arguments against using parameter defaults, but on places like this it feels cleaner to me. ArrayPool.Return looks basically the same.\n@JimBobSquarePants thoughts?. The docs of HorizontalResolution and VerticalResolution stills state \"[..] It is defined as the number of dots per inch [...]. We should change this.. So we are actually following binary compatibility with the JFIF standard? Shouldn't we state it in the docs of PixelResolutionUnit?. I wonder how will AppVeyor react if we undo this. This is the only change that has something to do with the build.. \ud83d\udc4d nice job!. We need an Image.WrapMemory<T>(IMemoryOwner<T> memoryOwner) overload then. The guideline tells that the memory ownership will be transferred to Image<T> in that case, so it will be responsible for disposing the image.\nNeed to rethink the logic inside BufferManager<T> to correctly support this case in SwapOrCopyContent.. Good catch! Having common internals is just too dangerous, we should probably drop [InternalsVisibleTo(...)] in SL.Core to avoid these issues.. One can accidentally include and use such internals with R# (been there). I would rather share them through submodules in the future. For now it's just safer to hide them IMO.. Zero is an exclusive minimum here, if (value <= 1) would mean that we throw for MaxDegreeOfParallelism = 1 which is allowed!. Makes sense in the DetectFormat() use case, thanks!\nWhen doing a full image decoding (Image.Load(...)), that allocation is a drop in the bucket however. Using UnmanagedMemoryStream seemed to be the best way for \"converting\" a span into a Stream.. You should use the method's configuration argument instead.. @JimBobSquarePants not sure if this was @dlemstra 's original idea. This way we can not share common properties between different formats.\n@dlemstra isn't what you meant actually to have entries for individual properties? Eg. image.MetaData.GetGifColorTableMode(), image.Metadata.GlobalColorTableLength ?\nI'm not saying this is the ideal way to go but we should consider pros/contras.. Can't we find a more type-safe key than string?\nIf decide to stick with the one entry/format solution then I would suggest to use IImageFormat as a key (after making all formats singletons with hidden constructors).. This is a breaking API change. If we plan to introduce the same logic for all formats, we should introduce this pattern in all encoders now, even if the implementation is not yet here!. We should consider returning new GifMetaData(), when there is no value present for the key. This would simplify the call site a lot.. We can make all formats singletons making their constructors private. This way GifFormat.Instance will be the only global instance of GifFormat. This would also make dictionary operations in ImageFormatManager safer!\nNote:\nFormats are stateless objects so the drawbacks of singletons are not present.. The drawback of this class is that it pollutes the public API by complicating the class hierarchy with implementation details, bringing no benefits IMO. The reason is that there is no need for lazy instance creation, because the constructor is trivial and brings no thread safety issues.\nDefining a format without it is actually simpler:\n```C#\n    public sealed class GifFormat : IImageFormat\n    {\n        private GifFormat() { }\n    public string Name => \"GIF\";\n\n    public string DefaultMimeType => \"image/gif\";\n\n    public IEnumerable<string> MimeTypes => GifConstants.MimeTypes;\n\n    public IEnumerable<string> FileExtensions => GifConstants.FileExtensions;\n\n    // The only extra line:\n    public static GifFormat Instance { get; } = new GifFormat();\n}\n\n```. How about this pattern?\nhttps://gist.github.com/antonfirsov/0eaf6ac9438655ea3affbf3212b33cc0\n(Also posted on twitter)\n. Can't decide whether I like the new() constraint or not. Seems reasonable here, but I've read pretty bad things about it:\nhttps://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/seteplia/2017/02/01/dissecting-the-new-constraint-in-c-a-perfect-example-of-a-leaky-abstraction/\n(The performance concern is not critical here, because it's a cold path.). Actually, the constraint can be removed, if we follow the proposal in my gist!\nWe just need a factory method in IImageFormat<TFormatMetaData>:\nC#\npublic interface IImageFormat<TFormatMetaData> : IImageFormat\n{\n    TFormatMetaData CreateDefaultFormatMetaData();\n}. you can write it as: 1 << bitDepth (much faster). I wonder if we should name this simply GetFormatMetaData? Thanks to the lazy initialization, we are always free to query any metadata, so we can view it as if all metadata was always there.\nThe problem is that encoders are invoking this method, and the name GetOrAddFormatMetaData suggests that we are modifying the image, which is a code smell (CQRS violation), because the encoding process is basically a query operation.. I wonder if we actually need this method? We can just query the metadata in decoders modifying the result object.. \ud83d\ude2e this is real magick!. I think this is misleading now. IDeepCloneable.Clone() does a deep copy + we also need to make Configuration deep clonable.. I think more a verbose name is better in this specific case. What if an object is both deep an shallow cloneable? (Like Configuration). No theory just intutively feel this should be a relatively high value (probably even higher than the current one). It's not that important to find the best value TBH and it's opreation specific. Needs lots of benchmarking.. Header is missing.. This brace style against our style guide rules.. To reduce GC pressure, please use Buffer2D<uint> provided by configuration.MemoryAllocator:\nC#\nusing (Buffer2D<ulong> intImage = configuration.MemoryAllocator.Allocate2D(...))\n{\n    // ...\n    Span<ulong> intImageRow = intImage.GetPixelRowSpan(i);\n}. All white point members could be readonly!. I added LCM, because originally I wanted to optimize KernelMap-s buffer size + calculation time further, but all the other issues seemed more critical, so that optimization is postponed for now.. We have the same code in Vector4Extensions. Might make sense to have a unified & expressive common API.. I wonder why do we have interfaces which are not used through the abstraction. I think they shouldn't be there, and the methods should be moved to static utilities. If they were being actually used, it would be very expensive to do non-inlinable virtual interface calls to convert only one float value.. I think there is an extra copy with the property assignment:\n1. Create temp = new Vector4(v.W)\n2. Assign temp.W=1\n3. Assign the whole stuff to s: s = temp\nBoth the C# compiler and JIT fails to optimize this to my orginal code:\n1. s = new Vector4(v.W)\n2. s.W = 1. Same here. I assume that applying bulk premultiplication outside the convolution might be better, because simpler bulk methods are usually faster. (And it's definitely a better separation of concerns!). \nIf any concerns, we should benchmark this!. Why don't you take the pixel span (or the reference to the first row item) outside the loop instead?. These if-s are perf killers, because they mess up CPU branch prediction. Can't we iterate using the y < Math.Min(matrixYHeight, matrixXHeight) condition instead?. Slow indexer again!. Same as for the other condition.. Again, I suppose it's better to do the premultiplication/unpremultiplication outside the convolution method.. \ud83d\udc4d . I see. Then it would be better to introduce a .GetReferenceToFirstItem() or something, and do everything with Unsafe arithmetics than bothering with spans!. Actually forgot that it's all about tiny matrices. They really should be value types (#142), and other optimization attempts are maybe unworthy at this point.. Indexing a 2D struct contains a multiplication which is unnecessary within the inner loop if we have a pointer to the first item of the row.\nA note on benchmarking:\nIn this case, a proper benchmark is a one that iterates through all elements. Using constant index values could be misleading.\nBut nevermind the whole thing, this is of low importance at this point. I'd rather review the design, than make small improvements on the implementation.. But it has the unnecessary count * i multiplication within the inner loop! \nAlso: Going with Unsafe and remove the array indexers would strip the benchmarks from the array bounds checking, which is probably the most expensive stuff here, making the results very similar.. This is introducing a significant performance regression for most pixel types.\nJust realized that I haven't benchmarked ToVector4() / ToScaledVector4(), which is a big mistake. If it's slower, we should also change it to the ref output style.. This is again a significant performance regression. Many pixel formats had efficient implementations for the conversion of basic formats like Rgba32 <-> Bgra32 <-> Argb32 <-> Rgb24 etc, implemented with byte-shuffling.\nWe should not replace those with expensive Vector4-based conversions!. The good thing is that this method is rarely used. We can probably address this later together with the review on ToVector4() / ToScaledVector4().. Depends on the use case.\nThe case in the benchmark is basically the Span<TPixel> -> Span<Rgba32> conversion. Writing right into a reference pointing to an item in the destination buffer removes one extra copy, compared to the case when you are assigning the destiniation buffer item through a return value.\nI suspect, there are probably some other unnecessary operations JIT fails to optimize.\nWe should also benchmark an other case:\nWhen the result of ToRgba() is being copied into a temporary variable for a small modification before writing it to the destination buffer. This is what we do in the PNG codec.\nWe should implement these benchmarks for ToVector4() as well. Gonna work on these points tonight!. Good point, will do compare!. These methods are all unit tested separately (so coverage is independent from current HW configuration), so we need them as internal. \nI can improve the input checking a bit however.. I'm planning to do this in a separate PR, or open an up-for-grabs issue. @iamcarbon is the champion of this stuff! \ud83d\ude04 . Definitely a better place!. Good catch! Result of undoing a refactor with R#. Will fix it.. The one in ComparableExtensions is faster, I'm removing this!. It was an optimization for small buffers, but the new logic made it obsolete.. The benchmark code serves as an information, but the execution is unnecessary, unless someone wants to evaluate that specific method in future investigations.\nI wish there was some better way to Skip benchmarks without completely dropping their code.\n. Shouldn't we use our new Gray8 type here for consistency, using  Gray8... in the property name as well?. Same here. We have a brand new Gray16 pixel type!. I think we should not use abbrevations in public API-s. TransparentRgb24? @JimBobSquarePants any better idea?. thanks! will fix.. Everywhere, where we can make sure that the operation is about to fill the whole image.\nSo all decoders. Copying processors: not sure, they are a bit more complicated because of the swapping logic.. My thought is that S.D is slow for progressive images for some reason.\nFor progressive images with many scans (like Jpg/issues/Issue518-Bad-RST-Progressive.jpg) huffman decoding is definitely a bottleneck:\n\nFor 420 baseline images (like pg/issues/issue750-exif-tranform.jpg) it's about 1:1 now:\n\n. The exception message should be more specific here, informing the user about his mistake. (Eg. using an incompatible quantizer on an encoder object.). Unused local variable.. We should not go without unit test coverage for public types. \nIn this case this is not a blocker because other quantizers also lack comprehensive coverage, nevertheless, we should deal with this eventually.. Why not storing only Point location here? The dimensions of the rectangle are unused (instead, represented by Size as far as I understand).. I would rather drop the condition check, it looks like an unnecessary micro-optimization. The this.rectangle.Location == (0,0) case is not special, it will result in Matrix3x2.Identity as \"translation\".\nWe can actually start by Matrix3x2 matrix = Matrix3x2.CreateTranslation(-this.rectangle.Location).. I would rather go without Clear(), but it's matter of API taste. (Using it would seem like a code smell on consumer side to me.). All my review comments for AffineTransfrormBuilder are also valid for ProjectiveTransformBuilder.. Would be nice to also add the Rotate/Scale/Translate/Skew methods already present in AffineTransformBuilder.. unused. TODO note for future optimization:\nWe should investigate which calculations could be done outside Convolve (-> enabling bulk operations, removing condition-checks).. I think we need to find a way to also expose pure Matrix** overloads. . I would rather add tests all 3 overloads. (They can even do different things.). Not sure whether it's related to the changes of the PR, but on my PC tests are failing for non-core2.1 targets. Something is wrong with the alpha blending:\n\n. We need better coverage for both AffineTransformBuilder and ProjectiveTransformBuilder! Common features could be tested with the same test code. I'll see whether I can help here.. Having the word Matrix in the name of these methods seems unnecessarily verbose to me.\nIt could be PrependRotationDegrees(...)\nWe also need a Prepend/AppendRotationRadians(...).\n. PrependScale(...)? etc ..... Not sure whether the logic implemented in GetTransformedSize(...) fits the needs of all users. Maybe we should expose a AffineTransformProcessor(matrix, sampler, targetSize) constructor instead, and deal with the rest in the extension methods.. The specific creation methods (rotate etc.) seem uncovered for me + we can have a bit more semantical testing.\nAn idea that's easy to implement: a point transformed by a matrix created with the builder using a series of basic transforms should get to the expected position.. Yes, Affine is a subset of Projective. Not sure about the details with the Matrix4x4 class, but I guess you need to use the 3D API-s with Z=0 for translation and Z=1 for scale-like stuff.. Sorry, the variable. (At least according to R# suggetion). You can take the output canvas size from the outside. See my last comment.. Also related to this.. Woops I missed this one.\nHaven't noticed that we always rotate around the (original) center. I think we need better naming and xmldoc to make it clear (something like AppendCenteredRotation(...)?).\nImplementing my idea is still possilbe though, eg. with the following changes on the builders:\n```C#\nprivate List> matrixFactories;\npublic Matrix3x2 BuildMatrix(Size size)\n{\n   // ....\n}\n``. Yeah it also went crazy for me with the latest updates. My feeling is that something is fundamentally wrong in it when applied to projects with the amount of generics we have.. It seemed internal to me, but maybe I was wrong. (Don't want to use internals from core.). Things got a bit ugly here. We should probably taketargetSizein Rotate and Skew Processor constructors and do the calculations outside the constructor..MathF` might be an exception because it's API is fixed, so we can't break compatibility by accident.. The whole buffer is pre-pinned in the constructor. (Unpinned in Dispose.). This is worth to check (and cry).. This isn't nice, but can't think of a better solution.. Looks like an implementation detail from the outside.\nCan't we hide this from the outside invoking it internally in a lazy way when Seed<TPixel> (and other variants) are invoked?. What we can do is to refactor the normalization logic into it's own stateful type (preferably a struct), where minimum/maximum/half values are nonstatic members initialized in the constructor.. I prefer to have more type safety in the codebase. (-1, 17 and 222 are invalid values for precision ;) ). I suggest an enum having the following form, so you can easily cast it to int when necessary.\nC#\nenum JpegPrecision\n{\n   EightBits = 8,\n   TwelveBits = 12\n}. We should add tests for 12 bit precision case.. \ud83d\udc4d  much simpler implementation!. Oops. The options I see:\n1. Keep the type as is (int), and introduce some DebugGuard checks in the code\n2. Introduce an enum defining all entries for 2-16\n3. Since we do not support lossless jpeg, define only EightBits and TwelveBits for now, and YAGNI out the rest, letting our future selves to find out how to manage the lossless case.\nI'm pretty much for option 3.\n. Isn't it worth to also seed both decoder and encoder instead?\nC#\nprivate static void SeedCodecs<TPixel>(IImageDecoder decoder, IImageEncoder encoder)\n{\n   // invoke both decoder and encoder in separate try-catch blocks\n}. Shouldn't we move this to SixLabors.Core?. The term identity matrix is only valid for square matrices! We should drop this.. This test depends too strongly on the current implementation. IMO a unit test for GetHashCode() should be only responsible for ensuring that for equal objects the hash code is also equal. (The opposite is not necessarily true!). The result of this multiplication should be either a 5x5 or a 4x4 matrix, depending on how we define the operation.\nAs for non-square fixed size matrices the multiplication has usually no practical use, I suggest to drop this operation.. Ok, let's keep it as is for now!. Missed that usage, thanks for pointing it out!. This will return a copy of the struct, so we can't go fluent here. (And we do not want chained calls for Derive().). Does this mean that something is missing from our coverage?. Oh wait, I haven't noticed the failing tests.\nIt's a sign that I should go to bed now \ud83d\ude04 . Maybe this whole class could be dropped and replaced with an array now.. I guess our current coding guideline suggests defining these in separate declarations ended with ;\n@JimBobSquarePants  correct me if I'm wrong.. You can also do this using a dot product leading to better berf.. You can premultiply/unpremultiply the whole span like here. Much faster!. Small piece of code executed on a compact list of data structures leads to surprisingly higher processing speed on modern CPU-s because of better cache locality, and better utilization of instruction pipelines.\nIf you haven't practiced this before, give it a try! This simple thing will lead to miracles in the performance of your code! Good question where to start though, probably google on stuff about CPU caches, and this thing: \"Data-oriented design\". . Is this mixed loop as default generic implementation faster than a sequence of bulk conversions + premultiplications? Could be only checked by a benchmark.. CPU caches and pipelines follow a different kind of logic sometimes :). ",
    "iamcarbon": "How about DCI-P3 / for wide color images on Safari?. Have we considered using System.Drawing.Primitives (implementing: Point, PointF, Size, SizeF, Rectangle, and RectangeF) as a shared library between SixLabors & ImageSharp? We got most of the helpers functions (inflation, intersections, unions, etc) on these for free as well.. @JimBobSquarePants -- awesome, I suspected there was a specification violation in how these were encoded. And good to know that there's an easy fix! . @antonfirsov do the current tests on master pass on .NETCOREAPP 2.1? are we breaking new tests with this update?\nI'll install the preview bits and see if we can fix the tests without cross-targeting. If we can't, it may be a good time to begin cross targeting the main project to .NETCOREAPP 2.1.\nI also think that there's been a few more breaking changes to Memory since the first preview release. We may also want to wait for preview2 when the API  is more stable.. @JimBobSquarePants There are breaking changes on Span in that I would expect to fail but this PR should fix them. Also curious.... I think 2.1 is a moving target until the Memory stuff stabilizes. Not sure it's worth supporting yet.. Ready for review. This PR primary focuses on replacing the custom Endian logic with BinaryPrimitives and simplifying the span copying code.\nWe should also consider exposing the LoadPixelData(Configuration, Span, ...) method and removing the Array overload if we do. We're copying the data to memory under our control so we don't need to worry about the lifetime of the original bytes.\nCC: @JimBobSquarePants @antonfirsov . @JimBobSquarePants Thanks for fixing the benchmarks. I'll give them a try tomorrow and see if there are any improvements or regressions switching to the native Span.CopyTo methods. . @JimBobSquarePants Got carried away! I'll stay focused on benchmarking things and fixing up any regressions so we can get this merged. . The difference between using the SpanHelper.Copy & Span.CopyTo in Slow Span (.NET 4.7) looks to be within the margin of error and we didn't regress on any of the other changes on these two benchmarks.\nWe should start seeing significant improvements when running on .NETCORE 2.1 and when fast span lands in the desktop framework.\nDecodeGif\nBaseline, PRE PR (Upstream / Master)  \u2014\nMethod |     TestImage |       Mean |      Error |    StdDev | Scaled | ScaledSD |   Gen 0 | Allocated |\n--------------------- |-------------- |-----------:|-----------:|----------:|-------:|---------:|--------:|----------:|\n 'System.Drawing Gif' | Gif/rings.gif |   423.3 us |   263.6 us |  14.89 us |   1.00 |     0.00 | 16.6016 | 105.37 KB |\n     'ImageSharp Gif' | Gif/rings.gif | 1,246.0 us | 1,902.2 us | 107.48 us |   2.95 |     0.22 |       - |   2.11 KB |\nPR \u2014\nusing SpanHelper.Copy\nMethod |     TestImage |       Mean |      Error |   StdDev | Scaled | ScaledSD |   Gen 0 | Allocated |\n--------------------- |-------------- |-----------:|-----------:|---------:|-------:|---------:|--------:|----------:|\n 'System.Drawing Gif' | Gif/rings.gif |   412.5 us |   305.7 us | 17.27 us |   1.00 |     0.00 | 16.6016 | 105.37 KB |\n     'ImageSharp Gif' | Gif/rings.gif | 1,372.0 us | 1,079.4 us | 60.99 us |   3.33 |     0.16 |       - |   2.11 KB |\nusing Span.CopyTo\nMethod |     TestImage |       Mean |      Error |     StdDev | Scaled | ScaledSD |   Gen 0 | Allocated |\n--------------------- |-------------- |-----------:|-----------:|-----------:|-------:|---------:|--------:|----------:|\n 'System.Drawing Gif' | Gif/rings.gif |   407.6 us |   170.7 us |   9.643 us |   1.00 |     0.00 | 16.6016 | 105.37 KB |\n     'ImageSharp Gif' | Gif/rings.gif | 1,242.7 us | 2,101.4 us | 118.733 us |   3.05 |     0.25 |       - |   2.11 KB |\nDecodePNG\nBaseline, PRE PR (Upstream / Master)  \u2014\nMethod |      TestImage |     Mean |     Error |    StdDev | Scaled | ScaledSD |   Gen 0 |   Gen 1 |   Gen 2 | Allocated |\n--------------------- |--------------- |---------:|----------:|----------:|-------:|---------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|----------:|\n 'System.Drawing Png' | Png/splash.png | 2.730 ms |  4.729 ms | 0.2672 ms |   1.00 |     0.00 | 74.2188 | 74.2188 | 74.2188 | 240.54 KB |\n     'ImageSharp Png' | Png/splash.png | 7.718 ms | 13.086 ms | 0.7394 ms |   2.84 |     0.31 |       - |       - |       - |   97.2 KB |\nPR \u2014\nusing SpanHelper.Copy\nMethod |      TestImage |     Mean |     Error |    StdDev | Scaled | ScaledSD |   Gen 0 |   Gen 1 |   Gen 2 | Allocated |\n--------------------- |--------------- |---------:|----------:|----------:|-------:|---------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|----------:|\n 'System.Drawing Png' | Png/splash.png | 2.695 ms |  3.219 ms | 0.1819 ms |   1.00 |     0.00 | 74.2188 | 74.2188 | 74.2188 | 240.54 KB |\n     'ImageSharp Png' | Png/splash.png | 7.665 ms | 13.537 ms | 0.7649 ms |   2.85 |     0.28 |       - |       - |       - |   97.2 KB |\nusing Span.CopyTo\nMethod |      TestImage |     Mean |    Error |    StdDev | Scaled | ScaledSD |   Gen 0 |   Gen 1 |   Gen 2 | Allocated |\n--------------------- |--------------- |---------:|---------:|----------:|-------:|---------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|----------:|\n 'System.Drawing Png' | Png/splash.png | 3.047 ms | 2.904 ms | 0.1641 ms |   1.00 |     0.00 | 74.2188 | 74.2188 | 74.2188 | 240.54 KB |\n     'ImageSharp Png' | Png/splash.png | 6.939 ms | 1.496 ms | 0.0845 ms |   2.28 |     0.10 |       - |       - |       - |   97.2 KB |\nTesting environment details:\n| Intel Xeon CPU E5-2663 v3 2.80GHz, 1 CPU, 10 logical cores and 10 physical cores\n| .NET Framework 4.7 (CLR 4.0.30319.42000), 64bit RyuJIT-v4.7.2633.0  [slow span]\n. Update: If OK with @JimBobSquarePants, let's wait to merge this until after Beta 3 to be safe. I have some more changes I want to make in the ExifReader / Writer to reduce allocations.. @dlemstra -- I'm seeing if we can make ExifValue a structure -- it's immutability will be important if we do. Will revert its immutability if this doesn't pan out.. Yep, pulling out of the idea of making ExifValue a struct -- it's too big and we won't be able to access it by reference until we get a list that exposes an ItemRef method. I'm going to revert the immutability.\n@dlemstra We currently have a SetValue method on ExifProfile that's equivalent to setting it directly from the values list. Going to revert the immutability & WithValue method, but think we should consider making the setter internal -- forcing everything through ExifProfile.SetValue.  Let me know your thoughts.. OK! This is ready for review. We reduced the allocations in the ExifReader & Writer significantly.. OK, done for real. #promise . Good catches.

OK, this is ready for review.\nWorking to kill the EndianBinary(Reader / Writer) now that we have all these nice new memory helpers.. @antonfirsov Good feedback w/ suggestions applied!. Travis, are you ok?. Ready for review. Hoping to kill EndianBinaryWriter after this!. Hold, I have an IDEA.. Going to increase test coverage on these blocks. Hold off on review for now.. Alright, think this is good chunk of changes for this PR. Ready for review.\nCC @JimBobSquarePants @antonfirsov.. Ready for review.. Ready for review.. This eliminates a ton of garbage encoding long GIF frame sequences.\nStill loads more coming from dithering though.\nNot sure if I'm happy with the shape of IFrameQuantizer. Can you think of any other ways to reuse the buffer for the GIF sequence? Should we try to use a buffer for palette too?\n. @JimBobSquarePants No rush. Let me get benchmarks for a real test case working and will explore some different approaches that let us retain the quantized frame. We might be able to get most of gains by allocating directly from the MemoryManager. \nUnscientifically, I believe the brought the encoding time of the jazz.gif from 6 to 4 minutes. Pushing to get it under 60 seconds. At least 3.5 minutes are spent in the dithering path.. Notable: All tests pass on .NETCORE 2.1.\n. Ready for review..

Any downsides?. @JimBobSquarePants Ready for your final review.. Can you try the nightly build to see if this resolves the problem?. Looks like we're still using dotnet-sdk-2.1.300-rc1-008673 for the Travis build. Are we able to update this to the final release?. Being able to read and write spans directly to and from streams is a big improvement.\nBut I agree, the ifdefs get gross.. Added extension methods to Stream to reduce the #ifdef statements along with a few more examples of where they can be used to eliminate allocations.\nReady for review!. No clue why downgrading the Unsafe package fixed the build. Also, not sure if a fix is imminent with the release of the 4.5.1 packages. Going to look into this more on Monday. . Updating Unsafe to v4.5.1 fixed the assembly binding issues. This should be good to merge.. @JimBobSquarePants Heck yes! This is a gigantic speedup!!!!. Ready for review.. Ready for review.. @JimBobSquarePants It makes sense to get these remaining colorspaces into Colourful using double precision math and compare benchmarks. That would be a good starting point to consider replacing our implementation.  \n. @JimBobSquarePants And that's before any SIMD optimizations!. Yep -- will add test coverage!. Ready for review.\n@JimBobSquarePants  -- let me know when you're branch PR is up. I want to take another pass on this after that's merged in.. @JimBobSquarePants -- going to rebase and resubmit this PR when you're done with your stuff. . This is an Xamarin bug loading the System.Memory library-- are you able to raise the issue over there?. I think that ImageSharp needs to stay clear of implementing any patent encumbered formats including BPG and HEIC. This could also be implemented as an external plugin by another developer.. Ready for review.. Ready for review.. We should also consider dropping net47 (we have net462 & net471).. Ready for discussion!. OK, I think I got everything. Ready for review.. Things got busy. Going to pick up on this later.. Ready for review.. Ready for review.. @JimBobSquarePants done and done.. @JimBobSquarePants Ready for final review.. Implemented in https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/pull/746. @antonfirsov -- Yeah. :( \nEven worse, their latest plan was for .NETCOREAPP3.0 to be the first runtime to implement .NETSTANDARD2.1. And it doesn't look like the desktop framework will ever implement it.\nThere may never be a full unification. . Looks like a few new xunit serialization errors upgrading to 2.4.1. Will dig in later.. Single unrelated GDI error on 32bit. Otherwise, all tests pass.. Ready for review. . I created a minimal test case that hits this path.. Ready for review.. @dlemstra Thanks for the feedback. Addressed the PR with one comment. Let me know your thoughts on throws. I've been letting them slowly creep in in my prior PR's -- we should make a call.. @JimBobSquarePants PING.. @JimBobSquarePants I submitted a PR in core to polyfill HashCode. Stacktraces coming soon.. Here are examples of the stack traces.\nFor trivial argument validation on public methods, I believe we should prefer inline throws to improve the stack traces (brevity + clarity). This also eliminates code generation for the generic function and a call.\nTHROWING USING GUARD HELPER\nE:\\ImageSharp\\src\\ImageSharp\\Common\\Helpers\\Guard.cs(294,0): at SixLabors.ImageSharp.Guard.ThrowArgumentNullException(String parameterName)\nE:\\ImageSharp\\src\\ImageSharp\\Common\\Helpers\\Guard.cs(29,0): at SixLabors.ImageSharp.Guard.NotNull[T](T value, String parameterName)\nE:\\ImageSharp\\src\\ImageSharp\\Formats\\ImageFormatManager.cs(127,0): at SixLabors.ImageSharp.Formats.ImageFormatManager.SetEncoder(IImageFormat imageFormat, IImageEncoder encoder)\nE:\\ImageSharp\\tests\\ImageSharp.Tests\\Formats\\ImageFormatManagerTests.cs(34,0): at SixLabors.ImageSharp.Tests.ImageFormatManagerTests.Stack()\n\nTHROWING DIRECTLY\nE:\\ImageSharp\\src\\ImageSharp\\Formats\\ImageFormatManager.cs(129,0): at SixLabors.ImageSharp.Formats.ImageFormatManager.SetEncoder(IImageFormat imageFormat, IImageEncoder encoder)\nE:\\ImageSharp\\tests\\ImageSharp.Tests\\Formats\\ImageFormatManagerTests.cs(34,0): at SixLabors.ImageSharp.Tests.ImageFormatManagerTests.Stack()\n\n.

The implicit cast doesn't seem to pick up in this case. Removing this comment (should revisit later). . Agreed. If this class grows, we'll want it to be a reference type. Reverting.. @dlemstra -- Agreed.. Nope. Changing to ReadOnly.. Annoyingly, we can't use stack allocated memory (prior to NETCORE 2.1) for the stream reads. Removing these comments for now.. The core header is only 12 bytes -- so  the cast won't work here. Adding one more check for the full cast case to make sure we're always passing 40 bytes...\n. Much nicer!. Braces should be on their own line for consistency with the rest of the code base.. We can also update the constructor to take a ref:\npublic Argb32(ref Vector3 vector). These format nicely on single lines with rocketships.\nget => return Unsafe.As<Argb32, uint>(ref this);. NICE! \ud83d\udc4d . Put brace on new line.. Put brace on new line.. Put brace on new line.. Put brace on new line. I'll stop commenting on the braces!. Reverted. VS used to create these service references for test projects. It hasn't for a few releases now. Are there any legacy tools that still need this? cc: @antonfirsov . @JimBobSquarePants Removed the System.Numerics.Vectors reference all together. I think the NuGET package just type forwards everything to the builtins anyhow.. This methods only caller is guarding against null and empty. I added some tests to verify this behavior. . This should only throw if the we try indexing into the palette outside it's bounds.. Agreed. I'll update the PR shortly. Also need to figure out why that test is failing.. Updated.. No count on IEnumerable. . Hah! I was going remove the backing vector from the other colorspaces next! Nice to know that we can eek even more performance out of this! . I submitted PRs across the repos to increase the NETSTANDARD target to v1.3.. Latest is tied to the environment. I think we should keep this explicit.. Updated! . Was on the fence whether or not to update all of these to use an integer or call GetHashCode and left as is for the PR. . Going to update these all to using GetHashCode() for consistency with the rest of the codebase.. They look nicer, but are they worth the expense of an extra call and a convoluted stack that shows that the exception occurred within the Guard method instead of the actual callsite? I would advocate that we eventually replace all Guard methods with methods that throw inline so the user knows exactly where the problem is.. done. done. Oh, I like that better.. I spent 30 minutes on this before. I'll take another stab in CQ11.. ",

    "tompazourek": "Hi James, no problem, I'm happy it can contribute to something \ud83d\ude04 \nThe library is not really optimized for performance, it's more a demonstration of some algorithms at this point, so I am not sure how helpful it will be when some of the conversions are applied to full images. I think some of the things that are possible to optimize are to use linear transformations in more places (even if it would mean losing some precision), but unfortunately I'm not that good at math to figure those out by myself. Also I do all the linear transformations that are there by trivial matrix multiplication algorithms I wrote, which I'm sure can be optimized somehow to utilize CPU/GPU better.\nBut feel free to use it as you need, I've licensed it as MIT for a reason.\nCheers,\nTom.

An IBrush then becomes a source of colors and an IShape/IPath in turn just control a region of the image to apply the brush to. (therefore there isn't a PathBrush as it doesn't end up making much sense in this model)\nI feel the current method for drawing outlines with details in IPen isn't quite right. At the moment the current method is limited to a solid line with rounded endcaps/corners and thus I feel it need re-engineering to support things line line patterns (dashes etc) and end caps etc. \nThe way I envision this working is for an IPen to take in an IPath and based on the IPens settings convert it into an IShape then pass that over to the FillShapeProcessor to fill with the IPens  configured IBrush.\nThere is additional scope to optimise Shapes somewhat, at the moment we support arbitrary polygons via ILineSegments, but we can easily add specific implementation for well know shapes Rectangles, Circles etc and they should be able to implement the interface in a mush more efficient manor than the generic implementation.\nNone of this code (I would think) is particularly optimised, and I'm probably doing some horrible things with colors and allocating way to much memory but its a start.. > You're way out of my comfort zone here (A bit mathsy for me)\nIts alright, its a bit mathsy for me too... its just stuff I've cobbled together for different sources, I definitely don't understand all the maths in there. \ud83d\ude01 \n\nI notice you have created a couple of new types PointF and RectangleF. I've been contemplating removing Point and using Vector2 only. What would be your thoughts on that? I've found that every method I've used Point for so far has involved casting to/from Vector2 so I'm very much inclined to drop it. That looks like it would simplify your API also.\n\nI think I like having Point and PointF for a public API as they are more prescriptive to end users but as soon as you get into internals then I can see using Vector2 all the way.\nThe outlines are a bit of a hack at the moment all i'm doing is filling the region that the thickness distance away from the shapes edge, which is why the IPen stuff needs fixing.\nAlso curves in general are a massive cheat in here, I'm cheating by converting all the curves into a number of liner segments that are very short thus visually identical at the pixel scales I've used thus far, but I imagine that for large images you will see noticeable issues with the curves but that would be solvable by just generating more segments. (possibly calculating the optimal count based on the curve length rather then hard coding it like is happening now.). I did have a version that used TColor but changed my mind from it (can't remember why now), but the closer I look I can't see any issue moving over to it..

Eventually there'll probably have to be static implementations of colors for the different IPackedPixel types but I'm not in any rush to do that as each color can pack a vector or use a constructor anyway.\nI had a play with just using TColor throughout but it felt rather dirty when you wanted to instantiate brushes and pens manually instead of using extension methods, or if you wanted to retain one for use between manipulations (and don't use var).\nI want to create a new SolidBrush(new Color(\"ff5565\")) not a , new SolidBrush<Color, uint>(new Color(\"ff5565\")) for an end user what is the uint doing there it would end up being some magic you would have to know to do to get it to work. Also you don't want the confusion around why doesn't this brush work with this image etc. It Just Should Work\u2122\ufe0f. \nSo what I've done it I've made the standard IBrush implementation depend on Color directly but as soon as you start to process the brush we create an IBrushApplicator<TColor, TPacked>  at which point we convert the color to the really TColor type and use that throughout the rendering.\nThis allows a single instance of an IBrush to be used across multiple images with multiple TColor types and still wok efficiently.. Bugger... guess I'll create some standard wrappers based on Color versions, I'll put them in and see how it feels then.\nI suspect there's going to be some issues dealing with opacity consistently for all those TColors  I'm currently quite dependent on that for anti-aliasing, I think I'm going to need a battery of tests for them all.\nI did see clipper but the licence made me pause as I wasn't sure it's compatiblity with MIT but looking over it it should be fine to include code from there, I'll have a look to see what I can lift from there to make things work smoothly.. status update, I've migrated the code to TColor and to use Vector4BlendTransforms.PremultipliedLerp for blending.\nWe now have things like IBrush<TColor, TPacked> with simplimentations like SolidBrush<TColor, TPacked> and I even created the default wrapper for Color so you can do things like new SolidBush(Color.HotPink) which is ends up being an IBrush<Color, uint>.\nAlso I have a couple of new shinies for you, ComplexPolygons now work and Pens have a sensible api allowing for path patterns.\nShiney\nComplex polygons\nAutomaticaly get simplified and support overlapping holes and outlines this is using the code from http://www.angusj.com/delphi/clipper.php \n\nalso works for outlines\n\nPen - line drawing\nPens now work too, you can draw a line with any custom pattern\n\nalso work with polygons, both simple and complex\n\n. Closing this as we have most of this now.\nNew issue for gradient bushes is #86. closing as ImageSharp.Web now lives in own repository https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp.Web. renaming to make the 2 issues different as one seems to be more easily fixable then the other.. @gdoron I just merged a fix for none-progressive jpegs... updating to the latest ImageSharp.Formats.Jpeg should help stop some of the issues your seeing, probably won't fix them all but it should help a bit.. the method got renamed to DrawImage(...). but you will need to make sure your also referencing the ImageSharp.Drawing pacakge. For testing for Jpeg you probably want to do this imageFormat == ImageFormats.Jpeg instead of testing the name test against the global static format instance.\nIf you want to default all Jpegs to be saved out with a particular set of options you can override the default encoder. see the  ChangeDefaultEncoderOptions sample. You can do the same for changing the decoders too.. its a public static readonly field on ImageFormats\nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/blob/master/src/ImageSharp/ImageFormats.cs#L18. Fixes #5 - mostly.\nWe'll want to spin out the Elliptical brush, and Gradient brush into there own issues that should be quite easy to implement once this PR lands, I think they would would make nice first timer PRs.. Now off to look at SharpFont \ud83d\ude01 and see If I can get that code ported in and working with the new drawing stuff.. RE: antialiasing\nI can now see why System.Drawing has a Graphics class for handling some of that stuff for you now I've been doing this work. By letting you wrap the calls down to the image with an object that can be configured with almost global(for that context) options without having to add drawing specific things to an Image.\nWhat to people think?\nShould I create a Graphics<,> class wrapping IImageBase<,> which will manage antialiasing and maybe in the future things like composition modes? or should I create a standard drawing configuration object that will need being passed into each call to DrawX(..)/FillX(...)? or should simple add a simple bool into all  DrawX(..)/FillX(...) to toggle on antialiasing or on or off?. > bool[,]\n\nMultidimensional arrays are slow I suggest to flatten them into a 1-dimensional array.\n\nI'll flatten them inside the PatternBrush so the constructor will still take in the multi dimensional array as thats by far the easiest cleanest way to define pattern, with a flat array in the constructor you would also need to provide a stride width and i feel thats not going to be intuitive for most users, or use a jaggerd array but that you can't easily enforce that all the rows are the same width, we let the compiler ensure the array is initialized properly then not the runtime.\n\nIEnumerable and Linq with value types\nEven frequent & redundant .ToArray() calls are better, than using IEnumerable and Linq with \"stream-like\" data. I suggest using simple arrays where possible, even if you break the encapsulation rules a little bit on A\nPI-s like ILineSegment.AsSimpleLinearPath() . Later we can use Span\n\nYeah i'll move those over to Vector2[] with the idea that they will eventually become ReadonlySpan<Vector2> once we have access.\n\nList<T>\nWhen the length of the result is known, or for members like BezierLineSegment.linePoints it's better to use arrays! (And if AsSimpleLinearPath() returns an array, you can return the array directly without torturing the GC with Enumerator instance creation.)\n\nTotally, will fix that too.\n. > One other thing I was thinking perf wise was passing params to methods. That allocates an array which we have no control over. I was think that if we passed arrays instead the end user could pool them if need be which would give them greater power over performance. What do you think?\nYou can still pass in an array when using params, just save those people who don't care about the array to not have to deal with them but allows those that do care to care.. Well did some benchmarks on the different ways I access the arrays used by patterns Pattern and it looks like jagged array wins.\n\n                               MethodMeanStdDevScaledScaled-StdDevGen 0Gen 1Gen 2\n\n       'ImageSharp Fill with Pattern'42.3406 ms1.2281 ms1.00   0.00437.5000437.5000437.5000\n'ImageSharp Fill with Pattern Flat Array'41.5260 ms0.7275 ms0.98   0.03470.8333470.8333470.8333\n'ImageSharp Fill with Pattern Jagged Array'40.6324 ms0.6159 ms0.96   0.03370.8333370.8333370.8333\n\n. Added a simple ImageBrush so you can now fill shapes/paths with Colors sourced from an image, making use of the fact that IBrushApplication/IPenApplicator are disposable.\n@antonfirsov not all patterns need be 4x4 i've just updated some so they are different shapes as they didn't need to be bigger.\n@JimBobSquarePants they way you've used  jagged arrays in the convolution classes looks fine the issue I have with them here is they are exposed via a public api where end users are expected the provide them for making custom pattern brushes. I think I'm happy, as you said If I find anything that needs changing then I can always just make another PR.\n. @antonfirsov \n\nHowever, all of your patterns seem to be 4x4 in size. Isn't it possible to cache the FG/BG/Etc colors into a Matrix4x4 ColorBuffer4x4 structure and batch the OnApply() -> IBrushApplicator.GetColor() -> IBrush.GetColor() calls to work on multiple pixels per call?\nThe difference in execution time will be HUGE.\n\nI did early on have a version of IBrushApplicator that could return multiple pixels at once but i figured that the added complexity wasn't worth it in the initial drop. But I can totally see it being an optimisation. \nHow is see it being done by creating int IBrushApplicator.GetColors(TColor[] outputBuffer, Vector2 start, Vector2 end). that would populate the colors wrapping at each line, and returning  the number of pixels found.. looking forward to it \ud83d\ude01 . Just taken a very quick look over https://github.com/LayoutFarm/Typography and it looks like it would be quite easy to create an IGlyphRasterizer based on the GDIGlyphRasterizer implementation that should work with the new ImageSharp.Drawing code.\n. awesome... I'll try and give this a play over the weekend and see if I can't get something drawing.. @dlemstra that's what I was thinking too. \nSomething like an ImageSharp.Drawing.Text package. That would solve the small problem of Typography targeting netstandard1.6 and ImageSharp targeting  netstandard1.1\nI even think everything in ImageSharp.Drawing should probably be in its own package too, but that's a separate discussion.. \u2728 I've had some success with my text prototype which can be found at https://github.com/tocsoft/ImageSharp/tree/font-render\nsome shinies for people\n\n\n. @prepare Yeah I noticed, What I've done for my prototype is just pull in the PixelFarm.OpenType netstandard project directly and but I retargeted at netstandard1.1 (which works fine as it doesn't actualy have any dependencies that are not available) and added the second net45 target so that it played nice with the rest of the ImageSharp project.. @prepare i'm guessing you've not got the OpenType project up as a nuget package or anything? if not then I think i'm just going to have to pull in the code directly (with attribution) and have it live inside the ImageSharp codebase but that'll just make it more difficult to pull in the newest updates when ever you make changed.... some food for thought I think.. I think i'm doing something dodgy with closing out the glyphs at the moment, i'm pretty sure those os aren't supposed to have there edges cut off like that.. @JimBobSquarePants nope the core library doesn't really need to target 1.6 I have it compiling targeting 1.1. The library already has classes/structs for Rectangle and Ellipse do we want to expand these by letting them implement IShape and push the logic down there? or should we create new classes RectangularPolygon and ElipticalPolygon which take an Rectangle and Ellipse as constructor args?\nIf we go for the second option the we would need/want to provide override extension methods that can take the  struct versions and internally convert them to the polygon versions.\nMy vote would be for option 2 creating RectangularPolygon and ElipticalPolygon but just after some opinions. . Shape are now handled by https://github.com/SixLabors/Shapes thus new primitive shapes should be requested over there.\nAdditionally, Ellipse/Circle, Regular 'X' sided shapes do now exist.. @olivif are you running the tests in release mode? I'm sure I've found that they run quicker in release mode (but i could be making that up).

Totally agree about text drawing being its own thing... it defiantly brings along its own baggage that the rest of drawing doesn't need.. @JimBobSquarePants then what should it be called? ImageSharp.Transforms?. Processors sounds good to me. @dlemstra  To be honest my main reason for keeping the version numbers in sync between packages is simplicity.\nIts much easier to have the build server manage version numbers without having to manually go into the code and update the versions in all the project.json when ever you need to bump the number.\nIf all projects in a solution share a version number you can blindly update the package number everywhere based on build and you can also know exactly which version the intern project dependency will be when building the nuget packages.\n@JimBobSquarePants It should be simple enough if we don't mind bumping all version numbers all together otherwise its a lot more manual work to put out a release.\nI've had a play creating an updated build project that uses gitversion and dotnet-version to handle all the package versions it will allow us to create a new final release by just adding a github release/tag and appveyor will build a full package without tag.. my main concern with the split is actually the formats, how are we expecting the formats to end up inside the bootstraper? I don't think you should rely on a user manually registering a format but then, from what I can see, that only leaves reflection based registration but that's then dependent on the dlls being loaded.\n'Tis a quandary, half make me think its not worth splitting out the formats at all, think its defiantly something that will need playing with.. Changes to split out ImageSharp.Drawing @ https://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/commit/c071ef2ba6e704b528b277555cbc3bed722806b8\nProducing this build : https://ci.appveyor.com/project/JamesSouth/imagesharp/build/1.0.0-tocsoft-split-projects.1+2974.build.271/artifacts\nTo add a new project to the build pipeline so that it will create a new package versioned with the reset of the projects is as simple as adding the path in build\\config.cmd this will ensure that that version numbers are all auto-magically updated.\nThis is just a nice early preview of what I'm thinking (added bonus this drops the node.js dependency from the build).. > What you've demoed is really cool but it introduces an issue. What happens if there are no changes within individual projects? Upping the version number and releasing a new package when there are no changes breaks semantic versioning which is a big no-no.\n\nPerhaps we could figure out a way to detect whether the individual projects have changed (via git) and only bump the version number then?\n\nThat'll be a nightmare, its not just tracking file changes in the project itself its also having to bump things on dependency changes, so you would end up needing to calculate the dependency chain for each project, and then start calculating the versions from there (tagging/suffixing as required).\nhmm.. actually I think I might have an idea on how to do it the more I think about it... I'll have a play tonight and see if i can get something working.. releasing out-of-band isn't the only reason to split it up its also to save end users from having to take all the extra stuff they don't need, i.e. the font loading dependency if they don't want to draw text etc.\nbut I do agree it would be nicer to only version the parts that have changed and their dependents.\nre: bootstraper \nCouldn't we have both? Have a global default instance of the bootstraper that will get used by the current new Image(stream) methods but also have one that takes a bootstrapper?\nc#\npublic Image(Stream stream)\n    : this(stream, Bootstrapper.Default)\n{\n}\npublic Image(Stream stream, Bootstrapper boostrapper)\n{\n    this.boostrapper = boostrapper;\n    //do stuff in here with stream and bootstrapper.\n}\npublic Image(Image parentImage)\n{\n    this.boostrapper = parentImage.boostrapper;\n    //do stuff in here with parentImage and bootstrapper here\n}\nIt would mean the only thing dependent on the static class/properties would be the simple constructors and everything internally would work in the referenced instance. But just to be clear I don't have a strong opinion either way, just offering up ideas.. Something else that just occurred to me, is Extension methods.\nI'm assuming all extension methods targeting ImageBase<TColor> should live in the ImageSharp namespace no matter the packages namespace?\ne.g. DrawPolygon(..) would be available in ImageSharp namespace event though the Polygon class will live inside ImageSharp.Drawing.... I've actually already put an automated build process together for the split projects. My build process even supports tracking & incrementing build numbers when ever it or one if its project dependencies is altered.\nThe build process is designed to just work\u2122 it should produce deterministic build numbers for each commit based on the branch your working on. With root version numbers managed within the project.json files.\nhttps://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/tree/tocsoft/split-projects (note: this branch might be rebased without warning)\nAll you need to do is run the build.cmd file in the root of the project and out will spit *.nupkgs properly versioned and will even clean up after itself to allow for local development to continue without added dirty state.. Most of these constants seem to be to be very specific to the particular color space they are declared in, I would probably leave these where they are. \nI think the only ones that make me stop and question is the VectorX.Zero ones but at the same time I can see it makes the code more readable and consistent across color spaces so I would be inclined to let them pass.. \ud83d\udc4d go for it.. Should bootstrapper be renamed Configuration now it's being passed into Image?. I'll take a look for you now to see if i can't figure it out the build issues... what I find odd is locally i'm only seeing 378 tests but on the build server i'm seeing 1309.. wonder why that is.. \ud83d\ude1e nope sorry can't figure out whats happening.\nWhat doesn't help is the way we loop the source images inside the test instead of passing them in, if you knew exactly which source image was failing it might help.\nMy only thought is you somehow have a 1x1 image being used when compiled by appveyor, that would cause your width /2 to return 0 but I can't see how that would be the case, or how your changes might cause that to happen. \nMaybe it was a bad checkout in appveyor and it corrupted an image, maybe try forcing a fresh build to see if that works?. once this is merged I'll throw up a PR for the project splitting, its kinda dependent on the Configuration changes otherwise we wouldn't have been able to split off the formats from the core as easily.. I've pinged you all for review as this is quite a large change, and feel we all need to have eyes on it.\nAlso keep in mind I feel we don't need the PR perfect exactly, as we can do subsequent updates do bash it into a better state.. @Andy-Wilkinson thanks for pointing out the travis build it now build them all, I think we can migrate travis over to a better build script later.. UPDATE: \n- Travis now fully builds ~and tests also runs the unit tests.~ failing tests in linux need investigating separately\n- dropped ImageSharp.Formats in favour of a reflection based autoload on the default Configuration... we will only auto load out core formats preventing users who don't want to have to think about formats to just be able to reference the formats they want and them just to work. (saves having to find the \"right\" place to register the formats). Think I've covered all the feedback now.. Awesome... I'll give everyone till 07:00GMT 2016-01-04 for anyone to raise any final issues and then I'll merge. (Will merge sooner if I get ok from everyone sooner). @antonfirsov that was a bug, i'd moved the file and missed a reference... I'm surprised it still built.. all merged \ud83c\udf89 . @JimBobSquarePants I think I've covered all your changes.. I disagree. The image constructor should not move the position. \nThe reason why this would be a bad choice for us to make is for compatibility with streams that don't allow setting the position at all, network streams are a good example, basically any form of forward only, read only streams.\nIn my experience (for this exact reason) it has always been the responsibility of the caller to make sure a stream is at the correct position.. Thanks a lot for this. Getting the tests running on linux is great. \ud83d\udc4d . I confirm managed to get the profiler to run against a test case \ud83d\udc4d . @dj-nitehawk  I can confirm, based on your test image, that .AutoOrient() is all you need to do to fix your issue.. Closing as this is not an issue with ImageSharp.\nFacebook seems to be manipulating the file before rendering.. @JimBobSquarePants based on the error message it looks like we are loading the Formats (otherwise they wouldn't have been listed in the error) but we are somehow failing to decode them.\nLooks like only ImageSharp.Formats.PngFormat, ImageSharp.Formats.JpegFormat, and ImageSharp.Formats.GifFormat have been loaded so unless the image is actually turning out to be a bmp it doesn't look like a simple configuration/referencing issue.. reopening as this is slightly different to the other issue... this is a none-progressive image the other is progressive. @vaindil The issue effecting your image has now been fixed if you upgrade ImageSharp.Formats.Jpeg to latest you should get the fix. (Fix landed in ImageSharp.Formats.Jpeg version 1.0.0-alpha1-00045)\nNote this only fixes the issue for none-progressive jpegs so depending on what images you have uploaded it might not work for all of them but it should help some. If you get any more that you can still open locally then it more than likely going to be related to issue #18.. nope... i've defiantly broken something. the fix is currently not working for progressive images.. OK fixed the issue with progressive images by not fixing them \ud83d\ude0f.\nBasically this fix will only work with none-progressive images at the moment, added a comment to help with any follow ups but I think the patch has value even if progressive images remain untreated.. OK just refactored the PR a little as the call to ProcessStartOfScan() always ended in a 0 mcuCounter so instead of counting MCUs we should be counting levels processed... this still works with our test images.. yeah I think @JimBobSquarePants you should roll back your commit, we should get the first none-progressive fix in first but leave #18 open and then take a look at progressive as a separate fix, as this at least fixes #83 . As it sounds like you aren't using nuget for you dependencies and thus missed one of your package depndencies, you will need to make sue you load in ImageSharps nuget dependencies yourself. \nYou can see our dependencies on myget by heading over to the core 'ImageSharp' package (https://www.myget.org/feed/imagesharp/package/nuget/ImageSharp) and hit up the Dependencies tab and work your way down the chain. \n. The missing dependency issue could be related to nuget.exe versions i'm pretty sure you have to be running a version on nuget > 3.4. I believe mono ships with its own version of nuget but its a custom patched 2.8.4 build you should now be able to use the latest nuget.exe from nuget .org on linux/mac using mono. (I believe its now mono compatible).\nbig caveat I am a windows dev on a windows machine and I haven't had to touch too much mac/linux/mono stuff outside of fighting with a build servers. I also reserve the right to be completly wrong \ud83d\ude01 . Looks like our net45 defiantly has dependency issues.. I have been able to reproduce. Not sure what the fix is yet.\n. Repoduction steps:\n\nin VS 2015 create new .net 4.5.2 console application\nAdd ImageSharp.Formats.Jpeg nuget package\nTry building\n\nExpected result\na running console application where I can open/write images\nActual results\nError showing\nFailed to add reference. The package 'ImageSharp' tried to add a framework reference to 'System.Runtime' which was not found in the GAC. This is possibly a bug in the package. Please contact the package owners for assistance.\n. This isn't going to currently work with the build setup we're using. The build process doesn't use nuget restore (we use dotnet restore) or msbuild (dotnet build) for project building so at the moment on the CI server this isn't being built at all. \nYou will need to add the below 2 to our appveyor.yml\nbefore_build:\n  - ps: |\n        if(-Not $env:APPVEYOR_PULL_REQUEST_TITLE)\n        {\n            git checkout $env:APPVEYOR_REPO_BRANCH -q\n            cinst docfx -y\n        }\nafter_build:\n  - ps: |\n        if(-Not $env:APPVEYOR_PULL_REQUEST_TITLE)\n        {\n            docfx ./src/docs/docfx.json\n        }\nThat will bypass the msbuild requirements by just using the docfx cli.\n@JimBobSquarePants the after build step (see example below) is where the tweaks to make it publish the docs to where ever the commit is needed to go (my vote would be to either a dedicate repo or the gh-pages branch on this one to avoid a lot of churn on the main commit history). \n https://github.com/docascode/docfx-seed/blob/master/appveyor.yml . We haven't yet released ImageSharp to nuget.org so there's no chance your working with an official release of our code. (we haven't haven't even released a full 1.0.0 yet, we are still in prerelease atm, let alone 1.0.0.7).\nPlease ensure your using our official myget feed https://www.myget.org/gallery/imagesharp for ImageSharp as I'm sure sure you will understand we can't support unofficial builds released by third parties.\nIn the interim I will close this issue, please feel free to comment back once/if you reproduce your issue with our latest official build and we'll reopen so we will can investigate further for you.. You are also going to want to add a dependencies on ImageSharp.Processing Contains methods like Resize, Crop, Skew, Rotate\nAlso you will want to add some codecs as required;\n- ImageSharp.Formats.Jpeg \n- ImageSharp.Formats.Png\n- ImageSharp.Formats.Gif \n- ImageSharp.Formats.Bmp . @Auersberg would it be at all possible for you to create a repository or a gist that recreates the issue with test images that we can use to debug the problem? Please ensue for each test image you describe actual vs expected details.\nOnce we have a consistent way of reproducing the issue we will do our best to resolve it for you as time allows.\nPS You are right about JPEGs, they are not our friends... especially with the buggy encoders out there and undocumented 'conventions' with regards how other libraries deal with technically corrupted files but loads them anyway.. That's awesome \ud83d\udc4d \nI'm sure one of us will be able to start investigating/fixing this soon.. @jrigsby The reason ImageSharp is reporting a dpi of 96 and windows 72 is that there is not DPI set in the image and if its not set then most libraries will use a default value instead. In windows that's 72dpi in ImageSharp it's 96dpi. . My initial thought would be that SetPixels should probably copy the passed in TColor[] into is internal memory that means that we never have to deal with pixel data that is owned by someone else when disposing of ImageBase which would prevent the need to catch the return in the array pool. it might be a tiny bit slower but it would be a lot safer.\nIt would also mean that the worry about leaks would be massively reduced as the rule of thumb can then be if you rent it you return it unlike in Convolution2DProcessor.cs where your renting a TColor[] but there's no obvious way in which its collected.\nYou could also have PixelPool<TColor> be able to return a PixelAccessor<TColor> would prevent the need to create an array then lock it and then return the rented array back, it would all be encapsulated in the PixelAccessor<TColor> which can get its own memory and release it in its dispose.\n. you could even have a version of setpixels that is optimized to just swap the backing data from the new pooled pixel accessor and the image that would prevent the copy and mean that the old data would be freed up with the pooled accessor (would have to be careful not to do this when both sets of data are needed to be retained, but if the method was internal and was called something else then it shouldn't be a problem). you are sort of the problem is your doing it in such a way that its hard to track who is currently in charge of what memory... at the moment it looks like Convolution2DProcessor.cs is leaking because your renting but never releasing within the same class/method. Your obviously not leaking there, but it looks like a leak, thus making it harder to maintain.\nI'll code up what I mean shortly and show you...seeing code is easier that trying to describe it. \ud83d\ude04 . ok had my play see 7940683d37b9259871d527f578b324d3ced9082d for how I propose we change this PR.\nThis way it means that most people don't even need to think about the PixelPool it just work for them.\nSorry but there ended being a lot more changes than I wanted but it ends up dropping the CopyPixels/SetPixel calls all together.\nEDIT : use this link to see the diff to ignore white space differences and allow for easier reviewing https://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/commit/7940683d37b9259871d527f578b324d3ced9082d?w=1. basically my changes moves the responsibility for Renting and Returning the TColor[] arrays to the PixelAccessor<TColor> & ImageBase<TColor> classes thus leaving us with alot less chance of leaking them, plus as they are both IDisposable now you can do away with the try{}finaly{}'s as long as you wrap them in using(..){...} statements.. Not sure about internal vs protected. However my gut says make everything internal/private until a third party dev needs access to it then decide on the best way to make it public then.. ### Before - master 8e56aaaf68177d6e6a14c5dee2a7d4772452895c\n``` ini\nBenchmarkDotNet=v0.10.1, OS=Microsoft Windows NT 6.2.9200.0\nProcessor=Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4770 CPU 3.40GHz, ProcessorCount=8\nFrequency=3312645 Hz, Resolution=301.8736 ns, Timer=TSC\n  [Host]     : Clr 4.0.30319.42000, 64bit RyuJIT-v4.6.1586.0\n  DefaultJob : Clr 4.0.30319.42000, 64bit RyuJIT-v4.6.1586.0\n```\n|                      Method |       Mean |    StdDev | Scaled | Scaled-StdDev |    Gen 0 |    Gen 1 |    Gen 2 | Allocated |\n|---------------------------- |----------- |---------- |------- |-------------- |--------- |--------- |--------- |---------- |\n|     'System.Drawing Resize' | 59.0057 ms | 2.2540 ms |   1.00 |          0.00 |        - |        - |        - |     512 B |\n|         'ImageSharp Resize' | 41.1233 ms | 0.5927 ms |   0.70 |          0.03 | 195.8333 | 195.8333 | 195.8333 |  20.08 MB |\n| 'ImageSharp Compand Resize' | 64.2315 ms | 0.6072 ms |   1.09 |          0.04 | 350.0000 | 350.0000 | 350.0000 |  20.08 MB |\nAfter - 7940683d37b9259871d527f578b324d3ced9082d\n``` ini\nBenchmarkDotNet=v0.10.1, OS=Microsoft Windows NT 6.2.9200.0\nProcessor=Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4770 CPU 3.40GHz, ProcessorCount=8\nFrequency=3312645 Hz, Resolution=301.8736 ns, Timer=TSC\n  [Host]     : Clr 4.0.30319.42000, 64bit RyuJIT-v4.6.1586.0\n  DefaultJob : Clr 4.0.30319.42000, 64bit RyuJIT-v4.6.1586.0\n``\n|                      Method |       Mean |    StdDev | Scaled | Scaled-StdDev | Allocated |\n|---------------------------- |----------- |---------- |------- |-------------- |---------- |\n|     'System.Drawing Resize' | 57.2351 ms | 0.6135 ms |   1.00 |          0.00 |     512 B |\n|         'ImageSharp Resize' | 39.3286 ms | 1.0688 ms |   0.69 |          0.02 | 186.33 kB |\n| 'ImageSharp Compand Resize' | 63.1998 ms | 0.9299 ms |   1.10 |          0.02 | 186.36 kB |\n. can't see one...go for it \ud83d\udc4d . ooo just remembered don't forget to update the readme to show your supposed to dispose of the images.. Hmm... food for thought for another day.\nWhile I've been fixing the changes to remove the Apply ImageProcessors extension method I makes me think it might be worth updatingIImageProcessorto take in aRegioninstead a rectangle and then all out processors can leverage polygons to apply there logic instead of just a rectangle.. For additional shapes I've added a couple of issues to SixLabor.Shapes so you can have ellipses & triangles, hexagons etc\nSixLabors/Shapes#5 & SixLabors/Shapes#4 then there would be no changes needed to ImageSharp to use them \ud83d\ude01 . (unless you wanted some extra, convenience, extension methods that is). Yeah no way around that if you want to draw more complex shapes above and beyond the simple ones provided. Its no different thatSystem.Drawingin that regards, you have to addSystem.Drawing.Drawing2Dto do anything more complex that the standard methods onGraphics`. ok to keep @JimBobSquarePants happy\n\n\n\nHere you go, 2 new shape types now you can draw all the triangles and ellipses your heart desires \ud83d\ude1d . > I don't think you added the dependency to the Nuget.Config did you?\nI've published the alpha version to nuget.org so we don't need a new nuget feed to pull it in.. @antonfirsov We could probably drop all the net451/net46 targets as they will just pickup the netstandard ones. We would only need to target them at the edges, in the test project etc. the core could/should probably be netstandard only.\nWe would then only have the 2 targets, netstandard 1.1 and 1.3 for FileSystem and everything else.. and even then it would only need to be the core ImageSharp package that needs to target 1.3 everything else would then only target 1.1.. you are currently giving the Image class an empty MemoryStream it has nothing to decode.\nThe latest builds would allow you to create an image directly from a file path. i.e. \nc#\n// requires netstandard1.3+ compatible run-time\nusing(Image image = new Image('file/path.png'))\n{\n    // do stuff with the image in here\n}\nor if you want to continue to use the stream apis you will want to do \nc#\nMemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream();\nawait file.CopyToAsync(ms);\nms.Position = 0; // reset stream to start position\nusing(Image image = new Image(ms))\n{\n    // do stuff with the image in here\n}\nor more likely you would just want to do if you already have a file stream to save you form the copy (as ImageSharp internally take a copy of the image data and doesn't require the stream to remain after the constructor has complete.)\nc#\nusing(Image image = new Image(file)) // assuming file is a FileStream who's lifetime is managed seperatly\n{\n    // do stuff with the image in here\n}\nFor performance reasons you will want to make sure you always dispose of Images once you are done with them.. glad to help. you need to reference one or more of the ImageSharp.Formats.XXX pacakges.. @JimBobSquarePants It was mostly done with regex find and replaces, then a round of trying to finding all the places they could be used.. I felt the syntax around using the Fast2DArray was a little clunky, so I've added in an implicit cast that reduces the boilerplate used everywhere.. or almost did until @antonfirsov beat me to pushing \ud83d\ude1b . ~I'm confused everything is still static just as static, all the change does is use the implicit conversion instead of  just uses the implicit conversion instead of the constructor directly?~\n~This change isn't instantiating anything any more than the original code did. In fact adding the width/height constructor actually saves us some memory as we don't need to create the new float [1, size] arrays at all.~. Lets try this again in english (I fail at typing today.):\nI'm confused everything is still just as static. All my change does is use the implicit conversion instead of the constructor directly, thusly is just syntactic sugar around your original code.\nThe only addition is to also have a constructor which take a height & width to same the additional allocation of the new float[1, size] arrays which are immediately discarded.. No the implicit operator is being called per static instance of the class exactly the same as the construct was before it... It would only be called per instance if I had changed the private static to just private that would be a different matter.\nFor example \nc#\nprivate static readonly Fast2DArray<float> KayyaliX =\n             new float[,]\n             {\n                 { 6, 0, -6 },\n                 { 0, 0, 0 },\n                 { -6, 0, 6 }\n             };\nThe above line will only be executed once, and after it is executed you will be left with a Fast2DArray<float> in a static field.. it will never be called again, it will never run the implicit operator again.... by shear fact that it is a static readonly field means that it would be impossible for the implicit operator to be called to set it again.. @JimBobSquarePants try out this https://dotnetfiddle.net/EnPIaw to demonstrate that the implicit operator is only called once even for 100 instantiations of a processor. @JimBobSquarePants no problem... you did have me doubting myself for a moment.. looks good to me, definitely like the reduced generic constraints.. Thanks @Toxantron \ud83c\udf89 \nAll merged in, nice little addition. Works on VSCode on windows, and it has no effect on Visual studio or the CI build \ud83d\udc4d . My vote is we don't merge this at all and feel we don't need a netstandard1.6 target.\nYou should always try and target the lowest netstandard version that your codebase needs not the highest. Ours is currently fully compatible with netstandard1.1 when we don't use the filesystem APIs and netstandard1.3 with them.\nI don't believe we should even be targeting the full frameworks at all (but that's a fight for another day) so I defiantly disagree with the netstandard1.6 target.\nWith regards upping the dependency versions to 4.3 that's a separate issue and is on the road map to be done with the port to the 2017/csproj based build system and is something I feel we should do.\nAll that said, I would like to thank you for your contribution and ultimately its @JimBobSquarePants decision with him being 'Grand High Eternal Dictator' \ud83d\ude01.. My only concern is the usage of optional arguments.\nWe shouldn't be using them on out public API's it makes them a lot harder to version in the future. See this blog post for details http://haacked.com/archive/2010/08/10/versioning-issues-with-optional-arguments.aspx/\nI understand there are more instances of this thru-out the codebase so its probably not worth bothering to fix it in this PR and we should instead creating a separate issue/PR fixing them all.\nApart from the optional arguments this looks good to me.. I've added an issue to track the required work.. this is now done as part of #143 . The root cause of this bug was in the SixLabors.Shapes library.\nThis has now been fixed, if you update your ImageSharp.Drawing.Paths to 1.0.0-alpha2-00068 (which is just updates our SixLabors.Shapes dependency) then your issue is resolved.\nThe fix landed in SixLabors.Shapes 0.1.0-alpha0007. Have you tried performing it in a loop to see if the memory keeps growing or just grows once and doesn't release?. Sounds like its our use of an array pool for storing the image data... Basically the memory will be reused for the next image and should only grow the once.. And there was go, we now have text drawing. \ud83d\ude00. The solution isn't in a state where the auto migration will work for it out of the box and it needs a cleanup pass before it will work... we plan to migrate the solution over to the new VS 2017 project formats soon but until we have performed the upgrade then you should use VS 2015 if you want to run the project locally.. RE breaking apis for the convolution processors and all other processors\nI think the first should be, instead of trying to figure out and agree on the correct api would be to make all our implementations of IImageProcessor<TColor> internal, as for most users they are just going to you the extension methods anyway so if we make them all internal then we can break them internally as we fix/update them to be more efficient without breaking the public APIs.\nOn a wider note I think its probably worth doing a pass across the whole library and internalise everything that we can, basically leaving interfaces, extension methods, colors the Image/Image<TColor> objects and anything else needed to make them compile, basically try to reduce down our public API to just the barest minimum surface area we can so we have the most flexibility in refactoring the core as required.\nI think for out first public release we could even keep the PixelArea stuff internal too as i can't imagine most of our developers will be doing must more than the simpler image manipulations, open file cop, resave etc and that's all going to be possible from the extension methods. \nThen later we can make a decision on each api on a case by case basis as we find a developer that needs access to that lower level stuff.. @JimBobSquarePants internalising the processors would not stop EntropyCropProcessor working, yes it would make it more difficult for a third party to create one but that's actually a separate issue and I believe shouldn't be a goal of first release.. we want to get something out that will help most users, and most aren't going to want to create custom processors.\nWe should worry about extensibility as a v2/v1.1 goal not v1 lets just get v1 out with our locked down processors and worry about unlocking them when and only when a third party wants in made public and not before.... we might never have a developer who wants to make a processor like that and thus we might never need to make them public.. make sure your trying from the build script as stylecop will work fine in VS but from the command line/build script it wouldn't find the stylecop.json file and ended up spending a a day or 2 trying to solve it and failed.\nYou also need to make sure the codecov/opencover stuff works too, that's what I spent most of my time getting working. Getting it to work with netcoreapp's was the challenge but I managed to solve it, I found I had to do a few msbuild tricks to make it output full pdb for the codecov build, but not for the package builds(so that debugging would work on linux)\nMy version here got the number of targets down to 2 for ImageSharp, 1 for ImageSharp.Drawing & 1 for the ImageSharp.Testing additionally I reenginered the whole set of project files so the includes seem to be right to me.. To test the issue you will need to reenable the headers rules in ImageSharp.ruleset by disabling rules SA1636 & SA1633. I just tried it and it didn't seem to make a difference for me and still failed \ud83d\ude1e\nI had tried various combination of AdditionalFiles/None etc and none of them worked.\nYeah I suppose that there's no reason at all that the brushes etc couldn't be in the Drawing package. The reason I did it that way as that code has no external dependencies, where as everything in ImageSharp.Drawing has some external dependency.. fixed in #168 . @dlemstra If I don't have the virtual SaveInternal() then I can't verify in my tests that all the same methods are doing the right thing in terms of defaults and passing options along etc. (well not anywhere nearly as easily)... I'll have a think to see if I can find a cleaner/different way to do this without the virtual method.\nRE: Resetting the stream position.\nI just copied that from the first same methods I migrated which was public Image<TColor> Save(Stream stream, IImageEncoder encoder, IEncoderOptions options) where originally we where resetting it back to 0 which I thought was really wrong so instead I reset back to start position. I'll remove this and leave it at the end of the stream.. @dlemstra I've figured a way to alter my tests to do away with the callbacks class.. don't use a pen instead use a brush or color \ntry \nc#\nvar top = height - 4;\nvar font = new Font(FontCollection.SystemFonts.Find(\"Arial\"), 10f, FontStyle.Regular);\nvar brush = new SolidBrush(Color.Black);\nimg.DrawText(orderTicket.Code, font, brush, new System.Numerics.Vector2(50, top), new TextGraphicsOptions(false));\nBasically the rule of thumb is a Pen is used for outlining/drawing lines which may or may not have a pattern where as a Brush is used to fill it in.. BTW its awesome to see this usage of it the library. \ud83d\udc4d . The Font library doesn't currently perform pixel grid aligning which should help knock the glyphs over to better match the pixel layout. I've added an issue over there to track that. SixLabors/Fonts#19 pixel grid aligning should be part of the problem.\nAdditionally I've never tested trying to get a font to render at a single pixel width, i'll have to have a play to see if there anything quick I can do to improve the renderer for you.\nYou could try seeing if offsetting the text by half a pixel helps i.e. draw the text at new System.Numerics.Vector2(50.5, top) instead of 50. (should do the same thing as the pixel grid aligning but manually, might help.)\nI'll have a play around with trying to draw the text at this size and see if I can make it \"just work\" for you.. @KLuuKer  try \"1.0.0-alpha4-00021\" or higher for both ImageSharp & ImageSharp.Drawing. \nIts still not as good as System.Drawing because I'm still not doing font hinting and grid fitting but it should improve general font rendering making small glyphs render better. \nYou will want to render using anti-aliasing for the closest match.. I suspect the allocations are in the SixLabors.Shapes side of the process, this can probably be alleviated by caching the shape objects and asking them to be filled directly instead of using the helper methods that take points and build the shape each time.. awesome \ud83d\udc4d look at my code its not even needed at all anymore. Should be a super easy win \ud83d\ude01 . OK, so everything's green on the build server and I've addressed all the immediate issues (more optimisations can come later) so I'm merging this to unblock @antonfirsov work.. I can't see anything thing in here that worries me. Looking good \ud83d\udc4d . This update will actually allow you to do this for testing \nc#\nImage<Color> image =new JpegDecoder().Decode<Color>(stream, options);. Overloads added\n You can now call \nc#\nbyte[] bytes = .......;\nImage img = Image.Load(bytes, new PngDecoder());. I just realised that when returning an Image as aposed to Image<TColor> at the moment I'm duplicating the pixel data... small change to come which should resolve them.. @JimBobSquarePants fixed the problem I spotted. Is everyone now happy with this?. Had a play with the argument ordering and totally agree moved the config args to the start.. @dlemstra I've taken your feedback into account you happier with this now?. The reason they are gone is because you are not supposed to be using them anymore, we rolled the formats and processors back down into the core ImageSharp package.\nAll you need to do is reference  ImageSharp and if you want the drawing APIs the optional  ImageSharp.Drawing.\nPS. The reason the symbols are still there is because we've failed to find the magic piece of myget's UI to hide them,. this sounds like its going to be something inside the Color specific BulkPixelOperations<Color> its the only time I can see us doing a uint[] to float[] conversion.\nmy guess is its around this line https://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/blob/69daa8464a30a62d5901d986a3ab620bbbbcff34/src/ImageSharp/Colors/Color.BulkOperations.cs#L66\n. Update based on a gitter chat\nI've update the title to reflect our findings thus far... issues seams to be related to Vector.IsHardwareAccelerated being false.. @kierenj i'm pretty sure if you set your azure website to run in x64 mode on the 'Application Settings' screen it should resolve your issue. In general  you will find that ImageSharp will run faster in x64 processes as we can then make use of SIMD options via System.Numerics.Vectors which only works via the x64 RyuJit jitter.. That's way of using Image.Load is exactly the way you want to be doing it if you want/need a custom config.. this should be fixed in version 1.0.0-alpha4-00046 for ImageSharp & ImageSharp.Drawing. due to the fact that TextGraphicOptions  is a struct I've gone with a property called UseImageResolution to toggle this feature on or off. the invert was required due to the fact that bools default to true in structs and I wanted to ensure that feature was enabled by default.. The few I've looked over seem to.. totally agree with @antonfirsov here. Lets our users limit the max pool size to use... the difficulty might be around the LimitInBytes as it looks like the total size will be limited not a limit by Type... might have to see if there's a way we can solve that and have it be a shared size (maybe internally we use a common byte[] pool and use Unsafe.As<> to cast them to the correct type thus the array pool will share a common memory limit.). ah well that's unfortunate \ud83d\ude1e . In that case If/when we add the IArrayPoolProvider you would be able to make one that fakes out the ArrayPool<T> abstract class with one that just allocates arrays and ignores the Return(...) that will just allow the GC to do its work on the arrays.. I agree CPU is probably the way to go, but I feel we need much better control over our ArrayPool usage and try to limit ourselves as much as possible to the types we allow ourselves to be requested from pools. We should limit our use of array pools to byte, float & TColor wherever possible. . I think a Performance property added to Configuration would make the most sense, this would then allow us to tune various subsystems centrally.\nI'm thinking the property would just be an enum like:\nc#\nenum PerformanceCharacteristic\n{\n     Default = 0, \n     Fastest = 1, // should use the CPU optimised path\n     LowestMemory = 2 //should use the memory optimised one\n}. Looking good to me.\nOnly thing I can see is I think ResetAllPools() should be called ReleaseMemory(). I thought you might appreciate this PR \ud83d\ude09 \nI can't promise its the best comparer but its a start and we can always tweek the internals of it now it exists.. everyone happy with this now? . I've had a look over this, do we need the GetBytes(...) methods in the bit converter? I feel we don't want to make it easier to accidentally use code path that can cause high allocations.. I guess will be this is due to the fact that this image has an ICC profile associated with it.\nCurrently we don't have ICC profile support, but we are currently actively working on getting it in.. looking good to me, only thing this PR makes me notice is we now have a lot of instances of Math.Abs(var) > Constants.Epsillon I realise that those are outside the scope of the PR but we might want to normalise them down to use a static ApproximateFloatComparer.. \ud83d\udc4d . writing to a memory stream works fine you just need to remember to set stream.Positon =  0; before calling Image.Load(stream) how ever you should not need to do that, I introduced a bug while migrating the code into the static Load method this has been fixed on master.\nI'll let you know the package version once its finished building.\n. 1.0.0-alpha5-00049 has this fix in. note the reason you will need to run the test using the PixelAccessor is because there is a bug in ImageComparer.CheckSimilarity(expected, actual); which means its basically just not working unless all pixels are different, I've fixed that but in doing so discovered this one.. You need to create a new Instance of a Font instance specifying the new size required\nc#\nFont oldFont = ... ; //a font you have.\nFont newFont = new Font(oldFont, 99f); //use old font to define style and family but set the new size\ncheck out http://fonts.sixlabors.com/docs/getting-started on working with font objects.\nIn future please direct questions of this nature to our gitter room https://gitter.im/ImageSharp/General\n. try\nc#\n            using (Image img = Image.Load(input))\n            {\n                var options = new ResizeOptions\n                {\n                    Size = new Size(230, 140),\n                    Mode = resizeMode\n                };\n                img.MetaData.Quality = 0; // reset the Quality to 0 to force us not to generate an Indexed PNG\n                img.Resize(options).Save(result);\n            }\nlooks like we are retaining a \"Quality\" measurement between decoding and encoding and our Indexed encoding is only allowing a single masked transparency channel thus we loose the variable opacity of the original when we re-encode.. sounds good to me.\nCan we also add a first step that will check if the picture we are encoding even needs its pixel colors reducing? for example if I've opened and indexed png, cropped out a portion and then resaved it the image won't suddenly have more colors than before.\nI should be able to save that png without requiring a full Quantization pass just a partial one to create the palette lookup. For simple pre-processed images should save us having to perform a full  Quantization pass unless we added enough colors to reach the palette limit.. no I just ment we should take the output of the first pass and see if the number of distinct colors is under the palette size threshold and if it is don't bother doing the lossy reduce stage and just return the first pass data as a QuantizizedImage.. also side note, the opacity of the 2nd one seems to be wrong, the blue of the octopus has an alpha of 254 instead of 255.. maybe we should just drop the XxxxEncoderOptions/IXxxxEncoderOptions objects and just move their options directly onto the XxxEncoder objects, that would simplify the Image.Save(...) APIs, I feel it would be more explicit around which encoder we are going to be using and also reduces the surface area of our public API. as we can remove all the IEncoderOptions overloads. \nWhatever we do we will also want to do the same things to the Image.Load(...)/XxxDecoder overloads so they mimic each other. . This is now being closed as we no longer have EncoderOptions and instead set the configuration directly on the encoder and thus it will save it in the format specified.. this looks like its actually a nuget restore issue, and the way it handles pre-release dependencies, i've bumped the version numbers an hopefully that should resolve it\nYou will want to make sure your on\nImageSharp 1.0.0-alpha6-00049 and ImageSharp.Drawing 1.0.0-alpha6-00010 they should pull in the correct versions of SixLabors.Fonts &  SixLabors.Shapes and allow everything to just work.. looks like your build isn't using the latest version of SixLabors.Fonts as that method is defiantly there.. Look like it's an image specific issue, Please provide a copy of the image that causes this issue.. My bad, failed to spot the link.. There isn't anything built in at the moment.\nFor the moment you'll have to roll your own logic to decide the left offset required. You will need to use  the SixLabors.Fonts.TextMeasurer class to accomplish this.\nYou can see an example of using the TextMeasurer it in this blog post http://sixlabors.com/2017/04/08/watermarks/.\nNOTE: I do plan on adding on alignment settings to TextGraphicsOptions in the future.. in versions > 1.0.0-alpha8-00061 you can now specify a TextAlignment on the TextGraphicsOptions that you can pass in to DrawText().\nHow it works:\nIf you specify text alignment but don't specify a WrapTextWidth then the alignment start from the location the text is drawn at. i.e. if right aligned text with WrapTextWidth == 0 (no wrapping) then the right hand edge of the text will be at the drawing location.\nIf you specify a WrapTextWidth > 0 then it will be ralative to a location between Location and location + WrapTextWidth. i.e. Location  = (100, 100) and WrapTextWidth = 300 and TextAlignment == Center then the text will be rendered centered on (250, 100), or if TextAlignment == Right its right edge will be rendered from (400, 100).\nExample of Center aligned text:\nVariables in scope\nc#\nstring text = \".......\";\nImage<Rgba32> image = .....; // image class\nFont font = ...; // font loaded;\nCenter aligned no wordwrap\n```c#\nVector2 center = new Vector2(image.Width/2, 10); //center horizontally, 10px down \nimage.DrawText(text, font, NamedColors.Black, center, new TextGraphicsOptions(true){\n    TextAlignment = TextAlignment.Center\n});\n```\nCenter aligned with wordwrap\n```c#\nfloat padding = 10f;\nfloat textMaxWidth = image.Width - (padding * 2); // width of image indent left & right by padding\nVector2 topLeftLocation = new Vector2(padding, padding);\nimage.DrawText(text, font, NamedColors.Black, topLeftLocation , new TextGraphicsOptions(true){\n    WrapTextWidth = textMaxWidth,\n    TextAlignment = TextAlignment.Center\n});\n```. Awesome, the colors are looking way better.. That's an issue I've seen too I'm sure its a bug in VS close and reopen VS and it'll show up in intellisense.  Definitely can't be an issue with our project as we are producing just a standard nuget package.. I would recommend you report the issue using the send feedback button from within visual studio. If you report the issue while its happening Microsoft will receive loads of extra telemetry to help them solve the issue. Its very much a Visual Studio issue because if you code anyway and do a build it'll build fine. \nWe are just publishing/building a vanilla NuGet package, packaged using the dotnet cli so the the lack of intellisense can't be a bug introduced by us.\nI'm closing this issue now as its outside of our control.. @agoretsky we now have an example of exactly how to do that https://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/blob/master/samples/AvatarWithRoundedCorner/Program.cs its dependent of stuff in builds >= 1.0.0-alpha9-00148. I've not manage d to review this yet but I have been planning a similar piece of work for a little while so you've just saved me a whole heap of time \ud83d\udc4d.\nI'll review this over the next few days and get it/a version of it merged in soon. I'll be more looking at it from a vector drawing angle but I'll get the APIs working consistently across all the drawing methods.. @vpenades I'm looking at how to change the internal APIs at the moment to figure out the best/most efficient way of introducing your code. \nMy plan is to extend the GraphicsOptions struct allow setting a pixel blender and blend amount on all of the Drawing APIs. \nI'll let you know if there's anything I come across.. The things you've been saying about bulk apply etc are already things I'm addressing/addressed in my local branch. \nI'll let people see something soon. \nBasically I'm taking queue from things like the BulkPixelOperations<T> apis (in fact my plan is to actually rename it PixelOperations<T>) and have it be a general pattern/location for doing generic pixel operations that can optionally be optermised on a PixelType by pixel type bases. \nI've just been dragged out for a few hours, but my wife is out on a hen night tonight so I've got all evening and into the night which I'll be devoting to this.. @vpenades thanks for this, we've now merged in version... We now have a version of DrawImage that takes in a enum of type PixelBlenderModes that let you pick the type of blending... I the future (post V1 release) we'll introduce a way of providing custom pixel blending functions.\nYou can specify the blending mode of a majority of Additive operations, drawing images/shapes/text and things like glow etc by setting the PixelBlender property and the PixelBlenderPercentage property on GraphicOptions that can be passed in.. Merge now, as you said we can worry about optermising later . haha... I literally added this to SixLabors.Fonts first thing this morning before heading out to work... I planned on exposing this in ImageSharp this evening.\nSharp eyes for spotting it.. duplicate of #185 . Just want to capture this too. When this is done we have some places in ImageSharp.Drawing that have a similar pattern, we have various Brushes, and a Pen class that should also be removed at the same time.. In my opinion feels nicer to type Image.Load<TPixel>(...) than Image<TPixel>.Load(...). Maybe even just leave Image<TPixel>.Load() in but also add Image.Load<TPixel>() versions in that just call down into the first. . Also could you provide a code example when you provide version details as crop/resize functions have no impact the decoder they are entirely separate systems.. closing this as Imagesharp.Web is now in its own repository\nSee SixLabors/ImageSharp.Web#5 for a copy of the initial issue. The problem is it would be very easy to miss the fact that the width and height are required values if its a Format. \nAdditionally a format implies the input/output is round trappable but that wouldn't be the case as the data would be missing the important dimension data.. The way I had envisoned the updated IMemoryManager based api working would be as so.\nWe would add a new interface IMemoryManager and expose a public property on Configuration called MemoryManager. Also add to IImageEncoder IMemoryManager MemoryManager {get;set;} for overriding the memory manager on a per encoder bases.\nAll places that currently call Buffer<T> or Buffer2D<T> should be replaced to calls that back onto the MemoryManager sourced from eather the encoder or the images configuration.\nProposed interface design.\n```c#\n   public interface IMemoryManager \n   {\n       IBuffer Allocate(MemoryUsageHint hint, int size);\n   }\npublic enum MemoryUsageHint \n{\n    // very short term buffer, things like a temp buffer for \n    // passing around a single row of an image\n    Tempory,\n\n    // lifetime for an entire ImageProcessor action we should be only requesting \n    // a few of per-image prrocessor run, but will usually be a \n    // larger size, most likely the size of the image buffer\n    Process,\n\n    // this memory will live for the lifetime of the image \n    //itself (unless switched out during resize) \n    Image,\n\n}\n// this is basically an interface wrapper around some owned memory\n   public interface IBuffer : IDisposable \n   {\n       // this is used to effeciently switch the backing data\n       // from one buffer with another, we do this in some ImageProcessors\n       // some backign providers could to a pixel copy, others could \n       // just return false for not supported, where as other would acutally\n       // switch out the backing array from each.\n       bool SwitchBuffer(IBuffer buffer); \n       int Size { get; }\n       Span Span();\n       Dispose();\n   }\n```\nWe would then have extension methods targeting IMemoryManager that exposes Buffer2D<T> Rent2DBuffer<T>(this IMemoryManager mng, MemoryUsageHint hint, int width, int height) and probably just some simpler IBuffer<T> TemporyBuffer<T>(this IMemoryManager mng, int size), IBuffer<T> ProcessBuffer<T>(this IMemoryManager mng, int size), IBuffer<T> ImageBuffer<T>(this IMemoryManager mng, int size) to simply internal usage.\nnotes\nOur inital implementation for this should probably do the following.\n\nif MemoryUsageHint == Tempory the we use a array pool if size <  a tempThreashold else we use new array\nif MemoryUsageHint == Process the we use a array pool if size < a procThreashold else we use memory mapped file (or just a simple array for now)\nif MemoryUsageHint == Image new array if size < imgThreshold else we use memory mapped file (or just a simple array for now)\n\nThe Array bool can acutally be backed by a single byte[] pool the the IBuffer<T> can use Span.UnsafeCast<T>()(or what ever the api is) to convert the backing byte array into a Span<TPixel> allowing us to use a single array pool for all all the memory across all the pixel types.\nFor the few places its acutally not possible to get a IMemoryManager to (Regions spring to mind) then we can pobably jsut get away with using a separate, less used, array pool that's entirely divorced from the memory manager until the API can be amended to get access to it. \n. As we would be required to expose IBuffer<T> on the public API then we should probably add new constructor to Image allowing to pass in a buffer to be used as the images backing store. (this would then allow us to have images that are backed by memory owned by other processes.). It depends on the actual implementation of the memory manager but most likely no it wouldn't and if the actual backing store is different/incompatible then they it would most likely do a Span -> Span pixel copy instead.. Basically if the 2 IBuffer<T> instances where sourced from a single IMemoryManager then I would expect then to be able to switch out some internal store reference, but if they where sourced from different IMemoryManager instances then they would probable do the pixel copy instead of fail/return false if the copy can't happen because the left hand buffer doesn't have the internal capacity to handle the size of the right hand buffer.. Not really in terms of specific, I think i'm trying to future proof the API somewhat (for when we decide to introduce memory mapped files as an alternative backing store) and let anyone who wants to tweek how memory is allocated and/or retained (i.e. custom managers) have the most information to help drive in decisions about how memory will be used to help then decide where the buffer should be sourced from.\nWhat drove me in suggesting the hints I was just thinking about some of the lifetimes (and thus sizes) for some of the buffers we currently request during a single ImageProcessor call.\nWe will have a single long term retained buffer for all the image pixel buffer. These can easly be backed by memory mapped files etc as they are much longer lived.\nWe then have short lived buffers that will store a copy/variant of the entire pixel buffer for the duration of a processor call. (maybe 1 or 2 per call) \nThen we have all the smaller items (usually no bigger than the image width) and we request a lot more of these to do line level processing and pixel blending and passing into shapes for edge detection etc. We request these a lot more often (many concurrently) than the others but only for very short lifetimes ( duration of a single line processed). These for example should never be backed by memory mapped files as I can image they would be much slower, and possibly . No don't like it. Thats why we have the option of passing a custom configuration into load/constructors etc.\nIf you want to load a custom set of memory for the lifetime of a single image then you would create a custom configuration with a new specific memory manager for that image and then free up any resources yourself when you release the image.. Definitely shouldn't have implicit float -> int conversion explicit would be ok as long we we internally used the explicit conversion provided by the runtime instead of rounding ourselves( we would be consistent then) we should also provide static methods for Ceiling/Floor available on the float variants.. We should probably add some Traits to the test to define which ones are purely visual tests that need a human eye to those that have real asserts, we can then have the test runner to skip the Visual tests on the build server as no one can look at them anyway up there and should speed up our test execution, will also give us a more realistic representation of test coverage.. my guess is you have an image that's been rotated using metadata, I bet that if you inspected the image in both Explorer and ImageSharp before the resize it will also have the dimensions inverted.\nI recon is you change your code to\nc#\nusing (Image<Rgba32> image = Image.Load(\"foo.jpg\"))\n{\n    image\n        .AutoOrient() // <- fixes the pixel data orientation if the metadata differs to it.\n        .Resize(new ResizeOptions {\n            Size = new Size(300, 0),\n            Mode = ResizeMode.Max\n        })\n        .Save(\"bar.jpg\");\n}. merging this now.. Thanks for reporting this, I've now pushed a fix up. Once the CI server does its magic it'll be available.\nFor general information\nThis bug was only introduced for the image.Draw() family of apis when my last PR landed however the issue was affecting general image.Fill() ones for a while. obviously no one must have tried to draw shapes something partially off canvas.. Unknow marker is referring to an issue in the image itself.\nDoes it happen on all images or just the one? Have you confirmed the image loads with other software?\nPlease provide the image that's broken for us to be able reproduce your issue.. awesome thanks for that \ud83d\udc4d that was exactly what I needed to put together a fix..

The correct behaviour would be that the left/top edge should be the one cropped not the right/bottom.. should be prettty straight forward, just worth a bit of a sanity check cause its changing a lot of places. @JimBobSquarePants we good to go on this now? or do @dlemstra and @antonfirsov want to take a look over it first?. 8bd785a switches things up somewhat and reintroduces IImageFormats but changes how you deal with them, ImageFormats and decoders etc are still divorced form each other and only linked together at the Configuration level. Also renamed the IImageFormatProviders to IConfigurationModule to better relay what they are for. And not lockout other config level tweeks people might want to inject, eg FileSytem (if we ever make the API public).. @dlemstra have you had a chance to cast you eye over this yet, just waiting on your final pass to approve.. not sure what the issue is..seems like a tooling issue as dotnet add package ImageSharp  --source https://www.myget.org/F/imagesharp/api/v3/index.json  --version 1.0.0-alpha9-00148 works fine for me with an empty netcore 1.1 app console application. see NuGet/Home#5489 for resolution. Thanks for taking the time to improve our readme \ud83d\udc4d . You can use the standard sizeof(struct) operator to get the size of whichever pixel format you need.\ne.g. to find the size of the Rgba32 pixel struct you can just use var size = sizeof(Rgba32);.. That's right, the pixel format is always whatever the TPixel is in Image<TPixel> how the underlying file format stores the data is ignored outside the decoder, the decoders convert it to the correct TPixel type you asked for... At the moment there is no way to enable dithering on animated gif (just double checked in the source) \nI've added #262 to tack the feature.\nre:quality setting. That is a badly named setting for gif, what it actaully relates to is the palette size (which it'll soon be renamed to as part of encoder/decoder refactoring effort currently underway).. For simple vertical alignment just specify  textOptions.VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Center on the TextGraphicsOptions you passed into image.DrawText(..) it will vertically align for you. For what your trying to do (i.e. place text after a vertically aligned block of text) you will want to use use TextMeasure.Measure(text, new RendererOptions(font, 72)) (ImageSharp renders text at 72 dpi for font size calculations by default) to find out the the expected text size and use that to determine how to position things. \nThe option for feed back as part of rending will not be added, but you have better alternatives available to reproduce the effect your after.\n. No I don't think out based overlaod  that would be the best api for this.\nI was thinking it would actually require a significant API redesign to make it work intuitively.\nI was more thinking if we changed our api to be more like this:\n``c#\n// could easily be extension methods instead of instance methods\n// all they do in instantiate a newImageOperations` and\n// then call Apply/Build etc on it at before returning.\nclass IImage\n{\n    // applies the configured ImageOperations to the current image.\n    void Mutate(Action> action); \n// generates a new destination Image<TPixel> and then applies the \n// configured ImageOperations<TPixel> to that image. (trying to be \n// clever around things like resize to prevent unnecessary pixel coping)\nImage<TPixel> Generate(Action<ImageOperations<TPixel>> action);\n\n}\nthis would make operations look more like this:c#\nimage.Mutate(ctx => ctx.Resize(...).Rotate(...));  // returning void so chaining only happens inside Mutate\nimage.Save(...);\norc#\nusing(var image2 = image.Generate(ctx => ctx.Resize(...).Rotate(...))) \n{\n    image2.Save(...); // altered version\n}\nimage.Save(...); // orig image unalterd\n```\nImageOperations<TPixel> would cue up the operations and apply them all before Mutate/Generate returns but not immediately on calling the method. (this could allow us in a second/third pass to try and be smart about operation orders etc but initally it would pretty much work as today and apply them in sequence) .. your use case seems fine... that sort of scenario is is exactly why I've proposed the API change.. @antonfirsov c421e6d is basically what I was thinking with regards the fix for double cloning... none of those changes actually alter the public API... so it is possible without having to change IImageProcessor<> true it doesn't expose the ability to third party developers but that can be done an a version or 2 once other devs start wanting to make processors for it.. The major difference to IImageProcessor<T> is that it now takes an Image<T>  instead of an ImageBase<T> and now its responsible for making sure all the frames are processed too.. ah there are no changes directly to IImageProcessor<T> but we add a new interface (currently internal) ICloningImageProcessor<T> that we detect and use its CloneAndApply() (which takes in the source and returns the cloned image) method instead of  IImageProcessor<T>.Apply(). Basically its optional and if you want to opt in implement the other interface. Additionally we have a base class CloningImageProcessor that we could expose that would make it quite easy to implement a processor that always requires a fresh/scratch pixel area to run its process. \nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/pull/275/files#diff-515733e0588e848c4a58efcf630b0eef is an example of it being used for resizeing.. > Mutate() and Clone() look good on the surface but we also have the Apply (Formerly Run - I just changed the name) delegate. It feels like we've added a level of abstraction and misdirection that makes the code more difficult to follow + adds new overheads (heap allocation due to capturing of params). What benefit does it bring?\nBenefit is that its obvious to all consumers of image sharp about image operations being mutative and not confusing users into thinking that can dispose of the returned image and expect the original back (i've seen this confusion many times thus a huge red flag to me)\n\nadds new overheads (heap allocation due to capturing of params). What benefit does it bring?\n\nwe where capturing the params anyway, each IImageProcessor should have all the info it needs to alter an image in a specific way.\n\nI also find the processing context stuff confusing, calls like:\nsource.Configuration.ImageOperationsProvider.CreateImageProcessingContext are a red flag to me. Discovery of methods four levels deep is virtually nonexistent.\n\nthis method is only used internally and only exists for testing purposes, it allow us to actually unit test out extension method logic without the stupid overhead of trying to run the processor and guess if the settings looked with based on pixel data returning.\n\nThe internal interface IInternalImageProcessingContext and its default implementation are a flag also. What other implementations are we expecting? Does this abstraction need to happen?\n\nAgain these are interfaces etc for testing purposes , and allows us flexibility in the future if we need it.\n\nI'm struggling a little to recognize the codebase tbh, that could be the flu I have just now limiting me but it all feels more complicated than it should be.... and the more complicated it is, the slower it is and the slower we, and others can develop against it. One of my primary goals with this library was readability. I don't want to sacrifice that.\n\nThe process of developing new IImageProcessors hasn't changed... its just that they should really be standalone and not require any processing logic in the extension methods like we have at the moment (and the only reason I had to add Run()) which to a massive architectural/design red flag separating the logic across many file.\n. Those updates look good to me \ud83d\udc4d \nI like that we're showing both methods as its demonstrating that we aren't prescribing doing it one way or the other. . I could use this as the base branch for doing the package renames/namespace changes. That should cause less disruption on people who inadvertently update to latest as they would be having to to pull in a different package anyway. \nAlso means there is only one large braking change instead of 2.. obviously would still require a blog post but it would be a single one with API, package name in one.. its an out param overload on the standard Image.Load\nyou do it like this\nc#\nIImageFormat format;\nusing(var img = ImageSharp.Image.Load(image, out format)){\n  // .. do your thing\n}. We should just load it. I don't see the point of the AutoDetect if a user wants to ensure the loaded format is what they expected then they can just use the overload of Image.Load(...) that has the image format returned.. I've just taken a fresh look over the code and @antonfirsov was wrong we don't do any detection of file format based on the file extension as we always do format detection based on file headers, I'm guessing we actually have a bug in our bmp decoder (or we are too sensitive to technically corrupted images). Done some more investigation this BMP is using BITMAPV5HEADER DIB Header format. We  currently only support BITMAPCOREHEADER and BITMAPINFOHEADER formats.\nWhat we should be doing is always read the BITMAPCOREHEADER part (or the largest format we can read) as all others are just extensions on top of that format and just skip the remaining bytes so that at least we open the file.\nDetails gleamed from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format. missread that it should be BITMAPINFOHEADER. If the header size > 40 then just read as BITMAPINFOHEADER to get it to not fail. I'm not convinced we should... they are just internal helpers really not something  we should be exposing on our public API. If we expose it we have to support it and supporting clamping functions isn't what this library is for.. we would register them the same we we do with the encoders/decoders i.e. we would add Configuration.SetPixelTypeInfoProvider(ImageFormat format, IPixelTypeDetector detectorInstance). This defiantly feels like a bug... its will be happening because your source image will actually be using transparent green and when we save it the png we just blindly remove the transparancy.\nAs a work around if you use image.Background(Rgba32.White) before saving you should get the effect your after. However we should probably do an equivalent processing pass on all pixels with transparency whenever we save to a format that doesn't support transparency.. I'm in the process of fixing the build atm.\nDon't worry about releases.. I'm on it. The new rename branch will release stuff to a new package name and to a different feed.\nRe:Test Images put them in the https://github.com/SixLabors/TestImages repo and kill the branch that's already in there.\n. seems like it'll be easier to just delete that repo and create a new one, just go for that instead \ud83d\udc4d . @SixLabors/core I believe I have the changes in to let the build servers run.\nWe now have 2 issues one seems to be just broken stuff the other relatively major,\n\nThe simpler one, we have some broken tests  6 that fail in VS and a lot of ImageShouldApplyDiffusionFilterInBox test that don't seem to fail in VS but do fail for me locally on the command line.\nthe potentially major one, we have issues with the way we are using CoreCompat.System.Drawing for the travis build, it doesn't like some of the image types https://travis-ci.org/SixLabors/ImageSharp/builds/266268165#L2469. just added some API cleanup, cleaned up some namespaces, removed some stuff from the public API that's just no longer needed or was not being used.. There shouldn't be any extra CI stuff needed this branch has already been updated. What we can do is get it merged in get a version built it won't automatically create release build until we add a git tag/github release. \n\nWe can draft up the blogpost (we should probably start drafting that up now.) then once we are all happy with the post we upload to nuget.org + publish the post.. I vote we hide everything we currently have returning a Span internally for now but create the 2 new extension methods .GetPixelSpan() & .GetPixelRowSpan(int row) (this one is used extensively for creating processors) and put them into an ImageSharp.Unsafe namespace so you have to actively add the using statement. \nAdditionally we need to add .SavePixelData(streamByteArrayOrSpan) (to mimic Image.LoadPixelData() to save pixel data to a stream or byte array).\nI'll work this up now.. Done. Span<TPixel> has been removed to the easily accessible public API. \nTo access the pixel data you have to use the extension methods exposed in the SixLabors.ImageSharp.Advanced.Unsafe namespace (the reason it is Advanced.Unsafe is because the Unsafe namespace by itself was clashing with the Unsafe helper class in from the framework.)\nAlso I've added Image.SavePIxelData(Span<byte> buffer).. sounds reasonable to me, I'll drop the Unsafe part and just leave it as Advanced.. woops, fixing the build now. too accurate, got to laugh. We should probably add a flag to toggle compatiblity vs accuracy.. @ChristopherRobinSuperStar please direct questions to https://gitter.im/ImageSharp/General the issue tracker is for issues only.. I think it would be almost impossible at the moment to make that work for the current version... we would have to make a heap more of the internals public. \nI feel we should leave it sealed for v1, we can always relax things as people hit the limits of our current implementation, I feel moving over to an interface based version of the API would end up being the better choice than just unsealing Image.. sort of we would still need and Image<T>  to encode from so we could create a temp Image with just the one frame (which due to the fact we store all data in frames now be a relatively cheep operation) and then just encode that... would need to think about the best way though... would probably be better to have configuration on the encoders to let use specify which FrameIndex to treat as the source of data to encode (excluding gif of course). @SixLabors/core  so we happy enough now with this to merge into beta?. ok merging this.. we can continue any final tweeks on the beta branch. @mellinoe can you confirm that if we added this extension method to the public API it would unblock you? \nBasically if we can give you a ref to pixel 0,0 that will let you do the unsafe stuff you need to do to get to the pixel data you want?. @antonfirsov its not about fast pixel access its for getting ref pixel access\n. no idea... if you think its overkill then feel free to change it.. I was just trying to prevent us adding a new API then later having to add this version (that accesses any pixel) which could be used interchangeably for the older one which we'd now be stuck with.. @mellinoe thanks for that confirmation.\n@antonfirsov I've been mulling on this today and I think I've decided I agree with you and image.DangerousGetPinnableReferenceToPixelBuffer() is the way to go. for future me when i can't remember why i decided this \ud83d\ude00 \nWent for this name as it aligns with the name on Span<T> which we are ultimately calling.. @mellinoe fixed... thanks for the spot.. @antonfirsov yes we should, can you do me a favour and write the test for me please \ud83d\ude03. Your our resident expert on these things (can't get my head around how to convert the ref TPixel into something Unsafe.CopyBlock can use.) \nI have a feeling i'm going to feel pretty stupid after I see the test in seeing how obvious the answer is. @mellinoe I've pulled in your commit.. thanks for that your a star can I ask you to please sign our CLA?. AdvancedImageExtensions sounds fine to me.\nYou might as well make the change while your adding the TPixel[] methods.. It depends on how most people want the raw data.. I suspect most people will want the raw data as a byte[] so they can either save it or integrate with some other system that won't understand our pixel format but will usually support byte[]'s\n. I've never seen anyone asking for an array TPixel[] that's disconnected from the pixel buffer, but I have seen requests for a way to get the byte[]. closing this as I am moving the samples there their own repository. Thanks for that.\nFYI\nFor a short time it did live in this repo as a branch but we split it out prior to beta as it was more of a package that used the core imagesharp that a core piece by itself.. we could do with deleting the samples out of this repo.. the stream by that point can always be seeked. Thus in our current code path should always skip the correct amount.\nbut we should fix it incase we ever make changes that makes seeking not required.. updated name ExportFrame -> CloneFrame. this will enable scenarios where a user want to save and individual from from an animated gif\nAn example of the desired api would be \nc#\nfor(var i = 0; i<sourceimage.Frames.Count; i++){\n    using(var frameImage = sourceimage.CloneFrame(i) ){\n        frameImage.Save(\"path.here\");// we include all metadata from the original image;\n    }\n}\nor if we don't mind a destructive operation where the source image will be left empty of all but one frame.\nc#\n// skip last frame as it will throw removing the last frame\nfor(var i = 0; i<sourceimage.Frames.Count-1; i++){\n    using(var frameImage = sourceimage.ExtractFrame(i) ){\n        frameImage.Save(\"path.here\");// we include all metadata from the original image;\n    }\n}\nsourceimage.Save(\"lastFrame.path.here\");\nhttps://gitter.im/ImageSharp/General?at=59c0c18cc101bc4e3ae484be. @SixLabors/core \nshould we instead of calling the clone method CloneFrame instead add on overload to our current clone APIs that accept a frameIndex to clone from?\n\ud83d\udc4e  so instead of  : \nimage.Clone() => returns clone of image and all frames\nimage.CloneAs<TPixel2>() => returns clone of image and all frames and converts pixel type\nimage.CloneFrame(int frameIndex) => returns clone of image and a single frame\n\ud83d\udc4d  we should have \nimage.Clone() => returns clone of image and all frames\nimage.CloneAs<TPixel2>() => returns clone of image and all frames and converts pixel type\nimage.Clone(int frameIndex) => returns clone of image and a single frame\nimage.CloneAs<TPixel2>(int frameIndex) => returns clone of image and a single frame and converts pixel type\nif we're going with Clone(...) instead of CloneFrame(...) we should probably name the other method Extract(...). To just remove a frame you can currently just call image.Frames.RemoveAt(index) \nThe reason to have an extract call as well is to prevent unwanted pixel buffers being created.. basically calling extract should be significantly faster that clone frame because it doesn't need to create a second buffer and copy all the pixel data over to it.. now I think about it we could do with rethinking the whole API around imageframes. At the moment it's very easy to remove frames and it not be obvious that you need to dispose of them. we also have a second issue where it's difficult to mutate individual frames thus making it difficult to interact with them that way.. because that's what extract means? to extract something from something else is to pluck/take/remove it.\nWhat I'm currently thinking is we rework the the api surface of ImageFrameCollection into this:\n|Member|Return Type| Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|CloneFrame(int index)| Image<TPixel>|creates an image with a copy of the pixel data from that frame on it|\n|RemoveFrame(int index)| Image<TPixel>| creates an image with only the indexed frame on it and removes that frame from the original image.|\n|DeleteFrame(int index)|void| just removes the frame for the collection and disposes of the pixel data without returning anything|\n|AddFrame(ImageFrame<T> source)  |ImageFrame<T>| clones the new frame and adds it the the collection. (returns ImageFrame)|AddFrame(TPixel[] data)|ImageFrame| creates a new frame from the raw pixel data and adds it the the collection.|\n|InsertFrame(ImageFrame source, int index)|ImageFrame| clones the new frame and adds it the the collection.|\n|this[int index] {get;}|ImageFrame| get just returns frame at index|\n|MoveFrame(int sourceIndex, int destIndex)|void| moves a frame from sourceindex so that after the operation it ends up at destIndex|\n|IndexOf(ImageFrame needle)|int| find the index of a frame|\n|Contains(ImageFrame needle)|'bool| as it looks, does the frame existing in the collection|\n|Count {get;} | intframe count|\n|RootFrame {get;} | ImageFrame<T> |returns the frame at index 0 this is the frame used for pixel operations performed directly on Image<t>|\nThis ensures that ImageFrames can never be disconnected from an Image<T> if you try and disconnect on then you will end up with a clone of the original image with only that frame on it, thus we can remove IDisposable from ImageFrames and make it obvious that you should only be disposing on Image and you can't easily corrupt an Image<T>s internal state\nMy reasoning for having this API on ImageFrameCollection instead of Image<T> is so that it hides away the frame based APIs into a property on the image for all those people who couldn't care less about frames and want to process the image as a simple single frames picture, they won't see any of this APIs cluttering up intellisense except the root Frames property itself.. The reason I think we want to remove IDisposable is to prevent users disposing of the frame or the collection without disposing of the image basically the lifetime of the pixel data withing the frames should be controlled by the lifetime of the image not when someone sees Dispose() on the collection and tries to Dispose of it early.. looking fine.. as it was just a simple change decided to merge.. This is fine... what I should have done done in the original Pr. awesome \ud83d\udc4d \nwell done for figuring this out.. @caetanator Thanks a lot for your PR \ud83d\udc4d.\nPlease can you merge/rebase against master with your changes because at the moment the your changes wont merge and I'm seeing a lot of changes that seem to be unrelated to the BMP changes (probably because of the merge issues.)\nOnce we have a mergable PR that can be built by our CI server we'll be able to do a proper view of the changes.. @caetanator make sure you build in release mode as we have warnings as errors turned on during release builds.. @prw56 its not a case if it being incorrect to alias a namespaces its just not going to work (easily) for you due to the way we designed our APIs.\nOur API is build around extension methods, explicitly so that it can be easily expanded upon by third party developers in a first class manor, but as extension methods are only available (as extensions) if you have the correct using statement included in context (and not only as aliased namespaces) then to use the API as we have designed it requires you to add using SixLabors.ImageSharp.\nIf for some reason you really can't/wont add a full (non-aliasing) using statement then you will have to leverage the static classes directly.\nfor example the following 2 items are extactly the same minus the use or extension methods or not.\nwithout using statement\nc#\nImageExtensions.Mutate(img, ctx=>{\n   var nextCtx = ImageExtensions.GuassianBlur(ctx, ...);\n   nextCtx = ImageExtensions.Operation2(nextCtx, ...);\n   nextCtx = ImageExtensions.Operation3(nextCtx, ...);\n});\nwith using statement\nc#\nimg.Mutate(ctx=>ctx.GuassianBlur(...)\n                                .Operation2(...)\n                               .Operation3(...));\nas you can see using it as we designed it is much more readable and maintainable. . Also closing this as its not actually an issue with ImageSharp but a side effect of how extension methods are handled in c# as a language.. I feel we should be doing this by default when encoding into formats that don't support alpha channels.\nI think we should add a NormalizeBackground property onto JpegEncoder  that, if enabled (defaulted to true), will do the background color fixes as it encodes each pixel.. hmm.. not sure about those tests, at the very least they seem really heavy (loading in real images instead of makes a couple of calculated/patterned ones). I'll have to take a closer look this evening.. We don't currently have any plans but if someone was to send in a pull request we probably wouldn't turn it down.. Actually, after having done some research on this format, I doubt we would ever add support for this to the core ImageSharp product. \nThe reason being is that the codec that HEIC uses (HEVC) is covered by patents that would require licensing thus we probably wouldn't be able to ship this as a core software component. Me might be able to be work something out to be able to provided as an add-on package but that would depend on how the licencing for the codec would work out.. moved to SixLabors/Fonts#47 as this is a bug/issue with the layout engine built into SixLabors.Fonts. thanks for reporting this, I've 'moved' this over to the other repository as its specifically an issue in that component.. @naveedahmed1 as linked from our readme our samples repository has 2 different examples of drawing text on images. The Draw watermark on image and Draw text along a path both do this.. @naveedahmed1 make sure you have a dependency on SixLabors.ImageSharp.Drawing this is the package that enables drawing onto images.. this should have been posted at \nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp.Web/issues as ImageSharp.Web has its own repositroy.\nFYI we have already fixed this in source and will be resolved when we push out a beta2.. you want to access the raw byte array from the UIImage directly instead of converting back and fourth in jpeg format. \nThis looks like some sample code that can help you access image data https://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/comment/60985/#Comment_60985\ndisclaimer: not been tested, not an IOS developer.\nThen as @antonfirsov suggests call var img = Image.LoadPixelData<Rgba32>(rawData, width, height); \nThat will prevent new overhead of any encoding/decoding and will be the fastest way of gettign data from UIImage->Image\n. Moving over the resize to the same code path seems sensible to me. We reduce moving parts for initial release and then we can always fork the resize operation back out later again later if we feel its a place we want to apply any potential optimisations.. @777olexandr \nThe easiest way to configure the default encoder options  is to do it like this:\nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/Samples/blob/d8959156c24b671be13cd345ac50d3dbe967dd7d/ImageSharp/ChangeDefaultEncoderOptions/Program.cs#L14-L20\nThat way you shouldn't need to fight with creating a custom configuration and will be the version thats automatically used when using the named formats.\n@JimBobSquarePants we shouldn't be encouraging users to have to cast encoders from config and instead be telling them to replace the encoder with one configured to their liking, that's exactly what the  SetEncoder api is for.. My first attempt was to try older version of gitversion but It didn't seem to make a difference and after careful looking at gitversion diagnostic output the counter reset seemed correct it just not the effect we wanted.. it was copious amounts of altering local environment variables... and hoping that it ends up working \ud83d\ude09 . seeing as chrome doesn't seem to even seem to render it then i'm inclined to think we should defiantly push it past v1 and even then see how much of an issue its causing in the future and make a another call then.. Your not using our package.. you are using a package some third-party uploaded without our permission. Make sure your using the SixLabors.ImageSharp package.. Nope that is not the office package like I said the official package is SixLabors.ImageSharp https://www.nuget.org/packages/SixLabors.ImageSharp your need to make sure you tick the Include preview checkbox as we are still in beta at the moment thus have yet to produce a fist full release.\nThe one you have found is a package a third-party unofficially released without our consent without the pre-release tag causing confusion for many people. We have tried without much success to have it de-listed. . The DrawText command currently always draws at 72 dpi ignoring the images configured dpi so that it will consistently produce a well know pixel height based for a specific point size, as this produces a more consistent output for most users.\nIf you want to measure the text for drawing always use 72 when measuring or just skip the dpi as it will default to 72dpi when omitted.. It's because the commit has an email address against it that hasn't been linked  to a github user account.. Our blend providers currently support single pixel operations.. The API to access the pixel blenders currently is: \nc#\nPixelBlender<TPixel> blender = PixelOperations<TPixel>.Instance.GetPixelBlender(PixelBlenderMode.Default); \nTPixel background = ...;\nTPixel source= ...;\nfloat blendAmount= 1; // value from 0 - 1 for opacity like effects (depending on blender)\nTPixel blendedPixel = blender.Blend(background, source, blendAmount);\nWe would need to expose PixelOperations<TPixel>.GetPixelBlender() as a public API + make make at least part of the PixelBlender<TPixel> class public too,. Only thing that could be effected in drawing is the ImageBrush and that already tiles the fill image.. no don't think we would need to/should support that scenario. It would be trivial to just draw the shape yourself with applying a transform the make it offset to each side.. We need to make sure we are fully compliant with the css compositing spec https://www.w3.org/TR/compositing-1/. No its anywhere using the pixel blenders... but its most noticeable in that method as we are doing whole buffer effects.\nAlso don't think its all of the effects just a couple of them but I need to investigate some more to figure out the full scope of the issue. . I agree IImage sounds fine to me \ud83d\udc4d Also yes I agree that we should probably not expose the per pixel access directly on an interface.. I concur I have no problem installing ImageSharp in a new 4.7.1 project in either csproj based PackageReference or the older packages.config style of reference. \nLike @antonfirsov I also can't get the project to run.. even after running the bootstrap.bat and even trying to build all the projected individually. . I'm closing this as 'can't reproduce'. If you believe this is closed in error please provide a simpler solution/project that reproduces the error.. @copernicus365 then like I said in my reason for closure, instead of ranting unhelpfully, please provide a verifiable reproduction of the original issue and I would be happy to reopen the ticket. But note this will stay closed as 'Can reproduce' until the development team (who have made this library in our free time, and thus have no obligation to fix any issues raised at all) can reproduce the problem (and thus can try and fix it).\nIf on the other hand you are complaining about the way .Net Standard targeted libraries are installed into full framework projects then that's an issue with nuget/dotnet as a framework and not an issue with a single library, then I suggest you raise your concerns with Microsoft instead of an independent dev team who have no control over these things.. Thank you for taking the effort and time to make these changes but I'm afraid we are not interested it taking them at this time... In future, to save yourself effort on changes that we don't intend to take, please make sure you get buy-in from a the core development team before trying to make sweeping changes of this manor. . Please note the issue tracker is for reporting issues only, not for general questions. If you had read our contribution guidelines (linked from the 'new issue' screen) or attempted to fill out our issue template then you would have noticed that. In future please direct questions like this to our gitter channel. \nFor brevity the API you are looking for is ColorBuilder<TPixel>.FromHex(string hex) (it supports hex strings but not color names). Getting 403 Forbidden here. My guess is you have some form of IP address filtering on them.. I'm even getting it when just navigating to http://justintubbs.com/. The cloning is necessary in DrawImage otherwise we don't have the source pixels being the correct size for the drawing operation. Only way to remove the clone from that operation is to remove the ability to specify the destination size and draw the image at source dimension size.. It will be an issue inside SixLabors.Fonts if its anywhere.\nThis method is the layout engine bit that decides exactly where text is placed.. https://github.com/SixLabors/Fonts/blob/master/src/SixLabors.Fonts/TextLayout.cs#L27\nThing to note about this is I'm pretty sure its setup to render glyphs in relation to their internal default line height not the actual vectors used to draw the glyph (basically layout relies on the metadata about the glyphs in the font not the actual vectors themselves.). @vpenades the test project injects a fake test image format that allows us to test the global default configuration object\nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/blob/47a8533b7d7b43b490d4958d2702490a580d9d34/tests/ImageSharp.Tests/TestFormat.cs#L19. sorry, i'm actually in work still at the moment i'll try to do a full review this evening.. It feels like it would make more sense to put the ReadOrigin onto the Configuration object instead of just passing it into all the places we use streams, thus it can be globally opted into.. if the stream is non-seekable we are already copying it internally into a memory stream then reading it from the beginning... re the original issue is we must be detecting it as seekable thus not doing the internal copy and thus failing to reset it between attempts to detect image format.. please direct questions to our gitter channel as it says in our readme. You seem to keep describing what your seeing not what the problem is.. basically we need to know why a 1mb file is wrong. \nAs far as I can see you are taking an image, resizing it so that it 4 times less the number of pixels and are confused about the fact you are getting an image out that's 4 times smaller, personally that's an outcome I would be hoping for.. All that means is you have likely used a better/higher compression ratio than the original source image. Unless the output actually looks wrong to a human eye then it's doing exactly the right thing.. Then well done you have successfully used imagesharp, and we have saved you alot of space. Your welcome.\nThat's exactly the output imagesharp is trying to accomplish.. @cemalpolat what we are trying to tell you is there is no issue... the library is working as designed you feed it an image (that may or may not have been previously saved in a optimised fashion) you then save it and we do all the optermisation on the image we can to reduce file size (thus we actually reduce the size significantly), unless there is actual issue with the visual output of the image then we have done our jobs very well and there is no issue/bug.\nAs we are getting no where repeating the fact that saving a file and reducing the size with out effecting the visual quality is a good thing i'm locking this thread.. yeah, looks like its going to be the exact same root issues.. This is not a bug with the image brush and is working the way i designed it to.\nImageBrush was written to be used to fill a region with a repeating texture not as a way to crop out parts of a larger image. . Please explain why that image is wrong. Just because something is unexpected for you doesn't mean its wrong.. this looks like its probably related to #504. do we need both the scaled and non-scaled vector4 options? can't we just ensure that the current vector4 APIs always expect a scaled vector?. I think its right as it is. I would expect after calling image.Frames.MoveFrame(2, 4) to then be able to take a reference to that frame by calling image.Frames[4]. Basically the Api should do as I've told it make sure what ever is currently in frame position 2 make sure its in frame position 4. This works consistently then no mater weather the source frame is before or after to target location after the operation is complete is should be in the index I said and in a different one.. I've renamed the PR, we will happily keep reviewing it as you make improvements, once your fully happy and want a final review/merge just update the title again and drop the [WIP] prefix. you will find its nigh on impossible to apply the same sort of fast path logic to the region filling, as we need to take into account anti-aliasing at region edges which in turn requires applying pixel blending.. Looks like its routed in being a bug in SixLabors.Shapes where particularly large composite shapes start dropping intersection points and as it scans from left to right the errors compound across multiple scans. Raised an issue over on the shapes repo to track any investigation etc we need to do on that side.\n@AtwindYu in the mean time could you please try adding/using this package https://www.myget.org/feed/sixlabors/package/nuget/SixLabors.Shapes/1.0.0-ci0018 from our myget feed and see if that solves it for you.. I have a feeling that it could related to other issues we have seen around Vector2 being retained as properties. The version of the Shapes package I've pointed to has just had them all removed.. this will need completing in SixLabors/Font before we can support it in ImageSharp\nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/Fonts/issues/66. @JimBobSquarePants don't worry about it, it is internal.. We probably shouldn't be using Math.Round() here without specifying a MidpointRounding setting. We should probably be using MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero (not the .net default) as that is way more intuitive to most users and less likely to cause issues in the future.. yes I think your right, that does sound like its probably the better fix.. I can't see anything I'm not happy with now. \ud83d\udc4d . That method doesn't call ShapeRegion at all. ShapeRegion will only be called if you pass in a Path to fill and that uses a different processor under the hood. @antonfirsov i'm pretty sure (from a gitter chat) it was a call to draw text that was the the reason for the scan calls, but they will soon be greatly reduced by the work in #614. . when outlining large numbers of characters we now even beat system.drawing \ud83d\ude03 . I've dropped the Draw text along a path code as its not really that big, I am not 100% confident that its drawing the text in quite the expected location and in reality it is something that a small tutorial/article would be enough to cover and not something a whole dedicated processor is required for.. Hi @ststeiger thanks for the suggestion but this is not something we have any plans on doing.\nWe don't don't want the extra maintenance involved in this as its not a code sharing scenario we would ever recommend and instead recommend consuming our project via nuget. (thus no having any problems with convoluted solutions at all). If you are trying to do it to produce a single exe output there are other methods to do this, IL merge, etc.. @antonfirsov @JimBobSquarePants @dlemstra do you guys agree?. You want to look at output file size too otherwise it's not a fair comparison.. there is every possibility that the reference images are wrong... we should probably produce a bit of a crib sheet output with a set of svg's side by side with our equivalent output and manually compare until we are happy with the final output... once we are then we can update our reference images.. To be brutally honest and explain the reason I see you getting little support on this PR will be caused by the fact that this particular issue hasn't really got anyone on the core team championing it and thus none of us has much incentive to actually help push it thru to completion.\nFor me personally (i can't speek or the rest on this) for v1 I was perfectly happy with the working solution we had, thus all I see here is something distracting us for pushing out v1 as we potentially break more APIs.. That's not to say we won't try and look over it and aid where we can just that we're aren't likely to prioritise this over getting releases out.. Questions should be directed to our gitter channel.\nBut to answer your question, No we don't support vide0 formats at all, the only file formats we support are JPEG, Png, Gif, and Bmp. . also please ensure you do actually search issues because this same issue with System.Memory version miss matching has come up a few times now and the answer was to make sure your on the latest beta version where its already been resolved.. you can just update the previous commits and fix the author email address and do a force push to get the changes back up\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/3042437/how-to-change-the-commit-author-for-one-specific-commit. make sure your searching with \"Include prerelease\" checked as we are still in beta and have yet to release our first version.\n. the re-arranged arguments look good to me.. https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/blob/master/tests/CodeCoverage/CodeCoverage.cmd needs updating too to run against 2.1 instead of 2.0. @JimBobSquarePants .ico files seem to be more of a container format not a codec in its own right... i would put it in the same category as tiff where it can have many separate image streams each with different sizes (thus not fitting in with our frames context) and each image stream can even be in different codecs (i.e. png and bmp encoded images).\nIts something we should think about trying to find away of tackling at some point multi-image (not just multi-frame) containers.. the main reason in my head why they need to be the same dimensions if due to resize operations... if you call resize on a multi frame images what is the expected outcome?... right now all frame are resized to the size provided and that works logically when all frames are the same source size so everything scales uniformly.. can you confirm you are still experiencing this issue in the nightlies on our myget feed? https://www.myget.org/gallery/sixlabors . @j0rn thanks for the fix \ud83d\udc4d . @antonfirsov feel free to tweek the tolerances... I never get the level them right.\nThe reason I made the tolerances exact was because the sample FontShapesAreRenderedCorrectly_LargeText.png did show the issue (its just more prominent with the other font)... 'tis why I needed to update the reference image too now I had resolved the problem.. Differences are fine and expected... It's differences that effect the visual baseline that are the problem... Which is something that is nigh on impossible to quantify and test for.. That's strange because with a 2 it wasn't wandering on my machine... Odd  yeah 8 is fine then... I believe it's going to be one of those tweek the settings as/if people complain that it's still happening.. please ensure you are using the correct nuget feed. \nhttps://www.myget.org/F/sixlabors/api/v3/index.json. We have will end up needing to have both options for RectangleF.\nIf we have anti-aliasing turned on we would have to use the FillRegionProcessor no matter what. With it turned off however we would be able to round all the points of the RectangleF into a Rectangle and then use the faster FillProcessor for that processes.. They are disposed \nhttps://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/pull/37/files#diff-51290ecbe2b99dd904013148fc22e4f4R66\nhere\nhttps://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/pull/37/files#diff-755b67a7f6c80ae11495b9d27b4d5935R76\nhere \nhttps://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/pull/37/files#diff-94dfa090254876c958b23d72f7c0d460R193\nand \nhttps://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/pull/37/files#diff-94dfa090254876c958b23d72f7c0d460R246\n. Nothing in this method is IDisposable\nThere are only 2 Interfaces which are IDisposable thats IBrushApplicator which is generated during processing and is disposed of by the Processors or Pen applicators or IPenApplicator which again is disposed by the processors.. yep.. couple of loops and a List<Vector2> should do it.. these only happen at Contructor time and thus a one time hit, I think I had envisioned Shapes and this Paths and LineSegments being relatively long lived items and you wouldn't new a new one up each time if you wanted to apply it to many things, as the overhead required on things like the ComplexPolygon would be very high if newing them up all the time.. no problem, i'll convert it to a simple loop.. I couldn't even compile without it when I first started looking at ImageSharp... I'll see if it's still needed.. basically there are using statements in the 3 new XProcessor classes and in the Pen applicators in Pen.cs. no problem, i'll drop the usage of them. see ImageBrush that alone means they need to be disposable. ok tried again, defiantly is needed.\nI have 1.0.0-rc2-002392 installed as well as 1.0.0-preview2-003121 and if you don't specify the sdk then it will auto roll forward to the latest one and there seems to be issues compiling against the RC2 sdk, lots of complaints about the unsafe code requiring a compile flag.. no problem, I figured actually just adding something that needed it would be the best explanation  \ud83d\ude04 . my bad forgot to drop it back out after debugging something.. My logic with the interface was I explicitly didn't want the brush to have write access to the pixels, the only other way I can think to do it would be with a very thin struct wrapper around PixelAccessor with aggressive inlining hints.. where are bytesA and bytesB being compared?. no problem.. can't this just be return this.backingVector.GetHashCode() directly and drop the GetHashCode(...) method? I don't think the indirection is needed.. might be worth deferring to @JimBobSquarePants to see if there specific logic to it then.. I would be inclined to make this internal can't see why we would want to expose as part of the public API.\n. the Bootstrapper need passing along with the PixelAccessor we should only rely on Bootstrapper.Default in the Image constructor everywhere else should be explicitly passed.. do we want a version that doesn't force having a height/width set?. do we want a version that doesn't force having a height/width set?. This shouldn't be lazy, Bootstapper isn't expensive to construct, and we are more likely than not going to want it than not... looks like all the Quantizers will probably need tweeking to pass along the bootstrapper, the IQuantizer<TColor>.Quantize(..) method looks like the best place to me, and then proxied on to the QuantizedImage constructor.. ah ok, that's fine then.. you would have a .RegisterXXXFormat() in each format project, and we could create a combined project that has a dependency on all our core formats that has a single .RegisterCoreFormats() extension method.. if you really want/need the lazy you are removing the effect here, by immediately invoking the value... just drop the Lazy part and new it up directly here. . ok...that fine then, all go to go then for me.. I'm happy with going another way with this, figured I would chuck it in and it could then be used as a bouncing off point tom do the rest... \ud83d\udc4d for only looking for core modules, we won't have the issue with loading everything up then and we wouldn't even need to scan the assembly for implementations of an interface as we should know exactly which classes in which assemblies we want.. I found it made it easier to add to the solution, and play better with VS.. totally agree, I think all the project files will defiantly need a sanity pass.. This means that branches and PRs wont ever produce version numbers that match master ones, if you allow branches to be able to produce packages that could also be produced by master you might end up with 2 different builds producing the same version number and causing accidental confusion if anyone finds/uses the wrong file.. yeah my bad, that shouldn't be public, I had an attempt to make it compile that needed it, must have forgot to change it back.. it got populated by the build project after it discovered all the things to build... i've figured out a cleaner way for it to do it so this can now be dropped. scratch that I was wrong globing doesn't seem to work with the pack command... the empty file can be dropped but the build project will generate a pack command for each project it discovered in the src folder.. added a description in the file to help describe how versioning.. done... I'm sure It had some logic when I moved them... can't remember what it was now \ud83d\ude15 . the buffer is used in parallel... it needs to be rented inside the parallel loop otherwise multiple threads will be competing over the same buffer.. I tried a version with a PopulateRow(..) style interface it slowed it down filling SolidBrushes in the simple benchmarks I tried... I didn't look too hard at it as I figured that could be a follow up to properly investigate the issue.. yes, the default is to anti-alias . yeah my bad, i'm trying to catch myself using var but I do miss them.\nWe should think about trying to find an analyzer that can catch them.. it was from a rebase, the conflict tool i was using failed me and added tabs instead of spaces \ud83d\ude22 . If they want to do complex paths featuring both linear & bezier segments they will do... the shapes library does have a shape builder class that can be used to declarativly draw complex combinations of paths and shapes which I imagine would end up being the preferred way of creating large complex shapes that they can then cache and redraw many times.. I was being lazy, it isn't needed at all and has been dropped. your right, dropped. yeah the shapes library supplies the real world intersections logic the abstract classes Region & Drawable(was Path) ImageShape.Drawing are there as proxies to allow SixLabors.Shapes. not anymore I've renamed the abstract class to Drawable from Path. can't as the PointInfo we are converting to is inside ImageSharp.Drawing the one we are converting from is SixLabors.Shapes and the only project that knows about both sides is  ImageSharp.Drawing.Paths. IPath & IShape are interfaces from SixLabors.Shapes that's why we also have Region & Drawable(formally Path) which are what IPath & and Shape are wrapped into before filling/drawing happens. you could... it would make more sense to contribute an ellipse shape to SixLabors.Shapes \ud83d\ude09  and then write some glue mappings in the same way I do rectangles.. You also could just create an EllipseRegion and/or an EllipseDrawable instead, it just wouldn't integrate directly with the shapes from SixLabors.Shapes.. I still think I prefer feature based directives rather than platform based ones, but saying that I would be willing to accept NETSTANDARDX_X based ones to.\nI originally went with the positive HAS_FILE_IO on all targets except the 1.1. target but I changed my mind last minute.. didn't we decide 2D arrays where frowned upon?. you can now save yourself the filestream stuff in the tests and just call.\nc#\nimage.Save($\"{path}/{file.FileNameWithoutExtension}.bmp\");\nit'll use the correct format for you, and reduce boilerplate in the tests.. save yourself the extra memory stream and just new up the image with the bytes directly.\nyou can also then save directly with the path reducing this down to this.\n``` c#\nusing(Image image2 = new Image(serialized))\n{\n    image2.Save($\"{path}/{file.FileName}\");\n}\n````. It targets netcoreapp1.1 which is actually netstandard 1.6 compatible.. ok I think I've figured out how to fix the intellisense in VS.\n\nclose VS\ndelete .vs folder\nrun dotnet restore in the root repo folder\nrestart VS \n\nYou should now see the file path based APIs, it looks like VS is caching the reference to the netstandard1.1 output instead of moving to the netstandard1.3 one it should now be using.. shouldn't these be reading a static instance of BulkPixelOperations<T> ? otherwise it'll be really easy to allocate multiple instances from a public API.\nThe way I see it is it should be more like this\n``` c#\nprivate static readony BulkPixelOperations PrivateBulkOperations = new BulkPixelOperations();\npublic BulkPixelOperations BulkOperations => PrivateBulkOperations;\n```\nThat way we still get to use the hack to allow for swapping out to more efficiant versions but we wont accidentally allocate a new BulkPixelOperations<T> every time you allocate the property on this or any other instance of the struct.\nThis obviously applies to all TColors. As we are are newing something up, maybe make the Interface a method named CreateBulkOperations() instead of a property, makes people realise that it has something they shouldn't just dot into to use.\nAnd the comment pointing people the the preferred accessor would also help.. The logic was that there was nothing stopping you passing a PixelAcessor that was created by calling  Lock on an array and you shouldn't be able to switch out the backing buffer from the accessor and the image then as one wouldn't have originated from the array pool thus it shouldn't later be returned to it.. I did it to make the class only exposes the Paths property by default as there is no code inside ImageSharp that should ever call those methods (the only thing that should call them is something deep inside SixLabors.Fonts).\nI can make them public implicit implementations if you prefer (can't make them private as they are interface methods after all).. Why is it better to use Marshal.Copy() over that size? why wouldn't you use it less that that?\nHow was this number decided?. why do we need arrays defaulted to default(T) at all? Do we have logic that is dependent on the data being default? if we do how many places? could we not just reset them ourselves if required and save the added complexity of having more than one data pool? \nMy guess is this is for the empty buffer for new Image(height, width) could we not just add a simple T[].Clear() extension method, or RentClean(int minimumLength) method that can be called to set the default value if required. I feel creating a new images is probably going to happen less than opening an existing file which shouldn't need a clear array anyway as it will be setting all the pixels itself.. \ud83d\udc4d . Its the width of the scanline data not the size of the buffer, the buffer should always be >= offset + scanlineWidth, I've added a debug guard to help demonstrate this fact.. Entirely subjectively it was the point I felt that that the image quality at the size feature I was testing at didn't seem to degrade any.\nYou'll all so notice the Text has a different default to general shapes, the reason for this is the glyphs will most likely be rendered at smaller sizes that general shapes and they will have more finer detail what needs preserving.. yeah glad you spotted that there was a bug i'd missed.. but all fixed now and covered. ~what do you mean?~. oh right the other PR yeah i know...which ever one is merged first i'll fix the other one before the merge\n. I've added some comments to the methods.. not sure why I did that. \ud83d\ude15 . theses have been removed. done. done. It felt the best from the public api point of view (felt it ended up being the most discoverable via intellisense).. not really just started adding stuff till it started working correctly.. You can just drop this entire file. You can access the same data from NamedColors<TColor>.ColorName . Ah ok,  that's fine then.. why not just do this in a constructor? or even better make the whole thing a static class.. can this not just be a static class? with a static constructor for the stuff in Init()?. The single pixel operations are actually on the PixelBlender<TPixel> classes themselves. All the ones I've noticed only do the TPixel > Vector4 for the final bit of blending which we can make simpler by just passing the BufferSpan<TPixel> directly instead.. totally agree having Vector4 versions just makes sense.. I was keeping the old code around while I was rewriting things and forgot to remove. Being removed. It can be, I forgot to put  Parallel.For() back in after testing. nope.. and done. nope removed, no longer needed they where left over for an earlier pass. awesome, i'll leave that one to you \ud83d\ude09 \nI've come across https://github.com/daveaglick/Scripty  as an alternative to T4 before now.. actually if we're adding some generation in I'll leave off trying to find an efficient way to wire in the composition modes on top the blending. At the moment this code is doing the equivalent of 'Over' compositing. But with code generation it will be trivial to expand out the modes to include all the other ones.. Vector4BlendTransforms is now gone and everything uses the PixelBlenders and thus GraphicOptions to set them.. we can get rid of these now, now we don't have to do the if (typeof(TPixel) == typeof(Rgba32)) thing, and just call the constructor directly from the IImageDecoders. why can't destBytes be a span? can't ToXyzBytes just be updated to take in a Span<byte> too?\nthis also applies to the other similar methods too. A span inherently has a start index tho(ie the start of the span) just pass in a new span that's been offset correctly from the source one... Or is there some perf issues here I can't see?.. but yes we can easily defer that to a later change.. Love it to. love how it removes any chance of index bound checking, and array allocations.. its supposed to be the first variant... i'll try to improve comments, and switch out the span copy.. Not convinced these should implicitly (or even explicitly) convert to/from Vector4 is this conversion used anywhere? \nThe main reason is its not certain what will be mapped where, should a vector represent x,y,width,height or should it represent x,y,right,left because it ambiguous I would drop it, we can add some extension methods if there's anything that needs this.. Doh... Your right of course, I'll fix it in the morning.. figured I would just use the array version for now and worry about other overloads later, once real buffers land. we don't need count here source is a Span of known length, we should just push all source values into the dest.... if you want to copy less then the actually source data you should call source.Slice(0, amountToCopy) and pass that in, but I suspect that all places call this currently called the source's Span is already the correct length.. That's fine then, keeping the suite of APIs consistent with each other is a perfectly agreeable reason \ud83d\udc4d  . I disagree (obviously \ud83d\ude09 ) My logic for having lot of individual projects is for the fact they are supposed to be self contained demonstrations on how a user could implement such a thing... if they are all bundled into a larger single project then 1 its harder to see what the dependencies are, and 2 it becomes tempting to share code across the samples which, in my opinion, shouldn't happen so as to make it simpler to follow (preferably without even having to download from github) but If people feel strongly enough I'll to change it.. Yeah.. I believe this covers all the standard composition/blending types. We can worry about making it pluggable later.. woops that whole file/project shouldn't be in here will be removed.. probably not, probably wasn't thinking to much about it... that can be addressed on the Shapes repo.. yeah your right... i'll move it over to using Buffer<>. I disagree it should be fully public and discoverable otherwise you can't do :\nc#\nConfiguration.Default.SetMimeTypeEncoder(\"image/jpeg\", new JpegEncoder()\n{\n    Quality = 90,\n    IgnoreMetadata = true\n});\n. Its not used anywhere (as I removed the usage of the metadata quality from the encoders).\nThe reason i removed using it tn the encoders was that it causes issues when switching formats, if you decoded a jpeg its 'quality' could be 70, but then encoding a gif would have caused a palette size of 70 which is drastically different. So now you have to be explicit but manually setting it on the encoders.. yeah I'll drop this change out... and add a ticket\n. I've decided to leave them for a time being, doesn't make a huge difference either way and at least the current way its obvious where the static data relating to a format is.. Left it separate for now, its safer in case we want to switch out the encoder to be different based on format. I favour having the formats as isolated from each other as we can. Less chance on causing cross encoder bugs during fixes then.. Question : should theses be extension methods or exposed instance methods of Image<TPixel>?\nThe more I think about it I feel these should actually be moved onto Image directly thus exposing this APIs without needing to add the using statements.. Bounds() should be an extension method I feel, as its only really used as a helper for image operations. (in fact it should probably just be internal)\nWe should also probably move out all all the overloads of Save() into extension methods too Image would just have Save(Stream, Encoder).\nAlso things like To<TPixel2>() could also probably be a candidate for changing. \nAnd now the ApplyProcessor() is basically redundant.. The internal parts of the should be refactorable to make it possible to prevent the double allocation.. I was planning to create a new internal interface ICloneableImageProcessor<T> : IImageProcessor<TPixel> (or similare ) then in the DefaultImageOperator check if the passed in IImageProcessor is in fact an ICloneableImageProcessor and if it is then instead of calling IImageProcessor.Apply() then it instead call IImageProcessor.CloneAndApply() which returns the cloned image. All it would require is the DefaultImageOperator cloning the source image lazerly the first time we encounter an IImageProcesssor and its not an ICloneableImageProcessor and if it is on then it will retain the cloned image and just call Apply with it on all remaining IImageProcesssor. feel free to have a go... basically my ideal situation (for v1) is to do it without having to change the public API any, even if that means that only our internal processors have to extra power of generating the clone.. there is no duplication really, they both follow the same patterns but the code is different, one takes 2 images the other takes 1. Basically CloneingImageProcessor is for image processors that require a 2nd buffer to apply changes to before overwriting the pixel data in the original. ImageProcessor if for processors that don't require the 2nd buffer and can apply there changes directly to the source.. yep i was, must have missed it. I like IImageProcessingContext . I personally preferred Run() over apply but eather way. \nBasically its an escape hatch for developers to be able to access the correctly cloned/mutated image without having to go though the rigmarole of writing an entire IImageProcessor. . CurrentImage is exactly what we shouldn't have, adding that would prevent us easily being able to do optimizations around rolling up similar processors etc into single set of pixel operations or even things like detecting that some operations will have no effect on the final image thus can be skipped (eg after a user applies a lot of operations then calls Fill() with a solid color thus we could skip all the previous operations and just call fill as it'll fully set every pixel anyway.)\nOr for rolling up we could have multiple calls to draw text we would be able to roll all the calls into a single operation that only renders the glyphs as a single pass instead of multiple operations.. Thats why I called it Run  instead of Apply... As to me it invokes the though of run this action against the image. Also helps differentiate itself from applying IImageProcessors . They where showing up in my test explorer... just checked they seem to still be running on the build server. wouldn't theses be better as const values instead of readonly static ones?. yes you can have zero frames, it will have zero when the ImageFrameCollection as been disposed.. if its immutable then you can't create an animated gif.. also the public api doesn't allow users to specify frames so the only way for a user to go from zero to animated gif is to create a series of images, merge their frames together into a single image instance and then save that.. 1. yes we should probably throw an ObjectDisposedException.\n\nI don;t think its really an issue that you can dispose of the ImageFrameCollection without disposing of the image. You can do the same for ImageFrame too.  I suppose we could have the Image expose and interface of IImageFrameCollection that doesn't support IDisposeable then the users can't call dispose of the collection separately to the Image.. I had thought about adding those as APIs (well in concept not name, couldn't think of what to call them) but I like it.\n\nThis makes me think we should find a way to extend the Mutate() apis to allow us to apply mutations to single frames... might need to extend expand IImageProcessors, as we will need  IFrameProcessors as well as IImageProcessors will also have to scope some of the APIs to allow targeting only images and not frames (resize, crop, rotate etc) unless we allow images to have frames with multiple dimensions and handle normalising frame sizes on a per encoder bases instead of during add frame (i.e. update gif to draw based on the first frame dimensions). I think we should leave it as is for now then... we can worry about that later if/when people hit issues with the API.. i've made it public in the Image-Frame branch. (as above)\nImageSharp.Web is in a separate respository so shouldn't really be included in this readme . ImageSharp.Web is actually in a separate respository so shouldn't really be included in this readme.. I've created a new repo for our samples you will want to use this instead.\nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/Samples/tree/master/ImageSharp. yeah I know.. that's why I quickly pushed up a version \ud83d\ude09 . for readability shouldn't this be a single call to  this.WorkspaceBlock1.NormalizeColorsAndRoundInplace(); with the if check inside the called method.. again I feel we should have a single call here called .RoundAndDownscale() that independently has the checks in. ~As long as SimdUtils.IsAvx2CompatibleArchitecture is a const then the jitter will remove the dead code for us but~ it will be much more readable as the callsite.. But I feel that SimdUtils.IsAvx2CompatibleArchitecture would have to be an aggressively inlined getter only property for the jitter to follow the fact that the count is a jitter time constant and cause the dead code to be eliminated. . I could be totally wrong and it's not the case, if its not then feel free to ignore.. If you don't think its worth the effort then feel free to leave it for now then.. is this still needed now you've moved to the ToAsciiByte style?. do we event need this at all? its only used here https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/blob/65b419085131fd6b7ba32d2709d0ce3bb61a4d3b/src/ImageSharp/Dithering/Ordered/OrderedDitherBase.cs#L29-L34 \nI feel its probably better to just moving the switch inline to that method and not add it unnecessarily to the public api. SimpleMemoryManager maybe?. Image shouldn't have any knowledge of its original loaded data.. this is why we removed the original image format from Image I think we need this API to return an ImageMetadata object instead that exposes all this info and not the based IImage interface.. nope they should be passed into the Configuration like they are and not into ImageFormatManager manager its just happen by chance that the things they are configuring are image formats rather than anything else.. I feel we should be using this setting as more of a hint than a hard rule. Basically we use it as permission to reset streams when they are seekable and when they are not then we use our current logic of copy and read from there.. not really needed on the interface as its an implementation details inside the XXXFrameQuantizer\nnoting can set it so it will only be configured during construction of a concrete type.\n. As with below DitherType  property not needed on interface and not even needed on classes as it can be infered by weather the IErrorDiffuser is set or not as they are immutable classes.. we will want to make these arrays param properties, this is true for all the extension methods ending with arrays. nope  feel free to drop. this need to be 499 not 500 as its one pixel wider than the buffer.. this class should be sealed as there is no reason to allow inheritance from this and it allows the jitter to optimise away the virtual calls to the base class. . as above sealed. as above sealed. as above sealed. as above sealed. as above sealed. can we drop the commented out code. fast path should be activated when solidBrush != null and any of these things are true:\nthis.options.BlenderMode == PixelBlenderMode.Normal && this.options.BlendPercentage == 1f && solidBrush.Color.ToVector4().W == 1f\nOR\nthis.options.BlenderMode == PixelBlenderMode.Over && this.options.BlendPercentage == 1f && solidBrush.Color.ToVector4().W == 1f\nOR\nthis.options.BlenderMode == PixelBlenderMode.Src\n. if we have this atall you would want to distinguish between default and not set because default(TPixel) would be == Transparent and you want to skip the code path if its not set at all.. oh yeah.. your right, ignore that in that case we can just skip the logic on default(TPixel) \ud83d\udc4d . this will fail if hex is an empty string. we should be checking the length > 0 too. Probably should be defensive over nulls as well.. won't this fail if this.palette isn't the correct length? just raising this as a subtle change of behavior that might introduce exceptions that previously (potentially incorrectly) allowed.\nnote: not asking for a change just pointing it out incase someone else thinks its important.. we shouldn't expose the buffer as a Memory as we then can't swap the buffer and return the memory to the Array pool other wise someone could have a reference to a piece of memory that has been returned to someone else or was owned by an external process and it could leak dangerous things . The image itself should be treated as Memory of sorts but can never share the hand over directly indefinitely. . We have no one actively after Memory<T> when Span<T> as having a reference to the image is right next to it. \nI vote we remove it from the API until we can expose it safely or at least its requested. Until then its an API we have to support which very easily (unlike span which is much harder and can only leak within a single stack) can leak the contents of memory at any random point in the future of the whole application.\nI think its too much risk with near to zero benefits that can be handled by keeping a reference to the Image.. 1.  Span<T> is now hidden away in the advanced namespace so we are much less likely to get people confused about using Span with async etc. \n2. you won't be doing pixel level operations over spans in a controller in MVC.. they will be advised to create a Processor and do there stuff there (MVC sorted)\n3. if you changes Span<T>  in DoOperationOnPixelsAsync with Image<T> you can now work async and only have a manor (aggressively in lines called over to get the Span<T> as required)\nIf you are using the API's that expose Span<T> we are deeming the user knowledgeable enough about the framework to handle/understand how async and Spans don't mix well.\nIf we don't expose Span<T> then users can't write new IImageProcessors they can do that without Memory<T> as that's exactly what we are doing internally.. I snuck this one in... this will allow users to render at DPIs other that 72.. I've been thinking about this and think we should just remove this set of APIs... its just a thin wrapper around TextBuilder.GenerateGlyphs from Shapes and you can already draw shapes... it would also encourage users to investigate the shapes apis and also allow us to drop the SixLabors.Shapes.Text package and switch down to just Fonts & Shapes directly, then is users want to do this we can direct them to the optional package that they can use.. it doesn't harm that its one less API to make sure is displaying correctly before we launch too.. your right... i'll add it to Fonts get it wired up.. ok.. i'll make them immutable again... was trying to find ways of reducing allocations by allow users to reuse as required, but its not a major gain really. yep. you can skip this for our net standard 2.0 > targets too so you probably want to change this to '$(TargetFramework)' == 'netstandard1.3' instead. The TextBuilder.GenerateGlyphs are really tests that belong in the Shapes project and not really Imagesharp concerns... as far and Imagesharp is concerned they will be paths and that it renders paths correctly.. we generally don't have ImageProcesses having any logic dependent on the PixelType do we really  need this? do we even need to know that its a 16bit image? normally we would convert the pixel to a Vector4 and process the buffer with no need for branching.. this can be done with a single loop of \nc#\nvar pixels = source.GetPixelSpan();\nfor (int i = 0; i < pixels.Length; i++){\n    int luminance = this.GetLuminance(in pixels[i], is16bitPerChannel, ref rgb24, ref rgb48);\n    histogram[luminance]++;\n}. should be a called with a using statment \nc#\nusing(IBuffer<int> buffer = memoryAllocator.AllocateClean<int>(luminanceLevels))\n{\n// wrap remaining code in here\n}. as above, as this doesn't actually depend on the relative position of the pixel then this can be done is a single loop over all the pixels.. Looking at the code the number of levels looks like its something that the user should be in control of. We should allow it to be passed in to the constructor of the processor but have a default value of 65536  this will give a good high quality default plus allow users to adjust as they desire to tweaking the output.. So it sounds like my suggestion will allow that and will work fine it will just over allocate on smaller pixel sizes but will allow users with higher quality pixel definitions to fully make use of the processor. \nUltimately we can't have processors that have logic dependent on the pixel type. All processors in the core of imagesharp have to have to work consistently no matter which pixel-type is used this includes custom user defined pixel types that might not even map to any sort of bit depth.... they could be using some high precision floating point value for each channel that doesn't map to any of those grayscale depths you are expecting thus we need to allow the user to influence the mapping.. \ud83d\udc4d this is awesome..\nWould love to be able to have a way for not needing to have the 2 usings here it would be nice if when constructing a wrapped Image<TPixel> we can tell it to own the memory manager directly and thus dispose of it when its disposed. That would then allow us to more easily develop an extension method directly against a S.D.Image.. value <=0 means it has to be > 0 . we should add the alpha blending option in here too.. we should clamp outside the loop. instead of adding FloatToStringUtil (and the extra allocation that involves) you should use this syntax instead:\npublic override string ToString() => FormattableString.Invariant($\"CieLab({this.L:#0.##}, {this.A:#0.##}, {this.B:#0.##})\");. @SixLabors/core looks like it might be time to drop net standard 1.1 support.. this.IsSolidBrushWithoutBlending(out SolidBrush<TPixel> solidBrush) should be only done once outside the loops as it can't change between lines.

I would not merge this before a commit of cleaning up the docs folder as I think it should be starting blank and only filled by the CI, but what do you say?. I'm going to close this out, in order to make a cleaner new PR. There is actually a missing step - the appveyor build then needs to push the resulting contents of docs/ to the repo - other wise there will be nothing to display.\nThat has to happen on your end though @JimBobSquarePants , as it will involve setting a key in AV settings (see here for some related material).

    "Andy-Wilkinson": "@JimBobSquarePants I've got the basics of reading the Tiff format itself working from my own project (I started here since many Camera Raw files are mutant Tiff files). As you mention, there are a number of compression formats, but the key ones probably aren't too much trouble. The one issue with my existing codebase is that it was a bit of an experiment in a more functional style of C#, rather than how you might structure it normally.\nAll that said, I know a fair amount about the Tiff format now, so probably would be able to make a quick start on a true ImageSharp Tiff codec pretty easily (and share a bit of the code where I can). Would you be interested in me picking up this issue and giving it a start? (especially since you guys seem to be busy enough with the existing codec perf \ud83d\ude04). @poeman16 : Unfortunately I've had pretty much zero time to devote to working on this pull request for a while. The foundations of parsing the TIFF structure was mostly in place, with the most complex area remaining being implementations for the different compression formations, in particular those based on JPEG. There would need to be some changes to fit with any changes in the ImageSharp design since the last commit. Definitely something that could be picked up by someone.. Looks good to me on the progress splitting ImageSharp into separate projects. If the decision is to version separately then is it worth splitting each project into a separate GitHub repo? You can then allow CI builds to version on their own, and set release versions independently with a git tag. This is the approach I took with https://github.com/OkraFramework, and is how https://github.com/aspnet is organised.\n@JimBobSquarePants You can create an 'ImageSharp' GitHub organisation to keep all the relevant projects together... And you get a nice imagesharp.github.io domain via GitHub pages. \ud83d\ude04 . As the project is being split into multiple projects, it is important to have a robust and consistent build process across multiple CI servers, and for multiple contributors. Is this a good point to introduce a build automation system?\nI have quite a bit of experience of doing this using Cake (http://cakebuild.net) from my Okra Framework project. This is cross-platform, highly configurable via C# and can run dotnet builds, run tests, patch assembly versions, create NuGet packages etc.\nThis could all be done as a separate PR once the projects have been split up. I would be happy to pick this one up if people are interested.... Awesome! A build.cmd script is a big step forward. And deterministic versions for each commit is great \ud83d\udc4d \nFrom experience I would still vouch for a build automation system, and this can be independent of the actual logic used (since Cake is C# based then your versioning logic could be copied and pasted directly too). It is more used as a task runner, handling which tasks to run along with their dependent tasks. The main advantage is robustness and flexibility, for example imaging being able to type,\n\nbuild to do the versioning and builds, along with failing the build with a failed unit test, generation of documentation, etc. And will clean everything up correctly even with a failed build.\nbuild RunBenchmarks to automatically build everything correctly and run the benchmarks\nbuild RunTests --Configuration=debug to run tests on a debug build\n\nThis can all be done with simple build scripts, but it is way simpler if a build framework like Cake is used.. PS... Cake is fully cross-platform too, so only one set of build scripts to write for Windows/Linux/OS X too. \ud83d\ude09 . Just a comment to flag that the Travis CI build is only building the main ImageSharp assembly. Should be able to use the nice versioning & build system @tocsoft has built since dotnet is cross-platform, but I guess it will need corresponding Linux shell scripts.\nProbably one to fix in a subsequent pull request - better to get this one merged and working with Appveyor first.. Great... Ultimately it would be nice for the Travis build to run unit tests etc., but that is out of scope for this PR.. WIP - Just enabling testing in Travis as a baseline for the fix.... Okay.... That seems to have done the job,\n\n=== TEST EXECUTION SUMMARY ===\n   ImageSharp.Tests  Total: 1337, Errors: 0, Failed: 0, Skipped: 0, Time: 74.964s. A bit of background on the fix for future reference.\n\nIssue: The current build of xUnit seems to corrupt the state of any Vector4instances passed via [MemberData(...)] (in fact this is true of even a simple struct with four fields of type float). I will submit this as a bug to the xUnit team.\nWorkaround: Pass the vector components as a float[], then recreate the Vector4in the test itself.. I've opened an issue on the xUnit repo too - https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/1069. Just seeding this [WIP] PR with the initial project structure. A bit of a mutant at the moment as I've only got the dotnet-preview4 tooling (.csproj based) on my dev PC at the moment, but this should all converge well before this gets merged. I've also introduced a separate unit testing project for rapid TDD, but this can be combined into the main test project before merging.\nQuick comment on the TiffGen code in the unit testing project - this is a set of classes for generating in-memory TIFF files for unit testing purposes. They are designed to be simple rather than performant (and therefore hopefully correct!), easily generate varied TIFF structures (including invalid TIFF files to show that the decoder correctly handles/throws on these) and allow checking that the decoder handles padding/oddly ordered blocks/etc.. Yeah - Sorry about that @antonfirsov . It is a bit of a mutant project at the with a mix of the project.json/.csproj approaches. I see that @JimBobSquarePants has merged the VS2017 branch, so I'll try to get everything consistent soon!. Thanks @JimBobSquarePants . The VS2017 merge has allowed me to bring everything together into the main ImageSharp solution. Just wishing now that I'd enabled StyleCop and Doc comments from the start! \ud83d\ude09 Almost there with fixing the warnings, and everything will be right going forward.. Thanks @JimBobSquarePants . I don't get as much time as I'd like to devote to this, but I'm slowly working through the different compression and pixel formats. Not sure how performance is going to be at this stage, but once everything is in place I'll do some more benchmarking. I've got some ideas for areas that are ripe for optimisation though.. Hi @JimBobSquarePants \nApologies that there's not been much progress recently - to be honest, I've not had time for much dev work so I've tended to drop in and out of my own experimental mini-projects when I get chance. The TIFF codec is going to require more of a concerted effort so it is probably best if you merge into a separate branch. It will open it up to multiple contributors to provide smaller PRs (I might get time for small chunks too).\nCheers,\n    Andy\nPS. I've signed the CLA.. Okay... The easy fix is to store the offset that we start at, and do all Seeks relative to this, i.e. InputStream.Seek(StartOffset + offset, SeekOrigin.Begin).\nI'd really love to get rid of the Seeks entirely, but unfortunately the TIFF file-format relies heavily on referencing offsets within the file. There is no way you can tell what the next bit of data is otherwise. As an example a file layout could be,\n0-8 -> TIFF file header (8 bytes) - references first IFD at offset 30000\n8-10000 -> Raw image data here\n30000-... -> IFD (basically an image header) - references image data at offset 8\nUntil you read the IFD at offset 30000, you have no way of telling what data is at offset 8 - it could be image data in an unknown compression/format, another IFD, strings from the metadata.  The format doesn't have any identifiers to let you know until you have read the IFD itself.\nAny clever ideas to avoid Seeks would be great though! :smile:. Interesting idea... There's definitely a place for sharing buffers in managing the performance of the existing code. I'm not sure how much benefit there will be for SignedRational arrays - they are pretty rare in TIFF files and I included them mainly for completeness. I'll get more of a feel for this as I try out a number of sample files.\nOn the other hand - I'm allocating a new byte[] in the GetBytes(...) method that should really be allocated once and reused. The returned byte[] doesn't even need to be the correct length, so I can make a good guess of the maximum likely size, and revert to a new byte[] only if there is a need to exceed this... I'll look into it.. There's a definitely a good rationale for centralising this logic. I'll see if I can do this in the future once I've got the main features working.. ",

I think the issue was fixed some time ago, but Visual Studio didn't correctly update the package.   I had to remove the package that was installed and then readd the latest version..

But NuGet use still its official one. \nThe solution is to use NuGet GUI (right click on the project > Manage NuGet packages). In the right corner you can choose which package source should be used. Select your added MyGet one, check include advance version and you can install the ImageShapepackage from MyGet.

    "mellinoe": "Could you give me a bit more guidance as to what the PixelAccessor does and what needs to be changed in it? Right now it looks fairly correct to me, but I'm not sure what the intended semantics are.\n. Since the current tests pass, maybe you could just show me a failing test case that I could add and then fix.\n. The test images look okay to me, as far as I can tell... Could you take a look for me and see if anything is wrong?\n. Latest version should be correct, and tests work for me.\n. I would recommend just using version 4.3.0 of System.Numerics.Vectors in every case here; the package is compatible with all of the frameworks used and should just \"do the right thing\" when used in each different framework.. The other option is to remove \"System.Numerics.Vectors\" from the \"frameworkassemblies\" section for net461. It should not be necessary (and doesn't really do anything here), unless I'm missing something.. This is the line I'm referring to. I think it should be removed:\nhttps://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/blob/master/src/ImageSharp/project.json#L85. On .NET Framework, the System.Numerics.Vectors assembly does not contain any types. We call it a \"facade assembly\", meaning it only contains type-forwards. In this case, it just type forwards things into System.Numerics.dll. So you only need to list System.Numerics.dll there, and that is done on line 84.. We'd be happy to discuss the System.Net.Http issue over in that corefx issue, if you'd like (and to avoid polluting the discussion here). My initial impression is that you need to just update your project to reference version \"4.3.1\" of System.Net.Http, which includes our recent fixes for the issues you're seeing (hopefully \ud83d\ude04 ).. > As far as I know integer type Vector lacks SIMD support for operations as basic as multiplication. Just run this benchmark if you don't believe me :P\nI wonder if @mellinoe or someone else has an idea regarding Vector, but I'm 90% sure, there is no easy win here. If we want a fast decoder we have no other options than following this plan:\nActually, we should support multiply on Vector<short>. The unfortunate part of the API currently is that there isn't a good way to figure out which primitive types support which individual operations. If you look at this inscrutable chart, you can get an idea of which mappings exist for different intrinsics. Here is the entry for multiply:\nSIMD_INTRINSIC(\"op_Multiply\", false, Mul, \"*\", TYP_STRUCT, 2, {TYP_STRUCT, TYP_STRUCT, TYP_UNDEF},   {TYP_INT, TYP_FLOAT, TYP_DOUBLE, TYP_SHORT,TYP_UNDEF, TYP_UNDEF, TYP_UNDEF, TYP_UNDEF, TYP_UNDEF, TYP_UNDEF})\nIt should support Int32, Single, Double, and Int16.\nThis line is also of interest. Your example isn't working because it uses UInt32, which is not one of the supported types. Note that most \"missing intrinsics\" are that way because the underlying hardware doesn't support it. In this particular case, I'm pretty positive that SSE does have instructions specifically for 16-bit signed integer multiplication. It should work.\nI would like to help give more pointers, although I'm not sure how deep I can get with the free time I have. Is there a particular spot that's been identified as a bottleneck I could try to analyze?. @antonfirsov That is correct. We have a proposal for Shift operations here: https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/16835, but we haven't committed to it yet. Knowing that you would use it is very valuable, hopefully we can move forward with it.\nInteger division indeed isn't supported, but I don't believe it is supported by the hardware. An option is to convert the values to floats, and then convert back. It's likely you'd want to wrap that up into some kind of helper method. We've recently added the integer and floating-point conversion methods necessary for this, but those will only be accelerated on .NET Core 2.0.. The key thing needed is a pinnable reference to the beginning of the pixel data, for use with PInvokes. Without it, I'm not able to upload the pixel data to OpenGL/Direct3D/Vulkan/etc. without copying out everything into an auxiliary buffer.\nEssentially, I need something that would satisfy this test:\nC#\npublic void CopyToOtherBuffer(Image<Rgba32> image, IntPtr otherBuffer, int size)\n{\n    Rgba32* pixelStart = PinImagePixelsSomehow(); // This is the function needed\n    int imageSizeInBytes = image.Width * image.Height * sizeof(Rgba32);\n    Buffer.MemoryCopy(pixelStart, otherBuffer.ToPointer(), size, imageSizeInBytes);\n    // otherBuffer should now contain the raw pixel data from image.\n}. Basically, the current version would work fine, but so would a GetReferenceToFirstPixel method -- I wouldn't need to get a reference to some other pixel generally speaking. If I did, I could just do some pointer arithmetic myself. If you are more comfortable exposing one or the other, then that is fine with me.. @tocsoft I think the class itself also needs to be made public -- it's internal right now.. This is up to you of course, but it may be worth adding a small test case for it, roughly like what I wrote above. It could create some native memory (Marshal.AllocHGlobal), call CopyToOtherBuffer (above), and then assert that all the pixels are the same, in order. (Then free the native memory :smile:) That's roughly the use case that I'm interested in anyways.. @tocsoft I'll take a crack at writing a test case -- will update when I have a branch with it.. https://github.com/mellinoe/ImageSharp/commit/e82f57bc5b375d2b7cabb00998c297a603acf6c9\nFeel free to cherry-pick it or just copy-paste -- whichever is more convenient..

    "adamsitnik": "\nSorry for the name drop\n\nNo problem, it was a good idea to ask me!\nTo tell the long story short: previous versions of BenchmarkDotNet (older than 0.10.1) did not have very accurate memory diagnostics. We were using ETW events to track the allocations, which have the accuracy of 100kB. We also did not scale the Gen 0/1/2 collections counts, as we do now.  What you can see is how many GCs took place for 1k of operations. We display info about that below the results table. \n@antonfirsov  My suggestion: if you want to compare some code please do that with 0.10.1. It's very accurate, I have spent few weeks to get it 100% accurate and trustworthy.\nFor the results that I can see above my guess is that you are either forcing a GC.Collect on your own (previous version would not include that) or you allocate a lot of object that are > 85kB, which are stored on LOH, which are born as Gen 2 objects and if they need to be reclaimed a Full GC takes place (Gen 0=>1=>2 & LOH). It's probably the LOH thing. Some good article about LOH. Pooling the memory buffers or using the native memory allocated with Marshal api could help with that. For pooling you can consider usage of System.Buffers package.\n. > @antonfirsov That's the number of GC collects per 1K operations I believe.\nExactly, which means that every third operation invokes full garbage collection.\nThe - means no collections. I suspect that the other library is using native memory internally. What I recommend is to try some Memory Profiler. The problem might be a limited compatibility with .NET Core and xprojs.\nTo workaround this you could create a csrpoj, add a reference to your dll and write some simple code that does the same thing that benchmark does. Then you could run some Allocations Profiler. The one that is build in VS 2015 should do the job.. > compare to this 0.9.9 benchmark\nDon't compare them. The previous results were not scaled, they were representing a total sum of all collections. And please use Memory Profiler to verify the results if you are not sure.

    "georgexcollins": "Just to check my understanding of the ResamplingWeightedProcessor: you can cheaply calculate the fractional offset of destination pixel when translated from source, because for a resize the horizontal offset is the same for every pixel in a column, and the vertical offset is the same for every pixel in a row. Is that correct?\nFor a rotation, this is not the case, every pixel has a different fraction of a pixel overlap when translated from source to destination image. Don't we have to calculate the interpolation weights for every pixel (in the pixel loop)?. I have added this, pull request will be coming. I'm not a Git user though so we'll see how that goes.. That makes sense, I thought there would be a better way. I have updated to use Buffer. I had some issues with Git where I originally committed using Github client with wrong email address, hopefully it's now sorted.. Thanks for the comments. As I said this is very much in progress, just checking I'm doing something worthwhile. I'll probably get back to this in a couple of weeks time.\n. Temporary commented out to aid debugging... It works fine in parallel.. I can add an overload to the ImageExtensions.Rotate to include a IRotationResampler, and then factor out the resampling logic into a bi-linear interpolation implementation of that interface. This would be much like the Resize setup. I thought I should be able to use the resamplers that already exist there but I cannot get my head around how the resize processor works. Any pointers welcome.. ",

    "davidliang2008": "Hi @JimBobSquarePants : Would it be helpful if you can move Quality field from each different EncoderOptions to its base class?\nCurrently I am using ImageSharp (version: 1.0.0-alpha9-00148) to crop and resize images from Azure blob storage and save them back. And I really don't care whether they're .gif, .jpeg, .png and other image types. I just want to maximize the image quality before saving them back to Steam.\n```\n        public Tuple CropAndResize(byte[] imageBytes, int offsetX, int offsetY, \n            int croppedWidth, int croppedHeight, int finalWidth, int finalHeight)\n        {\n            using (var image = Image.Load(imageBytes))\n            {\n                var croppedImage = image.Crop(new Rectangle(offsetX, offsetY, croppedWidth, croppedHeight))\n                    .Resize(finalWidth, finalHeight);\n            var currentFormat = croppedImage.CurrentImageFormat;\n            var currentEncoder = currentFormat.Encoder;\n\n            using (var ms = new MemoryStream())\n            {\n                if (currentEncoder is JpegEncoder)\n                {\n                    croppedImage.SaveAsJpeg(ms, new JpegEncoderOptions { Quality = 100 });\n                }\n                else if (currentEncoder is PngEncoder)\n                {\n                    croppedImage.SaveAsPng(ms, new PngEncoderOptions { Quality = 100 });\n                }\n                else if (currentEncoder is GifEncoder)\n                {\n                    croppedImage.SaveAsGif(ms, new GifEncoderOptions { Quality = 100 });\n                }\n                else\n                {\n                    croppedImage.Save(ms);\n                }\n\n                return Tuple.Create(currentFormat.Extension, ms.ToArray());\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n```\nThe .Save() method used to take an optional Quality parameter but I guess it got removed now.\nBy the way, I am very appreciated for this wonderful library, especially with .Net Core support!. Thanks for your quick reply @JimBobSquarePants ! Yes I had noticed I can pass in ResizeOptions and I've been reading those docs all day yesterday trying to figure out what those options do and what the defaults are but I think the docs are still unclear about that.\nFor example, if I just call .Resize(finalWidth, finalHeight), does it create ResizeOptions internally? If yes, I wonder what the defaults are.\nBack to your suggestion, I have tried to set the mode to BoxPad and set all the positions on anchor position. The resized image is still shifting to the top left.\nc#\n    .Resize(new ResizeOptions\n    {\n        Mode = ResizeMode.BoxPad,\n        Position = AnchorPositionMode.Center,\n        Size = new Size(finalWidth, finalHeight)\n    }));\nBy the way, I see CenterCoordinates property from ResizeOptions. What does it do? It doesn't say in the doc.\nThanks again,\nDavid Liang\n. The source code link is very helpful to see the default values! I deeply appreciate you and your team already for the efforts of making this awesome library! It would be more awesome if there is tutorial too!! Can't wait!\nI will give you couple screenshots with all the parameter values tomorrow! Thanks again!!. @JimBobSquarePants : The source image for testing is the one in Steps to reproduce section. Its dimension is 1280 x 720. I put the actual parameter values on each screenshot below. Let me know if you want me to type them out as text.\nYou can kind of see the expected result images on the preview section of each screenshot. Basically I expect if the source image has been zoomed in and the cropped area is bigger than the source image, the empty space will be preserved and transparent at the end (that's why I purposely save uploaded images to .png, even they're .jpg from the beginning).\nThe current result is, the final png will be always shifted to the top left, even I have spaces on the left and top when I crop it.\nRun 1\n\nRun 2\n\nRun 3\n\n.

    "JBildstein": "I wrote a color library in C#  which has ICC reading/writing already built in.\nIf you are interested I'd be willing to add that code to ImageSharp. I'll have to do some refactoring but it is very complete and works well. It does not include conversion though (started it but it's not nearly complete).\nHere are the relevant files: https://github.com/JBildstein/NCM/tree/master/ColorManager/ICC\nThe rest of the library overlaps a lot with the one from @tompazourek but has a different conversion approach.. sure, no problem! I'm happy that my endless reading of the ICC specs helps someone \ud83d\ude04\nYour start is great, because I don't have any documentation on my enum members (yet).\nI'll use the Exif code as a reference point on how to do things if that's alright.\nGetting write access to the branch works for me, definitely makes things easier.\nUsing Colorful.NET as a basis for the color conversion is a good idea since, as you said, my conversion is not compatible with .Net Core and his is very likely also easier to read.\nStill, it might be useful for cross referencing:\nhttps://github.com/JBildstein/NCM/tree/master/ColorManager/Conversions\nEven though the actual conversion is pieced together dynamically, most of the formulas can be found in that folder.\nYou have to be a bit careful though because sometimes things like range checking and whitepoint conversions are done elsewhere.. ICC conversion is tracked here: https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/pull/273\nI have written about half of the unit tests for the calculation bits (not pushed yet) and hope to do the rest soon. Work's keeping me a bit busy at the moment so it's going slower than I'd like.. @JimBobSquarePants good to know ^^ but I think it should definitely be done by 1.0\nthanks, I'll need some help (or some pointers) for integration and I'd love some feedback on the design.

The equality of the TagDataEntries was something I wanted to discuss with you but I have to admit that I forgot.\nThe issue with more data going is very likely related to that. An ICC profile can reuse the data for multiple entries and finding out if an entry is the same is done with Equals. I assume that some entries don't appear equal even if they are, so the data is written multiple times.\nI think there is also some potential for optimization by reading it only once and reusing the same instance but I'll have to check that again.. of course, I already know where and why this happens but need to think about how to solve it best.. I doubt it. It actually should never happen since you want to have a specific culture but I wanted to cover that path anyway without throwing an exception. The \"xx\" code does not actually exist in ISO 639-1 but \"zxx\" is used in ISO 639-2 as \"No linguistic content\". .Net uses \"iv\" for the invariant culture but that didn't seem very clear to me.. @JimBobSquarePants I think that should be possible yes. However you will have to create a new instance of the converter for each image because some data has to be pulled from the ICC profile. I mean, it would be possible to pass the profile for each conversion call but it would be horribly inefficient. So in the GetConverter method there would have to be an overload with an ICC profile.. @JimBobSquarePants no worries, the tests don't pass anyway at the moment (or rather, some aren't implemented yet).\nI finally found some time to work on this again and was able to implement most of the calculations. However, most of them haven't been tested yet and likely contain errors. It's rather cumbersome to do this so it takes a while.\nTo make things more manageable, I decided to implement everything with Vector4 so only colors with up to 4 channels are supported. And (for now) I also won't implement multi process elements mainly because I have yet to find a profile using them.\nI would be very glad if someone could have a look at my n-dimensional linear interpolation (ClutCalculator.cs). I think it basically works but I'm a bit lost and not sure about the correctness.\nWhat I know for sure is that finding the nodes is correct but not about the actual interpolation.. @JimBobSquarePants great, thank you very much. I'll be around on Gitter for questions and discussions.. @JimBobSquarePants, thank you very much for the review. I replaced the Math methods with MathF and will work on the interpolation a bit later.\nFor reference here's a quick explanation of the CLUT (Color LookUp Table) interpolation:\nIt's nothing more than an n-dimensional linear interpolation plus finding the nodes.\nThere are three things that need to be done and in the current interpolation method each step is a loop.\n1) Finding nodes:\nThis is an example CLUT, two input channels (A, B), three output channels (X, Y, Z) and a grid point count of 3 for A and B (it could be different for each channel but usually isn't). The values of X, Y, Z are nonsense and don't matter for this example.\n| A | B | X | Y | Z |\n| - | - | - | - | - |\n| 0 | 0 | 0.1 | 0.1 | 0.1 |\n| 0 | 0.5 | 0.2 | 0.2 | 0.2 |\n| 0 | 1 | 0.3 | 0.3 | 0.3 |\n| 0.5 | 0 | 0.4 | 0.4 | 0.4 |\n| 0.5 | 0.5 | 0.5 | 0.5 | 0.5 |\n| 0.5 | 1 | 0.6 | 0.6 | 0.6 |\n| 1 | 0 | 0.7 | 0.7 | 0.7 |\n| 1 | 0.5 | 0.8 | 0.8 | 0.8 |\n| 1 | 1 | 0.9 | 0.9 | 0.9 |\nThe values of A and B aren't actually stored anywhere, they can be calculated and this is what the inner loop does. The outer loop finds the nodes for the interpolation. To do the interpolation we need every variation of lower and higher values. E.g. if A = 0.3 and B = 0.8 then we need to interpolate the values at\n| A | B | | X | Y | Z |\n| - | - | - | - | - | - |\n| 0 | 0.5 | A low, B low | 0.2 | 0.2 | 0.2 |\n| 0 | 1 | A low, B high | 0.3 | 0.3 | 0.3 |\n| 0.5 | 0.5 | A high, B low | 0.5 | 0.5 | 0.5 |\n| 0.5 | 1 | A high, B high | 0.6 | 0.6 | 0.6 |\nThe line if (((i >> j) & 1) == 1) that @antonfirsov pointed out above was the simplest way I could think of to iterate over all variations of high and low (it's the same as an integer in binary). If there's a more vector friendly way I'd be happy to implement that.\n2) Calculating the factors for interpolation:\nThe actual interpolation is the same as described here for bilinear unit square but done for n channels instead of just two: Wikipedia\nThis part calculates all the factors for the third loop.\n3) Interpolation of the output:\nThis loop calculates the final interpolated output values for each output channel using the previously calculated factors.\nAs a reference, this is code from the official ICC repo:  InterpND\nThey also have separate interpolation routines for a channel count of 1 to 6 and it'll likely be a lot faster. I'd like to do the same later even if it won't be pretty. Having a working n-dimensional interpolation is still beneficial for reference/comparison and for potential expansion later.\n. impressive number! I'll soon be able to add some to that. I also have been working on some color conversion code lately that could be useful (it's using Vectors and is pretty fast)\nI signed the CLA again, no problem.. Been fiddling around with the CLUT interpolation:\nMethod |  Job | Runtime |      Mean |     Error |    StdDev |  Gen 0 | Allocated |\n----------- |----- |-------- |----------:|----------:|----------:|-------:|----------:|\nVectorized |  Clr |     Clr |  48.69 ns | 0.2570 ns | 0.2404 ns |      - |       0 B |\nLooped |  Clr |     Clr | 299.21 ns | 3.3207 ns | 3.1062 ns | 0.0277 |      88 B |\nVectorized | Core |    Core |  51.18 ns | 0.3024 ns | 0.2829 ns |      - |       0 B |\nLooped | Core |    Core | 240.43 ns | 1.4354 ns | 1.3427 ns | 0.0277 |      88 B |\nThe tested CLUT has three channels input and two channels output.\nLooped is the current implementation (for any amount of in- or output channels), Vectorized is a specific implementation for a 3-channel input CLUT and is using various Vector structs.\nI did a specific implementation each for an input channel count of 1, 2, 3 and 4.\nNeed to add a few more tests (4-channel input CLUT is still missing) but other than that it's looking pretty good.. no worries, I haven't changed anything in those files so I can take them from master as you say.. @JimBobSquarePants I just added two more cases to the existing tests (with es-XL and xy-XL) but running them normally in Visual Studio they pass as expected since I'm on Windows 10.\nHow can we ensure that the tests catch this error?\nIn any case, if you want I can do the fix with catching the CultureNotFoundException.\nI'd say if that happens, we try with to use language only and if that doesn't work, assign InvariantCulture as it's already done if no culture is given.. I checked out the image and it looks like the ICC data is corrupt (confirmed it with exiftool as well).\n@JimBobSquarePants, perhaps we could put some checks in place to exclude corrupt profiles. In this case a look at the header would be enough to filter it out. Reading the header is pretty safe and won't throw an exception even with nonsense data. (except for CreationDate, but there's already a try/catch around it).. There are several things we could check:\n - FileSignature: should always be set to \"acsp\", but it's not a hard requirement\n - DataColorSpace and ProfileConnectionSpace: has to be a member of the IccColorSpaceType enum. Custom values don't make any sense here so it's pretty safe to assume corruption.\n - RenderingIntent: can only be 0-3. Could be a custom value (very very unlikely though and not allowed by the specs afaik)\n - PcsIlluminant: it's an XYZ color so valid values are usually in the range of 0-1.x, anything bigger than two can probably be seen as invalid\nI wouldn't include length in the checks because a large number of values could be valid, e.g. from a couple dozen bytes to several MB. We could check for zero though, most checks above would report a valid value if the data is zeroed out, but a zero length doesn't make sense.\nMy suggestion would  be to always check if FileSignature is \"acsp\" and if that fails, perform the other checks to make sure. I don't know when it'd be best to perform the check though (and handle it).. It's another invalid ICC profile. This time it's only one tag tough. The text description tag consists of three differently encoded texts. ASCII, Unicode and ScriptCode. In this case the ASCII part reports a string length of 33 while it's actually 43. Then the it tries to read the Unicode length which should be zero, but actually reads part of the previous text and returns a huge number.\nI think I can add a safeguard around invalid tags like this by checking lengths against the tag size. If it's too big it'll stop trying to read the tag and report it as invalid or simply discard it.. @JimBobSquarePants, sure, I'll try to implement both fixes this week.. Fixed it with #647. do you mean removing data after \\0? If so, I've had some issues in the past when displaying strings without doing that. I think I had some profiles that had some nonsense characters after the first null terminator.\nIt's also unnecessary to keep it in, .Net doesn't need it and in the ICC profile it's just used to mark the end or for padding.. It should be yes, I remember wanting to do this but didn't know how to name it. Implemented it now with member names Type1-3. Maybe I should come back to this and give them some better names.\n(IccParametricCurve had the same problem, did that too now). cool thanks! was looking for an alternative but only found the UTF8 one. Fix it now everywhere I used it.. Yeah, I got the IsTrue/IsFalse the wrong way around...\nThanks for noticing! I fixed it now everywhere I used it.. did that now like it's done with Exif. Fixed!. It actually doesn't have to be, the second array is always the same length. In the Interpolate method it's currently useful though because I can just take the array reference instead of copying the values.\nDo you think it would be better to have it in a single memory block?. I'm not sure what you mean with the Span<byte> part but yes, I could use stackalloc also at other places and in general decrease memory allocations. I'll keep this in mind when I continue to work on it.. Ah yes that makes more sense. Thank you for the example, doing it like that is a lot better.. I initially wanted to put it there, but it's only called from Decode and Identify and not in ParseStream. In the go port it's called at the end of the ParseStream method (and by extension in Decode and Identify).\nShould we move AssignResolution there as well? I changed the return you mentioned to a break so things after the while loop will be executed.. yes they do, but ParseStream is public so it can be called directly, that's the only reason I wanted to do it there.\nSorry about the return thing, I thought break behaves differently at that point. We could use a \ngoto to jump out of the while (it's evil, I know :P)\nand no worries, it's a small change, I can do it.. ok great, then there's no reason to change anything in that regard.

I'll take a look at that.. Regarding Parallel.For usage, I apologize if everyone here is already familiar with it, but I stumbled upon this today, which is that when using Parallel.For with arrays or List you can get drastically better performance by using Parallel.ForEach along with a Partitioner. It is typically ~2x to ~4x faster depending on the work load and data width, and core count of the machine. This happens because you gaurantee to get big chunks of data that are accessed in order, and take advantage of CPU caches.\nThe default Partitioner.Create does batches of size   length/(logicalCoreCountt*3) but you can pick your own with Partitioner.Create(from,to,batchsize) to tune it for the workload.\n```c#\nvar rangePartitioner = Partitioner.Create(0, a.Length);\n    Parallel.ForEach(rangePartitioner,\n        () => 0,\n        (range, s, acc) =>\n        {      \n             for (int i = range.Item1; i < range.Item2; i++)\n             {\n                    acc += a[i];\n             }       \n             return acc;\n         },\n         acc => Interlocked.Add(ref sum, acc));\n```. No it depends on the workload. The default Create will spawn numLogicalCores*3 tasks, which is more than you want if you are just iterating over some arrays of value types and doing some maths, but might be less than you want if you are iterating over a file and loading bits at a time from disk or something.  Have to experiment.\nAlso, if you are just iterating over arrays and doing some maths, if System.Numerics has the math operations you are doing covered (or nearly so, you can drop out to scalar occasionally), that will tend to work out much better than parallelizing things.  No overhead managing the tasks, doesn't care how many cpus the machine has.  Any 64bit build is guaranteed to be running on a machine with at least SSE.\nI'm not really british I just like saying maths.. I noticed animated gifs were a bit slow to generate on Windows as well.  I wonder if given the frame by frame nature of the task if having an option to parallelize animated gifs would make sense?  . @JimBobSquarePants beta5.  It would be pretty snappy if it used all 8 logical cores.  I'll see if I can try the nightlies.\n. ",

Improvements as through what @antonfirsov mentioned are very likely to be possible nevertheless.. @springy76 it works, although as I said it's just a concept yet.. @tocsoft I know, documentation isn't complete, and I have some more features to add, but I think this is a good starting point as a first PR.\nTests failing since Merging master in 1cac740, not sure what happens, but accoring to @woutware he sees the same behaviour on master as well.. @JimBobSquarePants thanks for the hint, didn't think about the submodules. Will check soon (might be next week though). @JimBobSquarePants that did the trick - mostly. There are 6 remaining tests that fail for me, but those are due to me having a different system culture than Invariant/en-US: Those tests (not mine) compare exception messages to the one the English Windows Operating System throws - but Microsoft (whyever) decided to localize exception messages, so I get another message, thus the tests fail. \nThat is unrelated to this PR, so I might open another issue and PR to get that invariant of the culture in future.. @antonfirsov applying your suggestion to use the drawing test architecture - that's awesome, I'm quite impressed.\nNot complete yet, so changes will be pushed tomorrow, I guess.. @antonfirsov I want to double check which test cases are relevant, I shrinked the test images to reasonable sizes, but there may be test cases that are obsolete and could be removed (as they don't add value).\nThat's why I added [WIP] to the PR title again for now, will remove it once it's checked.. @JimBobSquarePants you're right. To lower the burden on you all I wanted to self-review my test cases once again before asking to add the reference images.\nCurrent state is: the tests are correct and the current images the code produce could be taken as reference images, but I have to review if the test set is reasonable (not too much redundant tests, no relevant test cases missing).\nI hope I'll get to it in the evening today.. I'm not satisfied with the state of the documentation, but I fear I'm blind to what's needed for someone not familiar with the API.\nDocumentation is in place, but I'm not sure if it's descriptive enough.\nAny hints on what to improve are welcome. If it's considered \"good enough\" feel free to merge now.\nReference Output of the test cases has changed slightly: Not the content of the individual images, but the images itself due to changed file names and slightly different test cases.

I could, but this is done by the compiler: Size is constant, so Size-1 is constant, and in fact the compiler simplifies the term.\nThus it's not only calculated once, it's calculated at compile time and the intermediate variable, used as VARIABLE would even harm performance instead.. minimized example on what the compiler does (even in debug mode, but release is sligthly more concise): https://sharplab.io/#v2:EYLgHgbALANALiAlgGwD4AEDMACdBGCXAJmwGEBYAKAG8rt7sBjAewDsBnObRVrgZUQAvAKbYAvNmgBuOgyy4CuKNgCyAQx4AKAA5qATmoC27BQAYA2gF1s+gObsAlLPq1KDd9gBmzPZp5dEMVMpbgAeAREAWjwQxABqOIdsVw8GAF9nbAzKNKA=\nyou see the constant value 63 in IL_0009 being loaded as ldc.i4.s 63.

Well, I'm a Unity 3D developer, so never really used NuGet to get things :/\nAlso, I never understood, why go through NuGet to deliver things, and not directly give a dll (or multiple dlls) containing everything?\nPlus, I'm on a Mac, and nuget on a Mac is not as easy to use as on Windows :). I tried to install it using Visual Studio Community 2015, everything was doing great until: \n\nFailed to add reference. The package 'ImageSharp' tried to add a framework reference to 'System.Runtime' which was not found in the GAC. This is possibly a bug in the package.

I believe mono ships with its own version of nuget but its a custom patched 2.8.4 build you should now be able to use the latest nuget.exe from nuget .org on linux/mac using mono.

    "springy76": "BTW: Source is available as BSD lib\n\"JPEG XR\" aka \"Windows Media Photo\" aka \"HD Photo\" is one of the 6 built-in codecs when using WPF. I used it to create thousands of preview images due to its small size and very fast decoding speed.. Using the code above in a single moment of time you have at least 4 copies of the pixel data in RAM:\n the original backing source\n the byte array\n* 2 copies in WriteableBitmap (which has its own back buffer for updates). @antonfirsov this looks great and will become handy for processing native memory buffers decoded by DirectShow, MediaFoundation, FFMPEG or similar.\n@jongleur1983 sorry, I overlooked your post. Does this really work? I thought WPF imaging is all about WIC (which gets powered by COM and native memory) and DirectX.\nBTW: BitmapSource.Create can create a CachedBitmap directly from a pointer which would reduce the amount of copies to 2.. Why there is this difference multi-image and multi-frame? Is there any other picture format than GIF which is multi-frame in way that every frame has the same size at all? Or will ImageSharp support movies in the future?\nIf you look at WPF BitmapSource (which is just a wrapper for the WIC API) then they also use the term \"Frame\", but it doesn't have a restriction of with or height, so they support TIFF just out of the box.\nAnd considering GIF: Even there every frame has its own width and height. But I don't remember if it was limited to delta-updates (building animations).. Hmm.. I can't remember having the need to resize an entire file but always only a specific frame of it.\nBTW: For GIFs in addition to the left-top-width-height properties per frame there is also a disposal mode for each frame. And it gets really \"funny\" to separate truecolor GIFs from animations.. ",
    "Auersberg": "@JimBobSquarePants Sorry, my mistake. Btw. good work.\n@eat-sleep-code Thank you for the info. Seems my version is from last week. I'll try it out.. I created a fresh new demo application (.NET Core) which references the latest release (ImageSharp: 1.0.0-alpha1-00102, other: 1.0.0-alpha1-00082) with the code provided above and did some tests with different JPEG images. Image resolution ranges from 72 dpi to 300 dpi. Output dpi is always set to 200 dpi. Some images are taken from a Smartphone, some are created by Photoshop and Paint.net, some are stock photos.\nOne image (stock photo) passed the test with the expected results (read/write resolution).\nRead image: Some images reported an incorrect resolution. 72dpi images showed 1 or 96 dpi. the 300 dpi images opened as 300x44 dpi (see first post).\nWrite image: Most images had the correct pixel dimension but the original resolution.\nI only tested JPEG images. AFAIK the JPEG file format can be challenging. In our .NET Framework apps we used PresentationCore for image processing and we also had problems with some image meta data (e.g. color profiles). But, I think there is definitely a problem with image resolution (read and write). \n. These are 3 of the images with the code I used. \nhttps://gist.github.com/Auersberg/f68967571463d53c82115e30f4bcfa71. Btw, the last one seems to be really broken. All programs report a different resolution (Photoshop: 72 dpi, Windows Explorer 96 dpi,  Paint/Paint.Net: 144 dpi). So, these application seem to use a default value if the image's meta-data is corrupt.. Looking throught the JPEG decoder class, there seems to be an error calculating the resolution:\nhttps://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/blob/master/src/ImageSharp.Formats.Jpeg/JpegDecoderCore.cs#L981\nThese 2 lines causing the issue:\n\nthis.horizontalResolution = (short)(this.Temp[9] + (this.Temp[10] << 8)); \nthis.verticalResolution = (short)(this.Temp[11] + (this.Temp[12] << 8)); \n\nMust be changed to:\n\nthis.horizontalResolution = (short)(this.Temp[9] + (this.Temp[8] << 8));\nthis.verticalResolution = (short)(this.Temp[11] + (this.Temp[10] << 8));\n. This fixes only the decoding part.\nWhen the resolution has been changed, the code also needs to update the XResolution/YResolution tags of the EXIF profile. Applications usually read these tags but only find the original values.. I'll wait. \nI am asking myself where the best place for this fix is? Maybe before writing the profile in the  WriteProfiles method (JpegEncoderCore.cs)\n\n    /// <summary>\n    /// Writes the metadata profiles to the image.\n    /// </summary>\n    /// <param name=\"image\">The image.</param>\n    /// <typeparam name=\"TColor\">The pixel format.</typeparam>\n    private void WriteProfiles(Image image)  where TColor : struct, IPackedPixel, IEquatable\n    {\n        this.FixExifHeaderResolution(image.ExifProfile, image.HorizontalResolution, image.VerticalResolution);\n\n        this.WriteProfile(image.ExifProfile);\n    }\n\n\n    /// <summary>\n    /// Sets new EXIF resolution if resolution has changed\n    /// </summary>\n    /// <param name=\"exifProfile\">The EXIF profile.</param>\n    /// <param name=\"resolutionX\">Horizontal resolution</param>\n    /// <param name=\"resolutionY\">Vertical resolution</param>\n    private void FixExifHeaderResolution(ExifProfile exifProfile, double resolutionX, double resolutionY)\n    {\n        if (exifProfile == null) return;\n\n        var exifResX = exifProfile.GetValue(ExifTag.XResolution);\n        if ((exifResX != null) && (exifResX.HasValue))\n        {\n            var exifValue = (Rational)exifResX.Value;\n            if ((exifValue.Numerator/exifValue.Denominator) != resolutionX)\n            {\n                var val = new Rational((uint)resolutionX, (uint)1, false);\n                exifProfile.SetValue(ExifTag.XResolution, val);\n            }\n        }\n\n        var exifResY = exifProfile.GetValue(ExifTag.YResolution);\n        if ((exifResY != null) && (exifResY.HasValue))\n        {\n            var exifValue = (Rational)exifResY.Value;\n            if ((exifValue.Numerator/exifValue.Denominator) != resolutionY)\n            {\n                var val = new Rational((uint)resolutionY, (uint)1, false);\n                exifProfile.SetValue(ExifTag.YResolution, val);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n. @dlemstra I use ImageMagick intensively in other projects. Nice to see you here. . @dlemstra Just tested your last PR.

Let me explain this on the raw image data (jpeg) of an image with 300x300dpi.\n300 is 0x012c as hex value. You can see the resolution at 0x000E-0x000F (horizontal) and 0x0010-0X0011 (vertical). \nThe current code reads the byte in 0x000F (2C) and then shifts the following byte (01) which is together 0x012C (300). This seems to be correct, but now the code calculates the vertical resolution. It reads 0x0011 (2C) and the following byte (00) which is shifted together 0x002C (44) like mentioned in my first post.\n\nif (this.isJfif) \n{ \n    this.horizontalResolution = (short)(this.Temp[9] + (this.Temp[10] << 8)); \n    this.verticalResolution = (short)(this.Temp[11] + (this.Temp[12] << 8)); \n}\n\n\nThis should be correct:\n\n    this.horizontalResolution = (short)(this.Temp[9] + (this.Temp[8] << 8)); \n    this.verticalResolution = (short)(this.Temp[11] + (this.Temp[10] << 8)); \n\nCode ref: https://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/blob/master/src/ImageSharp.Formats.Jpeg/JpegDecoderCore.cs#L977\n.

    "jrigsby": "I know this is closed but I'm having an issue in ImageSharp.Formats.Jpeg 1.0.0-alpha2-00117.  I looked at the source code for that version and it appears to have the changes from this fix.  I just looked at Image{TColor}.cs and saw changes that were done as part of this fix.  This seemed the most appropriate issue to keep it in but if Im wrong I dont mind being educated on whatever the rules are.  Assuming Im right here is the scenario.\nFiles mentioned below are available at https://github.com/jrigsby/ImageSharpIssue\nI upload file named TCRLogo_300px.jpg (has resolution of 72DPI) and run it through the following code.  Note, the code sees the resolution as 72DPI for this file.\n    ` ImageSharp.Configuration.Default.AddImageFormat(new JpegFormat());\n\n     var image = new ImageSharp.Image(file);\n\n     var maxWidthInPixels = maxWidthInInches * image.MetaData.HorizontalResolution; \n     var maxHeightInPixels = maxHeightInInches * image.MetaData.VerticalResolution;\n\n     image.Resize(new ResizeOptions {\n        Size = new ImageSharp.Size((int)maxWidthInPixels, (int)maxHeightInPixels),\n        Mode = ResizeMode.Max\n     });\n     image.MetaData.Quality = 100;\n     image.MetaData.ExifProfile = null;\n\n     var memStream = new MemoryStream();\n\n     image.Save(memStream);\n\n     memStream.Position = 0;\n     return memStream;`\n\nThis results in the stream being sent on to be stored in Azure storage.  I copied the file out as \"uploaded.jpg\".  I also tried saving it directly in this code vs sending it on to make sure it wasn't something else corrupting it.  It had the same issue so I assume it has nothing to do with other parts of my code.\nInspecting the file in windows shows a resolution of 72DPI.  However, I turned around and uploaded the \"uploaded.jpg\" file to see what the code would do with it, given it doesnt need resizing again it should end up being the same file.  The code sees it as 96DPI and the inch sizes are different.  I assume you can just pull uploaded.jpg and recreate that part directly.\nAlso, this is a separate and small issue but the descriptions for inchWidth and inchHeight speak of getting these values by multiplying pixel sizes by density.  I would think it is divided by density (assuming density is resolution).\nNote the following lines are in the last code I used but really dont change anything pertaining to the issue.\nimage.MetaData.Quality = 100;\n     image.MetaData.ExifProfile = null;\n. It's 72 before using imagesharp to resize it and then save it.  Image sharp still reports it to be 72 after resizing it and while it's in memory.  It's also 72 as far as windows is concerned when viewing properties of the resized \"uploaded.jog\".  It's only 96 when I load it again after having saved it.\nOn Mar 6, 2017, at 4:22 AM, James Jackson-South notifications@github.com<mailto:notifications@github.com> wrote:\nIt's 96 by default in System.Drawing also.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/issues/96#issuecomment-284343199, or mute the threadhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ANr2KpTHnBM5Agpk5maMdUCoCL35Gnjkks5ri9BWgaJpZM4Lx4GR.\n. Sorry, I skipped over that Windows choose 72 as the default.  So as ImageSharpe resizes it, it loses its resolution properties even though it shows them.  Ill try to see if there is some way to preserve that.. As best I can tell ImageSharp isnt preserving the resolution on save.\n`       \n         ImageSharp.Configuration.Default.AddImageFormat(new JpegFormat());\n     var maxWidthInInches = (float)1.75;\n     var maxHeightInInches = (float) .5;\n\n     //see github for image file\n     var image = new ImageSharp.Image(\"c:\\\\temp\\\\logos\\\\TCRLogo_300px.jpg\");\n\n     //At the point image metadata says the resolution is 72\n\n     var maxWidthInPixels = maxWidthInInches * image.MetaData.HorizontalResolution;\n     var maxHeightInPixels = maxHeightInInches * image.MetaData.VerticalResolution;\n\n     image.Resize(new ResizeOptions { \n        Size = new ImageSharp.Size((int)maxWidthInPixels, (int)maxHeightInPixels),\n        Mode = ResizeMode.Max\n     });\n\n     var memStream = new MemoryStream();\n\n     image.Save(memStream);\n\n     memStream.Position = 0;\n\n     image = new ImageSharp.Image(memStream);\n\n     //At the point image metadata says the resolution is 96`\n\nIf the default in ImageSharp is 96 and when the original image is loaded it says the resolution is 72, then I assume the original image resolution is set and that's what it is loading.  When image is resized it still says 72 in the metadata for the object.  If I save that to a stream and then load that stream into image, the resolution now reports 96.  It also does this if I save to the file system directly.  If there is something I am supposed to do to preserve the resolution I cannot figure it out.. ",

    "vpenades": "Hi, I've just began giving a try to ImageSharp, mostly because the pure managed approach. I was surprised to see the IDisposable in the Image object. Isn't this supposed to be used only when your class requires unmanaged resources only?\nIs it really used somewhere in the codebase? if not, is it supposed to be for when someone is willing to extend ImageBase in a way that might require unmanaged resources? And if that's the case, is it worth to put the extra burden of require the \"using\" everywhere just for the rare case of someone going in that direction?\nI think using IDisposable defeats the whole idea of pure managed. In my case, I wanted to use imageSharp in a project that moves images from one filter to another, in a way that's not easy to tell when to dispose an image.\nSo if there's a place for it, I give my vote to remove IDisposable . Hi, sorry to throw this here if it's not the right place.\nI was looking at the  Color structure, which is essentially a wrap over \"uint packedValue;\" , and, in order to access the RGBA components, it uses the classic bit-shift and mask operations, which are probably quite fast.\nIn the past, instead of using bit-shift/mask operations, I got used to use this trick:\n```\n[System.Runtime.InteropServices.StructLayout(System.Runtime.InteropServices.LayoutKind.Explicit, Size = 4)]\nstruct Color\n{\n[System.Runtime.InteropServices.FieldOffset(0)]\npublic UInt32 PackedValue;\n[System.Runtime.InteropServices.FieldOffset(0)]\npublic Byte Blue;\n[System.Runtime.InteropServices.FieldOffset(1)]\npublic Byte Green;\n[System.Runtime.InteropServices.FieldOffset(2)]\npublic Byte Red;\n[System.Runtime.InteropServices.FieldOffset(3)]\npublic Byte Alpha;\n}\n```\nIt might look weird and ugly, it is also sensitive to endianness, but it completely removes the bitshiftmask operations, which might improve performance.. I would suggest splitting formats by usage:\n- Main \"consumer\" formats like GIF, PNG, JPEG, would stay in the main assembly.\n- ImageSharp.EditableFormats for Edition/proffesional formats, like PSD, Krita, etc...\n- ImageSharp.LegacyFormats for PCX, TGA, etc\n- ImageSharp.GPUFormats for hardware accelerated formats like DDS\nThat would allow adding specialised support for each format group, without clogging the main namespace.\nFor example, GPU Formats will probably require:\n- CubeMap class to hold 6 images and serializable by the format encoders/decoders.\n- Mipmap/Anisotropic generation support.\n- Probably, some sort of additional processors for handling normal maps and other exotic texture maps.\nProfessional formats assembly could hold the specialised layering and composition infrastructure.. @tocsoft I have mixed feelings about removing Encoder/DecoderOptions; removing them would certainly simplify the API, but at the same time, as ImageSharp begins supporting more exotic formats, the requirement for per-format options would be life saving.\nFor example, I've wrote an implementation for ICO file format, to be able to save icon files; it takes any image as source, and in the enconding options you can choose which size levels and color patters you want to store, and upon saving, it does all the resizes for all the sizes selected.\nI also have code to support DDS and it would also require some special options, like supporting mipmap levels, cubemaps, etc. In fact, in order to save a cubemap DDS you would need 6 images as source... which is way beyond what can be achieved with \"options\" objects.\nMaybe the solution is just to have a general \"options\" for all formats, that would cover basic usage, and then, for exotic options, to use load/save options specific to the file format, something like this:\n```\nDdsEncoder : IImageEncoder\n{\n// default encoder\npublic void Encode(Image image, Stream stream, IEncoderOptions options) where TColor : struct, IPixel\n}\n// specific cubemap encoder for DDS format\npublic void EncodeCubeMap(Image up,Image down,Image left,Image right,Image front,Image back, Stream stream, IEncoderOptions options) where TColor : struct, IPixel\n}\n```\n. @tocsoft Yes, please;  I am using TextMeasure to create a fitting image from a given text, but it only works well with default TextGraphicsOptions settings. . Yes, it seems there's an issue with the Net.Native Compiler used by UWP in VS 2015.\nThe conditions to produce the exception (most of the time a null exception but not always) are these:\n- Visual Studio 2015\n- Target UWP store application\n- Release mode (with .Net.Native compiler enabled)\n- x86 target platform\n- Intensive use of System.Numeric.Vectors in multiple threads (as ImageSharp does)\nIf all these conditions meet, sometimes you get weird exceptions.\nI first found this bug two months ago in our own project and drove me crazy, finally I reported it to Microsoft and confirmed it was a bug in the compiler, which, apparently, it's been fixed on Visual Studio 2017.\nSolutions:\n\nAvoid using x86 target platform (which is the only one being affected) and debug/deploy x64 exclusively.\nSwitch to Visual Studio 2017.\n\nBtw, when I reported this bug to Microsoft, I also told them to keep an eye on ImageSharp, since there where high chances ImageSharp would be affected by this issue too... I recall Matthew from MS popped up here a while ago.... @mikegoatly As far as I know, no, I reported it through an unofficial channel, and I was told the issue was already solved in the first version of Vs2017... and that was the case since the moment we moved to VS2017 the problem disappeared.\nTo correctly identify the issue, be sure that you get different results when compiling in 32 and 64 bits... if it fails on both then it's another kind of bug than the reported here.\nIf it only fails in 32bit and works fine in 64bit, my suggestion is to report it to Microsoft, and carry on developing in 64bit only until they get the fix. This is what we did at the time.. @mikegoatly notice that this issue is deeply related to this one: #146 \nIf you read it, Matt Whilden suggest to write directly to dotnetnative@microsoft.com , dunno if it's still the right channel to solve this.\nAlso I would suggest to create a repo with a small project that reproduces the issue so others can check if it can be reproduced.\n. @mikegoatly thanks, did you got some insight of the compiler issue?\nIt's funny to see how imagesharp is prone to hit msbuild compiler bugs... \ud83d\ude02. @JimBobSquarePants The way I use these blend functions is pretty much the same used by photoshop, that is: I have a collection of layers, all of them with alpha mask, opacity, and blend mode, and I want to \"flatten\" all of them in one single image, preserving the combined alpha values of all the layers in the final image.\nWhen I needed to do that I also tried the standard W3C formulas, and soon discovered that, of all the formulas, only the AlphaBlend formula does preserve correctly the alpha value. All others, Multiply, Add, Overlay, etc... only work correctly if the target image is completely opaque. After some research, I figured out a general solution that works for all blend modes and treats alpha channel in exactly the same way, regardless of the operation to perform.\nThese formulas are certainly slower than a plain AlphaBlend, not only because the invoke function, but also because the division inside Compose , but I don't (only) seek performance in these formulas, that's why I left the original DrawImage extension (which uses the faster, plain AlphaBlend), In fact... the DrawImage extension I added with the function, lets people experiment with crazy filters, almost as if the function is a pixel shader...\nUnit tests.... I wanted to ask about that... how where should I place them ?\n. @JimBobSquarePants Yes, the functions I added produce the same results as photoshop (at least, they did a year ago when I programmed them!)\nIf you notice in the W3C specs, they only do true alpha blending between two transparent images for Alpha Blending AKA Normal mode. For all other modes, they do the maths against a solid color background image.\nIf you try all the W3C spec functions with two transparent images, you certainly get some nice images, but not what photoshop produces, and certainly not what an artist would expect. Anyway, with the images currently available in the test it's difficult to produce compositions that truly show the difference.\nGiven that my functions will be slower, It would make sense to keep both models around... the generalized solution for accurate/artistic/complex compositions, and the standard W3C functions for basic composition where performance is more critical.. @JimBobSquarePants Yes, with this approach, you can choose different strategies to select the best function for every case, for example, if the destination pixel format is know to be opaque, due to not having alpha, you could directly choose the faster functions optimized for opaque backgrounds... maybe it could be interesting to extend IPixel to inform, in some way, it has no alpha, or create another interface IOpaquePixel : IPixel that uses Vector3 instead of Vector4 ... I don't know... there's many choices here, but I think it's up to you now to choose the one you like\nBtw, I'll be off for a few days... dunno if there's anything else I need to do in my fork.... Given the pixel blender function is generic, it's going to be difficult to place it on a struct without making it also generic. Just popping for a second, I'm out and can't follow all the details... Don't disregard a function call as too slow. It was very slow in the first not 1.0 but the performance was improved over time. I don't have benchmarks, but I'm guessing it's probably as fast as any other virtual call. As reference, at work I'm using such functions to process Kinect video buffers in real-time.. Well... there's always a compromise between performance and flexibility/usability. I understand some people wants the highest performance possible for massive pixel processing... but others like me will priorize having a flexible and easy to use API.\nHaving said that, it's not my responsability to say where to set the red line between both... I'm just glad to try contribute in any way I can, and even if the proposal is not accepted (I guess will not) I'm just happy some ideas got through... since at the end, I am planning to use ImageSharp for many of my projects.\nRegarding performance, There's two ways I can think of that can improve the performance:\nFirst one, is to have a RowBlender instead of a PixelBlender:\n```\nabstract class RowBlender\n{\npublic PixelAccessor DstImage {get;set;}\npublic int DstRow {get;set;}\npublic int DstStart {get;set;}\npublic PixelAccessor SrcImage {get;set;}\npublic int SrcRow {get;set;}\npublic int SrcStart {get;set;}\npublic int PixelCount {get;set;}\npublic float Alpha {get;set;}\npublic abstract void Invoke();\n}\n```\nThis function would be called once per row instead of once per pixel, so the performance difference would be negligible.\nSecond one, the fastest one would be to inline everything, and just generate full blown DrawImageEffectProcessor classes with a T4 template, one per each blend mode.\nI don't like the second one because, even it might give performance comparable to the current processor, it removes the possibility to pass user pixel blenders.\nThe first one, the RowBlender would be a compromise between the easy yo use PixelBlender, and the generated processors... at least it gives users the possibility to program their own pixel blenders.\nSorry I can't follow the thread, I'll be off for 3 or 4 days\nCheers!\n. About processing large images, there's a common issue in .Net which is that very large memory chunks are not moved during a GC, which can result in out of memoty exceptions even when there's enough memory available.\nA solution for this I found in the past was to use a low level bitmap primitive that split images into chunks of 64x64 pixels, all wrapped with a generic IBitmap interface. That way, relatively small images, or images that would require very fast procesing (requeted upon image creation) would use an IBitmap that simply wraps an Array. Large images would use instead an IBitmap implementation that stores multiple chunks.. @Toxantron Not everybody is looking for performance; some years ago I was tasked to process images on the size of about 20.000 x 15.000 pixels, which allocated around 1gb RAM, in a single chunk. We also discovered that when compiling for x86, even if theoretically you can allocate 4gb, the Net Framework runtime was actually limited to 2gb only, essentially limiting the load of a single image of such size.\nIn practice, it was nearly impossible to load such image, because any time we had any object fragmenting the LOH, it was impossible to allocate more than 800 or 900mb in a single chunk, and ended with out of memory exceptions.\nWe looked for every single image library available at the time (+5 years), and we found all libraries of the time allocated a single chunk.\nWe ended developing our own custom image library which splitted images in chunks of less than 64kb, to allow the runtime to defragment memory, at the cost of performance.\nIt is true that time has passed, memory is not that scarce as it was 5 years ago and x64 is commonplace these days... but don't assume people is going to use image libraries the same way, or for the same reasons as you use them. For example, there's lots of areas related to scientific analysis, or design artists working with large form factors, which work with extremely large images.. @dlemstra I think we tried, but if I recall correctly, we had std:boost compiling  issues with other third party libraries.\n@antonfirsov that's great to know the GC also has the compact large objects feature, I wish I had it a while back.\n@Toxantron \ud83d\ude04 \n. Question: I thought the behaviour of ArrayPool was to keep the returned arrays as weak references, so if not used, or the GC needs memory, these arrays would be reclaimed by the GC at some point.\nBut from what I am reading, does this means the ArrayPool keeps the arrays forever??\n  . @antonfirsov So, from what you're saying, I understand the only proper way to use ImageSharp is in a short lived command line application that starts, does some image processing, and exits soon after?\nWhat about these use cases:\n\nGame App uses ImageSharp to procedurally generate textures at startup, them runs for four hours, without using ImageSharp anymore. (*)\nPaint Application, running for hours, where the artists loads and saves images of wildly different image sizes.\nAny other long running application that needs image processing, but also uses a lot of memory for its own purposes, for example, scientific analysis.\n\n(*) We wanted to use this technique as a trick to reduce application size on Android/iOS Apps. But, given the limited memory of these devices, it's simply not acceptable to leave an ArrayPool sitting there for the rest of the application's lifecycle... In Androd/iOS, 100mb can be the difference between staying alive or getting killed by the OS.\n** It's not like I neglect performance optimizations, I really really appreciate the length of the efforts you're all doing trying to optimize and improve ImageSharp's performance... but, a memory object that, once it's no longer used can't never be reclaimed by the GC is, by all means, a memory leak.\nFound this: ArrayPool's author not fond on ArrayPool.Shared for this very same reason.\n  . @JimBobSquarePants @antonfirsov Just think that one of the case scenarios in which we wanted to use ImageSharp was on an android App that is required to do some image processing at startup and then carry on with other stuff.\nOn 1Gb Ram Android devices, apps throw OufOfMem when they go close 700mb usage, So after ImageSharp processing is completed at startup, we need the GC to free every single used byte for the App, even small byte arrays for small images... on Android/iOS, every byte counts.\nMy suggestions:\n- Avoid ArrayPool<>.Shared (or any other kind of statically allocated pool that can't be released) at all costs... it only makes sense for a number of very specific, very controlled use cases, in others it's a plain memory leak.\n- If required, use local, disposable ArrayPools, like for example, in the JPEG encoder/decoder (the pool would be disposed after encode/decode)\n- I don't know the exact architecture of how processors work, but when you call Mutate, an instance of IImageProcessingContext is passed along several processors. Maybe that context could contain a local ArrayPool to be consumed by the processors using that context. No need to dispose because the ArrayPool itself would be reclaimed by the GC afterwards along with the processingcontext.\n  . @JulianRooze I think you're right... I have the feeling that Span<T> is intended to be used internally by advanced developers to improve performance, but not to be used as a type to be passed around as part of a public API.. I've been trying to understand how ArrayPools are being used along ImageSharp... and I would be glad to get some more insights on it...\nFor example, I've seen they're extensively used in OrigHuffmanTree , they're statically created, so once you create a single OrigHuffmanTree tree, they're created and there's no way of disposing them, even if you're not going to load any JPEG for the rest of the application's lifetime.\nI understand they give performance reasons, and the fact they're statically created give performance benefits when loading multiple jpegs, one after another.\nSo, what about a compromise solution ??\nI mean, at CreateHuffmanTrees(), we could create non static arraypools, and when constructiong the tree, we could pass the instances of the pools to each OrigHuffmanTreeobject.\nSo loading a single jpeg would benefit from ArrayPools, and when decoding is finished, the GC would eventually reclaim the ArrayPools along with the OrigHuffmanTreeobjects.\nIt's true that multiple jpeg loads would recreate the array pools, so some performance would be lost in here... that's why I called this a compromise between performance and memory management.\n. @antonfirsov I'm not working with servers, actually. Right now, my two main use cases with ImageSharp are these:\nSmartDevice game development: Use ImageSharp at application startup to procedurally generating some textures (by combining, blending, resizing and all sorts of transforms), while presenting a progress bar to the user. Then, run the game for hours. With ImageSharp's current behaviour, the pools would remain unused and keeping valuable memory from the rest of the app.\nA scriptable processing pipeline. not only for images but for other stuff too.... so if the user creates a script that first processes some very big images, and after that the script continues with audio or video processing, then all the memory previously used by ImageSharp cannot be reclaimed.\nMy feeling is that ImageSharp memory management is designed as if you're going to use ImageSharp, and only ImageSharp, continuously during all the application\u00b4s lifetime, if that's the case, then it's fantastic, but it will underperform for all other cases in which it's going to be used sparsely or in combination with other tasks.. Okey, there's yet another thing I wanted to do that might bomb the ArrayPools. I wanted to experiment with (software based) Anisotropic Filtering , for that I need to create several mipmaps of a image at different sizes, in fact, for a 256x256 image, if in normal mipmapping you would need 8 more variations down to size 1x1 , with anisotropic you need 64 variations!. @antonfirsov Some of it is located here but it's missing documentation, so I don't think you can use it straight away.\nLong story short, \u00dcberFactory is one of my pet projects, it's like a content processor you build by connecting nodes hierarchically, here's a screenshot:\n\nIt's a general purpose content processor, it's plugin based, and ImageSharp is used there as a plugin. I've put huge efforts to try making plugins as easy as possible, so theoretically, you can create your own plugins, for audio processing, 3d model conversion, etc. you can batch several tasks in a single project, and run it with a command line app.. @antonfirsov I've added a small step by step guide here , Alternatively, you can checkout the latest version and after building, load Epsylon.UberFactory.Editor.Tests\\ImageSharp Plugin Tests.uberfactory\nIf it's UberFactory related, feel free to open issues or comment there! \ud83d\ude04 \n. Elavorating what I've posted here , I think it's not that bad an idea, I'ts a huge breaking change, but I will also be future proof:\n\nMake Image<> constructor internal.\nMake image creation and load to be methods or MemoryManager.\n\nSo instead of doing:\nvar image1 = new Image<Rgba32>(ArrayPoolMemoryManager.Default, 512,512);\nwe woud do:\nvar image1 = ArrayPoolMemoryManager.Default.CreateImage<Rgba32>(512,512);\nvar image2 = ArrayPoolMemoryManager.Default.LoadImage(\"test.png\");\nWhich is much less ugly.\nAdvantages:\nIn the future, some MemoryManager might need to work with a special purpose kind of image. So having a factory is the perfect place to transparently extend the API, scenarios I can imagine:\n```\ninternal class FileMappedImage : Image\n{\n    //...\n}\npublic class FileMappedMemoryManager : MemoryManager\n{\n    public override Image Create(int width, int height)\n    {\n        return new FileMappedImage(width,height);\n    }\n}\n```\n. @tocsoft my feeling is that the default \"easy to use\" API favours a certain use case of ImageSharp, which is running continuously as a web service, and makes it utterly complicated for all other use cases. It might happen that the current, default use case is exactly what you need... but it's miles away from what I need, and what I am proposing is something that I think is neutral for all users.. Okey then, I'll give it a try. Some considerations:\nWhat about the newly introduced Memory<T> as a wrapper of Span<T>  , wouldn't IBuffer<T>  and IManagedByteBuffer  be a redundancy of Memory<T>??\nMemory<T> article here.\nWhat about mixing memory managers? As I understand from past conversations, if you want to create an image with a custom manager, it needs to be passed as an argument like this:\nnew Image(FancyMemoryManager, 512, 512);\nSo, under the same application context, it will be possible to create/load images using different memory managers.... and my concern is, what happens when you mix resources with different managers in the same pot.\nI ask, because I've seen there's some \"SwapBuffers\" being used in some processors, so if the SwapBuffers swap memory created with distinct memory managers, it can lead to trying to release a buffer with the wrong manager.\nAlso, some processors seem to require extra memory, like creating temporary images, etc... which is going to be the policy here? will they use the memory manager associated with the \"current image\", or they will need a memory manager to be passed to them too?. @antonfirsov \nThe worst case scenario I can foresee in the long run is this:\nLet's say ImageSharp suceeds, and it leads to an explosion of ImageSharp based libraries; Obviously, it's up to how sloppy the developers of these ImageSharp derived libraries are, but you might end having derived libraries with these behaviours:\n\nDerived libraries using the default memory manager.\nDerived libraries using a custom memory manager.\nDerived libraries letting the consumer to pass a memory manager.\n\nAnd at some point, a naive developer happily importing and mixing these derived libraries from nuget into a big application.\nThe issue about mixing managers is not only about how to do it, but also if it is allowed to be done.\nFrom the point of view of a large application consuming ImageSharp derived libraries from different sources, it should be convenient to set an application wide memory manager... but if the API allows creating derived libraries that use a custom manager internally, overriding the application wide manager....  I think you can see my point.\nIn the end, I don't know how to solve this... we have developers with wildly different memory management needs, so some sort of configuration mechanism is required... but letting configure the memory management can lead to interoperability problems between derived libraries, which is a very bad thing in the long run.\n. @antonfirsov Another curve ball (sorry, doing lots of tinkering with images lately)\nI'm developing a small 3D scene structure, basic geometry, transforms, materials and textures for in-memory manipulation.\nThe scene contains nodes, the nodes contain materials and the materials contain textures, the graph allows things like two different materials sharing the same texture, The idea is that everything works with managed memory for ease of use and simplicity.\nNow, since ImageSharp's image is IDisposable, the only way to properly dispose the textures is to make the material class IDisposable, and the nodes, and all the graph down to the tree root. And since texture instances can be shared, I would have to implement reference couting... this is definitely not what I want.\nI know removing the IDisposable from Image, or even adding an image type not requiring IDisposable is out of the question, so I was planning to use my own bitmap container (managed, and not requiring Dispose), and only when I need to do some ImageSharp operation, do something like this:\nusing(var image = new ImageSharp(texture.GetBytes(),texture.Width,Texture.Height))\n{\n    image.Mutate(dc => dc.Resize(256,256) );\n    texture.SetNewContent(image.Width, image.Height, image.GetBytes());\n}\nWould this be possible with the planned memory manager?. @antonfirsov Okey, I've tinkered a prototype of the managed image class I would use here.. @antonfirsov \nChecking the implementation of Buffer<T> IDisposable and Finalizer, I've noticed the finalizer is not disposing everything it should.\nThe current finalizer implementation here only unpins the GCHandle, but it doesn't free the actual buffer as the Dispose method does.\nI am aware there's probably a lof of changes with the upcoming memory managers, so I don't know if this detail is being tracked already.\nMy point is that an array built from a memory manager must be considered as an unmanaged resource, which means it is eligible to be released in the finalizer, so I guess it would look something like this:\n```\n~Buffer()\n        {\n            this.UnPin();\n        if (this.isPoolingOwner)\n        {\n            PixelDataPool<T>.Return(this.Array);\n        }\n    }\n\n```\nThe problem is that, as far as I know, the GC does not guarantee the order in which managed resources resources are freed, so, it might happen that this.Array has been already freed if it was created by the \"NullMemoryManager\".\nFor my use case scenarios, I was considering to rely more on the finalizer, and less on the Dispose(), but I can see a loophole here (that is, to rely on the finalizer to release resources):\nWith the current implementation, where the finalizer only does UnPin();\n\nFor images created with a PooledMemoryManager that requires releasing the resource, the finalizer would never return the memory back to the pool, causing a memory leak.\nFor images created with a NullMemoryManager, it would work fine.\n\nNow, let's fix the finalizer and add the release of the array:\n\nFor images created with PooledMemoryManager, the resource would be returned back to the pool. Since an instance of the array exists in the pool, it is guaranteed the Array object exists within the finalizer execution context.\nFor images created with NullMemoryManager, it can happen the GC has freed the Array before the Buffer's finalizer is called, so the call to the NullMemoryManager's Return might cause unexpected behaviour, maybe a GC exception.\n\nAnyway, I think the finalizer behaviour needs to be clarified, and in any case, It must free any resources that the GC cannot free on its own.\nThe only way I can think to easily fix this is the MemoryManagers to have a property that tells if the resources needs to be returned back to the manager, so for the NullMemoryManager, the Buffer would set isPoolingOwner to false, preventing the finalizer to do \"weird things\" with a potentially disposed object.\n. @antonfirsov Indeed!, that's precisely my point!\n. As an API suggestion:\nCustom PNG chunks can be very large, I've seen some applications that use a custom chunk to store the actual data in a PNG container that uses the PNG image as the thunbnail of the actual content.\nSo, since these chunks can only be useful for those that specifically want to load them, I would suggest to set a programmable filter in PNGDecoder, so only the chunk tags that are in the filter are copied to the MetaData structure.\nIn fact, consider PNG as a general container with a preview thumbnail.. I would detect this specific format, but just to throw a more specific exception, like \"malformed iPhone PNG detected\", I think it's Apple's responsability to write proper PNGs, not the responsability of others to read their malformed files.. After reviewing how ImageSharp handles pixel operations, here's a proposal:\ninternal PixelBlender should implement a public IPixelBlender that, at least, has the public abstract TPixel Blend(TPixel background, TPixel source, float amount); method\nAt PixelOperations  rename the existing internal GetPixelBlender to GetPixelBlenderInternal or something like that, and add a public GetPixelBlender returning the IPixelBlender interface\nThat would allow users to access this feature.\n. Reviewing the code, I have these considerations:\nIf PixelBlender is made public, the use cases can be:\n\nUse the Single Pixel \"Blend\" on random access pixel drawing.\nUse the Full Row \"Blend\" for specialised bulk drawing.\nThird parties implementing their own blending functions.\n\nif (3) is going to be allowed, the API should have to allow to pass the custom pixel blender with GraphicsOptions structure. not a big change.\nif (3) is going to be disallowed, I would consider not making PixelBlender public, and seeking for an alternative to allow the single pixel blend funcion accessible. maybe with a public IPixelBlender interface, a delegate \ud83d\ude13 ... or a IBlendedPixelsRandomAccess interface ...\n. @antonfirsov I can envision a custom PixelBlender would have nothing to do with the colorBlendingMode and  alphaCompositionMode  but something completely different. Think about some crazy psychodelic pixel effect.\nSo the API would be something like this IPixelBlenderFactory.GetPixelBlender<T>()\nGraphicsOptionswould use an instace of DefaultPixelBlenderFactory(alphaCompositionMode ,colorBlendingMode ); by default\nPersonally I think the PixelBlender feature is quite complete already (some ColorBlending ops still missing) but there's always people around experimenting new things, and who knows...\n. Here's the examples:\nOriginalTransparentWhite and OriginalTransparentBlack are, from the user's perspective, essentially the same. \nOriginalTransparentWhite: transparent pixels are white colored.\nOriginalTransparentBlack: transparent pixels are black colored.\nGaussianRadiusOne: Applying GaussianBlur filter of radius 1 in Photoshop (same result both images)\nDownsizedOnePixel: Resized from 256x256 to 255x255 in photoshop (same result both images)\nIn imagesharp, you will get \"bleed to black\" if you perform these operations in the OriginalTransparentBlack image.\nThe rule of thumb is that, for any operation, if the pixel is fully transparent, it's color should be irrelevant for any subsequent operation, and that not only includes blending, but also blurs, resizes, etc.\nI can figure supporting this is expensive... my guess is that IPixel could have a fast bool IsFullyTransparent property to check if an image has any fully transparent pixel, and choose between the current paths and the \"transparent pixel aware\" paths.\nTransparentReferenceExamples.zip\nBtw, you could add OriginalTransparentWhite and OriginalTransparentBlack to the unit tests... any filter processing these two images with the same parameters, should produce exactly the same final image.\n. @JimBobSquarePants I feel like the Premultiply/Unpremultiply trick would degrade the color precission if applied to 8 bit component pixels... it's something that can only be done at full Vector4 precission.. @JimBobSquarePants Also, I feel like the algorythms for BoxBlur and GaussianBlur would have to take a different approach than premultiply/unpremultiply.\nIn the case of blur, you actually blur only the visible pixels.. @JimBobSquarePants A well, yes, they also mention Blur.\nAnyway, the premultiply trick is something used for realtime rendering, because it's indended to be a \"final effect\", and the loss of quality/accuracy is acceptable.\nFor proper image processing, I feel like the main processing path should be accurate and strict on the results... after than it's fine to add faster paths on special cases (like fully opaque images). @JimBobSquarePants After reviewing the code, I think the color bleeding issue could be fixed here:\nResamplingWeightedProcessor.Weights.cs L94\nBy changing this line: result += v * weight;\nto: if (v.W >0) result += v * weight;\nSimilarly, here:\nConvolution2PassProcessor.cs L117\nFrom: destination += kernel[fy, fx] * currentColor;\nTo: if (currentColor.W >0) destination += kernel[fy, fx] * currentColor;\nThere's probably more places like this one that suffer of the same problem.\nAlso, not sure, but maybe this solution is faster/simpler than doing an alpha premultiply/postmultiply step.\n. @JimBobSquarePants what about defining a threshold value for every pixel format, that tells at which point the pixel becomes fully transparent? It could even be disabled by passing a negative infinity.\n@saucecontrol the RGB elements of a fully transparent pixel should be treated as irrelevant, not as black\nFor simplicity, let's assume two images of 2x1 pixel, and we want to reduce them to 1x1 pixel:\nImage 1:  255,255,255,255 -     0,0,0,0\nImage 2:  255,255,255,255 - 255,0,0,0\nFrom the point of view of a user viewing both images, the two images are visually equal, so all operations applied to these two images should be the same. In the example I've provided, both images should shrink to a single, 255,255,255,127 , white, half transparent pixel. The RGB part of the second pixel is irrelevant in this result.\n. I took the liberty to prepare this image as a test case:\n\nAt first sight it looks like Sistine Chapel painting.  @JimBobSquarePants I would suggest to add it to the test images.\nI've only tried with Resize and GaussianBlur, most probably, all convolutional filters are affected, but it's possible other filters might look weird too.\nSo far, Resize and GaussianBlur go Kaboom! with this image.\n. @JimBobSquarePants that image was the best way I could think to make the problem apparent, sometimes it's not easy to explain with words \ud83d\ude04 \n@saucecontrol Sure you can use it. \ud83d\udc4d . @JimBobSquarePants with ImageSharp you're going to experience developers stretching the library to its limits.\nIn some cases it's going to be developers handling extremely large images.\nIn some others, they'll want to handle thousands of very small images.\nImage collections have it's own uses: for example, finding a specific image on a collection, or looking for repeated images, etc.\nOne of the use cases I want to implement is to build an Atlas texture:\n\nStart with a collection of small images.\nRemove repeated images.\nSort the collection by pixel size, from larger to smaller.\nkeep adding the images in the collection to the Atlas image, by finding an empty region\nwhen trying to add an image to the Atlas there's no more space, grow the Atlas image x2\n\nThat's a common technique to fit textures of 3d models in a single texture, to build texture fonts, or even sprite sheets.\n. As far as I understand how this configurable memory manager works, it is designed to set a global memory manager before any other call, and then it uses that memory manager on everything; from requesting memory for image buffers to small streaming arrays.\nMy questions are:\n\nWhat happens if you switch memory manager on the fly, when you've already allocated images, or worse, when there's some asynchronous background image processing running.\nIt is possible to do this?: To use a \"Null\" memory manager to hold Image's buffers, but to use ArrayPools locally bounded to the context of encoders/decoders and processors.\n\nIf given the choice, I would like to configure ImageSharp like this:\n- Images will always use GC managed memory, even for small images.\n- Encoders, Decoders and processos would use ArrayPools associated to their lifetime, for example, a JpegEncoder would create an internal ArrayPool to reuse arrays within the context of encoding a given image, but when it's done, the ArrayPool is GC'ed along with the encoder.\nExample:\nvar image = new Image<Rgba32>(512,512); // memory held by standard GC'ed array\nimage.Mutate( dc => dc.Resize(256,256).Crop(48,48).GaussianBlur(2) ); // dc using local ArrayPools, GC'ed at the end of the mutation\nimage.Save(\"test.png\"); // png encoder using ArrayPools internally, again, GC'ed at the end of encoding\n// no need to dispose image since it's buffers are GC managed.\nIn this case, the image's internal buffer would be GC managed, but IImageProcessingContext would have a non static PooledMemoryManager used by all the processors, but GC'ed when the \"mutation\" is completed.\nFor me this is the ideal behaviour, because in my case it's a combination of performance, ease of use and guaranteeing when I've finished, all memory used by ImageSharp will be GC'ed\n. @antonfirsov my concern with static configurations is that I'm working with a plugin based system (I've pointed you to it before) in which I can have more than one ImageSharp based plugin loaded at the same time. (In the scenarios I have in mind, there will be lots!)\nSo I have these conflicting scenarios when I have two independently developed plugins being loaded at the same time:\n\nBoth plugins trying to configure the memory manager independently: the second setup attempt crashes.\nBoth leaving the configuration setup to the host application. In this case, I have to make the host application \"ImageSharp aware\" which defeats the purpose of being plugin based.\n\nThis can also happen with third party libraries extending or wrapping imagesharp, and willing to use it with a specific configuration; whenever you try to use libraries from different sources, we can end having conflicting configurations.\nThe only way I can think to solve this is to break the APIs and create objects through non static factory instances, but I guess it's a change too big to be considered.. @antonfirsov maybe the singleton can be dropped if we rename things: instead of calling it \"Configuration\" let's called \"Factory\", so the new API would look like this:\nvar image1 = PooledFactory.Default.Load(\"test.png\");\nvar image2 = GCManagedFactory.Default.CreateImage<Rgba32>(512,512);\nI think it's quite a huge change, but it's not that ugly. In fact, having the images created from factories would help future works when we require \"interop\" or file mapped images, which could be supported transparently.\n. Microsoft has recently released System.Drawing.Common , which is a  cross platform and NetStandard compatible package of the classic NetFX exclusive System.Drawing.Bitmap namespace.\nSo maybe it's worth to take into account too... but, as @saucecontrol commented here ... maybe not.\n. @tocsoft There's much more image interops than just these, and imho, some critical ones that are worth of attention;\n\nDirectX, OpenGL and Vulkan textures.\nGPU Computing: OpenCL, OpenCV, Cuda, etc\nUWP has its own device image format called Windows.Graphics.Imaging.SoftwareBitmap, that is typically used along with System.Windows.Media.Capture namespace. To make things worse, the whole System.Windows.Media.Capture uses, extensively, the Windows.Storage.Streams.IBuffer which is a half baked analogue of Span exclusive of UWP.\nI haven't checked in depth, but I can pressume the RealSense imaging acquisition library https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense also uses some low level form of image format optimized for high frequency image acquisition.\nPretty much the same goes for https://orbbec3d.com/ imaging aquisition devices.. @rytmis That's pretty much the same scenario I have. I still believe that using pools for caching lots and lots of very small, similar sized arrays, like handling server messages with lots of small POCOs, it's fine....\n\nBut images are too large, if the pool's memory cannot be completely disposed by the GC, or at will, there's many scenarios in which you can end up with your application running with less than half of available memory.\nIn fact, if input images can be uploaded by users, AND an attacker knows that you're using that kind of pool, at can devise some sort of attack by uploading carefully sized images that would fill all the pool's buckets rapidly, rendering the whole service underperforming, or throwing OutOfMem quite often.\n@antonfirsov , so, filling all the buckets of the pool is unlikely, unless we consider attacks to bring down a server scenarios.. @antonfirsov I'm not against ArrayPools, I agree they provide a performance benefit, I also want speed too!. \ud83d\ude04 \nWhat am I against is statically allocated, non disposable array pools. From your chart, what I want is that if you're no longer performing any sort of image processing, the memory usage to drop back to zero.. @dlemstra @JimBobSquarePants Additionally, if EXIF metadata is going to be affected by resizes, crops and other transformations, I would request as a feature, to also handle SubjectPosition and SubjectArea tags , since they also contain pixel based, positional information within the image.\nThis is obvious from the image  I linked before. It has SubjectArea located outside the image bounds, because the image was resized, but the resizing image didn't change the SubjectArea.. @JimBobSquarePants SubjectDistanceRange is an Enum, and my guess SubjectDistance is the depth from the camera in metres , so they should not be affected by transforms (unless we're talking about 3D transforms...)\nBy strip the tags, you mean remove them? or adjust the values? I have some utilities to easily access the Subject information here .\n. @antonfirsov ahhh, I didn't know about that one!. @antonfirsov Thanks for the great effort you've put on this!\nSo, from the code I've had the time to review, I undestand that any resource created without an explicit configuration will use the default MemoryManager set in the default, static, Configuration.\nSo, to use an alternative memory manager, there's two choices:\n- Explicitly set a memory manager to each created resource.\n- Set Configuration.Default.MemoryManager prior to any other operation\nIs that right?\nAbout your memory stress tests and the suggestion of never using SimpleGCMemoryManager; I can see that suggestion comes from the fact that SimpleGCMemoryManager performs slower, and consumes more memory than any of the other pooled memory managers...  under the assumption that you run ImageSharp non stop (web service scenario).\nBut that was never the point of that null memory manager; I would like to see what happens with all the memory managers with this alternative scenario (client application scenario)\n\nRun some resizes, like with the current stress tests.\nStop using ImageSharp, and run a full GC collection, one that also tries to free any large object.\nTest result: how much memory was actually freed, and how much is still locked by the array pools?\n\nThis scenario is more consistent with applications doing image processing sparsely, and then doing something completely different that would require as much memory available as possible.. @antonfirsov Upon a second review, I've realized the Configuration class essentially handles memory managers and image formats, but Image Formats are handled directly by the configuration class.\nMaybe it could be cleaner to have a image formats decoupled from Configurationinto it's own class ImageFormatsCollection that would keeps all the functionality related to image formats management, and would let Configuration to be greatly simplified.\nThat would make life easier when creating multiple configurations while keeping a shared collection of image formats. with the current configuration other than the default, you need to manually scan for all the formats in the default and copy them into your own configuration. If at some point during execution a new format is added to the default configuration, the manually created configurations will not be aware of the change.\nSomething like this:\nclass Configuration\n{\n    public ParallelOptions ParallelOptions {get;set;\n    public MemoryManager Manager {get; set;}\n    public FormatsCollection Formats {get; set;}\n}\nThis would allow having manually created configurations with their own formats, OR sharing the formats with the default configuration.. > @vpenades Looking at Configuration class I'm inclined to agree. A separate PR though I think.\n@JimBobSquarePants Yes, please, this PR is a bit useless if creating manual configurations is non trivial.. @JimBobSquarePants \nHow the hell Travis is detecting 5 image formats?? . Sooo... anything else?\nShould I remove the formats API from configuration? or I leave things are they're and merge?. @JimBobSquarePants @tocsoft I had to merge some changes from other PRs that have modified the Configuration.cs and caused a conflict. As far as I've seen, the oly change is the addition of ReadOrigin property, which I've also added to the copy constructor.\nI would humbly request a review for this just in case I didn't resolve the conflict correctly and I left something out.. With SimpleGCManager there's no fragmentation issues as long as retained memory is unreferenced and can be released by the GC.\nI think for server environments the problem is handling multiple requests simultaneously.  It's probably fine to receive a 6000x6000 images from time to time, the problem probably happens when you receive several big images at the same time.\nFor such scenarios I would suggest:\n\nuse SimpleGCManager\nPreload the image header to retrieve image size without actually loading the image, and treat small and big images with different rules:\n\n\nfor small images, do the image processing in the request itself. Multiple requests can be processes concurrently.\n\n\n\n\nfor large images, use a FIFO queue to process only one large image at a time. If the queue of large images is not empty, make the small image requests to wait. This way, the request to process the large image will probably have all the memory available for itself.. In my humble opinion, imagesharp should ship with SimpleCGManager by default.\n\n\n\nRight now it ships with a pool based manager, which is fast, but pooled based implementations require tight control of your environment and knowledge of what's happening under the hood. If you're a beginner or you're in a rush, you'll probably deploy without realizing these aspects, and then you begin having out of mem exceptions in production.\nKeep in mind that not all the people that has this problem come here to ask; some will think Imagesharp is unreliable and skip it.\nI think it's better to be complained about the library being slow, and point to how make it run fast, than to make it fast from the beginning and be complained about crashes.\n. @JimBobSquarePants Right now my hands are full at work and on another side project... maybe I could try to do something in two weeks if nobody else picks the task.\nJust did a fast overview of the code, and it implies changing the T4 template generators so they can produce more pixel blender combinations.. Ok, here's more or less:\nThe current set of PixelBlenders generated with the T4 has two flavours:\n- The Color Blenders, which use the SourceOver  alpha composer by default.\n- The Alpha Composers, which use the Source color blender by default.\nSo it's like if you have a NxM, but only Nx1 and 1xM combinations are being generated.\nThe current pixel blender generators look like this:\n```c#\n// Color blenders using alpha \"SourceOver\" composition\nGeneratePixelBlender(\"Multiply\");\nGeneratePixelBlender(\"Add\");\nGeneratePixelBlender(\"Subtract\");\n.\n.\n// Alpha composers using \"Source\" color\nGeneratePixelBlender(\"Atop\");\nGeneratePixelBlender(\"Over\");\nGeneratePixelBlender(\"In\");\n.\n.\n```\nAnd I think the T4 template generator should be changed so the generators would look like this:\n```c#\nGeneratePixelBlender(\"Source\",\"SourceOver\"); // Generates Source-SourceOver AKA Normal\n.\n.\nGeneratePixelBlender(\"Multiply\",\"SourceAtop\"); // Generates Multiply-SourceAtop\nGeneratePixelBlender(\"Multiply\",\"SourceOver\"); // Generates Multiply-SourceOver\nGeneratePixelBlender(\"Multiply\",\"SourceIn\");      // Generates Multiply-SourceIn\n.\n.\nGeneratePixelBlender(\"Add\",\"SourceAtop\"); // Generates Add-SourceAtop\nGeneratePixelBlender(\"Add\",\"SourceOver\"); // Generates Add-SourceOver\nGeneratePixelBlender(\"Add\",\"SourceIn\");      // Generates Add-SourceIn\n.\n.\n```\nA hurdle for doing this is that the code for each Color Blender is custom code, so the generator needs some way of getting such code, maybe with a switch statement within the generator.\nOnce all the ColorBlender x AlphaComposer combinations are ready, it's about splitting the enum into Alpha and Color blend modes, which would affect the API surface quite a lot.\nAn alternative from splitting the enum to avoid heavy API surface changes would be to declare it with flags, something like that:\nc#\n[flags]\nenum BlendMode\n{\n  ColorMask = 255,  \n  ColorSource = 1,\n  ColorDest = 2,\n  ColorMultiply = 3,\n  ColorAdd = 4,\n  .\n  .\n  AlphaMask = 255 << 8,\n  AlphaSourceAtop = 1 << 8,\n  AlphaSourceOver = 2 << 8,\n  AlphaSourceIn = 3 <<8,\n  AlphaSourceOut = 4 <<8,\n  AlphaDestAtop = 5 << 8,\n  AlphaDestOver = 6 << 8,\n  AlphaDestIn = 7 <<8,\n  AlphaDestOut = 8 <<8\n.\n.\n}\nSo defining a specific mode would look like this:\nmode = BlendMode.ColorMultiply | BlendMode.AlphaOver;\nAlso, changing the big span processors here would be required.\n. @dlemstra I had to undo some of your changes in order to easily allow all combinations; right now I'm looking only for something that works, I'm open to improvements and optimizations.\n@JimBobSquarePants @tocsoft let me know if you see something fishy; I know this part of the code is quite critical.\n. @JimBobSquarePants Thanks!\nNow that we have the building blocks to move on, here's the proposal:\nUntil now, with the current PixelBlenderMode enumeration we can choose to do Color Blending (Add, Multiply) OR Alpha Composition (SrcOver, SrcAtop)... but not both at the same time.\nIn order to support combined operations, I would like to propose splitting BlendMode in two enumerations:\n```c#\nenum ColorBlendingMode\n{\nNormal,\nAdd,\nMultiply,\nSubtract,\netc\n}\nc#\nenum AlphaCompositionMode\n{\nSrc,\nSrcOver,\nSrcAtop\nDst,\nDstOver,\nDstAtop,\netc\n}\n```\nAlso, GraphicsOptions would replace BlenderMode property with ColorBlendingand AlphaComposition properties.\nIn most cases, users will probably need to change only the ColorBlending property as they used to do with BlenderMode , and only those that would require doing masking operations would also change 'AlphaComposition' \nThe only drawback is that the PixelBlender selector here becomes more convoluted, and will require a two tier switch.\n. I would consider opening also the pixel blender API, at least the method that lets you process a single pixel.\nMaybe its not even required to expose the whole PixelBlender class.... Personally, I would consider adding a method that returns a delegate, something like this:\n```\ndelegate TPixel PixelFunction(TPixel backdrop, TPixel source, float opacity);\nPixelFunction .GetPixelBlendingFunction(PixelAlphaComposition composition, PixelColorBlending blending);\n```\nWhere <somewhere> would be TPixel itself.\nthis would allow something like this:\nvar pixelFunc = Rgba32.GetPixelBlendingFunction(SrcAtop,Multiply);\n. @antonfirsov I know, I am aware of that, and I guess you want to avoid exposing them to prevent end users implementing linear operations using naive loops.\nbut there's some scenarios in which they can be useful, specially for random pixel access.\nLet's say I want to render a star field, drawing random pixels ?  \nThere's lots of procedural algorythms that require non linear access to the pixels, and they cannot benefit from the pixel blenders.\nThe only alternative I could find around this is to add a .Mutate( c->DrawPointList(...) );  which could be parallelized.... but most probably users would call it using one pixel at a time.  But i'm sure it would still be much faster than drawing 1 pixel sized rectangles which is what I'm using right now.\nOne of my pet project was to port some of these examples  to .Net with ImageSharp. All these examples use random pixel access with blending.\n. Years ago, I had the need to handle very large images, with resize and all. At the time, NetFX3.5 was only able to handle single arrays of up to 2GB, but you got out of memory exceptions much sooner due to memory fragmentation.\nThe solution was to have a virtualized image over an IBitmap interface. The interface allowed to access the pixels as a continuous matrix. Under the hood, the image was stored as chunks of 256x256 pixels; this allowed better use of fragmented memory, since the image data was sparsely distributed filling the gaps of free memory.\nWith this approach, operations are, obviously, much slower, but hey, you cannot have big and fast at the same time.\nMaybe, for those that require handling extremely large images you could add a \"BigSlowImage\" class with limited functionality.. Reviewing the tests that are failing, I've noticed that some of them, like the ones that draw an Ellipse, are failing because the drawn ellipse has slightly different pixels than in the reference image, probably due to changes in how paths are being drawn.\nIn order to prevent unrelated changes affecting other tests I would suggest:\n- Using loaded images instead of shapes.\n- Using a custom, very basic, shape renderer within the tests suite.\n. @antonfirsov it's a bug.  Some of the blenders do fail because tiny differences in how the ellipse is being drawn right now, but others do fail because incorrect blending.\nI'm trying to replicate some of the changes made by @dlemstra , but I'm doing the testing by hand, manually comparing the generated and expected images.\nAs a side note, if at some point you consider moving from XUnit to NUnit, you have my vote; I seriously miss TestContext.AttachFile(path);\n. Okey, this is becoming much more complicated than I expected and It's way past the amount of time I had available for this issue.... I'll leave some comments in case people has more ideas on how to solve this:\n\nMy original implementation of Alpha Composing was done based on this, somehow, I missed the last Lerp, which seems to be needed for the alpha compositions to work correctly.\nCurrent Alpha Composing tests only use Normal Color Blending, and current Color Blending Tests use SrcOver alpha composition. This, combined with using flat/opaque images might lead for tests to pass, but when dealing with blending layers with translucid gradient content might be incorrect.\n\nCertainly, generating all possible combinations of Alpha Composing and Color Blending is tricky, but I would like to stress it's worth the pain: some specific combinations are incredibly useful and are widely used by photoshop for many special effects.\n. Okey, I've  been able to move this forward, and there's just a few combinations still failing:\n- Clear\n- (Src)In\n- (Src)Out\n- DestIn\n- DestOut\nAfter reviewing the images produced, I found this:\nClear: The Output and Expected images differ by 4% , but the images look the same... I don't see where's the difference\nSrcIn, SrcOut, DestIn, DestOut:\nI think the reference images are wrong, they look like \"XOR\".... the ones being produced seem to be more consistent with the specification:\nFor example SrcIn current output looks like this:\n\nWhile the reference looks like this:\n\nThe specification tells that (Src)In and (Src)Out must only draw the Source, thus, the reference must be wrong.\n@tocsoft @dlemstra what do you think?\n. @tocsoft yes, I noticed, but it is something I expected, the core team has a lot to chew and as you say, this issue was more or less closed. For me it's enough that this PR was not rejected straight away.\nAnyway, even if you think that the current solution is good enough, it still has bugs and some conceptual mistakes. I'm not blaming @dlemstra , there's several misconceptions about the composition modes, how they're used, and what to expect from them.\nWhat I'm trying to do is to get results similar to what photoshop produces, so my implementation is a mix of what I got from the theory, and from what I can expect in my experience using photoshop.\n. @tzachshabtay By far, then most useful combination is (Multiply|Add|Subtract) + SrcAtop\nThese examples use a Flat rendered font as Destinationand a blurred+tinted of the same font as Source\nMultiply+SrcAtop\n\nAdd+SrcAtop\n\nMultiply+SrcAtop using a pattern texture as Source\n\nOther combinations can be useful in certain cases, while some combinations are redundant and produce the same effect (for example, Xor & Clear produce the same result regadless of choosing Normal, Multiply, etc) but all combinations are provided for completeness and because the code generator automatically generates all possible combinations.\nThe ultimate goal is to combine multiple image effects like blur, emboss, etc, with color/alpha composition to achieve things like these.. @JimBobSquarePants It seems the SVG composition modes are explained here , I need a bit more research, but from a fast overview, it seems all modes are covered.\nThen, there's extended modes but we can really leave them for a future release:\n\nExtended color blend modes: Hue, Saturation, Color, Luminosity\nExtended alpha composition modes; all known modes, using inverse alpha: InvSrcAtop, InvSrcIn, etc\n\nAlpha blend modes can be done right now in two steps, but it's certainly slower.\n. I've found why the In Out DestIn DestOut  modes are still failing while the images produced look the same at first sight.\nHere's how the reference and output images look like, with and without alpha masking.\n| Reference image rgbA | output image rgbA |\n|-|-|\n|  |  |\n| RGB Only | Rgb Only |\n|  |  |\nThe difference in the result is because I've used a fast optimization that produces correct results, but leaves the RGB unmodified for fully transparent pixels.\nSo the image comparer is failing because it's determining two fully transparent pixels are different because their RGB part is different.\nI remember this is something we discussed in the past... there's some cases in which transparent pixels should be treated as equal, regardless of the values of their RGB parts.... it's like making the comparison with premultiplied values.\n@antonfirsov @JimBobSquarePants I am aware that in some other cases, comparing the RGBA as independent values is neccesary, but when the whole pipeline being tested essentially works with premultiplied values as it is the case of alpha composition, we need an image comparison mode that treats transparent values as equal, or in other way, compares alpha premultiplied values.. @JimBobSquarePants These are my In Out implementations:\n```\n        public static Vector4 In(Vector4 dst, Vector4 src, Vector4 blend)\n        {\n            src.W = dst.W * src.W;\n            return src;\n        }\n    public static Vector4 Out(Vector4 dst, Vector4 src)\n    {\n        src.W = (1 - dst.W) * src.W;\n        return src;\n    }\n\n```\nThe complete implementation would look like this:\n```\n        public static Vector4 In(Vector4 dst, Vector4 src, Vector4 blend)\n        {\n            float alpha = dst.W * src.W;\n        Vector4 color = src * alpha;                  // premultiply\n        color /= MathF.Max(alpha, Constants.Epsilon); // unpremultiply\n        color.W = alpha;\n\n        return color;\n    }\n\n    public static Vector4 Out(Vector4 dst, Vector4 src)\n    {\n        float alpha = (1 - dst.W) * src.W;\n\n        Vector4 color = src * alpha;                  // premultiply\n        color /= MathF.Max(alpha, Constants.Epsilon); // unpremultiply\n        color.W = alpha;\n\n        return color;\n    }\n\n```\nAs you can see, the complete implementation is applying a premultiply and an unpremultiply just one after the other. Which is a bit of a nonsense.\nThe trick here is that the MathF.Max is preventing a division by Alpha Zero, which is what's producing a RGBA=0,0,0,0 for all fully transparent cases.\nEdit: an alternative way would be to just do if (alpha == 0) return Vector4.Zero; , but this makes more obvious that when the functions return transparent, it is also required the RGB to be (0,0,0).\nI've just updated the functions to use pre/unpre multiplication. I preffer the tests to pass for now, and optimization can come later.\n. @JimBobSquarePants \n\nIn the above sample if dst.W * src.W is equal to 0 then the color is already <0,0,0,0>\n\nSo, you assume if Alpha is 0, the RGB must be zero too? both for input and output of functions?\n\nNot sure about the above now. The algorithm above doesn't seem to match the SVG spec.\n\nThe X,Y,Z is essentially a boolean mechanism to enable/disable parts of the complete formula. But the formulas I've seen in several places expect receiving unpremultiplied values, but deliver premultiplied values, or assume Dst is always opaque, that's why every attempt to implement all these formulas straight away from the documentation always fail.\nInstead, I've been trying to implement the formulas based on the expected outcome, for example:\nSrcIn:  \"Draw Src ONLY when both Src and Dst are visible\"\nSrcOut: \"Draw Src ONLY when Src is visible and Dst is invisible\"\nSrcAtop: \"Draw blend(Src,Dst) when BOTH Src and DSt are visible, Draw Dst when ONLY Dst is visible\"\nSrcOver: \"Draw blend(Src,Dst) when BOTH Src and Dst are visible,  Draw Dst when ONLY Dst is visible, Draw Src when ONLY Src is visible\"\nOf course, the \"visible/invisible\" is not boolean, but alpha weights.\nI agree that there's issues with the reference test images and how pixel comparison is defined, most of the tests I've been doing it's been comparing with the output of Photoshop and Krita, but for the most part, they operate only with SrcOver, then SrcAtop is a small change from SrcOver, and the rest of the compositions are much simpler.\n. @jimbobsquarepants yes, the code you annotated is the full code, collapsing the sections of the full formula that always resolve to zero.\nI'm going to do one or two more rounds of manual checking the formulas, but I believe they're right. So if the checks keep failing then it will be the time to amend them.\nOne thing to consider is that all the porter duff tests being done right now use fully opaque/ fully transparent pixels, but we would also need images with 50% transparency, because blending 50% source and 50% destination gives 75% opacity and that case needs to be tested. >> We've got failing tests in SolidFillBlendedShapesTests. Can you double check your output and update SixLabors/Imagesharp.Tests.Images#1 accordingly.\nI've reviewed the reference and output images:\nFirst of all, I noticed the reference images have been saved in PNG using 8 bits, using one of the palette colors as transparent, this seems to be messing with XOR and CLEAR, even the images look the same at first sight.\nAll the other reference images that fail are incorrect.\nSo I'm going to replace the reference images with the ones currently being generated.\nI was a bit puzzled about the meaning of the \"Clear\" mode;  At first I thought it was some sort of rubber mode that erases pixels whenever the source has some opacity; But that effect can be achieved with DestOut composition. So the Clear composition mode essentially makes transparent every pixel in the rectangle being processed, regadless of the content of Source and Destination. Not very useful, but it's there for completeness.\nThis is apparent with _1DarkBlueRect_2BlendHotPinkRect_3BlendSemiTransparentRedEllipse_mode-Clear\nThe reference looks like below, as if the rectangle is being masked with a circle.\n \nBut, the actual correct output is shown below. Notice that what is being masked is the whole area being drawn, regadless of the content having transparent pixels or not.\n\nAnother issue to take care when drawing with composition is to care about which pixels are processed compared to what is being drawn. For example, I've noticed when drawing an ellipse, the shape of the area being processed is the square region containing the ellipse. That means the pixels outside the filter are being affected by the filter, that's why some of the filter results look so weird\n. @JimBobSquarePants I guess Travis and AppVeyor still fail because the new tests are being done against the master Test-Samples repository, which has not been merged with the updated test images.\nI am not sure if it is possible to reconfigure this to tell travis to test against the test images fork. Otherwhise, it's about merging alltogether.\nOn a side note, I dislike having the sample images separated from the main repository, because it causes issues like this. I understand the reason of having the test images separated is to keep the main repository lightweight....  but in the end, adding new tests that also require new images in the repository makes things very tricky\n. @JimBobSquarePants surpringly, both images are correct. At first it did strike me, but after careful thinking, it's actually correct!\nLet's talk about this one:\n\nSo, what's going on here? first of all, think that we're using DEST, which essentially reverses what's being applied over what. If SOURCE-X  applies the source over the background, DEST-X applies the background over the source.\nThe drawing order is this:\n\nDraw a blue rectangle\nDraw a pink rectangle\nDraw an ellipse\n\nNotice that, in the 3rd step, the background, aka DEST, is an image that contains the two previously drawn rectangles, and is that image that's being drawn ATOP the image of the ellipse.\nSince we're using ImageBrush to render the elements, all the pixels of the square area are processed, ATOP operator states that only the pixels not transparent on the target image (in this case, the ellipse) are being drawn, it's as if the image below acts as a mask on the pixels on top, efectively clearing all the pixels outside the ellipse, but within the imagebrush.\n. @JimBobSquarePants thanks!\nMy hope is that this feature will be available before RC1.\nKeep in mind that this PR is the preparatory work for a second one, that would modify the BlenderMode enumeration. The idea is to be able to configure Alpha Composition and Color Blending separately. Personally, I would split it into two enumerations, which would be an API breaking change.. @JimBobSquarePants @tocsoft Some of the coverage tests are failing because the DrawImageProcessor methods I added are not being called from anywere because there were some missing methods in DrawImageExtensions.\nAnd looking at DrawImageExtensions I've noticed the arguments ordering is a bit of a mess....\nSome methods have opacity before blending, and others the opposite way.\nShould I rearrange the arguments so location is always first and opacity is always the last?\n\nfloat opacity\nPixelColorBlendingMode color, float opacity\nPixelColorBlendingMode color,PixelAlphaCompositionMode alpha, float opacity\nPoint location, float opacity\nPoint location, PixelColorBlendingMode color, float opacity\nPoint location, PixelColorBlendingMode color,PixelAlphaCompositionMode alpha, float opacity\n. Coverage test fails again? WTF, it was fine yesterday. On it.... Finally!. What about ManagedMemoryFactory and PooledMemoryFactory ?. Indeed... I was surprised too see that massive change.. That's an issue I would like to discuss. The \u00b4IConfigurationModule\u00b4 requires to pass a \u00b4Configuration\u00b4 instance. If we want to do the formats configuration in 'ImageFormatManager'  the parameter needs to be changed from Configuration to 'ImageFormatManager', which would lead to renaming the interface to 'IImageFormatModule' or something like that.\n\nBut I can see the \u00b4IConfigurationModule\u00b4 to be useful to intialize things other than image formats, so I believe it's still subject to debate.. I think the most common use is going to be create a copy of the Default configuration, that keeps all the internal objects shared with Default, and then change exactly what you want to change.\nBy doing a deep copy you loose the feature of sharing underlaying components between configurations. Sharing components can be really convenient for MemoryManager and ImageFormatManager; for example, we can have a derived configuration with a custom memory manager, but image formats shared with default, so if a new format is added later at runtime, the derived configurations automatically pick that new format.. I didn't remove them precisely because backwards compatibility. As an intermediate solution, they can be tagged with the Obsolete attribute for a while, so developers will have a cautionary warning to point to the right methods, and they can finally be removed after a while.. @JimBobSquarePants then what it needs a deep copy is MemoryManager and ImageFormatManager.\nIn the case of ImageFormatManager, should it also deep copy the formats themselves?. Indeed, using , params PointF[] is the whole point of this reordering. @tocsoft I'll take a look. Indeed..... When I had the DebugGuard set, FillRegionProcessor was producing some opacities of value 1.02xxx... the algorythms there probably need to be reviewed to ensure that opacity values are always in range. But since I don't fully understand what these functions do, I just added a clamp there.\nNow that the clamps are back into the pixels, these checks could be removed... . Ah, that one is no longer neccessary if the pixels do the clamp, I'll remove it now. Ahhh, okey, change it now. These are being clamped per pixel. that's why I wanted to remove them and replace them with DebugGuards.\nBut by using DebugGuards, several tests fail due to out of range values, which prevents the PR to pass the coverage tests,  etc.\nSo, for now, I preffer to go back to Clamp, and solve any potential out of range issues in future PRs\n. Sure, go for it!, it's just lunch time here! \ud83d\ude04 . So that's the thing that's been driving me crazy... . ",

    "Toxantron": "@JimBobSquarePants I use it with my installation and assume it should work for everyone else that can compile the projects with Visual Studio or the CLI.. @dlemstra I understand that. But the .NetStandard1.1 target only covers Framework 4.5 and above which is also  included explicitly in the project.json. The only thing you lose is compatibility with approximately 12 Windows Phones and Silverlight which will be probably be replaced by the time this \"goes public\".\nI apoligize for putting this in the wrong place. ;-). If we find the other 11 we might get this issue resolve quicker than I thought. :-D. Oh and by the way. You already helped my project a lot which I switched from ImageMagick to your library for cross-platform compatibility. ;-). Well, if I was as talented with image processing as I apparently am with picking my jokes, I would love to. \nYou did do a hell of a job on Windows which is why I picked it out of habit, but all I needed was resizing jpegs without any native platform dependencies and this just does the job.. @dlemstra unless there is something concrete I could help out with?. Sure, I'll take a look tomorrow night. Unfortunately if this works I am back to square one having to choose between two libraries. :-P. @JimBobSquarePants back to this issue. Would you be OK with a PR that only adds what I did instead of replacing netstandard1.1? This would let you two and your ten friends use Windows phone while .Net Core projects have a clean 1.6 reference.. Well, that worked like a charm.... @tocsoft I am starting to agree. While this works just fine for me it seems to cause more harm than good.. I might have gone at this the wrong way. Instead of upping the target framework upping the dependencies makes more sense. Well, a lot of trouble for nothing. :-). @JimBobSquarePants I am starting to understand why you postponed the whole version thing. ;-). @antonfirsov that is weird because it is a dependency and should be pulled automatically.\nThe error message is OK, I get the same. It is due to the missing optimizer flag in their project.. But @antonfirsov to answer your question. The change still works on Linux. ;-). As for appveyor that makes no sense - unless it failed in the packing step because of the new dependency. Which makes only little sense.. @vpenades the reason the CLR does not move objects larger than ~85kB is the negative performance impact. Objects that big are stored in the LOH. Splitting the images into movable chunks disables that optimization and will negatively influence performance.\nA large image still reserves the some amount of memory if split into chunks. Using the power of streams and the filesystem seems to be the better solution here. . @vpenades thank you for the clarification. \n@antonfirsov I fand that value as well. It comes with performance impacts, but at least we can leave it to the GC then and not implement our own version.. @devedse quick advice: VS supports conditional breakpoints. Just right click on it and add the condition from the if statement. This way you can debug without manipulating the code. . It does. Maybe I should fix that. Because there is a version for Mac as well.. I needed it for BenchmarkDotNet to reference the Benchmark project.json.. After a little research it seems that we can safely reference all platforms it shall run on. It will simply choose the right native libs at runtime to bind to..

Their move/act-of-desperation to Linux/Unix today just goes a long way towards saying that their strategy failed epically, at least on the server. \nJust look at all the hassle you have to go through if you want to write/release an application that supports mp3/mp4.\nSadly, that means we will only ever have windows/OsX support for webp by the time there is Office/AppleWorks for Linux. \nBut as Chromebooks outsell both iPad and traditional laptop sales by volume, rest assured - that day will come - eventually. \nAnd so will the day that google-docs in offline-mode reaches feature-parity with ms-office. \nThe day of reckoning, so to say. . @simeyla: SkiaSharp does support WebP, so just use it for that.

This works for all my Chrome desktop and mobile users. Then I need to create quantified PNG for Safari / IE separately. You guys are talking as if lack of support means you can't use it at all, but with a PICTURE element you just throw them both in and you're done. \nAgain, this is the whole reason I'm even looking at this because I need to auto-generate both and be able to change parameters easy to get best quality to filesize possible.. @JimBobSquarePants 'Many' is an ambiguous term I realize! I mentioned it mainly because it seemed ironic you seemed to be 'writing off' WebP for lack of browser support when the <picture> tag exists and your library makes it super easy to create images in different formats ;-)\nI am using palletized PNGs with alpha. Fortunately the images I need alpha for (3d renders) are very well suited to this (and I'm fine tuning them based on number of colors). In my tests I'm been quite amazed how well WebP is working and I have a very high percentage of Chrome / Android users so I was looking for a way to support all of them.\nI'm very glad to see libraries like yours existing and being actively worked on, but also somewhat disappointed in Microsoft that they don't have anything to offer themselves.

Good to see this great discussion. \nWe compare this library against our existing solutions with PresentationCore on the traditional framework. In some use cases we bulk-process multiple files with 5MB and more. In this scenario ImageSharp tends to be 2-3 times slower than PresentationCore. For instance, processing 5 images with 10MB: PresentationCore (10sec), ImageSharp (30sec). \nI don't know if the library can get faster with pure .NET code optimizations or if its only possible with native code as @antonfirsov mentioned. But once the library is published it will be benchmark tested with other solutions and libraries. So, it's better to keep an eye on this first. \nSo, totally agree to @antonfirsov . @antonfirsov Sorry, DOD of course. In general, the images we process can be of any size, from 1MB to 50MB. The test is not very sophisticated, just System.Diagnostics.StopWatch. We processed (resize/crop/canvas) 5 JPG files with 10MB on a Quad-Core processor and outputted also to JPG.\nA while ago we ported  some of our applications to .NET Core. In traditional .NET we use PresentationCore for image processing. After some research and tests we think that ImageSharp has the capability to become the standard library for .NET Core regarding image processing.\n@JimBobSquarePants Most important for us is cross-plattform. Then comes performance and quality. Quality is quite good. And we don't really expect the library to beat PresentationCore. By the way, PresentationCore has it's own oddities and, most important, I can't run it on Linux or Mac ;-). Mmmh, yeah, but I don't know if this has any benefit. I have to deal with very large files, more than 1GB in general and up to 50MB when it comes to image files. So, we need do automated profiling..

But if the library wants to handle it, it should set the number of components to the length of the byte array:\nhttps://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/blob/master/src/ImageSharp/MetaData/Profiles/Exif/ExifReader.cs#L322\n. @antonfirsov Ever thought about using Memory Mapped Files for large files (temp file) in addition to ArrayPool for smaller files? With MMF you can limit memory usage without giving up the other goals (CPU). It's easy to implement and really fast since its just a wrapper. Windows itself uses it to load dlls and resources as you can see in a memory viewer. Maybe implement some kind of a simple MemoryController allocating memory from ArrayPool for smaller files and MMF views for larger files.  It's available for netstandard1.3.\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd997372(v=vs.110).aspx\nhttps://www.nuget.org/packages/System.IO.MemoryMappedFiles/. @antonfirsov Definitely worth taking a closer look into it. You can use it in this library for two purposes:\n1. Load only parts (views) of the original file into memory (when the file is provided as file path).\n2. Create a Memory Mapped File and decode into memory backed by this file.\nWe have to deal with very large files and this is the smartest way for us to handle it.\n. Did some proof-of-concept coding. My current experience is from the MemoryMappedFile class in the full Framework. The NuGet package for netstandard1.3 has a little different API and, as always, there is literally no documentation out there for the NuGet package version.  Anyway!\nI created a small MemoryManager class that gets arrays from ArrayPool<DecodedBlocks> for a configurable amount of decoded blocks (e.g. 10k-100k) and switches to MMF if the image needs more. So, in this first shot only the DecodedBlockArray struct benefits from the memory manager. Later this should be a generic memory manager accessible for all types in the library of course. Just a test. \nBelow is the memory profile from the image @BrianJThomson used above now backed by memory mapped files. \n\nLook at DecoderBlockArrray[]. In the test form @BrianJThomson this was 377MB per component. Ok, just fun, this can't be used in production since I limited things to 1 decoded block per component at a time in this run, just to make sure this works (1 block is 268 bytes). So in real life we want to configure the blocks to maybe 10.000 which results in 2.5MB memory allocation for each component.\nPossible problems:\n- Does it work reliably on all devices and target platforms (Linux, MacOs)? \n- How does the massive parallel and unsafe code work with MMF. Is it reliable? \n- Performance: Memory mapped file code execution was 20-25% slower than the ArrayPool counterpart because of additional file I/O. In general: Smaller views (MemoryMappedViewAccessor) lead to increasing file I/O but less memory consumption and vice versa. No surprise ;-)\nSo, it's possible to implement Memory Mapped Files in this library, but this comes at a price (performance, reliability?). I think there are more important things to do now. . >  might be naive, but I think if it's the part of the standard, than it should be OK.\nYeah, it's just that I am always tense developing things for one platform and then run it the first time on another. By the way, System.IO.MemoryMappedFiles is part of the Microsoft.NETCore.App SDK as you can see when you search for this namespace in Solution Explorer. So I think CoreClr and CoreFx itself making heavy use of it and it should run well on other platforms. \n\nWe should avoid parallel processing when operating on MMF buffers. It's not hard to do so in Jpeg code.\n\nIt just needs to be carefully designed and benchmarked. For example: If we have a fixed memory area in a view multiple threads can work on it without problem as long as there are no concurrent read/write operations (Mutexes should be avoided of course). If, on the other hand, multiple threads need to walk through the whole memory or large parts, it needs a different strategy. But there are well known design patterns for this.\n\nDo you think it's possible to integrate it with our core memory buffer class?\n\nSeems good to me. . Looks good. I like that you provide extensibility, because the library itself cannot implement optimized code for all conceivable runtime environments,  \ud83d\udc4d . @tocsoft We had a similar issue in our testing. I don't think it is an ICC issue, because ICC is non-destructive, so the underlying pixel is the same with or without ICC profile, only the monitor display color  changes. I didn't test the image, but I bet if we open it in Photoshop and remove the ICC profile we will always get the same color values for this pixel.\n . Yes, fixes #132 and related issues with those weird EXIF values.. I thought the same the first time I saw this error. But, there is no error during reading the EXIF data. The exception occurs later when the image is saved. Then ExifWriter tries to cast the byte array to a single byte:\n\nprivate int WriteValue(ExifDataType dataType, object value, byte[] destination, int offset)\n{\n     switch (dataType)\n    {\n        case ExifDataType.Byte:\n        case ExifDataType.Undefined:\n            destination[offset] = (byte)value;   // value is a byte array -> InvalidCastException\n            return offset + 1;\n        [...]\n    }\n}\n\nBut source of the problem is in ExifReader, because the Exif type Undefined should not have NumberOfComponents set to 0. And this is what the test does, it checks that NumberOfComponents != 0:\n\nif (entry.DataType == ExifDataType.Undefined)\n{\n    Assert.NotEqual(0, entry.NumberOfComponents);\n}\n\nBtw, NumberOfComponents can have any value greater than 0 with ExifType Undefinded. But if it's 0 it must be set to 4 as a fallback, we handle it now as number of bytes. So in my opinion your test is not correct because NumberOfComponents can have any value (if provided) except 0. Your test:\n\nif (value.DataType == ExifDataType.Undefined) \n{ \n    Assert.AreEqual(4, value.NumberOfComponents);\n}\n \nIf you want to have the exception, just save the image in the unpatched version and ExifWriter will throw an InvalidCastException.. Ok, misread your note. Thanks.. Unit test updated. Since NumberOfComponents has a default value of 1 the previous version always passed the test.. In general I agree with you. Regarding network streams the library already takes care. A network stream is non-seekable and because the library needs a seekable stream it copies the stream to a MemoryStream. This operation ensures that the stream has been fully transmitted. But maybe this should be an async operation in order to not block the thread like it does currently.\nhttps://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageSharp/blob/master/src/ImageSharp/Image.FromStream.cs#L225\nSo I do not think this is currently a big problem but it might be handled.\nThis said, I consider it as bad practice for the calling code to rely on the library to handle network streams correctly. The calling code is clearly responsible here. . ",

It was the IO process itself that was taking roughly 350 msec and not your library.

So, I eat my words and apologize for jabbing performance. . @antonfirsov of course, stack overflow is a hole.

    "DeCarabas": "I'd take something as simple as the ability to reach in and tweak the individual pool settings. An overall memory usage policy sounds appealing but I think would be (a) hard to implement and (b) hard for me to really tune properly. Whereas I have a bunch of heap dumps and statistics around pool sizes that I can reason about for various pools.... @antonfirsov I appreciate the desire to hide the pools from the caller, but then you're left with several unappealing options.\n\nYou can try to have a single capped pool that dynamically trades off against other pools.\nYou can try to have a single limit, and somehow divide up that limit amongst other pools.\nYou can try to have a single per-pool limit.\n\nThe problem with option 1 is that picking a good policy is hard-- how do you trade DecodedBlock off vs. Pixel? What if I consume the entire pool with DecodedBlock at the beginning of my program and then never it again, since I spend the rest of the time doing image manipulation on uncompressed pixels?\nThe problem with option 2 is similar-- if you try to protect the pool for pixels by dividing the limit up \"statically\", then you waste by reserving memory even when you don't know the pool will ever be used. Why is the array pool for pixels smaller even if I never end up deocoding JPEGs? \nThe problem with option 3 is that you haven't really hidden the number of pools from me-- you've just made it harder for me to figure out how I should set the limit, since the real limit is now the per-pool-cap times the number of pools. I can do this; I have the memory statistics, I've dumped the heap, I know where to tune, but you haven't hidden anything from me, really, just made it harder to figure out.. @JimBobSquarePants Yeah I'm not entirely sure what I was trying to load that allocated 70MB of DecodedBlock; I probably need to do something to protect myself from that anyway. \nBut the pool is not that smart-- it doesn't have any kind of idle shrinking capability, it doesn't shrink on memory pressure, and it has this annoying power-of-two thing that can end up wildly over-allocating in order to hit the bucket.\nThe power-of-two thing is annoying because I was not necessarily using that 300MB concurrently-- if I needed an array of 131,073 DecodedBlocks I would have ended up allocating 262,144 of them. In the dump I'm looking at now, I have one such array at that size, for 70MB, and three at 131,072, at 35MB a piece. I only needed to get asked for an array of 65,537 blocks to allocate one of those... at those sizes I would much rather stop using the array pool and ask the allocator for an exact fit instead.. @antonfirsov Totally understand on both points; I expect tuning parameters to be something weird and fiddly and likely to break at a moment's notice. \nThis is always the difficulty with adding caches to libraries like this-- you can't meaningfully add a cache without being in complete control of the resources you're using for your cache, and your library is not in control over the memory in my app. Alas.\nAnother couple of options:\n\nA big boolean flag saying \"DISABLE ALLOCATION POOLS\" \nAn API I can call that says \"FLUSH ALLOCATION POOLS NOW\"\n\nEither of these would fix my problems without exposing the internals. (I'd personally take the hit of just relying on the GC more heavily over accidentally permanently consuming large blocks of memory.(. Some comments:\n\n\nAWS backs you up on the \"CPU is harder to get\" front-- getting dedicated CPU appears to be relatively more expensive than getting dedicated RAM.\n\n\nDo you really need to keep the entire image decoded as a Vector4 all the way through? Aren't there naturally independent blocks in JPEG that you can work in?\n\n\nAre you sure it will be faster to just have Vector4 everywhere? On large images, will it be faster to work in cache-sized chunks, so that expensive main memory only really sees your packed data?\n. Oh, and I still would like control over the buffer pool policy since its current maximum size and pool size policies are not what I actually want to run with. (Given the resources I have, allocating a 20MB buffer for an 11MB request is not practical.). \n\n",

Yep the differences for pixels is slight, however for image processing targeted applications, these slight differences may also have a huge effect.

Both are special adobe bitmap headers which contain the color masks. . @JimBobSquarePants: actually OS22XBITMAPHEADER headers are partially supported. The compression types RLE4, RLE8 and uncompressed are supported. RLE24 and 1D Huffman is not supported.. i have noticed, that this seems to happen only on linux (at least i have not seen this on windows yet). Also only in Release mode. Never seen this in Debug mode so far. \nWeird thing is really that it only happens occasionally, not always. So i was expecting some kind of race condition, because the tests are run in parallel, but changing the xunit config to: \n\"maxParallelThreads\": 1,           \n\"parallelizeAssembly\": false,      \n\"parallelizeTestCollections\": false\nand its still happens some times. Even running only the test CloneAs_ToBgr24 produces the error. I still suspect some race condition, because of parallel execution, but its not because other tests are running at the same time. \nI have noticed, that when it fails, its every time the value in the B channel which is wrong. \nI suspect the ParallelFor in CloneAs is causing this, but i could not pinpoint exactly where the error is. Setting the ParallelOptions.MaxDegreeOfParallelism to 1 reliable makes the test run successfully. \nWhat i do not get is why this is not happening to CloneAs_ToRgb24. It uses the same CloneAs method.. i do not think anymore there is an issue in ParallelFor. I think it has to do with memory alignment of the bgr24 struct. If i change it to explicit and field offsets 0, 1, 2 accordingly to b, g , r, this issue does not happen anymore. \nI am not sure why LayoutKind.Sequential produces a different result than this explicit one.. i have opened a PR for this: https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/pull/591\nI have changed rgb24 also, because it may also be affected by this. \nIm not sure if Rgba32 and Argb32 can be affected by this.. you should ask those questions at: https://gitter.im/ImageSharp/General \nand not open a ticket for that. Hi Anton and James,  \ni have tried to figure out this issue and it seems similar to #576, because it fails also only in Release build not on debug. \nOne difference between Debug and Release is AggressiveInlining, so i thought i might give it a try and disable it and indeed disabling it in NormalizedShort4, Short4, NormalizedByte4  on the method ToByteScaledVector4 seems to fix this issue. \nI can not completely explain yet why this AggressiveInlining at that specific method is causing it. I found some similar issue: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/21323\nbut this is windows and not linux (on windows this does not happen again)\nI could provide an PR, if you think disabling AggressiveInlining on this specific method is a viable workaround for this.. i have started working on refactoring the PackedPixelTests. Hopefully this will help to find the real cause of this strange issue.. i have good news and bad news. The good news is, i think i am done with the refactoring: https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/pull/603\nthe bad news: Splitting up the tests in smaller chunks, makes the issue go away. \nEven changing the original Unit Test just a little bit makes the issue either go away or another Assert to fail. My attempt to create a smaller Reproduction of this failed, because of this.\nI could not find the real issue of this and i am of out of ideas here. I hope the refactoring is still helpful. edit i might have done something wrong here, sry. The changes from you @JimBobSquarePants, are not ment to be in here.\nMaybe its time for me to go to sleep. I close this now .... @tocsoft yes indeed that would be better. I will change that.. @tocsoft travis seems to fail with: \nThe command \"sudo apt-get install -qq dotnet-sdk-2.1.300-rc1-008673\" failed and exited with 100 during .\nI guess this will be fixed if i change the travis file from dotnet: 2.1.300-rc1-008673 to  dotnet: 2.1.300. \n2.1.300 was released 3 days ago. \nI am not sure if that would fix it, i am not familiar with travis.\nIs it ok, if i give it a try?. seems to have worked :-). i thought i may have made a mistake during refactoring and double checked the original and the refactored version. As far as i can tell, the tests before and after refactoring should be the same. \nI did not notice this, because i always tested with netcoreapp2.0. \nThis failing tests are not new. I checked the current master branch. The tests in Rgba64 is skipped in the PackedPixelTests, thats why it was not noticed.\nThis time this issue seems to be at least reproducable in Debug and Release mode.. @antonfirsov, @JimBobSquarePants:  i think i have found the reason for the rgba64 tests failing. \nIt happens when build with x86 and with net462/net471. \nIn the Constructor of Rgba64  rounding is applied after multiplying the value with 65535. The test values for the B-Channel which was failing was 0.30f. Multiplying by 65535 leads to 19660,5. Rounding this should be 19660, but for net462/net471 this gives 19661.\nhere is a simple reproduction, which mimics what happens in the RGBA Constructor:\n```\n[Fact]\npublic void Rgba64_Rounding_Test()\n{\n    var b = 0.30f;\nulong actual = (ulong)System.Math.Round(b * 65535F);\n\nAssert.Equal(19660UL, actual);\n\n}\n```\ni think this is maybe an edge case for float not being able to represent decimal values accurately enough. . @tocsoft my suggestion would be: changing the rgba64 constructor to use double instead of float. This would fix this issue. That does not mean there are no such edge cases with double too, but its at least much more unlikely.. i must admit, i have rushed too fast to a conclusion yesterday. It is not actually a float issue. \nThe error comes from converting to double actually (which is implicit done in Round).\nHere is a simple example to illustrate this \nvar b = 0.30f;\nvar foo = b * 65535F;\nvar bar = (double)(b * 65535F);\nThis results in x86 to \nfoo = 19660,5\nbar = 19660,5007812381\nWhich explains why Round gives 19661 for that. \nThere is a simple fix for that. Im just using MathF.Round from Sixlabors.Core. \nThis will cast the expression z.Clamp(0, 1) * 65535F to float before rounding.. There is still one test failing Rgba32_ToRgb24. This is some special kind of snowflake. \nIf you look at the assertion: \nExpected: (0,0,128)\nActual:   (26,0,128)\nBut if you look into the testcase, the expected value is: var expected = new Rgb24(0x1a, 0, 0x80);, which is exactly the actual value. No clue yet why this assert is failing.... This issue with Rgba32_ToRgb24 seems to happen only in Release Mode again (just for the record). I could not find the real cause of it. \nThe best thing i have got is a workaround, which changes the assertion slightly: assert workaround\nThis workaround seems to indicate that the Equals in Rgb24 is maybe the issue, but im very sure there is no mistake in it. My best guess is, that this is some IL code generation issue, but i have no experience in debugging those kind of issues.. @antonfirsov net462/net471 at least. I suspect this issue only happens on x86, but that's just a guess. I could not test it on netcore2.0 x86 yet. . @iamcarbon yes you can, i have tried it in a different branch already\nedit: i have tried it with Anton's permission, of course. i have started to work on this. \nAs the png EXIF is basically defined as: \"it should be the same as in JPG\", i was able to use the existing ExifReader. Encoding and Decoding seems to work in my first attempt.. @JimBobSquarePants i tried to follow your suggestions, can you please review the changes and see if that's how you wanted it to be. \nAlso any suggestions for more / better unit tests are welcome.. @JimBobSquarePants would think an adaptive histogram equalization could be a useful feature for imagesharp? I think it can produce much better results then the global histogram equalization in some cases.  \nI have hacked together a first rough version in in ImageSharp. Here is an example result where is works pretty good: \n\n(note: click on the image to see it in full size, the preview does not look correct)\nLet me know, if you think that this is something you would like to have for imagesharp, then i would look further into it.\n . closing in favor of #668. > I'd like to see if we can do anything to improve this as the output is incredible!\n@JimBobSquarePants: I am glad you like it. I will try to improve it, but i think the main reason why this approach is slow, is that the distribution function needs to be calculated for each pixel and with 65k grey levels, thats a lot to chew on. \nThere is a different approach to this: The image would be split into n tiles dependent on how big the gridsize is chosen. For each tile the cdf is pre-calculated. Now the final grey level would be calculated by interpolating between 4 adjacent tiles. This approach should be in theory much faster.\nI will give this a try over the next week and see how it goes.. I have implemented the tile interpolation approach and it is indeed much faster. Even with 65536 grey levels it now takes around 500 ms to compute. \nHere is an example output: \n\nIts still pretty much a work in progress, but i think its going in the right direction. I have still some issues to fix. I need to figure out howto deal with the borders and i think im still doing something wrong with the interpolation. If a small gridsize is choosen like 32, the tile edges seem to be too bright and it looks kind of blocky. Here is an example:\n\n. @JimBobSquarePants just a quick update: i did not had much time last week to work on this. I hope i find some time this weekend to continue with it.. @JimBobSquarePants:\ni am sorry that it took me so long, i could not find much time to work on this. I think im done now and its ready for a review.\nI kept the sliding window approach in even if its slow, because it can produce better quality results than the tile interpolation in some cases.\nFor people who do not care so much about speed, i think its a good option.\nFor the timings it looks now like this on my machine for a 1000x797 pixel image (using 10 tiles):\nfor 256 grey levels:\n- ahe tile interpolation: 72 ms\n- ahe sliding window: 661 ms\nfor 65536 grey levels:\n- ahe tile interpolation: 84 ms\n- ahe sliding window: 25756 ms\nI could not come up with any useful unit tests so far. Let me know if you have any suggestions.. sure, here are the results from the different approaches. The input image is the one i posted first as a example image.: \nSliding winow: \n\ntile  interpolation:\n\nWhy i think its not a bug, but a limitation of the algorithm is that the output from opencv looks pretty much the same:\n\nI think the difference between the opencv result and mine it the clipping of the histogram. I think they do the clipping slightly different than i do. \ni used the following options: \n- LuminanceLevels = 65536,\n- Tiles = 30,\n- ClipHistogram = true\n. I wanted to clarify, that this blocky effect will only be visible, if a large tile number is chosen. In the above case a tile number of 30 would lead to tiles with a pixel width of 84, which is very small. Those small tiles work well with the sliding window approach, but with the tile interpolation, it has this blocky effect.\nA more reasonable choice would be 12 tiles for example. Here is how that will look for the tile interpolation mode:\n\n. @JimBobSquarePants: dont worry, take as much time as you want.. @JimBobSquarePants: Thats awesome, great job!\nI will change the sliding window to go by row instead of columns.. The sliding window is now moved from left to right. Unfortunately it seems there is a 5% difference to the reference image now. The output looks ok, though. I will look into this again on the WE.. I found one issue with the latest changes, which was: I unintended changed the tile width calculation. This is now changed back to as it was before.\nUnfortunately there is still a difference of 1.5 % which i have problems identifying where they come from.\nIt should not matter if the sliding window is move from left to right or from top to bottom. Both should produce the same result (should to state the obvious).. @JimBobSquarePants:\nOne optimization was, that i keep track of the maximum position of an entry in the histogram. The idea was, that for the calculation of the lookup table, we would not need to access all histogram values. I kind of suspect that this is not working as intended, but i cannot really see why.\nI am tempted to remove this optimization, because im unsure if its working correctly. For 256 grey values this would not make much of a difference, but for 65536 it would add like 25% time on top.. @JimBobSquarePants: I have removed this keeping track of the histogram position now.\nWe need to change the reference image, because it was created with this possible wrong optimization step.\nI have compared the left to right vs. top to bottom approach without the keeping track of the histogram position step. The difference is still not 0, but much better then before: Total difference: 0,0976%.\nIn the borders/corners of the image there are very small differences.\nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/Imagesharp.Tests.Images/pull/7. just for reference here are the difference for top/bottom vs left/right:\nleft/right:\n\ntop/bottom:\n\n. @JimBobSquarePants:\n\n\nMirroring the edges is the best way i know to deal with the borders of the image where there is no data. I do not understand exactly what you mean by reusing the edge pixels. Can you point me to an example source code line where this is done in th resizer?\n\n\nWe now move the window from left to right. This means when we move one pixel, we need to remove one column from the left and add another on the right. When i was moving the window from top to bottom i could read a row (with the size of the window) when moving one pixel down, but you said this is not a good idea.\nMaybe i do not understand exactly what you mean or you see something i do not see here, but when moving the window from left to right we need to read a column when moving the window.\n\n\nIm sorry that i could not be more helpful here.. @JimBobSquarePants:\n\nok i understand now what you mean, but we can not do that. That would over amplify the edge pixels in the border. The edge pixels would be added multiple times to the histogram, worst case is the corners of the image where it would lead adding the same value as often as the window width.\n\nOne other option is to just ignore the pixels outside of the image and do not add them. Im not sure, if that a good idea either. I have to try that and see how it looks.\nAnother option i have found is here: https://digitalcommons.unf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.de/&httpsredir=1&article=1264&context=etd\nSee Section Image Border, Page 26.\nThey suggest to keep the window in place in the corners (what i call window, they call contextual region)\nI think that sounds like a good alternative, but im not sure at the moment, if this will be better in performance than the mirroring approach.\n\nMoving the sliding window around the image is comparable to other filtering methods, where you apply one filter mask to a region around a pixel. Lets say like a Sobel filter, but here the mask / window / contextual region is a bit bigger (typically something like 64 by 64 pixels). This window needs to be moved over each pixel. It does not matter if its from left to right or from top to bottom, but it needs to be moved over all pixels. \nAll pixels which are covered by the window needs to be added to the histogram. To not add all pixels under the window to the histogram again when you move one pixel, you only have to add one column to the right and remove one column from the left (if you move from left to right). \n\nHere is an example image, maybe that makes it clearer:\n\nIf you we move the window from top to bottom, which was the case in the commit you pointed out, we would add one row on the bottom and remove one from the top.\nI hope this makes it a bit clearer, let me know if you have still any questions. \nUnfortunately i think i will not find time to continue with this in this week. Maybe i can find some time next week.\n. @JimBobSquarePants: ok, so we should keep mirroring and switch back to moving the window from top to bottom? I will do that, if you agree to this.. i have just noticed that resizing is indeed important for this to happen. Without resizing the bitmap is correct, so i do not think its a bug in the decoder.. @wc-matteo: would you mind sharing the image here again? The drop box link does not work anymore. Just attaching it to this ticket would be helpful to reproduce it.. @roelgeusens: The picture has actually a width of 4032 and a height of 3024, so imagesharp shows it correctly to you. The image also contains EXIF informations which hold the orientation information. Most Image viewing programs automatically rotate the image by the EXIF information. \nIf you want to auto rotate the image by EXIF information with ImageSharp, use the following: \nimage.Mutate(img => img.AutoOrient());. @JimBobSquarePants: maybe you can help me here, i think i am missing something obvious. \nI wanted to create a unit test which verifies the Decoded bitmap with reference bitmap, which was added yesterday. \n[Theory]\n[WithFile(WinBmpv2, PixelTypes.Rgba32)]\npublic void BmpDecoder_CanDecodeBmpv2<TPixel>(TestImageProvider<TPixel> provider)\n    where TPixel : struct, IPixel<TPixel>\n{\n        using (Image<TPixel> image = provider.GetImage(new BmpDecoder()))\n    {\n        // TODO: how to compare to the reference?\n    }\n}\nI think i need to use CompareToReferenceOutput from the TestImageExtension, but i am unsure howto do it correctly.\nCan you point me to an example where i can see how i should use it.. @JimBobSquarePants thank you for the clarification! \nThe image i have added to the submodul was a bitmap with 40 bytes header which imagesharp can already decode. I wanted to use that as a reference. \nSaving the image as png and then comparing to System.Drawing makes much more sense, then the stunt i wanted to do :-) . So the image i have added to the submodul can be safely deleted. Sorry for this misunderstanding.\nI have added now two tests. One for decoding a windows BMPv2 and to make sure decoding images with a palette of 4 bytes per entry still works, another one for that case.. unfortunately that does not work either. System.Drawing can not decode this bitmap. \nedit: works on windows, but not on ubuntu.. @JimBobSquarePants: thank you! I am happy, that i could help a bit.. I think this one is ready for review now. \nOne note about the 16 Bits per pixel case: only bit masks with 5 or 6 bits are supported, because according to: http://www.fileformat.info/format/bmp/egff.htm. Windows 95 only supports the RGB555 and RGB565 pixel types. Bitmaps with other bitmasks may be theoretically possible, but i do not really think they can be found in the wild.. @JimBobSquarePants: Thank you! \nWe are getting close to be able to decode all bitmaps from the \"good\" category from: http://entropymine.com/jason/bmpsuite/bmpsuite/html/bmpsuite.html\nOnly RLE4 is left now. I will do that next.. @JimBobSquarePants: you are welcome. good point, i missed that one. I have added a unit test for that case.. i have changed that. i have changed that. \nI am not sure if its jpeg specific or other formats which support Exif also use this. I only can tell for sure that PNG does not use it. Maybe @dlemstra knows more about this?. ok, i will do that on the weekend.. im not sure about this one, i think this was supposed to return null, if only the Exif Id code is present. Is that correct?. no we do not need them, i have removed it again. i have added the SyncProfile before writing the chunk. \nFor the length check: I could add a check, if the length exceeds 2^16, like the JpegEncoder does, and throw an exception, but that feels wrong to me. This restriction is Jpeg specific not PNG specific. \nIn the recommendations they state, when writing PNG Exif to Jpeg: \n\nthe total length of the eXIf chunk data may need to be adjusted\n\nBut how to decide what to cut off here is not clear to me. I really would like to hear @dlemstra opinion on that.. i have changed that. im using MemoryAllocator now, please check if im using it correctly.. removed this allocation, its not necessary, using the cdf array instead . yes and i see no good way around this. \nFirst i need to access all pixels to calculate the histogram. \nAfter that i need the luminance of each pixel again to remap it to the new value.. ah nice, i did not know that. i have changed that. i am using now vector4, but still i need to determine how many gray levels there are with the pixel type, because i need that to create the histogram.. it is important for the algorithm to know how many possible grey levels there are. If the input image only has 256 possible grey levels, creating a histogram with 65536 would not change the quality of the outcome. \nThe algorithm just maps each input grey level to a new output grey level with the goal to use all possible grey values equally. For example the picture i have attached to this PR has only grey values of 120 to 200. After the equalization it uses the the complete range from 0 to 256, but the total number of different grey levels will not change after the equalization. \nhere is the histogram of the input image: \n\nand after the equalization:\n\n. ok, i understand now your reasoning why you do not want pixel type related code in the processor. \nThe luminance levels is now a parameter of the constructor as you suggested.\n. yes i think you are right, it feels a bit odd. This is jpeg specific and should be handled by the encoder/decoder. while this extending is also something jpeg specific and therefore should be handled by the decoder, i could not figure out a way to change it without making it more complicated. The problem is, that we do not know in advance how many APP1 marker there will be for very large EXIF data.  . i have removed the unnecessary comments . @dlemstra: i have moved the extending of the exif data to the jpeg decoder now, please let me know if you think this is a viable solution.. fixed. In this case the image has an alpha channel of 2 bits. In many cases, the value is 3 which should be remapped to 255 for RGBA32. The magick decoder reports a value of 191 in those cases, which i think is wrong. \nIm not sure about the other difference of 0,0204% if the alpha channel is ignored. I cannot see a mistake on my side, but that does not mean there is none. \nIf i choose the System Drawing decoder as a reference, the difference on windows is 1.1029%\nAnd on ubuntu 6.0%, again something with the alpha channel looks wrong here. Thats why i choose the magick decoder as a reference. At least its the same on linux and windows.. ok, done.. im not sure if i understand you correctly. The Encoder writes a 40 bytes bitmap info header now as it was before. There is no support for alpha values with the bitmap info header V3. If we want to support a alpha channel, we need to write a V4 header, but also the encoding needs to be changed. I think thats a bigger change and should be part of a different PR. \nIm not sure what you mean by V3 ICO variant. I know that OS/2 has Color Icon and a Icon variant, but imagesharp does not yet support OS/2 header (64 bytes) yet.\nI have added a enum for the info header type and added it to the BmpMetaData. Can you re-check, if i am using this correctly? The BmpMetaData seems to be not used yet as far as i can tell.. I have loaded this image with GIMP, exported it as PNG and compared to my results. It produces the same results as i have, including the alpha channel, which gives me more confidence, that it is correct. I could add this to the ReferenceOutput and compare against it, if you like.. yes only the names changed, i wanted to make it clear, that a V3 header is written.\nThis V3 ICO variant was new to me. I could not find much about it, except the mozilla comment you mentioned. \nMy understanding is, that a V3 header implies, no support for alpha channel. As you mentioned in the other ticket, what you called Option 2 could be a way to solve this, but it feels a bit hacky to me.\nI think a better way to support a alpha channel would be to write a V4 header with BITFIELDS compression to indicate which bits are really the alpha channel.. The encoder now writes V4 header. \nI wanted to add rgb32.bmp to the list of testimages for the decoder, but this failed, because of the issue described in #732 that alpha channel is not correctly decoded. This image is a bitmap with a V3 header, but no alpha channel. In the info header it is marked as a 32 bpp image, but the alpha values are all 0, meaning no alpha channel is there. As a consequence the encoder would encode images with v3 header wrong, because it expects there an alpha channel for 32 bpp images.\nAs a temporary workaround i have ignored the alpha channel during encoding, when its a V3 header. This should be removed once #732 is fixed properly. I have also disabled rgb32.bmp from the decoder tests, until #732 is fixed.. Yes they are in this implementation. The OpenCV implementation provides the option to choose the number of tiles in X direction and in Y-Direction, but i cannot see a real usecase where this could be beneficial.. ",

    "chausner": "I remain convinced that the current way how components read from streams is incorrect and should be avoided. While it may \"work in practice\" in 99% of all cases, it is still wrong. I am not sure if any changes have been made since I reported this issue but last time I checked, ImageSharp would not recognize invalid, truncated images, for example, due to exactly that issue.\n\nAs @blackcity correctly states, it's not our responsibility to handle network streams.\nNo other graphics library would be expected to either.\n\nIf an API accepts reading data from streams (accepting a Stream object) and there is no further clarifying documentation, I would expect it to accept any type of stream that correctly implements the Stream contract, including NetworkStream. It doesn't matter if its a graphics library or something different.\nThe idea of the abstract Stream class is to allow APIs to support reading from arbitrary types of data sources, whether the data comes from a file, memory or the network. There is no reason not to support NetworkStreams if you just depend on the generic Stream contract and not on behaviour of specific subclasses like FileStream. And if you must depend on it, you should accept FileStream objects in the first place, not generic streams.\n. Instead of internally copying non-seekable streams to a MemoryStream, why not simply throw an exception when CanSeek is false? Let the API caller be responsible for passing a seekable stream to ImageSharp. If the caller has a non-seekable stream, they can decide themselves whether to copy synchronously or asynchronously to a MemoryStream first.. ",

That's why, I just jump in to the point where problem is exists. However, I didn't modify the related part and when i test it with the current version on github, problem is still there. I said while croping / resizing because my code is joined the load and the resize together. I thought it was an encoding problem but when i check deeper, I realised that it is decoding problem actually. \n\nThanks.... It is just aimed purposes modifications. If you apply what I did to your code, you will break the usability. I'm chopping, removing, skipping and it is making fast but it is not okay for everyone this kind of customization. Otherwise, sure I'll share or advice my code like how I report an Issue ;) That's why, keep calm dude, I'm also open source supporter and developer...\nI'll provide a test image soon..

It may also help you to decide if it is a major problem or not...\nOne last thing; I'm opening a file stream of the image file and try to load it from that stream.. Honestly, I'm not expecting to open the image or process it. If the application can throw an exception other than getting into an infinite loop, will be the correct behavior because It is clearly a bug. The explanation of the change that I did in the code is; \nwhen the result return on this line\nerrorCode = this.Bytes.FillUnsafe(this.InputStream);\nerrorCode becomes UnexpectedEndOfStream. While there is an UnexpectedEndOfStream error on decoding, I don't see any logic about trying to continue to decode process. But somehow, it continues and that creates an infinite loop. \nDo not consider that, I want to open it or trying to process something on this image. The image is already trash for me, I just need to continue to my process with the following ones but that infinite loop is locking my operation....   \nGuys, I can not know your codes better than you. I just did a hotfix for myself and saved the day. I am just obligated to report the issue. You can discuss between you and find the best way to fix it. I already like what you are doing and appreciate that you make it open source.

    "clausjensen": "\nAuthorization afaik shouldn't be ImageSharp's concern. You would plug in your authorization middleware before the ImageSharp.Web one and that would be responsible for handling anything authz-wise. . Just adding this here for anyone wanting to get started: https://gist.github.com/clausjensen/bce60ccad6d65a92eadb4ea77229b287. Aaah awesome :) I didn't know how far you were on the basic middleware stuff but looks like you're already ahead of that!. @KLuuKer That would still not be the responsibility of ImageSharp.Web - that would be something you handle in your authorization middleware. ImageSharp should simply be responsible for handling requests that have already passed through any authorization middleware that may/may not allow the request to continue being handled.. @KLuuKer actually I think it may be a good idea to create a whole other issue just to talk about the multi tenancy stuff, as I'm pretty certain there's a lot of things in regards to how caching should/could be done and how caching can best be configured for these kind of setups.\n\nI'm a bit worried notes and ideas like these may get lost if not separated out into an issue focused just on this part. Unfortunately it is not something I know that much about so I suspect there's a lot of potential pitfalls here we might as well get addressed to begin with. ( @JimBobSquarePants ?). Agree with @andrewlock on the points mentioned. There's also some limitations to what you have available when configuring (without injecting weird things around in places they shouldn't be and jumping through hoops) if you don't go with this route - so whether or not it's a personal preference (and mine too) .. I believe it's actually also the most appropriate way of initializing it \ud83d\ude03\nVery nice work so far @JimBobSquarePants . ",
    "lfoust": "I think a good place to start in designing the middleware is to determine what the inputs to the middleware would be and how those come into the request (query string, headers, etc). Also what are the possible operations (is it just for resizing or are there other processing operations supported?)\nIt would be great if the mapping between the inputs and how they make it to the middleware was configurable so that people can use whatever routing or conventions they want and the image middleware would handle the heavy lifting.\nFor example, some inputs for resizing could be:\n - Width - this would likely come from the url\n - Height - this would likely come from the url\n - Quality - this would likely come from the url\n - Format - this could come from an accept header on the request\n - Focal Point - this would likely come from the url\nAre there any existing image services or plugins that have functionality you would like to incorporate? Are there any standards around such services?\nComing up with some sample scenarios like:\n/images?w=100&h=250&q=.8\n/images/100/250/.8\nand walking through how the request would flow would be a great exercise. Also including caching and authentication/authorization in these scenarios will help spell out how those pieces interact.\nAnother big consideration in the design is making sure the response is property formatted to be consumed by a CDN.

    "andrewlock": "@JimBobSquarePants been checking out out the code, and it's a good start \ud83d\udc4d \nPersonally there's a few things I would probably design differently, but that may just be my preference as opposed to actually better!\nThe main thing that I would change is the way the services are created. They are currently all added on the ImageSharpMiddlewareOptions object in the UseImageSharp call. That seems like it limits you quite a lot, and means you have to pass IHostingEnvironment etc in all the APIs. \nI would add these into the DI container so that you can use DI throughout instead. Then you would have an AddImageSharpMiddleware() extension method to register all the defaults, and users can easily plugin their own implementations using DI. You can obviously register the default implementations as  singletons, so shouldn't be any performance differences. This is the biggest change I'd make, and it's more in-line with standard ASP.NET Core approaches. I can knock up a PR to discuss if you like \ud83d\ude42 \nOn other things: the Commands infrastructure looks cool, but the URL/querystring matching design is very opinionated, potentially too much? I personally like the idea of essentially having a service for extracting the required parameters width=200, height=100 etc, rather than forcing them to be querystrings. For example I might want to use routing values: /resize/{width}/{height}/{path} for example. \nBut yeah, looking good \ud83d\ude42  I've got a blog post I started as a follow up the caching one, storing files in the wwwroot which seems  pretty close to what we're doing here (though less extensible). I'll try and get it finished off soon, and see if there's anything in there that's applicable here!. @JimBobSquarePants I pushed a quick update to a fork here which changes the DI design a bit - this is more what I had in mind https://github.com/andrewlock/ImageSharp/tree/dotweb\nWith this setup, users can easily create new implementations, and have arbitrary services injected into them. This is more the style most ASP.NET Core infrastructure is going - the \"services on an options\" object is a bit limiting in a lot of cases, so there's a general push away from it I think. The way I've written it, everything is just injected into the constructors. \nThis is just a demo, not expecting you to merge them! \nThere's a couple of bits I would want to think about too: \n Consider renaming IImageService to IImageProvider or something more descriptive\n Consider other matching scenarios than a simple prefix to the URL. That's pretty restrictive.. You could just make the Key property on IImageWebProcessor a Func<HttpContext, bool> and that would satisfy a lot of requirements. In particular, you could leverage routing, rather than effectively using a slightly hobbled version of it (prefix only) here. \n* Consider separate Options objects for the web processors. E.g. you may want to restrict the number of sizes that can be resized. \nThat's it I think, nice work on getting it written up so quickly btw!. Excellent, this is cleaning up nicely!  IImageResolver is a much better name, the lambda works well, and OnValidate looks like it will do the job nicely \ud83d\udc4d \nWRT the TODO note in my branch, that's due to the way I am adding services, and the difference between TryAddSingleton and TryAddEnumerable. Both overloads I've shown there will always add all the default services - that way you know the middleware always has a valid set of services - but there's not a 1st class way of users to remove the registered enumerables.\nThe TryAddSingleton methods work well because we only ever want a single instance of the IImageCache etc, If the user adds a registers an instance of IImageCache before calling AddImageSharp then our method will not add the default PhysicalFileSystemCache. If the user calls AddImageSharp first, the PhysicalFileSystemCache will be registered initially, but when they register a new IImageCache instance, it will effectively overwrite the default.\nTryAddEnumerable is fundamentally different. It just ensures we can't register the sameResizeWebProcessor` image twice, it doesn't mean 'add this if no others have been added'. \nA simple fix would be to have an overload that doesn't register these services by default. Additionally you could create a simple ImageSharpBuillder (similar to the MvcBuilder they use to configure MVC services. Then you could have a usage that looks something like this: \n```C#\npublic void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)\n{\n    services.Use(); // register a custom IUriParser\nservices.AddImageSharp()  //Add the default IImageCache and IUriParser\n    .AddResizeWebProcessor()\n    .AddPhysicalFileImageResolver();\n\nservices.Use<IImageCache, AzureImageCache>(); //register a custom IImageCache\nservices.Use<IImageProcessor, GrayscaleProcessor>(); //add an additional processor\n\n}\n```\nThe fluent builder style is similar to the config interface for things like EF Core and IdentityServer, so could be nice, but might be a bit overkill at this stage. . Nice, that looks way nicer \ud83d\ude04 The only I would probably tweak is to make the SetCache methods etc use the full AddSingleton etc methods, rather than the TryAddSingleton methods. If you're explicitly using the SetCache methods then it might be confusing for the service you register to not acually be registered.\nShaping up nicely! \ud83d\ude04  . ",
    "sebastienros": "What would be the behavior with regards to CDN storage or Azure Blobs. I understand that they would just act as \"caches\" meaning the local web application would still have to load the content and serve it, hence invalidating the CDN part of it?\nA strategy I intend to implement instead, even though I would love to reuse something existing, would be to have urls generated from server side. So clients couldn't forge them. Upon url generation, the file is checked, and generated if it doesn't exist. Or it's existence is cached if it exists.\nPros:\n- No DOS vector, as the resource is only generated from a server call (HTML helper, tag helper, service call, ...)\n- The generated url points to an existing resource, anywhere it's stored. It can be a locally served image, or one pointing to Azure for example. Our server would never process anything to serve the image.\n- If the original image changes, the url can change providing the hash or timestamp is part of the generated filename.\nCons:\n- Clients can't forge a url without server side code.

    "TodesBrot": "@antonfirsov I haven't managed to get an emulator to work yet, but I could try to investigate the bug. I'm not that well versed in graphics programming though, so I can't promise anything.. @JimBobSquarePants I've totally forgotten about this, so I haven't investigted anything. I'm still having trouble getting an emulator to work, but I've confirmed that the bug still happens with the current beta release of ImageSharp.. After way too much time, I finally got Mono working on Windows. The bug occurs on Windows too when using Mono, so it is a framework issue rather than a platform one.\n@KLuuKer I have confirmed that this is purely a decoding issue. The bottom rows are still missing when saved as a BMP file.. I edited the PncDecoderCore code so that every time it tries to process a chunk, the chunk type gets written to the console. On .NET this results in the output \"IHDR, IDAT, IDAT, IEND\", but on Mono between the last IDAT and IEND, it tries to process 686 chunks with the type null. These chunks all have random lengths, such as -1763762839 or 1856068475. The amount of chunks, 686, also corresponds with the length of the last IDAT chunk, which is also 686.\nIt seems the bug happens when reading the last IDAT chunk. After reading this chunk, the position of the deframeStream is different between Mono and .NET. On .NET the position is 8935, and on Mono it is 8249. The difference is yet again 686.\nRight after calling this.ReadScanlines when processing data chunks, the variable currentRow has different values between Mono and .NET. On .NET, the values are 540 and 560 for the two IDAT chunks, whereas on Mono both values are 542.. @JimBobSquarePants I can confirm that the bug is gone now. Works like a charm! Great work!. I just noticed the second GIF file also appears to be faster than the first one.. @JimBobSquarePants I have noticed some weird behavior. When I create a new project and load the image, it loads just fine, but in my old project it has the buggy output. However, if I move the line that loads and saves the file to the beginning of the project, it works fine. It seems like something in my project changes something somewhere that causes the bug to occur. I'll have to do some more investigating.. @JimBobSquarePants Okay, now this is a weird one. Loading this specific image:\n\nand saving it again before loading the GIF leads to the corruption shown above. Additionally, loading it and not saving it beforehand leads to a different corruption.\nCode example: (The GIF is called \"Kumin.gif\" here, and the image above is called \"Icon.png\")\n```\nImage.Load(\"Kumin.gif\").Save(\"Kumin ImageSharp 1.gif\");\nImage icon = Image.Load(\"Icon.png\");\nImage.Load(\"Kumin.gif\").Save(\"Kumin ImageSharp 2.gif\");\nicon.SaveAsPng(new MemoryStream());\nImage.Load(\"Kumin.gif\").Save(\"Kumin ImageSharp 3.gif\");\n```\nKumin ImageSharp 1.gif looks just fine:\n\nKumin ImageSharp 2.gif has purple corruptions:\n\nKumin ImageSharp 3.gif has the blue corruptions from my first post:\n\nNote: The GIF file has to be loaded again each time, as the corruptions occur during the decoding, not the encoding.\n. It seems like loading and saving any 256x256 image causes this bug. I created one with only blue and green stripes in it, and it caused blue and green stripes to appear.. I haven't been able to reproduce the bug on Windows using Mono, I have only managed to reproduce it on Android and using the Linux subsystem on Windows. As for @dlemstra, installing Xamarin Studio on Ubuntu should be the easiest option. I can't actually help you beyond that though, as I only develop on Windows.. @dlemstra That should work too, depending on the libraries you use. Most of Windows.Forms works on Mono too, in case you want to use it.. This is probably related, I found out that the image below can't get decoded on Mono, it throws \"System.NotSupportedException: Image cannot be loaded.\"\n. @JimBobSquarePants ...You're right, stupid error on my part.

    "JulianRooze": "Some feedback on this: we currently use ImageSharp for all our image resizing needs in a cloud application and the optimization of speed over memory usage seems to run counter to the idea of horizontal scaling, because of how it holds onto memory. We'd like to provision many containers with a 2 GB memory limit, but currently if we do that, we'd end up with all those containers using 2 GB all of the time. Currently, we run only a few containers limited to 4 GB and they frequently get OOM killed by Docker, even though I already limited image resizing concurrency. This high memory usage seems to be mostly caused by a few outliers in image sizes, most images we process are in the 500 KB range, but some are 10-20 MB, which then consumes 500+ MB of memory just to decode that gets cached indefinitely. Do that concurrently and memory quickly starts to climb to 2-4 GB which never gets released. \nFrom this issue, I can tell you're working on making it configurable and pluggable, but it sounds like a lot of very fundamental work and somewhat long-term. Is there any chance you would accept a more short term quick-fix? Correct me if I'm wrong here, but from what I can tell, most of our memory usage comes from the caching of Block8x8 which is done by the Jpeg decoder, and the memory is provided by the PixelDataPool. If you were to add properties to Configuration that allowed you to set the maxArrayLength / maxArraysPerBucker that get passed to ArrayPool.Create, you could turn off/tweak array pooling for a common scenario. \nSomething like:\nConfiguration.Default.Memory.PixelDataPool.MaxArrayLength = 0;\nConfiguration.Default.Memory.PixelDataPool.MaxArrays = 0;\nI understand that this would expose some internal implementation details, but I think (haven't tried it yet, might later) it would also solve some real issues.\n  . @antonfirsov Thanks for the quick reply! No that's not late at all, much sooner than I expected it to be completed \ud83d\udc4d \nAnd in the meantime the PoolConfiguration class would be a very welcome addition. \nLimiting MaximumExpectedImageSize would also help, but the effect would be smaller as Block8x8 buffers seem to make up the majority of cached buffers (at least in our use case of decompress JPEG > resize > encode as JPEG). \nThis is the cached memory after resizing a large (20 MB, 8000x5000) JPEG concurrently (5 at a time) in a loop:\n\n. @antonfirsov yes, we're running beta-2. It's a rather extreme image though, at 8000x5000. . I haven't worked with Span<T> yet, but doesn't it have the limitation of a stack-only type? Meaning, the compiler won't let you have an IBuffer<T> interface that exposes a Span<T> because it would be stored on the heap and Span<T> could be a wrapper around stack allocated bytes. You can only return it from methods or inside value types that are also stack only. But I could be wrong here, that's just what I remember reading.. @vpenades I think Memory<T> is supposed to serve that purpose:\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/corefxlab/blob/master/docs/specs/memory.md. An update on our situation:\nI created a custom NuGet package of ImageSharp where I introduced that PoolConfiguration that @antonfirsov suggested as a workaround (but ultimately decided not to pursue) and configured it as such:\ncsharp\nPoolConfiguration.MaximumPooledBufferSize = 100_000;\nPoolConfiguration.MaxArrayCount = 10;\nThe values were arbitrarily chosen, but this seems to work well for us, idle memory use is never over 500 MB. The containers still regularly get killed by Docker for exceeding 4GB, but that now has more to do with the CoreCLR being reluctant about running GC than about ImageSharp memory pooling. When I manually run GC on a container that's high memory (I added a query parameter to force a GC or a LOH compact \ud83d\ude05), it drops right back to a few hundred MB. If I were to disable memory pooling entirely, then I'm sure it would fall back to 10 MB or so. \nThe package can be found here:\nhttps://www.myget.org/feed/newblack-public/package/nuget/SixLabors.ImageSharp.

Note that currently this PR comes with no warranty attached. ;)\n[edit]\nMost allocations, that is. There's still some direct ArrayPool usage left even after I killed off PixelDataPool.. @vpenades, the long-term idea as @tocsoft outlined it is to have \"usage hints\" at the call sites. This way, you could configure a single composite memory manager that would work the way you describe, since the usage hints for encoders would be different than those used for images.. Interest? Sure. Time? Not so sure. Skills? Probably not. :)\nIf you need someone to do boring grunt work, then I'm your guy, obviously -- but I don't think pulling this to a separate branch is necessarily a problem for that, so do whatever is easiest for you. I'm just glad to have helped at least a little bit.. I've read the ArrayPool API docs and the DefaultArrayPool implementation. Those parameters mean that you've got up to 50 32MB arrays, up to 50 16MB arrays and so on -- the first argument being the max size within a bucket and the second being the maximum number of \"similarly-sized\" arrays within a single bucket of the pool. The size selection of DefaultArrayPool for a bucket works in powers of two, and you'll always get the size that's the smallest available but at least as large as you asked for.\nOut of curiosity, I ran the bucket count and bucket size algorithms for a DefaultArrayPool with those parameters, and the absolute maximum retained size would be just over 3 GB if every single array was in use. Of course I know that it's extremely unlikely that any allocation pattern will hit very close to that mark, but even a 50% fill factor will swallow a large portion of the memory space in 32 bit or in a low-memory container.\nAdd to this the fact that you've got one ArrayPool for every TPixelData you use within the app: for instance, if all you do is construct Rgba32 images from Jpegs, you'll have one ArrayPool of Block8x8's and another of Rgba32's. -- this is the exact case I had when I came along. This means that the max retained size for the pools is north of 6GB.\nI'd suggest that instead of dropping the max size of an individual array, you'd drop the max bucket count instead -- or, possibly, both. If you try to allocate beyond what the pool is capable of holding, it will just return a regular heap-allocated array instead.\n(Caveat: I'm currently undergoing a case of the Man Flu, so there's a possibility that I've messed up my math at some point. If you wish to double-check, the sources are at https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Buffers/src/System/Buffers ). My scenario is a batch processor that will download and convert images according to a number of different presets. After each resize, the resized image is stored on disk and the image itself is disposed, so that should mean having at most two images in memory at a time. No concurrent processing.\nAfter running a batch where there were lots of sequential resizes happening, my memory usage peaked somewhere around 1,5 GB and the app began to slow down (I'm guessing GC and disk thrashing due to page file usage).\nNote that this is a scenario that has no such issues with System.Drawing. I'm not talking hypotheticals here: what I did was take an existing batch app that targeted the desktop framework and ported it to run on CoreFX, replacing System.Drawing with ImageSharp. The app has been running for over two years without any memory-related issues, but the ported version choked almost immediately.\nThe main problem the current pool approach is that if you happen to load a single image that is, say, 90 MB in size, you'll permanently retain 128 MB of memory in that pool bracket, even when it has been released back to the pool. If you then load a 130 MB image, you'll permanently retain 256 MB. So going through a series of images that get ever larger, you'll eventually exhaust the heap space even when you'd only need enough capacity for the one you are currently working with. \nIn other words, if you ever, at any point, allocate and then release one array from each bucket up until you reach the 130 MB mark, you will have retained at least half a gigabyte until the app terminates. Multiply that by the number of pixel formats, and... you get the picture (pun not intended).\n(These calculations assume byte arrays -- I'm not sure, but for TPixel arrays this might change the constants by a little bit. In any case, it's still the same order of magnitude).. Apologies if I sounded like I don't like ArrayPools -- that was never my intention. \ud83d\ude42 I was just trying to point out potential issues in this particular mitigation strategy, that's all.. I think this usage of Configuration.Default makes sense here.. This is a bit unfortunate, but parameterizing this spreads pretty wide. What do you think?. Same as above -- taking this as a ctor dependency has far-reaching consequences.. This is the hardest usage to change, because while I could take this in as a ctor parameter, I'd have to pass in something for the singleton instances, and the only thing available... is Configuration.Default.MemoryManager.. In order to be able to pass the currently-used memory manager to the processors that need it, the easiest way I could think up was to expose the MemoryManager from the processing context.. I had this one down correctly before I changed from Marshal.SizeOf to Unsafe.SizeOf -- and then, for whatever reason, I messed it up entirely and didn't re-test it. Oh well.. This threshold here is rather large (80 kB). @antonfirsov was of the opinion, that the threshold for allocating from the pool should be half a kilobyte at the most, so we're going to want to change this, at least.. I changed the default value to 512 bytes, but obviously you can decide what you want to use for it -- I don't know what benchmarks to run to find the optimal values, and so on, so I'll just defer to your judgment. \ud83d\ude42.

(I'm not trying to rebuild System.Drawing, honest...)\nIs this a fair summary of the tasks:\n\nAdd PointF struct\nStandardise on PointF rather than Vector2 in the public API\nAdd implicit Point -> PointF and Rectangle->RectangleF conversions\nAdd explicit (or implicit if you think it's wise) PointF -> Point and RectangleF -> Rectangle conversions (some exist)\nPrefer RectangleF / PointF in the public API where appropriate (e.g. on all the drawing operations)\nHave easy (implicit?, explicit?) conversions to Vector2 and Vector4 for internal use\n\n. OK - I made a start on this - I've done a PointF class, but I'm afraid that the attempt to get the project to build (VS2017.2 + Core SDK 1.0.4) and run any unit tests has entirely defeated me, and once again I'm in retreat from the whole .NET Core business.\nI doubt the actual code changes required are more than a couple of hours work, but having spent more than that on the tooling, I'm going to pass on this.

I do follow that particular issue in the same spirit as one watches hockey for the fights or motor sport for the crashes.\nThe bigger issue for me is whether I want a library that I need to scan-convert a few lines into a bitmap to inject a chain of dependencies into a project of such enormous complexity that they can introduce a show-stopping bug that takes 6+ months to get fixed.

I've changed up my library to now first use LibVIPS to convert the image from JPEG to PNG before doing the comparison. Doing that will actually give me equal images again.\nSo basically (pseudo code):\n```\npublic void AreImagesEqual(image1, image2)\n{\n    if (image1 == jpg)\n          image1 = Vips.ConvertToPng(image1)\n    if (image2 == jpg)\n          image2 == Vips.ConvertToPng(image2)\n//Do the image comparison using ImageSharp here.\n\n}\n```. Ah, I apparently didn't look good enough in the open issues. My apologies.. Thanks for fixing all these issues so quickly guys :smile:. Yeah adding them to your suite is fine with me :smile:. Not sure where I can find it though.\nOne problem with actual & expected is that the actual could also be wrong if the PNG decoder fails. So ideally we would have some kind of reference decoder that could be used for loading reference images. (But since we don't really have that I think, both images are actually \"Actual\", and there is no such thing as \"Expected\").\nWe could ofcourse just rename the image that is currently failing to \"Actual\". (The way I could find this out is by simply running the unit test, then checking which pixel it fails for, then opening both images in Paint.NET, and then opening the image in Paint.NET and seeing what the value is of that pixel, and then seeing which of the 2 images loaded with ImageSharp matches this pixel value.). Alright, let me know when it's fixed. I'll rerun all my tests then :smile:.. Ah that's nice, I'll rerun my tests after to verify if this solves the problems I had for this image.. I personally wouldn't add the \"ExtractFrame\" method. I'd rather have a seperate function to remove frames in the image.Mutate(t => t.RemoveFrame(i)) or something.\nMaybe the Clone(int frameNumber) could instead be a reference to the internal frame of the image? Or maybe better, make a seperate method for that.. But why should \"Extract\" have the side effect to also remove it from the original then?. @JimBobSquarePants , I looked at this again and think you've overlooked one thing:\n\nAs you can see the image is an indexed image with 573 colors in the palette. I've highlighted below where it violates the specification.\n\n573 is actually divisible by 3. Which makes it 191 actual colors.\nCan I re-open this issue?. I worked on implementing option 1 in the attached pull request. Can you have a look at it?. I'm not sure if we want to implement it this way or have a look at the already existing Palette code which should be extended to always write alpha if the hasAlpha flag is true. But please let me know :)\n. I think the bitconversion could use some improvements. But its not really my speciality.\nIll look at signing the ca. Signed :smile:.

Also looking at the code and comparing how people do resize images using this library, I want to try another trick - if that helps, I'll be good.\nSince we're here, the issue itself was annoying not because of the crash but because of the fact no developer could reproduce the problem - Visual Studio trained everyone to have lots of RAM. \nWould be nice to have some kind of diagnostics that would pop the issue in development and not in production when it's a bit late :. Beta 2. Is there anything fresher/better?\nYes, I saw that improvement, thank you @antonfirsov \ud83d\udc4d \nI don't need transparency probably, though I would love to have it there just cause it could be...\nIs there a way I can write that code in adaptive way and if there is not enough mem, try using 24 bits instead of 32?\nPart of the problem is that I can limit binary file size for upload but then image could be small as a file but could have large size in pixels and it will lead to OOM anyway.\n. Meanwhile, I've refactored code and instead of using Clone + Resize to generate multiple sizes of the image I start with the largest needed size and use Mutate + Resize going down to smaller. \nDeployed and so far runs good in Azure 32bit on this image (for now). \nI can try nightly builds, yes. \nOn your questions, Anton:\n\ndescribing your use case\n\nUsers upload pictures for avatars to the website, we keep large and small thumbnail of these pictures.\nPNG/JPEG.\n\nHow many requests do you have before the crash\n\nBefore changing Clone + Resize -> Mutate - just one :)\nRight now trying to crash Mutate-based version.\n\nAre those large images outliers or typical?\n\nTypical, testing on images from https://unsplash.com/. I did some really simple tests on nightly 1.0.0-dev000706 and beta 1.0.0-beta0002 with Rgba32 and Rgb24:\nNightly:\nJob=Nightly1.0.0-dev000706  LaunchCount=1  RunStrategy=ColdStart\nTargetCount=10  WarmupCount=3\nMethod |    Mean |    Error |   StdDev |     Gen 0 |     Gen 1 |     Gen 2 | Allocated |\n------- |--------:|---------:|---------:|----------:|----------:|----------:|----------:|\n Rgba32 | 2.738 s | 0.2428 s | 0.1606 s | 1000.0000 | 1000.0000 | 1000.0000 | 399.96 MB |\n  Rgb24 | 3.153 s | 0.1689 s | 0.1117 s | 1000.0000 | 1000.0000 | 1000.0000 | 359.96 MB |\nJob=Beta1.0.0-beta0002  LaunchCount=1  RunStrategy=ColdStart\nTargetCount=10  WarmupCount=3\nMethod |    Mean |    Error |   StdDev | Allocated |\n------- |--------:|---------:|---------:|----------:|\n Rgba32 | 2.353 s | 0.1432 s | 0.0947 s |   8.21 MB |\n  Rgb24 | 2.798 s | 0.0935 s | 0.0618 s |   8.18 MB |\nI wanted to compare memory savings from beta/nightly and also Rgba32 vs Rgb24 but for some reason allocation is wrong for beta build (maybe it was built way too long ago).\nFor some reason beta works faster ~14%, and Rgba32 doesn't give huge memory savings so I will stay with beta0002 and Rgba32.\nThank you :) \n. @JimBobSquarePants once we plan to update the website where we use the package, I'll be glad to test the new version. \nIn many scenarios, we just used images from UnSplash, they come in different sizes and content.\nMaybe we can setup a dotnet benchmark-based test that tracks allocations and tries to get like 10 images from unsplash and convert them?. Sorry for my 2c, I was looking for issues on github similar to what we had with JPEG and stumbled on this thread.\nThanks for the great library! \nLooks like links from the opening comment are working and there are JPEG images there.

This is indeed a duplicate of https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/issues/572.\nI've verified it now works ok after the fix, see attached image.\n\n. Created pull request: https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/pull/540.. Alright, @mellinoe set me straight about the color component order: the color components are ordered from left to right -> least significant to most significant. For example Rgba will be stored with R as least significant byte and A as most significant, following the convention that DirectX does (which apparently is opposite to for example in System.Drawing.Color and CSS RGBA, from where my confusion about which order SixLabors is using stemmed).\nSo I'll just need conversion methods for Bgra32, which corresponds to the System.Drawing.Color Argb format.. I've added IPixel.PackFromBgra32 (corresponds to the System.Drawing.Color Argb format). Updated the .tt file as well and added a bit of textual clarification about the pixel format naming convention for pixel formats.. I'll look into adding some tests next week, need to keep my business afloat in the meantime.. The changes are fairly straightforward and mostly copy/pasted from the Rgba32, since the added conversions are also from 4-byte pixel formats the code is mostly identical, just setting rgba fields or using the From/ToVector4 stuff. So I'd say it's not a high risk change. But I'm in no hurry with the merge. I can write some tests early next week (very maybe tomorrow).. @antonfirsov I can't comment on the BackgroundColorProcessor, but remember that before this change the pixels were initialized with zeroes by AllocateClean2D. If you're 100% puristic, you'd be making a processor for this as well, which I think at this level is overkill. You can consider the one time initializion of the pixels as integral part of the allocation similarly to how AllocateClean2D does it.\nThe change is a tremendous speedup: previously you'd always have 1) the initialization with zeroes, and 2) the slow Fill processor. Now you're skipping 2), and made 1) configurable with a default value. So you're basically twice as fast.\nSome measured timings:\nalloc + fill 00:00:00.0205244, alloc with background color 00:00:00.0093514\nWhen not disposing the bitmap, so with a fresh alloc each time the difference becomes pretty much zero by the way, I'd have expected more difference here:\nalloc + fill 00:00:00.0755986, alloc with background color 00:00:00.0741654\n. I've no preference either way, I'll be using single frame myself only, so I'm fine with whatever fits the current philosophy best. Having said that, if you create an Image with a background color, it would feel more logical to me that new image frames have that same background color automatically. But again it's pretty much equal to me either way.. Alright, removed the ImageFrame.Background property, and just using default if the user creates a new frame after the fact.\n@JimBobSquarePants probably add some comments to the BackgroundColorProcessor code that you wrote here explaining the thoughts behind it, that'll be super useful for future users.. Yay! Thanks guys!. \n\nI've patched the issue: https://github.com/SixLabors/Shapes/pull/43.\nNotice that the problem appears only for larger x, y coordinates (roughly > 1500), and it gets worse the larger the coordinates are (bottom right of bitmap is worst). This indicates that there's a floating point rounding problem: floating point is relatively precise around zero, but less precise the further from zero you get.\nFrom this stand point a future improvement could be using the center of the bitmap as (0, 0), this will reduce the size of a a multiplication by a factor 4, improving the precision by the same factor.\nHere's a quick program to reproduce the issue quicker:\n```\n        public static void CreateA4300FullPageOutputBlurryTest2() {\n        var textOptions = new TextGraphicsOptions {\n            Antialias = false,\n            ApplyKerning = true,\n            VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Top,\n            HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Left,\n            //WrapTextWidth = PageSize.Width\n        };\n        var fo = SixLabors.Fonts.SystemFonts.Find(\"Microsoft Sans Serif\");\n        var font = new Font(fo, 36, FontStyle.Regular);\n        //int size = 2500;\n        int size = 1500;\n        using (Image<Rgba32> img = new Image<Rgba32>(size, size)) {\n            img.MetaData.HorizontalResolution = 300;\n            img.MetaData.VerticalResolution = 300;\n\n            img.Mutate(x =>\n                x.Fill(Rgba32.White)\n                    .DrawText(textOptions, \"O\", font, Rgba32.Black, new PointF(img.Width - 80, img.Height - 50))\n            );\n\n            img.Save(@\"D:\\support\\image2.png\");\n\n        }\n    }\n\n```\nProblem occurs at y    >= 1478.5f, set breakpoint condition start.Y  >= 1478.5f at InternalPath.FindIntersections. It will report 1 intersection for the outer polygon of the letter 'O' instead of 2.. I've moved the changes to the .tt file.. I played with it a bit, but I think I'm getting method signature clashes between the Argb32 and Rgba32 versions because the method sigs are the same.. Changed.. You mean should not? In that case I agree! Isn't my code though, so I didn't want to mess with it too much.. I've added some comments to explicitly state the intent here so there's no confusion. Can't really use standard loop syntax without losing a bit of efficiency. Since these low level bits get called so often I think a bit of extra optimizations are justified.. The thought behind it is that if you create an image with a background color, all its frames will have automatically that background color, which could be reasonably expected from a user stand point. Without it you'd have the first frame with the background color, and if the user adds another frame with ImageFrameCollection.CreateFrame(), it wouldn't have that background color.\nWhat's the reason for not having nullable type properties on a class?. Agreed with the default(TPixel) part, so you suggest always initializing the image frame with the clearColor then instead of using memoryManager.AllocateClean2D?\nI don't agree with the nullable reasoning, if it's properly documented and default values are not illogical I don't see a reason to refrain from using certain language features, if TPixel were a class it'd have been the same. In this case non-nullable works as well, but in general if nullable is better suitable for a particular situation I wouldn't handicap the design/api out of fear users are not capable enough of using it.. Alright, committed the change to non-nullable clear color.. Renamed it. It's probably more user understandable, I liked the clear color as it implies better it's an one time initialization thing rather than a permanent state.. I left in the parallel clearing, on my laptop it's still 10%-20% faster and I can really use all the speed there is as the drawing bit is quite a bit slower at the moment. The user can always set the parallel options to use 1 thread if he insists.. Changed method from public to internal. I'd just see this as initialization rather than processing, akin to how Allocate2D allows initialization, which isn't in processing either, but doesn't allow a default value.. Done!. Done, good point there.. Done.. Removed again, used this in one of my intermediate experiments I think.. Changed it, thanks for the help here!. I've moved it to ImageFrame, it's indeed more consistent with the Width/Height properties.. I see the method implements a member from interface IImageFrameCollection, wouldn't it be nice to change it to:\nCreateFrame(TPixel backgroundColor = default). ",

    "funkyOne": "Hi guys, got the same issue. Here's another image that fails. TweakPng has no issues reading the file as well as System.Drawing.\nzincartabstract_smallbar.zip\nHope it helps.\n. Hi James,\nSorry for the issue. Great thanks for the info, I finally start to grasp something about the images! Octree was even worse and I tried all dithering algos with Wu and the best result I got was with dithering off. \nIt gives almost as good (for my image) result as nQuant. Still some slight issues.\nOriginal\n\nnQuant\n\nImageSharp (WU, dithering off)\n\nAlthough still unpretty, but nQuant result is visually more suitable in my case. Having the same quantizer algorithm and dithering off I wonder what else could contribute to this difference?\n. Ah, great I still got your interest!\nThe samples are from a large image bundle. For original question I tried to localize issue as much as possible, I cropped off a part of the bundle and tested with it. The latter one I snipped from whole bundle processed. \nJust found a more more severe visual issue:\nOriginal\n\nnQuant\n\nImageSharp(Wu, no dithering)\n\nI know it's kind of an edge case, quantizing such a big (30meg) image and expecting an ideal result. I think about improvement to our bundling process - group the images by similar palette and produce multiple bundles for optimal quantization. Which is another big challenge for me! \nBut still, even with current input nQuant produces more or less acceptable image. Would be really great to understand what's the deal here. If it's due to some tweaks to Wu quantizer in nQuant, we could probably post these as a separate recipe or a configuration point to the quantizer? So that mathematical pureness of the original implementation is still preserved.\nLet me know if you want the original source bundle image. I'll send you the link.\nAlso let me know if i can help with anything else.\nCheers\n. I wonder if this is related to 2nd caveat from this link https://github.com/leeoniya/RgbQuant.js/tree/master#caveats--tips\nThe author also suggests a solution for this. I will try to test that lib later today, and let you know what I get.. @JimBobSquarePants, I've sent you the source image via WeTransfer.. ",

Hi @antonfirsov ,\n\nThank you very much for replying. It is highly appreciated. That helped me built the thing. However, because of lack of documentation and my competencies reading through C# code I'm having a hard time actually using the dll's in a PowerShell session.\nThis is as far I get:\n- I can build the ImageSharp project in MacOS now.\n- I can load the assembly in a PowerShell session with >> add-type -path /PATH/ImageSharp.dll\nBut that is pretty much it. How do I find out what methods and so forth is available on the loaded assembly?\nThank you.. Okay so I got a little further....by \"eye\" parsing the code \ud83d\udc4d .... \nSo:\n- add-type -path /PATH/ImageSharp.dll\n- Then I can do `[ImageSharp.Image]::Load(\"/Users/JohnDoe/Downloads/myPicture.jpg\") << however that one throws this error == \n\nThe following exception occurred while retrieving member \"Load\": \"Could not load file or assembly 'System.Memory, Version=4.0.0.0, Cultu\nre=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51'.

Hi @JimBobSquarePants ,\nThank you very much.....I myself am on a learning curve in regards to using a Mac. I'll try over in your Gitter forum.\nThank you....\nPS: @antonfirsov if you by any chance have an idea I would be happy to know.. Finally did it.

Tried another code and the same - the Load method returns null when passing same stream second time =( Maybe I do something wrong, I'm newbie in c# but cloning the stream didn't help. . This line\nvar config = Configuration.CreateDefaultInstance();\nCreates an error \"..does not contain a defination for CreateDefaultInstance\". It finds the Configuration class but no such method. \nAlso in my code the Load method is used in constructor and Save in a method \"Get\" because I'v wrapped it in a class that has multiple methods with chain like functionality. So the Get method is last point where caller can get the resulting Stream. Probably there is a bad thing about releasing resources but I'v found your method \"Dispose\" and will put it in Get method, is this ok? How do I get format out of Load method? Or this is impossible and then I'll just add private field with it to my class.. Figured out with format and now my method became 3x time slimmer by removing the switch. Nice! But still can't solve config problem. And is it possible to set up quality in Save method?. Excellent! Thank you guys!. ",

After inspection, it turns out my use case appears to be the default (for resize), so yay for good defaults! Thanks. \ud83c\udf89 . Hi @JimBobSquarePants,\nThanks for the help.\nThe code looks like this:\nC#\nusing(var iResponse = s3.GetObject(request))\n{\n    fileMetaData.Stream = new MemoryStream(); // fileMetaData is our own class\n    // this works -> var img = System.Drawing.Image.FromStream(iResponse.ResponseStream);\n    iResponse.ResponseStream.CopyTo(fileMetaData.Stream); // CopyTo supposedly does not change seek loc\n    fileMetaData.Stream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);\n   ...\n}. Doh. My bad. Yup, definitely missing context that would prevent the repro. In my effort to simplify the code sample..\nBottom line is my using was in a method that assigned/returned a reference to the MD5Stream. I'm assuming that Dispose must mark the stream as unreadable, which is odd considering that copying it, it was still actually readable--even though I have to reset the position (which is weird given that the docs say CopyTo shouldn't affect that).\nI just eliminated that using in the method, and it can read automagically as expected/desired. Sorry about that. User error. Many thanks for your alacrity on the issue.. I think because it was inline there where you see it in the sample, i.e., inside the using.

    "saucecontrol": "@JimBobSquarePants  Not sure if you've got this covered, but hopefully this helps...\n@vpenades  Your proposed solution essentially treats all transparent pixels as being black.  That is, if currentColor is 0, the result of multiplying by the kernel weight is also 0, so it doesn't matter whether you add it to the destination accumulator or not.  Of course, if there's random color data in there, treating it as black is better than nothing, but it doesn't solve your stated problem in the issue.\nEssentially, the problem is that if you skip a pixel, that pixel's weight in the kernel is never accounted for.  In order to produce accurate output colors, you must normalize the kernel weights such that they total to 1.  In the case of a blur, skipping a pixel results in a total applied weight less than 1 and has the effect of darkening any pixels that would have been partially influenced by the transparent pixel.  Again, it's the same result as if the pixel were black.\nThe solution is to keep track of any weights that were discarded so that you know how much total weight factored into the destination pixel's final value.  That value can then be re-scaled to account for the different weight factor.  I do this in my non-SIMD pipeline if you want to see how it works.  (Apologies for the non-human-friendly code -- it's T4 generated with loop unrolling and such)\nIt also works out that if you're using a premultiplied format, the value of the alpha channel post-convolution will be affected in the same way as the color channels.  The result being that when you unpremultiply, the value of the color channels is scaled back up by the same factor, restoring the proper color.  Essentially, the alpha channel acts as a proxy for the applied kernel weight, and normalization is applied as the premultiplication is reversed.  Bit of magic, really... but it works a treat.\nSo premultiplication does work, regardless of the kernel type, but it's not the only way to solve the problem.\n. Oops, I didn't see you had replied while I was typing all that out.  But man, I love it when writing something out makes me see something I hadn't before.  As I was sitting down to dinner this evening, it occurred to me I wasn't handling partially-transparent pixels correctly, because they need to have their weight reduced proportionally as well.  I'll be pushing some updated code to reflect that, so at least I helped myself if I didn't help you :)\nThe other thing I didn't mention (although this might be obvious to you) is that if you eliminate pixels that have negative weight in the kernel, the output will end up brighter.  The same happens if you clamp premultiplied pixel values before reversing the premultiplication.  If a pixel ends up brighter than it should be, it should also have an alpha value >1, so it would normalize when you unpremultiply it.  If you clamp the alpha before that, though, the pixel is left overly bright.  Very few apps/libraries get that right.  The light line artifacts I describe here in the System.Drawing output are caused by that premature clamping, even after you work around its other issues.. @vpenades That's correct.  I was pointing out that the code changes you suggested have the same result as treating the pixel as black -- or reading an actual black pixel.\nImagine a simple averaging filter applied to that image.  The kernel would be defined as [0.5, 0.5].\nSo you multiply the first image by the kernel and you get [127, 127, 127, 127] + [0, 0, 0, 0] = [127, 127, 127, 127].\nIf you simply skip over the second pixel you get [127, 127, 127, 127] + [skipped] = [127, 127, 127, 127].\nPoint is, if you don't adjust the weights to account for the fact that pixel was undefined, it's the same as if you blended a black pixel in.\nAs @JimBobSquarePants pointed out, premultiplication is the silver bullet solution here.  I was simply trying to explain the alternatives and why they work.\nEdit:  Just to finish the scenario out so it's extra clear...\nIf you assume the input image is premultiplied, then when you reverse that, you end up with the correct [255, 255, 255, 127], assuming you were carrying enough precision.\nIf you don't want to premultiply the input and use the extra memory, you can get the same result by re-normalizing the kernel weights.  In this case, you would save off the 0.5 weight you skipped for the second pixel and use that to adjust the result back up to a full weight of 1.  Again, you get the correct result of [255, 255, 255, 127].\n. Oh man, that image is great :D \n@vpenades Do you mind if I steal that for my test image suite as well?\n@JimBobSquarePants I'm happy if I was able to help, although it seems you had everything under control with your premultiplication plan.  And thanks for the kind words re: the blog.  I keep thinking of things to write about and can never find the time.  I'm sure you can relate :)\n. The sad thing is, the majority of devs will continue using System.Drawing because that's what they know.  And a large percentage of them will take a Microsoft-authored package over literally anything else.  One could at least hope that easy integration and a couple of unique features would tempt some devs to dip a toe in the ImageSharp waters.  Maybe then they'll see the light :).

I can't believe this has not been fixed yet, and that there is no movement on this issue! The whole net team should stop their work and make sure to remove these dll hell inconsistencies between the full framework and the newer net core bits, because they aren't playing well together, and many of us are at a breaking point. An exaggeration (about them stopping all other work to fix this)? No, maybe an understatement. It is frankly an embarrassment that such glaring problems were allowed and for so long, all the while most the team goes on making these wonderful new improvements to Net Core (which on their own I love), that's awesome, but not awesome that that work now makes it so our big projects on full framework can't even update to another newer full net framework version! And that itself becomes critical for certain reasons, and yet we go on an on with no fix. \nFor instance, this problem is not just with System.Runtime, it is also with System.Net.Http, it seems as soon as you upgrade from a lower full framework (in my case from net 4.6.1) to 4.7.1, suddenly it's like the framework is expecting references to the nuget System.Net.Http, which would be fine, except that any dependencies, anywhere, that ever reference a full framework version of System.Net.Http, cause non-compilable errors at build time..

So I can't use the ImageExtensions.Save() (following from ) function within ImageToperationTests.cs because of a namespace collision (The type 'ImageExtensions' exists in both 'SixLabors.ImageSharp, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null' and 'SixLabors.ImageSharp.Drawing, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null').  \n\nI tried duplicating the tiniest bit of that .Save() extension method's logic from within my test, particularly \n\nConfiguration.FindEncoder(ImageFormats.Png)\n\n, \njust to satisfy the Image's non-Extension .Save() method.  But that call to .FindEncoder() fails with a nullreferenceexception, but I cannot get the runtime to give me a stack trace for where exactly the exception gets thrown.  And visually, I can't figure out how it's even possible for that exception to be thrown.  And, something about that project type is such that System.Console is unavailable for printing diagnostic messages.\nSo perhaps i might graciously just bow out of this one?  This looks like a cool project to work on, and I'd love to contribute more if I have the time some day, but i have too much going on right now and this is turning out to be just a liiiitle bit too involved for just changing a NullReferenceException to an ObjectDisposedException..

Because I did not resize . \u0131t should be the same size \n//x.Resize(image.Width / 2, image.Height / 2);  it is only comment . 4.30 MB the source the destination is less than 1mb without resizing. the output looks exactly like the source. Only the source is 4.30 MB output is something like 800kb\nThe properties of output are similar to the source but the size is different. In 10 min I can share proper code and related images .

Consider I bought 1 kg apple in the market at home it becomes 300 gr .:) or reverse it at home you produce 1Kg apple when you arrived at the market you have 250 gr to sell... It is ok not much important.  Only sounds a bit not natural. :)\n. I did s simply a joke base on  your answer(--Explain please: why is this behavior wrong for you? It's a good thing to have smaller files.) \nBut still the question is there (--Your input images are probably saved at 100 quality, you're saving at 75 and then 90. This changes the way the quantizer ....)\nIn the code, I have an example which saves the image without defining the quality and in another example with defining the quality. The output is not similar but in both, the output is not the correct size.\nMy purpose is trying to understand your library and use it. Because I have found it brilliant. Also, I have shared the issue  I have faced.  For the purpose to help for improving.  Sorry for the joke.\nThe issue is still there.... ",
    "jherby2k": "Thanks and sorry about that!. I'd really like to see these, as a consumer of this library. I recognize that in most cases you're going to have to just copy the span to an array (at least you can ArrayPool) to use with MemoryStream, but eventually (.NET Standard 3, apparently) streams will be able to read from Spans directly.\n```\npublic static IImageFormat DetectFormat(ReadOnlySpan data);\npublic static IImageFormat DetectFormat(Configuration config, ReadOnlySpan data);\npublic static Image Load(ReadOnlySpan data);\npublic static Image Load(ReadOnlySpan data, out IImageFormat format);\npublic static Image Load(Configuration config, ReadOnlySpan data);\npublic static Image Load(Configuration config, ReadOnlySpan data, out IImageFormat format);\npublic static Image Load(ReadOnlySpan data, IImageDecoder decoder);\npublic static Image Load(Configuration config, ReadOnlySpan data, IImageDecoder decoder);\npublic static Image Load(ReadOnlySpan data);\npublic static Image Load(ReadOnlySpan data, out IImageFormat format);\npublic static Image Load(Configuration config, ReadOnlySpan data);\npublic static Image Load(Configuration config, ReadOnlySpan data, out IImageFormat format);\npublic static Image Load(ReadOnlySpan data, IImageDecoder decoder);\npublic static Image Load(Configuration config, ReadOnlySpan data, IImageDecoder decoder);\n```. Well I alluded to that in my request... at the time it was announced that the spanified Steams would be coming to netstandard 3.0 / .net 4.8 but now it sounds like that isn\u2019t going to be the case. My suggestion is to start targeting netcoreapp2.1 directly, and for netstandard just copy the span to a buffer from the array pool. At least then the API is consistent, even if there is no performance benefit when using the netstandard lib.. Did not know about that one! That\u2019s great.\nJust to clarify though, by \u201cspanified stream\u201d I\u2019m referring to .net core 2.1\u2019s Stream.Write(Span buffer) overload.

This change was Windows-specific.\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/5674\nThere is a rejected PR to add this optimization to Linux. The preference is to lean on the shared system implementation, and I would assume the same applies to OSX.\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/6876\nSo the Windows corefx version got a 20-30% speed bump but doesn\u2019t quite compress this image as well as the system zlibs used elsewhere (which all seem to generate identical output).\n.

    "stevehipwell": "Can you explain why you can't target net451? Usually any code that compiles for netstandard2.0 will also compile against net451!. @JimBobSquarePants - The reason a lot of projects target net451 as well as netstandard2.0 is that although you need net461 for netstandard2.0 the API surface for net451 is almost identical to netstandard2.0 and in most cases you will be able to target net451 without any code changes. \n@antonfirsov - For me the two required targets would be net451 and netstandard2.0. The net451 target would allow us to keep supporting customers on Windows Server 2008 with extended maintenance. The netstandard2.0 target would be for for new development.\n@both - My personal opinion is that .NET Standard versions earlier than 2.0 are at best confusing. Based on the above grid, my suggestion would be to target netstandard2.0, netstandard1.2 and net451. This would not only give multiple targets but the available methods would be based on capability and not the arbitrary .NET Standard versions.. @JimBobSquarePants - Targeting net451 will allow better support for .NET 4.5.1, .NET 4.6, Mono 4.6 to 5.2. If you can target net451 I don't see the problem in doing so as the framework choice is down to the package consumers who might have a valid reason for requiring net451 (e.g. Windows Server 2008)..

    "mabead": "@antonfirsov It totally helps! \nGiven, how mainstream image processing / resizing has become these days, we forgot (or didn't know) how CPU and memory intensive it could be. Doh!\nNote that I tried the ArrayPoolMemoryManager.CreateWithModeratePooling() strategy but it wasn't sufficient. I still have out of memory problems. I will try to move our resizing logic outside of this container and put it somewhere that scales better. I'll possibly use this approach.\nThanks for your quick support!\nBTW: the ImageSharp documentation and articles is not obvious to find. Here's what I did:\n- Went to the github project page since it is usually the starting point to find everything.\n- At the very top, I see a description saying A cross-platform library for the processing of image files; written in C# that redirects me to the project site. This looks like a good place to dig further!\n- On the project site, I see links to \"Getting Started\" and \"A Better API\". None of these pages point to the full ImageSharp documentation.\n- I then used the project site search box and searched for memory or doc or documentation but didn't find anything.\nI finally was able to find the documentation by going back on the github page, not following the link on the top, and reading the full README to find \"API documentation is available\".  Sorry, TLDR... shame on me.\nI suggest that you link your github.io and https://sixlabors.com/projects/imagesharp/. It would make it much easier to find your documentation.. @JimBobSquarePants I'll give a try to SimpleGcMemoryManager next week. . @JimBobSquarePants I'm sorry but I won't try SimpleGcMemoryManager since I moved the code to an AWS Lambda. That way, I am sure of the memory that I have available for the current operation and I am sure that even if I have 50 resize operations in parallel, I won't run out of memory.. Same for this file. \nAxiom Federation square.zip\n. @JimBobSquarePants I am really sorry, I am currently fixing the 4 issues that I have opened.. @JimBobSquarePants I have just the 5 issues that I just opened. Sorry again, there's no good excuse for what I just did. \nIf I can try to be positive after my mistake, note that I processed 49024 files today with ImageSharp and only these 5 issues poped-up on about 50 files out of this big lot.. All the attached files also show the problem:\n527588FB-492F-4ED7-ACC9-3C3CA00D409E.zip\ncover.zip\nExistence album art.zip\nIMG_9697_polarr 2.zip\nJordan_ProdbyKetch 4.0.jpg.zip\nLandr-My Post (20).zip\norganica.zip\nremix singular c.zip\nStrangerThings_KetchDaKid_4 2.zip\nThe Day's Eye.zip\nvisue 031.zip\n. @JimBobSquarePants @dlemstra is this bug really fixed? I just tried beta005 and I still have the issue with several images (ex: StrangerThings_KetchDaKid_4 2.zip).. I have tested ImageSharp with about 70k images submitted by our users and 18 images have this problem. Some of these images were already attached.. On my Windows computer (thus not inside of an AWS lambda), I created a console program that loads/resize/save as jpeg a bunch of random images coming from our users. Here's the memory consumption that Visual Studio reports. \n\nSo maybe memory is not leaking. Maybe my lambda dies out-of-memory because ImageSharp sometimes peaks to 3 GB of RAM and my lambda is limited to 1.5 GB! I will let you know how it goes with the SimpleGcMemoryManager.\nFYI: here's my console program.\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.IO;\nusing System.Linq;\nusing SixLabors.ImageSharp;\nusing SixLabors.ImageSharp.Processing;\nusing SixLabors.ImageSharp.Processing.Transforms;\nnamespace ImageSharpLeak\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            var directories = Directory.EnumerateDirectories(@\"f:\\prod-ok\").ToList();\n        var directoryIndex = 0;\n\n        foreach (var directory in directories)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(directoryIndex);\n            directoryIndex += 1;\n\n            var imagesInDirectory = Directory.GetFiles(directory);\n\n            foreach (var imageName in imagesInDirectory)\n            {\n                var temporaryFile = Path.GetTempFileName();\n\n                try\n                {\n                    using (var imageStream = File.OpenRead(imageName))\n                    using (var image = Image.Load(imageStream))\n                    using (var outputFile = File.OpenWrite(temporaryFile))\n                    {\n                        image.Mutate(ctx => ctx.Resize(640, 640));\n                        image.SaveAsJpeg(outputFile);\n                    }\n                }\n                finally\n                {\n                    if (File.Exists(temporaryFile))\n                    {\n                        File.Delete(temporaryFile);\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n}\n```. @antonfirsov I won't affirm yet that SimpleGcMemoryManager solved the problem but I can say that in 14 hours I didn't have an out of memory problem. Given it was night time in Americas, this is not very reliable yet. I'll let you know how it works today.\nResize frequency: \nThe only metrics that I have are for the last ~20 hours where I had 1070 resize operations.  See this graph for more details.\n\nTypical dimensions:\nI checked 4542 original images (this is a subset of all our production images) and they are in 514 different dimensions. So that's a lot of unique dimensions! Here are the top ones:\n\nHere's the full data: dimensions.xlsx\nThese images are typically resized to:\n- 480x480\n- 320x320\n- 360x360\n- 72x72\n- 960x960\n- 640x640\n- 150x150\nI don't have metrics on how often these resize dimensions are used.. @antonfirsov We now have done about a total of 1700 resize. There were no out of memory error since I moved to SimpleGcMemoryManager. . Thanks for the advice @vpenades. In my case, each resize request is made in an AWS lambda function call. Therefore, it is not possible to have concurrent executions within the same \"memory context\". When I have multiple users that request an image resize at the exact same time, AWS will spawn multiple lambda containers that each have their own dedicated memory. . Sorry, typo. It was beta005. I updated the description.. I haven't checked the exif profile. In fact, I have no clue what exif is so I wouldn't know what to check.. ",

Thanks for reviewing! :) . > IImageProcessor implementations should be separate from codecs so any behaviour should be written as part of the codec codebase itself.\nGotcha, I'll fix that before I set up the PR.. For the global palette, the cutting step happens after quantization. That's because we don't benefit from cutting out colors since the palette stays the same anyway. The potential benefit for global palette encoding is that we can have a bunch of transparent indices, so the compression can do a better job. Not sure how effective this will be in practice though.. @JimBobSquarePants I don't have time to finish this PR for a while (probably for about another month or so). Feel free to close it in the meantime if you want if you don't want it to clutter the PR list. Or if anyone wants to take over that's fine too. I'll get back to this when I can :) . I'm gonna close this for now. I'll open a new PR when I manage to pick this back up :) . This is kind of verbose, but I think this is all relevant information to the user so not sure how to improve.. I defaulted this to false because it overrides the DisposalMethod of frames which might be unexpected. Not sure about this behavior though.. Might actually be nice to put these methods and the memory management in a class (or partial class) to keep it out of the core encoder. This kind of stuff makes it harder to see what's in the GIF spec and what's extra. Also cleaner if more optimizations like this are added later.. Pretty sure this is incorrect for DisposalMethod.RestoreToBackground and RestoreToPrevious since the quantized palette may have transparent pixels. Not entirely sure how to handle this, because I don't have a good grip on which pixels are used when DisposalMethods are mixed.. This is only an issue if the image frames are already optimized for GIF encoding by the user. So if they take advantage of the different disposal methods and transparency. Should that be supported or can I assume each frame stands on its own while encoding? .

That lib was referenced and used by an Azure function that ran .NET Framework 4.7.1, when deployed I got run time errors like this with System.Numerics.Vectors\n\nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/issues/569\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/30106\n\nworked on that a bit then got similar errors on System.Buffers and System.Memory. People then suggested using an older version of the library, so I tried Beta 5 and got the same issues.\nFinally I went with Beta 4 and it worked.\nYou trusted me to be cool, and I failed you.. @JimBobSquarePants Reading your response, now I remember hearing about that somewhere, but I can't seem to find the links to it, I will try to update and test the library again.\n@antonfirsov I will try to replicate the issue again with beta 6\nThank you guys for the response..

Sure thing, I tested it locally on Arch Linux with:\nMono JIT compiler version 5.12.0 (makepkg/58637d0ee7c Wed Jun  6 22:41:15 CEST 2018)\nCopyright (C) 2002-2014 Novell, Inc, Xamarin Inc and Contributors. www.mono-project.com\n    TLS:           __thread\n    SIGSEGV:       altstack\n    Notifications: epoll\n    Architecture:  amd64\n    Disabled:      none\n    Misc:          softdebug \n    Interpreter:   yes\n    LLVM:          supported, not enabled.\n    GC:            sgen (concurrent by default)\nMy server is running Ubuntu 16.04 with Mono JIT compiler version 5.12.0.301 (tarball Wed Jul 25 15:47:18 UTC 2018) (rest same) Where the problem is the same.\nI have also tested it on Ubuntu 18.04 with Mono JIT compiler version 5.17.0.535 (tarball Mon Aug  6 10:00:43 UTC 2018) (latest ubuntu nightly version) and the Problem persists.. I can shortly explain why the underlying stream returns 0.\nPNG allows to split up the complete compressed data into blocks. Which means each png will consist of 1-n IDAT blocks which contain data.\nThe ZlibInflateStream gets called to only read the current data block: https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/blob/master/src/ImageSharp/Formats/Png/Zlib/ZlibInflateStream.cs#L88\nWhile the parent stream afterwards still can be read for control data: https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/blob/master/src/ImageSharp/Formats/Png/PngDecoderCore.cs#L249\nThis means the zlib stream will return 0 each time a read hits the block end.\nYou could bypass this by reading everything but the last byte and store it for the next block, as both .net and mono do not call the read method an additional time when a read call fills the entire requested buffer, but this seems rather like a bad hack than a good solution.\nImo this is actually, while maybe a bit tangled logic, a elegant solution as it requires no additional buffering when decompressing the inner data.. I've added\n\ncsharp\n        public void AllocateNewBytes(int bytes)\n        {\n            Debug.WriteLine(\"ZlibInflateStream registered: {0}\", bytes);\n            this.currentDataRemaining = bytes;\n            if (this.compressedStream == null)\n            {\n                this.InitializeInflateStream();\n            }\n        }\nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/blob/master/src/ImageSharp/Formats/Png/Zlib/ZlibInflateStream.cs#L88-L95\n```csharp\n        public override int Read(byte[] buffer, int offset, int count)\n        {\n            Debug.WriteLine(\"ZlibInflateStream Read: {0}\", count);\n            if (this.currentDataRemaining == 0)\n            {\n                return 0;\n            }\n        int bytesToRead = Math.Min(count, this.currentDataRemaining);\n        this.currentDataRemaining -= bytesToRead;\n        return this.innerStream.Read(buffer, offset, bytesToRead);\n    }\n\n```\nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/blob/master/src/ImageSharp/Formats/Png/Zlib/ZlibInflateStream.cs#L111-L121\ncsharp\nthis.compressedStream = new DeflateStream(new TrackingStream(this, \"zlibreader\"), CompressionMode.Decompress, true);\nhttps://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/blob/master/src/ImageSharp/Formats/Png/Zlib/ZlibInflateStream.cs#L224\n(Where TrackingStream is just a Stream wrapper which counts everything)\n\nAnd this is the output\n\nZlibInflateStream registered: 65535\nZlibInflateStream Read: 4096\nzlibreader> Sum: 4096, Read 4096, Req: 4096\nZlibInflateStream Read: 4096\nzlibreader> Sum: 8192, Read 4096, Req: 4096\nZlibInflateStream Read: 4096\nzlibreader> Sum: 12288, Read 4096, Req: 4096\nZlibInflateStream Read: 4096\nzlibreader> Sum: 16384, Read 4096, Req: 4096\nZlibInflateStream Read: 4096\nzlibreader> Sum: 20480, Read 4096, Req: 4096\nZlibInflateStream Read: 4096\nzlibreader> Sum: 24576, Read 4096, Req: 4096\nZlibInflateStream Read: 4096\nzlibreader> Sum: 28672, Read 4096, Req: 4096\nZlibInflateStream Read: 4096\nzlibreader> Sum: 32768, Read 4096, Req: 4096\nZlibInflateStream Read: 4096\nzlibreader> Sum: 36864, Read 4096, Req: 4096\nZlibInflateStream Read: 4096\nzlibreader> Sum: 40960, Read 4096, Req: 4096\nZlibInflateStream Read: 4096\nzlibreader> Sum: 45056, Read 4096, Req: 4096\nZlibInflateStream Read: 4096\nzlibreader> Sum: 49152, Read 4096, Req: 4096\nZlibInflateStream Read: 4096\nzlibreader> Sum: 53248, Read 4096, Req: 4096\nZlibInflateStream Read: 4096\nzlibreader> Sum: 57344, Read 4096, Req: 4096\nZlibInflateStream Read: 4096\nzlibreader> Sum: 61440, Read 4096, Req: 4096\nZlibInflateStream Read: 4096\nzlibreader> Sum: 65533, Read 4093, Req: 4096\nZlibInflateStream Read: 4096\nzlibreader> Sum: 65533, Read 0, Req: 4096\nZlibInflateStream registered: 43423\n\nIf i didn't make any mistakes the ZlibInflateStream gets the correct lengths: 65535, 43423\n(Write/Tag me if you need anything else checked; I'm also on gitter).

    "baulig": "Well, I would argue that your test case is relying on a broken behavior in dotnet.\nWhat's happening here is that on the second call to your ChunkedReader.Read(), you are returning 0.  Getting a 0 return from a Read() call in general means end-of-stream, so DeflateStream should not attempt any more reads.  However, it should probably throw an exception as well because it didn't receive all the data.\nWe need to figure out why the underlying Read() call returns 0.  How do you load those PNG files, do you have a full test case with ImageShark?  What's the inner stream that's being used by DeflateStream and where does it come from?. Well, as I just explained in https://github.com/mono/mono/issues/10054, I think that too much code in Mono relies on the assumption that Read() returning 0 means \"end of stream\" and that \"end of stream\" is permanent.\nI'm not sure what a good solution for this problem would be.  Maybe we could just take DeflateStream from CoreFX and see whether that fixes the problem.. ",

I added EnsureSizeBothDimensions to deduplicate code in two constructors.

One question does arise from the attempt to implement Parallelism into this algorithm:\nSince there are 2 identical loops that needs to be performed in series, should they be individually implement into their own Parallel loops? It seems like the logical thing to do\n. Ok. I didn't wanna use ImageProcessor class because I don't quite understand how I can use pre, post methods in this context. I will read through that class file and try to use it as it was intended. Oh! forgot to remove that, was doing some experimenting but since there are 2DArray pool I didn't implement it. Will remove it asap.. Alright will update that as that change becomes a part of the main repo so I get the API changes in my fork.. s is the number of pixels to consider for creating average luminosity surrounding the pixel the algorithm is working with. This minor change is one of the distinguishing feature between Bradley and Wellner Adaptive Thresholding (Wellner being faster).\nSee section 3: The Technique in the published paper linked in the description PR to get a full overview of the working of s. This value represents t in the published paper. If the value of the current pixel is t percent less than this average of the s number pixels on the left and top then it is set to black, otherwise it is set to white. . for now I set the two variables to clusterSize and thresholdLimit for s and t.

    "juddski": "Thanks JimBob, you're right of course, it is an issue with the decoder.  I hadn't seen the symptoms until performing a resize.\nUnfortunately, I don't know why Microsoft have designated the additional byte as unused; perhaps the 32-bit BI_RGB format specified as part of BITMAPINFOHEADER was more for DWORD alignment rather than to provide an alpha channel.\nIf the biCompression field is set to BI_BITFIELDS instead of BI_RGB, it still doesn't allow the specification of a bit mask for the alpha channel.\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd183376(v=VS.85).aspx \n\"Specifies that the bitmap is not compressed and that the color table consists of three DWORD color masks that specify the red, green, and blue components, respectively, of each pixel.\"\nBITMAPV4HEADER with the biCompression set to BI_BITFIELDS allows the bit mask to specify which bits of each 32-bit DWORD are used for red, green, blue, and alpha.\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/ns-wingdi-bitmapv4header\nDWORD        bV4RedMask;\n  DWORD        bV4GreenMask;\n  DWORD        bV4BlueMask;\n  DWORD        bV4AlphaMask;\nThe documentation isn't consistent however:\n\"If the bV4Compression member of the BITMAPV4HEADER is BI_BITFIELDS, the bmiColors member contains three DWORD color masks that specify the red, green, and blue components of each pixel. Each DWORD in the bitmap array represents a single pixel.\"\nIn summary, I believe that the Microsoft thing to do when loading a BMP with a BITMAPINFOHEADER is to always set the alpha channel for each pixel to fully opaque.

    "dmanning23": "Yeah it is from the ImageSharp nightly build. I'm using ImageSharp to create animated gifs, but the \"beta\" build currently on nuget.org takes several minutes to render. The alpha only takes a few seconds, which is why I'm using it.. Yeah, that's the version currently available from the myget stream at:\nhttps://www.myget.org/F/imagesharp/api/v3/index.json\nIt's empty except for that prerelease alpha build. I found that in the documentation somewhere, is there another myget stream?. dang yall, how did I end up so far out in the weeds? I'll pull down the \"good stuff\" and try again :)\nCheers!. Yeah that was me in #752, the old alpha was quite a bit faster creating animated gifs on Android. I'll look into swapping out quantizers and see if that speeds things up for now.. Ok yeah it is definitely the dithering that kills performance on Android. If I encode the gif with new OctreeQuantizer(false) to turn off dithering, it only takes 2 seconds to encode the gif. The same gif takes over a minute with the default new OctreeQuantizer().\nThe quality is complete pants, but with that kind of performance I can render at a higher resolution and it actually doesn't look too bad.. The guidelines mention an attribute that can be used to decorate the problem method. There are a few examples out there showing how to use it, I was going to fart around with it later this afternoon and see if I can get it working.. Ok, I've made a bit of headway on this issue... If I explicitly build one of those objects (with the correct generic type) and call the ConstructPalette method BEFORE calling SaveAsGif(...):\nvar test = new OctreeFrameQuantizer<Rgba32>(new OctreeQuantizer(false));\ntest.AotGetPalette(); //stubbed out method that just calls empty ConstructPalette\nNow when it hits that bit of code when calling SaveAsGif<Rgba32>, it has already seen it ahead-of-time and doesn't need to spin up the JIT compiler. I can't think of a very elegant way to fix it though... The easiest thing I can think of is adding a few AotCompile methods that are similar to above, that the user can call at init on iOS.\nkinda gross, but it would work :) I'll put together a PR so yall can give me your thoughts.. Looks like those workarounds are if this issue pops up from calling p/invoke, I don't think any of those would work because the error here is due to the heavy generic usage in ImageSharp. I have a PR open that adds a few methods that can be used to pre-seed the AoT compiler on iOS. I've been able to generate animated gifs on iOS using this technique :)\n. Yeah, that makes perfect sense :+1:\nI'll update the PR.. naw I dig it. All yall using StyleCopAnalyzer to setup those rules? I might set it up on a few projects of my own ;). Aight, got that last change in to rename to AotCompilerTools.\n@JimBobSquarePants  Yeah, this is ready to merge in whenever yall are OK with it :+1:\n.

Here is some SkiaSharp example code that also uses the same matrix and comes up with the correct result:\n```cs\nvar bitmap = SKBitmap.Decode(\"test.png\");\nbitmap.Resize(new SKImageInfo(290, 154), SKFilterQuality.High);\nusing (var surface = SKSurface.Create(new SKImageInfo(600, 600)))\n{\n    var canvas = surface.Canvas;\n    var matrix44 = SKMatrix44.FromColumnMajor(new[]\n    {\n        0.260987f, -0.434909f, 0, -0.0022184f, 0.373196f, 0.949882f, 0, -0.000312129f, 0, 0, 1, 0, 52, 165,\n        0, 1\n    });\n    canvas.SetMatrix(matrix44.Matrix);\n    canvas.DrawBitmap(bitmap, 0, 0);\n    var stream = surface.Snapshot().Encode().AsStream();\n    using (var fileStream = File.Create(\"canvas.png\"))\n    {\n        stream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);\n        stream.CopyTo(fileStream);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n. I can't imagine why the row/column values should work differently in a Matrix4x4 - I was under the impression that transformation matrices work the same way no matter what library is being used due to the mathematics involved.\nFor what it's worth, I use the same code path for transformations (in other words, using a 4x4 matrix that I calculate) that do not require perspective projection (scaling, rotation and shearing only) and have seen no issues. So my guess is that there is a bug with how we're using Vector2 when it comes to anything that is non-affine.\nIf I look at the Vector2 source, it looks like it is doing the same multiplications for 4x4 that it would do with a 3x2 matrix, which is what we'd be using for affine transformations. If that's true, then the perspective is being ignored entirely, which would seem to match up with the output from ImageSharp (the output is scaled, rotated and sheared, but not projected).. So I just tested this theory out - here's an example snippet:\n```cs\nstatic void Main(string[] args)\n{\n    var m1 = new Matrix4x4(\n        0.260987f, -0.434909f, 0, -0.0022184f,\n        0.373196f, 0.949882f, 0, -0.000312129f,\n        0, 0, 1, 0,\n        52, 165, 0, 1);\nVector4 v4 = Vector4.Transform(new Vector4(290, 154, 0, 1), m1);\nConsole.WriteLine(v4); // <185.1584, 185.1582, 0, 0.3085961>\nVector4 v4a = new Vector4(v4.X / v4.W, v4.Y / v4.W, v4.Z / v4.W, 1);\nConsole.WriteLine(v4a); // <600.0024, 600.0018, 0, 1>\nConsole.ReadKey();\n\n}\n```\nSo the issue is that the Vector2 we get back from doing Vector2.Transform is not homogeneous. If we use a Vector4 instead, then normalize the result from the transform, we get the expected result.\nI assume the same issue applies to using Vector3 as well, but it has been a long time since I've done this kind of math so it's just an assumption.. Ah yeah, I had to employ some trial and error for the matrix calculations. You can actually see that in my C# code my matrices are transposed until when I construct the Matrix4x4 (where I'm effectively manually transposing it back) because it just looks cleaner.\nAlso, what do you mean by the library will calculate the correct canvas size? Do you mean I can skip creating an intermediate canvas? That was a bit of a pain point before as my transformations would often result in the image being outside the bounds of the original width/height.. ",

In this case, the top of the image is perfectly fine instead.\nThis only seems to happen on the top edge of the target rectangle, the other edges are fine.\n\nI spent some time to investigate this but I couldn't figure out what was causing it. I might very well be missing something obvious here \ud83e\udd14\ncc. @JimBobSquarePants \n. I've fixed that last remaining issue, and this PR is now ready for review \ud83d\udc4d\nI don't see the button to mark the PR as ready for review though, so I don't know how to get out of the draft status.

Could you trigger the build again to see if that was just a temporary quirk?. @antonfirsov I've thought about using a color filter, this issue with that though is that it can only perform a single step (like the Win2D API LuminanceToAlpha).\nBut once you get the luminance map, that needs to be overlayed on the source image, and I don't think a single color matrix pass can achieve that. I mean, it can calculate the right factors for each RGB channel, but then you'd still need to multiply each one for the original channel value.\nThat's why I went with a separate effect, I might be wrong though \ud83e\udd14\nI mean, it's the same reason why I'm using a Win2D pipeline too, instead of a single effect.. @JimBobSquarePants I did take a look at those matrices and at how they're actually used, but I couldn't come up with a way to achieve this effect doing that. This is for two reasons:\n1) For each ARGB component, the matrix transformation does this:\ncsharp\nvector.X = (x * matrix.M11) + (y * matrix.M21) + (z * matrix.M31) + (w * matrix.M41) + matrix.M51;\nFor instance, in this channel, if I used the M11, M21 and M31 values with those luminance factors, I'd be able to get the actual luminance value just fine. The issue with that though is that in this luminance reduction effect, the luminance is then inverted (1 - luminance), and then multiplied for each individual channel. I'm not sure how it would be possible to do all these 3 steps with a single matrix \ud83e\udd14\n2) The page from the MSDN docs about the luminance to alpha effect specifically states that the matrix is meant to be used on premultiplied pixels, but looking at the implementation from the FilterProcessor<TPixel> class it seems that the premultiply/unpremultiply steps are not executed before and after doing the color matrix transformation.\nI mean, the first point is the one that's more important though.\nAlso, as each available effect done with a color matrix is still exposed with a dedicated extension method(s) anyway, wouldn't this code still result in the same APIs being available to the end user, while providing a better (more specific) implementation, which would probably be faster (eg. because the actual pixel manipulations are done on the whole vector and not on individual channels, so they can use SSE and whatnot when possible)?\nThis again, assuming that it was actually possible to achieve this with a single color matrix.\nLet me know what you think! \ud83d\ude0a. I'll wait for a response for this and if that's the case then I'll update multiple declarations both here and in the bokeh blur PR then.. I'm not sure I see why though \ud83e\udd14\nI mean, that method is just calling this same overload inside a loop, and here I already have that loop in place, as I'm iterating over the pixels in the current row.\nWhy would that be faster, if not just almost identical in performance (honest question)?.

Yeah, as I said, this is a luminance reduction filter, what you linked is just the luminance to alpha map. That's why I said the latter could be done with a single color matrix transform, but this effect can't, as it's a composition of multiple steps.\nTo reiterate, this effect does the equivalent of:\n\u2022 Applying the luminance to alpha effect to get a luminance map\n\u2022 Inverting the luminance map (to be used in the following step)\n\u2022 Multiplying the resulting mapping over the original RGB channels, preserving the alpha\nThis effectively darkens just the brightest areas in the source images, leaving the rest intact (otherwise the whole image would just get darker, and the dark areas would just end up being black, if a simple brightness filter was used instead of this).\nThe effect you linked maps to the alpha channel just because that way you basically end up with a semi transparent luminance map for the input image, what I'm doing here instead is to also overlay that map on the original image, scaled by the input factor.. So, if you wanted to approximate this luminosity reduction effect with a color coordinate transformation, you should use the RgbaToYCbCr709 conversion from your code (as that uses factors that are closer to the ones in the luminosity to alpha Win2D effect), plus you wouldn't need that 1 - amount step in the conversion.\nThe reason for that is: in my case I'm doing the equivalent of mapping the luminance to a semi-transparent, dark texture that I then overlay on top of the original image (that's the reason for the 1 - factor step, as I want the brightest pixels to become darker, while preserving the others)\nIf you remove that 1 - amount step from your RgbaToYCbCr709 method, you get:\nInput\n<0,25. 0,5. 0,75. 1>\nAmount\n0.667\nLuminance Calc\n<0,1724779. 0,3449558. 0,5174338. 1>\nRound Trip Luminance Calc 709\n<0,09411765. 0,345098. 0,5960785. 1>\nA bit closer, but it still differs due to the fundamentally different processing method we're using here. I'm not sure though why you're trying to find another way to reproduce this exact effect, is it just out of curiosity? Because this is a specific pipeline I came up with that I found was very useful when, for instance, writing text over a background image, but I'm not sure whether there's an equivalent effect documented somewhere, as you said you couldn't find any papers or articles with these exact processing steps either.\nIf you want some exaples, here's a couple small screens from a section in the app I'm working on where I'm actually using this effect (this is from the Win2D/Composition pipeline, not with ImageSharp of course).\nFor each screen, the banner at the top is the unedited image, the one at the bottom is the one processed through the pipeline.\n\n\nNotice how in the first screen, the text was very difficult to read due to the background image being very bright, and applying the filter resulted in a darker image, where the brightest areas were properly modified.\nIn the second screen instead, as the original image was pretty dark from the start, the effect left it almost untouched, without making it look almost entirely black, or too dark to be able to distinguish any details.. Sure, I thought this might be useful for others as well since in general this is always handy whenever you have text over an image, but I get your point, that's fair.\nI mean, I'd be all for just choosing a better name for it if that's an issue, but if you don't think this effect would be a good addition to the library per se, that's fine \ud83d\ude0a\nI guess you can close this PR if you want then, at least I'll be able to keep this code for the future so that when you eventually expose the processor and utilities APIs I'll be able to just reuse this processor with (hopefully) no additional work needed.. Isn't minRow more coherent though?\nThere's already a maxRow parameter that does exactly the same, just on the opposite side of the target rectangle, and that is used in the Clamp method.\nThis way it is called with Clamp(minRow, maxRow) which makes it extremely clear.\nIf I used offsetRow it'll be Clamp(offsetRow, maxRow), which to me is much less intuitive, as each parameter has a different name there for no apparent reason.. I see what you mean now, I hadn't noticed the name mismatch in the column paarameters since those were the same from the already existing convolution methods, I'll go ahead and make them all use min/max \ud83d\udc4d\nAlso, can you mark this PR as ready for review? I don't see the option to change the PR state on my end, and waas wondering if you mods could do that for me.\nEDIT: the refactoring is done in https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/pull/842/commits/c1fbc0944a67bac8c06b218a473df08697be65c8.. I actually realized this needed to be fixed in the second complex 1D convolution pass as well, done in https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/pull/842/commits/15044d740319ca0ba702191d5efdb8367299d159..

    "Lakritzator": "I'm not sure how reproducible the problems were, but I guess I didn't make it worse. Just let me know when you see the issue again, and I will have a more thorough look! But my gut feeling tells me I got all.... P.S. I like the automation you did, I really should use this CLAassistant too.... This means you actually have unit-tests which can check, in the forest of tests my time-boxing prevented me to find them. I'll check this :+1: . I made the needed changes to the test cases, but I'm not 100% pleased as it felt like I was removing test-code which might be sensible for different cases. I'm not sure if RectangleF is forgotten, let me check that before you merge things (if AppVeyor finally finishes)\nMaybe I'll get the old code back, but replace the Rectangle with RectangleF and have the new code for Rectangle parallel... this might make more sense. The question remains if RectangleF really needs the FillRegionProcessor or also should use the FillProcessor with degrading the RectangleF (float) to Rectangle (int), or keep the FillRegionProcessor? Let me know what you think!\nP.S.\nCan you already tell if my GDI changes fixed the instability, or can't you tell while it didn't happen that often? . ",

    "Marcel0024": "Going down the rabbit hole, it seems ImageSharp does a wrong quality estimation based on the Quantization Table. The estimation is based on a formula of ImageMagick.\nFurther digging i found this paper:\nDetermining JPEG Image Standard Quality Factor from the Quantization Tables\nThe code provided in the paper is what JpegSnoop uses to determine the quality factor. JpegSnoop gives me a 98.25 approx quality factor on the same image i used above\n\nI got a 3 in ImageSharp (while the quality is clearly high)\nThe paper is also mention the method used in ImageMagick is fairly inaccurate\n\nIs this where my problem lies? Is it worth further investigation?\nEdit:\nUsing ImageMagick directly produces these qualities:\n\nIs it just wrongly implemented in ImageSharp?. I've compared the code to the ImageMagick one. All the logic and table seems the same.\nThe quality here is set to 3, and then it always keeps hitting continue on line 109, until it exits the method with quality 3.\nThe only thing i don't understand is ImageMagic's version of the quality variable here what does quantval do? its not a c syntax no? does it only get the value at that position like its translated in c#?. Nice!. ",

    "KodrAus": "Hi there! :)\nJust curious how you know for sure these buffers will be pinned? If the default ArrayPool allocates it's slabs on LOH then it'd be safe so long as callers haven't tweaked the GC config. Not sure to be honest, I haven't actually checked that, but AFAIK the ArrayPool implementation in CoreFX doesn't guarantee the buffers it gives you will be pinned.\nIn CoreFXLab for instance, there's a pattern for retaining a buffer, which uses a GcHandle to pin if it's not expected to be already.\nEDIT: Oh, my mistake. That's a managed reference.. I don't know why I didn't notice the ref part first time I looked. I just saw:\ndiff\n+ DangerousGetPinnableReference()\n- fixed (byte*)\nAnd thought they were still raw pointers. A common naming rule sounds like a good call \ud83d\udc4d . ",
