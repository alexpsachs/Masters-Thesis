    "deletescape": "I'm still trying to find out where I should hook in to get this up and running. We need a scale (percent) based option for this and also the text size. Broken on op2 oos3.5.6 though. @ZerNico any update on this?. noice. Lmao, I just did this even tho I thought I'd never fucking be able. I need a more detailed description of what you mean by this. Closing this for now as this has really low priority. Merged with #6. Done :smirk:. I closed the wrong issue, lol. Seems to be working for everything except row and column icon counts. I think the best way to make sure settings are applied is actually adding some kind of reload logic to pretty much everything :joy:\nMost of the things are already reloaded right now. There was some logic to kill the process and start it again in the past, but the app ended up in a weird state and wasn't usable at all, also it isn't really great in terms of ux. There is currently no way to make apps visible again. Closing as this is already possible. Causes performance problems, closed for now. Undo the gradle changes and I will merge :smirk:. you wouldn't have had to close it, just pushing more to your branch would have added it to the PR lel\n. Lel. Right now I am only releasing on my Telegram Channel I didn't plan to release any builds on GitHub or Google Play before the app is stable enough. But as I can see quite some interest for the app I will start to release some of the builds on GitHub aswell starting in the next few days!. @SeanForester27 It's not in the readme, it can be found on the releases page. @SeanForester27 If you have an Icon Pack installed on your device (Most of them should work) you can use it by selecting it in the Lawnchair settings. @SeanForester27 Long press on the home screen, then select settings there, to uninstall it open your device settings and uninstall it from there. @TokedUp Swipe up from anywhere already opens App drawer, swipe down to open notifications has just been added, and after all, this is still my project and I would not even have to implement it this way if I wouldn't want to.. With the code from Pixel Launcher weather only work when the app requesting it is Pixel Launcher. I will try to make my own custom implementation of the weather display in the future. @shashikant-ng2 Amir is using the Pixel Launcher package name for his launcher (which I won't and can't do) which is what made this work. A custom implementation is coming soon though. Closing because this is a duplicate of #21. Thanks for opening this issue, had it on my mentsl to do list already but forgot to open an issue for it :joy:. Closing this issue as it is a duplicate of #6. Actually... fy \ud83d\udd95 \nDuplicate of #6, closing this farken carnt shit bae. To get the notification dots to work you have to go to settings and enable notification access for Lawnchair.\nAnd yeah, pixel bar sometimes disappears sometimes right now, I don't yet know why but I should have it fixed by next week. Damn, Blame Samsung. Reopening this, will use it to track progress for the pixel bar disappearing problem. @amirzaidi it's what I did, but everyone complained that my change actually changed something and it doesn't look like before... :joy: :unamused: . Icon size can be changed in settings, so if you want icons to have the same size in dock / drawer as on home screen, you can do this in settings. There is an option for it :blush:\nSettings (with a lot of customizability) can be found when long pressing on the home screen and then pressing the settings icon there. Looks good, will merge now, as it won't break any current feature atleast. An Option to import / export from/to lawnchair (and maybe other launcher3 based launchers) will be added in the future. @beatbrot this would be highly appreciated! Send a PR whenever you have it. Perfect, thanks for your efforts!. There is the class ch.deletescape.lawnchair.model.GridSizeMigrationTask it should be able to help you migrate from different grid sizes.\nFor sub grid positioning we should probably just round for now and make sure nothing overlaps (as this doesn't work in lawnchair yet and would probably cause crashes). We can still change that if we add the feature in the future.. Right now all landscape support from the launcher3 base was removed in Lawnchair as it bugged out quite a lot of stuff and would have made some custom features a lot harder to implement. A new, improved landscape mode might be implemented in the future. By tray you mean the list of all apps?. Right now there is no option to make it fully transparent, but I can implement this pretty easily, maybe tomorrow already :blush:. Thanks for this, you were faster in correcting this than me :joy:. A lot of the strings from the custom settings are not yet extracted to string resources as a lot of them change every release, translating them already would just create additional work in the future, but thanks for the interest in helping. If you could provide the structure for this in a PR I would really appreciate it! Never worked with Hockey before, but sounds like a great idea!. Probably an issue I haven't noticed yet, thanks for the report. @baruchin I don't know, didn't really change anything but if it works now you can close this issue. Thanks @amirzaidi for the help, will add it in, but it will only work if the app is a system app\n. Thanks for the heads up @alexandrumarcel I will definetly provide an implementation of some kind. @Trak-X if you are able to get a functional implementation for rooted / non-rooted users I'd appreciate a PR!. The other shortcuts only work with 7.1+ right now (from your title + actual issue text I can't tell if you are on 7.0 or 7.1). Shortcuts also only work if the launcher is set as default launcher, this is a limitation by Android itself. @TokedUp Storage is required for the wallpaper picker (should not have anything to do with the shortcuts though) and I will have to investigate what phone permission is used for myself (and if it is actually even needed). This is already implemented. Haven't even realized this yet, thanks for the report. Have you granted Notification Access to Lawnchair?. Yeah, seems to be broken in the dock, should be fixed by next week. Thanks a lot :blush:\nPay Pal Donation Link. @TokedUp There is an XDA Thread already\n@Dondrejohnson5  Keep in mind that most developers would like to have single issues per request because with a list like this it is really hard to keep track of progress.\nSome of your requests already have open issues associated with them. Additionally some of your requests are pretty cryptic or describe features which Lawnchair already has.\nI'll never implement something I personally do not like, or I think is a too big impact on performance, but thanks a lot for your suggestions.. Closing this issue as the creator of this is being a d*ck. You actually just managed to make me mad on the internet (which is pretty hard). Read our conversation again. I am asking you to split your issue into multiple ones (which would be like 5 minutes of work for you) because this would save me atleast 1h of work. \nIf you don't get it yet, I'm working 24h per week on this project, and I invest a lot of time in this, for FREE. I don't have to do this, I want to. So, you could now be nice and accept my tiny request to split it up, or you can be a d*ick and act like this is your Launcher and you're paying me for this work. \nYou're not the one making the rules here. I am. I am also the one who decides which features to implement and which not.\n!rant off\nYou have a second chance to first look if there are already existing threads for your issues or open new issues for each request.. I will probably release it on the PlayStore once it is stable enough. Theoretically already implemented for Calendar, apparently doesn't change on midnight though, thanks for the report. Lawnchair defaults to the pixel icons built into apps, I will not include an icon pack into Lawnchair. Those icons are supplied from the apps themselves, this is not my fault.. I don't get what you want me to change here. @intelligentcasanova he means something else here, it's not actually a duplicate. Duplicate of #34 . duplicate of #21 . duplicate of #43 . Closing this for now, might reconsider this in the future (also, partial duplicate of #25 ). This will be fixed in todays build. Nope, the behaviour of Lawnchair is exactly the one of Android O (it is actually copied from a decompiled version of Pixel Launcher). This is a weird behaviour not many users will actually like, and I don't see a big enough use for this right now.\nClosing this for now, might reconsider it in the future. Haven't yet noticed this myself, but I didn't test this for quite some time, will look into it. Not reproducible for me. What phone are you using? Perfectly works for me!. With which rom? Can you send me a screenshot of the app drawer?. Realllllly weird, status bar icons should invert the color in the drawer. Also that search text should have a different color.\nAre you using a substratum theme?. Thanks for the info @YAJATapps forgot about that :joy:. Some people are still reporting that issue, I'll keep it open for now. Can you explain this a bit more in detail? If you mean changing icon pack per icon, there is already an issue for this ( #25 ). No problem about earlier, everything is alright now, I had a long day.\nAnd this has actually changed in version 198, apps can now be edited by long pressing and selecting edit at the top of the shortcut view. Noticed this issue myself too, should be able to fix it\n. As you can read in the changelog of this release there is currently an issue with building on travis which causes signature changes, so you actually will have to uninstall and reinstall. If you are rooted and want to keep your setup you can simply use titanium backup to backup and restore the data. @intelligentcasanova yes it is, but only when a custom DPI is used. Kind of related to #47. @tstackhouse exactly, closing for being a duplicate. This is actually a bug I noticed myself, forgot to fix it before the release, should be fixed pretty soon. Duplicate of #33 . @OvermindDL1 this is actually exactly what I am planning to do (Kind of like profiles). Duplicate of #64 . Ummm, yeah it does :joy: I knew it would look weird, but.... THAT WEIRD \ud83e\udd23 . Duplicate of #49 . Should already be fixed (but not yet released) . Yeah, that's kind of an upstream problem in Launcher3, I will probably need help for this though. I don't see how this would be related to the app itself in any way, but I'll try to find out why. @Joni5664 Long pressing on the handle (the arrow thing above the dock) opens the drawer and focuses the search bar, I think this is just what you are searching for. @fonix232 still fails \ud83d\ude10 . Merging now, as it should still only fail for PRs rn. Should be improved, is it better now?. @fonix232 probably also not for being 100% focused on everything at all times :wink:. @adamf663 This has been fixed now and will be available in the next update. @GAZ082 We are releasing using the google play beta system but as the entire app is currently ONLY in beta the only active channel is the beta channel. It's not supposed to be transparent. But I might add a seperate option to hide it. Can you provide some additional information, and maybe a logcat for this and #118? \nI don't think I have this problem on my emulators which are x86 too afaik. It's not really a bug, as it doesn't actually break any functionality, it's just not that beautiful :joy:. Duplicate of #21 + #22 . duplicate of #40. This PR can not be accepted right now as it adds language variants for the preference files, translations are only allowed to change string resources, to make preference string changes possible I am currently extracting string resoucres. I will be uploading the new releases on XDA lab as soon as I have time. I am really busy with other stuff. Main release channels are github and telegram. When no icon pack is used and Pixel Icons are enabled circular icons are used from any app providing them in their manifest. duplicate of #27 . Duplicate of #25 . This is really weird and should definitely not happen. Will look into it. Fixed with 1c28b213e73edda1fa57e1f7a84247518a3a438c. Known issue, thanks for the report though. Closing this as #175 will now track progress of translations for all languages. This feature is not available in Lawnchair. Fixed in unreleased builds. The only thing which would make sense here is that this is actually Firebase (firebase will soon be removed from the app) logging analytics, Lawnchair doesn't use network connection itself.. In the future the app will have a built in updater and will thus also create a bit of network usage, but it will probably be a lot less than right now because we won't be collecting as much analytics data as we are now anymore. Fixed in unreleased builds. Thanks a lot @Wolforpion! I have added a link to a small guide on how to use the translation editor in Android Studio. @Wolforpion Moved to crowdin now, link is in the issue description. @Wolforpion I messed up with the link, fixed now. @Wolforpion the most voted translation is the one used in lawnchair. @edisso10018 You can report incorrect translations and I will look into them. We already have 3 proofreaders for german (including me). Fixed already, but not yet released on stable channel. This is fixed after a restart of the Launcher (Settings > Debug > Restart Lawnchair) but it is definetly a bug. Duplicate issue. This would basically be a step back as I ditched the mic icon for the assistant one, and adding more and more choices is basically bloating the launcher and not what I am aiming for. @Easonzero there is an option to turn blur on and off already. Merging this as it is helpful for custom roms which want to include lawnchair. Duplicate of multiple issues. duplicate of #27 . duplicate of #25 . Just because something looks different in a pretty much unrelated launcher this doesn't mean it is broken and needs to be fixed. We'll look at it though\n. :man_facepalming: . The arrow dropping below the dock is a desing choice and thus an intended feature. Notification badges are already added, give lawnchair notification access for it to work. @jackmort37 please open a new issue for your problem, this is not related. @AxiK101 this is probably an issue with the app, Shortcuts aren't made to work on older APIs so we can't grant you that all of them will work.. No. Yes, Lawnchair can be added to F-Droid (previously discussed with @ildar via email). Because it is not implemented yet.. @paphonbth more like 30 actually. Clicking on the date opens the calendar. It properly works (atleast for iconpacks) since a few versions. @fonix232 actually changing the default (english) strings doesn't work on crowdin, so I am merging this I think. Translation changes should be done on crowdin only. This is caused by the google app, we can't do anything about it. This will not really work without the proper layouts for landscape and a lot of other code which has been removed for now. Will merge this once conflicts are fixed. This isn't really a fix, but I know how to properly fix it, will be done as soon as I have time to do it. @fonix232 @paphonb opinions on this? Imo we can merge. Fixed, not yet released on stable builds. We have another icon set by now, so I will close this PR, if you have the motivation to do your work again I'd be happy to accept a new PR as our current icon set is the final one (it might be extended by a bit though). Current implementation does not cause to force stop without google wallpapers, instead it will fallback to the built in wallpaper chooser. This is not how this works, please only make PR's on the alpha branch and do only include new commits.. This should be possible on crowdin, not sure if I have added the language yet. @AxiK101 please provide a PR for this if possible, we have no way of knowing all languages so we depend on Pull Requests for those format changes (see Pull Requests for other languages as an orientation). @fonix232 we could do that, but only with enough context provided to explain what this string is used for, as the string in it self is pretty unclear. @AxiK101 no need to do anything, this will be fixed once new translations are imported. We can't really affect how the Wallpaper is rendered as this is done by Android. This is a bug with MIUI and not fixable by us. You need Google Services + the google app installed, the google app needs to be up to date for this to work. This is related to the Android Version / manufacturer changes, we can not grant that this feature will work for anyone as we are using an unofficial and undocumented method for it. 1. I don't think this is directly related to Lawnchair\n2. Without Logs or anything we can't do anything about this, as we have almost no chance to reproduce this\nClosing this for now, if you can provide a log and can reproduce this we can reopen it. If this is the issue you can compile your own custom builds using an older gradle plugin version. We will not change Android Studio and Gradle Plugin versions for unique issues. @AxiK101 no need to repeat the content of the issue, this just generates useless notification for EVERY watcher on this project. This is fixed in unreleased builds. Enable Location access for Lawnchair, to allow switching between providers.\nOn the Pixel launcher the weather is refreshed by the Google app, I don't know what the refresh rate is there. @ellenswamy weather.com has no public api. Google Awareness API has been added as an alternative provider, this should provide results which are\n\nLocation based\nAccurate\n\nPretty similar to the values displayed inside Google Now . @ivancuric if you feel like paying for this expensive as hell api for us, feel fre :joy:. no-rNO is correct, this is the way it is written on Android (also there is a version of just no), the r in no-rNO stands for region, so this would mean norwegian from region NOrway. I'm not sure how much of the Translations for Norwegian are imported into the app already, this could also be the source of your issu. Should be fixed with a4be55b092d7487f53a9d6da00bf8baeda374cae. @AxiK101 yes, because only those apps currently support adaptive icons, and that's definetly not Lawnchairs fault :wink:. We already tried a few fixes for this issue in the past, but it is quite hard to fix, so it could take a while, but we're working on it. @fonix232 to me it looks like the creator of this PR tried to create an issue but ended up creating this . Bday is over \ud83d\ude02. @leon0399 the way it looks on the second screen is google now on tap in the launcher mode. You can enable location access for Lawnchair and Switch to Google Awareness API in settings, this will be more accurate and location based. @gameeater translations are generally always imported before a new stable build is released. This would be a list of 177 persons, and as Crowdin doesn't provide a way to export the names of all translators this is not possible for now, I don't want to copy paste 177 or more names every time we create a new bigger release. This is probably just an issue in how we are applying this setting, makes the color go back to default though?. We desperately need a search function, but you can actually swipe right and left to browse the categories of your icon pack. Using the external icon selectors of the icon packs caused crashes in the past, this is the reason why we switched to our own implementation. Just be aware that this key might be blocked if too many user make requests with it. This is not yet implemeted. @AxiK101 1. Stop being a dick please\n\n\nWe have over 100 fcking issues and some of them are way more important thant this shit\n\n\nWe do this for free and for fun, and we could just not implement this feature at all if we don't feel like it.. grid size settings are already implemented, there is an open issue for d2s already. As far as I understand the search algorithm this is intended behaviour to keep the results clutter free. Nobody would actually search for \"a\" and expect \"Camera\" to appear as a result. I might consider rewriting the search algorithm in the future and sorting by relevance, but for now this doesn't have high enough priority.. Because upper case letters followed by another uppper case letter usually indicate an abbrevation (where each letter stands for a single word) and upper case letters in the middle of a word indicate combined words. No, the buttons are exactly the size they are meant to be, and the way it was designed by google. duplicate of #434 . Duplicate of #305 This is only an issue in the battery metering of DP4, Lawnchair doesn't actually have such an impact on battery.. This is probably the 10th issue for this, please search before opening new issues. Our weather updating function isn't that stable right now, it is easily possible that it just fails, we definetly need to improve this. Lawnchair has such a function but it currently doesn't work. \n\n\nStable releases will soon be on the Play Store. Logs would be great!. You can also grant permissions from the app info screen by manually enabling them there.. No, I will not revert back because the new sizing algorithm fixed a lot of other sizing issues. What I will do though is improve this new algorithm.. We do not have anything to do with how/how good google search works. It is just opened from inside Lawnchair, but the actual search interface is inside the google app. Translations should only be edited on crowdin, no Pull Requests with translation errors are accepted. @ArmanKir-yan25 stop with that attitude please, all developers of Lawnchair are doing this for free and because we want to do this, we don't have to and there is nothing forcing us. We also have personal lives, family, school or work and don't you think we can also use some of our time for those things?. @AxiK101 you can close issues you have opened yourself. The format for you language can be submitted on crowdin, or is probably already submitted. New Translations will be merged in before the next stable release. This is not how this works. Please only open issues in English, none of the developers of Lawnchair understand Chinese. Thanks for understanding. No. This is already implemented in alpha builds. How does this look with the dark/black theme?. This will be merged as soon as @Treemindr resolves merge conflicts. We only accept translations through crowdin (see link above). Both of those are already implemented. Dude, f*cking stop requesting the same stuff over and over. I already answered you on your other issue where you already requested half of the stuff here. Icon shape changing is supported, but only on O and upwards. All other requests are duplicates.. And also: Always open 1 issue per request, it is impossible for us to track progress otherwise. @ArmanKir-yan25 are you even reading what I answer... STOP requesting the same stuff over and over. Backporting shape changing to anything pre O is not possible right now, but as soon as we find a way (if there is any) we will do that. @jjanku you can download an alpha version from https://lawnchairmirror.duckdns.org to try this out yourself. So this is basically fixed already, but not in our currently stable version.. @paphonb @fonix232 any thoughts on this? Looks pretty cool imo. @faroit I'm not sure if it is still Worth your time to implement it in V1 as our main focus in on V2, but as that part of the code is more or less still the same in V2 I could simply cherry pick it to there. So if you have enough time and feel like doing this, feel free to do so.. The currently as stable released build does not work on Oreo, this issue has been fixed in alpha builds already. closed it, but you can actually close issues you authored yourself. Have you granted location permission to lawnchair?. This never was a bug before, but it is now, yes.. @ArmanKir-yan25 @AxiK101 please keep the language clean here and NO offtopic discussions in issues please, all 131 watchers get emails for all comments.\nIf any of you two (or anyone else) thinks they need to insult people on here again I will BAN you from any futher actions on this repository without warning. All image assets in Lawnchair are optimized already. And this PR alone doesn't do anything in itself except adding a shell script.. This is a really old bug (also present on pixel launcher) and afaik it only appears when using a custom DPI, we don't yet have a working fix for this, but we'll hopefully find something soon!. Icons can be changed per app already selecting icons from other icon packs\nEverything here has been requested before, please search for other issues before opening new ones.. duplicate of #564 . Fixed. Google awareness as weather provider only works if Location Access is granted to Lawnchair and Location (GPS) is enabled. Inaccuracies/differences from the weather in google now are due to different weather providers and not a bug, we can't change that.\nLawnchair doesn't yet have a double tap to sleep feature, but we are already tracking progress for that in another issue.. Weather is based on your current location if you select the Google Awareness API as Provider. Please directly upload the picture here (the xda cdn 404s)\nAs far as we know so far this excessive battery drain is just a reporting issue on the android side, but it is something we will try to address as soon as we find its origin. @Pedro1999 there is no need to open 50 issues for the same issues as this just generates extra work for the developers, it does not help us in anyway. Please search before opening a new issue.. Duplicate of #434 . @jackfagner I am always happy to accept pull requests :). @jabia13 if you think #666 isn't properly articulated make a comment there with your additions. Duplicate issues only create more work for us and don't help anyone. There is no need to open new issues for existing requests.. Restarting through the debug options is the same thing as if you would force stop it and start it again, which can both result in weird uncontrollabe behaviours. I don't see a way in which we could (and would want to) do something about this.. This is a bug in x86 Android System Libraries which are being used by Lawnchair, there is no possible way to fix this by us.. @goody1989 If the Arrow is still visible you could just long click on it to bring up the search while this feature doesn't exist yet. Read my comment on #693, there is a patch for this which has to be applied by the rom developer ( @MSF-Jarvis you still have the link?) which would allow text relocations. I am able to reproduce this on 7.1.1 aswell.. This is not fixed yet, the issue described here is our workaround, because the icons started to disappear completely. The duplicate should be created once the icon is dropped on the homescreen, we currently create it as soon as the icon is picked up, which looks kinda weird tbh.. I like this, thanks a lot. Exactly the fix I wanted to implement, thanks a lot!. Translations are managed on crowdin ONLY. Please make your changes there.. The dock icon size can be adjusted already. We have tracked down the source of this bug and it should be fixed soon. @callmemulo the whatsapp bug is a known bug and we currently have no idea why it is happening. We can't help you if you don't use the issue template and give more detailed informations. This has been fixed on Crowdin and will be changed in our builds as soon as new Translations are imported. Not sure if this fits into our concept :thinking: . No Pixel 2 Features will be added before I have a new apk with the redesign. I didn't even notice this, but tbh I like it more in grey, it fits the overall look of the shortcuts way better imo. The Launcher is usually not supposed to be shown in recents, I know this is different on letv devices, but without owning such a device it is pretty hard to support this.. Duplicate of #786. Looks good to me too. ENABLE_LAWNFEED is supposed to be true for release builds as without it the swipe for google now will NEVER work, with it enabled it would be possible to make a custom Lawnfeed build to specifically work with the fdroid release.. @divadsn do we need changes to our travis script so the right flavour is built on our builds?. @haverholm I'd like the Pixel 2 and 5 bitcoins for xmas this year!\nJk, we'll see what we can do :). Duplicate of #786. Finally fixed with commit 678144787d9dd47e94fd6b6f50719f27cf4022c3. If you corrected the date format in Crowdin this should be fixed with the next import of translations. Did you give Lawnchair notification access?. To match the default pixel layout you could simply copy the default_workspace file from the pixel launcher. Also adjust this PR to not only change the defaults for the 5x6 layout but for all of them.. @divadsn I know, this happens almost everytime I import. We can not affect how Google Now / Google Feed looks, it is entirely provided by google.. @arkon \n\n. Duplicate of #535 . Can you please provide more information on what exactly triggers this behaviour? It is IMPOSSIBLE for us to fix, or even reproduce this with such a lack of information.. Apparently this was fixed on googles side in recent updates to the Google app.\nSource: Tested myself and feedback from Lawnchair users.\nThanks a lot Google \ud83d\ude09 . We are completely moving on to the 8.1 style in the Launcher3 style, for the Pixel Launcher specific features (like Searchbars, etc.) we will try to allow switching between them.. We can not affect what the Google Feed looks like, the new Google Feed is only visible inside Googles own launchers (or when not using any launcher with Google integration). The only way some Lawnchair users (and hopefully eventually all of them) is if Google decides to show it to you on their server.. You can change icon packs on a per-icon basis, this is a better solution than having different icon packs for different groups of icons.. As we have discussed on Telegram already this white gradient can currently be turned off manually with a switch, but personally think it would be great to replace said switch with your automatic method. But this would require some adjustments to your PR (like removing the switch, etc.). Locally reset the history and force push this branch, the PR will be updated.\nNow about the PR: @divadsn this should technically be fine/desired, as we also rebuild the db after any of the iconpack related settings change, so I guess this makes sense here.. Yeah sure, that sounds good. As @paphonb already mentioned in the Color extraction service which already exists there is actually indeed a brightness calculation because this is needed for the Dock color. Please add your calculations to that service so they only run once.. No comment on this one.. The tagline should just be one thing, a tagline. \"No Tagline needed\" is actually indeed our tagline (as you can also see on our website). If you want to know more about the concept of \"replacing the OS shell\" or about what the project is in detail I think something like this would rather belong in a README than in the repo description. Moved to #929. The internet permission is used to optionally display the current weather to the user.. Read the update changelog on the PlayStore, it tells you what to do.. @divadsn opening weather in the browser could simply be done by opening https://www.google.ch/search?q=weather in the browser. This would be the closest to opening the weather in the Google app we can do in the browser. @divadsn OWM currently only works with the custom location entered in the settings, so yes, we do store that \ud83d\ude09. Duplicate of #811 . Currently broken, the fastscroll bar is rendered weirdly and twice. The whole scrollbar implementation changed, so this is a backport of the entire thing. 8.1 source dropped, there are going to be simpler way to add this. We currently have a few problems supporting 8.1. Some wallpaper related APIs have been changed, but they are not very well documented (or atleast have not been before the 8.1 source dropped) We'll definetly look into this. Note for devs: This would probable require us to move to another (material if possible) color picker library, or if nothing appropriate can be found write our own library based on something like the one we are currently using. @jiccyy wrong place to request this. open a new issue if there is none for that already.. This feature has been completely removed in Android 8 afaik, before that it is possible to disable this in the PlayStore (as I have also personally done). I have already tried to add a toggle for this to Lawnchair, but somehow I have sofar failed to find the exact location of the reciever :wink: . EDIT 1: Added E-Mail as contact option. What are you exactly trying to do here?. These Strings are not translatable on purpose, to not blow up the Apk size with easter eggs too much. @Psyycker The search functionality on the PlayStore version is currently broken without the Google Now addon (Lawnfeed). This will be fixed in a future release. @momoe I think you should be able to do this with KWGT quite easily, as it is out of scope for Lawnchair imo. Wallpapers are actually not rendered by the Launcher, they are rendered by Android, the background of the Launcher is just set to fully transparent which makes the Wallpaper appear. So a Launcher technically has no way to affect the quality of a Wallpaper (unless of course you're only talking about wallpapers applied through the built in wallpaper picker). Like I have stated in my previous reply, wallpapers are not rendered by Launchers, but by Android, there is nothing we can do about this in Lawnchair. There are multiple existing issues open for this.. How are supposed to fix this if you do not provide any valuable information. Please use the issue template and provide us with usable logs, with that one sentence you provided we can NOT do anything.. Looks good to me codewise, in case nobody has time earlier I will test it on monday. Until then I would really welcome it if you could stash your commits.. @TiiXel Yep, shouldn't reply to Pull Requests while I'm almost falling asleep I guess ;). @TiiXel You can simply force push to your branch, it will update the Pull Request. It is a really nice concept art / design, but I don't think we want to go through yet another rebranding already. Thanks a lot for your effort though, it is always highly appreciated :+1: . @GAZ082 Long pressing on the drawer arrow directly focuses the search bar. @faroit You can set the app search to be the default action for pulling down. @faroit This option is available with the gesture options in V2. Google Now doesn't even use Google Awareness for their weather information (weird, I know, but it is google after all). So the weather information there will be different in some cases.. @jerryn70 Actually noticed this myself on my current setup, will be investigated ;). @divadsn updated the PR according to your comment, was able to reproduce after clearing data. This isn't really a DPI issue, depending on the icon size and count this can happen on all devices, I have already spent over 5 hours investigating this issue a while ago, but I have so far been unable to find the cause.\nIt happened with the original icon scaling algorithm, as well as with our custom, for adjustments improved completely rewritten algorithm.. By that I do not mean it can't be fixed, but just that maybe someone else than me might have more luck in solving it (wink, wink @divadsn, @paphonb). The trimming of the Date is probably related to something else actually, but it still is an issue nevertheless. Waiting for @divadsn's review :) you're free to merge after that . @divadsn That I forgot to do. Can be squashed and merged if the build succeeds!. @divadsn I only moved it for the transparent dock, this however is a screenshot of the dock turned off completely. This also fixes @divadsn's derps. Fixes for:\n\n\n\n. This has been fixed yesterdeay, see #1186 for reference. @Polomman Please keep this topic out of here. GitHub is a developer platform to discuss anything directly related to the development of Lawnchair. Your personal issues with other developers do NOT belong here, if this happens again you will be banned from commenting on our GitHub repos aswell. \nThanks for understanding. @papampi This is a bug introduced by google, we have no control over how the google now tab appears. Please rephrase your issue and add some screenshots and then open it again. Duplicate of #308 and other issues. @divadsn ... Like I told you I made a feature request for that in the library. @TheAndroidMaster is pretty much finished with adding support for more links e.g. twitter handles. \n\n\n\n\n. @iamdeep08 Applocks built into launchers are bullshit and not secure at all, they can be bypassed way too easily. More detailed explainations can be found in earlier issues on this topic.. DO NOT MERGE. Remove unused imports and this PR will be accepted. @baarkerlounger This has been implemented in V2 now. @HighRidas Quoting the official payment policy by GOOGLE (https://play.google.com/about/monetization-ads/payments/):\n\nDevelopers offering products within a game downloaded on Google Play or providing access to game content must use Google Play In-app Billing as the method of payment.\nDevelopers offering products within another category of app downloaded on Google Play must use Google Play In-app Billing as the method of payment, except for the following cases:\nPayment is solely for physical products\nPayment is for digital content that may be consumed outside of the app itself (e.g. songs that can be played on other music players).. @fonix232 If we don't offer a product at all we are definitely not offering a physical product or digital product which can be consumed outside of the app which means that it is not allowed. Stop arguing about it, apps have been taken down from the playstore or updates havent been approved for linking to paypal.. > Does Donut have a bug tracker somewhere?\n\nYep, in my E-Mail inbox (deletescape@gmail.com) \ud83d\ude09 \nClosing this issue now. @eggsgent We are not going to sync translations for V2 before we release a beta and the source. We have an open source plan with crowdin and don't wanna risk loosing that by uploading already. @eggsgent I think the language code we've been using for norwegian might be wrong as there are three different ones and they all fall back to something else from what I have seen. I will check it again before importing to V2 to make sure we're doing this properly :). @DennisBednarz Only the current recents provider/launcher can hide the back button. If you install Lawnstep (our magisk addon for pie recents) we are able to hide the button and provide our own recent apps screen. @QuintinAnderson Duplicate of other issues, closed. @KieronQuinn Thanks a lot for the report, I'm taking care of it. Updated my DMCA request again as it is up again. @NathanFrederick Icon shape change is currently not backported yet in v2. This should be fixed in the next alpha build. @source124 @paphonb we should probably base the date/time format either on an international standard or on the format provided by Locale.. @StormDuet You can change the icon shape in the Lawnchair settings and the chrome icon \"getting cropped out\" is simply the official chrome adaptive icon I assume. Also by the looks of it you simply personally don't like square icons which isn't really a bug anyways.. There is currently no intent to change the icon pack yet, this will be added soon however so we can support quick add from IconPack dashboards. That's what I mean in my earlier reply, I will implement this in our V2 source which is currently still closed source. Depending on how much work it would be I will also backport it to v1, but as that is mostly deprecated now and we want to get v2 out as soon as possible I don't think this will be worth doing. @mish0501 The format of the OxygenOS icon packs recently changed I believe, which is why they are not supported anymore right now. Support for them might be reintroduced later if I feel like looking into it.. @divadsn No, Lawnchair uses a Collator, currently not set up for fuzzy matching.. @PixelNotFound Can you use our issue template?. @DI555 Lawnchair v2 sources will be released on this same repository once we release a beta or stable build. @0pLuS0 This is due to the Google Awareness library being used as a possible weather provider in non F-Droid builds. This library is closed source by google, thus the label on F-Droid. @0pLuS0 Non F-Droid builds = PlayStore, XDA, GitHub or any other builds not on F-Droid\n1. Lawnchair is meant to be a customizable variant of the Pixel Launcher so it is always going to be \"googly\" to some point\n2. To get Lawnchair without any closed source Google libraries you can use the F-Droid version. @0pLuS0 Because only Upstream (official Lawnchair) contains the library it is labeled as \"upstream non free\". As we currently haven't yet provided a flavor for F-Droid in Lawnchair itself and only their fork does so. Okay, so I just read through your comments again, and I think you are missunderstanding a few things here\n\nI personally find it odd to find a weather app in a Launcher...\n\nThere is no weather app in Lawnchair, but to provide the pixel style built in widgets including weather (just like in the Pixel Launcher we are mimicking)  we need weather data from somewhere. For this we have multiple different providers, and because the Google Awareness does this in a simple way without using more data and battery this simply provides this for users that want to use this. Everyone else is free to use the Open Weather Map provider and Lawnchair will work just as nicely, but the weather data is slightly different because they obviously use different weather providers. Users like choices so we are giving them exactly that.\nIf you do not want the library to be included at all that is no problem and you can use the F-Droid version or build it yourself without it. \nIf there are any more questions feel free to ask in a normal manner, keeping out my personal life and mental health as it has absolutely nothing to do with Lawnchair.. @GAZ082 This option has been implemented in Lawnchair V2 already. @KasraIDK2 We have an option to minimize padding on our internal branch already, will be released with a few other fixes in a few hours. @eiarhabi This is a problem with miui, we will try to resolve this in the future if possible. @steviator Most of our last iteration for the latest alpha went into fixing bugs related to fixing the dock padding. the dock now perfectly matches that of the pixel 3 launcher (which yes, does have more padding to the searchbar than the pixel 2 launcher most of you are used to). An option to manually resize the dock to your liking is currently being worked on but wasnt yet functional enough to make it into our main branch for this alpha.. @BAProductions The best and easiest way to add Lawnchair to your ROM is by adding it as a prebuilt. @BAProductions You can find build of all our variants on apkmirror.com you can use as prebuilts. Can you check what this same data would look like in the Pixel Launcher / Google's at a glance widget?. @rodrigojcmello Alright, we'll try to get our implementation to align more with that of google. @hssahdev This is a known issue and will be investigated. @XenocodeRCE Yes, you are free to do with our source what you want and we can't restrict you from doing that. V2 also does not contain any checks for piracy apps anymore and we try to keep it as unopinionated as we can. @DevelopingZeus Closed it is not possible to support pie recents on Oreo. @mister-monster This is already possible. @mister-monster App drawer > search bar > show search bar. @amkcpu V2 sources will be released again in the next few weeks.. @kev-dev1 The startpage app is relatively bad and unfortunately doesn't have a way to directly start the search from another app. He didn't change preference keys, he just moved some preferences around, this one used to be located a bit further up in the file.. This equality should already be granted with the general equality check over Locale itself from what I can see. Could you please show an example of behavior before and after this patch and what the expected behavior is?. ",

Whatever, i will change my system language to english until i hate it...\ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude1c. it's finally fixed. thanks devs!!\ud83d\ude02. thats a shame. That's very useful indeed. This reminds me the localization bug i reported. Unfortunately deletescape said is not smth that can be fixed... So what's it gonna be? Whether you remove translations completely so that we have pure English ui or fix the language bug. It's so annoying, half ui in english, half in local language and changing after any action we do... plz do smth. Bug solution for mixed languages in the UI:\nSettings -> Pixel UI -> Change icon shape -> None\nOr use a costume icon pack!!. That also happens in original pixel launcher. Old story but the only way to bypass it is to move all apps in internal storage .. ohh yes! that's something i would also like to have. old style bubbles were really nice too. Thus mostly happens in costume dpi (pic is 340dpi, also tested in others like 390). Icon and text scaling isn't a matter, it happens in all different combinations. Only in stock dpi (360) everything seems ok. v1.1.0.1281 made the problem worst. Icon and title got a bigger gap and in result titles are cut-off also in stock settings (100% scale and 360dpi)\n. @Rawi666 the font is the stock one from xperia or Lawnchair. Not using any third party fonts, not rooted btw. So is this only happening on 6 inches screen with 1080p res?. @Rawi666 everything is set to default. I reverted back to 1.1.0.1265 as it handles way better this problem on default settings for now. @Rawi666 By default i set 100% icon+label scale and use 4columns + 4rows and its good, no problem. If i set 4columns + 5rows labels are a bit cropped. If i change also scale in icons and/or labels also they messed up. So only default settings work good for me, no costuming is bug-free. All that in default 360dpi. @Rawi666 ok, thats the best settings combo i like, icon+label at 100% and padding scale at 80%, at 360dpi. If i increase the number of rows in app drawer then i must decrease the label size or else they get cropped. Not tested though with different icon sizes or with different screen dpis. But, if you add this icon label scale slider in next release update it whould be nice. That way anyone will be able to adjust their settings as they look best in their devices.\n\n. @Rawi666 no problem, I'm glad that you managed to solve it\ud83d\ude09. @divadsn thanks dev. @divadsn when you consider to add that toggle sir?. try to disable icon costume settings, set to none, it's probably the localization bug i reported days ago... https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.enrico.launcher3. @callmemulo is it enabled from Lawnchair's settings?. @Rawi666 thats not correct. For me the calendar icon shows the daily number of the day even without enabling circular icons. Also the broken part in icon theming for me is the 2 options in icon masks, the \"do not change\" and also the \"none\" option do the exact same thing, nothing, more precisely. They revert icons to original none circular style. In past releases if i remember correct the \"do not change\" option had a different activity, it whould enable circular icons only for apps tha supported it. Now it does nothing.. there is still the language bug when choosing one of these options. These aren't gonna work on lower <7.1 system version. . yes that's logical, but i was wishing you could make a custom widget that copys the original... @Treemindr\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 you get the point though. This version probably will come with Pixel 2, or not... we will find out in a couple of days. Forgot of this thread...lol, lets wait for someone to upload the official apk at apkmirror. yes that is true:\n. Grey is way better. and widgets too, like Google search bar for example \ud83d\ude1c. you should try Another Widget, it's an app that mimics new date/calendar/weather widget from pixel\u00b2\nSearch on play store. ok but by closing this thread it means that it won't happen ever?. @fonix232only requests are posted.

My bad!. It's the default in Launcher3, the easy fix is to import Pixel Launcher's profiles in device_profiles.xml. I didn't add it because it is ugly IMO. https://github.com/VertexOS/android_packages_apps_Launcher3/commit/a30709ea01d3df9aa2c60ab692f16031a8036d08\nThis is the way PA does it in their (system-app) Launcher3, maybe it'll be of help.. As far as I know, Lawnchair V2 includes the backported app shortcuts by default.. Are you on Android 6 or older? Extracting from the Google app doesn't work on those versions.\n@paphonb and @deletescape consider adding the drawable to the app itself like this:\nhttps://github.com/amirzaidi/Launcher3/commit/d199f131a521ba8725482ff1e0ef799d82685b96. Use your PC to decrease your DPI with ADB.. Deleting that will make it show up in the recents screen on every phone which is not the behaviour I'd want. If you think that will fix it try compiling a build with that yourself. > the original pixel launcher v2.1 \nThat's not the original, that's my Launcher3 fork also known as Rootless Pixel Launcher. If it doesn't have the bug someone should perhaps take a look at my XML. In Pie the screen reordering feature has been removed entirely by Google, so this issue should not be necessary anymore..

Hold down to see shortcuts works but sometimes the animation skins frames or freezes for a second. Pressing the search widget has a second delay before opening. . Yeah, I agree. There shouldn't be a shadow under the app label and quickcut icon shouldn't have a shadow under it. \n\n. That was the Pixel Launcher from Android O. Did you select a different launcher to your default before trying to uninstall?. It's supposed to look like that.. In the Android 8.0 update, they switched the design to has transparency. Not sure why, but they did. Since Lawnchair backported all the features from 8.0, the pill has the same design.. I reflashed LineageOS and this issue seems to be fixed. \nSent from my Motorola Moto G4 Plus using FastHub. There's a blur feature? . I can't seem to find it.. Yeah, it probably would be very hard.. This has been fixed in a beta update. If you join the beta channel with Telegram you can use it.. It seems that Android 8.0 may have that feature in the works and if true than that might make it into Lawnchair.. Yep, same here. I was just about to create an issue.. I agree! I'd love to use the dark theme with the white shortcuts and search bar.. I think what he meant was when you switch the theme to dark or black, instead of using a colored G, you could toggle it to white. Honestly not a bad idea.. What version are you on?. Then you're not on the right version. If you want to try the weather option, you have to join the beta channel.. https://t.me/lawnchairchannel. Do you see a group called Lawnchair CI in Telegram?. Scroll down to the bottom. You have to join the beta channel. On LineageOS, if I enable \"Expanded Desktop\" (which is immersive mode on every app) I have this same problem.. I've heard that Flyme doesn't come with Google Services. Do you have the Google Services installed? If you don't, that's why Google Now isn't there. If you do have Google Services, this is a bug.. Closing since transparent dock doesn't drop the arrow down under the dock anymore, meaning this issue won't occur.. @fonix232 I have been trying to figure out how to fix that issue. I'm going search up how to fix.. @deletescape Added new images. @deletescape I have fixed the conflicts.. That happens on most launchers. It's normal. Oh, I thought you meant the icon shadow. Yeah, I see. I also have this problem.. @seven58o Very true. It would be nice if a toggle was added so if you don't like the feature, you can disable it.. This has been added in the latest build.. There are a lot of apps that can do this.. it's not possible to do. Would be a nice feature to have! . Duplicate of #666. Closing since we have this implemented.. Currently it's not added since it's buggy.. Do you by chance mean this? \n\n. @Aggro82 Enable blur which is in the General tab.. You made two posts of the same thing. #720 . Added in Lawnchair V2.. Are you using Google Wallpaper's daily wallpaper option?. @silentgurdian That one is different than the one on the Mi A1. The Mi A1 has an animation for a quick Google search when tapped and looks slightly different.. Could you possibly have an option to toggle in behavior settings?. @deletescape I knew that. I just copied the full message from Google+.. @carloabi Backporting shortcuts is a difficult task especially on lower version of Android and expect them to not work. Sure, other launchers can backport them but they still can't backport all.. @rickkode I agree, I was hesitant to post this because it's not that material but I did anyway since a few people seemed to want it.. Most likely not. Lawnchair can't control what Google does. The search bar comes from a modified Google APK.. @AxiK101 Oh I see. Yeah, it is a nice idea! By the way, it's custom, not costume.. @drew5494 The app drawer design is being worked on. #972 . Yep, I have the issue and others on G+ do too.. This has been added in so I'm closing this issue.. The Google search bar is already similiar to Sesame so I'm going to close this issue.. @deletescape I do agree, the black doesn't look too great.. I don't think it's possible right now because the new Pixel Launcher source isn't available yet.. Install version 808 and then install the latest version.. Works fine for me. Did you try rebuilding icon database?. See #786. I believe it's up to Google change it.. Travis doesn't seem to like my PR again... I'm not too great with coding so some help to fix it would be appreciated!. Could you change \"Blur radius\" to \"Blur amount\"? Some people get confused with that.. It's all coming... https://github.com/Deletescape-Media/Lawnchair/issues/786. @chinmaykunkikar I'm on 8.0, I use a theme called Pixel UI but this happens when it's disabled. Also, this isn't the widget menu from long pressing and then tapping widgets, it's from the app shortcuts menu. (Long press app, then tapping widgets icon). I've noticed this too. IMO the best fix would be having the separator line not bounce like the app icons.. @divadsn Will this give a download link to the latest version of Lawnfeed too?. @divadsn Nova Launcher has this feature too. It's actually quite useful.. This is normal behavior. The privacy check was never removed.. If I simply change a setting in the settings menu, it creates a blank page. I don't need to rebuild icon database.. @ChillMasterT It seems that all of them cause this issue.. @Younes-L Since the Pixel 2 shortcuts were added.. This would make the menu look cluttered IMO.. Is this the full scroll bar or just the bubble with the letter?. Seems like blur is one of the culprits.. Closing since Lawnchair V2 has this implemented.. It's not that big of a deal since no one else has complained about it, but\nI can reopen if you want.\nOn Wed, Mar 14, 2018, 12:31 PM David Sn notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@reC0D3D https://github.com/rec0d3d Boi, it's on v1...\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/Lawnchair/issues/985#issuecomment-373147204,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AclHy2tIkH52px9i2CWUOS33yTVx6fhaks5teXAhgaJpZM4Q43gR\n.\n.

Don't worry about the \"Add font file\" and \"Delete font\" commits, those were early tests for a different project.. @divadsn Motorola widgets work. I'll test Samsung widgets now.\n\nEdit: Samsung widgets work fine. Codacy is probably upset due to adding a simple space to the code. Build works fine so it shouldn't be a problem.. A simple workaround would be to open the Play Store, slide out the side menu, tap settings, then uncheck \"Add icon to Home screen.\". You can't move it to the bottom. Alternatively, you can place a custom widget instead.. We already have a design for our next icon. While this icon is nice, it's not going to be used since we've picked our next design.. That's what Lawnchair v2 is all about!. We can't control how you interact with the Google Feed. This is a Google issue. If you would like, you can submit a bug report to Google.. For v2 I assume? Go into app drawer settings and unselect \"Google search\". This is something we have on our to-do list and have made some process on it.. I support this idea. Sounds interesting.. There are no translations because we haven't added other languages to V2 yet. It's just an alpha.. You can already change the icon shape in V2, unless you mean porting it?. You can change it by long pressing the icon, tapping edit, tap system icons (or which icon pack your using), and select the correct icon.. We're following Google's approach to Material Design. In the recent Android P DP4, Google used outlined icons everywhere which first started with the Pixel Launcher, which is what Lawnchair is mimicking. As a designer myself, I like the outlined icons more than filled in ones.. This is a Google issue, not a Lawnchair issue. The Google search menu is part of the Google app and only expects to be opened by the Pixel Launcher so it doesn't have support for other launchers. If you want this menu to work correctly, you can install the Pixel Launcher but still keep Lawnchair as the main launcher, it'll work since the Pixel Launcher is present.. That's because it's going to be used as a preview for backups. It's currently work in progress.. This is intended behavior for this option.. The Pixel Launcher doesn't use the seconds hand which Lawnchair reflects in v2. The seconds hand would also increase RAM usage.. Yeah, it doesn't need to be changed. It's already added up a bit like what Till said,. ",
    "RWOne": "Why not change the app name and allow it's weather to display, seems easier.... You're welcome! . I can confirm this behavior as well. Just had it disappear on me and swiped up, when I swiped down the drawer, the pill rendered on refresh.\nN6, stock 7.1.1. @deletescape , sorry Til, did a search, this one came up top so.... @AxiK101 Unfortunately not, it is the Dev's choice. If internally matched to pixel launcher it will grab the weather, its been demonstrated in other pixel launcher apps ported to AOSP launcher, such as Amir's:\nhttps://github.com/amirzaidi/Launcher3/releases/\nI'm only wondering at the reasoning, it may be easier to just allow it to grab the pixel weather and turn time to other custom edits, etc.\n. Also, if that folder on the additional screen is moved to the 1st screen, it then shows blur.. Confirm the app caret below dock on transparency, but is that so bad?\nScreen indicators are gone as well, but I don't miss 'em .... Location works fine for me, I think it's good there between the dock and navbar .... Yes.. ~Badges were not introduced on 7.0, you need to be on 7.1.x variant.~. Why?\nYou have widget picker by long pressing an app now, or a long press of the home screen and select widgets.\nI'm it would be wasted space to take up one page.. @fonix232 Haven't seen that myself ...  But I have maybe two widgets in use, so ....   :). This launcher is similar to stock.\nTo remove a screen, remove all its items.\nThe home screen will always be the first one when started, with feed to left and additional screens added as you drag items to it in overview.. Can you elaborate?\nYou mean app shortcuts?\nApp shortcuts are functional.. @AxiK101 They're working, if you are not seeing them, set the Lawnchair launcher as the default.\nSettings -> Search for home, select home app and select.. See above, set launcher as the default, then retry.. No one's calling you anything. Lose the attitude at the door, or let it close behind you when you leave.\nMay be a device specific thing then, stock 7.1.1 working here.. There may not be one, app shortcuts were introduced in 7.1.X, may not be backportable.. Sometimes backing out after making a change to the app it no longer shows, in this cases I just went to debug and restarted the app.. I don't have that issue with the calendar, but I'm using another cal app to open links by default if that helps .... Stock?\nWorks here, add clock to a homepage, either analog or digital.\nPress on it and I'm in the app.\nOr did I miss something?. @ominousjest Can you post a screenshot of what you are looking at in the top right?\n. It happens, no worries. But by default it is supposed to open the cal, Since the other bug notice is with GCal with the event msg, I have mine set to open my 3rd party cal app, and it's fine.. @G0ldenSp00n, well, the first time I hit it having GCal and (in my case) Business Calendar, I was prompted with which app to use by default to open the link.\nNexus 6, stock 7.1.1 .... Related, can the shaded area of the nav bar be darkened slightly more when the app drawer is expanded?\nNot an issue if a dark theme is used, but IMHO against a light background, just a touch more to bring it out, right now it is transparant and the icons look washed out against the rest of the white background in the drawer.\nAn example would be to scroll the drawer down and see the grey color of the bounce animation versus what the nav bar background is now.. More info needed, latest build is 818.\nStock N6, 7.1.1, on 818, can't duplicate using chrome. Shortcuts added to screen and when used opens fine.. I think it comes down to blur or no blur, I'm good either way.\n@paphonbth, dumb question, newbie on GitHub, but how might I test new builds? (In thinking I don't have the knowledge to compile, but who knows? :) ). Thanks! Will look into it.... True, perhaps what the OP wants is a black (or I would suggest a shade of grey) Google Icon choice in the Google Pill instead of the multicolored one.   White on white would look .... unwise.  :). I agree, the multicolored \"G\" looks terrible on anything but white.. Long press the app from the app drawer, or long press an app to grab it's shortcuts if available and then drag it out to a home screen.. Set lawnchair as default launcher and retry.. Can't dupe here.\nPost phone, room or stock etc ........... Yes, thanks!. Confirmed here, likely they are aware of it and the location based refresh requests .... Related, it states entering a country code, could the description show an example? I wouldn't know to do 1, 01 or +1, +01 before City and state in my case .... \"The issue is that if I change my launcher to another launcher and then want to set it back to lawn chair I can not easily do this.\"\nIn Android:\nSettings -> Type \"Home\" in search or go directly to \"Home App\" Then:\nIn Home app, select the default.\nNothing needs to change in the launcher here.. Packing features that can already be accomplished thru the OS isn't needed, coding time and energy can be used to get features and s things one cannot already perform thru the OS.. Ahh Till, sorry, it's early morning here, just did that \u263a\ufe0f and was posting to close when you did .... I hesitantly post to agree.\nIf I leave the phone alone for over 30 minutes to an hour, opening, the widget is the same, toggling to calendar and back it remains the same, though a check of my GNow feed, or pressing to get to the weather page, shows the weather and updates in some cases, but the widget remains at what it was.\nI know this is large feature to integrate, I'm also not sure if, we use the Google API to blank out the city field, or leave it with a country code and city. I'm patient enough to wait as you awesome dev's look at it, or educate us as to usage, etc.\nI think that the overall app development has been fantastic!  My hope is, that if there are still issues implementing it, those can be overcome ... . @hassie-dash, Thank you for the detailed explanation!\nI did some research myself and see where Google killed access to the API directly, they whacked a lot of third party apps back then due to that, sigh ...\nThanks for being patient and indulgent, now that we know the score, we'll just have to buck up and live with the best implementation you guys can give us.  :). I think it's like what I posted in the community thread, OCD - one opens weather an you want it all to be synched right then and there,but we'll have to accept things as they are...\nIt's still the best launcher out there.  :). Agreed, at first I thought it wasn't moving at all, I installed near the top of the hour, but the hour hand was still near the previous one. (3 versus nearer to 4, and didn't \"jump\" to 4 on the hour change).\nI apologise, for it being 4am, I need to go unconscious again, so I can't wait long enough to confirm if my hour hand is moving at all here, when I wake I'll recheck. \ud83d\ude09\n.

Yes I can do that this backup to Google is not a big deal I just thought if it's an easy thing to do it would be a simple at to back everything up without having to do any config. This is how Evie handles this issue, a note in the app drawer telling the user lawnchair is not the default launcher and promoting the user to click to set Evie as the default launcher. I would propose doing the same in lawnchair, this makes it easy if your like me and experiment information and comparing different launchers.\n\n.

What about hte second question?. ",
    "ghost": "@deletescape You don't really need to use the app as a system app.. You could use the Device Administrator option like Nova Launcher does:\nhttp://imgur.com/a/QiLHf. Yes that was my suggestion, maybe I was unclear when I wrote it :p. I already said that I'm on 7.0 .. well I hope you'll find another way to implement this in 7.0 version. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a. Ooo.. I wasn't paying attention to the title. Sorry about this. @TokedUp If you are on 7.0 the other shortcus won't work as deletescape said above.. So we must wait for him to make them work on Android 7.0 . Oh.. My bad :)\n\nHiding in corner *. @monreal\n\nIf you look at the shortcuts UI is different than Lawnchair UI so I think this is the problem. And I think Google change the Shortcuts code so is different than Pixel Launcher from Android 7.0 .. What I mean by small screens is phones with less then 200 DPI. the bug has been fixed so i am going to close this. Pretty sure every other launcher except this one doesn't have this bug not just Nova. @lunsarn After checking, I guess most other 3rd party launchers have this bug as well. (Action launcher and even google now launcher).\nMaybe the developer of nova can explain how he fixed it because previous versions of nova had this bug as well.  . It'd be closed if we knew.. Personally I stopped noticing it.. Using the dark theme helps make them look better. @RWOne\nHe's right. I had an issue asking about this and the dev said that there are not available on 7.0 or lower. The app shortcuts got introduced on 7.1.1 but some launchers made them work on 7.0/6.0.\nWell those launchers use the old UI for App Shortcuts from Pixel Launcher Nougat version. So or the dev didn't look into this or the code for shortcuts also have been changed and for now there's no way to bring this feature on 7.0 or lower.. @deletescape Could you try what KieronQuinn said above?. This happens to me too.. That doesn't mean it works for everybody. Why was this issue closed?\nYou can see it the picture I attached that Lawnchair says it's sunny outside but it's the middle of the night. Also the temperature, indicated by google, is 24 degrees. The weather can be fixed only by restarting Lawnchair (it will show a moon after restarting and the correct temperature).\n\n. The weather did not auto-update after 8 hours and a change in temperature by 10 degrees.. 4: Ability to hide status bar. Same here... Just don't run\nSent from my Google Nexus 6P using FastHub. On my Nexus 6P, notification badges are working fine. This app actually doesn't apply settings properly. If you change some seeing and it doesn't get applied, clear the app's data and try again. It's just unpredictable. So, keep trying to apply what you want.. *some setting. I've noticed this issue as well. I don't want to say that the app is draining significantly, but if my Nexus 6P heats up even just a little bit with the app running in the background or not at all, then that tells me something is up. I could try pulling a logcat and see what's up.. #694 basically sums this issue up. There is no proper support for Oreo yet it seems, which is ironic considering the Pixel features was backported from Oreo.. I suppose you don't mind if the project is forked to remove the telemetry then?. See #582 . Did you try using any other launcher and see if the lag persist? I don't see how a launcher can cause any lags on the apps. . I'll be glad when this is fixed. It is not easy to determine when a possible fix has been released.. Why hey to crap\nShould be bye bye. i will not tell. But there is a good reson. I know tgat why i an spamming aglfter half ot 1 hour. I think it is 20/hour. I would also like this feature. At this point, the Talkback screen reader doesn't recognize the notification dot, and I miss the new notification count from stock launchers I've had on other phones I've had in the past.. Actually, it's not a question of style, it is a question of possibilities. More customization options = more satisfied users. Also, there can't be enough editing functions as well - inserting or at least reordering home screen pages is a very important part of this game.\nI like this launcher, stable, and almost has the minimum feature set I need. :-) Struggling with changing to it, though. The most used layout by me is to have the default home screen (available by pressing the Home button again, as well) in the middle, this way the neighbor pages with more important widgets and icons can be reached faster than the neighbors of neighbor ones, and so on. There are things that just cannot be made better, only worse - at the expense of being followers, being similar to others in some topics, I admit.. Yes, the truth is somewhere in the middle, I'm aware. I just tried to shift the reality to fit to me a bit better. :-). But as you can see, my opinion still is, that this exact feature improvement well worth the hassle.. Please note that this crash doesn't occur when an item is moved around on the screen. It only occurs when Talkback is used to move the item. So in order to reproduce the crash, enable Talkback in the accessibility settings first. Then use Talkback's local context menu to move an item by flicking a finger on screen up and then to the right quickly, tapping actions and then tapping move item, followed by the position on screen where you want the item moved. The voice will say \"item moved,\" and then the crash will occur. I just confirmed this here on my Moto E4 running Android 7.1.1, latest stable Lawnchair from Play Store.. Sorry, each tap I mentioned should be a double tap with Talkback's default settings. I forget that I use single tap mode here, which is not the default, and has for some years been considered experimental, though it works well for me.. I also support think it would look interesting :). Could always just add\n<link\n             name=\"Donate\"\n             icon=\"@drawable/ic_donate\"\n             url=\"https://paypal.me/name-of-account\" />\nto the attriboutor.xml in the the appinfo section. also any contributor could add their own link under their info.\nThen add the attached ic_donate.png to the drawer folder.\nWouldn't really be an In-App-Purchase just another link, like the twitter or github links but, to PayPal.me with an empty amount so people can choose how much to donate.\nic_donate:\n\nExample:\n. google picks and chooses. lol i understand not wanting to take the risk, though, a link to paypal.me shouldn't be viewed as an IAP. Technically the donation is made in the users web browser application. \nEbay and Amazon are on the PlayStore and they have thousands of items up for purchase, in-app. . not arguing. discussing. if you named the button SHIT and it happened to open up paypal.me you're not asking or offering anything. its a SHIT button thats opens a website. googles become too power hungry. it was intentionally worded the way it is. the paypal app is in the playstore i can send money right now through the app and its not an in-app purchase.. goFund me is literally an app that has a million donation links in it and it doesn't offer in-app purchases. or purchases through google pay specifically. Its just googles way of keeping small apps from making anything without paying google. big companies get away with it because they're invested in them. lol my 'issue' isn't with you guys not wanting to risk a ban. that's understandable. my issue now is with google changing their policies every 3-6 months and having no choice but follow. that's all from me for now lol. have good day, or night, wherever you are.. . I can't find the option either. Maybe it's because I'm not on oreo?. @divadsn I'm on nougat.. @JonnyTech yeah, I know that, but that's a workaround, not a solution.. Then.. feature request, I guess?. Uhm.. ok. ",

Numbering them makes it hard to track (for pure reference we have the actual issue number, e.g. this is issue #84), and is also quite annoying.\nAnd please make use of the search feature. If you continue to duplicate existing issues, you will be restricted from posting further issue reports. This is your first, last and final warning.. Please define small screen (physical size, DPI, et cetera). I have an S8, and I noticed little to no lag (though Samsung did screw up the software causing erratic scrolling and drawing behaviour in many places).. It seems like an improper padding is applied. Could you please detail your settings (device, original DPI, your custom DPI)?. It makes sense, however it won't be a default feature, especially since the app drawer is only available by pulling up (which makes the exact point of when to open the keyboard neigh impossible to set). For now, this won't be added.. I'll see if I can make the widget reload when the column number changes, so it automatically resizes.\nAs for the gray bar, it can be removed, might make it an option later on.. Do not merge yet!. The same happens with all Launcher3 derivatives in my experience. Will see if it is intentional or an actual bug.. That's the very intended feature of \"Hidden apps\".. @deletescape one thing is for sure, our love for you is not because of your consistency \ud83d\ude02 . Would be nice if you provided some further details. It does not happen to neither me, nor to @deletescape AFAIK. Phone model, OS version, etc. would be nice to know (also, Lawnchair version).. Additional info such as device type, OS version, et cetera.\nLooking at your logcat, I can see that you had an old version of Lawnchair installed, and there are some warnings due to that (some permissions are not granted, and might be related to this).. It's not technically a bug, since it works as intended. It's not a feature, because not all devices benefit from this. So what remains is enhancement, which is technically \"polishing existing features\".. We are aware of this issue still existing, I've reopened #81. Please let's continue discussion there!. @uudruid74 Please take back on your tone.\nLawnchair is primarily a Pixel launcher, bringing the looks and feels of the Pixel to other phones, with some extra features missing from the original. Your use case is pretty unique, and the few others who also use it that way tried to help.\nWe're actively looking into bugs and crashes, hence why we switched crash logging recently, but our main attention is on streamlining the whole structure of the code, getting rid of legacy overcomplicated Launcher/Launcher2 bits (and even some Launcher3 stuff), and fixing it up so it doesn't crash. After that we can consider looking at the lesser bugs (since this one is certainly a bug, but not something that makes use of the launcher impossible). I'm marking it as an enhancement for now, so that it won't end up in our pretty tight 0.1 milestone accidentally. But don't worry, all valid open issues will be considered. Just don't forget that we're a small team working in our free time on this project, expecting nothing in return but politeness.. I will gladly merge this as soon as another Chinese-speaking contributor confirms it contains proper translations. Also, thanks for the contribution \ud83d\udc4d . @ljxprime please use our Crowdin project to publish your translations! I'm closing this PR.. This might be implemented as an option in the future, but not for now.. No need to close the issue, I just indicated that this will be considered at a later point. Since the \"issue\" is not solved, it should stay open :). It works fine for me, no matter where I swipe from. Widgets/icons do interfere with this though.. @Ochach Samsung uses their own framework for persistent notification badge display. We haven't reversed it yet, as we are aiming on fixing actual bugs and not making new enhancements and features. However this is already on our to-do list.. Lawnchair does not aim to be another of the overkill theme-able skin-able chinese Launchers. We intend it to be free of clutter, fast, basic, but providing well-sought features (such as the Google Now page).. With this amount of details, no. Please detail which actions are slow (e.g. moving icons, opening app drawer, etc.), what phone you're using, which Android version, and which ROM (stock or something custom?).. By the looks of it, the notification receiver tries to access notifications, but @Mr-KIYFD haven't given Lawnchair access to them, thus an exception is thrown. This seems to be MIUI-specific though.\n@Mr-KIYFD can you please try and enable notification access, and see if it still crashes? Just want to verify my theory (can't reproduce it on my S8).. I'd also suggest to remove all unused strings and resources from the app, for easier management.\nFor translations, I'd suggest to use either Crowdin or Localize.im - I'd prefer Crowdin since I have experience with it, and it is free for open source projects.. @wyjek for a PR, you need to fork the project, make modifications to the alpha branch, and when you're done, press the big \"Create pull request\" button in your fork's header area.. @Wolforpion stuff like %1$, %2$ are parameters. They come from a different part, and should be kept within the translation too. E.g. if you translate (Show widgets) (where widget is the parameter already in place), you need to put the parameter to the proper place.. Guys, if anyone makes another \"I can translate to X\" comment, I'm gonna close the discussion on the ticket... Stop talking and go to Crowdin for translation, it's much more appreciated!. @rimasx I've added Estonian, feel free to start translating!. Please see #175 for translations!. Just a slight correction, that's a rounded rectangle. A squircle is a shape between a circle and a square. See attached.\n\n\n. Are you using a live wallpaper?. We're not using the Makefile, so this change is not necessary. @RWOne the reason is that we want to get Lawnchair on the play store soon, and such, package name cannot match the Pixel Launcher's.. I was only able to reproduce this one time on my Galaxy S8. It is probably a bug coming from the animation framework as our animations are well defined and work just fine 99% of the time.. @RWOne I think @ACHOKAMAN  means that we would have a vertically scrolling list of custom widgets - i.e. you can decide what to put into the list, something like the OnePlus Launcher does on their leftmost panel.. Lawnchair has no control over the notification icon displayed.. Sesame uses an app-specific approach with \"hard coded\" methods. Basically on API25 apps, they can define custom methods to dynamically generate the shortcuts (the part we can't do on API<25), and can also define static links (which we can, and do display). What Sesame does is basically extracting the former methods and moving it to a common library, so that the apps don't have to define it. It is practically a huge database of functions that define shortcuts for certain apps, nothing more. We can't do that.. We do not have control over the behaviour of Google Now.. Since O is not finalized yet, and we do not have devices to test such bugs, I'd refrain from promising anything regarding such issues. After the official release of O, with the finalized APIs and subsystems, if this still happens, we will look into it.. @deletescape Please review PR #806, and if all's good, we should merge & release to F-Droid (and soon after that, Play Store).. 1. Work on the adaptive icons, including custom icon masks (circle, squircle, rounded rectangle, teardrop, etc.)\n2. Please go into detail. Two words do not say the exact thing you want.\n3. Features are already backported...\n4. This is being considered too\n5. Doubt that this is a good idea, since launchers have different layouts (56, 45, etc.), and transformation requires quite a lot of work on the logic.. Duplicate of #40 \nPlease use the search feature before submitting a feature request!. Auto rotate and tablets are generally not supported (yet), since we don't have layouts for them.. I believe @spirit9 is talking about the shortcuts' text shadow that was\nfixed a while back.\nOn Sat, Jul 22, 2017, 04:46 paphonbth notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nMore details?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/Deletescape-Media/Lawnchair/issues/275#issuecomment-317148862,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAWsh4fWiLsh0RIusABpHGn7yoO2JJV1ks5sQWKcgaJpZM4OgCzG\n.\n. @AxiK101 please try to keep unrelated questions out of the issue ticket\nsystem!\n\nOn Sun, Jul 23, 2017, 02:01 anxnenko notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nIt's \"Antimo\" from Sikebo Giraz.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/Deletescape-Media/Lawnchair/issues/280#issuecomment-317218505,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAWsh3yZFTj13XC4UdP7i2poTThEDsfqks5sQo1kgaJpZM4OgOEC\n.\n.

Please try to not derail the topic.\n@Rufus85 This seems to be an EMUI related bug. Since AFAIK none of us has Huawei devices, I doubt we can reproduce the issue. Can you please use our issue template and go into detail?. Duplicate of #240 . Also, notification dots, mainly because it's a not too optimized backport (and a quite hacky one on <8.0), consume ~100MB extra RAM. Without those, your TEAM usage will be around 50MB too.. We are using Microsoft's Azure Mobile for very basic telemetry - the app checks in basic information to see our target demographics, all of them are non-invasive and do not contain any information that can be used for personal identification.\nThe included information are:\n\nDevice manufacturer and model\nApp version\nAndroid version\nCountry (based on the IP address, at the moment about 50% of the users' countries cannot be determined)\nSession count (how many times the app is opened, etc.)\n\nThis telemetry is for us to see which countries use the app the most, which versions fixed, introduced or re-introduced issues, and of course, crash logs for issues.\n@guest4711 the kind of telemetry we are doing does not fall under the german DPA laws, since it requires apps to abide by it if they publish personal information. Since NO personal information or any kind of identifier is established (apart from the instance-specific Azure ID of the device, so that an issue chain can be tracked - this ID is generated during install, and removal of the app will result in a new ID if reinstalled) that can pinpoint a specific user, this does not fall under the DPA laws you mention.. Last time I checked, the Azure Mobile SDK provides no way to reset the ID, though I have to admit that I never checked for this.\nHowever since we're not using the data for anything else than bettering Lawnchair (i.e. we're not selling anything that comes in, especially since it has no market value), and we're not receiving any personal information.\nFor the time being, we will leave this as-is - a little telemetry does not hurt anyone, especially since most users are unable to report problems in a developer-comprehensible format, where such logs are the main sources of diagnostics and troubleshooting.. Lawnchair uses no native elements whatsoever, and such, compiling against x86 targets won't solve the issue. This seems eerily specific to Asus devices (though it might be because only Asus chose to run Android on Intel's chipsets).. This is a quite weird behavior, something I haven't noticed before.\nCan you try to achieve a way of reproducing it?. Use the issue template, otherwise your report is invalid.. @divadsn actually most manufacturer Launcher3 forks (Sony, Samsung, LG) support having multiple empty pages.. This is a well known issue. Please use the search feature before opening a new ticket! Thanks!. The official Pixel Launcher uses different weather information methods, and thus can update differently.\nAs for the Google Awareness weather provider... Unfortunately Google made it so that even if the location changes considerably, weather only updates if the temperature difference between current reported and last known (i.e. displayed) is 3 degrees or higher. So you can easily get on a plane in sunshine, 18\u00b0C, and arrive in a tropical storm, 17\u00b0C, and it won't update.. The template is not there for you to ignore. Fill it out properly please.. @guest4711 I believe it isn't the repo maintainers' issue that someone can't use a client that actually works. My point still stands, either use the template or GTFO.\nBesides, since I receive e-mail updates about all activities, I can see that @ygorigor has had the template, then decided to remove it and keep only the device info, providing no information about his issue whatsoever.. Too much of Lawnchair's features depend on API21, thus backporting it to devices running Android KitKat or older is not possible.. 1. Search the damn issue tracker before posting a request. This feature has been requested multiple times, posting it again and again won't bring it forward on the list of tasks to do.\n\nUse the issue template.. I especially like this comment the guy left \ud83d\ude06 \n\n\n. You can't attach images when you reply to the issue with an e-mail.. Ignore this. @divadsn would it be possible to catch the SD card init event and reload the app list/icons when that happens?. I hate it when manufacturers hinder base functionality and require developers to get in touch with them to have it fixed. This is the worst thing they can do to Android.\nWe will get in touch with Essential to have Lawnchair whitelisted once we're on the Play Store.. Please use English and the issue template for posting issues. Thanks.. The issue template is not there for you to ignore. Please use it.. I'm pretty sure it does not fit into any piece of MDL.. This is a known issue and we have found no way around it as of now.. Duplicate of #665 . This is a known issue of the Pill implementation we have - for some reason certain changes trigger it to reload and it can't reload successfully all the time.. Unless you actually use the issue form, we won't know what your problem is.. Please stop opening issues that are NOT actual issues/feature requests. This is NOT a message board or a chatroom.. This is an intended behaviour, detailed in Google's own Android design guidelines. I do not think we should break the current workings just so it works the same way as the letv launcher.. As I said before, such behaviour goes against Google's own design language.. @dimqua once you add said fixes, I think merging can go on and we can release on F-Droid ASAP.. @divadsn what is your status on this?. Right now this is not a priority. Please stop posting meaningless issue tickets. One more time and you'll be banned from accessing this repo. Use the Telegram channels for information.. Your issue seems to be related to blur, more specifically, blurring the wallpaper (for e.g. the dock). \nSince Android stores the original image and allows one to access it, Lawnchair uses that instead of capturing the current screen and blurring the capture. This means that a set wallpaper's original will be used for blurring, which is indeed quite large (6MP), which causes a memory overflow.\nA temporary fix would be switching to a different launcher, or resetting your wallpaper, or resetting Lawnchair so it does not use blur while you change wallpaper.\n@deletescape I believe there should be an exception catch at ch.deletescape.lawnchair.blur.BlurWallpaperProvider's blur method so such issues in the future are caught.. @AubreyKilian you could've gotten to Settings and wipe Lawnchair's settings :) Either way, we'll look into this.. Please do not use the issue tracker for anything else than issue reports and feature requests. Endorsements, discussions, etc. should all go on our official Telegram channel.\nThis is your first, last, and final warning. Misuse of the issue tracker will not be tolerated, on the next infraction I will have to restrict your access to the repository.. This has been requested multiple times. Opening new issue tickets won't bring this issue to the top of the queue. Duplicate of #665 . I believe this is because Lawnchair's main activity does not rely on device-supplied default orientation (i.e. landscape on landscape-designed tablets, portrait on portrait-designed tablets, etc.), but uses fixed portrait and landscape options:\nhttps://github.com/Deletescape-Media/Lawnchair/blob/alpha/app/src/main/java/ch/deletescape/lawnchair/Launcher.java#L385\n@deletescape I might look at this during the weekend unless it is fixed by then :). It's been already posted. Search before opening these tickets ffs. This is not the first time.... The Play Store version uses the package name ch.deletescape.lawnchair.plah, whereas the regular Travis builds (so pretty much anything else than the Play Store APK) uses ch.deletescape.lawnchair. You can install them side-by-side, and they have their own respective settings.. Lawnfeed is only required for Release builds, which are also only Play Store specific as of now.. @AxiK101 Yes, and it will never be that smooth since it requires proxying through an extra app.\nLawnfeed crashes are being investigated, and you flooding every.fucking.ticket with it does not help the case.. The code is available through the official Google git repository of all Android code.. As @divadsn said, this repo is not for supporting other developers work on their projects, but for issues regarding Lawnchair, and ONLY Lawnchair.\nFor all the others: we gladly answer questions that come in on the appropriate channels. The Lawnchair issue tracker is not one of those.. Looks good to me. @tvteja just get over it. Lawnchair will not allow possible piracy (i.e. using icon packs) when there's a chance of the icon pack being pirated, by using a third party tool (like Lucky Patcher), it WILL disable the icon pack feature.\nGo and look into the code, the list of apps triggering it are pretty clearly stated. And I don't see how you'd need Lucky Patcher, or Uret patcher - which are pretty much the only packages currently blacklisted. So either remove these apps - because you don't need them for development at all - or stop fucking whining.. I don't think it is necessary. Looking at the features list, each and every\npermission is easily explained. E.g. internet - weather. Location -\nweather. And so on.\nOn Mon, 20 Nov 2017 at 17:23 Hocceruser notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nAs I've written, an easy explanation...\nNow, what do you think of my proposal (explaining this on the Google Play\npage)?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/Deletescape-Media/Lawnchair/issues/945#issuecomment-345747544,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAWsh9gCWQH1dILE0jbTpHDF3HgZ-QMEks5s4admgaJpZM4QkaFn\n.\n.

As @divadsn said, it is already fixed and something is amiss on your end.\n\nLet's go into detail. That text is only written if:\n- The Lawnfeed check is ran\n- Lawnfeed is installed\n- Lawnfeed version is lower than defined (currently, v1655 is the minimum)\nThe Lawnfeed check is only ran if the ENABLE_LAWNFEED BuildConfig option is true - but on CI builds, it defaults to false, and cannot be true, hence the check is never actually done.. Thank you Seppe, you made it clear you can't act like a grown-up. You can stop spamming now.. There's already an issue ticket open for this, #666 \nPlease do not open duplicate issues! It just makes life harder :). I have double checked the code responsible for this popup, and there's no way this happens if the Lawnfeed package (or any other package with the same package name) doesn't exist on the device. \nThe checks are here, first statement disables Lawnfeed integration on CI (non-Play Store) builds, the second one runs a few tests:\n\nChecks if the Google app is enabled, if not, won't load Lawnfeed\nChecks if the Lawnfeed app (or any other app with the same package name since we don't do signature checks) is installed and enabled\nChecks if the Lawnfeed app's version is higher than 1655\n\nThe only time this code runs if the ENABLE_LAWNFEED variable is set (only on Play Store builds), and the package is not a \"dev\" variant, and if the version is above 1655. There's simply not a possible scenario where this screen is displayed without Lawnfeed, or any other app sitting on the same package name, being installed.. This needs to be fixed ASAP, @divadsn do something!. This won't be implemented, since pulling down in the app drawer will either scroll towards the beginning, or if on top, close the app drawer.\nAs for moving the search bar to the bottom, it wouldn't be helping since to follow Material guidelines, the search box would need to be on the same level as the app shortcuts, dropping the search bar to the very end of the app drawer.. That latest commit should fix this issue on future builds.. Samsung widgets work fine on my Note8 using Oreo - however Samsung did change some things with Oreo (e.g. now we can place the Weather widget from 3rd party launchers, previously it wasn't possible).\nSince I can't reproduce it, I'd like to ask those of you who still experience this (@AlyamanMas10  and @Frontear) to try and grab some ADB output while trying to place such a widget.. Made a small recording of my own. Freshly installed Lawnchair from Play Store, completely stock Note8 on Oreo (Exynos dual SIM variant). See here. Widgets can be easily added even after resizing the grid or enabling full screen widgets.. That's why I changed rows mid-video. First is default, then Samsung's values.. @asherpen commenting the same shit on every ticket will just gonna get you blocked from the repos. This is your first and final warning.. It is indeed expected, afaik the blur provider uses integers for steps instead of decimals to provide faster drawing.\nInstead of the current setup I'd like to recommend using the screen height/total movement distance for blur steps (e.g. drawer pulling up on a 1920px height, with the drawer being, say, 320px, would mean 1600 distinct steps).. It does not match the Pixel/AOSP/Material style Lawnchair is going for. I doubt this will be implemented ever.. @BeatPlay Samsung used the meta tag we added with @divadsn a few weeks ago, on Nougat. I checked on Oreo and it is indeed not working, most likely Samsung changed something.\nNova achieves this with hackery, yes, forcing immersive mode onto the app. While I understand that for many this is an aching point, I don't think we should introduce hardcoded workarounds for platform-specific issues. \nSo the answer would be, we won't fix this, as this is the intended behaviour. If a meta tag can fix it, then we can add it, but I myself won't add platform or OEM specific workarounds, and I highly discourage @deletescape @divadsn and @paphonb from doing so too.. IMO the amount should denote the maximum number of items, and otherwise center it like the image posted. It's the default on pretty much all the major launchers, including stock ones, and users expect this behaviour - the number setting might be misleading since it means the maximum number in other cases.. @paphonb I agree, I think we should make Lawnchair un-uncheckable in the hidden apps list.. Please use the template provided to describe your issue. It's there for a reason.... No. Lawnchair is going for a Pixel Launcher look. Having the desktop as the drawer is against that on pretty much every level.. I only committed the refactor of the code, that's why my name's there. TBH I have no idea how this will affect other systems.. @Hocceruser Honestly, no idea. Might be @deletescape since pretty much before the refactor, the code was either his, or Google's. You'd need to dig into the git history for a better answer I'm afraid.. Use the damn template, it's not there so you can write your requests in the title.... Not exactly the same, but there's already a way to support the launcher via Google Play.. @divadsn an option could be to make the Donut app free, and add IAPs in that. That way if someone wants to donate multiple times, the option is given (not sure if it already exists in the app or not, haven't checked it TBH).. @paphonb That works too, my reason for making it free would be to entice people to download it, and then they can select donation amount (1$, 2$, 3$, 5$, 10$, 20$, 25$). @deletescape however the clause does define \"offering products\" - here, you're not offering a product, hence this point of the policy does not apply.. Use the issue ticket template, it's there for a reason.. Please use the issue template, it's there for a reason.. @ojuara1987 We only use Crowdin for translations. Importing from other places would mean we'd have to import all the stuff back to Crowdin instead of using the already designed flow. . It's not a bug. Both Nova and your phone's default launcher have it as a fixed shortcut, and display them accordingly. Lawnchair does not have this.. What will be fixed is your name on the list of users blocked from accessing this repository if you continue this. Consider it your final warning.. Please keep the comments on-topic.\nNo, F-Droid does not fork us, there's a separate build config that strips the Awareness provider and related code out. We have multiple build flavours for various places, F-Droid is one of them. And I don't think it's wise to host it here, just use F-Droid for that - supposedly you already care about open-source and free stuff, thus have F-Droid installed, and using it makes things easier, especially for updates.. @0pLuS0 this part:\n\nP.S. I was looking at your blog, life shit in Lucerne? LOL I wish I could live in the Land of Swiss!\n\nThere are a multitude of places to talk with Till about personal/non-LC stuff. Please keep the issue tracker what it was meant for: tracking issues.\nThis is an opensource project, meaning ALL code written by the team is opensourced. However we do use some third-party proprietary services, which we can't opensource, since they are not ours. It's still an opensource and free project, nonetheless.\nAs for the broken weather stuff, I think we already had a ticket open.. No, it is in no way controlled by the launcher.. The rules are strict and quite obscure - possibly even the restoring of a recommended ZIP file could get us in trouble.\nThis is a nice idea for the non-PlayStore versions, but otherwise I'd advise against it.. @Friend-LGA Please upload the image to an open host, or remove the requirement to request access. Thanks!. ## Description\nUser is a dumbass pirate\nExpected Behavior\nUser buys icon packs and other software to support the developer\nActual Behavior\nUser decides to use Lucky Patcher to get things for free\nSteps to reproduce\n\nBe an asshole big enough to think you're entitled to free stuff\nDownload Lucky Patcher\nTry to use Lawnchair with custom icons\n???\nProfit. Oh wait, you can't, cuz YOU'RE A PIRATE\n\nEnvironment\n\nDevice: Any\nAndroid version; Any\nUser IQ: Below 70\n\nHave a nice day :-) . @seankurth I think you're getting some stuff very wrong.\nFirst of all, Lawnchair didn't censor the apps in question (or rather, did for a short while, which was then quickly removed based on user feedback), but disabled icon packs if the user is detected to be using said applications.\nSince Lawnchair's only feature where we depend on possibly paid external resources is the icon pack system, this was accepted by icon pack devs who want support on fighting piracy from launcher developers, and by the dev team as well. \nHowever, while Lawnchair does replicate some Pixel Launcher styles and effects, it's not restricted to those. Sure, @deletescape aims to pull most features, visual or technical, but this anti-piracy stuff is something that's being removed in V2 according to my last information.. Dammit Jim, I'm a launcher, not a security officer!. Made the same mistake :joy: . I think in this case you should compare baseLocale instead, no?. ",

Patience, this will be the final release and then v2 will get to the beta phase.. @GAZ082 Actually the app is already beta on the Play Store, it's just Google derping and showing unreleased instead of beta in the app title, but no worries, only final polishing is now on our list, but most of us have barely time due to the final grades which are at the end of May in most high schools..

We had many issues, for example someone have claimed the original package name, so we tried until now to get the old package name back, but now many of us are busy as holidays are over..  Don't remove shortcuts when app is installed on SD card. @faroit v2 source isn't released yet.. Fixed #854 . Added on the list for final release!. :thinking: .

Stock Android or a modified such as EMUI, MIUI, Grace UX, TouchWiz?. It's actually possible, turn off the pill widget, put something in the first row and turn on the pill widget again, you should still see your Icons there :wink:. I think at the moment the best solution would be substratum themes if you are rooted, have a look at the various tutorials available on the substratum community on how to create themes and change the colors to your desire by editing the widget values in res/values/colors.xml.. Cool, so I will close the issue for now. If you need any help with substratum, go ahead and join the themers group on Telegram @ThemingHelp or here: https://t.me/ThemingHelp.

Ok, the icons in app drawer seems to be wrong as shown in your video, but the settings looks like they aren't translated to Greece, you can fix them by contributing us some translations on our Crowdin page.. Fix screenshot please and...\nProvide us more details about your setup as in the issue template provided!. @1chrome it's unclear from your issue description what do you mean, because not everything has to be addressed to us, sometimes it's the fault of the themer who missed something to theme.\nAlso, it would be easier for us if you would provide us the steps (as wanted by the issue template) that we need to do in order to understand your issue :grin: . See issue #677 for suggestions how to theme the pill widget to your own needs.. Enable screen rotation in Settings -> General.. It's still lower than any other launcher out there, for example Evie takes 380 mb on my phone running Oreo and has far less features than Lawnchair.\nAlso, please be aware that additional features that aren't in stock Pixel Launcher like custom weather providers or blur always take some additional memory, therefore I will close this issue.. An app is loaded with all of it's assets into the RAM, including decompiled files and cache for faster launch.. There was no microphone icon on the Pixel/Lawnchair Launcher, you probably have seen that on the old Google Now Launcher, but now it's been replaced by Google Assistant, therefore I will close this issue.. 1. A custom icon reset feature is being implemented afaik.\n2. It would be a nice feature, but I think that it's also up to the themer to theme that :wink:. To be honest, I still don't get why Germans are so overconcerned about sending anonymous data to a server for analytics, so in the meanwhile I can give you a good instructions on how to protect yourself:\n\nAlso you can look into the source code for anything privacy related, so you will know what's actually submitted for analysis.. \n@HeatedTea there is no need to fork, just clone it locally and remove it :roll_eyes: . Well I can only suggest you compiling the app for x86 devices on your own, there are plenty of tutorials how to build an app from source, so it shouldn't be hard if you have a machine with Linux or macOS.. \n. Jokes aside, Android O is currently not supported, so you shouldn't expect anything working smooth.\nFor example, it's even not starting on my Redmi Note 3 running AOSP Oreo.. @tslio2013 read again or GTFO please, people like you are mostly the reason why devs stop working.. Fixed #854 . Why not add the widget on a new site instead? Never seen this ability on a launcher before.. So add or no add, @fonix232? :P. https://github.com/Deletescape-Media/Lawnchair/wiki/FAQ#why-is-the-weather-different-from-the-one-on-google-now. Yep, it's intended as in stock Pixel Launcher, the leftmost default page is also the one where the pill widget is placed, that's why you can't change it's position. So I will close this issue :). @Younes-L >Pixel style. Well, as Lawnchair is a Pixel style launcher, we are not gonna to make this a feature, as it's not fitting the design with the Pill widget and left side Google Now pane, even if it is disabled for whatever reason.. \nAs far as I know this should've been already fixed with the latest builds.. @guest4711 that's still not an excuse, nag the developer of FastHub and not us or GitHub.\nAlso, you can copy the content of the issue template from the repo :wink:\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/Deletescape-Media/Lawnchair/alpha/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md. Toggles will be added in #959 . Afaik these shortcuts are currently only available on WhatsApp Beta.. https://9to5google.com/2017/07/27/app-shortcuts-now-available-in-latest-whatsapp-beta/\nPlease note that beta versions are always buggy and are mostly unsupported by 3rd parties.. Duplicate of many issues, please read the issue template!. Yeah, it's a shame that there are people on the Internet who try to make money without doing anything else than stealing code from GitHub, but we already have taken done some of these.\nAnyway, I can only advise giving these apps 1-star rating and directly reporting them to Google Play.. As from my past knowledge with Huawei devices and custom ROMs, I would assume it's more an issue with the unstable OpenKirin kernel than with Lawnchair.. Issue closed, use the goddamn issue template, thanks!. This happens only when app icons aren't loaded, therefore I don't see an issue here.\nAlso happens on the stock Pixel Launcher with dark substratum themes.. I don't see how Lawnchair should have influenced the scrolling of other apps, have you some proofs?. See #687 about reasons why Lawnchair is consuming more RAM than the stock Pixel Launcher.. Closed, use the search function and read the issue template.. Closed as @Treemindr gave the correct answer.. It's a common issue, no matter which device and ROM.\nAlso, it's happening with any other Launcher, so the only thing we could try is to re-blur after refresh.. See #730. Do you have backport options enabled? If yes, turn them off, as they are buggy and experimental if you have read the option in the settings.. Sorry, but this issue is on nearly any launcher app out there, apps which are on SD card (no matter if adopted or not) will show up after the SD card has been initialized.. @fonix232 afaik there is a system broadcast sent when the SD card got initialized, but not when apps got loaded into the system, which happens slowly depending on the SD card speed.. This issue was fixed a long time ago with a newer build afaik, therefore I close this issue.. @deletescape but isn't it intended when you pick up an app from the drawer that you are creating a duplicate? I mean the original icon will still be there, since it's in the app drawer.. On the Pixel Launcher it's also not disappearing, but the app drawer closes so fast that you barely notice it.. For me it's not possible to recreate your issue, also it's not happening on the Oreo Pixel Launcher.\nEdit: When doing it another time, Lawnchair just crashes.. >SOMETIMES\nLike on the stock Pixel Launcher too.. Seems more like an issue with your device than an issue with Lawnchair.\nAlso, I don't get that suggestion bar as well, so seems like you are using beta software, which won't be covered and supported here.. Use the issue template, thanks.. Use the issue template, thanks.. @Rawi666 if you are not able to fix or want to revert, let me or someone else know.. Thanks, but without any details and logcat it won't help us at all, so please create seperate issues or use search if these have been already reported.. Also, I can confirm that notification badges are working fine on my Redmi Note 3 running MIUI 8/9 stable/beta (6.0.1) and my Honor 4X running EMUI 4.0 (6.0), so it mostly has to do with wrong battery settings in these UIs.. Sorry @deletescape that I added two more strings to translate \ud83d\ude1b. I don't personally see the point, but I think I can add a switch in Debug settings.. Use issue template, kthxbye.. It's not intended to be rude, but it would be nice to see your previous issues solved before fixing other things :)\nhttps://github.com/Deletescape-Media/Lawnchair/issues/750. @hydhyd update your Lawnchair, you're far too behind, last stable PS release is 1.1.0.15xx. @dimqua could you please maybe upstream your repo and apply your changes to our new build.gradle, as we did a lot of changes to get the app ready for the Play Store, so it should be now easier. :hugs: . @dimqua yes, but we also have changed a lot in build types and the F-droid release doesn't need to be a debug apk, right? As we won't be displaying the Google Now Feed :wink:. @deletescape no afaik, haven't tested it out so far as a lot of changes happened recently..

Gonna cherry-pick that, as @paphonb have broken the branch with his merge \ud83d\ude06 .  Lawnfeed update, fix Signing & version number. @paphonb that's what I mean. It hasn't been fixed so wait and keep calm.. @deletescape +10000. Duplicate of #869 .  Oreo support. Fix it by doing that on Crowdin.. Already working on these.. @Joccob v2 is work in progress.  Oreo support. @paphonb any thoughts?.  Pixel 2 Launcher features. \nShould be fixed soon tho..  Fix shortcuts on low DPI settings. Actually maybe a great feature, but also a feature which could potentially break the stability of the launcher, so currently no way :/. This has been already fixed, it's just not pushed yet.. @jacksonhvisuals is our english supervisor, how about these changes?. I don't understand, could you please make a screen record?. Got fixed, is working now.. That's only happening when Lawnchair isn't the default launcher \u00af_(\u30c4)_/\u00af. Imo it's better with a switch, for live wallpapers especially.. As I already mentioned, it would break with live wallpapers, same as with blur.. I'm not sure if it will cause the same issue we had before fixing Oreo support.... That's a bug with TouchWiz/Grace UX.. But Oreo for S8 is beta software, so we don't support it.. That VoLTE antenna has been fixed afaik. You already can use a widget to scale on the entire page, so I don't see a need for that.. Aside of Codacy being annoying sometimes, but this could be prevented :wink:\n\n. It's still WIP and in alpha stage, so wait until @paphonb have fixed them.. Seriously? Can you just calm the duck down?. Duplicate of #902 . @DasBiest: It's our business to prevent unauthorized use of iconpacks.\nJust like Substratum is keeping you away from using pirated themes for example.. @tills13 iconpacks are a feature of our launcher and currently we allow anyone to use any iconpack they want, from any source, no matter if paid or free.\nThe problem is the following one, iconpack developers don't have an option right now to protect the unauthorized use of their iconpacks when these aren't legally purchased on the Google Play store. So in order to prevent them from doing it now, I added a check with a polite message about the fact that you might wanna uninstall these apps in order to use these iconpacks. It still won't check if these iconpacks were purchased, but it's currently impossible without changes in the way the iconpacks work for now.\nWe hope to see some of the major iconpack templates to add a license check hook, which we can call when the user have selected that iconpack, so we can decide whether deny or allow applying the selected iconpack. But I guess it will take some time.... @tills13 \n\nI appreciate the sentiment, but I disagree with the execution. I should be able to choose which apps show up or don't - it doesn't matter who they are from or how I got them.\n\nWe don't hide them anymore.. @KieronQuinn: Don't ask me, I haven't created that list, but this package name won't even appear on Android versions which Lawnchair does support, so I guess is more likely a malware/piracy app hiding beneath that package name. (Like Lucky Patcher does, but with a different ending). @beatbrot: If you don't like our changes then be free to create your own builds of \"pirate\" Lawnchair. :wink:\n@guest4711: we are not restricting you anymore from using these blacklisted apps tho.... That's the antenna for VoLTE.. @agoogleuser it's a meme in our community, we are aware of that issue :). @paphonb lol, but I also saw the antenna :P. To be re-opened if there is a real need.. I'm leaving this here:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/7azc2i/psa_lawnchair_launcher_now_with_more_censoring/dpgst0l. Caused by: https://github.com/Deletescape-Media/Lawnchair/pull/867. We are still humans, so don't get angry when we don't fix an issue immediately, many of us are busy with school or work life.. Already known and won't fix until Oreo 8.1 source has been released.. Android Version? What device? Custom DPI?. @AndroidDeveloperLB lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+clone+code+using+git. @AndroidDeveloperLB Fix it yourself, this is not a Lawnchair related issue.. @AndroidDeveloperLB like any other project, just look up for the error messages on your favorite search engine.... Sorry, this is not Stack Overflow, we are not here to teach you how to use Gradle.. @deletescape done, it's dynamic so it gets the latest download link from my S3 server.. @TheComputerGuy96 yes, this fix will prevent that.. It only requires to add a updater task into Lawnfeed on init to check the version.json and show a notification if a new update is available.. Codacy derped again xD. Check https://lawnchair.info/getlawnfeed.html and the previous PRs.. We might probably need to create a fake dummy activity for the sake of the new permissions.. Aaaand the xml vector needs to be fixed, wew.. Not reproducable, Google Apps are working fine here. But we are looking into another similar issue.. @deletescape do it.. Till, wtt xD. Fix Codacy please :). @jaduprey Please please please, give me time and some life ;_;. @anirudhgupta109 no one asked you Anirudh. One question: Do we look like Action Launcher to kang their ideas? :grimacing: . @Justin00015 we don't think so, it should be respected as it is a Action Launcher exclusive feature.. @neomodern Just because two other launchers kanged the idea doesn't mean we have to do the same. But we'll think about an own feature with a similar functionality in the future \ud83e\udd17. Please check your Location, as this happens only when the location is wrong.. Then it works fine, the temperatures are not our fault, it's usual for different weather providers.. Confirmed. This isn't our job to do that, this has to be done by the ROM (see Pocket Lock on several Nougat custom ROMs) or an accessibility service, which would end for us badly as such apps are now getting banned on the Play Store.\nTl;dr: It's unlikely that we will add such a feature.. Just FYI: You can pirate apps without using those fishy apps :wink:\nOr just use the 48h refund period to refund the apps you've tried but don't liked.. You can launch whatever you want, get your facts right before writing spam.. @tvteja are you blind? The mentioned thing wasn't even merged and is now only in use to prevent illegal use of pirated iconpacks and there is a reason behind that.. @tvteja it is our business to prevent you from abusing Lawnchair to use pirated iconpacks.\nIn many countries such practise would make us as a tool illegal too.. @tvteja selecting iconpacks != launching apps. We launch whatever you want, but we won't allow you to use our app to apply illegal iconpacks, get it.. @tvteja then why does it bother that you get that message? :thinking: . @tvteja because of the fact that iconpacks cannot prevent the use themselves and we respect the work of every iconpack designer.. @tvteja no, we look after piracy apps, not after iconpacks, get the point.. Oh yeah, that is already known bug, I'll look into this today.. Please fix commit message, it's too long.\nYou can do a \"git commit --amend\" and then force push your commit to the repo.. READ THE CHANGELOG PLEASE.. @deletescape, but the phone permissions could be explained tho.. Thanks, we'll merge it when we will work on shortcuts.. What? Never seen a black square folder.. Take a look into the behavior settings next time ;). We do have those methods for isPackageAvailable in the PackageManagerHelper afaik, maybe you could add them there :wink:. Shet, build failed.. Indeed, haven't tested out other ways. Ask the PR author.. @enricocid I've reverted your PR, please fix it and ensure it works as intended :). No response from original PR author :/. There is still work left to do, there is a logic problem where LawnfeedClient is assumed to do the Google Now page and Pill widget, while the other implementation is only for the Google Now page.\nIn the end we need to make it possible to use the pill widget, while having the Google Now page properly disabled for working scroll.\nMaybe removing the Google Now page check in LawnfeedClient would fix it better.. But do we store somewhere the closest OWM location from the API to open that in the browser too?. Added customization options to the list, weather related stuff in another PR.. It's been due to an old app which shouldn't be shipped anymore and it's package name was mostly abused for malware and piracy apps.. Got already fixed.. I guess we'll wait until VoLTE antennas got fixed.. Duplicate of #869. Look into the source, we don't supply any Malware.. Also, those 2 are irrelevant AV and they will always be triggered, look at the major ones.. Adding additional icons breaks the minimal design and it would be accidentally tapped on/off, so we'll keep the switch.. Add it then, or send us a Blackberry device :v. Attachment is a zip file?. It's possible, look in the behavior and theme settings.. Now how we are supposed to recreate it? :P. It's due to a wrong and missing package signing, has been fixed with commit 4c2626fa2ff51bc2ae6393bf24a38e61ecbf4976.. Well, a blacklist isn't the best idea, as sometimes I receive related to my Now feed notifications.. And now what? How are we supposed to reproduce it?\nOr are you going to send us a Lenovo device? ;). Rule no. 1 of FOSS: Don't ask for ETA, be patient.\nSo please, don't bother us with raising attention, we already noticed it, but we don't have time.... @jise And now what?. @jise Just because we don't reply doesn't mean we don't have that bug on our todo listm. @jise We have labels and some of those issues have also links to Trello. I'm sorry, but I am currently not able to tell any more details than the fact that we are getting back doing updates and fixes, as we moved all our stuff to the new server which took a lot time for me.. @divadsn Also, we don't close issues if we think that this should be added or fixed, so open issues are ALWAYS on our heads-up, no matter what we did so far. If we find out after a long time that the issue can't be solved then we close the issue and thank everyone for trying out.. It's due to some stupid API changes in Oreo 8.1, you need to give Lawnchair storage permissions in order to access the Wallpaper image. Don't worry, we'll add it surely with another Oreo update asap.. It's not possible to have it on CI version...\n72f51a92f0f0f4130318d018fb80502b2a1563d7. This is intended to be enabled by default on CI builds, so it's not a bug if you don't have Google app installed.. It should be hidden on the latest Play Store version, so it should be also fixed.. @reC0D3D Boi, it's on v1.... Farkin git revert. Travis, just REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. @seky22: what?. Use the search function, this issue has been already reported and it is being fixed in #959.. Move widget to the top part of the screen until the widget gets a red tinted color, then release it.. This is due to the current restart method, as the previous was creating FC spam in our console.. Although, it's a duplicate. Gestures are already wanted here.. Duplicate, please use the search function. Logcat or it never happened. Translation issues are to be reported on Crowdin.. Feel free to explain your reason here why you are doing this, @SpamMaster.. Or feel free to contact me on Telegram @divadsn.\n(Don't worry, I don't bite people). Also, feel free to report him to GitHub using the link below:\nhttps://github.com/contact/report-abuse. For any questions or bug reports, you can send them to me via E-mail at projects@codebucket.de, thanks :). Alright, we've now locked interactions for new user accounts, anyone else should be able to create issues and write comments :). That's an overkill for an easteregg.. Could you please make a video so we can reproduce it 1:1? And a Logcat would be nice too, thanks.. @Ufeldraku everyone is busy maybe?. @Ufeldraku also, we are not paid for our work unlike Nova.. Fix them or upvote those translations on translate.lawnchair.info, thanks.. @FacuM A question: Would you translate jokes in real-life?. The weather is part of the Google search pill widget, therefore it will get removed when you disable it.. To be added in #959 . Sure, happy lawyer time.. Launcher3, but ok you idiot that you are illiterate.. Bitch nope. Sure, send money on PayPal, kthxbye.. Here u go. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gau.go.launcherex&hl=pl\nGO launcher EX (polski) \u2013 Aplikacje na Androida w Google Play\n. What's your point of doing this?. Tell it or I will take morr actions against you. We don't wanna ban you, but we will do it and even more if you don't want to work with us the community.. There are limits, lemme show you them later, reply to my previous messages you shady guy with no balls.. Not only me. A very good paid one. I'm always @deletescape's Lawnslave :heart:. Lelmaochair. You are the biggest looser here. Duplicate of #942, use the search function please!. Me neither on 8.0, do you have notification access granted? Keep in mind that after an upgrade some permissions needs to be reapplied, that's not our fault.. That's just something that we don't really care tbh, it's an easteregg in the end though.. @fonix232 Tbh, Folders in app drawer isn't really the Pixel style to go. @bungabunga As far as I can remember there is a switch in the behavior settings. @akhilnarang Lauwnchar. @Psyycker http://bit.ly/lawnfeed. @Psyycker Restart Lawnchair in Debug. We are not allowed and therefore we had to revert that with #981.. Not reproducable, tried with multiple iconpacks, try rebuilding your icon database.. @luuknieuwdorp Rebuild icon database. Thanks for the list, but:\nMost of them are not Pixel style, we will look into the color option and the D2TS is already on the list.. @TheHADILP I don't believe you, there is no chance the popup can come up if you haven't Lawnfeed installed, as confirmed by @fonix232 multiple times in other issues.. Fixed in #1124 . To correct you, @Frontear, that unresponsive press and hold bug is well-known and it's caused by the new way to restart Lawnchair, but we won't fix it as we are going to work on v2, where we will make the settings work without a restart.\nSame goes with the second question, we will add a way in v2, I first have to get how other Launchers do the \"apply\" action callback for iconpacks.. @Frontear Happens a lot only when you change settings a lot ;). Lmao not today @fonix232 \ud83d\ude02. It is normal now since the last builds.. http://bit.ly/lawnfeed if you are using Play Store version.. @deletescape Somebody once told me.... This PR doesn't add anything new, hence closing.. I'd rather make it with a slider only instead of having an additional switch and keep the default value, just like we did with other customization options.. @TiiXel the color can be switched off and can be independent of the opacity.\n@Treemindr there is no such thing as reset entirely :P. @TiiXel That's not the point, first of all the color extraction switch does work, as I am having my dock in white color and not in the extracted one from the wallpaper. And second, the opacity slider would be enough, there is no need for another switch for custom opacity.. After looking up some files and commits from the past, it looks good, will recheck it later and merge it.. No problem, I will add some migration helper functions and then it will be merged :). Known issue with MIUI, we don't have any Xiaomi device with MIUI to test it out unfortunately.. Sadly after running MIUI 9 on my Redmi Note 3 I noticed that it's a MIUI bug, as the animation is going to the icon position of the stock launcher, instead of Lawnchair's.. That's already possible, you can adjust dock height scale in the dock settings.. That's something currently not expecting to be, as we rather were thinking about padding adjustments.. What why? This fixes the popup when Google app is not installed or Lawnfeed not running.. @GAZ082 Uhm, you know that this is a Pixel style launcher and the app drawer therefore has a scrolling list?. @faroit pull up is for the app drawer, just saying.... @faroit long press the arrow then ;). Closed, see #959. @Bluethf Read above.. @calebdonut We are already aware, it's on the list for v2 :). @Treemindr Ewww, are we Nova Launcher?. Interesting feature, but as I said in the end, that should be a Nova exclusive tho and it should be respected.. See FAQ for the answer please, it's been already posted here several times.\n2018-01-30 20:10 GMT+01:00 Elnarci notifications@github.com:\n\nDevice: BQ Aquaris X\nAndroid version: 7.1.1\nRom: Stock Rom 1.5.1 rooted\nWeather in launcher does not update temperature, pressing opens the\nweather application of google with a different temperature than the one\nshown by the launcher in version 1.1.0.1742\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/Lawnchair/issues/1130, or mute the\nthread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AbObB1VsrbBIAvr2_Zw1sO8KzUqeZba0ks5tP2ktgaJpZM4Ry2wi\n.\n. > This depends on which weather provider you have selected. If you use OpenWeatherMap, the difference is normal because Google Now uses weather data from Weather.com. But if you use Google Awareness, then things get tricky, as it updates only if the weather is more than 3 degrees from the previous value.\n. @Elnarci Report it to Google, not us, we are only using their data provided by the Awareness API which as I said updates only on huge temperature differences.. @Elnarci Nova has the same issue if you use Google Awareness API, and you can't compare the OpenWeatherMap weather data with the one displayed in the Google app.. Already fixed, see #1124.. @ildar F-Droid version uses some hackery, we can't support it until we know exactly what hackery is being used.. Tagging PR #1157 to keep track of necessary things to do.. Confirmed, thanks. @AxiK101 Duplicate of issues, don't open new please.. We already have something like that, turn on the horizontal list in drawer settings.. @JustinTrouble Then that's not our thing, as we already have an alphabetical app drawer, we'll look back into that layout in v2, thanks!. We can't access system settings to enable those if they are disabled by system.. @tofylion forwarding to @fonix232, I don't own a Samsung device to test that out. It works on AOSP 8.1 on my Redmi Note 3 fine with navbar enabled.. @tofylion We already have a fix, it's just a manifest value which hasn't been documented very well by Samsung, so blame them for doing such changes to Android.. @tofylion Yes, the final update is aimed for end of February. What weather widget is it?. @capstan1 Restart Lawnchair in Settings under Debug.. @capstan1 On the Play Store version the option is disabled by default, on the GitHub release version it should usually work out-of-the box. @capstan1 We have to hide the switch in the Play Store version if Lawnfeed isn't installed, but we are also aware that the integration is buggy (cc @deletescape). Tested on latest Play Store version, is working as expected for me.. @mueller-ma Already known, thanks.. @mueller-ma It's not an issue that we can solve, it's on the heads-up for further investigation.. Categories won't be a thing for now, maybe in v2, but Duck Duck Go will definetely be a thing for the f-droid build flavor!. @deletescape added to my list, I will be back next Sunday.. Pls fix codacy @deletescape. FFS STOP IT TRAVIS, YOU AREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE TRIGGERED ON PR ANYMORE.. @AlyamanMas10 Marshmallow, we don't have any testing device available, any screenshots maybe please?. \"Non-image content type returned\". @Frontear and their widgets, it's usual with widgets from OEM weather apps, like on Huawei's EMUI for example.. Not planned to add, would require to have it globally as the icons have to match the grid.. Can't confirm, working fine for me with Google Dialer, have you tried turning notification access on and off?. Tried with emulator, works fine with Google Dialer on 6.0, therefore I will close it.. @sultanahamer Sorry, that's not the Pixel style, we can't do it.. @sultanahamer Not only that, the first left screen has the Google Pill widget, with the intended left side of the pill being the first page.. Drone CI got triggered <3.

Failed due to a non-existent commit sha, as the previous build is a PR which isn't merged yet.... Let's ignore it by just not enabling changelog for PRs, should work fine then.. On hold, to be merged after #1155 . This should now work fine, merge it after passing build.. Tablets aren't supported during alpha stage, that's a Play Store restriction.. To be upstreamed and updated with other build flavors.. I think we are good for now, a fdroid flavor is already present in v2, so will close that.. @ildar v2 sources aren't public yet. Travis, why tf?. Unsupported for now, as F-Droid builds contain hackery stuff which have disabled Google Awareness APIs for example.\nJust set the weather provider to OpenWeatherMap in the settings.. Hey, thanks for the report. Can we have a screenshot for reference please? And also, do you use a custom DPI value or what phone?. Before merging this, please check any shit widgets from Samsung and Huawei.. @skittles9823 u w0t m8, do some productive activity.. Leaving this to @paphonb as he is working mainly on v2 for now.. It's already a feature for v2, stay tuned! :). GitMate.io thinks possibly related issues are https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/Lawnchair/issues/664 (Feature request :)), https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/Lawnchair/issues/1102 (Feature Requests), https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/Lawnchair/issues/583 (Features request), https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/Lawnchair/issues/590 (Feature Request), and https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/Lawnchair/issues/598 (Feature request).. @Nevexo Uhm, it has, all of that is already mentioned in those. Actually GitMate messed up, but this was already proposed in #1163 and has been added for v2.. @Salad764 thanks for the idea. Might be interesting for v2, but for v1 you're better off with substratum for now, we can't promise anything right now.. Well, it's kinda expected I would say, waiting for @deletescape to comment onto that.. Travis ffs, shut up.. @deletescape tested across different package names?. @deletescape No anime for you!. @marrco Added to HIGHVERYIMPORTANTLIST for @deletescape \ud83d\ude02. @divadsn /\ud83d\ude02. @forabi thanks, RTL support is already on the list for final release.. @chessnut1 please read the goddamn changelog notice.... @ffeingol this is a supposed behavior, @deletescape has intentionally moved it back to the top.. What do you mean by \"One layer\" mode?. @shubhchan is this the Pixel style tho?. 1.1.0.1864 isn't the latest one.. @Nevexo It is intentional afaik, @fonix232 any comment on that?. @BeatPlay It's intended behavior dude, we've added the metadata which is the same on other launchers like Nova. I don't have a Samsung device, but @fonix232 can clear this up.. @BeatPlay Nova uses hackery to access the APIs, which will be discouraged soon on the Play Store if such behavior is detected.. As long as Samsung don't list their meta tags somewhere in docs, we won't be able to support that.. @zywn confirmed, forwarding to @deletescape.. \n. @deletescape wotwtowot. @GAZ082 Fixed in recent PRs, to be rolled out today.. @Polomman zero fucks given, kthxbye.. Waiting for @deletescape to confirm. I wish I could have a device with EMUI to test that out, but @deletescape has gotten recently a hands on a Huawei device, so I am leaving that for him.. There is no point in having an opacity setting with blur enabled.. You have to enable your Now feed in the Google app, otherwise it won't work obviously.. How?. Just change rhe amount of icons in the dock settings.. @thematrjx sorry but no, we are respecting other Launchers and won't include that, as it is not the Pixel style.. We already added two row dock for people to have more space to customize, whether to add a searchbar widget or just play around with KWGT.. @Stanzi97 That's not the Pixel style, sorry :). @ha3flt in our opinion it is a style choice, as we are not Nova Launcher where you can have whatever you want. Take a look for example at ASAP Launcher, where your left and right pages are set to weather, agenda or contacts as well.. @ildar And now what?. @ildar no it's like no one cares if the software we use to compile is closed source or not, it doesn't matter for the end product as the source of Lawnchair is open anyways. By using alpha we are just preparing for newer Android versions and bleeding edge technologies, like dockerizing our builds.. @ildar It will break support in Android Studio, which surprise, is also closed source. The foss flavor is expected to be rolled out as the final features are added.. I left my opinion over at F-Droid, it's ridiculous IMO but I reverted that as Android Studio 3.1 stable has been released a week ago, so it should work fine now I hope.\nSee commit 5d3292f and this for more details.. Could you please provide us a screenshot maybe of the result? :)\nFor anyone else to test: https://transfer.sh/ossKD/app-debug.apk. > Could you please provide us a screenshot maybe of the result? :)\nA side by side comparison of how it looked before and how it looks now would be great.. Ooof thanks, that's a nice found!. @Nonononoki Closing, please update Lawnchair, thanks.. @Nonononoki We do not handle issues for F-Droid, please have a look at the releases in the repo or on the anti-privacy Google Play Store.. @foosinn Update Lawnchair, kthxbye.. @ceiphr @paphonb has work apps, can you confirm that too?. The changelog was saying you should uninstall Lawnfeed and download the latest from https://lawnchair.info/getlawnfeed.html, then install normally.. @kk6axq the code you mentioned contains only the checking process and the notification which is created and shown to you. Could you please get a logcat so we could sort it out, as in theory there shouldn't be a crash unless my server is going crazy and the response is malformed (which was the case now as I forgot to pay the bill). Hm, kinda funny as on Nougat and Oreo it did not crash, I am gonna reproduce it on 6.0, should in theory work without that flag.. @eyal100 RTL Support is currently on our list, please be patient :). Will extend the library tomorrow and add along with Twitter handles for us.. @toompitow Already in list. @source124 Ahhh k, that should be easy then ^^. Build failed, see https://build.codebucket.de/LawnchairLauncher/Lawnchair/156/3. No reply since my last comment, closing.. I'm neither a graphic design expert too, therefore closed. Please describe it at least so we can reproduce it on our own way.. Declined, it's somewhere maybe for v2, but for now with the current implementation not possible.. @PiwwowPants Beta software, closed.. We are a Pixel style launcher :wink: . @Hocceruser We had no time to discuss it internally. @caiorrs Translations are done over at Crowdin.. On the list for later. Actually we already have that added:\nhttps://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/Lawnchair/blob/alpha/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L121-L131. Hmm, that's strange, can you please provide a logcat for us?. If you could provide us a full logcat with the entire exception, it would be great. Otherwise we will try to see that on the Play Console and fix it.. Oh, didn't meant to close that one, lul. @zilexa Why the hell do you need a Play button, that's useless.. @zilexa Just a small tipp, you can search directly for apps in the drawer and it will suggest you taking to the Play Store \ud83d\ude09. @iamdeep08 no. That won't change, we are a Pixel style launcher and it's designed to be like that for Google Now pane.. Is it still present on the latest version?. Thanks, but we have already made a choice for our new icon :). Isn't it already a thing in the latest release? :thinking: . @anopows Duplicate of x issues, please use search.. That's an issue we can't fix without accessing third party SDKs which is disallowed in Android P, but we have a toggle to force white status bar icons.. @paphonb yet I can also confirm they're misleading, I was thinking first that I could re-arrange the order of the shortcuts, but instead I just could only place them on the homescreen.. Closing, see this explanation: https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/Lawnchair/issues/1257#issuecomment-396040392. Fixed in referenced commit, to be approved.. Grant storage permissions manually in system settings.. What the heck?!. Go to Settings => Desktop and you will find it there, you have to grant notification access.. No activity since 2 weeks.. @4PERTURE That's because your icon cache was empty, that can be caused by a bad RAM management of your phone. Could be easily added as we already have the option to extract the accent color based on the wallpaper.. Looks good, will fix some grammar in the toast message and merge it.. Finished in 6b8b4b57e461babbc26a9b5cdbc9804aca2f3283, therefore closing.. @quassy Adding in-app purchases would classify our app as non-free and would make look like we have a Pro version on the store listing.. @fonix232 hmm, what about asking @deletescape, as he has the source for that.. @eggsgent Those translations are from Launcher3, but not from us.. @khaledson Nougat or higher, kthxbye. They're not backported in v2.. That's actually an expected behavior, as these are your previous wallpapers, you can simply select them by longpressing and delete them.. Someone could maybe help out with a less fucked up way to use the MultiSelectRecyclerViewAdapter without having hardcoded mess.. Works, to be reviewed.. @paphonb a toggle in the Settings would be nice to have, otherwise works fine.. @kptawesome All in v2. You can get v2 alpha APK in our Telegram community group.. @DragoCubed It is an alpha, and we are heading toward the new Material Design which is present in current DP of P.. @DragoCubed we will see forward to have both options available, but I can't guarantee.. @Tminus1 What build? \ud83e\udd14. @OffifialMITX Already known and fixed. @ojuara1987 Please head over to Crowdin for translation. @Muscarv2 Already known issue. Lmao, that's an admeme member.... That's a year old and fixed. @Twilrom It's how it is, fixed.. @rl2macdo We might wanna push the hotfix which is in our repo since ages to the Play Store. It's not in our power to control that.. @lulbob Read exactly what's written when activating device admin, it's a secure lock, which means you have to enter your PIN/Password each time you want to unlock again, sorry \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. @lulbob Yes, you can do safely by using the screen timeout method, should work fine when you have granted access to change system settings. @preterive To be added with v2 along with other import settings :). @faroit It is already present in Lawnchair.. https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/Lawnchair/pull/930. @faroit If you are relating to v2: it's still not done and everything from v1 will be implemented in v2 too, therefore mention please if you are relating to v2, as the code repo is v1. @faroit Technically v2 isn't yet public, therefore it's something \"hidden\" ;). @faroit It's a common practice for many open-source projects, we had bad experiences in the past with people stealing our code and impersonating us on the Play Store, we don't want to deal with that again.. @JonnyTech It's already been a feature. @DI555 Technically feedback for v2 is supposed to be given on Telegram \ud83d\ude02. @chongbo2013 any logs maybe??????????. @n-o-o-b Expected behavior, you should edit icons in the app drawer, not on the desktop. @n-o-o-b To change icons individually. @n-o-o-b Changing an icon on a homescreen is only affecting change to the shortcut, not the app itself in the drawer.. @n-o-o-b Edit the icon from the app drawer, not from the homescreen as said before.. @z-vap That's an EMUI bug, therefore we can't do anything about that issue. @OctoNezd We cannot do that due to Google Play Store policy afaik, that's also the reason why we don't menton lawnfeed download in Lawnchair v1.. @subash774 There is Digital Wellbeing on Android Pie and apps which have access to your usage data, no need to have that into a launcher.. @subash774 App usage is available on most Android versions right now, just find an app on Play Store, there are plenty of them.. @flocke GitHub was broken at the time, so yeah, we are aware of that :). @arcenas090 No. @arcenas090 Well, take a look into the source code, we don't include any libraries that are used for tracking, all data sent to 3rd parties is only used to get weather information from OpenWeatherMap or Google Awareness API. But again, we are not responsible for their privacy policy at that point.. @XenocodeRCE Lucky Patcher, there you have it \ud83e\udd37. @XenocodeRCE So why even the use of Lucky Patcher?. @XenocodeRCE Lucky Patcher is a privacy tool, get rid of it. @XenocodeRCE There is no valid reason to use Lucky Patcher, period.. @noahajac Google Messages changes your system's night mode and therefore Lawnchair is following that option too.. @arcenas090 It detects piracy apps such as Lucky Patcher and clones of them. @arcenas090 I will do an update tomorrow, please be patient. @iamdeep08 We don't have that control over the Google Now feed.. Got confirmed, therefore I'm closing it.. @miki1606 Duplicate, please use the search. @mister-monster Duplicate, please use the search. @mister-monster . @mister-monster Yeah you haven't wrote that anywhere in your issue, as expected by the template we provide. @mister-monster thar option exists in v2 alpha currently, version 1 is no longer being developed.. @mister-monster we are not able to guess and we added a issue template with questions like what Lawnchair version for a reason, right? \ud83d\ude09\nIt's not meant to be offensive, but it would avoid misunderstandings between us \ud83d\ude42. Great, I'm closing this issue as for now and we'll keep you updated on our social media when v2 will get a stable release (or on GitHub releases) :). @OpenRift412 We have no control over how the feed is displayed as far as I know.. @OpenRift412 same response as in #1445.. Fix whitespace please.. \nThere is indeed as GitHub shows to me.. Fix https. Doesn't it require to also change the preference key in the code?. Oh I see, stupid git diff.. Fuck. Is working, but how do we bring back the old fade effect?. We also might wanna check if the device is in battery save mode to disable spring animation.. ",

Please be patient.. @psamim No worries :) \nJust wait a \"little bit\" more for the final release. It will be there very soon!. @GAZ082 Yo! The closed beta testing is under process. I'd suggest you to wait for the another release. BTW, we have already pushed 2 updates on Play Store, have you checked? \nTalking about this issue, yes, the devs are working on it. ;). @adamf663 Wdym by multiple pages? It can add multiple pages, yes. \n. @StevieMJH I'll let the developers know of this and hope to get the bug fixed in future builds.. @eggsgent Alright, thanks. @CryoRenegade Check our crowdin project. @GaboZac61 Yes you can. You just need to have a crowdin account for that. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb. @amirzaidi , Yes it does.. @gena01 You can install the alpha version of v2 from t.me/lccommunity.. @gena01 v2 alreaady has the app shortcuts. There's no toggle for it. You just have to make it the default launcher for app shortcuts to work.  . @ildar The devs may consider this for upcoming releases. Stay tuned! \ud83d\ude09. @TheComputerGuy96 No, but David can! Haha!. Are you using the stock dpi? Or a custom one? . @TheBITLINK Please try the stock dpi and report if the issue persists. . @AndroidDeveloperLB It's closed & answered already, why'd you even ask?. @anirudhgupta109 You actually should... I'll let the devs know about your request. As I don't think they would implement the said feature. . @paphonb But sir I want my 'launcher' to 'launch' my apps please help I'm blind.. @arpitnnd Thanks for adding shit to this issue which is irrelevant and not even an issue. All the icon pack developers aren't working for free for days and nights investing numerous hours while making icon packs for users. If you have piracy tools installed, Lawnchair WILL stop you from applying the icon packs even if you use the piracy tools for stuff like blocking ads or making it a system apps. Google the alternate solutions for both of them if that's the case. @deletescape please close this issue as it's completely irrelevant and doesn't belong here at all. Thanks.. @TheTored You can do that by enabling 2 row dock and placing the widget in the second row. @shreyasbapat Give storage permissions to the launcher from Settings > Apps. @tofylion If your ROM has expanded desktop then force enable navbar on the launcher.. @Frontear Many users can't! Stay tuned for the updates at t.me/lccommunity \ud83d\ude01. @Frontear Where Samsung doesn't go wrong? Lmao!. Nice one! Morgan rocks! . @alamo18 Great work!. @rmenessec \"Soon\" is actually soon ;). @deletescape ok. @aniel300 Vary nais.. @ha3flt Glad you understand ;). @ha3flt I'll let the dev team know about this. Sure.. @zilexa We have that in our to-do list. Will let the developers know about that.. @iamdeep08 \"More detailed explanations can be found in earlier issues on this topic\" he said. \ud83d\ude10 . @SohailRaheman That's done by Google. We'll see what can be done.. @theel0ja Lawnchair v2 supports other search engines like DDG, etc. For that you have to have the said engine's app installed and then navigate to Settings > Search and change the search provider. . @tychoregter Hmm, that sounds good. \ud83e\udd14. @eggsgent Haven't you already created an issue for the same earlier?. @DragoCubed Following the Material Design guidelines set by Google, is what we're doing.. We already have search bar in app drawer on v2. Join our Telegram chat for the beta releases! . @ojuara1987 You just need to make an account on Crowdin and go to translate.lawnchair.info in order to translate in your preferred language. You can access it from PC as well as mobile.. You can enable \"Add icons to home screen\" for newly installed apps. \nHowever, the devs will see if they will/will not add the following feature. . @ojuara1987 For v1 and v2, you can just enable two-row dock and place a search bar widget there. It's exactly the same.. You can use KWGT widgets to replicate the rounded search bar.. @ojuara1987 Download KWGT Pro, the widget of your choice, and then place it on the homescreen. It's pretty easy, you just have to read.. @mccoys Do you have the \"Allow Lawnchair to create widgets on homescreen\" permission allowed?. That'll be an unnecessary feature to add, in my opinion. However, you can manually hide the apps that you have on homescreen :) . @PixelNotFound Lawnchair consumes RAM because of:\n1. Blur\n2. Google Feed\nand\n3. Notification Listener (Notification dots) \nYou can disable any of the above to reduce the RAM usage. @chongbo2013 Guess you're in the wrong repo mate.. @ffeingol We already know about this, thanks for reporting.. @iamdeep08 Lawnfeed is just an add-on to enable Google Feed on non-debug versions. The feed's theme is handled by Google, and not us. The feed's background goes dark or white depending upon what theme of the launcher is, or how dark/white is your wallpaper.. @iamdeep08 I'm not aware of the dark cards in Google Discover, but let's see how Google tries to go with their overhaul.. @PopeRigby We already have this in v2, have you tried it out?. @PopeRigby You can download v2 either from APKMirror or t.me/lawnchairci. @goanga We know about this issue. Developers are investigating and will fix it soon.. @goanga That's a known issue. It'll be fixed in the upcoming builds. Stay tuned.. @Bberx Have you flashed Quickswitch zip?. @Bberx That's not a bug, instead it's an intended behaviour. Go to Gestures > Swipe up from dock to configure it.. @Lyr3x Usually a restart fixes it.. @dhufford81 Locking as admin is sometimes annoying.

Sorry, I should have given more detail: Lawnchair version 198, stock Android 8.0 DP3, Nexus 5x, latest Chrome stable. This is still an issue for me. Now running build 297. Everything is added to homescreen with Google Now launcher but I get nothing with Lawnchair. It does work on my tablet but that's running LineageOS 14.1 (Android 7.1.2). I've now run another test from the Google Weather app which has a \"add to desktop\" option and this adds the shortcut to weather on my tab but not on my phone.. Just tried on latest build. Still not working. It works on my tablet running 7.1.2 just not on my phone running 8.0. I've had this issue and solved it by opening the app drawer after disabling the pixel top bar. It seems to refresh the home screen. Then I add my widget at the top of the screen.. @uudruid74  \"I don't like \"pills\" on my desktop and I have no need to clone the pixel's UI\" - maybe this isn't the right launcher for your requirements as it aims mainly to replicate the Pixel launcher for non-Pixel devices. I'm not being rude, honestly, its just that there's a lot of launchers out there that don't have the pill and don't look like the pixel UI.... OK, but it is possible to use the space in the meantime - you just have to play a little, try a few things;)\n\n. No, that's NOT the Lawnchair pill, it's the one in Pixel Widget Pro which is the widget I use in place of the Lawnchair top bar. You can clearly see that the widget resize box uses the whole of the top of the screen space - that means Lawnchair isn't using that space. Look - I've moved it to show you:\n\n. I'm finished here. I've given you two screenshots of me having done what your original issue says can not be done I.E. resizing a widget in the pill area and moving a widget into that area from below it. I'm using the full height of my screen. It's a 5x5 grid, the Fit widget is 2x2, Pill widget is 1x5 and then 2 rows of icons.   You simply refuse to accept what you see. Enjoy the rest of your day..

Fixed with 9c391064. Seems to happen with icon actions (Edit, Widgets, App info) but the app shortcuts are fixed.. Long pressing the handle acts like long pressing a blank workspace. Normal click works as expected tho.. Newer Chrome versions add PWAs to the app drawer and not the home screen. Did you check that?. Fixed in bb80c8f. Fixed with 9c39106. Duplicate of #76 . Implemented in a459fb1. @Alyndri you don't have to uninstall and reinstall anymore since build 223. Fixed with 9c39106. Fixed with 9c39106. Fixed with #164 . 1. Fixed.\n2. Apps need to supply their own round icon.. Implemented in 32c2109. Fixed. Fixed with 5130acf. Long press an empty area.. Fixed with fef0080. Implemented with f5500d84. Can you post a video? I can't reproduce the issue from my end.. Google's problem for not adding a rounded version of the icon.. Duplicate of #187 . Already there. Set drawer opacity to 0.. Removed in 6c032bb. Fixed with 82473b8. Duplicated. This is fixed in newer alpha versions.. @KieronQuinn After some searching, I found a hidden method that allows AssetManager to load the manifest file. So the first four hard steps is not required anymore.. Yes but currently disabled because it isn't optimized yet.. Fixed by b231ac7. . Fixed with 04f85ad. There is already an issue for this.. Implemented with 7d05569. Duplicate of #21. This should be in #255 . Fixed with #274 . This is because daily wallpaper is a live wallpaper and can't be blurred.. Already implemented for O and above.. As I said in #264, this is fixed in bb80c8f. Duplicate of #34. Fixed with 896b5b1. Duplicated issue. Please search before submitting.. Please remove your modules.xml changes.\nAlso you don't need the else part as this launcher has minApi 21. More details?. Doesn't look as nice as the concept when implemented because of some other factors. But might think about implementing this again in the future.\n. Clone the repo and open it in Android Studio. You can find tutorials on the internet.. Duplicate of #120. Already added in 0398ef7. Duplicate of #237 . This is either because your wallpaper app or your ROM. Lawnchair doesn't modify your wallpaper in any way.. That is the intended behavior.. This is already implemented.. Tapping date should open calendar. And the event not found bug is fixed.. Duplicated issue. Please search before posting.. @deletescape I think the library implementation is already good enough. But this is just my opinion.. Larger column sizes are not designed for small screens.. Pill width is equal to icon width (this behavior is in Pixel launcher too) and search app text is fixed. Fixed . Adding a widget is considered editing and is disabled.. Google Now support is now possible. But there are more things preventing a play release.. No.. There are many issues already there for this bug. Please search before posting.. Duplicate of #48. Duplicated issue. Please search before posting.. Can you please look at the commit history?

You already opened this 20 days ago.. Should be solved now.. From screenshots I've seen,  CPU time on both foreground and background is really low and if CPU time is low, battery consumption should be low too.  It's possible that the calculations are incorrect because you are running a prerelease OS.. @Pedro1999 Can you post a screenshot of detailed usage in settings?. If CPU usage is low and real battery life is not changed, that means the calculations are incorrect.. No matter if it's the only app or not. If there is no impact then it's the OS' fault.. The search pill width will be equal to icon width.. Duplicate of #233. Implemented. You can long press it to view the version number.. In those cases, they might have a version check.. Duplicate of #225. @intelligentcasanova this is not a duplicate. He stated that he is running on O.. Duplicate of #242. Dots colors are already tinted to icon's color.. No. This would make the homescreen cluttered. . Because the weather data from awareness API isn't enough to determine a more specific icons.. More descriptions?. @jackmort37 More informations?. OK google hotword is not handled by Lawnchair.. This is the expected behavior.. Nothing is changed about the date widget. It's your font itself.. Some more info such as videos?. Please move to #468 . ROM issue.. They are displayed exactly how your icon pack specified.. Some icon packs don't have the 'All icons' section.\nThe first one will show every icon provided by the icon pack.. This is an Android bug and is fixed in Nougat.. Whatever version, it's still an Android bug.. The pager will be completely removed later. So not fixing this.. This feels a bit weird because you already have the Google now page on the left.. Reduce icon columns.. Dark navbar buttons can't be implemented for Nougat or lower.. Alright try to prove me wrong..

Please search before posting.. @Dondrejohnson5 please stop commenting without useful informations like this.. Duplicate of #453. \nThere is a button called \"search\". Google clock package is com.google.android.deskclock.. Fixed.. This is really nice. But the hardest thing would be to clip the icons under the search bar. I'm thinking about this.. Then we have the old problem: performance. Even my SD820 takes around 20ms to blur a 1080p bitmap. So clipping might be a better idea.. Should be fixed in 1.1.0.1194. Duplicate of #468 . Can you record a video of the problem?. Duplicate of #468. I'll close this issue because the other one has more discussions.. Lawnchair version?. Duplicate of #468. @deletescape it was actually a bug and fixed by a0eba56.. Duplicated icon?. Fixed in 3ad7375.. Fixed in affaacd.. Duplicate of #111 . Duplicate of #582. Duplicated issue. Duplicate of #582. Update your Google app.. The background color is taken from the Google app.. I'll cherry pick that commit. Thanks.. That is the intended behavior.. Duplicate of #119 . Fixed in 8d20a15.. Google Play release is planned so this is not needed.. That is the intended behavior.. There is an option to show google assistant on the pill. And long press for assistance is a rom feature, not by the launcher.. Duplicate of #212. Duplicate of #212 . Fixed in f689b33. You know that this is an old bug and still open a new issue?. It's a feature.. Duplicate of #468 and #62. Should be fixed with the next update. Please report back.. And you already have app info in the long press shortcuts too.. @Younes-L there are tons of 7.1.2 custom ROMs.. 5.0 doesn't have the reveal animation.. The \"Transparent Dock\" option really makes the dock transparent but still there. . You just said the answer after your question so this can be closed.. No informations!. It is being implemented, not implemented.. This is a weird issue that happens when there is only one home screen. A workaround is to create a new page and then remove it.. Duplicate of many issues here and does not follow the issue template.. I will consider this as swiping is useless after locking the desktop anyway.. What do you mean by \"lucent folders\"?. The intended behavior of \"Do not change\" is to use system settings (circle if the system choose round icons and normal icons otherwise). And the none option is for icons to have freeform shape.\n. There is already an option to put assistant shortcut in the pill.. > Sorry, but I don't know how to do this right.\nAs I said, move the default to a separate resource and override that resource instead.. This should be fixed with 580ffcb.. Somehow Google Translate app doesn't have a circle icon. This also happens on official Pixel Launcher too.. Then that's the expected behavior.. b09ca95. @divadsn This issue is not about the antenna. There are two widget buttons in the popup.. I think this would be more efficient since the color extraction service does not run on every resume and is already used in other parts.\nAlso, what about live wallpapers?. But it's not efficient as it is run on every resume and the method I suggested already does this.. My point is that you can still use that value to show/hide gradient.. It is actually calculated on every resume, not on restart. And what if the user want to have a live wallpaper without the shadow?. A switch would make this feature completely pointless and calculating on every resume is worse. A typical user would go back to the home screen more often than changing wallpapers.. Settings -> Behavior -> Lock desktop. Fixed by #921.. Fixed with 6b0b2ff. 100% Truth- You replies to a 7 months old issue and Lawnchair doesn\u2019t prevent you from launching your apps.. No. Lawnchair doesn\u2019t prevent you from launching apps you want. Your point is invalid.. @tvteja I develop Xposed modules and I understand that root might be required. But I can\u2019t imagine any situation that you\u2019d need piracy tools to develop.. It is hidden in Lawnchair because clicking is not going to do anything useful.. The wallpapers app is hidden from the app drawers like on Pixel Launcher. You can still access it by long pressing a blank space and click wallpaper.. Please don't post filtered logs. They're useless.. @eggsgent The Google Now page is a part of the Google app.. I think they serve as an indicator so that the user knows the shortcuts can be dragged. Normal clicks are also ignored inside the \"drag handler\". @fonix232 Nah, just keep it paid and then add in-app purchases for people that want to donate multiple times.. That would go against Google Play rules. No payment methods other than IAP are allowed in apps.. As @reC0D3D stated above, translations aren\u2019t imported into v2 yet.. Unfortunately, Google didn't add an API for apps to control the back button visibility. Sorry about that.. I also have no idea why you dislike the outlines icons. Each person has their own opinion. . That\u2019s not possible. . Already have a temporary workaround (1262c06) but will need some more debugging to actually fix this.. It clutters up the list while you can just drag to the top to uninstall.. Before Android Pie, the recents apps view is a part of the system ui and can\u2019t be changed without modifying it. Good Lock can do this because it\u2019s made by Samsung and replaces the system ui.. It doesn\u2019t require icon packs if your calendar app supports this feature.. Any screenshots?. @TheMatten As @ReC0D3D stated in #1268, we've already made some progress on it.. Please use the issue template and try to provide screen recordings if you're not good at English. That will help us understand the issue.. That's actually the current behavior. . This is intentional. If you change an icon on desktop, it\u2019s only applied for that specific icon. If you want to change everywhere, do it from the app drawer.. Please attach the crash log.. Then that\u2019s the correct behavior. Lawnchair follows the system night mode and Google Messenger app toggles that.. This is implemented in alpha versions of v2.. @lyl12321 Please include a screenshot. That will help identify the issue.. 1. They're aligned in the exact same way as they do on Pixel Launcher\n2. The Google Feed is completely controlled by the Google App, which is something we can't change. . No you can't. units is a String but the method argument requires a WeatherUnits.. Finishing and restarting an activity is not equal to restarting the launcher. There are some static references that will still persist when all activities are destroyed.. Also, you can't just cast a Context to an Activity and expect it to always work. If you really need to, change the method signature or add a check before casting.. Actually this is just damping the scroll distance, not as demanding as the spring animation.. ",

What's up with that?. Bro, same here Mr Steve. I tried resizing the icon font on desktop, but the folders didn't take that either.. Same here.\nDon't forget RAM usage. Mine for Lawnchair is about 100-130 MB. That's a problem for a phone with only 1 GB of RAM.. Same here. I had that problem before Landscape and Shortcuts.. Just go to the settings and clear Lawnchair data. Don't do this if you want to keep your layout. The same delay happens to me too. Same.

You've made me curious about that now...  ^.^. > Are you using Google Chrome?\nYep, standard android Google Chrome, Desktop mode checkbox option is disabled.  Hmm...\nThere seem to be no media-queries in the CSS that do anything like that, so it looks like they are serving actual different content based on what they are detecting, and it must be detecting wrong (server-side browser detection is always a stupid choice).  Interesting.... Please, @Dondrejohnson5, for the sake of all Github Issue trackers, please please please use proper Issue names.  ^.^;\nLawnchair request 26 is entirely non-descriptive and is entirely useless when tracking.  ^.^;.

For now, this won't be added.\nAs a side idea, if a button for opening the app drawer is added then the old google launcher auto-focused the app search bar when pressing and holding the app drawer button for a third second, where tapping it just opened it as normal. Probably the easiest way to implement it is just to take a snapshot of the app menu scrolled to the top (since that is how it naturally opens) and hold on to it, displaying it scaling up until the full app menu is loaded and swapped to at the end of the animation (scaling the animation so it does not end until the app icons are loaded).  This would, however, prevent people from tapping on an icon 'while' it is scaling up to try to load it as some people would naturally try to do, but that could be worked around by capturing the input events and running them once the app drawer loads..

Whole UNIX is based on simple and small programms like grep, cat, sort, tail, cut, sed, sh, echo, test.. You are using a very outdated version of LawnChair, aren't you? (I use 1.1.0.1809). See also #1035. But being better than the original would be great .... New apps are added to the appdrawer. If I like to have an apps on my homescreen too I have to decide where to put it. I'd really hate a launcher if it would alter my homescreens without asking me.... An option, to sort the drawer by installation time (desc.) would be helpful to find the newly installed apps. See also #1111. I'm using it since june 2017 on some devices. It never added apps to the homescreen by itself... I know other launchers will or can optionally do that. As an option (off by default) it would be okay (for me).. Ok, it depends on setting in Google Play Store, where you can enable automatic addition of new apps to the homescreen. Cause I don't use g-apps or play services (I don't install them) I never noticed that behavior... . You'll find most v2 versions at \nhttps://www.apkmirror.com/apk/deletescape/lawnchair/. \n",

The developer(s) may not use Oreo or may not use desktop web shortcuts (I need them to control my entertainment center).   I reported the issue without any particular complaint.  In this case, I already said its a deal breaker.  In case your English is bad, this means I am NOT using it any longer.

How about someone looks at the code and finds the bug and fixes it rather than wasting my time looking for a work around?\nI might be willing to look at it when I have time, but its gonna be a long while.. My apologies, but if it the issue could be rectified without looking at the source, I would have done it. \nYes, crashes come first, usability next, but dark themes, weather, O styling, and all the prettiness should take a back seat to basic things like widget placement IMHO.   It's not an \"enhancement\".. My interest is purely because it's open source.\nOn Jul 15, 2017, John Philpott notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@uudruid74  \"I don't like \"pills\" on my desktop and I have no need to\nclone the pixel's UI\" - maybe this isn't the right launcher for your\nrequirements as it aims mainly to replicate the Pixel launcher for\nnon-Pixel devices. I'm not being rude, honestly, its just that there's\na lot of launchers out there that don't have the pill and don't look\nlike the pixel UI...\n\n-- Sent with K-@ Mail - the evolution of emailing.. That clearly shows the pill in the space.  If I can turn off the pill, I should be able to put my own widget in the space.   IMHO, the \"pill\" is the \"enhancement\" and basic functionality is broken\nOn Jul 15, 2017, John Philpott notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nOK, but it is possible to use the space in the meantime - you just have\nto play a little, try a few things;)\n\n\n-- Sent with K-@ Mail - the evolution of emailing..

No you most certainly have not.  Look at the very first picture I posted.  I want a damn widget to extend from the top of the screen down more than 1 freaking row.   It's bug.  It doesn't work.  Shove your attitude up your ass with your damn pill.   If I wanted a pill at the top I'd use the built in one.   I want a damn clock at the top of my screen and I want it BIG, not 1 line high. \nI was very plain that if it was possible without source, I would have done it.  Now quit being an ass.\nOn Jul 15, 2017, John Philpott notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI'm finished here. I've given you two screenshots of me having done\nwhat your original issue says can not be done I.E. resizing a widget in\nthe pill area and moving a widget into that area from below it.

From experience, this is accurate and has native support for party/mostly cloudy/sunny weather conditions.\nThe only downside is that you get 500 free calls, unlike OWM which provides 50,000.\nSent from my Google Nexus 5 using FastHub.

If you're using the release version, you can wait until the next version is released which will include the weather. \nIf you're comfortable, you can download the source from the alpha branch, manually build it in Android Studio, add your Open weather map api key as a variable and build the apk. \nSent from my Google Nexus 5 using FastHub. In what way exactly?. Can you provide a screenshot of the error which you are getting?. Well if the user decides not to take it down, then it is the right thing to do, to report the app to Google.

Hi again, I just updated to version 1.2.0.1878 from Google Play and the app language is set to English although system language is nb-NO.\nThe Norwegian translation (app strings) was fully translated on May 21st I think, then the additional 45 new strings added 4 days ago were also translated. Could it be that the Norwegian translations are not used by Android because of the locale code? \"values-no\", while Norwegian locale for Android is nb-NO.

It would be nice to see the translation live in a functional app (preferably officially released), to verify that they look good in a product. Thanks for looking into it.. Hi, wound not a setting to make the navigation bar opaque fix this behaviour for the affected users? (is there such a feature request already?). This option is missing in current Lawnchair V2 alpha builds, please bring it back! . Hi, was this issue fixed? Issue 790 looks similar: https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/Lawnchair/issues/790. Thanks David, I don't quite understand why third party SDK is needed to show opaque navigation bar in the app drawer, isn't the drawer part of the launcher itself? Google apps like Gmail and Chrome both use opaque navigation bars on my Samsung S9.. @paphonb I modified my feature request to be specifically about \"all Lawnchair launcher windows only\".\nCurrently the navigation bar is opaque on the home screen, but transparent in the app drawer.. No, i've commented on missing translations in https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/Lawnchair/issues/175. A few other comments:\nTranslations are added to Norwegian by non-natives, this should be avoided to keep the translations at the highest possible quality (example of a translation which doesn't make sense):\nhttp://translate.lawnchair.info/translate/lawnchairandroid/11/en-no#q=Set+default+launcher\nEnglish strings are added to Norwegian translations, why?\nhttp://translate.lawnchair.info/translate/lawnchairandroid/11/en-no#q=read+home+settings+and+shortcuts\nNorwegian translations are updated by non-natives, which may result in less uniformity and introduce errors, like in this example: http://translate.lawnchair.info/translate/lawnchairandroid/11/en-no#q=hjem-knapp\n. Thanks, will the translations also be applied to version 1 through a maintenance release or is all focus moved to version 2 and no further updates to version 1?\nThere are some translations in V2 alpha, but those are not coming from Crowdin.\nWhere can the other issues I have mentioned in the comment above be discussed and addressed?. Hi, when are you planning to sync the translations? Please add them in good time before the final so they can be reviewed on a device. Thanks. Not synced as of 2.0.370 alpha.. Thanks for the reply.

    "KieronQuinn": "It is absolutely possible to get the static shortcuts on <Android 7.1. It's nothing to do with UIs at all, and doesn't even need you to copy source from AOSP. You just have to do a process that is quite slow, and a little hacky. As far as I am aware, this is how other launchers do it, and it does work (I used the method in Custom Quick Settings):\nFor each of the packages on the device:\n- Load the APK's absolute location using ApplicationInfo.publicSourceDir (you MUST use the GET_META_DATA and GET_SHARED_LIBRARY_FILES flags when using getInstalledApplications)\n- Use this location along with ZipFile to load the APK as a zip (you can do this, strangely)\n- Load the manifest file using ZipFile.getEntry(\"AndroidManifest.xml\"), and get the byte representation from the file as you would any other\n- Decompress the XML. This is a bit difficult, I based my code off this: https://stackoverflow.com/a/4761689/1088334\n- Parse the XML as you would any other, searching for a meta-data tag with the android:name of \"android.app.shortcuts\". In the case of Lawnchair, you would need to store the activity component too obviously, but that wasn't required for CQS\n- The android:resource attribute is what you want here, it will be in the form of a resource ID (use Integer.parseInt(..., 16)). That's the hard bit done.\n- Use PackageManager.getResourcesForApplication to get the resources for the package, and use PackageManager.getXml to get the XML file for reading. The XML is in a standard format, like this: https://developer.android.com/samples/AppShortcuts/res/xml/shortcuts.html. Parse that, and use your resources for application to load the icons and labels.\nThat's it! I do recommend storing this data in the case of a launcher though, as it's quite a slow process to do every relaunch, but please only do so on <7.1, it's not a great idea to store shortcuts on >=7.1 because they change often with dynamic shortcuts. @AxiK101 I'm busy with my own projects right now so am not taking on any others but will consider it in the future. I can't see why it wouldn't (assuming Lawnchair does, I've never checked), it works fine on 5.x for Custom Quick Settings. Sesame appears to mostly make use of deeplink URIs, if you install it and check the config file it produces (needs root), you can see what it's linking to. \nA good example of this is FB Messenger, where you can simply do:\nam start -d fb-messenger://groupthreadfbid/<id>\nwhere ID is the numeric ID of a group thread (check messenger.com's URLs) and it will open the thread\nMessenger has loads of these, as does Facebook, Instagram, and loads of other apps. Hell, you can even use normal URLs in some cases, like for Discord:\nam start -d https://discordapp.com/channels/<id>\nThe reason I'm so for app shortcuts is I'm actually in the process of making Custom App Shortcuts, which edits the system shortcuts.xml file (API 25+) and has similar results to Sesame, but has more possibilities for launch (for example Sesame can't open links to group chats in some messenger clients, CAS can, as it has more privileges), as well as supporting any launcher that supports app shortcuts (except Action launcher, because that uses a strange caching method - hence why I was against caching for Lawnchair on API 25+). If we're being strict to the guidelines, I highly recommend this colour picker library, which I've used personally and offers a good compromise between material design (the preset picker) and custom colours with the palette picker. . Can you not drag the icon to the top of the screen to remove? The delete icon was removed from the long press menu a bit ago. This has been fixed in recent commits but there's no github release with it built in yet . The shortcuts you are seeing working are static shortcuts. They can be and were backported. Dynamic shortcuts (the missing ones) cannot be backported. Nova has its own shortcut system.. It would require developers to implement it, which nobody would do. If Sesame ever allow third party launchers (ie. those other than Nova) to use their shortcuts, then I'm sure the Lawnchair devs would be interested. But for now, there's no way to do it. \nIt's unauthorised, and because it has the same package name it's going to be an issue for the actual Lawnchair developers. The license may allow it but it's common courtesy to at least change to the package name, especially when the original developers are known to be pushing it to the play store themselves . If it gets taken down, the package name does not become available. The only way to get the package name is to have the \"developer\" who uploaded it to transfer the listing to the correct account and upload a new APK. \"Lock desktop\" is the name other launchers use, maybe the setting should be inverted and have that as its title with a short description (\"Disable editing homescreen\") as the subtitle . Did you give Lawnchair access to notifications in the settings? . Yes, that's definitely Lawnchair.\nBut it gets worse. The donation link goes to the developer's personal PayPal, the translators list is missing Deletescape, the app icon designer is changed to the developer's name (which I suppose is ok, the icon is different), as well as the summary. Here's a screencast of the app: https://streamable.com/ul7bf. https://www.xda-developers.com/get-google-pixel-2-pixel-launcher-bottom-search-bar/. Pretty sure this one is caused by Android itself, I've seen other launchers do it too. It's probably a feature, if a launcher is crashing you don't want to be restarting it and it just looping crashing do you?. Without testing this, I believe this would break the entire launcher. startsWith(\"\") returns true for every package name (and this agrees with me)\nIf this is what you wanted to do, to make the launcher useless, then go right ahead. Otherwise, you probably shouldn't merge this\nEDIT: Confirmed with testing, it does. Nice job.. Any idea why \"com.android.protips\" is blocked? As far as I can tell it's only been used for the old protips widget in Android: this one. This was taken down but appears to now be back, good spot @amirzaidi \nReported again.. ",

I think I have a less confusing description of the issue(s) now :\nSetting icon shape to \"none\" will prevent apps that changes their icons to be displayed with the correct icon.\nSetting icon shape to \"do not change\" does the same thing as \"circle\" , for some reason. I am not a Pixel user and I've been using all sort of launchers, including lawnchair, none of them enabled round icons by default. It seems to me that having round icons with icon shape set to \"do not change\" is a bug.\nWhile icon shape is set to anything that isn't \"none\" :\n\u2022 apps that support adaptative will have the correct shape, \n  \u2022 apps that have a round icon will turn round, \n  \u2022 apps that only have 1 icon will keep displaying same icon\n  \u2022 apps that can change their icon will finally display the correct icon, too bad it doesn't have to be round and all other apps will either be round or some other shape.\nIn conclusion I'm seeing 2 bugs here, \"do not change\" shouldn't be circle, and \"none\" breaks apps with multiple icons.\nScreenshot(s) below :\n\nThis is do not change, displayed as circles, apps that can change their icons will display the correct icon (ICS camera for Snap and hexagon for Flamingo)\n\n\nThis is none, apps have their default uniquely shaped icons that we all love, except for the apps that have multiple icons, which are displayed with the icons their appear with when seen under system settings or app info (flamingo and snap)\n\nDevice is Oneplus A0001/Bacon, 7.1.2 AOSP+CAF, lawnchair build 1238. android version ?. could be related to #364 . must be stock since you can only have 7.1.2 on stock Nexus, Pixel, wileyfox , ROM (all stock) and LG V30 which isn't yet available.. @paphonb yes, sorry for misunderstood.

I don't use it at all, and feel like Lawnchair could see great benefits if freed from these Google limitations.\nWhile I definitely understand why they chose to make it this way, it's kind of poorly executed (there's no reason for the first screen to be immovable \u2013 small issue but non negligible imo).\nUnfortunately I don't think I can reopen the issue, however I can point you to a similar issue that's currently still opened; it is referenced above your comment.. @divadsn  I'm sorry, did I miss something ?\nWas such feature added recently ?. Well that's embarrassing \ud83d\ude05 apparently I had some things to say on the subject as well \ud83e\udd23. I think I finally understand why... The first screen is frozen for the same reasons the pixel search bar/pill widget is frozen, because it's a regular widget that overwrites whatever was in the first row, instead of occupying an additional row in the desktop grid. Should we move the first screen to second position, another pixel widget would get created on the new first screen and other unexpected behaviours.. when the drawer is about to make place for the homescreen, the dragged icon reappears, as if the drawer was displayed the way it looks normally. can confirm it happens on GNL, and lawnchair is based on Launcher3.. check #702.

And it works as it should in the latest Lawnchair versions. So this issue could be closed I think,. Does this problem still exist for you? I cannot reproduce this.. Cannot recreate your issue on Nexus 5X 8.1.0 and Xiaomi Mi A1 7.1.2 with Lawnchair version 1.1.0.1730.. This bug is still present in Lawnchair version 1.1.0.1834.\nXiaomi Mi A1 8.0.0.. Click to https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.deletescape.lawnchair.plah&hl=en\nAt the bottom of the page you see ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, click to View details in Permissions tile, where every permission is explained in detail. If you know your launcher well you can immediately connect every permission with various Lawnchair functions. There is really no problem at all. Try to check another well established launchers, like Nova, etc.\n. This bug is still present in Lawnchair version 1.1.0.1730.. Please don't forget click to smile icon on the top right of the first post and select +1 to confirm this issue.\nI hope that we get the attention of the developers now as confirmed.\nThank you very much.. I am sorry for this. I had a false feeling that no one noticed this issue when there were no reactions.\nThen it was hard to reproduce the issue by other user...\nNow I know that you know \ud83d\udc7c \nThank you!. This bug is still present in Lawnchair version 1.1.0.1834.\nXiaomi Mi A1 8.0.0.. What?\nI have a feeling that we don't understand each other standpoint. Lawnchair team asked users for reporting bugs: \"Check out Lawnchair's GitHub. Help out by fixing bugs, flagging issues, or even by just downloading and testing!\". So I am just reporting bugs here, because I really like Lawnchair and want to help you.\nOr did you mean by your reply when only icons on the top row of every your screen are affected by this bug that it is normal or only small issue? I never encounter such a behaviour in any other launcher.\nTo be honest I even didn't understand previous comment \"This problem is caused by DropTargetBar is on the top of shortcut, so we can not click to shortcut by easily way, if touch to botton of icon then we can open it.\". Is this just an confirmation of my workaround I already mentioned?\nThis issue hasn't any assignees, any labels, etc - so it looks like unnoticed. The same was/is true for two old issues I linked. I already explained my standpoint in comment on 8 Dec 2017.\nI just actualized this bug report today for the new Lawnchair version installed and the new Android version installed.. Ok, but how could reporting and participated users know that devs already have any particular reported issue on their todo list? By telepathy? That silence is even reason for many duplicate issues.\nUsing this would be better way:\nAssignees\nNo one assigned\nLabels\nNone yet\nProjects\nNone yet\nMilestone\nNo milestone\nBecause if I did know from here that this is known bug I didn't waste my and your time with another issue #980. I precisely checked repository of issues prior publishing it and only noticed the same reports in issues #339 and #525, but these old issues stayed unnoticed, unconfirmed, I mean formally and publicly here. Another problem was that it was very hard to reproduce this issue by other users (no one from my friends which are using Lawnchair know about this issue when I asked them) so I tried to document it as best as possible.\nAnd the reaction? It wasn't Thank you or Confirmed or Assigned, but \"don't bother us with raising attention, we already noticed it, but we don't have time\". Even a few seconds for sticking the appropriate Label?. There is no need to apologize, I highly appreciate your work, but please do not make the error reporting a bigger problem than it is. So your last reply should be carved on each page here :). Very well documented and understandable description, but I have not met this yet on both my devices and I cannot reproduce this glitch. I thoroughly tested this on Nexus 5X 8.1.0 and Xiaomi Mi A1 7.1.2 with Lawnchair version 1.1.0.1730. Maybe there is another condition that causes this error on your device. Could you please describe your personal Lawnchair setting, especially where you differ from defaults?. Oh, your settings differ very much from mine. Maybe I'll try yours and retest, but it'll take some time :). Exactly, great! You saved my time for retesting with your settings...\nSo now we have know the culprit :+1: .\nI was using None, because I prefer various original icons instead of unified look.\nAs soon as I changed icons shape to Circle, I could immediately reproduce this glitch on Mi A1 with Nougat, but I cannot reproduce the same on Nexus 5X with Oreo. So maybe this glitch is even somewhat connected with back-porting shortcuts feature from Oreo to Nougat.. Could you please take a look at overlooked issue #980 in return? :angel:. Thank you for your time, but your comment should be placed in issue #980, not here.\nDid you performed all the steps to reproduce exactly step by step? It is very important. I edited them to be more precise now. And please take a look to the other two connected issues to get whole picture about this bug. BTW issue #980 is icon shape independent :smile:.

Can you check if this version fixes this issue?\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/zbz4y8ihg2ntx3i/app-debug-textscalling.apk\nIt's latest alpha code + one commit that is in PR state.

Because I can see the font is completely different than the default one in launcher.\nIs this screenshot sent when using 367 dpi or other?. The fix was needed anyway as otherwise it was messed up even on emulator with 360dpi and I've also noticed that there were no bottom margins in last row in app drawer on my Huawei P10 (stock dpi, 100% scale).\nI think that this issue is something else.. I'm unable to reproduce it on 6\" emulator 1080p (as Xperia XA Ultra) :(\nHere is what I see in different conditions when changing phone-wide DPI and in-app scaling.\nOn max phone dpi and max scaling there is some text clipped but on Xperia you have strange margin between the icon and the label.\n\n. Hard to say. I just cannot reproduce it. It's working fine on my Huawei P10 (default DPI), Nexus 5 (default DPI) and on emulator 6\" (same DPI as your xperia). All in 1080p.\nWhat settings do you have in Phone Settings->Display->Font Size and Display Size? Is it default everywhere? If not try to set to default and then change in-app scale.. @AxiK101 one more question. If you set up explicitly 4 columns and 4 or 5 rows in app drawer - does it help in 1.1.0.1265?. Could you please test this version. It's the latest alpha with text fix.\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/file/3gic7tbaztkw0en/app-debug-750fix.apk\nPlease do the following\n1. Export your current settings (settings and database)\n2. Uninstall your current version\n3. Install this debug version\n4. Import your previous settings (settings and database)\n5. Go to Settings->General and you'll notice 'Icon padding scale' slider (in the Drawer section)\nPlease let me know if it helps if you decrease the slider and to what value you need to decrease in order to look good on your device.. @AxiK101 thanks and sorry for the inconvenience!. From what I can see you cannot create Android Terminal shortcut if you don't provide a Label for it.\nThe same behavior is on my stock Huawei Launcher - you need to provide command and a label to the widget.. I think it's app-related thing as on Huawei Launcher I have exactly the same behavior.\nI don't have Nova launcher to test.. There isn't such an option 'use Pixel circular icons where possible'.\nGo to Pixel UI->Change icon shape and select 'Circle'\n\n. aaa it's 6.0. sorry my bad. Could you check if this app fixes your issue http://www.mediafire.com/file/93s5kn9es4nbarf/app-debug-marshmallowfix.apk ? It's the latest alpha with the fix. This is a debug version. Export your settings. Uninstall existing version. Install this test version and let me know. Finally you can uninstall test version and install release version and import the settings. yes, export database and settings. and finally inport settings and database. In 'Documents' directory. By clicking import. Yes, they are read from the 'Document/Lawnchair' directory. Uninstalling the app won't remove Document/Lawnchair directory so no worries. I think @deletescape will close it when he merges #764 :). For #750 I have an idea with one more slider in preference ;) It's a beauty of Android where every phone works different. Settings->Pixel UI->Change icon shape->Circle.\nAFAIK google calendar icon changes its icon each day only if circular icons are selected.\nPreviously circular icons were selected by default and that's all.. Do not change in previous versions worked in the same way as Circular.\nNow it's as follow:\nDo not change - use AOSP icons but with original shape\nNone - use standard icon from your ROM\nCircular - pixel icons in circles\nYes, the naming is a bit confusing.\nIf you are on AOSP based rom then Do not change and none will work the same way. On other devices where ROM manufacturers use different icons then you'll notice different icons.\nAs for dynamic calendar icons goes - this is strange as on my phone it worked only on circular icons. I may take a look at this. It would be usefull if you provide me any previous version where dynamic calendar icons worked on non circular icons. It definitely was working previously on 'Do not change' as this setting previously generated Circular icons as well.\nOr did you have original shapes and calendar icons was dynamic on original (non-circular) icons?. ok, so no bug here, only confusion :).

There is a features list on the Google Play page but it says nothing about the weather feature.. > If you know your launcher well you can immediately connect every permission with various Lawnchair functions.\nI rather thought of users that do not know Lawnchair yet.\nAn example for an app that explains why the permissions are needed is vlc:\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.videolan.vlc\nYou have to click on \"READ MORE\" and scroll down a bit:\n\nIt needs \"full network access\", to open network and internet streams.\nIt needs \"prevent phone from sleeping\" in order to prevent... your phone from sleeping when watching a video.\n.... @fonix232 Do you know who was the original author of the code was?\n\nApart from that, on my device it worked and as I already pointed out, false-positives could already happen before, so I am quite optimistic that nothing will be broken (but of course other proposals are welcome).. OK, what happens after my change is: If I\n add an icon of App A to Lawnchair's home screen\n force close Lawnchair (this could maybe also happen if the device runs out of ram)\n* uninstall A\nthen the icon of A will remain on the home screen, greyed out, until the user deletes it manually. \nBut I do not think that this scenario is very likely, the issue of icons disappearing after a restart seems more important to me. Still, other proposals are welcome as my PR is not a perfect solution.\nAnyway, this is probably what the original programmer wanted to avoid.. Now, will you accept my pull request or not?. ",

Yep, I'm still on Marshmallow. I don't have that option. Thank you! Unfortunately I'm unable to install it (at the end of installation it says \"app not installed\").. Sorry, how can I export my current layout? Export database?. And once exported, where is their location? When I tap \"import\" it just say \"success!\". Ok, thanks. How can I import them though? Sorry, I'm new to this. I imagine they are automatically imported directly from the directory, right?. Thank you, it's fixed! If you want I can send you a screenshot. https://imgur.com/gallery/09v2O. Can I close it?. Ok, thanks for the help :). You're right, it also happens to me in alpha 1.1.0.1300. Awesome, thank you!. Wait a sec, where can I download this version?.

Also its the same in v1 stable from the play store\n\ndid you set some special settings (or do not use the gboard keyboard?)?. looks like this is the code that sends the request to the play store. \nI would propose to optionally launch the 1st search result hit app. \n@deletescape, what do you think about this? I could make a PR.\n. @deletescape I'm fine with only implementing it for v2. Is v2 based on the alpha branch? Can you point me to the right folder, please? \n. I see. I will wait then. I thought the alpha branch is v2. I would recommend to add a note on the main readme of this project. \n. that option would be great. It also available in the oxygenos launcher and the default on ios when you pull down on the homescreen. . @deletescape but many people are used to pull down the notification shade. So it should rather be an option for the pull up gesture. Hence, thats why @GAZ082 suggested to just make an option to directly put the focus into the search field (and therefore trigger the keyboard) of the app drawer.. @divadsn indeed. Again, more precise: The feature request is about enabling the \"Search Apps\" text field focus directly when you pull up the app drawer.. @divadsn long press is not as quick as a gesture. Actually the OnePlus launcher calls the feature quick search and has integrated it in the small menu next to the input field  . @divadsn do you have some arguments for not including this option? I could provide a PR. good to know. thanks!. @divadsn can you point me to the code? I would like to investigate why it is not working as I would expect. @divadsn I guess its this part?\nI will check why it doesn't work as expected. Alright, I will wait until the source code of v2 is released. I will reopen when that has happend.\nalso, I thought the alpha branch is v2.

I posted my arguments here but I don't want to spam opening another issue with the same content. hope my arguments would prevail.. @Younes-L of course you do. we share the same arguments, but we're both unable to solve this issue.. :wink:. you're right, I'm closing this. thank you!. thanks! i'm a bit ashamed that i didn't find this out myself. do anyone thinks that it would still be a good idea to have a separate icon for this (for people that have pinch to overview disabled)? if not i'm going to close this issue.. seems you have a Google device? on my device (Sony) this feature is also there but hidden so i would've never thought it's there. you have to tap on an empty space (where an icon should be but it's not).\n\n.

I hope I understood correctly.\nI used both the Lawnchair wallpaper picker and the built-in Android one, both producing the same result, which is to be expected considering the information you provided.\nI suspect that might have to do with copying the file to a temporary location, changing the compression. If that's true, maybe Lawnchair could copy the PNG file instead of converting it to JPEG. (It's probably not that simple, I know)\nOtherwise, if this is a rendering issue, I think rewriting the implementation would be to much work, so the issue should be closed..

Well, you can calculate the color of the wallpaper, but, you cannot calculate the brightness of the wallpaper.\nI mean, the color can be red, blue, green or whatever, but, you cannot get the brightness of each pixel and calculate the overall brightness of the wallpaper. It only runs once the activity is restarted and also runs in separate thread and has no impact on battery life.\nAND I already mentioned that, if the wallpaper that has been set is a live wallpaper, it doesn't calculate, instead, it sets the gradient and leaves it that way.\nPlease go through the code once for reference. @paphonb we can implement a switch to decide wether the user needs shadow on the lwp. The brightness is calculated on every resume ( atleast that is the method i thought ) on activity resume, the brightness is calculated as the wallpaper may have been changed. Else, we should implement a method to keep  a watch to tell if the wallpaper is set (which is a broadcast imo) and we need a broadcast listener.

In my understanding if I squash locally I won't be able to push. Do I need to open a new pull request on a new branch?\n\nI'd rather make it with a slider only instead of having an additional switch and keep the default value, just like we did with other customization options.\n\nThat's what I had in mind, too. Only the default value is not a fixed one, it depends on the extracted colour. \n. @divadsn If I'm not mistaken, in current versions, the dock opacity is chosen based on the wallpaper color, regardless of the Dock uses wallpaper colors setting. If that is correct, adding only a slider in the settings would not allow users to use either automatic, or manual dock opacity. Users might want to use the extracted color, with or without a custom opacity ; others might want to use a dark/light themed dock, with or without custom opacity.\n. @divadsn I know it works, no problem with that. My point is, if I remove the custom dock opacity toggle, the app behaviour will change or uses cases will be missing.\nCurrently, users not using the extracted color have their dock opacity set to either 12%, 18% or 25% depending on the chosen theme.\nIf I understand correctly, what you suggest is to link the opacity slider to the Use extracted color toggle.\nUsers might like to:\n Not use extracted color, use default opacity (currently possible)\n Not use extracted color, set custom opacity (will miss if I remove the toggle)\n Use extracted color, use extracted opacity (currently possible) (will miss if I remove the toggle)\n Use extracted color, set custom opaticy\nIt's possible I do not understand what you meant, sorry.\n\nI realize the Transparent dock setting is redundant with the suggested slider and toggle, as one might set the dock being not transparent but with no opacity. I think it should be removed.. Thanks. Tell me if it needs any modifications!\nIn my last comment, I dumped:\n\nI realize the Transparent dock setting is redundant with the suggested slider and toggle, as one might set the dock being not transparent but with no opacity. I think it should be removed.\n\nI thought about it and realized I have no idea how to maintain users configuration in case I removed this setting. If anyone can help with this, before you merge!.

If I keep them shown, they'll be shown in all apps. There are apps that hsve exceptions and force the buttons to be shown, and I can't toggle them to be hidden. If you go to the Settings > Display > Navigation Bar > Show and hide button, you should see a small dot at the left side of the navigation bar. I double tap it and hide it, but it stays hidden even in the launcher.. @Frontear I'm not saying that anything bugs out inside the launcher, I'm saying that the nav bar is hidden. In the stock and other launchers, the nav bar is supposed to be shown, and forced to be shown with a transparent background instead of the white.

    "seankurth": "Just for anyone else who finds this thread through Google, if it ever does censor an actual pirated app from the app drawer, that is intended behavior. There's been a lot of controversy over this across social media, which the developers often end up on the wrong side of. I thought I'd clear up that while the purpose of a launcher in general is to...well, launch applications you have installed on your phone, and it can feel very shady and uncomfortable if it does otherwise, Lawnchair has another purpose that is clearly stated in its description on every app store and forum. That purpose is to replicate the Google Pixel experience as closely as possible on phones that aren't Pixels, will never have a recent enough Android version to use the latest Pixel features natively systemwide, or both. There are a few very light cosmetic customization options, but beyond that, this app can never deviate too far from stock Pixel launcher features and APIs, because a forked Lawnchair that never fully merges will become more and more difficult to backport Pixel features to as time goes on and the two continue to more widely diverge.\nGuess what? Pixel Launcher censors patchers and patched apps, so Lawnchair must do so as well. If Lawnchair developers start deciding which features to leave out because they're bad, unnecessary, or annoying, and which ones are worthy of inclusion, then they can't claim to offer the Pixel experience. For better or worse, that's what users of this launcher want. If Lawnchair only offers a curated stock-like experience with a completely different base and implementations, and its only resemblance to Pixel launcher is that it's cosmetically updated to match the latest Pixel UI, then absolutely nothing would differentiate it from other launchers on the Playstore like Nova, Apex, or Rootless Pixel. Since it by design offers fewer features than those, it would certainly fail if it were yet another entirely independent third-party launcher. It would still be open-source, but most everyday smartphone users couldn't care less about software freedom, unfortunately. For those who want a stock Google-like experience, but don't care for the bleeding edge and the risks that come with it, v1 is still available in the Play Store, and will be available in the F-Droid repo forever. Other than Pie recents, there are few differences they'll notice in day-to-day use.\nPersonally, I support the developers' stance on protecting icon pack developers, who are typically talented individual graphic designers whose living depends on keeping their business or department going, and who rarely charge more than 99\u00a2. Well, except for A1 Design, but you'd never need to pirate those anyway since they're always on sale for free, not that you'd ever want their incomplete, procedurally generated, and sometimes stolen/kanged crap even for free anyway. Some charge $1.99, but those offer way more than double the value of the 99\u00a2 ones, typically exceeding OEM icon packs in their completeness, attention to detail, and professionalism. Regardless of whether or not you agree with that view, though, it must be understood that for the reasons I've already outlined, they'd still have to censor pirated apps anyway even if they didn't believe in the cause..
