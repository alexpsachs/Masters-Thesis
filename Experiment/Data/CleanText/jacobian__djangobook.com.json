    "lgp171188": "Is it a good idea to complete the whole update to Django 1.4.1 in a branch and merge it, or is it okay to do it in small parts like I have done now?\n. Also the python version and compatibility details need to be updated. I understand that Django 1.4 supports Python 2.5 to 2.7. Not sure about GIS framework. \n. Hi Jacob, I have incorporated the changes you suggested. Also made some changes for the Python version compatibility and Git instead of subversion for installing the \"development\" version. I am not sure if \"master\" branch needs to be used for the development version.\n. Once this book is updated to the latest and greatest Django version, will the old versions be still available on djangobook.com? If so, it'd be better to link to them. If not, we could link to the official Django documentation at least.\n. My bad. I copied the description from the official Django documentation and forgot to link 'How to deploy with WSGI' . I will make the changes and update the pull request.\n. ",
    "mpdaugherty": "@jacobian Do we have a style guideline for the .rst files?  I automatically removed whitespace at the end of the lines and wrapped paragraphs at 80 characters, but I'm afraid that this may make the diffs hard to read.  Let me know if it's appropriate or not.  Thanks!\n. Great; will do\n. Ah, I wasn't sure and didn't find a good source while googling.  Will update.\n. I agree that this note is a distraction from the point of the chapter.\nOn the other hand, I do think our examples should use raw strings, because that's what startproject puts into urls.py by default.  Therefore, I feel that the question would naturally occur to new users if they look at our examples vs. their urlconf and think \"Why do these strings start with 'r' and the ones in the book don't?\"\nWhat do you think about using raw strings, but leaving out the explanation?  Or, we could change this inline explanation to be something short like \"The r indicates a raw string instead of a normal string.  To find out why you would use one instead of the other, read the note at the end of this chapter.\" and then put the longer explanation at the end of the chapter.\n. Thanks; I updated the note.\n. ",
    "jacobian": "@mpdaugherty generally, I do exactly what you said - reformat and re-wrap as needed. It does make diffs slightly harder to read, but it makes the source easier to read so that's a tradeoff I'm OK with.\nThanks for the changes, I'll try to review and merge or let you know if there's anything that needs fixing.\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. Thanks! Looks great, I left a few TODOs.\n. See my comment on #18.\n. Yup, those look fine.\n. Probably can't just drop this in here without a brief note about it. Is this the first place csrf_token is used? If so we should add a note about the fact that's required for all forms and pointing readers to the security chapter (20?) for more details.\n. Fixed in #17.\n. This should have been fixed now.\n. It should just be books.models. It's possible there's other things wrong that lead to that not working, but those should be fixed, not this.\n. The book should cover the newest (1.5), and not mention the older layout. Can you update this please?\n. This is wrong; it should just be from books import ...\n. This doesn't actually seem to work.\n. This no longer applies; could you re-merge from master please?\n. I find \"You'll want to switch to the newer Django version.\" rather glib -- perhaps they don't want to switch (or can't). Perhaps instead replace this with a pointer to older documentation? Something like \"This book covers Django 1.4 and above, so if you're using an older version you probably want to consult Django's official documentation: [link to 1.3], [link to 1.2], etc.\"\n. Is this section in the book? If so this should be a link to the book. Otherwise, it should be a link to the docs.\n. Please fix the underline - should be the same length as the header.\n. This actually doesn't match the our current thinking about Django's release policy any more -- the plan is to always be backwards-compatible, at least as much as possible. So let's nix this whole paragraph.\n. \"at the earliest\" is actually wrong - we made it happen, and 1.5 will support 3.2 and above. This should reflect that.\n. This should probably use the exact snippet from the generated config file (i.e. with comments, etc.) instead of something similar.\n. This backend's been deprecated in favor of the psycopg2 one; we shouldn't mention it.\n. It's actually more complicated than that: see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/faq/install/#what-python-version-can-i-use-with-django.\n. This note is a distraction; it's not needed here.\n. In fact, I'd probably just not use raw strings at all. Backslashes rarely appear in URLs (and certainly not in well-formed ones) and so the distinction's just extra noise and confusion for new users. \n. This should probably be request.GET.get('q', '')\n. This should just be chapter02.html (no trailing slash); could you fix that please?\n. ",
