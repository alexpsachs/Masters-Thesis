All the methods in the RoboGuice class are static so you couldn't override them anyway.  What would you like to do?\n. It sounds like you don't actually need inheritance since you can't subclass anything, what you really need is a way to either bypass the per-application injector caching mechanism, or a way to access the map so you can rewrite the cache like you're doing above.\n\nI'll think on this.  My initial thinking is that we should provide a tool in RoboGuice.util to allow you to do what you need.\n.  Very interesting.  Could this be generalized?  eg. override bind() in DefaultRoboModule to check if the class being bound is ever injected?  If it's never used, then the bind() call would effectively do nothing.

I agree about JavaWriter.\n\nHm, you're right about the hierarchy filter, that may explain why i'm\nseeing problems with the groupon app.  It would be nice to not have to scan\nthe entire hierarchy since we should be able to compute the topmost class\nthat has annotations during annotations processing.  It would also be nice\nto not have to scan intermediate classes that don't have annotations.\nI'm definitely open to fixing the AnnotationDatabase class, it was more a\nproof of concept than real production code.\nNaming convention wasn't clear.  In the following example:\nclass Foo {\n     @Inject Bar bar;\n}\ngetClasses will return Foo, and getInjectedClasses will return Bar.  Names\nneed to be made more clear.  getClasses is the list of classes that require\ninspection for injection points, while getInjectedClasses is the list of\nclasses that have bindings.\nAndroidManifest makes sense.\n. The filtering out of intermediate classes is pretty valuable, because it\navoids having to scan every field, method, and constructor of that\nintermediate class.\nI think there's two things that we're doing essentially.  The first is\nchecking whether we have to proceed higher up in the hierarchy to scan for\nadditional injection points.  The second thing is checking whether we have\nto scan the class at our current location in the hierarchy.  This second\nthing is the list of classesContainingInjectionPoints in our annotation\ndatabase.  I'm not sure how to compute the first thing...\n. Looking for the code.  Is this the right branch to look at? https://github.com/stephanenicolas/roboguice/commits/mburton/exp/annotationprocessing-nonsilver-plus-optional-binding\n. Thanks for the submission.  My concern about this solution is that it seems like it will re-introduce an old bug with OnDestroy listeners.  See https://code.google.com/p/roboguice/issues/detail?id=237 and the reference to https://code.google.com/p/roboguice/issues/detail?id=158\nI think the right solution is to make fragments scoped, but that may require some big changes, so if we can find a workaround that works without reintroducing 158, then we should do it.\nAny thoughts on how to avoid reintroducing the problem?\n.

Reverted this pull request.  The icons do not seem to correspond to their descriptions (eg. Starbucks icon for getaways table cell)\n. done\n. Are you using proguard?  If so, try disabling it temporarily\nWhat does your pom look like?\n. Happily accepting PRs :)\n. Apologies, we're actively working on RoboGuice 4.0 so have been a little\nslow with 3.0 maintenance.  Expect some news about 4.0 in the next few\nweeks\u2026\n. what is this line doing?  comment would be helpful\n. bad idea.  depending on the exceptions that might get thrown, throwing a runtimeexception would be more appropriate\n. see other comments\n. seems like this is bypassing the base class' implementation of onCreateView.  \n\nMaybe a more general solution would be something like the following?\npublic View onCreateView(name,context,attrs) {\n    final View v = super.onCreateView(name,context,attrs);\n    if( name.indexOf('.') != -1 ) // only do injection on custom views\n        RoboGuice.injectMembers(this,view);\n    return view;\n}\n. rad\n. let's just add the new fragments into the existing astroboy sample, rather than creating a new one.  The existing sample needs to be updated for fragments anyway\n. see other comment\n. let's move this to a separate pull request.  I would love to get roboguice to pass lint without warnings, it's not that far off right now\n. are there any implications to this change for older devices?\n. Whoa?!

See RoboBroadcastReceiver\n. what is the \"echo y\" for?\n. see my previous comments.  Let's merge in the fragment changes into Astroboy rather than creating a new module\n. interesting that it wasn't required for android-9.\nI'm still hoping for https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/1395 some day! :)\n. lot of whitespace changes in this file.\nAlso, it appears that some functionality was lost (eg. GLOBAL_EVENT_MANAGER_NAME)\n. nice\n. is there a reason to pull this out into a property?  looks like it's only used once and it's always \".\"\n. I can no longer build in the roboguice/roboguice directory, it always fails: \n[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-checkstyle-plugin:2.10:check (checkstyle-check) on project roboguice: Failed during checkstyle configuration: cannot initialize module SuppressionFilter - Cannot set property 'file' in module SuppressionFilter to './test_suppressions.xml': unable to find ./test_suppressions.xml: InvocationTargetException: ./test_suppressions.xml (No such file or directory) -> [Help 1]\n. let's disable AvoidStarImport, it causes problems with the default IntelliJ configuration\n. I suggest adding      so that people can add a comment when a catch is intentionally ignored\n. Ah, this must be the reason.   Let's not do this, this will cause confusion for a normal behavior.\n. This is an example of tools being overly restrictive and forcing developers to do something when they've already done the right thing (commenting the empty block), and the developer, for lack of good choices, making the wrong choice.  This is why I think that commented empty blocks should be allowed.\n. Can this be converted to something like the following?\nfor (Class<?> c = iTypeLiteral.getRawType(); gim.isWorthInjecting(c); c = c.getSuperclass())\n. we use protected instead of private, unless there's a specific reason to prevent subclasses from overriding something.\n. what's this for?  Wouldn't this always have to evaluate to \"roboguice\"?\n. same question\n. see my comment on the other PR about other packages such as java, sun, etc.\n. I would make this an \"else if\".  It doesn't change the code flow at all, but it helps make the method more readable\n. duplicate calls get c.getName()\n. We generally prefer to make local variables final if reasonable.  (Not fields though.)\n. very helpful, thanks\n. yeah, otherwise the subclass won't be able to modify the field if they need to\n. ah, i see\n. is this comment necessary anymore?\n. is this check technically necessary?\n. same\n. i like this name\n. wish i could think of a better name for this\n. good catch\n. remove \"might need some\"\n. can you add the final qualifier for local variables?\n. why the lazy initialization?  Probably makes sense to move the HashMap and HashSet initialization into the field declaration\n. I generally prefer not to use printStackTrace.  Does the processingEnv messenger give us a better way to report the stacktrace?  If not, maybe just use throwable.printstacktrace to a stringwriter and use that in a second call to printmessage\n. looks like initializeModules would be cleaner if it just created the arraylist itself and returned it rather than modifying an empty one that's passed in.\n. oh, i see why you're doing it this way.  So that you can pass in a list of modules in addition to the ones that get initialized in initializeModules?  But it looks like the list that's passed in to initializeModules is always empty.  Am I missing something?\n. not totally sure I understand hasHadInjectionPoints.  When does reset get called?  Between every call to isWorthScanning? Is there a better way to carry the state between invocations?\n. what additional packages?\n. todo\n. this limits annotation processing to android projects. It would be nice if it worked with non-android projects as well, but that can be a future optimization\n. in general, I prefer to use protected instead of private for fields to allow subclasses to override.  In rare case I use private to specifically indicate to developers that there's some safety reason that I want to prevent subclasses from overriding. But most of the time, protected is a good default.\n. again with the printstacktrace.  throw runtimeexception instead? or maybe log a more informative message?\n. etc.\n. typo\n. do you know about the double-bracket method of initializing static maps?  Kind of fun\nprotected static Map<Class, String> mapSystemSericeClassToName = new HashMap<Class, String>() {{\n    put(LocationManager.class, Context.LOCATION_SERVICE);\n    put(WindowManager.class, Context.WINDOW_SERVICE);\n    ...\n}}\nI find it a little cleaner than using a separate static block, but personal preference may vary\n. can isInjectable be moved inside the bind() so that it doesn't have to be manually called?\n. nice\n. unrelated, @Macarse has done some work to get rid of these listeners entirely using lombok.  I don't have a sense for how much performance they cost, but it seems like using Matchers.any() can't come cheap\n. is it okay to put the static injection call inside this if? not sure\n. i'm confused.  looking at bind(), it looks like you already duplicate the same check that you have in isInjectable (lines 241 and 252). Seems like checking isInjectable is superfluous here\n. I forget the exact reason we do this.  I think it was because of weirdnesses in robolectric?\n. are you changing behavior here?  Not sure i understand this change.  is this going to cause a problem with testcases?\n. this is making assumptions about the order of the hierarchy traversal that aren't quite clear...\n. what if the factory could create a new hiearchy filter for each leaf class being scanned?  Then we coudl avoid the confusion of having to reset the filter between runs\n. hmmmm.... you're assuming that \"traversal operations vastly outnumber mutations\" (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CopyOnWriteArrayList.html)\nThat is true if you're only using the @Observes annotation to register listeners, but we programmatically register listeners fairly frequently when creating background tasks, for example.  It's not clear to me that this is going to perform better, and it might perform significantly worse...\n. is copyObservers still being used?\n. Oh, I see.  You're avoiding the copy that happens on every fire?  Okay, that sounds more efficient.\n. I'd like the process of adding roboguice to be dead simple.  Just add the roboguice library and you're done.\nWith this new change, they have to add two jars AND modify their compiler command line to add the package name.  How can we get this down to just a single jar file and no other changes for the common case?\n. Same here, i'd like for users to not have to make changes for the AndroidManifest for the default case.  Changing AndroidManifest is fine for customization, but for the default case it should not be necessary\n. better to use a setter\n. Are we still using the ANnotationDatabasePackage annotation?\n. indent\n. Do you think the extra map lookup causes any noticeable performance impact?  I'm guessing it's probably okay, just checking\n. I just did a quick search for \":\" to see where this string is being used, but i couldn't find it.  Where is it?\n. is printStackTrace avoidable? I don't see a lot of value in printing out the stacktrace, but if there is can we do it via the Messager instead of calling printStackTrace?\n. etc\n. see prev comment\n. Why is this necessary?\n. inadvertent checkin of temporary file?\n. yeah this is much nicer. shouldn't we name the file something else though?  It's not a .java file at this point.\n. is there a performance advantage to using addAll() instead of add()?\n. Please update the comment and remove the class\n. A map of maps is generally slower than a single map because it requires an extra lookup.  I was asking if there's a noticeable performance impact.\n. this comment is indented improperly\n. I don't know what the right solution is, but with my solution it worked properly out of the box and could be customized.  I would like to find a solution that works properly out of the box for most apps.\n. dagger is an annotation processor and a runtime library, and it only has a single dependency with no compiler argument requirements, so I'm pretty sure it's possible\n. addAll is often more efficient than calling add many times individually.\nArrays.asList only creates a single lightweight object that wraps an array so I don't think that would be much of a problem.  http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/root/jdk/openjdk/6-b14/java/util/Arrays.java#Arrays.ArrayList\nBut that being said, I don't see an obvious performance advantage to using addAll for a plain unsynchronized HashSet http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/root/jdk/openjdk/6-b14/java/util/AbstractCollection.java#AbstractCollection.addAll%28java.util.Collection%29\n. You're right, my mistake\n. line 87 is indented 4 spaces deeper than line 88.  It looks like 87 and 88 should be at the same indentation level\n. This doesn't seem right.  maven should know about the dependencies, so the top-level pom should build guice before building roboguice.  We devs and build servers shouldn't have to do anything special to build\n. i'm confused about this README change\n. cool\n. why the new imports?\n. whitespace changes are making this file hard to review\n. why are we removing all of the dependency versions?\n. apps should not need to configure their compiler flags to use roboguice.  This is a blocker.\n. argh, so many unnecessary whitespace and import changes\n. seems like there's some overlap with this PR and the PR for 213\n. These changes seem unrelated to the change in RoboGuice.java?\n. Is there a reason not to use Ln?  We should use:\nLn.e(e, \"Unable to clear annotation database.\");\n. For Ln.i(\"display string: %s\", null) it seems like we would print out:\n\"display string: %s\"\nin the logs.  This seems confusing.  What I've seen other systems do is print out \"(null)\", eg:\ndisplay string: (null)\nThis seems like it would be more clear to the reader of the log.\n. oh i see the problem.  great\n. ",

Done : https://github.com/roboguice/roboguice/wiki/InjectView.\nThx.\n. We are experimenting this \"view factory technique\" on a large projects with many activities, fragments, nested fragments, compound views with nested compound views as well... It works well. We use it to provide custom font loading for each component and all of them are modified that way, whatever their depth is in the tree hierarchy.\nWe even modified the fragment loading mechanism, so this technique could also be used to inject stuff in fragments.\nNevertheless, I have thought about it and I got a problem with my pull request :S \nIt means that manually added views would not receive injections , and I wonder if it is not creating a larger problem by providing a somewhat heterogenous way to handle injection in views : automatic injection for XMLed layouts and manual injection for coded layouts.\nWhat do you think ?\n.

Ok, I could merge with master's current state. I am testing a bit on a new app, and PR again.\n\n@emmby I realized something was missing about view injections and fragments, I patched it.\nI will document and move classes as you wanted.\nS.\n. Such a feature is actually present in the 2 main event frameworks I know about :)\n- Otto with the Producers. Explained briefly here : http://stackoverflow.com/a/13293973/693752\n- And event bus with sticky events.\nI am not sure I am very happy with the actual implementation I submitted (actually I don't remember its details), but I think RoboGuice should really have a feature like this. \nLet's take a fragment, if you add to your activity, then if the activity fires an event, the fragment will get it.\nBUT, if you do it the otherway around : first firing an event and then add the fragment, then the fragment will have lost that event. This will lead to code deduplication : 1) code to listen to the event and 2) code to set the fragment \"manually\" in a given state, no related to events. They will do the same stuff, but in a very different way, and with fragments it will lead to a huge amount of complexity to save their state in the arguments.\nWith producers/sticky events, the fragment could have received the event, even if it was added after the event was fired.\nProducers offer a way to get an event lifecycle more independent from the Observer and Observable life cycles.\nOh, and last but not least : this pull request and feature enhancement has been motivated by a strong experience using RoboGuice  with fragments. In my most recent project we made a quite big app (for a bank, over 50 000 lines of code, 1000 classes) and it used a lot of fragments, and events to communicate with activities...\nI will not insist and I trust your experience but I would love to be convinced by arguments stronger than mine. ;)\n. @emmby could you see that this new pull request replaces the older one ?\n.

It looks like the file roboguice/src/main/java/roboguice/event/javaassist/RuntimeSupport.java is not used in RoboGuice at all. \nThe following commit will erase that file. Note that /roboguice/src/main/java/roboguice/event/eventListener/javaassist/RuntimeSupport.java has the appropriate licence header, that references both Apache Licence and LGPL.\n. This can be solved by using other libs : \n- IcePick for non active objects\n- memento for active objects\n. Duplicate from https://github.com/roboguice/roboguice/issues/26\n. @emmby I think this has been solved by global event manager of RG 3. Right ?\n.

This should not happen anymore as we use CopyOnWriteArraySet to maintain the set of listeners.\n. Released in RG 3.0.\n. It looks like this issue is not so obvious.\n\nThere could be different options : \n1. Adding a fragment.event package for new events, but it would be hard to strongly type the events unless we provide 2 distinct sets of events, one for provided fragments and one for support fragments. Or we could loosely type them (using Object, which is bit odd).\n2. Or we could recycle all the events we already have for activities and context, and remove the reference to a context or an activity.\nI think option 1 is interesting, with 2 sets of events or a single non typed event set.\nWhat do you prefer @emmby  ?\n. We can rebase this old PR, it does exactly that : https://github.com/roboguice/roboguice/issues/71\nDirect source code access : https://code.google.com/r/cherrydev-fragmentevents/source/detail?r=0f2a5b03bde9818dd0afa28afb2d930e72924962\n.

This could be closed so.\n. @emmby Do you want me to Update to Guice 4.0 beta or wait a bit till its officially released ?\n. We are upgrading to Guice 4.\n. Alternative here : https://speakerdeck.com/stephanenicolas/byte-code-weaving-for-android\n. This is part of our current effort on RG 4. @Macarse I invite you to have a look at \nhttps://github.com/mg6maciej/hrisey\n.

PR for fragment scope here. https://github.com/roboguice/roboguice/pull/204\n. That's gonna be a lot of job, it's all what RoboSpice is about...\n. On RS, we have our javadocs published on github-pages : \nhttp://stephanenicolas.github.io/robospice/site/latest/apidocs/index.html\nWe publish them for each release. Would that be the solution you are looking for here ?\n. I got that on RS.\nI take the issue so.\nLe 18 juin 2014 17:07, \"Mike Burton\" notifications@github.com a \u00e9crit :\n\nYeah. two considerations:\n1. it would be nice to tie it in automatically to the mvn release process\n2. it would be nice (but not necessary) to be able to archive javadocs for\nold versions somewhere on the web as well\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/roboguice/roboguice/issues/133#issuecomment-46448191.\n. @emmby \n\nI achieved the following and would like to confirm that it's OK with you : \n- we can generate the javadocs and upload them via (in root folder) : mvn site -pl roboguice\n- the javadocs will be accessible on the github pages site - btw this page works.\nAs you can see the docs will be generated per version, including snapshots. I am not sure yet how things will go when releasing. I believe that a mvn release:perform command would not generate the site and publish it, so we would have to checkout the \"prepare release\" commit, publish the docs and move back to the HEAD.\nAlso, it would be nice if we changed the page http://roboguice.github.io/roboguice/ to list all versions of docs available. But this has to be changed manually after deploying a new version of the docs. Using this option, we could provide a link to the latest docs, but it has to be done manually, and we could keep the docs of previous versions online. I can't find a way to automate this. This can be documented for contributors and be included in some \"Release procedure\" document.\nThe alternative, to avoid any manual work, is to always publish on the same url : http://roboguice.github.io/roboguice/site/latest/roboguice/apidocs/index.html -this page doesn't exist yet- but we would then only have the latest version of the docs, and wouldn't keep any archive of the old versions. Each new version would just erase the previous one. This can be fully automated.\nWDYT ?\nPersonally, I would go for the \"latest\" docs online only. The system is simpler, fully automated and we can release the javadocs + sources on maven in our release cycle already, for each version.\n\nBtw, the system I suggest relies on the github pages, that is to say, everything is commited on the special gh-pages branch of the repo. We then have full control on it (beware not to checkout that branch in the same folder where source is checked out, it usually messes everything, prefer a new folder to clone the repo and checkout the gh-pages branch).\n. I pushed my current work (on a branch) just to save it somewhere. \n. The try/catch approach seems a bit awfull as we indeed use exceptions to catch a NullPointerException. This wouldn't pass any checkstyle for instance.. Isn't the flag approach better ? @inteloid  In which case did your method have to be executed without a call to setContentView ?\n. NPE wouldn't pass checkdtyle neither...\nLe 18 oct. 2013 17:19, \"Harut Martirosyan\" notifications@github.com a\n\u00e9crit :\n\nOf course, you can replace it with catch for NPE. Flag approach doesn't\nwork, because there can be cases (except setConyentView) where you need\nthat metod to be called.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/roboguice/roboguice/issues/134#issuecomment-26604126\n.\n. If we don't have any control over the condition of the exception being\nthrown, then yes it's the only solution, but it's not very satisfying.\nCatching an exception blindly is a well know bad smell in code.\n\nFor reference :\nhttp://students.cs.byu.edu/~cs340ta/fall2010/checkstyle-4.3/docs/config_coding.html#IllegalCatch\n2013/10/19 Harut Martirosyan notifications@github.com\n\nWell, honestly, even if you catch TheMostSpecificForThisCaseException,\nit's not a nice hack, it's just a workaround until newer support library is\nreleased. And actually the NPE is being thrown on support libraries side\nand it's not possible to prevent it, so we just HAVE TO catch it somewhere,\nright?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/roboguice/roboguice/issues/134#issuecomment-26638401\n.\n\n\nSt\u00e9phane NICOLAS,\nOCTO Technology\nD\u00e9veloppeur & Consultant Android / Java\n..........................................................\n50, Avenue des Champs-Elys\u00e9es\n75008 Paris\n+33 (0)6.26.32.34.09\nwww.octo.com - mobilite.octo.com\nblog.octo.com - www.usievents.com\n...........................................................\n.

My pleasure @emmby , if you remember, I still had this problem : views created by layout inflation (even in fragments, nested fragments, etc) will be handled. But not components created dynamically.\nWhat do you think of adding a few methods to create views via RoboGuice programmatically. The returned views will have been injected. Maybe a simpler approach would be to provide a method like \nRoboGuice.injectDependenciesIntoView( View view );\nThat's not much, but the API would be more complete.\n. I take this issue as well, as I initiated the lint integration with maven, it should not be long. \nI would like the build to break in case there is any error in lint. Agree ?\n.

Finally I didn't work on the profile to disable them yet, as it's really not that long to get all checks.\n.

I think you should reconsider this practice, IMHO it's really something to avoid (the only reason I got here is that if one empty catch makes you miss something important, you can spend hours - if not more - searching for the cause of the problem).\nTo adhere more to standards, it's now relatively easy : follow the findbugs suppress warnings annotation, follow the SuppressWarnings \"PMD\", and CHECKSTYLE: OFF statements. \nOnce you merge the branch, I would like to have a little talk about trying to get rid of all warnings in the project. Eclipse gives me still 57 warnings. I don't know how things look like in IntelliJ, but I would be much more comfortable to get all lights green before releasing.\n. It is really strange, it is part of the pom : \n<dependency>\n        <groupId>findbugs</groupId>\n        <artifactId>annotations</artifactId>\n        <version>${findbugs-annotations.version}</version>\n    </dependency>\n.

Hi @emmby, \n\nI dont know how of a way to be able to build from the child directory. I would love to say I am gonna try, but I don't think I will get time for this this week.\nBut if you could merge, I got another PR I would like to send about startup optimization : \nhttps://github.com/stephanenicolas/roboguice/commit/679b514a3bfdde0b1005f522568483711d3618a2\nIt is really experimental but I believe it's an interesting track, it takes less than half a second to startup my app on a nexus 4.\n. This solves the problem with a more elegant maven / checkstyle configuration solution. It may impact the your IDE deals with checkstyle rule exceptions (suppressions) and you may have to configure them within your IDE. See the file roboguice_checks_suppressions.xml in root dir.\n. This issue is closed. I am a bit sad that cpd and its maven plugin don't have better excluding mechanisms : \nhttp://stackoverflow.com/q/5767747/693752\nThere is no way we can dynamically exclude classes for code deduplication detection, and adding static suppressions would be a pain to maintain.\n.

That's what I measured, sorry not have been clear about that.\n\nActually, I think that might be an interesting approach (the GuiceInjectionMonitor indirection) to optimize Guice as well.\n. Tests added in last commit. Thanks for all the feedback, code is much cleaner.\n. The code is already in place. We should activate it for RG 3.1 and add docs for it.(docs have started already to talk about this.)\n. Last commit solves this issue. It's not super clear on GH.\n.

I wait for the new Guice 3 based version to be merged and will merge this feature. It has to be reworked (now the PR would just be to enable it, all code is there).\nBTW @emmby , should I create a ticket in G app to enable it in all views ? (That would make it easier to transition to RG 4... and if we don't enable it, views will get injected twice which will slow down the app)\n. Replaced by #250.\n. We can but I have the feeling that things are not bound in the same way at\nall.\nIt is possible to give a list of all injected types.

Hi @emmby ,\n\nyes, that's really nice. Quite a better approach, I didn't know about the bind hook in modules. :)\nI really like the binding stuff in RoboGuice. It looks like we have very good time improvements.\nI would like to submit a patch to : \n- redesign a bit the annotation database class\n- use javawriter from squareup to generate java code instead of strings\n- testing for the annotation processor (that can be tricky. Do you prefer to use TRUTH, I prefer something a bit more complex but more robust for testing annotation processors.)\n- enhance detection of support vs native fragments in generated database ( done on my local branch already)\n- see if more stuff could be avoided in DefaultRoboModule creation.\n\nAlso for testing, I need to merge into this future PR commits : \nf9e7441cd4e44136c8cae539eb1638a6b7718e93\n96414b28151e740f58e0b442ca96b1a0822122c8\nby cherry-picking them \nExcept if you want to merge PR #176 to master.\n\nAccording to me, this mechanism seems quite good. \nWhat do you think of documenting and realeasing it for RG 3.0 ?\nSt\u00e9phane\n. @emmby ok for strings instead of classes. You are right that would lead to class loading problems with support or older sdk version.\nAbout Guice, what do you mean more precisely. I already published a fork. What could make its benefits less abstract for Guice itself ?\n. @emmby, I am thinking about a new design for the annotation database. But before talking about it, something bugs me a little : in RoboGuice, line 94 : \njava\nGuice.setHierarchyTraversalFilterFactory(new HierarchyTraversalFilterFactory() {\n                    @Override\n                    public HierarchyTraversalFilter createHierarchyTraversalFilter() {\n                        return new HierarchyTraversalFilter() {\n                            @Override\n                            public boolean isWorthScanning(Class<?> c) {\n                                return c != null && injectionClasses.contains(c.getName());\n                            }\n                        };\n                    }\n                });\nThe filter is gonna discard the super classes above the classes found by the annotation processor. But they should be included. For an instance MyRoboActivity has to receive custom injections, but RoboActivity has to receive injections too.. I didn't check with a concrete example, but, as is, the event mechanism for instance should not work. (Strange enough has the events are used to inject layout and views and it works...)\nAlso, as new design, I am thinking of a few things : \n- separating the AnnotationDatabase static methods, putting them in an AnnotationDatabaseFinder class. This class should have nothing static to be easily mocked. \n- the annotation database class itself could just be an abstract class used to cast the dynamically generated annotation databases (it currently has 2 roles, I propose to split them).\n- I don't understand exactly the package name mechanism : will it always be the same packages passed to both getInjectedClasses(String[] packageNames) and getClasses(String[] packageNames) ?\n- The annotation finder could base its search on a meta data entry in the manifest to declare the annotation databases to use. In the same way as modules are found.\nOtherwise, do we agree on the use of JavaWriter ?\n. Ok, it gives me a few things to do already :)\nI will try to submit a new PR based on this branch soon. I will stick to\nyour idea, far better than mine. I really like that the annotation compiler\nboth finds the injectedClasses and the classesContainingInjectionPoints.\nBtw, that's a formal naming proposal :)\nTo solve the bugs you get in the Groupon app, it would be simple enough to\nmake a HierarchyFilter that would keep its state once it finds a class\nworth scanning. I believe almost everything was done this way in the\nDefaultHierarchyFilter I provided in my branch. I think it would be worth\nkeeping it for 2 reasons :\n- the default hierarchy filter could be used in case no annotation database\n  is used.\n- it could be the base class of your custom hierarchy filter, just passing\n  an argument to the constructor of a subclass to have preset list of classes\n  to consider.\nBut both the default and the custom filter need to stop when they get out\nof RoboGuice classes (when traversing inheritance tree).\nBut I don't see how we could get rid of intermediate classes, I don't even\nthink it would be worth it.\nFiltering out directly the un-injected classes could be interesting, but I\ndon't think that can be easy and for now I prefer to focus on what we have\nand make it work like a charm.\nWe get close to something really pretty.\nS.\n2014-03-20 16:35 GMT+01:00 emmby notifications@github.com:\n\nI agree about JavaWriter.\nHm, you're right about the hierarchy filter, that may explain why i'm\nseeing problems with the groupon app. It would be nice to not have to scan\nthe entire hierarchy since we should be able to compute the topmost class\nthat has annotations during annotations processing. It would also be nice\nto not have to scan intermediate classes that don't have annotations.\nI'm definitely open to fixing the AnnotationDatabase class, it was more a\nproof of concept than real production code.\nNaming convention wasn't clear. In the following example:\nclass Foo {\n@Inject Bar bar;\n}\ngetClasses will return Foo, and getInjectedClasses will return Bar. Names\nneed to be made more clear. getClasses is the list of classes that require\ninspection for injection points, while getInjectedClasses is the list of\nclasses that have bindings.\nAndroidManifest makes sense.\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/roboguice/roboguice/pull/183#issuecomment-38181859\n.\n. @emmby, that could be achieved by simply accepting classes up to RoboGuice\n(included) but no further up, as did the DefaultHierarchyFilter.\n\nSt\u00e9phane\n2014-03-21 1:18 GMT+01:00 emmby notifications@github.com:\n\nThe filtering out of intermediate classes is pretty valuable, because it\navoids having to scan every field, method, and constructor of that\nintermediate class.\nI think there's two things that we're doing essentially. The first is\nchecking whether we have to proceed higher up in the hierarchy to scan for\nadditional injection points. The second thing is checking whether we have\nto scan the class at our current location in the hierarchy.

I gained a few\ncycles still by putting in common the class loading mechanism.\n\nhttps://github.com/stephanenicolas/roboguice/tree/mburton/exp/annotationprocessing-nonsilver-plus-optional-binding\nIs it me or all our branches start to be a bit messy ;) ?\nCan I join RoboGuice repo, and for now, I would work only on topic\nbranches, not on master ?\nS.\n\n@emmby, that could be achieved by simply accepting classes up to RoboGuice\n(included) but no further up, as did the DefaultHierarchyFilter.\nSt\u00e9phane\n2014-03-21 1:18 GMT+01:00 emmby notifications@github.com:\nThe filtering out of intermediate classes is pretty valuable, because it\n\navoids having to scan every field, method, and constructor of that\nintermediate class.\nI think there's two things that we're doing essentially. The first is\nchecking whether we have to proceed higher up in the hierarchy to scan for\nadditional injection points. The second thing is checking whether we have\nto scan the class at our current location in the hierarchy. This second\nthing is the list of classesContainingInjectionPoints in our annotation\ndatabase. I'm not sure how to compute the first thing...\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/roboguice/roboguice/pull/183#issuecomment-38236337\n.\n. @emmby , wow I get a great performance improvement on the last commit of this branch. I replugged the filter on all type listeners and it works fine. The code is a bit messy to my mind (my code) but I got really great performance improvements. (Came down from 430 ms  to 270 ms).\n\n\nI also corrected the filter so that the Groupon app should work. Would you mind to give it a try ?\nAlso, I am really wondering about the default package mechanism to load annotation databases. I would prefer each library, or app, to define its annotation database in its own package (package here being the AndroidManifest package). I feel the root package convention is just gonna be a source of problems on the long term, but I didn't really dig into the annotation you added to customize this.\n. Let me know if I can push my commits on this branch.\n. @emmby \nI pushed a new update to my branch : https://github.com/stephanenicolas/roboguice/tree/mburton/exp/annotationprocessing-nonsilver-plus-optional-binding\nIt goes with an update version of my fork of Guice : \nhttps://github.com/stephanenicolas/google-guice\nAll together, I can now reach an average launch time below 250 ms. Sometimes going as low as 210 ms (we started at 850 ms the beginning of our optimization journey).\nI still got to use JavaWriter and add tests (all previous guice/roboguice tests pass). Btw, the use of a binary format for injection points was not possible in a clean way as Android doesn't have the same mechanism to find resource files as normal java (via classoloader and via assets), so I'll stick to generating the annotation database in pure java.\nEverything has been pretty optimized on that branch. I did a lot of tests to reach that level of speed and I think every thing works great. This version prunes a lot of things during app startup. All the information acquired during annotation processing is used intensively. Using RoboGuice gives me a very little overhead now (around 120 ms on a Nexus 4 with Dalvik), the new area to optimize, IMHO, is the view listener and view/fragment injectors...And a lot of things can be removed at that level, even more if we use an annotation processor to detect improper annotation usages instead of doing it at runtime.\nI would be glad if you find some time to tests this. I would appreciate some feedback and your opinion whether or not this has chances to be merged in next release.\n. @emmby I could hack a new version of the optimization startup according to your idea : \n- during pre-processing, note all fields that are used as injection points\n- during runtime, only perform injections on those fields \nThe gain is almost 0 and the code got much more complex to deal with. As far as I can see, there are only a few classes that \"injected in\" at runtime already thanks to our improved hierarchy filter. And those few classes don't have a tremendous amount of fields. More over, there a lot more maps, lists and set processing to achieve it and I believe all this balances the gain we can hope from this approach. I could still make it a bit better, but I really doubt it can change the game, but I am often wrong :)\nNamely, on my sample app, I got 4 @Inject, 6 @InjectView and 2 @InjectFragment injections. I then pass from ~30 fields to 10 being explored with our technique. No that much difference, and there is an overhead with all the data structures involved.\nAnd, I had to introduce a new module to get some data structures shared by annotation processor and roboguice core module...\nI will not publish it, but if you wanna talk about it, I keep that warm on a branch for you.\nS.\n. @emmby  Oooppss, we got a problem.\nThere are some cases where our filtering mechanism can discard classes that should be processed for injection points, here is a counter-example : \nLet's focus on the @Inject annotation, and say we got \njava\npublic class MyRoboActivity extends RoboActivity {\n//no injection at all\n//or, even more specific : no @Inject annotation used \n//(but others, like @InjectView, can be used)\n}\nThis means that MyRoboActivity will not be listed as \"having an @Inject annotated field\" by the annotation processor. But RoboActivity is actually marked as \"having an @Inject annotated field\". The filter would like to discard MyRoboActivity, but it should not as it should apply all injections that have been defined in its super class.\nWorkarounds : \n- we can, when filtering a class A, also consider its super classes. If a super class is marked as \"having an @Inject annotated field\", then A should be filtered in. This slows down the filtering process, an average of 20 ms on my side.\n- we could add a new annotation : @InjeritsInjection or slightly modify @Inject (from Guice) and allow a class to be annotated with this annotation. If so, the preprocessor will have to put it in the same categories as its super classes : as \"having an @Inject annotated field\". That's much faster at runtime (we save the 20 ms added above), but it means that this annotation should not be forgotten, checking if it is forgotten is the same algorithm than in first bullet point, moreover it means we would slightly drift away from JSR 330 specs.\nWhat do you prefer ? Any other idea ?\nI would personally favor the first option has it is more robust and complies with existing code and standards.\n. I opted for the first solution in the problem above.\nI committed a few more changes : \n- the annotation processor now keeps track of everything thing to limit scanning of classes : constructors, methods, and fields that are injection points\n- only those members are looped through when building injection points in Guice and RoboGuice\n- the annotation processor now uses apache velocity template which is far more easy to use than JavaWriter in our case.\nWith the latests commits in both my Guice fork and my RoboGuice branch, I got performances as good as 225 ms to startup a RoboGuice app. Memory consumption is far lower as well and garbage collected is not running as much as before. Performance improvements are close to 75%.\nI discovered a few things to do to get a better benchmarking (with less variation) : \n- don't allow background processes in device developer option (near bottom)\n- use SystemClock.currentThreadTimeMillis() instead of System.currentTimemillis() \n- disable animations in device developer option (3 times).\nWith this all I get much more constant benchmark. They average 185 ms to startup the app, +/- 15 ms variation. BTW, these times are on Dalvik, and, as reflection is now quite restricted, on ART it gives around 400 ms, our best time as well.\nTODO : \n- refactor modules to take an AnnotationDatabaseFinder in param (optional)\n- try to put all the annotation processing mechanism directly in Guice, and override in RoboGuice. I gues that is what you meant @emmby when you were talking about a complete solution.\n. @emmby \nI updated everything so that you can start reviewing the code. I am still hacking both Guice and RoboGuice and go something more and more advanced and stable now.\nI could backport most of the annotation database system (for module binding filtering and type listening filtering for both fields, constructors, and methods) directly into Guice's core. I almost finished and I am going to push it soon. \nThe idea is to have a complete solution to propose to Guice team.\nA few things that have changed : \n- The annotation processor of Guice is called Blender, in RoboGuice : RoboBlender.\n- annotation processing is now very subtitle to note classes that are injectable, map each annotation to the set of classes that use them, and why they use it : for a field, a constructor, a method, and which one.\n- filtering is based on the above information\n- binding filtering is also based on the above information\n- Guice can be passed a few package names to lookup for annotation databases\n- roboguice uses a metadata to know which package names to lookup for annotation databases\n- the annotation processor can now be passed an argument when generating an annotation database to put it in a given package (replace the @AnnotationDatabasePackage mechanism that I didn't like)\n- everything performs at full speed\nThere are 2 design questions that I need to solve : \n- the annotation processor in Guice is good for RoboGuice but too complex for Guice itself, I have to figure out how to have a simple annotation processor in Guice and extend it in RoboGuice\n- the annotation based filter actually creates code deduplication, I am thinking of considering it as a decorator for a default filter, but still need to think about it.\nI think the code review would be much easier with a single squashed commit. Do you want me to do that ?\n. Fragment scope is in PR : https://github.com/roboguice/roboguice/pull/204\nWe will need to report the fix of this issue into this pattern, after fragment scope gets merged. Can I invite you to submit a new PR based on this branch @dmitry-zaitsev ?\n. There is a pending PR (#204), maybe you could re-fix the issue you fixed already but using the new fragment scope feature. \nIf it's not clear enough, don't worry, we will soon find time to address it, once the PR is merged.\n.

Hi @emmby,\n\nall is there. The annotation processor, filtering mechanisms for both binding and type listening have been ported to RoboGuice and the operation is complete. \nI tried to take most of your comments into account. Only 2 things that I don't fully agree with : \n- final modifiers when not needed (i.e. for local variables)\n- keeping stuff protected instead of private. To my mind this is against both open/close principle and least privilege principle and make the code less robust as a subclass can break stuff that work in super class. So, I would keep this practice the exception rather than the rule.\nEverything should be more elegant than ever, fully integrated and functional, with all optimizations in.\nDo you want me to squash all the commits starting from master into a single commit to ease reviewing it ?\nS.\n. You should join : https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/google-guice-dev/join. \nI would like to ask for feedback about blender and all our work on Guice.\n.

I close the thread with the hope of complete obsolescence of Ant on Android ;)\n. A cleaner PR for https://github.com/roboguice/roboguice/pull/206\n\nSee #206 for details. \nThis PR has automatic injection into views inflated from XML turned off.\n. +1. Btw, it reminds me of fragments scope PR.. ;)\n. Done in #214 \n. This should not fail. It's not related to PR\n. Implemented in Module.superbind()in RG 3\n. The problem is that you are defining a binding with an interface that contains some code that doesn't exist on a given platform. If android can deal with it when using the class directly, guice needs to create a binding representation of the interface and, for this it will load the interface into memory and will fail with the annotation that doesn't exist.\nThe same would happen if your interface contained reference to types that don't exist prior to a given SDK level. \nThis issue is quite interesting from a guice development point of view. It shows some limitations on Android.\nA workaround would be to have 2 interfaces : \n- one without the annotation\n- one with the annotation extending the first one.\nthen, \n- in your module, use the right interface according to SDK level to create a binding. \n- in your code, use the second one. \nI think that should trick guice and still keep android happy.\n. In this case, if you go to : \nhttp://www.findjar.com/index.x?query=Nullable+limit%3Anone\nYou see that findbugs defines this annotation (ok, you have to know you want the findbugs one, I agree).\nSo add the dependency to findbugs. Search it on central : \nhttp://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22findbugs%22%20AND%20a%3A%22annotations%22\nAdd it to your project \ngroovy\ncompile 'findbugs:annotations:1.0.0'\nAnd annotate your field with it : \njava\n@InjectFragment(R.id.fragmentContainer) \n@Nullable\nprivate CrimeFragment fragment;\nYour IDE should resolve the import.\n. Please note that there is also an annotation in android.support.annotation.Nullable, it's much simpler :)\n. Both @InjectView and @InjectFragment work in the same way : if the thing\ninjected is null, then the field has to be annotated with @Nullable\notherwise, an exception is thrown.\nNow the question may be : why is my fragment null during onCreate ?\nDo you add the fragment via XML ? Do you create it by hand ? Are you sure\nthe fragment should be there during onCreate of the activity ?\nSt\u00e9phane\n2014-09-01 10:37 GMT-04:00 zhanyz notifications@github.com:\n\nI add the annotations-1.0.0.jar to /libs, and add @Nullable\nhttps://github.com/Nullable after @InjectFragment(R.id.fragment).

It makes a lot of sense. The only way to get a fragment immediatly non null\nafter injection (that occurs in onCreate) is to use fragments inflated from\nXML. So, yes, if you add it by code,  there is no way it can be non null\nafter injection for the first time onCreate is called.\n\nSt\u00e9phane\n2014-09-02 10:08 GMT-04:00 zhanyz notifications@github.com:\n\nThank you!

There must be something wrong in your path to libs files. But, if you use gradle, why don't you use the dependencies of maven central, a simple statement for roboguice : \n\ngroovy\ncompile 'org.roboguice:roboguice:2.0'\nwould be enough to trigger all dependencies needed by roboguice transitively. \nUsing local jar files is usually deserved to using custom artifacts, in case of a fork for instance, but if you use the general artifacts available globally on maven central, you should use that instead.\nIssue is closed. Re-open if needed.\n. I have absolutely no idea of what happens. Your code is correct and should work.\nAny idea @emmby ?\n. Hi, @pikaboo ,\nyour code is right and should work. Nevertheless, I got an idea about something that may happen.\nWhich Nullable annotation did you use, which package does it belong to and what's its retention policy ?\nIf you don't have all answers, at least provide the FQN name of the annotation you use, and the artifact's Id and groupId and version where this annotation comes from.\nWe usually use this : \nhttp://findbugs.sourceforge.net/api/edu/umd/cs/findbugs/annotations/Nullable.html\nfrom \ngroovy\ncompile 'findbugs:annotations:1.0.0'\nBut multiple jars use this annotation, and I guess some of them would define an annotation with other retention policies and it would lead to the annotation being scrapped off runtime classes, thus the annotation would appear to be missing during introspection.\nThanks for your perseverance. \n.

If so, does it work with dalvik (if you can\nswitch to it) ?\n2014-09-18 17:41 GMT-04:00 Mike Burton notifications@github.com:\n\nHm, hard to figure out with the obfuscation.

There is something wrong in this reasoning david.\n\nObfuscation takes place during the build. So either you build a special\nversion for L with bad obfuscation settings or you use a bad obfuscation\nsetting for all versions and then it should always fail for all versions of\nAndroid.\nThis bug, as we understand it, can't appear at runtime for a single android\nversion, it's not possible.\n2014-09-18 18:52 GMT-04:00 oudavid notifications@github.com:\n\nThanks for the help guys. I am 99% sure the issue is with Dexguard and its\nobfuscation.

What is wrong with this wiki page ?\nhttps://code.google.com/p/roboguice/wiki/RoboAsyncTask\n\nWould you like it to be part of our new GH wiki ?\n. Oh, you are right, the KeywordSearchTask should call a constructor of its parent explicitely : \njava\npublic KeywordSearchTask(Context context, String searchterm) { \n    super(context);\n    this.searchterm = searchterm; \n}\nThis constructor is : \njava\n protected RoboAsyncTask(Context context) {\n        this.context = context;\n        RoboGuice.getInjector(context).injectMembers(this);\n    }\nas you can see, it injects all fields in the async task (in the scope of the Context passed as parameter).\nAnd finally, KeywordSearchTask returns a String as it extends RoboAsyncTask<String> (which obliges call to return a String).\n. Sorry @Alexwijn I updated my previous comment.\n. See my comment above @Alexwijn .\n. Hi Alex,\nyou should not do it that way. You should call execute on the async task,\nand update the UI with the result of call (that will be called\nautomatically on a different thread by execute) from the onSuccess method\nof your AsyncTask.\n2014-10-13 13:49 GMT-04:00 Alex Wijnholds notifications@github.com:\n\nAnd how to run this ASyncTask?

In RoboGuice, by default everything that is injected has to be non null after injection.\n\nThe error you get means that after XML inflation, your view is null. This can happen under 2 circumstances : \n- this view is not referenced in your XML layout and you made a mistake\n- this view is not referenced in ALL XML layout configurations, for instance it can be present in landscape and not in portrait. \nIn the second case, you would like to add a @Nullable annotation to this field. The Nullable annotation can come from any class/package you want (there are so many libs providing this annotation..). The only constraint is that the annotation has to be named Nullable.\nA field annotated with the Nullable annotation can be null after injection without creating any error.\nPlease note that we kept this question in issues as a FAQ for other devs, but usually, you should have used the discussion group to ask a question, not GH issue pages.\n. Hi @Alexwijn , I don't think there is a work around for this problem with current state of RG. \nAnd we are at other things and developing the lib in other areas.\nBut, RG is open source, and it looks like you follow its development. Do you wanna contribute a RoboPreferenceFragment ?\nWe won't have time before a couple of months to tackle that..\n. @dryganets Cool for Roboblender. :)\nCan you please ping me via google plus. We wanna get in touch with you guys from Skype about RG 3, 3.1 and RG 4... \n. @emmby Ready for review\n. Duplicate of https://github.com/roboguice/roboguice/issues/134\n. @longscoop and @xyqjay don't use GH issue pages as a chat. You can just watch an issue to get notified of changes.\n. Try the latest alpha 6 release. And report any update on the bug. Re-open if needed.\n. Which build system do you use ?\nRoboBlender generates the file AnnotationDatabaseImpl. Read the RoboBlender wiki to use it properly. We support people using gradle and can maybe help with maven.\n. Hello Florian,\nthank you very much for including RoboGuice in the top 10 libraries for Android in your book.\nIt's a real pleasure.\nI am really curious about the 9 others you chose by the way ;)\nS.\n. Roboguice is deprecated. For a list of alternatives, please visit \nhttps://github.com/stephanenicolas/toothpick#alternative-dependency-injection-di-engines-for-android.

Which build system do you use ?\nDo you pass any option to roboblender ?\n. We released version 3.0 of RG. \nhttp://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Corg.roboguice%7Croboguice%7C3.0%7Cjar\n. Using RG 3.0. Can you locate the java file AnnotationDatabaseImpl.java ?\nThen have a look at its package statement (top of the file), and see if\ngets compiled, and embedded in the apk (using dexdump).\nRG 3.0 works well for us, so it should work for you. BTW, we released\nversion 3.0.1 today. But it should not impact this at all.\nS.\n2014-11-10 19:12 GMT-05:00 Lance Nanek notifications@github.com:\n\nGetting the same problem with:\ncompile 'org.roboguice:roboguice:3.0'\nDowngrading to this works as above:\ncompile 'org.roboguice:roboguice:3.0-alpha-2'\nGuess 3.0 is a faulty release.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/roboguice/roboguice/issues/246#issuecomment-62480557.\n. @lance nanek, the file is generated by RoboBlender at compile time... It's\nnot packaged in a jar.\n\nDid you have a look at the RoboBlender wiki ?\n2014-11-11 12:55 GMT-05:00 Lance Nanek notifications@github.com:\n\nConfirmed same problem with 3.0.1 release. Why would there be a Java file\nfor a gradle dependency? The most it would ever do is pull down\nroboguice-3.0.jar from Maven with would contain class files. Such a Java\nfile would never exist.\nIgnoring that, looking in the pulled down jar file, there definitely isn't\nany AnnotationDatabaseImpl in the default package like the code is trying\nto load anyway. There is one in the roboguice package, but that isn't what\nthe Roboguice code is trying to load.\nI did manage to get 3.0.1 working by putting this static block in my\nApplication subclass:\nstatic {\nRoboGuice.setUseAnnotationDatabases(false);\n}\nSo the annotation database code seems to be buggy and tries to load\nclasses that don't exist in the default package.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/roboguice/roboguice/issues/246#issuecomment-62587766.\n. Lance, you are right. RoboBlender is purely optional, but if you don't use\nit, you have to tell so to RG.\n\nDid you see @Alec Holmes comment ?\n2014-11-11 13:10 GMT-05:00 Lance Nanek notifications@github.com:\n\nNever heard of RoboBlender, but Google searching for the wiki and looking\nat it, it seems wrong right at the start:\nRoboBlender is purely optional. If you don't set it up, RG will work, but\nyou won't benefit from RG latest improvements.\nBecause as documented here, apps just crash if they don't set it up.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/roboguice/roboguice/issues/246#issuecomment-62590340.\n. The problem is not solved because we don't think there is any problem.\n\nThe main thing with this issue is that for now, we didn't receive enough\ninformation from people using eclipse. \n(message updated, the end of the message didn't belong to that thread, sorry)\n. Thx for the suggestion. We will do it for next release. You error message is better, though I will add more to it to avoid frustrating devs who use RoboBlender but something went wrong (in case this happens).\n. Hi @Christian,\ncan you pass us the exact line you added ? And @agb46, can you confirm it\nworked for you, we would like to add a FAQ entry about this.\nSt\u00e9phane\n2014-12-06 10:50 GMT-05:00 Christian Langer notifications@github.com:\n\nI worked around this issue by adding -keep public class\nAnnotationDatabaseImpl to my proguard config.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/roboguice/roboguice/issues/246#issuecomment-65902795.\n. Great you could solve it. It is gonna be increasingly harder for us to support Eclipse, as there are less and less developers using it. We don't anymore, personally. \n. See the maintainers instructions to build RG from sources : \nhttps://github.com/roboguice/roboguice/wiki/MaintainerInstructions\n\nYou basically have to run mvn clean install -P 'guice' \n. Did you check the RoboBlender wiki ? We also have in depth slides on speakerdeck (mentionned in the wiki).\nTo sum up. Guice does as much things as before, except that we have already found injection point locations at compile time, and feed them to guice at Runtime.\n. I close this thread. Re-open if needed.\n. Ready for review.\n. Hello St\u00e9phan,\nthanks for this question. We currently didn't experiment yet with multi dex and what we have read so far shows us that is a hard track. We also heard rumours that Android is gonna include soon a new minifyer that will shrink jars before they are dexed.\nAnyhow, there are very few chances that you bypassed the dex limit due to RoboGuice itself. Chances are that your problem comes from a different lib (google play services ?). \nOur current workaround is to use proguard in our apps. And though it adds more build time, this solution is perfectly fine and RG 2 & 3 support proguard very well. Please refer to the wiki for proguard instructions.\nRe-open the issue if needed, but it's quite unlikely that we had multidex support as we strongly believe  the solution to the dex limit must be tackled at the android build tools level and we think that Google is going to address this soon.\n. The fix for Blender is available on the snicolas-mburton-blender branch of https://github.com/stephanenicolas/google-guice\nNote : don't forget that we develop our patch on this branch, but we then merge it with current guice master regularly in snicolas-mburton-blender-after-merge branch. And it's this last branch that we put as a git subtree in RG.\n. I am saying to myself that binding an implementation + assigning it via requestStaticInject is 2 lines\nwhereas Ln.setImpl( new LnGrouponImpl()); is one line\nand no reflection, and no static injections in clients app ;) \nShould help to solve all the problems with making Ln standalone.\n@emmby  says it sounds reasonable.\n. Hi @devilmac ,\nthe L is really strange. It is an array... \nCan you post your manifest ? Do you use the default package for the annotation database ? Did you read the RoboBlender wiki ? And finally, does it work with a lower SDK ?\n. Hi @fridolin69 and @devilmac ,\n@fridolin69 I don't think the problem is related to the L as stated in Mike's SOF answer.\nwe didn't face that bug yet. So, we would need some help from you to understand what happens : \n- do you use RoboBlender ?\n- what is your build system ? gradle or maven ?\n- after compiling the project (or trying to), can you look if the file AnnotationDatabaseImpl.java is generated by RoboBlender ?\n- where is it located ?\n- does it contain code ? What is its package statement (at the top) ?\n- is this file compiled ? \n- is this file's class file embedded inside the apk ?\n- Do you use proguard ?\n- ultimately which version of java do you use ?\n. This thread is marked as invalid as long as we don't get additional information. Please, be sure that we wish to help, but we need your help to provide assistance on this.\n. Hi Simon dimitriadis,\nyou should definitely read the RoboBlender wiki we have published in the\nwiki pages of the GH repo.\nRoboGuice 3 now uses an optional annotation processor that creates an\nannotation database that can speed up your app.\nOne AnnotationDatabaseImpl is generated per lib/app. The annotation\ndatabase you mention is the one from RG itself, there should also be one\nfor your own application.\nPlease issue the following command in a terminal in your project's folder :\nfind . | grep -i AnnotationDatabaseImpl\nReport the result of this command here.\nYou should also consider upgrading to latest JDK 8 (update 25) as issues\nhave been reported with earlier versions.\nPlease, let us know how you added RoboGuice and RoboBlender to your gradle\nfile.\nA quick workaround is to disable RoboBlender as explained in the wiki, but\nto be honest that would be a shame not to take advantage of it.\nThx for the follow-up,\n St\u00e9phane\n2014-11-11 9:46 GMT-05:00 simon dimitriadis notifications@github.com:\n\nWell I don't use Roboblender I don't even know what it's good for I just\nread in the wiki how to setup the project with gradle and it states to\ninclude both and the jsr305 is optional.\nI have an existing project where I wanted to upgrade from Roboguice2 to 3\nbecause I would like to implement the new views/toolbar.

No, something is wrong in your setup.

Hi @sdoward,\n\nno, nothing changed at that level. And for the apps I know of, events work\nvery well. All our tests pass (I know that because I am working on adding\nfragment events).\nAre you sure nothing else changed ? A common cause of problems is\nobfuscation with events.

After half a day of disassembling and diffing\nfiles (with a correct build from JDK 1.7), it seems that some JDK version\nhave a problem to correctly generate the AnnotationDatabaseImpl file. In\nthe broken version the fillAnnotationClassesAndMethods() methods is\ncompletely empty (and some other stuff is missing too) which leads to\nevents not working at all.\nI updated my JDK form 1.8.0_05 to 1.8.0_45 and it started working. So for\nthe case anyone is still stumble across this (as I did), update your JDK to\nthe most recent versions and things seem to be fine.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/roboguice/roboguice/issues/260#issuecomment-101280112\n.\n. Hi @falc0r,\n\nthank you very much for this very precise bug report. Would you like to\nsend us a PR ?\nThis is definitely gonna be a case for a 3.0.1 release fix !\nSt\u00e9phane\n2014-11-07 15:58 GMT-05:00 falc0r notifications@github.com:\n\nI've run into a few issues with constructor injection when disabling\nannotation databases. Member injection runs through the\nInjectionPoint.getInjectionPoints methods, which resets the\nRoboGuiceHierarchyTraversalFilter on each call. Constructor injection runs\nthrough the InjectionPoint.forConstructorOf method which doesn't reset the\nfilter but instead uses it's previous state. When I have classes that\nrequire construction injection I find that the\nRoboGuiceHierarchyTraversalFilter thinks that it is in a RoboGuice package\nand determines that it isn't worth scanning for injectable constructors,\nresulting in an erroneous \"Could not find a suitable constructor\" type\nGuice configuration error. I've found that switching to member injection is\na potential workaround, but I'd prefer to use immutable classes where\npossible.\nHere's a link\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/jnnv38g8p8d4285/RG3Test_bug.zip?dl=0 to a\nsimple (~5 class) project that breaks when the Injector is created.\nAnd here's another\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/jnnv38g8p8d4285/RG3Test_bug.zip?dl=0 slightly\nmodified version of the above that shows it working with member injection.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/roboguice/roboguice/issues/261.\n. We have found a bug fix. It's a one-liner in our guice fork, the filter reset was simply missing for constructors as you said.\n\nI will do my best to reach @emmby (who's very busy) so that we release a 3.0.1 asap.\nSuper thanx for the very detailled bug report and for the example, it really helped a lot !\n. @emmby just released 3.0.1. This release should solve your problem. Thx to @mgrzechocinski & @falc0r for this very very good bug report. \nPlease tell if this release solves your problem. It definitely should work as expected.\n. :+1: cool\n. Thank you very much @falc0r for this (again !) super detailed bug report. \nActually AssistedInjections are quite costly in Guice, as far I could read, and we generally don't use them in RG because they are too slow, like TypeLiterals. But, you are right, this should work as well.\nDo you mind if we investigate this bug and patch RG and blender for this issue only in 3.1.0 ?\nI am gonna milestone this ticket for 3.1.0, let us know if you really need something more urgent. If meanwhile you had time to investigate a PR, that would be awesome.\nBut thanks again, your issue is really crystal clear. \n. Thx Craig. We will keep you updated when RG 3.1.0 is out.\nS.\n2014-11-11 10:53 GMT-05:00 Craig McIlwee notifications@github.com:\n\nHey Stephane, I don't have any problem with this being pushed back, as\nmentioned above I was able to create an annotation database that solved the\nproblem. I don't think the fix will be too difficult though so I'm playing\nwith it now in my fork.\nI didn't realize that type literals and assisted injection would introduce\nperformance problems. I'm using type literals now but my project isn't that\nlarge (so probably only about 10 - 20) and haven't noticed any issues. It\nis something good to keep in mind going forward though.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/roboguice/roboguice/issues/266#issuecomment-62566987.\n. Duplicate of https://github.com/roboguice/roboguice/issues/259. Please follow this thread.\n. Thx for this bug report. The fix is planned for 3.1. Meanwhile, you should either not inject this field or disable RoboBlender. \n\nSorry for this. Btw, we would be glad to accept a PR to fix this.\nS.\n. Thx @falc0r , we will review this shortly. This is planned for next release : 3.1.0\n. Solves https://github.com/roboguice/roboguice/issues/266\n. Hi @hob90 ,\nlet's start with the module question. You can still define RG modules but the only 2 things that changed are : \n- module constructors should now have an application parameter (it used to be a context)\n- modules are declared in the AndroidManifest metadata, not into a separate xml as with RG 2\nBut I think you got all that already as you read the migration guide.\nAbout the first problem you have, that is really strange. It looks like your activity class is not embedded into the apk. \nCan you please confirm that you don't use multidex ?\nAlso, can you dexdump the apk and grep class descriptors to see if the activity class is there ?\nAnd please, double or triple check your AndroidManifest and the activity name.\nAlso, there might be something wrong in classloading prior to this error. Clear you logcat ,relaunch the app and check all log levels, especially warnings. Dalvik reports unloadable classes at this level (as it may not be an error but a lazily loaded class that should not be loaded due to fragmentation).\nAnd, use mvn -X to get sure to see all bad things that can happen during the build.\nFinally, did you try disabling RoboBlender to see if the error is related to it ?\nAnd I wanna see your pom too ;)\n. Hi @hob90 ,\nwith ecipse, you will need to setup the roboblender annotation processor in a special way. Eclipse support for annotation processing is not as easy as with Android Studio. You will have to do a google search to set it up. We can help but if you could look at it on your side, it would help us to help you.\nYou right, let's get the maven build working first. What version fo maven do you use ?\nAlso, disable proguard explicitely in your android maven plugin configuration to get sure this doesn't blur the build with something you don't control fully.\nAnd we need details about what is going wrong with maven when installing the build. Did you try to uninstall the app first ?\n. The problem is not solved because we don't think there is any problem. \nThe main thing with this issue is that for now, we didn't receive enough information from people using eclipse. We currently don't use eclipse as most of the Android community migrated to Android Studio. We don't support ant neither as most of the community moved to Gradle. If people want to use eclipse/ant, it would be nice if they could report the problem here correctly, with details and answering all the questions we ask.\nMaybe for all developers that don't fully master their build processes, we should recommend to disable RoboBlender optimizations as it requires some knowledge of how your IDE and build system works. Please refer to the RoboBlender wiki to see how to disable RoboBlender.\n. Can you :\n- clear logcat\n- launch the app\n- check warning logs, (orange color in Android Studio) and report any\n  problem with loaded classes issued by Dalvik.\nAlso, please note that we strongly consider now that minimum sdk for most\ndevices is level 10, not sure we will put a lot of efforts in supporting\nlower android sdks.\n2014-11-16 18:17 GMT-08:00 Dan notifications@github.com:\n\nHi all,\nWhen I run an app with Roboguice and Roboblender 3.0.1 on a device or\nemulator with API level 7 or 8 I get this error (I don't know if this\nhappens in lower levels):\njava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org.roboguice.shaded.goole.common.collect.ImmutableSortedSet\n            at org.roboguice.shaded.goole.common.collect.ImmutableSet.copyOf(ImmutableSet.java:364)\n            at com.google.inject.internal.ProviderInstanceBindingImpl.(ProviderInstanceBindingImpl.java:52)\n            at com.google.inject.internal.ProviderInstanceBindingImpl.withScoping(ProviderInstanceBindingImpl.java:85)\n            at com.google.inject.internal.AbstractBindingBuilder.in(AbstractBindingBuilder.java:91)\n            at roboguice.config.DefaultRoboModule.configure(DefaultRoboModule.java:156)\n            at com.google.inject.AbstractModule.configure(AbstractModule.java:78)\n            at com.google.inject.spi.Elements$RecordingBinder.install(Elements.java:252)\n            at com.google.inject.spi.Elements.getElements(Elements.java:107)\n            at com.google.inject.internal.InjectorShell$Builder.build(InjectorShell.java:135)\n            at com.google.inject.internal.InternalInjectorCreator.build(InternalInjectorCreator.java:104)\n            at com.google.inject.Guice.createInjector(Guice.java:100)\n            at com.google.inject.Guice.createInjector(Guice.java:87)\n            at roboguice.RoboGuice.createGuiceInjector(RoboGuice.java:186)\n            at roboguice.RoboGuice.getOrCreateBaseApplicationInjector(RoboGuice.java:151)\n            at roboguice.RoboGuice.getOrCreateBaseApplicationInjector(RoboGuice.java:90)\n            at roboguice.RoboGuice.getInjector(RoboGuice.java:197)\n            at roboguice.activity.RoboActionBarActivity.onCreate(RoboActionBarActivity.java:85)\n            at com.robotest.MainActivity.onCreate(MainActivity.java:22)\n            at android.app.Instrumentation.callActivityOnCreate(Instrumentation.java:1047)\n            at android.app.ActivityThread.performLaunchActivity(ActivityThread.java:2466)\n            at android.app.ActivityThread.handleLaunchActivity(ActivityThread.java:2519)\n            at android.app.ActivityThread.access$2200(ActivityThread.java:123)\n            at android.app.ActivityThread$H.handleMessage(ActivityThread.java:1870)\n            at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:99)\n            at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:123)\n            at android.app.ActivityThread.main(ActivityThread.java:4370)\n            at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNative(Native Method)\n            at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:521)\n            at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run(ZygoteInit.java:868)\n            at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java:626)\n            at dalvik.system.NativeStart.main(Native Method)\nThis error doesn't happen in higher levels.\nThe code I used to test this is very simple, no custom views, proguard, or\nwhatever:\n@ContentView(R.layout.activity_main)public class MainActivity extends RoboActionBarActivity {\n```\n@InjectView(R.id.textView) private TextView textView;\n@InjectView(R.id.button) private Button button;\n@Override\nprotected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    textView.setText(\"A TextView\");\n    button.setText(\"A Button\");\n}\n```\n}\napply plugin: 'com.android.application'\nandroid {\n    compileSdkVersion 21\n    buildToolsVersion \"21.1.1\"\ndefaultConfig {\n    applicationId \"com.robotest\"\n    minSdkVersion 7\n    targetSdkVersion 21\n    versionCode 1\n    versionName \"1.0\"\n}\ncompileOptions {\n    sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_7\n    targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_7\n}\nbuildTypes {\n    release {\n        runProguard false\n        proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'\n    }\n}\n}\ndependencies {\n    compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])\n    compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:21.0.0'\n    compile 'org.roboguice:roboguice:3.0.1'\n    provided 'org.roboguice:roboblender:3.0.1'\n}\nNote: I'm using Android Studio 0.8.14\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/roboguice/roboguice/issues/272.\n.

There is no way to achieve this with RoboGuice currently. We might work on this feature but not now for sure, and using the injects projects. If you want to fill an issue there : https://github.com/stephanenicolas/injects\n. Hi @victoriazheng ,\n\n\na few things : \nI strongly advise you don't use '+' in your dependencies on Gradle. This looks like a nice feature, but as an app developer you should always be in full control of your dependencies. We do our best to test our release and I guess all libs do, but it would be very bad if, without modifying your code you get a new bug because a dependency introduced it.\nDid you read our RoboBlender wiki ? It may be a bit long, but I got the feeling that it would solve the problem you have.\nHere are a few things we need to fix your bug : \n- is com.some.CustomModule a java class ? It may sound a bit silly as a question, but it's not clear to me what you call a \"module file\". Except that, all seems fine for the setup. \n- I guess your app doesn't use any lib that uses Guice / RoboGuice, otherwise you should mention a package to generate the annotation database into (see RoboBlender wiki).\n- how do you use your SharedPreferencesHelper class ? I mean do you somewhere use @Inject SharedPreferencesHelper helper or you just inject it manually without annotations (using RoboGuice.getInjector(..).getInstance(...)) only? In the latter case, you need to tell so to RoboBlender (see wiki) and you will have to superBind the class in your custom module.\nI am pretty sure you are close to get RG 3 working.\n. Closed as not followed up.\n. Thx. Done. \n. Sure we have a good reason. We actually use a fork of Guice.\nSt\u00e9phane\n2014-12-08 8:59 GMT-05:00 Tom Golden notifications@github.com:\n\nUnless there's a good reason to bundle Guice and the javax.inject libs,\nconsider declaring normal transitive dependencies on those artifacts, so\nthat users can override or exclude according to their own needs.

There are different issues in your sample : \n- you should use the AndroidManifest's mechanism to declare your module. Refer to the instructions here : https://github.com/roboguice/roboguice/wiki/Your-First-Custom-Binding\n- no need of the @Inject annotation for the constructor of a module, it is not created by injections.\n- in your application, your say hello world doesn't make much sense : you could use this as first parameter. Why do you want to call getApplicationContext() here, the stack trace is not related with an injetion problem, the call simply fails.\n- in your sample, there is no case for injection. It's not used.\n- I believe that the binding of an application class to a custom class already works out of the box.\n. Please refer to the wiki for instructions on how to setup proguard for RG. It is not a beginners setup, proguard is not easy and may requires additional reading (stack over flow, instruction manual, etc.).\n. The classes containing injection points and that will be injected need to be kept during obfuscation. Refer to wiki entry for proguard instructions using RG. If you need to re-open, provide more details.\n. The wiki is supposed be up to date. Can you give more details about the default file name you observe for shared preferences, to our knowledge, it is named default. Issue is marked as invalid until we got more details.\n. I agree that the wiki could be more clear for people not so familiar with Events in RG. \n\nTo use the global event manager, which means you want to communicate from a context to a different context, simply use : \njava\n//get the global event manager\n@Named(DefaultRoboModule.GLOBAL_EVENT_MANAGER_NAME) \n@Inject EventManager globalEventManager;\n....\n//somewhere in code\nglobalEventManager.fire(new MyAPIEvent());\nDo not register it in your module, this is already done in DefaultRoboModule. \nTo receive the events, \n``` java\n//get the global event manager\n@Named(DefaultRoboModule.GLOBAL_EVENT_MANAGER_NAME) \n@Inject EventManager globalEventManager;\n//define a listener \nEventListener listener = new EventListener() {\n            @Override\n            public void onEvent(UpdateEvent e) {\n        }\n    };\n\n//you should register a listener\nglobalEventManager.registerObserver(eventClass, listener );\n```\nYou will have to manage the registration and unregistration of the listener, RG doesn't handle it when you want to use a specific event manager. RG manages automatically registration and unregistration  for an event manager local to an activity, a service, etc. See wiki for more details.\nIf you find a way to improve the wiki, we would be happy about that.\n. Hi guys,\nRoboGuice will stop providing all exotic varieties and activities and\nfragments with RG 4.\nWe plan a lot of changes, making RG more focused and efficient, small, we\nwill drop a few non necessary features, and among them the support for\nevery single activity type. The reason for that is that Android becoming\nmore advanced, and the Android community with it, we don't feel that\nrepeating the same code in different classes adds a lot of value to RG. We\nthink it provides value to non advanced devs by making it easy to bootstrap\nan activity, but inheritance is a hard constraint and leads us to a lot of\ncode duplication in RG.\nPlease, add the class in the PR to your project, this will be the new way\nto do things a la RG soon.\n2015-09-02 23:43 GMT-04:00 Brad Barnhill notifications@github.com:\n\nThere is a pull request for this right now ... its been out there since\nJune 22.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/roboguice/roboguice/issues/298#issuecomment-137322464\n.\n.

It's the only way to make eclipse and maven work together with suppressions in checkstyle : \nI should have added this reference : http://rolf-engelhard.de/2011/04/using-the-same-suppression-filter-for-checkstyle-in-eclipse-and-maven/\n. You must build from inside the root directory of the project, not from roboguice folder. This way it should work. I don't know of any better way to do it, but there might be.\n. It's really up to you to decide what are the conventions in RoboGuice. Personally, in the projects I manage, we don't allow empty blocks. Of course, sometimes it may just look stupid to add a log, but to my mind, that's the minimal thing to do even about some error we don't really care of, as the price to pay for an unintended empty catch block is really very very high.\n. Ok.\n. Even with a setter ? \n. To follow any obfuscated RoboGuice class.\n. same answer ;)\n. Didn't see it do you have a link ?\n. Ok, but they had a static setter.\n. @emmby, No, that is not possible. With maven, annotation compilers have to be invoked this way as the scope of the compiler must be provided, not be included in the final apk, and the library itself must have a compile scope as usual. I believe gradle will have the same mechanism. I find the compiler parameter much more clear than the package annotation to give the name of the package to the annotation database.\n. If that means that the package of the generated database annotation is the default package by default, then I believe this will lead to more problems. Don't you ?\n. OK. TODO change this for a setter.\n. No, that's what the compiler argument is for.\n. What do you mean ?\n. Which map ? All the maps I use are there to decrease the computation cost of finding the injection point locations.\n. In the AnnotationDatabaseFinder.\n. OK . TODO : correct error handling in annotation compiler.\n. Starting with \"A\" is an annotation processor argument. See explanation above.\n. Other wise test break for now with Robolectric. At some point I introduced this, but I think it can be corrected. TODO : investigate this.\n. TODO : remove this file.\n. I just used that extension to get some syntax coloring, though completely broken for the compiler but helpful to write the template. I could use .vm extension which is the standard for velocitiy I believe. TODO\n. You don't have to create an additional intermediate collection for addAll. That's all the point of this class : not adding data structures that will be garbage collected as soon as the database merge will have happened.\n. There are indeed mulitple issues that led me to use a map of map : \n- a proper custom data structure would be the best here, something that gives the operations needed in fastest time. But to do this, as we need both the data structure in the RoboGuice runtime and RoboBlender (the annotation processor), this means that, to avoid a cycle in maven modules, we would need to introduce a new module (like Blender-lib) to the RoboGuice o Guice project, and I didn't dare doing it.\n- so I fell back on using language-provided data structures, hence this map of maps\n- hashmaps are supposed to provide lookup in 0(1) average, O(n) worst case with pathological data (that we don't have). A map of map is thus in O(1) average too.\n- to circumvent the low meaning-ness of a map of map, compared to having proper structure carrying it, I used quite verbose variable names for those maps. That's the best I could find.\nI tried to save on every possible CPU cycle, if a data structure was not needed, I didn't create it to help the garbage collector running less frequently and consuming less user sensitive time. A map of map seemed like a \"raw/low-level/fast\" data structure that could be justified in that specific case.\n. You mean ? I don't get it, sorry.\n. done. Strange, are we looking at the same code ?\n. done. You are right.\n. The annotation compiler parameter is now optional. The whole lib uses the default package by default. And this can still be customized. \nSo, to use Dagger, according to this page, you need : \nxml\n  <dependency>\n    <groupId>com.squareup.dagger</groupId>\n    <artifactId>dagger-compiler</artifactId>\n    <version>${dagger.version}</version>\n    <optional>true</optional>\n  </dependency>\n<dependencies>\n  <dependency>\n    <groupId>com.squareup.dagger</groupId>\n    <artifactId>dagger</artifactId>\n    <version>${dagger.version}</version>\n  </dependency>\n</dependencies>\nand to use our stuff, you need : \nxml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>org.roboguice</groupId>\n    <artifactId>roboblender</artifactId>\n    <version>${roboguice.version}</version>\n    <scope>provided</scope>\n</dependency>\n<dependency>\n    <groupid>org.roboguice</groupid>\n    <artifactid>roboguice</artifactid>\n    <version>${roboguice.version}</version>\n</dependency>\nI can't see the difference.BTW, provided and optional have the same effect on scope.\n. No trouble, and that's why I didn't dare introducing apache velocity in the annotation compiler. It triggers quite some dependencies, but there is no chance that will go in the final apk. Though we can bet that will be a top 5 FAQ entry ;)\n. This has definitely been updated on my repo and doesn't apply anymore. I even refactored to get a cleaner core loop.\n. nw, this doc is really mainstream ;)\n. the whole file should not be in tree. It is generated during build by shading plugin. \n. done. Btw, is there still a plan to separate logging API as a standalone lib ?\n. No, if args is null it will print\n\"display string: null\"\nsee the 2 tests I added for expected result.\n2014-09-10 12:12 GMT-04:00 Mike Burton notifications@github.com:\n\nIn roboguice/src/main/java/roboguice/util/LnImpl.java:\n\n@@ -225,6 +223,18 @@ protected String getTag() {\nreturn tag;\n }\n+\n-    //protected for testing.\n-    protected String formatArgs(final String s, Object... args) {\n-        //this is a bit tricky : if args is null, it is passed to formatting\n-        //(and yes this can still break depending on conversion of the formatter, see String.format)\n-        //else if there is no args, we return the message as-is, otherwise we pass args to formatting normally.\n-        if( args != null && args.length == 0 ) {\n-            return s;\n\nFor Ln.i(\"display string: %s\", null) it seems like we would print out:\n\"display string: %s\"\nin the logs.

(Though a warning is always a small distraction.)\nFor our unit tests, which use RoboGuice (a custom 2.0) and Robolectric (a custom 1.5), we have a leak which seems to be around Finalizers. We used YourKit to do a memory profile of a test run. A snapshot after the tests had reached a critical memory situation showed 730 instances of com.google.inject.internal.InjectorImpl with a retained size of 108MB. There are also 83,851 java.lang.ref.Finalizer instances. Given those numbers I started looking for a known memory leak around Guice, and found the above ticket.\nAdmittedly, it could be because of the old versions of our test tools, or some other issue. If you really think this is the wrong tree, I will bark somewhere else.\n. We are trying RoboGuice 2.0 with Guice 4.0beta using some  in our pom.xml. We are still experiencing memory leaks, that I believe could be caused by the anonymous inner class thread local in Guice's InjectorImpl. I see that is changed in the latest code to a static inner class: https://code.google.com/p/google-guice/source/browse/core/src/com/google/inject/internal/InjectorImpl.java#1064\nAnyway, upgrading to 4.0 would close this ticket. I'll follow up with explanation if we get to the bottom of the memory leaks we are seeing. \n. Since it is a test thing, putting it on RoboGuice.util along with reset() would make a lot of sense. I'm not sure if we could take the same approach of adding to the injectors map lazily.\n. ",

    "inteloid": "+1 to Egorand\n. Hi guys, it seems to be onContentChanged is being called differently on 2.3 and 4.2, because on a 4.2 you can do findViewById inside it and get current views, whereas on 2.3 the same findViewById basically returns null.\n. it seems to me that onContentChanged is being called before the actual content is in place when extending from ActionBarActivity and only on 2.3, when extending from 2.3 Application directly, everything works fine. Any clues?\n. Hey, sorry for not updating you on this. I've filed a bug on Android Support libraries, and they've fixed it, will be included in next release: https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=59445&q=onContentChanged&colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Owner%20Summary%20Stars\nThe workaround was to implement a base activity and override setContentView, inside setContentView I manually call onContentChanged :-(. Hope they will release soon.\n. Use a flag like this, and do checks in onContentChanged.\njava\n@Override\npublic void setContentView(View view) {\n    super.setContentView(view);\n    afterSetContentView = true;\n    onContentChanged();\n}\n. My case ended up with something different, because I needed onContentChange to be executed not only after setContentView. Anyway, currently I've just surrounded RoboGuice.getInjector(this).injectViewMembers(this); with a try/catch block.\njava\n@Override\npublic void onContentChanged() {\n    super.onContentChanged();\n    try {\n        RoboGuice.getInjector(this).injectViewMembers(this);\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n        Log.e(TAG, e.getMessage());\n    }\n    eventManager.fire(new OnContentChangedEvent());\n}\n. Of course, you can replace it with catch for NPE. Flag approach doesn't work, because there can be cases (except setConyentView) where you need that metod to be called.\n. Well, honestly, that's a bit irrelevant to the topic, and even if you catch  TheMostSpecificForThisCaseException, it's not a nice hack, it's just a workaround until newer support library is released. And actually the NPE is being thrown on support libraries side and it's not possible to prevent it, so we just HAVE TO catch it somewhere, right?\n. The thing should be fixed now, they had a release: http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=59445\n. BTW, they've introduced in v19 onSupportContentChanged() method. Now it seems to be working.\n. ",
    "kelsos": "I also encountered the same issue at some point while working with RoboGuice 2.0 so my guess is that it is not restricted to ActionBarActivity.\n. The provided namespace is for use with the native fragments supported in the latest versions of Android.  If you want the support RoboFragment for older versions check a level above (remove the provided from the namespace). \nYou need to import roboguice.fragment.RoboFragment instead of roboguice.fragment.provided.RoboFragment \n. I am really not sure how this blocks any kind of sdk updates, since you can easily work around the issue inside your project.\nHere is the source of AppCompatActivity.\nYou can create your own RoboAppCompatActivity as a base for your activities by copying the code of the original AppCompatActivity and then making it inherit from RoboFragmentActivity or some other basic RoboActivity.\n. Usually I create my modules like the following example:\n``` java\npackage com.sample.roboguice\nimport com.google.inject.AbstractModule;\npublic class Module extends AbstractModule{\n  @Override protected void configure() {\n}\n}\n```\nThe configure method has all your bindings e.g.:\njava\n bind(ObjectMapper.class).toProvider(ObjectMapperProvider.class).asEagerSingleton();\nDoes this help?\n. Have you tried deactivating the Instant Run option in Android Studio?\n. I had to rebuild roboblender with the following lines mentioned above and use a local snapshot.\n. It has been a while since the v4.0.0 release. I have already upgraded two projects to v4.0.0 and it works without an issue.\nThere is no news on updated documentation yet as far as I know. \nRegarding the change log, it focuses mostly on performance optimizations and gets rid of all the Robo* classes, which in turn means that you have to do some extra work in order to get it running.\n. @milind169 RoboGuice is not under development anymore.\nYou should consider either creating your own RoboAppCompatActivity based on the RoboActionBarActivity and include it in your project, or if you have the time and resources you should migrate to another DI framework that is actively maintained.\nI found out that the migration path from RoboGuice to Toothpick was relatively easy.

Well, one such side effect is that you don't publish the Guice types in your -sources artifact, meaning I get no Javadocs on Guice types (which is helpful when working with more complex module bindings). The same appear to be true for the javax artifacts, though source/javadocs for those is less important.\n. Discovered another side effect that is a dealbreaker; adding a Guice extension such as the Multibindings (com.google.inject.extensions:guice-multibindings:3.0) extension will fail at runtime for a NoClassDefFoundError for com.google.inject.internal.util.ImmutableList. Your repackaged version does not include this class from what I can see. I cannot include Guice 3.0 myself because of the aforementioned duplicate class entry warnings from Dex so it's not clear to me how one could use these extensions without having to repackage them themselves.\n. Update -- managed to work around this after realizing Roboguice 3 was relying on Guice 4 fork, so multibindings 4.0-beta5 works (after excluding its transitive dependency).\n. \n",

    "rcarragher": "I'd like to reuse the injector from one run to the next. This is going to mean that I need access to the injectors instance variable. I've been goofing with this locally, and it has made a significant performance improvement for us. The idea is, if we don't yet have an injector (i.e. this is the first test run), let RoboGuice do it's thing. Otherwise, reuse the injector. Now, in our prepareTest(), instead of using RoboGuice.setBaseApplicationInjector(), we use TestRoboGuice.getTestInjector().\n```\npublic class TestRoboGuice extends RoboGuice {\n    public TestRoboGuice(){}\nprivate static Injector injector = null;\n\npublic static Injector getTestInjector(final Application application, Stage stage, Module... modules){\n    if (injector == null){\n        injector = setBaseApplicationInjector(application,stage,modules);\n    } else {\n        injectors.put(application,injector);\n    }\n    return injector;\n}\n\n}\n``\n. Because the injectors map in RoboGuice is declared protected, by inheriting from RoboGuice I can have access to it. In other words, sub-classing gives me direct access to what I need, note theinjectors.put()` in my snippet above.

I tried specifying the library package in both ways: as prefix for the 1st parameter or passing it in the 3rd parameter. In bot cases, got 0 as result.\n. ",

I think it would be more important to first get the maven build right.\nWhat about the (same?) problem I mentioned with your sample app \"astroboy\"?\n. I got the maven build working, but I don't know exactly what solved it now. I updated maven from 3.1.1 to 3.2.3, am using jdk 8 now, added roboblender to the dependencies, changed versions to 3.0.1, added attributes like resourceDirectory to the android maven plugin and ... removed an injection of an inner class.\nNow I'm trying to fix the eclipse problems. If there is a general solution, maybe applicable with maven, I will let you know. Thanks for the hints.\n. In eclipse I'm having the same error message now like #246 but I don't know how to fix this.\nxml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>org.roboguice</groupId>\n    <artifactId>roboblender</artifactId>\n    <version>3.0.1</version>\n    <scope>provided</scope>\n</dependency>\nclasses.dex is containing ./roboguice/AnnotationDatabaseImpl.class...\n.

Sorry for the late response.\nI run the app and collect the log again but this time in Verbose level. The log is a little big, so put it in my dropbox: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1995295/temp/error.txt\nThe dexdump from the generated apk is much bigger and I don't how what to expect. I tried Ctrl+F with org/roboguice/shaded/goole/common/collect/ImmutableSortedSet and gave me several matches. Maybe you have a better understanding of the file: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1995295/temp/dexdump.txt\n. ",

All of them declare their retention policy as CLASS (the default), instead of RUNTIME. I guess we'll need to define our own custom retained Nullable annotation if we need to support conditional injections.\n. ",
    "jon-adams": "I can confirm the official Android support library Nullable does cause this problem.\nIn the short term, the wiki https://github.com/roboguice/roboguice/wiki/What%27s-the-difference-between-Nullable-and-Optional%3F should be updated to reflect this. Right now it still advises users that the support library will work, which it does not.\nIn the long term, RoboGuice should either implement its own, or depend on a simple library that has a standard implementation that has an appropriate retention policy.\nAlso, the error log message in this case should mention the retention policything, since users might continue to use the Nullable from the support library not knowing that it won't work. It will greatly confused them if they see a Nullable in the source but then see a error message saying its not.\nWorkaround: You can use most other Nullable annotation instances, or even write your own easily, since RoboGuice only checks for the class name by string compare to \"Nullable\".\nI am currently using the Findbugs implementation of the official JSR for Nullable. To use that, in your module gradle.build add:\ncompile 'com.google.code.findbugs:jsr305:1.3.9'\n. RoboGuice 3.0 did indeed change RoboActivity.shouldInjectOnCreateView to always return false to \"fix\" this. However, then you don't get view injection in some cases. \nI prefer to instead replace RoboActivity with the same one as RoboGuice 3 except I leave the RoboGuice 2 shouldInjectOnCreateView method the way it was. To get around the original crash though, I add additional filters as I come across them. Example:\n```\nprotected static boolean shouldInjectOnCreateView(final String name) {\n     // RoboGuice 3 implementation\n     // return false; // boo! lazy fix\n // original RoboGuice 2 implementation\n return Character.isLowerCase(name.charAt(0)) && !name.startsWith(\"com.android\") \n        && !name.equals(\"fragment\")\n        // this is an additional namespace I've added to this logic filter\n        && !name.startsWith(\"android.widget\");\n\n}\n```\n.

    "clementhely": "To solve it, we basically changed our activity to extend ActionBarActivity and to implement RoboContext, instead of simply extending RoboActionBarActivity. This means we had to replicate the lifecycle and injection logic from RoboActionBarActivity, removing the lines responsible for the crash.\nDid that a while ago, so I'm not exactly sure what the logic behind it was, but after investigating, we figured that the crash was happening because of these lines, in the onCreateView() methods:\njava\nif (RoboActivity.shouldInjectOnCreateView(name))\n            return RoboActivity.injectOnCreateView(name, context, attrs);\nSo creating our own activity class, without these two calls to RoboActivity.injectOnCreateView(name, context, attrs) solved the problem. I think this is because shouldInjectOnCreateView(String) was checking if the name contained a package name, and if the package name wasn't starting by com.android. But looking at this commit, it seems that this behaviour changed in Roboguice 3.0 (at the time we were using 3.0.0-alpha2), so it's possible that this issue is not happening anymore, otherwise you can create your own activity class, removing the calls to RoboActivity.injectOnCreateView, as we did.\n.
