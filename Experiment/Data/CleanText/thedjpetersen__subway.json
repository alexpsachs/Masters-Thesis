    "thedjpetersen": "I went ahead and put in @akavlie 's work on this I forgot to tag the commit for this issue.\n. Thinking out loud.\nI think there should be the UI views that derive from each other\n- ChatApplicationView\n  - OverviewView\n  - ChatView\n    - ChannelView\n    - ChatView\n      - ChatTitleView\n      - ChatWordsView\n      - ChatInputView\n    - UserListView\n      - UserListTitleView\n      - UserListDisplayView (Need to think of a better name)\n. We'll say that at this point this is good.\n. Its only a problem with the logo correct?\n. I really like the animated scroll. I think it looks great, but it does call issues when you have multiple messages. What about having a smaller time for the new messages to scroll?\n. I guess you really should be only scrolling to the last recieved message.\n. I like the idea of speech bubbles but it doesn't always work so well with lots of messages. I also like the idea of 37signals campfire esque messages.\n. At the very least you should be able to turn off the showing the date. I feel like this could be a checkbox on the input box.\n. Note here are some of the different ideas:\n- http://www.solutionwatch.com/images/office_campfire_chat_full.gif\n- http://watchingapple.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/ichat-tabs.png\n- http://dribbble.com/shots/349379-Skype-chat-in-my-world\n- http://dribbble.com/shots/194068-More-chat-console-interface-UX-UI\n. I will try to work something out. I think its really good idea to keep the background of the chat contents white though.\n. The new UI addresses these issues.\n. The only real problem is with the logo correct?\n. At what resolution would the percentage resolution become a problem?\n. I'll checkout the code and get back to you as soon as possible.\n. Good work @akavlie done.\n. We can process these ourselves, I did it in the subway-web code.\n. If you filter on the first characters of the stream, you just have to look for the 'ACTION' string.\n. Here is the line in subway-web:\nhttps://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway-web/blob/master/assets/javascripts/subway_views.js#L13\n. No I just wanted you to see the code before I merged it. It gives me a little bit more accountability. \n. If you wanted me just to merge branches though I am fine doing that too.\n. I feel like this is more or less ready to be merged. I would like a way though for the user to define regexs and colors to be alerted. I guess that is a feature for later down the line.\n. Could we put this in a try catch block?\n. I need to design the logo...getting around to it. Someday?\n/part should work without a channel, and just quit the current active channel, and set the active channel to the last one in the list.\n. No I am just saying that it is on my things to do. I think that is sensible to do the nearest one.\n. I'll leave the 'x' buttons to you.\n. The X buttons look good but I think they should only be displayed when the user hovers over a tab. I am thinking about how to do this.\n. I might roll that back until I have a good idea how to do it. You would need two hover states, one for the tab and one for the actual button itself.\n. Replace the scrollTo plugin with this.\n. I played around with this for a while and it looks like it isn't going to happen for a bit. The scrollTo plugin works well enough for what we need.\n. I resolved this with some of the userlist updates.\n. Looks good. Merging.\n. I think the twitter bootstrap alert would be fine.\n. Looks fine, I am not sure of the best practices for having your package.json file. \n. This issue is getting more important.\n. Implemented in the refactor branch\n. I read the diff and its looks good.\n. Hmm it is working for me...maybe I have unpushed work?\n. That would work too. We would still need a way for them to type in a server if they wanted though.\n. Here are some of the regressions I have seen:\n- Userlist behavior is unusual, idle/active icons not working as expected\n- There are at times the same user listed several times in the userlist\n- Links embedding not working.\n. I have fixed the userlist issues and the embedded media working on getting unread_mentions working correctly again.\n. Use the 'part' icon.\n. Yeh in essence I could just send you a link and then you would be able to follow it and would end up in a room.\n. Its really for people with no technical ability, they would just get dropped in the channel and then have that username.\n. I'll go ahead and take a look at this tomorrow morning.\n. You rock. High five.\n. I like this idea its probably a good idea to this with /part as well make the following all the same:\n/part /wc /close\n. /wc and /close are supported by irssi and weechat\n. @niftylettuce are you interested in maybe trying to implement this?\n. There was an issue with the template the userlist should be working now.\n. I think at the moment it is more important just to get the frontend client working well before we worry about a mobile version.\n. If you wanted to help with that, that would be awesome!\n. Ok I will start playing with it. If I can find another way to display it might be better.\n. So I have tried a few other designs but I cannot find something better. I think we are going to have to stick with this for the time being.\n. This is getting merged. Full steam ahead.\n. This should also probably be implemented as a plugin. #180\n. In the refactor branch you can now specify which messages you want to print\n. This is resolved now.\n. Ok I'll try to plan accordingly around that.\n. I am considering migrating the datastore to sqlite. I am hoping to get peoples feedback. Advantages/Disadvantages?\n. It may be easier to port with LevelDB as well since it is a key-value store.\n. Your server needs to be 'irc.freenode.net'\n. Ah ok, I am seeing it as well now. I'll try to track it down.\n. I'll close this as the client has been refactored.\n. At the moment we have only programmed it to use a mongodb backend. It would probably take about a day though to make a version that uses couchdb.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks I will try to get to this in the next couple of days.\n. Just curious what are some of the problems that could crop up?\n. At this point using the latest versions of all the packages should be fine, it seems to me that this would be a problem that would manifest itself pretty clearly, when it becomes a problem. \n. I am a little confused what is the issue this is resolving?\n. @akavlie implemented something similar to this. Look here:\nhttps://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway/blob/master/assets/js/views/chat_application.js#L19\n. Does it usually happen after a small amount of inactivity? This might be a focus issue.\n. Related gist: https://gist.github.com/1975421\n. I believe this is still causing problems: https://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway/blob/master/assets/js/views/chat_application.js#L29\nAs far as I can tell this is a race condition where the client loses focus and somehow the previous window gets assigned as the active one.\n. I haven't been able to duplicate the issue, as far as I can tell the focus for you is never getting fired. Could you confirm that L29 is getting called? @bitemyapp \n. Closing as this should be fixed in the new client. If more people run into it I think it will get reopened.\n. This should be taken care of now with this fix: https://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway/commit/afff83eb0414452ca007546166d8b570d85f8b31\n. This is probably a client side error, can you get the trace from the chrome debugger?\n. As this issue has likely gone stale do you have any additional info @bitemyapp ? I will close unless you feel otherwise. Sorry about the delay.\n. This should be handled more gracefully now as in the refactor client we won't get caught in a reconnect loop\n. @tjfontaine did you update the pull request?\n. Done in the refactor client. We send all client errors to status window for that server.\n. I went ahead and added the fade, by putting opacity on the main container. I like the idea of adding a reconnect button somewhere on the page.\n. Resolving this as per @ericbarch s response\n. I went ahead and resolved this, nick changes weren't implemented yet, thanks for the detailed bug report.\n. I don't think I understand that this issue, you want the bcrypt dependency removed?\n. Now in the refactor branch you can connect to as many servers as you want from one active session.\n. @cwc this looks like it might resolve your earlier issue.\n. I don't really like adding an additional installation step. \n. Just make config.js.sample config.js and this able to automatically merge and it will be good.\n. This will be resolved with the plugins issue. #180\n. There is a embedImage plugin for the new client: https://gist.github.com/thedjpetersen/dd420dd13d9c5c35ba31 . This could be added as a setting for that plugin.\n. I am not to familiar with this protocol - would someone want to take a whack at implementing this?\n. You probably need to set up your http server to proxy traffic to the node.js instance.\n. Sorry about the very late response.\n. Thanks!\n. Right now we are storing channel history for each channel on the refactor branch. I think its pretty standard to just store messages from a channel - is there any reason not to?\n. Do you have a suggestion for an implementation?\n. Not necessarily code wise. I was more referring to how the implementation should look/feel.\n. Moving discussion to newer feature request.\n. Implemented in the refactor branch. Normal session storage.\n. Go ahead feel free to PM me if you are still having issues.\n. Looked at the commit - looks fine to me feel free to send a pull request\n. This would probably be implemented as a plugin - once the plugin system is implemented.\n. At this point it would take some kind spirit to host it. I don't have the resources personally to keep a demo running. Nodejitsu doesn't have an unlimited free plan. Heroku might be a good option for this as well.\n. This looks good - I am not sure what the error is for setup though :/\n. This may help: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/using-socket-io-with-node-js-on-heroku\n. Linode was gracious enough to let me use a instance to host a demo installation I went ahead and updated the readme to reflect this.\n. If you switch channels and then come back to the original channel does the problem persist?\n. Working on this in the refactored version of the client see #292 for progress\n. This is difficult, because I for one prefer to see the server in that spot. This seems like it would be something to add in the settings area(if they ever get implemented).\n. It looks like to accomplish need to do the following:\n- Add some parameters to the config.js file specifying the server and channel to connect to\n- You would then need to somehow trigger the connect event and then after you have connected the join event\nI have played around with this but have not found an easy way to implement it.\n. I spent the day thinking about this and I probably closed it prematurely. I will reopen this in case someone else wants to take a whack at it.\n. For those still interested you can now set a list of default servers/channels in the server settings file that the client will connect to on startup\n. Would it go to reason that if a person set a list of default server/channels they wouldn't want to allow additional server/channels?\n. Right now you have to refresh the page to connect to a new IRC server.\n. It is definitely something I would be interested in seeing implemented. I would gladly look over any patch.\n. Looks good to me! Thanks!\n. Probably could implement arrows to scroll up and down - the implementation of this needs to happen in ChannelListView\n. The solution to this is probably using the bootstraps up/down carets and having a backbone view control behavior.\n. so this has been done in the refactored version please see the refactor branch\n. @ngokevin poke poke\n. Looks like this might have gone stale. I'll look at re-opening it if it gets updated.\n. Thanks\n. Thanks!\n. This should resolve #154\n. Looks great thanks for including the link.\n. Thanks!\n. Never mind about the leaving it up, I wasn't aware of the nodejitsu pricing plan. The subway app there now is not mine, I don't know how put it up, I have been thinking I need to have an example app somewhere. I hosted it for a while on my own VPS but was receiving more traffic than I liked.\n. I went ahead and added you as a major contributor.\n. Thanks!\n. This was done here https://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway/pull/157\n. Looks good to me thanks.\n. In the refactored version I am just using the font-awesome circle. It seems to work pretty well.\n. It might be valuable to look at the subway charm as well.\n. Can you find a reproduce case?\n. @cwc thanks I'll dig into it this weekend\n. Is there any client side error during this?\n. I'll go ahead and investigate this.\n. Relevant error:\nTypeError: Cannot read property 'chans' of undefined\nat Socket.module.exports.socket.on.socket.on.name (../subway/lib/socket.js:107:28)\n. Fixed with the latest commit.\n. I have a different approach in mind for this.\n. You can specify a remote mongo source here: https://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway/blob/master/config.js#L10 I am not sure how you would pass the password though - it might take some monkeying in the source.\n. I am not quite sure what this issue is asking for. Do you want to specify the port for your instance of subway?\n. I am not sure how I would implement this do you want to take a crack at it?\n. Double clicking is a good idea but I think I will go about this a message icon instead.\n. There should probably be a plugin folder that contains plugins and then a variable in the config where you specify which plugins you want to enable.\n. Updated the node-irc dep, as well the bootstrap/backbone ones.\n. @hermansc Unfortunately this bug has mutated a bit in the new branch - want to take a look at it?\n. @Fauntleroy did you have any luck tracking this down? If you can provide any additional info I can go ahead and take a look at it as well.\n. Thanks! Looking forward to seeing your IRC client. I would love to hear more about it. Feel free to ping me on freenode if you want to talk about it, I idle under the nick petersed\n. Are you running ubuntu @tvamsisai ?\n. You did this? \nsudo apt-get install libssl-dev\n. If people are still using this, I can also update the package dependencies. But I would highly encourage all of you to take a look at shout, which is actively maintained.. Thanks!\n. I am sorry I am little confused. What do you mean using subway \"only for localhost\"?\n. Right you beat me to the punch - I'll go ahead and review again.\n. Thanks Kevin.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. I'll take another pass on this.\n. Pulled this down and am re-architecting it a bit.\n. So I feel bad for leaving this open for so long. After taking a long look at it I don't think this is the approach that most people have requested. The idea would be for a server to connect to as soon as the client is opened and then drop the person in a room. So I am closing this for now.\n. Thanks for reporting!\n. Can you please keep your pull requests seperate. The default server code is correctly in a seperate pull request and should not be here. \n. I am running into this same problem - I will change the package.json to reference connect-assets github repo\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. This is an issue with node-irc https://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway/issues/190\n. Mentions should match anywhere.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Should be fixed. Feel like a bit of a broken record referencing the refactor branch.\n. The overlay/confirm dialog is gone in the refactor version of the app.\n. Would changing the color of the font work as well?\n. Thanks @eirikb !\n. Right now both the frontend and backend are tightly coupled so this functionality is not available.\n. Thanks for the pull request! I don't necessarily like the way this changes the UI though. If you have other ideas for the way this could be implemented feel free to re-open.\n. Full topic displayed in the reactor branch\n. This issue is a dupe \nhttps://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway/issues/179\n. Sorry for the confusion. This ended up being decided in a separate issue( see here: #70 ). I am afraid there isn't any clear migration path.\n. Thanks!\n. Would be useful to have a setting to turn this on/off as well\n. Server messages, specifically MOTD, should be rendering cleanly in the refactor branch\n. Subway is in the process of being refactored - this should be fixed in the refactor branch. If you test it and the issue still persists could you reopen?\n. I agree - its probably something to come back and revisit a later date\n. Looks so cool :smile: \n. Thanks!\n. Thanks - probably overly aggressively merged the last solution.\n. As soon as conflicts are resolved I'll merge this\n. I went ahead and committed this - let me know if you are still running into trouble\n. Could you pull the latest and test again?\n. Dupe of #252 \n. Subway is in the process of being refactored - this should be fixed in the refactor branch. If you test it and the issue still persists could you reopen?\n. Thanks!\n. Published\n. Subway is in the process of being refactored - this should be fixed in the refactor branch. If you test it and the issue still persists could you reopen?\n. Implemented in the refactor branch.\n. @badosu could you take a quick look at this since you added the client_port attribute?\n. Thanks for the input @badosu , guess it all LGTM!\n. In the future I believe this should just be a plugin\n. See #292 \n. Do any of you have a repro case? I would like to try to solve this one? Is there someplace I can just go copy and paste colored text?\n. I am going to go ahead and close this one out. As mentioned above let's have this be implemented as a plugin.\n. @BYK is your only issue with react a stylistic thing?\n. Ok I have put the work on the refactor branch - very little works, just a heads up\n. @46bit I am taking that approach from the beginning with the rewrite\n. @hermansc as soon as the newer version reaches feature parity - I would like it to replace the master branch. If the refactor stagnates - nothing will change.\n. @46bit sure I'll hop on for a bit\n. Quick update: \nThe rewrite is coming swimmingly so far. Handling and emitting raw IRC commands has been much easier than working with the node-irc wrapper commands. As you can see from the checkbox list above I am working slowly trying to get parity with weechat commands. I need to ensure that I am handling every received event on the frontend as well. If anyone wants to help with this be sure to ping me and I would love to give more info on this. After the client can is fully functional, I'll work on adding persistence and then polishing up the UI.\n. Took some time off of writing support of commands to polish up the settings. Next up is porting the legacy persistence/auth setup. I would love to hear feedback about the settings work I did as well. \n. So the work for backend persistence is well underway. I have sketched out something basic right now and committed it. I will have to revisit it. At the moment everytime there is a state change in the client I am just persisting it with a sync call on the client. I will need to implement something that keeps track of a logged in client through a server method.\n. After discussing with @hermansc in the IRC channel - its clear the most optimal way to keep track of the state of client on the server is to modify the client code so it can be used by the server. This includes the backbone models and the irc handling code.\n. Fixed some minor bugs with the persistence going to add logging of messages next - also need to move that massive checklist of commands above somewhere else\n. Basic logging implemented - need to make it so when history is loaded it doesn't greedily continue to load history. This should be accomplished by maintaining the scrollbar position. \nIf I could get some feedback on this work from anyone I would really appreciate it as well.\n. Getting really close to a RC - could really use some people to help me test the client out and identify bugs.\n. Badosu - I haven't documented it yet but it works more or less like this:\nInfo about creating a plugin:\n- Plugins are Github gists(the easiest way to create them is to fork an existing one)\n- To add a plugin to subway you need to add it here(https://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway-plugins/blob/master/plugins.json)\n\nPlugin syntax\n- Plugins are defined to the app.plugins namespace\n- The plugin method accepts the message - and returns the parsed message(as an html object) and a listener(which can be attached to the element)\n. ah ok - still new to the npm dependencies thing\n. what is the format?\n. This is really neat. A quick note: I have worked on refactoring the client trying to make it more robust and easier to maintain the frontend code(using bower and grunt). If you would consider porting this work over to the refactor branch I would love to get it in here. Sorry that the work for this branch was lost.\n. Thanks\n. I can totally get behind this - cool!\n. Thanks!\n. I dropped bootstrap and am just writing lightweight css for most of the client.\n. Making it mobile compatible needs to be a priority, but probably needs to be captured as a separate issue. \n. Closing - server messages should be rendering cleanly in the refactor branch\n. Is this when you have an active session(i.e logged into the server?)\n. Thanks!\n. This is resolved now\n. haven't created a way to do this yet no\n. Also there is a on-going rewrite tracked in #292 this is something that I could target to add in that.\n. Right now I am leaning towards leaving this info in the config instead of env variables\n. Going forward we'll be working off the refactor branch. I am kind of on the fence as far as whether or I want to disable the login/register buttons - but if there was more support for this feature I would roll it in.\n. neato\n. Looks like I wiped them out when I replaced it with the refactored version - I'll go ahead and manually re-add these. Sorry about that\n. Having a little trouble understanding the issue on this one - if you could provide a little more context I might be able to help more.\n. what is the error you are getting?\n. Could this be implemented as a plugin? I assume you want these handlers to act on URIs in messages. Example of a plugin: https://gist.github.com/thedjpetersen/9140203\n. Ah ok I think I understand a little better now. This is something I would consider as a pull request more than an issue - handling the query string parameters could be a little tricky.\nClosing for now.\n. This is fixed in the refactor branch which will be the source of future development. Thanks for the pull request - sorry the work wasn't included.\n. Neat project - but right now outside the scope of subway. I would probably reconsider if this was brought back as a pull request.\n. hermansc - try to catch me on irc where we can flesh this out a little bit more and then maybe circle back to comment here\nnote this is the idea of the settings/server.js settings/client.js files\n. Since we all seem to be in agreement about this - we'll close this issue. If there is a specific thing you want added - that can be opened as a seperate issue.\n. Looks like this is related to somehow having a bad session cookie - the fix should just be testing whether or not the user is defined.\n. Fixed with last push\n. Any other Linux users able to repro this? It seems to work fine for me on Mac.\n. I think the problem he is having @totokaka is that it doesn't go away even when there is no where to scroll.\n. I was able to fix the jumping up bug - it happens when you are embedding image/youtube. That is unrelated.\n. Should be fixed now\n. This is another tough one to repro. This happened I believe when two users were simultaneously connected to the same room? \n. Note: This is when two logged in users are connected - it happens to one of the logged in users\n. Can you provide any more context I am having a little trouble repro-ing?\n. Should now be resolved \n. You can do this right now in the settings - you can select what types of messages you want to see\n. It should be saving your settings everytime you make a change something.\nSee here: https://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway/blob/refactor/src/components/settings/general.jsx#L33\n. This is implemented for different highlights. See here: https://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway/blob/refactor/src/js/boilerplate.js#L124\n. ah I understand - there isn't currently a way to do this. Do you think this justifies a notification? \n. This is the line that is failing: https://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway/blob/refactor/src/components/settings/general.jsx#L33\n. I would love to dig into this more, but this error message/description is just to brief to reproduce more. Was this happening after you disconnected and refreshed? I'll go ahead and close this - feel free to reopen if you have more info.\n. Most likely related to a bug with kicking users - leaving this open a bit to see if it crops up again for me\n. Hi Wilfried!\nUntil the client is really finished there is a target date for distributing Subway other than with github and eventually npm.\n. So locally I am able to join a channel named '#' using the tip of master\n. Could you retest please?\n. Dupe of #152 \n. Is there any documentation on this standard?\n. the package.json standard - I am just wondering why you need the 'js' extension\n. ah ok I found it https://www.npmjs.org/doc/files/package.json.html\n. A bit out of the scope of this project\n. A little tough to read the diff - what is this changing besides removing jQuery?\n. OK great! Just one little stylistic thing and this should be good to merge. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. What is the error you are getting? Did you install the dependencies?\n. Great! So it looks like you started the chat client correctly. To connect to freenode you type the following into the connect form:\nirc.freenode.net\n  Abc_123\nThen push \"connect\" - after you have connected to join the node.js channel you just type in \"/join #node.js\"\nHope that works for you!\n. Interesting - this feature is not in subway yet please refer to issue #152 \n. @Elmit2015 just a heads up this just landed in the tip of master - you can now set default channel/nick for users\n. no your config is correct this looks like it is definitely a bug\n. @abruzzihraig I am having quite a bit of trouble reproducing usually this is related to earlier activity could you paste a longer log of the irc activity before this broke?\n. If you create a user and then are logged in with the user it will log messages. Otherwise it doesn't. \n. Just a quick note - user persistence though is not working very well atm check some of the more recent issues. It may not be a bad idea to check out 'shout'.\n. @hrj probably not going to write a guide. Too busy working on the stability of the client. If you wanted to open a pull request with a doc in the support folder I would give it a good look.\n. Did you say this was after a connection reset? It looks like you somehow stayed on a channel after you were disconnected\n. I'm down with this\n. I went ahead and put in @akavlie 's work on this I forgot to tag the commit for this issue.\n. Thinking out loud.\nI think there should be the UI views that derive from each other\n- ChatApplicationView\n  - OverviewView\n  - ChatView\n    - ChannelView\n    - ChatView\n      - ChatTitleView\n      - ChatWordsView\n      - ChatInputView\n    - UserListView\n      - UserListTitleView\n      - UserListDisplayView (Need to think of a better name)\n. We'll say that at this point this is good.\n. Its only a problem with the logo correct?\n. I really like the animated scroll. I think it looks great, but it does call issues when you have multiple messages. What about having a smaller time for the new messages to scroll?\n. I guess you really should be only scrolling to the last recieved message.\n. I like the idea of speech bubbles but it doesn't always work so well with lots of messages. I also like the idea of 37signals campfire esque messages.\n. At the very least you should be able to turn off the showing the date. I feel like this could be a checkbox on the input box.\n. Note here are some of the different ideas:\n- http://www.solutionwatch.com/images/office_campfire_chat_full.gif\n- http://watchingapple.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/ichat-tabs.png\n- http://dribbble.com/shots/349379-Skype-chat-in-my-world\n- http://dribbble.com/shots/194068-More-chat-console-interface-UX-UI\n. I will try to work something out. I think its really good idea to keep the background of the chat contents white though.\n. The new UI addresses these issues.\n. The only real problem is with the logo correct?\n. At what resolution would the percentage resolution become a problem?\n. I'll checkout the code and get back to you as soon as possible.\n. Good work @akavlie done.\n. We can process these ourselves, I did it in the subway-web code.\n. If you filter on the first characters of the stream, you just have to look for the 'ACTION' string.\n. Here is the line in subway-web:\nhttps://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway-web/blob/master/assets/javascripts/subway_views.js#L13\n. No I just wanted you to see the code before I merged it. It gives me a little bit more accountability. \n. If you wanted me just to merge branches though I am fine doing that too.\n. I feel like this is more or less ready to be merged. I would like a way though for the user to define regexs and colors to be alerted. I guess that is a feature for later down the line.\n. Could we put this in a try catch block?\n. I need to design the logo...getting around to it. Someday?\n/part should work without a channel, and just quit the current active channel, and set the active channel to the last one in the list.\n. No I am just saying that it is on my things to do. I think that is sensible to do the nearest one.\n. I'll leave the 'x' buttons to you.\n. The X buttons look good but I think they should only be displayed when the user hovers over a tab. I am thinking about how to do this.\n. I might roll that back until I have a good idea how to do it. You would need two hover states, one for the tab and one for the actual button itself.\n. Replace the scrollTo plugin with this.\n. I played around with this for a while and it looks like it isn't going to happen for a bit. The scrollTo plugin works well enough for what we need.\n. I resolved this with some of the userlist updates.\n. Looks good. Merging.\n. I think the twitter bootstrap alert would be fine.\n. Looks fine, I am not sure of the best practices for having your package.json file. \n. This issue is getting more important.\n. Implemented in the refactor branch\n. I read the diff and its looks good.\n. Hmm it is working for me...maybe I have unpushed work?\n. That would work too. We would still need a way for them to type in a server if they wanted though.\n. Here are some of the regressions I have seen:\n- Userlist behavior is unusual, idle/active icons not working as expected\n- There are at times the same user listed several times in the userlist\n- Links embedding not working.\n. I have fixed the userlist issues and the embedded media working on getting unread_mentions working correctly again.\n. Use the 'part' icon.\n. Yeh in essence I could just send you a link and then you would be able to follow it and would end up in a room.\n. Its really for people with no technical ability, they would just get dropped in the channel and then have that username.\n. I'll go ahead and take a look at this tomorrow morning.\n. You rock. High five.\n. I like this idea its probably a good idea to this with /part as well make the following all the same:\n/part /wc /close\n. /wc and /close are supported by irssi and weechat\n. @niftylettuce are you interested in maybe trying to implement this?\n. There was an issue with the template the userlist should be working now.\n. I think at the moment it is more important just to get the frontend client working well before we worry about a mobile version.\n. If you wanted to help with that, that would be awesome!\n. Ok I will start playing with it. If I can find another way to display it might be better.\n. So I have tried a few other designs but I cannot find something better. I think we are going to have to stick with this for the time being.\n. This is getting merged. Full steam ahead.\n. This should also probably be implemented as a plugin. #180\n. In the refactor branch you can now specify which messages you want to print\n. This is resolved now.\n. Ok I'll try to plan accordingly around that.\n. I am considering migrating the datastore to sqlite. I am hoping to get peoples feedback. Advantages/Disadvantages?\n. It may be easier to port with LevelDB as well since it is a key-value store.\n. Your server needs to be 'irc.freenode.net'\n. Ah ok, I am seeing it as well now. I'll try to track it down.\n. I'll close this as the client has been refactored.\n. At the moment we have only programmed it to use a mongodb backend. It would probably take about a day though to make a version that uses couchdb.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks I will try to get to this in the next couple of days.\n. Just curious what are some of the problems that could crop up?\n. At this point using the latest versions of all the packages should be fine, it seems to me that this would be a problem that would manifest itself pretty clearly, when it becomes a problem. \n. I am a little confused what is the issue this is resolving?\n. @akavlie implemented something similar to this. Look here:\nhttps://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway/blob/master/assets/js/views/chat_application.js#L19\n. Does it usually happen after a small amount of inactivity? This might be a focus issue.\n. Related gist: https://gist.github.com/1975421\n. I believe this is still causing problems: https://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway/blob/master/assets/js/views/chat_application.js#L29\nAs far as I can tell this is a race condition where the client loses focus and somehow the previous window gets assigned as the active one.\n. I haven't been able to duplicate the issue, as far as I can tell the focus for you is never getting fired. Could you confirm that L29 is getting called? @bitemyapp \n. Closing as this should be fixed in the new client. If more people run into it I think it will get reopened.\n. This should be taken care of now with this fix: https://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway/commit/afff83eb0414452ca007546166d8b570d85f8b31\n. This is probably a client side error, can you get the trace from the chrome debugger?\n. As this issue has likely gone stale do you have any additional info @bitemyapp ? I will close unless you feel otherwise. Sorry about the delay.\n. This should be handled more gracefully now as in the refactor client we won't get caught in a reconnect loop\n. @tjfontaine did you update the pull request?\n. Done in the refactor client. We send all client errors to status window for that server.\n. I went ahead and added the fade, by putting opacity on the main container. I like the idea of adding a reconnect button somewhere on the page.\n. Resolving this as per @ericbarch s response\n. I went ahead and resolved this, nick changes weren't implemented yet, thanks for the detailed bug report.\n. I don't think I understand that this issue, you want the bcrypt dependency removed?\n. Now in the refactor branch you can connect to as many servers as you want from one active session.\n. @cwc this looks like it might resolve your earlier issue.\n. I don't really like adding an additional installation step. \n. Just make config.js.sample config.js and this able to automatically merge and it will be good.\n. This will be resolved with the plugins issue. #180\n. There is a embedImage plugin for the new client: https://gist.github.com/thedjpetersen/dd420dd13d9c5c35ba31 . This could be added as a setting for that plugin.\n. I am not to familiar with this protocol - would someone want to take a whack at implementing this?\n. You probably need to set up your http server to proxy traffic to the node.js instance.\n. Sorry about the very late response.\n. Thanks!\n. Right now we are storing channel history for each channel on the refactor branch. I think its pretty standard to just store messages from a channel - is there any reason not to?\n. Do you have a suggestion for an implementation?\n. Not necessarily code wise. I was more referring to how the implementation should look/feel.\n. Moving discussion to newer feature request.\n. Implemented in the refactor branch. Normal session storage.\n. Go ahead feel free to PM me if you are still having issues.\n. Looked at the commit - looks fine to me feel free to send a pull request\n. This would probably be implemented as a plugin - once the plugin system is implemented.\n. At this point it would take some kind spirit to host it. I don't have the resources personally to keep a demo running. Nodejitsu doesn't have an unlimited free plan. Heroku might be a good option for this as well.\n. This looks good - I am not sure what the error is for setup though :/\n. This may help: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/using-socket-io-with-node-js-on-heroku\n. Linode was gracious enough to let me use a instance to host a demo installation I went ahead and updated the readme to reflect this.\n. If you switch channels and then come back to the original channel does the problem persist?\n. Working on this in the refactored version of the client see #292 for progress\n. This is difficult, because I for one prefer to see the server in that spot. This seems like it would be something to add in the settings area(if they ever get implemented).\n. It looks like to accomplish need to do the following:\n- Add some parameters to the config.js file specifying the server and channel to connect to\n- You would then need to somehow trigger the connect event and then after you have connected the join event\nI have played around with this but have not found an easy way to implement it.\n. I spent the day thinking about this and I probably closed it prematurely. I will reopen this in case someone else wants to take a whack at it.\n. For those still interested you can now set a list of default servers/channels in the server settings file that the client will connect to on startup\n. Would it go to reason that if a person set a list of default server/channels they wouldn't want to allow additional server/channels?\n. Right now you have to refresh the page to connect to a new IRC server.\n. It is definitely something I would be interested in seeing implemented. I would gladly look over any patch.\n. Looks good to me! Thanks!\n. Probably could implement arrows to scroll up and down - the implementation of this needs to happen in ChannelListView\n. The solution to this is probably using the bootstraps up/down carets and having a backbone view control behavior.\n. so this has been done in the refactored version please see the refactor branch\n. @ngokevin poke poke\n. Looks like this might have gone stale. I'll look at re-opening it if it gets updated.\n. Thanks\n. Thanks!\n. This should resolve #154\n. Looks great thanks for including the link.\n. Thanks!\n. Never mind about the leaving it up, I wasn't aware of the nodejitsu pricing plan. The subway app there now is not mine, I don't know how put it up, I have been thinking I need to have an example app somewhere. I hosted it for a while on my own VPS but was receiving more traffic than I liked.\n. I went ahead and added you as a major contributor.\n. Thanks!\n. This was done here https://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway/pull/157\n. Looks good to me thanks.\n. In the refactored version I am just using the font-awesome circle. It seems to work pretty well.\n. It might be valuable to look at the subway charm as well.\n. Can you find a reproduce case?\n. @cwc thanks I'll dig into it this weekend\n. Is there any client side error during this?\n. I'll go ahead and investigate this.\n. Relevant error:\nTypeError: Cannot read property 'chans' of undefined\nat Socket.module.exports.socket.on.socket.on.name (../subway/lib/socket.js:107:28)\n. Fixed with the latest commit.\n. I have a different approach in mind for this.\n. You can specify a remote mongo source here: https://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway/blob/master/config.js#L10 I am not sure how you would pass the password though - it might take some monkeying in the source.\n. I am not quite sure what this issue is asking for. Do you want to specify the port for your instance of subway?\n. I am not sure how I would implement this do you want to take a crack at it?\n. Double clicking is a good idea but I think I will go about this a message icon instead.\n. There should probably be a plugin folder that contains plugins and then a variable in the config where you specify which plugins you want to enable.\n. Updated the node-irc dep, as well the bootstrap/backbone ones.\n. @hermansc Unfortunately this bug has mutated a bit in the new branch - want to take a look at it?\n. @Fauntleroy did you have any luck tracking this down? If you can provide any additional info I can go ahead and take a look at it as well.\n. Thanks! Looking forward to seeing your IRC client. I would love to hear more about it. Feel free to ping me on freenode if you want to talk about it, I idle under the nick petersed\n. Are you running ubuntu @tvamsisai ?\n. You did this? \nsudo apt-get install libssl-dev\n. If people are still using this, I can also update the package dependencies. But I would highly encourage all of you to take a look at shout, which is actively maintained.. Thanks!\n. I am sorry I am little confused. What do you mean using subway \"only for localhost\"?\n. Right you beat me to the punch - I'll go ahead and review again.\n. Thanks Kevin.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. I'll take another pass on this.\n. Pulled this down and am re-architecting it a bit.\n. So I feel bad for leaving this open for so long. After taking a long look at it I don't think this is the approach that most people have requested. The idea would be for a server to connect to as soon as the client is opened and then drop the person in a room. So I am closing this for now.\n. Thanks for reporting!\n. Can you please keep your pull requests seperate. The default server code is correctly in a seperate pull request and should not be here. \n. I am running into this same problem - I will change the package.json to reference connect-assets github repo\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. This is an issue with node-irc https://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway/issues/190\n. Mentions should match anywhere.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Should be fixed. Feel like a bit of a broken record referencing the refactor branch.\n. The overlay/confirm dialog is gone in the refactor version of the app.\n. Would changing the color of the font work as well?\n. Thanks @eirikb !\n. Right now both the frontend and backend are tightly coupled so this functionality is not available.\n. Thanks for the pull request! I don't necessarily like the way this changes the UI though. If you have other ideas for the way this could be implemented feel free to re-open.\n. Full topic displayed in the reactor branch\n. This issue is a dupe \nhttps://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway/issues/179\n. Sorry for the confusion. This ended up being decided in a separate issue( see here: #70 ). I am afraid there isn't any clear migration path.\n. Thanks!\n. Would be useful to have a setting to turn this on/off as well\n. Server messages, specifically MOTD, should be rendering cleanly in the refactor branch\n. Subway is in the process of being refactored - this should be fixed in the refactor branch. If you test it and the issue still persists could you reopen?\n. I agree - its probably something to come back and revisit a later date\n. Looks so cool :smile: \n. Thanks!\n. Thanks - probably overly aggressively merged the last solution.\n. As soon as conflicts are resolved I'll merge this\n. I went ahead and committed this - let me know if you are still running into trouble\n. Could you pull the latest and test again?\n. Dupe of #252 \n. Subway is in the process of being refactored - this should be fixed in the refactor branch. If you test it and the issue still persists could you reopen?\n. Thanks!\n. Published\n. Subway is in the process of being refactored - this should be fixed in the refactor branch. If you test it and the issue still persists could you reopen?\n. Implemented in the refactor branch.\n. @badosu could you take a quick look at this since you added the client_port attribute?\n. Thanks for the input @badosu , guess it all LGTM!\n. In the future I believe this should just be a plugin\n. See #292 \n. Do any of you have a repro case? I would like to try to solve this one? Is there someplace I can just go copy and paste colored text?\n. I am going to go ahead and close this one out. As mentioned above let's have this be implemented as a plugin.\n. @BYK is your only issue with react a stylistic thing?\n. Ok I have put the work on the refactor branch - very little works, just a heads up\n. @46bit I am taking that approach from the beginning with the rewrite\n. @hermansc as soon as the newer version reaches feature parity - I would like it to replace the master branch. If the refactor stagnates - nothing will change.\n. @46bit sure I'll hop on for a bit\n. Quick update: \nThe rewrite is coming swimmingly so far. Handling and emitting raw IRC commands has been much easier than working with the node-irc wrapper commands. As you can see from the checkbox list above I am working slowly trying to get parity with weechat commands. I need to ensure that I am handling every received event on the frontend as well. If anyone wants to help with this be sure to ping me and I would love to give more info on this. After the client can is fully functional, I'll work on adding persistence and then polishing up the UI.\n. Took some time off of writing support of commands to polish up the settings. Next up is porting the legacy persistence/auth setup. I would love to hear feedback about the settings work I did as well. \n. So the work for backend persistence is well underway. I have sketched out something basic right now and committed it. I will have to revisit it. At the moment everytime there is a state change in the client I am just persisting it with a sync call on the client. I will need to implement something that keeps track of a logged in client through a server method.\n. After discussing with @hermansc in the IRC channel - its clear the most optimal way to keep track of the state of client on the server is to modify the client code so it can be used by the server. This includes the backbone models and the irc handling code.\n. Fixed some minor bugs with the persistence going to add logging of messages next - also need to move that massive checklist of commands above somewhere else\n. Basic logging implemented - need to make it so when history is loaded it doesn't greedily continue to load history. This should be accomplished by maintaining the scrollbar position. \nIf I could get some feedback on this work from anyone I would really appreciate it as well.\n. Getting really close to a RC - could really use some people to help me test the client out and identify bugs.\n. Badosu - I haven't documented it yet but it works more or less like this:\nInfo about creating a plugin:\n- Plugins are Github gists(the easiest way to create them is to fork an existing one)\n- To add a plugin to subway you need to add it here(https://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway-plugins/blob/master/plugins.json)\n\nPlugin syntax\n- Plugins are defined to the app.plugins namespace\n- The plugin method accepts the message - and returns the parsed message(as an html object) and a listener(which can be attached to the element)\n. ah ok - still new to the npm dependencies thing\n. what is the format?\n. This is really neat. A quick note: I have worked on refactoring the client trying to make it more robust and easier to maintain the frontend code(using bower and grunt). If you would consider porting this work over to the refactor branch I would love to get it in here. Sorry that the work for this branch was lost.\n. Thanks\n. I can totally get behind this - cool!\n. Thanks!\n. I dropped bootstrap and am just writing lightweight css for most of the client.\n. Making it mobile compatible needs to be a priority, but probably needs to be captured as a separate issue. \n. Closing - server messages should be rendering cleanly in the refactor branch\n. Is this when you have an active session(i.e logged into the server?)\n. Thanks!\n. This is resolved now\n. haven't created a way to do this yet no\n. Also there is a on-going rewrite tracked in #292 this is something that I could target to add in that.\n. Right now I am leaning towards leaving this info in the config instead of env variables\n. Going forward we'll be working off the refactor branch. I am kind of on the fence as far as whether or I want to disable the login/register buttons - but if there was more support for this feature I would roll it in.\n. neato\n. Looks like I wiped them out when I replaced it with the refactored version - I'll go ahead and manually re-add these. Sorry about that\n. Having a little trouble understanding the issue on this one - if you could provide a little more context I might be able to help more.\n. what is the error you are getting?\n. Could this be implemented as a plugin? I assume you want these handlers to act on URIs in messages. Example of a plugin: https://gist.github.com/thedjpetersen/9140203\n. Ah ok I think I understand a little better now. This is something I would consider as a pull request more than an issue - handling the query string parameters could be a little tricky.\nClosing for now.\n. This is fixed in the refactor branch which will be the source of future development. Thanks for the pull request - sorry the work wasn't included.\n. Neat project - but right now outside the scope of subway. I would probably reconsider if this was brought back as a pull request.\n. hermansc - try to catch me on irc where we can flesh this out a little bit more and then maybe circle back to comment here\nnote this is the idea of the settings/server.js settings/client.js files\n. Since we all seem to be in agreement about this - we'll close this issue. If there is a specific thing you want added - that can be opened as a seperate issue.\n. Looks like this is related to somehow having a bad session cookie - the fix should just be testing whether or not the user is defined.\n. Fixed with last push\n. Any other Linux users able to repro this? It seems to work fine for me on Mac.\n. I think the problem he is having @totokaka is that it doesn't go away even when there is no where to scroll.\n. I was able to fix the jumping up bug - it happens when you are embedding image/youtube. That is unrelated.\n. Should be fixed now\n. This is another tough one to repro. This happened I believe when two users were simultaneously connected to the same room? \n. Note: This is when two logged in users are connected - it happens to one of the logged in users\n. Can you provide any more context I am having a little trouble repro-ing?\n. Should now be resolved \n. You can do this right now in the settings - you can select what types of messages you want to see\n. It should be saving your settings everytime you make a change something.\nSee here: https://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway/blob/refactor/src/components/settings/general.jsx#L33\n. This is implemented for different highlights. See here: https://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway/blob/refactor/src/js/boilerplate.js#L124\n. ah I understand - there isn't currently a way to do this. Do you think this justifies a notification? \n. This is the line that is failing: https://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway/blob/refactor/src/components/settings/general.jsx#L33\n. I would love to dig into this more, but this error message/description is just to brief to reproduce more. Was this happening after you disconnected and refreshed? I'll go ahead and close this - feel free to reopen if you have more info.\n. Most likely related to a bug with kicking users - leaving this open a bit to see if it crops up again for me\n. Hi Wilfried!\nUntil the client is really finished there is a target date for distributing Subway other than with github and eventually npm.\n. So locally I am able to join a channel named '#' using the tip of master\n. Could you retest please?\n. Dupe of #152 \n. Is there any documentation on this standard?\n. the package.json standard - I am just wondering why you need the 'js' extension\n. ah ok I found it https://www.npmjs.org/doc/files/package.json.html\n. A bit out of the scope of this project\n. A little tough to read the diff - what is this changing besides removing jQuery?\n. OK great! Just one little stylistic thing and this should be good to merge. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. What is the error you are getting? Did you install the dependencies?\n. Great! So it looks like you started the chat client correctly. To connect to freenode you type the following into the connect form:\nirc.freenode.net\n  Abc_123\nThen push \"connect\" - after you have connected to join the node.js channel you just type in \"/join #node.js\"\nHope that works for you!\n. Interesting - this feature is not in subway yet please refer to issue #152 \n. @Elmit2015 just a heads up this just landed in the tip of master - you can now set default channel/nick for users\n. no your config is correct this looks like it is definitely a bug\n. @abruzzihraig I am having quite a bit of trouble reproducing usually this is related to earlier activity could you paste a longer log of the irc activity before this broke?\n. If you create a user and then are logged in with the user it will log messages. Otherwise it doesn't. \n. Just a quick note - user persistence though is not working very well atm check some of the more recent issues. It may not be a bad idea to check out 'shout'.\n. @hrj probably not going to write a guide. Too busy working on the stability of the client. If you wanted to open a pull request with a doc in the support folder I would give it a good look.\n. Did you say this was after a connection reset? It looks like you somehow stayed on a channel after you were disconnected\n. I'm down with this\n. ",
    "akavlie": "Tried it, min-width doesn't seem to work here.\nMethinks fluid layout everywhere is problematic.\n. I like it as well. A shorter scroll time will help a bit, but won't really solve the underlying problem for motd -- we're getting a flood of individual events for every line, rather than a single scroll event for the whole thing. May be able to solve this with some logic.\n. Looking at campfire screenshots... yeah, that's not bad as an inspiration (without directly copying). It's sensible, but not necessarily attractive.\n. Those two dribble shots are pretty good; I like quite a few aspects of those (but not everything). Moreso the Skype chat example than the other.\n. btw, I have a decent solution for the JS resizing on window resize in web-irc.\n. I think the chat contents should resize fluidly, but most other elements would be better off with fixed sizing.\n. Yes and no... the sidebar needs a minimum width to show the logo, as well as channel names and unread counts.\n. I just tested it out, and it starts cutting off when the window is about 645px wide. Granted, that's narrower than users would typically be sizing their browser windows (other than on mobile).\n. If you don't have any objections, I think I'll try a version of the layout without percentage sizing, and port my window resizing code from web-irc.\n. any thoughts?\n. Changed top bars & input to be fixed height with absolute positioning. I think the fluid sizing can cause issues at very small horizontal sizes as well, but that's a relatively minor issue, and not likely to occur with normal usage.\n. ACTION input is supported in node-irc, but not events (for output). There's an outstanding pull request to add support:\nhttps://github.com/martynsmith/node-irc/pull/58\nI'll bug Martyn about it if he doesn't get around to it soon.\n. Asked Martyn about this one via email.\n. I only see support for sending a /me message (the easy case). Did you do anything with incoming messages? That's a bit trickier.\nMay code it in if the code isn't merged into node-irc soon, but looking for events from node-irc would make for simpler and more consistent code.\n. Why pull requests? Are you working off of a fork somewhere?\n. Ah, OK. Didn't realize you could do pull requests from/to one and the same repository.\nI'll look it over.\n. as in, \"incorrect server address\".\nWill ask Martyn if a new release is coming.\n. I don't think so; the failure is up in node.js somewhere because an error\nevent isn't defined. I'm not sure it's possible to do a try/catch block\nwithin our code to deal with that.\nThe fix is already in node-irc; we can wait for the new version on npm or\npoint our packages to github if there isn't a new version soon.\nOn Thu, Jan 12, 2012 at 11:28 PM, David Petersen <\nreply@reply.github.com\n\nwrote:\nCould we put this in a try catch block?\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway/issues/16#issuecomment-3476118\n\n\nfreelance web development\naaron.kavlie.net\n. Taken care of since resetting the dependency to github master branch for node-irc.\n. Done -- moved into ChatView\n. Added support for /part command. Don't yet have a graphic.\nIf I add that, it will be a lame placeholder until @thedjpetersen does it right  ;-)\n. Think the chat window model/view also need to be removed.\n. You're going to design a new logo?? Saying that that will come before X buttons on tabs or something? I'm confused...\nFor active channel after parting, I'm setting it to the previous one in the list, unless that's status. Some variation of \"nearest tab\" seems more sensible than last tab -- most tab UIs will do nearest to left or right.\n. Added in x buttons.\n. That's trivial with the :hover pesudo-class\nhttp://reference.sitepoint.com/css/pseudoclass-hover\nI'll leave this to you, if you want to take a stab at it... I want to investigate Backbone 0.9 issues. LMK if you have questions.\n. Done -- see my pull request.\n. are you seeing a lot of CPU consumption from that feature?\n. Pull request submitted.\n. Added count in title. Needs two things:\n- Get rid of (0) when no unread messages\n- Count all unread private messages, even if it's not a mention\nThese are both done.\n. One more thing: even for the active tab, messages should not be counted as read if the window is out of focus.\nThere ought to be a way to detect window focus with JS... I hope.\n. Sounds are now in.\nTwo more features remain:\n- Don't mark read when window is not in focus\n- Try desktop notifications\n. One issue: sound fires for a new private chat, even if I start it. This shouldn't happen.\nUpdate: fixed.\nFor marking read when in focus, there's a new browser API for that sort of thing -- it's in Chrome, and just added to Firefox with FF10.\n. Just did a little exeriment with document.mozHidden. Turns out this doesn't work as expected -- it continues to return false if you focus on other windows and such. It only returns true if you change browser tabs.\n. Messages are now considered unread if window is not in focus.\nI'll consider this implemented no. Desktop notifications are still only in Chrome; may revisit those again if at least Firefox also gets support. Besides, those are more tricky -- they would be annoying if overdone.\n. Pull request submitted.\n. We've got the dependency switched, and the backend is supporting this. Have a console.log statement dumping the error object when a connection failure happens (errno ENOTFOUND). The remaining task is translating that, and any other error states, into a good error message for the end user.\nA Twitter Bootstrap alert would be nice here.\n. @thedjpetersen Did you want to try some custom alert style here? Or shall I just put in a twitter bootstrap alert message?\n. @thedjpetersen Is this resolved with commit d84f?\n. Works for me now, maybe was just broken in the middle of my refactoring... shrug\n. In addition to / rather than autocomplete on typing, a dropdown/select menu would be nice.\n. The userlist regressions are odd. Do you think the work that I did last night caused that?\n. Done. Also upgraded underscore to 1.3.1 (a necessary prereq for Backbone 0.9.0).\n. Seems that references to this.$() elements are broken in Backbone 0.9.0 for some reason.\nReverted to 0.5.3 in master, and created a separate branch for testing 0.9.0.\n. After using setElement() and wrapping chat template, it works.\nThe former method of assigning this.el to the chat template happened to work, but it's evident that Backbone wasn't designed with that in mind -- it should be a single element, whereas the former chat template had two root elements.\n.

Thanks!\n. beberlei,\nI've looked into CouchDB a bit recently, but never worked with it. What would be the advantage (for the user) to a separate individual database? And where would the average user set one up? If it requires hosting your own Couch instance on your own server, the audience for that would be pretty small.\nAlso, consider that the unified DB model does bring with it one big advantage: you can see channel history even when you're not present in the channel.\n. Ah, cool.\nI kinda like the idea, but I'm not sure there's a significant benefit to most users. At least when you consider the time investment vs. other issues.\nThe biggest upside I see is that it alleviates resource/disk capacity stress on a single server. But otoh, it also makes the shared channel logging impossible.\n. I'm gonna go ahead and pin down the packages.json to the version I have running locally. On NodeUp one of the devs said he spent hours tracking down a bug that was due to a dependency version difference. That doesn't sound like my idea of fun.\n. done\n. I think it's an issue related to IMEs (Input Method Editors) for languages like Chinese & Japanese. I've used them before.\nI'll test this one out.\n. In an IME, keyboard input initially enters a middle state, where characters are auto-converted to kanji, etc. based on the IME's best guess at the words you intend. You make modifications, then typically press enter to confirm that string. After that, enter can be used as usual for the text field.\n. thanks!\n. Derek,\nI'm on Chrome 17, though on a Mac. May be a platform-specific bug, or maybe it's cropping up in specific circumstances.\nAre you able to test a bit under Firefox, and try some different scenarios, so we can narrow down what's causing this?\n. Yes, the idea is that even if the tab is focused, it should be treated as if it's inactive as soon as the user blurs the window (to use another app etc.) so that new message notifications would be seen/heard.\n. And the reason for the timer is that blur is fired even if the user clicks on browser chrome (like the location bar), and I wanted to avoid it firing on quick switches to things like that. It might make sense to extend it a bit.\n. I remember now... it's working as intended.\nThe intended behavior was that we would notify the user of unread PMs + unread mentions. I figured that titlebar notifications for all unread messages would be a little too intrusive... I view that (and the sounds we have) similar to new mail notifications -- they signify messages aimed at you.\nWhat sort of behavior would be ideal to you?\n. OK cool, we'll stick with what we've got for now then.  :-)\n. @bitemyapp What browser/version/OS are you on?\n. Well that rules out browser differences as the cause then. Same OS/browser here.\n. This could be related:\nhttps://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway/blob/master/assets/js/collections.js#L37\n@bitemyapp does it seem to trigger by certain actions (focus on another app, add/remove channels, new private message, etc.), or does it seem to happen randomly mid-conversation?\n. Should surface this error in the UI. I'll look into it.\n. Thanks for working on this. Just tried it out locally, it seems to work just fine. No clues about the SSL status in the app or logs though... it would help if we added something.\nOne issue I have, that should be rectified before we merge this into master: the UI has a blank input for the port, implying that the field requires input... there's no hint that it will supply the correct port if you leave it blank. I'd like to see that change so the port is pre-filled (and switches automatically when you check/uncheck SSL).\nAnother request: I think the port input and SSL checkbox should be combined onto the same line in the UI, as the port field doesn't need that much space. Should be easy with .form-inline: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/base-css.html#forms\n. Pushed a minimal solution to this. All it does it throw an alert box.\nMuch more could be done to improve the UI and handling of a disconnect, so I'll leave this open.\n. Some ideas for more elegant notification of a disconnect:\n- Show red Bootstrap alert within/above chat window (should remain in place even if user switches chat windows)\n- Fade out chat text\n- Attempt/offer to auto-reconnect; if user declines, return to connect dialog.\n. Tried it, min-width doesn't seem to work here.\nMethinks fluid layout everywhere is problematic.\n. I like it as well. A shorter scroll time will help a bit, but won't really solve the underlying problem for motd -- we're getting a flood of individual events for every line, rather than a single scroll event for the whole thing. May be able to solve this with some logic.\n. Looking at campfire screenshots... yeah, that's not bad as an inspiration (without directly copying). It's sensible, but not necessarily attractive.\n. Those two dribble shots are pretty good; I like quite a few aspects of those (but not everything). Moreso the Skype chat example than the other.\n. btw, I have a decent solution for the JS resizing on window resize in web-irc.\n. I think the chat contents should resize fluidly, but most other elements would be better off with fixed sizing.\n. Yes and no... the sidebar needs a minimum width to show the logo, as well as channel names and unread counts.\n. I just tested it out, and it starts cutting off when the window is about 645px wide. Granted, that's narrower than users would typically be sizing their browser windows (other than on mobile).\n. If you don't have any objections, I think I'll try a version of the layout without percentage sizing, and port my window resizing code from web-irc.\n. any thoughts?\n. Changed top bars & input to be fixed height with absolute positioning. I think the fluid sizing can cause issues at very small horizontal sizes as well, but that's a relatively minor issue, and not likely to occur with normal usage.\n. ACTION input is supported in node-irc, but not events (for output). There's an outstanding pull request to add support:\nhttps://github.com/martynsmith/node-irc/pull/58\nI'll bug Martyn about it if he doesn't get around to it soon.\n. Asked Martyn about this one via email.\n. I only see support for sending a /me message (the easy case). Did you do anything with incoming messages? That's a bit trickier.\nMay code it in if the code isn't merged into node-irc soon, but looking for events from node-irc would make for simpler and more consistent code.\n. Why pull requests? Are you working off of a fork somewhere?\n. Ah, OK. Didn't realize you could do pull requests from/to one and the same repository.\nI'll look it over.\n. as in, \"incorrect server address\".\nWill ask Martyn if a new release is coming.\n. I don't think so; the failure is up in node.js somewhere because an error\nevent isn't defined. I'm not sure it's possible to do a try/catch block\nwithin our code to deal with that.\nThe fix is already in node-irc; we can wait for the new version on npm or\npoint our packages to github if there isn't a new version soon.\nOn Thu, Jan 12, 2012 at 11:28 PM, David Petersen <\nreply@reply.github.com\n\nwrote:\nCould we put this in a try catch block?\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway/issues/16#issuecomment-3476118\n\n\nfreelance web development\naaron.kavlie.net\n. Taken care of since resetting the dependency to github master branch for node-irc.\n. Done -- moved into ChatView\n. Added support for /part command. Don't yet have a graphic.\nIf I add that, it will be a lame placeholder until @thedjpetersen does it right  ;-)\n. Think the chat window model/view also need to be removed.\n. You're going to design a new logo?? Saying that that will come before X buttons on tabs or something? I'm confused...\nFor active channel after parting, I'm setting it to the previous one in the list, unless that's status. Some variation of \"nearest tab\" seems more sensible than last tab -- most tab UIs will do nearest to left or right.\n. Added in x buttons.\n. That's trivial with the :hover pesudo-class\nhttp://reference.sitepoint.com/css/pseudoclass-hover\nI'll leave this to you, if you want to take a stab at it... I want to investigate Backbone 0.9 issues. LMK if you have questions.\n. Done -- see my pull request.\n. are you seeing a lot of CPU consumption from that feature?\n. Pull request submitted.\n. Added count in title. Needs two things:\n- Get rid of (0) when no unread messages\n- Count all unread private messages, even if it's not a mention\nThese are both done.\n. One more thing: even for the active tab, messages should not be counted as read if the window is out of focus.\nThere ought to be a way to detect window focus with JS... I hope.\n. Sounds are now in.\nTwo more features remain:\n- Don't mark read when window is not in focus\n- Try desktop notifications\n. One issue: sound fires for a new private chat, even if I start it. This shouldn't happen.\nUpdate: fixed.\nFor marking read when in focus, there's a new browser API for that sort of thing -- it's in Chrome, and just added to Firefox with FF10.\n. Just did a little exeriment with document.mozHidden. Turns out this doesn't work as expected -- it continues to return false if you focus on other windows and such. It only returns true if you change browser tabs.\n. Messages are now considered unread if window is not in focus.\nI'll consider this implemented no. Desktop notifications are still only in Chrome; may revisit those again if at least Firefox also gets support. Besides, those are more tricky -- they would be annoying if overdone.\n. Pull request submitted.\n. We've got the dependency switched, and the backend is supporting this. Have a console.log statement dumping the error object when a connection failure happens (errno ENOTFOUND). The remaining task is translating that, and any other error states, into a good error message for the end user.\nA Twitter Bootstrap alert would be nice here.\n. @thedjpetersen Did you want to try some custom alert style here? Or shall I just put in a twitter bootstrap alert message?\n. @thedjpetersen Is this resolved with commit d84f?\n. Works for me now, maybe was just broken in the middle of my refactoring... shrug\n. In addition to / rather than autocomplete on typing, a dropdown/select menu would be nice.\n. The userlist regressions are odd. Do you think the work that I did last night caused that?\n. Done. Also upgraded underscore to 1.3.1 (a necessary prereq for Backbone 0.9.0).\n. Seems that references to this.$() elements are broken in Backbone 0.9.0 for some reason.\nReverted to 0.5.3 in master, and created a separate branch for testing 0.9.0.\n. After using setElement() and wrapping chat template, it works.\nThe former method of assigning this.el to the chat template happened to work, but it's evident that Backbone wasn't designed with that in mind -- it should be a single element, whereas the former chat template had two root elements.\n. Closest possible match to what? Would the user specify a nick for their friend when they get the link?\n. Yeah, that part I got. But the \"closest possible match for that username\" part is a little odd.

I guess the Node IRC library is just being safe by default. I haven't looked at the irc module's code in depth, but if passing selfSigned as true for all connections doesn't cause a complaint against a properly SSL'd server, then Subway is no worse than i.e. Colloquy or irssi.\nIt might be nice to warn the user when connecting to a server that uses a self-signed cert, in case they are particularly security conscious.

Looking into it a bit myself.\nFWIW, the messages are going into the database just fine, but reconnecting on the client side still shows messages in the mangled format once it reaches the client.\nEDIT: Actually, I take that back. Working with two separate Subway users talking to each other in chat, a mangled message received by one user goes into the DB linked to that user with the message mangled. The Subway user that sent the message has the original text show up in the DB correctly.\n. Actually I'm 99% sure this is a node-irc bug now.

Not seeing anything in the logs, and I'm not really familiar with setting up node.js apps on heroku. \n. Ah it appears I wasn't specifying the right NODE_ENV. Still getting the same problem though.\n. @SpenserJ Well, I just learned that apparently websockets don't work on heroku at all. https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/using-socket-io-with-node-js-on-heroku\nCurrently trying to get it to use the long-polling.... \n. Tried that, still seems to be trying to use the websocket on heroku. Locally, I can tell its using the long polling.\nhttps://github.com/mcfiredrill/subway-demo/commit/10422e391b77808b0ea34e7ea0b543bec4885f2d#L0R39\n. Thanks to fauntle on irc I was able to get this working! It was trying to add a port number to the url, causing the initial request to socket.io to fail. I specified no port in io.connect and its working now.\nhttps://github.com/mcfiredrill/subway-demo/commit/9d8fd4586a387f9465830eb764f9a4a4361a7871\n. :+1: :+1: :+1: :+1: :+1: :+1: \n.

So that one can easily distribute sent messages to several channels. \n. Fixed in #299 , if it gets merged into master.\n. This is fixed when #296 is merged into master, I guess. \n. I've been looking on the following implementation of a sidebar:\nhttp://startbootstrap.com/templates/simple-sidebar.html\nWorks pretty good actually, the problem however is that I'm not able to create fixed elements inside the content area, at least not with my average CSS-skills. In fact we probably want two sidebars, one on each side: left one for channels and right ones for userlist. Then a responsive stylesheet that just hides/show them at given widths with a toggle-button as the site provided above has.\nIf anyone want to take a look at my code for upgrading to bootstrap 3 and in the same time enabling scrollable sidebar/content-view, please see my branch which is very much half-working and not done:\nhttps://github.com/hermansc/subway/commit/1b975a88af8223c7316552e0fab4f08230eafd50\nTry comparing the layout in my commit, with the current layout, by re-sizing the window etc. Hopefully, with the \"new\" layout, which uses the principle of the sidebar-example given above, should be more deterministic and fluid.\nCheers. \n. Hm, perhaps just use the unicode symbol BLACK CIRCLE (25CF) which looks like \u25cf and then finding a good font-size and set the text-color property on the span surrounding the circle?\nThat is: <span style=\"text-color:orange;font-size:14px\" title=\"Inactive\">\u25cf</span>\n. We probably just want to use Glyphicons included in the Bootstrap. E.g. icon-comment or even better icon-envelope. See:  http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/base-css.html#icons\n. Hm. Anyone here with plugin experience using Javascript? I feel we perhaps just create a separate issue where we discuss architectural designs in regards to them?\nDid you ever manage to extract the youtube/image parsing into a separate file/plugin based setup, @thedjpetersen ? :-)\n. So current situation is, as you say, the auto-completion works fine first time and second time, but then does not \"loop\" back to the first name again.\nExpected behavior should be: al -> (tab) -> alice -> (tab) -> alice2 -> (tab) -> alice -> (tab) -> alice2 -> ...\nHowever currently we have: al -> (tab) -> alice -> (tab) -> alice2 -> (tab) -> alice2 -> (tab) -> alice2 -> ...\nDefinitely a bug which should be fixed.\n.

Perhaps we should close this and continue the discussion there?\n. How would this work? You mean highlighting all op's in a channel at the same time?

It would definitely be great supporting XMPP (and being the best web-based chat client out there), but personally I'd like to see Subway manage the IRC-protocol flawlessly first. Then at sometime in the future when the project is larger and more mature, look into extending with other protocols.\nAny thoughts from others?\n. Is this still an issue? I guess a new version of Ubuntu has been released since the creation of this issue. For the record I successfully installed node and subway's needed packages on Debian Jessie (testing) with the following commands:\n$ sudo apt-get install nodejs npm\n$ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node\n$ npm install\nNode.js is not in wheezy (stable), but you can fetch it from wheezy-backports:\n$ sudo echo \"deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian wheezy-backports main contrib non-free\" >> /etc/apt/sources.list\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get install -t wheezy-backports nodejs\n$ curl https://www.npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo sh\n$ npm install\nI haven't tested the last one though (wheezy install).\n. Agreed. First sort on role, then alphabetically. Currently we sort by last active, which is kind of weird and non-deterministic. Should be \"simple\" enough to fix, backbone.js has some functions for sorting strategies: http://stackoverflow.com/a/9865920.\nSo I guess creating a comparator function is assets/js/collections.js for the UserList collection and call sort() at some point?\n. @thedjpetersen you want to look into this? If it is just hitting npm publish then I guess anyone can upload to npmjs, but perhaps it should be the maintainer?\n. Would be simpler to pin-point this bug if some more details were added. Could you add some steps to replicate this bug? Possibly it is related to #265 or private conversations in general, which is a bit buggy atm.\n. As the sidebar does not resize itself at the moment, a mobile experience of Subway is currently pretty bad, imo.\nPerhaps it would be easier to fix using Bootstrap 3.1.1 and a responsive grid (issue #301), but it's definitively not impossible to fix at current stage as well.\n. Hi. Thanks for your bug report. I'm not able to replicate this issue, could you verify that it is still happening and give any more details on how you experienced this? Please see the following screenshot for my experience changing nick:\n\n. Agreed and this is actually a duplicate of #270 . Hence I'll close this one and we'll continue our discussion in that issue. In regards of the icons they are a good idea, and should perhaps be added as separate issue?\n. This issue is a duplicate of #244 .\nUntil #292 is done and we have plugin support I propose a setting per user (such as we do with desktop notifications). As to implementation we could just have an array of 10 colors and then use the following snippet from nickcolor.pl:\nforeach my $char (@chars) {\n    $counter += ord $char;\n}\n$counter = $colors[$counter % 11];\nThat is we accumulate the ascii-values for each char in the different nicks, take mod 11 (or as many colors that we have) and voil\u00e0 an even distribution of colors.\n. @totokaka ah, you are right and this is of course not a duplicate. Sorry.\n. So we actually have two issues in this one:\n1. Displaying colors in Subway works fine for foreground-colors but background colors are added as a border, instead of background-color. See irc-colors.css. Replicate by typing Ctrl-c3,1Hello World where Ctrl-c is the actual control character, in a irc-client such as irssi. Should be green on black background, but rather one obtains green text with dotted black border.\n2. It is not possible to add foreground or background colors, using Subway.\n. How will this affect future commits and pull-requests to the master branch?\n. A great idea and nice implementation! I love the focus on making subway more accessible to non-technical people. \nI have a question though with regards to the presets.password variable and its meaning? I mean, it is obviously not referring to a channel password - since one can preset multiple channels? And we don't want to preset user-password either, now do we? :-)\nAlso, when we are talking about passwords. It is not possible to preset a channel with a password - or it is possible if one writes channels: [\"#channelname password\", \"#anotherchannel foobar\"], but perhaps a solution such as: \nchannels: [{ name: \"#channelname\", password: \"password\"}, {name: \"#anotherchannel\", password: \"\"}]\nis better?\n. Hey, no problem, nice to see people contributing to this project. As I said, I know it will work writing it #channel password, I just thought it would perhaps be more verbose and clearer if one separated them and did the join in the background. But, as you say there is perhaps not much point in it :-)\n. @harishbsrinivas : You could always just do it in the (Sqlite3) database directly, if you have access to it.\nLets say you call it subway.db in config.js, then:\n$ sqlite3 subway.db\nsqlite> UPDATE User SET password = 'foobar' WHERE username = 'zomg';\nAnd voil\u00e0. But as thedjpetersen says, there are no way to do this as of yet in the UI.\n. I'm closing this one, and I'll re-open the original one.\n. I support this. Don't think we necessarily should differentiate between two different users, but rather strive to have a configurable application where you can limit IRC-servers/channels, disable user-profiles/plugins and support external authentication systems, such as Kerberos.\n. Heh, this seemed pretty random. I have not experienced it lately. Anyone care to look into this, or should we just close it?\n. Kind of related to #302 .

Thanks @nrn!\n. @thedjpetersen @BYK How will the users set a different port for the client?\nFor example, will I not be able anymore to run subway on heroku with this patch?\nIf not, can we use another approach to solve our issue?\n. Is'nt it possible to support Dokku and support people who can't use websockets as well?\nI am totally into supporting a new infrasctructure provider, but removing support for another or the fallback for websockets, as a consequence, does not seem a good idea.\nAlso, this would revert #226 too.\n. So it is ok for me. :+1:\n. @totokaka Displaying colors is possible, what specifically do you have in mind?\n. Take a look at this: https://github.com/badosu/ircparser.js\nIt is a project I made to support colors on subway.\nIt should be working as you intend, maybe the configuration option is not set?\n. @hermansc The idea behind using a colored border instead of a background color was to not mess with the screen.\nBut as you pointed out, you just need to change irc-colors.css.\n. @totokaka Hmmm, this makes sense.\nIs it possible that recovered messages are not rendered here: https://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway/blob/master/assets/js/views/message.js#L30-L32?\n. This should provide some context: https://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway/commit/66f7aefa784adba7d1e57cd810a4658ef0014705\n. @hermansc This is probably not related to #244, only if users can set color codes on /nick.\nBut even then, they are totally orthogonal features.\nI can probably fix one of both issues, but I want to know if I should wait for the refactor.\n. @thedjpetersen This issue is probably outdated now as I assume you probably changed the color highlighting plugin.\nAnyway, to reproduce the scrollback thing would be to receive a colorized message, log out and log in again and check whether the message is still colorized.\n. Really really good job @thedjpetersen!\nKnow if the plugin api is already defined? Would care to explain how it works, if so?\nI am thinking in cleaning: https://github.com/badosu/subway/blob/master/assets/js/views/message.js#L30-32\n. Cool! Thanks!\n. Wow, this is quite awesome!! Thanks!!\n. This is nice!\nI am just not sure of which config should have priority the env vars or the file config /cc @thedjpetersen @hermansc \n.

Thanks!\n. @lukske123 are you running as root?\nIs this the output of npm install?\n. @lukske123 Nice!\nSo this issue is not related to subway, right?\nCan you close it?\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Hello @LordWingZero, @Myster62 !\nHow are you installing? Could you copy and paste the commands here?\nWhich platforms do you use?\nThanks for the report!\n. Cool! Thanks @LordWingZero!\n. Thanks @nrn!\n. @thedjpetersen @BYK How will the users set a different port for the client?\nFor example, will I not be able anymore to run subway on heroku with this patch?\nIf not, can we use another approach to solve our issue?\n. Is'nt it possible to support Dokku and support people who can't use websockets as well?\nI am totally into supporting a new infrasctructure provider, but removing support for another or the fallback for websockets, as a consequence, does not seem a good idea.\nAlso, this would revert #226 too.\n. So it is ok for me. :+1:\n. @totokaka Displaying colors is possible, what specifically do you have in mind?\n. Take a look at this: https://github.com/badosu/ircparser.js\nIt is a project I made to support colors on subway.\nIt should be working as you intend, maybe the configuration option is not set?\n. @hermansc The idea behind using a colored border instead of a background color was to not mess with the screen.\nBut as you pointed out, you just need to change irc-colors.css.\n. @totokaka Hmmm, this makes sense.\nIs it possible that recovered messages are not rendered here: https://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway/blob/master/assets/js/views/message.js#L30-L32?\n. This should provide some context: https://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway/commit/66f7aefa784adba7d1e57cd810a4658ef0014705\n. @hermansc This is probably not related to #244, only if users can set color codes on /nick.\nBut even then, they are totally orthogonal features.\nI can probably fix one of both issues, but I want to know if I should wait for the refactor.\n. @thedjpetersen This issue is probably outdated now as I assume you probably changed the color highlighting plugin.\nAnyway, to reproduce the scrollback thing would be to receive a colorized message, log out and log in again and check whether the message is still colorized.\n. Really really good job @thedjpetersen!\nKnow if the plugin api is already defined? Would care to explain how it works, if so?\nI am thinking in cleaning: https://github.com/badosu/subway/blob/master/assets/js/views/message.js#L30-32\n. Cool! Thanks!\n. Wow, this is quite awesome!! Thanks!!\n. This is nice!\nI am just not sure of which config should have priority the env vars or the file config /cc @thedjpetersen @hermansc \n. Awesome!\nMaybe you could write a simple wiki page about how to use your scripts?\nSomething like https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/blob/3-2-stable/doc/installation.md but simpler?\n. Maybe a markdown file at support/README.md?\n. :+1: /cc @thedjpetersen \n. Thanks!!\n. ",

Hi there,\nI worked on this and just uploaded a pull request. Check please.\n. Sure! I'll be very appreciated if you add me as a contributor.\nAbout nodejitsu link, yes, It's okay to link, but I can't assure that the app'll be on continuously because jitsu's price plan'll start in the next month and i'm not sure i'd maintain the app if I have to pay for it.\nBy the way, there's already the app named 'subway' in nodejitsu.

See: http://fb.me/react-legacyfactory\nWarning: React.renderComponent will be deprecated in a future version. Use React.render instead.\nEach child in an array should have a unique \"key\" prop. Check the renderComponent call using <undefined>. See http://fb.me/react-warning-keys for more information.\n. I was able to manage most of the installation issues in OpenShift.\n\nBut I got stuck at one place where bower is getting called when subway is running. This doesn't work well because bower requires write access to directories which are not permitted in OpenShift.
