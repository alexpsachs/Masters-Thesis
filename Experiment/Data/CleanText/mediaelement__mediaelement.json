    "johndyer": "Good call. I'll work on adding those.\n. Done.\n. Thanks. I have that as a note in my code to do.\n. Fixed\n. Your code looks great. \nSilverlight 1 and 2 can't play H.264 to my knowledge, so I needed to use at least 3.0. What media types were you attempting to support in Silverlight?\n. Makes sense. Mac and PC users say that H.264 performance is better on Silverlight and it's more stable for them. Also, MP3 playback is much more straightforward in Silverlight than Flash. I guess I could have two versions of Silverlight (v2 for WMV and v3 for mp4).\n. I've bumped it down to SL 3.0, but I'll have to get an older version of VS to include SL 2.0 for Linux. Perhaps Moonlight will help?\n. I'm pretty new to Silverlight so I just used the .NET language knew best: C#. \nI do have a fullscreen button in addition to the main media object.\n. Well I guess this means that WMV won't work on Linux.\n. Interesting idea. I'll check it out. I wonder if it's true for Silverlight as well.\n. I did this for both and it seemed to improve playback. Thanks!\n. John, could you tell me which version of Opera and Flash you have?\n. Also, is that on a Mac or PC?\n. give it another shot now.\n. What happens if you upgrade to 10.1?\n. Thanks john. I was actually wondering if Flash 10.0 vs 10.1 was the culprit. Sounds like it might be a problem with Opera itself. Those are the hardest, nastiest kinds!\n. I believe this should be fixed in the next release because we do some double checking and default sizing.\n. Lee,\nI'm guessing that's not a type that Safari supports natively, and I don't know that Flash or Silverlight will play it either. You could try adding it under the mediaelement.js types and see if Flash can play it.\n. I added audio/mp4 and audio/m4a to the list of supported types and it seemed to work well in both Silverlight and Flash. Give it a shot and let me know how it goes.\n. Thanks. I'm getting some additional reports that Mac/Opera is having problem, so I'm looking into it.\n. Should be working now.\n. Thanks for this. I'm still working on getting my IE6 and IE7 testing down.\n. Fixed.\n. Yep, I need to do some checking to make sure the Flash audio code is right.\n. Should be fixed now.\n. Thanks for catching that.\n. Fixed again.\n. Thanks. I'll check on the ended events for Flash.\n. For the Flash and Silverlight version detection, I borrowed from SwfObject and Microsoft's Silverlight code respectively. That part of the code can be easily replaced, so if you know of a good detection routine for either, I'm up for swapping it out.\n. Removed. Thanks!\n. Yes, the Wiki contains a list of properties and events that you can use. Also looking at mediaelementplayer.js will show you how I used them for the player.\n. Fixed\n. I've removed this from mediaelements.js because the HTML5 spec does not define a stop()  method: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/video.html#playing-the-media-resource\n. Fixed.\n. Do you know what browser/plugin combo you're using? Flash doesn't always report this correctly.\n. I've added a work around for when Flash doesn't correct report the ending. I'll upload it tomorrow (1.0.2).\n. I don't see the red x. but it also looks like  your video.js file does not correctly handle the $ function.\n. You video.js file is setup to execute immediately. This means that it attempts to look for  tags before they've loaded. You should change the file to \njQuery(document).ready(function($) {\n    $('video').mediaelementplayer();\n});\nThis will ensure that the code fires only after the page has loaded.\n. I just checked your site again and it looks like you have an old version of jQuery (1.4). If you grab 1.4.2 (or just link to the Google hosted version at http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js), it'll work great. I'd also recommend grabbing the latest mediaelement.js file.\n. I'll check it out.\n. My PC Safari can play it with HTML5, so I'm only seeing the problem in Flash. So far, I can't find any way to make Flash go past 2 seconds, even though it seems to know the clip is longer\n. Matt,\nI've been looking at this again, and I can't seem to find anything in Flash to change. The 1pixelout player is Actionscript 2.0, and MEjs is 3.0 so there might be some differences in Flash. But basically, Flash is just stopping without any notice or report.\nHere's the most basic Flash code to play a sound file:\nvar sound:Sound = new Sound();\n        sound.load(new URLRequest(\"message.mp3\"));\n        var sc:SoundChannel = sound.play();\nAnd even that fails, so I think this might be a problem with Flash AS3 processing that file. I even tried adding some code to watch for a premature end and then try to restart it a few milliseconds later, but there are other places in the file where it stops as well.\nSo, I've got to close one and say it's a bug in Flash. (there's always Silverlight!)\n. Could you give me an example file you're trying to use?\n. So this is a stream that Flash understands, but HTML5 doesn't. I'm not sure what streaming systems HTML5 understands, so I'm not sure what to do.\nBut, yes it would be nice to specify a \"forcePlugin: 'flash'\" parameter so you can use this.\n. The native HTML5 spec doesn't have any way to do this. You have to manually set based on canPlayType. But I could override out setSrc() method to take an array and then attempt to figure it out based on extension. I'll get that a build next week.\n. Sorry for the delay on this one. I'm working on it now.\n. This is now included. Let me know how it works for you.\n. I haven't looked into it much. Do you have any good articles on the technology?\n. What kind of streaming audio?\n. It already supports MP3 as well as WMA via silverlight.\n. I'll put together an example soon. But it should look something like \n<audio src=\"myfile.wma\" type=\"audio/wma\"></audio>\n<audio src=\"myfile.mp3\" type=\"audio/mp3\"></audio>\n<script>\njQuery('audio').mediaelementplayer();\n\nAlso, you should open up a new ticket since this is unrelated to the original question.\n. Thanks Matt! Let me know how your skin turned out and if you think any changes in controls markup would be helpful for expanded skin support. I'd like to update the main skin and offer some others.\n. My Samsung S still doesn't have an Android 2.2 update available so I'm having trouble testing it. Is yours using Flash or native ?\n. The 2.2 update is now ready for my Android handset. I'll update it and see what I find. Perhaps it will help the 2 sec mp3 bug from Old Spice as well.\n. Yagraph,\nI just added some code to all the player to do two things (1) it won't stretch your video, but will instead have black bars. (2) it can also dynamically resize the Flash window to the native size of the video. which would you prefer?\n. This is now updated and it should show up in Wordpress shortly.\n. So you still want the rest of the controls like play/pause and the progress bar right, just not the duration? And then you also want a looping feature?\nI'm guessing I need to add options like this in JavaScript, and then replicate them in Wordpress:\n    {\n        loop: true,\n        controls: {play: true, progressBar: true, duration: true, volume:true}\n    }\nWould that cover what you need?\n. This is now in the core player, and I'll add them to Wordpress soon.\n. This is now in the Wordpress shortcode\n[audio src=\"myfile.mp3\" duration=\"false\"]\n. Actually, if a user doesn't have Flash or Silverlight, the behavior is to show a link to download the file. See mediaelement.js around line 462. Is that what you are looking for?\n. Any chance your player is inside a [form] tag?\n. I've seen this before when I use ASP.NET (which usually has a [form] tag around everything). So document.getElementById() works pretty well both inside and outside the [form] tag?\n. Okay, I'll check it out. I'm right in the middle of changing some of the plugin detection routines, so I'll have to pull this later on.\nI'm guessing you're using IE8. Any chance you could double check it on IE6 or 7?\n. Thanks. I've added this to the master.\n. Flash doesn't like to play local files. Put it on a website (or use a webkit browser) and it should work fine.\n. By Webkit, I mean an updated copy of either Safair or Google Chrome. You could even use IE9. However, if you use Firefox or Opera, they require Flash to play the MP3 file and that is something you can't demo on your hard drive.\n. Do you have the latest version and the latest version of Quicktime installed? (Sadly, Safari can't play audio without Quicktime installed)\n. Strange. Well glad it worked for you. Local files can be a bit tricky. Let me know if anything else comes up. Also, you might want to turn off the duration in your page instead of in the .js file\njQuery(document).ready(function($) {\n    $('video,audio').mediaelementplayer({controls:{duration:false}});\n});\n. Just if you ever need to update the code, then you'll have to go back and find all the places that changed...\n. In fact, I was just thinking about moving the code for the buttons to the options so you could re-arrange it yourself...\n. jQuery(document).ready(function($) {\n    $('video,audio').mediaelementplayer({\n           audioHeight:100, \n           audioWidth: 500, \n           controls:{duration:false}\n    });\n});\n. The problem is just that the browser doesn't know the video type since there is no extension. So just add type=\"video/mp4\" and you'll be all set. \n. I'll add a type parameter to the wordpress plugin and update the code to the latest which fixes the bug on line 13. You can also write [video mp4=\"amazon\"] to force the video/mp4 format. I'm not sure why firefox is trying to play the mp4 though. \n. I updated the Wordpress plugin which and it should show up soon. It now has an admin option to specify a default type so you don't have to include it on every [video] tag.\nLet me know how it works for you.\n. just noticed that the data being sent to Flash uses a querystring which blows up media querystrings. i'll put in a fix by tomorrow.\n. I'll double check the URL encoding again. Looks like I need to double url encode it or something.\n. This should be fixed in 2.0.2 on Monday or Tuesday. I've stared using encodeURIComponent() which should work consistently across browsers.\n. Actually, I pushed it up today so give it a shot when you can. Thanks!\n. What version are you seeing this on? It's not in the latest code.\n. This is fixed in the latest update (pushed today).\n. Matt,\nThanks. I've almost got this worked out. I'll update it later today with some additional changes/fixes.\n. Matt,\nI've pushed an update to fix this. It's been removed in my 2.0 re-write that I'm still testing before releasing.\n. Thanks, I'll give it a look.\n. This is fixed in the latest source\n. Good find! I'll check it out.\n. Fixed.\n. Could you tell me the browser and filetype you're using?\n. Thanks for the link. Looks like you've changed players, so I can't really take a look at it for you.\n. Got it. I'll fix that this week. Thanks!\n. Could you show me how you're using the play and pause methods? In an updated version, I'm also making those methods public on the MediaElementPlayer object which might make it easier.\n. Unfortunately, there's no way to make the browsers work quite like that. Here's the syntax you should use:\n```\n// create the player object explicitly, not via jQuery().mediaelementplayer()\nvar player = new MediaElementPlayer('myvideid');\n// call methods on the internal media object (you can leave off the .media in the latest code)\nplayer.media.setSrc('mynewvideo.mp4');\nplayer.media.load();\nplayer.media.play();\n```\nHope that helps!\n. I mean there is no way to get  $(\"video\")[0].play() to work in all browsers the same way since they don't support the same features.\nSince webkit supports native H.264 playback,  $(\"video\")[0].play() will work. However, on IE8 which doesn't support the [video] tag $(\"video\")[0].play() isn't available, and on Firefox which can't play H.264, $(\"video\")[0].play() will fail.\n. Feel free to re-open this if you need to.\n. What version are you using?\n. I'd recommend downloading the latest code instead of that build. In fact, I need to remove that one since it has problems. Thanks for letting me know!\n. It's coming... not quite finished yet.\n. Those files are there now.\n. Thanks!\n. Oh that's a tough one. I'm not sure how to best handle that in Flash/Silverlight, so I always assumed pixels.  Could you show me how you're using it so we can come up with something that will work across the browser spectrum?\n. Actually, this should be closed. You can now just create a video tag like this\n<video width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"></video>\nand it will be responsive/adaptive.\n. Thanks! It's there now.\n. Good point. just curious, are you using that for anything?\n. Just committed this change. Give me a few days to push it into the /build/ folder.\n. Brajesh,\nCould you set up an example page I can look at?\n. Brajesh,\nI'd love to help fix this, but I'm not sure I can without an example, so I'm going to close it for now. Feel free to reopen it if you get a chance to create an exaample.\n. That's a great idea. I'll add it this week.\n. It's in 2.0.2\n. Great idea. I'll get it in there soon.\n. It's been added. It will appear in 2.0.1 later this week.\n. Thanks for the reminder. I just added it back in. Let me know if it answers your questions.\n. Thanks for the tip. I'll take a look\n. Have you experienced this in practice? I'd like to work on it, but I can't seem to replicate it.\n. No, I still haven't gotten to this one.\n. Any chance you want to take a stab at adding the code you found?\n. This is now in the latest /src/\n. Do you see this same error when you're not working with a local file (file://). Flash has a different set of security features for local.\n. I've put this change in. It'll appear in 2.0.1 later this week.\n. Al,\nThat's an interesting idea. I think you might be right that hiding the real fullscreen button and then having a special \"launch fullscreen\" button might be best.\nTo hide the fullscreen button, you would do something like\n     var player = new MediaElementPlayer('#myvideo', {features: ['playpause','current','progress','duration',volume']});\nThen you'd do something like\n     function launchFullscreen() {\n          window.open('video.html?startTime=' + player.currentTime);\n     }\nJD\n. Yes, I think it might be the encoding, since the file doesn't play in Chrome even if I just navigate directly do it (http://videotest.agiletech.ie/preview-asset-163.mp4). That means the problem is at least not due to MEjs.\n. What are you using to encode it? Here's the ffmpeg command I use:\nffmpeg.exe -i inputfile.avi -b 1500k -vcodec libx264 -vpre slow -vpre baseline                                           -g 30 -s 640x360 output.mp4\n. Closing this since it's related to encoding not MEjs.\n. Bummer. Here's what I've been using lately:\nffmpeg.exe -i input.flv -b 1500k -vcodec libx264 -vpre slow -vpre baseline                                           -g 30 -s 640x360 output.mp4\nI guess you could only offer the FLV to chrome by removing the other  tags on the server side.\n. It turns out this is breaking normal playback (stream.connect() never gets called), so I'm going to have to re-work it a bit.\n. Is the currently updated code working for you? If so, I'd like to close this one.\n. Your site looks awesome! However, I can't get IE8 to fail in the way you're describing.\n. Could you update to the latest code (2.0.2) and see if that helps it out?\n. Do you have a sample page I can look at? I'm guessing that no valid media URL is being passed to IE.\n. I've changed this to use encodeURIComponent so it will work in all versions of IE. It'll be out in 2.0.2 next week or you can grab the files in the src folder and build it yourself.\n. Could you test out the latest (2.0.2) and see if it works for you in Firefox? I think the problem might have been in the event code from Flash, not actually in the JavaScript\n. Strange, after I press play, the controls fade out for me under Safari/Windows. Strangely, however, the video is not playable in Chrome. Perhaps you need to double check the codec?\n. Oh, got it. Thanks!\n. Would it work if you put the FLV first in the list? (you'd have to manually edit Wordpress for this). It might make Android and iPhone 3.x fail though.\n. Khughitt,\nI'm not too familiar with Wordpress post processing. You might be able to accomplish this, but I wouldn't know where to tell you to look. You could also just not use the plugin and use MEjs directly with a custom <video> tag.\n. Fixed! (2.0.1.2)\n. Here's some sample code for you:\n<script>\nnew MediaElement(\"#player\", {success: function(player) {\n    $(\"a.thumb\").click(function() {\n        player.setSrc( [\n            {src: this.href + '.mp4', type: 'video/mp4'},\n            {src: this.href + '.webm', type: 'video/webm'}\n        ]);\n        player.load();\n        player.play();\n        return false;\n    });\n}});\n</script>\n. That's an interesting idea. In my own use when I'm doing things dynamically, I've just been using the setSrc() method of MediaElementPlayer to change out videos, but you might have something else in mind. I'd welcome patches if you want to fork it and play around with what you need.\n. Flash or Ogg?\n. Interesting. Sounds like Chromium must be answering in correctly to canPlayType. Could you confirm?\n. FYI: This might be related to Google's removal of h.264 going forward.\n. I need to know the version of Firefox and media type you're using. MEjs  uses all of those events.\n. Thanks, I've added a variation of this for the next release.\n. Unfortunately, outerHTML is the only way to make IE work with ExternalInterface JavaScript in other scenarios. I wish using the DOM were possible, but IE6-8 are pretty badly broken in that regard and Flash doesn't help matters. If innerHTML works for you in your solution, then I say go with it!\n. I made a small change that allows both the outerHTML that IE requires, but also includes the me-plugin class, so the next release should help you.\n. I can't remember the cases in which IE fails without outerHTML, but you can see this is the age-old technique of libraries like SwfObject: http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/source/browse/trunk/swfobject/src/swfobject.js\n. That would require preloading the video which so far I can't figure out how to do in Flash without also starting playback. There isn't a good way to load just the first frame, and then stop loading after that (like preload=\"metadata\" is supposed to do). If you know of a way, I'm totally open for patches.\n. I can't 100% understand what you're asking, but if you add \"controls=true\" to the FlashVars like the example on mediaelementjs.com and hear on GitHub.com, you'll get controls on the Fallback player for browsers without JavaScript.\n. You're right. That does make sense. My original reason for the Flash controls was a non-Javascript fallback, but your use case is interesting as well. I'll see if I can add it without messing too much up :)\n. This is in the latest source which will be in the /build/ folder later this week.\n. MediaElement is designed for you to be able to build on it whatever you want (I build MediaElementPlayer on top of it!) so perhaps you should build what you're thinking and then we can look at integrating it later down the line.\n. I'm still looking at how to make this work, but I like the idea of seeing the controls with the JavaScript if you're using the MediaElementPlayer.\n. Dan, did you send me some code that fixes this?\n. I just added this and some small adjustments to the JS to make it easier to get to the 00:00 mark. It'll show up officially in 2.0.5\n. Thanks again for the fix\n. Yeah, I'm trying to find something better. If you have any other suggestions, I'm all ears.\n. Any ideas on how to \"encourage people to use stackoverflow\"?\n. That jQuery plugin looks great, but it looks like it only does single questions. However the API doesn't look too bad: \nhttp://api.stackoverflow.com/1.0/questions?tagged=html5;video\nAny suggestions for a tag?\n. I've for someone wh can retag a question. So would mind asking something (even an easy question) the send me the link so I can get it tagged. Thanks!\n. Here you go: http://mediaelementjs.com/support\n. Do you have an example or a line number where the error is happening?\n. I'm having trouble reproducing this error on my end. Could you give me a test page along with the HTML you've entered into Wordpress?\n. Sure, but here are two quick things to try: \n(1) Remove the mp4 since the audio tag will only use the MP3 and Ogg files\n(2) Add a slash '/' to the beginning of the attributes:\n    [audio mp3=\"/wp-content/uploads/Alice-Eats-Wonderland.mp3 ogg=\"/wp-content/uploads/Alice-Eats-Wonderland.ogg\"]\n. Okay, send me a preview at johndyer@gmail.com\n. You just need to use standard JavaScript:\nvar videos = $('video').mediaelementplayer({\n   success: function(media) {\n       media.addEventListener('play', function() {\n           media.pause();              \n        }, true);\n    }\n});\n. Yes, but I don't understand what you're trying to do above, so I was just giving an example of how to bind an event and call a method.\n. Just added a back reference so you can use this syntax if you want\n    $(\"video\")[0].player.play();\nand\n    $(\"#myplayer\")[0].player.addEventListener('play', function() {\n           // do something\n    }, true);\n. I'm fixing this in 2.0.3. Thanks!\n. It's there now.\n. Thanks, but that image doesn't really help me help you. Perhaps you could setup a demo page that I could look at.\n. If you can send me the changes you have, I'd be happy to see if I can incorporate them.\n. I like the idea here, but does \"stop\" always mean \"stop downloading the file\" in media players? There is no equivalent method in HTML5, so it would be Flash/SL only if we implemented it this way.\n. Thanks! I just pushed all of these changes to github.com and they'll show up in the 2.0.5 release once I've tested a few more things.\n. Yes, it's compiled to version 3 to support Linux though.\n. You're right. I'm taking a look at it now. Thanks!\n. It's fixed in 2.0.3\n. It's designed to have the JavaScript override the HTML if you want. \nAs far as I know, poster is a valid attribute: http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/video.html#attr-video-poster\n. Yesterday, I introduced a bug on the plugin detection that threw off the audio/mp3 player. It's fixed now (2.0.4)\n. Mike,\nI actually fixed this in 2.0.4 before I saw that you had a pull request. But I'm going to try to revert the changes and pull yours so you can get credit :)\n. Good call. Thanks for mentioning this.\n. The changes have been committed\n. I like this idea, but if the controls are static they really need to display under the play (like YouTube) instead of on top. That makes this a little harder to pull off...\n. I would love to make it pure css, but you can't do fade in/fade out in CSS :)\n. Since you're loading from a different domain you'll need a crossdomain.xml policy for Flash to accept the file.\n. It looks like the error is that Flash doesn't like doing Javascript communication from another domain. Since your page is on \"http://columbiandev.www.clients.ellingtoncms.com\" and your JavaScript/flash files are on  \"http://columbian.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/\" it's throwing security errors. \nIn flash you have to add this code\n    System.security.allowDomain(\"columbiandev.www.clients.ellingtoncms.com\");\nto make it work. I'll look for a way to add that dynamically.\n. Could you also try adding the crossdomain.xml file to http://columbiandev.www.clients.ellingtoncms.com/crossdomain.xml\n. Try the 2.0.5 release. I added the System.security.allowDomain which should help. Let me know how it goes.\n. Does the latest version fix your issue?\n. Make sure you update to 2.0.4. 2.0.3 had a plugin problem (it was only out for less than 24 hours).\nAlso, you didn't include the silverlight plugin so someone without flash won't work.\n. I'm not sure what you mean by \"duplicating\"? It looks like they are not layed out right since they can't measure themselves until they are visible.\n. Instead of \n    $(document).ready(function() {\n     $(\"video\").mediaelementplayer();\n```\n $(\".hide\").click(function() {\n   $(\".video\").hide();\n });\n$(\".show\").click(function() {\n   $(\".video\").show();\n });\n});\n```\nCould you try\n```\n$(document).ready(function() {\n $(\"video\").mediaelementplayer();\n$(\".hide\").click(function() {\n   $(\".video\").css('visibility','hidden');\n });\n$(\".show\").click(function() {\n   $(\".video\").css('visibility','visible');\n });\n});\n```\nI think Flash doesn't like being inside a \"display:none;\" block\n. The problem is that Firefox will always reload a Flash object when you use display:none. See Mozilla's own documentation: http://support.mozilla.com/kk/questions/774884 in which they recommend using visibility:hidden.\nI've added some code that will prevent the control duplication, however your video will still be restarted when you change tabs in Firefox.\n. Interesting that (1) didn't get solved. It worked in my limited test. I'd love to see your updated version.\nI also ran into the problem of (2) and have already added it to the code.\n(3) Great to hear! But I'm not sure if a timeout would help. It's just plain tricky working with Flash and display:none.\n. Thanks. Actually, we don't use it in the plugin so I'll just remove it.\n. Whoops, I thought this was already fixed. Thanks for catching it! \nIt's been committed.\n. I have tested with a few FLVs that do work, but I'm not sure why yours isn't working. \nCan Flash normally play that FLV?\n. I guess the bigger question is if HTML5, Flash, or Silverlight can play 3pg files and it seems the answer is no which means there's really no way for MEjs to play them in a browser. Sorry!\n. Not sure how to help on this without more information.\n. Actually, there isn't one right now. I'll need to add that.\n. It'll show up in 2.0.5\n. Good call!\n. You might want to go in and add the mp4 mimetype to IIS. I think iPhones want that to work.\n. Not sure what to recommend in your case.\nHTML5 is supposed to have a native \"loop\" attribute but not all browsers (or Apple products do it), so we're forced to use the 'ended' event to mimic what the browser makers have not implemented.\nThe Flash \"loop\" attribute is for old school Flash animations and doesn't really work with their video implementation (or MediaElementj.js)\nSo the bottom line is, \"yes,\" you do need to use events. Even if we were to implement this in Flash, we'd have to use events there too and you'd still see a slight delay.\n. Good idea. \nAlso, I'm alway happy to have you fork and pull the code so you get credit for the change.\n. Yes, unfortunately, it's not currently possible to switch between certain formats. \nThe problem is that MediaElement.js would have to have a Flash or SL player ready in the background just in case you might need them. That would add a lot of overhead for most use cases.\n. Good find.\n. You're right. I'm cheating. \nHowever, I found that if I didn't do this here the control UI was not responsive enough in certain cases.\n. I totally agree with you that extending the DOM is normally bad practice, but here are some things to consider\n- The issues Crockford brings up primarily relates to what happens in IE when you extend the DOM then add events. However, for IE6,7,8, MediaElement.js is not extending the DOM since those browsers are using Flash, not HTML5. Only modern browsers with decent memory management are getting DOM extensions.\n- Javascript calls to and from Flash/SL are very, very slow. So calling getCurrentTime() sevreal times a second (every time the 'timeupdate' event fires) would probably crash the browser. For this reason, when Flash fires off a 'timeupdate' event it updates the currentTime property so you don't have to make a second call back to it.\n- Using get/set methods for everything would add about 40 functions to the code, and push us further and further away from interacting with MediaElement.js as if it were native HTML5. I want to avoid introducing a new way of coding to HTML5 if at all possible.\nAgain, I agree that it would be preferable not to extend the DOM, but I think the tradeoff it worth it in this case.\n. That code is fantastic, and maybe I should have just done that from the beginning.\nBut I'm still worried that it would break all existing implementations.\nAlso, it would need something like \n    if (!proto['get' + capitalized]) {\naround those code blocks so as not to overwrite some of the necessary custom implementations of those methods.\n. One other potential issue: It seems that we'd also need a wrapper for event handling so that we don't return the native HtmlMediaElement object, but instead return this wrapper object.\n. Those look like great projects!\nI'm happy to see how it all looks if you want to work on it, however, I'm still not wild about the idea of adding all of this complexity and abstraction when it's not really causing a problem right now.\n. Sounds great!\n. Oh, and I guess you could still make the wrapper object have readonly copies of the native object's properties so it wouldn't break anything...\n. Great idea. This would just take a little CSS and JS. You're welcome to fork the code, add it, and I'll pull it back in.\n. Wow, that's a neat idea. the best bet might be to have two players that you swap in and out when you go between videos.\n. You could always listen for the \"volumechanged\" event and then change it on the other player.\n. Sorry about that. Fixed.\n. Wow. This is pretty crazy. \nNothing come immediately to mind, but I'll look at it and see if I can track it down. It's always tricky using Flash across domains, but hopefully it won't be too hard to figure out.\n. Could you replace the mediaelement-and-player.min.js file in your wp-content directory with the uncompressed version here: https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/blob/master/build/mediaelement-and-player.js (just copy and paste the code from one into the other). That will let me debug it and see where/when the errors are happening.\n. Looks like there is a stray question mark (?) in the code at line 887. Try removing that and we'll see if we can get the script going again. I think I know what the IE problem is, but I want to be sure.\n. Okay, I've updated the Flash player to fix those errors, but I want you to test it before I push it to the Wordpress repository. Could you grab the latest https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/raw/master/build/flashmediaelement.swf and upload it to your Wordpress install. If that works for you, then I'll make it live for all WP users. Thanks!\n. Okay, I updated the Flash again. Could you try it again? https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/raw/master/build/flashmediaelement.swf\n. The <object> inside the <video> tag is supposed to be a fallback for when IE doesn't support JavaScript. But it didn't have an ID attribute and so the Flash code was erroring out when it tried to find the MediaElement.js code. I'm updating the Wordpress plugin now.\n. Yeah, it was in the main .as file.\n. I would guess this is a bug in Mac/Safari because PC/Safari 5.0.3 reports 'maybe' to audio/mp3.\nTo work around this, I added some code to check for \"audio/mpeg\" if the type is \"audio/mp3\" just to make sure Mac/Safari works. \nhttps://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/blob/master/src/js/me-shim.js#L212\n. You're right. It looks like we need a play event to fix that. Thanks for catching that.\n. Should be fixed in the latest.\n. Looks like there is sometimes a delay when the Flash player isn't ready yet. Are you using this on the WSJ site, or somewhere else?\n. Just fixed this. It'll show up in the next release\n. Ian,\nCould you replace the mediaelement-and-player.min.js file in your wp-content directory with the uncompressed version here: https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/blob/master/build/mediaelement-and-player.js (just copy and paste the code from one into the other). That will let me debug it and see where the errors are happening.\n. My safari won't play the video at all, and Chrome displays it with a different aspect ratio than the poster. I'm working on the IE bugs, but I'm guessing that your MP4 isn't encoded right and that's what's affecting the other browsers. You could try www.mirovideoconverter.com since it always produces a correct H.264/MP4\n. I fixed the IE error (another user posted the same thing) and I'll have the Wordpress plugin fixed in a few hours. Thanks for reporting it!\n. There are a few options. (1) Your MP4s might still not be quite right (i.e. they don't tell Flash the duration until it's loaded). You could test this by using the same media included here on this site in the /media/ folder. (2) Your server might not be configured to send the file correctly.\n. Check out http://www.scottgmorgan.com/blog/index.php/2008/01/23/why-is-my-progressive-h264-video-not-playing-until-the-entire-file-is-downloaded/\n. That's a cool work around idea. The only problem is that if you ever hide and then show it again, Firefox will re-initialize the SWF. For that reason, I think the best thing is just to use visibility: hidden; which does not have the same initializing problems. \n. Very strange. Does it happen when you don't use the modal window?\n. Could you give an example of what you want to do?\n. Thanks. I've added this to the development branch.\nYour comments on the speed of the JS/Flash bridge are good. Right now, the options have a timerRate you can set to adjust how often the 'timeupdate' event happens, but there isn't anything that actually tells Flash which events it should fire. That's a good idea and I've added it to the todo list.\n. Looks like IE would need something like this from SwfObject: \nhttp://code.google.com/p/swfobject/source/browse/trunk/swfobject/src/swfobject.js#474\n. I'm finally getting around to adding this to the core project. Hopefully it'll show up in a minor release later this week.\n. In 2.4.1, you can call the remove() method on the player object or the media object\n```\nvar player = new MediaElementPlayer('#player', {\n    success: function(media, node) {  \n    }\n});\n$('#remove-player').click(function() {\n    player.remove();\n});\n```\n. I suppose if there is no extension then a defaultVideoType and defaultAudioType in the options could be used.\n. I've just added support for this event to the Flash and Silverlight shims\n. You could put it inside an element you positioned absolutely offscreen or use visibility: hidden;\n. Cool idea. Want to fork the code and work on it?\n. Yeah, the new version of Chrome is pretty broken when it comes to audio. I'm not sure quite what to do at this point other than hope they fix it quickly.\n. Dunno, never tried it.\n. Yeah, that's what I'm working on now. (notice the new \"mode\" in the options). \nHowever, after restarting my computer this morning, Chrome might have updated because I'm not seeing the problem on http://mediaelementjs.com/ any more.\n. (sorry, it's not done yet :)\n. I just checked in the feature (but you'll have to build it).\n. I can't think of a good reason to have a blank poster attribute, so I can't see a reason to support it. If you have a good reason and want to contribute code, you're welcome to.\n. Should be fixed in latest release by removing the <img> element alltogether.\n. This is fixed in the latest code. \n. Thanks!\n. We've already closed this bug by working around Mac/Safari 5.0.3 failing to report that it can play MP3s (ironically the PC version is fine) , but it's not yet in the /build/ folder. It'll make it in later this week.\n. The trick here is that you're probably looking for the \"pause()\" method. HTML5 doesn't have a \"stop()\" method, but it's there for people doing streaming flash media to close the stream properly. I can add some error correct to the audio stop() method, but you're probably better off just pausing. Does that work?\n. Also, setting mode: 'shim' forces Flash/Silverlight and disallows HTML5. Is that what you want?\n. did pause work for you?\n. did you get this working, or is it still giving you problems?\n. Yes, the \"stop\" method is really only for Flash streaming, so I should get rid of it or add a giant (*) notice.\n. Just updated the site.\nGlad to hear it's working for you.\n. Great idea. Go for it!\n. The browsers don't directly support this that I know of.\n. Thanks Sean, I pulled it down and once I do some testing I'll push it into the live repo.\n. Here you go\n$('audio').mediaelementplayer({audioWidth: 100, audioHeight: 100});\n. 1. Add files\n  <script src=\"jquery.js\"></script>\n  <script src=\"mediaelement-and-player.js\"></script>\n  <link href=\"mediaelementplayer.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" />\n\n\n\nAdd media\n \n3. Call player\n\n  $('audio').mediaelementplayer({audioWidth: 100, audioHeight: 100});\n  \n. Chrome 10 and IE9 RC played it great on my PC, but Safari and Firefox with Flash were super slow. That makes me think that the encoding might be off. How did you encode this file?\n. Were you able to resolve the encoding and playback issues? Also, make sure your server has the MIME type video/mp4 for your mp4 files.\n. I'm closing this. Please feel free to comment if you've found a bug in mediaelement.\n. I haven't worked a ton on streaming, but does the \"stop\" button work for you?\n\n\nIf you look in the /src/js/ directory you'll see the code for the playpause and stop buttons. Perhaps you could do a mashup of those for what you need.\n. It's a Mac bug.\nWe have a work around in place, but it's not in the current build yet.\n. A Mac tester said it was fixed in 2.1.0, but it appears to have completely killed playback, so now I have to rework it.\n. When does this happen?\n. Can you provide a reproducible example?\n. I'm glad you were able to get it to work. If you find an issue that I can help others with, please let me know!\n. Any chance you can post an example where it doesn't work for you?\n. The upcoming 2.2.2 also does a slightly better job of updating the rail in weird situations.\n. Matt,\nIn IE, I think the only problem is when you click the button before Flash is ready.\nIn iPhone however, you have uncovered a nice bug! Can I send you a new version to test?\n. I don't usually commit files in the build folder until they are tested and ready for release. You can run the builder.py script, or I can send it your way...\n. Matt,\nDo the files in the development branch (marked 2.1.1.dev) work for you?\n. Whoops. Updated.\n. I've pulled this into the development branch, and then I'll merge it over into the master once I've got it working.\n. Apparently there's a bg in github.com right now. Hopefully they'll fix it soon. \n. Diogo,\nMediaElement.js has html5shiv code in it already (document.createElement('video')).\nYou just need to make sure it runs before your audio or video tags.\n. I implemented \"loadstart\" and \"canplay\" in Flash, but not \"loadeddata\". I think I should probably sent out \"loadeddata\" along with \"canplay\" since I can't be totally sure which is correct.\n. Just added it to the development branch. Thanks for catching that!\n. Interesting. When I hit the page and watch the file download in the Net tab of Firebug, it looks like Firebug doesn't know how big the file is (which means Flash gets confused too).\nOnce it's downloaded all the way, and I refresh the page, then it plays great.\nIs there some setting on your server that would send the duration? Also have you tried the tools that move the MP4 index to the front?\n. Hmm... I setup this page: http://www.mediaelementjs.com/demo.php\nwhich seems to work for me. Does it work for you?\nCould you try removing the autoplay and see if that helps? \n. Rod,\nI don't have any plans for that, but I think you could do something like:\n```\n http://www.mysite.com/video.html#129\n$('#myplayer').mediaelementplayer({\n    success:function(mediaElement) {\n        if (window.location.hash != '') {\n            mediaElement.setCurrentTime(window.location.hash);\n        }\n    }\n });\n```\n. Sounds like fun. Want to work on it?\n. I'd still love to see contributions to this.\n. It's something I'd love to do, but I it seems there are so many ways to do\nit, it's hard to figure out what an official one should look like.\nJD\nOn Sun, Aug 28, 2011 at 11:35 AM, DeadSuperHero \nreply@reply.github.comwrote:\n\nWould love this.

Matt,\nMake sure you have jQuery 1.5.1, not 1.5.0 which introduced a change that broke IE9 RC.\nDoes that fix it for you?\n. Matt,\nIE9 RC on Win7 32bit seems fine, so I wonder if there's something going on with the 64bit version. Maybe we can grab lunch sometime and hash it out... \nFYI: MediaElement.js was in part developed for ECHO conference at Watermark last summer :)\n. Man, you are finding some great edge-case bugs. \n2.1.1 is currently codenamed \"watermarkmatt\"\n. Could you test the latest files in the development/build folder?\n. I added this to the development branch.\n. Please let me know if you're still seeing this in the 2.2.2 version (in the development branch).\n. For the 2.3 release, I'm hoping to allow these two syntaxes\nAttribute discovery (href or src)\n<a class=\"mejs\" href=\"video.mp4\"></a>\n<script>\n$('.mejs').mediaelementplayer();\n</script>\nDefined in JavaScript\n<div id=\"player\" ></div>\n<script>\n$('#player').mediaelementplayer({src:'video.mp4'});\n</script>\n. Do you have an example I can look at. I'm not able to replicate this on my end.\n. Fixed in latest dev branch. \n. I'd recommend you not use the .hide() command, but instead use:\n$('div.mejs-container').css('visibility','hidden');\nThis will also prevent Flash from throwing errors when it's hidden.\n. I'll push this over to the main branch in a few days.\n. In all my tests this appears to be working in 2.2.2 (the development branch). I'll close this, but please comment if that version is still not working for you.\n. Yes, iOS is pretty tricky when it comes to poster's so we just try to disable them to make sure they work.\nThanks for the not on the new UA. I've updated the development branch so all checks happen in lowercase.\n. Thanks!\n. Firefox 3 or 4? PC or Mac? Flash installed? Error messages?\n. Are you working locally or on a webserver?\nIf you're working with local files, you'll need to add your working directory here to your Flash Security Settings: http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager04.html\n. Great ideas. I've added a little section to the instructions to help with these issues. \n. Thanks! Fixed in the development branch\n. This was added to the current version.\n. Do you have an example you can post?\n. I can't replicate this problem. If someone can provide an example, I'm happy to reopen this issue.\n. @matrym, the Flash and Silverlight shims already mimic the HTML5 event.buffered property. The problem comes with older browsers like FF 3.6 and even Safari which doesn't fully support the buffered property.\nThe code under \n     MediaElementPlayer.prototype.setProgressRail = function(e) {\nin the mep-feature-progress.js explains the current methodology\n. Thanks for this.\nI'm making a few changes to make the hours optional.\n. Are you still seeing this in current versions of Chrome. If so, please feel free to re-open.\n. Tomme,\nI'd love to help with this, but I'm not as familiar with all the possible streaming scenarios and server implementations. If you have something in mind, it'd be fun to collaborate on it.\n. I'm not quite sure what you mean. MediaElement.js already does this. You have the option of simply writing\n<video src=\"video.mp4\"></video>\n <script>\n $('video').mediaelementplayer();\n </script>\nYou can also use the \"Video for Everybody\" syntax if you like, but it's certainly not required.\nIs that what you mean or am I missing something?\n. Fixed in development branch. Will be in 2.1.4\n. Thanks. I'll take a look\n. In the current dev branch, I can't seem to get this to happen under IE8. Could you post an example?\n. Thansk. I'll take a look this week.\n. Could one of you guys post an example? I can't replicate it with the tests I have.\n. Whoops. I didn't realize you meant audio, not video.\n. Fixed in the latest development branch.\n. Thanks for the update. VMs can test for a lot of things, but sadly they are tough when it comes to video.\n. You need to use the MediaElement object as shown in the example /demo/mediaelement.html\n. Sadly, Apple programmed Safari so that it cannot recognize <source> tags without QuickTime installed. Since Win/Safari has such low market share, I haven't spent a lot of time trying to test for this case.\n. This is in the latest dev branch.\n. Yeah, I think for the older versions of IE you'll need to use the actual event (e) parameter.\nIf someone wants to update me-mediaelement.js around line 220, I'll be happy to include it.\n. Yeah, I think I'd need to see a sample of this to fix it. Could you post it somewhere so I can mess around with it?\n. Just to keep the issue list clean, I'm going to close this for now. If you can post an example, we can look at it again.\n. I'm not sure I understand what you're saying, but HTML5 requires that you not only set the new source, but that you call the load function:\nmedia.setSrc('myfile.mp4');\n  media.load();\nIs that what you were missing?\n. Yes, it is a little bit annoying that HTML5 does that. Chrome in particular is a bit tricky when it comes to <audio> tags. Hopefully this will get better! You can also listened for the 'loadeddata' and 'canplay' events to know when to fire the play() method.\n. @tommedema, \nAs I understand it the 'canplay' event should fire sometime after load is called, but it's meant to indicate that enough of the file has downloaded that the file can being playing. Since I can't seem to find a way to make flash start pre-loading the file without playing it, I'm not sure which is more correct\n(1) my initial solution - fire 'canplay' after play() is called and the file has really started loading, but some developers might be looking for a 'canplay' event after load() is called.\n(2) your idea - fire 'canplay' in the load() method even though nothing has really loaded\nAfter typing that out, it does seem like your idea makes more sense, but I want to look it over and think it through a bit more.\n. I think I have this basically worked in now. If not, we can try again.\n. The problem I'm having is that I can't seem to get Flash to pre-load the video without actually playing it. So HTML5's preload=[none|metadata|auto] can't fully be replicated. I can do 'none' and I can do autoplay=\"autoplay\", but I can't do preload=metadata or preload=auto.\nIf you have any hints as to how to get flash to do that, I'd love to implement it.\n. Could you share an example of how it doesn't work? The player's timeline uses setCurrentTime to seek.\n. Fixed in the latest development branch checkins\n. Oh, Apple. I'll need to look at it again so see if they changed their API. It's crazy how different Safari for Mac and for PC is.\n. Just tested on Mac Safari 5.0.4 and it works. Upgrading to 5.0.5 to test.\n. Turns out the problem is that OSX 10.5 doesn't support fullscreen (even thought it reports that it does). I've added a check for this, and now he should get \"full browser\" rather than \"full screen\".\n. I can't generate this with IE9 on Win7. Some people have reported problems under emulators or virtual PCs. Are you using the real thing?\n. Ranza,\nWere you able to take a look at this? \n. I'd really have to see this to know what's going on. My guess is that there is some kind of competing CSS on the page.\n. Thanks for this. I'll add it to the next point release.\n. This was added to 2.1.4\n. Oh Apple. I'll do some more testing.\n. Good to know. One other thing you can try is explicitly calling the html5 load() function.\nplayer.setSrc('file.mp4');\n player.load();\n player.play();\nThat will explicitly override anything set in the preload attribute.\n. Good call. Thanks.\n. HTML5 or Flash?\nAre you using the .load() function? This is an HTML5 convention.\n. I've made a few changes to 2.1.5 and in FF4 using Flash, I can see it stops downloading the previous file.\n. Wow, thanks for figuring that out.\nI had someone report it earlier, but I never caught the DOCTYPE issue.\nThe reason I used CSS instead of JavaScript for this initially was that I imagined someone wanting to build their own volume switch that didn't need a hover and I didn't want to force that behavior. However, my choice breaks IE6 and the older DOCTYPE you mentioned.\nIf you do want to add your code, you could do it in the success event in the options.\n. could you post a demo/example?\n. there's no file specified.\n[audio src=\"myfile.mp3\"]\nOn Sat, May 28, 2011 at 10:00 AM, Blackbrook \nreply@reply.github.comwrote:\n\nPlease have a look at this: http://steve.boxbox.org/?p=245\nI am working on this issue with TankOs ;)\nCheers,\nSteve\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/issues/194#comment_1254161\n\n\nJohn Dyer - http://j.hn/\n. Are you seeing this on http://mediaelementjs.com/ If not, could you point me to a demo where you're seeing it?\n. The original error is fixed in 2.1.5.\n. I think that's a great idea. Want to work on it?\n. This is if you want to have a  <video> with no src specified when the page loads. You still need to tell MEjs what kind of payer to create (one that works with 'video/mp4' or 'video/wmv' etc.) so that when you're ready to load a video it can play it.\n. So it turns out this is a bug in IE9. It happens when you start out with a <video> tag with <source> elements. In that case, IE9 won't let you set the .src attribute. However, if you start out with <video src> and don't use <source> elements then it will work. \nI'm going to work on a work around...\n. I've filed a bug with the IE team, but I haven't built in a work around yet. I had a few other things in front of this in the queue.\n. Fixed in latest.\n. HTMLMediaElement is the native HTML5 code that I'm attempting to override because Android 2.1 and 2.2 have broken  HTML5 support. htmlMediaElement on the other hand is MediaElement specfic code.\nI do need to work on Android again, but it's very difficult to do because the emulator can't actually play video, and each device and OS version has a different combination of broken HTML5 and Flash.\n. Yes, with iframes you must include these attributes webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen for true fullscreen to work. It is impossible for the full window feature to work in a pure iframe\n. Strange. I don't see it happening on http://mediaelementjs.com/ so something in you page is triggering WebKit to have that delay.\n. I know it's bizarre, but Apple requires that you install Quicktime for the  tag to work in Safari. Awesome, huh?\n. Sadly, no. Safari won't even let you access the <source> tag if Quicktime isn't present.\n. This is a great fix, and I've already added it.\nThe best way to submit something like this is just to do a pull request.\nI've just merged in several pulls this week as well as a bunch of other\nchanges.\nOn Sat, Nov 17, 2012 at 2:18 PM, Ryan Funduk notifications@github.comwrote:\n\nThis is an unfortunate bug that I stumbled on as well.

Thanks for pointing this out. This is a bit of an inconsistency because it was originally designed to be use on an empty <video></video> tag that would later be populated with the player.setSrc() method. I'll take a look and see if it makes sense to change it. Thanks again!\n. I've updated this in 2.1.7\n. fixed in 2.1.7 \n. You might want to see if you have Jetpack installed which will overwrite Mediaelement.js. In that case, you'll need to use [mejsaudio src=\"myfile.mp3\"]\n. I personally like jQuery, but I totally agree on this. \nI'd love to re-build the entire player to be library independent. The main things needed are \n(1) a selector engine (mostly just queryElementsByTagName)\n(2) event library (with IE leak support)\n(3) basic height/width/css property changes\nI think these could be build into a small zepto-like library so that there would be no need for Dependency Injection and things would still \"just work.\"\n. If you do take a look at the source, MediaElement.js (the Flash/Silverlight shim) is actually library independent. It's only MediaElementPlayer.js that uses jQuery.\n. FYI: There is now a branch called \"ender\" which bakes in the ender.js library (~22KB) and removes the requirement for jQuery. I'd be happy to hear what you think about this.\n. This looks pretty nice. I'll see about merging it soon. Thanks!!\n. I'm closing old bugs. If you are still seeing this, let me know.\n. It'd be good if you posted a simple example\n. Any chance you can try the old uninstall, reinstall thing? Sometimes Flash is just a little nuts.\n. Did you try using the success callback?\nvar player = new MediaElementPlayer('#player', {success: function() {\n  player.play();\n});\n. Hmm. I wonder if the video just isn't ready yet. Do you have preload=\"auto\"?\n. Working on closing all issues for the next release. Are you still seeing this problem?\n. I'm getting a 404 on your page.\n. I'm not sure who created that example page, but I went in an edited it to make more sense. There are problems with the MediaElement.js specific code, but it also has some bad JavaScript that wouldn't work anywhere.\n. These generally seem to be related to the encoding of the video. Any chance you can post it or try it with a Flash player like Flowplayer to make sure?\n. Glad you figured it out! I probably need some kind of tester...\n. This should be fixed in the current version. Thanks!\n. HTML5 does not have a true fullscreen mode, except in Safari 5.1.\nYou can use Flash's true fullscreen by setting forcePluginFullScreen: true in your options.\n. The changes was to bring a unified \"fullscreen\" experience which is \"full browser\" rather than \"full screen\" in most cases since only Safari 5.1 supports true fullscreen in HTML5. This allows all users to see the same buttons and UI in all cases.\nHowever, if you'd like to use Flash's true fullscreen then set forcePluginFullScreen: true in your options.\n. Thanks for reporting this. I'm looking into it.\n. I just updated my Firefox on Windows to 5.0.1 and it seems to play the audio on mediaelementjs.com okay using Flash. Any chance your Flash is acting up?\n. I put in some code to override WebKit and force autoplay. Should be out soon.\n. I totally agree with you. I hate the double click thing. But it's due to two things. First Flash's security doesn't allow you to call fullscreen from JavaScript. Second, normally we do 100% for \"full browser\", but sadly Firefox doesn't allow this because if you try to resize a Flash container, Firefox will reload it.\n1) I don't need real fullscreen. It will be enough to have 100% width 100% height\n-- This is what all browsers do, except Firefox with Flash because Firefox reloads/restarts flash if you try to resize it\n2) Additionaly why just not place under fullscreen button transparent flash button so when user clicks on html fullscreen he really click on flash fullscreen and all will work.\n-- I would love to do this, but you can't have an HTML element on top of a flash button and have it all work just right. When the user clicks the DOM button it doesn't transfer through to the Flash movie. If you have an idea of how to implement this, I'd love to see it!\nIt just so ugly to make user click several times.\n-- Again, this is only true for Firefox in Flash mode because of Firefox's inability to resize content. All other browsers get a consistent \"full browser\" mode.\n. Do you have the latest version?\nThe flag is listed in the readme page.\n. Again, try the latest version.\n. Thanks for this. I already have this fixed in the source, but I haven't released 2.2 since there are still a few bugs to work out.\n. I'm not sure about this one. I've just switched my main machine from a PC to\na Mac and I'm doing some custom work for a client and then I'll merge the\nchanges back in.\nJD\nOn Mon, Aug 29, 2011 at 6:35 AM, meandmymonkey \nreply@reply.github.comwrote:\n\nHey John,\nthanks, can you pinpoint what you did to fix this?

I'm trying to push out a 2.2.0 with a ton of changes and this can happen after that.\n. Dan,\nAfter looking at this, it appears to be a default HTML5 feature. I can wrap a try/catch around it, but I'm afraid it might cover up other problems. So I'm gonna close it for now.\n. This looks great. I'll get it in soon now.\n. My guess is that your video file doesn't have a lot of keyframes in it. Flash uses these to move through the video and it can only move to spots where there are keyframes.\n. I'll try to work on this for an upcoming release. I'm focusing on building in some iPad features and some things needed for a client, but I should be able to get back to general bug fixes in a week or so.\nThanks for the feedback!\n. Are you guys calling the load() method after setSrc():\nplayer.setSrc('newfile.mp4');\nplayer.load();\nplayer.play();\n. Could one of you guys provide a complete example of this failing? In my tests, I can call setSrc and load just fine, but I'd really like to fix this for you. \n. Matthew,\nUnfortunately, any change to the parent node of a Flash Embed causes Firefox to reload the entire embed. It's a really cruddy part of Firefox that has been there since 1.0 and they just won't fix it.\n. Here's some code that work well for me in Flash mode (tested Firefox 8 on Mac, and IE8 on PC)\n```\n\n\n$('video').mediaelementplayer({\n    success: function(media, node, player) {\n        media.addEventListener('ended', function() {\n\n            media.setSrc('video2.mp4');\n            media.load();\n            media.play();\n\n        }, false);\n    }\n});\n\n```\n. Sadly, there is no work around. This is a DIVX problem, and it's really very annoying.\n. Firefox 3.6 can only play Ogg (not WebM or MP4). It sounds like the Ogg playback isn't working too well for you. Are you using Ogg in production or is this just in the samples?\n. I'll reopen it if you can reproduce it\n. You might need to check the mimetype on your SRT files to make sure that\nthey are being served.\nJD\nOn Mon, Sep 19, 2011 at 5:35 PM, jettoblack \nreply@reply.github.comwrote:\n\nI'm having trouble getting the subtitles track to work in mediaelement\n2.1.9.

Browsers do not allow  content to go fullscreen yet. So you have to launch in a new window.\n. Hmmm. I'm guessing the HTML5 media element isn't firing a 'paused' event fast enough. I wonder if you could say\n$player.pause();\n $player.$media.trigger('paused');\n ... setSrc, load\n. I don't think I understand what you mean.\n. Unfortunately, WebVTT is not JavaScript, so it can't use JSONP. For now, it has to be on the same domain as the actual mediaelement.js script.\n. You might have had an out of date version.

Sounds like a fun feature, but it would require some coding. Would you like to give it a shot and send a pull request?\n. IN 2.4.2\n. This might be a nice feature to implement. Anyone want to take it on?\n. This will be in 2.4.2\n. It sounds like this is an encoding problem, not really something related to MEjs. If it's a problem with the player, feel free to reopen.\n. For YouTube, you have to provide a link to the direct MP4, not the YouTube player URL\n. It looks like Miro just converted it wrong and is sending the wrong info to Flash. I don't know of a way to detect improperly encoded video.\n. If you set to preload=\"none\" you should see the desired behavior.\n. This is fixed in the latest code. Look for it in 2.4.1\n. You can try adding audio/mp4 to the Flash plugin (by editing me-namespace.js) \nGive that a try and let me know if it works for you so I can add it.\n. Great point. I'm going to change them to \ncodebase=\"//download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab\"\nand\npluginspage=\"//www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer\"\nCould you try that and let me know if it works for your case?\n. This can be set using the enablePluginSmoothing: true option.\n. That error does look like a bug. But I think you can fix it just by telling MEjs what type you're going to use during the initialization:\n```\nvar player = new MediaElementPlayer('#myVideo', {\n    type: 'video/mp4',\n    success: function (mediaElement, domObject) {\n        var sources = [\n            { src: \"http://mysite.com/myvideo.mp4\", type: 'video/mp4' }\n        ];\n    mediaElement.setSrc(sources);\n    mediaElement.load();\n    mediaElement.play();\n}\n\n});\n``\n. In your example, you're asking for \"player.currentTime\", but to get to the media object, you can useplayer.media` which is a reference to either the real HTML5 media object or the shimmed object. That one will have currentTime on it.\n. That sounds like a pretty easy option to add. Please feel free to send me a pull request.\n. Sorry I haven't gotten to this one yet. Do you have another example URL?\n. I'm still having trouble reproducing this. You could also manually call setPlayerSize('100%','100%') after the success();\n. Thanks. Fixed for the next release!\n. Alicia,\nIt shouldn't be too hard to add, but I've been holding off since the standards keep shifting around (SRT is out, WebVVT is in).\n. Glad to hear you found a converter. \nHowever, iPad's fullscreen mode only uses the Apple media player which doesn't understand any web subtitle formats.\n. Just add a <track> element with a webvtt file.\n. Your code is right, but it looks like Flash might be throwing the error if the load() method isn't finished when you call play(). That's a bug, but I'm having trouble tracking it down.\n. Thanks! This will be fixed in the next version relaese.\n. This can be achieved simply by specifying \n<video style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%\"></video>\n. Thanks! I updated it to use parseInt with a radix = 10 which should do the trick. Appreciate it!\n. Thanks!\n. Sorry about that. It's fixed and I'll put it in an update today or tomorrow.\n. Yes, when it displays you can call\nplayer.setPlayerSize(player.width, player.height);\nplayer.setControlsSize();\nLet me know if that works for you.\n. Do you have an example of a video that Firefox reads as Infinity? I lean toward just leaving the progress bar empty and putting --:-- in the duration rather than hiding it altogether.\n. The page you linked to has JW player on it, but on the other pages with MEjs on it, Chrome Canary seems to play it fine.\n. I'm actually having a tough time replicating this, but I'll look into it some more and hopefully get in a fix soon.\n. Got it. This is only happening when you use the \"Video for Everybody\" syntax which includes the <object> tag. We'll get it fixed.\n. Can you just use <video style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%'></video> to enable the adaptive sizing?\n. FYI: next time you do a commit, make sure to work on the files in the /src/ directory, not the /build/ folder.\n. Do you have Flash or Silverlight installed?\n. No worries.

My guess is that the Flash player is trying to insert itself before things are ready. FLash doesn't like to be inside things that are display:none. I think it might help to call $().mediaelementplayer() inside Shadowbox's onOpen or onFinish callbacks.\n. The other problem might be that IE8 doesn't understand HTML5 tags like  and may not understand how to insert them. You could try content: <a href=\"mvideo.mp4\" id=\"player\"></a> and see if that works for you.\n. That parameter already exists.\n. You can try with \n<video>\n<source src=\"yourrtmpURL\" type=\"video/rtmp\">\n</video>\n. Correct. Apple (and Google's Android) does not allow volume to be changed. They want users to have control using the hardware buttons.\n. Thanks for pointing that out. I removed the Google translate stuff (since they retired the API) and that likely caused the problem.\n. Thanks. This is fixed in the latest code and will be release soon.\n. Sounds like a good change to me. It could definitely be an option and then the URL would be in the <source> element. Any one have some URLs I can test? Or, better yet a fork I can just integrate?\n. Does this update solve your issue: https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/pull/574\n. I've added a flashStreamer option so you can do something like \n<video class=\"mejs-player\" data-mejsoptions='{flashStreamer:\"rtmp://170.93.143.150/rtplive/000109f6004b00a6004af03676235daa\"}'>\n     <source src=\"000109f6004b00a6004af03676235daa\" type=\"video/rtmp\">\n</video>\nor \n<video>\n     <source src=\"000109f6004b00a6004af03676235daa\" type=\"video/rtmp\">\n</video>\n<script>\n$('video').mediaelementplayer({flashStreamer:\"rtmp://170.93.143.150/rtplive/000109f6004b00a6004af03676235daa\"});\n</script>\n. I agree that makes more sense, but it would have required a lot more\nrearchitecting to parse attributes on the <source> tag.\n. Have you tried that? Does it work?\n. Looks awesome! Do you know if the figure element insertion will work on IE8 and lower? Those browsers often don't nest HTML5 elements correctly. \n. Fixed in 2.6.2\n. iPhone and Android 2 don't allow anything to be put on top of the video.\nHowever, iPads and Android 3 and 4 do allow this.\n. 1) WebVTT integration is mentioned http://mediaelementjs.com but it isn't clarified how to add it.\nYes, you just need to add a <track> element like the home page.\n2) elements include just: subtitles, captions, descriptions, chapters & metadata. In which case I think there's a problem with how you implemented it on the example site above. Shouldn't WebVTT files be captions rather than subtitles?\n- I know there is some debate over \"subtitles\" vs. \"captions\".\n3) The start language I'm assuming is a 2 character ISO code, right?\n- It just needs to be whatever you put in the track element.\n4) I'm unclear what Google Translate can do as it can't work from the video, but I'm assuming would have to go off of a pre-defined . It can't do the initial captioning, right?\n- Google removed this feature, so we took it out. I need to update the docs.\n5) Also, is there a way to provide a different audio tracks? Doesn't seem like HMTL5 has allowed for that:\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/html5/video.html#the-track-element\n- We don't have this built in yet.\n. Looks great!\nI'd love to build multiple audio tracks, but I'm  not sure when we'll do it because the specs are still being developed for native implementations.\n. Yes, we've added more controls to Flash's fullscreen, but they are not ordered the JavaScript controls. They are just static. I'd love to build that feature, but it's not on something I plan to do anytime soon. Would you like to contribute it?\n. @klodeckl fixed in 2.8.1\n. Please download the latest version\n. You're using 2.1. I'm not sure where you got it from,but the latest version is 2.6.1\n. If you're using a CMS plugin, the plugin author might not have updated in a while. Please ask the author to update the scripts\n. Sadly, Safari requires that Quicktime is installed before it will allow HTML5 tags to work. Silly right?\n. I'd love to switch to Flash, but Safari can't parse the inner <source> tags without quicktime so it's actually impossible :(\nGenerally, I've only seen this on developer's machines when they are just trying to quickly test Windows.\n. this is what the code already does. If 'no' then it supplies a download link.\n. Are you actually trying to remove the player?

Yes for iPad, no for iPhone.\nApple allows videos to play in a page with caption the iPad, but for iPhone video will always play fullscreen in the iOS media player without captions or other controls.

If not, then it means something in your CSS is doing that.\n. The trouble here is that there are really two different sets of controls.

I'll do some checking.\n. Your change fixed the script loading.\nIn my IE8 test, I see the Flash fallback. Is it possible you don't have Flash?\n. Yep, just use the following flags: \n// force iPad's native controls\n    iPadUseNativeControls: false,\n    // force iPad's native controls\n    iPhoneUseNativeControls: false, \n    // force iPad's native controls\n    AndroidUseNativeControls: false,\nJD\n. Both of these (change to space bar and the controls below) are good issues. Would you like to work on them?\n. $('video').mediaelementplayer({mode:'shim'});\n. Whoops. I read your first post as just wanting to force Flash.\nYou could do\nif (mejs.PluginDetector.hasPluginVersion('flash',[9,0,125]) {\n$('video').mediaelementplayer({mode:'shim'});\n} else {\n$('video').mediaelementplayer({mode:'auto'}); // default mode\n}\n}\n. Make sure you're on jQuery 1.7.2. 1.7.0 and 1.7.1 didn't work well with IE and MediaElement\n. Since this can't be merged, I went ahead and added the code manually. Thanks!\n. Unfortunately, Flash doesn't let you create a new object inside a <div> with display: none. So you need to wait and only hide the player once MediaElement.js is ready. Or, alternatively, only instantiate ME.js once the modal is visible.\n. This is an unfortunate issue with Flash and IE. \nTo make Flash go fullscreen, a user must click on the Flash movie itself. If the user clicks on an HTML button, we cannot send a command to Flash to enter fullscreen. In Firefox, we can tell the browser to make the fullscreen button \"see through\" so that the click goes down to the Flash movie automatically. But IE6-8 can't do this. So we have to show an alternate button (the \"Go Fullscreen\" label) that is actually in Fullscreen.\nIt's not our ideal, but so far it's the only way we can make all the browsers work and still have an HTML-based control bar that you can style with CSS. \n. If you have a WebM file, then Firefox's fullscreen will be in HTML-mode and the subtitles will display. However, if you only provide a MP4 file then Firefox will have to use Flash which doesn't have support for subtitles.\n. This is a good issue to bring up since it should be better, but the good news is that it's pretty easy for you to solve temporarily by using the the pluginPath parameter\n$('video').mediaelementplayer({pluginPath: '/PATH_TO_MY_SCRIPTS/'});\nThis bypasses the script detection.\n. Fellas,\nI have a test up here: http://mediaelementjs.com/lab/folder_test/ where I put only MP4 files to trigger Flash in IE and Firefox and I put all the scripts in a random directory _abc123 and then used pluginPath to make it all work. Is this what you guys are doing? If you're still having problems, send me an example so I can try to track down the issue. Thanks!\n. Could you give me an example? Maybe I need to turn off [audio] and [video] as short codes and only use [mejsaudio] and [mejsvideo]\n. Merged fix\n. Mmmm... Mine seems to be working.\n. Yes, it's always a challenge to balance bug fixes and features. In the last update, we fixed 5-6 bugs and introduces 1 new feature, but I'm not sure yet what is causing the problem you all are seeing.\nI also attempted to change the .fla file from CS 5.5 back to CS 5 so more people could work with it, but that may have cause the problem.\n. 2.8.1 fixes the fullscreen issue, but I can't replicate your needing to click play multiple times.\n. Seems like it should work. Do you have a demo somewhere?\n. Yes, the main thing you need to do is specify a \"type\" so the MEjs knows what kind of files you're going to send it. You can target an empty <video> tag or you can target a <div>.\n```\nClick me\n\n\nvar globalplayer = null;\n\nnew MediaElementPlayer('player1', {type: 'video/mp4', success: function(mediaElement, node, player) {\n   globalplayer = player;\n});\n\n$('#vidlink').on('click', function(e) {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    globalplayer.setSrc('myfile.mp4');\n    globalplayer.load();\n    globalplayer.play();\n    return false; \n});\n\n``\n. Sorry about that. This was a problem with jQuery 1.7.1. I updated to 1.7.2 and it's working now.\n. Unfortunately, it seems that HTML5 doesn't have quite as much control over how far out the buffer goes before it starts trying to play again.\n. Do you have an example?\n. I'm getting a 404 error...\n. Finally fixed in 2.8.2\n. sometimes the tagging in git doesn't get updated right. just check the mejs.version to see it.\n. I think it's better handled as part of the CSS, too. Thanks!\n. Do you have an example of this? \n. Do you have a demo of this?\n. Thanks @cadrewparfitt \n. You don't have flashmediaelement.swf on your site.\n. So you are using IE9 in IE8 mode, and it's not initiating flash? Do you have Flash installed? Have you allowed local files in Flash security?\n. Could you give an example?\n. The< object >` syntax is only there for people without javascript.\nIf you'd like to use ogg and flv, then you should do\n<video id='player' width='480' height='360' poster='' controls='controls' preload='none'> \n      <source src='test3.flv' type='video/flv'/>\n         <source src='test2.ogg' type='video/ogg'/>\n    </video>\n. Hmmm... I think you might need an initial width and heihgt for it to work.\n<video with=\"640\" height=\"360\" style=\"width:100%;height: 100%\">\n. I've made this change for 2.9.2\n. Here's the corrected code:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/H7X7X/\n. Looks like it didn't save. Try: http://jsfiddle.net/H7X7X/2/\nOr just \nnew MediaElementPlayer('.player_1', {success: function(media, node, player) {\n    // this will be undefined since it's the player with buttons\nalert(player.paused);\n    // this will be a real value since it's the underlying mediaelement\nalert(media.paused);\n}\n});\n\u200b```\n. Awesome change. Simple and elegant.\n. Unfortunately this is a limitation of IE. You'll need to provide your own means of resizing the iframe or force IE9 to use Flash mode so that it can enter fullscreen that way.\n. It's part of our next update 2.9.0\n. Just now as a matter of fact.\n. I think this is fixed in the current implementation. The problem is that using .show() doesn't help when the entire player is hidden.\n. Use the enablePluginSmoothing: true option. Smoothing can slow thing down, so it's off by default.\n. Yes, you could listen for the ended event and then show the poster.\n. There was a bug in the 2.9.2 (and maybe 2.9.1) version with IE based on the incorrect use of indexOf, but this was fixed. If you're still seeing it, please make sure you have the latest, then create a test case.\n. What error are you seeing.

Will be in 2.9.2\n. This is not coming from MediaElement.js\n. HTML5 is not designed to do this. You'd need to pre-authenticate before loading the player.\n. Unfortunately since these events are coming from the native HTML5 object (not MediaElement.js) it's not something we can fix.\n. Use \n<iframe src=\"myfile.html\" webkitallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n.

Great question.\nThe problem is that to initiate fullscreen in Flash, a user has to actually\nclick in the Flash object. You can't click an HTML DOM element, then send a\nsignal to Flash to enter fullscreen. MediaElement.js's controls are\nbuilding HTML, but Flash won't accept a fullscreen command from the\nfullscreen button. In Firefox+Flash, we can allow the click on the\nFullscreen button to fall through onto the Flash movie and it all looks\nfine. But in IE you can't do that. So we have to have a separate button in\nFlash that appears on rollover.\nHope that makes sense! I'm always open for other solutions!\nJD\nOn Tue, Jun 24, 2014 at 12:28 AM, Mike Dunlop notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nHi John, thanks for all the work that you've MEJS - it's great.

There are several issues, some of which are passed.\nOldIE doesn't have support for browser-based fullscreen, so using the\nplugin's fullscreen was desirable for most people even though this broke\nthe HTML controls. To keep the controls in HTML, you'd need to do \"full\nwindow\" rather than true fullscreen. I think this is best for legacy\nsupport going forward.\nOlder versions of Firefox also had a massive problem in that they didn't\nallow any DOM manipulation of plugins. So if you initiated true browser\nbased Fullscreen in Firefox 22 (or thereabouts) and tried to resize the\nplayer node, Firefox would reload/restart the plugin. So here again, rather\nthan doing fullwindow, we used the plugin's fullscreen capabilities. Now\nthat I think Firefox is \"fixed\" it would make more sense to never use the\nplugin's fullscreen capabilities and always use the true browser fullscreen\nin all cases.\nOn Wed, Apr 8, 2015 at 10:39 AM, aggiehavoc notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nNow, I am not sure what the desire is with usePluginFullScreen.

The code cleanup looks great! My only question is that the _alwaysShowControls variable was designed to be used when the flashmediaelement.swf was being used as a standalone flash player without making calls out to the the JS API (basically for that rare case when a browser doesn't have HTML5 or JavaScript enabled). Renaming it to controlsIsEnabled seems to have a slightly different meaning because the controls are always there, but they don't show unless Flash's fullscreen has been enabled. As long as that functionality still works, this is great.\nBy the way, I'm probably going to remove all the controls soon and require HTML controls for the player. This will mean no Flash fullscreen functionality, but I think it'll vastly simplify the codebase.\n. Right now that's going to break the existing functionality which is to show\nthe controls in fullscreen mode for older browsers like IE8. Long term, I\nagree that removing the controls is better and using a \"full window\"\napproach for browsers without the fullscreen API is best.\nOn Thu, Sep 17, 2015 at 9:07 AM, St\u00e9phane Diemer notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nHello,\nI think Flash HLS is using version v0.4.2.2 but I'm not sure.\nI took the last file when I updated it on 1st September so it should be\nv0.4.2.2.\nAbout the controls, when they are set to false using the \"controls\"\nsettings, they do not appear and are completely disabled (even in\nfullscreen).

In this case, the player will always default to loading the\nMP4 file, regardless of whether or not the HLS file is listed on top.\nI didn't see a way to prioritize which video file should load first (apart\nfrom which order the source is listed within the video tag).\nUnfortunately, this makes it where there's no way the HLS file will load\nas long as an mp4 is listed within the source list within any browser that\nrequires the flash fallback (such as Firefox).\nIdeally, what I'm looking to do here is have the HLS file be played as\nlong a person can play the HLS file within their browser (either HTML5 or\nFlash), and only play the MP4 as a fallback if neither are available.\nAny help on this would be appreciated. :) Please let me know if any\nfurther code samples or URLs are needed to properly reproduce this.\nThanks!\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/issues/1581.\n\n\nJohn Dyer - http://j.hn/\n.

It's a workaround that will do for now in\nthe nearterm.\nIn this case, though, it's not ideal. When it comes to browsers like\nSafari, they can play HLS natively. By setting mode:'auto_plugin', it makes\nthe system use the flash plugin when it can be playing the HLS file\nnatively.\nThe reason I'm looking to avoid this is that some browsers are either\nstarting to block Flash, or prompt for an okay to trust the domain to load\nthe flash player. In this case, I'm just looking for a path of least\nresistance, where it evaluates the following in order:\n1) Plays the HLS file through HTML5 if available.\notherwise\n2) Plays the HLS file through the flash player if flash is available.\notherwise\n3) Tries the option again using the next file listed as a source (in my\nexample, an MP4).\nI understand that this sort of logic may not be available in the player\nright now.

It sounds like if you want to use preload=metadata to get a poster image, it's going to slow down in the browser. but if you use preload=none or handle it dynamically you don't get a poster. Since this isn't directly related to MediaElement, I'm going to close this. \n. Are you sure the MIME type is correct? Firefox is more picky about this.\n. It's actually the unregisterPluginElement that's throwing the error, so we've removed that. Thanks!\n. Great! Lemme do some testing on this.\n. I downloaded your branch, opened up /test/test.html and set stretching: 'fill', and all the players (audio and video) collapsed and were not visible on screen. Using responsive or none or '' seems to work. Could you check on the fill mode?\n. I'd like to have it \"fail\" in a better manner than completely hiding the video (and/or audio). It'd probably be better if there isn't a height specified on the container just to use the default sizing.\n. Thanks. I'll get this in with a few other pulls.\n. This is looking great. I think I found the 2-3 places where the the changes are. I think I'll release with all of the other stuff first, and then do this as a second release with this in it.\n. THanks!\n. I like the overall idea of customizing the error message, but this seems to add a lot of code that already exists. There is already a detection method in mejs.PluginDetector for both flash and silverlight that does basically the same thing.\n. I just pushed the initial branch of 3.x which might make some of this redundant.\nFor this approach, the overall idea of a more customized error message is great. But the detection and order seems to need some revision.\nisSilverlightRequired = (options.plugins.indexOf('silverlight') > -1),\nThis isn't really checking if Silverlight is required. It's actually just checking if it's in the list of available plugins which by default is true unless someone takes it out.\nif (currVersion[0] < minVersion[0] || (currVersion[0] === minVersion[0] && currVersion[1] === minVersion[1] && currVersion[2] < minVersion[2])) {\nThis is repeating the detection that occurred in 240-275. I think it'd better to attach an error message there based on the detection. You could create an errorMessage on the result from determinePlayback based on the plugins.\n. I think the poster is supposed to show up on the HTML side, so we don't have to recode it again in Flash. If that's broken, let's fix it there rather than in Flash.\n. I'm not sure this solves the IE8 issue. The flash codes doesn't have anything that displays a poster, so adding image= do the initVars won't make it display anything. Or am I missing something?\n. In my tests, this didn't seem necessary. It was also nice just to be able to set it via the options and not have to change the CSS on all players. Does that make sense?\n. How is this different from using alwaysShowControls: true?\n. Would this be a good default behavior? I'm not sure why I thought it was a good idea to hide the controls when the video was paused...\n. Sorry, I meant instead of making this an option at all, wouldn't it be better as the default option? It is a little strange to have the controls hide when the video is paused.\n. Looks like startControlsTimer is called from the keyboard commands and from 645-670. Perhaps these should just each be configurable:\ncontrolsTimeoutDefault: 1500,\ncontrolsTimeoutMouseEnter: 2500,\ncontrolsTimeoutMouseLeave: 1000\n. @ale-grosselle, thanks for working on this. It looks like all the tabbing changed so I can't tell what's different. Can you restore the tabs so the change is visible?\n. For background audio, it seems like it'd better to just use the MediaElement object rather than use the player right?\n.

It's a ton of detailed changes, and I appreciate all that it took. \nProbably the biggest concern on this is that MediaElement is used in Wordpress and a variety of themes and plugins have popped up around it which customize ME.js's CSS. For example, all the sub themes at http://audiotheme.com/ rely on those classes. My worry is that if Wordpress tries to upgrade to 3.x, it will break all those dependencies.\nI agree with #1849 that reducing some of the complexity of the selectors would make theming easier and less bloated. \nI'm not totally against breaking changes, especially if it offers new functionality. The trick is figuring out when the tradeoff of new features vs. breaking is worth it, and that tradeoff is somewhat subjective. \nI'll reach out to some of those theme developers to see if any of them can weigh in on the changes. \nThanks again for supporting this project!\n. I haven't heard from the audiotheme developer, but I'm checking with the WP team before we make this one. Thanks!\n. Yeah, if it's backward compatible with WP and they're up for it, let's go.

For this one, it looks like we need to make another Flash audio element that uses NetStream and  NetConnection like the video element. I'll put in a pull request soon.. Looking into it more deeply, it looks like Flash's default capabilities do not include playing the type of AAC stream you're using. The Muses player team has written their own AAC player (https://github.com/fbricker/muses/blob/master/aac/AACSound.hx), so we'd need to import that to play HE-AAC. I'd like to look into this more, but probably not for this release.. Thanks @cjcolvar! This looks great. . I understand the setPlayerSize check, but I think we still need to call to the setControlsSize. Can you confirm it still fits?. Thanks for this. The change looks fine, but it needs to be in the /src/ folder, not the /build/ folder. Can you change that?. Looks like the original source is here https://github.com/mediaelement/mediaelement/blob/master/src/js/features/volume.js. Yes, we haven't had a lot of leadership on the project for a while. Rafael\ndid an awesome job, but I haven't kept up as much.\nIf you know of a great maintainer who'd like to clean things up, let me\nknow!\nOn Fri, Jan 18, 2019 at 9:28 PM Sascha Greuel notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nno, it's not. 10 months it's not enough to decide that the project is dead\nor not, so just give some time to the maintainer.\nBut not a single activity from now to then since March 2017?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/mediaelement/mediaelement/issues/2607#issuecomment-455745579,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AANE02l-RFjZxXdIUH5uOjGaeRzE9eS7ks5vEpDOgaJpZM4aE4Zg\n.\n\n\n-- \nJohn Dyer - http://j.hn/\n. Where is the zoomedWindowWidth variable coming from?\n. Is there a reason why this is here in the pre-init instead of somewhere like 355 where it's built? I'd like to move it there so it's together, but I wanted to double check first.\n. Why are you checking for the existence of the function? This will always be true? \nIf I change this to the correct if (t.hasFluidMode()) { then it fails pretty hard if it's false. This means you need to do both stretching: 'responsive' and use max-width:100%\n. I just removed the check for the function \"hasFluidMode\" so it works without that. \n. ",

Hi John;\nI'll look at the types in mediaelement.js.  \nThe file format works fine natively in Safari. I was using Safari as the baseline because it does work there. What I'm needing, ultimately, is to have it work everywhere else. Hopefully adding it to the mediatypes array does the trick. I'll keep you posted.\nThanks for the response.\n- Lee\n. John; I apologize, it does work, sort of, in Safari, without adding the specific type to mediaTypes.  \nIn the page I'm displaying a list of these 30 second samples. A working control is displayed in the first item in the list and non-working controls are displayed in the rest. When I start playing the first sample, all of the samples in the page are played concurrently, not just the single sample you'd expect.\nMy call to invoke the plugin is  $(document).ready(function(){  $(\"audio\").mediaelementplayer()};\nhere's a screen shot:\nhttp://www.hinde.net/mediaplayer.png\nThis is all fyi; I appreciate your efforts.

The problem occurs when I click the play button on an audio player. I think the call to this.pluginApi.playMedia(); is the problem. There is an unspecified error on line 49 char 5. The error occurs before fireEvent is called from flash.\nThis is flash specific. When silverlight is used there is no problem.\n. Turns out the problem is flash on 3 separate VM instances I have. Talk about a heck of a problem. Flash is partially broken in each of them (video files play fine but audio doesn't).\nSo, this is not really a problem.\n. While I think it is a pain there is an android emulator in the android sdk. http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html\nI thought of this because I used the iPhone emulator that comes with xcode to troubleshoot in iOS4 which I don't have.\n.

Don't know but I figured problems in FF, IE, Opera. After that small fix it workes properly in all browsers. I've debugged script for two days and was very surprised by such behavior.\n. It's my pleasure. Thank you for such a great component\n. Safari on Windows is popular for developers who like to test a website but dont have access to such devices. I am aware about the reasons why it won't work, but it took me a lot of time to find out.\nAccording to wikipedia all Apple products and Android based devices support m4a/acc, it has also a more friendly license for distribute content compared with mp3.\nIt's ok for me if mediaelement won't work with anything because I like simple & easy designed software/libraries. But its really helpful to have a complete list with all popular codecs. Oh, and OGG/Vorbis, thats REALLY missing!\n. I have been reading this long discussion about RTMP w subfolder, as I was using video.js until then and I need to have RTMP support ... so at this point what is the current code to be used ?

Hi Jon,\nWhen I tested originally, if you visited mediaelementjs.com it wouldn't load. I should have been more thorough though, as now everything seems to be OK with the extension in use. Maybe simply uninstalling and re-installing all my extensions is what fixed the problem.\nSorry for the false alarm!\nGeoff\n. And sorry for misspelling your name just then... I seem to be on a downward spiral...\n. how you made from the pause button, stop button with audio GET canceled?\n. +1 for me !\n. I've been dreaming of the play-stop button\n. it's that also available for iPhone  ?   it' seems that my (ended' event is not taken in account .. player plays the first clip , then stop  ( no clip ended triggered ..)\nthanks\n.

The strange thing is that the problem persists even if\nthe website (like http://mediaelementjs.com/) has a \"description\" meta\ntag:\n\nGoogle seems to ingore it and prefers to print that strange text\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/issues/1379#issuecomment-64881036\n.\n. Interesting. @lsvt-casey Any chance you can send me the recompiled SWF file so I can test if that solves the problem?\n. I couldn't say, as I'm not longer using mediaelement\n. My main point is, to emulate HTML API and to be transparent (so I do not need to check if thing is native or plugin), the interface not only of addEventListener but also of dispatchEvent should be the same. Do you think the same / are you accepting this as an issue / are you planning to make fixes to this? Thanks.\n. No, in fact it transparently reuses all additional arguments (including putting event as first one).\nThia is in fact a programming style - strict and defensive (use call with only event as an argument), or pass everything - more open and wild, but potentially future friendly.\nI don't know which is better ;-)\n. Tested on windows 8.1 and windows 7. All work fine.\nVersion of FF 40.0.2 was. In nightly 43.0a1 also work fine. Only asked some permission for flash.\n. i'll try to build on ubuntu. If build passed,i'll try to fix on windows.\nThanks\n. @johndyer hi, can you review this part of code.\nuse gulp for it, but can do it for grunt later\ngulp html5only-dev watch scss files.\ngulp sass:sort sort styles in gulpfile. Want to do file config for sorting plugin.\nmay be you have any ideas about it?\n. It actual right now. I have used last time PostCSS with sass syntax. Easy can play customization. If no objections i can do it on PreCSS with some plugins. \n. @ron666 \nthis issue must be reopened i working on it\nthank you\n. I'm still in the \"looking over the code and pretending I understand it\" stage with this, but if this pluginMediaElement.currentTime = event.currentTime = player.getCurrentTime(); is in there, maybe kill it and see if that helps?\n. Ah, good to know! And good call on leaving the .css in tact -- that's probably going to save me about five hours of confusion somewhere down the line. Glad you got it worked out!\n. We can track also different input in form, is they not focused?. Then by default will be player change state and can conflict  with components like sliders and carousels.\n. For old browsers used babel, This tool transform es6 code to es5.\n. @ron666 Yeah, looks correct. it can help anyway\n. i will consider it too but i think that will be better to do it for new theme. and clear styles with some fixes for current themes\n. @albell yeah! will be great to configure this\nthrough the \"config theme\". i mean either any fixed width or flexible(depends of container)\n. Do not merge it right now. Need to discuss some moment.\n1. Here added es6 transpiler but i don't change any js files\n2. it really personal opinion but what do you think about move to Gulp? \n3. Customization of themes. I will think how to make customization more comfortable.(#1666) rewrite it third time,\n\n@ron666 what do you think about it? \n. @ron666 What do you think about move to gulp instead grunt?\n. @ron666 i can do it except testing flash on mac. i working on windows 10 and have some troubles with it earlier \ud83d\ude1e \n. Also this PR include sorting styles and stylelint with configuration for sass\n. @albell\n. #1666 \n- Divide on few files\n- Added autoprefixer\n. @ron666 i don't agree that it's so complex. But i want to do simple customisation in any config file and depends of it you can create theme. It very simple customization but when you can describe size of buttons you will change style of player only in one place. SCSS very simple when use it only for simple customization.\n. It's really hard to work with pure CSS.\nFor alternative can be also css file in dist folder and src folder with styles on SCSS.\n. ",

Hi @johndyer - thanks for getting back to us!\nI've updated the PR with the build/ directory changes removed. Let me know if this looks good on your end!\n. Did this look okay to you?\n. Hey there! Pre and postroll support is here today! Check out mep-feature-ads.js and mep-feature-postroll.js and feel free to reopen and follow up if you have any additional questions.\n. Hi there - sorry you're having trouble!\nI just tested this out on the youtube demo included in the repo by doing the following in the console (after manually clicking \"play\" on the player):\njs\nmejs.players.mep_0.setMuted(true) // ( audio mutes )\nmejs.players.mep_0.media.muted // => true\nmejs.players.mep_0.setMuted(false) // ( audio returns )\nmejs.players.mep_0.media.muted // => false\nSo it seems to be working okay from that example. Since I'm currently trying to drastically reduce the amount of open issues, I'm going to close this for now. You're welcome to reopen the issue if you can follow up with a little more detailed example on steps to reproduce. Thanks! :cake:\n. Hi there! Check out mep-feature-ads and mep-feature-postroll in the repo for what we have as far as existing functionality.\nAs for midroll, overlay, and audio advertisements - we'd welcome any PRs along those lines.\nFeel free to reopen if you'd like to discuss further. :thumbsup: \n. Just pulled this myself and tested it - working great! +1 for merge\n. This looks good to me, but I think it may have gotten rolled in with your changes on #1249 since you did everything on master. Maybe we can just pull in #1249 as a combined PR (since it has all the commits) and close this one since it has that extra revert commit at the end?\n. Hi there!\nIt's true we have sort of a funky ignore section in our bower.json - this is because we run a manual build process that dumps files into build/ and we basically want only those files to be distributed.\nFeel free to reopen if you'd like to discuss further! :thumbsup: \n. Good catch - here ya go!\nhttps://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/releases/tag/2.15.1\n:necktie: \n. Whoops - good catch! Fixed this in f899a40a35c4c5618c3dfe90f8498e03ea225899\n. Glad this got all figured out! Closing. :banana: \n. Hi there! :wave: I can reproduce this on an iPhone 5 running iOS 7.1.2.\nI don't quite know what you mean by this though:\n\nthe lower one plays the video using mediaelement's player\n\nAs far as I can tell,  iPhone can only be play using a native player. Can you clarify that a bit?\nWhat I would recommend trying is setting a width and a height on your <video> element. It seems to me that the overlay is just being miscalculated.\nLet me know what you find!\n. > Yes, it seems the overlay was miscalculated. I set width=\"100%\" on the  element and now the double play buttons do not appear.\nHooray! :ok_woman: \n\nThis in fact is a little bothersome because even clicking the play icon in the lower left corner of the video screen doesn't do anything; before it would play using mediaelement player.\n\nHmm that does seem a little problematic - I'll circle back and take a look at that to see if we can make that a more reasonable user experience.\n. Hey there! I seem to recall a similar problem that was fixed in a recent ME.js release. Are you running the latest version?\nIf so, is it possible for you to link to a demo page where you see the problem occurring? Thanks!\n. Hi there!\nGood question - the controls attribute is important for the HTML5 semantics of the media tag on the page. For the native HTML5 audio players, it is the difference between the audio having a visible player and being invisible (e.g. autoplaying in the background).\nSo by including controls in either an <audio> or a <video> tag, you're indicating that your intent is to let the user manipulate the playback of the media themselves.\nYou're right - for now the ME.js managed controls don't hook on that attribute for behavior, but in the future it might be a good idea for us to respect the semantics of the standard.\nSo given all this, I'd recommend continuing to properly set the attribute when you expect playback controls.\nFeel free to reopen if you'd like to discuss further! :thumbsup:\n. Wow thanks for the comprehensive demo!\nDo you think you could provide a URL to a demo page or a snippet of code so that I can try to reproduce on my side?\n. Thanks for the examples, @slj! I converted those into jsfiddles and there is indeed a problem there:\n2.14.2 Version (:thumbsup:): http://jsfiddle.net/phinze/7vo0c3zt/\n2.15.1 Version (:scream_cat:): http://jsfiddle.net/phinze/s3vL6eLq/\nI think you're right that this demonstrates a separate issue. Want to spin one up for us?\n. Well actually I don't think it's necessarily a separate issue - we should probably just get the issue you demonstrated fixed here first, then see if that resolves your project-local problem. No need to open a fresh issue on an already-swamped project. ;)\n. Thanks for the report, and sorry you're having trouble with audio seeking.\nIs this behavior that you can reproduce on an android emulator or is it only present on the actual devices?\nJust trying to see if this is behavior we can consistently reproduce while working on the code - that would help a lot in figuring out what the issue is. :speaker: \n. Dang - I was hoping for emulator repro so we'd be able to debug together. :grinning: \nHave you checked a pure native HTML5 audio player on the device? I'd imagine that works AOK?\nJust trying to narrow down the issue.\n. Hey @chemerisuk sorry missed the alert here - I'm confused by the feedback your tester reported. If I'm reading it correctly, it sounds like like native HTML5 audio controls are also broken on these problematic devices?\nI'm really a n00b when it comes to flash on android, but one thing you could try out would be to add {mode: 'shim'} to the options when you initialize mediaelement like this. That should force ME.js to try the  flash player instead of the audio one. See if that gives you any different behavior?\nIf the flash player works okay - we might be able to do some sort of device detection workaround.\n. Hello! :wave: \nThis looks good - but I'm not sure of the state of the latest build process. So let's ping @johndyer to see.\n@johndyer - looks like the Builder.py script includes code to do this too:\nhttps://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/blob/master/src/Builder.py#L8-L9\nAre we fully moved over to a grunt-based build and that's removable dead code? What's the story? :book: :grinning: \n. Looks good to me, thanks!\n. ",

Excellent.  This works great.  I am setting the width to -1 so that it can be controlled through the CSS only.  Does that make sense? It allows me to make the player a fluid width of 100%.

I managed to get the video to play by manually setting the type to video/flv, but, of course, that's not an optimal solution for browser compatibility.\nThe Firebug console returns this error when I click on the video player controls:\njavascript error: b.mediaElement is undefined (line 13)\nAgain, this is using the WordPress plugin.\n. John, this is working great now. Thanks for the plugin update. \nAlso, for whatever reason, Firefox is now behaving as expected now too.\n. Turns out this still isn't working entirely. The content type works fine, but for some reason the entire query string is not being referenced.  It appears that the video tag is not using the query string variable Signature=XXXXXXX when making the request for the media file.  So, when the S3 permissions are set to Authenticated Users Only, the videos are inaccessible.\nI'm seeing the same behavior in Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.  When I watch the request in the Firebug net tab, I can see that signature variable is left off the request and the server is responding with a 403 restricted access status code. \nIt's all very odd, as I would expect the video element to call the remote resource just like any other element would.  Is there something in the mediaelements library that would alter the source string?\n. awesome. Thanks!\n. Getting closer, but still having problems. The signature variable is now being sent, but the signature value is being modified, so the request fails.\nHere's an example.  My original signature string:\n otm9%2BSJVQCRd%2F6mWoGbbT42lfvY%3D\nGets turned into this:\notm9+SJVQCRd/6mWoGbbT42lfvY=\nLooks like the Flash may be doing a conversion on what it thinks might be hex code?\n.

Still seing this issue on my live streams. After getting 'ended' event, JS wrapper performs setCurrentTime(0) and pause().

Thanks in advance!\n. I'm running into this issue when trying to embed MediaElementJS into an offline page ( file://... ), that seems to be the problem. Anyway, I think \"allowScriptAccess\" should be \"always\" to minimize the mess with cross-domain policy (e.g. when loading the swf from a separate domain for static files, or from a CDN).\n. Such hacks lead to unpredictable behavior and race conditions.\n. The same seems to be going on in the Flash backend. I'm currently comparing 2.0.0 and 2.0.5 files to find a bug that broke the streaming FLV playback. I see lots of flags representing a single state which should change in event handlers only. The flags are assigned all over the code and there is no way to know for sure in what state the program is at the moment.\n. Good!\n. Cannot do pull request now, but here's my piece of code to gain this functionallity. The method behaves three ways:\n- removes a single event listener if both eventName and callback are passed (useful for temporary handling);\n- all listeners of specified type if eventName is passed without callback;\n- every bound listener if nothing is passed (useful while destroying).\nIf needed, you may improve the method to take only callback as the first argument and loop through all bound listeners to find and remove it.\n(after addEventListener)\n    removeEventListener: function (eventName, callback) {\n        if (!eventName) { this.events = {}; return true; }\n        var callbacks = this.events[eventName];\n        if (!callbacks) return true;\n        if (!callback) { this.events[eventName] = []; return true; }\n        for (i = 0; i < callbacks.length; i++) {\n            if (callbacks[i] === callback) {\n                this.events[eventName].splice(i, 1);\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    },\nThough it is often not enough. There should be some way to tell Flash (!) what events the user code is interested in (and to turn off some unnesesary events). That is needed because, for example, IE-Flash bridge sometimes causes lags and memory leaks (even in IE9).\n. I've forgot a little issue that might happen: the prperties might not get updated in case no events are firing from Flash (e.g. 'timeupdate' is turned off).  This should also be considered. I don't know currently if it is enough to fire non-timer events to gain property updates. Maybe there should be an API request to Flash to update values of all properties that are exposed in MediaElement object but this request should be somehow initiated from the JavaScript side. This is of course an extension to HTML5 API but this may be nessesary for optimization purposes in rich apps that massively use the player API.\n. barrena, you must reference your function, not its name, as a variable.\n```\nfunction onTimeUpdate() { ... }\nt.media.addEventListener('timeupdate', onTimeUpdate);\nt.media.removeEventListener('timeupdate', onTimeUpdate);\n```\n. barrena, if you are creating a function, you have a reference to it. Store it in a variable or in an object to use the it later.\nIf you are trying to remove someone else's event listener (a function you didn't have a reference to), you are doing something wrong. I have to see more of your code to understand your problem clearly.\nThere are two common usecases for removeEventListener:\n- call after using addEventListener to remove a specific handler, then you must have a reference to the function you are removing. Example below:\n```\n  PlayerController.prototype._attachHandlers = function () { //< PlayerController is a class to control the player\n      var _this = this; //< reference to this for closures\n  if (!_this._onTimeUpdateHandler) { //< if the handler was not created\n      _this._onTimeUpdateHandler = function () { return _this._handleTimeUpdate.apply(_this, arguments); }; //< create an event handler closure\n      _this._mediaelement.addEventListener('timeupdate', _this._onTimeUpdateHandler); //< attach the handler\n  }\n\n};\n  PlayerController.prototype._detachHandlers = function () {\n      var _this = this; //< reference to this for closures\n  if (_this._onTimeUpdateHandler) { //< if the handler was created\n      _this._mediaelement.removeEventListener('timeupdate', _this._onTimeUpdateHandler); //< detach the handler\n      _this._onTimeUpdateHandler = null; //< release the handler reference\n  }\n\n};\n  PlayerController.prototype._handleTimeUpdate = function () { / TODO: timeupdate handler logic here / };\n  ```\n- call before destroing the object that triggers the events (must be called from a sort of destructor of that object), then every attached function is removed. Example below:\n```\n  MediaElement.prototype.destroy = function () { //< mediaelement destructor should look like this\n      this.removeEventListener(); //< detach all handlers\n  /* TODO: destructor logic here */\n\n};\n  ```\nOther usecases are breaking the architecture and may be used only as hacks or monkey-patches to some closed-source or non-extendable components.\n. Thanks for finding this. Could this be incorporated into MediaElement? As you don't use SwfObject internally and a user cannot determine what plugin was installed by MediaElement without hacking into, either you should use SwfObject for Flash or should provide a method for crossbrowser removal of the plugin element.\n. Any update on error reporting? #401 seems related.\n. Thanks.\n. You must be sure the Flash element is visible and in the view. Otherwise, Flash component itself may not initialize before it appears on the screen. That problem was seen in FF3.6 and IE8 and IE9 (only these and Chrome were tested). Chrome loads Flash ignoring its visibility, so in Chrome a hidden Flash element will initialize and subsequently call 'success'.\n. You may pass 'success' option which is a handler taking mediaElement as its first argument:\nThe following example may be found here: http://mediaelementjs.com/#api\n```\n// method that fires when the Flash or Silverlight object is ready\nsuccess: function (mediaElement, domObject) { \n// add event listener\nmediaElement.addEventListener('timeupdate', function(e) {\n\n    document.getElementById('current-time').innerHTML = mediaElement.currentTime;\n\n}, false);\n\n// call the play method\nmediaElement.play();\n\n},\n```\n.

That would probably only require a couple of lines in the \"createPlugin\" method.\nThe point is not to support browsers without JavaScript, but rather to be consistant with native HTML5 <audio|video> implementations.\n. In fact, I think this \"controls=true\" stuff doesn\u2019t work: when I add this to the FlashVars I do see some basic controls but it seems to disable the MediaElement API, which makes it unusable.\nUnless I\u2019m missing something here, would you consider re-opening this bug please?\nWith native <audio|video> elements it\u2019s possible to display the controls and use the MediaElement API.

And when the volumes set, I'll need to make it apply to both videos.\nPerhaps I should create my own volume control outside of the player?\n. Yeah, I meant if he's in the middle of changing the volume during the player switch. But what you've suggested is how I'll probably have to handle it, unless I create an independent volume control and work with my own slider / setting etc.\n. Somewhere else. I'm just testing with videos from around the web :)\n. Instead of display:none, why don't you position the parent container absolute, left:-9999px, top:-9999px; and have it be technically visible but realistically off the page?\n. Sure. For example, if I want to trigger some code 1 minute into the video, I would expect to use timeupdate. I couldn't use a setTimeout because of the pause and tracker controls. But once the code is executed, I want to free up the memory the event binding was using.\n. ffmpeg with libx264\nI'm using the command is 'ffmpeg -i INPUT -f mp4 -vcodec libx264 -acodec libmp3lame -vpre medium -vpre baseline -b BITRATE OUTPUT'\nIs this incorrect?

I was able to play all the streams I tried from the websites of major TV networks.  This leads me to believe that the server side implementation is the same regardless of whether MEJS is used or not. Perhaps knowing this, you'll be able to find some applicable documentation on another site?\n. @tommedema Sorry - I don't have any documentation references on this, and am honestly not familiar with the settings myself.\n. My apologies, the bug is a bit different (and much less severe). I was setting the current time to the duration, which triggers an \"end\" in the native video browser. Flash does something different - it loops back to the beginning and plays from there. This loop caused me to believe that it wasn't being set, but I was incorrect.\n. Yeah, I'm using the real thing. I'm at IE version 9.0.7930.16406.

    "Fab1en": "Hi\nI'm interested by RTMP support. I found a working demo in demo/mediaelement-stream.php, but I can't make it work with my own RTMP stream. My video is encoded in H264 and encapsulated in a MP4 file, served through a RTMP server, is this configuration supported ?\nIf yes, is it possible to integrate it in the real player (not only the shim like in the demo), and how ?\nThanks\n. Hi John\nI'm very happy to hear your interest about this feature.\nI've made some researches this week, and I now have a better picture of the situation. You can see here (http://www.archive.org/details/Kinetic_Art_Demo_Video) a MP4 video played with flowplayer and supporting HTTP pseudo streaming. The source file is http://www.archive.org/download/Kinetic_Art_Demo_Video/nym_512kb.mp4. I tested the video with jwplayer following the instructions given in the article mentioned above, and it is working well : I managed to go anywhere in the timeline without waiting for the download.\nI also tested the video with MediaElementJS. When a place on the timeline is clicked, the video start again at the beginning, as if it was the requested time offset. I think the issue is located in the ActionScript part : the video should be requested again, with an extra parameter in the GET request : start=30.0 to start at a 30 seconds offset. I'm not very familiar with ActionScript, but I don't think this will be very hard to implement. If you read the jwplayer article, you will see that some servers have a different parameter name such as starttime instead of start, so this parameter name should be configurable in some way.\nIf you need more details, here is an article about flowplayer pseudo streaming support : http://flowplayer.org/plugins/streaming/pseudostreaming.html\nI'm available if you need to help you implement and test this feature.\nThanks for your help\n. Unfortunately, I don't think this feature is available yet.\nI finally decided to use JWPlayer because enabling pseudo-streaming within flash was a key feature requested by my client. I am not a good flash programmer, so I cannot go into the code and add this feature myself, but I can help somebody to do that. \nThe JWPlayer code is open source, so we could find inspiration in it.\n. Hey, John, we need your help on this topic. Could you explain us how to compile the flash shim from the sources ? And where to start to implement this feature ? I know that there are alternatives to Flash Professional to compile .as files into swf but I don't know if we can use it on this project.\n. I can confirm that this is still an issue in version 2.16.2 and that JWPlayer is supporting this feature.\nYou can find more information in Pseudo Streaming in Flash article on JWPlayer website.\n. I can confirm this is still an issue in version 2.22.0. I used a MP4 video streamed from Akama\u00ef : with html5 player I can go to any place in the video and the player start almost instantly, whereas with flash (shim mode) I have to wait until the video is downloaded to the point I have clicked before it can start playing.\nIn HTML5 mode, I see that the requests have a \"Range\" header with \"bytes=27295744-\" value (the value change if I click in another place in the timeline). The response has a \"Content-Range\" header with \"\"bytes 27295744-29548843/29548844\" value and \"Content-length\" of \"2253100\". Does that help ?\n. Here is the url I used for testing : http://vodflash.tv5monde.com/focus/legendes/4fils.mp4.\nI ran the demo called \"MediaElementPlayer - Default\" with this URL on Firefox 48.0 (Ubuntu 16.04).\n. @ron666 : sorry for the delay.\nI don't know much about delivering video streaming over HTTP, so I'm afraid I cannot challenge your technical arguments. However, I know that some other video players provide the ability to seek a later point into HTML5 video without waiting the complete video file download up to that point. Look at this online demo using jPlayer : the html5 video is seekable, and is requested via http. When you look at the HTTP Request, it specifies a \"Range\" header : \nRequest URL:http://www.jplayer.org/video/webm/Big_Buck_Bunny_Trailer.webm\nRequest Method:GET\nStatus Code:206 Partial Content\nRemote Address:176.58.102.220:80\nRange:bytes=2719744-\nHere are some resources I found that could help you to understand how to implement this into MediaElementJS : \n- How to specify a playback range for HTML5 audio and video in Mozilla documentation.\n- The W3C specification for Media Source with a chapter about MediaElement extensions\n- The W3C specification for MediaElement seeking\nTo convince you that retrieving a video file starting at some point without downloading the whole file, try this : http://vodflash.tv5monde.com/focus/legendes/4fils.mp4#t=240\n. It seams I cannot reopen this issue.\n. This pull request has been rebased against the 2.10.3 tag.\n. @ron666 I did implement the changes in the src folder (see commit 5ec2e128), but then I build the code and committed the result (commit f253f70). Do you want that I remove this last commit from my PR ?\n. Thanks for your support !\nI saw on the dailymotion documentation that everything should be working via their javascript API. \nI managed today to add the video/dailymotion pseudo mime type support to display the video inside mejs by modifying me-namespace.js and me-shim.js. But mejs controls are not showing and I don't know where to look for to display them again. Do you have an idea ?\n. OK, I solved my issue : the controls were just hidden by the flash. \nI pushed a pull request. Could you have a look at it ?\nThanks\n. The proposed pull request adds support for DailyMotion video in Flash.\nIt would be really great if you could merge this !\nThanks.\n. > But I don't understand why in your web site, http://mediaelementjs.com/, the source code of the archive doesn't include the dailymotion case ?\n@JunkyDeLuxe This repo is not mine, I just forked it from johndyer/mediaelement. Only the pull request is mine, so it's normal that you found the code in the pull request and not on the website. I hope you will find it when John Dyer will be OK to merge my pull request.\n. This is now working in version 2.16.2 (might be fixed in previous versions as well)\n. ",

This is superseeded by https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/issues/1172.\n. I don't know about compiling, but to have the errors in English you could try:\nLANG=C mxmlc -o test.swf -- FlashMediaElement.as\n. The same question was here: https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/issues/1052\nHowever the answer didn't lead me to a successfull compilation.\nA quick \"compile how to\" would help people contributing to the Flash component I guess.\n. I'm progressing. I managed to compiled with \nbash\nLANG=C ../bin/mxmlc $s/src/flash/FlashMediaElement.as -compiler.debug=true -source-path $s/src/flash -o $s/build/flashmediaelement.swf -target-player=11.1 -static-link-runtime-shared-libraries=true -warnings=false -strict=false\nwith $s being the source path.\nHowever my own swf is only 24K (debug) whereas the distro is 28K.\nUsing the flash cli debugger I get:\n[Fault] exception, information=TypeError: Error #1009: Il est impossible d'acc\u00e9der \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ou \u00e0 la m\u00e9thode d'une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence d'objet nul.\nFault, FlashMediaElement() sur FlashMediaElement.as:197\n 197                    _fullscreenButton.visible = _isVideo;\nThe message in French means \"Unable to access property or method of a nul object reference\".\nI guess I'm missing some kind of link a compile time, but I have zero experience in AS3 so it's not obvious to me what to do.\n.

John I'd love to but I couldn't find out how to compile the flash plugin :(\nhttps://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/issues/1171\n. A cleaner solution would be:\nvar pid = $(mediaElement).parent('.mejs-video').attr('id');\nyou would get a string such as \"mep_0\" is it what you're looking for?\n. After a lot of testing I found out that it's working almost as advertised. To help the future readers I've started a wiki page:\nhttps://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/wiki/Features-status\n. I fixed the problem by setting videoWidth and videoHeight to 100% and defaultVideoHeight and defaultVideoWidth to the actual video dimensions.\n. Interesting suggestion, I didn't see any reference to such an option. What is it supposed to do? I tried passing the same url as my \"poster\" attribute but it had no effect.\n. What codec did you use?\n. Do you use the Flash player or the html5 player? also, did you try the playing the file with the basic html5 player or another web player?\n. That's exactly why I started trying to compile the flash component. However I couldn't compile it so I couldn't fix the bug...\n. I didn't look at the code but I'd say it's because Chrome doesn't advertise it (as I can see on http://html5test.com with mine, linux and win), even if indeed it can play mp4 (as we can see on http://caniuse.com/#search=mp4)\n.

Thanks for the complete answer. Do you think I can safetly remove thoses lines in my custom build and re-enable fullscreen?\n. Just tested fullscreen today with the current repository and it works for html5 but NOT for flash...\n. Nobody has a clue about that?\n. BTW fullscreen still doesn't work in flash :(\n. It was a long time ago (in a galaxy not so far away ;-) )...\nFor me HLS is now the only transport, so I haven't used MEJS since then. If HLS is now supported, I'll give it a try :-)\n. ",
    "braydonf": "On one hand I don't mind that it's like this because it hinges on the video element because it should be in the html source code, and the player is an enhancement upon it, rather than using the JavaScript to build it.\nHowever I think it would be reliable to store all the values in a data object, and then use another piece to read a video element and pass those values to mediaelementplayer and mediaelement.\nAt some point I might take a look doing this.\n.

Here is screenshot: https://skitch.com/pavelrisenberg/rktyt/sparrow\n. John, thanks. Navigation controls inside flash? I can probably look into AS sources then and find a problem. I can't really substitute display:none with visibility in my case.\nBy the way, IE8/XP works fine with controls, however shows black screen for video, while still playing sound.\n. I checked out last version of JS as well as rendered new flash component, however:\n1. Control duplication wasn't resolved in my configuration (Opera/Mac, Firefox Beta8/Mac). Unfortunately, I sorted it out on the level of my code. I'll probably look into player code some later.\n2. I also noticed random bug in flash component in IE8 that is due to _stream object being null when initializing in VideoElement.as:68, I added check:\n```\n   public function currentTime():Number {\n   if (_stream == null)\n       return 0;\n\n   return _stream.time;\n\n}         \n   ```\n3. Also about black screen for video (with working audio) in IE8: it was also caused by initializing player in JS while layer was in display: none. I have sorted it out, but can suggest to postpone calling 'createPlugin' method in 'HtmlMediaElementShim', binding it to the check (probably on setTimeout) if object have become visible (display: block).\nAnyway, thanks for great plugin John, pleasure using it!\n. (1) is dirty right now, but I look closer. I haven't yet figured out, why meReady is called every time flash is shown. \n(3) I was thinking more about of 'setInterval' check for object visibility before 'createPlugin' is called, if display is set to none at the time object initializes for the first time.

    "lehni": "John, thanks for formulating your thoughts on this. I was not aware that crossing the JavaScript / PlugIn bridge is so slow.\nI think the current structure of passing all the internal states from the plugin shims to the JavaScript side makes perfect sense then.\nThe only argument I would disagree with is the one about having to add 40 functions. If they are just getters / setters for internal properties and function calls to the plugin side, huge optimisations are possible. By assuming the the function calls to set properties are called the same on the JavaScript and Plugin sides, something like this would be possible for all the different shims / wrappers:\n```\nfunction capitalize(str) {\n    return str.replace(/\\b[a-z]/g, function(match) {\n        return match.toUpperCase();\n    });\n}\nvar proto = MyClass.prototype,\n    readWriteNames = ['muted', 'volume', 'currentTime', 'src'],\n    readOnlyNames = ['paused', 'ended', 'seeking', 'duration'],\n    i,\n    name,\n    capitalized;\nfor (i = 0, i < readWriteNames.length; i++) {\n    name = readWriteNames[i];\n    capitalized = capitalize(name);\nproto['get' + capitalized] = function() {\n    return this[name];\n}\n\nproto['set' + capitalized] = function(value) {\n    if (this.pluginApi != null) {\n        this.pluginApi['set' + capitalized](value);\n        this[name] = value;\n    }\n}\n\n}\nfor (i = 0, i < readOnlyNames.length; i++) {\n    name = readOnlyNames[i];\n    proto['get' + capitalize(name)] = function() {\n        return this[name];\n    }\n}\n```\nI still believe this would be the better way to do this and might even save space over the current version, as it automates function stubs for already existing getters / setters too, but obviously it would at this point break compatibility with existing code relying on direct property access.\n. What's more, the only part that is now relying on a given structure is the part about pluginApi. This could be automated further, covering all different versions of wrappers, by providing a setter producer function that produces a function that then actually sets the property. Something like this:\nfunction setterProducer(name, capitalized) {\n    return function(value) {\n        if (this.pluginApi != null) {\n            this.pluginApi['set' + capitalized](value);\n            this[name] = value;\n        }\n    }\n}\n. Yeah I am worried about compatibility too. Obviously it would break it. These are the main parts I am tempted to change in this great piece of software. But I guess before I spend the time on the changes, it makes sense to see with you first if you are even interested in changing it in such a way at this point. If done right I expect the changes would actually lead to a smaller size.\n. That's true. The addEventListener function could wrap the provided handler function in a closure that would do this conversion for us on the fly, and instead of directly installing the handler, the closure would be installed. This would mean the two would have to be linked somehow, as when removing the event again, the closure calling the handler will have to be removed instead of the actual handler, which would not be found in the list. Not sure this is making sense. \nI have quite a lot of experience with these kind of things, as I was making my own JavaScript framework for years, without ever really publicly announcing it. If you are curious, the code is here:\nhttps://github.com/lehni/bootstrap\nI use it in many of my projects, both on the client and server side (and other software too, such as http://scriptographer.org, a scripting plugin for Adobe Illustrator). I think it's a great library that deserves to be known, I just never get around to write about it ;)\n. Yeah, I agree with you... And your argumentation about the extension of native objects not touching the browsers who are bad at handling it is a valid one too, so I guess it should be fine this way. I can see if the generator / producer functions above can save some space otherwise though, might still come in handy!\n.

I was using colorbox jquery plugin, so I've put this code in cbox_cleanup callback just before the colorbox is removed from DOM on close.\n. I'm creating new MediaElement in onComplete callback. Works fine for me. The key point is to remove flash object correctly\n. Sorry, I can't publish the code.\n. ",
    "arisaves": "coagulant -- where did you apply your hack? i am loading inline videos with a colorbox & my debugger [IE8] is throwing a \"node is null & not an object\" error -- I think that this is due to the issue stated above, my player being unable to reinitialize in the colorbox.\n. I'm using the colorbox module for drupal & displaying my videos as inline content -- and they are turning up, but the controls don't work [hence the error being thrown] -- can't figure out how to bypass it. I'm confused; are you able to initialize the player properly on cbox_open?\n. I'd love to see an example of your implementation, if possible. I've been\nstuck on this for a few days.\n. are you sure you placed it in the OnComplete callback? I feel like all the\nelements get loaded before the script can fire. Also, how did you link to\nyour content & trigger the colorbox? If it was an inline div, did you use a\ncontaining div as a selector, or the video/player ID?\n. I was thinking more of an idea as to how you built your URL. Most people can't publish their commissioned code, I understand.\n. This is awesome, John. Thank you.\n. ",
    "localpcguy": "In the remove() function I was still getting an error in IE7 saying that \"Object doesn't support this action\" referencing the line:\ndelete t.node.player;  // Line #2988\nNot sure if this was the best fix, but I fixed it by wrapping a try/catch around it like so:\ntry {\n    delete t.node.player;\n} catch (e) {\n    t.node.player = undefined;\n}\n. Any update to this issue?\n. Was there ever a solution found for this problem?  Getting the same thing, it happens in IE7 after removing the audio element (as page changes).  Upon recreation of the same audio element, it throws this error.\n. That is correct, I finally solved the issue by using the mediaelement remove() method.  I still had an error, I commented with the fix I for that problem on issue #111 \n. I listed how I got it working earlier in the thread.  It isn't a perfect fix, but it was functional. https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/issues/530#issuecomment-18684328\n. ",

    "rafa8626": "Closing this issue to favor #1739 \n. @jabowery Thanks for pointing that. I'll add a number in the documentation. Just an FYI, 4.1.3 is coming soon, and Wordpress upgrade with MEJS is coming as well. In your case yes it's 4.1.2. Please star both https://github.com/mediaelement/mediaelement and https://github.com/mediaelement/mediaelement-plugins to continue improving the package and giving it more popularity; also tell your friends/coworkers/etc. that have a GitHub account to do the same to support the project, if you don't mind. It would be greatly appreciated it.. @jabowery Check https://github.com/mediaelement/mediaelement/edit/master/docs/installation.md to get better sense on how to update your WP installation. @Fab1en Is this still an issue?\n. @Fab1en Thanks for your help; we are currently working on some improvements for the Flash player; can you provide the URL you used for testing, so we know this is not an issue anymore once we finish? And what browser did you use for testing?\n. @Fab1en According to https://helpx.adobe.com/adobe-media-server/dev/configure-dynamic-streaming-live-streaming.html: \n\nDelivering content over HTTP is usually called \u201cprogressive download\u201d. The content must transfer from the server to the client in a progression from the beginning to the end of a file. A client cannot seek to a forward location until that location and all the data before it has downloaded. Delivering content over RTMP is called \u201cstreaming\u201d. The client creates a socket connection to the server (such as Adobe Media Server) over which the content is sent in a continuous stream. The client can seek to any point in the content instantly, regardless of how much data has been transferred. \n\nI've seen most of the major players using that approach. If you try to implement it just with HTTP doesn't work. You can seek but the player's position starts from the beginning\n. Closing this issue since no answer has been posted in more than 2 weeks.

I closed this one since the topic was related to Flash and my answers were pointing to that topic: I'll check what you found for HTML5 and see what we can do\n. @Fab1en To give you an update this seems to be fixed on 3.x-dev branch. Please test http://vodflash.tv5monde.com/focus/legendes/4fils.mp4#t=240 with that branch and let me know if it works for you. Thanks.\n. @Fab1en You can use test/player-full.html to test this\n.

Can you test this on 3.x-dev branch and check if it's an issue there please? That's the one I'm currently maintaining and it will be released soon. Well I see that in the link above you are still using 2.23.5 version, not 3.x-dev. If you can send me a URL like that so I can check it or modify it for you please do. I couldn't get the error you mentioned above using the CodePen link\n. I'm gonna take the code you have in CodePen and make a test file; once I have it ready I'll check if it is an issue, and if not, I'll post the code here. Please stand by for an update. Thanks. @daveyshindig Please check your CodePen. I updated the stylesheet and JS library to use the 3.x-dev branch and I confirmed it works properly (at least I see zeros and not NaN:NaN). Please test it and let me know. I thought the changes were saved but they didn't so I'm posting my code here:\nhtml\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en-us\">\n    <head>\n        <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\">\n        <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n        <title>MediaElement.js - video/audio unification library</title>\n        <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">\n        <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"https://rawgit.com/johndyer/mediaelement/3.x-dev/build/mediaelementplayer.min.css\">\n    </head>\n    <body>\n          <h4>First audio</h4>\n          <audio id='audio-player' src='http://stream.ktuh.org:8000/stream-mp3' type='audio/mp3' controls='controls'></audio>\n          <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.2.4/jquery.min.js\"></script>\n          <script src=\"https://rawgit.com/johndyer/mediaelement/3.x-dev/build/mediaelement-and-player.min.js\"></script>\n          <script>\n                  $(\"audio\").mediaelementplayer({\n                         alwaysShowControls: true,\n                         features: ['playpause', 'progress',  'volume', 'current'],\n                         enableProgressTooltip: false,\n                         audioWidth: 450,\n                         audioHeight: 70,\n                         iPadUseNativeControls: true,\n                         iPhoneUseNativeControls: true,\n                        AndroidUseNativeControls: true\n                   });\n          </script>\n</body>\n</html>\nHope this helps.

Thanks!\n. @koenpunt Is this still an issue?\n. @johndyer What are your thoughts about this?\n. I'd basically not put any media in the /media/ folder; just a README file that indicates that you need to download the media from  https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement-files to make the demos and test to work. Any thoughts on this?\n. Not common and problematic in my experience \n. @johndyer are we doing then the rewrite for 3.0 version? And if so I'd recommend not to put any files at all to keep the repo small\n. @koenpunt The history has been rewritten; please test and let me know if it works for you. Yes. Please look at the 3.x-dev branch and let me know I used the method above and seemed faster to me but let's confirm. Can this issue be closed?. The thing is that when you perform a rewrite you have to do it across all branches in a repo; meaning that right now master, 3.x-dev, etc, plus tags history was rewritten, because all of them had references to the removed files. So I don't know if the last part will be needed. And this is something only people that creates PR need to be aware of. Clone copies everything. If they get a clean clone the users who desire to contribute won't have any issues; if they had a prior version they need to do a git rebase first. And yes the tags had to be updated as well since they carried as well references to those files; I tried not to but in the end every time I pushed back the rewritten history there were references and didn't change the size of the repo. That's why even tags had to be updated. For more reference http://stevelorek.com/how-to-shrink-a-git-repository.html. 3.0 version released.

Thanks!\n. @szepeviktor Thanks for your comments. We'll look to implement this soon\n. @szepeviktor Can you provide some guidance about what's required to convert a plugin into a ES6 module, please? I'm not well familiarized with it\n. @szepeviktor Thanks I'll check this\n. @szepeviktor Please take a look into 3.x-dev-es6 branch and let me know what else needs to be placed there to make it work completely. This will be a second iteration once 3.x-dev branch is released\n. What I did was just to take all the code right now written and then translating it into ES6 entirely. I'm not creating a module; the code itself is in ES6 but given that I don't have a lot of experience with it I needed to know what else do I need to do.\n. @szepeviktor can you please start reviewing the mejs-ES6 branch and provide feedback about it? It's still work in progress but another pair of eyes will help me to speed this up; also the idea is to use Travis to test code. Yes, this was removed in a push I made today. @szepeviktor I only need to complete more unit tests and the file to test DOM and this feature will be ready 100%. Just FYI. Unit tests and DOM file for testing completed. Now all code is in ES6 specification and it will be pushed tomorrow as part of the 3.0 version.

If you have it sorted out, I'll hook the functionality to display it\n. @albell Can you please check the branch various-fixes to confirm this was integrated properly, please?. I based this on YouTube player, and it doesn't use an overlay; we could add it as part of the Play overlay, but I don't know if it will be too much to have the icon and the overlay.. @albell If nothing else to add, can I integrate what I have in 3.x-dev branch and close this issue?. @johndyer I added the button in the controls.svg; when you re-create the PR, consider that button as well. Thanks.. Closing issue since button is now part of 3.x-dev. @albell I just pushed the PR from @johndyer. Now we'll use new SVG sprite and preserving the other for backward compatibility. The PNG files are there but they are not used at all in our stylesheet. If any users wants to support old browsers, they could use that in their own custom stylesheet. @johndyer and @albell The \"legacy\" stylesheet also uses the new control bar styles and the old PNGs and GIF are now removed completely. Just FYI. The only PNGs we have is a sprite that matches the new SVG sprite just in case somebody wants to use them. @DavidPrevot Closing old issues. If you'd like to reopen this, let us know.

Feel free to test it and provide comments\n. Closing this issue to continue thread on #1609\n. @seewhy17 First of all, you need to call the mediaplayer and create an instance:\n``` javascript\n$('video').mediaelementplayer({\n  // Configuration\n});\nvar player = $('#mediaplayer')[0].player;\n```\nafter that, bind a click event on the thumbnails that sets a new source and plays the youtube video\nusing this approach with the player variable created above:\njavascript\n$document.on('click', '.thumbnail', function(e) {\n   // the workflow described in link\n   e.preventDefault();\n});\nWe are working on improving the YouTube set source, but this should do it. Let us know\n. @seewhy17 I created a PR that solves the issue with setting the source properly, not using the link above, but the true setSrc method (#1829).

Use QTIndexSwapper or FFMpeg to help you with this . Yes, probably. But also, can you do me a favor and comment the line of the play() method where it tries to load the media and see if that plays faster, please?. You are using mediaelement.js or mediaelement-and-player.js file?. And for what you describe sounds like the index of the file is not at the beginning of the file and that's why it takes longer to download.. Have you tried not to use the load() method and just play()? I don't know if that helps in your scenario. Other than that you might to share a URL so I can take a look into it.

Was this on a specific browser?\n. @ffoodd Probably. I'll test it today and let you know\n. @ffoodd Sorry for my late response. I played with this quite some time, and I found out that Firefox is not consistent on how it manages the keydown event. I have a PR on its way to fix this, but if you can provide any information about how FF manages keyboard events and how it prevents the events bubble effectively I can create something less \"hacky\", since I'm just targeting Firefox to prevent certain things\n. This is great information. I'll see what we can do with this, given that this is a browser related issue. Thanks for this info and I'll keep you posted on any progress\n. @ffoodd Sorry for the delay; I created a PR that solves this issue (#1848). Please test it and let me know if it works for you. Thanks.\n. Closing issue since fix has been merged\n. @cyberfunk Is this resolved?\n. @cyberfunk The GitHub repo @takid1412 pointed out above is a good example of how to display those buttons.

If you are using one, I think that could be a problem; otherwise, I've found that putting the mp4 or mp3 source and type within the audio/video tag works fine in IE8, and then you can have your other source tags. If this is not an issue anymore, can you close this ticket please?\n. @tesshsu Closing this issue since no answer has been posted in 2 weeks. If you'd like to reopen this, let us know.

Closing this issue since no answer has been posted in more than 2 weeks. If you'd like to reopen this, let us know. Thanks!\n. @SeventhCycle There's a PR that supports hls.js to play HLS natively if browser allows it (#1776). Feel free to test it and provide comments\n. @SeventhCycle Thanks for bringing this up. Currently in the 3.x-dev branch you will be able to play HLS files in browsers that don't support it natively by using Flash as a fallback. It's a really interesting scenario the one you are describing but let me know if the current state of the player works for you\n. @SeventhCycle To keep you on the loop, HLS will be played in old browsers. A proof I created to show this possible scenario is when you use M(PEG)-DASH and HLS together. On one set of browsers DASH will play perfectly but in old browsers HLS will be played as well as iOS\n. @ytrezq Can you test the latest version and check if this is still an issue, please?\n. @ytrezq I could test this through Browserstack using Microsoft Edge, but if you have at least one file you can provide that arose this issue so I can tell you for sure this was fixed, I'd appreciate it.\n. @ytrezq I'm finishing a new PR that improves documentation (#1805); let me know your thoughts\n. Closing issue since fix has been merged\n. @ytrezq Will this be an issue for the player? Is there a URL we can test any issues related to what you described here?\n. @ytrezq Unfortunately, it is not a way to play wmv and wma anymore. Major players such as JwPlayer, VideoJS and Flowplayer are not even considering this format at all, so we are dropping support for them as well, given that they are only-IE propieritary formats\n. @alenognjen or @CallMeRev  Is this still an issue?\n. @alenognjen I created a PR to solve this; you cannot use the minified version since it hasn't been compiled, but you can test it using the src/css/mediaelementplayer.css file directly. Let me know if it worked for you\n. Closing this issue since fix was merged\n. @che-effe We'll explore this and see how feasible is to be implemented\n. @crirus I'll check this and keep you posted, since I don't know if there are some specifics about how to stream from Facebook\n. @sobytes In the 3.x-dev branch we are only considering the approach of using video tag and iframe as well. Let me know if that works for you\n. Closing this issue since Facebook support is now part of 3.x-dev branch and no answer has been posted in more than 2 weeks. If you'd like to reopen this, let us know. Thanks!\n. @jilykate Closing this issue since line you stated has changed. We can always reopen it if you experience this in the future. Thanks!\n. @KULTI1995 Is this still an issue? Keep in mind that to display subtitles on iOS you need to transcode the VTT captions in the video. Android is a different story\n.

Closing this issue since no answer has been posted in more than 2 weeks. If you'd like to reopen this, let us know. Thanks!\n. This issue was moved to johndyer/mediaelement-plugins#5. @SeventhCycle Can you test this using the latest version of the package and confirm if this is still an issue, please?\n. @SeventhCycle thanks for your response; if you can send me a zip with the files it will be very useful\n. @SeventhCycle Sorry for not giving you an update before. About the absence of sounds I agree with you. That may be a Flash limitation as you stated. I'll be checking during these days the fullscreen issue and the loading when scrubbing ahead. I'll keep you posted\n. Thanks. I am currently checking some issues with the video dimensions so this can be part of it; I haven't had the time to check the scrubbing issue but I'll keep you posted. I haven't forgotten about this ;)\n. @SeventhCycle Can you check 3.x-dev branch and test if you have issues 2 and 3, please? I did some modification and since it's been my focus of development, I need to know if it's fixed there. Thanks in advance\n. Run grunt html5only in the root of your project and then run sh compile_swf.sh. The documentation about this is on the Contribution Guidelines for more information\n. @SeventhCycle Please make sure you download the latest version of the 3.x-dev branch and before you load the player use the following line:\njavascript\nmejs.Renderers.order = ['flash_video'];\nThat will ensure you are using Flash only. Use the test/flash.html file to test your issue as well. Let me know if it works for you.\n. Thanks. Let me review the code tomorrow morning and I'll give you an update so we address some of these issues together and close the loop on this\n. @SeventhCycle After checking all the code and your points, here are my answers:\n\nFor some reason, it doesn't seem to be loading the flash here.\n\nReason being is because either you the plugin can't find the right location for the Flash swf files; to do that just add these in the player configuration:\njavascript\n$('video, audio').mediaelementplayer({\n   pluginPath: '/path/to/build/'\n});\n\nThe mute button does not seem to work at all at the moment.\n\nI fixed this; the wrong value was passed and that's why it didn't work but it should. Thanks for pointing this\n\nScrubbing is same, unchanged. But I don't think you've addressed that yet. :).\n\nOnce you fix http://seventhcycle.net/mejs/shim_problem/, I strongly recommend you to test this on that URL since I fixed that for the full player, and you use previously the test/flash.html file and it uses a simple player and it doesn't integrate everything because it was meant to be used for simple testing purposes\n\nI've noticed some of the time when changing between fullscreen and regular size that the player bar seems to take up 100% of the screen. This means it's not properly scaling back down to the regular size. It may or may not have to do with the mouse hovering on the scrollbar when exiting out. Just wanted to give you a headsup on that one.\n\nSame as above\n\nFinally, is there any way to specify Renderers.order per player instance instead of globally? I figure I'd ask this since the way this works seems to be a pretty big change from 2.0.\n\nYes, there is a way. Read in the 3.x-dev branch the section related of Use of Renderers, inside the Usage document.\nThanks and let me know if you need more help setting your test file properly with the 3.x-dev branch\n. Indeed it is because of the version and since we haven't released this new version yet you won't find it on NPM \n. Until it's released the only thing you could do is trying to change the version number to the latest (2.23.4)and that will do the trick \n. Can this ticket be closed?\n. And thanks for testing this before launching the 3.0 version; all feedback is very welcome\n. @SeventhCycle I just tested your URL above and it worked for me on Chrome. So I'll focus on checking why FF is not working properly\n. OK I'll take a look and let you know my findings. Thanks\n. @SeventhCycle I found out what was the issue. Please download the latest version and you should be fine now\n. Ok  thanks for your time testing this. I will check the details but as it is right now I think the 3.0 version it's really solid. You can close this ticket as I am aware about the full screen issue and I'll keep you posted about any progress on the full screen issue\n.  Just create a separate bug and close this one so we can keep track of this particular issue thanks \n. @isantolin Is this still an issue?\n. @isantolin Thanks. Can you provide a URL when we can test this, please? And which browser(s) you experienced this?\n. @isantolin Thanks. To keep you on the loop, I figured out what is the problem: seems like a controlsresize events is being fired at the beginning and that causes to the next couple of lines (which incidentally happen to store some variables required in further steps) not to be saved. That's why the progress bar is not updated. I'm working on fixing this and I'll let you know when I have the PR ready so you can test it. Thanks!\n. @isantolin I have a PR that solves the issue (#1824). Please test it and let me know if it works for you. Thanks\n. @yatinrandive-lynda can you close this issue, please?\n. @floriano12 When you talk about mobile, you mean iOS? Because in order to play RTMP you need Flash and iOS doesn't support it\n. @floriano12 There's nothing to do with iOS; you have to switch to HLS in order to support them.\n. @floriano12 Check demo/mediaelementplayer-hls.html. Right now MediaElement can stream HLS. The trick here is how to generate the m3u8 file. My preference is always to use AWS services to do that. Check https://aws.amazon.com/elastictranscoder/ for more information. \n. @volodymyrl Can you provide a URL to test this, please?\n.

Thanks!\n. @johndyer I have a branch ready with the integration of hls.js with this amazing library. Feel free to check it and provide feedback (#1776).\n. 3.x-dev now has full support for native HLS; please consider testing in that branch\n. You can use any the test/hls.html file in the 3.x-dev branch. Let me know if it works for you\n. @SeventhCycle I just fixed that. If you download the latest version and try again that should be fixed\n. Thanks @FrankDaze for pointing this. I'll fix the first issue right now so you can test again\n. Ok please download the latest version and test please. I'll investigate about your issue with CORS and how to deal with it and keep you posted. Thanks\n. @FrankDaze My apologies I had a typo and I pushed without noticing it; please test it again\n. Can you provide the URL you are using to test this, please? I just updated 3,x-dev branch, so you may need to download the latest version\n. @FrankDaze In previous versions HLS was playing using Flash which had the crossdomain enabled. Here seems like there are no CORS headers. Please check this issue: https://github.com/dailymotion/hls.js/issues/322\nThe issue with MIME types was addressed a couple of  hours ago. Thanks\n. @shacharz You can configure the params for the native HLS like this:\njavascript\n$('video').mediaelementplayer({\n    hls: {\n      autoStartLoad: false,\n      // Any other config elements from https://github.com/dailymotion/hls.js/blob/master/API.md#fine-tuning\n   }\n})\nLet me know if that works for you\n. Within the success function in the ME instantiation, try to see if you can access that call:\njavascript\n$('video').mediaelementplayer({\n    hls: {\n      autoStartLoad: false,\n      // Any other config elements from https://github.com/dailymotion/hls.js/blob/master/API.md#fine-tuning\n   },\n   success: function(media) {\n        media.startLoad();\n   }\n})\nLet me know if that works for you\n. You are welcome; please keep me posted about your findings. I want to get this version as stable as possible\n. Can you try using media.originalNode to obtain the original file name? Today I'll check how to integrate the methods from HLS to the media instance \n. Try media.originalNode.getAttribute('src')\n. @FrankDaze Just for reference, there's a way to call the methods from hls.js but is not documented yet. I'll document that today.\n``` javascript\n$('video').mediaelementplayer({\n      pluginPath: '../build/',\n                hls: {\n                    debug: true,\n                    autoStartLoad: false\n                },\n                success: function(media, node) {\n                media.addEventListener('hlsMediaAttached', function() {\n                    console.log('Attached!');\n                });\n\n                // If you try to call startLoad before the manifest is parsed, it will display an error;\n                // so attaching new event\n                media.addEventListener('hlsManifestParsed', function() {\n\n                    media.hlsPlayer.startLoad(); // media.hlsPlayer can execute all the methods in hls.js\n\n                });\n            }\n\n});\n```\n. Sounds good. Keep me posted and thanks for testing this.\n. You are welcome. Glad everything is working for you.\n. @FrankDaze Thanks. I'll check it and integrate it in the core package\n. Sounds good. I think we will be ready soon to release this version. Thanks for testing it\n. Closing this issue since support is ready in 3.0 version and it will be released soon\n. @FrankDaze can you download the latest version and confirm everything is working as it should on your side, please? I found out some last bugs and I just need confirmation that we are still ok\n. Thanks \n. There's no parameter that can do only video. Only the entire player. You can check FitVids plugin and see if that suits your needs\n. Thanks I'll check this\n. Can you provide a URL where I can see how that fixes the issue before I integrate it, please?\n. Fix is in place now in core package. Thanks @FrankDaze \n. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36803176/how-to-prevent-the-play-request-was-interrupted-by-a-call-to-pause-error\n. I'll try to find more info about it but in my experience it hasn't prevented me to continue with the flow. I'll keep you posted about this. Thanks\n. Native HLS is supported on Win8 IE11+ and HLS.js bases its support on browsers with MSE otherwise it uses flashls to play it. There's no way around that\n. The only thing that will change is that instead of video tag you will have an object or embed tag; the rest of the layers on the video are the same and shouldn't affect the skinning\n. @FrankDaze If you are out of the success method, you can do something like this:\n``` javascript\nplayer = MediaElementPlayer (....);\n$('.add-new').click(function() {\n            player.mediaElement.pause();\n            player.mediaElement.setSrc('http://www.streambox.fr/playlists/x36xhzz/x36xhzz.m3u8');\n            player.mediaElement.load();\n            player.mediaElement.play();\n});\n```\nOtherwise, inside the success method should work with what you have, but you need to pause the player before setting new source.\n. When I tested on Browserstack I got this error.\n\nSeems like the MIME type in the server is not defined or not set properly for starters.\n. You must set them on level3.net and once set works for both native and Flash HLS ;)\n. You are welcome :)\n. I see. To be honest this might be a better question to post in the flashls project, since I don't 100% the details on how it works under your scenario, and I'd hate to give you the wrong answer. If you can post this in https://github.com/mangui/flashls the author answers fairly quickly. We can start from there\n. Great I'm glad you solved that. I see that you set the width and height from the configuration. Try not to set it at all; only from the video tag and see if that works. I'll investigate this anyways\n. In the video tag set width as 640; height as 360; and then add style=\"max-width:100%\"\n. Download the latest version and let me know if it works. There was a fix related to the way the rail is being calculated\n. Oh I see. I'll integrate that in the core package. Good catch BTW\n. Why minus 20px?\n. Can you try this for me and tell if works?\n``` javascript\nvar\n                controlElements = t.controls.children(),\n                margin = parseFloat(controlElements.children('.mejs-time-total').css('margin-left')),\n                siblingsWidth = 0\n            ;\n        rail.siblings().each(function () {\n            siblingsWidth += $(this).outerWidth(true);\n        });\n\n        siblingsWidth += margin;\n\n        // Substract the width of the feature siblings from time rail\n        rail.width('100%').width('-=' + siblingsWidth);\n\n```\n. Sorry, one of the lines is missing something\njavascript\nsiblingsWidth += margin;\nshould be\njavascript\nsiblingsWidth += (margin * 2);\n. Thanks I pushed this into the repo.\n. Ok let me check and let you know\n. I'll take a look today to the markup and see what's going on. I'll give you an update later\n. I tried to test the file in my local environment but I couldn't. One thing that occurred to me is related to #1790 where the RESOLUTION is not specified in the m3u8 file. After a resize the player right now doesn't have a way to bring it back to the original dimensions in Flash. Could you try with another HLS file to see if that happens as well, just to isolate this possibility? I tried others and look good to me on Flash\n. This is an example I tested on IE11 and looked good to me using Flash HLS:\n\n. Well, you can always trigger a resize event inside the success method:\njavascript\n$(window).trigger('resize');\n. There must be an event or property not defined, when is that error being triggered?\n. I don't know about the buttons. I haven't experienced issues with them\n. I will give it around 250 to 500 milliseconds to trigger the resize or you can attach the resize with an event such as canplay\n. I'll check that and let you know my findings\n. @FrankDaze I think the only thing you can do is to call media.load() inside the success method to display that loading behavior. HTML5 has itself a very different way to handle things than Flash, but I'd give it a try doing that. Let me know if it worked for you\n. @FrankDaze Thanks for pointing these things. I'll check them and integrate the necessary fixes today.\n. @FrankDaze I tried to reproduce the error stop on IE11 but I'm getting an error from the Ads\n\n. Ok I'll bring the 2 changes in the code package and let you know when you can test them. Thanks for your help\n. @FrankDaze your changes have been merged into the core packages. Thanks\n. @FrankDaze Indeed it will try to use YouTube renderer. I think in your case you need to write your own condition to avoid this type of file, and also use this in your configuration:\njavascript\n$('video').mediaelementplayer({\n    renderers: ['native_hls', 'flash_hls'],\n    // the rest of your config\n})\nThat way you are ensuring that you will only load the HLS renderer and it won't try to use YouTube renderer\n. @FrankDaze Glad you found the answer; for the orientation issue you might wanna try the window resize when orientation changes.\njavascript\n$(window).on('orientationchange', function() {\n    $(window).trigger('resize');\n});\n. @FrankDaze that one I have no idea; the resize should work across devices/browsers\n. Let me check that and ok keep you posted\n. @boustanihani I'm preparing a package.js for the 3.x-dev branch; once it's ready what is the next step, or is that all is needed?\n. @boustanihani A package.js file is now in place. Please let me know if that's enough to create a Meteor package. Right now the version is still on alpha and cannot be published on Meteor but as soon as it's released we'll do it. Just let me know if that's all we need. Thanks\n. Closing this issue since no answer has been posted in more than 2 weeks. If you'd like to reopen this, let us know.

Why would you consider to put them in a different folder?\n. @johndyer Thoughts about this one?\n. @schrolli I think this one is good to go \n. @schrolli Can you fix the conflicts on this PR, please?\n. @alankarmore Can you provide a URL to test this, please?

Thanks!\n. @etherElric can you provide a URL to test this, please?\n. @etherElric  This is more related to implementing hls.js to seek the live segment. There's a PR prepared for this (#1776). Please test it and let me know if it works for you\n. @etherElric Thanks for the update. I'll keep checking this and keep you updated\n. Sorry for the delay. If you check https://github.com/dailymotion/hls.js/blob/master/API.md there are some values for live streaming that are worth checking (all prefixed with live for reference. Please test this with the 3.x-dev branch and test those configuration files according to your needs via \njavascript\n$('video').mediaelementplayer({\n   hls: {\n       // any configuration accepted by HLS.js plugin\n   }\n});\nKeep me posted on your findings and hope this help you\n. Closing this issue since no answer has been posted in more than 2 weeks. If you'd like to reopen this, let us know. Thanks!\n. This is a good one to be included in 3-x.dev branch\n. There's work implemented on 3.x-dev branch that includes now M-DASH. Feel free to review and provide feedback. Thanks\n. @isantolin I'll create one in a minute\n. @isantolin Done\n. @isantolin Thanks for your help. Just keep in mind that for old browsers we don't have support on M-Dash, so I'm exploring dash.as as an alternative to play them using Flash, but is still an ongoing research\n. @isantolin Thanks for testing this. Results are expected, since M(PEG)-Dash will play in IE11 Win 8 and above. That's why I'm currently researching the possibility of creating a Flash fallback\n. @isantolin and @gavrochelegnou Thanks for the suggestions; I kinda agree with @gavrochelegnou since I've seen that for most users they tend to do a M(PEG)-Dash + HLS approach, since it's mode standardize HLS than M-Dash. So we can encourage the use of 2 sources (one M-Dash and another as a fallback, either MP4 or HLS). Let me know your thoughts about this, because that same principle for native HLS\n. @isantolin yes it's true. The fallback idea is the ideal scenario but it is also a limitation in terms of those technologies giving support to those new formats. If you find any sources related to integrate dash.as in a custom player and also if silver light can play m-dash let me know please. Meanwhile I'll continue working with what I know from Flash\n. @isantolin by the way have you thought on testing HLS and MPEG-Dash on mobile devices as well? That would help tremendously to increase the confidence on the release of the 3-x.dev branch\n. After more coding I determined to use the approach described by @gavrochelegnou now that the renderers have a smarter algorithm to play the first file they can play; please check /tests/mdash.html file and test it; as far as I saw there's no issues in terms of bandwidth \n. @gavrochelegnou and @isantolin We have support now for Native and Flash for M(PEG)-DASH.\n. Thanks @gavrochelegnou you will need to use the 3.x-dev branch to test this. We'll release this soon, but right now is not available on the master branch\n. Thanks for noticing this I'll check this issue and keep you posted\n. @gavrochelegnou I think this is more related to dash.js library than the player itself, since for the examples there's no <track> file added as a source so that's what the player can control; if they are embedded it's a different story. Would you mind to post an issue for the people on dash.js and let them know about this? If you want subtitles with Flash you'll need to add the <track> file and add a WebVTT file for them\n.

Anybody knows any hints about how to address this issue? As it is right now, I think only JWPlayer can display closed captioning in HLS but I wonder if someone has a better understanding about how to achieve this with MediaElementJS, given that is a really nice feature, and also a requirement for accesibility\n. @johndyer Any thoughts or plans to introduce this feature?\n. @johndyer Here's my example page: http://release3.medsims.com/medsims/hls.php\nLet me know if you need anything else from me. I'll keep a close eye on this one, since it's something our company really needs right now\n. @johndyer I changed the source of captioning and if I copy/paste that in my browser I can see the content of another VTT file not chunked; I don't know why it's not being loaded in the player. The real VTT files were encoded also in AWS Transcoder and it created an m3u8 file with the references of all the captioning files chunked for the sake of reading them properly. Does it have anything to do with this issue? @awrel34 I saw you code, but what caught my attention is that your files are mp4 and not .ts like mine; I don't know if that's why yours works and mine doesn't.\nAn example of the files we are using is this one:\nhttps://s3.amazonaws.com/medsims-hls-output/3485/bank_00-en.m3u8\nAny guidance on what we are doing wrong would be really appreciate it\n. @johndyer I used local files for MediaElementJS and it seemed to do the trick; do I need to get the JS files in the same directory as the swf files to make it work?\n. @johndyer Thanks for looking at this; my problem was in another part of the code we created that was preventing the displaying of closed captioning in our system. This is really an awesome player!\n. @a4jp-com Change the pauseOtherPlayers options to false and test it. Let us know if that worked for you\n. @MicJarek I created a PR that solves this issue by adding a configuration flag to enable/disable the tooltip on progress bar (#1830).

If you remove the configuration element and fix conflicts we can review this again. Also test.html should be working fine by this point.

Can this issue be closed, @vykulakov?\n. @vykulakov My apologies I didn't notice you were using Flash; which browser are you using to test this? Also, I have a PR (#1780) that solves one issue with the Flash fallback. Take a look and check if it solves your issue.\n. Did you use the pull request branch I indicated above? Do you have a URL I can look at?\n. Is there a way you can provide me the URL so I can check it with Firebug? Seems like it could be a style on one of the layers\n. Ok. Try adding this CSS: \n.mejs-poster {display: block !important};\nIf you want to get the poster image to cover the whole player and avoid the black bars, try adding after the line above this one:\n:root .mejs-poster img {display: block !important};\nLet me know if it worked for you\n. Even if you removed the !important attribute?\n. @vykulakov I haven't been able to create a demo from my machine, but I thought this might help:\njavascript\nnew MediaElementPlayer('#camera', {\n    ...\n        success: function(media, dom) {\n              media.addEventListener('canplay', function() {\n                   $(dom).closest('.mejs-container').find('.mejs-poster').show();\n              });\n       }\n});\n. @vykulakov I finally made this work. First add 2 classes in your CSS like this:\ncss\n.show {display: block !important};\n.hide {display: none; }\nthen, modify your success method like this:\njavascript\nsuccess: function(media, dom) {\n       $(dom).closest('.mejs-container').find('.mejs-poster').addClass('show');\n        media.addEventListener('timeupdate', function() {\n             if (media.currentTime > 0.5) {\n                 $(dom).closest('.mejs-container').find('.mejs-poster')\n                             .removeClass('show').addClass('hide');\n             }\n         });\n}\n. @vykulakov Unfortunately there's nothing else to do, since this has something to do with your streaming system. I tested rtmp://dev.wowza.longtailvideo.com/vod/definst/sintel/640.mp4 and it doesn't display a black screen when starting to play. \n. Feel free to close this issue, since this is not related to the player itself\n. I tried the URL on an iPhone and it works. Can you confirm if this is still an issue? If not can you close it please?\n. Probably I tried with an iPhone 5s latest version and everything played correctly.\n. Test without a proxy and let me know if it's still an issue since I haven't been able to reproduce it\n. Great! Can you close this issue please?\n. @a4jp-com Can you provide a URL to test this, please? Is this still an issue?\n. Closing this issue since no answer has been posted in more than 2 weeks.

Is there anything there you consider relevant to be integrated at least on development? Or can they be removed?\n. @isantolin Closing issue since the branches mentioned above have been removed\n. Seems like the contributors list is based on number of commits and additions. You have only one commit.

Thanks\n. @wschwaiger We'll check this and keep you posted. Thanks\n. @wschwaiger I tested this on Safari and worked using something like this:\njavascript\nmediaElement.addEventListener('canplay', function() {\n  mediaElement.setCurrentTime(5);\n});\nor this:\njavascript\nmediaElement.load();\nmediaElement.setCurrentTime(5);\nLet me know if that works for you\n. Do you have a URL we can check? I tried with the approach mentioned above and it worked for me\n. @wschwaiger I think the only thing I noticed is the 'use strict' at the beginning of your code. My only recommendation for testing purposes is to get rid of it and add an event\njavascript\nmediaElement.addEventListener('canplay', function() {\n  mediaElement.setCurrentTime(timePlayed);\n});\nLet me know\n. @wschwaiger I'll take a look into your your source code and see what's going on, and I'll let you know\n. @wschwaiger Sorry for not giving an update. My only suggestion is to try to enable the call twice to see if that fixes it. It's a little hard to see what else is in the rest of the code giving that it's compressed. Let me know if it works for you\n. Closing this issue since no answer has been posted in more than 2 weeks. If you'd like to reopen this, let us know.

Check demo/mediaelementplayer-stretching.html; the parameters are there, and if you wanna restrict the player to a certain container, just set the width and height of the container\n. I will take a look on that and let you know. Do you have a test URL that I can check?\n. You have to remember that the 100% values are to make the video responsive. If the plugin finds them, it's gonna try to make the video responsive \n. Closing this issue per comments above. If you'd like to reopen this, let us know. Thanks!\n. @krobing The fix was integrated on last release. can you close this issue, please?\n. @miklu521 You can use jQuery to bind events on your document's body\n$('body').on('keydown', function(e) {\n   player.trigger('keydown');\n});\nplayer in this case must be the instance of the active player.

Just for reference when would this fix be available once I resubmit it? Just because we rely on this fix for a production system\n. @johndyer Also, I noticed that you haven't tag your latest release.

I'm gonna recreate this branch, since it's still giving me conflicts for some reason. I'll let you know when it's ready but shouldn't take me more than 15 min\n. @ale-grosselle I think this has to do with the fact that fullscreen needs to be detected when there's user interaction. \n. #1811\n. @ale-grosselle Please test PR #1811 and let us know if that works for you\n. @frontendpm I have a fix branch for this (#1783) please test it and let me know if it works for you\n. @frontendpm The fix has been merged, can you please close this issue?\n. @mwjigar Check demo/mediaelement-hls.html; the player supports m3u8 files as well.

I'm fixing right now the tabs you mentioned\n. @johndyer I completed the changes for tabs. Thanks for pointing it out\n. @johndyer The 'fill' mode works if the video tag is actually enclosed within a div or other container with fixed dimensions. I added to your #video-container tag a dimension of width:700px and height:500px, and it worked. I'm gonna create a demo file for this. Let me know if it works for you\n. @johndyer OK let me work on that. I might have it ready tomorrow, so we can move forward with this\n. @johndyer Done. Please review it and let me know if we can move forward with this one. Thanks again\n. Is it good to be merged, @johndyer?\n. Thanks!\n. @johndyer Any thoughts on this? I'm not an expert on Flash/Actionscript\n. @jaepage Just follow the instructions on compile_swf.sh and you won't need to do this; after that run grunt html5only\n. @johndyer This is still work in progress, but in case you are interested to see what I'm doing and provide more feedback about it\n. @johndyer This branch is ready for your review; please let me know your thoughts. Thanks.\n. Great! I'm looking forward to get this merge. Please keep me posted about this. Thanks\n. @johndyer Is this one good to go?\n. @axnd Thanks for pointing this. Merge issues fixed\n. HLS.js only supports MSE events so Chromium, IE10 and below won't support it. For those Flash fallback will be used\n. Please test this on 3.x-dev branch and let me know your feedback. Thanks for testing this\n. @isantolin did you test the 3.x-dev for these results? Or just this PR?\n. Oh nevermind I see that you tested the other branch I'll check those results. Thanks.\n. @isantolin I fixed all the issues but the Chromium one. That's more related to the browser capabilities than the plugin itself (https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=315566). Please test again and let me know. Thanks\n. @isantolin Thanks for re-testing this. At this point, I need to integrate error mechanism when Flash is disabled and that would be it to complete this ticket\n. Closing this PR to favor work on 3.x-dev branch\n. @johndyer Please check the last commit; I don't know why is showing previous commits when I pushed this request branch. Thanks\n. Closing PR since issue couldn't be reproducible\n. @johndyer Please check the last 2 commits; I don't know why is pushing previous commits in this feature branch. Thanks.\n. Are you talking about using the PluginDetector.hasPluginVersion method? Or detectPlugin?\n. Nevermind. I see what you are saying. I'll use your methods, and remove the ones I created so you can review it one more time\n. @johndyer Ready for your review. Let me know your thoughts\n. @johndyer Is this one good to go?\n. @johndyer Thanks for the feedback; I'll review the 3.xx branch and see how can we adjust this\n. Closing this PR since work will be performed in 3.x-dev branch\n. @johndyer Please review the last commit; again, don't know why it's pulling more commits to the list. Thanks\n. The poster shows up in HTML, but the thing is that the Flash object is created and it leaves the image variable out. This is more like integrating a missing piece in Javascript that creates the Flash object than in Flash itself. Is that what you are talking about in your last sentence?\n. @johndyer I saw this in multiple players that used flash and that is the way they ensure to display the poster image\n. @johndyer Is this one good to go?\n. @johndyer I tested this on the test-youtube file adding an external image, and I was able to see it by just adding that image variable; otherwise it is not displaying. Let me know if it works for you.\n. Closing this PR since in my last test the poster was being displayed\n. @johndyer I added a validation to check if the CSS needed to make the media responsive were set; otherwise, the plugin will add them. Please check the last 2 commits and let me know if this one can be merged immediately as a missing step for the stretching mechanism branch. Thanks\n. I see. So you consider I should close this one?\n. @johndyer Check the last commit in this list. Please let me know if this one can be released immediately. Thanks. \n. @marjune163 Thanks for reporting this. Seems like this is leftover code from past development. I'll create a PR to remove it since I confirmed that it doesn't impact anything\n. @johndyer Please check the last commit; I don't know why is pushing previous commits in this feature branch. Thanks.\n. The thing is that alwaysShowControls always leaves visible the controls (no matter if the video is playing or paused); this one, hides them when the video is playing and with this small addition you leave them visible when the video is paused. Once the video plays again, the controls are hidden (like Netflix, Amazon and others)\n. well I've seen this behavior in many of the major players in the market, that's why I figured we could integrate it\n. Check Netflix or Amazon's player. Although they include more features when you pause the video, you see the controls. Also the default behavior right now is false, so changing that in the options will enable that, so it won't disturb any current behaviors\n. @johndyer I fixed some typos, that's why you saw that as a default behavior. My apologies\n. @johndyer Is this one good to go?\n. @johndyer My bad. Yeah I agree with you. Let me revert the change\n. @johndyer Done.\n. @johndyer Please check the last commit; I don't know why is pushing previous commits in this feature branch. Thanks.\n. @johndyer Is this one good to go?\n. @johndyer I like the idea. I'll add them so this can be merged\n. @johndyer Done. Can you review this please?\n. @johndyer Is this one now good to be merged?\n. hi @hamedmoody you are talking about creating a theme. And that is possible using CSS and some Javascript to format time and the name you are displaying in the control bar. About the icon on the right, that looks like a custom plugin. Take a look at http://mediaelementjs.com/examples/?name=loop to have more reference about how to do it. And https://designshack.net/articles/css/custom-html5-audio-element-ui/ to see how to style the player in terms of CSS\n. Can you close this issue if you have no more questions, please?\n. @lucozhao Thanks for reporting this; we'll check how to release the translations in the following releases\n. @lucozhao I created a PR that makes the translations available (#1834). Please test it and let me know if it works for you\n. Closing this issue since fix has been merged\n. @ale-grosselle Closing this since it is now merged on the master branch\n. @ale-groselle could you provide a URL with an HLS file to test this and make sure we will cover thos scenario for the 3.x-dev branch we are currently working, please?\n. My apologies I thought the link you provided above didn't work anymore\n. Yes it does\n. @ideag Any suggestions for a library that allows this?\n. @swissspidy Thanks, I'll take a look to them\n. @OlivierJaquemet I'm working on replacing the current i18n implementation with something similar but simplistic, given that for our needs we just need basic translations and the plurals. I'll keep you posted about this.\n. Closing this one since fix has been merged\n. @johndyer I think this is solid\n. @moloko Can you test 3.x-dev branch and confirm if this is an issue, please? I'm working almost 100% on that branch to release it ASAP\n. @moloko Thanks for testing. I'll just indicate that this is fixed on 3.x-dev branch and close this ticket\n. @Kaito23 Can you provide a URL to test this, please?\n. Closing this issue since no answer has been posted in more than 2 weeks. If you'd like to reopen this, let us know. Thanks!\n. @johndyer correct. Do I need to implement anything else?\n. @isantolin Yeah I don't know why it was closed. The fix is there, just need to define the ultimate solution for what @johndyer stated in his last comment\n. @isantolin and @johndyer just FYI the workflow described in case no features are specified for an audio media is in place now (just create a MediaElement object rather than the whole player and hide it completely). \n. @johndyer This is one is good to go\n. Closing PR to favor #1800\n. @johndyer I think this one is very solid now. Can you review this and provide your feedback, please?\n. @asker2410 Get the content on a file (i.e, media.php) and make sure you set the right headers, specially Content-Type (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20022517/how-to-play-a-video-in-a-database-blob-using-php).\nIf you are using ASP.net, read http://www.aspsnippets.com/Articles/Upload-Save-Retrieve-and-Play-MP4-Video-files-with-live-streaming-from-Database-in-ASPNet-using-C-and-VBNet.aspx.\nAfter that just reference the file in the src attribute in the video tag.\nhtml\n<video id=\"player\" src=\"media.php\" type=\"video/mp4\" controls>\nLet us know and close this issue if it worked\n. @asker2410 https://coderanch.com/t/518509/JDBC/databases/store-retrieve-video-file-database\n. @hkasera The way to include it is by adding a reference to your feature after this line:\nhttps://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L61\n. Can you provide a URL where we can check this issue please?\n. Can you provide a URL where we can check this issue please?\n. @hikrishn Unfortunately this issue is difficult to replicate on my end given that I don't have a server with those specifications; on a side note, I'm not sure if a wav file can be played on IOS, given that the default supported types are mp4, mp3 and m3u8\n. Closing this issue since no answer has been posted in more than 2 weeks. If you'd like to reopen this, let us know. Thanks!\n. @MelAntipam Thanks for reporting this. Can you provide a URL where we can test this, please?\n. Thanks. I'll take a look and keep you posted\n. @MelAntipam I created a PR that seems to fix this issue (#1828). Please test it and let me know. Don't use the build files, since it's not compiled yet. Take a look at the /test/ folder to know which files to load on the header to test this\n. @MelAntipam My apologies; I found other issue on this, so I need to come back and fix the PR. I'll let you know when it's ready\n. @MelAntipam Try to change the following line:\njavascript\nnewHeight = t.isVideo || !t.options.autosizeProgress ? parseInt(parentWidth * nativeHeight/nativeWidth, 10) : nativeHeight;\nwith:\njavascript\nnewHeight = t.isVideo || !t.options.autosizeProgress ? parseInt(parentWidth/(nativeWidth/nativeHeight), 10) : nativeHeight;\nand let me know if that works so I can create a new PR to fix this issue\n. @MelAntipam Exactly. The line I sent you above is related to #1714 fix without including any options. That's why I asked you to change it to play with resizing dimensions, and therefore, push this as a PR, since I saw more issues being posted related to the player size.\n. Thanks for the work in this. I may need to play with your solution to account for more scenarios but if you can think about any other let me know since this is a valuable fix that needs to be released as soon as possible \n. @MelAntipam Sorry for my late update. If you can test this issue on the 3.x-dev branch I'd appreciate it, given that right now is my major focus to release that branch, and all the major fixes and improvements are being done there \n. Closing this issue since no answer has been posted in more than 2 weeks and workflow has been implemented in 3.x-dev version. If you'd like to reopen this, let us know. Thanks!\n. @astephenb Thanks for the work on this PR; however, per comments on #1764 and because of the existence of PR #1815 that addressed the issue completely, we'll close this PR. Thanks much!\n. @martingaudioso Thanks for noticing this. We'll integrate this in a future release\n. @martingaudioso PR created to solve this issue (#1813). Please test it and let us know. It will be merged in the next release\n. @hkasera Thanks so much! Please just make sure no changes are done to any files on the /build/ folder; always in the /src/ folder, please\n. Can you just revert the changes on the /build/ folder please so I can merge this PR please?\n. Thanks for your quick response; I see a conflict in demo/index.html file. Please correct it and it will be ready to be merged in the next release\n. Thanks for your work on this. I'll merge this by the end of next week\n. Thanks for the work on this. Just make sure that none of the files on the /build/ folder are modified and it will be good\n. @bzb2 Thanks for pointing this. We'll explore this issue and keep you posted\n. @bzb2  Thanks for your patience. I created a PR that solves this issue (#1843). Please test it and let me know.\n. Closing this issue since PR was merged and per comments on #1843\n. @bzb2 Thanks for pointing this. I know that CORS need to be enabled in order to get subtitles to work, or having them in the same domain as the player is. Regardless of that, I'm going to add this as a part of a PR related to documentation improvements. Feel free to take a look at #1805\n. Closing issue since fix has been merged\n. @astephenb Thanks for the work on this PR. Can you explain in what scenarios this is necessary?\n. @astephenb Has this been tested across different browsers, including IE8? I just wanna make sure we are covered in most of the browsers if we merge this\n. @astephenb In order to merge this you need to ensure that old IE browsers (starting from 8) won't have any errors, given that we are supporting them\n. @astephenb If you can implement the support for IE8 posted in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8334286/cross-browser-compare-document-position, I can merge this\n. @astephenb Yes I'm OK with that. Just integrate that and fix conflicts and I'll merge this PR\n. @astephenb Any updates on this?\n. @astephenb I think it is good; just fix the conflicts and it could be merged for this next release. Did you tested this on IE8 with the last fix you submitted?\n. OK I'll try to check it tonight on IE8 to close the loop on this and merge it. Thanks\n. @astephenb I tested this and works fine; the last comment I have is that this method should be part of the Utilities instead of being at the top of the player file. If you change that I'll merge this PR definitely\n. @astephenb Thanks merged now\n. Thanks for pointing this out. There's a PR related to improve the documentation feel free to check it and let me know if that works for you #1805\n. @paulozoom If you want to create a PR for this, let me know; otherwise, I'll check this. Thanks.\n. @paulozoom  No I haven't seen this before, if you have a URL we can test, I'd appreciate it\n. I think for the sake of simplicity I'd go with the first option you mentioned above but I'll tests it to make sure\n. I don't have a file that lasts that long to test this, can you provide one?\n. @paulozoom I prepared a PR that solves this (#1826). Test it and let me know if it works\n. Closing issue since fix has been merged\n. @johndyer Can you update to 2.23.0, please?\n. @isantolin I checked these files and, although they might be removed, they are not harming anything since they are not part of the build process. @johndyer Any thoughts on this?\n. @isantolin Yes I'm currently working on 3.0 and I'll remove this there\n. Closing issue since work was done on 3.x-dev branch \n. @isantolin Thanks for pointing this; I'll add this as a part of PR #1805\n. @isantolin Can you check https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/pull/1805/commits/1718a928f1f7e5833e93a8c0d451e2a773c528b7 to make sure it is useful, please?\n. Closing issue since fix has been merged\n. OK @dazweeja give it a try now; I added an autoplay functionality, so if the video tag has autoplay attribute, it will. And when you load a new source, it will stop and load the new one until you click Play button\n. @dazweeja Thank you so much for your comments. Yes, if autoplay attribute is set the proper way is to play the new video. I'll add it so you can give it a try. About your recommendations for the attribute, can you indicate which places in the code will benefit from adding this tweak?\n. @dazweeja Nevermind I found all the places that benefit from this tweak. I added the changes you mentioned before as it will mimic the HTML5 behavior when autoplay attribute is set. Let me know if it works for you\n. @dazweeja BTW I merged PR #1802 into this one since it is all related to YouTube at this point, and it was only a minor addition\n. Thanks for pointing this. It came to my notice that there are some issues with chromium and we are checking this. We'll keep you posted\n. It has not been released yet is still work in progress but once we resolve the final bugs in the queue we'll get our whole attention to it\n. So you mean in 3 is fixed but not in 2?\n. @mediaclap  Thanks for your patience. I created a PR that solves this issue (#1843). Please test it and let me know.\n. Closing this issue since PR was merged and per comments on #1843\n. @Pawluczkowycz I tested this on Browserstack using Win7 IE9 and it worked.\n. I'll test in Browserstack and let you know what I find. \n. So based on comments can this issue be closed?\n. I'll concur is your OS based on my test and @elucidat tests\n. @cheiser34 Try to use the latest version and see if that solves your issue. The version you are using is really old now\n. @cheiser34 I tested this using Browserstack and I didn't see any errors. Make sure you are not using any Quirks\n\n. Which version of Windows are you using? That might have something to do with it\n. I may need to try on a real computer since I don't see any issues in Browserstack\n. It's possible but I don't know. I haven't worked on IE for a long time. But it's always good to consider it\n. @isantolin Thanks for pointing this issue. First of all, make sure you include froogaloop library. Then make sure your video tag has controls on it. I'll keep researching about this\n. @isantolin I found out that there's a new API to use with Vimeo. This will require an update on how Vimeo is used. I'll keep you posted about it\n. @isantolin I have integrated Vimeo into 3.x-dev branch. Check one of the test files to acknowledge this issue has been solved there\n. @isantolin Don't test it with localhost; create a vhost with a fake domain because Vimeo as well as other renders don't like the localhost approach. Please let me know if that works for you\n. @isantolin Thanks. I replied to your email. It's a matter of the URL you are passing to the player\n. @isantolin I'll add that test in a minute. Thanks\n. @isantolin Test added\n. Closing issue since work has been done on 3.x-dev branch \n. @SiddiquiImran as stated above this has been fixed on 3.x-dev branch and we'll release it soon. On 2.x it will require a lot of rewriting to make it work again since Froogaloop is deprecated now\n. The 3.x-dev branch\n. We'll release it soon\n. Thanks @isantolli I just need to create a demo file and I'll merge. Thanks for your help\n. @isantolin Can you test one more time with the last changes I made, please? There's also a demo file included now. Thanks\n. @isantolin Just run grunt html5only to avoid overriding Flash elements, since there's nothing new on them\n. @isantolin Thanks I'll merge this once I review one more PR to complete the cycle of this next release\n. sounds like an encoding issue of your files. Read http://rigor.com/blog/2016/01/optimizing-mp4-video-for-fast-streaming to see if that helps you\n. @jangrewe Thanks for noticing this\n. @andynd Thanks for pointing this. I'll check it and keep you posted\n. @andynd Does PR #1839 fixes your issue?\n. Closing this issue since no answer has been posted in more than 2 weeks. If you'd like to reopen this, let us know. Thanks!\n. @tennety Thanks for your work on this PR; just revert any changes done to the /build/ folder to avoid conflicts when I release the next version\n. @davehax Thanks for pointing this. I'll create a PR to address this and keep you posted\n. @davehax I created a PR that solves this issue (#1842); please test and let me know if it works for you\n. Closing this issue since fix has been merged\n. @tennety This looks pretty solid. Are you planning to continue adding more things?\n. I'll check this since I don't have an instance of Linux to test Chromium\n. @mediaclap I got access to an Ubuntu machine and I checked on Chromium and I can hear the audio. What is what you are experiencing?\n. My Chromium version is\nVersion 51.0.2704.106 Built on Ubuntu, running on Ubuntu 16.04 (64-bit)\n. @mediaclap I see the controls now. I just updated Ubuntu and now my Chromium version is 53.0.2785.89. I checked the main site (http://mediaelementjs.com) and controls are not there. But in the one you just shared I can see controls. Am I missing something, or there's another issue?\n. I just have a Unix and Mac machines with me. I don't have a Windows machine with me. Can you send me a screenshot of what you are seeing, or even what you are getting from Console or Network tabs to try to determine what's going on please? Thanks for your patience and help with this. I'll try to get a Win instance as soon as possible\n. Which version of Windows do you have?\n. @mediaclap As @isantolin said, this is a known bug from Chromium on Windows. On Ubuntu this can be fixed by running http://thanhsiang.org/faqing/node/195.\nAs an alternative solution for this, try the steps listed on http://www.chromestory.com/2010/11/how-to-make-chromium-os-play-mp3-files-on-windows-linux-and-mac/.\nThis is not related to this plugin anymore. And as it is concerned to this PR, it solved the issue related to not being able to display the audio controls in Chromium.\n. @mediaclap and @isantolin I changed the PR slightly; please test and let me know. Thanks for your help on this one\n. Did you give it a try on Chromium as well?\n. Thanks @isantolin I'll merge as soon as I'm front of my computer. Thanks again for your help\n. Closing this issue since PR was merged and per comments above\n. Thanks for pointing this. I'll take a look and if needed I'll ask you for more testing\n. If you can also provide a URL to test it I'll appreciate it\n. And also the OS you tested this\n. @rekcuFniarB The build files have not the fix available; please test this using only the src files, given that this hasn't been released yet. For reference, check /test/test.html to load all the needed elements\n. @pixelastic Enable mediaelement again but use the /src/ files, since the /build/ folder doesn't account for the fix yet, until the next release is created. For reference, check /test/test.html to load all the needed elements\n. @pixelastic Can you send me the URL where you used the mejs src files so I can see the issue, please?\n. @sarowerj I tested this on Chrome and I can see the them being displayed; which browser you are experiencing issues with?\n. Closing this issue since no answer has been posted in more than 2 weeks. If you'd like to reopen this, let us know. Thanks!\n. Can you provide a URL to check this please?. And also can you test 3.x-dev branch to see if that issue persists please?. @OlivierJaquemet I left some comments on this PR. It looks good; only consider those comments and also the skip back and forward translations are available in English and Spanish. Is there a way we can integrate them in the other language files to have all the files completed as the English one?\n. Thanks for the stats. I'll wait for the rest of the translations to merge this PR so we have a complete and pretty solid change with this. Good job!\n. Excellent. So this approach won't break anything on Wordpress correct?\n. OK if no more comments from @ocean90 I'll merge this tonight. Thank you very much for the work on this piece\n. @isantolin Thanks for pointing this out. I'll change this today\n. @isantolin Change added in 3.0 version\n. @isantolin This sounds very interesting. Although, I don't have that privilege. @johndyer Thoughts?\n. @isantolin Just FYI, this is the new website that is being worked on: http://johndyer.github.io/mediaelement/. @isantolin new website uploaded. Thanks @johndyer. Closing this issue. @albell If you propose a PR for this we'll be happy to review it. Thanks for your interest\n. I agree on everything you have stated. The next major release will come with 3.x-dev so if you wanna create a PR there it will be better. At this point that's my major focus\n. The main changes are oriented to the core, not the player itself. Of course some minor adjustments must occur to make this new approach to work but other than that it should remain the same. If you wanna test your work use /test/test-3.html file that currently uses the full player\n. From a conversation with @johndyer:\n\"Also, I did see the note about making the CSS less specific and I think it'd be fine to get it down to one class each since they are all prefixed.\"\n. @albell In addition to this, there are missing some elements in some of the features CSS, like the skipback.png button and no icon for jumpforward. It would be good to address those issues as well\n. @albell As an update I found the file missing for skip back and added it into 3.x-dev\n. @johndyer We can use multiple SVG images and then create a sprite with them when compiling. I know you can achieve this with gulp but I'm not sure of you can do this with grunt. After that, the way to call them in CSS will be through an ID embedded in the svg attributes\n. @albell Yeah I'll review it tomorrow and let you know my feedback. Thanks for your work on this\n. @albell The link to your branch is broken. Let me know when it's fixed so I can check it\n. @albell Sorry I'll review this today. The only way I test this is by using the /test/test.html file and add whatever library is missing (including features). In this case, I haven't used any of the Ads features we have, but the rest of them I had. I check the file in Browserstack in the major browsers and with that I determine if it's ok or more fixes need to be done.\n. @albell I saw that your branch is not fully up-to-date with the recent changes; second thing, I tried to test it using /test/test.html file and there are a lot of things broken on the UI. You can use that file to test from now on, as well as /test/alpha-2.html once you merge the 3.x-dev branch into yours.\nGeneral overview of video\n\nWhen hovering on captions\n\nWhen hovering on volume controller\n\nGeneral overview of audio\n\n. @albell I'm OK using it. I use it in other projects and it always helps to create quality code. So I'm all for it\n. @albell for purposes of this issue, you covered what was expected. Can this one be closed?\n. @comede can you test this on 3.x-dev branch please?\n. @comede Can you share a URL where I can see this issue? When I do my tests I don't see this\n. Sounds like you missed to include files; please check the test-3.html file in that branch to know what to include \n. @comede  and @michaelbucklin Fix has been put in place; it will be available for next release. Thanks for your help\n. My apologies for the inconvenience. Please take a look into the demo folder on there is a file that shows how to set translation. I'll write documentation about it in the next couple of days\n. @Globulopolis I just created documentation about setting translations. Check Installation section and let me know if that works for you. Thanks\n. @Globulopolis Thanks for pointing this error out. The sequence has something to do with this, so I'll work on fixing this ASAP. Setting the language in the <html> tag is optional as documentation states\n. @Globulopolis The issues are fixed; please check the demo again and let me know\n. @Globulopolis I'll release by the end of the day or tomorrow. \n. @yoime As far as I understand ES6 is not supported in all browsers, and we have to give support to at least IE8+. Correct me if I'm wrong\n. @yoime All the code has been written right now in vanilla Javascript. Does this tool can assist on migrating what we have in the event we decide to go with ES6: https://lebab.io/try-it?\n. @yoime Please take a look into 3.x-dev-es6 branch and let me know what else needs to be placed there to make it work completely. This will be a second iteration once 3.x-dev branch is released\n. This will be a next step after we launch 3.0 version. Certainly it can be started but right now the priority is to get the release launched. After that we can come back to this issue\n. @albell and @yoime As an update JSLint has been integrated in 3.0 version so a future iteration will consist in translating this into ES6 notation. I'll update the 3.x-dev-es6 branch with the latest version using Lebab tool as a start\n. Closing this issue in favor of #1042\n. @isantolin Thanks for your testing. Indeed the file name was wrong so I changed to one that actually exists once you download the media files from the https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement-files and it should work now. Please test one more time and let me know\n. Also keep in mind that all these tests are made with a simple player which is only intended for testing purposes; the full player is the target for release. Right now the only file that accounts for the full player is /test/test-3.html\n. @isantolin Thanks for your help\n. Closing this ticket since test and fixes were done\n. @CaineThanatos Thanks for submitting this PR. Please check 3.x-dev branch and let me know if you experience this issue using it. Right now is the focus that branch, and we changed a lot of things \n. @CaineThanatos Thanks for the fix; please just revert any changes inside the /build/ folder and I'd be able to merge this\n. @CaineThanatos Thanks for noticing this. Just FYI, this issue doesn't exist in 3.x-dev branch\n. Do you have a URL I can check to test that issue with the 3.x-dev branch please?\n. Ok sounds good thanks for keeping me posted\n. Of course any improvements that you can suggest are very welcome.\n. @albell I'm working on a PR that I'll release soon so you can review it to make sure we don't use setControlSize() anymore since I agree that it's complex and has a lot of issues because of error margin of pixels\n. @yoime I'll review it this weekend. Most of the work now should be for the 3.x-dev branch since we are trying to release it as soon as possible. @albell can you take a look into this, please?\n. @yoime I have used more gulp than grunt and I like it much better. If you can put a gulp file in a PR imitating what grunt does we can check it and decide. @johndyer Any thoughts on this?\n. Consider the work on #1849 since we will end up using that approach\n. @yoime It looks solid; the only thing is that we will change class names to favor BEM notation. Once 3.0 is released, let's connect and talk about this PR\n. @albell After reviewing the documentation you sent and your points about using a preprocessor, I agree with you. Now that the stylesheet got reduced in terms of specificity, I don't see the need for something more complex. @yoime Thoughts?\n. @yoime and @albell I'm not an expert on any SASS or LESS or any other preprocessed methodologies; the only thing I can say is that the stylesheet is simple and relatively short so I really don't see the point on going all that effort for something that is not that complicated. Just my 2 cents\n. @isantolin thanks for testing this. I'll take a look on these issues and see what we can do\n. @isantolin To give you an update, the volume issues and the click to play/pause were addressed. The issues on IE I'm investigating but one of them is because the MIME type in your machine has not been set (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31873375/loading-webvtt-track-in-ie); IE8 issue I'll investigate more but if I test it on Browserstack and I cannot replicate it we will be in better shape. The IE10 one I'll check why the error is showing up when it shouldn't\n. @isantolin New update: the skipback error has been resolved as well\n. @isantolin that's something stated already in the documentation as the initial step to install the plugin. I'll add some more mime types in there \n. Closing this ticket now since test and fixes were put in place\n. @magesh7j You will need to write your own Javascript to achieve this\n. Try to enclose the logic related to the end event inside the success method on the player. Like this:\njavascript\n$('video').mediaelementplayer({\n   // Configuration\n   success: function(media, player) {\n     var count = 0;\n     media.on('ended', function() {\n        while(count < 1) {\n            console.log('VIdeo has played again');\n            media.play();\n            count++;\n        }\n     });\n  }\n});\n. @magesh7j Let me know if it works; if so, can you close this ticket, please?\n. @eikoni You need to pass a Flash variable to be used in the <object> or <embed> tag, since HLS is currently only supported using Flash. Use the example below and let me know if it works for you\njavascript\n$('video').mediaelementplayer({\n        pluginPath: '../build/',\n        type: ['application/x-mpegURL'],\n        pluginVars: ['file=http://www.streambox.fr/playlists/x36xhzz/x36xhzz.m3u8'],\n        features: ['fullscreen','volume'],\n        mode: 'auto',\n        success: function(media, node, player) {\n            media.setSrc('http://www.streambox.fr/playlists/x36xhzz/x36xhzz.m3u8');\n            media.load();\n            media.play();\n        }\n    });\n. @eikoni We need it right now since hls.js is not integrated, but it will in the next version currently being developed. Thanks. Closing this issue\n. @prakasa1904 I strongly recommend you to check 3.x-dev branch and in the test folder you will find an example\nUsing HLS. That's the branch I'm currently maintaining and it will be released soon. @isantolin Thanks for testing. This shows that we are in a very stable place now. @johndyer FYI.\nClosing this issue now\n. @OlivierJaquemet Please check this PR and let me know your thoughts. For the translations you created I'll need them to follow the format specified in English and Spanish NOT translating the word plural, given that is the name of the filter I'm using to pluralize. Refer to the rules inside the i18n file but you'll need to provide up to 3 different strings concatenated with :. Let me know if you have any questions/concerns\n. Thanks for reviewing this. About the first item, I'll see how can I integrate the rules inside the t method, since your arguments are valid. The Wordpress part I'll remove it. I could integrate a fallback but I think it will be better to integrate this right at once; so if you can assist with this I'd appreciate it. Let me know your thoughts \n. @OlivierJaquemet I'll add the fallback for now and let me know when you have the new translation available so we conclude this. I'll keep you posted. Thanks\n. @OlivierJaquemet Changes in place; please review and let me know. @ocean90 can you review this as well, please?\n. @OlivierJaquemet I noticed an issue with re Brazilian Portuguese translation; shouldn't it be exports[pt-BR] instead of exports.pt?\n. And also as a reminder you need to check which languages would need 3 strings once you send them for an update; all the ideographic languages like Chinese or Japanese won't need it. Russian, Polish, etc. will need 3 and the romantic languages 2. Any questions let me know \n. @OlivierJaquemet  and @ocean90 I refactored the method following the conventions of PluginForm.jsm using semi-colon concatenated strings to determine proper plural, leaving the %1 token intact for backward compatibility in the event we don't have all the translations ready, and added all the plural forms to have a complete set of translations. Please review and let me know your thoughts\n. As a last pass I'll add documentation in the event someone wants to create a translation file. @OlivierJaquemet any comments on this that could be useful for other contributors? @ocean90 I hope with this new way it's more conventional and doesn't disturb the current support to WordPress, any more comments about this PR? \n. @OlivierJaquemet Any comments on the approach of semi-colon strings, rather than using brackets? Do you think it is more standard this way?\n. @OlivierJaquemet correct. The problem with that is that I saw on some languages is almost a completely new string and that in the long term would complicate things. Now, for the purposes of the player, and to maintain compatibility with WordPress, I think it's more likely to have something like the new approach and it won't be as confusing as the first approach I took. The highest number we can get is 6 translation (Arabic)\n. @OlivierJaquemet yeah you don't but if it's needed I can change it by using something more unusual (like ~ or #) or simply doubling the semi-colons (;;)\n. @OlivierJaquemet I will change the semi-colon separated string to an array so we can account for semi-colons as @ocean90 pointed out\n. @OlivierJaquemet and @ocean90 I changed this to arrays and it will be even more clear and we won't have to worry about punctuation signs. Let me know your thoughts\n. Thanks for pointing this. I'll add this later to complete this PR. Any other concerns? @ocean90 any thoughts or this is good to go once the HTML tags are escaped?\n. @OlivierJaquemet HTML escaping added. I'll wait for your final feedback as well as @ocean90 to merge this next week. Thanks.\n. Any objections if I merge this by tomorrow? I'm speeding this since this must be part of 3.0 and we are going to release it soon\n. @OlivierJaquemet  and @ocean90 thanks for your help\n. @albell I'm ok with it go for it\n. In 3.x branch I set a table only for the MediaElement object. If you do the MediaElementPlayer part we'lol get this sorted out completely\n. @albell I have to speed this since version is in alpha state at this point and we are trying to close loop on some things. I'm going to refactor the table and close the ticket, so you can focus on the BEM issues you had. Thanks\n. Thanks I'll fix any issues so one more est can be performed \n. @isantolin Most of the issues have been resolved; some issues cannot be fixed, since they are related to the iframes themselves. We are thinking of dropping support on IE8 and older browsers in this version. The IE10 error is expected since you deactivated it. There are some Flash fallbacks missing that will try to create. Please test once more but skip IE8 \n. @isantolin  With OGG you mean video or audio? About MPEG-DASH, for now we'll use fallback on HLS but we are trying to see how to integrate a Flash fallback for it\n. I'll check that but might need a library to play OGV video. I'll research some more. Thanks\n. @isantolin just to keep you posted I'm working in the Dash fallback and I think by the end of this week I'll have it ready. Right now it works but there's no way to manipulate the media with control bar \n. @isantolin You can test DASH support now using dash.as; I'm checking with John about the Video OGG\n. @isantolin Yes please and also /test/mdash/html\n. @isantolin As an update, OGG can only be played in certain browsers and what I've found so far is that the best option is to use MP3 for audio and MP4 for video as fallback\n. @isantolin On Edge I was able to play MPD using Browserstack; the first issue with Dailymotion is because the video is playing an advertisement prior the real video. MPD will only play on Win 8 IE11 for now. I'll investigate more the second issue of Dailymotion and the renderer not found effect. Thanks for testing this again\n. @isantolin Can you confirm the second issue you listed of Dailymotion is fixed? I just pushed a minor fix\n. @isantolin Thanks I just need to check the renderer one and I'll close this ticket.\n. I can only say that if there's an issue related to that the first place to look at is mep-player.js and look for focus and focusout strings as a way to start. Do you have the same issue in the test/test.html file?\n. @knomedia You are welcome. Keep us posted about your findings\n. @knomedia I tested using option + tab and I was able to focus properly using 3.x-dev branch; please let me know if it works for you as well in that branch\n. Closing this issue since no answer has been posted in more than 2 weeks. If you'd like to reopen this, let us know. Thanks!\n. Great news! Thank you very much\n. Yeah I can see this. Odd. I'll try to check what's going on with this.. This seems to be an issue with Safari itself. I tested this with YouTube and it behaves the same. @tiffwyatt can you confirm this?. OK I'll check some more. If you find anything let me know. @knomedia I found out that this piece on the code causes the lost of focus in Safari:\njavascript\nt.container.find('.' + t.options.classPrefix + 'mediaelement').append(t.$media);\nAny thoughts on how this could be affecting Safari? It seems like it doesn't like the idea of appending video/audio without losing focus for some reason, because I tried to insert a paragraph for testing purposes and it worked (obviously, adding some tabindex elements). @evanhuntley can you advise on this, please? You have more experience dealing with this type of quirks for accessibility than myself.. @tiffwyatt can you download the latest version and use the keyboard-fix branch and test it in different browsers along with Safari, please (including mobile devices)? I think I figured out the best way to do this, but I need to make sure this is 100% tested before merging to master. I used in Safari Alt+Tab, and other browsers just Tab. Any feedback in the next few days I'd appreciate it since I'm planning to release the next version at the beginning of next week. Thanks. @isantolin Is this something you can assist me as well please? This is for accessibility purposes so it's a matter of using keyboard properly in different browsers (the ones described on README).. @tiffwyatt You are welcome. Keep me posted. Thanks @isantolin . Any updates on this?. @tiffwyatt How about IE? Have you been able to try MS Edge, or any version between 9 and 11?. If you confirm no issues at all also with IE, I'll merge this fix. Great! Well let me know ASAP so I can put the fix in place for the next release. Thanks for testing this. Perfect. Great news. The fix has been integrated now and will be available in the CDN for next release. Closing this ticket now. I see. I'll try to check this ASAP and keep you posted. Thanks. Do you have a URL I can use to replicate the issue?\n. @tiffwyatt this is an issue with Safari, so I have submitted a bug report for this. Let's wait and see what they say. @tiffwyatt I have some news for you: I think the problem with Safari is that when using appendChild it doesn't append the children elements of it, and they get lost for some reason, but not it's focus. So I'll be working on something to make sure we cover this scenario and I'll keep you posted. @knomedia and @tiffwyatt I have a new branch (keyboard-fix) that solves this issue, but I'll need a very robust test on OSX and Windows. If you can assist me on testing to make sure everything is working as expected I'd appreciate it. I had to remove any children from the original video/audio tag and save them in 3 different categories and then, if destroyed, recreate them. Please let me know ASAP. Thanks. @tiffwyatt I tested on Mac and so far it has been no issues at all. Once you confirm with Safari on your side, as well as IE9+ and Edge I think I'll be good to merge this. @tiffwyatt I just restricted this for Safari desktop. So I tested this and it's working fine. It has been merged now to the master branch. Thanks.. We'll need to research but once 3.0 version is out it will be very easy to plug this new video type. It will all depend on other factors and if we can manipulate the video the same way we are doing it now. I'll keep you posted about this\n. @SeventhCycle After a lot of research and playing with different plugins, I'm planning to use Google's VR View for this. Although there are some limitations indicated in its website, I'd rather go for a script that will be well supported and it's open source. Let me know your thoughts. @SeventhCycle No problem. As far as I know, the Oculus may work with this, but I don't know about the other 2. For the equirectangular panoramic format I've seen it as the most standard one, and specially if we decide to use MediaElementJS it's more manageable. For the third point, I don't think it's really needed. All the videos should work with headset, but if you don't have one I don't see why we should prevent the users to try to video. Of course might be some limitations but I think we can get away with it.\nLet me know your findings, and if this could be a good option, given that is the one I think is very promising and not as intrusive and that fits perfectly with the new approach we are following for 3.x-dev. @SeventhCycle Just to give you an update: I have created the vr-support branch, where you can check the work done with Google VRView. It's still not ready since I'm asking questions to the developers about certain things, but overall it can be used. Events like duration, progress or other html5 native ones are not integrated yet since that's what I'm enquiring. If you wanna check this, please check the test/player-full.html file in that branch. Thanks. Thanks for your observations. I'll check it and let you know my findings. Happy holidays as well for you too!. OK just download the latest version of the vr-support branch and use the /test/player-full.html file to test this; if you use demos it won't work since the code for VR has been integrated yet in the compiled files. Let me know if it worked for you now. I saw an error message but I don't see it now after the minor fix I set.\n\n. I'll need to check the spec since it's not my area of expertise. Google VR has some additional configuration but I haven't explored it completely. If you find anything that is useful to complete the integration of this piece into MediaElement I'd appreciate it. I'm trying to contact the authors to check some missing features that should be before releasing this, so I'm also waiting for some answers. Thanks for keep looking at this.. This issue was moved to johndyer/mediaelement-plugins#4. @web-engineer Yes definitely sounds like an issue with server configuration or how the media was encoded. I'm not expert in that area but mostly when I've heard about these types of situations it's always related to those 2 topics. Sorry I cannot be more helpful with your issue\n. @web-engineer Thanks for digging into this.\n. @edgehero We need to finalize some details in the branch and some last questions to be answered and hopefully by the end of the month. We are pushing as hard as we can to get it released as soon as possible\n. Version in NPM up to date \n. @isantolin Thanks for testing this; just FYI at this point if the user doesn't have Flash in older browsers it is not gonna work. So the results are expected. About the controls on IE8, this simple player uses SVG and IE8 doesn't support SVG. Given that this version of the player was meant to be used for testing first phases of 3.x-dev branch, no fallback mechanism to use PNG or JPG instead of SVG was set. SO it is expected. I'll check the issue on IE10 related to fullscreen. Closing this now. Thanks again!\n. @isantolin As an update the simple player doesn't have any code to deal with fullscreen in old browsers. That's why you saw that message in console and nothing happened. As long as fullscreen is working on the full player we will be fine. Thanks\n. @albell Pull the latest changes on the branch since there are conflicts. I like the integration of JSLint. If you pull you won't have to worry about the PNG files and all of that since the build/ folder has all of this ready now\n. @albell Using the latest version of the repo I got 46 errors in 60 files. I can find out how to fix all of them and we'll be in good shape to integrate this. For now, just fix the conflicts so I can review again. Thanks\n. @albell I'll commit your change on Gruntfile and package.json in a minute. I'll close this PR. Thanks\n. @SoftCreatR Thanks I'd appreciate it\n. Thanks I'll check these issues and close the ticket \n. @isantolin The duplicated events is because once one player is playing it will stop any other player, so it is expected; I fixed the issues with IE8 and the Vimeo issue as well. If you deactivate Flash, M(PEG)-DASH won't work at all; the issue with the file sintel_vod.mpd is related to the file itself, not the player. So I removed that one to ensure that the test suite works 100%. Let me know if it works for you. Thanks\n. Thanks for the work on this\n. I'm not in favor of putting heavy files in the repo I'd rather find the MP4, MP3 and WebM sources from Internet and just use those rather than storing them\n. On 3.0 version I didn't include any files since I found some good sources online. We'll define in these days what would be the final approach for this.\n. @chdh Thanks for submitting this PR. I'll merge it once 3.0 version is released.\n. @barmintor Can you test this on the 3.x-dev branch to confirm if this is an issue there please?\n. Just use rtmp protocol and use type as audio/rtmp and let me know. I tried video but no audio and just use 3.x-dev not the other one\n. Of course, let me know your findings so I can check the code and integrate whatever is needed. Thanks\n. @barmintor Make sure you set the media type audio/rtmp for this\n. As far as I saw the audio is just for MP3; all the RTMP is done through the video shim\n. @barmintor Just to keep you on the loop, I tested the following RTMP audio (rtmp://s3b78u0kbtx79q.cloudfront.net/cfx/st/mp3:fake_empire-cbr) and it worked. Check the test/flash.html file and you will see.\n. @barmintor Yes it works for me; replace the src in test/flash.html and you will see\n. Can this ticket be closed?\n. You are welcome. Thank you for testing this \n. Just FYI a last update was done. Feel free to download the latest version but you should be fine. It fixed an issue with Flash and Firefox\n. You are using the simple player not the full player; now there are compiled files you can use instead of that player. Let me know if you have any other issues. As far as full screen goes, there's no way to avoid it since that's native behavior for iOS \n. If you can provide me a URL so I can check if there are any other potential issues I'd appreciate it \n. @SiddiquiImran Thanks. The MP4 as you stated is not playing so I need to replace it since I've noticed other issues with it. But YouTube demo is using the simple player. The other one is using full player.\nFor https://dev1apps.mobilebc.de/CFAE4896-64B3-4E8B-AC6B-3D4B47037573/staging/index.html#MBCWorkflow-layout?Id=15998 you already included the library but there's no JS code to initiate the full player\njavascript\n$('video, audio').mediaelemenplayer({\n    // configuration\n})\nAll configuration can be found in the API documentation in the 3.x-dev branch\n. Thanks for pointing that out. You are doing it but I see the code is commented. That's why I don't see the player using MediaElementJS\n. I'm aware of this. I'll get it fixed soon\n. OK download the latest version, test again and let me know if you still see the console.error, please\n. For the fullscreen by default on MP4 there are some workarounds but I don't how effective they are or if they will disrupt the video (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5054560/can-i-avoid-the-native-fullscreen-video-player-with-html5-on-iphone-or-android)\nFor the double play button I'll restrict the displaying for iPhone and the iframe renderers (except DailyMotion) and keep you posted\n. @SiddiquiImran Removed double play button for MP4 on iOS as well as YouTube and Facebook since they have it natively by default. Please download latest version and let me know.\n. @MartinTheriault3333 Also check latest version and let me know if it works properly for you\n. That URL gives a whole page and that's why you get that error; check in the test folder the file Vimeo.html to see the right structure of the URL for Vimeo \n. Something like https://player.vimeo.com/video/[VIMEO ID]?title=false&byline=false&portrait=false\n. @SiddiquiImran no. Like it says it may not work; only for native apps that's feasible. The fullscreen mode when playing is native behavior on MP4 and there's nothing we can do about it. If no more issues, please close this ticket. Thanks!\n. @albell I'll check it later today; have you checked #1860? Do you think it's something we can integrate parallel with your work given that it already does some of the tedious work in an automated way?\n. The test directory is using simple player; the only file that uses the full player is the alpha-2.html file. You can check whatever you need to check in that file\n. @jrglasgow Great. You can create a PR based on 3.x-dev branch so we can review it\n. This issue was moved to johndyer/mediaelement-plugins#3. @zif002 Which version of the player you are using, since that piece of code is not for orientationchange, but for resize\n. Can this ticket be closed?\n. Thanks for pointing this. Can you test this with 3.x-dev branch and see if the issue is still there please?\n. @alindt Perfect. Thank you for verifying this. I'll close this ticket since 3.0 version will be released soon\n. @albell I'm OK with using postCSS. Since we are not supporting IE8 on 3.x branch anymore I'm OK with using only SVG for this. Just make sure don't do any changes on build folder please, so I can review one more time before merging this\n. Yeah it's better if you don't do anything in the folder.  Just take care of the conflict and then I will merge this\n. In the documentation is specified to never do anything in the build folder to smooth the process\n. @ale-grosselle Isn't setDimensions forced to false in your statement above that caused this issue?\n. I see. I'll merge your PR once we release 3.0 version; or if you prefer, create a PR based on that so it gets available once we release 3.0\n. @ale-grosselle Thank you. I'll close this ticket since I reviewed the PR and it makes sense. I'll wait for you fix to include it in the 3.x-dev branch\n. Can you provide a URL or the iframw code to check how you are setting it up? You are testing this on the 3.x-dev branch?\n. The issue is because you are using a URL that starts with https; change it to http and that might solve it\n. Sure send it to my email; you will find it on my profile\n. @MosheL It should be fixed now; in the test file, the renderer was missing. Please let me know if that worked. Thanks\n. Can this ticket be closed?\n. Unfortunately, this is a limitation on Facebook embed (as well as Vimeo) so nothing we can do about it\n. @MosheL After some research I was able to achieve the hiding of controls; please download the latest version of 3.x-dev branch and let me know. Thanks\n. Thanks. I'll check this and keep you posted ASAP about the fix\n. @MosheL Please download and test this again; I found some issues and took me some time to figure out why fullscreen was not behaving as it should with the full player\n. Yeah Facebook videos are not as mature as the other renderers and are very limited with the features we offer related to time wise; for now just remove any features that don't work and I'll check the play issue. That will be the last thing I can do in the Facebook side. Thanks\n. @MosheL Fixed the issue with Play with video ended. Facebook right now doesn't account for a timeupdate event, making some of the features unusable. Please test and let me know. Thanks\n. @MosheL Update: I was able to make the progress bar click to work. Also, most of the features related to time must be working right now; please confirm and let me know\n. I'll test setting dimensions for live videos I never considered that. Thanks for pointing this out\n. I'll give you an update soon. That link is still active?\n. I just used https://www.facebook.com/MdRaqibulHasanRana/videos/1121837361186419/ and no issues. The only thing I noticed is volume but I'm checking that right now. The link you posted is not active and that might be causing the issues you are seeing\n. @MosheL I haven't found any information in regards of live videos and how to interact with them. Seems that is very limited now. I'll continue searching but as it is right now, Facebook renderer is very stable. Feel free to close this ticket if you consider it. Thanks\n. For now there's a lack of documentation as you know so there's no much we can do at this stage. As soon as updates come to the Facebook videos we'll integrate them or simply use the iframe\n. Yeah that's fine. Thanks\n. @ale-grosselle Thanks for this PR. Merged now\n. @peterh-capella You can add a PR based on the 3.x-dev, so it can be merged immediately and be available for the 3.0 version; otherwise, you may have to wait until that version is released\n. Look in the Code tab and then you will see branches. There you will find it\n. Closing this PR since it has been merged in 3.x-dev branch. Thanks\n. Thanks for the PR\n. @MosheL According to the documentation, the video resolution for live videos is max 720p (1280 x 720 or 720 x 1280), 30 frames per second.\nSo if you set your video tag like this:\nhtml\n<video id=\"player1\" height=\"711\" width=\"400\" preload=\"none\" >\n     <source src=\"https://www.facebook.com/admini/videos/10154655923894932/\" type=\"video/facebook\">\n</video>\nthe issue goes away. Currently there's no way in Facebook API to know the original dimensions of a video. The video you set as an example has a width of 400px; so following the guidelines, you must set a 711px of height to solve this.\n. @MosheL Download the latest version; seems like I got the proper workflow to set the dimensions properly for this situation\n. checking it right now\n. @MosheL Ok try again please.\n. Thanks I'll check it and for a next iteration in 3.0 version I'll create a renderer if it's well supported (https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flv.js/1.0.0/flv.min.js)\n. @isantolin The file is ready but I still see that the package needs to fix more things. So I won't incorporate it into the grunt tasks and neither mention it in the documentation until it solves some major things.\n. Will be replaced by API configuration documentation \n. Or @johndyer what do you think? Is it better if we remove it?\n. @isantolin I updated it with some links that are listed on README so it will always be up-to-date. Closing this issue\n. Can be fixed with specifications on #1858; starting to work on a PR\n. @SeventhCycle can you test #1908 and see if that fixes the glitch please? Check the test/alpha-2.html file since this PR hasn't compiled the files yet. So just set the headers the way they are in that file\n. @SeventhCycle No you must use the latest PR I created (#1908); otherwise, it's not gonna work\n. Check the last 2 commits on https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/pull/1908; set them in your branch and recompile\n. @SeventhCycle If you want me to set it up on 3.x-dev branch I could, but if I do that I'd ask you to test in more than FF. At least the major browsers for Desktop, including Chromium, and iOS. Is that something you can assist me with?\n. @SeventhCycle Perfect. With IE anything IE9+ should be tested. Also iOS 8+ and Android 4.0+. I really appreciate it. Keep me posted. Thanks for your help\n. Correct \n. Thanks for testing this. However, you tested with the simple player and the fix was done with the full player. Use test/player-full.html for the sake of this issue please\n. Any updates on this?\n. @SeventhCycle Thanks for testing this. All the renderers that use Flash have that effect of the fullscreen. This is something that exists already in the 2.23.4 version, and no work has been done to change that. Since this ticket is related to only the controlsbar behaving properly, and based on your test, I'll close this one. We can create a separate ticket to explore this.\n. Thanks for the PR\n. @albell Just take a look to the last commit on this PR; I don't know why the PR brought more stuff than it should. Let me know your thoughts, but this solves any glitches and it's cleaner\n. @albell Update: just check the last 2 commits and let me know please. This PR should be tested in many browsers including mobile to make sure it won't break anything, since it is a key piece in the player\n. @albell Just check the last 2 commits and let me know please. This PR should be tested in many browsers including mobile to make sure it won't break anything, since it is a key piece in the player\n. We are still deciding if we get a beta release so we get more feedback so more to come. I'll wait for your feedback when you test this and that's gonna be my final addition because we are getting close to release this version\n. @albell Perfect. With IE anything IE9+ should be tested. Also iOS 8+ and Android 4.0+. I really appreciate it. Keep me posted and I'll put a message for users to test next week. Thanks for your help\n. @albell FYI I decided to make this change this directly in the branch since we are still on dev mode. So closing this PR to favor the core change. Thanks\n. Merged. I added a VTT file inside test/alpha-2.html file so you can test closed captioning\n. If you wanna propose a PR is very welcome and I'll be happy to review it. At this point we are trying to freeze the coding so it can be tested and bug fixed as much as possible\n. @albell The workflow has been implemented into 3.x-dev. Thanks\n. @albell Thanks for the feedback. Just to summarize: the onlt change to close this to do the following, correct?\ncss\n.mejs-container.mejs-keyboard-inactive a:focus,\n.mejs-container.mejs-keyboard-inactive button:focus {\n    outline: none;\n}. @albell I'm adding another selector because I noticed it gets outlines in a different way when focused:\ncss\n.mejs-container.mejs-keyboard-inactive a:focus,\n.mejs-container.mejs-keyboard-inactive button:focus,\n.mejs-container.mejs-keyboard-inactive [role=slider]:focus {\n    outline: none;\n}\nI think this is all I need to modify, but let me know. @albell Thanks I'll add this and submit the changes. I'll need to prepend in all the rules .mejs-container, otherwise the change of focus won't be caught up. . @albell Done. Change is now part of the 3.x-dev branch. If you just leave that there the .mejs-container takes precedence and doesn't consider that change when you switch between mouse and keyboard. I tested the above using your code on Chrome and didn't remove the outline when switching. Once I prepended the class, it worked as it should. @albell Thanks for pointing this. I made the change in the latest version following your advise and works perfectly. If you wanna have a conversation with one of the Wordpress developers about the BEM naming, I'd consider the one I pointed on #1917 . No this was never pointed out. Thanks for that. @albell can you check this as a part of your current work with the stylesheet?\n. @Pawluczkowycz and @albell I found a possible solution for this without disturbing the current markup. http://hardlikesoftware.com/weblog/2009/11/04/css-sprites-vs-high-contrast-mode/. Seems a smart approach and I can add a configuration element to activate the high contrast workflow as well as one to determine the location or path of the icons sprite. For the progress bar and volume, so far I think putting a white border will be enough. Let me know your thoughts about this. I could try to do something about it, but since Wordpress is relying on this player for many websites, if I introduce something here I may end up breaking many themes. So closing this issue until figuring out a better way to deal with this. @amuelle1 the suggested solution for your case is to use CSS to hide the control bar from the beginning using a class and then removing it when the video can be played or when mouse over event occurs.\nCSS:\ncss\n.hide-controls {\n     display: none !important;\n}\nJavascript:\n``` javascript\n$('video').mediaelementplayer({\n     // Other configurations\n     success: function(media) {\n          media.find('.mejs-controls').addClass('hide-controls');\n      media.addEventListener('canplay', function() {\n            media.find('.mejs-controls').removeClass('hide-controls');\n      }, false);\n\n      $(media).on('mouseover', function() {\n           media.find('.mejs-controls').removeClass('hide-controls');\n      });\n }\n\n});\n```\nLet me know if that works for you. We cannot modify the behavior above since that's a standard behavior in many other players\n. If there's nothing else to add to this issue can you close it please?\n. @amuelle1 Thanks for pointing this. I forgot about the option. I'll make that work but just FYI I'm only working on the 3.x-dev branch given that it will be released soon. So that's where I'll fix this\n. OK Download the latest version and use the hideVideoControlsOnLoad. It should be working as expected now. Keep me posted please\n. Closing this issue since no answer has been posted in more than 2 weeks. If you'd like to reopen this, let us know. Thanks!. Can you provide a URL where you show this issue, please? The only way I knew to stop an audio streaming on html5 is by setting the source empty and then destroying the audio tag\n. @NitroxydeX Ok I'll check this and let you know my findings. Thanks\n. @NitroxydeX Can you test the 3.x-dev branch and let me know if that's an issue there?\nUse also the following code as a replacement\n``` javascript\n$(window).load(function() {\n        var\n                target = $('#player2').closest('.mejs-container'),\n                playerId = target.attr('id'),\n                player = mejs.players[playerId],\n                button = target.find('.mejs-playpause-button'),\n                i = Math.floor( ( Math.random() * 1000000 ) + 1),\n                source = '[YOUR SOURCE]'\n        ;\n\n        button.on('click', function(e) {\n            if (player.media.paused) {\n                console.log('PAUSED');\n                player.setSrc('');\n                player.load();\n                player.pause();\n            } else {\n                console.log('RESTORED');\n                i++;\n                player.setSrc(source + '?nocache=' + i);\n                player.load();\n                player.play();\n            }\n\n            return false;\n        });\n\n    });\n\n```\nLet me know if it worked for you. Thanks\n. Silverlight is now deprecated. I'll take a look on your code\n. @NitroxydeX I know why it has to do with the src being in the audio tag and not in the source tag. I'm gonna check this but test your code with something like this and it should work\nhtml\n<audio autoplay>\n    <source src=\"http://thgfm.de:8000/dsl;\" type=\"audio/mp3\">\n</audio>\n. @NitroxydeX Please download the latest version; it has the fix for this situation. Thanks for pointing it out\n. Gotcha checking it right now\n. @NitroxydeX After a lot of research I think I finally figured out. Download the latest version and use this code to stop/resume the streaming:\n``` javascript\n$(window).load(function() {\n    var\n            target = $('#player2').closest('.mejs-container'),\n            playerId = target.attr('id'),\n            player = mejs.players[playerId],\n            button = target.find('.mejs-playpause-button'),\n            i = Math.floor( ( Math.random() * 1000000 ) + 1),\n            source = 'http://thgfm.de:8000/dsl;',\n            first = true;\n        ;\n\n    button.on('click', function(e) {\n\n        if (player.media.readyState > 0) {\n            player.pause();\n            player.setSrc('');\n            player.load();\n            button.removeClass('mejs-play').addClass('mejs-pause');\n            first = false;\n        } else {\n            i++;\n            player.setSrc(source + '?nocache=' + i);\n            player.load();\n            player.play();\n            button.removeClass('mejs-pause').addClass('mejs-play');\n        }\n\n        return false;\n\n});\n```\nLet me know if it works for you\n. If this works as you expected, I'll modify the current stop feature to account for this workflow. Thanks for your help on this one and keep me posted. This was truly a tricky one\n. no it's a new element in the 3.0 version using BEM naming convention. My bad I merged today and I forgot to update the code above\n. ``` javascript\n$(window).load(function() {\n    var\n            target = $('#player2').closest('.mejs__container'),\n            playerId = target.attr('id'),\n            player = mejs.players[playerId],\n            button = target.find('.mejs__playpause-button'),\n            i = Math.floor( ( Math.random() * 1000000 ) + 1),\n            source = 'http://thgfm.de:8000/dsl;',\n            first = true;\n        ;\n\n    button.on('click', function(e) {\n\n        if (player.media.readyState > 0) {\n            player.pause();\n            player.setSrc('');\n            player.load();\n            button.removeClass('mejs__play').addClass('mejs__pause');\n            first = false;\n        } else {\n            i++;\n            player.setSrc(source + '?nocache=' + i);\n            player.load();\n            player.play();\n            button.removeClass('mejs__pause').addClass('mejs__play');\n        }\n\n        return false;\n\n});\n``\n. FYI, I just posted the updated code hope it helps\n. perfect. Keep me posted. Thanks\n. What first thing?\n. I'm glad is working for you. Can this ticket be closed?\n. Oh, that's a typo from old code I was testing. You can safely ignore that and remove it. My apologies\n. @NitroxydeX Thanks for your help on this one. I'll go and close #613 as well\n. @NitroxydeX Just FYI we reverted the change with the BEM naming convention so keep that in mind when you download the latest version of the player. Use the class names you used before. Sorry for the inconveniences\n. Thanks for this PR\n. @raulmellado Can you test 3.x-dev branch and see if this is an issue there? I tested the YouTube files and I didn't experience it there.\n. @raulmellado If you just embedhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/Lt6CUH9bVzIyou won't see the title. The URL in that source is using theenablejsapi` element and other things I'm not familiarized with. But I tested it with the URL I provided and it works\n. Yeah in the 3.x-dev branch please, since that's the one I'm actively maintaining and it will be released soon.\n. Yeah we are working on final details to be in production. Maybe by end of November, but we are trying to release it as soon as possible.\n. You are welcome\n. If any other issues raise, please log them independently. I'm closing this issue and we can always reopen it if necessary\n. I'll revert for now\n. @ocean90 Can you indicate with who we can have some feedback from Wordpress about this PR before we release the next version?. @ocean90 Thanks for the feedback. @albell Please check this last comment and also this comment from a conversation with another Wordpress developer to see if you can convey with these ideas:\n\nany custom styling will break unless the stylesheet and markup have both selectors. \nis it possible to expose a map that represent the classes? so that we can implement our own \u201cclassic mode\u201d?\n```javascript\nconst cssClasses = {\n  player: \u2018mejs__player\u2019\n  // etc.\n};\n\n// something we can clobber\nmejs.cssClasses = cssClasses\n// WordPress kills it\nmejs.cssClasses.player = 'mejs-player';\n// internally\n$(\u2018.\u2019 + mejs.cssClasses.player).mediaelementplayer();\n// users, nothing changes\n.mejs-player { color: red }\n``. @albell Can you prepare a new PR based on this so we can review it, and also share with the other Wordpress developers as soon as possible? Or do you need me to integrate something prior your PR?. I agree with it. @johndyer is this ok with you?. @albell Let me know if you need anything else from me. Keep me posted about the progress on this, please. Make sure you download the latest version I have fixed a couple of things in these last few days. @albell You make sure you usegit rebase` or clone a new repo before you work on this; some files have been removed to reduce the repo size and could be re pushed if your PR has not pruned them. Just an FYI. Yep I'm stopping any changes tonight and for the rest of the week unless it is a big bug. @bradyvercher currently @albell is working on a PR based on the comments of @ocean90 above. It seemed an easier and smart idea to implement for backward compatibility. Once it's ready I'll share the PR with you as well so you can review it. Sure let me check them and I'll keep you posted\n. @Kolunchik I checked your sources and these are my findings:\nFirst 2 will play properly with the code below. The third one has something else that I haven't figured out since Chrome sends this error: GET http://pub2.player-radio.ru/svoe/svoe-128.mp3/icecast.audio net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED\njavascript\n<span class=\"command\">\n                document.getElementById('player2').src = 'http://air.radiorecord.ru:8102/deep_320'; document.getElementById('player2').type = 'audio/mp3';\n            </span>\n            <span class=\"command\">\n                document.getElementById('player2').src = 'http://89.235.136.90:8000/live'; document.getElementById('player2').type = 'audio/mp3';\n            </span>\n            <span class=\"command\">\n                document.getElementById('player2').src = 'http://pub2.player-radio.ru/svoe/svoe-128.mp3/icecast.audio'; document.getElementById('player2').type = 'audio/mp3';\n            </span>\nIf you give me some hints about what could be the nature of that error I'd appreciate it to assist you to solve this issue\n. Did you copy/pasted the code exactly as I sent it? What I noticed during my testing is that it may say that in the beginning but then it changes; but the command of changing the source must be in the same line as the setting media type command. I tested on Chrome in Mac so I'll try testing this on FF and Chrome on Windows environment to see if I experience other problem but so far the first 2 links worked for me; just the third one couldn't be reproduced \n. Even if it says No renderer found, just hit the play button and see if you can play them. Sometimes it says that because of a sync time issue; try using autoplay attribute in the audio tag just in case but I could load them and then when hitting play they worked. I'll check the issue with the third source\n. Just FYI I tried to access directly the third source and this is what I have now:\n\n. The other 2 sources are fine if you just click in the source and hit play\n. Well glad I could assist you. Can you close this issue please if nothing else needs to be done?\n. Well glad I could assist you. Can you close this issue please if nothing else needs to be done?\n. This issue was moved to johndyer/mediaelement-plugins#2. @marmite22 Thanks for this PR. Can you based your PR on 3.x-dev instead of master please? That's the branch that will be released soon and if you wanna fold this PR immediately, I recommend you that approach\n. @marmite22 As a rule of thumb don't do anything in the build folder. Please undo any changes in the build and package.json files so I can review the src files(s) you modified only.\n. Yeah, that's it. I'll review it and merge if no feedback is necessary. Thanks\n. Can you please fix the conflicts so I can review this later?\n. Thanks. My apologies we merged that but we had to revert until a future decision is made. I'll review it as soon as I can\n. @evanhuntley Thanks for the update. I have a fix for the Speed feature and I'm looking just to fix one thing in there. I'll definitely take a look into the volume issue to restrict it to just interact with the up/down arrows if volume button or volume slider are focused\n. @marmite22 After more research and testing, it is coming to my realization that using radio checkboxes is not a good option neither for Closed Captioning and Speed given the tramps with tabs and to do this it will require a lot of hacks to make it work. I'd suggest to change the radio buttons for divs or button and include ARIA roles on each one of them so we avoid that tramp and have this working in the best possible way\n. @marmite22 You will see this if you have more than one video player in the same screen and both of them have closed captioning. Once you start using the arrows, it looses the focus on the current player you are at and focuses on the next one. That's the big and only issue with this\n. @marmite22 UPDATE: I think I found a way to make this work using tabindex. I'll keep you posted about this\n. @marmite22 I'm gonna merge this and I'll create a PR to fix the speed feature accessibility. I did more testing and included more videos in the same page and it's not an issue with Closed Captioning\n. @marmite22 Can you download the latest version of the plugin and test both Closed Captioning and Speed accessibility, please? I was able to change some things on the Speed feature, based on your fix for Closed Captioning to make it accessible as well. Please keep me posted. @evanhuntley FYI\n. @gitEdMax I'll check this and keep you posted\n. @gitEdMax First thing I noticed is that there's a malformed XML in the source you are trying to pull with the feature\n\nFix that so I can continue checking, please\n. @gitEdMax So powerfulpresentations.com/streams/testme3.html seems to work, but powerfulpresentations.com/streams/testme2.html doesn't correct?\n. In http://powerfulpresentations.com/streams/testme2.html I see this error:\n\nusing this config:\n``` javascript\n$('video').mediaelementplayer({\n    pluginPath: 'build/',\n        vastAdTagUrl: 'http://search.spotxchange.com/vast/2.0/85394?VPAID=SWF&content_page_url=http://powerfulpresentations.com/streams/testme2.html&cb=1003914&player_width=960&player_height=540',\n        vastEnableSkip: true,\n    vastSkipSeconds: 3,\n    features: ['playpause','current','progress','duration','volume','fullscreen','vast'],\nsuccess: function(media, node, player) {\n\n/*\n    for (var i=0; i<mediaEventNames.length; i++) {\n\n        (function(eventName) {\n            media.addEventListener(eventName, function(e) {\n                console.log('event', eventName);\n            });\n\n        })(mediaEventNames[i]);\n\n    }\n*/\n}\n\n});\n```\nbut in http://powerfulpresentations.com/streams/testme3.html I don't see the error:\n\nusing this config:\n``` javascript\n$('video').mediaelementplayer({\n    pluginPath: 'build/',\n        vastAdTagUrl: 'minoto-vast.xml',\n        vastEnableSkip: true,\n    vastSkipSeconds: 3,\n    features: ['playpause','current','progress','duration','volume','fullscreen','vast'],\nsuccess: function(media, node, player) {\n\n/*\n    for (var i=0; i<mediaEventNames.length; i++) {\n\n        (function(eventName) {\n            media.addEventListener(eventName, function(e) {\n                console.log('event', eventName);\n            });\n\n        })(mediaEventNames[i]);\n\n    }\n*/\n}\n\n});\n```\nThe XML on both have different structures. And as stated in the feature config:\njavascript\n// URL to vast data: 'http://minotovideo.com/sites/minotovideo.com/files/upload/eday_vast_tag.xml'\nvastAdTagUrl: ''\nso I don't think this feature will accept a different source if it's not Minotovideo\n. Seems that XML are different and that's why the plugin can't find the source to be played \n. @gitEdMax  I use Chrome Dev Tools\n. If there's nothing else you need on my side can you close this ticket please?\n. We'll close this issue since no more on our end is required. We can always reopen it if it is needed.Thanks!\n. No it hasn't been developed. I'll reopen that issue. Feel free to propose a PR but right now my entire focus is the release of the 3.0 version so any changes will be folded in that branch\n. @debasispanda Seems like there is an issue related HTTP and HTTPS and asynchronous requests; it seems intermittent and doesn't affect the player at all (https://help.clipchamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/216329537--API-How-do-I-fix-the-Failed-to-execute-postMessage-on-DOMWindow-error-)\n. @someonetookmyname The player instantiates the whole MediaElement wrapper and setCurrentTime is a function only related to the tag itself. Have tried with player.media.setCurrentTime?\n. I'll check this and also make sure that there's documentation about it\n. For now my focus is on 3.x-dev branch so any fixes will go to that branch given that we will release it soon\n. Of course If you test your issue I'm that branch and a test in general just to make sure we're solid I will appreciate it\n. @someonetookmyname I'll check this right now\n. @someonetookmyname I know why. play using player has a call to load() method. So it will load it first, so that causes to override the expected behavior. If you are using 3.x-dev branch, check mediaelement-and-player.js and comment line 1521. Let me know if that solves it so I can incorporate a fix in the core package.\n. My apologies. Line 7369 in that file\n. Exactly. I'll put the fix once I do more testing to make sure it won't affect anything\n. Can you do me a favor and test on iPhone please? I can't test it right now but if you can help me with that and in an iPad I'd appreciate it\n. I haven't put the fix yet but if you can use your files to test it would be great\n. I'm not sure I understand the last comment, but to give you some context of the nature of the piece of code added as a part of the play method that is messing with setCurrentTime: in 2013 a PR was submitted since they stated that there were issues with iPad when playing the video only; so to ensure that it will play properly, the added the load() method inside the play. I haven't seen this as an issue in other places, but you basically tested this on an iPad without issues. So basically we are invalidating the fix since it seems not needed. Let me know if you have any more questions or comments about this before I perform the fix\n. I had an emulator and I tested your example on it and everything went fine BTW\n. If you wanna do one last test, just hit the play button, and try to test including a video and audio on the same page. And then try to set the current time for both to 25. If you don't see any issues I think it's safe to say that solves the issue\n. OK I'll push in a minute the fix so you can test this; I'll do it in such a way that if the current time is 0 before playing I'd allow the loading; otherwise, only the play. I'll let you know when it's updated\n. OK it's ready. Download the latest version of 3.x-dev so you can test, please\n. We are currently working on getting a new website and I'm fixing minor things. We hope by the end of November but we'll try to release it as soon as possible. \n. If nothing else I need to do, can you close this ticket, please?\n. @isantolin There's already a speed feature for MediaElementJS. Please confirm\n. @isantolin Yes is there. mediaelementplayer-feature-speed.js. It only works for native HTML5\n. Reason why I haven't included it it's because the renderer is not ready yet. I'm finishing some details on it and then I'll merge this\n. @isantolin Thanks for this PR. The file is ready but I still see that the package needs to fix more things. So I won't incorporate it into the grunt tasks and neither mention it in the documentation until it solves some major things.\n. @isantolin The most complete one is the test/player-full.html file. Thanks for your help. We're so close\n. @isantolin Please post your results in this ticket so I can assess the results. In terms of IE just test IE9+; we are dropping support for IE8 and older browsers. Thanks\n. Thank you so much\n. Just FYI this is an issue that not only affects HLS but the video in general rendered through Flash\n. There's no single file anymore. Each type of file was divided so if you run sh compile_swf.sh it will be easier for you\n. If you can fix this issue on one of them we can port it to the other 2 types of video files\n. Use the compile file for testing only don't submit a PR with changes on the build folder please. Thanks for your help\n. Probably, but I tested 2.23.4 version that has your fix for this, but when I go fullscreen with http://thronqa-view.thron.com/api/xpublisher/resources/weebopublisher/getContentDescriptor.m3u8?clientId=thronqa&contentId=9f63b7df-6060-45ec-87b2-26407463ddb8&channelType=STREAMHTTPIOSHD&v=10 and then exit the dimensions are not correct.\nThat's also something I need your help with given that I'm not a AS3 expert. Thanks for your help\n. Thanks I appreciate it\n. @ale-grosselle Thank you very much for fixing this issue. Closing this issue since merged into 3.x-dev branch now\n. Thanks for pointing this. Can you test this on the 3.x-dev branch and let me know if that's an issue there? I'm currently maintaining that branch and it will be released soon so any fixes will go to that branch\n. I tested on the 3.x-dev branch and on my side works correctly. I'll wait for your response in the next couple of days; otherwise, we will close this issue and it can always be reopened. Thanks\n. Can you provide a URL to see the issue in FF please?\n. Vimeo should work as well as FLV; I assume M4A is the same as MP4 but needs to be added in the valid MIME types in the plugin. WMV and WMA are no longer supported since all major players have stopped the support. \n. I used the following files to test the player and all worked:\nhttp://techslides.com/demos/samples/sample.m4a (with type as audio/mp4)\nhttps://player.vimeo.com/video/59777392  (with type as video/x-vimeo)\nhttp://techslides.com/demos/samples/sample.flv (with type as video/flv)\nhttp://sites.lafayette.edu/newquisk/files/2011/08/ken-video.m4v?_=1 (with type as video/mp4)\n. I'll check the flv and for Vimeo I'll add code to parse that URL since it's only considering the structure of the URL I described above. I'll keep you posted. Ok I'll take a look and let you know my findings. Thanks. @Wolfcast I've added support for the Vimeo URL you listed above. Please download the latest version of 3.x-dev branch. \nChecking the markup you set up I noticed you are setting an <object> tag inside the video tag and that might be conflicting with the creation of the new embed/object tag that allows the proper displaying of Flash. Besides, your object is pointing to a Flash shim that doesn't exist anymore, because each type of media has its own swf file. SO I strongly discourage the use of that approach.\nTry this markup:\nhtml\n<video id=\"player1\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" preload=\"none\" class=\"mejs-player\" \ndata-mejsoptions='{ \"pluginPath\": \"/path/to/build/\", \"alwaysShowControls\": \"true\", \"pauseOtherPlayers\": \"false\" }'>\n    <source src=\"http://avaliquette.com/me-debug/z-samples/video-sample.flv\" type=\"video/flv\">\n</video>\nIt should work that way. Let me know. @Wolfcast I did a test with your markup and seems like if you just set the proper path to the mediaelement shim correctly you shouldn't get any conflicts.\nTry this:\nhtml\n<video id=\"player1\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" preload=\"none\" >\n    <source src=\"z-samples/video-sample.flv\" type=\"video/flv\">\n    <object type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" data=\"/path/to/build/mediaelement-flash-video.swf\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\">\n        <param name=\"movie\" value=\"/path/to/build/mediaelement-flash-video.swf\">\n        <param name=\"flashvars\" value=\"controls=true&amp;file=z-samples%2Fvideo-sample.flv\">\n        Your Web browser does not support video playback!\n    </object>\n</video>\nI also updated the documentation on the same branch so you have the reference for the shims to use for that situation. In the latest version Vimeo worked for me but I'll double check. You need to read the documentation in the 3.x-dev branch since all the information is there. I recommend specifically the Usage and Installation sections. Make sure you download the latest version of the branch since that's where the fix for Vimeo was set. I see an error coming form loading Vimeo player API script. I need to check why because it was working a couple of days ago. Indeed is an error from Vimeo (https://github.com/vimeo/player.js/issues/85). Ok Vimeo should be working now. As for the flv files, yes you must indicate the path with pluginPath; that is expected. I added a note in the documentation for this branch. If no more issues, can you close this ticket, please?. I just see a change of line. Did I looked in the wrong place?\n. I'll check this. Thanks for pointing this\n. @isantolin I checked this, and although it plays, I saw that it requires a lot of power processing and in a mobile device that's not good. If you have another options, I'm open to review them. But this one is old (last update was 2013) and has the issue mentioned above. Thanks I'll check the Soundcloud and the Flash missing method; at this point other than those 2 all looks good in the end. \n. @isantolin UPDATE: I fixed most of the issues. The warning is something related to Dailymotion's API, and if the browsers doesn't have Flash there' nothing we can do about it. I'm currently researching the Flash M-DASH issue. I'll keep you posted with more information about this one. Thanks\n. @isantolin M-DASH issue fixed as well. Please test again and let me know. Thanks for your help\n. Thank you very much for fixing this issue\n. @lucash Thanks for this PR. Can you create the PR for the 3.x-dev branch, please? That's the one I'm currently maintaining and it will be released soon\n. @isantolin Thanks for testing again. I'll take a look in this last issue and keep you posted\n. @isantolin I just checked this one on Browserstack and I don't see the issue\n\n. @isantolin Interesting. I'll try with a VBox instance to see if I can reproduce this issue.\n. @isantolin I tried with a VBox using IE9 and it worked\n\n. @isantolin So I think we are good to go since that has something to do with the computer configuration and not the plugin. Can you close this issue please?\n. Thanks for the new PR. Merged now\n. @dariusj18 Thanks. I'll add this fix right now in the 3.x-dev branch given that is the branch I'm currently maintaining and it will be released soon.\n. @dariusj18 Change merged into 3.x-dev branch. Closing this issue.\n. @SeventhCycle You need to use max-width: 100% to make a video fit in the div. Let me know if that works for you.\n. @SeventhCycle No it shouldn't but we introduced a fix for the responsive mode and maybe it have an effect on this scenario\n. Just use the max-width method for now; I'll check this tonight and keep you posted\n. @SeventhCycle I tested using width and height with 100% and I get this as a result:\n\nIs that not the expected result? I remember seeing the issue with the player being beyond the boundaries of the DIV but I don't see that here\n. @SeventhCycle I see what you are saying. I'll keep looking at this. Thanks for your help\n. @SeventhCycle After testing some more, I noticed that in the 2.x version you are using that workflow used to work; some versions later it stopped working. When you resize the video on 2.23.4 version, it doesn't do it correctly. On 3.x-dev, by using o the max-width style, it works at it should. So I'm checking the 2.19.0 version that you are using to see what's different. I'll keep you posted.\n. @SeventhCycle Please download the latest version of 3.x-dev branch and test again; seems that I fixed the workflow of this. Keep me posted\n. @SeventhCycle Here's the proof that it's working now on 3.x-dev\n\n. @SeventhCycle Thanks for your help\n. You may wanna check 3.x-dev branch. Some issues related to accessibility have been addressed there. Let me know if it works for you. We will release it soon\n. Sure. No problem. I'll just label it as complete for now\n. 3.0 version has been released.. @SiddiquiImran I'll check this. However, the error you are seeing is from YouTube directly. Not from the plugin. @SiddiquiImran I tested the URL above and I didn't experience any issues; I used a Samsung Galaxy with Android 4.4.4\n\n\n\n. As an update there was an issue with Vimeo's API but now it got solved. That might caused your issue. If you don't have any more issues related to this, please close this ticket. @FrankDaze Yes it looks like something related to the hls.js package. Please submit an issue to https://github.com/dailymotion/hls.js and keep me posted on this. Thanks.. I tested the full-player.html file in Win10 IE11 and everything was fine in both HLS files I had set up there.\n\n. @FrankDaze Thanks for pointing this. Just make sure you create a ticket for the HLS team so they fix this. Closing this issue now. I saw that it got resolved. Thanks. Thanks for pointing this out. I'll check it and give an update soon. Is this for iPhone or iPad? Because on iPhone I can see the Play button (although is native player). Can you send an animated gif so I can see what you are seeing please?. Never mind I was able to reproduce it. I'll keep you posted. @Biont After a lot of research I decided to display MEJS play button and hide the native one completely so that way when exiting fullscreen mode you will see it. Please download the latest version of the 3.x-dev branch and let me know if it works for you. Thanks. Thank you let me know so I can close this issue. Thank you for testing this. Closing this issue now. Please check 3.x-dev branch to confirm that this issue was resolved. The controls will be hidden in the beginning and it will be displayed once the user positions the mouse on the player. Thanks for testing it; if you agree I'll close this PR since the intended behavior is set correctly on 3.x-dev. @gitEdMax If you wanna get the number, you need to concat correctly the variable. Like this:\nvastAdTagUrl: 'http://search.spotxchange.com/vast/2.0/85394?VPI=MP4&content_page_url=http://powerfulpresentations.com/streams/testme2d.html&cb=+' + ord + '&player_width=960&player_height=540',\nLet me know if it worked for you. You didn't use quotes. It should be eaxctly '&cb=+' + ord + '...'; otherwise, it won't work. I tested it on my phone and I didn't see anything wrong. This is just a matter of concatenation; what I wrote above is the example of how to concatenate the ord variable but you have to indicate the rest of the URL if that's what broke it . The browser will read the tag as it is; te fact that the variable is by displaying a number there doesn't mean is not gonna be processed as one. That's the same principle with any dynamic variables in any other programming language. If you leave it like that the browser will never cache the URL since that number always change even if you can't see it directly on the tag. You can print the tag like this:\n```javascript\nvar tag = 'http://search.spotxchange.com/vast/2.0/85394?VPI=MP4&content_page_url=http://powerfulpresentations.com/streams/testme2d.html&cb=+' + ord + '&player_width=960&player_height=540';\nconsole.log(tag);\n$('video').mediaelementplayer({\n    pluginPath: 'build/',\n        vastAdTagUrl: tag,\n        // ... Rest of configuration\n});\n``. You are welcome. Closing this issue now. Can you test 3.x-dev branch and let me know if that's an issue there? Currently that's the branch that will be released soon. Can you test 3.x-dev branch and let me know if that's an issue there? Currently that's the branch that will be released soon. @milikicn Thanks for pointing this. Can you download the latest version of 3.x-dev branch and test this again? I set the workflow properly for the player and it should fire now a pause event when clicking on the rail. Thanks for testing the library. Let me know if you find anything else before the release . @marjune163 Thanks for pointing this. Currently my focus is on the 3.x-dev branch that will be released soon, and in that branch we stopped support for IE8.. Just for curiosity, I tested this on Browserstack using IE8 on Win7 and I couldn't reproduce this.. I did not know that there were controls there. Thanks for catching this. As I mentioned above my current focus is 3.x-dev branch, and I reviewed the actionscript files and that issue is not there. Please test that branch and let me know if it works for you. Can this ticket be closed due to comment above?. @marjune163 currently the tracks are being stored astrack.entries.times, which contains astartandstopelements. So the data structure you are trying to create is an array like:track[start] = text, correct?. I can create a separate branch so you can test if that's what you need and if it is we will integrate on the 3.x-dev branch is that ok?. @marjune163  Can you please check the branchvarious-fixesto confirm this was integrated properly, please?. @marjune163 I added a comment back to see if you have any ideas how can we address your concern. Hope to hear from you soon to close the loop on this. I added this workflow in 3.x-dev branch. Can you test this so I can close this issue, please?. Thanks for pointing this out. We are currently in the process to release a new version of the player and with it a new website. When released, please let us know if this is still an issue. I'll keep you posted about the progress of this. @AbdurrahmanAyyildiz this is the website we are working on but the issue you mentioned is solved. Please check if the issue is there: http://johndyer.github.io/mediaelement/. If not we can close this ticket. Yeah it won't be solved on http://mediaelementjs.com since the other website will superseed it and there's no point to fix it if the other website will be the main website. The way I solved this is by wrapping the video/audio tag in a div and assigning a visibility hidden to the div; in thesuccess` callback when creating mediaelement I change the visibility to visible in the divs. That way looks more natural and you completely hide the players until they are ready. Something like this:\nThe style:\ncss\n.players {\n    visibility: hidden;\n}\nThe markup:\n```html\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe callback:javascript\n$('video, audio').mediaelementplayer({\n    // Other configuration\n    succes: function() {\n        $('.players').css('visibility', 'visible');\n    }\n})\n``. Let me know if I can close this ticket as well. @AbdurrahmanAyyildiz You are welcome; before releasing the new version I'll add this workflow for the demo file we have prepared.. Can you provide a URL when I can check your issue please?. Thanks I'll check this and let you know my findings. Just FYI I have posted a question to the team of Dash.js about this; it's a very interesting bug and I haven't figured out what causes it. I'll keep you posted. @izar89 I was able to reproduce this on a Mac Sierra environment using Chrome and FF; where did you reproduce this?. Yeah that's what I thought. This is an issue with MacOS. They said they don't experience this issue with Windows. So I'll add this to the ticket. Thanks for the info. @izar89 Ok please download the latest version and let me know if it works for you now. Just an FYI this is an issue with thedash.jslibrary and they are aware of it, so they will try to solve it in the next days. Thanks and let me know if it worked for you.. Thanks I'll change that later. Glad everything is working now. I'll close this issue and thanks for testing this again . Thanks for this PR. @marjune163 Thanks for pointing this. I removed that after testing it and confirming no issues were brought by removing it. Closing this ticket now. Thanks for pointing this. Can you test 3.x-dev branch and check if the issue exists there please?. Perfect. I'll investigate this. Thanks. Can you send me a URL of the media you used to test this? Or an URL I can check with a phone?. OK I'll investigate this. Thanks for the info. I'll keep you posted. If you can post an issue on StackOverflow with the tagyoutube-iframe-api` related to this to see what's going on I'd appreciate it. Keep me posted.. @osamasheikh28c I posted the issue on Stackoverflow but I haven't have any answers yet. Have you found anything on your side? Or is this fixed?. @osamasheikh28c You are welcome. About the progress bar, everything inside of it is calculated with percentages. Here's a screenshot to proof the progress bar uses percentages by default\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions/comments. For now, closing this issue\n. @AbdurrahmanAyyildiz I tested this on Chrome, and you have to consider that since it's a pure MP3 and not a streaming (for what it seems) the browser by default will start loading the data so it can play.. Are you experiencing any issues with the fact is preloading? If not can you close this issue?. I see I'll check this ASAP thanks for giving more information . Also you should use preload=\"none\" to test this since preload=\"false\" doesn't have any effect. The correct values are none or auto. I think this will solve your problem since has nothing to do with the plugin itself: http://www.w3schools.com/TAgs/att_video_preload.asp.\nLet me know if it worked for you. @laupow Thanks for this PR; 2 things:\n1) Just make sure you pulled a fresh clone or you did git rebase given some changes done to reduce the size of the repo\n2) Currently I'm maintaining 3.x-dev branch; if you want to include this PR, please do it based on that branch. We'll release it soon. Thanks. I'll review this and if no comments to add I'll merge it by the end of this week. Thanks. @laupow PR merged; I just modified something for the \"None\" caption since it wasn't being selected properly. Other than that, great job.. Thanks for this PR. Just to make sure everything is fine did you created a new repo or run git rebase in order to bring some changes related to the repo siZe? If not I encourage you to do it otherwise it will carry some files that should be there. On another note I couldn't find your fix can you point where is it?. Thanks I'll check this and let you know when it's fixed. @andyh4 Seems like that's a potential solution; as a favor can you implement in your local environment and test in desktop and mobile the fix specified in https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/issues/1609#issuecomment-261255607 and let me know if that works so I can implement it in the core package, please?. Yeah I'm curious to see if that could solve this issue by adding that into the full screen feature in te enterFullscreen() method. If not I'll check if your approach is enough. It should given that fullscreen is meant to use 100% in both dimensions. With your approach it doesn't break anything in different browsers (desktop) and devices (iOS and Android)?. @andyh4 I integrated the fix in the various-fixes branch, can you confirm that this is fixed there before I merge it into 3.x-dev please? Use the test/player-full.html file for testing this. @andyh4 I removed the branch but the solution you were talking about was:\njavascript \nif (isNative) {\n    t.$media\n        .width('100%')\n        .height('100%')\n                .css('min-width','100%').css('min-height','100%');\n} else {\n    t.container.find('iframe, embed, object, video')\n        .width('100%')\n        .height('100%')\n                .css('min-width','100%').css('min-height','100%');\n}\nfor the enterFullscreen() method and \njavascript\nif (isNative) {\n    t.$media\n        .width(t.normalWidth)\n        .height(t.normalHeight)\n                .css('min-width','initial').css('min-height','initial');\n} else {\n    t.container.find('iframe, embed, object')\n        .width(t.normalWidth)\n        .height(t.normalHeight)\n                .css('min-width','initial').css('min-height','initial');\n}\nfor the exitFullscreen(), correct? Let me know so I can add it into 3.x-dev branch, please. Thanks. @andyh4 Just FYI your fix was cleaner than the other approach and it's a valid approach using !important on the CSS styles. I pushed this fix and the latest version has this fixed. I used Android for testing and everything seems fine. Let me know if it works for you and close this ticket please. @marjune163 can you check this please?. Nevermind, I figured out what happened. @laupow I'll push the fix tonight. @laupow Pushed fix; please confirm that it is fixed now. @marjune163 FYI. Thanks for the work on this PR. @ocean90 and @bradyvercher can you assist on reviewing this branch please? I'll do it also first thing in the morning. @albell Overall LGTM just need to fix some minor things listed; I'd also be tempted to include the \"classic\" classes inside the stylesheets so we have full backward compatibility. @ocean90 and @bradyvercher thoughts?. @albell The comments made in the PR from me and @ocean90 should be addressed. If you check the tab Files Changed and start browsing the files that were modified, you will see the comments we have made. @albell As far as the \"legacy\" stylesheet I'm ok with that approach; we just need to indicate it in the documentation. @ocean90 Thoughts about this?. @ocean90 The idea of a template engine will involve the use of another framework and the end goal is to have the plugin framework agnostic. I think this is the only scenario and I don't think it's worth the use of a template engine for this single task. @albell Indeed I can perform the fixes tonight. And yes, @ocean90, I'm currently working on a branch to move the code into ES6 and we'll solve this issue with the strings, but as it is right it will remain in its current state. So if there are no objections, this is what I'll do tonight:\n1) Fix the issues I found\n2) Fix the issues @ocean90 found\n3) Create the \"legacy\" stylesheet so we have it available in the build folder\n4) Add a note in the documentation about this change\nAnything else that I may be missing @albell and @ocean90? . @albell Thanks for the work on this PR. @ocean90 Thanks for reviewing this. PR merged into 3.x-dev. Thanks for the PR. We wil release 3.x-dev version soon so if you wanna test this in that branch I'd appreciate it so we can close the loop on this. @bricev The way to force shims in 3.x-dev is through the use of specific renderers in the renderers element in the configuration of the player:\njavascript\n$('video, audio').mediaelementplayer({\n    renderers: ['flash_video', 'flash_audio', 'flash_mdash', 'flash_hls', 'flash_audio_ogg']\n});\nThat way you are forcing Flash to be the renderer. Since right now we are dealing with more types of media, the Flash was split in different files, so that's why if you need more than video, you'll need to indicate one or more of the ones listed above. Let me know if you have any other concerns and happy to answer any questions. All of this of course is documented in the 3.x-dev documentation. Closing this PR since 3.x-dev already contains this fix. @thejamespower Thanks for reporting this. Can you test the 3.x-dev branch to check if this issue is there, please? We are planning to release that branch soon. You can test in IE8 and let me nnow if you see any issues and I can guide you from there. The first issue is the SVGs so I'll recommend you to create custom CSS to support png for the control bar and big play button. Other than that I can't think of anything else but let me know . Closing this issue now. Ok I'll check it and let you know what you can do to support IE8 in a minute. You might need to check the demo file in the 3.x branch as well to see if there are other outstanding issues. Or can you provide me a URL to check it on IE8 please?. OK I found out a couple of things that could affect IE8. I fixed some of the things but the most outstanding one was the fact that if I set the files at the top instead at the bottom it will work immediately. Can you check again please doing that change of the JS files putting them at the top?. Did you download the latest version of 3.x-dev? That's where I fixed that thing and tested putting the files at the top. That's odd. I used browserstack to test this in IE8 and worked for me. I'll try to take a second look.. @thejamespower I used the demo file in 3.x-dev, tested in Browserstack on Win7 IE8 and it worked for me.\n\nThe only thing is the icons since they are SVGs.\nHere's the markup I used for the demo file; please test it and let me know:\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n\n\n\n\nMediaElement.js 3.0 - audio/video unification library\n\n\n\n<style>\n\n    #container {\n

Interesting. Let's see if I can get a IE8 virtual box and test this directly there and I'll let you know. @johndyer I noticed that this PR is based on master. Are we ready to flip the switch for 3.x-dev to master?. Yeah I like the look overall; really pleased with it. Everything looks good; only thing missing is the replay icon and update thebackgroundstyle for themejs__replay > buttonelement. Nm, I can add this and with that I'll submit this PR. Thanks. Merged now. Thanks for this PR. @Aybee Thanks for pointing this. Can you try 3.x-dev version and check if the issue is there, please? That's my current focus since it will be released soon. I'll take a look and let you know asap. @Aybee I tested using setCurrentTime and it worked for me using the latest version. Just FYI you cannot configure any iframe vars since if it only needs a certain configuration and it will be overkill to override things. Besides, we need to maintain consistency for all the other media types, so that's why they got removed. Test it and let me know. Thanks. In which browser you are testing? I checked on Chrome and Firefox and worked for me. I set up the JS for the setCurrentTime option and that did the trick . Oh I see that you tested on Firefox 50.10. Let me take a look at which version I have. For reference I'm using Mac for this, which OS you are using?. I have no issues in FF 50.10 Mac using the following code in/test/youtube.htmlin3.x-dev` branch:\n```javascript\nvar elements = mejs.getElementsByClassName('mejs-player');\nfor (var i=0, il=elements.length; i<il; i++) {\n    var player = new MediaElementPlayerSimple(elements[i], {\n            success: function(media, node, player) {\n                media.setCurrentTime(60);\n                //media.pause();\n            }\n    });\n}\n\n```\nLet me know if works for you or provide me a URL so I can check this issue. Thanks. Thanks for the URL I'll check it and keep you posted. The iframe in the example seems to not have the same class as the video tag; can you add it to the iframe and let me know if it works for you?. Good to know. Closing issue per your comments. Can you indicate which button you are talking about, please?. You are right. Some of this parameters cannot be touched like enablejsapi but the ones you mention totally. I'll integrate some of them through a configuration variable so you can override them. @Aybee Thanks for pointing this out, because I found a bug that was causing the variables to not be passed and overridden. I'll get a fix soon, and you can test again in 3.x-dev branch. @Aybee Fix is in place; please confirm that it works for you. Download the latest version of 3.x-dev and you can set start and end, as well as other variables from the Youtube API, using the following in the /test/youtube.html:\njavascript\nvar player = new MediaElementPlayerSimple(elements[i], {\n               // Other configuration\n        youtube: {\n            start: 60\n        }\n    });. In the test file the iframe doesn't have the class that the video tag; can you add the class and let me know if it works for you?. Thanks for confirming. Closing issue now. Thanks for pointing this. I'll provide support for this by allowing that type of URL to be accepted. The change will be placed on 3.x version. @Aybee Currently you can use youtube-nocookie.com in 3.x-dev with no issues in FF and Chrome. Test it and let me know. This is what I used in the /test/youtube.htmlfile:\nhtml\n<video width=\"640\" height=\"360\" class=\"mejs-player\" id=\"player1\" preload=\"none\" controls>\n    <source src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/twYp6W6vt2U\" >\n</video>\nLet me know if that works for you. Thanks for testing this. I'll add the option later today but closing this ticket per your answer above.. @FrankDaze I'll check this and let you know what are my findings. @FrankDaze can you test /test/hls.js file and see if the same behavior happens there, please? Need to confirm if it is something related to the player or to hls.js. thanks. @FrankDaze Thanks for the research. I'll add a workflow to pause video/audio if not displayed. @FrankDaze can you check the latest version of 3.x-dev and confirm this is solved, please? Thanks and happy holidays!. Closing this issue since no more comments added in the past 2 weeks. If you would like to be reopen please let us know. Thanks. @NayanKhedkar Can you test 3.x-dev and tell me if the issue is there, please?. I think something is not referenced correctly since the player bar looks different on 3.x-dev can you send me a URL so I can check this, please?. Just post the HTML you used and I'll take a look. This is what I see on 3.x-dev branch on FF:\n\n\nNotice that the icons and controlbar looks different than in your test. Please confirm.\n. Closing this issue since no more comments added in the past 2 weeks. If you would like to be reopen please let us know. Thanks. I added some comments to this PR; as a general note, can you base this PR from 3.x-dev, please? It will be released soon. And as a rule please clone a new repo or perform a git rebase from your current repo, since some changes were made to the repo in general to shrink the size of the repo. @SoftCreatR Thanks for the PR. However, given the changes performed to make 3.0 version work, you need to update this PR. Closing this to favor a new PR that reflects latest changes. @AbdurrahmanAyyildiz Styles added just on demo folder along with explanation. @MosheL Thanks for pointing this. Opera seems to support better WebM than MP4; my advise is to have 2 sources in the event it doesn't plays it correctly. And as you indicated, this is an Opera bug itself and I'd hate to introduce hacks in the core package. Some useful info in https://dev.opera.com/articles/html5-video-flash-fallback-custom-controls/. Interesting. I may need to research some more about this one. I'll keep you posted. Seems that the best solution is to implement what you just implemented to cover most of the scenarios, but I have 2 questions:\n1) Why to do you target HLS videos as native in Android with this line: type.indexOf(\"mpegURL\")>0?\n2) What is the purpose of this element: navigator.userAgent.indexOf(\"Android\") >4? Why not just use navigator.userAgent.indexOf(\"Android\") > -1\n. ok I'll check this and implement a solution for this. Thanks. @MosheL Please test the fix for this by downloading the latest version of 3.x-dev branch and close this ticket if it worked; now it is being detected native support for HLS not just on Android but also on Safari and Edge, and your workaround to force support to MP3 and MP4 in Android has been integrated. Thanks.. Closing this ticket since fix has been merged to 3.x-dev branch. Thanks. @MosheL Thanks for the advise. I'll see how I can integrate an option to indicate the script path for each one of the renderers and I'll let you know. @MosheL If you can indicate what systems the HTTPS protocol won't work I'd appreciate it to justify  the removal of the protocol as a whole and just use the abbreviated way of URL: //cdn.jsdelivr.net/hls.js/latest/hls.min.js. @MosheL Please test renderers-path branch. Each one of the renderers now includes a path element to indicate the location of the library, so you can use a local library if needed. Let me know if that works for you and I'll wait for your response in terms of the HTTPS protocol issue so I can modify it if necessary on this branch, and then merge it into 3.x-dev. I'd think that the HTTPS should cause any conflicts even if you use an HTTP connection; the reverse would actually cause issues. Let me know about this, and if it is a really valid concern I'll remove the protocol. And yes, I agree with the DASH and HLS approach. I can set up this for FLV as well, but please test and let me know if this works for you before I do anything else. @MosheL I see. I'll add the path option only for DASH, HLS and FLV and remove the protocol in the libraries overall. I'll let you know when it's ready.. @MosheL New enhancements described above now added in 3.x-dev branch. Please let me know if it works for you and if so, close this ticket please. Thanks.. Closing this ticket since fix has been merged to 3.x-dev branch. Thanks. Thanks for the PR; however, can you elaborate some scenarios when this is useful? Second thing is I don't see the JS code related to the plugin. And finally, I'm not currently maintining the 2.x but the 3.x branch. The PR must be based on 3.x branch so I can consider it. And that means either clone a new repo or perform a git rebase to carry some changes to shrink the size of the repo. Thanks for this PR. However, this effect known as backlight was available but we decide to take it out of the plugin since it's more like a custom effect rather than a standard effect. @johndyer thoughts about this?. @johndyer Can you review this one please?. And this one could go to the plugins repo, not the main player. Closing this since this PR belongs to the MediaElement Plugins repo, not the main player. The request was on #1891 but nothing has been done. Can you review the approach on that issue and let me know if that's what you are talking about?. Since ticket has been created and tagged properly, I'll close this one and you can follow up the progress on this through the ticket listed above. Thanks.. Thanks for this PR can you create a PR based on 3.x-dev branch please? It's gonna be released soon. As a rule no file should be committed on the build folder; please do the change in arc folder. Plus the family number should be 7 according to mediaelement-i18n.js file and there should be 3 plurals instead of 2 according to the rules of pluralization for that language. Please create the necessary modifications (including the one mentioned above) so it can be merged. Closing this PR to favor #1980. Closing this PR to favor #1980. Looks much better! I recommend you to take a look into the English file and check the missing strings since I don't see many of them. if you can help us to fill the gaps I'd really appreciate it. Also I don't know if you know other languages or translations that you can assist us filling in those gaps. Let me know if so . Thanks for pointing this. I'll fix this asap and let you know. Closing issue since fix has been placed in 3.x-dev branch. Thanks. This issue is already been solved; please download the latest version that takes care of detecting if browsers supports native HLS and let me know if it works for you. Use the classPrefix: 'mejs-' in the configuration and use the mediaelementplayer-legacy.css style sheet. You should be fine with it. The 2 tags is expected; we preserve the original node in the event we need to extract other info, like the original URL of the HLS source before it's been converted to BLOB by hls.js. Let me check the issue with the play button, but is the issue stated on this ticket resolved?. I see. Let me test one more time, because I tested on Safari (another browser that supports native HLS) and I didn't get the second video tag. BTW, which Android device are you using, and what browser are you using? I have a Samsung Galaxy version 4.4.2. Perfect I appreciate your help. I'll check this and keep you posted. I just tested http://johndyer.github.io/mediaelement/ in my Android device and directly selected the HLS source. I see only a video tag\n\nThe website is using the latest version of 3.x-dev. I'm gonna try to use Browserstack to see if I can test your environment, but it shouldn't be different. I could test Nexus 9 with Android 5.1 and I see only a video tag\n\n. It should you just need to use git checkout 3.x-dev inside the folder to change to that branch. Sounds good; keep me posted . Glad you found the problem. So can you see the expected output in Android now?. Sounds good. Let me know when you finish your tests so I can close this issue please. Which browser are you testing so I can attempt to reproduce the issue?. Oh I see what you are saying. So what you are seeing is if you slide up the bar goes down? Or is another behavior?. Gotcha. Any other issue?. Well keep me posted about any other issues and I'll wait for your final feedback. You are welcome. Glad I could help you. Not currently. We'll need to analyze how complex is to do this particular feature. Let me know and if it's feasible, create a PR. Closing this ticket meanwhile. Thanks for pointing this. I'll fix it in the 3.x-dev branch, since it is my major focus and it will be released soon.. Fix set in place for 3.x-dev branch. Since this might be affecting a great number of users, I'll put the fix on 2.x version and push a new release in a minute. Closing this ticket now.. What exactly is your PR about?. Thanks for the PR; merged now on 3.x-dev branch. Thanks for pointing this. Let me check this and I'll keep you posted. @daveyshindig Please check your CodePen again; now that is using the latest version of 3.x-dev branch, I just finished added that feature so you will see Live Broadcast as Safari does. Please let me know and close this ticket if it worked for you. Ok I'll take a look to that and let you know when the fix is ready. I suppose I need to use the code pen above to test this right?. @daveyshindig Ready it should work now. Check your CodePen and let me know. You are welcome. Thanks for the PR; can you base the PR on 3.x-dev branch, please? I'm currently maintaining that branch and it will be released soon. Just for precaution, start a new cloned repo or use git rebase in case you contributed in the past, since changes were made to the repo to shrink its size. LGTM as long as you add the missing items I pointed out are addressed. Thanks for your PR. Merged now. @ricking06 Use the 3.x-dev branch and using the youtube config you can enable the control bar. Something like this:\njavascript\n$('video').mediaelementplayer({\n     // Other config\n     youtube: {\n         controls: 1\n         // Other config from https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters#Parameters\n     }\n});\nLet me know if that works for you. . Glad to hear it. Hi @FrankDaze you'll need to use the mediaelementplayer-feature-ads-vast.js file after the mediaelement script in 3.x-dev. See #1946 for more details. @yang06061079 we are releasing tomorrow the new version of the player. Once it's out, can you check if it's still an issue, please? This new version has rewritten the core package and fixed at the same time many bugs. You can check it now. This issue will be closed since the pluginApi variable doesn't exist anymore on the current version. Yes I removed it today we will release the 3.0 version using the mejs-ES6-final branch, so I needed to do some branch cleaning. Can you provide a URL where I can chec this please?. And which browser did you use? I set the parameter on my demo file and tested on Chrome and the controls are hiding after 2 seconds, which is the default time set with the controlsTimeoutMouseEnter option. Ok thanks. Just FYI I tried with FF 50.1.0 on Mac and it worked. It delays for 2 seconds or so, because it is configured that way. If you add controlsTimeoutMouseEnter: 1000 and hideVideoControlsOnLoad: true to your config you will see it hiding more quickly. Ok let me check since the files should be updated automatically to the CDN. @sharathdaniel Please download the package from GitHub again and test; I found out that there was a conditional missing that caused that in the mediaelementplayer bundle. Try it and let me know. The CDN won't get updated until I release the next version, so I'm working on some other issues and I'll try to get the next version by the end of next week. Alternatively you can use https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johndyer/mediaelement/master/build/mediaelement-and-player.min.js in your Fiddle and test; I did it myself and it worked as well. You are welcome. @isantolin Not anymore. @johndyer can you remove this from the GituHub description and the website please? . Thanks @johndyer. Closing this issue. @johndyer I checked it and still see it in the description\n\n. And also we need to remove it from the GituHub page. I can't do it because I can't modify the header of the project. @arsteam Thanks for checking this. I'll test this on Browserstack and let you know. @arsteam I checked this on Browserstack and I couldn't reproduce it. Browserstack doesn't have a WinServer machine thought and I don't have a way to test it in the specific one that you are. This is more an issue with the machine itself than the browser\n\n. i see let me see if I can get a win10 machine and install the Vbox there. Or try on Browserstack that combination. I'll keep you posted. Thanks .  Can you also send me screenshots of your console so I can have a better sense of what is the problem on your side please while I try to reproduce the issue on my side?. So if you are on IE11 and you check your settings icon, you must see one option that says Developer Tools (or use F12, I believe). It will open a subwindow in which there are several options; one of them is Console. Refresh the page without closing the subwindow and it will start debugging the JS code and showing any types of warnings or errors. That's what I'm interested in seeing. Sorry for the typos. My autocomplete function was a mess. To give you an status: I tried to emulate this environment in my Mac using VBox and installing Win7 IE11 but everything was fine. Unfortunately I can't reproduce this on my side so I'm gonna rely on the screenshots and info you can provide me. My apologies . Any updates on this?. Closing this issue since no updates have been posted for the past 2 weeks. If you want us to reopen it, let us know. Thanks. Thanks for pointing this. This is actually the first time we package mediaelement in Meteor so it is also a learning experience for us. So I'll be happy to take a look to this. The styles can be fixed by using the classPrefix: 'MEJS-' in your configuration and use the mediaelementplayer-legacy.css style sheet . I will add the missing documentation on the RequireJS based on my tests. It will be helpful if you also post your HTML so I can try to replicate this issue . Just FYI the official Meteor package was pushed during the release of this version. Ok keep me posted because I as said this is the first time I post a package to Meteor and idk if I missed something. Interesting. Yeah I need to check that because as far as I'm concerned I did put the code to export it. Can you tell me the command you used to download the official package from Meteor? I'll try to set up a Meteor environment in my machine. Oh ok I thought you had to do something else. Thanks and I'll keep you posted. Oh ok. Have you tested this with NPM? That's something that was supported before and I didn't know that about meteor. @daveyshindig  Ok I've done a little update and when testing this I found out that the error is gone if I import the node_module package like this:\njavascript\nimport '/path/to/node_modules/mediaelement/build/mediaelement-and-player';\nLet me know if that works for you, so I can add this in the documentation. Could you use the line I posted above to load mediaelementplayer?. I didn't set the path since I was trying to investigate the first issue. Let me check how to reference it properly. @daveyshindig  Please download the latest version of the package and read the documentation about Usage to learn how to import the package. Let me know if that works for you. I'm still checking the path for the Flash shims, but I'm tempted to say /packages/johndyer_mediaelement/build/; I may need to look at the shims and see if the actions are being executed or not. But I'll keep you posted. Sounds good to me. Bon App\u00e9tit!. Great recommendation. I just remember that, in order to make this valid I need to push the changes to NPM and Meteor and can only do it when a new release comes. Tomorrow I'll push it. My apologies . Also refer to the comments on #1999 where it's proven to work. Just need to push the new release. BTW, I think the proper path for the Flash shims is /packages/johndyer_mediaelement/build/ but test when it's ready please. @daveyshindig Version 3.0.1 has been released so try it with the above and let me know. Any updates on this?. Thanks. Keep me posted. Yes please that's a separate issue. Thanks for confirming this and if you haven't starred this repo I invite you to do it so we can have more visibility. Just FYI I don't know which browser you tested but at least I tried Chrome, FF and Safari using the following markup and it worked:\nhtml\n<audio id=\"player2\" preload=\"none\" controls>\n        <source src=\"http://stream.ktuh.org:8000/stream-mp3\" type=\"audio/mp3\">\n</audio>\nand the JS config like this:\njavascript\n$('video, audio').mediaelementplayer({\n     pluginPath: '/path/to/build/'\n});\nI used the demo file for this test and the result is consistent in the 3 browsers mentioned above:\n\n. Thanks for pointing this. Does your PR solve this issue?. I'll also remove the babel-loader; during my tests I was trying to use webpack but I ended up using browserify and I forgot to remove it. OK let me investigate about the build issue and keep you posted. Meanwhile I'll merge your PR. Thanks.. @neonaut Please download the latest version of the package and read the documentation about Usage to learn how to import the package. Let me know if that works for you. Thanks. Thanks for the suggestion I'll remove the string per you comment above and I'm glad it worked for you. Thanks for the suggestion I'll remove the string per you comment above and I'm glad it worked for you. Thanks. PR Merged . Thanks for pointing this. Can you download the version from github and test it again please? I just did a fix that might have solved this. Ok I'll take a look and keep you posted. @MorisatoK OK Seems to be fixed now. Download the latest package from GitHub and let me know. Perfect. Closing this issue. This change will be posted in the oncoming release (3.0.1). @NemoStein The error only appears on Chrome and it shouldn't prevent you to use the plugin. I'm still figuring out the best way to get rid of that error. I'll keep you posted about this. @NemoStein can you download the latest version via GitHub and test this please? I just added a conditional to avoid these errors. Let me know if it worked for you. Thanks. Let me work to fix something so I can document how to use this properly. I'll keep you posted . @dmitrylebedev Please read the documentation about Usage to learn how to import the package; in your case I'd use the second option. Let me know if that works for you. Thanks. Let me test that particular scenario because I thought that the jQuery plugin needed to expose the $ variable that way in order to work with the plugin (or any other). I'll keep you posted. @dmitrylebedev OK after some research and test the only thing I can say is that I cannot include jQuery inside of the bundle since it changes constantly and it will turn the bundle really big. What I found is that in order to make jQuery to work with import you need to create a jquery-global and then use it in your own script (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35358625/jquery-is-not-defined-when-use-es6-import).\njquery-global.js\njavascript\nimport jquery from 'jquery';\nwindow.jQuery = jquery;\nwindow.$ = jquery;\nThen you can do:\n```javascript\n'use strict';\nimport './jquery-global';\nimport 'mediaelement/all';\n```\nI can add this in the documentation; just let me know if it works for you that way. If no other comments on this I'll close this ticket tomorrow. PR merged. Really nice. So what's the next step to release this website?. @SeventhCycle Thanks for the idea. We are happy to help whoever decides to use this package and we certainly appreciate your words. As per issue goes I'll answer each one of your questions:\n\nThis doesn't seem to be working for me. Do you have any examples where it's forcing the flash player to be loaded?\n\nI had an example previously but I decided to favor the automated tests for Travis CI. The proper way to do it is using renderers: ['flash_video', 'flash_hls', 'flash_dash'] if your purpose is to use only video, and add flash_audio and flash_audio_ogg to support audio as well.\n\nAlso, instead of one SWF file within the mejs directory, there's now five. Should I be selectively choosing the flash player based on what format I'm trying to use? Or just one mediaelement-flash-video.swf?\n\nYou don't have to do anything, as long as you set the pluginPath properly. The scripts detects the media you are using and it will load the proper SWF file\n\nenablePluginSmooth: I don't see this at all within the source anymore. Is this being done by default now?\n\nNo it's not by default but it should. There were many things done during the refactoring that I missed this. I'll add it later\n\nenablePseudoStreaming: I still see this within the source, however, is this limited to flash players now, only?\n\nYes only Flash players will have this.\n\nfeatures: Is it still possible to use third party plugins in this case?\n\nYes, as far as I know it should work by only adding any plugins with a <script> tag after the mediaelement JS code\n\naddEventListener: Looks unchanged.\n\nYes that didn't change.\nLet me know if you have more questions. Just FYI I just pushed the code and shims with smooth enabled by default.. > Is there still Silverlight support for loading WMV files?\nNot anymore. We dropped support for WMV and WMA files since most of open source players don't support them anymore\n\nAlso, if I don't specify renders at all, will it try doing flash as a fallback? Or will it only do a HTML5 player.\n\nIt will do Flash as fallback\n\nenablePluginSmoothing\n\nAlways gonna be on\n\nenablePseudoStreaming\n\nIt has always been for Flash; however, in HTML5, if you indicate a URL with #t (http://vodflash.tv5monde.com/focus/legendes/4fils.mp4#t=240) it will start from that second, and that allows to seek ahead and start from there\nAny other questions let me know. If not, please close this ticket. Thanks. Yes it is. Under media.hlsPlayer. Check the Usage document and it will give you what you need. Yeah that doesn't create any conflicts at all just make sure you call it before mediaelement and you will be fine. Also refer to the Usage documentation to get more info about how to set up the HLS renderer (which is the one I put as an example). Please check the test/player.html file and see how it is destroyed. Thanks for pointing that I'll add that in the docs . You can do something like this:\njavascript\n$('video').mediaelementplayer({\n     // Configuratiom here\n     success: function(media) {\n           media.hlsPlayer.on(Hls.Events.MANIFEST_PARSED, function() {\n                      media.play();\n           });\n     }\n})\nor trying to set the attribute autoplay in the video tag. The purpose of \"destroying\" the player is simply destroy the MediaElement player and the player.remove does it. If you need to destroy the whole video tag, then you'll have to do it the way you are saying, although I don't understand why you'll need to remove the source tags first. @SeventhCycle Just FYI I added a missing method on the remove() method and added the documentation about it; if you can download the latest version, review it and test it I'd appreciate it. I ran my test in the test/player.html file and everything looked good. Just need another pair of eyes. You must put the code of the media.hlsPlayer as I indicated in the documentation (inside a setInterval); that way you will be able to use it without that issue . @SeventhCycle Just put that code inside a setInterval, as described on Usage of Renderers. Just a note, Android, MS Edge and Safari support HLS natively, so if you plan to use hls.js events, they won't work. Did you tried using autoplay in the video tag? That also should work. I'll check the integration of the setInterval element in the core since that will reduce code on the end users. I'll keep you posted about this. Thanks. Also, the code doesn't need double play() methods:\njavascript\npassobj.success = function(media, node, player) {\n    var interval = setInterval(function () {\n        if (media.rendererName === 'native_hls' && media.hlsPlayer !== undefined) {\n            media.hlsPlayer.on(Hls.Events.MANIFEST_PARSED, function() {\n                media.play();\n            });         \n            clearInterval(interval);\n        }\n    }, 500); \n};\nThat should work as well. Let me know so I can be more explicit in the documentation or if I need to add anything else. @SeventhCycle Just FYI I tested the autoplay attribute and removed the media.play() code in success callback in your example and worked perfectly like that.. Lol I know. Well as a last thing I'll make sure to check the autoplay on the native renderer and that would be it. Thanks for testing this and I'm glad you are good with this player and its improvements . FYI, I used the following code and autoplay worked with MP4 and HLS just fine:\n```html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p>\n<pre><code>files = [];\nfiles[0] = {};\nfiles[1] = {file: \"http://www.streambox.fr/playlists/test_001/stream.m3u8\", type: \"hls\", mime:\"application/x-mpegURL\", renderer: []};\nfiles[2] = {file: \"../media/video.mp4\", type: \"mp4\", mime:\"video/mp4\", renderer: []};\n\nplayer_var = false;\n\n$( document ).ready(function() {\n    $(\"#filebox\").val(\"\");\n});\n\nfunction chfl(v)\n{\n    if (v.selectedIndex == 0) return;\n\n    if (typeof player_var == \"object\")\n    {\n        player_var.remove();\n    }\n\n    fl = files[v.selectedIndex];\n\n    passobj = {};\n\n    if (v.selectedIndex == 1)\n    {\n        passobj.renderers = [\"native_hls\"]\n\n        txt = '&lt;video style=\"max-width:100%; max-height:100%;\" id=\"mediabox\" autoplay&gt;'\n            + \"\\n\" + '&lt;source type=\"application/x-mpegurl\" src=\"http://www.streambox.fr/playlists/test_001/stream.m3u8\" /&gt;'\n            + \"\\n\" + '&lt;source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"../media/video.mp4\" /&gt;'\n            + \"\\n&lt;/video&gt;\";\n    }\n\n    if (v.selectedIndex == 2)\n    {\n        passobj.renderers = [\"native_hls\"]\n\n        txt = '&lt;video style=\"max-width:100%; max-height:100%;\" id=\"mediabox\" autoplay&gt;'\n            + \"\\n\" + '&lt;source type=\"application/x-mpegurl\" src=\"http://www.streambox.fr/playlists/test_001/stream.m3u8\" /&gt;'\n            + \"\\n&lt;/video&gt;\";\n    }\n\n    if (v.selectedIndex == 3)\n    {\n        passobj.renderers = []\n\n        txt = '&lt;video style=\"max-width:100%; max-height:100%;\" id=\"mediabox\" autoplay&gt;'\n            + \"\\n\" + '&lt;source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"../media/video.mp4\" /&gt;'\n            + \"\\n&lt;/video&gt;\";\n    }\n\n    passobj.pluginPath = \"../build/\";\n\n    console.log(txt)\n\n    $(\"#mediabox_parent\").html(txt);\n\n    passobj.success = function(media, node, player) {\n        player_var = player;\n    };\n\n    passobj.features = ['playpause','progress','current','duration','tracks','volume','fullscreen'];\n\n    console.log(passobj)\n\n    $('#mediabox').mediaelementplayer(passobj);\n\n    $(\"#player_code\").text(txt);\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>\n\n    File:\n    \nSelect\nHLS & MP4 Fallback\nHLS\nMP4\n\n\n\nPlayer code\n\n\n\n```. Ok I'll take a look and keep you posted. Thanks for testing this. @SeventhCycle Sorry for taking too long. Download the latest version from GitHub and let me know if the issue with FF you described above is solved. Let me know. Thanks for reporting this. You need to download the latest version from this website; if you use NPM you won't get the fix . I used the same browser as you did and I did what you stated and everything was fine. The NPM fix for this will be available when I push the next version so meanwhile test it downloading directly and you should be fine . Not available yet as a release . The screenshot doesn't reflect the current website but I'll take a look and see that is not an issue in the new website. @SeventhCycle This is the new website under http://mediaelementjs.com/ and I couldn't reproduce it\n\n. @SeventhCycle It was changed today early in the morning. Like you said, maybe the DNS is still propagating. So yeah wait until tomorrow and test again please. Ok I'll check it in a minute. Thanks. @SeventhCycle This is a native behavior based on context menu. Even with 2.x this happened. I went to https://web.archive.org/web/20170108090313/http://mediaelementjs.com/ and I performed the test and here are the results:\n\nI've researching about this and they say the only thing you can do in your site is to disable the right click on your element (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22992645/disable-right-clicking-in-html5-video). I don't feel confident on integrating something like that on the player. It must be a personal preference. Even other players have the same behavior, so they have tended to mess with this.. I'll try to see if it's possible, but it will be in a future iteration. Thanks for reporting this either way :). @isantolin Thanks for the PR. Have you created this from a new repo or used git rebase? I'm asking because a month ago I performed a shrink for the repo and we want to avoid to bring them back. The thing is that I haven't found a good FLV and that's why I haven't added it yet. If you have one let me know. Have you tried to use any of those videos with the URLs directly with flv.js? If one of them works can you point it out so I can reference the URL in the website and demo file please?. @isantolin Now FLV available on the website. This issue was moved to johndyer/mediaelement-plugins#1. If you are talking about using an HLS file with different resolution to adapt bandwidth yes. The current example in the main website is one of them. Read more about this in https://github.com/dailymotion/hls.js/blob/master/API.md. Thanks. I'll check this and let you know. @nupamore I tested this the way you mentioned and I tried all the devices in the toggle. I saw the control bar on all of them\n\n\n. @nupamore If you set hideVideoControlsOnLoad: true as true, the control bar won't show up at the beginning, because that option is what it does. Just remove it and you will see the controls. I searched for references in demo or test files using that option and I didn't find one.. No it's not you must set it to false. The hideVideoControlsOnLoad  is only deactivated if a mouse movement occurs. If you use a real device you won't have this issue, but in the emulator might be different and not respond to the mouse events (or touch events) properly. When it's only show, yes it will automatically hide. I'll check for the only hide. Thanks. Can you list what other features and a code snippet so I can verify it please?. You will need to bundle it. Read the guidelines in the grunt section that will tell you how to include it properly. I'll be preparing a new repo for plugins when you won't need to do this anymore but for now that's the way you may have to. @ricking06 Please take a look at https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement-plugins.git; you can download the repo and install any of the plugins just referencing in the <script> tag and adding the keyword in the features array. Hope this works for you. Thanks.. Thanks I'll check it and keep you posted. Can you post a code snippet so I can reproduce this issue with YouTube please?. @nupamore This issue has been fixed; please download the latest version of the package and let me know if it worked for you. Thanks.. Ok let me check that and I'll let you know. @nupamore Please test again I just made the fix for this. Download the latest version and let me know if it works for you. Thanks. Thanks for pointing this. If you have a URL I can check I'd appreciate it. This seems to be a matter of the classPrefix and style sheet since now the player uses BEM naming convention but we provided a \"legacy\" style sheet for it. Perfect let me take a look and let you know my findings. Thanks. @OFarukCaki You are getting an error initially because you need to wrap the call of mediaelementplayer from demo.js inside a $(document).ready() call to ensure that once everything was loaded you will access the MEJS plugin. Start with that and let me know\n\n. Basically you have to modify the demo.js file by adding this before the mediaelementplayer call:\njavascript\n$(document).ready(function() {\n     $('video, audio').mediaelementplayer({\n          // All the config you had before\n     });\n});\nSeems that you copied all the example, and I don't know if that's 100% correct inside Wordpress. Keep me posted about this one. Can you list the steps so I can install Wordpress and the plugin on my local machine and that way try to debug this, please?. Ok let me take a look and keep you posted. Thanks. I'll encourage you to submit a ticket for Wordpress so they do the necessary adjustments. I've seen that there are some things they need to modify in their end to make the latest version to work. You are welcome. I'll close this ticket but let me know if you receive any feedback from them. @Bluxart Do you know what's the difference between jQuery standalone and the one provided by Wordpress? I'm not very familiarized with the use of Wordpress. @OFarukCaki and @Bluxart please download the latest version of the package. Seems that it was missing some variables inside the package bc another user reported the same with Drupal. So I tested this with Drupal and now it works.. I see the same error that was stated above. I may need to install Wordpress again and test it on my side. I'll keep you posted but definitely it should work now. Drupal users are now fine. And they had the same issue that you are seeing. OK. I tested it on my local environment and it worked. Things I modified on Wordpress (not framework) to test this:\n\nCopied all the build files inside wp-includes/js/mediaelement folder\nOn wp-includes/js/mediaelement/wp-mediaelement.js I commented the lines related to silverlight and changed the line if ('flash' === mejs.pluginType) to if ( mejs.rendererName.match(/flash/gi) !== null )\nMinified wp-includes/js/mediaelement/wp-mediaelement.js and replaced wp-includes/js/mediaelement/wp-mediaelement.min.js with it\nModified wp-includes/script-loader.php to update the reference to MediaElementJS changing line $scripts->add( 'mediaelement', \"/wp-includes/js/mediaelement/mediaelement-and-player.min.js\", array('jquery'), '3.0.1', 1 );\n\nThese are the result I got:\n\n\n. You are welcome . The idea is to add a button to display them; something like this:\n\nThis will be part of the track package.. @hitechwebsites Now chapters are displayed as a new button (like Captions do currently). Closing this issue now.. Thanks for pointing this. Let me take a look and keep you posted. @DeysonOrtiz Please download the latest version. I found out that some code wasn't supposed to be there and that was causing some events to be triggered multiple times. I tested your video and it's fine now, as well as the original one on the demo. Please test and let me know. Thanks. Yeah I realized that there was a double call on an event that caused this. Let me know if it worked for you, and if you haven't starred our project yet, I invite you to do so we can have more visibility and improve the ranking of the product. Also invite your peers to star it ;). Any updates on this?. Great no worries man :). Thanks. If you add to your video tag the poster attribute and you should be fine.\nhtml\n<video preload=\"none\" poster=\"/path/to/poster.jpg\">\n      <source src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/196277634\" type=\"video/x-vimeo\">\n</video>\nThere is a trick to hide Vimeo controls but I haven't really tested it and I don't like it personally: http://www.cssplay.co.uk/menu/cssplay-vimeo-hide-control-bar.html. It's safer always to do it from Vimeo manually\nClosing this issue now. Thanks.. Not currently. You can add a Feature request in https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement-plugins and we will assess his feasibility. . Add an issue in the repo that I posted above.  If you can propose a different solution I can check it. @stevemayhew Just FYI, I went ahead and tested this in FF 50.1.0 and I got false. This is on Mac OSX 10.12.2\n\n. @stevemayhew Just FYI, I went ahead and tested this in FF 50.1.0 and I got false. This is on Mac OSX 10.12.2\n\n. This is also a test from Browserstack using Mac OSX El Capitan with FF 50.0 (the only one available at that moment before upgrading to 51.0)\n\n. Closing this issue. If needs to be reopen, please let us know. Thanks.. Great. I appreciate it. Thanks for the PR. Merged now. Thanks for the PR. Merged now. Thanks for this PR. Merged. Thanks for pointing this. No there's no place where window.jQuery is being called. Have you tried with jQuery 1.9.1. I had a previous ticket when they found out that the version of jQuery had a lot to do to fix this.. Thanks. I'll check this ASAP and let you know.. Can you point me to what do I need to do to install MEJS in Drupal 7, please?. Nevermind, I got it installed now. Looking at it today. @kovacskri Can you please download the latest version and check this again? I found a fix for it, but it needs jQuery 1.7+, since some elements like on, off are not available in prior versions. Let me know if it works for you. Thanks. Just FYI I tested it on my local Drupal and worked\n\n. You are welcome. I'll take a look and let you know. Thanks. @DeysonOrtiz Please download the latest version. It includes a mechanism to append those query arguments to hide controls. Let me know if it works for you. Thanks. You mean not autoplaying it? Because we have support for that already by using the autoplay=0 in the query arguments. As far as I'm concerned you should be able to pause it using the Play/pause button from the control bar; also clicking on the video itself should pause it. Are you not experiencing the same behaviors I'm describing?. The thing is the player by default should be hiding after a second or 2 if nothing is specified. I'll take a look on this. Thanks for reporting this. @DeysonOrtiz The clicking in the video doesn't work yet. I need to figure out a smart way to detect when you click inside the iframe. But the controls are hiding/showing properly now. Please download the latest version and check it again please. Thanks. I'll try to accomplish the clicking behavior tonight. You are welcome can I close this ticket?. Thanks for this PR. Merged now.. Can you download the latest version and test this again please? I just added a fix related to that same issue. Thank you for checking this. OK I'll update the documentation. The way you should do it now it's by using mejs.i18n.language('ru') and make sure you have loaded the Russian translation file before setting this up. Can you point me where in the documentation you saw this issue? Just to make sure I track all possible references. Thank you. Check that again and you should see the update now.. You are welcome :). Let me take a look at this and I'll keep you posted. Thanks. You don't need to do anything in the code; the easiest approach is to set the preload attribute to metadata and with that you will be able to know the duration of the media before playing it. For more information, please visit https://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2013/04/12/html5-video-preload/. @Muthukrish92 I see some things that are not right with your code. Posting the proper code:\n```html\n\n\n \n         $(document).ready(function() {\n              $('video').mediaelementplayer({ \n                    // I'll use if possible the same location for Flash, but if you have the Flash files somewhere else, change this\n                    pluginPath: 'http://dev.local:81/Resources/Asset/'\n              }); </p>\n<pre><code>          // You missed this: \n          var playerId = $('video').closest('.mejs__container').attr('id');\n          var player = mejs.players[playerId];\n\n          function play() { \n              player.play(); \n          } \n          function pause() { \n              player.pause(); \n          } \n     });\n</code></pre>\n<p>\n``\n1. jQuery must be set before MediaElement.js\n2. pluginPath like it says is just the path not the reference to the Flash file (also I encourage not to use spaces within the string)\n3. In the documentation, it states: as example using HLS, meaning that you don't need all that is there, since you were trying to use a YouTube video, not an HLS source. \n4. You are trying to use MediaElementJS later without actually referencing it. I seeplayer.playbut I don't see where it is assigned. So I changed that according to what the documentation says.\nAlso the link you posted is from 2011. It's out-to-date completely.. The use of theplayerId` code is to a cross-browser solution; if it worked without it, that's fine but I don't know if other browsers that are more strict will be ok with it.\nYou got the file:// because you tested your page directly and not from a page in a virtual host in your machine (which is what you need to test a broader variety of media types in the end). If you put your file inside a folder and you have a LAMP environment, and if you use http://localhost/mytestfile.html, then you don't need to modify the code.\nNow, you don't need to include any file at all except for the build/mediaelement-and-player.min.js. It has everything you need at that point. The src folder is for development ONLY.. You can try setting hideVideoControlsOnLoad to true. That way it won't show up at the beginning, but once you mouse over the video the controls will be display.. You are welcome. No, in the configuration with MEJS:\njavascript\n$('video').mediaelementplayer({\n     hideVideoControlsOnLoad: \"true\",\n    // other config elements\n}). It's not a file. Just when you reference mediaelementplayer that's where you should put the flag in brackets. Take a look at the demo.js file and check how's done there . Exactly the code it's just to show other things on that demo file what you need to be concerned is what is related to the instantiation of mediaelementplayer. That's all :) I'm glad you figured out. All code before the line $('video, audio').mediaelementplayer can be removed. From the config in the demo.js, just leave the pluginPath element if you are gonna support DASH, HLS, MP4 or MP3. That would be it. You still have some pieces left. This is the correct code you will need:\njavascript\n$('video, audio').mediaelementplayer({\n      hideVideoControlsOnLoad: \"true\",\n      hideVideoControlOnPause: \"true\",\n      features: ['playpause', 'skipback', 'progress', 'volume', 'fullscreen'],\n      enableProgressTooltip: \"false\",\n      videoVolume: \"horizontal\",\n      pluginPath: '../build/',\n});. You are welcome :). Yeah Facebook is still limited on what they can offer us. I'll take a look and keep you posted. Thanks.. I saw that if you don't set max-width property or width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\", and you set fixed width and height in the video tag, the video gets set properly. Let me know if that works for you\nhtml\n<video id=\"player1\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" preload=\"none\">\n        <source src=\"https://www.facebook.com/BestofVines/videos/2539522849404092/\" type=\"video/x-facebook\">\n</video>\n\n. No problem. Closing this issue. The mediaelement-plugins repo contains at least 2 enhancements to the control bar: skip back and jump forward. Take a look at them to know how can you add new buttons. Once you create your plugin, just reference it in the features list in the player configuration and in the order you want them:\njavascript\n$('video').mediaelementplayer({\n      features: ['playpause', 'progress', 'duration', 'volume', 'fullscreen', '[yourbuttonkey]', etc.]\n}). Yes it is :). probably so; in the documentation on that repo I provided sort of a template that is needed to make sure it will work with MEJS, but if you are not a Javascript developer I'd recommend it. PR merged. Thanks. No worries it happens :). I'll check this; we might need new config element to achieve it, but I'll keep you posted. @DeysonOrtiz OK the element hideVideoControlsOnPause is now available in the player. Download the latest version and please test it. Thank you for pointing this. I'll take a look and let you know when it's fixed . Well I checked that and that's the expected behavior. The controls on any other player must be displayed when the video ends to trigger another action. I thought that the controls were not visible with that option. Yes you just need to change the startTime elements. Check the API document to get the names of the 3 elements related to that. I'll check this; we might need new config element to achieve it, but I'll keep you posted. I'd recommend for this one to use strictly CSS since this is one of the core behaviors of the player and it's a secondary validation that the video is indeed paused.. Not yet but it can be integrated soon. @DeysonOrtiz The configuration element showPosterWhenPaused is now available; please download the latest version and let me know if it works. Thanks. Just a recommendation: don't put quotes when you use boolean values (true/false), because Javascript will consider them as true. Try removing them and see if that works for you. You too :). Can you post the URL so I can check it please? As far as I've seen it's just a warning but it shouldn't prevent you to play the video. The video/x-youtube is a custom format and FF doesn't like custom MIME types. Let me take a look on this. This is a good enhancement since it's related to accessibility. I'll keep you posted. I checked your code, but I couldn't find what was wrong. I'd like to integrate it as a part of the core functionality, but if you can provide me a URL where I can see your issue and provide a solution I'd appreciate it. I tried using Chrome on OSX and I couldn't replicate it. Which OS and browser are you using? I know it is difficult but can you provide me a screen recording of what you are experiencing so I can see what's going on, please?. Thanks I'll check it later. Thanks for providing me the screen recording; I tried to replicate your bug on Chrome and FF on Mac OSX (since I don't have a Windows machine) and I wasn't able to do it. This might be more a behavior on Windows.  One thing I did do was to put the forcedHandlePause variable before the mouse events like this:\n```javascript\n                var forcedHandlePause = false;\n    // handle clicks\n    t.rail.on('mousedown touchstart', (e) => {\n                      forcedHandlePause = false;\n                  if (media.duration !== Infinity) {\n\nI don't know if that helps or not but let me know so I can integrate this in the core. Thanks. Yes please anything that is performance or accesibility related is always good to integrate. Create the PR and I'll take a look. Thanks. @MosheL Please download the latest version; I added a different mechanism to check if the variables are read-only. Let me know if it works for you. Thanks. Thanks for pointing this. Currently working on a better solution that doesn't require the detection of touch considered not accurate. @MosheL Related to #2017 . I'll check this definitely. Thanks. I merged the `has_tocuh_removal` branch on master so you don't have to rely on HAS_TOUCH; I verified all the code that used it and it is safe the approach I took. Closing this issue. @Er-c Let me check it and I'll keep you posted. Can you provide me an example on how this is being used currently? I think using just the audio tag should be enough but I may be wrong. Ok I'll take a look and keep you posted about this. @Er-c Please download the latest version of the plugin and test the following code (changing the paths to CSS and JS respectively):html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n\n\n\n\nMediaElement.js 3.0 - audio/video unification library\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$('audio').mediaelementplayer();\n\n\nLet me know if it works for you.. @Er-c You need to use the local files, since the CDN doesn't reflect any changes yet since I haven't pushed a new release yet. But as @ricking06 said, it works now. Check his Fiddle. By the end of this week I'll push a new version if I complete some tweaks that need to be in place. Thanks. Thanks for the PR; however, you shouldn't work on the `build` files, but in the `src` files; please do the modifications ONLY on that folder so it can be reviewed. Thanks. Thanks for the extra notes. Let me know when you have the changes on the `src` folder and reverted any changes in the `build` folder so I can check and merge your changes, please. Perfect. I'll check them in a minute; just for curiosity, which OS and browsers did you test? We are trying to get the experience the same as possible for mobile/desktop/tablet. Perfect. I'll check it today. OK I have reviewed it and I think it's good to go; the only comment I can make is (after recoding some pieces to fit into ES6) is: would you mind if I set media.setCurrentTime(t.newTime) in the handleMouseMove method?javascript\nif (mouseIsDown && t.newTime.toFixed(4) !== media.currentTime.toFixed(4)) {\n    media.setCurrentTime(t.newTime);\n    t.setCurrentRailHandle(t.newTime);\n    t.updateCurrent(t.newTime); \n} \n```\nReason being is because the behavior sliding of the progress handle the way it was is the standard across many other players. Other than that I'm OK with the changes. Let me know ASAP to merge this. You don't need to do the change I can do it, I just need your permission to add this.. I can fix all the issues I found for you if it's your desire. Just let me know. Thanks for this PR. Merged now with fixes and I decided not to include the option, since I saw that Vimeo and YouTube actually handle that behavior in the way you described it. I based this mostly on other open source players like VideoJS.. Ca you point where are you seeing the audio tag? I checked your site and I couldn't see it. Oh ok, I see what you mean. I'd suggest to use this:\ncss\n.voice_player {\n      visibility: hidden;\n}\nand in your success method add:\njavascript\n$('.voice_player').css('visibility', 'visible');\nLet me know if that works. No idea, and maybe it was faster, but that way you are really gonna display the player once everything is ready. If you try to apply some plugin to a hidden element (display: none), it can sometimes not catching the plugin properly. As far as I saw your solution should work, but the code is dense and I couldn't see anything. Can this ticket be closed?. Thanks for this PR. I'll merge it in a minute, and my apologies for that typo. Thanks. PR merged.  Can you provide me a URL that I can use to check this issue please?. You are welcome. Happy to asssit you with this. Or at least post all the code you are using and I'll try to install a local Meteor site to check it. OK let me check it and I'll keep you posted. OK First thing I see is a bunch of errors in JS in the URL you provided me; check those first since that is the first thing I noticed, and we'll go from there\n\n. I'd strongly suggest you to reduce the code you are trying to use; in your test.html just load the audio tag you need; and in the test.js just use:\n```javascript\nimport { Meteor } from 'meteor/meteor';\nimport { Template } from 'meteor/templating';\nimport { FlowRouter } from 'meteor/kadira:flow-router';\nimport 'mediaelement/player';\n$('video, audio').mediaelementplayer({\n    pluginPath: '/mejs/'\n});\n```\nI'm gonna install Meteor and do a sample and I'll post the code here and report my results.. I'll describe my steps so you can see what I did so far; I tested on Chrome, FF and Safari and worked for me:\n\nCreated a new project: meteor create player && cd player\nInstalled all dependencies: meteor npm install\nInstalled MediaElement.js: meteor npm install mediaelement\nRun the project: meteor\nModified the client files with this:\nmain.html\n```html\n\nplayer\n\n\n\nMediaElement\n{{> player}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**main.js**javascript\nimport { Template } from 'meteor/templating';\nimport { ReactiveVar } from 'meteor/reactive-var';\nimport $ from 'jquery';\nimport 'mediaelement/all';\nimport './main.html';\nTemplate.player.onRendered(function helloOnCreated() {\n$('audio').mediaelementplayer({\n    pluginPath: '/packages/johndyer_mediaelement/build/'\n  });\n});\n```\n\nThat's all. Let me know if it worked for you.. Instead of using mediaelement/player use mediaelement/all and try again. I think I know what's the issue when using mediaelement/player and I will release the fix for this between tomorrow or Thursday so just use mediaelement/all for now and you should be fine . Well if it doesn't find a file it indicates an 404 error in console as far as I've seen. Like I said, with what you have it should work, but I can see that there is an issue with mediaelement/player and I will fix it and release it as soon as possible.. No in terms of the CSS no they hadn't been any major changes (other than the BEM naming class convention switch); just removed unnecessary styles and added PostCSS. When the next version comes, can you test again for me using mediaelement/player in your Meteor file, please? Just to confirm it will be solved.. Thanks for pointing this. The fix is already implemented but until I release the next version it won't be reflected on the CDN. I'll take a look and keep you posted. @ale-grosselle I wanted to know if you can assist me with this since I'm not an expert on AS3. It should be something inside the /src/flash/flash-audio/AudioMediaElement.as file Please download the latest version of the plugin so have the latest fixes. This is the code I used:\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n\n\n\n\nMediaElement.js 3.0 - audio/video unification library\n\n\n\n<audio id=\"player\" preload=\"none\" controls>\n    <source src=\"http://www.largesound.com/ashborytour/sound/AshboryBYU.mp3\" type=\"audio/mp3\">\n</audio>\n<div id=\"controls\" class=\"controls\">\n    <a id=\"playpause\" class=\"play\">Play/Pause</a>\n    <a id=\"load\" class=\"load\">Load new source</a>\n</div>\n\n<script src=\"../build/mediaelement.js\"></script>\n<script>\n    var player = new MediaElement(\"player\", {\n\n        renderers: ['flash_audio'],\n        pluginPath: '../build/',\n        success: function (mediaElement) {\n            window.me = mediaElement;\n        }\n    });\n\n    document.getElementById('playpause').onclick=function(e) {\n        if (player.paused) {\n            player.play();\n        } else {\n            player.pause();\n        }\n        e.preventDefault();\n        e.stopPropagation();\n    };\n\ndocument.getElementById('load').onclick=function(e) {\n    if (!player.paused) {\n        player.pause();\n    }\n\n    player.setSrc('http://www.stephaniequinn.com/Music/Commercial%20DEMO%20-%2010.mp3');\n    player.load();\n            player.play();  // It plays the old source\n    e.preventDefault();\n    e.stopPropagation();\n};\n\n</script>\n\n\n\n. @ale-grosselle Nevermind. I figured out with @an1rk4 help thank you. Thanks @ale-grosselle I appreciate it. @an1rk4 Please download the latest version and test it. It should be good now. Closing this issue since fix has been merged. Thanks for this PR; however, all the changes on the JS files in build are not necessary. The only line that is worth including is the one in the `AudioMediaElement.as` and I will include it as a part of a second round of patches I'm preparing. I'll give you credit for the fix but I won't merge this PR, is that ok? or would you prefer to add ONLY the change in the `AudioMediaElement.as` in a new PR?. Have you tried `responsive` in the `stretching` configuration?. well it is true if the `video` tag is something like this:html\n\n\n\n``\nthenauto` takes place. Ok I'll check this and keep you posted . I see 2 errors and none of them are related to the plugin; I'd start from there.\n\n. You are welcome closing this ticket now since it's not related to the plugin. I'll add this soon. Thanks. Although I don't see any issues on the main website, can you send a URL so I can see this issue somewhere else, please?\n\n. The problem I see is that there's a audio_frame DIV that has a fixed height, and the player is taking its height; if you change the height of it to 40px that's what you will need since the .mejs__controls class has 40px as height.. If you need to use the old theme, just use the classPrefix: 'mejs-' config element, and you will see that there's a \"legacy\" stylesheet. Use mediaelementplayer-legacy.css instead of mediaelementplayer.css and you should be fine; now the reason I didn't add the mx-width in the stylesheet is because not everybody wants to make the tags responsive, since there are 3 different stretching modes: none, responsive and fill. If you check the demo file, the video tag is the one that has an style attribute and it contains the max-width=100%, but it's not in the stylesheet. I'll add that in the demo like the video tag, but I can't add it directly on the stylesheet. Makes sense?. Just FYI, I just added the style for the demo file as I described above. Download the latest version of the player from GitHub and you should see it. You are welcome. Can I close this issue?. Thank you. You too!. Can you share a URL so I can see what's the issue, please?. Also make sure you use the latest version (3.1.0). No it doesn't support it anymore. Please make sure no changes are done in the build/ folder; the file you need to modify is src/js/renderers/flash.js in terms of JS, not the bundled files. Change that so I can review this PR again. Thanks.. You need to add the canplay call as an event inside the window['__ready__'] after the rendererready event call like this:\njavascript \nevent = createEvent('canplay', flash);\nmediaElement.dispatchEvent(event);\nPlease fix those issues to review it again. Because it is already added as part of the mejs.events and it's invalid as a method. It should that's why I need you to verify if that modification on JS is needed or not; if it is only add it in the way I described. Otherwise, needs to be removed. Couple of questions before I merge this:\n\nShouldn't _sound.addEventListener(Event.OPEN, openHandler); be inside the constructor to avoid repeating in the fire_load method?\nfire_load contains several pieces of code repeated; if doing what I stated above and the following piece, this is what ends up being:\n```javascript\npublic function AudioMediaElement() {\n   ....\n   _timer.addEventListener(TimerEvent.TIMER, timerHander);\n\n_sound.addEventListener(Event.OPEN, openHandler);\n// rest of the code\n\n}\nprivate function fire_load():void {\n                _isPlaying = false;\n\n        if (_src) {\n\n            if (_isInit) {\n\n                try {\n                _sound.close();\n                }\n                catch (error:IOError) {\n\n                }\n            }\n\n            _isInit = true;\n            _currentTime = 0;\n\n            _request = new URLRequest(_src);\n            _sound = new Sound();\n            _sound.load(_request);\n\n            if (_autoplay) {\n                fire_play();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n```\nIsn't that achieve the same result you are expecting? \nI made a test doing the above, and everything was fine.. JS code looks good to me; you don't need to do any more changes on the pull request, just need to confirm the things I saw in AS3 so I can merge this safely since I'm not an AS3 expert, but I see code that could be removed or simplified. Thanks I'll check it one more time and merge this. Thanks for this PR. Merged now. The errors related to getDuration should be fixed in this latest version; please download it from GitHub, since the release is not ready yet, so you can test. About the use of CDN SWF files, this is the first time I hear somebody tries to use it like that, honestly. I'll check this since it might be related to a securityDomain property. I'll keep you posted, but my recommendation is to put the files locally for now.. I have added security domain access in the files now; however, this change won't be reflected until I push the next release so the CDN can reflect them. Is there a way you can install them in a different domain and test this with your code, please?. Just download the latest version from GitHub. Glad you figured out. Probably you need to check the server setup, as well as the process of how to the audio files are being generated. Often, the duration is not being passed during the audio encoding and might be the real cause of your issue. I'm not an expert on audio, but that's a start point for you.. I'll try to find some sources that can help you; I haven't had any luck yet. I'll keep you posted. Glad you figured out. You can use setCurrentTime, or to start video in a specific time, use the #t element like this: http://vodflash.tv5monde.com/focus/legendes/4fils.mp4#t=240. The latter is native behavior and supported.. @weituotian You can use that method. I'll expand the documentation with more methods. Thanks for pointing that. You are welcome. Yeah I'll check it later. I would like to get a better context of this fix since it involves a new Flash var. So is this something that could be applied not just to audio, but also to video Flash shims?. PR merged. Just added a conditional missing in the audio file that should always be there. Other than that, good job. I appreciate your help with the shims. Do you have a URL I can check?. I think this comes from your stylesheet directly on the style .mejs__button>button; try to change the background with the right path where the mejs-controls.svg file is\n. Yeah keep me posted. Closing this issue since it's not related to the plugin itself. Indeed. That's a good point. I'll check this before I release the next version and see what I can add, or simply for now the text method will be enough. Thanks for pointing this.. @mziwisky In the new version I worked on a method like this, but I'd like to get your feedback about it, so I can integrate it in the next release. Please let me know and hope to hear from you soon, since I'm planning the next release no later than Friday. This needs to be a non-jQuery snippet since it will be part of the utilities so it can be used in other areas of the code\n```javascript\nexport function sanitizeHTML (html) {\nconst div = document.createElement('div');\ndiv.innerHTML = html;\n// Remove all `<script>` tags first\nconst scripts = div.getElementsByTagName('script');\nlet i = scripts.length;\nwhile (i--) {\n    scripts[i].parentNode.removeChild(scripts[i]);\n}\n\n// Loop the elements and remove anything that contains value=\"javascript:\" or an `on*` attribute\n// (`onerror`, `onclick`, etc.)\nconst allElements = div.getElementsByTagName('*');\nfor (let i = 0, n = allElements.length; i < n; i++) {\n    const\n        attributesObj = allElements[i].attributes,\n        attributes = Array.prototype.slice.call(attributesObj)\n    ;\n\n    for (let j = 0, total = attributes.length; j < total; j++) {\n        if (attributes[j].name.startsWith('on') || attributes[j].value.startsWith('javascript')) {\n            allElements[i].parentNode.removeChild(allElements[i]);\n        } else if (attributes[j].name.startsWith('style')) {\n            allElements[i].removeAttribute(attributes[j]);\n        }\n    }\n\n}\nreturn div.innerHTML;\n\n}\n. Nevermind. I will include this only for captions since it doesn't seem that I'll need this anywhere else. Thanks. PR merged. Thanks. I never heard of this one; you can try it, but if so, just make sure you use the `mediaelementplayer-legacy.css` stylesheet, and also in the player configuration you set `classPrefix: 'mejs-'` to make it compatible. @isantolin Thanks. I'll check this. Since I don't have a Chromecast device, what's the expected output for this?. Thanks all for your comments. I'll check the documentation about this and start working on it. I'll try to include AirPlay. This ticket should be logged in `mediaelement-plugins` repo BTW. This issue was moved to mediaelement/mediaelement-plugins#23. Just for curiosity, how popular is Twitch?. Thanks for the info; very useful. I'll keep you posted on any progress. @isantolin Check the master branch and you will see it integrated already. Thanks for your request. Closing this issue now. PR merged. Thanks. The player itself as it stands should remain like it is for size purposes; the plugins repo is strictly to expand the player and that is the main distinction between one and the other. Please download the latest version; your error was fixed in 3.1.1. Also read `Usage` documentation to set up properly MEJS and reference the instance, since you should be doing something like this:javascript\nvar videoPlayer = new MediaElementPlayer(\"video-player\", {\n       success: function (mediaElement, originalNode) {\n             var interval = setInterval(function() { \n                     if (media.rendererName === 'native_hls' && mediaElement.hlsPlayer !== undefined) {\n                              mediaElement.setSrc(videoUrl);\n                              clearInterval(interval);\n                     }\n              }, 500);\n          if (media.rendererName !== 'native_hls') {\n                 mediaElement.setSrc(videoUrl);\n          }\n\n}\n});\n. You are welcome. Do you have a CodePen or URL you can share where I can see your issues and check them please?. I see the issue with the volume; I'll check it I just need you to show me the first one. So I add that and select the YouTube video, play it and click the fullscreen button? Or do I need to do something else?. Perfect I'll check this and keep you posted on both issues.. I know the root of both issues: when moving inside an iframe, there's no way to detect those events since it's a cross-origin issue. So I'm working on adding a layer next to each iframe, so it can overlay the iframe and the events are executed properly. I'll let you know when it's ready. @anomaly-stalker Ready. Download the latest version and you shouldn't get any of the errors you listed above. Let me know. I'll check this since I tested it last time and by just moving the mouse in full screen you could see the controls; maybe I forgot to push something but I'll keep you posted. Yeah I tested them just now and it displays the controls by moving the mouse. Closing this issue now. Thanks for testing this. Perfect! I'm glad this is sorted out.. PR merged. Thanks. Unfortunately I don't have a lot of reference on older versions; the current version I maintain is 3.x if you find the issue in the latest version I'll be happy to take a look at. I checked this in the latest version and I couldn't find any issues with resizing. If you need this issue to be reopen, please let us know. Thanks. PR merged. Thanks. PR merged. Thanks. Can you download the latest version and check if this is an issue? I tested the following code and everything worked fine:html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n\n\n\n\nMediaElement.js 3.0 - audio/video unification library\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         var player = new MediaElementPlayer(document.getElementById('player1'), {pluginPath: '../build'});     <br />\n    \n\n\n``. You are welcome . Just usemejs.players.mep_0.play()` and you should be fine. If i stated that in the documentation can you point it out so I can modify it please?. Also consider that mobile devices have a constrain that states you cannot autoplay a video/audio unless you perform a click first. If you click one and then change the source and invoke play it should autoplay; that's the only thing I can think of right off my head. I'm happy to check a URL with your issue, but other than that there's not much I can say about this one. If you consider it can be closed please do.. Thanks. I'll check them and let you know when they are fixed. This is more an issue of implementation:\nFor point 1, I'd say do not call pause(); it's not gonna prevent anything once you hover into another element of the gallery\nFor point 2, the Play button should be hidden, so I'm checking why this is not happening.. Also, I fixed an issue with mistmatch between MediaElement and MediaElementPlayer, so you won't need to use #player1 when calling MediaElementPlayer; just use player1. This is available when you download the latest version of the package from GitHub. So when you hover the item, the purpose it's just to pause the video; if you click the item you load the new source. Am I right?. And just for curiosity, do you load a video by default in your project? or this CodePen reflects exactly what you are doing?. I see . I'll play with this some more and keep you posted. Thanks for reporting this. @anomaly-stalker Copy/paste the following code and let me know if it solved your issues. What I did is to set the first thumbnail's URL by default so the player can render properly. Then I implemented the hover behavior to emulate what you described me above, and that's when I realized that the problem you were having is a race issue between play and pause; so I fixed that in the code. \n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n\n\n\n\nMediaElement.js 3.0 - audio/video unification library\n\n\n<style>\n\n    #wrapper {\n        width:800px; \n        height:400px;\n    }\n    .flex-container {\n        display: -webkit-flex;\n        display: flex;\n        width: 400px;\n        height: 250px;\n        background-color: lightgrey;\n    }\n\n    .flex-item {\n        background-color: cornflowerblue;\n        width: 100px;\n        height: 100px;\n        margin: 10px;\n    }\n    .flex-item > img {\n        max-width:100%;\n    }\n</style>\n\n\n\nMediaElement.js Youtube Fast PlayPause Issue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<script src=\"//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.min.js\"></script>\n\n<script src=\"//rawgit.com/johndyer/mediaelement/master/build/mediaelement-and-player.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\n    var settings = {\n        controls: true,\n        pluginPath: \"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mediaelement/3.1.2/\",\n        features: [\"playpause\", \"progress\", \"current\", \"duration\", \"tracks\", \"volume\", \"fullscreen\"],\n        alwaysShowControls: false,\n        hideVideoControlsOnLoad: true,\n        error: function (e) {\n            alert(e);\n        }\n    };\n\n    // Set the first element by default\n    $('#player1').attr({\n        src: $('.flex-container img').data('url'),\n    });\n\nvar mejs = new MediaElementPlayer(\"player1\", settings);\n\n$('.flex-container > .flex-item').hover(function() {\n        mejs.pause();\n    }).on('click', function() {\n        mejs.setSrc($(this).children('img:last').data('url'));\n        mejs.play();\n    });\n</script>\n\n\n\n. The only thing I can advise here is to move the `setSrc` method out of the conditional, like this:javascript\nif (!players[playerId]) {\n      players[playerId] = new MediaElementPlayer(playerId, settings);\n}\nplayers[playerId].setSrc(url);\nThat way, if the user hovers accidentally other image, you will load it properly and avoid this issue. Let me know. I just literally fixed something for YouTube events. Please check your CodePen again and let me know.. If not, I'd suggest to use the approach I mentioned above.. Any updates on this?. Closing issue since PR has been merged into master. Thanks for reporting this. Can you post a URL so I can see the issue please?. Try CodePen. Or post your code here. Thanks. I'll check this and keep you posted. @an1rk4 Can you help me with this? Seems like the meta data is not being passed but I can't figure out why. This is the markup I sued for testing.

This issue is for RTMP, not HLS. . @smasam Do you have a valid RTMP? I'm trying to access it but it's denying me access. @smasam I pushed a fix that solved some issues in Flash video; please download it from GitHub and let me know. @ale-grosselle just FYI. Any updates on this?. Can you send me a RTMP so I can test this please?. Closing this issue since no response has been posted in the last 14 days. You can always request this to be reopened. Thanks. @SMen1 Thanks for pointing this. The multiple events is expected since that's how YouTube works: first triggers a `pause`, then triggers a `play` and finally a `playing` event when jumping to a new position. I fixed the absence of `pause` event. Please download the latest version from GitHub and let me know. Ok I'll check your scenario and keep you posted. Yes it should fire once per active video; let me see what needs to be added/fixed once I make my test case. @SMen1 Thanks for the patience. Please download the latest version from GitHub and let me know if you are seeing the multiple events. I found out that a play was being triggered when it shouldn't. I made a good deal of testing and seems to be working for me. But just confirm. Perfect. Thanks and keep me posted. @SMen1 I'm posting my HTML so you see how I tested it and the result I obtained using the latest version:html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n\n\n\n\nMediaElement.js 3.0 - audio/video unification library\n\n\n\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/normalize/5.0.0/normalize.min.css\">\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"../build/mediaelementplayer.min.css\">\n\n\n\n<div id=\"container\">\n\n    <div class=\"players\" id=\"player1-container\">\n\n        <h3>Video Player</h3>\n\n        <div class=\"media-wrapper\">\n            <video id=\"player1\" width=\"340\" height=\"260\" preload=\"none\">\n                <source src=\"http://clips.vorwaerts-gmbh.de/big_buck_bunny.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n            </video>\n        </div>\n        <br>\n        <div class=\"media-wrapper\">\n            <video id=\"player2\" width=\"340\" height=\"260\" preload=\"none\">\n                <source src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YE7VzlLtp-4\" type=\"video/x-youtube\">\n            </video>\n        </div>\n\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"output\"></div>\n</div>\n\n<script src=\"../build/jquery.js\"></script>\n\n<script src=\"../build/mediaelement-and-player.js\"></script>\n<script>\n    $('#player1').mediaelementplayer({\n        success: function(mediaElement, originalNode) {\n\n            mediaElement.addEventListener('play', function() {\n                $('#output').append( $('<span>Player 1: play</span><br>') );\n            }, false);\n\n            mediaElement.addEventListener('pause', function() {\n                $('#output').append( $('<span>Player 1: paused</span><br>') );\n            }, false);\n            mediaElement.addEventListener('playing', function() {\n                $('#output').append( $('<span>Player 1: playing</span><br>') );\n            }, false);\n\n        }\n    });\n\n$('#player2').mediaelementplayer({\n    success: function(mediaElement, originalNode) {\n\n        mediaElement.addEventListener('play', function() {\n            $('#output').append( $('<span>Player 2: play</span><br>') );\n        }, false);\n\n        mediaElement.addEventListener('pause', function() {\n            $('#output').append( $('<span>Player 2: paused</span><br>') );\n        }, false);\n        mediaElement.addEventListener('playing', function() {\n            $('#output').append( $('<span>Player 2: playing</span><br>') );\n        }, false);\n\n    }\n});\n</script>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"366\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-02-15 at 4 38 51 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/910829/22996638/76c519a4-f39d-11e6-9114-88f9ee12abde.png\">\n. Any updates on this?. Send me a link so I can look at it please. OK I'll check this and let you know. @SMen1 After a lot of testing I ended up confirming that this is an issue with Firefox, and even YouTube itself has the issue. To prove it, just copy the following markup and perform the same action of sliding the rail and you will see the same behavior (in this case,  `playing/buffering/playing` are the equivalents of  `play/playing/play/playing`):\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n\n\n\n\nMediaElement.js 3.0 - audio/video unification library\n\n\n\n\n\n    var tag = document.createElement('script');\n    tag.id = 'iframe-demo';\n    tag.src = 'https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api';\n    var firstScriptTag = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n    firstScriptTag.parentNode.insertBefore(tag, firstScriptTag);\n\n    var player;\n    function onYouTubeIframeAPIReady() {\n        player = new YT.Player('existing-iframe-example', {\n            events: {\n                'onReady': onPlayerReady,\n                'onStateChange': onPlayerStateChange\n            }\n        });\n    }\n    function onPlayerReady(event) {\n        document.getElementById('existing-iframe-example').style.borderColor = '#FF6D00';\n    }\n    function changeBorderColor(playerStatus) {\n        var color;\n        if (playerStatus == -1) {\n            console.log('loading');\n        } else if (playerStatus == 0) {\n            console.log('ended');\n        } else if (playerStatus == 1) {\n            console.log('playing');\n        } else if (playerStatus == 2) {\n            console.log('paused');\n        } else if (playerStatus == 3) {\n            console.log('buffering');\n        } else if (playerStatus == 5) {\n            console.log('cued');\n        }\n    }\n    function onPlayerStateChange(event) {\n        changeBorderColor(event.data);\n    }\n\n\n\nSo on my side there's nothing more I can do about this. Thanks for reporting this though. Yes please send the feature request and I'll take a look at it. Yes I'm the one labeling them so don't worry. See #2079 . PR merged. Thanks. Thanks for this PR. Let me review them and I'll merge them immediately. No worries about not building with changes; actually our PRs don't need to be built. I build them once they passed review just FYI. PR merged. Thanks.. How can I test wechat? Never heard of it before. Is it work testing it on an emulator?. The other thing is currently we are on 3.1.2 version and other bugs were fixed there as well do you mind testing that version as well?. @yang06061079 Just FYI, I tested the main website (http://www.mediaelementjs.com) in the WeChat app on iPhone and it worked. Attaching a screenshot\n![img_3476](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/910829/23069214/94995e7e-f4f4-11e6-91b2-5587b016edee.PNG)\n. Any updates on this?. If you provide me a URL with the demo where I can see the issue I can help you. But this seems more a problem of the demo file and not the plugin itself.. Is the web developing tool available for Mac? I can't read Chinese unfortunately. Nevermind I got it installed on my Mac. Checking this right now. One thing to note is that even when I try to play regular MP4 or YouTube, nothing happens in the emulator, but I can play them in the phone itself. I don't what might be causing this. I'll keep checking but you say that the issue is only on iPhone 6 correct?. Yes I'm tempted to say is a compatibility problem in WeChat because I don't see anything different if I play the demo on iPhone's Safari. I'll close this since it's only affecting this app and not in browser. We'll keep researching and I encourage you to check the compatibility issue on your side as well. Thanks for pointing this. I'm trying to get some assistance to fix issues with AS3 since I'm not an expert but I'll take a look at 2.x version and see what's missing on 3.x. Thanks. BTW can you post a valid RTMP link? It seems that I can't access them. Also, download the latest version from GitHub. I pushed a commit with some fixes for Flash video as well. Any updates on this?. Thanks I'll wait for it. Thanks I'll wait for it. @an1rk4 Can you check the VideoMediaElement.as and assist me with this, please?. Closing this issue since no response has been posted in the last 14 days. You can always request this to be reopened. Thanks. @SMen1 By default, the plugin already puts the instance(s) of the player(s) in an array inside `mejs.players` is that what you are talking about? If so the best way to achieve what you are doing here is like this:javascript\n$('video').mediaelementplayer();\n$.each(mejs.players, function(i, o) {\n        var events = ['play','playing','pause','ended'];\n    for (var i = 0, il = events.length; i<il; i++) {\n        o.media.addEventListener(events[i], function (e) {\n            $('#output').append($('<span>' + e.type + '</span>'));\n        });\n    }\n\n});\nPlease let me know if that works for you. Any updates on this?. Sounds good. Thanks and keep me posted about this please.. Yeah just let me know when you have it ready. I'm sure that I tested the markup I pasted above and it worked properly, but I see that you have a lot of JS/CSS in this project, so it's hard for me to see what are you missing here. OK I'll take whatever you have and post the HTML based on your example here so you give it a try. Remember to always download the latest version from GitHub since it had had some fixes lately. I'll keep you posted. My apologies. I forgot to push a fix for the progress bar. Just download the latest version from here and test it again with the same markup. This time I confirmed completely that it gives the proper events. Just keep in mind that in v2, there were missing events and the behavior of the progress bar was different. In v3, we changed it so it will have a better performance by pausing media and then playing it again. Let me know if this new version works for you and thanks for your patience.. No worries. Keep me posted and hope this solves all your issues.. You are welcome and glad I could assist you on this. Closing issue now. This method sets the width and height under certain conditions: if a `max-width: 100%` or if `stretching` is `responsive` is detected for the video tag it will turn it into responsive; otherwise, if the `stretching` is set to `fill` it will run some specific calculation and crop and adjust the video to the parent container. Finally if any of those conditions is not met it will only set the width and height specified above. Use `renderers` configuration for this; it accepts an array of key names for renderers. Read the Use of Renderers section on Usage documentation. If you have any other questions, please let me know. In your case you might need to do something like this:javascript\n$('video').mediaelementplayer({\n     renderers: ['html5'],\n     // other configuration elements\n});\n. Thanks for pointing this I'll take a look and improve this.. Can you provide a URL to test a fix that might be the one you need for this, please?. That's correct. Please consider star this project to continue supporting it and improving it. Thanks. Thanks for pointing this. I'll get it fixed soon. To be honest I don't know. Take a look at this; might help you\nhttps://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload. Thanks for this PR. The only thing I can comment is that the test file shouldn't be written on ES6 given that not all browsers support that and it needs to test IE9+, so only replace the ES6 code with regular JavaScript and I'll be able to merge this. Thanks again. Thanks. Once I'm front of my computer I'll merge this. Great work!. PR merged. Thanks for the work on this. You might be able to do it without an option. You can try to do it with the loadedmetadata event and CSS. Basically it's a matter of doing something like this for your case:javascript\n$('poster selector').css('opacity', 0.2);\n$('video').mediaelementplayer({\n     // all your configuration\n     success: function (media) {\n            media.addEventListener('loadedmetadata', function () {\n           $('poster selector').css('opacity', 1);\n       }, false);\n    }\n});\n           . You might need to play with transition effects but this gives you an idea of how to do it. Yeah that should do it just play with animation in case you want to achieve something fancier but you are on the right track. You have to use jQuery for that. animate will do the trick. Great. I'll add this in the documentation for reference. Thanks for the info. No it's nothing wrong. Firefox is trying to detect this MIME type that doesn't exist (is custom and basically only used for the plugin). Are you having any issues by playing the videos because of this? If not disregard the message or remove the type attribute. PR merged. Thanks. No that's correct. Since the player has to create an iframe for it, that's what the iframe does, and we don't have any control over it.. This applies to any renderer that generates iframes. Probably, but the issue is to implement it on the player. This assumes only video/iframes that are already in the markup. The player creates the iframes and that's when the real issue comes. It will take a lot of work to integrate it given that has impact on the core and all the renderers. So for now it can't be addressed. Sorry. Sorry for the delay answering this: https://github.com/lewisnyman/posterfill may help you with the poster images.\nAbout the formats: in my experience, I always prefer live stream but it all depends on what you are trying to achieve with them. If you use high definition for your responsive layout, users with low-bandwidth are gonna experience a big delay. That's all I can advise you, since in my field we tend to use more streaming to achieve better results, but user cannot download our videos with that approach.\nThanks, and again my apologies for the delay. Can you share a URL where I can check this please?. I tested this using mediaelement-plugin repository and the latest version of the MEJS plugin. I couldn't reproduce that error. Tested on Chrome, FF and Safari. Can you share a URL to check this issue please?. You are using a really old version of the package. The one I see is 2.8.1, and currently the latest one is 3.1.3. With old version I can't guarantee that all browsers will work. If you upgrade you shouldn't get any errors. . Closing this one, and once you update, if you still have issues, we can reopen this. Thanks.. Ok I'll check this. You tested only on Win 8 correct?. OK I'll check this with Browserstack and let you know my findings. Thanks. I just checked on Browserstack using WIn8 Safari 5.1.7 and it worked.\n\n\n. This URL is sending me to a 403 page. I haven't received it yet. Can you send the link so I can verify it on Browserstack please?. With iOS in general we support only iOS8+, nothing below. I checked your site on Win8 Safari and I was able to see it\n\n. I really don't know what to say about what you are seeing with Win8, because I can see it. Can you send me screenshots of Firebug Console to have a little clue. I don't have a physical Win8 machine to test this. I used Browserstack and everything is fine. Can you do me a favor and download the latest version of the plugin, and test again, please? I used a different approach to determine the source on the Flash renderer. See if that works for you. Thanks for sending me the screenshots they really helped. I'll wait for your confirmation. Any updates on this?. You need to download the latest version from GitHub some of the fixes haven't been released yet officially. Let me know and if it hasn't been fixed attach new screenshots of you Firebug please. Any updates on this using the master branch?. Thanks for pointing this. This is now fixed.. PR merged. Thanks. PR merged. Thanks. PR merged. Thanks. No I'll remove it in a minute. Thanks for pointing that out. Done. PR merged. Thanks. Can you share a URL when you see this behavior, so I can have it as a baseline of what's the current behavior and how to solve this, please?. Thanks I appreciate it. You can post the HTML here if its easier for you. Either way, I'll wait for your feedback on that and I'll start to work on that this week. @dmongrel I almost have this feature ready. I'm just trying to test multiple scenarios and fix whatever I missed. I'll let you know when ready. Thanks. @dmongrel Please download the master branch and test your scenario. I tested a considerable amount of permutations and it worked just fine, but I want your validation on this. Please let me know. Thank you for reporting this. I'm glad it worked for you. PR merged. Thanks. PR merged. Thanks. I'll check this and let you know. Thanks for reporting this. I installed Wordpress on my machine and I'm unable to reproduce this without replacing the $ symbol. Do you have jQuery.noConflict activated or something like that?. That's weird because that element was added on line 3497:\njavascript\nif (typeof jQuery !== 'undefined') {\n    _mejs2.default.$ = _window2.default.jQuery = _window2.default.$ = jQuery;\n}. Which version of Wordpress you are using? Because I downloaded and installed 4.7.1 and no issues. OK I'l download that and let you know. Thanks. Yes that would be fine.. Thanks for your assistance. The fix for the jQuery.noConflict() has been put into the master branch. Closing this issue now. You haven't set the path for the Flash shims using pluginPath; once you do it you should be fine. Also, keep in mind that FLV now can be played natively, and Flash should be only a fallback. We are trying to move away of Flash and be more a HTML5 only player. This is what you should do:\njavascript\n$('video').mediaelementplayer({\n    renderers: ['native_flv', 'flash_video'],\n        pluginPath: 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mediaelement/3.1.3/build/',\n    shimScriptAccess: 'always'\n});\nLet me know if it works for you. Just download the master branch from GitHub and test this; the autoplay is something I'm checking. What you can do for now is to do the following to autoplay:\njavascript\n$('video').mediaelementplayer({\n        renderers: ['flash_video', 'native_flv'],\n        pluginPath: 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mediaelement/3.1.3/',\n        shimScriptAccess: 'always',\n        success: function(media) {\n            if (media.rendererName.match(/flash/) !== null) {\n                media.play();\n            }\n        }\n    });\nJust make sure you download the master branch from Github and install it; I found an issue that prevented this to work properly. Use this for now:\njavascript\n$('video').mediaelementplayer({\n        renderers: ['flash_video', 'native_flv'],\n        pluginPath: 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mediaelement/3.1.3/',\n        shimScriptAccess: 'always',\n        success: function(media) {\n            if (media.rendererName.match(/flash/) !== null && media.originalNode.getAttribute('autoplay')) {\n                media.play();\n            }\n        }\n});\nI need to check the SWF files but it's gonna take some time since I'm not an AS3 expert. But with this you are covered. I'll keep you posted on any progress but for now I'll close this issue. Thanks for reporting this. @astr0junk Thanks; if can also take a look of issues #2078 and #2084 I'd appreciate it. PR merged. Thanks.  If you provide our URL with your issue I will take a look. Thanks. Or at least post the code you are using so I can try to replicate your issue and provide some guidance. The player has an error callback in the configuration, so whenever you are dealing with an error you can do anything you want inside the callback. Something like this:\njavascript\n$('video').mediaelementplayer({\n     // All your configuration\n     error: function(e) {\n           // You can add action(s) here to handle your error\n     }\n})\nI tested this using this method (just printed a console.log if an error occurs) and used this YouTube video as a test: https://www.youtube.com/embed/1kIsylLeHHU; it loads it but when you try to play, the error comes on screen and console.log fires. @mangui can you assist me on this please?. @mangui Thanks I'll check this; @NathanBillington I'll give you an update when this is ready. Thanks for reporting this. Thanks for the hint @mangui I'll work on this and let you know when this is solved. Yeah but it doesn't have any effect since it's in the hls configuration where the startLoad() method is being called.. @mangui What's the proper way to determine the current position? I see that when you use startLoad() the argument is a number, and by default it's -1. How can I retrieve the position if I pause the player?. Nevermind, I don't think I need to call startLoad(X) if I pause and then play again. @mangui I think I got it solved; I'll push this change and, if you have time right now, I'd really appreciate if you could take a look to it. Just to make sure I didn't miss anything. I tested on the demo file, and it worked as expected. Just need another pair of eyes. Specifically, https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/commit/7fd4cc9ff7b0811068506f2b8ddc6e832708e2d0#diff-06257db3010a6205064081f9e9c0d800. @mangui Thanks for your review. I addressed all the items you mentioned. You are welcome to review it one more time (https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/commit/f7d2d8d1546b4233c16eb7552af8ac4b0aedb4e8), but it is basically a modification of what you suggested, and I added a stop() method to use stopLoad() from hls.js. If you approve it, I'll create the bundles again. @mangui Disregard my previous comments. Thanks for all your help! @NathanBillington please download the master branch and test again; you should be fine now. Let me know if it worked for you. @NathanBillington I tested mediaelementjs.com and it's working as expected. Thanks for reporting this. Closing this issue now. You are welcome :). @biaselectronics If you go to https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement-plugins you will find a markers plugin. Documentation on configuration is there as well. I need to check this, since on Win Edge 14 there's a condition to bypass a validation since it forbids access to navigator.plugins. I'll check this again and let you know when fixed. Thanks. Turns out that Browserstack had an issue before with this, now it seems to be fixed. So I just put the fix for this and you should see this working now. Thanks for reporting this. Just download the master branch and test it. I'll do a new release soon and it will be available on CDNs and NPM. If they don't have a preload we can add it by default to none; would that work?. I tested this on FF 50 using Browserstack and I couldn't find any issues. Is this something related to the Flash shims only?. Ok I'll add it soon. Thanks for reporting this.. The feature was added. Thanks for reporting this. Closing issue. PR merged. Thanks. It's on my plans to remove it soon. I'm gathering all the pieces I will need to transform and the methods or polyfills I'd need and then I'll start with it. Thanks for keeping that on the radar . You can see the progress on the MEJS-standalone branch; any questions/comments let me know. @jimmywarting this is completed, but I'd appreciate if you can help me testing the mejs-standalone branch; the demo file will be sufficient for testing purposes. My focus should be IE9+, Chrome, Safari, FF, Android 4+ and iOS 8+. Any help you can provide me or feedback will be very welcome.. Perfect that's a good start. Keep me posted if anything comes up please. Thanks for testing this. I'll check these items and let you know when ready for another round of testing. I appreciate the help on this. Ok all the issues you posted have been fixed (except the on in Safari, that I can't do anything, but I like the idea of a plugin for it). Please check the branch again and let me know your feedback. Thanks. My apologies. I didn't push the fix for the time buffering. It's pushed now, so please download the latest version. I'll check this last one you pointed out. Thanks.. FYI I figured out the issue with the pause button. Download the latest version of the mejs-standalone branch and give it a try. Perfect. Just summarizing, which browsers did you test? and did you test on Android 4+ or iOS 8+?. OK do you have the possibility of testing Android? I can test iOS. I tested IE9 - 11 and all looks good. Let me know if we can close this ticket. SO far I haven't found any issues, and this will be released as the 4.x version soon.. If you wanna test it one more time, please do. Just download the latest version. I've made some last minor fixes in code formatting but that's it.. Thanks for pointing this. I'll be fixing this parts of the documentation soon. For the first point if you don't use JavaScript to instantiate the player it won't work. The Usage section tells the many ways it can be done but if you need more details I'll add it to avoid any confusion. I added a specific section, short but concise, in the Installation section about Player setup, and fixed the issue on the main site. Thanks for reporting this. Closing issue now. Use the width and height attributes for the video or audio tags, set the stretching to none and perhaps CSS to achieve the desired behavior. Definitely submit a PR and I'll be happy to take a look. Let me check today and I'll assess how much time it will take me. Maybe not long but I'll let you know today before you start working on something. Unfortunately, I need to continue working on removing all the jQuery dependencies on the plugin and it's gonna take some time. So you are welcome to submit a PR so I can review it. Thanks in advance for any help you can provide. @harhoo If you still want this, I can provide a captionschange event, and the info you will obtain from it is:\n\nAnd you could use it like this:\njavascript\n$('video').mediaelementplayer({\n    // other parameters\n    success: function(media) {\n        media.addEventListener('captionschange', function(e) {\n        console.log(e);\n    });\n    }\n});\nLet me know if this is something you might found useful and I'll integrate it in the next release. Thanks.. Perfect. I'll add this today and let you know.. OK @harhoo the code to achieve this has been merged into master branch. Closing this issue now. For this one, it can't change currently once the the payer is rendered. Try calling playerInstance.buildvolume(player, controls, layers, media), where:\n* player is an instance of MediaElementPlayer\n* controls is the Node that contains the controls\n* layers is the Node that contains the layers, like big Play button\n* media is the Node that mimics all the HTML5 events/methods/etc.. Interesting let me check this and ping you back. Did you try mainPlayer.media.buildvolume?. I'm checking this right now, because there are some methods that you can use I don't know why you are getting this error. I tested the code from the demo file and if I add the following inside the callback to set new sources:\n```javascript\n$('select[name=sources]').on('change', function () {\n     // All the original code \nplayer.options.audioVolume = 'vertical';\n_this.closest('.players').find('.media-wrapper').find('.mejs__volume-button').remove();\nplayer.buildvolume(player, player.controls, player.layers, player.media);\n\n});\nIt works, without changing the code at all. Well I'm glad I was able to help you man ;). To be honest I never thought about it. I'm inclined right now to say yes, it's too soon. But we can always reassess this. Right now my priority is to rewrite the player to make it framework agnostic, so no more jQuery dependencies are in the code.. Thanks man :) It's been a lot of effort to make the player high quality again, but still there's work to be done. And it's thanks to people who report issues that we can make this better :). For this (since it's a Wordpress site) I don't know if you updated all the things (including the `wp-*` prefixed files inside the `wp-includes/js/mediaelement` folder. I couldn't find where is the call for `mediaelementplayer()`, and that's the key. Check this link and follow all teh steps there: https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39686. OK I tested your demo on Browserstack and I found a bug. So I fixed it but I'll need you to download the master from GitHub and install it on your WordPress website so we can verify that is all fixed now. Let me know if that solved your issue, since I think Browserstack has blocked Flash on Chrome completely so I can't give you certainty that the issue got completely fixed.. Verified via Browserstack that the issue was fixed and I didn't see any errors. Just use the master branch in your website. I'll release the next version next week. Closing this issue now. Thanks. If you can provide the URL where HLS and FLV don't play I'd appreciate it. And this is only for Android correct? Since FLV won't work at all on iOS since it doesn't accept Flash and it doesn't have MSE. And also if you can indicate which versions of Android did you test it would be helpful given that I tried browserstack for this issue. Glad to hear that and thanks for reporting this. Check your server config maybe it's not accepting SVG or it's not set the MIME type for it, because the SVG sprite is there. There must be a specific file like an httpd.conf file; I don't know the specifics on IIS. https://www.w3.org/services/svg-server/ See if this helps. Since this is not an issue with the plugin closing this issue now. Thanks for reporting this. this issue was reported before and got fixed in 3.x version. So you are saying that piece doesn't work?. I guess what I'm failing to see it's why this is affecting you. Given the way the plugin is bundled you don't have that scope to rely on undefined variables unless they truly are. If the plugin detects jQuery it will use it for other dependencies or plugins that the player may need. And this is a crucial piece that was introduced to support all were press themes that are already there so it will be difficult to remove this.  Sorry I meant Wordpress . Ok let me check this with more detail and come up with the solution that satisfies everybody. The problem is that some are using Zepto as well it's not just jQuery. I'm glad you brought that up because that's my focus currently. I finished phase 1 so next week I'll start with phase 2 and it won't be more issues with this ;). PR merged. Thanks. Thanks for your work on this PR; is people like you that makes this plugin outstanding. This work LGTM but I'll need you to fix the unit tests so I can completely approve this PR and also answer the question posted above.. Or if you are not opposed I can make the changes for you . Yeah I agree let's bring the fix that you mention and to run the test use npm install and then n run test. Sorry npm run test. I'd say add it as an option and with that this PR will be covered . Sounds like a plan. Let me know when you are ready to review this. Thanks for your work on this. I'll review it one more time, fix the issues and merge. PR merged. Thanks for all the work you did on this. Thanks for working on this PR. I'd really appreciate it if you share a URL or the logs you got, because in my experience that has nothing to do with it. The asynchronous side is only when AJAX are being applied, and unless any event is removing another one, this shouldn't make any difference. I just want to make sure that's the problem and we are not just patching the code. Let me know your thoughts, and once it's completely understood the nature of this, I'll merge this fix.. Ok here's what I'm gonna do (just because if the approach I took with those variables is causing this issue, I need to replace this everywhere): I'm gonna submit in a minute a change in terms of how I dealt with `i` and `il` and if that works that means I need to avoid doing this. But if not, I'll merge yours. . OK download the master branch and test with the approach I took. Only reason I'm asking to do this is because as a best practice, you always need to set the total of what you are looping before you start looping. Let me know ASAP, please.. I see, well I'll merge this PR. Thanks for the time of explaining all of this to me, since it's an odd one.. PR merged. Just give it a try one more time please and let me know if everything is working at it should. Thanks.. Thank you for testing this. I use popular packages to integrate them with MEJS, and although I do it that way I can't speak for the very specifics of each one of them. Certainly in the future I'll try to add more packages but in your specific situation the best solution for you is to transform FLV to MP4, since FLV may be supported natively with flv.js, but on iOS that's not possible (mobile constrains). MP4 is universal and by far the best solution for cross-browser/cross-device apps (like yours). I'd suggest you to wait like 2 weeks I'm currently working on removing jQuery from the plugin you can see the progress on the mejs-standalone branch. This week I'll be completing the phase 2 and then to test this. PR merged. Thanks. Yes, `pluginType`, as stated on the section `Migrating from 2.x to 3.x`, was removed and needs to be changed with `rendererName`. Thanks for reporting this. I'll get it fix as soon as possible and ping you back.. Please download the master branch and test this again. The fix is in place and once you confirm this is solved, I'll release the change. Thanks. Glad it got fixed. Can you send me the URL where you are experiencing issues, please?. Gotcha. Good catch. You need to add this:css\nbackground-position: 0 -39px;\nto your `.mejs__overlay-button` CSS rule. I'll update this on the documentation right now. Thanks. Updated documentation with the correct CSS rules for this. Thanks for reporting this.. Just check the documentation update. You won't need to this whole thing. Just do what it says now and you should be fine. Glad to know it worked for you. Well only thing I can say is that `preload` shouldn't be false; values are `none`, `meta` or `auto` but that's it. If that doesn't work, you may need to send me the URL and check it. Can you provide a URL to check this, please?. @bricev Please download the master branch and test this; the `readyState` in the shim should have been outside of the conditional. Now it seems to be fine. Let me know. Glad to know that.. If it's live you don't get a time duration. What is what you are experiencing?. Or can yo provide a URL so I can see this, please?. You are welcome. Glad you figured this out. Thanks. Although sounds like a good idea, the major focus nowadays is either streaming sources, MP3 or OGV. I don't know if it's worth adding more than we need for now. I'll explore the OGG and VORBIS in a future phase. I'll check this and let you know. I checked the main website on iOS and works fine. I'm tempted to say it's an encoding issue with your file. Check the [Resources](https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/blob/master/docs/resources.md) page and see if anything of that can help you. Thanks.. Yes, please. If you wanna submit a PR for this, I'll be happy to review it. Thanks for pointing this.  This one was in the old version but given the new approach we took this weapon carry it over so I need to check if we really need a renderer or just a piece of code . I'll work on this tonight in the `mejs-standalone` branch, and I'll let you know when it's ready so you can test it. This branch will become the 4.0 version of this player soon. @Jezza Can you give me a URL that can cannot be played so I can test this, please?. @Jezza I tried a test case using a dummy MIME type to check this. If you download the `mejs-standalone` branch and test it, please let me know if it works for you. Thanks. Perfect. Keep me posted please. Don't forget that this fix is on the mejs-standalone branch. Any updates on this?. Yeah if you can test this on Monday I'd appreciate it. I don't think it will be difficult to provide links for each element so let me explore that and I'll keep you posted. Maybe the Mime type won't be that important given that it is spelled in the URL for each source. Is there a reason why that could be useful?. OK I think I have it ready. Download the latest version of mejs-standalone branch and test it on Monday, please and let me know. Should I close this ticket? This will be part of the 4.x version and it will be released soon. You are welcome. Glad it worked. Closing this PR since it's pointing to the master branch, and if you download the latest version of `mejs-standalone` branch, you'll see that's gone. Yes, please. I'll review it when you have it ready. Thanks for the hint, I didn't know this one was available. PR merged. Thanks. @sonalitailored Yes, I tried with my iPhone 5S and it worked. [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/docs/en/latest/get-handbrake/download-and-install.html) can help you to optimize your media sources for Web. The `loadedmetadata` cannot be triggered on iOS; that's a constrain for those devices, so using this tool might be a good start to fix the issues on your media. Only thing I really noticed is that even in desktop, takes some time to play, meaning that either the file is really heavy, or the download index is at a very different position (and not at the beginning) and takes a long time to start the media. Also, this tool (http://renaun.com/blog/code/qtindexswapper/) is worth trying to solve that issue. . Since this issue is not related to the plugin itself, I'm closing this issue. Thanks.. If you have any more questions, please let me know in this ticket. The problem is that `mediaelementplayer.js` is not trying to use native FLV support: is using Flash only. So in your case you will need to do something like this:javascript\n$('video').mediaelementplayer({\n      renderers: ['flash_video'],\n      pluginPath: '/path/to/swf files/',\n      // other configuration you might need\n})\n``. Are you experiencing this issue with the latest version of the package? Can you send me a URL so I can see this please?. Can you provide the URL for the file, please? I can't test this since the source is local. Thanks. I checked this, and I think your issue is with other HTML elements'z-index. You either put a higherz-indexin yourembedtag, or remove the one in your HTML elements. I couldn't replicate your issue. Let me know. I see. I need to take a look at that version. I'm not familiarized with older versions since my focus was since 2.20. I'm tempted to say (based on what I saw in the current AS files) that it used the native Fullscreen approach and it stopped in latter versions. I need to find out why this happened.. @astr0junk is this something you can assist with?. After digging into the code of past versions I found out that it is problematic to enable this because the controls always disappear unless you set thealwaysControlsVisibleflag totrue`.  Flash requires a Flash button to enable the fullscreen mode; there's no way to fake it with Javascript. So that means that a button is always gonna be present no matter what, and can cause other issues. If you have any feedback about this is very welcome, but by the points described, I'd be closing this, until an idea on how to achieve this is posted. Sorry for any inconveniences. I see. We need to see in terms of supporting IE9+; I think for the rest of the browsers it will be fine to change this.. Let me know what you think about this: https://blog.garstasio.com/you-dont-need-jquery/events/#sending-custom-events. Oh, I just found this polyfill, so I think we can go forward with this: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent/CustomEvent. According to the link above:\n\nInternet Explorer >= 9 adds a CustomEvent object to the window, but with correct implementations, this is a function.. OK I'll do this in a minute. We'll require another round of tests. Are you up for it?. perfect I'll let you know when it's ready. @jimmywarting The implementation is now in mejs-standalone. I tested this on IE9+ and worked. Thanks for pointing this. Keep me posted about your testing. Take a look at the examples on one of the plugins on the MediaElementJS Plugins (like this one: https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement-plugins/blob/master/dist/loop/loop.js). As you will see the link above described the proper way to deal with the operation, just adjust whatever the Stackoverflow described to the new way of setting things in 3.x version. The link I posted above should give all what you need to port the Stackoverflow code into the new version. It is supposed to work that way.  Some renderers like YouTube and Facebook show their native play button, so to avoid causing overlap, we hid the MEJS play button. @tsarma Is this currently happening with the latest version? If so, can you provide a URL so I can check this, please?. If you could provide a Fiddle to attempt to replicate what you are seeing it will help me tremendously. Thanks I'm looking at it right now. I'll keep you posted. Please download the master branch. I found a typo and it seems to be working now. Let me know and please star the project so we continue supporting it. Thanks. Glad to know if worked, and thanks for reporting it. The event must be fired since if you check the demo file and play the default filenyou must see a change in the play/pause button. I'd be happy to take a look to your issue if you share a URL. The autoplay: true where does that come from? There's no place in the documentation that states a config element like that. I tested your demo file using 3.2.4 version in Chrome and I used HLS in the demo file and fired an alert when reached the end.\n\n. Here's the test with FF\n\n. You are welcome. Glad it worked for you. Can you share a URL where I can see this please?. @Kanooh Please download the latest version, and that should be fixed there. The min width the player will have is 250px to avoid breaking the control bar layout. It's OK I'm glad it worked. Closing issue. Yes that's expected. Please star us to continue giving the package more popularity, and also tell your friends/coworkers/etc. to support the project, if you don't mind. Thank you very much. If you remove the min-heigh and min-width from the mejs__container, does that help?. Gotcha let me take a look on that and I'll keep you posted. I've tried the demo file and I couldn't see any difference. If you can provide me a URL it will be more helpful. The only places where that gets assigned is when you do a fullscreen request, or you use a stretching mechanism. There must be something else that your code does that I'm not seeing. If you can help me with it or have a URL I can look at, I'd appreciate it. Here's the screenshot of my output:\n\nI'll check any hints on Monday, so in the mean time if you can provide me some more info or the URL, I can help you to debug this. I figured out. It was a typo when detecting stretching for auto mode. Please download the master branch and test it again. It should be fine now. Thanks. Perfect. Glad it works now. This fix will be available at the end of next week in a new release. Thanks for testing this. Closing issue now. Have a nice weekend!. Which version are you using? The above should work, but also there's the error element in the configuration:\njavascript\nthis.st.player = new window.MediaElementPlayer('player', {\n     success: (media, node) => {\n     },\n     error: (media, node) => {\n     }\n });. No worries. Hablo en espa\u00f1ol tambien por si algun dia lo necesitas.. I'd suggest to try the master branch and see if it solves it. If not, I'll ask this on the HLS.js project. They will give you a more in-depth answer. Keep me posted. Yeah post this on https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js and see what they say. Keep me posted, please. Closing this issue since it's not related to plugin.. Thanks for reporting this. I'll take a look and keep you posted on this. @DanRobinsonRV I checked your example. 2 things I found:\n\nThe setup is correct and you should be able to use it the way you are, but there's a typo: for the rtmp file you should set the type as video/rtmp\nI tried to play the RTMP source and I couldn't. However, if I changed the order so the first element is either DASH or M3U8, they both played properly.\n\nAlso, if you want to force a certain order, you have to use the renderers config element. By default, the players tries the native renderers and then the Flash shims, and finally the iframes renderers, such as Youtube.\njavascript\nrenderers: ['native_hls', 'native_dash', 'flash_video']\nPlease let me know if you have any more questions. No worries. Glad I could help. Closing this issue now. Ok I'll check this and keep you posted. OK seems that you need to remove the src element from your video tag. \nAlso, in your configuration, you don't need the plugin configuration. The only shims supported now is Flash, not Silverlight.\nThat is conflicting with setting the new sources in old browsers. I fixed the undefined issue so download the master branch. Worth noticing that I played the RTMP and it was only black and no sound. It lasted 24 secs. I assume that it is that way for now.\n\n. That's interesting I didn't do any changes in terms of styles for the 4.0.3 version.\nI'll give it a second look later but I event tested this on Browserstack and it worked on IE10. Also I don't know if the canplay is doing something. In my test i just didn't use that event callback . If you can make that change or switch the preload to none and then execute the event canplay that could work. Not in front of my computer now but let me know. OK I was able to make it work using the following HTML:\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n\n\n\n\nMediaElement.js 3.0 - audio/video unification library\n\n\n\n\n",
    "perler": "ok, forgive me my ignorance, but how do i use this line? right now, i call the player like this:\n<audio id=\"player2\" src=\"http://bigstream.coloradio.org:8000/coloradio_96.ogg\" type=\"audio/ogg\" controls=\"controls\">\n. ",
    "leighmcculloch": "The behavior of the stop button is different between the Flash and HTML5 versions.\nClicking stop on the Flash version stops the streaming and no more content is downloaded. Clicking play following this will cause the stream to rebuffer and then start playing the latest live content.\nClicking stop on the HTML5 version pauses the playing, but content continues to buffer in the background and clicking play will cause the stream to play from where it left off.\nI understand that the HTML5 implementation has no 'stop' and only a pause. Normally if one wanted to stop a HTML5 audio element in the true sense they would destroy the element and recreate it with autoplay off. I propose that clicking stop on the MEjs controls should do this for HTML5.\nI'm currently looking at using MEjs for a radio station for in browser live streaming and at the moment this is one of the main issues I'm having using the script. At the moment I'm resolving to use this script in shim mode forcing flash when it's available, and I'm calling mediaelement.stop() when the pause listener fires.\nP.S. Thanks John for making a great script!\n. I have an issue with my player not working in FF or Opera. The only way I can get it to play is to use the code above to start it. But even then, once I click stop, and start again, it won't work like it did at first.\nThe player is at: http://hopemedia.leighmcculloch.com/player/\n. I dug down into the media player code, and removed the \"media.play()\" that occurs when the big play button is pressed, and replaced it with \"setTimeout($.proxy(media, 'play'), 0)\". Making this change made it work on Opera and Firefox. Diff is below.\n```\ndiff --git a/build/mediaelement-and-player.js b/build/mediaelement-and-player.js\n--- a/build/mediaelement-and-player.js\n+++ b/build/mediaelement-and-player.js\n@@ -2598,7 +2598,7 @@\n                    e.preventDefault();\n                if (media.paused) {\n\n\nmedia.play();\nsetTimeout($.proxy(media, 'play'), 0);\n                    } else {\n                        media.pause();\n                    }\n```\n. I think these comments I've made are really a separate issue, so I'm putting them in a new issue: https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/issues/440\n. That not-ideal-fix isn't working any longer with v2.9.1. So this is still an issue. Any help would be much appreciated.\n. I believe so, I never found a way to solve the problem and I think I worked around it by removing the DOM element from the page to completely stop it from streaming. @anthonyeden inherited the (ugle) code I'd written. @anthonyeden are you still using mediaelement.js in http://hope1032.com.au/player/?\n. \n",

John,\nI will check the IE/flash item separately, I may have an issue with events bubbling (or not) out of the flash element.\nI have just downloaded the latest files (2.1.1.dev) but can't see any differences in build\\mediaelement-and-player.min.js, only in src/js/mep-player.js (as per https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/commit/e8375e1b80d61787058a3c707d0211de0d4ff0c7). Should the build\\ files have changed too?\nShould I try to include files from the src directory? Which ones?\nFeel free to send me any test files (minus the demo videos!) I'll be happy to test\nMatt\n. No problem, that makes sense to keep untested stuff out of build.\nI ran the build script and have uploaded the latest files. \nI still get an error on the iPhone, so I made another test page that doesn't use the minified version so errors would be a bit easier to track down, but...\nhttp://watermarkltd.com/test4.html (uses minified)\nWhen you click \"video 2\" link\niPhone error: in mediaelement-and-player.min.js, TypeError: Result of expression 'this.media' [undefined] is not an object\nhttp://watermarkltd.com/test4a.html (mediaelement-and-player.js)\nWhen you load the page\nline 905: parse error (on all browsers)\nline 13: MediaElementPlayer is not defined (probably because of above error)\nHave I stuffed something up running the build script? I used Python 2.7.1\n. Nice one John, yes it's working great.\nI have updated the test case above (http://watermarkltd.com/test4.html) with the latest files.\nTested and working on:\n- Win XP IE6\n- Windows Server 2003 IE7\n- Win 7 IE8 (8.0.7600)\n- iPhone iOS4\n- Win7 Firefox 3.6.14\n- Win7 Firefox 4.0 b12\n- Win7 Chrome 10.0.648.127 beta\nIt doesn't work on\n- Win 7 64 bit IE9 RC (this will be the same is issue #146)\n- IE 8 (8.0.6001) on Windows Web Server 2008 - I wouldn't worry too much about this though, server OS with not-up-to-date browser wouldn't be very common. If other IE8 users have issues, I can test this further and let you know.\n. Hi John,\nI am using jQuery 1.5.1 on that test case (downloaded a couple of days ago - just the released version - not jQuery GIT). Let me know if you want another test case with a different version of jQuery. I just double checked and the contents of the current download file from jQuery.com is the same as the js/jQuery/jquery-1.5.1.min.js file I'm using on that test case. \n. John,\nI will see if I can get a 32 bit virtual with IE9RC and check it. I'll also look for any other info on anyone else having trouble with H.264 playing on 64bit Win7. It could also be a problem on my machine with the graphics card and hardware acceleration, so if another Win7 64bit machine is fine, we won't worry about it.\nI'm in Auckland NZ, so lunch might be a bit of a stretch =)\nYou won't want to know that the client has just told me the latest version of Safari is acting up... more on that soon... =/\n. IE9 RC 64 bit on Win 7 is working fine for me now, the issue was using jQuery.show() and hide(), have now switched to positioning -9999px to show and hide.\n. new MediaElementPlayer('#videoPlayer') method doesn't work in IE7 either.\nSorry I meant to say that the error on both IE6 and IE7 is:\n0.player is null or not an object and the error is happening inside the jQuery 1.5.1 js file\n. lol, Watermark will laugh when I tell them they've made it into a code-name.\nHave updated the MediaElement files and IE6 and IE7 are working now. Thanks for the fix.\nI hope I'm not being a pain, I've checked plenty of the other components, and I've decided this is the one that's worth spending the time on, building the test cases, and helping out where I can. The fact that you are jumping on fixes straight away is just awesome.\n. ",

Thanks John,\nFlash Security Settings was the first thing to change in order to display contents locally; I also tested remotely.\nFound through videojs a fix that should actually be one of the first steps in any html5 media player installation guide (info via kurt elzner):\n1. Make a Plain Text document called \"htaccess\" with NO \".\" at the beginning.\n2. Add this code to your plain text doc: AddType video/ogg .ogv AddType video/mp4 .mp4 AddType video/webm .webm\n3. Upload file to Root of Domain on Server.\n4. Rename \"htaccess\" to \".htaccess\"\nLong story short, Firefox was somehow being \"blocked\" by .ogv and .webm files it couldn't play (when getting rid of the  codes, it actually played the .mp4 video). Also, I thought the encoding could have gone wrong at some point, as when replacing the links of .ogv and .webm with the ones being hosted for videojs demonstration it actually worked.\nThe last thing: ALWAYS USE ABSOLUTE PATHS - if using local paths, the swf file will not work properly.\nHope this works for some people out there.\n.

I am unfortunately not experienced with audio or video streaming, so I will try to look around and see what I can find. If I do learn anything, I will update this issue.\nIt should not be too difficult though. I expect that a couple of things are required:\n- a valid content-type header (mime type)\n- a valid content-length header (amount of bytes)\nAlso, the server needs to adhere to the 'range' field given in the headers of the player request. Then again this comes from playing around with the client, so it is just an intelligent guess. I believe there are documented implementations by Adobe somewhere, but I have yet to find them.\nThanks.\n. @matrym, true the server side response should be standardized (although there are differences in html5 audio and flash audio streaming, and between http versions I believe). If you know of a server side platform that has documented it's streaming headers that'd be great.\nFor now I'm merely setting the Content-Type and Content-Length headers, which seems to work for the flash player although I am having problems with the html5 audio tag.. will look into that another day.\n. Agreed, although there are much more important issues right now that need to be addressed.\n. This is not working for me in Chrome 11 on Ubuntu 10.10 either.\n. @johndyer, I did not know about the load method, however the following does not seem to have an effect:\n```\n           var audioPlayer = mediaElement;\n       //update audio source and play\n       console.log('current audio player: %o', audioPlayer);\n       audioPlayer.setSrc('/streamFriendFile');\n       audioPlayer.load();\n       console.log('updated source: %o', audioPlayer);\n       audioPlayer.play();\n\n```\nI wonder, what does the load method do? Is it documented?\nAlso, debugging this seems very difficult. Strangely enough the Chrome Debugger is not returning the HTMLAudioElement object, but the dom element when I do\nconsole.log('mediaElement: %o', mediaElement);\n. For some reason, not immediately calling mediaElement.play() fixed the problem. Thanks.\n. @johndyer, for some reason the canplay event does not seem to fire when using flash. Any idea why?\n. made pull request\n. This did not use to work, because of the bug this commit resolved:\n//update audio source and play\n       audioPlayer.addEventListener('canplay', function() {\n           console.log('audio player can now play');\n           audioPlayer.play();\n       });\n       audioPlayer.setSrc('/streamFriendFile');\n       audioPlayer.load();\nNote that this probably exists for the video element and silverlight as well...\n.

However, navigating the file with the timeline always feels laggy.\n. Playing large MP3 files through Flash fallback remains a problem. While buffering, almost no events get fired (\"timeupdate\", for example). When the file is completely buffered, the player behaves correctly (as it would be native), but in buffer phase it\u2019s horribly instable.

The video and audio elements are implemented as two separate flash components.  So it may very well be that this bug is only present with the audio element.  \nI've tested on the latest version of Firefox and IE8, which both use flash for mp3s.  Native audio seems to work fine in Chrome & IE9.\nI posted a simplified test case here.\nClick to play the first file.  Wait for it to load a little, then click the second link.  You should see that the buffer progress indicator will continue to load for the original file, but will now start showing progress for the second file as well.\nI've also noticed that the first track will continue to download along side the second.\nThe js code I'm using:\n```\nvar player = new MediaElementPlayer('#player');\nvar play_source = function(url) {\n    player.pause();\n    player.setSrc(url);\n    player.load();\n    player.play();\n};\n$('#playlist a').click(function(e) {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    play_source($(this).attr('href'));\n});\n```\nI've also noticed a couple other issues, which seem like they may be related:\n1. The player.pause() call seems to be required with the flash fallback (not with native audio).  Otherwise, the flash component will play both tracks simultaneously.\n2. When you play the first song, then the second, then click back to the first one again, the track will not play.  It eventually does, but not until both files have completely downloaded.\nThere are a few other issues in the tracker related to setSrc with flash audio.  I've got a hunch some of these may be related.  And I would guess something is not being cleaned up when setSrc is called.\n. Hi. Thanks for the excellent workaround.  So essentially, the code gets around the bug by pulling the flash object out of the page and reinserting it, which will create a brand new object to work with.\n. Also, this may be a duplicate of bug #338\ndadaxr proposes a fix there, which involves removing event listeners.  I'm not really a flash developer, so  haven't been able to test out his fix yet.\n.

    "kilokeith": "Looks to be broken. I tried rebuilding the flash source with no errors, and no luck. I've only just started looking at it, so I can't say for sure what the issue is or provide a fix. But this bug is critical for me so I'm going to start looking into a fix this weekend. Though I wish you had an easy answer for me John.\n. So the problem is actually inherent in the way this was built. Normally, the seek bar, time codes, controls are all HTML and placed over the player. This is how the Flash player works as well. It has some numbers, but no seek bar..etc. I guess that keeps things simple and the styling consistent. But when you go full scree with the Flash player, it's outside the chrome and you can't do anything with HTML. So the Flash player needs to be built with a set of backup controls that take over in full screen. I don't really care if they match, just as long as there's something there. The fix is more than I'm able take on right now, if anyone wants a go at it.\n. ",

It seems something is causing the DOM to redraw the SWF in firefox when you run these calls and the flash player does not update it's src URL. If you turn on pluginDebugging, you can see the setSrc, load, and play calls being received by the SWF in other browsers (IE 8 for example) but mac firefox just does a SWF refresh and reloads the original src file.\nIn fact, just calling \"player.pause()\" and then \"player.setSrc(\" appears to wipe out the existing SWF and replace it.\n. Well - I spoke too soon. I was moving around a parent div with jquery, and mac firefox will \"refresh\" an embedded SWF if you mess with it in the DOM at all.

On further thought to my question 2 above I can only think of only a few things that may happen:\n- A 400 or 500 error is returned\n- The query string is ignored and the file is delivered from the start\nAt least for nginx we received various results:\n_initial play without start query string_\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nServer: nginx/1.0.11\nDate: Fri, 14 Dec 2012 22:17:21 GMT\nContent-Type: video/x-flv\nContent-Length: 22921624\nLast-Modified: Tue, 11 Jan 2011 20:35:51 GMT\nConnection: keep-alive\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\n_seek beyond current buffer using start:15982170 query string_\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nServer: nginx/1.0.11\nDate: Fri, 14 Dec 2012 22:19:46 GMT\nContent-Type: video/x-flv\nContent-Length: 6939467\nLast-Modified: Tue, 11 Jan 2011 20:35:51 GMT\nConnection: keep-alive\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\n_weirdly enough seeking to start of video outside of buffer creates a partial_\nHTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content\nServer: nginx/1.0.11\nDate: Fri, 14 Dec 2012 22:21:02 GMT\nContent-Type: video/x-flv\nContent-Length: 1\nLast-Modified: Tue, 11 Jan 2011 20:35:51 GMT\nConnection: keep-alive\nContent-Range: bytes 3330400-3330400/22921624\nUse-case 3 likely won't happen often as users won't be seeking to the beginning of the video outside of the buffer.\nUse-case 1 & 2 are equivalent from the player's perspective minus the Content-Length. The flashplayer wouldn't have a way of knowing whether the query string start request worked (i.e. delivered a segment rather than the entire video) without already knowing the size of the full media; which is can't be assured of knowing.\nIt would be ideal to be able to detect whether pseudo streaming so that the UI controls can match the capabilities of the player but doesn't seem easily possible to detect from flashplayer client.\nMaybe I'll come up with another simple idea later but for now we'll just move forward implementing the pseudo-streaming assuming it works and provide a flag to enable/disable it in the playhead.\n. Just thought that if you don't allow end-users to seek past the buffer until you receive the metadata from the video you would be able to determine if the server is able to do pseudo-streaming by:\n- Attempting the start query string param to the point the end-user selected\n- Parsing the returned header information and determining if the content-length is equivalent to the size of the full video recorded from the metadata.\ncontent-length == size of video => Server doesn't support pseudo-streaming\ncontent-length != size of video => Server does support pseudo-streaming\nThen that setting would be stored for the rest of the session until a player reload occurs and would be able to properly inform the user if they can seek past the buffer using the playhead.\n.

    "ventrebleu": "Hi,\nI'm having the same issue on my side: apparently, my audio file (an .m4a) doesn't play with Firefox or IE8 with Flash installed on XP PCs... phew!\nCan someone help me out with that?\n@samueldjack could you give me a bit more information about your workaround?\nThanks!\n. Nevermind, I found your answer on stackoverflow. I put it here too just uin case:\n$('#player').mediaelementplayer({\n   pluginVars: 'isvideo=true',\n});\nAnd thanks again, this made my day!\n. LOL sorry about that\n. Hello, same thing for me, I don't know how to let user close Youtube's ad, and that's pretty annoying.\nMaybe we should have an option to remove the pause when you click on the video?\nThanks in advance for your advice!\n. ",
    "quinncomendant": "Here's an easy way to set isvideo=true for only the media which requires it. To use this be sure your .m4a files are delivered with the apache/mp4 content type and the audio source type attribute contains type=\"audio/mp4\" when loading a .m4a file. Here's the javascript:\n$('audio,video').each(function(i) {\n    // Need to add the 'isvideo' hack for 'audio/mp4' media types.\n    var plugin_vars = ($(this).children('source').attr('type').search('audio/mp4') > -1) ? 'isvideo=true' : '';\n    $(this).mediaelementplayer({\n        pluginVars: plugin_vars\n    });\n});\n. Well, it would be nice to have the workaround described in this ticket added to mediaelement core (i.e., adding 'audio/mp4' to the mejs.plugins.flash.types config, and including the logic to use \"isvideo=true\" when necessary). I'm surprised others haven't come up against this issue before; Firefox + audio/mp4 doesn't seem too obscure of a collision. \n. Thanks @phinze,\nBTW, in case it helps I wrote more clarity on the [http://stackoverflow.com/a/25507013/277303}(stackoverflow question).\n. Correct you are; I reinstalled Firefox's Flash and it's working now. =\\\n. Hey hey,\nYes, it seems the overlay was miscalculated. I set width=\"100%\" on the <video> element and now the double play buttons do not appear. \nBTW, when I said \"the lower one plays the video using mediaelement's player\", I meant the lower one in the screenshot before. See how there are two circular play icons? Clicking the lower of the two would allow playing the video directly in the mediaelement player. So it's the iphone isn't limited to video in its native player. But since I've fixed the page now, this isn't possible. This in fact is a little bothersome because even clicking the play icon in the lower left corner of the video screen doesn't do anything; before it would play using mediaelement player. I guess there is an overlay that prevent these controls from functioning on the iphone? To play the video I must click the big circular play icon in the center. If you want to test this the page is at http://goo.gl/RvcxJj.\nThanks!\n. ",

This is a concern for me too.\nI agree with the keyboard focus problem that you've raised.

Yours, Nick\n. Hi John,\nThanks for the encouragement.\nI should say that the fixes that I've committed (specifically the first commit) have been tested with assistive technologies including JAWS screen reader, by my colleague Chetz Colwell. I've tested with VoiceOver (Mac os x) and NVDA (Windows).\nHer main feedback, which I've incorporated, was to hide the slider-handle from keyboard users before playback/ buffering commences - as you can't seek forwards until then.\nI'll do some final testing before making a pull request.\nYours,\nNick\n. Hi @rylan and @johndyer,\nAs you can see I'm finally working again on this bug/issue. Sorry for the delay :(.\nRylan, I know you've done some accessibility work on your branch - I'd like to work with on reviewing yours and your colleagues work if/when we both have a chance. Do you have any test results you can share and/or a summary of what specific issues you've fixed? I'd ike to make maximum use of your work!\n(BTW, in case you're new to open source, better to break the work into small chunks, so its more easily digestible by John and others who will have to review/ merge.)\nAnyway, I'll be issuing a pull request shortly for the progress bar enhancements attached to #635 - I hope that's OK.\nBest wishes all\nNick\n. :+1: \n+1\n\nHi @johndyer and community, @camflint's pull request looks very useful - valuable bug fixes.

Hi Nino,\nI've just seen your issue, and I have suggestions which may help.\n1. On your point \"your srt file is no good, like you ... loose all formatting for time and new line.\" Are you trying to open the SRT file in Windows Notepad or a similar editor? I suggest that you try opening the SRT file in a source code editor, for example, Notepad++ - it is open source and free to use.\n2. On your point \"Video is o.k. but there are no subtitles.\" When you open the demo page in your browser, do you see \"file:// ...\" in the address bar? I've given it a go, and it doesn't work - this is not a MediaElement.js problem, it is a security restriction relating to \"file://\" addresses and Javascript...\nSo, you need to install a web server:\n   1.  This tutorial steps you through installing XAMPP, which includes the Apache web server (again, open source and free).\n   2. After you've installed XAMPP, test as shown in the tutorial.\n   3. Then find the XAMPP installation in Windows Explorer. It may be at C:\\xampp\\. Copy the mediaelement folder, complete with video and SRT files into the htdocs folder, so that you have C:\\xampp\\htdocs\\mediaelement\\\n   4. In your browser, type http://localhost/mediaelement/demo/ in the address-bar. Click the link for the \"Track\" demo.\nThat should work. (This may help with troubleshooting.)\nLet us know how you get on. Good luck!\nBest wishes,\nNick\n. Hi @rylan,\nI've realised that what I put above may be a bit brusque, and doesn't give you credit for what is a useful and bold idea! (Its something that I've thought about for a while, and discussed with colleagues here at the Open University.)\nWe perhaps need to put our heads together, and work out how best to implement your idea, so that an end-user can dynamically switch on live-region pseudo-captions.\nYours,\nNick\n.

Hi, \nThe demo on the website still has this bug. I guess it's using the last player version. Just tab to the play button, use space or enter to click it, then hit space again to see the bug happen.\nI know it's very specific but since every button should be activated when hitting space bar, letting this event bubble through the entire player and fire the play/pause event is weird. Using other buttons with space bar (CC or full screen) fires this play/pause event too, which is awful (going full screen using keyboard could pause the video, for example).\n. Oh sorry I didn't mention it, I'm using Firefox. I don't replicate the bug on Chrome either. Maybe a browser bug?\n. @ron666 I'll try to find this out. Thanks for the effort!\n. Hi,\nI just ran a few console.log()to see where Firefox and Chrome are diverging.\nIt seems that Firefox goes a step further than Chrome. They both goes by keydown, then keyActions for space bar key then pause the media.\nI don't really get the logic behind this, but at this point they both act the same way.\nThen Firefox fires the click event on button's parent. This toggles again the play/pause state, what Chrome doesn't do.\nSo as far as I understand this, the space bar keydown event on the play button does bubble to its div parent as a click event, only in Firefox. \nI don't really get it, but it's now clear that the click event isn't fired on Chrome when button is activated through space bar. I'm still searching but that may help you. I'm moving slowly since this lib is kinda complex :)\nThanks for your patience!\n. As a complementary thought, I also found this SO explaining that the problem also exists for the mute button. Indeed, when focusing on the mute button and pressing the space bar (to mute the video, obviously) in Firefox you also play/pause the video (which is  weird).\nThe same way, when focusing on full screen and pressing space bar, you do go full screen but also toggle play/pause state.\nIt's really annoying for Firefox keyboard users.\n. Hi @ron666, I just tested and it works fine now :)\nOnly tested in Firefox 48, but since you're using UA sniffing I guess it wouldn't cause any trouble to other browsers.\nThanks!\n. ",

I just want to chime in that I'm having parallel issues with colorbox... I can open a new issue or re-open 309 if you prefer, John... just let me know.\nI'm opening my video in colorbox, using the inline method. So basically, instantiating the mediaelement in a container DIV that's hidden. Because there are several videos - it's a gallery of thumbnail links that open the colorbox - I don't want to instantiate the mediaelement every time someone clicks a link. Makes more sense to instantiate it once and swap src everytime someone clicks a different link.\nAnyhow, I've tried a number of techniques: instantiating in a hidden DIV, instantiating upon opening the colorbox for the first time, instantiating with the DIV visible and hiding it after, etc.\nIE7/8: black at first. Then I got to black-video-with-visible-but-ineffective controls. Got dual errors about mediaelement-and-player.min.js, object doesn't support this property or method, line 96, chars 64 & 427 (I'm using the latest mediaelementjs,  2.6.5).\nSafari/Chrome: Everything worked, except under some situations (instantiating then hiding container DIV using jquery), I was still getting a javascript error: Range error: maximum call stack exceeded (google tells me this is usually a recursion error). It was giving a jQuery line as the error source, but it seemed to be coming through the instantiation of mediaelement. Anyhow, got Safari and Chrome working w/o error either by instantiating in an already hidden container DIV, or by hiding the DIV after instantiation, but not directly; using a timeout.\nFirefox on Mac: caught in some kind of javascript loop as well. Just asks me if I want to kill the script or not.  In some situations I can get the video to play, but it's still obviously fighting with some kind of js loop.\nSo, I don't know... but there seems like there is some kind of recursion issue somewhere in the code that happens when the player is hidden. Googl'ing around it seems like some developers have seen similar issues when trying to manipulate google maps in hidden DIVs.\nWould love some more ideas on this. It feels soooo close.\n. +1 - once colorbox is opened and mediaplayer created, colorbox won't close. My JS error is about 'object doesn't support this property or method' (line 95, char 427 of mediaelement-and-player.min.js (2.6.5)).\nAlso of note, player.play(); doesn't work in IE7/8 within colorbox... I need to hit the play button manually.\nSee https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/issues/329#issuecomment-3475947\n. just a follow-up: I was able to solve these IE problems by:\n- using colorbox's HTML:string option (rather than appending a DIV to the dom and trying to open it using inline:true)\n- declaring all the options explicitly\nhere's an example:\n```//'videoStr' below is  an HTML  tag with a valid src and the ID = 'vplay'\n$.colorbox({html:videoStr,innerWidth:320,innerHeight:60,onComplete:function(){\n   var vplayer = new MediaElementPlayer('#vplay',{\n      defaultVideoWidth:640,\n      defaultVideoHeight:360,\n      features:['playpause','progress','current','duration','tracks','volume'],\n      success:function(mediaElement,domObject) { mediaElement.play(); }\n   });\n   $(this).colorbox.resize();\n   if (!IEold) { vplayer.play(); } \n   //IEold is a variable identifying IE7 and older, which seem to need an extra 'push'\n}});\n\n.

It's source is an infinite stream, so the duration is Infinity. \nWhen I use the native HTML5 audio player in Firefox, the default behavior is for the progress indicator to jump to the right end as the live stream plays, affording the user the option to jump to earlier parts of the stream already played, all the way back to when the play button was first pressed. \nIt would be so nice if we could do this in mediaelement, but I don't see a way. Is there some setting to make this possible? I guess not, as this bug was never quite resolved. Could we reopen the issue?\nHere's a reproduction of the issue: http://codepen.io/shindig/pen/LxVXMZ\ncf. #904 #1664. Hi @ron666, thank you for getting back to me. \nI'm having a bit of trouble testing this using the files in the build folder of the 3.x-dev branch. (Hopefully that's the correct set of files to test.) Codepen won't let me to use them directly from Github, so I've hosted the files at http://ktuh.org/temp/. This results in the error TypeError: $(...).mediaelementplayer is not a function. You can observe it in the pen linked above.\nPlease excuse me if I've made a na\u00efve error. I also tried to use the full set of build files in a local package in my Meteor project, but the update breaks all my styles and I can't see anything. Perhaps you could point me in the right direction?. Thank you, @ron666. The dev branch does fix the issue with duration display.\nI observe another issue. If the source is an infinite stream, then clicking in the progress bar results in the browser console message: TypeError: Value being assigned to HTMLMediaElement.currentTime is not a finite floating-point value. mediaelement-and-player.min.js:12:12983. Then mousing over the bar causes audio to skip. \nIt would be nice if listeners to the stream could rewind to earlier parts of their download, or skip ahead when they've paused the stream for a while. Another very simple fix would be to display \"Live broadcast\" or similar message in the progress bar if it's shown with an infinite stream playing. Safari uses this implementation.\nMeanwhile, maybe I'll use a bit of jQuery to grey out the progress bar and intercept clicks when our live stream is loaded as the source. Thanks again for all your efforts on this new version. Aloha!. Hi @ron666,\nThis is great, thank you. I notice just one small issue: Firefox for Mac doesn't consistently load the \"Live broadcast\" text. It seems to load it reliably the first time, but will oftentimes default to the progress bar when reloading the page.. You could use the pen or the same html on your local host.

I am having a different issue with this version. \nException from Tracker afterFlush function:  meteor.js:930:11\nTypeError: $(...).mediaelementplayer is not a function  meteor.js:930:1\nIn the earlier, unofficial Meteor package, mediaelementplayer was placed into global scope, which was typical of packages thru Meteor 1.2.

Glad you decided to adopt BEM. \ud83d\udc4d . Certainly. Thank you. To add the package just type: meteor add johndyer:mediaelement and press enter at the command line.. Sure thing. I should mention in case you're not super familiar with Meteor: the release of version 1.3 introduced NPM as well as ES6 imports/exports. The platform is moving toward NPM and away from Atmosphere, so if you're able to use NPM successfully in a Meteor app, you could consider deprecating the official Atmosphere package and referring people to the NPM release instead. I'm sure some people will use the Atmos package but anyway it's good to have options.. edit: I didn't see your last message before writing this. I'll give this a try now\n. Certainly, just a moment.. That does the trick to let me call the mediaelementplayer() function. I am still having issues with typeError, though.\nI'm not sure why,but setting the pluginPath to the same relative directory (which is ../../../../node_modules/mediaelement/build/ for me) does not seem to work. Even weirder, setting the path to an absolute path (ie. /node_modules/mediaelement/build/) worked once, but produced the same typeError when I refreshed the page. Other times the console produced no stack trace\u2014only the error. I'm still investigating this. It's quite bizarre.. What path did you use for pluginPath?. Thank you. I'm just heading to dinner but will be able to check it out by\ntomorrow morning at the latest :)\nOn Wed, Jan 18, 2017, 8:21 PM Rafael Miranda notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n@daveyshindig https://github.com/daveyshindig Please download the\nlatest version of the package and read the documentation about Usage to\nlearn how to import the package.

Setting it to the earlier recommended import 'relative/path/to/node_modules/mediaelement/build/mediaelement-and-player'; now also gives the same error. I'm also unable to use import 'meteor/johndyer:mediaelement' to import via the Atmosphere package.\nThere are other minutiae that seem specific to my installation. I can try using a new Meteor project to try to control for those tomorrow. Did you have better luck in your Meteor install? \nBurmese food is super delicious btw, I highly recommended it.. Hi. Apologies for the delay, I had lots of plans over the weekend. I will check again in the next few hours.. I can confirm that mediaelementplayer loads in Meteor using NPM without errors now in my project. Both relative and absolute paths work for me. For the pluginPath, I use the build directory. This resolves the TypeError issue.\nThe player still does not play my audio stream. Using setSrc to point to a\u00a0file ending in \".mp3\" will let me play the file, though. I've looked through a whole bunch of different threads here in the Github issues and I don't know what to do. Doing setSrc manually in the browser console to my URL (http://stream.ktuh.org:8000/stream-mp3) gives the error Cannot play media. No decoders for requested formats: audio/org:8000/stream-mp3. Should I open a separate issue for this?. @ron666 it's difficult to do that since I'm developing on a local host. let me see what I can do and I'll get back to you in hopefully just a few minutes, thanks!\n. Thanks again! I'm setting up ngrok as a temp host so you'll be able to see how it's running. . Here's the instance (via Ngrok): http://ef4f21df.ngrok.io/test\nI'm trying to run the demo code there. I'll push the test code momentarily so I can link here.. Here are the files I've setup for testing: https://github.com/daveyshindig/radiOMG/tree/master/imports/ui/components/test\nRight now they're configured to use the demo. . Ah, my apologies. I see the issue. I have pointed all the script links in test.html to the correct location now, and the CSS link too. I removed the link to test.js, as that script is now loaded in Meteor's onRendered() callback. Now the player renders, but it doesn't play anything when I click.. Hmm, I see it works when I put the (document).ready function into a setTimeout callback with a 1000ms wait. I think the issue may be that meteor's onRendered function is executing all the JS demo code before the DOM is rendered, even though it is not supposed to do that.. edit: Correction: the player (my version which is in the header) will stream in Chrome and Safari only on the /test page, where the demo code loads. I'm not sure what breaking change causes my player not to load on other pages. \nWhen the page loads in Chrome, it looks like a default player appears for just a split second. Then something happens and it looks terrible like the above. @ron666 have you seen anything like that previously? There's no error in the console. Maybe I need to start over, and try to base my player on the demo, IDK.. It will at least render now when delete all my mejs-related CSS and manually load the CSS in a .\nBut it still will not play. Nothing I try will get it playing. I've ripped out every bit of CSS and customization (which worked fine in 2.x!!) and nothing helps and I'm starting to really go crazy with frustration here. I have it set up exactly as you specify, but it just doesn't work for me in any browser. Clicking play is useless. \nThe header.html and header.js files show the audio player configured as you suggested: https://github.com/daveyshindig/radiOMG/blob/master/imports/ui/components/includes\nI don't know what else to do, I'm completely at a loss. I was confused how it could work just fine when I load the demo, but not at all in my header.\nThen I tried loading all the scripts from the demo, and reduced that to just this one: \n<script src=\"/mejs/mediaelement-and-player.min.js\"></script>\nand with that my player now works in the header.\nI think the trouble might be with the pluginPath. The files are all there at /mejs/ (ie. http://ef4f21df.ngrok.io/mejs/mediaelementplayer-legacy.css), and that's what I set the path to be, so I don't know if that has anything to do with it. If pluginPath fails to find the files it needs, it doesn't print errors to the console, correct? Maybe that's part of why this has been so hard to debug, IDK.. Sure. I'm glad I've at least found a workaround. I'd been trying on and off for weeks. Happy to see this seems to work with all the other code in the mediaelementplayer() init that I had earlier. Now hopefully I can get the player styles to look right. Have there been a bunch of changes to the CSS besides making replacing mejs- with mejs__ for BEM? Maybe I should expect to restyle given the big jump in versions. Anyway, I really appreciate all the advice you've given. Thank you @ron666.. ",

    "jeremyharris": "I'm also having problems with playing RTMP streams. I've verified the file is correctly set up by using Amazon's Diagnostic Tool. I've tried setting the source after the fact using the success callback as well as setting it in the original markup.\nI'd contribute but I have no idea what the problem is. Turning enablePluginDebug on doesn't reveal any problems either. I get all the way to Success..., click play and then nothing. Do you have a working example anywhere that I could look at to make sure it's not on my end?\nThanks for this project. Loving it so far.\n. I confirmed that it won't play if within a subfolder. The problem lies in all of the url manipulation not passing proper urls when creating the connection and playing in src/flash/htmlelements/VideoElement.as (I'd link to line numbers but github isn't parsing the code right).\nFor example:\n``\n_currentUrl = 'rtmp://some.cloudfront.net/cfx/st/mp4:path/to/movie.mp4';\n// when connecting inload()`\nif (_isRTMP) {\n    _connection.connect(_currentUrl.replace(/\\/[^\\/]+$/,\"/\"));\n    // yields: rtmp://some.cloudfront.net/cfx/st/mp4:path/to/\n    // should be: rtmp://some.cloudfront.net/cfx/st\n} else {\n    _connection.connect(null);\n}\n// Then, in play()\nif (_isRTMP) {\n    _stream.play(_currentUrl.split(\"/\").pop());\n    // yields: movie.mp4\n    // should be: mp4:path/to/movie.mp4\n} else {\n    _stream.play(_currentUrl);\n}\n```\nBoth of these problems cause the video not to load, because first the connection isn't valid and even if it was, movie.mp4 isn't the filename to be played.\nThe url I used in the example is pretty common but very hard to parse what the streamer is as opposed to what the actual filepath is. If the mp4: prefix was ever left out then there's virtually no way to parse it. I imagine that's why many players require you to define the streamer (passed as a flashvar) yourself. It would take some <source> tag magic away though.\nI'd help out but I don't have Flash available :/\n. @cgrube I'm not sure the author knew that this was a problem based on other threads. I just discovered that this was the cause today, so we'll probably have to wait until John has some time to work on it. That is unless you want to fork and submit a PR which I'm sure @johndyer would love.\nThe real question is how to implement a fix.\nIf you added a streamer key to the JS options when you set it up, you could then strip the streamer from the source url and you'd end up with a valid url:\njQuery('video').mediaelementplayer({\n    streamer: 'some.cloudfront.net/cfx/st'\n});\nThen the AS class would use that key to create the connection, then strip it out when it goes to play. Something like this:\n// in `load()`\n_connection.connect(_streamer);\n// in `play()`\n_stream.play(_currentUrl.replace('rtmp://'+_streamer, ''));\nAnother option would be to support a data-mediaelement-streamer attribute on the <source> tags so it could be a little more \"magical\" and entirely remain in the markup. Just some thoughts.\n. Sure do! The videos contain religious content. I'm not sure why I feel I have to note this, but we live in a sensitive world :)\nThis one doesn't work with the current code:\nrtmp://s3etkigca2rtc6.cloudfront.net/cfx/st/mp4:huntingtonbeach/files/2012/09/20120909_huntingtonbeach_message.mp4\nThis one does:\nrtmp://s3etkigca2rtc6.cloudfront.net/cfx/st/mp4:20120909_huntingtonbeach_message.mp4\nExcluding the mp4: prefix should still work, but I suppose that'll be completely up to the user by the time this change makes it in.\nThanks for your help John! If you can't get to it by Monday I should have access to Flash by then and will be able to fork and PR. Are you thinking the data- attribute or the streamer key in the options?\n. Hmm I can't tell just by looking because the diff is has so many whitespace/line ending changes. From the looks of it though he expects a file extension prefix (https://github.com/pansapien/mediaelement/commit/a4154854a780ae2dcc611816984c873206895f2b#L1R449) and also still assumes the file name is just everything following the last / which will still break with subfolders.\nI'll apply it on Monday and check it out. If it doesn't work I'll fork and submit a patch sometime Monday. I'll have access to Flash by then so I'll be able to properly test. \nThere's unfortunately no way to \"parse\" an RTMP url because it doesn't have to have the extension prefix (mp4:). This is why I think it's necessary to define a streamer, which I'll add in my patch.\n. How about a url without the prefix, like: rtmp://s3etkigca2rtc6.cloudfront.net/cfx/st/huntingtonbeach/files/2012/09/20120909_huntingtonbeach_message.mp4\nBoth are acceptable AFAIK though the prefix is preferred.\n. Okay, so I take back my previous comment. The prefix is indeed required except for flv files. I figure using FLVs with mediaelement.js is an edge case (could be wrong), so guessing the streamer based on the mp4: prefix would work.\n@johndyer I think https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/pull/574 will work for everything except for non-prefixed flv files. Please merge when you have a moment :D\n. @chrismjones Unfortunately @pansapien's patch only applies to video. Some copying and pasting (or some class extending putting parseRTMP on a class to be extended by both the video and audio elements) would fix this. The classes could probably benefit from a bit of abstraction but that could take some work.\nI wish I still owned a copy of Flash so that I could contribute. Le sigh.\n. @cgrube It does not, as per my comment before this one.\n. Awesome, thanks for the hard work John and everyone :D\n. ",

Our custom flash player plays back the RTMP URL above no problem. The Media Elements flash fallback player chokes on this URL. I can see the request in the FMS access logs and the application instance name is all wrong (it is \"definst/mp4:/data\"). \nThis appears to corroborate the parsing problem that jeremyharris points out above. If I move the video to the \"root\" directory of the application instance, Media Elements plays it back fine, for example, \nrtmp://someserver/video/definst/mp4:some_vid.mp4\nAnyone know if a fix has been release or if there is a known workaround?

Is that right? I am not able to get that working at all (regardless of location of MP3) while progressive download of the same physical file works. (See my longer post at johndyer/mediaelement#574)\n. Hi, \nI am testing these changes to verify support for mp3 and mp4 RTMP streaming using the fallback flash player. It looks like this does correct the issue where RTMP URLs were being parsed incorrectly when the source video is located in a subdir of the FMS application dir. \nHowever, I am not able to get streaming of MP3 using RTMP to work in any case. Progressive download works fine with a tag like . . . \n<audio id=\"player1\"  width=\"400\" height=\"364\" controls=\"controls\" preload=\"none\" src=\"http://pso71-ora2/video/28_Wheels_on_the_Bus.mp3\" type=\"audio/mp3\"> \nSo this is progressive download from a IIS web server over port 80. I have an FMS application pointing to the same physical location on the server, yet the following audio tag fails to playback the mp3 . . . \n<audio id=\"player1\"  width=\"400\" height=\"364\" controls=\"controls\" preload=\"none\" src=\"rtmp://pso71-ora2/video/_definst_/mp3:28_Wheels_on_the_Bus.mp3\" type=\"audio/mp3\">\nIn the case of the mediaelements flash player, the player loads and presents controls but pressing the play button results in nothing. The request never makes it to FMS. \nI have a tried URLS both with and without the\"mp3:\" marker and neither seem to work. I also have a separate web application with a custom embedded flash player that can successfully playback the mp3 at the above URL so I am confident that FMS is can receive and respond to the RTMP request. \n@Pansapien, you explicitly mention mp3 above. Does this mean you have been able to playback an mp3 stream over RTMP using your modified version of the media elements flash player? If so can you provide an example of the audio tag you are using? Anything special I need to as far as player options to get this to work?\nThanks, Chad.\n. ",

Is there any way to solve this issue?\n. thanks for that. is there no way to solve it within medialement.js? i think i have done same things with other flash media players and it was no problem there\n. ok thats NOT solving my problem! i have set all the divs where the players are initialized to be initially visible and i get the same error\n. ok solved it after research. now i know i have to initialize the player with var player = new MediaElementPlayer and not the jquery solution its a little bit confusing and not realy well documented @johndyer isnt it possible to bind the MediaElementPlayer object into data if jquery initialization is used? so you can use jquery initialization (not new MediaElementPlayer) and control the player width $(elementThePlayerIsInitializedOn).data(\"mediaElement\").pause(); for example. this would be a very nice solution in my eyes.\n. i reported this issue a few weeks ago :( its still there. hope we ll see a fix soon\n. thats not a realy good idea because that means to switch between html5 player (in in-website view) and if the user toggles fullscreen and the browser does not support html5 fullscreen to switch to flash player. this would be realy bad because the video has to be loaded again from beginning.\n. but that means a html5 browser with no native full screen support will ever get the flash variant. even if the user is not triggering fullscreen mode. not a realy good solution too i think\n. you can detect this fullscreen feature yourselfe and initialize medialement.js with flash (no html5) for this browsers and in \"normal\" mode for all other browsers\n. i can confirm this bug!\n. thats not possible. youtube want that people see were the video is hosted. so no way to remove it\n. this issue was reported multiple times. no fix until now :(\nthere is another issue with fullscreen mode if you have multiple players in your site with multiple sizes and you go fullscreen and back in one player all players are resized to the same width/height :(\n.

Myself and a co-worker are currently working on a story to improve accessibility of the player. We have made the basic control set accessible and our work can be found on this fork https://github.com/rylan/mediaelement/tree/accessibility . Once it finishes going through testing, I will turn it into a pull request. \nCheers,\nRylan\n. Hi Nick, \nIt's my bad, I let my branch get pretty far out of date with master. I got side track by another project. All the controls in my branch are fully accessible. I have some time this weekend, I will work on getting the accessibility features in a set they can be merged with the main line. \nCheers,\nRylan\n. did you set allowfullscreen=\"true\" on the iframe?  https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe \n. Do you have a test page or fiddle I can hit?  Is it still a problem in the latest version of chrome browser? This could also just be a case where it has not been implemented in the mobile version of chrome, I know they are still not at feature parity with the desktop. With a test page I can also pass it over to the chrome mobile team to take a look. \nAlso your fullscreen attributes should have a value, ie, allowfullscreen=\"true\" , if the mobile version of chrome is following the w3c spec, it should resolve to false without the value. \n. @TedAvery What version of IE8 are you running? I just tested on ver 8.0.7601.17514 with flash 12 and everything works fine. \n. @clkao Updated pull request. \n. I am going to close this pull request for now as we have found a couple cases where screen readers are not behaving as we would like. I will resubmit once we have a fix for those cases, which should hopefully allow us to also include our work on Captions and subtitles as well. \n.

Hi Nick,\nI was just testing your changes using NVDA and FireFox and your changes are not being pick up by the reader. What screen reader and browser combo are you using to test your a11y changes? \nChanging the span to anchor  vs using a tabindex in this case tends to work better, because readers will sometimes miss nested spans with index. Also your solution doesn't work in the case where the controls become hidden, the slider is in accessible. \nIf you take a look at my pull request you will see very similar changes to yours, but I fixed the case when the controls disappear, using an anchor and also added descriptive text to example how to use the slider.  https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/pull/1292 \nCheers,\nRylan\n. \u200eThere is a corresponding change in the css, if they didn't update the css correctly, the rail will not shoe up.

    "evanhuntley": "FWIW, I figured out the following when using mediaelement and needing to make an app keyboard navigable:\nIf you use 'enableKeyboard: false' you can disable the default binding of the up/down keys to the volume slider, but you then are able to use these keys when tabbing through the playhead in order to enable closed captioning.\nVolume is still accessible by tabbing to that specific slider element and using up/down there.  The only undesirable is that you lose the spacebar pausing the video, but I was able to write my own event for that elsewhere in my own application so that that worked, too.\nMore of a workaround, but I thought I'd share.\n. Thanks John - I was able to achieve for now by extending the prototype (carefully), but definitely something I would suggest for a future iteration.  I was working on a full screen skin (similar to the Amazon Prime streaming player) and needed to control this.\n. Same issue here!  I'm working on a full-screen skin, using the mejs-controls div as an overlay for the whole screen.  It actually works great, except for this same symptom in IE9 and IE10 - once you use that main play/pause button, the controls try to hide but keep coming back.\n. No, testing it via Browserstack.  Need a screen recording?\n. @marmite22 I reviewed this, and it's definitely much better in terms of enabling closed captioning.   \nThe one thing I noticed that is left over from the prior version is that the up/down arrows are still bound to the volume controls to begin with, which produces a few effects\n- The up and down arrows control volume wherever you are focused in the player except the closed captioning controls\n- You can actually be focused on other unrelated items in the player (e.g. screen size toggle) and still use the up/down arrow keys to toggle the volume.\n- I expect that when I focus the playback speed control, that the up/down keys would toggle those items - but I am unable to interact with those speeds via the keyboard at all, and when I use the up/down keys here the volume is toggled once again.\nIn both cases I think there is some potential for confusion - I would suggest unbinding those keys until the user is focused on the volume control itself, so that as the user focuses each control in the playbar, the up/down keys toggle things as appropriate.\n.

The code causing this error (IE8/Win7) in my case is as follows:\njavascript\n   mejs.players[mejsInstance].play();\n. +1\n. This is still problematic (player version 2.14.1). I encountered this problem in the stock browser on Galaxy S3 (Android 4.3), Galaxy Note 2 (Android 4.3) and Galaxy Tab 2 (7\", Android 4.1.1). Right now I am still searching for the cause. If you look at the \"events\" demo page, you see that the player pauses immediately after it started playing.\n. Same here. When the video is playing (tested in IE8) and I hover over the fullscreen button, there appears a flash layer saying \"Go fullscreen\". If you click that, you're actually entering fullscreen mode. But it's hard to find though. I'm investigating possibilities to work around this. Unfortunately this may involve changing the flash player.\n. After investigating the problem a little more I discovered, that there might be a new problem. When I visit  http://mediaelementjs.com/examples/?name=backlight in IE8 the flash layer \"Go fullscreen\" appears immediately after hovering over the fullscreen icon. Even if the video hasn't been startet yet. That's the desired behavior. If I try the same thing with the player on the homepage http://mediaelementjs.com/ it only shows up after starting the video. Until now I couldn't figure out the difference.\n. After some mire investigation I found out what causes the bug:\nmejs sets the video currentTime back to 0 when ended is fired. The Android stock browser starts seeking but never stops it by firing seeked in that case, so the functions bound to seeked including hiding the loading animation don't get executed.\nI fixed this behavior by setting a timeout after ended gets fired which removes the loading animation after 20ms. Enhancements are welcome :)\nI will make a pull request for this.\n. ",

I posted a message to the mailing list to discuss this issue:\nhttps://groups.google.com/d/topic/mediaelementjs/kmMCIydI614/discussion\n. @flamadiddle Save the reference to the MediaElementPlayer when you create it:\nvar player = new MediaElementPlayer('#player1', {\n          enableAutosize: false,\n            success: function(mediaElement, domObject) {\n                element = mediaElement;\n                domElem = domObject;\n    }\n});\nthen call:\nplayer.remove();\nRemember, the API supports multiple players on one page.\n. @odnamrataizem I was afraid of that.  I haven't tested with the merged code yet.\n. 'feature' is not defined so it is created in the global scope.\n. I'm not sure if cloning and removing the node like this is a good idea.  Code outside of MEJS might have a reference to the node and find the reference suddenly invalid.  This actually broke my Jasmine test, for example.\nAnother issue is that by cloning before removing, if there is an id attribute on the element, there can temporarily be duplicate ids.  This might be pedantic, but there could be situations where this would cause a problem (especially in an XHTML document.)\n. ",

The 3.x branch is also missing silverlight. Is this correct? Console also said that the code is wrong. Doesn't work like this in jQuery 3 anymore. Changed back to jQuery 2 still not working. Changed the target div-id from #player2 to #audio-player but same result. It doesn't start.\nTake a look here: https://thgfm.de/test\n. Yeah, thats working now. We're getting closer to a solution. It removes the Audio src now on \"pause\" but it seems that it doesn't load with the empty source. If you hit play again it starts playing but not the live feed instead it takes the buffered feed that still got saved and no new src is set.\n. difficult to test. every classes have wrong names in the latest release. So instead of 'mejs-container' it's 'mejs__container'. I think this is a fail.\n. ah well okay.

    "albell": "Big +1. IMHO this is by far the biggest limitation here going forward. Opus 1.1 came out around a month ago. It's much improved. It's also the standard for webRTC. VLC already supports Opus, and it's coming to Audacity. There's a command-line encoding tool that's pretty easy to use. I would ideally like to write opus-in-ogv first in the audio/video  stack, with an MP3 fallback. FF and Chrome support is solid. (Caniuse is wrong about the timing of Chrome and Opera support, but you get the idea.) In terms of fallback support, we're really only talking about mobile and IE (new and old) at this point. This is a good idea because: open standard, royalty-free, lower bandwidth, and better sound. A ton of work by both engineers and standards bodies has gone into getting getting Opus this far, it's getting to be time for developers to finish the job. Mass adoption as a default src by developers would probably help drive future support.\n. +1. This is really useful for webpack based workflows.. Should a replay button go in the bottom left of the control bar a la current Youtube, or superimposed over the video? Youtube uses the main space now to signal the next video slated to play. Similar to Vimeo \"up next\". But Vimeo still also puts a replay button as an overlay. Thoughts?. @johndyer file type nit: Could bigplay.png be an svg? I would really like to steer towards all-vector images if possible, for reasons of file size but also for resolution-independence. My understanding is the project is assuming support for svg-as-img as of v3.0.. Got it. Thx. Okay, great. We should probably converge on some core principles prior to any overhaul. Here is the approach I suggest:\n1.  Every element gets an class, prefixed by \u2018mejs\u2019. This allows it to be targeted directly, atomically. This is done fairly well already, but it\u2019s not entirely consistent across the stylesheet. E.g. you have the six-selector monster:\n.mejs-controls .mejs-captions-button .mejs-captions-selector ul li label {\n   }\n2. Selector depth should never go higher than two. This should be adequate to handle special modes/states like fullscreen. I might be wrong about this. Please advise. Certainly no more than three, I would hope.\n3. Don't use element selectors, ever. There's no reason to. They invite collision when used individually, and create specificity creep when used contextually.\n4. Don\u2019t use descendant selectors (a space) where child selectors (>) will work. Their meaning is clearer, they are more self-documenting, and they also execute very slightly faster, because the engine doesn\u2019t have to crawl up the entire DOM tree looking for matches on the first selector. The engine only has to look at the second selector\u2019s parent. Minor point here, but a best practice.\n5. Selector specificity should only increase towards the end of the stylesheet, to the extent possible. This avoids the escalation of specificity that\u2019s currently occurring. If you made a graph of specificity versus line number in the stylesheet, there should be a flat plane or gently inclined plane, with perhaps a bump at the end, instead of a spiky series of mountains.\n6. Assume all devices are touch devices. Don\u2019t try to detect touch on the client. That approach is more or less doomed to fail in multiple ways. For background on this check out the old Modernizr thread on this, or this. The main implication of this is that touch targets are currently way too small. Youtube player buttons are 37px tall. The Vimeo play button is a hulking 65px by 40px. The current mejs play button is a measly 16x16. I suggest a control bar button height of 40px. I would say 36px tall at the very least.\n7. Use inline SVG for all icons. Inline SVG greatly increase styling flexibility. Allow passing options that will dynamically insert SVG icon markup, with a nice looking default similar to current. This requires IE9+, which I think makes sense for a next major release.\n8. Don\u2019t use image sprites. Inline SVG makes the request they save unnecessary. Also, HTTP2 generally makes them an anti pattern, because the user is downloading image assets he/she may never need to see: https://blog.newrelic.com/2016/02/09/http2-best-practices-web-performance/\n9. Use modifier classes to style a change on an element. I like BEM double hyphens. So instead of:\n   mejs-playpause-button and mejs-pause. You would have mejs-playpause-button and mejs-playpause-button--pause. A modifier class only gets applied to an element that already has its \"base\" class. The modifier approach is more robust because it's more scoped. It makes it very clear what is being applied to what, and avoids the clever-but-brittle situation where classes are doing double-duty in different places on the stylesheet.\nPlease feed back, and if we can agree on an approach I will look at putting together a PR.\n. Ok, cool. Do you have a roadmap or summary of any other changes in 3.* that it might be useful to be aware of?\n. Thanks, I hope to submit a working PR in a week or so.\n. I'm pro-inline-SVG and anti-sprite. Sprites are more inflexible when a developer wants to effect a subtle tweak, like making a button icon slightly larger or smaller, darker or lighter, because the background-positions all need to be recalculated in a very non-obvious fashion. The editability and style-ability are both poorer developer experiences. A sprite is also an extra HTTP request in HTTP1. Theme developers can still easily override inline svg just by display:none-ing it in their custom theme stylesheets, and supplying their own background-images to the buttons. I don't even know that there needs to be a special step in the build process. Just define the inline svg strings as variables at the top of the script, and insert them into the DOM when and where appropriate.\nWith respect to script weight, the SVG path descriptions are literally a handful of bytes. We're talking about a few triangles and rounded rectangles, and some simple three-point curves. The overhead is very minimal. Developers who are changing the default icons, and really worried about such micro-optimizations can edit them in place in the src, if they don't like overriding them.\nI'm also in the camp of don't use IDs for styling, especially for reusable components that may appear multiple times on a single page. All classes, all the time!\nI would like to be sure we're on the same page before I dive in here. \n. @ron666 I have put together a working branch with most of these changes. I have mostly changed class names, and added them to elements where they did not exist. I renamed \"offscreen\" to \"screen-reader-only\", because I think it's more semantic. (I think of \"offscreen\" as something that's about to slide in from the edge of the viewport.)\nI also reduced the length of some very long lines. And my editor automatically trims trailing whitespace. In order to find and spot my own typos, I added grunt-jshint, and linted the player script src. This threw up numerous errors unconnected to my changes, which i also fixed, just in order to be able to pass jshint and compile.\nAll of this is to say that the diff is more complex than I would normally like, and I wouldn't be surprised if I've inadvertently broken something. Can this be reviewed for a possible PR? If you can walk me through your testing process that would also be helpful.\n. Oops, sorry, must have been a typo. Here in the bem-naming branch:\nhttps://github.com/albell/mediaelement/tree/bem-naming\n. Thanks, I will revisit this in a couple days when I have time. In general, are you receptive to adding jshint to the project? I find linting really useful, esp for collaborative work.\n. Yes, closing now.\n. I support this move to ES6, but I think there are much more pressing issues for a 3.x release, including getting some kind of linting working on all source files. This is essential for basic contribution checks. The big question is whether to add jshint into the current build (as I have done in my branch just in order to be able to spot my own errors, and check my work) or to leap forward to ESLINT, which is has very opinionated defaults. If you run ESLINT on the current codebase you will probably see over a thousand errors. There's a lot of old code here, and it doesn't all have tests. Moving to ESLINT means a complete stylistic rewrite, and will need to be very carefully checked by someone with a deep understanding of the project. \n. I think this change would be compatible with any existing or future theme. It wouldn't change any class names. @johndyer can you advise on this?\n. Digging a bit more, In tandem with this, I think we should just rip out setControlsSize completely. The logic there is really tortured and the while loop on the railwidth has noticeably bad performance. If I'm not mistaken, all the layout math done here can be done both faster and with greater flexibility using CSS calc().\n. Personally, I'm fine with gulp or grunt. Either way. They're pretty similar. But if we're going to switch, it needs to be all the way, meaning clean out all of grunt from the package.json, etc.\nI haven't used stylelint recently. I tried it several months ago and kept hitting bugs when trying to customize rules. I am currently still using scss-lint, which is dependent on Ruby, but absolutely rock-solid. Any real-world feedback on style-lint? Is it ready? I see an awful lot of issues.\nLastly, any SCSS style checking needs to be part of the gulp task, and not a separate npm script, otherwise contributors will inevitably miss it.\nIn general, this is a lot of changes to process at once. I prefer a more granular commit style wherever possible. @ron666 is this currently being reworked for possible merge? I'd like to contribute here but can't quite figure out where this is at overall.\n. @yoime @ron666 Can we have a higher-level discussion about the decision to use SASS/SCSS?\nHere are the advantages of SCSS as I see them:\n1. Variables. BUT... We don't really need them urgently for a base theme, and they could alternatively be written ass CSS variables, in a standards-based fashion.\n2. Loops. Don't need them here.\n3. An idiomatic nesting syntax. BUT... This is arguably more of a disadvantage than an advantage, because the commonplace patterns encourage selector specificity creep, instead of atomic selectors.\n4. A good community and node-sass, a fast compiler. No argument here.\nHere are some additional problems with SCSS:\nA. It's a transitional technology. SCSS will be mostly obsolete a few years, except for exceptionally complicated stylesheets. This is because its core features have come to native CSS. Investment in learning the quirks of SCSS has a narrow time window of utility, mostly because it's not standards-based.\nB. Not everyone uses or understands it. It erects another hurdle for beginners.\nC. It's a permanent dependency, and thus slightly hard to refactor. With pure native CSS and PostCSS, you can just drop the compilation step in the future when browser support for CSS vars improves. It's more future forward.\nPlease don't get me wrong. I write SCSS all day, every day. It's part of the standard workflow where I work, etc. I just think if you're going to opt for a CSS compilation step for this project it might make sense to consider a standards-based PostCSS workflow as described here or here.\nAlso, I think we should try to keep the CSS compilation question separate from the question of ES6 in the branch/commit history.\n. @yoime I'm curious: can you give me an example of a SCSS snippet 'before' and 'after' compilation that is in some way simpler or clearer than using native CSS vars and postCSS? The concepts involved are very similar. You're extracting certain values into variables and reusing them. The main difference I see here is that a PostCSS workflow is standards-based, and SCSS is not.\n. I am out all day. Deadlines. I can do tmrw. Or you can just commit similar?\n. Ok, I deleted the selector in question. Please merge and I will make another pass. Also, the test directory has many files in it now. Can you advise on what is current, and/or things to look out for? \n. Are you waiting for me to make changes to the branch?\nIs it better if I just never ever commit anything to the build folder? Or can you accept the changes and resolve the conflicts in build using your versions, and just rebuild? I know you want to push ahead on this...\n. LGTM. This is a great improvement! And agreed about testing. I would suggest a freeze period for browser testing once there is a release candidate but it sounds like you're not there yet. Putting tests on a public server might also help with getting eyes on it?\n. +1 for a beta. Bugs come out. You could put a call for testers at the top of the readme? In my experience that works well. I would like to squeeze in a few more style changes before release if possible. I can't focus on this until Sunday though. Will test then also.\n. LGTM. One nit: you might not need the extra container selector in the CSS. I was trying to move the code away from that sort of thing. You could probably also scope the selector to button and anchor elements. Star selector is relatively slow, esp on large pages.. Good catch about the slider. Three little things:\n\nUse a single modifier class that only ever gets added to the container. This is BEM convention stuff.\nApply the class both with and without the :focus pseudo. This solves some old compat issues.\nUse 0 instead of none for better compat with ancient browsers.\n\nPutting that all together:\n.mejs__container--keyboard-inactive a,\n.mejs__container--keyboard-inactive a:focus,\n.mejs__container--keyboard-inactive button,\n.mejs__container--keyboard-inactive button:focus,\n.mejs__container--keyboard-inactive [role=slider],\n.mejs__container--keyboard-inactive [role=slider]:focus {\n    outline: 0;\n}\nthx. > I'll need to prepend in all the rules .mejs-container, otherwise the change of focus won't be caught up.\nWait, why? If .mejs__container--keyboard-inactive is only ever added/removed from .mejs__container then you don't need a compound parent selector. The above should work. CSS outline isn't set anywhere else, I don't think, so you don't need the increase in specificity for an override. Am I missing something?. Yeah that's because of the current cascade sequence, which is creating unnecessary specificity wars.\nCurrent you have at line 23:\n.mejs-container.mejs__container--keyboard-inactive a,\n.mejs-container.mejs__container--keyboard-inactive a:focus,\n.mejs-container.mejs__container--keyboard-inactive button,\n.mejs-container.mejs__container--keyboard-inactive button:focus,\n.mejs-container.mejs__container--keyboard-inactive [role=slider],\n.mejs-container.mejs__container--keyboard-inactive [role=slider]:focus {\n    outline: 0;\n}\nand then on line 211:\n.mejs-button > button:focus {\n    outline: dotted 1px #999;\n}\nThe .mejs-container class in the first declaration is only necessary as currently sequenced because it has to override the dotted style further down. If you group all the focus-outline-related styles together, and switch the order of these two blocks, you don't need any escalation of specificity. It's lighter and cleaner, easier to modify/customize. Basically you could just change it to something like this:\n```\n.mejs-button > button:focus {\n    outline: dotted 1px #999;\n}\n.mejs__container--keyboard-inactive a,\n.mejs__container--keyboard-inactive a:focus,\n.mejs__container--keyboard-inactive button,\n.mejs__container--keyboard-inactive button:focus,\n.mejs__container--keyboard-inactive [role=slider],\n.mejs__container--keyboard-inactive [role=slider]:focus {\n    outline: 0;\n}\n```\nI'm happy to get back into this stuff if I can get a green light on #1917.. From just browsing around quickly now, my understanding is that not rendering background images in HCM is an IE behavior. Edge renders bg images in HCM. @Pawluczkowycz what OS/browser is the screenshot above from?\nIt looks like there are two common solutions for this issue:\n- Use text instead of an image:\nhttps://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2012/08/notes-on-accessible-css-image-sprites/\n- Or use pseudo-elements for the images:\nhttp://www.ssbbartgroup.com/blog/css-background-images-and-accessibility/\nUnfortunately I don't have a PC, and I think this needs native testing. An emulator probably won't suffice.\n@Pawluczkowycz do you have experience with workarounds for this issue?\n. > I like the idea of using conventions, but I'm not sure it's a good idea here only because there are quite a few existing styles created off the mejs syntax.\nSure, can you give examples? In public repos or in the wild? This would help me understand the issue.\n\nThis would be a major breaking change for 2.x -> 3.0 upgraders.\n\nYeah, it's a breaking change. I do appreciate the goal of easy, drop-in updates. But isn't that an argument for doing it now with 3.0 as opposed to a later point release? Developers should really expect to have to test following a major release update. That's the beauty of semver, right? At any rate, the necessary style changes here can be done with a quick grep.\nI see this change as part of the general overhaul I proposed at #1849. Lots of the things I suggested there, including this BEM convention, and modifier classes instead of free-floating utility classes are breaking changes. I'm see this as working towards an general overhaul of the available theming. This includes better touch target sizing, better high contrast mode functionality, better accessibility, better focus outline styling, and easier custom styling in general.\nIs absolute backwards compatibility with 2.* a goal of the 3.0 release? My understanding from #1849 was that it wasn't. I think it's important for things to be able to evolve between major releases.\n@johndyer please let me know your thoughts.\n. > Probably the biggest concern on this is that MediaElement is used in Wordpress and a variety of themes and plugins have popped up around it which customize ME.js's CSS. For example, all the sub themes at http://audiotheme.com/ rely on those classes. My worry is that if Wordpress tries to upgrade to 3.x, it will break all those dependencies.\nMakes sense. But just looking at that one example, It looks like the themes at audiotheme actually use their own unprefixed class structure. So on a page like:\nhttps://demo.audiotheme.com/marquee/\nyou have the play button markup:\n<button class=\"site-play-pause-button play\">Play</button>\nwhich is something else entirely. They've anonymized the class names. No mejs- at all, so no conflict there. BTW, I think that kind of loosey-goosey class naming structure should be actively discouraged because a class like \"play\" is so collision-prone. \"Worst-practice\", AFAIAC.\n\nI agree with #1849 that reducing some of the complexity of the selectors would make theming easier and less bloated.\n\nCool, yeah. That work is already 95% done, in #1890 and #1909.\n\nI'll reach out to some of those theme developers to see if any of them can weigh in on the changes.\n\nGreat, let me know what you hear. FWIW I see this as a small step back in preparation for a big leap forward in terms of theming flexibility.\n. Hey @johndyer  just wanted to check back in on this. Was the decision made to keep this commit then? I'm hoping to get a green light for going ahead on other issues with respect to tolerance for breaking changes (esp class naming) for 3.0.\n. I really like this idea of the class prefix convention being a configurable setting in options, with a default BEM-style value of 'mejs__'. It makes it very easy to work around any naming collisions. Wordpress can then call it by default in classic mode by passing in classPrefix: 'mejs-', which will be compatible with the old selectors. People who want to update to the latest (upcoming!) themes will probably want to remove that option.. @ron666 Yes I can. @johndyer are you on board with this approach? I don't want to go take the time and effort to through this entire process all over again if there's are outstanding fundamental issues about the approach. Is everyone agreed on the conventions & approach described above?. @ron666 Ok, thanks for the heads up.\nI am working on this. It is going to be a large commit, touching dozens of files. If you could keep the merges quiet for a little while I would appreciate it.. sorry, where are the code comments?\n\nI'd also be tempted to include the \"classic\" classes inside the stylesheets so we have full backward compatibility.\n\nYikes, I'd really like to avoid this scenario. Bloat! Maybe we could include the legacy stylesheet with a very clear \"legacy\" string in the file name to scare people off it.\nAFAICT the cases to support are:\n\npeople updating from 2.*, who want to continue using an old theme, and can't/don't want to update their markup.\npeople updating from 2.*, who want to use a new theme, and willing to change markup conventions.\npeople starting out fresh with 3.*, who want to start fresh new themes.\n\nI'd like to minimize breakage, but I don't think absolute lock-in between major versions is a fair prospect. Are there other scenarios to consider?. @ocean90 Sorry, somehow I missed the feature-ads.js file. I will not have time to sit down with this until the weekend. @ron666 If you just want to make the changes I'm fine with that, depending on your timeframe.\nAbout templating: agreed that all this string concat is painful to read and maintain. I think the real solution to cleaning up the templating is moving to ES6 template strings. As I understand it, that is on the agenda for an ES6 rewrite once v3 is released. I think that would be one of the biggest wins of moving onto a transpiler.. @ron666 SGTM, thank you!. Yes, good call. Please add.\nAlso, separately, could you hook up the <track> tag in the latest alpha html test page? Would be great to always confirm captions are working in the full player. Since the SRT is probably very lightweight this should maybe just be part of the repo, for testing?\n. ",

You mentioned there are differences between how it fires for html 5 versus flash/silverlight.  I am testing on Chrome and Firefox, so could this be part of my problem?\nAgain, thank you very much!\n. To close this ticket out, I'd like to offer my solution:\nI ended up using your example, John, and re-implementing it to offer a little more precision.\n``` javascript\nvar _lastTime = 0;\nmediaElement.addEventListener('playing', function (e) {\n    interval = setInterval(function () {\n        var currentTime = mediaElement.currentTime;\n    if (!isNaN(currentTime) && currentTime > 0) {\n        for (var j = stopPoints.length - 1; j >= 0; j--) {\n            var cueTime = stopPoints[j];\n            if (cueTime >= _lastTime && cueTime <= currentTime) {\n                mediaElement.player.pause();\n                pauseOnStopPoint = true;\n            }\n        }\n        _lastTime = currentTime;\n    }\n}, 50);\n\n}, false);\n```\nBy adding the check to a 'playing' event listener, wrapped in a setInterval, I was able to get the precision down to 50ms.

    "brothercake": "I can confirm this problem still occurs in MediaElement 2.15.1 and Safari 7 on Mac OS 10.9. (I'm using only mediaelement.js, not the player.)\nIf you only need to resize a non-fullscreen video (eg. for responsive layout) then setVideoSize works correctly if you delay its call with a 10ms timeout (ie. 10ms after the window resize event).\nHowever if the \"me-plugin\" element is inside another container which has been made fullscreen using webkitRequestFullScreen, then setVideoSize resizes me-plugin and resizes the EMBED element, but does not resize the flash video itself -- the video content remains the same size, in the top-left corner of the resized embed.  And then once you exit fullscreen and call setVideoSize again to restore the original size, this time you get the opposite effect -- the video content is now the size of the whole screen and you can only see the top-left portion of it.\n. A similair behaviour also occurs in Opera and Firefox for OSX when using non-flash youtube -- ie. when the youtube iframe is used for browsers that don't support flash -- and in this case, using setVideoSize in fullscreen mode does not change the size of the iframe.\n. Not sure if you're referring to the same thing, but I hacked the copy of mediaelement.js I'm using so that it would use the iframe for everyone, and I did notice that setVideoSize doesn't resize the video to fill the screen. However that can be fixed by setting width and height on the iframe element so it matches screen.width and height.\n. n.b. I also extended playerVars to get rid of annotations and post-roll content, since they can create a keyboard trap (and are generally annoying imo).

Sorry, can't tell you as I'm still running an older version with my modification as described above.  If John fixed the Flash app not to send so many progress events then I guess it's ok now.\n. Constant: 128kbps\nEncoded with LAME ... standard settings, just -b 128\n. Thanks for the suggestion.  It's not really an easy option for us to rebuild and retag all the mp3s as there are a lot of them and they're large.  We used standard, up to date tools to create the files, so I don't think there should be a problem.\n\nThe mp3s were all created with lame -b 128\nAnd then tagged with Mp3tag\nThey do have image data

Hi John,\nIf it's the case that the Flash plugin will always report an inaccurate duration while the mp3 is loading, then surely it should not override the \"duration\" parameter passed when initialising mediaelement.\nIn my use case, I am parsing the audio length server-side from the ID3 tag, and then pass it as in the duration parameter - but this is only displayed until loading/playing is started.\nCheers,\nSeb\n.

This is a change to the spec, I think for good reason, to consider any string that doesn't start with a '<' as a selector instead of an HTML string.\nYou can test this by doing something like:\n``` javascript\n// this will silently fail (at least, 1.9+ didn't out put any exception/error)\nconsole.log($('  |   ')); \n// this will work fine after commenting out the line above\nconsole.log($(' |   '));\n```\nLink to change in spec: http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#jquery-htmlstring-versus-jquery-selectorstring\nYou can fix by either using the jquery-migrate plugin as specified, or updating the mediaelement-and-player.js file (version 2.11.3) by changing line 3312 to:\njavascript\n        timeAndDurationSeparator: '<span> | </span>'\nYou could also add a style or id to that span definition, so you an style the spacing via CSS instead of using string spaces.\n.

Without wanting to step on any toes, it might make more sense to merge that into the current master, and deal with code style (line endings, tabs vs. spaces) as a separate PR if necessary.\nOur project has depended on the flex_build branch for some time now, and it would be great to get it merged so that we can start submitting some of our own mediaelement fixes/enhancements without having to cherry-pick around the flex stuff.\n.

    "dantaylor": "Hello All,\nWe are using mediaelement in a project that initializes a global object that stores a reference of the created video player, then we have an ajax action injecting another piece of content and there is a method that calls the global referenced player and invokes the .remove() successfully. Eg. I can go to my console and enter mejs.players and get an empty object as expected {}. However  we are still seeing a memory leak issue. Further investigation of the issue with chrome tools reveals that there is at least 1 or two events that dont go away from the mediaelement-and-player.js file and as a result they keep the entire video file size in memory, so after a few videos the browser quickly gets pretty big.. and gc never takes place. I am attaching the memory heap snapshot file created by chrome.. which hopefully can help into solving this. Also attached is a screenshot of the issue.\n\n\nPlease let me know if I can help getting anything else..

Just sayin' :) . Sure!\nSure :)\nTo reproduced the error I've simply added logs to the compiled mediaelement.js lib.\nHere is the log I've added to mediaelement.js:\nhttps://gist.github.com/bricev/ab0e74dd0745245f67088e69099582e0/05ecacacafa28ec3ee995ed45d76055334d93991\nThis is what I've got in my client console:\n\nThen I added my fix:\nhttps://gist.github.com/bricev/ab0e74dd0745245f67088e69099582e0/revisions#diff-47f8f92358f2bf2449d26d24a499ad0f\nAnd here is the console:\n\nI really do think t.mediaElement.dispatchEvent is called a lot because of the fact we added a lot  of events to our  element (at least more than average). It seems that at some point var il that save the array length in memory is not corresponding to the actual length of the callbacks  array for loop is executing. \nStrangely, in my fix (second screenshot) you can see that var il is equal to 9. \nAs this var is not set anymore in the function, I have no idea where it comes from :s\nBut at this point I have no more error!. Ok I understand what you are doing.\nI'm (very) sorry to disappoint but the bug is still there :/\nI doubled checked and re-entered my logs in the code coming from your last push.\nResult is the same.\nI keep thinking that t.mediaElement.dispatchEvent is called multiples time in a same fraction of seconds (which I do see from my client console). Therefore, each call is executed asynchronously by JavaScript. \nNow I don't get how vars such as _i3 and _total3 are mixed at some point but my logs are clear : the loop pointer responds to a faulty condition where the item count does not correspond to the parsed array.\nAt least by checking to total items right from the array/object itself each time JS iterates from the loop, you are sure you work on the good instance of the array/object. But again, I'm no JS guru and you surely have a better expertise in that field ;) . I've updated my app and the bug is gone.\nThank you so much!! . Sorry Rafael, my bad!! Value for preload is none.\nhtml\n<video class=\"player\" poster=\"/path/to/poster.jpg\" preload=\"none\" controls><!-- [...] --></video>\nAnd I need it to keep this value.. Here is a demo link:\nhttps://developers.libcast.com/player/flv.html\nThe native HTML5 player works like a charm.

I think it's not really about the certs (assuming they're installed correctly and trusted by your browser), but more about whether the browser uses an imbedded media player (like chrome) or an external one like Quicktime for Safari.

    "gavrochelegnou": "I can confirm i have the same issue with the last version of mediaelement on an Android 4.1.2 stock browser.\nWhen inspecting the code the result is the mediaelement tag having the same height and width values.\nFor example my video is 1920x1080 and my mediaelement tag has \"width:1920px;height:1920px\"\n. For information, the repo with the \"reference client implementation for the playback of MPEG DASH via JavaScript\" : \nhttps://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js\n. I don't know about silverlight, but there is a library for Actionscript  : \nhttps://github.com/castlabs/dashas\nAnother possible library for JS : \nhttps://github.com/google/shaka-player\n. I kind of agree with both of you :)\nPro Shim : \n- The point of mejs is to provide seamless fallback (although i would wonder if silverlight version is really used anywhere ?).\n  So having seamless DASH support with at least flash would be awesome :+1:\nCon Shim\n- Current server implementations (Adobe, ...) that include DASH (live or not) streaming already include RTMP/HLS fallback, which MeJs already support. So the fallback for people who wants DASH is most likely already included in their server side solution ...\n. This looks great ! Thanks a lot.\nRegarding the fallback I think that : \n- anyone with a pre-recorded video can use the mp4 file as a fallback.\n- anyone that uses MDash for live streaming can use HLS & RTMP as fallback, as all server side solutions that handles MpegDash also handles thoose two streaming protocol.\n. Wahoo !\nThanks a lot,  I will test that !\n. Thanks looks awesome !\nI tried different streams from http://dashif.org/reference/players/javascript/1.4.0/samples/dash-if-reference-player/\nSo far i noticed : \nWhen multiple sources are defined (like in the example mdash.html with mpd + m3u8) and that the mpd has subtitles, the subtitles are shown twice (some times 4 times during preload) \nExample stream with subtitles : http://irtdashreference-i.akamaihd.net/dash/live/901161/bfs/manifestARD.mpd\n\n\nWith IE10 and the flash fallback the subtitles are not displayed at all.\nOtherwise i tested so far on WIN10 : IE10/IE11/Edge/FF/Chrome\nAndroid : Chrome\nAwesome work !\n. Ok i will try to reproduce the problem with dash.js alone.\nFor the flash fallback it seems that subtitles are not working with dashas, we can use the webvtt for VOD videos but not for live videos. Not a frequent use case given the amount of work required to produce them but worth keeping in mind.\n. ",

For some reason, MP4 videos refuse to play; I was expecting it to fallback to the Flash Player.\nI'm no coder, but when I changed:\njs\nif (supportsMediaTag && (options.mode === 'auto' || options.mode === 'auto_plugin' || options.mode === 'native')  && !(mejs.MediaFeatures.isBustedNativeHTTPS && options.httpsBasicAuthSite === true)) {\nto\njs\nif (supportsMediaTag && (options.mode === 'auto' || options.mode === 'auto_plugin' || options.mode === 'native')  && !(mejs.MediaFeatures.isBustedNativeHTTPS || options.httpsBasicAuthSite === true)) {\nThen videos are able to be played in Chromium.\n.

    "DrewML": "I ran into this issue today, and looked into it a bit more.\nFrom what I can tell, this is being caused by an inconsistency between the way browsers process (or don't) the href property on DOM elements.\nIn me-utility.js, the following utility function exists:\njavascript\n    absolutizeUrl: function(url) {\n        var el = document.createElement('div');\n        el.innerHTML = '<a href=\"' + this.escapeHTML(url) + '\">x</a>';\n        return el.firstChild.href;\n    },\nNote that it relies on the href property, rather than the href attribute. In Firefox/Safari, the href property is uri-encoded by the browser prior to returning the value (this behavior does not happen in Chrome).\nI've created a small fiddle to show a small, reproducible test case. Note that the URI in the \"results\" frame is not encoded in Chrome, but is in Firefox/Safari.\nEventually, mediaelement.js passes this value into mejs.Utility.encodeUrl, which ends up encoding the already-encoded value in FF/Safari. Since the URI is now invalid, playing the video does not work.\nUnless I'm overlooking something, the fix for this may be as simple as changing el.firstChild.href to el.firstChild.getAttribute('href')\n. I should add that, according to the spec, an href attribute with a space in it is technically invalid\n\nMaybe the fix is to uri-encode the value prior to it being passed through absolutizeUrl.\n. ",

Thanks John.\n. I had a team member test our MediaElement code on two other laptops and it worked with IE 8.  Why this is interesting is because my team and I develop using identical virtual machine images of Windows 2008 R2 Server running IE 8.0.7601.17514.  The initial image did not include Flash so we installed it after the initial installation.  Accoriding to http://isflashinstalled.com/ we are all running this flash version: WIN 11,9,900,170.  However my image has the error and their's does not.  Since the machines are nearly identical I figured that perhaps Flash was the issue.  So I went to YouTube and noticed that the Flash ad at the top wasn't showing (screenshot).  When clicking on a video it would play for a few seconds then fail with the \"An error occurred, please try again later\" message (screenshot).  Please try this \"YouTube test\" to see if you're having the same problem.  I tried to fix the browser by following the instructions of multiple of links about it but none worked for me.  \nSo while I can't be 100% sure until you look into it, the problem seems to be a problem with the locally installed Flash plugin.  So I think that MediaElement should have some code to detect bad Flash versions.  Ideally it would display some sort of error message similar to YouTube so that it doesn't look like the problem is MediaElement.  What do you think?\n. This is just an update but we discovered why Flash wasn't working on Internet Explorer.  The operating system was \"Windows Server 2008 R2\" and it failed because the \"Windows Audio Service\" was not started.  I know what you're thinking.  This is the most utterly bizarre thing that you could think of that would hose Flash but it's true.  We found the issue on this page (pay-wall site) which said the following:\n\n\"... to solve our problem was to start the Windows Audio service and set it to auto start. Now Youtube works as it suppose to. \"\n. \n",

Hi @johndyer, happy new year to you and your family !\nany plan to merge this ? let me know in case you need some help or if you have any question.\nCheers,\nMangui\n. see what you will get after the PR ;-)\nhttp://streambox.fr/HLSProvider/mediaelement/demo/mediaelementplayer-hls.html\n. FYI i updated the demo HLS test page, both in the Pull Request and here http://streambox.fr/HLSProvider/mediaelement/demo/mediaelementplayer-hls.html\nit now contains a bunch of HLS test streams (VoD, live, adaptive, encrypted, AAC,  using various encoders ...)\nyou can also directly check with your own HLS stream directly from the test page.\n. Hi @johndyer, \ngreat news !\nindeed I dont see anything merged in johndyer/master ?\n. Hi @gregfr \nthe issue is that when compiling with mxmlc, all the sprites/frames/buttons/shapes/... are not linked in the swf\n*swf compiled with mxmlc\n\n*swf compiled with flashbuilder\n\nIt is easy to extract them, but we should find a way to include those additional datas using mxmlc.\nmaybe the following might help :\nhttp://help.adobe.com/en_US/flex/using/WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf69084-7f2d.html\n.

Hi @ale-grosselle just curious, which version of flashls is it ?\n. sure, while looking at MEJS hls.js config, it looks like autoStartLoad is set to true,\nsee description here : https://github.com/dailymotion/hls.js/blob/master/doc/API.md#autostartload\nyou might review that, and set it to false, then manually call hls.startLoad() when user presses play. I would say that, for live, you shouldn't set autoStartLoad to true.\nfor VoD, it might make sense in some cases.\nit is a bit similar to the video preload attribute. maybe you can do something like\nconfig.autoStartLoad = (video.preload === 'auto');. indeed..

Though it would clearly be needed, specially GPL licence is violated in mejs current state !\nWould you be ok to include external dependencies ?\nSuch as messageformat.js (MIT license), Yahoo FormatJS (BSD and custom licencse) or any other very light JS library providing good I18N ?\nI'm clearly not a specialist regarding dependency management on JS project... bower grunt npm are like bad words to me :) Also I think adding automatic build and test to the repo (travis-ci ?) would be required if doing such modification, but again, I'm no expert at it...\n. Nice improvement. ISO-639-1 is definitely too limited ! \nI have a separate pull request (#1310) with new I18Ned languages, they are all compatible with the new behavior. But I would prefer that existing chinese translation be renamed zh-Hant & zh-Hans rather than the existing and confusing zh / zh-CN respectively.\n. Hi @nfreear, my preference is to use the most up to date standard, that is BCP-47 (zh-hant/zh-hans), (aka IETF language tag), and not the simple and uncomplete ISO-639-x. \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag\nThat said : \n- for existing project I completely understand the use of ISO-639-x, as an example, the content management system Jalios JCMS which I maintain uses a mix of both for backward compatibility. \n- ISO-639 is a subset of BCP-47 so keeping existing language code is fine to me\n. I will provide those translations as soon as possible.\nAs a side note : using an english form as the \"key identifier\" of the translation method is probably a bad idea: \n- for correctness : a simple case mismatch in an i18n file and the label is not translated even though the translation is almost there...\n- for maintenance : if a very simple correction has to be made in english, without changing the meaning (for example a letter case, a plural, a typo), then ALL translation have to be updated\nIt would be much simpler to use unique identifier, for example : \nmejs.i18n.t(\"download-file\")\nmejs.i18n.t(\"download-video\")\n...\nand in the translation file : \n'download-file': 'Download File',\n  'download-video': 'Download Video',\nI have been using the following identifier internally at Jalios for the translation process of mejs : \n'mejs.play-pause'\n'mejs.none'\n'mejs.close'\n'mejs.download-file'\n'mejs.download-video'\n'mejs.captions-subtitles'\n'mejs.fullscreen'\n'mejs.fullscreen-on'\n'mejs.fullscreen-off'\n'mejs.mute'\n'mejs.mute-toggle'\n'mejs.unmute'\n. Ok John, thank you for your approval. I'll try to do this at the same time.\nAlso, note that impact of this approach is not only that you need to create the English ones, but also that you have to define a language as the default one (e.g. English) in case a property is not found in the current user language.\n. Thanks @ron666\nI'll be glad to update/redo this PR for the master, IF and ONY IF @johndyer confirms he is willing to merge it. Otherwise john, please close the issue with your arguments. \nJohn, as a kind and constructive comment, really not meant to be rude, as I know it's not an easy task to be an opensource maintainer. The following blog post contains some really good advices that I would really recommend : \nhttps://blog.jessfraz.com/post/the-art-of-closing/\nI try to apply those guidelines myself for our customers (though I admit with less complexity being a closed source project).\n. Looking at https://codex.wordpress.org/I18n_for_WordPress_Developers, this is clearly not the way they do things. They use the english as the source, not a generic identifier, though it seems to apply to PHP, maybe not for JavaScript.\nThe following pages contains many contact regarding the wordpress translation process\nhttps://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/teams/\nThe following developpers are identified in the above page as \"Polyglots team mentors\" maybe they will be able to comment on this PR and the potential impact in wordpress.\n@ocean90 @naokomc @chantalcoolsma @deconf @CoachBirgit,  any thoughts ? (see above PR and also #1352  )\n. My point of view (to argument why I think this PR is a more common approach for localization ) : \n- Being a Java developper, using the english as the source would not be a valid way to localize. Each strings is always identified by a unique identifier in resource bundle, the source code does not contain any \"default translation\" but the instead uses the identifier,\n- For MacOS X apps, Apple guidelines clearly follow the same principles : \n  https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPInternational/InternationalizingYourCode/InternationalizingYourCode.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000171i-CH4-SW1\n- And looking at Javasscript library https://github.com/fnando/i18n-js , they also use identifiers are the source of I18N strings .\n. I'm currenly trying to contact WordPress developpers through wordpress.slack.com to obtain comments on this issue. \nI'll keep you posted.\n. Thank you @grappler for reaching out. @swissspidy was commenting along the same lines on wordpress slack core-i18n channel.\n@johndyer Apparently it looks reassuring and this improvement could be made without introducing heavy work load for WordPress devs. \nIn order to be sure, I would suggest we wait for @ocean90 answer who is apparently the expert on that matter. If he confirms and you are still okay, I'll redo the PR without conflicts.\n. Thank you @chantalcoolsma. \nThe PR is more than a year old, it can wait a bit longer to ensure everyone is happy with the change :)\n. So do I. those are two really different problem.\n.

I'll also provide an updated sed script in order to ease migration.\nRegarding #1792, using IDs is not incompatible with fixing plurals (at a later time) by modying the format syntax being used for each translation property value.\n.

Regarding missing translations : \n- I just fixed the french one (in which I had also introduced a regression in my initial commit). \n- I'll send all the missing bits to our translators, and will be able to provide them propably in october. \nIn the meantime, here are some statistics regarding current transalation progress in files bundled in the repository (those stats are valid after my last commit). As you can see, only the english and french are fully translated.\n\n. @ron666 New translation added in last commit, which bring us to the following stats : \n\nGiven the low number of missing translation, and also because none are being bundled in the build ... Would you consider merging the PR now ? This would prevent potential PR conflict hard to resolve if I get the remaining translation long after other important commit in the master ...\n. It WILL break things. But @ocean90 is aware of it gave us his agreement in the following comment : https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/pull/1413#issuecomment-245542486\nThe next modification regarding I18N will be to properly implement plural/gender and such, to fix #1792 . However this modification will also require important decision on which format to use (ICU msg format ? other ) and how to implement it (rely on external project?). But I think this discussion does not belong in this PR.\n. Thank you @ron666 for your review and help with Git. \nWe (at Jalios) are glad to participate in this project which allows us to provide nice feature for our users.\n. Regarding the update of existing translation files to prevent use of a fallback : we do not have our own translators at Jalios, we rely on an external provider for this job. Because this service is quite expensive, but mainly due to the release cycle of our software, we only send the translation every 6/9 months or so. Unfortunately I already sent the previous strings to translation at the begining of the week... :( I'll see if I can request a modification with them and I'll keep you posted. \nBut you should really consider providing this fallback in the meantime... \n. Brazilian portuguese should indeed follow all other translation format. see #1872\n@odnamrataizem : you initially commited this pt-BR translation which is no longer up to date given the new strings that were introduced since your transalation. Could update your work starting from the english version please ?\n@ron666 reminder regarding 3strings vs 2 duly noted.\n. No comment I can think of for the moment. Thanks again for your work.\n. @ron666  I had not seen this modification (my apologies ... too much work here, not much time to properly review :/) \nIf I understand correctly, you expect the whole message/sentence (and not just each parameter) to be proposed in several variations ?\n- this is definitely not a standard I had seen (but again, I'm not an expert in I18N and properly management plurals for ALL languages is still a work to do for our translations at Jalios...) \n- it completely prevents the use of several parameters should you want to display a message like Playlist contains {0,no videos|one video|{0} videos} and {1,no sounds|one sound|{1} sounds}.\n- for very long message, this adds a lot of duplicated text in the JS file\n. @ron666 I'm fine with it. And it will definitely be simpler for translators (that would otherwise have to learn and understand complex syntax). How to do you insert a semicolons if you need one to be displayed to the end user ? (The answer can be : you don't :p)\n. Arrays are good, thanks. \nOne missing bit : when messages are inserted as HTML or HTML attribute, some characters must be encoded (as HTML entities) to output valid HTML. \nTwo possibilities to address this : \n- encoding is integrated in the t function, eg t(\"R&D\") --> R&amp;D\n- another function wrapper is used each time t return value must be inserted in HTML encodeFor...(t(\"R&D\"))\nObsviously, the first solution has the advantage of being applied globally to ensure proper encoding is never forgotten. the second solution allows for more use case (eg if I18N message but be printed in console, or any other plain text output), but they are probably not in use for now.\n. It looks good to me.\n. I also encountered this issue, in the following circumstances : \nI have an old project were JS libraries are loaded / initialized in the following order\n\nlegacy library prototypejs is first, and defines window.$\njQuery is second, and is with the noConflict() option to keep window.$ under prototypejs control\nmejs is loaded/initialized, which detects jQuery, and it overrwrite window.$ with jQuery in of the following line :\nhttps://github.com/mediaelement/mediaelement/blob/4.2.9/src/js/player/library.js#L8\n\n@rafa8626 why does mejs redefines window.$ (and window.jQuery, window.Zepto or window.ender for that matter) ? \nAs far as I could see in the whole mejs source code, $ is always contextualized and window.* is not needed for mejs as it always uses mejs.$.\nI don't think mejs should touch anything which is usually under control of other libraries, this would prevent any unwanted side effect.\nI just submitted the following PR for this problem : https://github.com/mediaelement/mediaelement/pull/2598\nWhat do you think ?. Good catch! this would clearly be a regression. \nPlease help with Git/GitHub/PR best practices... I'm a noob here : Should I add a new commit with a fix ? or somehow rewrite my commit in order to exclude this file, and which way would you recommend ?\n. fixed in    a757d06\n. ok, done, thanks \nsee ddcf35e\n. Because it would be a redudant check with the following line which checks str\nhttps://github.com/jalios/mediaelement/blob/2c5f19d56bc494f895ab1af97b9317b01d7d9536/src/js/me-i18n.js#L117\n. Maybe remove this whole section instead of commenting, then inform the Wordpress team of the modification ?\n. Usually, arguments provided in a translation methods are understood by developpers as values being used in the translation message (exatly the simple use %1 was providing), indicating in the variable name that it is a number and it may also provides additionnal formating such as management of plural is a little bit confusing I think.\nMaybe use a simpler and generic name like msgParams, params, values, args ?\nAnother possibility would be to omit this explicit variable declaration and use the arguments array (shifted by one to remove the input), like the original implementation of format method. It would allow any number of arguments and would not imply their type and feature (which are provided by filters). Of course this is more complex and not needed given the current use cases in mejs. So supporting only one message parameter is fine for me.\n. ",

No controls appear.\nI am seeing the issue in IE8 and IE10 with browser and document modes set to IE8 standards.\nIE8 is picky with Flash but it MEP seems to be doing the right things in that regard.  Other Flash content works when I embed it using the raw HTML string similarly to how MEP is doing it.\n. Unfortunately my work had the bright idea to make all of our \"web-based\" products run off of file:// (and IE8. And use Flash elements. Protip: The combination of those three is lethal, STAY AWAY). So that's not an option for us.\nI do not have control over the Flash version (I am trying to fix a customer issue) although I can reproduce with Flash 15.  Issue goes away if I switch IE10 to emulate IE9 instead of IE8 (again, customer is running IE7/8).\nAlready advised customer to check security settings, but it looks like My Computer security settings are hidden and need a special tool to adjust.\nI will try the debug option, thanks. I am also going to try forcing silverlight though I need to check to see if it is an option allowed by the customer...\n. I am aware of that issue and have a workaround for other projects. I was not aware that MEP required it, I will try that too, thanks.\nI have been pushing to bundle a web server or Chrome-based browsing engine with our product but unfortunately that doesn't seem to be happening any time soon. So I am stuck developing for file://\n. The trusted sandbox was the issue... now the video \"plays\", there is just no visuals (black screen with controls). Everything else works, from audio to controls to the time readouts. So just have to figure out that last bit. I a similar issue with other Flash content and had to remove and readd it to the DOM as raw HTML to fix it but that isn't working here.\nenablePluginDebug has no effect.\nOK The issue with the video not showing up is that any wmode other than window causes the visuals to  not render. Obviously wmode transparent is necessary for controls to overlay. I ran into this issue previously with other Flash content and was unable to resolve it.\nI have found an issue that sounds like mine: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9904736/flash-fallback-video-black-screen-no-video-only-audio-media-element but the fix does not work for me. However if I screw around with the Dev Tools the video appears in the upper left corner of the browser window, flickering.\nI am also seeing this issue on the http://mediaelementjs.com/ video displayed at the top of the page. It is not due to using file:///.\nThe only fix I can find is to remove the wmode setting so the video is visible, although this now causes errors to be thrown if you try and reload a page while a video is playing, though this can be worked around by calling .stop() on your MEP instance and removing all the relevant elements from the DOM in your window.onunload.\n. UGH wmode transparent works fine on real IE8, it's only a problem with IE10's emulation. I wish I had real development tools.\n. Oh, my mistake, it's happening on IE10/11 without emulation as well. I didn't notice until I forced Flash on... \nAlso under Windows Server 2012 R2 IE11 is defaulting to Flash for some reason???\n. ",

    "OwenEdwards": "Android (Chrome) and iOS (Safari) specifically block autoplay before a user interaction; see:\n- Unsolved HTML5 video issues on iOS\n- Safari HTML5 Audio and Video Guide: iOS-Specific Considerations - Safari Developer Library\n- Android Chrome does not allow applications to play HTML5 audio [and video] without an explicit action by the user\nThe best work-around seems to be Media playback restrictions in Blink, but this still requires one user interaction.\nDid autoplay on Android and iOS work at some point for MediaElement?\n. The YouTube Developer's page @zumek mentioned is really helpful!\nWith Safari on iOS 8 (8.1.1), clicking the play link (not the buttons, but the link further down the page) doesn't play the video. Looking at the \"Events and Function calls\" section at the bottom of that page, it seems to be buffering, and detecting the playback quality, but never plays. Tapping the play link again, the pause link, or even in the video window, doesn't get the video to play.\nWith Chrome (39.0.2171.59) on Android (4.4.4 on Nexus 7 v2), the first tap of the play link doesn't play the video, and seems to put it into the same state as on iOS 8,but the second tap on the play link does play the video. I've been able to replicate this behavior with MediaElement on Chrome/Android, so this seems to point to a bug in YouTube's iFrame player code.\nThe work-around for MediaElement used to be to tap on the video itself, but as of #1140, the 'big play' button overlays the video, so this doesn't work. I'm looking at re-enabling that work-around on iOS and Android, and filing a bug report with YouTube for the basic problem.\n. I suggest we change the title of this issue to \"Control bar play & scrub don't work for YouTube on Android and iOS\". It is specific to the control bar play button, the scrubber (and in theory anything else in the control bar this tries to start playback via the JavaScript API) to the YouTube player. Also, as noted, it is just on Android or iOS.\nAs @zumek mentions, tapping on the video's poster does play the video, except the fix for #1140 put the BigPlay button over the poster/thumbnail. In a sense, that's a separate issue, although it's the workaround for this issue.\nThe root cause of this is a bug in the YouTube iFrame player: \"play\" defect on mobile using chromeless player. Until that is fixed, I don't think this bug in MediaElement is fixable.\nIn addition, the YouTube poster and playback is now not rendering to the full size of the video window; see my comment on efab12be14894cb74411aa090d3fc084511c7656.\n. @zumek, I'd thought about hiding the control bar for iOS and Android until after first play (as Video.js does), but I'm adding controls to the control bar which I need a user to be able to interact with before starting playback!\nI'll need to do something more sophisticated to make clear that Play and Scrub don't work until play; any ideas?\n. This is related to efab12be14894cb74411aa090d3fc084511c7656; see my comment on it. It is 'sorta' fixed in 2.15.1, but I recommend that we do what you say, @magnum79.\n. See #1214.\n. The bower.json homepage line needs fixing to point to this repo, too!\n. I'm going to jump in here, and point out that the \"mejs-offscreen\" span is an Accessibility feature for Screen Reader users; see Invisible Content Just for Screen Reader Users. Changing it to something like \"display: none\" defeats the purpose of it, since then it won't be read out by the screen reader, although it is a workaround to fix the problem for now.\nThe fundamental issue here is that, as #1384 points out, the handling of the main container element was broken by this change, which was part of 9304e51fc52561acbf44341671796e919b5cbda3.\n@rylan @johndyer I suggest reverting just these three lines until we can find a way to add an #a11y title without breaking skins and fullscreen? \n. @beotiger that change seems like it ought to fix everything; I was just suggesting reverting three lines since they were obviously the source of the problem.\nIt looks like #1385 is a more complete fix, though. I just don't know if anyone here is testing every feature before release; there are so many combinations of features, browsers (and #a11y technology). We're part of the beta-testing process :-)\n. @ousia, which versions of flashmediaelement.swf and flashmediaelement-cdn.swf are you using? They were broken in 2.16.0, and fixed in 2.16.2 (see 68f8d8e0a14de94b42ae90a321cbb9b0386d4f02 and 922c2582edf6258bb151130f2f262175a17cd046).\n.

We also have plugins active on thousands of sites that would break if backward compatibility isn't taken into consideration. Here's a Sass partial from that plugin that shows how we're styling the player in case it's helpful.\nBackward compatibility is super important to us and the WordPress project as a whole.

    "troygrosfield": "An implementation suggestion here would be to leverage jquery's queue and build a new queue called audio (or something like that).  Then you can create the queue of files to play one after another.\n. One suggestion on a change media element here would be to pass a formatter function in when a player is instantiated.  Then a user can format the time however they please:\n``` js\nfunction formatTime(time) {\n    # format time into a string representation\n   return 'my formatted string'\n}\n$('video').mediaelementplayer({\n    'timeFormatter': formatTime\n})\n```\n. The link to the following video file is broken:\n- http://vickers.mediamelon.com/johndyer-mediaelement-02d979c/media/echo-hereweare.webm\nThat link is broken (hence the 404).

This worked prior to the changes >= 2.16.0.\n. Yes, everything was updated, including the CSS.\n. It's recreateable following the steps I listed above.  You can recreate the issue on any mediaelement object.  For instance:\n- go to: http://mediaelementjs.com/\n- open developer toolbar (I'm using chrome), run the following:\n$controls = $('#mep_0 .mejs-controls');\n$controls.append('<div class=\"mejs-button mejs-fullscreen-button\"><button type=\"button\" title=\"Fullscreen\" aria-label=\"Fullscreen\"></button></div>');\n$('#mep_0 audio')[0].player.setControlsSize();\nThen you'll see the time rail on the audio player disappear:\n\nAs mentioned before, this wasn't a problem with 2.15.x.\n. @johndyer, anything else you need to verify the issue?\n. Live and learn :) Let me know if you need any help testing after the changes are completed.  Thanks!\n. Yep, I've confirmed the change above works as well.\n. Although, it looks like the items in the control bar aren't correctly vertically aligned anymore (see times in screenshot below).  You can see that in @heddn screenshot and mine as well.  I'm using latest version of Chrome:\n\n@heddn, what browser/version are you using?\n. Thanks for the quick turnaround @johndyer.  I see perfect alignment in latest version of chrome.\n@heddn, side note, I would suggest managing dependencies, such as this one, by using a dependency management tool such as bower.  It will help you see when new releases are out when they are released.\nHappy coding!\n. Closing as this has been resolved with the 2.16.3 release.\n. For anyone coming to this in the future, you can already do this by using the w3 spec uri fragments:\n- http://www.w3.org/TR/media-frags/#fragment-query\nSo for the audio example on the mediaelement main page, if you wanted to only play the first 10 seconds of the audio file, your markup should be generated as follows:\n<audio src=\"/media/AirReview-Landmarks-02-ChasingCorporate.mp3#t=0,10\" type=\"audio/mp3\">\n</audio>\nAlso see:\n- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_HTML5_audio_and_video#Specifying_playback_range\n.

Hi - Further update,\nWhen attempting to play an mp3 audio file on an iphone it played fine but the duration time showed NaN:NaN and resets after approx 2.5 min.\nI understand this may be due to a Metadata problem\nTo try and resolve this we upgraded Wordpress from v3.7.3 to v3.9.1 and this made things worse.\nTo confirm mp3 files are being uploaded to our streaming server powered by Pydio v5.2.3\nOnce we upgraded to Wordpress v3.9.1 it worked fine using the latest version of IE and Safari but not on the latest version of Firefox and Chrome on a Windows machine.  Clicking the Play button changed it to Pause but did not play\nI can confirm that it worked fine using Firefox and Chrome on a Linux and Android device.\nWe then uploaded an mp3 audio file to a second website and then embedded this link into the original Wordpress site and it worked fine, so there appears to be a conflict between Wordpress 3.9.1 and Pydio v5.2.3\nTo confirm all is fine when using Wordpress v3.7.3 with Pydio v5.2.3 except when using an iphone/ipad when the file re-plays after approx 2.5 mins and the player displays NaN:Nan for the duration time.\nIt would be great if someone could provide us with some guidance and investigate the problem we are experiencing.\nI've also posted on the Wordpress and Pydio forum\nRegards\nSteveB\n. Hi\nJust checking if anyone has any ideas on the problem we are experiencing?\nRegards\nSteveB\n. ",
    "Wizard13": "I think it has something to do with setPlayerSize function in mep-player.js. It is called with arguments (100%, 100%) and the problem is that initially t.media.videoWidth and t.mediaHeight are empty, that's why nativeWidth and nativeHeight become equal to t.options.defaultVideoWidth (480) and t.options.defaultVideoHeight (270) respectively which have 16:9 ratio, therefore newHeight becomes wrong. When I hit play, t.media.videoWidth and t.mediaHeight obtain real values from that moment, that's why newHeight is calculated correctly.\nLet me explain it a bit more: in setPlayerSize there is a line:\nnewHeight = t.isVideo || !t.options.autosizeProgress ? parseInt(parentWidth * nativeHeight/nativeWidth, 10) : nativeHeight;\nIf I have a video 640x480, initially parseInt(parentWidth * nativeHeight/nativeWidth, 10) becomes parseInt(640 * 270/480, 10) which is 360,but that's wrong because if t.media.videoWidth and t.mediaHeight had values, it would become parseInt(640 * 480/640, 10) which would be the correct 480 that appears after I hit play.\nI don't know what to do exactly to fix the code, so for now I call the player like this:\n<script>\n$(function() {\n    $('audio,video').mediaelementplayer({\n        defaultVideoWidth: 640,\n        defaultVideoHeight: 480\n    }); \n});\n</script>\nto temporarily fix it for me, but the code needs a bug fix.\n. OK, I think I found a fix, but I'm not sure it's 100% fullproof.\nChange lines 780 and 781 in mep-player.js from:\nnativeWidth = t.isVideo ? ((t.media.videoWidth && t.media.videoWidth > 0) ? t.media.videoWidth : t.options.defaultVideoWidth) : t.options.defaultAudioWidth,\nnativeHeight = t.isVideo ? ((t.media.videoHeight && t.media.videoHeight > 0) ? t.media.videoHeight : t.options.defaultVideoHeight) : t.options.defaultAudioHeight,\nto\nnativeWidth = t.isVideo ? ((t.media.videoWidth && t.media.videoWidth > 0) ? t.media.videoWidth : (t.media.getAttribute('width') !== null ? t.media.getAttribute('width') : t.options.defaultVideoWidth)) : t.options.defaultAudioWidth,\nnativeHeight = t.isVideo ? ((t.media.videoHeight && t.media.videoHeight > 0) ? t.media.videoHeight : (t.media.getAttribute('height') !== null ? t.media.getAttribute('height') : t.options.defaultVideoHeight)) : t.options.defaultAudioHeight,\nIf t.media.videoWidth and t.media.videoHeight are empty, read the values from attributes \"width\" and \"height\" from the \"video\" tag if themselves are not empty, otherwise... the same. I don't know, is there another way to get proper values? Are these values only calculated once the video starts playing?\n. The problem surfaces when you use preload=\"none\", then t.media.videoWidth and t.media.videoHeight are empty in the beginning. If you don't use preload=\"none\", then video attributes are read and t.media.videoWidth and t.media.videoHeight obtain correct values.\n. Merge from John: johndyer/mediaelement@e64bc7db6d0de259dd127956097a2873d406cf94\n. Same thing happens in Firefox 31 in another computer.\n. Yes, it is much cleaner now. I think I found out why my fix is needed. If someone uses preload=\"none\", then t.media.videoWidth and t.media.videoHeight are empty. If you don't use preload=\"none\", then  t.media.videoWidth and t.media.videoHeight get the correct values.\n. Oh man, I've done something stupid, I only wanted the 2nd commit. The 1st commit is all the changes from your account copied to my account. What can I do now to fix this?\n. That was my bad, I confess :-(   I hope John gets to this soon.\n. ",

Maybe using grunt-text-replace.\nThis would remove the need for Builder.py, compiler.jar and yuicompressor-2.4.2.jar, making it unnecessary for developers to have Java installed (I think).\n.

    "smailliwnosaj": "I have the same issue.  I'm searching for a solution, now.\n. I figured it out.  IE has this awful way of triggering some events twice when other browsers only trigger them once.  I had a method which was removing a player before loading a new one.  IE fires these events at almost the exact same time.  So, it is difficult to find them.  My method removes a player from the players array.  The first time through the method, the player existed and was removed.  The second time through the method, the player was null.  So, the error threw.  \nDo a check if the player exists before calling remove()\n. This issue can be reproduced on the home page:\nhttp://www.mediaelementjs.com\nwhen opened in Internet Explorer.\nThe issue seems to be related to taking focus on the player.  After clicking on the player, the controls act like they are trying to hide but then immediately come back into view.  The only way to prevent the behavior seems to be to take focus on some other element on the page.\nCould some one share which version of MediaElement.js introduced this issue?\n. ",

Testing with mediaelement.js 2.23.4 from Chromium on a standard linux mint install (and thus with mp4 support), http://html5test.com/ will report H.264 support, however mediaelement.js still restricts media support for Chromium to webm, ogv, and ogg due to the following\n// special case for Chromium to specify natively supported video codecs (i.e. WebM and Theora)\nif (result.isVideo && mejs.MediaFeatures.isChromium) {\n    htmlMediaElement.canPlayType = function(type) {\n        return (type.match(/video\\/(webm|ogv|ogg)/gi) !== null) ?

I would think there would be more Chromium users nowadays with mp3/mp4 support then the opposite, and it's unfortunate that using mediaelement.js can remove support for those clients when only a mp4 file is available (because flash fallback won't work in most, being supported on linux only with Chrome)..

You mean that I might get better luck if I change the meta? Just as a note, I was previously using jPlayer and it used to play much faster, like native elements also do... Is it not possible to start playing before the meta is loaded?. Firstly, thanks for helping.\nSo,\n```\n\nmejs.players.mep_0.media.rendererName\n\"html5\"\n```\n\nI could not find an Html5Renderer, I am not familiar with the mediaelement source, is HlsNativeRenderer used in this case? That's the only renderer where I could apply the suggestion too:\nhlsPlayer.attachMedia(node);\n// hlsPlayer.loadSource(value);\nif (autoplay) {\n    hlsPlayer.on(hlsEvents.MANIFEST_PARSED, function () {\n        node.play();\n    });\n}\nUnfortunately it didn't help. It is very strange that the player always waits for roughly (if not exactly) 2.5MB to load before playing.. This might be the case for some of the files (I doubt it is for all of them though) and because the mp3 files are part of music libraries it is not an option for me to process them anyway. I am convinced that I cannot blame the files 100% though, this results in playing all of them instantly (displaying the correct duration too):\n<html>\n<head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"></head>\n<body>\n<audio id=\"player\" controls></audio>\n<button onclick=\"next()\">next</button>\n<script>\n  var tracks = [\n    // ...\n  ];\n  var player = document.getElementById('player');\n  var next = function () {\n    player.setAttribute('src', tracks[Math.round(Math.random() * 1000) % tracks.length]);\n    player.load();\n    player.play();\n  };\n</script>\n</body>\n</html>\nFor me it is more  important to play instantly than have additional meta available, the meta has been parsed into a database anyway, that is why I asked if there is a way to play right after setSrc and not wait for processing.. Actually the first thing I did was to remove the call to load() after setSrc() and call play() instead of using autoplay or call play on \"loadedmetadata\". Today everything is loading blazing fast without having changed anything, it's like it slept on it...\nI went through the source and indeed there is nothing there that justifies the delays, it is really very strange, especially the part that it was always waiting for the same amount of data every time.\nUnfortunately it's not easy to share a link to the application, I'd need client consent.\nThanks for bothering and sorry for wasting your time, I will post back if I face it again and conclude to something useful..

Actually, its seem that the timeupdate event is assured to be called at least once every 250ms in Chrome and other browsers. In Firefox its even worse (or better), for every frame!!! I am working on an app that uses this player as a base where battery life is important. So I re-wrote the code so that the callback itself is removed after the controls are hidden and reapplied when they are visible. Makes a reallllly big difference in battery life when you are watching hours of videos.\n. In my app, I have changed it into something like this, \n```\nfunction showControls() {\n    //show controls code\n   this.media.addEventListener('timeupdate', this.timeUpdateCallback);\n}\nfunction hideControls() {\n    //hide controls code\n   this.media.removeEventListener('timeupdate', this.timeUpdateCallback);\n}\nfunction timeUpdateCallback() {\n   // notice the this.player reference as 'this' refers to the media DOM element here as this function\n   // is called with the media element as context\n   this.player.updateDuration();\n   this.player.updateCurrent();\n}\n```\n.

    "SeventhCycle": "That's good to know, thank you. It's a workaround that will do for now in the nearterm.\nIn this case, though, it's not ideal. When it comes to browsers like Safari, they can play HLS natively. By setting mode:'auto_plugin', it makes the system use the flash plugin when it can be playing the HLS file natively.\nThe reason I'm looking to avoid this is that some browsers are either starting to block Flash, or prompt for an okay to trust the domain to load the flash player. In this case, I'm just looking for a path of least resistance, where it evaluates the following in order:\n1) Plays the HLS file through HTML5 if available.\n otherwise\n2) Plays the HLS file through the flash player if flash is available.\n otherwise\n3) Tries the option again using the next file listed as a source (in my example, an MP4).\nI understand that this sort of logic may not be available in the player right now. If it isn't, please let me know if this is something available as a paid customization to have it added to the project and I'll contact you directly.\n. @ron666: Does this change the way the load order is handled?\nFor example:\n- Take, for instance, IE10. It doesn't have hls.js support, and (from what I recall), it doesn't have native HLS support.\n- Also, anything < Firefox 42 won't have support for this.\nWith the above example:\n\n\nUnder auto, it will try playing the mp4 file in these browsers before it tries using a plugin such as Flash to play the m3u8 file.\nYour work to integrate hls.js into this project looks pretty awesome so far! I'm just trying to think about these edge cases in relation to this ticket.\nFYI: The main reason I'm looking to have the system use HLS first is auto-stream adjustment. I only want to serve someone a non-HLS file when absolutely necessary.\nThis isn't super important since I've written detection code to work around this as an interim solution. Still, it will make things easier if there's a native way to set priority. :)\nAnyhow, thank you so much for your help!\n. Hi @ron666,\nI went ahead and updated the player that's here:\nhttp://seventhcycle.net/mejs/shim_problem/\nIt's using 2.22.0 that's listed on the front of the mejs site.\nBy default, it's using mode:\"shim\", but I added a flag in the PHP script here so that you can turn this off and have it load the HTML5 player for comparison.\n1. The volume control shows up now, so it looks like that part is fixed (yay)\n2. This is still an issue. There's no graphic or anything to indicate that the video is waiting until it can load / seek.\nThe new version also adds this regression:\n3. In full screen, the video stream shows in an extremely tiny window at the top center of the screen. This is happening on two separate machines of Firefox on Mac (one version running El Capitan, one running Sierra)\nAlso, within this specific movie:\n4. There is no sound on the video. This may be, however, a flash limitation as there are two separate streams within this video:\nStream #0:1(und): Audio: mp3 (mp4a / 0x6134706D), 48000 Hz, stereo, s16p, 160 kb/s\nStream #0:2(und): Audio: ac3 (ac-3 / 0x332D6361), 48000 Hz, 5.1(side), fltp, 320 kb/s (default)\nI'm uncertain if there's anything that can be done on that point. Totally understandable if there isn't.\nIf you need a zip of all these files for the purpose of reproducing this locally, please let me know.\n. @ron666 Here you go:\nhttp://seventhcycle.net/mejs/mejs.zip\nIt's a little on the hefty side due to the example video. Please let me know if you need anything else on my end.\n. @ron666 I went ahead and updated the test URL here:\nhttp://seventhcycle.net/mejs/shim_problem/\nThis is using release 2.22.1-54-g507c935, which is available on the front page of the mejs website.\n2) Scrubbing still appears to be an issue here. I imagine you haven't checked on that yet (which is okay!), but just wanted to note that the new release didn't end up fixing it automatically. :)\n3) The way fullscreen is rendered in shim mode has changed in the new build. Instead of a little window, I'm now seeing the video as 100% wide, but only about 10% tall.\n4) I confirmed that this is a sound issue. I added a new encoded version that uses AAC as its codec in the example above. Seems the Firefox HTML5 player is more lax about audio codecs than Flash is. So the audio issue can be ignored.\nI understand that we're dealing with two separate issues at this point. Please let me know if submitting a separate tracking issue here would be helpful.\nThanks!\n. @ron666 I apologize for my ignorance on this one.\nI went ahead and downloaded the 3.x-dev branch here:\nhttps://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/archive/3.x-dev.zip\nI'm trying to see how to compile what's there into the regular files that are available to download (e.g: mediaelement-and-player.min.js).\nI could have sworn there was a document somewhere on how to get started. Can you point me in the right direction so I can test this out? Thanks.\n. Hi @ron666: Thanks! With a little bit of work, I was able to compile the software and get it in place.\nLooking here:\nhttp://seventhcycle.net/mejs/shim_problem/\nI'm seeing that the system doesn't appear to be honoring the \"shim\" argument at all now. It's now loading the HTML5 version regardless of whether or not I specify the shim.\nCan you take a look on your end and let me know if I'm doing anything wrong here? Thanks.\n. @ron666: Okay, this seems to work here:\nhttp://seventhcycle.net//mejsdev/test/flash.html\nWhich is very promising.\n1) The mute button does not seem to work at all at the moment.\n2) Scrubbing is same, unchanged. But I don't think you've addressed that yet. :)\n3) I've noticed some of the time when changing between fullscreen and regular size that the player bar seems to take up 100% of the screen. This means it's not properly scaling back down to the regular size. It may or may not have to do with the mouse hovering on the scrollbar when exiting out. Just wanted to give you a headsup on that one.\n4) For some reason, it doesn't seem to be loading the flash here:\nhttp://seventhcycle.net//mejs/shim_problem/\nFor the purpose of being 100% that the problem is solved, can you tell me if there's anything missing here that I need to include in order for this to load the player? It was loading the player in the 2.0 code.\n5) Finally, is there any way to specify Renderers.order per player instance instead of globally? I figure I'd ask this since the way this works seems to be a pretty big change from 2.0.\nI understand that there's multiple issues here. Please let me know if you want me to start splitting things off into multiple tickets so it's easier to answer / handle.\nThanks!\n. @ron666 Out of curiosity, did anything change in the 3.0 build?\nI'm attempting to build a script that unzips and builds the software.\ncd /home/httpd/seventhcycle.net/html/mejsdev/\nrm -Rf *\nwget \"https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/archive/3.x-dev.zip\"\nrm -Rf mediaelement-3.x-dev/\nunzip 3.x-dev.zip\nmv mediaelement-3.x-dev/* ./\nrm -Rf mediaelement-3.x-dev\nln -s /home/httpd/seventhcycle.net/html/flex ./src/flash/flex_sdk_4.6\nnpm install\ngrunt html5only\nsh compile_swf.sh\nOn the \"npm install\" part, I'm getting this:\n```\nnpm ERR! install Couldn't read dependencies\nnpm ERR!

This may also help:\nhttp://seventhcycle.net//mejsdev/test/hls.html\nI took the flash video example you have and added this:\nmejs.Renderers.order = ['flash_video'];\nin the code so that the HTML player won't load. This may help you be able to reproduce this locally since it's a minor modification to the test code included in the dev branch.\n. Here's what looks good.\n1. Mute / volume control works as expected now.\n2. Video loads without distortion with flash mode.\n3. The seeking bar seems to work now on flash mode. Awesome!\nOnly thing left:\n1. http://seventhcycle.net/mejs/shim_problem/\nTry changing back and forth between fullscreen and regular size on Firefox. You'll see a temporary graphical glitch where the bottom bar spans beyond the length of the screen / browser. Most of the time, it quickly adjusts size to fit the browser window. Sometimes, it stays in place.\nI don't see this as a showstopper, but just wanted to make you be aware of it.\nThanks for the help in getting the build script working. It should be pretty painless to test new builds as they come up, now. :)\n. Sure. Is there a separate bug I can follow? I'll close this out and reply there if so.\n. Hello,\nI'm currently trying this out on the 3.0-dev build.\nI'm seeing:\nSpecified \u201ctype\u201d attribute of \u201capplication/x-mpegurl\u201d is not supported. Load of media resource /mejs/hls_test/upload/testset/testset.m3u8 failed.\nThe player source looks something like this:\n\n\nDo you have a public example of this working? If not, I'll create a HLS sample file that's suitable to post here.\n. @ron666: Thoroughly impressive. This is awesome!\nI realized why it didn't work. The system will recognize the type attribute of \"application/x-mpegURL\", but it won't recognize \"application/x-mpegurl\"\nLooks like there's an issue with case here. MIME types should be case insensitive, so looks like a small bug that needs fixing. :)\n. @ron666: This looks interesting from what I can see. I'm really interested to see how it turns out.\nHere's some things that I have off the top of my head to factor in. Some of these may already be addressed. It's more along the lines of thinking out loud for now since it's at a starting point.\n\n\nDevice support: I see that something like this will work with Google Cardboard, but I'm wondering if it will work with some of the other VR headsets out there, such as the Vive, the Oculus, and possibly the PS (I have no idea if their headset can access a browser at all). Just trying to think about the best way forward on this front.\n\n\nI see that the storage format on VR is the equirectangular-panoramic format. From my understanding, KRpano supports a different number of different views. I don't know if these are necessary for different devices or not. Forgive me, as I'm a little new to this, too.\n\n\nThat there's a way to determine whether or not a person has a VR headset on. I imagine there will be scenarios where they ONLY want a specific video to play if the person has a VR headset on, and get a regular video otherwise. This may be a boutique request, and that's fine if it is. Just trying to think ahead on it.\n\n\nI'll ask some of the other people I know with devkits if they have any feedback, and I'll get back to you on this.\nThanks!. Hi @ron666,\nI went ahead and got a Gear VR. I see some promise here!\nhttp://seventhcycle.net/mejsdev/test/player-full.html\nWhen I choose the VR option on this page and play the video, you can put the video fullscreen. When you do, there's a series of options (2d, 360 degree Top Bottom, 180 degree Side by Side, etc) This video seems to be 360 degree Top Bottom. If you put it in that mode, you get to look around and see the Gorilla close-by. It's a neat little effect.\nSome notes and questions so far:\n\n\nRight now, I don't see any ability to click and look around on the desktop. Right now, I just see two videos stacked on top of each other, one for each eye. My guess here is that there's something not implemented yet by the viewer.\n\n\nWhen I go into fullscreen, is there any way to pre-specify what kind of video this is? This way, somebody won't have to go in and tell it manually that it's a 360 degree top / bottom video.\n\n\nI notice as well that if I change the view mode out of 2d, the controls look distorted. I imagine this is because any sort of transform that's needed in order for them to show up in VR isn't happening.\n\n\nAnyhow, if there's something wrong with my install or build, please let me know and I'll recompile. Or, if you have a public place with your build where isn't working better, please let me know.\nAlso, please let me know what kind of VR headset you have (if any). I'll see about getting a comparable one.\nThanks and Happy Holidays!. Hi,\nThe video shows up now within a browser window.\nWhen I put the video fullscreen, I still have to set the settings in order to determine what kind of immersion playback I want.\nIt might be worth waiting until the WebVR spec (https://iswebvrready.org/) is ready, and Google VR View integrates with it (if possible). I noticed on KRpano 1.19 that I don't have to configure settings for my device when using their new build that uses WebVR. It's able to get the settings for the device and video automatically and serve it to the user without having to do any configuration on the client side.\nI don't know if that makes sense or not. Please let me know.\n. Forgot to specify: This is happening on the 3.0 dev branch.\n. http://seventhcycle.net//mejsdev/test/alpha-2.html\nWent ahead and redownloaded / rebuilt from 3.0-dev. Still seeing a bar glitch where the progress bar is wider than the length of the video.\nPlease let me know if I should use a source other than 3.0-dev and if so, where to find the build.\n. @ron666 Sure. I'm still familiarizing myself with git (still using SVN), so I'm getting used to it.\nBut if you put it in 3.0-dev, I'll gladly test it in more browsers. I'm on MacOS Sierra, I can test Safari / Firefox / Chrome there. I have Parallels, so whatever IE / Windows configuration you want me to test I can test. I also have iOS / Android devices, so I can test on those too.\nIf you need me to check other bugs, tag me and I can check those too. However I can help.\n. I probably won't be able to touch this until Monday. But to confirm, this is now a part of 3.0-dev, yes?\n. Sorry for the delay on this.\nUsing a build from today, when doing grunt html5only, I get this:\nWarning: Promise is not defined Use --force to continue.\nI'm putting in --force into the batch script, however, this may be something you want to adjust in your build.\nHere is a page where I did tests:\nhttp://seventhcycle.net/mejsdev/test/hls.html\nTested on:\nFirefox 49: Don't see any resizing issues\nSafari 10.0.2 (12602.3.3): Still occasional glitch when resizing between fullscreen and window. The bar appears to be significantly wider than the window for a short amount of time.\nChrome 54.0.2840.71 (64-bit): Same, although the bar disappears faster.\nWindows 7:\nIE9: Fullscreen button does not work. If possible, can you test on your end? This may be a complication of running a VM in parallels, however, since Chrome works, this may be a new IE specific error.\nChrome 54.0.2840.87 m: The full screen bar wraps to a new line. The same graphical glitch where resizing between fullscreen and window makes the bar wider for a short amount of time.\nWindows 8 IE10: \nSame thing: Fullscreen button does not work.\nI'm going to be away from my development environment for a while, but I'll run more tests on this when I get back, and if you have an update.\n. @ron666 Sorry, I had to go away from my computer for a bit.\nhttp://seventhcycle.net/mejsdev/test/player-full.html\nI went ahead and redownloaded / rebuilt the player this morning.\nThis overall seems to be better at the above URL. I do have a concern, though, that having the player fit the browser window like this is masking the issue.\nFirefox 49: Don't see any resizing issues\nSafari 10.0.2 (12602.3.3): Don't see any resizing issues.\nChrome 54.0.2840.71 (64-bit): Don't see any resizing issues.\nWindows 7:\nIE9: Clicking fullscreen seems to maximize the video to the size of the browser window, not the full screen. This is being run through parallels, though, so it may be an issue with parallels. If you have a native IE version sitting around, please try there.\nChrome 54.0.2840.87 m: Don't see any resizing issues.\nWindows 8 \nIE10: Same thing as above. Clicking fullscreen seems to maximize the video to the size of the browser window, not the full screen. This is being run through parallels, though, so it may be an issue with parallels. If you have a native IE version sitting around, please try there.\nWindows 10:\nEdge: This seems to resize correctly and doesn't have the fullscreen issue that IE has. When escaping, the way the bar shrinks separately from the window is a little glitchy looking for a moment, but it's understandable if nothing can be done on that front.\nIE11: Don't see any resizing issues.\n. @ron666 Is this a deliberate change from 2.0?\nhttp://seventhcycle.net/mejs/load_problem/?mode=2\nvs\nhttp://seventhcycle.net/mejs/load_problem/?mode=3\nI made it so you can toggle between 2.0 and 3.0 on this page. 2.0 uses width=100% without any issues, but 3.0 can't.\nIt's okay if this is a new requirement for 3.0, but just wanted to make sure this was on purpose and not an oversight.\n. Okay. Is there any build I should be testing in this case? Or should I just make sure to use the new max-height method?\n. http://seventhcycle.net/mejs/load_problem/?mode=2\nvs\nhttp://seventhcycle.net/mejs/load_problem/?mode=3\n2.x resizes the player to a height proportional to the width of the video player.\n3.x does not.\n. Looks like that did the trick.\nYou can close this out unless there's anything else here that needs finalized.\n. This has been really helpful. Thank you!\nrenders\nThat seems to do the trick for getting the flash player to load.\nIs there still Silverlight support for loading WMV files?\nAlso, if I don't specify renders at all, will it try doing flash as a fallback? Or will it only do a HTML5 player.\nenablePluginSmoothing:\nAwesome. Is this something that is still controlled by enablePluginSmoothing: true/false? Or is there another variable I should set this to if I wish to turn this on / off?\nIf it's going to be left on without an option in the future, that's okay. I'd rather it always be on than always be off.\nenablePseudoStreaming\nSorry if I'm a little confused here, but was this always something that was Flash-only?\nIf so, if you're trying to seek ahead on an mp4 file, will it always try and do a RANGE download on all browsers that support it?\nI'm just trying to avoid the video requiring a progressive download where possible.\nfeatures\nConfirmed. Looks like there was a lot changed under the hood (including namespaces). I went ahead and re-coded the vtt preview plugin to work with 3.0. I'll go ahead and contact the plugin author so that any new releases can work with 3.0.\n. One last question before I can go in and do browser testing on 3.0.2 :)\nOne of the big features of 3.0 is HLS.js support - so we can play HLS files natively in an HTML5 with browsers such as Firefox and Chrome.\nOn this page:\nhttps://github.com/dailymotion/hls.js/tree/master\nThey provide this example to test if HLS is available:\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/hls.js/latest/hls.min.js\"></script>\n<video id=\"video\"></video>\n<script>\n  if(Hls.isSupported()) {\n    var video = document.getElementById('video');\n    var hls = new Hls();\n    hls.loadSource('http://www.streambox.fr/playlists/test_001/stream.m3u8');\n    hls.attachMedia(video);\n    hls.on(Hls.Events.MANIFEST_PARSED,function() {\n      video.play();\n  });\n }\n</script>\nIt looks like the Hls variable isn't available directly when I do an include for MediaElements. Is this hidden somewhere?\nThanks!\n. Okay. That's really good that it's there.\nIt's just that I'm specifically looking to test the file before there's an instance of the media player created. Basically, if the system doesn't support m3u8 via HLS.js, don't even include it within the  tag being created for the player.\nI'm thinking that what I'll do to get around this is have a local copy of HLS.js (instead of the one you get from //cdn.jsdelivr.net/hls.js/latest/hls.min.js), and include that as part of the ",

How about adding AirPlay also?\nhere is a demo: https://jsfiddle.net/8gd83urs/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=embed&utm_campaign=8gd83urs. Would like something more internal support rather then having some plugin. Casting is something that everyone would want. videojs also have plugin for casting\nhttps://github.com/benjipott/video.js-chromecast\nhttps://github.com/jgubman/videojs-airplay. The advantage with presentation api vs chromecast is that you can also cast to some TV's with DIAL (discovery and launch) . Is this still relevant too?\nhttps://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/blob/38cac71e7e13a24d6a4e8bccb469dc1f7faef515/src/js/core/mediaelement.js#L294. Sounds grate \ud83d\udc4d . I don't have Windows, and iOS.\nBut I can test FF, Blink, Safari 10 on Mac later . in safari I got a little surprised when i enter fullscreen while having the devtool open\n\nGuess there is nothing that can be done about it. only developers will experience this...\nit's supposed to show the dev tool but it gets black when toggeling the fullscreen. it works if you go into fullscreen first and then open developer tools\n\nI think it's nothing worth spending time on. However this gave me another idea. Safari/Mac has picture in picture mode, it would be nice to have maybe? could be built as a plugin maybe?. It's looking good now \ud83d\udc4d . I have only tested this on Mac\nFirefox 52\nSafari 10.0.3\nChrome 56. tested android. think it looks fine, can close this now. Chrome's default player now has a download button when you are playing a video\nJust saying... . ups, meant to do it on standalone. @ron666 I have seen you using removeChild in a few places.\nI just want to inform you that there is a remove method now available on elements so you no longer need to know the parent. Unfortunately IE don't support it without a polyfill\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ChildNode/remove\nIf you like i can make a PR that includes the polyfill and change removeChild to elm.remove(). It seems like IE9 supports it according to mdn? so we don't need that polyfill?. Ah, didn't see that part \ud83d\udc4d . Won't be able to test IE, only have Mac + I'm at work atm, but i can help you test it later in other browsers. That is what I'm asking for (the .babelrc)\nIt won't mather so much if it's the 4 or 5 last versions as long as i can change it myself later\nBut for the sake of it i think last 5 is a good choice for everyone else here using mediaelement, you are targeting a big crowd of people and not yourself . Thanks. relevant: https://github.com/Ranks/emojione/issues/285. Yea, I keep a reference to the same loadScript promise and calling .then() when it's done\nIt's a super tight promise lib since IE don't have promises, therefore i don't think it should be exposed as a public api on mejs.Utils since you could expect the promise to do what you think it would do\nIt only dose the bare minimum.. The script loading works fine, but I thought I would try to immediately play the soruce after i have set a source to something, for instance: \njs\nplayer.setSrc('http://www.bok.net/dash/tears_of_steel/cleartext/stream.mpd');\nplayer.load();\nplayer.play();\nBut that didn't work. player.load didn't have any callback or thing like that... how do i know when i can play?. Hmm, having to make a such check with interval feels a little [...]\nI haven't used mediaelement so much and don't know it's ins and outs, But I remembered it as it tried to be much like the native video element before a couple of years ago, just found out about the player.load() function now. Not really sure why it needs to exist.\nThe way native media element works is if you try to play something you would get back a promise if it succeeded. So it can also be asynchronous, I suppose.\nSo the way I would like it to work is like this:\njs\nplayer.src = 'http://www.bok.net/dash/tears_of_steel/cleartext/stream.mpd'\nplayer.play() // detects dash, loads api, tries to play, resolves\n  .then(function() {\n    // Automatic playback started!\n  }).catch(function(error) {\n    // Automatic playback failed.\n    // Show a UI element to let the user manually start playback.\n  });. Sounds good!\nAlso since we don't support ie8 anymore we could start to depreciating stuff like setSrc and use setters/getters instead if you like.\n\ndoes what it states: One UI\n\nPS. Just had a glint on this: http://www.cssplay.co.uk/menu/cssplay-vimeo-hide-control-bar.html . My first thought is if we are going to expose promises in loadScript, and the play method i think it would be best to precent to them a real promise that dose all the things you would expect it to do\ntry/catch, chain working with async/await\nSo i don't mind if you where to use the polyfill. > We may need to bring loadScript as a Utility since I'm using it other renderers, and this has some advantages of reducing a lot of code lines. This also can be used for Chromecast plugin. Thoughts?\nIt sure would be useful\nit can partly be used for the chromecast plugin, you could use it to load the script but you would still have to wait for there callback, Both youtube and the chromecast api is not finished by just loading 1 script file.\nFor instance https://www.youtube.com/player_api this only loads another script file so you would still have to listen for window.onYTReady\nso you would have to do something like this:\njs\nvar scriptLoaded = new Promise((rs, rj) => {\n  window.onYTReady(rs)\n  loadScript('https://www.youtube.com/player_api')\n})\nchromecast works the same way. Would you consider adding a promise polyfill for ie?\nMaybe if we try to mimic the native player and returns a promise, maybe it would be useful?. Would prefer a \"Bare bones Promises/A+ implementation\"\nNot something like Bluebird or Q\nWould like it if it eventually could be removed or be optional\nbut the first thing that popped up on npm was: https://www.npmjs.com/package/promise. maybe: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/es6-promise?. Would this be an option?\nhtml\n<script>\n  !window.Promise && document.write('\\x3Cscript src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/es6-promise/4.1.0/es6-promise.min.js\">\\x3C/script>');\n</script>. ok. https://polyfill.io/v2/docs/ useful?. Remember reading about it but never used it. You don't have to load there entire polyfill lib, if you need only promise you would use features\nhttps://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/polyfill.js?features=Promise\n// simulating ie9\nhttps://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/polyfill.js?features=Promise&ua=Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0; MDDSJS)\n. facebook could also use mejs.Utils.loadScript...\ninstead of:\njs\n(((d, s, id) => {\n                const fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n                if (d.getElementById(id)) {\n                    return;\n                }\n                const js = d.createElement(s);\n                js.id = id;\n                js.src = 'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js';\n                fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);\n            })(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));. lgtm.

If i throw the URL in my mediaelementjs 2.16.4 it will be played. \n3.x says first no candidates could be loaded and if I click on play again, i still get the CORS error. I have the feeling the file get method of the old player was better, than the one in the hls.js. \n. @ron666 thanks for the help. We will ask Level3.net to add the CORS headers. \nTo test the new version I installed a CORS plugin for Firefox. I disabled the restriction and now it's working well, without errors. \n. @ron666 I need to play Ads before the main hls video. If in the HlsNativeRenderer settings the autoStartLoad is set to true, it's always loading the main video which is first set. But I have a script which is checking on play, if ads should be played or not and then I have to change the source temporarily for the Ad and after the Ad is ended back to the main video url. But it seems to ignore the check on play if autoStartLoad is true. Do you have a tip for me, how so solve this?\n. yes, this way it stops autoStartLoad. The documention of hls.js says \"autoStartLoad, if set to false, an explicit API call (hls.startLoad(startPosition=-1)) will be needed to start quality level/fragment loading.\"\nWill the player do that automatically or is there also a way for me to set that?\n. I think this will be the same as autoStartLoad: true, but it gives me an idea how to solve my problem. \nBut now my ealiest test for this is monday morning. I will tell you if this will work.\nthanks\n. I tried that, but I get an error message -> TypeError: media.startLoad is not a function\n. I think I found the problem in my script. \nWhen I get the list of possible Ad files, the script is checking for a suitable format:\nif(this._mediaElement.canPlayType(this._adVideo.mediaFiles[i].mimeType))\nBut the answer of this._mediaElement.canPlayType(this._adVideo.mediaFiles[i].mimeType) is always an empty string.\nI think the problem is, that this._mediaElement does not point to a video tag, it points to <mediaelementwrapper id=\"rtliVideovideo2742\"> and this is not supporting a canPlayType.\n. if I call this:  this._mediaElement.src \nI don't get my real video link, I get each time the media source as result, which looks like this: mediasource:http://elex2.dev.eoa.de/826eb3cd-1a55-4f0c-acb0-61187abc15ba \nThat make it impossible to compare the source of the player with my original video link. This is because you use now 2 video tags:\n<mediaelementwrapper id=\"rtliVideovideo2742\">\n<video id=\"rtliVideovideo2742_native_hls\" class=\"\" preload=\"none\" src=\"mediasource:http://elex2.dev.eoa.de/826eb3cd-1a55-4f0c-acb0-61187abc15ba\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"></video>\n<video id=\"rtliVideovideo2742_from_mejs\" src=\"http://toggo-hlse-vod.dcp.adaptive.level3.net/Angelo/Shorts/manifest.m3u8?tlm=hls&streams=AN_214.mp4.m3u8:1200&stime=20161024114945&etime=20161024125445&token=004d7be8e4bd0519a55e7\" preload=\"none\" style=\"display: none;\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"></video>\n</mediaelementwrapper>\nI my case i need that to set the original video link, check is there an Ad to play, if yes play the Ad and then back to the original video. \n. yeah, that is what I needed. media.originalNode give me the video node that I need. \nAt the moment I have a testing break, because the Ad server is not sending Ads anymore. I wait for an answer of the Ad publisher, if there is a call which forces the server to send a test video Ad. \n. @ron666 \nok it's all working well for me now. media.originalNode.getAttribute('src') was the most helping clue. \nMy player is now playing pre and postrolls + VAST Ad files. \nthanks again\n. In the mediaelement-and-player.js, I removed the <span> tag for the loading animation and mapped the background animation directly on the surrounding DIV, because otherwise the gif has a black instead of a transparent background:\nloading =\n    $('<div class=\"mejs-overlay mejs-layer\">' +\n    '<div class=\"mejs-overlay-loading\"></div>' +\n    '</div>')\n    .hide() // start out hidden\n    .appendTo(layers),\nHere the css:\n.mejs-overlay-loading {\ndisplay: block;\nwidth: 43px;\nheight: 45px;\nbackground: transparent url(loading.gif) center center no-repeat;\n}\n. oh my fault..... \nI haven't seen that the surrounding DIV has got a nearly black gradient background by css. \nPlease ignore my last posting. \n. ok I will test it today\n. @ron666 I tested it right now and from my side all looks fine. \n. @ron666 I have a last question. Is there a parameter to scale the video to fit the playersize? \nI have seen the streching parameter, but this is streching the whole player, not only the video. \n. @ron666 I found a bug in mediaelement-and-player.js. If you click in the time bar and change the play position the condition is everytime unequal. I found that out, because I had to add an eventtrigger to this function for media tracking and my events got fired several times.\nThis is because newTime has more digits after the separator than media.currentTime, which has everytime 6 digits after the seperator.\nOriginal: \n     if (mouseIsDown && newTime !== media.currentTime)\nFixed:\n    if (mouseIsDown && newTime.toFixed(6) !== media.currentTime.toFixed(6))\n. meanwhile I found out that .toFix(4) works much better, because on fast pc's it's often unequal at the six digit after the seperator. \n. http://toggo-elex2.beta.eoa.de/videos/eoa/videokategorie-neu-566.htm?v=d30fc3358057c6ab580afb2153e1d22c#elexdebug \nIf you activate seeking, it's now firing triggerEvent videoStop and then triggerEvent videoPlay. \nWithout that fix it will fire this events several times on each click. \n. @ron666 \nif I change the source after clicking the play button (for Ads) I get in Chrome this error message: \nUncaught (in promise) DOMException: The play() request was interrupted by a new load request.\ncan you tell me how to avoid this?\n. yes, I found this link also, but it's not helping, because it's an other error. This is for play() interrupted by pause(), but my problem is play() interrupted by load, because Chrome is ignoring startAutoPlay: false and preload=\"none\" inside the video tag. So each time the original video is preloaded and at the moment when I change the source for an Ad or another video I get this error message. \n. @ron666 \nI found a new problem. On Win10 IE11 the player is correctly playing the hls videos. \nmediaelement-and-player.js  is checking for isNative.\nisNative = media.rendererName.match(/(native|html5)/);\nOn Win10 it's filled with native_hls but on Win7 in IE11 it's filled with flash_hls and the player stops working. \nIn my case I can't use a flash fallback because of the player skinning. \n. ah ok I understand. I think the problem is my dynamic changing of the source. I'm always awaiting a second video tag and try to change the source there. But in the flash fallback I have an object tag instead. \nSo I have to check if isFlashfallback and change the object src, instead of the video src if yes.\n. @ron666 can you tell me what I have to do, to change the source of the flash fallback dynamically? \nIf tried \n    media.setSrc(\"myUrl\");\n    media.load();\n    media.play();\nBut nothing happens. \n. @ron666 in Win7 IE11 the player is playing fine if I use your URL, but if I use my own video url, it's doing nothing. \nAfter loading the page I see  the unskinned player with a message \"invalid source\". And if click on play nothing happens anymore. \nPerhaps you can see the reason, here is my testlink with Flash fallback enabled.\nhttp://toggo-elex2.beta.eoa.de/videos/eoa/videokategorie-neu-566.htm?v=d30fc3358057c6ab580afb2153e1d22c \nthanks in advance\n. @ron666 \nI'm not able to find the problem. \nThe player is requesting this URL http://toggo-hlse-vod.dcp.adaptive.level3.net/Angelo/Shorts/manifest.m3u8?tlm=hls&streams=AN_214.mp4.m3u8:1200&stime=20161103100908&etime=20161103111408&token=07dfe698efe1515b1aad8\nWhere must the mimes be set? On the sever where I have the player on that level3.net server? \nI think on level3.net, right?\nFor the flash fallback, which mimes must be set? \n. @ron666 ah ok... I contacted the support there, to set the mime types. thanks :)\n. @ron666 ok, problem is not the mime type. If I use our player with your test url I get the same mime error, but it's playing the video. \nThe problems seems to be, that we use HLSE and not a simple HLS stream. The HTML5 version has no problems with the encryption, but the Flash player ends before he gets the encryption key from the footprint server.  We tested the URL http://toggo-hlse-vod.dcp.adaptive.level3.net/Angelo/Shorts/manifest.m3u8?tlm=hls&streams=AN_214.mp4.m3u8:1200&stime=20161103100908&etime=20161103111408&token=07dfe698efe1515b1aad8 on www.hlsplayer.net in IE11 on Win7 and this is running fine (I don't know that this player is using in background). \nThe last thing I can see is a request https://srtlkey.secure.footprint.net/crossdomain.xml and then it ends. The next step should be https://srtlkey.secure.footprint.net/key1.bin but this request never appears. \n. @ron666 thank, last night I was in contact with \"mangui/flashls\" and he told me the problem is the crossdomain.xml on the https://srtlkey.secure.footprint.net server. Because the videoplayer is on the website with http protocol and is trying to get the decryption key from a server with https protocol. \nToday I changed to crossdomain.xml to a new version with secure parameter set to false and now I'm able to receive the videostream:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE cross-domain-policy SYSTEM \"http://www.adobe.com/xml/dtds/cross-domain-policy.dtd\">\n<cross-domain-policy>\n    <site-control permitted-cross-domain-policies=\"all\"/>\n    <allow-access-from domain=\"*\" secure=\"false\"/>\n    <allow-http-request-headers-from domain=\"*\" headers=\"*\" secure=\"false\"/>\n</cross-domain-policy>\nNow I have the next problem, that the video in the flash fallback has the size of a poststamp:\n\ncan you tell me, what I have to set to fix that? In the javascript part the video has the correct size. \nMy current configuration is that:\n        pluginPath: '../../rtli-video-player/mediaelement/3/',\n    enablePluginDebug: 0,\n    showPosterWhenEnded: true,\n    alwaysShowControls: true,\n    features: ['playpause','stop','progress','current','duration','volume','fullscreen'],\n    loop: false,\n    videoWidth: '100%',\n    videoHeight: videoHeight + 'px', \n    hls: {\n            debug: false,\n            autoStartLoad: false\n         },\n. @ron666 I updated to the latest player version and changed my video width and hight as you told me. But now I have a problem with the rail. It's not scaling properly anymore. \nVideosize if fine now. \n\nFullscreen is also not scaling correctly anymore.\n\n. It seems the is a bug in the siblings width caculation for the rail, because .mejs-container .mejs-controls .mejs-time has a css witdh: auto .... \nIf I check the width, it's something about 130 pixels. But the siblings are calculated with a width of 54px . \n. I already downloaded the latest version, that was the problem. \nI fixed that now:\n    var\n        controlElements = t.controls.children('div'),\n    margin = parseFloat(controlElements.children('.mejs-time-total').css('margin-left')),\n                // 1px on error margin\n    siblingsWidth =  parseFloat(rail.siblings().width()) + margin - 1\n    siblings = 0;\n    ;\n$(rail).siblings().each( function ()\n{\n    siblings += parseFloat($(this).width()) + margin - 1;\n});\n. ok the final fix from my side will look like this:\n// Get number of features siblings to obtain total width to be reduced from time rail\nrail.width('100%').width('-=' + siblings);\nrail.find('.mejs-time-total').width($(rail).width()-20);\nI added the last line to calculate the .mejs-time-total \n. otherwise the .mejs-time-total is layerd by the playtime, so it must be a bit smaller than the rail itself.\n. your code is working fine. \nwithout my -20 the rail looks like this:\n\n. and without the line it looks like this: \n\n. it would be cool if you throw an eye on my testpage: http://toggo-elex2.beta.eoa.de/videos/eoa/videokategorie-neu-566.htm?v=d37e318da49e2a724b0130a31cd6e7f0&VideoDebugMode=1#elexdebug\nIn the flash fallback I still have the problem that the video size is not fitting the videoplayer. Seems to play the video in it's original size. If I resize the browser window the video size is switching to the correct size. \n. Hi, have you an idea how to fix my scaling problem? \n. When it's playing an Ad, it seems to have a size value inside the Ad file and the video size is correct. \nThe main video, \"Werbung Anfang\", \"Werbung Ende\" seems to have no size set. \nIf I resize my browser window manually the video is fitting correctly to the videoplayer. \nIs there a way for me to set the size manually?\n. thanks. meanwhile I'm near a working result. the resize trigger was exact what I needed. \nI only get an \"invalid state error\" when starting an Ad at this point:\nnode['set' + capName] = function (value) {\n                    node[propName] = value;\n};\nLine: 1418 in my mediaelement-and-player.js \nAnd in IE11 on Win7 I have problems pressing the big button in the middle. The small play buttons works better, but also not everytime. \n. ok invaled state is fixed. my fault. I had a wrong this._masterPlayer.currentTime = 0; at the point when I tried to play the Ad. \n. Do you have an idea when is the best time to fire the $(window).trigger('resize');\nBecause it works fine, but not everytime. The Ad intro and the postroll are not everytime resized correctly. \nI think it should be played in an event like afterStartPlay or ifLoadisFinished  or something like this.\nOn a native Win7 IE11 the button problem seems to be no problem. It happend only in emulated mode on Win10. \n. I'm near to a working result. One last problem in flash fallback is, that I don't see a loading indicator while loading. I click on play and it seems that nothing happens. It's not the same behavior like in the HTML5 player\n. @ron666 that wasn't helping. I handle it now by myself, with showing and hiding the BigPlay and loading DIV. \nAnother big problem in the HTML5 version is, that the videos in fullscreen mode are not fullscreen. They still have their original size and don't resize to full. Same problem as with the player before, if the video itself has no size settings. My resize trigger seems to show no effect in fullscreen mode. \n. In my version on the live server isn't that problem. Seems it came with one of the last updates. \n. I see the problem is, that the fullscreen size is set to the originalNode video tag, but to to the one with the mediasource. But this one is the one that is displayed.\n. I fixed that with this: In the \"enterFullscreen\" function ->\n```\nif (isNative) {\n        t.$media\n        .width(screen.width)\n        .height(screen.height);\n        t.media.setSize(screen.width, screen.height);\n\n```\nI added that t.media.setSize and now I have always full screen video in native mode. \n. in the flash fallback I got an error in around line 1109: \nif (mediaElement.renderer !== undefined && mediaElement.renderer !== null) {\nreturn mediaElement.renderer[methodName](arguments);\nthe object is not supporting the property or method \"stop\"\n. yes, that's another problem at the moment. The Ads generate a lot of errors which seems to have effect on the player. \nMeanwhile I'm in contact with the Ad distributor to make shure this erros will be fixed and have no longer affect on the player. Most Ad errors seem to be also CORS header problems. I think the video Ad is requesting banner Ads which a blocked by missing CORS headers. \nI fixed the stop problem with expanding the if statement: if (mediaElement.renderer !== undefined && mediaElement.renderer !== null && mediaElement.renderer[methodName] )\nSince I changed that, I never got that problem again. \n. @ron666 it could be that there is bug in the youtube detection. \nsometimes we have an Ad call like this: \nhttp://cdn.flashtalking.com/65328/ArcoTruck_Youtube_Annotations_simple_640x360_IP_mob_hq.mp4\nBut this server has not the correct CORS settings for our referrer. Instead of throwing an catchable error and skipping to the main video I have the phenomenon that it try's to call this URL instead and plays a YouTube error with white noise in background.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/ArcoTruck_Youtube_Annotations_simple_640x360_IP_mob_hq.mp4\nAn URL like this is not in any VAST file. Seems that the player detects the \"Youtube\" within the filename and then thinks this is a Youtube file. The Ad provider not removed this Ad from the VAST, but this is not a good solution. \n. @ron666 that worked fine thanks.\nNow I ran into the next problem on Android devices. If I start play in fullscreen mode the video sizes correctly. If I do an orientations change from portrait to landscape mode it keeps the orientation of the portrait mode. \nAnd in my special case, if one video has ended (the ad for example), the next video is not getting the fullscreen size. The video is scaling down to it's original size. \nTest URL:\nhttp://www.toggo.de/videos/index-103.htm \nAnd I have a strange behavior with the autoplay mode on Android. If ads are available I activate autoplay mode to play each video automatically. This works fine from the main ad to the ad outro and from there to the main video, but not from the ad intro to the main ad. I think this could be because of a renderer change. Ad intro is a hls video, the main ad is a native mp4 file and the rest is hls again. \nI hope you have some ideas for me, how to fix that. :-)\n. ok I found the reason for the stopping after the ad in play: Failed to execute 'play' on 'HTMLMediaElement': API can only be initiated by a user gesture.\nSeems that is a Chrome on Android security option. \n. ok, Anrdoid resizing in fullscreen is now fine. \nI added an on resize listener to the enterfullscreen function in the mediaelement-and-player.js\n```\n$( window ).on( \"resize\", function()\n{ \n        if (isNative) {\n            t.$media\n            .width(screen.width)\n            .height(screen.height);\n            t.media.setSize(screen.width, screen.height);\n        }\n\n        t.layers.children('div')\n        .width('100%')\n        .height('100%');\n\n});\n```\nI'm already firing a resize trigger on the beginning of each video and I added your orientationchange function in my script. \nBut this changes has no effect on an iPad with iOS 10.1.1 , it's absolutely ignoring the size settings.\n. @ron666 seems that the resize is not scaling both video tags.\nif I use this inside the enterfullscreen function and it's on resize event then it scales correctly:\nsetTimeout(function(){ \n                t.container.find('video')\n                .width('100%')\n                .height('100%').css('min-width','100%').css('min-height','100%');\n            }, 500);\n. for the \"Failed to execute 'play' on 'HTMLMediaElement': API can only be initiated by a user gesture.\" problem I must find a way to trigger both video tags (mediaelement and originalnode) with the same click. \nOtherwise it's not possible to fix that problem. \n. I tested the link in the demo player on hls.js page and I get this message: \n\nThe strange thing is, it is working on Edge Win10, IE11 Win7 but not IE11 Win10. \n. ok found the problem. It's the new version of hls.js. \nI had an older version of hls.js on my hard disk and with this it's running well. . tomorrow I will build a test scenario with the /test/hls.htm \nI will tell you the result.\n. Before I start building a new test setup, I found out the problem is in all browsers and devices with native HLS support. This includes  Windows 10 (Microsoft Edge), OS X 10.6+ (Safari and QuickTime), iOS 3.0+ (Safari), and Android 4.1+[23] (Google Chrome). This browsers don't need the hls.js extention and it seems that is the reason why the video is played twice in this case. . \nI debugged my page with Chrome and an Android device and I found out, that the 2nd video tag is set to display:none but is also playing the video file, but you only hear it's sound. If I remove the 2nd element the 2nd audio stops.. my fix for now is to add an eventlisterner for 'playing' to the hls video tag and if it's playing I pause the mejs video tag. . ah ok cool, I will check that. . argh, you changed all css class names, now my own style settings are not working anymore and I see a completely broken player. \n:-/. ok, I found the class prefix setting. Looks better now. :) Testing now the Android function.. I have still the same problem with the second click on the play button on Android devices. \nYou can test it here: http://toggo-elex2.beta.eoa.de/videos/eoa/videokategorie-neu-566.htm?v=d37e318da49e2a724b0130a31cd6e7f0&AdDevMode=1 \nFirst you see a short video clip \"Werbung Anfang\" (Start Ad) HLS Video, then the Ad mp4 and then \"Werbung Ende\" HLS Video.\nAfter the first video clip I have to click on play again to start the mp4 file. \nI checked out the version from the 3.x branch, I hope that was the correct branch. \nIf I check it with the chrome remote debugger, I still see 2 video tags. \n\n. no it's not solved, sorry. I asked for nativ hls support on Android to use only 1 video tag on that device, to avoid the 2nd click problem. \nOn Android you can use the normal video tag with the video URL, the blob tag is not needed. \nThen all videos run on the same video tag and you don't have to click on play again. . I use a Huawei P8 with Android 6, a Nexus 9 with Android 7 and a Kindle Fire HDX 3rd Gen. with Android 4.4.2 -> all with Chrome as Browser. \nA good way to test with Android devices is to connect your Galaxy via USB cable and open Chrome on your computer. Then you can do a remote debugging inside Chrome. . this source looks absolutely different, because it's 1 video tag with a seperate source and track tag. \nI have a new pc so I downloaded the ZIP file, after I switched to the 3.x-dev branch. I have now the feeling that the zip file has not the content this branch. Seems to be the content of the master branch, correct?\n. tomorrow, I will check out the branch via git and test again. I had no idea that the zip file is not from the branch. \nThanks for you help so far. Tomorrow I will tell you the new result. . ok this morning I made a checkout of the 3.x-dev branch via GIT, but the code of the mediaelement-and-player.js is the same as yesterday. I used Winmerge to compare my files. Must be something other that is different. \nI made only updates to the mediaelement-and-player.js file. Do I have to change something for the player initialization ? . the feature list looks fine so far:\ncancelFullScreen:()\nfullScreenEventName:\"webkitfullscreenchange\"\nhasFirefoxPluginMovingProblem:false\nhasMozNativeFullScreen:false\nhasMsNativeFullScreen:false\nhasMse:true\nhasNativeFullscreen:false\nhasTouch:true\nhasTrueNativeFullScreen:true\nhasWebkitNativeFullScreen:true\nhasiOSFullScreen:false\nisAndroid:true\nisChrome:true\nisFirefox:false\nisFullScreen:()\nisIE:false\nisSafari:false\nisStockAndroid:false\nisiOS:false\nisiPad:false\nisiPhone:false\nnativeFullScreenEnabled:true\nrequestFullScreen:(el)\nsupportsMediaTag:true\nsupportsNativeHLS:true\nsupportsPointerEvents:true\nsvg:true. oh is it possible, that my config is the problem?\nvar mediaPlayerConf = {\n                    renderers: ['native_hls', 'flash_hls','html5'],\n                    pluginPath: '../../rtli-video-player/mediaelement/3/',\n                    enablePluginDebug: 0,\n                    showPosterWhenEnded: true,\n                    alwaysShowControls: true,\n                    enableAutosize: true,\n                    features: ['playpause','stop','progress','current','duration','volume','fullscreen'],\n                    loop: false,\n                    hls: {\n                        debug: false,\n                        autoStartLoad: false\n                    },. ok found the problem. The renderers sorting is importing.\nWith this sort it works: renderers: ['html5','native_hls', 'flash_hls']. yes, I have only one video tag now under Android. I have to check now all other browsers and iPhone again until I can put it to the live server. But the Android problem seems to be solved now. :-). @ron666 I'm still in test phase, but I found out that the volume slider has a strange behavior now on my website.\nCan you see any reason for this? \nSame testlink as before: http://toggo-elex2.beta.eoa.de/videos/eoa/videokategorie-neu-566.htm?v=d37e318da49e2a724b0130a31cd6e7f0&AdDevMode=1 . I found the problem. I had to remove to top value in my css for .mejs-controls .mejs-volume-button .mejs-volume-slider .mejs-volume-handle \nand for .mejs-controls .mejs-volume-button .mejs-volume-slider .mejs-volume-current. hehe yes. It was a pilot like volume controller :-)  \nI think the testing procedure can take time until tuesday next week . I have to check the new version again with all possible browsers and that with Win10 and Win7 and Mac OSX.. After pressing on the play button the videoplayer removes the http:// from my original video source entry. This is causing an error in my VideoPlaza SDK which need URL with http:// or https:// . ah ok seems to be no problem in this case. The error come from something other in my Ad Player. . @ron666 Thanks, you can close the ticket. We double checked the player and it seems to work fine now on all our testsystems & browsers. :-). ",

    "etherElric": "Hi, \nwhen I first asked this question, I was using mediaelement 2.16 or 2.18.\nNow, with 2.20.1 and 2.22.0, I notice that the behaviour seems to have changed.\nHere is a test link : http://www.gestionradioqc.com/test/test-mediaelement.php\nIt seems that when the player starts, the currentTime is now the latest HLS segment.\nWhen I seek to 0, I actually seek to the first segment in the list. Therefore, I am rewinding to 0.\nWhich means that, now, I do not know how to get back to the latest segment...\nI tried adding another button \"seek to 300\", which seems to actually go back to the live, but that is because I know that my HLS contains 10 segments of 10 seconds each.\nTherefore, I doubt just putting a hardcoded value is a good way to go back to live...\nTherefore, how can I \"correctly\" seek to live?\nThank you,\n. @ron666 I updated my test page with mediaelement 2.22.1: https://www.gestionradioqc.com/test/test-mediaelement.php\nThe behaviour is still pretty much the same as 2.20.1 and 2.22.0:\nMy HLS live stream has 10 segments of 10 seconds each, therefore it ranges from 0 to 100 seconds of content.\nWhen I start the player, it reads second 70 (so, the 7th segment, or -3th segment).\nWhen I seek to 0, it reads second 0 (so, the first segment of the list).\nWhen I seek to 300, it reads second 90 (so, the last segment of the list).\nIs that how the implementation was intended?\nAlso, therefore, to seek to live, I still need to know the \"total length\" of the HLS segments combined in order to seek to a number higher?\nThanks a lot for your hard work!\n. Ah, I added 2 other buttons: \nSeek to 10 and Seek to 30\nAll the seek buttons that I have created basically just call mediaElement.setcurrentTime(x);\nIn the end, it seems like the seek doesn't work correctly.\nWhen seeking to 0 or to 300 (so, passed the \"max time\" contained in the HLS file), it works fine.\nBut when I start seeking to 10 and 30 and I switch back and forth, I end up trying to read invalid time. Therefore, I do not understand how setCurrentTime is supposed to work exactly when dealing with HLS.\nHere is what I did exactly:\n- Load the page, let it play for 5 seconds. (the seek bar displays 1:10 to 1:15, but current time is 70-75)\n- Press the Seek to 10 and let it play for 5 seconds. (the seek bar usually displays 00:10-00:15 along with current time: 10-15)\n- Press the Seek to 30 and let it play for 5 seconds. (the seek bar usually displays 00:30-00:35 along with current time: 30-35)\n- Repeat pressing the seek to 10 and seek to 30 buttons.\n  After some time, you should end up reading the previous segment and instead of displaying 10-15 or 30-35, it displays 0-5 | 20-25 and even ends up in the negative. At first, the negative current time still works but it doesn't take long that the negative numbers exceed the buffer and we hear nothing.\n  Seeking to 0 or 300 seams to fix the whole thing and seem to readjusts the currentTime with the HLS segments. \n  Pressing Seek to 0 always goes back to currentTime 0. \n  Pressing Seek to 300 always goes to 80 or 90 (pretty much the latest segment).\n  But pressing Seek to 10 or 30 seems to mess up along the way, as though the script was trying to compensate and calculate a seek value.\nI hope this helps a little.\n. Ah, great. I just realized that I tested with the latest release of mediaelement instead of your pull request \u00ac.\u00ac\nI'll update my tests and come back...\n\nOk, I got exactly the same behaviour.\nI have tested on Desktop Chrome 52 and 53.0.2785.89m as well as Desktop Firefox 41 (with whitelist set to true, so MSE should be blocked).\n.

However, some functions that i'm currently using in my project stops working accordingly.\nFor example the following code works perfectly fine with the build but not with the src one. Seems to work better in Firefox, compared to Chrome, but its very inconsistent.

I just didn't notice it because the videos were always played with flash. The html5 player seems to be a bit buggy overall with this.\n. @johndyer the code example in my previous post is not working consistently with the html5 player. Sometimes player2 starts playing after player1 ends, and sometimes it doesn't.

    "dazweeja": "Looks good to me. Thanks!\n. This is still an issue in 2.22.0. It occurs at line 754 of mediaelement-and-player.js when pluginType is 'youtube':\nthis.pluginApi.setSrc(mejs.Utility.absolutizeUrl(url));\nThis fails because 'this.pluginApi' is a YT.Player which doesn't have a setSrc method. It will need to be replaced with some code like this to work:\nif (this.pluginType == 'youtube') {\n  var videoId;\n  // youtu.be url from share button\n  if (url.lastIndexOf(\"youtu.be\") != -1) {\n    videoId = url.substr(url.lastIndexOf('/')+1);\n    if (videoId.indexOf('?') != -1) {\n      videoId = videoId.substr(0, videoId.indexOf('?'));\n    }\n  }\n  else {\n    // https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\n    var videoIdMatch = url.match( /[?&]v=([^&#]+)|&|#|$/ );\n    if ( videoIdMatch ) {\n      videoId = videoIdMatch[1];\n    }\n  }\n  this.pluginApi.loadVideoById(videoId);\n}\nelse {\n  this.pluginApi.setSrc(mejs.Utility.absolutizeUrl(url));\n}\nOr alternatively delete the exisiting player and create a new one. There'll be a similar issue at line 760.\n. I've been playing around some more with this and one issue is that loadVideoById from the YouTube API will autoplay regardless of the current state of the player. This seems undesirable. I implemented an event-based solution to this and then struck another issue where removeEventListener does not seem to be functional on the YouTube API. Anyway, I do have a working solution which autoplays the video if the current video is playing, or loads the video in a paused state if it's not:\n```\nif (this.pluginType == 'youtube') {\n    var videoId;\n    // youtu.be url from share button\n    if (url.lastIndexOf(\"youtu.be\") != -1) {\n        videoId = url.substr(url.lastIndexOf('/')+1);\n        if (videoId.indexOf('?') != -1) {\n            videoId = videoId.substr(0, videoId.indexOf('?'));\n        }\n    }\n    else {\n        // https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\n        var videoIdMatch = url.match( /[?&]v=([^&#]+)|&|#|$/ );\n        if ( videoIdMatch ) {\n            videoId = videoIdMatch[1];\n        }\n    }\n    / removeEventListener not working on YouTube API - see https://code.google.com/p/gdata-issues/issues/detail?id=6700 /\n    function addRemovableEventListener (player, eventName, callback) {\n        var callbackName = 'youtubeCallbackFunction' + Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 7);\n        window[callbackName] = callback;\n        player.addEventListener(eventName, callbackName);\n    return function () {\n        window[callbackName] = function () {}; // make the callback inactive\n    };\n}\nfunction onCustomStateChange(e) {\n    if (e.data == 1) {\n        removeThisListener();\n        e.target.pauseVideo();\n        e.target.seekTo(0);\n    }\n}\nif (this.pluginApi.getPlayerState() != 1) {\n    var removeThisListener = addRemovableEventListener(this.pluginApi, 'onStateChange', onCustomStateChange);\n}\nthis.pluginApi.loadVideoById(videoId);\n\n}\nelse {\n    this.pluginApi.setSrc(mejs.Utility.absolutizeUrl(url));\n}\n```\n. So much cleaner than my convoluted event method! I looked at cueVideoById but assumed it wasn't the method I needed when it clearly was.\nYour patch achieves the stated functionality. I don't mean to be a bother but does this match the HTML5 functionality? I think with with the HTML5 player if you set source and have the autoplay attribute set, it will autoplay the new video too? For the YouTube case this would mean:\nif (this.getAttribute('autoplay') !== null) {\n  this.pluginApi.loadVideoById(videoId);\n}\nelse {\n  this.pluginApi.cueVideoById(videoId);\n}\nThis needs a small tweak - which I think is a good idea regardless - to getAttribute in  mejs.PluginMediaElement.prototype so that it returns null. This works better when testing for undefined attributes in a few other places in the code:\ngetAttribute: function(name){\n  if (this.hasAttribute(name)) {\n    return this.attributes[name];\n  }\n  return null;\n},\nI'm not even sure if the YouTube autoplay of subsequent videos is a good idea but I just mention it as a consistency thing.\n. Tested and it all works fine in my use case. I was actually modifying the setSrc function at line 184 of src/js/me-mediaelements.js when developing but putting it in the earlier setSrc function in mep-player.js works just as well.\nThanks for doing all this work. It will be good to be able to use an unpatched release again!\n. ",

So it's not a problem of position in the page... The bug must come frome the mp3 audio I suppose. I will test and let your know.\n\nEDIT 2 : Well, mp3 was not the problem, or not only. It seems to depend of the logiciel I use to export from my DV source (virtualdub>yamb for the video 2 with the bug, AVS converter for the video 1). In the video information, I have this :\n- With bug :\n  MPEG4 Video (H264) [V: h264 high L5.1, yuv420p, 640x492, 1539 kb/s]\nAAC 48000Hz stereo 234kbps [A: aac lc, 48000 Hz, stereo, 234 kb/s]\n- Without bug : \n  MPEG4 Video (H264) [V: English [eng] (h264 main L5.1, yuv420p, 640x488, 2076 kb/s)]\nAAC 48000Hz stereo 193kbps [A: English [eng] (aac lc, 48000 Hz, stereo, 193 kb/s)]\nThe only difference I see is the h264 high / h264 main (i don't really know what it is), and the ratio (482/488). I tried to export a h264 \"main\" in 640*488 from virtualdub (before put it in yamb), but the result still bugs...\nI will use AVS converter for this, so the problem is kind of solved, but if someone knows what the problem was, I'm still interested (Virtualdub is more practical).\n.

    "MelAntipam": "@Ron666,\nThanks for your ultra fast answer.\nEven simpler than setting up a website: \n- here is a slightly modified version of /demo/mediaelementplayer-responsive.html from the current 2.22.0 release (package called johndyer-mediaelement-2.22.0-35-g402c35d): ar_bug-mediaelementplayer-responsive.zip\n- put it with other demos in /demo\n- open this html file with a your browser (Chrome 52 on Windows 10 in my case), you should see something like this:\n  \n- before launching the video (i.e. don't clic on the \"Play button\"), play with the browser width. The player should scale up and down following the browser window width (it's responsive). After some time, you should be able to see something like this:\n  \n. @ron666  Sorry for the late answer.\nUnfortunately, I don't think it fixes the issue. \nMy understanding is that container width and height are retrieved and set using jquery width() and height() functions that round values. It works great until you dynamically change the values which leads to an accumulation of rounding errors.  \nWhen video metadata have been received (preload=\"auto\" or video is being played for instance), the native video width and height are used instead of the container current width and height values, therefore eliminating rounding errors accumulation. \nTo try to solve it in a quick and ugly way, in my use-case only, I've replaced  the same line with: \nnewHeight = t.isVideo || !t.options.autosizeProgress ? parentWidth / t.origAspectRatio : nativeHeight;\nwhere t.origAspectRatio is the ratio width/height of the <video> tag attributes. \nThe rationale behind that is that:\n- in my use-case, the container aspect ratio is always specified in the <video> tag attributes (width and height are always set to meaningful values)\n- I expect to have identical container (player) and video  aspect ratios\n- I don't see a reason why the container aspect ratio should be changed since the video aspect ratio is not changed\n- It would probably have been a better fix to use fractional width and height values (i.e. not use jQuery width() and height() functions) instead of integers but it requires many changes in the code and I did not want to break anything.\n. @ron666 It just occured to me that this issue was already mentioned by @gvsboy in   #1714 . His fix is very similar to mine except I've not added any option.\n. @ron666 Your proposed fix does not solve the problem because the issue is mainly caused by rounding errors done when storing newHeight as a style attribute, just below your line: \n// set outer container size\nt.container.width(parentWidth).height(newHeight);\nAnd even if the height was stored as a fractional number using jQuery .css() instead of .height(), it will be rounded again when the value is retrieved, for instance by t.media.getAttribute('height') in the nativeHeight() function just above your line. \nI played with the code to try using fractional attributes but unfortunatly, it causes nasty side-effects like different heights for the container and the video tag. In addition, there is also an upscale bug that is not related to rounding issues.\nMy proposed solution to fix this issue without declaring a new option or assuming a specific use-case is the following:\n1. Store the intial aspect ratio when the player is set up in the init() function\n2. Use this intial aspect ratio to compute newHeight until media dimensions are available\n3. Remove a test that causes additional issues when increasing the browser windows width (i.e. the player is supposed to have its size increased, which means that the computed player height is larger than the current container height). I've no idea why this test exists in the first place. \nStep 1: store the initial AR in init():\nReplace:\n// set the size, while we wait for the plugins to load below\nt.setPlayerSize(t.width, t.height);\nby:\n```\n// @@ Store initial player AR: width-height attributes if available, defaultVideoWidth-defaultVideoHeight otherwise\nif (t.media.getAttribute('width') !== null && t.$media[0].getAttribute('height') !== null) {\n    t.initialAspectRatio = t.$media[0].getAttribute('height') / t.$media.attr('width');\n}\nelse {\n    t.initialAspectRatio =  t.options['default' + capsTagName + 'Height'] / t.options['default' + capsTagName + 'Width'];\n}\n// set the size, while we wait for the plugins to load below\nt.setPlayerSize(t.width, t.height);\n```\nStep 2: use this initial AR in setResponsiveMode():\nReplace:\n```\nvar parentWidth = t.container.parent().closest(':visible').width(),\nparentHeight = t.container.parent().closest(':visible').height(),\nnewHeight = t.isVideo || !t.options.autosizeProgress ? parseInt(parentWidth * nativeHeight/nativeWidth, 10) : nativeHeight;\n```\nby:\n```\n// @@ new aspectRatio function : we use media AR if received, otherwise the stored initial AR (specified or default values)\nvar aspectRatio = (function() { \n    ar = 1;\n    if (t.isVideo) {\n        if (t.media.videoWidth && t.media.videoWidth > 0 && t.media.videoHeight && t.media.videoHeight > 0) {\n            ar = t.media.videoHeight/t.media.videoWidth;\n        } else  { \n            ar = t.initialAspectRatio;\n        } \n        if (isNaN(ar) || ar < 0.01 || ar > 100) {\n            ar = 1;\n        }\n    }\n    return ar;\n})();\nvar parentWidth = t.container.parent().closest(':visible').width(),\nparentHeight = t.container.parent().closest(':visible').height(),\nnewHeight = t.isVideo || !t.options.autosizeProgress ? parseInt(parentWidth * aspectRatio, 10) : nativeHeight;\n```\nStep 3: remove a test condition in setResponsiveMode() that causes an AR bug when upscaling:\nReplace:\n// When we use percent, the newHeight can't be calculated so we get the container height\nif (isNaN(newHeight) || ( parentHeight !== 0 && newHeight > parentHeight && parentHeight > nativeHeight)) {\n    newHeight = parentHeight;\n}\nby;\n//@@ If we were unable to compute newHeight, get the container height instead\nif (isNaN(newHeight)) {\n    newHeight = parentHeight;\n}\n.

    "paulozoom": "The fix that @dayfuaim proposed doesn't really solve the issue, it just works around it. I'm implementing an audio player, and most times, the audio clips are under an hour, and in those cases, I don't want to force to show 00: before every duration, only when the audio clip really exceeds 60m. Can either @dayfuaim or @ron666 reopen this?\n. @ron666 I'm taking a look at https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/blob/master/src/js/mep-feature-time.js but can't, for the life of me, understand what's causing this. All calls to updating the duration time (or current time for that matter) are being done with mejs.Utility.secondsToTimeCode, and the options argument is always t.options, so it's not clear to me why, before hitting play, the hours aren't being shown but after play, they are.\nDo you have any clue or pointers in the right direction?\n. Further investigation, I tried this before hitting play, with preload=\"metadata\" in the <audio>.\n- Calling .media.duration on the player instance gives me 3946.6056, which is correct, but the duration shows as 05:46, not 01:05:46.\n- Manually calling .updateDuration() on the player instance doesn't produce any effect.\n- Manually calling .load() on the player instance doesn't produce any effect.\n. I was able to find the cause for the bug: https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/blob/9812c6f9530dd3e6dc5eb366b2cb5f69139ac768/src/js/mep-player.js#L766\nThe method which changes the time format is only being called on the timeupdate event, and it should also be called on the loadedmetadata event. If I manually make the calls which are in the timeupdate event, the correct duration is displayed.\nTwo options to fix this in the mep-player.js\n1. Dispatch a timeupdate event inside the loadedmetadata event.\n2. Make all the calls that are inside the timeupdate event handler also in the loadedmetadata event handler.\n@ron666 What would you rather happen?\n. Yeah, this\u2019ll do alright!\n. ",

    "tiffwyatt": "This bug seems to have reappeared? I just tested the video player on http://www.mediaelementjs.com using Safari 10.0.3 and the behaviour is exactly the same as described by knomedia in the first post on this issue.\nI can't tab through the controls of the player itself, nor can I navigate to any link after the player, because I keep losing focus and getting sent back to the first Safari tab.\nCan anyone else confirm this?\n. No, sorry, can't confirm. YouTube is working nicely in Safari, can navigate using only the keyboard without any problems. \nStrange \u2026. @ron666 Yes, will test this later today and let you know if it works. Thanks for looking into this!. Hi, sorry, took me a while to get round to testing \u2026\nBut have done so now and it's looking good! Keyboard-only navigation in Safari is working well. Also tested in Firefox (51.0.1) and Chrome (56.0.2924.87), no problems.. @ron666 As I am on a Mac I tested IE 9, 10, 11 and Edge using https://crossbrowsertesting.com. Didn't encounter any problems while navigating keyboard-only. Will test Edge on a Windows machine at my office tomorrow morning and let you know \u2013 but as far as I can see your fix is working well.. @ron666 Just tested with Edge and Chrome on Windows 7 \u2013 working well! Thanks a lot for fixing this.. @ron666 Really sorry, but I just noticed the Safari keyboard navigation bug isn't completely resolved after all. Before your fix, the behaviour was:\n\"I can't tab through the controls of the player itself, nor can I navigate to any link after the player, because I keep losing focus and getting sent back to the first Safari tab.\"\nNow, after the fix, I can tab through the controls of the player itself \u2013\u00a0that part works perfectly. The trouble is, after tabbing through the last control the focus still gets lost and is sent back to the first Safari window tab. Because of this it is impossible to ever navigate past the video/audio element to any content further down on the page \u2013 effectively a keyboard trap.\nI didn't realize this while testing, as the video was the only item on my test page.\nWould be brilliant if you could find a fix for this! Will gladly test anything you might come up with.. You can test this on http://www.mediaelementjs.com:\nStart tabbing from the top of the page and keep going until you reach the last control in the \"Big Buck Bunny\" Video (the fullscreen control). \nNow, if you press tab once more, focus should move on to the select element \"Try other media sources\" under the video. But it doesn't, instead focus gets lost. Pressing tab again moves focus up to the first Safari browser tab.\n(This is assuming your Safari browser is configured to Full Keyboard Access \u2013 http://www.weba11y.com/blog/2014/07/07/keyboard-navigation-in-mac-browsers/). @ron666 Okay, thanks!.

    "web-engineer": "Trouble with this is that I can also remove all the secure settings/headders stuff and try over plain HTTP and same problem.\nCodec should not be a problem - what is frustrating us is that this all works fine in iOS9 so something has changed but what it is we're struggling to work out.\nWe only use MP4, h256 media - baseline profile 3, FFMPEG encoder settings as follows - \nffmpeg -threads 0 -i SOURCE -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart -bufsize 3000k -profile:v baseline -level 3.0 -preset slow -crf 26 -maxrate 1500k -video_size hd480 -vf scale=642:360  -c:a aac -strict -2 -ac 2 -ab 128k -ar 44100 -r 25\nSo far tweaking these has made no difference either.\n. This sounds similar on the apple forum -\nhttps://forums.developer.apple.com/message/158745#158745\nLooks like this is a bug with apple - I'll chase them also and raise with them. Will post response if I get one... note - were using aac encoding too...\n. Another observation - in chrome the player does show, and it tries to play - but gets stuck buffering.\n. OK - last ditch attempt, just uploaded one of these videos to a test server and linked direct - it worked therefore it's go to be Apache... Was preparing an example to report to Apple, but this kinda points back to configuration still...\n. Well made some progress that further proves the problem is apache, completely mimicked the script setup on the other host (so its a stream in video tag) and it works so much be config.\nWhen Ive worked it out I'll post the solution - if we can pinpoint it!\n. Oh dear.... i've just inverted my test and tried this a few ways around ... my latest test has taken me full circle...\nWhen i disable mediaelement and just use the video tag I am getting playback, as soon as i use this enhancement it breaks and gets an error...\nI'm going to try and script a fallback to improve this - putting a simple shell together to prove the problem was not reproducing the error, this latest test I just disabled MJS and the HTML5 built in player worked ...\n. When running alongside the framework to retrieve the video stream (rather than separating out the stream code) it doesn't work - looks like the framework may be influencing the output of the http stream (its a Laravel project).\nThis has been tricky to debug - I think the trick for anyone having trouble with MJS is to try without it first and make sure your video tags would have worked - if they do then you can wag the finger, otherwise its likely, like its looking like for me, to be the video stream itself causing the problem.\n. To confirm - i reckon the reason it looks broken in my case with MJS is that MJS is validating the resource and telling us its not playable (by that device), which is why we get the error trapped - in this instance that is correct and MJS is doing its job. In iOS9 and every other browser we've tested the media does play - this still doesn't mean the problem is with the player, there must be something different about the way the stream is being interpreted by mobile Safari.\n. Solved - the fix was at the script side... \nBasically - at some point suspect it may be because of an older version (just upgraded recently to the latest tagged release) the player wasn't working and our application uses localstorage to store if the player has thrown an error and falls back to the shim player when this happens.\nProblem being that when iOS10 started not liking the player the fallback player definately wont work.\nFix was to having upgraded to current release to alter the check for fallback player use to include a timer check and to toggle the mode back if enough time had elapsed since the last fallback. This for us means that our UI should get the right player - need to investigate if/why we added this fallback code - we've quite a range of browser support so suspect there is some quirk that needed it...\nAnyway - there it is, if it helps anyone else with a similar problem... \n. Also since found the issue was related to the framework we're using not understanding the seek data sent with the requests initially, somehting has changed in iOS 9.3 or newer - we've now coded around it - if you experience the videos not playing this may be because the requests for video are subtly the latest version of iOS and in our instance this caused the server to not understand the request. The fallback issue described above was further salt in the wound as our player handler then forced the shim player too - further making it tricky to debug. \n. ",

However, when I swap the latest/tweaked mediaplayer (and when I use player.setCurrentTime and player.play) into the original served context where I found the problem, and then view that served web application on the iPad mini, things seem much improved from before .. I haven't yet seen any bad behaviors despite scrubbing the cache between loads etc., so that seems like very good news .. I'm just no expert on iOS devices, unfortunately.  I hope this is at least some help (and some good news).\nBest,\nAndrew\n. I just had 1 test out of ~25 start from 0 instead of the offset .. it was on OS X Desktop.  Not sure how much to worry about that.\n. Hi,\nMy last comment simply meant that I did ~25 tests trying to get some audio to start-for-the-first-time at sec 15 or so .. 24/25 of those tests worked great and started at 15 .. 1/25 started at 0.\nThat's great news about the emulator.\nI'm certainly no expert on web audio/video .. in fact, I don't envy your job at all .. I'm amazed how finicky it is (and how stable your player has made it) .. and I don't know what is going on under the hood of mediaelement's methods, such that setCurrentTime->play could work fine for a small-ish audio file, but I don't have any feel for if things would start to break if you were searching all the way to the end of a big audio or video file on your way to play'ing (and without much delay) .. and then I also hear/see weirdnesses that seem to crop up in iOS that I don't hit anywhere else, which also makes me nervous.\nI don't do much video, but I'll try to put together a few tests like you describe and be back in touch .. smile.\nThanks,\nAndrew\n. Hi,\nI was able to do some video and audio testing, starting at both 0 and ~25.  Has worked perfectly!\nThanks for all the help.  When do you expect to release version 3?\n. Great .. thanks.\nYes .. sorry .. didn't realize I was supposed to close it .. done.\n. ",
    "lucash": "I have created a new PR:\nhttps://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/pull/1937\n. My application is more complex than that example, it has an element with a limited width higher in the DOM. Basically what I want to achieve is that the video uses the width of its parent element. In the real application I'm not even setting stretching: 'responsive', however mediaelement is doing the same as if I would do that (setResponsiveMode is called, due to hasFluidMode() == true. Is there any better way to do that? Then I'm sorry for reporting this as a bug, I just saw that it worked before and does not work anymore now.. I have tested that and it helps for all other browsers but not for Firefox. I have some ideas how to improve the code, however I need to test them and get other things done first. Will come back to this issue in the next days.. I will have a closer look today in the evening (in european time). I've already seen #2169 and will keep it in mind.. I've just set up an pull request which will fix my issue. As far as I can see the problems from #2169 do not reoccur with these changes.\nAdditional I think that the changes from 696241dc42ac8fe4eb0853cd1e1a0ef8399f2fbb would make the previous changes for the block above with all the Firefox exceptions obsolete. Those just try to avoid parent == null (due to the error described in this comment), which is already handled by the change from that commit. However I'm not sure enough about possible side effects to propose a pull request. Maybe you can confirm my assumption?. @rafa8626 \nAt the mentioned URL neither mediaelement nor any iframes are used (if I do not miss anything). However I assume that the problem is the same as in the responsivemode:\n        if (IS_FIREFOX && window.self !== window.top) {\n            parent = window.frameElement.parentNode;\n        } else {\n            parent = t.outerContainer;\n        }\n\nIf window.self is not the same as window.top, parent is always window.frameElement.parentNode. However I'm not sure how to solve that in this case, as there is no loop that at some point will hit the <html> node.. The failing test also fails in master, thus I assume that I do not need to fix it here.. The && operator works similar: It will return the first value if that is falsey, otherwise it will return the second value. Also see MDN: Logical Operators.. Thanks, this works for me. The only point left is that the min-width does not change when resizing the containing element (e.g. due to window size changes), while the width of the video itself adapts. Making this work too would be quite nice.. Works fine, thanks for your help.\nThe issue I described above just occurs if the element gets too narrow, I will need to work around that in my software.. @rafa8626 \nThis potentially conflicts with #2312. As I wasn't able to reproduce that issue I was not able to make sure that it is not a problem. Regarding the comment in code, removing the attribute helps if you need to support iOS 3.x - maybe it is needed to suppress setting the attribute for that iOS version? I think using a poster image should not be avoided at all if an iOS device is used with native controls as current iOS versions seem to support it.. Please review. As I'm not able to reproduce above issue I won't change anything.. Sorry for the late answer. The solution for the bug you found fixed my problem. Many thanks for your quick and great help!. ",

    "milikicn": "Hi Ron,\nYes, the 3.x-dev branch has the same behavior, meaning it doesn't fire 'pause' event.\nJust to be clear, I don't think this is a bug, it is just that interacting with Youtube timeline is not completely replicated here. The way MediaElements works is it invokes 'seekTo(seconds)' method of Youtube API. As a consequence of invoking this method, video will start playing from the new position and 'onStateChange' event handler will be invoked by the Youtube API by sending the code for 'playing' event.\nBut when you interact with Youtube's interface, more specifically with it's timeline, once you mouse press on the timeline, it invokes 'onStateChange' event handler and sends 'pause' event code. Once you release the mouse, it again invokes 'onStateChange' event handler and sends 'playing' event code.\nThus, I think MediaElements just needs to emulate this behavior of firing 'pause' event on mouse click on the timeline. Or if we don't want to monitor for the mouse click event, then just to fire 'pause' before firing 'playing' event.. Yes, I can see it now, don't know how I missed it in the first place. I see now that MediaElements API has changed a bit. For instance, event does not carry video time, only a timestamp. But I will dive more into the changes of this soon to be release. \nI'll close this issue. Thanks for the help and for this library! . ",

And This issue is also persistent with their API, so i guess that's something related to Youtube JS API itself.. Hi,\n   Sorry i forgot to post, but i have posted it now. Between i added a small fall back that places youtube iframe (with play pause events) in case of ucbrowser mobile with same layers (excluding control layer that show progress bar) that you are using in Media element (i'm taking about poster, play and pause screen overlay on video). Although it wasn't perfect but it did the job for me.\nBetween one small request, for video progress bar, right now you are using pixels to show video progress bar and the progress status. So whenever user switches the phone orientation during watching video, the bar looks small or big(depending on the orientation size it changed from) And that is something i can't override with Javascript or CSS). So in future version can you use simply percentages for progress bar's progress status rather than pixels for maximum flexibility.\nBetween your Plugin is awesome. Great work you did on it.. Ah yes that's perfect then. The version you are testing is probably from 3x branch, i found this issue in previous version. So that's perfect.\nCheers,. ",

Here's the fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/9ghv61fj/\nSeems like the cdn is having old version of mediaelementplayer.js as \"hideVideoControlsOnLoad\" is not working.\nCan you update the files in cdn? I dont have any https server to host the js and css.\nHere's a screen recording of the issue https://sendvid.com/448sjmhb. Tried the latest build and the bug is gone. Thanks for fixing the bug and prompt response.. ",
    "arsteam": "Thanks for the fast reply!\nProblem is our customers use Windows (mostly Windows 7 and 10)\nAnd they run this Version of IE11 on it, nothing we can realy do about it.\nI testet it again with the Browsers from Microsoft itself and the first on from this page:\n(https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/Internet-Explorer-11-for-Windows-7-details.aspx)\nHas the same Version as our customer has (and the same issue)\nI could install and run it on an Windows 10 Desktop PC with no trouble.\nAnd reproduce the issue.. Sry no clue what you mean?!\nWhat consul?. ",
    "neonaut": "Just as a side note: I noticed that babel-loader is a devDependency but i could not find out why. babel-loader itself peer-requires webpack which is not used at all here. . The PR only allows you to require files from within src/js/ in another browserify but does not allow you to require the prebuilt files from build/ which is what I was initially aiming for. So it is a different issue.. Works like a charm. Thanks!\nI am not sure if it is good to use the unminified source as the main entry though. I think most people would prefer the smaller file instead (medialement-and-player is not the smallest of \"libraries\"), but I'm not too confident on that.\nAlso I would suggest dropping the /path/to/ from the Usage documentation. Usually you should not need that when installing it with e.g. npm.\nNow you almost any combination works (for me):\nCustom build from source\njavascript\n// polyfill file might not be needed when using some other polyfilling in your build\n//require('mediaelement/src/js/utils/polyfill');\nrequire('mediaelement/src/js/core/mediaelement');\nrequire('mediaelement/src/js/core/i18n');\nrequire('mediaelement/src/js/languages/de');\nrequire('mediaelement/src/js/languages/zh-cn');\nrequire('mediaelement/src/js/renderers/html5');\nrequire('mediaelement/src/js/library');\nrequire('mediaelement/src/js/player');\nrequire('mediaelement/src/js/features/fullscreen');\nrequire('mediaelement/src/js/features/playpause');\nrequire('mediaelement/src/js/features/progress');\nrequire('mediaelement/src/js/features/time');\nrequire('mediaelement/src/js/features/tracks');\nrequire('mediaelement/src/js/features/volume');\nES5, all\n```javascript\n// all unminified, as documented\nrequire('mediaelement/all');\n// all unminified, using main entry\nrequire('mediaelement');\n// all unminified, using explicit path\nrequire('mediaelement/build/mediaelement-and-player.js');\n// all minified, using explicit path\nrequire('mediaelement/build/mediaelement-and-player.min.js');\n```\nES5, standalone\n```javascript\n// standalone unminified, as documented\nrequire('mediaelement/standalone');\n// standalone unminified, using explicit path\nrequire('mediaelement/build/mediaelement.js');\n// standalone minified, using explicit path\nrequire('mediaelement/build/mediaelement.min.js');\n```\nES2015, all\n```javascript\n// all unminified, as documented\nimport 'mediaelement/all';\n// all unminified, using main entry\nimport 'mediaelement';\n// all unminified, using explicit path\nimport 'mediaelement/build/mediaelement-and-player.js';\n// all minified, using explicit path\nimport 'mediaelement/build/mediaelement-and-player.min.js';\n```\nES2015, standalone\n```javascript\n// standalone unminified, as documented\nimport 'mediaelement/standalone';\n// standalone unminified, using explicit path\nimport 'mediaelement/build/mediaelement.js';\n// standalone minified, using explicit path\nimport 'mediaelement/build/mediaelement.min.js';\n``. btw. this is my workaround for #1999. The problem for me is, that if you only use ES6importyou cannot expose jQuery aswindow.$` before importing mediaelement. Instead you currently have to something like:\n```javascript\nimport $ from 'jquery';\n// expose jQuery for mediaelement\nwindow.$ = $;\nrequire('mediaelement/all');\n```\nThis does not work, because of how ES6-imports work:\njavascript\nimport $ from 'jquery';\nwindow.$ = $; // will be executed after the imports so \u2026\nimport 'mediaelement/all'; // \u2026 medialement does not have \"access\" to the $ from above\nThis would be the desired option:\njavascript\nimport 'mediaelement/all';\n which then should require/import jQuery itself..

Okay, so the theme I am using utilizes gulp to store icons in separate SVG files. Upon build (this is Jekyll) with gulp, I am able to tell it to gulp the icons which takes all of my separate icons and thrusts them into one single file in the _includes of my site. No Surprise, this is called icons.svg.\nSo the first thing I tried was taking the mejs svg file I found here on GitHub and put it in as a file mejs-controls.svg. Running gulp icons I find that the icons are added into my main icons.svg as follows\n\nOutput here\n\n```\n.cls-1{fill:url(#linear-gradient)}.cls-2{fill:#fff}YouTube-logo-full_color-1\n```\n\n\nI'd imagine this falls way outside the bounds of the scope of mejs itself. But I'm going to try to figure out a way to input the mejs icons into this workflow, so that they can be called from where all of my other svgs are called from.\nHowever, I'm amenable to doing as you suggest. I see what ya mean, I just am not entirely confident in my ability to side load in the svg sheet within this sites framework which I am only just learning (what with all of this gulp magic going on that I am only now learning to use.

Hi\nIts happening in any default wordpress theme. I downloaded wp 4.8 from the nightly bleed.  Tested also commercial themes and it happens the same.\nhttps://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\n\nlooking forward to your solution :-). Note: I have to add that I dont know that wp 4.8 is using your latest version of media elements. But above results are what i get. Maybe you can shine your light on this. Thank you for doing so.\nShould i post this at wordpress?. Hi Rafael\nThank you for the reply.  I have posted this just also on wp core as the more i think about it the more i believe that it might be related to wp? https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40788#ticket\nYou might see them reply also.\nThank you for keeping me posted in case you find something.. @rafa8626  \nI can confirm that replacing the mediaelement-and-player.min.js file in the wp-includes/je/mediaelement folder with MEJS 4.1.1 fixes the issue.\nNow the question is how do we get the WP Core  Team to adapt this fix.\nThank you for resolving this.\n. @rafa8626 \nActually patch v222 wp uses is also easy i guess. Just add this at line  3038  in the mediaelement-and-player.js                \nif (t.isVideo) {parentWidth=parentWidth-1;};\nSo you get this\n\nI dont know if it is a good solution but it works also.\n**Update: However this creates a weird issue when a plugin is using new MEJS player.min file when a video in the page content is using the new code and the sidebar or footer is using the old js.\nThen the video in the sidebar or footer has incorrect height.\nSo better WP updates to the latest MEJS file !**\n. The moment wp loads mejs v 222 and the theme loads mejs v 4.1.1 there are weird issues. The video in the sidebar suddenly is having wrong width and height. So one has to unload the wp scripts if newer versions are loaded. Its better that wp starts following latest build of mejs. But they are always so slow to update their 3rd party scripts....\nI will tell the rest of the world to star your github plugins\n. Hi Rafael\nI am sorry but I have to reopen this... as replacing the script in the wp js mediaelements folder with the one from version 4.1.1 does result in wp not loading the elements scripts anymore and revert to default video layout.\n\nSo that solution does not work.\nThe problem we have is that we either need to fix the js file wp is using or get wp to use the latest media elements files as when i have two versions of the script loaded (one in the theme using the new mejs and wp using the v 221) at the same time in one page the video in the sidebar (the one wp is loading by the wigdet) doubles in size.\n\nThere is no way to unload the wp-mediaelements and have them load the latest one. The filter only allows unloading it but not enqueueing a new version which would fix the issue. At least i haven found one.\nThis causes me to keep on using the older version in the theme and revert all my changes. But then the one pix issue is back.\nSo far wp did not respond at all to the ticket created.\nAny thoughts on this?\n. I think it all comes down to this....https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39686\nThey just marked the 1px thread to a duplicate. Which is not... Apparently they dont understand the issue reported.. Thank you for investigating !. Hi Rafael,\nThank you for fixing this. Its working now !\nHave a great day !\n. I am sorry but it still does not work. :-(. Hi\nit seems to be related to the video.

    "Instagit": "Version 3.1.0 fixes it. Thank you!. I starred the project some time ago. Great video player, thanks. :)\nI can reproduce this on the demo video on your website with Linux and Windows 10, Chrome and Firefox. I can't provide a URL, because I'm working on it locally. The code is here:\nhttps://github.com/nextcloud/files_videoplayer/tree/mediaelement\nbut it's exactly the same on your website.\n. I should have included my cursor in the screenshots. ;) Just start the video and move the cursor across the timeline. At some point, the mejs__time-float element jumps to the end of the timeline.. Yeah, it's fixed. Thank you!. I tested it on current Chrome versions with Linux and Windows 10 on the demo video on your website. I'll upload an animated GIF later. Might also be related to video acceleration or something like that.\nThe video needs to be playing for this to happen.. This GIF shows this issue and this on http://www.mediaelementjs.com/.\n. Yes, this is also fixed. Thanks!. That makes sense. :) Thanks.\nDesktop video players usually only start from the beginning after you release the forward key. Maybe that's an optimization to consider.. Thanks again for the fast update!\nThe issue is fixed for me in Chrome, Firefox, Edge and IE11. Now I can also see the volume bar when changing the volume with keyboard shortcuts. :+1: \nWhen clicking on the timeline and then using the left/right arrow keys to go forward/backward, the timeline doesn't become visible. That seems like a bug, because normally the UI becomes visible when using the shortcuts.\nAnd when changing the volume with shortcuts, the volume bar is only visible when the timeline has focus.\n. Seems good! One more thing: When changing the volume with the up and down arrow keys, the volume bar doesn't disappear again.. Sure. Here's the behavior when changing the volume with the mouse. Volume bar disappears when the mouse leaves the element.\n\nWith the keyboard, it stays there, because the event doesn't trigger.\n\n. It's not a big issue, I just expected it to disappear after a second or so. If it's supposed to be like this that's fine, too. Thanks again! I'll close this.. My URL won't work for you, because Youtube creates a custom URL for every user. You could use a Youtube downloader. Or if you have access to ffmpeg, you can easily create a test video:\nffmpeg -f lavfi -i rgbtestsrc -pix_fmt yuv420p -t 36000 -vcodec h264 rgbtestsrc.mp4\nThis is the video I tested with.. Great! Thanks again! :). No problem at all, this isn't an urgent issue. I'll try to fix it, but it's probably going to be next week or so.. No, I didn't have time to work on it yet.. I'm looking into it today.. When I do npm install and run grunt, I get different builds even without making any changes. No idea why and I don't want to create pull requests with possibly wrong builds, so I will list the proposed changes here.\nCaptions usability: Give labels 100% width to make clicking easier.\nmediaelementplayer.css:593\ncss\n.mejs__captions-selector-list-item,\n.mejs__chapters-selector-list-item {\n    color: #fff;\n    cursor: pointer;\n    display: block;\n    list-style-type: none !important;\n    margin: 0 0 6px;\n    overflow: hidden;\n    padding: 0;\n}\nmediaelementplayer.css:619\ncss\n.mejs__captions-selector-label,\n.mejs__chapters-selector-label {\n    cursor: pointer;\n    float: left;\n    font-size: 10px;\n    line-height: 15px;\n    padding: 4px 10px 0;\n    width: 100%;\n}\nNow I'll try to find out why the captions selector breaks after one click.. Ok I found it. The setTrack method must set focus back to the player element (mep_0 etc). When the focus is on the input element, the next click doesn't work.\nAdding this to setTrack works fine, but you probably have a better way to implement it:\njavascript\nsetTimeout(function() {\n    document.getElementById('mep_0').focus();\n}, 1000);. How to get the current player ID, i.e. mep_0? I'm sure there's a method for that somewhere.. Adding this to the end of setTrack works nicely, but I don't know if it's the best way to fix it.\njavascript\nsetTimeout(function() {\n    t.container.focus();\n}, 1000);\nI'd add a little delay so the selected track is visible before disappearing.. Yes, that's better! :+1: Are captions supposed to be selectable with the keyboard? That doesn't work, but it's not a problem.. I got it to work once, but don't even know how. When hovering the captions icon and using arrow up/down the volume controls come up.. Ok, that works.. Done. Thanks again! :) I think this is now a good version to test for Nextcloud.. You can remove or add elements from the list mejs__captions-selector-list.. Yeah, I don't think there's a method for that, but you can build the elements manually. Shouldn't be too difficult with jQuery or some library.\nMaybe you can use detectSubs() from this file as guidance. I use it to detect subtitles and build a track list from them, but you can modify it to build list elements instead.. Still waiting for feedback myself, but it looks like it's fixed. Thanks!. It seems the problem is not fixed. You can test it with the current index.html demo.\nUse these files for poster and video source:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/bXXc1ak.jpg\nhttps://fpdl.vimeocdn.com/vimeo-prod-skyfire-std-us/01/2186/7/185934320/614199676.mp4?token=1509998633-0xcc55b5b7b51be1f4d19678f92059f94a3d23371d\nYou can decrease the network speed in the Chrome development tools to make the bug more visible (as it will take longer before the video starts).. The problem is that mejs__poster mejs__layer is set to display: none before the video starts.. https://github.com/mediaelement/mediaelement/blob/master/build/mediaelement-and-player.js#L4850\nRemoving that event listener fixes the problem for me.. Even with the mentioned listener removed, the problem still occurs in Safari when autoplay is disabled by the browser (which I think is now the default). There are probably other events (preload?) that trigger the same behaviour. I'll try to find and post them here.. Apparently Safari fires play and playing events even when autoplay is disabled by the website settings... it's not really preventing autoplay, but pausing at the first frame or something like that, I guess to detect if there's an audio track.

    "anomaly-stalker": "Fixed! Thank you! . \nJust add hideVideoControlsOnLoad: true to player settings into the demo.js. Yes. After that do not interact with the player until the controls panel will not be hidden. And then try to show it back.. Thank you. The player behavior become better! However in the fullscreen mode, after the controls were hidden one should click on the player to show them back. And such click pauses playback. It would be great if controls will show after the mouse move. But this is minor.\nThank you again!. I found that was my mistake. When I'm initializing player via setSrc method everything works perfectly!. For point 1, If I will not call 'pause', then the video playback continues, but the gallery will show another item. For example, a user starts watching the video (the first element of the gallery), then after playback was started he switches the gallery to another item. In such case, video playback will not be stopped, but a user will not see the video.. \nUse case:\nI have a number of video files youtube, flv, mp4. Initially, the gallery contains a set of thumbnails.\nWhen the user clicks on the thumbnail, the new instance of MediaElement is created and in success callback 'play' method is called. if a user hovers over another gallery item then current video should be paused and another thumbnail (or video if a user has already clicked on it) will be shown.. @ron666 this is not a case for me :-(\nI have different instance of MediaElement for each gallery item.\nThis issue meets only in youtube videos.\nThis example is close to the real case: http://codepen.io/anomaly-stalker/pen/pRYbbX\n1. Hover over the first thumbnail\n2. Wait a couple of seconds and click on the player\n3. Then immediately hover over another gallery item.\nThen if you hover over the first item again the first player with youtube video will not respond to user interaction.\n. I found the root reason: YoutubeApi sometimes does not call onStateChange event for called \" youTubeApi.pauseVideo();\". ",

I was able to \nwork with the \"play playing - 'user time rail click' - play playing\" \nwith YouTube, and the \"playing - user time rail click - playing\" with \nmp4 in mediaelement v2.\nIn v3 I think the main thing for me is that you don't repeat the \nsequence \"play pause playing play pause playing\" or such, or, I would be \nhaving to resort to some sort of timeout - it completely clunks the \nanimation and transitions in my implementation.\nI'll test tm.

    "dmongrel": "Hi @ron666 , \nI've read all the docs, install, migration, api guide, etc.  I am using the renderers configuration, and it is in fact set exactly as you have suggested.  From what I've seen in the source, however, this array is only a list that will be checked against, and it can still fail.  If I use the demo and a standard media URL like http://hostname:port/filename.mp4, it works fine.\nWith my streaming servlet URL (which works in 2.x), it will fail in the 3.x demo.  The URL is like http://hostname:port/servlet/Stream?id=123fdsgeERGsg454&otherparams=values....  Essentially when the URL doesn't contain an extension in it, it still comes up with \"No Renderer Found\", even if the type is set as 'video/mp4'.\nThere are no other error messages or exceptions being thrown, so the check is probably working as designed--though it's incomplete for my use case,  I'll see if I can update or rip out the render checker and force it to work in a fork, and see about making it an option.  \nEdit:  I took a look at renderer.js and instead of returning null, I return:\nlet renderer = this.renderers['html5'];\n        return {\n            rendererName: renderer.name,\n            src: mediaFiles[0].src\n        };\nWhich let's my URL work.  Anyhow, thanks for responding Ron.. I don't have a public URL, and I had to switch back to reiniting the player, however, I will see if I can get it up in a gist using the demo or something else small.\nIn the meantime if you set your features as:\nvpClass.vid = new MediaElementPlayer('myVideo', {\n...\nfeatures: ['playpause', 'current', 'progress', 'duration', 'tracks', 'volume', 'fullscreen', 'time']\n...\nwith the player initialized on a video element with tracks,\ncall vpClass.vid.rebuildtracks(); and then the features will be in the order:  'playpause', 'current', 'progress', 'duration', 'volume', 'fullscreen', 'time', 'tracks'.\nAgain, I'll try to get an example of this problem working for you.. @ron666 thanks.  I will take a look at it this weekend.  Sorry I couldn't get an example up for you earlier.. @ron666 Yes, this is exactly what I needed.  It retains control position without having to do a full re-init of the player.  Thanks much!  For the record, I start with my video player blank, with an empty source in my video element, with a dummy track.  So for anyone who is trying to work with setSrc and DOM manipulated/added track elements:\nInit the player (as you normally would) then do the following:\nplayer.setSrc(url);\nplayer.load();\nReplace your track elements:  Since MEJS wraps the video element, append your tracks to <videlementid>_<renderer>, e.g. myVideo_html5\nplayer.cleartracks(player);\nplayer.rebuildtracks();\n. Sorry, attempting to update my branch.. Thanks @ron666.  The .066666 represents the number of drop frames to drop on the minute marks.  Essentially 6%.  You need to calc it as a decimal like this for accuracy before turning it into an integer.\nThe conversions are based on pseudocode from:\n//Code by David Heidelberger, adapted from Andrew Duncan\nWhile there is no explicit license on his blog, http://www.davidheidelberger.com/blog/?p=29 I did want to ask you about properly attributing this (I figured a readme.txt addition would be appropriate).  Let me know how you think we should handle it.\nWith regards to the tests, if you want to fix them up, that would be fine, my answers to the three failed ones are:  1) edit: caused by truncating vs rounding errors in original test values.  2)  I suspect this is caused by  the format conversion being incomplete.  SMPTE is usually seen in it's four-pair form.  3)  For frames, it doesn't make much sense to have fractional (.decimal) frames.  In SMPTE while it looks like time, the purpose is simply to give each frame a unique identifier.  The dropframe support is to make it align with a realtime clock, but the purpose is just labelling.  So the toFixed functions were set to (0).  If people wanted MM:SS and MM:SS.sss, that makes sense, so perhaps what I changed hampers that ability?\nLet me know if you need more info., or if I really need to get my hands dirty on the tests.. On a side note, what's the best way to run the tests in my local environment for MEJS?  Looking at the tests themselves, I can probably come up with something a bit more robust, and make sure the drop frame side gets tested properly.. @ron666 - Regarding the tests:\nThe first test which failed is due to rounding errors when creating the test values.  The actual values that come up, are off by a frame due to the original code probably truncating the value instead of rounding.  \nThe second test revealed a minor bug where I returned frames instead of seconds (and it would partially affect the third test).  \nThe third test, \"can show numeric value with decimals when fps is indicated\" is no longer valid since I return toFixed(0).  We should ask the community perhaps if anyone needs the FF component with .decimals?  To keep the feature we could adapt the timeformat option to allow for HH:MM:SS:FF.sss, or simpler yet, add an option for ffNumberOfDecimals, which would just go directly into the toFixed() call.  I could use 0 they can use 3, default 0.  This choice will determine how the third failed test gets handled. \nShould we cancel this PR, and I can put up the fixed bug, along with the updated test values?  We could then discuss implications/resolution for the .decimal function of timeCodeToSeconds and the third test?  . @ron666 Looks like everything passed.  Once I can get npm to run the test in my environment I'll create some more specific dropframe-related tests.  That really only leaves the topic regarding FF.sss in the display and whether to leave it off or create an option for it.. OK, I will look into it Sunday.. @ron666 Not sure how the builds became a conflict, but the final changes I've uploaded add a user option:  secondsDecimalLength.  If frames are NOT shown, then the seconds value will show the number of decimal places.  Default = 0, no max, though 2 or 3 is probably optimal.

    "Jezza": "Not if a fallback kicks in, and that's also assuming your users only use chrome.\nAnd even then, download button doesn't always show up.. It would be a lot easier with just some code inlined, instead of a renderer.\nWith the download as a renderer, there's some workarounds within that you have to do as well, as the renderer is expected to have a number of functions implemented on the returned value from create.. Basically, to get it to fail, you just add any type that mejs doesn't support.\nIn our case, it was just a mov.\nI'll give it a shot, and report back.. Yeah, sorry.\nWe had a slight emergency at work, and ended up spending most of the day working with that.\nSorry about that.\nHad a glance at the code, and it seems fine.\nThe only functional difference between my download renderer and the replacement code, is that the renderer offers a link for each of the sources.\nSo, if you had an mp4, and an avi, it'll link both of them with their names as the text, and the mimetype as the title.\nhtml\nDownload:\n<a href=\"source.mp4\" title=\"video/mp4\">source.mp4</a>\n<a href=\"source.avi\" title=\"video/x-msvideo\">source.avi</a>\nIf you want to go down that road, that would be great, if not, I'd still be willing to test the code on Monday, and give any more feedback, but I'd probably still have to use the renderer, so by no means do I expect you do implement the renderer's functionality.. I mean, practically, no.\nThe only reason it's even there, was for testing purposes, and I just forgot to remove it.\nI only mentioned it because I had some of the html on hand, and felt an obligation to explain why it was there. :)\nBut yeah, it's not necessary at all.\n.

I am closing this in favour of new PR on src file.\nTest url http://tinyurl.com/y7m2gkws. I'll let you know next week as I am not in office till then.  I can not test it before. But by looking at your proposal, I think it will not work because you'll always get the value from parseFloat(parentStyles.width). As I have mentioned parseFloat(parentStyles.width) does not always equals to browser window width, thus we do not get the desired result (Full Width Stretching).\nBut may be:\njavascript\nparentWidth = (t.options.fullWindowWidth) ? (window.innerWidth || document.documentElement.clientWidth || document.body.clientWidth) : parseFloat(parentStyles.width);\n. Hmm, I have copied your code and set up a test page here http://bit.ly/2wfy8zw , Since the video is no visible I can not confirm your solution is working.

OK, let me test.. It's not worked in master branch.\nI also update hls.js to v0.8.2, but still not worked too.\n. ",

Unfortunately I still seem to be experiencing the issue.  \nSteps to reproduce follow.\n\nLoad up an hls video using the player.\nEnsure you click the scrubber to a point that is not loaded so that the video will start loading once more.\nMove cursor to the pause / play button at the bottom right (or to wherever its configured in your controls )\nclick button repeatedly while the hls video is loading.\n\nMy hls stream is a private video from vimeo. \nHope this helps! Just let me know if you have any other questions. I also really appreciate you working on the fix.\n. Unfortunately I am still experiencing the issue. The below are the exact two errors that I get \n\n\nUncaught (in promise) DOMException: The play() request was interrupted by a new load request.\nThis happens when i try to scrub to a point that is not yet loaded when the video is still loading.\nPoints to buffer-controller.js:135\n\n\nUncaught (in promise) DOMException: The play() request was interrupted by a call to pause().\nThis happens when I click the play / pause button in the bottom left while the video is still loading. \nPoints to localhost/:1\n\n\nHopefully this helps \ud83d\udc4d . This also may help.\n\n. Thanks a ton, I will test today and let you know.. Based on my testing it looks as though the issue has been resolved.\nThanks a ton!. Here is a video that better demonstrates the problem.\nThanks in advance!. Yup I'm using both those attributes.. Using those attributes does in fact allow the video to play inline. Unfortunately, it won't actually play it properly in the player, it just shows what looks like the video poster in the inline player.. Yup I have placed both attributes on the video tag..

Unfortunately that didn't seem to do anything.. Hmm i'm a little confused. I checked youtube.com on the iPhone and i noticed that the video does in fact play inline using the standard html5 video player at first. This isn't the case with mediaelement.js, the video player wont actually show any playing video not fullscreen in a non native way.. Sorry for the late reply @rafa8626 . It was crunch time when I sent along this bug and my brain was a bit in shambles. \nYou were completely correct. It seems that is the native functionality for iOS when it comes to video, my brain was too fried to realize that, that was the case. \nThanks for the prompt reply as always!. ",

I just tried the master and the same error, you could still try the same page.. The error occurs in the load not in instantiation, in the test page I'm not using the library, I'm just loading it. If you need i could try to generate a jsfiddle with a basic test escenario with async loading, tell me ... thanks !!!. \ud83d\udc4d . I have not tried anything else, have you found anything? Why did you close the error? of course im follower of mediaelement ^^. i try again with the master ? or would you like an jsfiddle?. jejeje, with the current version of master now works without any error but some different renders between 4.1 series and 4.2 take a look the bottom bar of player and the icon of play in center of video:\n4.1:\n\n4.2:\n\n. Hi again, i update the source to master again and the render issue persist like my previous post. It doesn't work, i will create a jsfiddle with basic escenario ... i create tomorrow and i send you an uri, thanks !!. Hi again @rafa8626, i replicate my escenario en a basic jsfiddle, when you click on \"Mostrar video\" opens a dialog showing the video but with bad renders.\n\nIt should show like 4.1 series:\n\nAgain if i move dependency to 4.1.3 it works as expected. . jajajaa, my bad ... here is: http://jsfiddle.net/outaTiME/yd0nx1yp/. I took master and still not working =( \nBut I didn't make any changes of styles or anything, something may be changed from version 4.1 to this correct?. And more, if you simply change the version to 4.1.3 everything works perfectly. ok, I need to review ext-js styles but which should use instead of display: block ?. you should not you prioritize your display: flex over my styles?. @rafa8626 awesome, it works !!! But I'm afraid that tomorrow you'll restructure the player styles and stop working again ... thank you for your dedication and time !!!. \ud83c\udf89 . ",

I'm guessing this might be because of the additional CSS I've added, but thought it might be worth flagging as it only happens with the new version.\n-Dan.

I tried playing video in http://www.mediaelementjs.com/ by selecting source as RTMP. There also I am facing the Problem 1 and the play button is not converted to pause button while playing video..

For non-developer guys this might be interesting.. Yeah, it does show the poster attribute in the code example, but it's nowhere explained what it does. Maybe a short paragraph, or even a dedicated example, that says what this is all about? \nSame with customizing CSS: the link to the file is shown, but how you can actually customize it, nowhere.

I created a user so you can check:\ndemo.rocstar.tv\nuser: debugger\npass: mediaelement\n. You can test by accessing any of the items on the first carousel. All those contents are live and hls.. Play one of those contents while having console and/or network tab open. You'll see Fetch messages for both .m3u8 and .ts files. When you go back or navigate somewhere else, content loading should stop but it doesn't. Furthermore, if you access another content on that carousel you'll see that there are Fetch logs for both contents, the one you closed and the one you're watching. My best guess is that once async hls fetching starts it doesn't stop until buffer's full. Regardless of what I do.... As you said, when the video is paused this occurs as well but I don't think that's necessarily an issue because you could pause to allow the player to buffer, if you have a bad internet connection for example. My issue is that I can't stop destroyed, removed players from loading fragments.. the only thing that stops the load is refreshing the screen.. English keeps it universal, but thanks for the offer! \nI changed the autoplay in hls to false but I experience the same behavior. \nI updated to v4.1.3 earlier today, but I saw no controls or navigation. Plus I couldn't pause the video so I immediately went back to 4.1.2.. Ok, I'll update and create a separate frontend version so you can test it. I'll let you know.. Here's the 4.1.3 version: http://iday.rocstar.tv/\nThe first time you access a content controls work fine, but as you navigate to another player they fail. I believe the problem with this version is that state.player.remove() is not defined. Did you change the remove method for this version?\ncomponentWillUnmount() executes when a component is being removed. I checked on componentWillMount() and all those methods, stopLoad, destroy and remove, work. On unmount, of course I don't see the video stopping because it already did, but I see the player being removed and as I said, on v4.1.2 there are no errors.. This is the code I use to remove the player\njavascript\ncomponentWillUnmount() {\n        if(this.state){ \n        // If player exists\n          if (this.state.player) {\n              this.state.player.pause();\n              // If player is reproducing hls\n              if(this.state.player.media.hlsPlayer){\n                this.state.player.media.hlsPlayer.stopLoad();\n                this.state.player.media.hlsPlayer.destroy();\n              }\n              try{\n                this.state.player.remove();\n              }catch(e){\n                console.log(e);\n              }\n          }\n          var videos = document.getElementsByTagName('video');\n          for( var i = 0, total = videos.length; i < total; i++ ){\n            try{\n              videos[i].parentNode.removeChild(videos[i]);\n            }catch(e){\n              console.log(e);\n            } \n          }\n        }\n    }\nOn version 4.1.3 this method:  this.state.player.remove(); throws an error that just says error.. > componentWillUnmount() is invoked immediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed. Perform any necessary cleanup in this method, such as invalidating timers, canceling network requests, or cleaning up any DOM elements that were created in componentDidMount\nOfficial docs. In React you don't remove a component. You update the state and React figures out if a component, in this case the player, is no longer needed thus it unmounts it. Before it is unmounted the method componentWillUnmount() is executed.. I use redux to handle state so I dispatch an action. In order to imitate that exact behavior you need react and redux. It should be the same as calling a function... but maybe not.. Yes, I believe that's the problem with v4.1.3. The method destroy() throws a plain \"error\" with no details. Do you have any idea why?\nOn v4.1.2 this works fine, no errors, and I still can't stop the player from loading fragments. \nThis behavior is not new, it's been happening at least for a 2 months (with it's corresponding versions).. How can I verify that the player has been destroyed? I assume it was because the video goes back to its default HTML5 video skin.  . It turns out the player was not being removed, not even with 4.1.2. The remove method throws this error: \n\"No renderer found\". \nI didn't see it before because it was in a try/catch block. I don't know why I get that error though.. Any ideas?. Awesome work! I'll give it a spin when it's ready and let you now. Thanks!. The remove method throws no errors now, but as I exit and access another content with a player, the event listener gets triggered but this time. 'this' is null, check below:\n The function success is used the same way you used it in the code above. \njavascript\n success(media, node) {\n  media.addEventListener('play', (e)=>{\n    // Since `this` is null it throws an error     \n    this.playControl('play');\n      });\n}\nAlso chunks are still being loaded. I'm using v4.1.3 with the manual update you requested. I do see player controls now. I set it up for you to check here: iday.rocstar.tv\n. Yes. I'm setting the player in the state, thus that's where it should be but it's not. Even though this line this.setState({player: new MediaElementPlayer(\"rcsPlayer\", playerOptions)}); has already been executed.\nIf it was wrong, it would fail the first time I execute it as well.\nThe bind(this) is used on the constructor to make a function available during component render, but this is not the case.\nI don't understand what's really going on. I tested it several times, and it doesn't always fail. Sometimes it throws no errors but still, chunks keep being loaded. . Go to: iday.rocstar.tv and in Chrome dev tools, sources, hit ctrl+p and search for rcs-mediaelement.js.\nThat's the entire code, you can debug it from there as well.. Sure. I have a hunch, I think that fragments are loaded until the buffer's full. Maybe setting a very small buffer when unmounting will do the trick. \nSomething I just picked up on, is the fact that if you access a content, lets say 'channel A', and close it (click on volver), it actually stops loading. If you open a different content after (without refreshing), for example, 'channel B', you'll see it somehow resumes loading channel A. As you close channel B (click on Volver), you'll see there's not stopping Channel A chunks now, but Channel B has stopped.\nIf you open a third channel, channel C, logs show that all three content chunks are being loaded. Hit volver button and channel C stops but channel A and B never do... After some time, .ts chunks stop being loaded for all channels. I assume due to buffer being full but .m3u8 lists never stop loading.\n. I'm using create react app too. How are you testing the unmounting? Switching sources works fine, I believe hls.js is not being properly removed. Keep in mind refreshing stops fragment download. I'm going to try and focus on hls.js, I'm sure that's where the behavior originates... I see no errors and everything works great otherwise though... \nDoes the player.remove() method handle hlsPlayer too?. Ok, so I'm going to test your example entirely and see how it goes... thanks for your help!. Solved it. It was a problem handling state. Content source's reducer was not being properly reset thus they kept accumulating. Thank you for your help. I have stared the repositories already. I'll be testing chromecast and air-play plugins soon. \nWhen you patch v4.1.3 it'll be as v4.1.4? Do I wait for that version to update??\nThanks!. Sounds awesome! I'll test it tomorrow! Is there an npm version or should I copy the build to my node_modules medialement's folder?. I did everything as you requested, or at least I tried. As I access the player I get the following error:\ncast_framework.js:56 Uncaught DOMException: Failed to execute 'registerElement' on 'Document': Registration failed for type 'google-cast-button'. A type with that name is already registered.\n    at a (http://www.gstatic.com/cast/sdk/libs/sender/1.0/cast_framework.js:56:39)\n    at http://www.gstatic.com/cast/sdk/libs/sender/1.0/cast_framework.js:56:147\n    at http://www.gstatic.com/cast/sdk/libs/sender/1.0/cast_framework.js:56:333\n    at http://www.gstatic.com/cast/sdk/libs/sender/1.0/cast_framework.js:60:463\nI got to see the chromecast's button on the player regardless, it has a play Icon behind it (visual bug), but it triggers chrome's chromecast selector and it casts a blue cast icon to the TV. Content keeps being displayed on my browser's player but content is not actually being casted. Console threw this when attempting to cast:\n[658.782s] [cast.framework.EventTarget] Handler for isConnectedChanged event failed: TypeError: Cannot read property 'loadMedia' of null\nThe error doesn't break chromecast's connection. Even when I unmount the player, connection keeps stable, which is great. \nI'm really looking forward to a full chromecast integration like this, let me know how you want to proceed. \nThe rest of the player's functionality seems to be working fine so far.. The second error appeared as I select the casting device on the browser's selector. It might be my bad though, it's my first time using chromecast's plugin. I tested it with hls content so far. I'm going to keep testing to try and get more data... . Update. I tested with an android phone and I can't see neither the fullscreen nor the chromecast's button.. I'll update the site we used the last time. Give me a few and I'll let you know!. Go here: http://iday.rocstar.tv/\nSame user and pass I sent you before.. Android missing fullscreen button is not a bug. We forgot to add it as a feature to the list... If you add that to the list it works on android!. I couldn't test very much since chromecast never works in the office. I'm setting up a new separated wifi router to check, but it'll take some time (I need to find a spare wifi router). You're right about CORS, so I was careful. I updated iday.rocstar.tv, and I have no CORS errors but I get this instead as I select the chromecast device to cast to from the browsers pop up:\nUnknown error: session_error\nvalue @ chromecast.min.js:12\nI got it to stream for a second,  connection to chromecast never stops but the player is paused and TV screen goes black. The cast session is open but no matter how many times I try to set it to play, it won't. \nI experience the same on android.\nOtherwise the player works fine. You can see for yourself in iday.rocstar.tv.\nAny clues on this error?\nI'll keep you posted!. Ok, so you got the same error, but only on iday.rocstar.tv? Or is it something that happens everywhere? If it's just my platform I'll reach Chromecast support myself otherwise I rather not since I'm not going to be able to explain to them what's going on, since the error comes from chromecast.min.js and I don't now how it works or what it's trying to do specifically. . Ok, so this issue is specific to react environments only? I'm going to look for info in on that.... You're right. I'm going to check on how to handle that and come back to you. If I refresh the screen, I don't get that session error (now I know why) but still cast is paused immediately. It might be my wifi network if you got it to work so I'll keep testing.. Exactly! I'll let you know as soon as I know more!. I've tested 2 different chromecast devices in 3 different networks but it's not working for me. I click on the cast button and select a casting device, just like in the screenshots but it only casts for a second, then it goes into pause. When I click play again it won't start. It looks like it's loading on the device I'm casting to, but the player is automatically set to pause. There are no error messages. I experience the same behavior on android and desktop every time so at least it's consistent. When I stop casting I get this error:\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'loadMedia' of null\n    at e.value (chromecast.min.js:12)\n    at new e (chromecast.min.js:12)\n    at chromecast.min.js:12\n    at HTMLUnknownElement.u.mediaElement.dispatchEvent (mediaelement-and-player.js:963)\n    at chromecast.min.js:12\nHLS chunks are being loaded, everything else looks normal. Any ideas on what to try next?. If you want to test it yourself you can go to iday.rocstar.tv, same user and pass. Keep in mind that I haven't worked on the unmounting issue, so refresh the screen to test instead of navigating in and out of a channel.. Nice catch. I added it and but still experience the same behavior. The only change is that when I press play after stream got paused it doesn't automatically set itself to pause on the player. Still no errors.. The first error on api/auth/me means you're no longer logged in. Log in again and test other channels on the first carousel, some contents might have geolocation protection. I don't manage all streams. . Ok, so I'm going to update that version with the castIsLive=true and point it to another server that shouldn't have problems. I'll let you know how it goes.. Ready: http://iday.rocstar.tv/ I can't reproduce the hlsError you're getting. Hopefully it'll work now. . castIsLive is set here:\n<video autoPlay controls preload=\"none\" id=\"rcsPlayer\" height={height} width=\"100%\"\n              tabIndex=\"0\" key={content.id}\n              data-cast-title={content.name}\n              data-cast-description={content.name}\n              data-cast-is-live={true}\n              >\n              <source src={content.url} type={content.mediaType}/>\n            </video>\nReplacing camlCase for '-' is a react thing. If the property doesn't exist it warns you so I know it's working. Where would you add it if not there? I followed the example here: https://github.com/mediaelement/mediaelement-plugins/blob/master/docs/chromecast.md\nI get the loadMedia error after I close the cast session so it makes sense. \nWhere you able to cast on iday.rocstar.tv?. YES! It works now! thanks! I'm going to keep testing. I still have to figure out how to work with chromecast sessions and react but I will! I'll keep you posted!. It's working great. I just have a few cosmetic issues and a few improvement ideas.\n1 - The \"casting to\" text on the top left corner appears the second time I open a player. It doesn't matter if I casted or not. More over, if I'm using a poster, not only the casting to text appears but a fullscreen overlay of the poster that doesn't go away on play. I see no errors on the screen. You can test it in iday.rocstar.tv.\n2 - I can no longer pause the video player by touching the screen. I find it useful to have control of the player from the screen, specially on mobile devices. Once the video is paused I can set it to play from the screen, no problem. This only happens when castIsLive is set to true, otherwise it works fine.\nI want to handle casting \"a la Netflix\" and it's been working great. If I don't stop the cast and change channels the stream updates, so I can do zapping while casting. Some channels get automatically paused when I do this, others not. I'm going to test this further and try to get cast information from window.cast.framework and see what can be done there. Maybe add a few listeners, if casts stops, check if casting is established, etc. \nImprovement ideas (mostly based on the \"a la Netflix\" concept):\n- I would like to be able to change the initial blue chromecast logo to a custom image. (Not important)\n\n\nI want to be able to use the poster for casting only. Meaning I don't want the poster displayed locally on the player. The poster on the cast is small, like a preview thumbnail, but when applied on the local player it's a fullscreen image. I rather control these two separately.\n\n\nIt would be great to be able to set a background image on TV when casting is connecting.\n\n\nI'm going to keep testing and trying stuff. Let me know how can I help move this along. Great work!\n. I'm not able cast youtube videos embedded on the player. Cast starts, sends title and description information but that's all it happens.. Sounds great, keep me posted!. Awesome, I'll be testing it today, I'll open another issue if something comes up. Thanks!!. Awesome, I'm going to give it a try soon then!\nThanks!. ",
    "iomihai": "Hello,\nThe solution for #2173 works for this too.\nThere is a minor issue that clicking full screen before playing the video goes to the browser window fill screen and after playing the video goes to the native full screen.\nMy player will auto play so will not be affected by this.\nThank you for the quick fix!. Everything looks good to me.\nThank you for the support!. I added preload to data-mejsoptions and found out that for some reason the data-mejsoptions are not used.\nI have set \"pluginPath\": \"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mediaelement/4.0.6/\" but the browser tries to load http://iomihai-tests.appspot.com/build/mediaelement-flash-video.swf so I guess this might be causing this issue.\nDid i botch the data-mejsoptions format? It looks to be a correct json string.. Hello, \nI put preload in the tag, cloned the git repository and using the local files, not through the CDN but it still tries to load the flash from the wrong location and not the data-mejsoptions='{\"pluginPath\": \"/static/mediaelement/build/\", \"shimScriptAccess\": \"always\"}.\nIt looks as the options are not loaded.\nIs there a way to set  pluginPath globally for the page?. All my tests run.\nThank you!. Would be nice to have a HTML5 video alternative for a low latency live stream. Until then Flash is indispensable for me.. I know, I am serving RTMP, HLS, M-DASH and MJPEG at the same time and the stream latency is not such a big issue except for the cameras that can be moved and a big latency is extremely annoying. If RTMP will not be available I will switch to the MJPEG stream for those cameras as I cannot get HLS and DASH under a couple of seconds latency.. I could use other delimiter so you do not have to add a port shim.\nThank you.. Both parameters work.\nThank you so much!. Hello,\nIt looks to me the same. The streams loads occasionaly and there is an extra call to the 404 link I specified above.\nBTW the lines to comment were case \"NetStream.Buffer.Flush\": and _stream.inBufferSeek = true; ?\nI'm sorry but I cannot provide a sample stream. I know it is frustrating having untestable issues.\nI am working on a instruction list to build a environment (I will use a Ubuntu VirtualBox) that hopefully reproduces the issue.\nThank you!. I have new information.\nMy player has 2 sources one HLS and a RTMP and I force the RTMP to be first by using 'renderers' : ['flash_video', 'native_hls', 'flash_hls', 'native_dash', 'flash_dash'], to loar the RTMP stream first.\nWhen I remove the HLS source the extra 40 call dissapears but the stream is still failing to load often.\nI have configured a quick and dirty test environment. I use Ubuntu 17.04 in VirtualBox.\nIn this environment the stream that comes from the camera fails as in the development environment.\nThe test stream does not fail though. I think the stream from the camera might have some issues.\nThe strange 404 link still shows in the VM environment.\nSwitching to 4.2.3 does not have the 404 link or the stream failure in both the VM or development environments so I think maybe solving the 404 issue might solve the connection issue.\nAfter installing the image run:\n```\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt upgrade\nsudo apt install build-essential libpcre3 libpcre3-dev libssl-dev git libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev python-dev libgd2-xpm-dev  libav-tools\nmkdir nginx\ncd nginx\nwget -q http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.13.5.tar.gz\ngit clone --quiet https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module\ntar xzf nginx-1.13.5.tar.gz\ncd nginx-1.13.5\n./configure --prefix=/usr/share/nginx \\\n    --sbin-path=/usr/sbin/nginx \\\n    --modules-path=/usr/lib/nginx/modules \\\n    --conf-path=/etc/nginx/nginx.conf \\\n    --error-log-path=/var/log/nginx/error.log \\\n    --http-log-path=/var/log/nginx/access.log \\\n    --pid-path=/run/nginx.pid \\\n    --lock-path=/var/lock/nginx.lock \\\n    --user=www-data \\\n    --group=www-data \\\n    --with-compat \\\n    --with-file-aio \\\n    --with-threads \\\n    --with-http_auth_request_module \\\n    --with-http_flv_module \\\n    --with-http_gunzip_module \\\n    --with-http_gzip_static_module \\\n    --with-http_mp4_module \\\n    --with-http_ssl_module \\\n    --with-http_stub_status_module \\\n    --with-stream \\\n    --with-stream_ssl_module \\\n    --with-stream_ssl_preread_module \\\n    --add-module=../nginx-rtmp-module\nmake\nsudo make install\nsudo chmod -R a+rw /usr/share/nginx/html\ncd /usr/share/nginx/html\ngit clone https://github.com/mediaelement/mediaelement\nmv index.html index.html.orig\ngedit index.html & \n```\npaste\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n\n\nMediaelement test\n\n\n    body {\n        width: 35em;\n        margin: 0 auto;\n        font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;\n    }\n\n\n\n\n\n$(function(){\n$('.live-player').mediaelementplayer({\npluginPath: '/mediaelement/build/',\n  'streamDelimiter': '~',\n  'renderers' : ['flash_video', 'native_hls', 'flash_hls', 'native_dash', 'flash_dash'],\n  success: function (mediaElement, domObject){\n    mediaElement.play();\n  },\n});\n});\n\n\n\nMediaelement test\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```\nsudo mv /etc/nginx/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf.orig\nsudo gedit /etc/nginx/nginx.conf &\npaste\n```\nuser  nobody;\nworker_processes  1;\nerror_log  logs/error.log;\nerror_log  logs/error.log  notice;\nerror_log  /var/log/nginx/ng.error.log  info;\npid        logs/nginx.pid;\nevents {\n    worker_connections  1024;\n}\nhttp {\ninclude       mime.types;\ndefault_type  application/octet-stream;\n\n\n#access_log  logs/access.log  main;\n\nsendfile        on;\n#tcp_nopush     on;\n\n#keepalive_timeout  0;\nkeepalive_timeout  65;\n\n#gzip  on;\n\nserver {\n    listen       80;\n    server_name  localhost;\n\n    #charset koi8-r;\n\n    #access_log  logs/host.access.log  main;\n\n    location / {\n        root   html;\n        index  index.html index.htm;\n    }\n\n    #error_page  404              /404.html;\n\n    #

Maybe I can try this :\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/a/12536137/782013 ?\n\n\"Luckily, before the user can trigger the behavior to start audio, they have to click a button. I set the volume of the element to 0.0, and have it \"play\" when they click this button.\nAfter the sound is played silently, I simply set the volume property back to 1.0, and it plays without user intervention just fine.\". Set the volume to 0 then play then set volume to 1 does not work.\nCan't find a workaround for this :/. Yes, I guess so...\nBut there should have an option in Chrome to allow to filter this by URL.  The current way is, in a way, overprotective...\nThanks for your help!. https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=728108#c15 \n\nso... the reason this is happening is because some of your playback comes from YouTube iframes that you are injecting in the page and the check we have is per frame. It's working fine when you only use the SoundCloud API.\n\nAny way to have another behaviour for Youtube, @rafa8626 ?. But does this mean that if I inject all the Youtube iframes when my playlist loads, it will work ?\nDo you think this is a bad idea; for exemple if I load 100+ iframes ?. Ok, too bad, but thanks for having checked !. Mhhh I'm trying to make all that stuff work :)\nBut something else broke now.  Can't play youtube urls anymore.\nI just use setSrc() in my function switch_track_source(idx).\nCould this be related to mime types ?  It works if I use a \"regular\" URL like https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Example.ogg.\nSorry to ask you so much, but I really would like to achieve all this :). Ok, so no need to set mime types if I understood ?\nWell, I got two things very strange.\n1 / I still can't get Youtube to play anymore\n2 / The player works quite well locally. First track is playing automatically on page load, try to find a playable source, and plays it.  When I skip the track, it behaves correctly and to the save for the next track.  But when online, the first track do no starts (loadeddata ?) - I did try to refresh my browser cache but it seems that this is not the problem.  It seems the behaviour is not the same, is it possible ?\nYou can test at this URL : http://wip.spiff-radio.org/wordpress/wpsstm_live_playlist/test-indieshuffle/\nTry also to play with the \"source chooser\" (in the player, at the right of the track title).\nAlso : I find the difference between the player and the media confusing.  I don't know if it's just me :)  But maybe you could explain that in the doc.\nThanks again !. I'm working actively on the code so I changed a lot of things; including updating to the patched version of Wordpress.\nAlso, before, I was 'grabbing' the sources src from  tags while now I get them from a javascript object.  I'll keep checking and post here if I find something.\nRegarding the doc and stackoverflow questions, it's not very clear either if events should be attached to the player or to the media.\nPS : Don't know if you have time for this but do u use an IRC ?\nPS2 : Just to be sure : there is no extra Youtube js renderers required to play youtube urls; it's part of the main JS code, yes ?. Hi rafa8626;\nMY BAD ! I was using the wrong version of mediaelement locally :/\nWell, it's working far better now :)\nAnyway, still, I can't get Youtube to play.\nCheck the playlist : http://wip.spiff-radio.org/wpsstm_live_playlist/test-indieshuffle/\nIt works for Soundcloud but Youtube fails.\nTry to play with the source chooser (right of the track title, on the player) too.\nWhat do you think ?\nThanks a lot ! Almost there !. Working !!! So nice.  I'm so happy to close this crazy issue :)\nThanks for your help, really appreciated.. :)\nDon't forget to push thoses changes on the Wordpress ticket :). Sorry, I made a mistake about this.... @rafa8626 ?. This other Stackoverflow question (Starting with Safari 11 by blocking autoplay HTML5 Audio, this means also it blocks features like: repeat, shuffle, or playlist?) has an answer that says that if the media element has been allowed once, you should be able to switch the sources. But for this I would need to reset the MediaElement GUI so that it matches the new source.. > I'm sorry @gordielachance I'm not maintaining this project anymore.\nSo sad :/\nShould I ask someone else ? @johndyer ?\n. I finally fixed it.\nIt works great by initializing the MediaElement JS once, then switching the sources with \n```\nplay_source(){\n    //remove old events\n    $(mediaElement).off();\n//register new events\n$(mediaElement).on('loadeddata', function() {\n    mediaElement.play();\n    ...\n});\n$(mediaElement).on('error', function() {\n    ...\n});\n$(mediaElement).on('play', function() {\n    ...\n});\n$(mediaElement).on('pause', function() {\n    ...\n});\n$(mediaElement).on('ended', function() {\n    ...\n});\n\nmediaElement.setSrc(new_source);\nmediaElement.load();\n\n}\n```\n.

    "Bob-Kink": "Hi, thanks for your quick response! I'm back from the holiday weekend and this is my top priority. I will get you a screen recording ASAP.\nYes, I am using version 4.1.1. browsers are Chrome 58.0.3029.110 (64-bit), Safari 10.1.1 (12603.2.4), and Firefox 53.0.3 (64-bit).\nThe issue shows up in my local player but also the one in demo/index.html that came with the downloaded files. I'll post something ASAP - gonna try a couple things first.. Sure thing -- I just starred both. \nI tried disabling all my extensions in Chrome, but the bug persists. I've attached a screen recording that should show you the bug quite clearly. Let me know if I can be of any help in resolving it! Cheers.\nmejs-volume-slider.mp4.zip\n. I didn't know there was a 4.1.2. Cool! And, great news - the bug is not present in 4.1.2.\nI'm sorry, I have no idea how/why the volume slider was visible at the start of the video. I can't reproduce it intentionally. It may be that my mouse was over that spot when I hit the start button for the recording; it disappears right before the video actually starts, which is probably when I moved the mouse away from it.\nThanks again for your responsiveness and for the fact that there's a version without the bug. \ud83d\ude04 . OK, so just to be clear, in order to maximize flash support I need the following files in the same dir as the JS?\nmediaelement-flash-video-hls.swf\nmediaelement-flash-video-mdash.swf\nmediaelement-flash-video.swf\nand the pluginPath needs to point to the dir where those reside. Correct?\nDo I also need shimScriptAccess: 'always' ?. OK. My swfs are local so I'll drop the shimScriptAccess bit.\nThanks again!. I don't have anything public-facing to show you, but you can reproduce it in the demo that comes with the download.\nFrom my instructions above: \"To see it, add 'alwaysShowHours: true' to the options that start on line 103 of demo.js.\"\nI just noticed it also happens on videos with a duration greater than 1 hour, even if alwaysShowHours is not set or is false.\n. Thanks!. Awesome! Will do. Thanks for the always-speedy responses!. Confirmed: this update fixes the issue.. So far so good... I was able to play an flv and it was rendered by the SWF. Thanks!\nWe'll do some more testing but it looks good.. Great! Thanks.. Yes, that fixed it. Thank you!. Is it safe for me to use this new version in its entirety, or should I cherry-pick the portion that is specific to the controls? I want to make sure stability is not an issue as there are 30 differences between the previous script and this one.. The bug is definitely resolved. The player seems fine otherwise. I'll assume it's good and ask our QA team to do regression tests to make sure no problems have arisen. If there are problems I'll let you know ASAP (likely on Monday).. Sorry for not being more specific... I cannot repro it on Safari or Firefox OSX. It occurs in Chrome 59.0.3071.86 on OSX.. Awesome. Thanks. I have not, sorry. I can request some additional testing here if you like?. We were not able to reproduce the issue on IE11, but unfortunately we don't have access to Edge today. \nOne of our testers found that on FF 53.03 for Mac, the  spacebar pauses video after center Play click, but subsequent spacebar taps don\u2019t start playback again. Nobody else here is able tor reproduce it in 53.03 or 54.0.\nDo you want to wait for Edge feedback, or perhaps try Browserstack?. I feel like I owe you at least one favor given how responsive you have been to all my feedback, so I really want to say yes -- but, I don't have a Chromecast handy, sorry.. Woo! Yes, fixes the issue in Chrome. We'll check the other browsers as well, but for now it's safe to assume this is resolved. Thanks!. Sure, I'd be happy to do it this afternoon; I have a few things I have to wrap up before lunch this morning. I'll give you a heads-up here right when I start.. It's the least I can do. :-) Talk to you this afternoon.. OK, I'm ready to give this a spin. I've got Mac OS Sierra 10.12.5 with the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox and Safari. I'll test everything about the player that I can think of in all 3.. I'm looking at the demo that came with the zip from your development branch, and it plays fine in Chrome, but I see some console errors -- for instance:\nmediaelement-and-player.js:5172 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'getDuration' of undefined\n    at MediaElementPlayer.getDuration (mediaelement-and-player.js:5172)\n    at HTMLDivElement.<anonymous> (mediaelement-and-player.js:1894)\n    at MediaElementPlayer.setControlsSize (mediaelement-and-player.js:4680)\n    at MediaElementPlayer.checkForTracks (mediaelement-and-player.js:2467)\n    at MediaElementPlayer.loadNextTrack (mediaelement-and-player.js:2380)\n    at mediaelement-and-player.js:2403\n    at XMLHttpRequest.xhr.onreadystatechange (mediaelement-and-player.js:7893)\n    at ajax (mediaelement-and-player.js:7898)\n    at MediaElementPlayer.loadTrack (mediaelement-and-player.js:2388)\n    at MediaElementPlayer.loadNextTrack (mediaelement-and-player.js:2377)\nI assume the xhr issues are mostly due to my testing form a local file. Would you prefer I test this on my own player in our app, rather than simply opening the demo html page from my Downloads folder?. Switching source to Twitch, I get double controls on the player, a weird-looking play button on pause, and the video does not pause when I click on it -- only when I click the pause button down by the timeline or tap the space bar on my keyboard.. OK, will do. While I've got you, you have some strange things happening in Safari with the volume slider. When I move it up and down, especially if I click to move it rather than drag, I see little distortions at each interval. There are also points where it gets wider and narrower by a few pixels.\nHere's a screenshot:\n\n. Version 10.1.1 (12603.2.4). I see 2 potential bugs in the latest version, the first of which I see in both Chrome and Safari but not Firefox:\n- After I seek in the video by clicking on the timeline with the mouse, the spacebar has no effect until I click on the video to pause it. The the spacebar plays it again, and has effect until i click the timeline again\nThe other one is in Safari only:\n- By clicking on the timeline to seek a few times during the video, both backward and forward, it is possible to get to a point where I hear the video playing but the player itself is black. Once this state occurs, nothing can take me out of it except refreshing the page\n- The number of clicks differs from instance to instance, but it's rarely more than 4 or 5, and the behavior is consistent\n. That's about it! Looking good otherwise. If I click on the timeline back and forth, sometimes it happens after 3 clicks, sometimes 4, sometimes 5. Eventually it always happens, though: the player goes black and I just hear the video.. FWIW that Safari volume slider bug was in the demo. I was not able to reproduce it when I moved over to our own app. In our app we use the legacy styles ('mejs-').\nHope that helps.. I will be able to test the progress bar at around 3:30 Pacific time.. Sorry, I got sidetracked. Looking at it now.. That first bug is still present in Chrome but it is fixed in Safari.. While viewing full screen?\nVersion 59.0.3071.86 (Official Build) (64-bit)?. I have to leave in about 35 minutes and will be away from my keyboard for the rest of the night. Sorry.\nHappy to check in the morning!. OK, checking now.. Yes! It's fixed.. Great! You're welcome. Thanks for everything you do.. Here is what we are seeing:\n\n. No, as far as I know this is just in Android with the specs provided.. OK, I can certainly look into our setup more deeply. The issue surfaced after the last set of changes went into production, though, and in that release I didn't change anything at this end other than mediaelement-and-player.js.. Aww man. \ud83d\ude1e  OK, let me dig in more and I'll follow up.. I can reproduce it on Browserstack on older Android versions. One thing to note: I am using the older styles. We set classPrefix: 'mejs-' and use the mediaelementplayer-legacy.css.\nAs far as I can tell, these styles push the video player down in Chrome for Android when in fullscreen and landscape orientation. Hard to pinpoint because trying to use dev tools on a device from within Browsterstack is a bit challenging. I'll see if I can get my hands on an actual device and try some CSS tweaks.. Confirmed the above: when using legacy styles, the entire video player (mejs-mediaelement) is shifted down 27px in Android when one enters fullscreen mode (this is fixed by setting top: -27px). The controls (mejs-controls) are about 22px too far down, and this can be fixed by setting bottom: 22px on that element.\nI'll test using the new styles momentarily.. I tried Android 5 on Browserstack and 7 on a live device.. The issue is present in both the new styles and the old ones.\nI guess it must be on our side... though it didn't show up until we upgraded the player last week. Maybe it was there and we just didn't know about it.\nI'm going to add CSS in our local stylesheets to override for Android:\n.mejs-android.mejs-container-fullscreen .mejs-mediaelement {top: -27px}\n.mejs-android.mejs-container-fullscreen .mejs-controls {bottom: 49px}\nThat fixes the display.\n. OK, thanks for checking! There may be some deeper CSS mystery on our end that I'll have to dig into... or not. :-). ",

So, when you watch the video I sent you, the controls go away for you when you move the mouse?  They don't for me.. I couldn't get it to work with the alwaysShowControls: true, but I downloaded the newest player files and it seems to be working now.\nHowever, now because I have multiple language options in my .xml file, it lists all the languages when I click the CC button, even if it can't find the files for those languages.  \n\n\nBefore, it only listed the ones it could find.  \n\nAny idea on how I can fix it to prevent the language from showing in the list if it can't find the .vtt file for that language?. Here is a new link.\nhttps://summit.bravais.com/s/vjXBDoPMPE4e4NRJWzSf\nSince I updated the mediaplayer files from back in Nov 2016 to now?  Do I need to update the code in my .xml?  Are the build and src folders the only required folders?. what error?. I removed the src folder. Is that what you meant?. I removed the following code from the .xml, but it's still not showing the new player.\n\nIs this still accurate?\n. Ok, so, I only need this:\n                            <script>\n                                $( document ).ready(function() {\n                                    $('video,audio').mediaelementplayer();\n                                });\n                            </script>. Ok, I think I got the player to work.  :-)  Sorry, I'm not very good at this stuff.\n\nAny idea on how to get the languages not to show up if it can't find the .vtt file?\n\n. The video doesn't play when I publish it.  We are running in an LCMS, when I preview the first time, it doesn't play either, but then I refresh and it works.  Very strange.. Ok.  Here a link.  \nhttps://xpe.xyleme.com/summit/preview/f4dd114d-ffc3-4d9f-9d3f-3b98d60edbbd/4cb9451a-ae6b-44a4-baff-d97c485bd3b6/page/index.html#Item1-1\nIf it asks you to login, use the following info:\nLogin: Creative.One\nPassword: Crware2015\nThe video player works on first load, but if I refresh, it no longer shows the video (only sound).\nThis is the code I'm using with the files from the 4.1.3 download I did today.  I did copy the jquery.js file i to the build folder from the old files.\nWC_Engine_VideoPlayer_CC_v15.zip\n. If I can't get the new version to work, I'll have to go back to the older ones.  And then I'm still trying to get the controls to hide.\nIs this the correct code?  It doesn't seem to work. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.\n<script>\n     $( document ).ready(function() {\n         $('video,audio').mediaelementplayer({\n             alwaysShowControls: true\n     });\n     });\n</script>\n. I had to change permissions for Creative.One.  Try again now.. It works for me on the first 2 loads, then it only shows the video.  So wierd.\n. I replaced the \" with a single quote and it now seems to work in preview.  I'm trying to publish now and see if it still works there.\n. Does the link work for you if you refresh multiple times?\n. This is the published version.  Video plays but with no controls. \nI haven't add the new function code yet though.\nhttps://summit.bravais.com/document/3779/preview. Ok.  Try now.\nWC_Engine_VideoPlayer_CC_v15.zip\n. The preview is playing better, but the controls don't auto-hide.\nAnd now when I publish, the controls don't show up at all.. Thank you!  I'll work with the LCMS to see why it previews correctly, but won't publish. \nOnly other question then is the Languages listed in the CC menu.  Is there a way to make it so the Language doesn't show in the list if it doesn't find the file.  Similar to how it did in the old version?. I didn't document the version number, but I downloaded it in 11/2016, or around then.  Does one of the files in the mediaelement-master tell me what version it is?\n. Perfect!  Thanks so much!. ",

    "mzealey": "I have the same issue. Create a player, and then remove it and you will get this issue thrown. This is because you do a globalBind('resize') in src/js/player.js:1003 and then you do a globalUnbind() when removing the player. However afaics, globalUnbind() with no events to unbind from simply does nothing (rather than removing all bound events as one might expect).. This is with an ionic/angular project so not particularly clean but shows you the issue. Use desktop chrome. Go to https://watchem-dev.markandruth.co.uk/#/watch-em/list/event-list . Click the 'event' button. It shows a player. Then click on the red tab to remove the player. When you resize your console will get these error messages.. Nope looks like you need to specify the callback that was bound to the event listener too to correctly deregister or something as it's still registered.. I don't think the keydown unbind is going to work because you're creating a new anon function in the unbind phase (https://github.com/mediaelement/mediaelement/commit/491630ede8f3966f77401141a8b4f7ec67d2c2c0#diff-57c401f024caa0f041ff8130e6f71255R5068).

Awesome functionality. I think a great addition would be an 'auto' imageQuality, that would select the resolution associated with the player size.\nAlso the mejs play button is not being shown with the poster.. Hardcode the imageQuality with the associated image size. For example mqdefault is 320x180. If the player size is larger than that, then use hqdefault, etc.. The poster id is not parsing correctly if the youtube link is as followed: https://youtu.be/<id>. For me using https://youtu.be/0JeN03ep1Cg, the image url is https://img.youtube.com/vi/0JeN03ep1Cg?_=3%22/hqdefault.jpg. Works fine if I use https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JeN03ep1Cg. \n. I can filter the video src in php. However the video tags should still work with the parameters, but the image poster will not.

I think that trying to use HTML5 video in the first place would de better.\n3.- This is not important: I had to remove from common.js the part that hides the videos and shows them again after aligning them. Otherwise the video was displayed in the wrong place. Example:\n\n\nPlease star the project to continue supporting it. Thanks\n\nDone! Thank you!. Hi, Rafael.\nIs it possible to set different renderers to each media file in the page? Something like:\n$exe.mediaelements.mediaelementplayer({\n    renderers: getRenderers(),\n    stretching: 'none',\n    pluginPath: typeof eXe !== 'undefined' ? '../scripts/mediaelement/' : ''\n});\nIn that case, I could set ['html5', 'flash_video', 'native_flv'] for the FLV files and [] for the rest (we don't know what video or audio will be played).\nAnother thing: When I try to play FLV in G. Chrome I get no error message. errorContent is empty, so I had to do this in mediaelement-and-player.js (line 4206):\nif (!errorContent) {\n    var lnk = t.media.originalNode.getAttribute('src');\n    if (lnk) {\n        errorContent = '<p><a href=\"' + lnk + '\" download><span>' + _mejs2.default.i18n.t('mejs.download-file') + ': ' + lnk + '</span></a></p>';\n    }\n}\nYou might find a better way to fix that...\nThank you!. Yes! Thanks for that code. The renderers part is solved. I don't know if the plugin should do that by default...\nPlease try this in G. Chrome (no error is displayed): http://gros.es/tests/exelearning/mediaelement/\nWith the code in line 4206 to check errorContent: http://gros.es/tests/exelearning/mediaelement/?test=true. I still see no error message in G. Chrome: http://gros.es/tests/exelearning/mediaelement-master/. I tried a cleaner code (HTML5, just those JS files, etc.) just in case, but I still get no error messages in G. Chrome (on Windows): http://gros.es/tests/exelearning/mediaelement-master/clean.html Do you?\nThe error message is displayed if I set a customError. FR: It would be easier to show a link If you could use a function there: customError: function(element) { ... }\nCould you provide the URL where you can see the error messages? I tried in different servers.\nThanks.. Hi, Rafael.\n\nI see in your statement about customError that you have an argument. What do you mean with element? Because it will be easier to set a method with no args right now\n\nThe video element object ([HTMLVideoElement]), so you can get the currentSrc, for example, or even 2 arguments: The MediaElement object and the HTML element.. Of course! Closed. \nThanks a lot, Rafael!. I see the changes in the errorContent definition, but the arguments are missing, at least in my tests: http://gros.es/tests/exelearning/mediaelement-master/clean.html\nTry this one (FLV + renderers: ['html5']) in Firefox if you get no error in G.

(since the maintainers for this project are busy).\nso, how I can help you?. can you provide a live example, please?. Hi @akash-pal, can you explain your issue, please.. Nice logo @michaelizer.. Hi, can provide an example please. Hi @dobro03, Set the default volume using startVolume option, described in the API Docs.\nset the default volume setting in the Wordpress mediaelement file (wp-includes/js/mediaelement/wp-mediaelement.js) in the initialize method, like the following:\nfunction initialize() {\n    if ( typeof _wpmejsSettings !== 'undefined' ) {\n        settings = $.extend( true, {}, _wpmejsSettings );\n    }\nsettings.startVolume = 1; // volume setting here\nsettings.classPrefix = 'mejs-';\n....\nNotes: \n Don't forget that this option is overrided by user cookie.\n As long as WordPress include the minified version of wp-mediaelement (wp-mediaelement.min.js), so you may need to edit the wp-mediaelement and minify it.\nI hope this help.. Hello again @dobro03, oops sorry my mistake. the answer updated!\nNo, you don't need to clear the cookies, I just mention that when the user changes the (audio|video) volume it will be saved in the user cookies.. @dobro03 did see my first updated answer?. @dobro03 , copy-paste the following gist & minify:\nhttps://gist.github.com/Qoraiche/e597c6726de673b041dd1771259b94ba#file-wp-mediaelement-js-L42. it's okay, you can minify using an online javascript-minifier. and yes overwrite the wp-mediaelement.min.js file with the minified version of the gist I gave you.. @rafa8626  is there any way to achieve this?. Hi @johndyer can you please take a look. Try to create a player size controller function\n```\nvar adjustPlayerSize = function(med, pl) {\nvar width = $('.wrapper').width();\nvar height = $('.wrapper').height();\n// min dimensions for the player\nif (width < 256) width = 256;\nif (height < 110) height = 110;\nmed.setVideoSize(width, height);\nvar player = med.player || pl.player;\nplayer.setPlayerSize(width, height);\nplayer.setControlsSize();\n};\n```\nthen, call it every time the window was resized.\ni hope this help. you can use setPlayerSize (width, height) to Set player's width and height also considering the stretching configuration. Yes, this may be a fork for mediaelement.js. As I understand from your question you will need to do grab the client ID manually from your SoundCloud Tracks.\nFrom this Answer:\n\nGo to any tracks that you can download on Soundcloud, press f12 and look at networks tab, click download and it will show you something like\nhttps://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/322109493/download?client_id=2t9loNQH90kzJcsFCODdigxfp325aq4z&oauth_token=2-274121-85658-y9KQYyZ6qG9oT2uvPq\nGrab that client_id, and replace it.\n\nSo your soundcloud URL will look something like:\nhttps://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/445858110/stream?client_id=95f22ed54a5c297b1c41f72d713623ef\nNow you can play it with Mediaelement player.\nHope this helps.. What do you mean by locating? Do you want to get the DOM element of the player?. Hi @GingkoFr.\nYou can do this by calling Mediaelement instance with a method (load, play, stop etc..):\n// example call the play method\n        mediaElement.play();\nif you want to locate and play with Mediaelement methods in your browser's console :\n1) locate your player:\nvar myAudioPlayer = mejs.players.mep_0;\nNote: mep_0 is the player ID.\n2) for example play audio/video\nmyAudioPlayer.play();\nIf you have any problem, please let me know.. I see that the theme you're using reinstall Mediaelement ( in plugins.js), although it's already integrated into WordPress core?. can I see your web page?. @jnettik can you share your code?. no, it's not. 10 months it's not enough to decide that the project is dead or not, so just give some time to the maintainer.. @johndyer that's sad , your project is used by the most popular cms (wordpress) and many more so don't just waste it like this, i hope you can give it just a few of your time and do few changes and fixes, Thanks.

Going to document my findings in this issue.\nSo from what I understand the code that causes this error is there with the purpose of polyfilling the getComputedStyle method in Firefox.\nhttps://github.com/mediaelement/mediaelement/blob/master/src/js/utils/polyfill.js#L151-L159\nThe element which is causing the code to recurse and fail comes from here.\nhttps://github.com/mediaelement/mediaelement/blob/master/src/js/utils/constants.js#L21-L38\nThis code is for detecting whether the browser supports pointer events and does so by creating this element.\n<x style=\"pointer-events: auto;\">\nIt then calls the getComputedStyle method on this element which triggers the recursion.. The recursion seems to be caused by this.\njavascript\nwindow.mediaElementJsOldGetComputedStyle = window.getComputedStyle;\nwindow.getComputedStyle = function (el, pseudoEl) {\n    var t = window.mediaElementJsOldGetComputedStyle(el, pseudoEl);\n    return t === null ? { getPropertyValue: function getPropertyValue() {} } : t;\n};\nFor some reason when is window.mediaElementJsOldGetComputedStyle is called it is referencing window.getComputedStyle which ends up referencing itself.. @rafa8626 the problem with a lot of these polyfills is much of the code overrides objects on the global scope window. These overrides effect everything on the page not just the calls to them from the mediaelement library.\nI would recommend refactoring the library to not use anything on the global scope window. Instead the library should maintain its own references to objects on the global scope and use those. Then if one of the objects is not working appropriately then override the reference the library maintains not the reference on the global scope window.\nObviously this is quite a big change so for the moment I have a stop gap solution which stopped the recursion bug..

Oops, the diff shows applied fixes wrong because of different file encodings :( Tomorrow I'll take a look how to fix that (Windows CR LF => Unix LF). The main point is playback status variables should be dependent from events of NetStream() but not from methods which supposed to trigger them\nFor example, when a user clicks on Play button an internal method play() called, there is a private variable _isPaused set to false. But it has to be set when event \"NetStream.Play.Start\" has been triggered.. @rafa8626 I closed my PR because you can't see the changes I've made in diff tool because of wrong EOL.

Hi @rafa8626 \nSorry, I will answer on your questions tomorrow, today I do not have time :(. > Thanks I'll review this right now. Is this a problem only with those renderers or it needs to be checked in the rest of the renderers, specially the native ones such as dash, hls and flv?\nI noticed the issue in Edge browser and tested only with these two renderers. In Chrome \"native_hls\" is used instead of \"html5\" for playing HLS but I didn't see the problem with it. So I didn't apply any fixes to other renderers because I have no chance to test them but I think the same fix might be useful as a safe guard to avoid triggering/handling playback events in a renderer which is not active at the moment.. > I see a change on build/mediaelement-flash-video.swf but I don't see changes on src/flash/flash-video/VideoMediaElement.as is that expected?\nActually I do not know why it's marked as changed. I've decompiled both versions from master and this bugfix branch and source code are absolutely similar. During work on the issue I changed VideoMediaElement.as couple of times and compiled to mediaelement-flash-video.swf but then I reverted those changes. And recompiled flash file again.. > Nevermind I used the demo file for testing purposes. One thing I did notice is this: select the audio RTMP and play it. Then try to move ahead clicking the progress bar. The audio stops, and displays a Restart icon. You click the restart icon and audio plays but if you click the progress bar again, it stops and starts from zero. Let it play and now play the video MP4 and you will see that both of them are playing simultaneously. So there are some events not being triggered correctly still. I don't know if the first issue is because of the RTMP source I have as an example\nYes, I see the problem. Investigating.. @rafa8626 \nCan you reproduce it here http://htmltricks.ru/test/mediaelement/fixes/demo/ ? I can't :( The page contains a version from this branch.\nFor comparing I also added the latest version from master branch (it's not releases but contains some important fixes): http://htmltricks.ru/test/mediaelement/master/demo/. @rafa8626 hm, I haven't noticed such error both by the link (please watch the video https://youtu.be/wPqWc7AQewI) and on the site I'm working on locally.\nHere is the latest master (Friday state)  - https://youtu.be/NjUlaO7QBoA\nAnd video from demo on http://www.mediaelementjs.com/ - https://youtu.be/fpp4iuNxPSY\nI use Chrome on Windows Version 60.0.3112.101 (Official Build) (64-bit). @rafa8626 after a brief look at the issue it looks like data from rendered in DOM UI player passed wrong to flash player and back. \"seeked\" and \"seeking\" events are triggered ok but they are not handled for some reason. I use my own UI for the player that's why I didn't notice this issue and it works fine at my project. The only thing I can say - that's another issue to investigate and it was not made in this PR, I've uploaded one more version to my host and you can ensure that there is absolutely the same behaviour within v4.2.4 http://htmltricks.ru/test/mediaelement/4.2.4/demo/. @rafa8626 I'll be back from vacation in two weeks, only then I'll be able to take a look at the issue. Have to cover more corners cases. Sorry for disturbing. @rafa8626 that's strange, of course, I'll take a look at this problem soon. @rafa8626 yep, all points mentioned by @krishnapriyaMandadi were noticed by me on demo page earlier and that's the thing I wrote about in #2368\nSo, I think this bug can be closed because it is about not played RTMP (it is played fine with latest source code from master) and all those usability issues might be converted into separate issue to work with and close after the fix. @rafa8626 @krishnapriyaMandadi yes, I can't provide ETA unfortunately but I'll do this as the first thing. @smasam \nPlay event will be triggered for the first time if you add play listener out of load meta data event callback.\nSo just change your code \n```\nmedia.addEventListener(\"loadedmetadata\", function()\n    {\nconsole.log(\"load metadata event handler ------------------\");\n\nmedia.addEventListener(\"play\", function(e) \n    {\n    console.log(\"play event handler=======================>\");\n\n    });\n\nmedia.addEventListener(\"timeupdate\", function(e) \n    {\n    console.log(\"timeupdate handler +++++++++++++++++++>\");\n    });\n\n});\n\n```\nTo\n```\nmedia.addEventListener(\"loadedmetadata\", function()\n    {\n    console.log(\"load metadata event handler ------------------\");\n    });\nmedia.addEventListener(\"play\", function(e) \n    {\n    console.log(\"play event handler=======================>\");\n    });\nmedia.addEventListener(\"timeupdate\", function(e) \n    {\n    console.log(\"timeupdate handler +++++++++++++++++++>\");\n    });\n```\nIt happens because \"play\" event triggered earlier than \"loadedmetadata\". You can check it out here http://htmltricks.ru/test/mediaelement/master-15-09-17/demo/load.html. @rafa8626 when I got a free minute I'll take a look at things you have asked me about. I work full time at some company and fully loaded with other tasks, sorry. @rafa8626 I just read all thread and unfortunately I can't help with the subject. I'm not an expert in ActionScript, all fixes I've done so far related to issues in already existing funtionality but not implementing something new.

Ok for youtube & vimeo, but dailymotion has the reverse issue. It starts always muted even when muted attribute is not present.. ~Works fine now, thank you!~. Sorry, there is an issue with dailymotion renderer when passing in options like{dailymotion: {controls: true}}`.

I do not set type either. I will search if there is some differences or specificities to firefox ubuntu. Ok, I think I found the root. Firefox seems to try to download from the source (which is a link to dailymotion) even with preload=\"none\". that explains the errors that firefox display about not being enable to read x-video/dailymotion format and sometimes text/html format, but I found that's not linked to the player not being loaded.

Yep, I think this is on their side.. Yep, good to me!. Triggered, sure, but not as precise than youtube. For example, setting muted after playing event does not work some times because it's not really in playing state.. I have this bug for both dailymotion & vimeo. If you load & start a video as muted, then pause, than play, 50% of the time, setting muted (and maybe other attributes) in the playing event callback does not work (renderer not ready ?). I had to cheat with a setTimeout which is ugly.. I think I found out why. Setting some attribute like muted is in fact async. You might consider returning the Promise, because right now it is very difficult to know when the commands like play, pause, muted, ... are actually applied. I have to listen some event then stop listening it right after. Having the promise in return of each action would be more effective.. I made a more focused issue #2414 to explain the use case.\nI consider this one ok as the 1st demand is solved ;). Thank you for the hint, I will try ;). I tried, I encounter some issues:\n\nYoutube return a object which is not a promise (the player?)\nDailymotion return nothing\nWhen the player is not ready, you are pushing action to a stack which return nothing. If each action is a Promise, maybe the stack should start with a Promise.resolve and chaining all actions with .then instead of a simple array push.\n\nI know this is quite a change, not as easy to do, but I think it would worth the effort for the health of the exposed API.. Same for me, I was working on a poc, but real life come up sooner than expected :( . I did it in my code, but if that could be inside mediaelement, that would be very cool :)\n```js\n            const videoEl = mediaEl.querySelector('video')\n            videoEl.remove()\n            videoEl.removeAttribute('id')\n            mediaEl.remove()\n            const wrapperEl = mediaEl.parentElement\n            wrapperEl.append(videoEl)\n```. In the standalone version the remove method is the node element native one. I dont know if it can be overridden.. Works well! \nI would just call remove before removeAttribute to avoid update the node element while still being attached and thus maybe trigger reflow / repaint.. Also I dont think the cloneNode is very useful . You have to remove the id attribute, because the original node does not have one. MediaElement add it.. It seems so. Good job ! . ",

    "casper": "The offset needs to be different depending on screen resolution and movie resolution. So you can't really hard-code a static offset :-/ The offset also needs to be different in full screen mode vs. windowed mode.\nI switched to another JS player (Plyr.js), that also has this problem, but there I managed to fix it with some  patch code. The JS players I tested so far all have this problem. Compare it with VLC or Youtube for example, where it works correctly (subtitles always at bottom of video frame).. This is how I fixed it on Plyr. Basically in fullscreen mode I calculate the shift offset sh based on screen height and video frame height, and then monkey patch the CSS style to move the subtitles upwards. However this probably needs to be tested on multiple resolutions to make sure it's working properly. So far on my two monitors it seems to be working OK:\n```javascript\n    var p = plyr.setup();\n// Inject modified CSS on fullscreen event\np[0].on('enterfullscreen', function(e) {\n  var sh = (screen.height - p[0].getMedia().videoHeight) / 2;\n\n  document.getElementsByTagName('style')[0].innerHTML +=\n    \".plyr--hide-controls .plyr__captions \" +\n    \" { transform: translateY(-\" + sh + \"px) !important; }\";\n});\n\n// Restore the default setting on fullscreen exit\np[0].on('exitfullscreen', function(e) {\n  document.getElementsByTagName('style')[0].innerHTML +=\n    \".plyr--hide-controls .plyr__captions \" +\n    \" { transform: translateY(-15px) !important; }\";\n});\n\n``\n. This is with Plyr, but it works essentially the same with MEJS. It seems thevideo` element by default always puts the subtitles at the bottom of the current container, regardless of the video frame size itself.\nHere is without the patch, full screen:\n\n...and with the patched CSS, the subtitles are at the bottom of the video frame, instead of bottom of screen. This is how VLC media player works too:\n\n. You can use media on this page, as it's suitably in wide screen format and includes captions: \nhttp://iandevlin.github.io/mdn/video-player-with-captions/\nMedia link: \nhttp://iandevlin.github.io/mdn/video-player-with-captions/video/sintel-short.mp4\nVTT captions: \nhttp://iandevlin.github.io/mdn/video-player-with-captions/subtitles/vtt/sintel-en.vtt\n. Awesome. This now works in full screen, however in windowed mode, when there are black borders in the container, it doesn't readjust the subtitles. \nI don't know why, but Plyr autosizes the height in windowed mode, so there are never black borders. MEJS seems to respect the width and height of the video element, which is fine I guess, but it produces black borders when height is bigger than the video frame (same effect as full screen). The subtitles should be adjusted here too.\n. Basically anything not in full screen (normal browser window).\n\n. Now it works in windowed mode too, but in full screen they moved up too high. Perhaps it's now adding the windowed offset to the full screen offset. The titles are now 2x higher in full screen. It was better in the previous version.. Nope :-/ Now it's back to the original behavior in windowed mode (subtitles at bottom of container), and in full screen the subtitles are on top of the boundary between the video frame and the black bars.\n. That looks great, however the one I'm pulling from github right now behaves like this:\nWindowed:\n\nFull screen:\n\n. Ok I see. Yeah it would be great if it would cover the other scenarios too.\n.

As I understand from the linked page the iframe embed does not nescesarily load one specific type of player. \nSee complete note about the \"loop\" parameter:\nhttps://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters#loop\n\nNote: This parameter has limited support in the AS3 player and in IFrame embeds, which could load either the AS3 or HTML5 player. Currently, the loop parameter only works in the AS3 player when used in conjunction with the playlist parameter. To loop a single video, set the loop parameter value to 1 and set the playlist parameter value to the same video ID already specified in the Player API URL\n\nAt the moment the generated iframe code does not loop on certain devices. On my desktop it loops fine but on a Raspberry Pi 3 it does not loop. If I take the generated iframe code and add the playlist parameter containing the video ID it does loop on the Raspberry Pi 3.\n.

The only way to come back from this is to reload the webpage, which is not desirable.\nSelecting 'CORS BLOCK' in the playlist results in the player selecting a different random live stream. Choosing 'CORS BLOCK' again results in a totally different live stream being played.\nBoth the domain and the file exist but in this particular example CORS settings prevent the live stream from being played.\nThere are other instances where random live streams are played which don't have anything to do with CORS settings. We are still trying to narrow what those exact circumstances are but it appears it's when the m3u8 is temporarily empty due to live streaming issues on the broadcasters side.\n. Sometimes the player just displays 'network error' and publishes the entire playlist links in text with a black screen and at times the player crashes altogether and all controls and menu options disappear. The only way to remedy this is to completely reload the page. See the following screenshots from two recent occasions:\nhttp://live.livingstreams.tv/2018-05-29-Error.png\nhttp://live.livingstreams.tv/2018-05-31-Error.png\nSteps to reproduce:\n- Open: http://live.livingstreams.tv/test.html\n- Open the playlist menu near the bottom right of the player\n- Disconnect from the internet\n- Choose an item on the playlist.\nThe player will then time out and then publish the playlist links on the screen and sometimes the player will crash itself and fail to show any controls or menu options.\nAlthough the above reproduction steps require disconnecting from the internet, this problem still occurs intermittently even when connected to the internet and seems to be triggered by a hls link being temporarily unavailable or possibly timing out.\nThe ideal outcome would be to have a more user friendly message displayed and for the player to never crash and remove the controls/menu options from the user. Users having to refresh/reload the page to continue on after the problem occurs is not an ignorable/tolerable bug.. ",
