I think it works.\nI confirmed on Windows (both Raisins (0.r1134) and Policeman (0.r1414)) only though.\n\nclass TestLocation < Shoes\n  url '/', :works\n  url '/no_works', :not_works\n  def not_works\n    para(\"this one does not:\")\n    para(app.location)\n  end\n  def works\n    p = para(\"this one works:\")\n    para(app.location)\n    para(link(\"try the other way\",:click => \"/no_works\"))\n  end\nend\nShoes.app\n\n. Delete list_box like this:\n50.times { edit_line; radio; }\nThis issue can be solved.\nI think this is a problem of list_box.\n. Now Policeman (Shoes-0.r1414 for Windows) includes rubygems 1.3.6 and can execute samples/simple-rubygems.rb fine. \n. Hi andhapp and i5m,\nShoes for Windows doesn't seem to have this issue.\n. Hi andhapp,\n\nthe length of the text is more than the width of the box.\n\nThat's right.   \u3000\nBut doesn't need to wrap, because it can scroll in a horizontal direction.\n. andhapp\nUmm... I'm not sure. But my understanding is:\n- edit_line: scroll in a horizontal direction\n- edit_box : turn down at right edge\n. Fixed the bug. Commit is this: http://github.com/ashbb/shoes/commit/3687601b8a4fee189fe9aa27cb840c5467bb8b55\n. Hi all,\nPlease try Policeman (Shoes-0.r1414.exe) Packager.\n. I could build Policeman with Ubuntu Linux 2.6.\nLook at a tiny note. \nHope this helps,\nashbb\n. > I did a workaround by placing a rect element directly under the the arrow, which detects the clicks. But that's not a very nice solution.\nHow about this one? You can get the same effect a little bit easier. \n\nShoes.app do\n  @arrow1 = image top: 50, left: 50, width: 50, height: 50 do\n    arrow(25,25,50)\n  end\n  @arrow1.click { para \"Yo!\"}\nend\n\n. Hi i5m,\nOn Windows, it looks like both Raisins (Shoes-0.r1134) and Policeman (0.r1413) work the above code well. I confirmed with the following image files.\nhttp://www.rin-shun.com/shoes/test.gif\nhttp://www.rin-shun.com/shoes/test.png\nCould you confirm again?\nashbb\n. Yeah, Shoes can't change button text.\nBut this is not a bug. Because Shoes doesn't support text and text= methods in the Button class so far.\nShoes.app do\n  stack do\n    para \"button: #{Button.instance_methods.grep(/text/).join(' ')}\"\n    para \"para: #{Para.instance_methods.grep(/text/).join(' ')}\"\n  end\nend\nOutput is:\nbutton: \npara: text text=\nThe :text => \"Again\" is just a hash entry, not a method.\nShoes allows you any hash entries as method arguments like this:\nShoes.app do\n  bo = oval 100, 100, 100, fill: blue, say: 'I am blue.'\n  ro = oval 300, 100, 100, fill: red, say: 'I am red.'\n  [bo, ro].each{|o| o.click{alert o.style[:say]}}\nend\n. Please try to do like this:\nshoes.run -- -m\n. Hi csomay,\nAt last, fixed this issue. Please confirm with Shoes-0.r1420. Download from here.\nRegards,\nashbb\n. csomay,\nThank you for confirmation!\nYes, I followed the behavior of Raisins (Shoes-0.r1134) for Windows.\nIn Raisins for Windows, at first need to press tab to focus on top of elements (edit line1 in this case), shift-tab is not available. So, I decided to focus on top of elements with first tab or shift-tab.\nBut now, I realized that your suggestion was the same behavior as Policeman for Linux (Shoes-0.r1419). So, I changed the spec as same as Linux. ;-)\nPlease confirm again with Shoes-0.r1421. \n. Hi guai,\n1 at_exit\nYes. The at_exit method doesn't work in Shoes.\nBut, if you want to do something at closing your Shoes app, how about using close instead of exit ?\n\nShoes.app do\n  button 'exit' do\n    Shoes.show_log\n    info 'hi'\n    close\n  end\nend\n\n2 ObjectSpace.define_finalizer\nSeems to work... Try the following snippet.\nThe message will appear on the window after a while (after GC execute).\n\nclass Bar\n  def Bar.callback\n    proc{$msg = 'GC was executed.'}\n  end\n  def initialize\n    ObjectSpace.define_finalizer(self, Bar.callback)\n  end\nend\n\nShoes.app do\n  Bar.new\n  msg = para\n  every{msg.text = $msg}\nend\n\nps. I only confirmed the above two snippets on my Windows XP laptop with both Raisins (Shoes-0.r1134) and Policeman (Shoes-0.r1413)\nashbb\n. Hi Fela,\nThank you for the post. :)\nBut Policeman doesn't support Deadkeys so far, sorry...\nNow on Linux, right-alt/-ctl/-shift keys are not available.\nOn Windows, they are available, but just do the same behavior as left-alt/-ctl/-shift keys.\nOn OSX, I'm not sure but I guess the same as Linux.\nWe'll add Deadkeys support into ToDo list. ;-)\nRegards,\nashbb\n. Yeah, that's a bug. But it's difficult to fix so far.\nSo, please use alternative ways:\n```\nclass Shoes::Types::Para\n  def foo\n     \"i am foo\"\n  end\nend\nShoes::Para.class_eval do\n  def bar\n    \"i am bar\"\n  end\nend\nShoes.app do\n  p = para\n  para p.foo\n  para p.bar\nend\n```\nYou can see the output: i am foo i am bar on the Shoes window.\n. IMHO, this behavior is reasonable.\nTry to run this snippet:\nShoes.app width: 300, height: 300 do\n  s = stack height: \"100%\" do\n    w, h = para, para\n    animate{w.text, h.text = s.width, s.height}\n  end\nend\nOnline demo is here.\nBecause Shoes can show/use vertical scrollbar.\n. Oh,... okay. I understand what you're saying.\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\nAlthough I parsonally feel that this behavior is not so bad. :-P\nBut, Shoes can't tell the following difference so far:\n- user resized the slot height by hand\n- some elements touched the edge of the slot\nSo, Shoes makes scrollbar appear automatically in both cases...\n. Additional information.\nWidth and height are not static constraints, just only initial parameters, I guess. ;-)\n. fela, you are totally right. :)\nBut please run the following snippet and look at manual on Position of a Slot, style() section.\nstyle[:height] is used to get the dimensions originally requested.\nShoes.app width: 300 do\n  s = stack height: \"100%\" do\n    background green\n    h1, h2 = para, para\n    button('set height pixel 200'){s.style height: 200}\n    button('set height style \"100%\"'){s.style height: \"100%\"}\n    animate{h1.text, h2.text = s.style[:height], s.height}\n  end\nend\nOkay, I guess the problem is what \"100%\" means to.\nI think it means to real height (max scrollable height).\nBut you think visible height (not max scrollable height).    \nI'm not sure which is more reasonable, though...\n. Ohhh, it works! I didn't notice at all. Awesome!\n. Closing due to not being a bug for now. ;-)\n. A tiny note is here. It's not a good documentation, though...\nHope this helps. :)\n. Oh suggestion, thanks.\nBut sorry, I can't imagin the feature you suggest (want to add) to Shoes.\nWhat is Tray Icons? Could you explain your request a bit more detail?\n. Umm... just looks like the area where places icons...\nIf so, you can write your Shoes app with image method and :click option.\nI think it's not so difficult. What feature do you need?\n. How about using Shoes.APPS?\nThis is a tiny sample snippet. Do you need another feature?\nq = {}\n%w[ashbb Steve Fela].each do |name|\n  blk = lambda do\n    q[self] = []\n    keypress{|k| Shoes.APPS.each{|s| q[s] << k}}\n    msg = para\n    every{msg.replace q[self]}\n  end\n  Shoes.app title: name, width: 300, height: 300, &blk\nend\n. The remove method does just only passing the object to Ruby's GC (Garbage Collection). So, if you want to repaint Shoes window immediately, use clear method. \n. Yeah. More properly, clear method calls each element's remove method and then calls shoes_canvas_repaint_all() function in C.\n. Thank you for the post. :)\nA simple test case is this:\nShoes.app do\n  stack left: 50, top: 50, width: 300, height: 300, scroll: true do\n    background green\n    @msg = para\n  end\n  e = every do |i|\n    @msg.text += \"#{i}\\n\"\n    e.stop if i > 20\n  end\nend\nAnd a workaround is this:\nShoes.app do\n  nostroke\n  rect left: 50, top: 50, width: 300, height: 300, fill: green\n  stack left: 50, top: 50, width: 300, height: 300, scroll: true do\n    @msg = para\n  end\n  e = every do |i|\n    @msg.text += \"#{i}\\n\"\n    e.stop if i > 20\n  end\nend\nI think this is not a bug. Because background is not a color option of slot, but a normal element in Shoes. They are independent. \n. I confirmed this issue,\n- Raisins (0.r1134) for Windows: no freeze, but nothing happen (not open alert message window)\n- Policeman (0.r1486) for Windows: freeze\n\nI just noticed that a program with just one alert statement never returns\n\nYes, I think you are right. So, a workaround is this:\nShoes.app do\n  Thread.new do\n    timer(0.01){alert(\"Hello, world!\")}\n  end\nend\nThis snippet works with both Raisins and Policeman.\n. I think it's better to not use sleep method. sleep stops everything, so your code can't do anything.\n\nBecause it would be really useful for Hackety Hack, as quite some lessons use ask and sleep\n\nUmm... I don't think sleep is so useful.\nCould you show us a few real snippets? Someone may find a solution.\n. I guess _why's original lessons are old.\nI found http://www.mail-archive.com/shoes@code.whytheluckystiff.net/msg00193.html in the old Shoes ML. Hope this helps.\n. Umm... what platform are you using?\nI run the following snippet on Windows 7 with Policeman 0.r1503.\nThe size of background seems correct (= 300pix)...\nShoes.app do\n  stack :height => 300, :margin_right=> gutter, :scroll => true do\n    background yellow\n    para \"abcd\"\n    para \"abcd\"\n    para \"abcd\"\n    para \"abcd\"\n    para \"abcd\"\n    para \"abcd\"\n    para \"abcd\"\n    para \"abcd\"\n    para \"abcd\"\n    para \"abcd\"\n    para \"abcd\"\n    para \"abcd\"\n    para \"abcd\"\n    para \"abcd\"\n    para \"abcd\"\n    para \"abcd\"\n    para \"abcd\"\n    para \"abcd\"\n    para \"abcd\"\n    para \"abcd\"\n    para \"abcd\"\n    para \"abcd\"\n    para \"abcd\"\n  end\n  line 0, 300, 300, 300\nend\n. Oh, now I confirmed. This is a bug. But for Linux, not Windows.\nI can't confirm with Mac, though...\n. Oh, yeah. This is a known bug. Please launch Shoes 3 with --nolayered option like this: shoes --nolayered\n. Okay. At first download mp4 file by hand. Then edit simple-video.rb like this: @vid = video \"AdventureTimewithFinnandJakeFinnTime.mp4\". You can watch the video with Shoes from local disk. \n. Yes. Video flickers when mouse hovers/leaved.\nBut, video returns after a few seconds? Umm,... I'm not sure, but maybe need more machine power... or find another solution...\n. Looks cool! Thanks. I've merged your great work into my repo (ashbb/shoes) for now. :)\n. I confirmed with Sheos 3 on my Windows 7 laptop.\nI could copy and paste with each ctl-c and ctl-v in edit_box.\n. On my Windows 7 laptop with Shoes 3, the following two worked well.\n- https://gist.github.com/59ec645589475ba77c23\n- http://gist.github.com/289714\nAnd after I edited shoes/lib/shoes.rb line 22 a little like this, just added US_ASCII:\n%w[ASCII_8BIT UTF_16BE UTF_16LE UTF_32BE UTF_32LE US_ASCII].each do |ec|\nthe following also worked well.\n- http://gist.github.com/257819\n\nShoes.setup do\n  gem 'mechanize'\nend\n\nrequire 'rubygems'\nrequire 'mechanize'\n\nShoes.app do\n  Agent = Mechanize::Mechanize.new\n  page = Agent.get('http://www.google.com/')\n  para page.body\nend\n\n. I've recreated your issue on my Windows 7 laptop with Shoes 3.\nThis is an alternative:\nShoes.app do\n  stack top: height - 45, left: width - 180 do\n    para \"I'm a footnote of sorts.\"\n  end\nend\nNot so cool, though...\n. This issue is a bug, not user error. But it's not so easy to fix, I guess. :(\n. Revised a little like this. Then it works on my Windows 7 with Shoes 3.\n```\nShoes.app :width => 600, :height => 600 do\n  nostroke\n  #draw_circle(self, 0.9, 600)\ndef draw_circle(app, color, size)\n    r = size/2\n    app.fill gray(color)\n    app.oval app.width/2 - r, 0, size, size\n    draw_circle(app, color - 0.04, 3*size/4) if (color > 0.4)\n  end\n  draw_circle(self, 0.9, 600)\nend\n```\n. In Windows, native widgets - edit_line, edit_box, button, etc. - don't pass  or return or etc. to Shoes. I'm not sure there is a loophole.\nSo, how about using Shoes.hook method for one of the alternative ways?\n\ndef Shoes.hook\n  window width: 200, height: 100 do\n    button('manual'){Shoes.show_manual}\n    button('console'){Shoes.show_log}\n  end\nend\n\nShoes.app do\n  stack do\n    para(\"Enter text, press button.  won't work.\")\n    flow do\n      @entry = edit_line\n      @button = button(\"add_para\") do\n        para(@entry.text)\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nAs you press enter key in the edit_line, small window will be come up.\n. The code works well on my Windows XP and 7. Confirmed with Shoes 3 (0.r1514). Looks like an issue for only OSX.\n. This is intended. It should be said a restriction, but not a bug. If you want to catch all keys user input, use keypress method. \n. Hi Cecil,\nUmm,.. I ran your snippet on my Windows 7 and Ubuntu on VirtualBox.\nIt worked and got no error.\nI'm using ruby 1.9.1p376 on Ubuntu on VirtualBox.\nI'm not sure that is a reason, though...\nBut have to need to edit your code a little like this:\n\nedit_line text: \"#{Dir.pwd}\"\n\nThis is one of difference from Red Shoes. :-P\nashbb\n. Oops, your question is about Red Shoes, sorry. xx-P\nI confirmed with Red Shoes3 (0.r1514) for Windows and Red Shoes3 (0.r1520) for Linux on Ubuntu on VertualBox.\nBoth worked and got no error.\n. Hi Onno,\n\nDo I need to put all my code in one rb file?\n\nNo. :)\nYou can make .shy file. Try out the following.\n- save the following three .rb files (a.rb, b.rb, c.rb) under c:\\tmp\\abc directory\n\n# a.rb\nrequire_relative 'b'\nrequire_relative 'c'\ninclude B\ninclude C\nShoes.app do\n  hello\n  hi\nend\n\n# b.rb\nmodule B\n  def hello\n    para 'hello'\n  end\nend\n\n# c.rb\nmodule C\n  def hi\n    para 'hi'\n  end\nend\n\n\nopen Shoes and click `Package an App' link  \nselect c:\\tmp\\abc\\a.rb file  \nfill in Project Name, Version, Your Name and click Build .shy button  \nyou will get abc.shy file under c:\\tmp directory  \n\nThen just double-click abc.shy file to launch your Shoes app.\nHope this helps,\nashbb\n. Hi karatedog,\nDo you mention about Green Shoes? ;-)\nIf so, yes you are right. Green Shoes' Rect and Oval paint a line around the INSIDE of a shape, not the outside. They are the same as Border.\nTry out the following with Red Shoes and Green Shoes.\nYou can find the difference.\n\nShoes.app do\n nofill\n strokewidth 20\n rect 0, 0, 100, 100\nend\n\nI like this spec, but may need to prepare the Red Shoes compatible mode.\n. > I tried it in Red Shoes.\nOh, sorry. I didn't check your code in the first post. xx-P\nIn Green Shoes, the rect() method is not available within the shape() block so far.\nNow I understood your first problem.\nYes, you are right. The rect() method seems to be not available any options. Look at this:\n\nShoes.app do\n def my_sqare(width, color, x1, y1, x2, y2)\n   strokewidth(width)\n   nofill\n   shape do\n     rect(x1, y1, x2, y2, stroke: color)\n   end\n end\n my_sqare(1, red, 50, 50, 100, 100)\nend\n\nThe above rectangle is black...\nAs the result of trial and error, I got a solution for your first problem. Try out the following. I'm not sure why, though. :-P\n\nShoes.app do\n def my_sqare(width, color, x1, y1, x2, y2)\n   strokewidth(width)\n   stroke(color)\n   nofill\n   shape do\n     rect(x1, y1, x2, y2, strokewidth: 0)\n     move_to(x1, y1)\n     line_to(x2, y1)\n     line_to(x2, y2)\n     line_to(x1, y2)\n     line_to(x1, y1)\n   end\n end\n my_sqare(1, black, 50, 50, 100, 100)\nend\n\n\nIs Green Shoes available on Linux?\n\nYes. Green Shoes is a gem. So, try out just: sudo gem install green_shoes\n\nQuestion 2: is it possible to somehow draw a top-level menu,\na right-click menu in Shoes?\n\nShoes has not any menu functions. But, you can write by yourself. ;-)\nLook at this sample. Not so cool, but an idea for pull down menu.\n. Okay, I'll translate them and send you the updated manual-ja.txt.\n. Confirmed the above snippet with Shoes 3 on Windows 7.\nIt was not crashed, but didn't show \"Select boom (ft):\" until hovering the mouse cursor over a list_box.\nAfter some trial and error, I got a work around. Try out the following:\nstack  :width=>\"33%\", :height=> 200 do \n  background yellow\n  para strong \"CRANE\"\n  @model_slot = flow{crane_model}\n  @boom_slot = flow{crane_boom}\nend\nShoes sometimes needs both :width and :height explicitly.\n. Shoes extracts .shy file under your TEMP directory. So, it will write a file, antler.rb, under TEMP.\nTry out the following. ;-)\nShoes.app do\n  def write_file\n    para \"trying to write a file\"\n    #file_name = 'antler.rb'\n    file_name = ask_save_file\n    opf = File.open(file_name , 'w')\n    opf.puts \"antler written\"\n    opf.close\n  end\n  write_file\nend\n. Umm,... strange. It can be made neither LARGER nor SMALLER on my Windows 7 with Shoes 3 (0.r1514). This issue may happen on Linux only...\nps. Two trivial typos. full -> fill, ;radius -> :radius.\n. Umm,... I think the following (the manual says) is correct.\n\nAbsolute URLs (such as http://google.com) are okay, but google.com (without http://) won't work.   \n. This opens Google in your browser.\n\nShoes.app{visit 'http://google.com'}\nBut this doesn't.\nShoes.app{visit 'google.com'}\n. Try out this commit.\n. Hi JayTeeSF and folks,\nI confirmed the issue on my Windows 7 with Shoes 3.\nTry out the following. I think it may be an alternative solution.\n\nShoes.app do\n  radio_one = radio(\"group\", checked: true); para \"one\"\n  radio_two = radio(\"group\"); para \"two\"\n  start do\n    alert(radio_one.checked? ? \"ok\" : \"failed\")\n  end\nend\n\nashbb\n. Hi xuinkrbin,\nTry to add .to_s like this: p = button h[0].to_s. ;-)\nashbb\n. Hi Eric,\nI tried the following to confirm your problem with Shoes-0.r1783 for Windows. \n- create c:\\tmp\\book directory and put class-book.rb and class-book.yaml\n- run shoes.exe (r1783)\n- click Package an App. link\n- select book directory and create book.shy\n- run shoes.exe again\n- click Open an App. link\n- select book.shy\nThere was no error...\nCould you share your dictionary.shy? I'd like to try it out.\n. Oops, now I realized your dictionary.shy. I'll check it out from now.\n. Your dictionary.shy seems to work well with Shoes-0.r1783 for Windows.\nI can see a Enter a Word textblock, an edit_line and a ok button on the Shoes window. Although I get the No definition found for xxxx. Sorry this doesn't actually work. message, whenever I put any word into edit_line.\n. Hi Eric,\nYou are right!\nI ran the following snippet with my Shoes-0.r1783 for Windows.\nruby\nShoes.app do\n  para require 'yaml'\n  para YAML\nend\nI got this result:\n\nfalse Syck\n\nand this error message on Shoes console window:\n\nWarn: It seems your ruby installation is missing psych (for YAML output).\n\n. @DouglasAllen \n\nI have Ruby-1.9.3-p194 but the wiki wants 1.9.2\n\nAre you using Ruby 1.9.3? If so, refer to Red Shoes for Windows with Ruby 1.9.3p125.\nBut honestly I didn't build Red Shoes for Windows for over half a year. So, I'm not sure the article is still useful...\n. @DouglasAllen Is your problem downloading dependency files?\nIf so, I'm so sorry to say nothing about that...\nThe rake-download-task doesn't work well. You have to download all files by hand.\nAfter downloading all files by hand, you can do rake.\nThen the rake skips downloading task and use files you already downloaded by hand.\n. @DouglasAllen Wow, fantastic!\n\nIs there a shoes app command that will tell you the version of Ruby?\n\nruby\nShoes.app do\n  para RUBY_VERSION, ' ', RUBY_PATCHLEVEL\nend\n\nThe shoes version is still shoes policeman (0.r1554)\n\nBecause you are using ashbb/shoes/tree/master branch.\nRed Shoes version is the number of commit lists: git rev-list HEAD.split.length + 1\nThe ashbb/shoes/tree/develop is 0.r1805 now. The shoes/shoes/tree/develop is 0.r1823.\nAfter 0.r1783, I've not tried to build Red Shoes. So, I'm not sure you can use the latest code for Windows, though... :-P\n. Yeah, this is a bad spec, may be a bug of Red Shoes, IMHO. So, I decided to change the behavior in Green and Purple Shoes.\n@nashby \nIt's not  because of chipmunk.rb. Look at this: https://github.com/shoes/shoes/blob/develop/shoes/canvas.c#L508\nIn Red Shoes, radius seems to be set to width.\n. Hi huettiemail,\n\nThe program I am running is very simple and always crashs after short time:\n\nUmm,... strange. I've been running the code you showed in the first post with Shoes 3 (0.r1514) on my Windows 7 laptop. But it is still working. It doesn't crash at least for ten minutes.\nLook at this. That is my r1783 version Cecil mentioned. \nHope it helps,\nashbb\n. A bug on only Mac?\nI ran the snippet with Shoes 0.r1514 and 0.r1783 on Windows 7. Both worked well.\n. Sorry for my late reply.\nTry out the following snippet with shoes-0.r1783.exe. (Refer to Red Shoes for Windows with Ruby 1.9.3p125)\nruby\nShoes.setup do\n  gem 'multi_json'\nend\nShoes.app do\n  para require 'multi_json'\nend\n. Ah, sorry. Because we don't prepare the environment for Shoes-0.r1783.\nIf you want to package your app with Shoes-0.r1783 (meaning: make the your_app.exe file included Shoes-0.r1783), you need to do the following steps by hand.\n- I guess that you can find latest_shoes.exe under HOME\\.shoes\\policeman\\win32.\n- Rename Shoes-0.r1783.exe to latest_shoes.exe and replace the file you found on the first step.\n- Then run Shoes and click Package an App. link and check Windows only and select Yes, I want Shoes included..\n. > hmmm, this didn't work.\nWill you let me know about the detail?\n\nwhen i package my rb file more than once, it seems to be loading some kind of cache instead of my latest updated document\n\nOh, you found a bug!\nI confirmed the problem on my Windows 7. But sorry, I have no solution for now...\nSo, please delete all cache files by hand and try to package again.\nThere are cache files under your TMP directory.\n. Umm,... strange. Watch this. On my Windows 7, looks fine, though...\n. Are you using Shoes3 (0.r1514)? If so, I guess that there is a gem which requires rubygems over 1.3.5.\nWhat platform are you using? If you use Windows, try out shoes-0.r1783.\n. Hi Kiswono,\nOh, you are using Green Shoes. Thanks! :-D\nI confirmed your problems on my Windows 7 with Green Shoes 1.1.362.\nLooks strange. There might be a bug. But sorry, I have no time today to deal with the problems.\nSo, try out the following snippet I've edited a little bit. \n``` ruby\nrequire 'green_shoes'\nShoes.app(:width => 300, :height => 400) do\n  fill rgb(0, 0.6, 0.9, 0.1)\n  stroke rgb(0, 0.6, 0.9)\n  strokewidth 0.25\n  100.times do\n    oval(\n      :left => (-5..self.width).rand,\n      :top => (-5..self.height).rand,\n      :radius => (25..50).rand\n    )\n  end\n  ox, oy = nil, nil\n  stroke red\n  click do |b, x, y|\n    strokewidth 0.25\n    line( ox, oy, x, y ) if b == 1 and !ox.nil?\n    strokewidth 0.25\n    oval(\n      :left => x-12,\n      :top => y-12,\n      :radius => 24\n      ) if b == 1\n    ox, oy = x, y\n  end\nend\n```\nIt works for me like this.\nHope this helps,\nashbb\n. Umm,... on Windows 7, ctrl-v is available in editlines or editboxes. Sorry, I can't confirm on Linux now. Hope someone Linux user will reply.\n. Fixed Japanese manual text, too. See this commit.\n\n---> also: this change should be publicized to the other colors of shoes\n\nYeah. I'll fix on Green and Purple later.\n. @shideneyu Try out the following. You will see 'hello world!'. ;-)\nSolution 1\n``` ruby\na.rb\n@a = 'hello world!'\ntest.rb\nShoes.app do\n  eval IO.read('a.rb')\n  alert @a\nend\n```\nSolution 2\n``` ruby\na.rb\n$a = 'hello world!'\ntest.rb\nShoes.app do\n  load 'a.rb'\n  alert $a\nend\n```\n. @shideneyu \nThanks for reporting the issue. :)\nI tried to run the above snippet with Shoes 3 (0.r1514) on my Windows 7.\nBut I couldn't recreate the issue. The block is always called once, not twice.\nWhat platform are you using? What version of Shoes are you using?\n. @jessc How about the following?\n``` ruby\nclass ManyFileEditor\n  def main_window(foobar)\n    s = self\n    foobar.app do\n      @main_window =flow do\n        para \"main_window\"\n        button \"Hide\" do\n          para \"second\"\n          @main_window.hide()\n          @editing_window = s.editing_window(foobar)\n          @editing_window.show()\n        end\n      end\n    end\n  end\ndef editing_window(foobar)\n    f = nil\n    foobar.app do\n      f = flow do\n        para \"editing_window\"\n      end\n    end\n    f\n  end\ndef initialize(foobar)\n    main_window(foobar)\n  end\nend\nShoes.app :title => \"Many File Editor\" do\n  @many_file_editor = ManyFileEditor.new(self)\nend\n```\n. Oh, strange! I confirmed the \"infinitely scrolling window\" on my Windows 7 with Shoes 3 (0.r1514). I think that you found a bug. :-P\n. Hi @stlewis, Interesting!\nWe've been developing Shoes 4 now. Shoes 4 will be published at RubyGems.org as a gem. So, I think it's cool if you upload your shoes_app_wrapper as a gem for Shoes 4. ;-)\n. @xslackx Try out the following snippet. :)\nruby\nShoes.app do\n  stack do\n    user_name = \"User name (a): \"\n    para user_name\n    @n = edit_line\n    button \"Script\" do\n      self.clipboard = user_name + @n.text\n    end\n  end\nend\n. > now I help several others to optimize the work we do helping people with computers from schools in S\u00e3o Paulo\nWow, fantastic! Glad to hear that. Have fun with Shoes! :-D\n. ",
    "atomicules": "Evan, ashbb, \ntested ashbb's snippet on OSX PPC Raisins and Policeman and it works. \n. I've never had any problem with Shoes.setup on Windows (well Proxies, but that's not really Shoes' fault). However, I notice in Ashbb's latest builds Rubygems has been updated to 1.3.1. I.e. doing:\nShoes.app do\n    para Gem::RubyGemsVersion\nend\nreports \"1.3.1\". So it's probable this issue will get closed out when Policeman is done.\n. Hi Anuj/andhapp,\nI've been going through some of the Shoes questions on Stackoverflow and found this same issue issue mentioned here: Alignment of edit_line. There is an answer that mentions a possible fix:\nIn shoes/shoes/ruby.c\n```\nifdef SHOES_QUARTZ\n//place.x += 4; place.ix += 4; //Comment out these lines to align boxes\n//place.y += 4; place.iy += 4; //Comment out these lines to align boxes\nplace.h += 4; place.ih += 4;\nplace.w += 4; place.iw += 4;\n\n#endif\n```\nI built Shoes on OSX PPC with this fix and it did indeed align the text boxes, but I didn't do any extensive checking to see if it had other undesirable consequences elsewhere.\n. A commit for this fix, but tagged as osxppc only for now: http://github.com/i5m/shoes/commit/50e64a6a44cc1b8b8dad40599919f74c819423fd\n. Seems like this is related to issue 5. Please see my comment there.\n. This somewhat works as intended on OSX PPC: Hovering on \"point there\" does nothing. Hovering on \"point here\" changes to hand, most of the time, sometimes it doesn't, but don't know why.\n. This can be closed out. This was actually fixed back in August. See these two commits:\na10af621fcf2f1dc86386460a9817b2a932a6084\n689480d383b4de6a7a758681d0a70c239471d89c\nYou can back-port this to Raisins by replacing the pack.rb file with the latest.\n. That is a good idea. I.e. Repackage Raisins with new pack.rb. That or we start putting Policeman builds up somewhere. Or just release a patch for Raisins.  That might be best. \n. Closing this as although it is/was a nice idea to back-port fixes to Raisins and make a new Raisins release we have not had enough resource available. Once Shoes 3 is officially released this issue is redundant anyway and there are already builds available for Shoes 3. Plus, users can - if they want - fix Raisins by replacing the pack.rb file.\n. See mkelly's fork: http://github.com/mkelly/shoes and deps: http://github.com/mkelly/shoes/downloads \n. Yes, the main shoes/shoes now builds on Snow Leopard. See this email thread, and the wiki.\n. I'd be interested to hear if anyone has got Shoes to build on 64bit linux. Please consider posting to the mailing list if you are trying to build on 64bit Linux, as we also have someone attempting on Snow Leopard (64 bit OSX). Build problems could be related.\n. Zaius, you got it to build on 64bit Linux? Fantastic! It really would be a great help if you could figure out what steps you had to do. Here is someone else's recent attempt, 64 Bit Arch\n. Zaius, thanks very much for the info. \n. It's interesting that it runs at all. As far as I know, no one has got Shoes to build on Snow Leopard yet, until we do then there's not much we can do to fix crashes. Have you tried running some of the sample apps that come with Shoes? It would be interesting to know if it crashes with everything or just certain apps. Also whether crashes are repeatable.\n. blooptech, thanks for the info and link. Someone else trying to build on Snow Leopard, but with a different approach: trying to build everything as 32 bit so the Carbon code (GetWindowPort(), etc) would still work. I'll point them to your comment.\n(Their last email can be found by going here: http://librelist.com/browser/ selecting the Shoes list and clicking on 06-Feb).\nIt would be great to get everything to Cocoa, if anyone wants to take it on it would be much appreciated.\n. This issue can probably be merged with 12 (Building on Snow Leopard). See this comment there: http://github.com/shoes/shoes/issues/#issue/12/comment/257561\n. This issue is a duplicate of issue 11. Please see that issue for a fix.\n. What platform are you trying to build on? Linux? As far as I know it should build fine on 32 bit Linux. I see references to Ruby 1.8, the latest Shoes code probably requires 1.9 now. Please provide a bit more info, or post to the mailing list and one of the Linux users will be able to help out. \n. Pronix is using \"fedora12 - 32bit and ruby 1,8.6\". Posted to Shoes mailing list to request help from Linux users.\n. Tranquility, what platform are you on. I've just tried the following on Windows:\nShoes.app do\n@arrow = arrow(50,50,50)\n@arrow.click { para \"Yo!\"}\nend\nThe arrow seems to detect clicks in the lower half of the arrow-head (doesn't detect clicks in the tail). So when I move this to it's default position:\nShoes.app do\n@arrow = arrow(0,0,50)\n@arrow.click { para \"Yo!\"}\nend\nIt still detected clicks, since the part that is visible is the part that detects clicks.\n. Hi ashbb, \nhow very strange. I've checked again and it works in both Raisins and Policeman. Perhaps it was to do with how I created the PNG? Although I just created another one from scratch using Paint.NET and it worked as well.\nClosing out this issue.\n. Ok. This can go down as a feature for a release after Policeman. Unfortunately I don't have access to tag this as Mustard, etc.\n. Steve,\nI just checked with Shoes 3 (1514) on windows XP and the first example now works as intended. \nThe second issue (\" for console. Not with an entry!\") is still a problem.\nHowever, I think this can be closed out, although it would be nice to know exactly what fixed this rather than saying \"ashbb's magic\".\n. This seems like it can't find the gem. Have you done Shoes.setup to install the gem?\n. But in IRB, you will be using the OSX system Ruby. Shoes comes with it's own version of Ruby and must also have it's own Gems installed. \n. Try doing the following in your Shoes application:\nShoes.setup do\n    gem 'json'\nend\nrequire 'rubygems'\nrequire 'json'\nShoes.app do\n     #Your applicaton\nend\n. Also, for this particular gem (json), this issue can be considered closed for Shoes Policeman since it is now included with Shoes.\n. Too clever, by half. Great work ashbb.\n. #1 Works on OSX PPC Shoes Raisins and Policeman (r1298)\n2 Works on OSX PPC Shoes Raisins, but not Policeman (message never appears) - don't know why (could be that build is a little bit behind with other changes?)\n. Micah, It might be worth just rolling back the Rakefile a bit. For instance, I can build all the latest code on 10.5 PPC, but I have to use my branch of an older Rakefile. As of yet I just haven't had the time to look and see what breaks it for me in the newer Rakefile.\n. Can this be considered closed now, considering your recent work? (Issues 44, 45)\n. This is the obvious easy fix (fix the manual), but might want to look into whether a default should be assumed for :top if not given in conjunction with a :left.\n. This is probably a conflicting path issue. What do you get if you do: which ruby, etc?\n. Perhaps similar to the other encoding issues we came across? \nhttp://gist.github.com/289714\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/shoooes/browse_thread/thread/a3c9ddefce27e5b8\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/shoooes/browse_thread/thread/4ffb5db404a55bf1\nBy the way, crashes on windows XP with Shoes 3 (r1514)\n. You closed this (issue 19) as a feature request ;-) \n. Onno,\n\nDo I need to put all my code in one rb file?\n\nNo. You can package up apps that have more than one file/folder, but you have to call the packager from the command line: shoes --package\n\nAlso, what to do with gem files?\n\nIn an ideal world, you just do;\nShoes.setup do\n    gem 'flickraw'\nend\nat the start of your shoes app and on first run it will download and install the gem if required. However...\n\nWill this work behind a firewall?\n\nI've had lots of trouble here in the past, especially on windows. It's required manually setting http_proxy environment variables, and altering Shoes code to remove the resolv-replace bit which is actually meant to help on windows, but it will depend on your environment. This is for me at work behind a very difficult firewall.\nSo it maybe best practice to package up the gem locally (you'll have to do this manually, so how easy this is will depend on the gem) with your app and include Shoes itself if you are distributing it behind a firewall.\n.

No worries about the long paste; but you can use http://gist.github.com to make it a bit easier. ;)\nFirst things first: how did you install glib?\n. hm. Okay.\nSee, when I build on Snow Leopard, I actually build 99% of the dependancies by hand... but, what it looks like here is that you don't have the glib development headers installed. I'm not sure how to do that with brew, it's glib2-devel on macports.\nI'd try to get that going first.\n. Since I haven't heard from you in a while, I'm closing this issue.

Hey maca-\nWhich version of Shoes is this? Where did you grab it from?\n. Okay. So you used the 10.5 intel build?\n. Okay. I forget who built the 10.5 build; it was built a few weeks ago by someone, so the code is probably out of date...\nThe 10.6 build is 64 bit, so that would have been your problem.\n. I only have access to a 64 bit 10.6 machine, and so I can't build one myself... there's another guy who posted to the mailing list, said he was going to make one... \nWhat happened when you tried to build it?

I'm certainly not opposed to this. I'll pull it in with my next batch.\n. I don't know why the pull request was closed, but I just merged this into master.\n. No problem.\n. The $LOAD_PATH issue makes me suspect you're running Ruby 1.9.2, is this the case? Shoes needs to be built with 1.9.1.\n. I'm going to close this since we haven't heard from you in a while. Feel free to re-open if it's still a problem.\n. I've reworded this issue slightly, and posted it as a new issue, here: http://github.com/shoes/shoes/issues/issue/59\nThe core is that apparently shoes --ruby is horribly broken, and arguing over the validity of the value of 'puts hello' isn't constructive.\n. Thanks ash! At least it's only one platform...\n. Copy/paste is working in the Hackety Hack main window, though, so this seems to be a bit more isolated... more testing shall ensue.\n. In the hackety, we actually have our own clipboard, so that's why it works... copy/paste does not work on an edit_box either.\n. Can you try the second build?\nhttp://shoesrb.com/downloads\n. Cool. It's only a few revisions behind. I think when I built that last one, something screwy happened...\n. We weren't able to find anyone to build one. You could try building from source, but it's not the easiest thing to do :/. \nhttp://github.com/shoes/shoes/wiki/Building-Shoes-64-bit-for-Snow-Leopard\nhttp://github.com/shoes/shoes/wiki/BuildingShoesOnOSX\nThere were a lot of changes in OSX from 10.5 to 10.6...\n. That would be really fantastic. If I can be of any help at all, steve+shoes@steveklabnik.com will get a hold of me. A 10.5 build would be really great.\n. Does this help at all? It seemed to fix it for him... http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-talk/browse_thread/thread/4808a6e45ce2fb11/7d7511b914ee7a92?show_docid=7d7511b914ee7a92&pli=1\nI've never seen this error before. :/\n. No worries, whenever you get around to it. Open Source can't exactly say 'DO IT NOW!,' we're just thankful for some contribution. :)\n. Oh! I knew that. Sigh. Technically, Policeman only supports 1.9.1, so one built with 1.9.2 would be non-conforming. That said, the only reason we didn't do it with 1.9.2 is because it was released a week before the Shoes 3 deadline...\nAnyway, yeah, so if it can't find rake... what does 'which rake' say?\n. Hrm. \nDoing some googling, I found this gist: http://gist.github.com/519744\n. Since I haven't heard from you in a while, I'm closing this issue.

I've played around with this, and it seems that Ash's edit to shoes.rb would fix this. I want to do a little more testing, but the workaround works for now.\n. Fixed with commit 078608\n. Sounds fine by me. I'll get on this tonight.\n. Done.\n. I'm going to close this for now, because we're discussing it on the ML, here: http://librelist.com/browser//shoes/2010/10/28/a-few-thoughts-about-the-manual/\nPeople don't get email updates here, if we come to some sort of decision on what action needs to be taken, let's make issues about those.\n. This is called when shoes tries to build gems with native extensions, so... that might be one of the reasons that is broken.\n. Adding this to the roadmap, under 'native shoes extensions.'\n. No longer on Snow Leopard HEAD either. :)\n. This seems to be solved by now.\n. Ah! Looking slightly closer, I get this too.\nThis'll help...\n. Trying this today, I get 'no such file to load: binject'.\n. I'm going to close this, since it's not really fixable.\n. \nNothing in the console.\n. Closing, #84 is a dup.\n. Hey, thanks for this. Moving to Ruby 1.9.2 is an objective for the future of Shoes, for sure... I'm going to wait to pull this in, as I'm planning on making a branch to improve our build process very soon, and will pull it in there first.\n. Pulled into a feature branch, just for this. feature/1.9.2.\n. Interesting. So is this a bug? Hm.\n. yeah, I dont think this counts as a bug. Running it on my Policeman, I get 'no method error' because you haven't defined draw_circle. Makes sense. Define methods before you use them!\nMoving it after works. I've pushed to shoes-contrib, and closing this.\n. This actually works correctly on OSX, the window comes up.\nI'm not sure if this is fixable or not. Lemme look into it some more, it just might be broken. :/\n. This has to deal with the stealing of focus. I'd say this is a nofix for policeman, at least right now.\n. It's not debian specific, it's because Shoes is currently 1.9.1 only.\n1.9.2 work is underway on a branch here: https://github.com/shoes/shoes/tree/feature/1.9.2\nI have a personal todo to make the '1.9.1 only' stuff more clear in the documentation... I'm sorry this was confusing. The whole wiki needs cleanup...\n. No worries at all. Our documentation is pretty poor at the moment.\nWith those rakefile fixes, it should build with 1.9.2, yes. the only reason it hasn't been committed to master yet is that we also want shoes to actually use 1.9.2 for the next release as well, and that will require some more research, work, and testing....\nBut maybe that patch should be moved onto master first, anyway. You're not the first person to report this. Hm.\n. In response to this, I've merged the 1.9.2 building fix into master. It'll help people like you out in the meantime, until we get full 1.9.2 support within Shoes.\nThanks again for pointing this out.\n. Yep, just leave off VIDEO as a flag.\n. Yeowch.\n. Tagged, thanks.\n. tagged for Win7.\nIt has to do with 1.9.1's threads, apparently... i've been working on getting a 1.9.2 shoes going, but it's complicated...\n. I'm closing all feature request Issues, in favor of moving them to the wiki instead. This'll make it easier to lay them out into planning for future releases. Please see here. Thanks!\n. Cecil has made a commit recently that makes 1.8.7 build. I'm going to update the instructions to leave off VIDEO, until that issue is resolved.\nBut since this effectively is a dupe of those other issues, I'm closing.\n. I'm closing this, since it's a user error. It makes sense to me that trying to print unprintable characters is undefined behavior.\n. Whoops! Our debian (and ubuntu) instructions are apparently slightly out of date. It says ruby 1.8-dev, but Ruby 1.9 is needed to build Shoes.\nCan you try installing ruby1.9 and ruby1.9-dev, and compiling again? if that works, I'll update the instructions. Thanks!\n. Since I haven't heard from you in a while, I'm closing this issue. If you'd still like help building, please get in touch with me, or post to the shoes mailing list at shoes@librelist.com, and we'd be more than happy to try and work it out.\n. Merged!\n. Hm. No other output?\n. I can't reproduce this.\n. Pulled in, thank you!\n. Is this any window? Could you provide a sample of code that does this?\n. We're working on it. Vista Is totally terrible, and this is a high priority\nbug, right after 1.9.2 compliance.\nGotta fix crashes before we can fix display errors, you know?\n. Hi! This would be most excellent! I'd love to help take a crack at this.\nHere's the thing: I'm going to be taking off work to work on Shoes full-time. I won't be doing this for another ten days or so. So what do you say that we reconvene then and take a crack at it?\nIf you're champing at the bit to get going before then, you can check on the Shoes mailing list. A few people were working on this a few weeks ago: http://librelist.com/browser/shoes/ specifically http://librelist.com/browser//shoes/2011/5/24/building-shoes-for-32-bit-osx/\n. @wasnotrice yep, \"Core Duo\" is 32 bit, \"Core 2 Duo\" is 64.\nWe planned to support 32-bit with 10.5, and 64-bit with 10.6+. Haven't gotten the 10.5 build working.\n. Absolutely. :)\n. Strange. Confirmed on my system, too.\n. Oh, this is a dup of #66. I'm going to close that one, though, so that we can both get updates when I fix it.\n. Thanks ash.\n. This also works with HEAD on Snow Leopard. I'm considering it closed.\n. hahaha, dammit! I forgot.\n. I'm closing this, please reopen when you get the chance to come up with a smaller testcase, zzak.\n. Could you give me a test case for this, when you get the chance? I'll bang it out then.\n. This works for me as well, on OSX.\n. Sweeeeeet. I'll pull this in sometime tomorrow.\n. Merged! Thanks!\n. Merged, thank you!\n. You're going to have to gem install bundler.\nI'm closing this, and adding it to the instructions.\n. Both work fine for me on OSX.\nCecil, what linux are you using?\n. I just did this on ArchLinux, and it works.\nI'm going to close this as 'wontfix,' @ccoupe, since you rate it so low. ;) We can always re-open if this starts happening to someone else.\n. I'm closing this, since it isn't really an Issue. Can you post to our mailing list with these questions in the future? shoes@librelist.com\n. Have you tried this since then, does this problem still persist?\nI'm going to be re-doing the build system on Windows (see the feature/1.9.2 branch for my progress so far) soon, so it's possible this will become invalid after that.\n. I am almost sure this is not a bug with Shoes. It's probably in your implementation of set_exec_list.\nIf I set your line to @exec_lines.text = \"hey\", it does not add it every time.\nIf you can boil this down to a smaller test case that lets me deubug it fully, I'll re-open. Since I can't see your application code, there's not much more I can do.\n. I cannot reproduce this on my machine, closing.\n. Yeah, that's exactly what I mean. Your version string would be great. The 3.2 is the most important thing, rather than the old r number. It was taken directly from SVN back in the day...\n. This also works on OSX. I'll try to reproduce on XP later today.\n. Did you compile this shoes yourself? Or are you using the package?\n. > sorry for my bad english\nNo worries, your English is fine. :)\nDid you build Shoes with 1.9.2 or 1.9.1? \n. Okay. Could you try with 1.9.1 please? Technically, 1.9.2 support is experimental.\n. > edit: OK, i tried package install, seems to work, maybe it's the right solution :)\nWell, it's right in the sense that it works for you, but it's not in that it should compile and work for you. I build my copies of Shoes on Arch Linux, what distro are you on?\n. Are you sure? Where are you checking for the file? Is there anything in the\nShoes console?\nAlso, writing antlr grammars in a shoes app? Fun!\nOn Jun 3, 2011 9:31 AM, \"illeverbe\" \nreply@reply.github.com\nwrote:\n\nthis works in shoes but will not write a file when packaged.\nShoes.app do\ndef write_file\npara \"trying to write a file\"\nfile_name = 'antler.rb'\nopf = File.open(file_name , 'w')\nopf.puts \"antler written\"\nopf.close\nend\nwrite_file\nend\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/shoes/shoes/issues/106\n. The console is accessed by hitting either control-/ or alt-/, I forget which\non windows.\n\nAnd how did you package it? As a shy, or as a full exe?\n. Okay, but there are no other errors? That still makes me think it's getting written out somewhere, it'd throw an exception and it'd appear in the console otherwise.\nUhhh the package menu should have an option to build an exe. I don't remember off the top of my head for Windows, though, as I work mostly on the Mac, and packaging is terribly broken on it right now. :(\nThe packager is one of those fiddly bits of shoes that is mysterious and not well tested, so bug reports are great!\nCould you try this for me? Instead of using a relative path like 'antler.rb,' could you make it a full path, to somewhere you know exists? Like\nfile_name = 'C:\\Documents and Settings\\whatever\\something\\antler.rb'\nI don't know what your filesystem is set up to look like. But pick something. :) I feel like it's writing out the file, but somewhere strange.\nIf it's not, and there's no error message, I'm not sure how to help. :/\n. Excellent. :)\n. Well, I'm not sure why Rack would work anyway...\nThe version of Rubygems that's distributed with Shoes is 1.3.6 at the  moment. It'll be upgraded to 1.3.7 when we move Shoes to Ruby 1.9.2, but It's not likely we'll distribute anything higher than that until we move to 1.9.3. Which should be easier than the move to 1.9.2.\nUpdating the built-in Rubygems isn't really something that's going to be supported for a long time, if ever.\n. We'll eventually need to address the root cause, but I'm okay with this band-aid for now. :)\n. ... take it out and see what happens. ;)\n. Let's talk about it over there.\n. This breaks my build. I do want to get rid of this, but it's not useless.\n. So, yeah, I'd like to do this. The thing is, on the Mac at least, removing this code causes shoes to crash, with a reference to unknown class Encoding::UTF_7 or some such. I can get an exact error later.\n. 1.9.2-p180, iirc. I'm not by my computer at the moment.\nThis may also be a Mac/Linux issue.\n. Yes, basically.\nI'm not sure. Ill try to check into it tonight, but it might take me a day\nor two.\n. I plan on getting you a real error this evening.\n. Hey, I'm finally merging this. there's no reason it should be there. :)\nThanks! Sorry it took me ages!\n. I will double check on OSX tonight.\n. Works fine on snow leopard.\n@duckinator, I'm going to close this. If you can reproduce on Arch HEAD, please re-open.\n. Damn.\n. @duckinator, does this issue still exist?\n. No worries dude. take your time, I'm just curious.\n. Great! Thanks. hope you're feeling well.\nWell, it's not great that it still exists... heh.\n. Hey, thanks for filing this. Your English is more than fine.\nIt's not obvious to me what's causing this, but I will check it out at some point. I can't make a guarantee on timeline, but memory leaks are bad, so we'll want this fixed for sure.\n. > Ok I'll be following the project, as well as doing new tests, as recently met and really liked Shoes.\nAwesome! :) Please keep making tickets for any issues you find. Development is not super-fast at the moment, but we can't fix something if we don't know it's broke.\n\nConsidered it very significant,\n\nI agree. My Win7 box is down at the moment, though, so I won't be able to look into it for a bit.\n. Can you elaborate on 'can't get?' What did you try to do? The official way to get Shoes on Linux is to build your own, here: https://github.com/shoes/shoes/wiki/Building-Shoes-on-Linux\n. Yeah, I'm closing this, but not because I want to ignore you, it's just not really a bug. Please let us know if Cecil's suggestion fixes things.\nIf you'd like Shoes 2, you can find it here: http://shoesrb.com/downloads You'll face the same issue.\n. No worries! We are absolutely here to help. Please let me know if I can do anything else to help you at all. And you did get it running, yes?\n. > Only a few of us monitor the Shoes issues/bug reports.\nI wish that there was a better way to get notifications sent out to everyone.\n. Great!\n. I'll post to the ML about this now.\n. The problem is that serialport is written as a C extension, and so the only way to get it to work currently is to build your own custom Shoes.\nSorry about that! Crashing is also degenerate behavior. I'm going to leave the ticket open, because we should at least not do that, that's kind of excessive.\n. I personally am not super familliar. Maybe someone else will know? I don't do work with serial ports.\n. Wow, I have a short memory apparently.\n. A very initial version of this is up: here\n. I Just tried it. It opens Google in your browser.\n. Yes, exactly.\n. Basically, I mis-read the manual. I thought it said that google would never work.\nWhoops!\n. Hi Myra-\nI'm not sure off the top of my head, to be honest. I'm an Arch user, so this issue is really important to me, but due to a few deadlines, won't be able to look into it for a couple of days. :/\nMaybe @ccoupe has some thoughts?\n. Awesome, thanks.\nIf that header is 'blanked out' as he says, then maybe it won't be such a bad fix. I just have no time to look into it because of work. :/\nAt least, as of next week, Shoes is my job. :D\n. @ccoupe awesome, glad it turns out it can be removed there. Still leaving this open, as you said, gotta try on Mac and Windows first...\n. @ccoupe, that's only included in linux shoes anyway, so I'm applying the patch.\nSo sorry this took me so long.\n. I like it!\nI'll test it out before I merge it in, though. Might be a few days.\n. Merged! Thank you!\n. Yep! Thanks!\nThis is the same bug as this one: https://github.com/hacketyhack/hacketyhack/issues/109\nI don't have a copy of Lion yet. As soon as I figure out how I'm gonna handle having three OSXes on one box, I'll fix this.\n. We have some progress-ish on this, thanks to @wasnotrice. :)\n. I just merged the homebrew code into develop, so this should be fixed. I'm gonna shoot for a release soon, but until then, you can build a Shoes. :)\n. Thanks!\n. :D\n. Sweeeeet. Thanks!\n. This is awesome, but I'm getting a LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed for the\napplication /Users/steveklabnik/src/shoes/Shoes.app with error -10810.\nwhen I try to run the app.\n. https://gist.github.com/1157001\nis what I'm getting now. It's also taking FOREVER to start up... hm\n. I lied. I just re-did everything, and it's working for me. Works just fine. And 1.9.2!\n. Which gem are you trying to install?\n. Hm, okay.\n. You truncated too much! there's no error there.\n. So. Before you can build it, you need to make sure you have homebrew installed, and then:\nrake osx_deps\nrake\nAnd it should work. Your environment isn't finding cairo and stuff yet.\n. ... this changed in the last few hours, and so i'm just changing the wiki now. ;)\n. Can you rake osx_deps --trace for me?\n. How strange. So you do have stuff installed... I wonder if it's picking up the environment variable stuff. @wasnotrice, any ideas?\n. It says it's executing the boostrap env task too...\n. I'm slightly concerned by shoes/app.c:143: warning: implicit conversion shortens 64-bit value into a 32-bit value.\nAre you on a 32 bit system?\n. Ah! Right now, it's hardcoded for 64. So... yeah. We'll need to make a\npatch. If you're interested, grep the makefiles for x86_64, it should be\ni386 instead.\n. When we were talking about it on irc, we guessed that it's just getting linked against the system one somehow. You'd have to dig into the Rakefile stuff to figure it out. :/\nI still can't reproduce it myself, so I'm not too much help, but if you want to dig into it, I can help be a guide.\n. This issue was also affecting me, and now my Shoes builds properly again.\n. I've ported it to the develop branch, so all of this stuff should be on develop now.\n. Merging in your latest, since it still builds fine on Snow Leopard.\n. @secondplanet with a patch to fix the arch flags?\n. It's possible that those warnings have always been there. Seems like you have one less error than @indytechook though, and it seems like that's the big one...\nWe distribute some free fonts with Shoes, and pango should be looking for those. They're in the /fonts dir. I'm not sure about any of the details around fonts though, this isn't an area I'm a super expert in.\n. @indytechcook windows is the next project. :) we'd love some more windows 7\ntesting.\n. I wonder if there's a good way to make the rake task more resilient to this kind of thing.\n. This seems to be working for everyone now.\n. XCode 4.2 doesn't work for ruby in general. That's a very very upstream problem.\nYes. Check the downloads page.\n. Since you're in the other thread too, I'm gonna close this one. ;)\n. Lookin good!\n. Hm, this is very strange. Can you 'rm -rf dist' to delete the dist folder and try running again?\nIt's not compiling anything for some strange reason.\nOh, and I'd take a pull request to put Rake in the gemfile. ;)\n. Hm, this is very strange. @wasnotrice, @wilkie, @ccoupe, any ideas?\nOn Tuesday, August 23, 2011 at 4:30 PM, b1ackb0x wrote:\n\nDid that, but getting the same error.

Let me guess: do you have homebrew installed?\n. Hm. Okay. The issue is that your /usr/local is not a git repository. Mine is. I thought this is because of homebrew... @wasnotrice, any ideas?\nA temporary fix would be to do a 'git init' inside your /usr/local directory, but I'd really like to find the root cause.\n. It depends. If you'd like to get shoes going, just go ahead and do it, but if you'd like to help figure it out... I'm doing some googling. Either one is fine!\n. Awesome. This build process is a work in progress, so fixing some bugs would be sweeeeet. I don't have 10.7 myself, so it's hard for me to test.\nI'm asking in ##homebrew on irc, but nobody's answered yet.

Ah ha!\nCheck this thread: https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/issues/5128\n\nBut the installer script just untars the homebrew tarball into /usr/local, and as @digitalcardboard noted, when brew update is run for the first time, it runs git init, and then after pulling down from the github repo it tries to checkout the master branch which results in all the conflicts that you are seeing. \n\nSo, we've run 'brew update' before, i bet.

Well, this is baaaaad. @ccoupe, any thoughts?\n\nMy arch box is out of commission at the moment.\nIs there any trace? Or just that line?\n. Cecil, just so you know, shoes does build on Linux with 1.9.2. Or rather, it\ndid until something broke. We specifically worked hard to not mess with the\nLinux stuff, and have CI going on Linux, so it does test the actual BUILD\nwith every commit. Unfortunately, it also doesn't RUN shoes, so we don't\ncurrently catch these kinds of bugs.\nAnd while it's true that shoes/shoes hasn't been tested with Windows, the\nnew build process has, but we have one more little snag before we promote it\nto the official repo.\n. @tzar, you've done nothing wrong. I really appreciate this report. While I\nmight not be able to dig into this tonight, as of tomorrow ill be on IRC all\nday. We'll get it fixed, but this is what happens sometime when you build\nthe bleeding edge...\nOn Oct 5, 2011 7:07 AM, \"tzar\" \nreply@reply.github.com\nwrote:\n\n@ccoupe, my apologies if I've come across as arrogant or abrasive in any\nway - I was just trying to state that I do not wish to redo my development\nenvironment for shoes (which I use in my day-to-day work etc). I do not\ncurrently use shoes in any projects and only took over as maintainer to fix\nthe build script when I was tinkering with it many months ago so that others\ncould benefit. Shoes worked then on the stock ruby with no problems, and\nit'd be nice to fix the script so it works now with no problems, and\npreferably without needing a patched ruby (which is rather against the \"arch\nway\"). I am quite happy to give the role of package maintainer to anyone who\nactually uses shoes and uses arch linux who has more of a vested interest in\nthe project than I do. I reported this bug as I was requested to by\nsteveklabnik, not because I wanted it to be fixed for me because I live on\nthe bleeding edge (it makes little to no difference to me at this point in\ntime). It just happens tha\nt that is how arch (and I) have things set up. Anyway, sorry if I rubbed\nyou the wrong way, it was not my intent.. Hopefully I can tinker with it a\nbit tomorrow if it is indeed just a problem with the symlinks and get it\nworking. Thanks\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/shoes/shoes/issues/147#issuecomment-2296739\n. @ccoupe ah, that's a good idea! shoes --help it is.\n. ...except that won't close itself, right? That's the big issue. Though I guess it would start up and not block the shell, huh?\n. Cool.\n. I can reproduce this on my machine as well.\n. catsquotl on IRC has determined that 846071a introduced the bug.\n. @wasnotrice just pushed a commit, but it doesn't seem like it fixes it here.\n. This should be fixed by 1475d313a.\n. This was fixed with your patch right?\n. Cool. I think #147 should handle that, so I'll leave this closed.\n. Awesome, thanks cecil. You're right, it is a hack, but I'd rather allow a hack that gets people building than to wait a while for a perfect solution.\n. Hm. That's no good...\n. Yeah, it appears to be something with cd ... what shell are you using?\n. Crazy. Hrm.\n. Building with RBX isn't currently supported, but this is good to know!\n. Hrm. rake clean should take care of this kind of thing.\n\nWhat happens if you don't kill it?\n. Sure, it's not part of the build, but that's because it's not required.\nIf it really is, I'm not opposed to adding it.\n. How are you packaging? There are three ways.\n. Cool. The third way is totally undocumented, but it's how I compile Hackety Hack. You need a .app.yml file, and you can compile rake APP=.... instead of just rake.\nIf I remember correctly, the packager via the menu has been broken for a bit. I really do need to take a look into it, so this is a good bug report.\n. This is probably a 1.9.1 to 1.9.2 thing, with . being removed from $:. @wasnotrice, thoughts?\n. Shoes development is frozen while we work on Shoes 4: https://github.com/shoes/shoes4\n. Can you file a bug over there, please? I'm not sure if the Shoes 4 team is following these bugs as closely as I am ;)\nSounds like the yaml is getting generated wrong.\n. I just meant 'Psych::SyntaxError: ' is a YAML-related error.\n. So sorry this took a while. Can you check out the post I'm making to the ML right now?\n. It would help them get running with Shoes until we get a fix, though. ;)\n. > what does it need to do to install shoes?\nThe .run file runs shoes, it doesn't 'install' it anywhere. It extracts stuff out into a .tmp directory, and then executes things. You'd run the .run every time you want to run shoes.\n. > I thought I dissected .run files with a wiki article but maybe I didn't get around to it.\nI don't think you did. What you did write is totally awesome, though. :)\n. > Perhaps I'll add a more technical details just to complete the docs but that won't stop people from believing they can package a linux binary\nOne of my new years' goals is to go through and comment the crap out of Shoes. Any help there would be very, very welcome.\n\nThe proper way to distribute a shoes install in Ubuntu is a ppa (32/64, 10.+, 11+) or at least a .deb (both practically) and maintain them as shoes evolves.\n\nAgreed. We've got something going, @jrgifford was working on it.\n. This issue was confirmed as being Windows only, possibly windows 7 only.\n. Is this still going on?\n. No worries. I don't use Fedora anymore either.\nI'm going to close this, but if anyone has the same problem, I'll gladly re-open.\n. Okay, well, re-opened then. :(\n. What Ubuntu variation was it built with? @jrgifford ?\n. Also, you're totally right; I wonder why the 'zomg build from source' text is gone.\n. I'm marking this as 'fixed' for now, since we've fixed the instructions. If anyone wants to tackle 10.5 again, let's make a new issue based on the current state of things.\n. Can you give me an example of some of the gems, so I can reproduce?\n. Ah! Native extension gems don't work with Shoes. At least, they're not guaranteed to. It works on linux because you have build tools installed. If you had them installed on Windows, it'd work as well.\n. Yep! It's something I really wish we could fix. Oh well. :/ And someday, I'd like to work on getting better error messages for that...\n. Interesting. This is the first report of an encoding issue on the 1.9.1 based Shoes. Which the Policeman build is. Encoding stuff should only happen like that in 1.9.2... how strange.\nThis is from the one you downloaded from the site, or did you compile your own Shoes?\n\nBTW, it'd be really handy if you could copy/paste from the console window! :)\n\nYeah, that'd be good, I agree.\n. Ah, I misread your report. The Mac version is based on 1.9.2, so that makes a lot more sense.\nWhat's happening is that we're not getting all of the encodings loaded somehow. @wasnotrice and I were looking into it, but we still haven't figured out what's up. This is the root reason that the 1.9.1 to 1.9.2 move was so hard for us, so it sucks to see it cropping up...\n. This is due to Ruby having a 'library compatability version' of 1.9.1, even with 1.9.2. sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.1 on debian installs 1.9.2.\nIt's silly. Oh well.\n. Small note about your blog post, @surfnext : Policeman ships with Ruby 1.9.1, not 1.9.2. You might be building shoes from HEAD, which can have 1.9.2 or 1.9.3.\n. Cool!\nShoes Widgets are still very much a half a feature, and you're totally right, the reference to @types is the wrong thing. However, I hate class variables for a few reasons, so I'd totally accept this as a fix, but with a class instance variable instead. Can you give this a shot?\nclass << self; attr_accessor :types; end\nand then just self.types inside the method.\nIf you're not familliar, http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ClassInstanceVariable.html\nDo this in a pull request, and I'll totally merge it in.\n. Actually, reviewing further, it already is a class instance variable:\nrbx-head :007 > class A\nrbx-head :008?>   @types = []\nrbx-head :009?>   end\n => [] \nrbx-head :010 > A.new.instance_variables\n => [] \nrbx-head :011 > A.instance_variables\n => [\"@types\"] \nrbx-head :012 > A.class_variables\n => []\nSoooooo hrm. Okay. Work this up as a pull request with the @@types and we'll see what everyone thinks.\n. > . I don't know enough about the internals to comment further.\nYeah, honestly, I just hate class variables with enough of a passion that I knee-jerk against them, because they can really get you into trouble. They are occasionally sometimes useful, though, and this may be one of those cases.\n\nIs there a roadmap, or is it more ad-hoc than that?\n\nIt is currently more ad-hoc, but I would like it to become more regular. The biggest sticking point right now is windows. If I can solve the 1.9.2 issue, then we can get to stable releases, but right now, things are a little wonky, and it's impeding movement forward.\n. Yes. We have a spec directory for rspec tests, and so it'd be great to have a test there.\nI don't have time right this second to talk about how to turn it into a test, but play around with it and see if you can get something going. :)\n. No worries at all. I'm getting on a plane in a few hours, I'll cook something up. :D\n\nguess I'm just blind\n\nNo, it's that it's hard, and the features directory doesn't have a whole lot in it yet. We're just getting around to writing tests, but this one doesn't actually need to use the GUI...\nNever heard of testy, I'll check it out.\n. Yeah, that's what I'm concerned about. I plan on looking at it on the plane I'm boarding in 3 hours. :)\n. At the airport. yay free wifi.\nSo here's the deal, basically: This code was written by @why. Long ago. He's no longer with us. This feature was half written. Nobody has really touched this code or knows exactly how or why it works. Widgets were always a bit experimental.\nSo the combination of 1) code I'm not sure about 2) what other things it'll impact 3) a Ruby feature I dislike and 4) no way to ask the author means that I just want to be a biiiit cautious about it. Your code seems great, but I don't like to merge things I don't yet fully understand.\n. I'd love some feedback from people on this, due to my own irrational hatred of class variables.\n. Haven't forgotten about this. I'm going to merge it as soon as I write a test or two. Shooting for tomorrow morning.\nIf someone else conjured up a test, I'd be +1 on getting this in.\n. As for the testing stuff, I was going to show instead of tell, but basically, all the GUI stuff is in C, and right now, the resting stuff can only test the Ruby. This means that the shoes-mocks project basically defines empty classes: https://github.com/shoes/shoes-mocks specifically https://github.com/shoes/shoes-mocks/blob/master/lib/shoes/mocks/bootstrap.rb and https://github.com/shoes/shoes-mocks/blob/master/lib/shoes/mocks/mocked_classes.rb for example; so if you did describe Shoes::Widget do it should just instantiate a pure Ruby class.\n. I'm going to merge this in. We're not really well enough along with the test stuff to get on it, and I'd rather have the fix in and get it tested later than let this PR languish due to lack of tests.\n. Confirmed on OSX as well.\n. This is certainly strange behavior.\nCan anyone else confirm on other platforms?\n. Yep, and this shouldn't be too terrible to fix, either.\n. Hmm. On Windows? You should have a regular .exe. I thought. I was under the assumption that only Linux did such silliness...\n. Sweet, thanks! I'd apply this, but since it's a patch and not a pull request, it'll take me a few minutes, since I have to do more than click some buttons. ;)\nConsider it applied, though. If someone else wants to do so, feel free.\n. Absolutely, I don't know why @jrgifford's commit didn't do it. Whatever. :)\n. Awesome!\n. I would love to see it. Big issue is Windows, which we still don't have working on 1.9.2.\n. Because windows has a different build process that does not use your\n'current ruby,' so the .rvmrc is irrelevant.\n. ... I'm not opposed to moving it up to 1.9.3 for mac and linux though.\nWhich would be the .rvmrc. feel free to pull request. :)\nOn Dec 29, 2011 10:07 AM, \"Peter Vandenabeele\" \nreply@reply.github.com\nwrote:\n\nOK thanks.\nWhy is the .rvmrc then set to 1.9.2 (if it doesn't work on Windows with\n1.9.2) ?\nIf that .rvmrc would not affect Windows anyways (I don't know that, just\nan open\n\"if\" statement), then we could already set it to 1.9.3 for the rvm users.\nI can confirm flawless install and operation on Ubuntu 10.04 and 11.10\nwith a .rvmrc set to 1.9.3, also tested with a number of the shoes samples.\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/shoes/shoes/issues/173#issuecomment-3301361\n. How strange. The JSON gem should work just fine on p0...\nActually, I had expected a larger body of cucumber tests.\n\nRight now, the tests are total bullshit: _why never wrote any tests, he didn't believe in them. The 'tests' that exist are sorta bullshit, more of a basic sanity check than anything else. We're trying to come up with a good testing strategy, but testing legacy code is hard, testing GUIs is even harder...\n. Sounds good to me. Thanks! Welcome to Team Shoes!\n. If you run ack -r \"shoes_color_\" shoes/* you'll see all the methods relating to color.\nAround here are where most of the definitions are. Here you can see\nrb_include_module(cColor, rb_mComparable);\nrb_define_method(cColor, \"<=>\", CASTHOOK(shoes_color_spaceship), 1);\nshoes_color_spaceship is defined here\nSooooo yeah. Check that out. ;) The fix should be pretty easy.\n. Exactly!\n\nIn order not to break legacy code\n\nI'm not sure anyone has ever used Color#<=>. Heh.\nIf you don't get to it in a week or two, I'll take a crack at it. :)\n. Yeah, I have work to do with that, and getting Markdown into Shoes, and .... yeah. lots.\n. This was fixed by #176.\n. I've been working on a solution to the testing issue, but it's taking some time. I'll be posting to the ML in a few days...\n. http://librelist.com/browser//shoes/2012/1/4/moving-code-from-c-to-ruby/\n. This looks just fine to me for now. We can get things under test once the testing things shake out. This change is small enough that I have confidence in it for now. We'll want tests later for regressions, though.\n. @ccoupe 1.9.3 was supposed to be 100% backwards compatible with 1.9.2. So I figured we'd give it a shot. Windows is still a problem, of course.\nThis issue is probably enough for me to revert the 1.9.3, at least until it's resolved.\n. This doesn't really happen for me anymore.\n. Two finger scrolling on my trackpad does not work on OSX.\n. I have no idea where this would be defined. Check shoes/canvas.c: shoes_stack_new calls shoes_slot_new, and it has some scrolling stuff...\n. You cannot use C extensions with Shoes without building a special Shoes. @lljk, I thought you wrote up how to do this with gstreamer somewhere? Can you link to it here? Thanks.\n. Rock! Thank you. I looked right at it...\n. I'm not sure specifically, to be honest. This is very wild-wild-west territory. Maybe @lljk will drop by and give you a hand. :)\n. Thanks to both of you guys for continuing to work on this. This stuff is hard, but if we can get the process nailed down, it will help lots of people in the future.\n. > If I was king, I'd put serialport in Shoes.\nI could go for that. You're right, everyone asks for it... maybe I'll play around with this soon.\n. That's exactly why I hack on Red Shoes.\nI'll let you know when I start to work on this. You've done a bunch already!\nI'm going to re-open this as a ticket for adding serialport to Red Shoes.\n. :+1: @wasnotrice \n. I'm going to close this for now. We're changing too many other things, I'll tackle warnings later.\n. Thanks so much! Apparently we really need to trim off whitespace...\n. > Madness lives there.\nAgreed. Let's mark this as 'wontfix' for now, because if it does get solved, it sure isn't gonna be any time soon.\n. Wooo!\nI'm getting on a plane to Poland later today, but when I'm back, I'll try to reconcile these changes with OSX.\n. Ahhhh this is so awesome. Thank you!\n. Yeah, YAML has been undergoing lots of changes; yet another @_why relic that's on the way out.\nI'm not sure what the best way to handle this is. gonna think about it.\n. > (btw. any stats on how many are there)\nhttps://github.com/shoes/shoes/downloads\n. :+1:\n. I will look at this when I can, given my personal situation.\n. Looks good to me.\n. This is related to #161. #62, and everything here: https://github.com/shoes/shoes/issues/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=packaging\nBasically, the packager is all fsckd up right now.\n. The packager has an option to build a .shy file. Your user then opens the .shy with their own pair of Shoes, and it works.\nThe 'compiling' is via the APP parameter to the rake task. There is currently no documentation on this, it's mentioned in #153. I've made a note to document it in #194.\n. Yes, VLC and bloops are gone.\n. apt-get install shoes will install a REALLY OLD shoes. We cannot fix this.\nThis seems to be a duplicate of #157, so I'm going to close this. Subscribe to that issue to get updates about it.\n. Interesting, I bet this is an rbenv thing. None of us use it, we're all rvm people.\nThis is line 436. Weird.\n. > Well I'm not really married to rbenv I suppose.\nNaw, it'd be cool to support it; I'm just trying to figure out what's different with your env and mine.\n. Hm. Could this be because of the way that rbenv shims ruby?\n. Referring to this. Since we basically copy your Ruby over, the way rbenv manages Ruby might be causing problems.\n. Probably. Nobody on team shoes uses .rbenv.\n. +1 bug, yeah. Yay for @_why and weird edge cases!\n. Absolutely. :D\n. Weird. Okay.\nAt least by exposing these kinds of things, we can decide to clean them up later if they're not working. :)\n. Ah! Nice catch! Thank you so much!\n. Also, welcome to team shoes! Expect an email soon. ;)\n. Thanks for filing this!\nIs this via a download, or did you compile your Shoes?\n. Okay. If you have some time, mind building a Shoes and telling me if you got the same error? It's been cougha year and a half cough since the last release, so there's been a lot of work done.\n. Hmmm, yeah, there are some transient errors in the build process. What does Console.app have to say?\n. Nope. :/\n. Thanks! I'm not 100% sure where there'd be more logs, as my windows dev is really poor.\nWe're speculating that this has to do with ruby 1.9.1's terrible threads, and so we're hoping the move to 1.9.3 will fix it. Or using JRuby-based Brown Shoes...\n. Master builds with 1.9.3 on Mac and Linux. We're still trying to sort out Windows. We sorely lack expertise in this area, so if you know anything, let me know.... we're working hard, but it's a big job, and we're a small team...\n. Yeah, it seems to be about 30% of computers.\nI've installed Hackety on about 50 identical Windows 7 notebooks, and about a third of them experience the crash. They're totally identical.\n. What's you're gem -v?\n. Hmmm, strange. What about ruby -v?\n. Crazy! I assumed it was because Fedora tends to have really old stuff... but it seems you're up to date. I currently have no idea why this is happening.\n. I think this is a bug that we fixed on master. Anyone remember?\n. Yes, you need to build your own Shoes. There's no way of updating RubyGems for an already-built Shoes.\nI'm closing this since it's not a bug, but feel free to ask questions about actually building under windows here if the guide doesn't help you. :)\n. Dup of #212.\n. The directory where you compiled it has a 'dist' directory. There's a shoes executable in there, so ./dist/shoes.\nI'm going to close this since it isn't a bug, but if you still have problems, let's work them out!\n. I'm not sure what you're asking. You don't need to 'execute shoes.rb'.\nDo you mean use shoes within your existing Ruby?\n. You use shoes via ./dist/shoes. You don't use it from the command line. You also can't use shoes inside of your existing Ruby. Shoes is a custom Ruby.\nWhen you run ./dist/shoes, it pops up a box, asking you to choose an app, right?\n. > when I used the original shoes and it was possible to run shoes.rb with the interpreter and pass it a shoes example source file.\nI haven't known about this ever working.... As far ask I know, you have to './dist/shoes my_shoes_app.rb'. Is that what you want? Of course, most people put dist on their $PATH, so they can just 'shoes my_shoes_app.rb'\n. .. we haven't changed anything significant about how Shoes runs, so if you used to be able to do it, you can probably do it now. Know that when @_why was working on things, it went through a bunch of revisions, though. Where you using Raisins? (Shoes 2?) or Shoes 1?\n. Ahh, I have no idea. I don't use IDEs.\n@jrgifford, didn't you start using RubyMine?\n. A lot. Shoes is a Ruby interpreter, so running it inside another one doesn't make a lot of sense.\n. Nope, literally an interpreter: https://github.com/shoes/shoes/blob/develop/bin/main.skel\nNote https://github.com/shoes/shoes/blob/develop/bin/main.skel#L71\n. Yes, we're doing a total re-write. It will be run-able from your normal interpreter.\n. Yep, this is certainly a bug. Hm.\n. Uh oh! I haven't gotten 10.8 yet.\nDo you have cairo and glib installed?\n. If it doesn't build, we should leave it open.\n. This is a duplicate of #52.\nStill haven't figured out what is wrong. :/\n. Thank you! :D\n. Thank you so much! :D\n. What does the shoes console say? I beat your path is wrong.\n. I mean the shoes console, hit control-a or apple-a or command-a.\n. Alt-slash is it, sorry. I always remember keyboard shortcuts wrong; they\nget in my muscle memory. :(\n. I'm not sure, to be honest, I avoid load like the plague.\n. Try 'require', not load. You don't use the .rb with require.\n. Okay. well first of all, I need to read. Setting @a inside of your other file will NOT set it in this one, even if you load/require it. So your code would never work. Sorry.\nCan you share your code with me in general?\n. > \"your code will never work because you're doing it wrong\"\nYes, this is what I mean.\nI will check it out! Have a good evening. :)\n. I've submitted a pull request.\nRegardless, this isn't a bug in Shoes, so I'm closing the ticket.\n. > I did not get rake to succeed on arm platform\nI know @nategood knows something about this...\n. I had tried to do this a few times, there's even a branch somewhere. It's not super simple to replace.\n. I can't find the branch. Anyway, yeah, super :+1:, feel free to implement this.\n. Whoops! I forgot to change over the DNS. Should be fixed now.\n. Which Shoes are you running? This repository (red Shoes) cannot be installed via a gem.\n. Whoah, werid. I'm getting github emails from this thread, but the comments (except for @wasnotrice 's) don't appear. :(\n. You may want to check out Shoes 4: https://github.com/shoes/shoes4\nWe're re-doing Shoes, and this version isn't being actively worked on.\n. If you want to use gems with C extensions, you need to build a custom Shoes with the gem embedded in it. I'm embarrassed to report that there's no documentation on how to do this. :/\nshoes/shoes development is frozen as we work on Shoes 4, which is located at shoes/shoes4. You might want to give it a try.\n. Yes, Shoes uses RubyGems 1.3.5\nYou may want to try out Green Shoes or Shoes 4.\n. You can try, but it's quite complicated. There's a reason we're on that ancient version...\n. Nope. :( why didn't leave us with much.\n. No idea. :/\n. Yeah, URLs are an _amazing feature, but they've never been fully-baked.\n. Shoes embeds its own Ruby, so 'gem install httppartywon't get it in your Shoes. Depending on which JSON/XML libraryhttpparty` chooses, it has a C extension, so it won't work with Shoes unless you build a custom one.\nI suggest you try out Shoes 4 (shoes/shoes4) or Green Shoes (ashbb/green_shoes) instead, they're being worked on instead of shoes/shoes for exactly this reason.\n. Bummer.\nI'd suggest using Shoes 4 or Green Shoes in the meantime.\n. They're hard because of the way that _why originally decided to package them, a .run file. Also, 'so hell' with runtime dependencies.\nThe last known good binary was built and uploaded here: https://github.com/shoes/shoes/downloads\n. https://github.com/shoes/shoes/wiki/Building-Shoes-on-Linux#building-on-debian\n. :/\nThat's the dreaded error that made me stop working on Red Shoes.\n. Wooo!\n. It's not down for me.\nSee shoes/shoesrb.com for the source, you can see them there. They're also in this repo, I'm on my phone, but I think in docs or static.\n. Oh, and command or control m should bring up the manual inside of shoes.\n. Ah! Sorry, about that.\n. This is true, thank you.\n. I don't know what version of Shoes you'd get through the Ubuntu Software Center, it is probably very old.\nI suggest that you use Shoes 4 or Green Shoes instead. They will work much better.\n. We need a copy of the code.\n. It might be the 1.9 style hashes, can you try the older style? Just guessing here.\n. I recently compiled on Linux no problems, Debian.\nOn Mon, Jul 22, 2013 at 5:14 PM, Marcos Piccinini\nnotifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI taught it was hpricot too, but hpricot compiles fine on 2.0.0.\nWill try to compile on 1.9.3, but I'm 99% it will work, installed before lot of times.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/shoes/shoes/issues/246#issuecomment-21376200\n.

(Apologies in advance if I'm asking in the wrong place.)\nHave there been any Shoe-inspired projects for client-side JS/browser?\nBasically, a DSL implemented in JS that is an abstraction over HTML, JS, and CSS.\nThe Factor programming language, combined with some ideas of Alan Kay and HyperTalk led me down a path that seems to partially overlap with Shoes.\n     [\n        \"let's talk about a box\",  [\"#Sidebar\"],\n        \"create a box at top\", [\"#quotes\"],\n        \"create a list of stuff\", [\n           \"The computer world is like a great big toy store. \",\n           \"Microsoft Word is a computer game.\"\n        ],\n       \"pick a random item\",[],\n       \"use as the text of\",[\"#quotes\"],\n       \"let's talk about a box\",[\"#quotes\"],\n          \"padding\",  [\"30px 0\"],\n          \"font-size\", [\"x-large\"]\n      ]\n^^ It's a baby applet running in JSON shoes. ^^\nSo the idea would be that you like someone's quotations. You want to add some of them to your profile. So he gives you a JSON file, you \"run\" it in your page, Baby_Talk.run(json_text) and it adds a random quotation to a div#Sidebar.\nHowever, I have not come across anything like this, except for Shoes and HyperTalk.

Maybe installing cairo from this fork can help?\nhttps://github.com/codebutler/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/cairo.rb\nBrew install should work on the raw url.\n. No wait, that's a bit out of date; try this:\nhttps://github.com/secondplanet/homebrew/blob/patch-5/Library/Formula/cairo.rb\n. And here's pango...\nhttps://raw.github.com/codebutler/homebrew/master/Library/Formula/pango.rb\nTrying this out now; I hope this does it.\n. Sorry, needed to edit that a bit as well...\nhttps://raw.github.com/secondplanet/homebrew/patch-6/Library/Formula/pango.rb\n. Ok, so I installed quartz pango and cairo, but the error persists. I bet there is an environment variable or something. Does anyone else have a suggestion as to what to try next?\n. Cool, I'll try it with the forked Homebrew and see if this works.\n. Gets a little further along but still cannot compile. https://gist.github.com/1160752.   By the way, before I forget thank you steveklabnik, secondplanet and wasnotrice for looking at the issue. \n. Linking now, and trying the latest Shoes. Thanks, @wasnotrice for making some of those errors work out. However, I still get the same error on 32-bit Snow Leopard.\n. Just to clarify, it's the one @punjab was having recently.\n. @wasnotrice Thanks, that looks awesome. I'll report back ASAP.\n. https://gist.github.com/c515eded42cc1debd8d2 I still get this with the fork from @wasnotrice .\n. @wasnotrice So, am I getting the new formulae from Homebrew HEAD or your fork?\n.

I gather from reading the above comments that the \"Linux installer\" only works for 32 bit Ubuntu. That would probably be a good thing to state on the website so that people stop trying to make it work with other distros as I just did. It failed with x86_64 Manjaro.\nI'm off to ~~see The Wizard~~ build from source. \n. Well I'm not really married to rbenv I suppose.\n. There's a full trace here https://gist.github.com/2307339.\n. I don't think so. I'm on a MacBook Pro with OS X 10.7 and the other machine I've had trouble with is a MacPro with 10.6. I'll have to look on the MacPro tomorrow to see if Ruby is 32-bit for some weird reason. I\"ve already gotten rid of rbenv on the MacBook Pro and ruby -v outputs ruby 1.9.3p125 (2012-02-16 revision 34643) [x86_64-darwin11.3.0]. I havent tried building against that yet though.\n.   Now this is weird. The MacPro does NOT have the \"64-bit Kernel and\nExtensions\" flag set to true. HOWEVER, Shoes will build with an rvm\ninstalled Ruby. The fonts are screwed up, but it does build. \n. I'm afraid that's over my head. \n. Ah sure. I can see that now. \n. Should i open this issue in this repo https://github.com/shoes/shoesrb.com ??\n.

    "fela": "hm.. sorry, I'm don't understand how this is reasonable... I think that 99% of the time the user doesn't want that... nor is it what one would expect, that makes it a bug in my view.\nI didn't mean to say that the result of height was wrong just that it would be much more reasonable if by default making the window smaller again would make the container smaller, if possible. Or more precisely, that after the screen is resized the sizes of the containers are recalculated using just their attributes set by the user: the user said the height should be is \"100%\", so after a resize that should be used to calculate the new height, not the result of height (i.e. the height in pixels with the previous window size).\n. no because:\n1. @stack.style[:height] returns \"100%\"\n2. increasing the window height does change the height of the stack, contrarily to what happens when you set the height to the available height in pixels (@s = stack :height => height do ...)\n. hm... no, I'm okay with height meaning max scrollable height, and the code you are pasting does exactly what I expected, but the way I would have liked shoes to behave would not contradict your definition\nI suppose you might eventually find a justification of the current behavior, but, IMHO, the one I'm suggesting is much more reasonable. I can't think of any use case where the user wants the current behavior, while anytime the user wants some stacks that span the full height of the window they usually don't want that resizing the window and then setting the size back adds unneeded scroll bars..\nIt's okay if you say changing it would require changes to big to be done before 3.0, but I can't see how the change would not be an improvement upon the current behavior\n. a workaround I found is to set :height => -1, you lose one pixel though\n. Okay, thanks. That's a little different than what I would have expected, perhaps it should be put clearer in the manual. Also, the manual says, about clear(), that it is \"effectively identical to looping through the contents of the slot and calling each element's remove method\", this doesn't seem to be quite accurate.\n. actually to reproduce this it seems enough to do\n    Thread.new do\n      alert(\"Hello, world!\")\n    end\nand I just noticed that a program with just one alert statement never returns\n. The code doesn't make much sense on its own because I only posted the smallest example to reproduce the freeze. But if the code contains also other instructions it might make more sense. What I was trying to do in HH was to execute the user programs in a new Thread, but this way any program containing a dialog will not work\n. Here is a better stack trace gotten from running hh in the debugger.

I think this is actually caused by me using threads a little to easily. Perhaps it's not really a bug in Shoes, it is just that Shoes doesn't seem to be thread safe... I will try to get rid of threads in HH: I realized that I have used them in places where they weren't really needed\n. mmh.. in some places it is harder than I thought to do so :S\n. Do you think that this or issue 39 is going to be fixed in Police? Because it would be really useful for Hackety Hack, as quite some lessons useaskandsleep`, and I need some workaround that works transparently to the user. Unfortunately now I can't wrap the user program neither into a thread nor a timer. \nIf not let me know, and I'll try to find some other solution, but right now I can't think of anything..\n. I'm using sleep because it was in _why's original lessons. Maybe I have to rewrite the lessons, but I don't have much time for whyday.. \nWhat I want to accomplish is that the user program sleeps but Hackety Hack continues running, now I'm not able to do that. I would run the user program in a separate thread (without timer), were it not for #39.\n. Not really as I want to solved in a way transparent to the user. The counterintuitive fact about my originally posted code is that if you remove the timer method it works just fine.\n. I was wondering how modal dialogs did the trick of not blocking the whole application (just the user interaction part), and based on the implementation of the gtk dialogs I've came up with the following code idea that seems to work, at least in some cases\n```\n// callback\nstatic gboolean\nshutdown_wait_loop (gpointer loop)\n{\n  if (g_main_loop_is_running (loop))\n    g_main_loop_quit (loop);\n  gboolean call_again = FALSE;\n  return call_again;\n}\nstatic void\nwait(guint interval)\n{\n  GMainLoop *loop = g_main_loop_new (NULL, FALSE);\n  g_timeout_add(interval, shutdown_wait_loop, loop);\nGDK_THREADS_LEAVE ();\n  g_main_loop_run (loop);\n  GDK_THREADS_ENTER ();\ng_main_loop_unref (loop);\n}\n```\nPerhaps if the users closes the container of the widget running the wait code bad things could happen, but I thought to just share my findings\n. What I mean is: I would have expected the background to cover the whole slot, whose content is bigger than 300 pixels. The same way it increases in size when the slot with no scrollbar gets bigger because of paras getting added\n. ",

Yups, good catch. Thanks @tehgeekmeister \n. I guess so, people that are interested in dev can watch on github and can configure their emails here and most people on the current ML would be scared away by that I believe. Plus we got notifications in IRC now.\n. Yeah that'd be great :-) But I fear that this lies buried deep somewhere in the C-code, but as it's not performance critical why not use launchy for it as it seems to do the trick and it's one less thing for Shoes to worry about (delete more code!) :-)\n. xdg-open certainly seems to work for me. Thanks for looking into it!\n. Hi there, thanks for the report. This issue currently is open in #236 - but is unlikely to get fixed here as work as halted on the old shoes. URLs work in the new shoes4 but that's not quite ready yet.\n. I'd mark it as fixed if we made 3.2 the official version in this repo and push the changes here, which we should totally talk about :-)\n.

Hi there,\nyou can try this script to install - hasn't been tested on Fedora though.\nGem install won't work, it was an experiment. The original shoes never worked as a gem.

The .run sadly fails on almost anything :-/ Maybe it'd even be good if we take it off... I don't know.\n. Yes good idea, I opened a ticket over at shoesrb.com\n. No real idea, I'm sorry. Maybe building/compiling shoes yourself could resolve the issue (well it always worked for me) but no guarantees whatsoever :o \nTobi\n. You can read about building shoes in the wiki.\nAnd shoes4 is a complete rewrite also with different technology underneath (JRuby + SWT) - so it won't have this issue. Therefore most likely some other issues which we are eagerly working on fixing :-)\nTobi\n. Thanks for the quick hint Steve!\nI think I can fix this but we'll see - the problem is it just adds up all the values and checks whether their sum is equivalent.\nIn order not to break legacy code I will still add them up for determining whether one color is smaller or bigger than the other.

This looks easy enough even for my rudimentary c-skills to fix (a question of a couple of ifs) - I bet you got more important stuff to do (writing a book etc) :-)\n(And in the unlikely event of boredom you can still take a look at my hacketyhack pull requests :-D)\n.

The current develop should be rather up to date on the rubygems front. At least installing httmultiparty works on my machine. You'd have to compile it yourself though.\n. I'm sorry but you will have to follow this guide in order to \"build your own Shoes\". The policeman release is outdated, we didn't manage to make a new release for various technical reasons and we're really sorry about that... I have no experience building Shoes under Windows but I think that the guide is rather complete, otherwise I think that @ashbb might be able to help.\n. The problem is that Shoes is ruby interpreter of it's own and therefore has its own ruby gems. If you don't want to compile Shoes on your own then you could try using green shoes which is a gem of its own, however it also involves some compilation.\n. @jrgifford @steveklabnik Yep that's me but I'm still getting started with it. I'm using it for working on shoes4, when I write shoes apps I mostly use good old gedit and have a custome run command for shoes short-cutted, should be easy in RubyMine as well. Dunno how to just yet though :-)\n. Yep try building shoes from source, then it works. Otherwise you can try green shoes :-)\n. wehuuu thank you for your work @tehgeekmeister !\n. Hm that's weird maybe some kind of issues with relocated libs etc? Dunno I'm not familiar with OSX... however gcc 4.2 is kind of very old. I'm currently running gcc-4.7.\n. Hi,\nas far as I know you can download the installer and start it on your home pc with admin rights and then install it to a thumb drive. Then you could take that thumb drive with you and use it at work, although you'd have to use it from the command line specifying the full path since it won't be in the path and/or file associations of the other machine. \nHaven't tried it though. Any logic mistake in my plan? Any further ideas @ashbb ? \n. Glad I could help - I'll close this for now. If you got any troubles just come back here then we'll reopen it =)\n. Hm have you been following the debian instructions? What does your ruby -v say?\nI run Linux Mint Debian Edition (so basically the combination of your 2 systems ;-)) and it worked like a charm.\nCheers,\nTobi\n.

I personally am a Linux User but for me URLs also don't work, and I manage to build multi page apps. I've written myself a little library for this, but it is not yet in its own github repository or a gem. You can have a look at it and its usage here: https://github.com/PragTob/pomodoro_tracker - it's in the lib directory under shoes_slot_manager.\nComplete extraction planned in the next 2 weeks... ish.\n. Damn :-/ urls have been shaky in the old shoes, I could never us them because they used to segfault on my linux for even the simplest examples...\n. Yeah there is I've something that I could/should extract into a gem (took it from hackety and refinend it) but never did... basically you can take a slot and then hide it's contents. And then show another slot in the same place.\n. Hi,\nthe library like thingy that I wrote can be found here haven't tested it with many projects though really should get to work on making it a gem... :-/\nclass variables in Ruby are mostly not a good idea, you probably would rather use instance variables of the class object.\n. Just so you know, as work as halted on the old shoes this most likely will not get fixed. URLs work in the new shoes4 but that's not quite ready yet.\n. Linux binaries have been hard... I dont't think we got any. @jrgifford ?\nI use a Debian based Linux (Mint) and my build succeeds, no idea where that no rubygems error comes from.. have you tried following the build guides for both Ubuntu and debian step by step?\n. Oh well... I dunno why they are sooo hard, I'd say fragmentation but am not sure...  haven't worked on making that happen. Just know that what we offer as an install atm doesnt work and there are reasons why the fix isn't easy.\nI'd love to get my hands on one of those machines where the rubygems doesn't work... I think when it failed for me once I did a clean checkout or rake clean && rake\n. Right now I can't really guarantee for shoes3 to work anywhere, sadly. That's why the work on shoes3 is so important. It's worth a try.\nI just don't get the errors people are getting cause for me they are not there so I got now way to help people, worst kind of problems :-(\n. I got Linux Mint Debian Edition based upon Debian and Ubuntu is also based on Debian so its close. However I had a Linux Mint which was based upon Ubuntu 12.04 until last summer and building shoes worked there (had to use the Debian instructions though).\n. if this works out for @ozpos could you please link it in the wiki as help for the others @arnebrasseur ? And thanks for your work!!! :-D\n. :+1: for @arnebrasseur !!!!\n. I believe what he means is that the manual is down/not accessible.\nAnd that's the case for me as well, probably connected to the move to github pages. Will open an issue in the web repo as well. And invent a new urgent tag.\n. I already did: shoes/shoesrb.com#32 .\nThanks for reporting it, I will leave it open around here since this probably is the place people would check first (like you did ;-) ).\n. All fixed and should not be any problem anymore.\n. Hi there,\nthanks for reporting! This is a known issue over at shoes/shoesrb.com#27 and related to our move to github pages.\nSorry for the inconvenience :-(\n. Ah I fixed that. Sorry!\n. Hi there, yes packaging is sadly pretty much broken. There are ways to package from the command line... but I don't really know them.\nSorry :-(\n. Hi there, Shoes4 does not need the setup method as with Shoes4 you can just install gems from the command line like gem install gem_name. There is an issue open to implement it for compatibility reasons: shoes/shoes4#235 but it will not install the gem, just print a warning that you should not use that method anymore :-)\nedit: I might tackle that issue soonish\n. The old syntax is almost certain to return :-) Sorry shoes4 is not quite ready yet, we are in pre-alpha at the moment but working hard for an alpha release :-)\n. Ok great, then I'm closing this issue :-)\n. Well I just checked and the last version of jRuby in my repos (which should be updated soon) is 1.5.x. We'd wanna have 1.7. So umm yeah could take a while :-)\n. That's odd. Have you confirmed that your shoes installation on Linux works with a little easy sample application?\nOr did you package the app? Packaging might be broken.\n. hpricot is deprecated either way :-) I didn't try compiling it with ruby 2.0 yet... did you try to compile it with 1.9.3 and did it work? Just to make sure that it is a problem with 2.0 and not another problem :-)\n. We won't add support for 2.0. Currently we are working on shoes4 which is the upcoming version and a complete rewrite. It's in pre alpha but only < 10 issues remaining for the alpha mile stone. However as JRuby updates it will also support Ruby 2.0 features.\n. @nofxx shoes 3.2 has ruby 2 support in the meantime :)\n. There is something like that, and it's called black shoes so far it#s just a proof of concept though.\n. Definitely should, the most up to date version of the manual is kept there.\n. Thanks for this sample!\nBtw. there is new shoes development at the shoes4 repo this doesn't work with shoes4 yet though. I'll add it no matter what so that we can make it run :-)\nCheers,\nTobi\n. Hi there,\nI don't see an edit_line there in your code. Do you want to copy all the text that your put into all the different paras?\nCheers,\nTobi\n. I was asking because you were mentioning edit_line.\nIt seems like you want to assign the value of the clipboard to the return value of the data value. I take it you expect that to be the all the strings in there e.g.  \"SERVICE DESK ************* ********** \\ n (...) Completing the analysis: #{@co.text} \\ n (...)\" ?\nSorry that's not how it works, para just writes the string on the app and returns a para object, each of them an own para object. What you could do is create an array and put all the strings in there (one for each para) and then return that data. This could look like this:\n``` ruby\ndef data\n  my_data = []\n  my_data << \"SERVICE DESK *** ** \\ n\"\n  # ...\nmy_data << \"Contact #{@co.text} \\ n\"\n  my_data << \"****** \\ n\"\n  my_data.each do |string| para string end\n  my_data.join # makes it into a string again\nend\n```\nHope that helps.\n. Looks cool :+1: !\nI take it we can close this one here then :-)\n. Hi there,\nunfortunately this is not an easy fix. The .run is kind of broken - I just added a note to the homepage. For Linux you will have to go with trying to build your own shoes. That isn't hard though :-)\nCheers,\nTobi\n. Actually it's quite a few these days, I'm sorry :-( We are working on a new version to make it good again!\nSorry for the inconvenience!\n. Shoes implements methods to do animations, e.g. there is the animate method which calls a block 10 times per second (I believe) and therefore can be used to create animations. Here you can read more about animate\n. Hi there,\nthe downloadable .run file sadly does not work on current distributions. For now the only thing, that I can recommend you is compiling yourself.\nWe are working hard on shoes4 to replace the old shoes but it's not quite ready yet.\nNo experience using shoes with neo4j but it's just ruby and I saw at least one talk about neo4j and Ruby :-)\nCheers,\nTobi\n. Hmm strange, it seems like the 'swt' gem is not installed. Is it listed in gem list - it should be installed by bundler.\n. Okay that's weird behavior... :-(\n. I'll close this issue here as we got enough other open won't install issues and there is now a shoes4 running there :-)\n. Hi there,\nin which tutorial did you read this?\nWhen did you download your shoes version/e.g. which version is it?\nThis should work with the 1.9 distribution of shoes or recently compiled version with ruby 1.9+\nThe problem seems to be that it's executed with ruby 1.8 and therefore has to be:\nstack(:margin => 8) {\nCheers,\nTobi\n. Hi there thanks for your report.\n1. I believe it should be more like this:\nruby\nedit = edit_line\nedit.change do ... end\n1. No idea without the code :-)\n. Hi there @JosephShering - you should totally be able to do that.\nHaven't used an official shoes install for a while but if you compiled it for yourself (at linux) you'll find the appropriate binary at #{your_shoes_directory}/dist/shoes - that's what I always use. Feel free to include it in your $PATH.\n. Closing this since it's already there and no followup question. @JosephShering if you need help please comment again/reopen!\n. We can totally add a download link over at shoesrb.com. Feel free to open an issue/pull request over at https://github.com/shoes/shoesrb.com\n. Thanks for the report!\n. The installed ruby version should not have any effect.\nDid you also install shoes? When you type shoes -v on the console is there any output?\ncc: @ccoupe \n. One of the first things it links to is the walkthrough which includes installing, right next to it is downloads. is that not enough? You want a link in the tutorials section? :)\n. Yes that'd be extremely helpful, thank you!\nDunno if that file is duplicated here (as some are) please do it over at https://github.com/shoes/shoesrb.com/blob/gh-pages/walkthrough.md :)\n. I'm sorry you feel that way, we mostly think it's a fun little thing. I don't think there is an option to remove it, but yes we might want to provide a more neutral one.\n. Hi there,\nI think what you are looking for is our styling methods, You can find text related methods here - so you can use span with various options or something like strong. Some documentation is in the manual - you can find sample usage all across the samples.. ah didn't see that this was the shoes repo and not the shoes4 repo, so some links go to shoes4 but the samples work in both, the manual is actually for shoes3 abut the implementation I linked to isn't that relevant then :).

Here's another data point on OS X 10.7.1. This is Shoes using 528.8 MB of RAM with only the menu window open (after opening and closing several trivial apps)\n\n\n. There may be two separate issues:\n- Leopard\n- Your iMac might have a 32-bit processor (like mine). Check Apple > About This Mac > Processor.

Haven't gotten the 10.5 build working.\n\nAnd this is totally fine, of course. I just wanted to help clarify the situation, because some 2006 iMacs are 32-bit and some are 64-bit. Also, there is no reason that a 32-bit machine would have to be running 10.5 and not 10.6 (my 32-bit iMac runs 10.6). Support for 32-bit was only dropped in 10.7 ;(\n. As a temporary fix, you can replace libiconv.2.dylib (Shoes.app/Contents/MacOS/libiconv.2.dylib) with this patched libiconv.dylib from the GnuCash project. I don't know what the patch consists of, but it works. Cross-posted from https://github.com/hacketyhack/hacketyhack/issues/109 (same fix).\n. I wonder what's different between our systems. I installed my dependencies via Homebrew as an experiment. Looks like I have pango 1.28.4 and cairo 1.10.2\n. Hmm.

OK. Here's the problem (note: this is hard won knowledge :) ). Notice in the rake trace above:\n\ngcc -I. -c -oshoes/app.o -Wall -I/usr/include -I/usr/local/Cellar/pixman/0.22.0/include/pixman-1 -I/usr/X11/include/cairo -I/usr/X11/include -I/usr/X11/include/freetype2 -I/usr/X11/include/libpng15 -D_REENTRANT -I/usr/local/Cellar/pango/1.28.4/include/pango-1.0 -I/usr/local/Cellar/glib/2.28.8/include/glib-2.0 -I/usr/local/Cellar/glib/2.28.8/lib/glib-2.0/include -I/usr/local/Cellar/gettext/0.18.1.1/include -I/usr/local/Cellar/glib/2.28.8/include  -I/Users/punjab/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p290/lib/ruby/1.9.1/x86_64-darwin11.0.0 -I/Users/punjab/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p290/include/ruby-1.9.1 -I/Users/punjab/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p290/include/ruby-1.9.1/x86_64-darwin11.0.0 -O  -DRUBY_1_9 -DSHOES_QUARTZ -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -Wmissing-prototypes -Wmissing-declarations -Wredundant-decls -fpascal-strings  -O3 -ggdb -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-parentheses -Wpointer-arith -Wwrite-strings -Wno-missing-field-initializers -Wshorten-64-to-32 -Wno-long-long  -fno-common -pipe -x objective-c -fobjc-exceptions -isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk -arch x86_64 shoes/app.c\nThe first include path is -I/usr/include. That's wrong. There's no cairo anything there. Also note that there are some cairo include paths, but they are for the X11 version (the OS X stock version), and there's no cairo-quartz.h there. This happens because the use-brew script was removed and that env manipulation was put into a rake task, which is great, except that there is a bunch of environmental stuff set in make/darwin/env.rb, which is processed before any rake tasks. So the SHOES_DEPS_PATH and CAIRO_CFLAGS constants are set to default (wrong) values before the rake task, and the rake task sets the env vars, not the constants, and by then it's too late. Note that if you cleared out your Homebrew install, and had no pkg-config, the whole rake task would bomb.\nI think I have fixed the issue in this commit: https://github.com/wasnotrice/shoes/commit/d063dfb0dc0340a17f09237c1236f5b23d60234a. I don't think you will be able to build a wearable Shoes yet, but you should get past the cairo-quartz.h business :) Please try it out.\n. secondplanet: In principle, it would be nice to stay with the standard Homebrew packages as much as possible (simpler!). If we brew link cairo, then pango can find Homebrew's cairo without modifying the pango formula. That said, it's possible that we need the additional compile flags on your cairo formula fork. My build is hung up on libiconv at the moment, so I can't tell yet ;) \n. punjab: I have recreated your error:\ngcc-4.2 -o dist/libshoes.dylib shoes/app.o shoes/canvas.o shoes/effects.o shoes/image.o shoes/internal.o shoes/ruby.o shoes/world.o shoes/native/cocoa.o shoes/http/nsurl.o -framework Cocoa -framework Carbon -dynamiclib -Wl,-single_module -L.  -install_name @executable_path/libshoes.dylib -arch x86_64 -lruby.1.9.1 -lcairo -lpangocairo-1.0 -lgif -lpixman-1 -ljpeg.8 -L/Users/eric/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p290/lib -L/usr/X11/lib -lcairo -L/usr/local/Cellar/pango/1.28.4/lib -L/usr/local/Cellar/glib/2.28.8/lib -L/usr/local/Cellar/gettext/0.18.1.1/lib -lpango-1.0 -lgobject-2.0 -lgmodule-2.0 -lgthread-2.0 -lglib-2.0 -lintl\nUndefined symbols for architecture x86_64:\n  \"_cairo_quartz_surface_create_for_cg_context\", referenced from:\n      _shoes_cairo_create in cocoa.o\nld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64\nLet's see if we can solve it!\n. punjab: try\nbrew link cairo\nThat should get you a little further.\n.

Hmm. It's trying to use homebrew's libiconv. I'm assuming you uninstalled it, which means that glib must have reinstalled it. Which means you didn't get the updated formula. Try pulling from my repo again. I made one more commit since my last post which might have fixes the problem: https://github.com/wasnotrice/shoes/commit/2be3a77cf7077ac32c037a16477cc380ef533337\n.

Maybe cleaning out all of the dependencies will make a difference for you?\nThat said, I do also see two errors in Console: https://gist.github.com/1169921. However, I don't have the \"failed to choose a font\" error that you have. I guess that's the culprit. @steveklabnik Any insight here?\n. @indytechcook great! I'm glad the build works for you. Thanks for\nsticking with it\n. @indytechcook what did you do that got rid of the \"failed to choose a font\" error (and the boxes)? I am trying the build on a 32-bit machine and got that error. Was is just uninstalling/reinstalling dependencies, or did you find something else?\n. @secondplanet I have an updated 32bit branch (new branch): https://github.com/wasnotrice/shoes/tree/32bit\nTo build:\nbrew uninstall cairo gettext giflib glib jpeg pango pixman pkg-config portaudio\nrake osx:deps:install\nexport i386=true\nrake clean && rake\nIt almost works for me. Build succeeds, but I get boxes instead of text, like @indytechcook here. Give it a try and see how it works for you.\n. @secondplanet looks like not all of the cairo links are present. cairo.h should be at /usr/local/include/cairo/cairo.h and symlinked to the file in the Cellar. Do you have that file? If not, you should get it with\nbrew unlink cairo\nbrew link cairo\nBut now, did you brew uninstall all of the deps? It for sure won't work unless you uninstall and reinstall, because some of the formulas have changed.\n. @secondplanet I've been working on the build process, so things have changed since this issue was opened. The wiki is up to date though. I would recommend that you brew uninstall all of the shoes dependencies, then re-install like this:\nrake osx:deps:install\nThis task will add a new shoes remote to your homebrew install. It's my shoes branch at https://github.com/wasnotrice/homebrew/tree/shoes . It will merge in new formulas for glib and pango, which are basically the smallest changes from homebrew standard that enabled the build to succeed. I'm still investigating the reported problems to see if I can find the root. At least one that seemed to be with homebrew/cairo was actually a problem with macports...Let's see if we can get you up and running!\n.

We'll get rid of that step down the line.\nPlease try it out and report back!\n. @phinze yeah, I'm surprised to see that popping up again. Let's investigate your libiconv.2.dylib file. You could post results of otool -L libiconv.2.dylib here for a start, or hop on IRC. We're in #shoes on freenode.\n. @phinze great! Thanks for posting your solution. It'll probably help someone else down the road. At the moment, those font warnings are expected ;)\n. The current approach is more of an experiment than a solution\u2014merging from a new branch is problematic in lots of ways. It would be ideal to get the changes we need committed to homebrew upstream. However, I think we might always require some custom formulas, especially if we start building fat binaries.\nCurrently, we have two custom formulas, glib and pango. There is already a pull request opened for the version of glib we are using. The pango formula only differs in one switch, and I'm honestly not certain we have it totally correct. There is a pull reqeust for pango that looks promising for us, though I haven't tried it yet.\nWe should definitely look into installing via URL as a fallback, though. We could even include the formulas in the shoes project and install locally from a file, if that's possible. There's also this promise on the homebrew wiki:\n\nSoon we\u2019ll add tools to make it easier to get at formulae in other repositories.\n. The version of pango (and cairo) included in the pull request I mentioned above do work for shoes on my machine, so maybe it makes the most sense for us to work with upstream to get those versions pulled in. As an added bonus, the pango/cairo updates include support for universal binaries (untested).\n. I ran into this as well. Here's a pull request that should fix it.\n\nhttps://github.com/shoes/shoes/pull/130\n. b1ackb0x: Glad to hear! Thanks for the report, and have fun with Shoes!\n. This issue turned out to be a conflict between homebrew and macports (see line 177 of http://pastie.org/2440053). Should be closed\n. It's a start. I think -Wall is already on\u2014but maybe when we get the\nwarnings down into single digits, we should start being -pedantic ;)\n. Oops. This is a bug in the Rakefile. That constant is not being set. Should be fixed by commit in pull request #137\n. The easiest way to build all of the shoes dependencies is\nrake osx:deps:install\nThis build everything you need, assuming you have homebrew and rvm installed.\n. Also, since your homebrew install is fresh, if you haven't run \nbrew update\nyour osx:deps:install task will fail with a git error. Just run brew update and retry.\n. Hmm. The default Cairo builds on my machine, but I see in the formula that it does fail on some CPUs. Mine is 2011 MacBook pro i5. Yours?\n. Glad it built! Which Cairo formula worked for you? I'd like to see if we can find a formula that works for everyone\n. @jeremywho based on your trace, it seems like the issue is still with cairo. The first error is this:\n./shoes/app.h:13:19: error: cairo.h: No such file or directory\nUsually, if you have gotten cairo installed, you can get that cairo.h file to be there with a brew link cairo, which rake osx:deps:install should run for you. So I'm not sure whether cairo got installed correctly or not.\nLet's see if we can track down the root issue here and get you up and running :)\n. No problem. We'll be on the lookout for issues with the next version of Xcode :)\n. Awesome! This builds for me, too. It feels much better.\nI have a couple of suggestions:\n- let's figure out how to remove make/darwin/tasks.rb before pulling this in, since there's duplicated code there\n- I would reword the task names something like this. Maybe some of the tasks in the build namespace actually depend on one another. Not sure about that.\n``` ruby\n  desc \"Build for OS X\"\n  task :build => [\"build:skel\", \"dist/#{NAME}\", \"dist/VERSION.txt\", \"build:common\", \"build:copy_deps\", \"build:copy_files\", \"build:setup_system_resources\"]\nnamespace :build do\ntask :skel do\nend\n\ntask :common do\nend\n\n# and so on\n\nend\n``\n- theosx:common_buildtask probably belongs atcommon:build` or something like that\n. Even more succinct:\nruby\nShoes.app\nfails with the same error, while\nruby\nShoes.app do; end\nexecutes as expected.\n. Another data point.\nruby\nShoes.app\nruns fine using Policeman download version on OS X 10.6\n. Fixed by cdbf79d7bd7231b49b35ccd883372154a27377af\n. Premature closure. On linux, this kind of code produces a segfault, see http://librelist.com/browser//shoes/2011/9/15/segfault-with-shoes-build-on-the-nobody-knows-shoes-url-example/\n. Thanks!\n. I don't think rake clean is part of the build, though. It's for sure not on OS X, although that directory is purged in the OS X build. We should make task *:build => :clean where * is the OS namespace\n. Closing this issue. Use rake clean when you want to delete dist. If you want to clean and build all at once, just do rake clean && rake\n. Thanks for the report. The reqs are not being copied into the correct place in the app on universal builds. Working on a fix.\n. This binject issue is fixed by ef1b32128da6019d7687a30a38d6e70b5bc75e62. I think this fix will play nice with linux and windows builds, but it is untested on those platforms. Do note, however, that the GUI packager is actually still broken, and you are better off packaging like @steveklabnik suggested\n. Sounds like there's a path issue, so that the shoes script isn't found. I don't know the anatomy of a .run, but I'd start by figuring out where the built Shoes is looking for the shoes script, and where the script actually is (or if it's completely missing).\n. First of all, it would be great if you can build Shoes for 10.5! You should know, however, that it hasn't yet been done, so you will be the first.\nLooks like you are trying to build Shoes using MacPorts. Homebrew is preferred, so it might be easier to use Homebrew if you can. As you have noticed from the instruction, the MacPorts build process is currently filled with modifications and workarounds, and you have discovered that at least one of them is out of date.\nThat said, we should fix the instructions that are outdated. I'll offer some ideas, and please update the wiki when you figure out what works :)\nI think what you want to do is set modules_file to the path of pango.modules in your MacPorts tree. It's on line 330 of the Rakefile\nGive that a shot and see if it works!\n. I'd recommend sticking with homebrew if you can. Looks like they've already fixed your issue!\nhttps://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/issues/8510\n. Right, so the SDK is hard-coded at the moment to 10.6, and I think it's in more than one place in the code :( Haven't gotten around to refactoring that yet...You probably have to change that. You would change instances in Rakefile and make/darwin/env.rb (ignore make/darwin/tasks.rb). Maybe the -arch flag is not available with your version of gcc? My version (that works) is 4.2.1. Here's the output of gcc -v on my machine.\n. Did you get any message about why pango wasnt installed?\n. Two things:\n1. Please file a separate issue about the binary that displays boxes (along with a link to the problematic version, and messages from Console). We have run into that issue in the past, and that needs to be fixed :). Sounds like this is the root of your problem: you just want to download Shoes.app and see if it works for your project. \n2. I'd love to get the Rakefile to the point you're envisioning, where you can specify either homebrew or macports as the source of your dependencies. The problem is that, as you note, one can't use both on the same machine, and we have a shortage of developers using macports. Would you be interested in working with me as a macports tester to see if we can provide an easy route for both environments? \n. Sounds good. I think getting you a working binary will be faster than sorting out macports :) \n. Thanks :) When you launch Shoes.app, do you get any messages in Console.app?\n. Did you, by chance, just launch Shoes straight from the .dmg? If you do that, you'll get the boxes:)\nIf so, copy Shoes.app to another location on your disk (like /Applications or ~/Desktop), and give it a shot from there.\n. @atownley yeah, it is 1.9.2 even though it says 1.9.1. There are lots of places in ruby 1.9.2 that refer to ruby 1.9.1 (lib/libruby.1.9.1.dylib for instance). We're picking up the wrong config var there in the versioning. I found the right one now, though. Thanks!\n. So this doesn't address the encoding issue, but the ruby version is fixed by b30ed20f06e6dbaa4c961d28611c54dfd95f6a7c\nNow:\nsu:MacOS eric$ ./shoes -v\nshoes policeman (0.r1741) [universal-darwin11.2.0 Ruby1.9.2]\n. This is strange to me. The point of using a class instance variable, it seems, is that the subtypes do not inherit the value (i.e. the registry is only in the inherited class). That sounds like \"the right thing\".\nAnd it should work:\n[1] pry(main)> class A\n[1] pry(main)*   @types = {}\n[1] pry(main)*   def self.inherited subc\n[1] pry(main)*     @types[subc.name.downcase] = subc\n[1] pry(main)*   end  \n[1] pry(main)* end  \n=> nil\n[2] pry(main)> class B < A; end\n=> nil\n[3] pry(main)> B.new\n=> #<B:0x007fd9691ef2b8>\n[4] pry(main)> A.instance_variable_get :@types\n=> {\"b\"=>B}\n[5] pry(main)> B.instance_variable_get :@types\n=> nil\nNow, if we use a class variable:\n[1] pry(main)> class A\n[1] pry(main)*   @@types = {}  \n[1] pry(main)*   def self.inherited subc  \n[1] pry(main)*     @@types[subc.name.downcase] = subc    \n[1] pry(main)*   end  \n[1] pry(main)* end  \n=> nil\n[2] pry(main)> class B < A; end\n=> nil\n[3] pry(main)> B.new\n=> #<B:0x007fcd88a8c750>\n[4] pry(main)> A.class_variable_get :@@types\n=> {\"b\"=>B}\n[5] pry(main)> B.class_variable_get :@@types\n=> {\"b\"=>B}\nSo I guess I'm not sure why it's not working as expected, but is using a class variable just masking the problem?\n. @atownley thanks for illustrating why my example doesn't apply (and explaining why the class instance variable doesn't work). Your solutions seems right to me.\nThis issue really illustrates the problem with having no tests. We can't know whether this change breaks anything. @steveklabnik maybe the test case in the original issue here is a good model for getting some of these features under test.\n. Reviewing this issue, and related to #188, I would propose that we move toward including only gems, and make that process easier. We can just package up binject and ftsearch as gems (it's not hard), and treat all of these libraries the same. This would remove some complexity from the build. It would be nice if all you had to do was drop your gem into req/ and it would get built into your Shoes\n. Looks like that's something I broke last night. Thanks for the report. I'll check it out\n. Great!\n. I'm going to give this merge a shot :)\n. @ashbb thanks for testing this out. You found the desired behavior. I chose a silly example :).\nI wonder if your ruby 1.9.3 was compiled with the Syck yaml library that used to be the standard. Mine compiled with Psych:\nhuckle:shoes eric$ irb\n1.9.3p125 :001 > require 'yaml'\n => true \n1.9.3p125 :002 > YAML\n => Psych\n. And just for reference,\nhuckle:shoes eric$ rvm use 1.9.2-p290\nUsing /Users/eric/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p290\nhuckle:shoes eric$ irb\n1.9.2p290 :001 > require 'yaml'\n => true \n1.9.2p290 :002 > YAML\n => Syck\n. @ashbb so maybe we need to decide whether we should include the standard ruby 1.9.3 (Psych) or a modified one (Syck). I do think this issue is a pretty easy fix, and there isn't that much yaml in Shoes. Also, note that my Shoes built with Psych does create and extract .shys fine, so it's just an issue with Psych extracting .shys that were created by Syck.\nEdit: by 'include', I mean include in a 3.1 Shoes release\n. @mpapis great points. We would have to add libyaml to our list of dependencies.\nI did a quick test of a .shy I produced with my 1.9.3 Shoes (Psych), and it produced errors on my 1.9.2 Shoes (Syck). So this is definitely a concern. No data is lost, but the old code will not parse it correctly, which means that apps packaged with a standard 1.9.3 ruby Shoes will not be openable by older Shoeses.\nI think this is not the release to break backwards compatibility. Might be an argument for sticking with 1.9.2 for this release, and moving to 1.9.3 in a later 4.0 release.\n. After playing with this a little bit, I think the solution might be as simple as just adding a require 'syck' before require 'yaml'. See how it works in irb: https://gist.github.com/2023662\nI'd vote for sticking with 1.9.3 and using Syck as above for this release (noting with sadness that, since it is not maintained, we have to transition away at some point). Thoughts?\n. Shoes seemed to run ok even when I wasn't getting the gemspecs into the .app, so I'm not sure how necessary they are. I'm putting them in because they were there before.\n. So once we build the gems, we don't need the gemspecs anymore. Makes sense. I'll drop them from the built product\n. Do you have any more detail on that top line in the stack? Maybe a rake --trace?\n. Much better! So the relevant part is from line 1948 to 1974. Essentially this is saying that you are compiling shoes for 64-bit, but you are linking against a ruby that was compiled for 32-bit. I have gotten these errors in two scenarios:\n1. You are working on a 32-bit machine\n2. You are working on a 64-bit machine, but you have compiled ruby for 32-bit\nMight either of those situations describe yours?\n. @ashbb I agree, this is a bug in red shoes. Green and Purple are correct. To not break current apps, it might be better to leave this behavior as is in Red for now, and fix it in a future release. But the manual is confusing. \n. I'm telling you, specifying the interface for brown shoes is going to uncover a lot :)\n. Wait a minute! Now, I was looking at the wrong method. So the manual actually does say that strokewidth on the app returns self. However (and this is what I was looking at), strokewidth on an element returns the number, which is consistent with the rest of the element methods.\nSo...there is not a bug, exactly. And there's no need to return the value--you have it already since you just passed it in. Why is it different, I wonder?\nI mean, there is a system to the built-in methods. There are just exceptions:\n1. If the method creates an object, return the object (arc, arrow, line, oval, rect, shape, star)\n2. If the method doesn't create an object, return self (cap, nofill, nostroke, rotate, strokewidth, transform, translate)\n3. Unless the method is fill or stroke, in which case, return the fill or stroke\n. Looks like you have the new XCode installed, where the library paths have changed (moved from /Developer to /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer). We have not updated the build for the new XCode yet. Patches welcome ;)\n. ok, you have spurred me to pursue setting up a Lion VM on my machine. this should allow me to figure out how to build using new XCode, while also maintaining an older XCode :)\n. Shoes 4 doesn't parse HTML yet, but when it does, it'll use nokogiri.\n. https://github.com/shoes/shoes4\n. On Dec 3, 2012, at 2:12 PM, Eugene notifications@github.com wrote:\n\ngem 'shoes'\n\nAs Steve said, Shoes can't be installed as a gem. When you try, it seems like the gem installed correctly, but there is no gem, really. It doesn't even set up the Shoes constant.\nThis is definitely confusing. To run the current version of Shoes (Shoes 3), you should download it from Github: \nhttps://github.com/shoes/shoes/downloads\nThat is the short answer.\nA longer answer includes this tidbit: we are working on a new version, Shoes 4:\nhttps://github.com/shoes/shoes4\nShoes 4 can be installed as a gem, but\n1. it requires JRuby\n2. Shoes 4 is not feature-complete with respect to Shoes 3, so it hasn't been officially released as a gem\n3.

I can confirm that Linux behaves differently than Windows on this problem. One of them has a bug.\n. I ran across this error in the packager. It doesn't make much sense to put up a model dialog in  a new thread, when I think about.  Should the thread suspend until the Alert is removed? Should all threads? \n. In linux/osx, fork()/system()/spawn()/etc  might work for your script loader There is a lot of global state in a shoes process that you may or may not want to pass to a loading script. Just thinking out loud.\n. Your choice. The problem is hidden by the new GUI but it's still a bug that needs documented somewhere.\n. The OSX tuneup would be welcome for this part of shoes. No hurry from me. I've done about all I can in the packager.\n. Shoes is not a GUI wrapper for any script of your choice. That example does not invoke the Shoes.app class. \nYou must have build Shoes yourself the hard way (from source), so which version of ruby and which version of shoes did you build? \nThere are thread race conditions in Linux/Shoes/1.9.x but the above example probably should fail for all versions. \n. The inability to build native gems is well known. It was discussed on the Mailing list a few weeks back. I wrote a Developers Guide (see the wiki) to explain what Shoes is, the gem issue is discussed there.\n. Thank you for filing a bug report, DRMacIver ! We appreciate your feedback. We failed your expectations and we are sorry that we couldn't serve you properly. We wish you the best in finding the software and support you deserve.\n. IMHO, it's low priority for Red Shoes.  is Shoes --ruby documented anywhere? That should be fixed before someone, once again believes Shoes is the Ruby they know.\n. Displays correctly on Linux, shoes version 0.1741\n. Yes.  It depends on where that ./shoes3.run came from. If it came from the packager in Shoes, then the .run extracts the script into /tmp and puts the Shoes executable into ~/.shoes/shoes.run which different from the packaged script .run\nAll .runs respond to --help on the command line.\n~/.shoes/shoes.run --help suggests that the relative path needs ' -- ' ahead of the ./test.rb or test.rb \n. Your best workaround is to build shoes from Source - it's not that hard and if there are problems we can fix them on the mail list or on the irc. Really it's better and you'll be happier.  \nThe run file is more like a tar ball, that has to be expanded every time to run a script. It's purpose is to run the shoes script packed inside the .run. it's not really designed to be a general purpose Shoes launcher.  \nIn Windows and OSX we can provide \"Apps\". Not so easy for Linux.  Ideally we would provide a .deb and a .rpm to install Shoes but we aren't there  yet. \n. Confirmed on Shoes 3.2 - it's animation on the splash screen that uses the memory.\n. just use 'rake'. The current version of Shoes does not support Video and there is a rakefile bug with VIDEO=0.\n. Shoes as currently written, requires Ruby 1.9.1\nAbrz, if you really want to go back to 1.8.7, there are other lines of code in binject.c and perhaps elsewhere that do not have #ifdef.  You'll have much debugging ahead.\n. Yes, Ruby is really picky about encoding.  Set your streams to ASCII-8BIT will help. Odds are that Ruby is throwing an exception to Shoes (printed on the shoes console). You'll also need a font assigned to the edit_box that has representation of all the incorrect characters.  Even then I suspect you are in for frustration try to get this work.\n. I'm going to close this issue. It was Linux specific and I've lost the test case. It was also low priority. \n. Steve, the source code suggests that on OSX that ask_save_folder and ask_open_folder calls the same native code widget.  I'm using Ubuntu 10.10.\nashbb, shoes policeman (0.r1525) [x86_64-linux Ruby1.9.1]\nAll, --  it's a minor problem. It may even be a Ubuntu theme issue. Ick, if that is the case since I don't run the default theme. I'd rate this bug report priority something lower than minor. \nNo big deal for my app  (see my blog http://werehosed.mvmanila.com/2011/03/19/check-your-isp/ for the link to the real app). Linux save_folder dialogs might well be thematic.\n. FWIW,  the example works fine in Linux. \n. I can confirm on Ubuntu 11.04 that you can make the window smaller.\n. FWIW, this is not happening with Shoes 3.2 on Win 7. \n. Ah, there is no Shoes icon or menu item installed on Ubuntu. Shoes is not installed in the System. \nFrom the terminal, cd down into the directory where you build shoes. For me, it's ~/ccoupe/Projects/shoes\nFrom there, just './dist/shoes' to run it. \nWith patience, one can create an icon and menu item in Gnome (not sure about Unity) to point to your Shoes.\n. I saw those errors long ago on Ubuntu. I suspect it is linking against the systems ruby instead of the ruby in the shoes directory. Which may happen if the rake file fails to copy the correct files from the system. That's hard to debug without having your exact setup or the complete log because rake did something wrong early on.\n. 'rake clean'  then 'rake'.  Otherwise it's just repeating  failed compile and link using the previous bad object files.  The volume of warnings from canvas.c bothers me - I don't don't remember that many or those errors from canvas.c  Even without a rake clean first, that is one oddball compile log, my friend. \nunless you have rvm installed, I'd leave things where yum puts them. If you're doing something with ENV vars that can cause problems. \n$ cd ~/Software/Shoes\n$ which ruby\n$ ruby -v\n$ rake clean\n$ rake\nHopefully your terminal buffer is large enough to capture it all.\n.

I managed to create an RSS feed for all the github projects I'm part of. I set the poll rate to every 4 hours but github is often way behind that level  and along with some serious duplication issues if an project admin starts moving things around... That said, it does allow one to monitor any bugs/issues reported even if they are a half a day or a day delayed. \nSourceforge has an easier system (email push if you request it by issue or for everything in the project). It's also a big pain in the ass to get registered and there are some serious errors in whats presented in email and what's in the web view.\nThe Shoes community isn't that large.  Can you CC a Shoes github bug/issues to the Mail List. It's not like the ML is a hive of activity. Or create a shoes-dev mailing list to gateway the gitbub events to. Email ML are so much better than a fancy  Web 2.0 forum for a small community. IMHO.\n. Can we close this ticket?\n. Interesting, on my Ubuntu 10.10 system:\nccoupe@twb:~$ more /usr/include/curl/types.h \n/* not used */\nSo the file is there, just empty.\n. Since the file contains nothing except comments we probably shouldn't include it as you did with your config.h\n. Oh, a problem I can help with!\nWhat your log shows is that you did not comment out line 46 of config.h according to the C (not C++) rules of your gcc.  Use /* #include .... */  to comment out a C preprocessor directive. In C, a line starting with # is not a comment, it is a macro  #ifdef  #define... \nYou may still find build errors (or not) and the vanishing curl types.h is still something to needs to be fixed  in Shoes  config.h (or however config.h is created) so the bug report can't be closed. \n. Being a pedantic a**hole I made my shoes/config.h look like this near line 46\ninclude \n/* #include  */\ninclude \nI did a 'rake clean' and 'rake'. Shoes built fine (with the normal warning errors we learn to expect). './dist shoes -m' brings up the manual  so it's correct. Whether  MingW or OSX will fail to build w/o curl/types.h is not something I can test.\n. Actually, you don't have to wait. That part of the code is GTK (linux) only. The line can be deleted from config.h\nAnd the issue closed.\n. Bug fixed in Shoes 3.2.12. Tested with Windows, OSX and Linux.\n. I tried this on my XP VM and yes it does crash shoes but you have to be quick on the clicks/mouse moves. FWIW I only allocate one core of my Linux box to the XP VM.\n. I forgot to mention I was clicking on the background of the Shoes screen (no script loaded or running) so that would be Shoes keypress\nI would be suspicious that mouse in/out/down event/resource isn't released or cleared or improperly reused if there is no Shoes+Script handler for the click. Then again that could be way off base. Good luck.\n. This doesn't seem to happen with Shoes 3.2 (windows gtk). Fixed?\n. I'm certainly open to talking about 3.2.  It doesn't seem that my pull request will be answered soon and I'm fine with that if that's what the community wants. However, I see no reason to leave bug reports hanging out that have been fixed - there's a lot more Linux bugs I could have commented on as fixed but I started with the oldest.\n. I don't know which git source is being built -- shoe/shoes or shoes/develop? Someone else on the mailing list has the same error message in Ubuntu (unspecified Ubuntu version and unspecified Shoes source).  Forget about the installed gems/bundler, Shoes has its own gem handler and won't use you system or user gems. Is RVM involved and is rvm set up per user or system wide?\n. Oh my tzar, you  live on the cutting edge, no? I have yet to see a Ruby built properly by any Linux distribution for Shoe's purposes since  the stone age Ruby 1.8.7. The default Ruby autoconf just doesn't build a Ruby that Shoes can use (nor will manually building Ruby 1.9.x from source and defaults work)\nHowever, rvm will build a  Ruby that Shoes can use. The Shoes develop branch folks have made all kinds of rake file 'improvements' for OSX variations that haven't been tested on Linux or Windows so you could have multiple problems to debug. First, install rvm Ruby 1.9.1 (not 1.9.2). rake clean in the shoes directory and then rake. If that works, let us know and then you can try ruby 1.9.2 or 1.9.3rc or whatever bleeding edge you care to support.\n. I'm just trying to help, tzar. You're the self appointed Maintainer of Shoes on Arch Linux, and if you don't want to debug things in Arch Linux just say so. Something has changed in Arch, Ruby or Shoes.  You're the maintainer so help us debug it. Or ask for Devyn's help on the mailing list, he's a big fan of Arch Linux.\n. Sweet! I do love solutions! It fits with \"Eelco ten Have\" problems (and his solution - just install the .run). I remember touching that shell script that runs after the download and install. I just made it work for 1.9.1 for why day and the Shoes 3 + Ruby 1.9.1. It was a hack before I got there, and it's still a hack until someone fixes minitar to handle symbolic links - a tar baby I choose to not touch,  Mea Culpa. \n. @tzar, No problem. I won't screw up my production environment either (he says while upgrading to Ubuntu 11.04 and was not a happy camper at the time I was 'helping' you). FWIW, rvm can be set up to only apply to the logged in non su user - thats how mine is set up. You could Add a new user account and experiment with rvm in there. Since Shoes is not a system wide installed app, it makes some sense that it's ruby is not tied to the 'system-wide' Ruby. Just my 2 cents.\n@steve, I've filed a bug report on the Ubuntu 11.04 build problem with solution hints.  For your CI tests could you add a \"shoes --help' or \"shoes -g list local\" execution step. That would test that the libraries in dist/ mostly work.\n. on linux, shoes -h exits\n. yes, the patch fixes the issue for ubuntu 64bit but should be tested on other Linux configs to make sure nothing bad happens.\n. Shoes should not require people do sudo things to the system libraries - easy to get that wrong and unknown consequences even when correct. (Think system upgrades). From what I can tell the ubuntu 11.10 release this month is going to have the same issue as 11.04 so it won't go away. It doesn't appear to be a debian decision but I could be wrong on that. \nI think the hack could be improved by parsing the RUBY_PLATFORM string more thoroughly  plus a call to uname -a way up top in the rakefile when it finds 'linux'  Then it should check where the libraries are. libsqlite3.so could easily be in /usr/local/somewhere (it would be if I installed it by hand)  That's still pretty brittle.\nOr perhaps there should be a linux pre-flight script that writes a manifest of which libraries Shoes should link against or copy and the rakefile uses that manifest.  I need to think more about it.\n. rake clean is an important task step for developers. Try compiling with 1.9.1. Now try compiling with 1.9.2 w/o the rake clean.\n. Ah, my long lost friend binject.  I'm still on Shoes 3.0 where binject is built by both 1.9.1 and 1.9.2. As steve noted when it is built correctly, it has lots of limitations.\n. I just cloned Shoes 3.1 on my Ubuntu 11.04 (64bit) and it fails to build (copying sqlitel3.so). That's a bug that I fixed and reported, and was accepted and somehow got mungled in the interwebs. Delete line 38 of make/linux/tasks.rb. It compiles and it runs with when I use the proper path to start it. This test was done in ~/Projects/shoes3.1/shoes so for me\nccoupe@twb:~/Projects/shoes3.1/shoes$ ./dist/shoes\nThat bug is for building from source. There may be a different but related bug when packaging a .run and then attempting to install the .run\n. Can you build Shoes from source? Make sure there is a dist/shoes-bin that is about this size:\nccoupe@twb:~/Projects/shoes3.1/shoes$ ls -l dist/shoes-bin \n-rwxr-xr-x 1 ccoupe ccoupe 12982 2011-11-10 21:21 dist/shoes-bin\n. The run file is a shell script with a binhexed  tarball included.  Inside the tarball there might be a shoes script and/or a linux binary Shoes image of the creators shoes installation.\nThe .run scripts looks to see if It's already installed shoes in ~/.shoes. If it finds one it won't reinstall shoes it just executes the one in the ~./shoes . If that version has an error - 32/64 mismatch or debian/unbuntu/arch/fedora libraries or even a error in one of the shell scripts or permission settings  it will continue to fail until it's cleaned out of ~/.shoes and the problem is fixed by regenerating a new download \nNaturally, it's all explained in the shell scripts that get packed into a .run by the rakefile  AND how the rake file builds shoes on your system. After you think about what those shell scripts do when executing on a users machine of different arch or os version, you'll think \"Linux users should build from source and I shouldn't make a Shoes-install.run available for download that is likely to fail\" Or you'll think \"I'm a gifted shell scripter and I can fix this with my bash skills\".  I thought I dissected .run files with a wiki article but maybe I didn't get around to it.\n. Sigh. I only hinted at the structure of the .run in https://github.com/shoes/shoes/wiki/A-Developer%27s-Tour-Through-The-Magic-Packager.  Perhaps I'll add a more technical details just to complete the docs but that won't stop people from believing they can package a linux binary\nThe proper way to distribute a shoes install in Ubuntu is a ppa (32/64, 10.+, 11+) or at least a .deb (both practically) and maintain them as shoes evolves. Lots of ways to get that wrong and kind of un_why-like. And the do the same for Fedora and Suse and Arch and maintain those too. OR a whole lot of love and testing applied to the Linux shell scripts involved and the rakefile and pack.rb that builds the run. We can't get Windows correct in packaging/install and struggle with OSX, Linux is even harder than the shifting versions of Windows and OSX.  We are few and they are many. \n. This bug doesn't happen with Shoes 3.2 (Win7 Gtk2 version of Shoes)\n. This probably wont solve the problem, but try installing w/o the sudo. Install as a regular user.  Also, odds are high it's a 32 bit Ubuntu app and your recent 64 bit Fedora 16 may have different opinions.  The best way in Linux is to build from source (no sudo required or desired) \n. The anatomy of a .run is pretty simple - shell script with binhexed  tarball payload that when the script is run, decodes and expands the tarball into ~/.shoes/[policeman|raisins]  unless there is one in there already from a previous shoes install which could have failed (Warning!) . The shoes download web site needs to restore the text about Linux should be built from source.\n. Would someone go to http://shoesrb.com/downloads and fix the frigging text for the linux download to include what Ubuntu variation it was built with. Please! Also point out it won't frigging work for anything else and point to the instructions on the wiki for building from source.\n. I've fixed this bug with Shoes3.2 (Linux and Windows)\n. if you change the radio groups to symbols (from the manual)\nradio_one = radio :group; para \"one\"\n  radio_two = radio :group;  para \"two\"\nit works as expected. You version didn't put them in the same group.\n. Hmm. I'm using Linux and modified your example slightly:\nShoes.app do\nradio_one = radio :group; para \"one\"\nradio_two = radio :group; para \"two\"\ninitialize the button(s):\nradio_two.checked = false # just to be sure\nradio_one.checked = true\nbutton \"quit\" do\n  alert(radio_one.checked? ? \"ok\" : \"failed\") # fails\n  exit\nend\nend\n. We have a difference between Linux (correct) and OSX (apparently incorrect) and it seems to be the\nradio_one.checked =  that fails on OSX. In ruby.c the function is 'shoes_check_set_checked_m'. On Gtk systems the code in the #ifdef is executed.  For Windows and OSX it call 'shoes_check_set_check'  (without the trail '-m') which will get you to cocoa.m and that as far as I can help.\n. Minor correction to my code reading. Linux/GTK manages it's radio grouped buttons. Windows and OSX have to \"fake it\" by running through the list of radio buttons in the group.  That could explain why  Jay's code needed the :symbol method on Linux instead of a string parameter.  It's not timer that make things work, per se. I suspect that there have been changes in OSX widget handling timing by Apple OS upgrades. The Shoes method of radio and groups creation is not the typical Apple method (as I remember it from old). The group and the button is added w/o text until the para call which has to involve some deferred processing or callback. \n. Comparing native/gtk.c function 'shoes_native_radio' with the same function in cocoa.m and windows.c suggests that the group arg appears to me to be unused in OSX and Windows. That would be a serious bug.\n. Confirmed the problem on XP (SP2) and the misbehavior is interesting. \nRevised test:\nShoes.app do\nradio_one = radio :group; para \"one\"\nradio_two = radio :group; para \"two\"\nradio_one.checked = true\nbutton \"verify\" do\n  alert(radio_one.checked? ? \"ok\" : \"failed\") # fails\nend\nend\nWhen that script runs in XP, NO Buttons are visually selected. That's another bug for XP. When one button is pushed then the group visually sort of acts normally. Looks like why never finished the Windows and OSX code for radios.\n. 1.9.3 ?!?!  I don't remember that discussion on the ML and BTW the distributed .rvmc doesn't work with my RVM setup. I think you're running too fast. Chill down or jump the shark.\n. When you move a gem into the Shoes ext/ and modify the rakefiles  it's no longer a gem! It's not even a binary Gem!  It's an _extension of Shoes Ruby and the rules are defined by Shoes not by rvm and it's gemsets or bundler or jeweller. It is no longer a gem. It's your own private Shoes!   Any changes in the ext/serialport directory require a 'rake clean' and 'rake' to rebuild your private Shoes.  You will also need to clean out ~/.shoes/??? of the previous attempts to build your serialport. If possible you should delete serialport gems in every rvm gemset and system ruby on your system until your know where YOUR Shoes will 'require' from.\nConfusing? Oh my, yes it is.  Extension rules not Gem rules.\n. As part of my cross compile experiment. I've had to look at some of your issues and perhaps I can offer places you should look at.  make/make.rb:common_build() has two lists to compile: Gems and Extensions.  Sqlite might be a place to check your assumptions. It's a gem with ruby in the gems lib code AND it needs a dll/.so/.dyld on the host (that would be as part of the install).  AFAIK, serialport would not be a Shoes Gem. It would be a Shoe extension.  Shoes built in gems and Shoes extensions are not the same.  DIFFERENT RULES rules. \nIf I was king, I'd put serialport in Shoes. Every one asks for it and everyone hits the brick wall of fail. It  works fine in Green Shoes, BTW and that is a lot easier than getting Red Shoes serialport working across all platforms. \n. You have two choices. Add serialport like binject and ftsearch OR add it like a gem with binary dependencies (sqlite3). In the sqlite3 example you'll to have to copy the dll/so/dydld into the dist/shoes. AFAIK, serialport doesn't have substantial ruby code (so it's like binject only much much smaller) so I'd do it as an extension like bloopsphone (was)\nAs edsammy said, there is an attraction to Shoes to create an easy GUI for embedded devices.  It's opposite of HacketyHack's audience. I've got devices that talk serial protocols over USB that only have propriety Windows or OSX installers. \n. Yeah. I remember that alerts in threads fails in Linux too.  Way back to Shoes2 code.  Ruby thread.new knows nothing about Shoes or it's GUI thread(s) that Shoes Throwing up a Modal dialog in a Ruby thread is just asking for GUI trouble. IMO, this is a insolvable problem unless Shoes defines it's own Ruby Thread class that ties into the Ruby and GUI toolkit threads.  Madness lives there.\nOne can design around the limitation in Shoes.  The solution is a big note in the Shoes Manual: Do not create Shoes Windows or Dialogs in Ruby Threads. Just don't do it.\n. In Ubuntu, 10.4 is a bit old (23 months and counting). I'm in no hurry getting off my 11.04/64  considering what I know or fear in 11.10\nFor Shoes, it would be best to build with the most current library layout (what ever is in 11.10, or the upcoming 12.04 and hope it works for most people who are current and a BIG BOLD note on the website that Linux users will Probably Have to Build From Source. \nJust need a volunteer (I think ashbb is 11.10 32bit VM)\n. @jrgifford  Your going to install 12.04 RCx, figure out how to get Unity to give you a terminal with a usable scrollbar, install rvm and the dependencies and build. In one afternoon? Esta mas cojones, mi amigo.\nOr is that \"estamos\"? \n. From what I know about the code changes since 3.0 , we only have a  maintenance release and it's mostly developer oriented with a few platform specific bugs fixed.  Save the pain of making the \"walkabout\" changes until we have done something interesting. Call it Policemen (r1814 or Shoes 3.2). Changing \"policeman\" to \"walkabout\" or \"anything\" in the code or rakefiles invites another FU from not understanding the interconnectedness. The Policeman Release was an FU. We all had a part in that mistake. We need to recognize that and we need to not do it again. \nFWIW, I updated to Unbuntu 11.10 permanently. Use the gnome option to login and get the gnome tweak app and after way too many afternoons of cursing and learning, it does not completely annoy me. Rumor is that GTK is going away in a few years. That's a serious problem for Red and Green Shoes.\n. You might have better luck with the no-video version (or not).  Ashbb has built a new shoes with 1.9.3 and he claims it works on Win 7.  Sadly, his r17xx version was announced on the mailing list and you'd have to search the ML to find it. \n. I'm the author of that find_and_copy() hack. IT IS A HACK!  I knew it would fail in the future. It has failed several times already. Please don't keep hacking on it more elegantly. The real  problem is that the rake files(s) don't detect where all the libraries live when the build starts on various linux, The hack runs at the end of the build to fix known problems with ubuntu 32/64 in the 10.4 time frame. That's a hack. Fix the rake detection way up top in the rake files.\n. Fixed in Shoes 3.2.12. \n. I'd close it. Shoes 3.2 uses clang/llvm/homebrew for OSX 10.9.x and it's fine with an rvm installed Ruby (2.1.2)  Packaging works too, with some limits.\n. Lets close this issue (months later). The problem is that when Ruby 1.9.3 starts up (initialized by Shoes) it looks for rbconfig.rb in the file system where the ruby was installed.  Since Shoes has a copy of Ruby at a different location all kinds of interesting error messages may occur.  The code in cache.rb that fixed things up barely worked with ruby 1.9.1 and 1.9.2 but it does not work \"properly\" with 1.9.3. If you convince your ruby to be built --enable-load-relative - there is a option to rvm to (re)build it that way (and you should) then you get a different set of error messages because Ruby 1.9.3 is HARDCODED to look for rubygems.rb  in lib/ruby/1.9.1 and Shoes has ruby/lib/   This all happens before the first line of Shoes.rb is run and there is nothing cache.rb can do about later.\nI fixed both of those problems with my fork of Shoes. If those mostly harmless error messages (they are mostly harmless until you try to install gems inside Shoes) bothers you, then clone my fork and rebuild. \n. I've fixed this bug in Shoes 3.2.13. Thanks for the test case and the hint on the solution.\n. Bug fixed in Shoes 3.2.12 and tested with Linux, Windows, OSX (10.9)\n. Please try Shoes 3.2.12 http://shoes.mvmanila.com . It should create 'something-osx.tgz' which contains 'something.app'\n. I'm a month late in responding. The pastebin link doesn't work for me, so I can't see the original posters error messages.  From just the above description I see a potential  bash problem/user input error.  Don't use ${SHOES_DIR}, just use 'shoes' in the git clone and cd. \n. Try the -h switch from the command line to get some other options too.\nOn 04/16/2014 09:07 AM, Tobias Pfeiffer wrote:\n\nHi there @JosephShering https://github.com/JosephShering - you \nshould totally be able to do that.\nHaven't used an official shoes install for a while but if you compiled \nit for yourself (at linux) you'll find the appropriate binary at \n|#{your_shoes_directory}/dist/shoes| - that's what I always use.

This more of an X11/Linux issue and not really one Shoes can solve since we just use Gtk2 and X11 like every graphical app on Linux. You need to get X11 running on your /dev/fb1 device.  The pi forums are probably a better place to find hints. \n. I have a pi but I use a hdmi monitor and it's own keyboard. Shoes works in that situation. I vaguely remember reading somewhere about the PiTFT and X11.\n. It has to be run after startx. either from a LXDE terminal or from a LXDE menu entry.  Shoes requires all the graphics libraries on the pi be available and running before it starts. X11 can be confusing and very flexible after some experience.\n. Packaging hasn't worked on Shoes 3.x for several years. Last I looked, the website it's trying to download from is unresponsive.\n. Sadly, nothing - unless you're willing to build Shoes from C source on Windows - then you can include your app.rb  instead of shoes.rb  which isn't the same thing.   I'd like to fix packaging for Shoes 3.2 or 3.3  but it's way down on the priority list. Someone who knows MinGW C on Windows could help a lot. \n\nShoes 3.2 @ http://shoes.mvmanila.com/\n. You can still wrap your script or directory in a .shy and tell the users to download Shoes (.run. .dmg/.bz2, exe) first. A bit of pain for them but that should work on all Shoes versions 3.0 ,3.1, 3.2, & 4 (preview version).  Binary packaging Shoes with a script is wonderfully complex and  horrifyingly complex.  The current crappy code can be made to work for Windows if there was a website to download from. \n. The url of the website is hardcoded into the Shoes ruby code AND in the 'C' launcher code (for windows) so you have to build all of Shoes and any copies of it will be tied to that web server.  It would be your own version of Shoes, different from any other Shoes and that has many implications. It's even more work if you want it to work for OSX and Linux. Work which has to be done first before fixing the packager.\n. Shoes 3.2.11 now has packaging for Windows, OSX, and Linux (from any of them, for any of them). Beware. It's a 15 to 20MB thing - it includes Shoes and Ruby with your script. \n. I'm not in charge of the Website. Shoes 3.2 is not a priority for them.   Until then you'll have to download from my website - the packager is also tied to my  website, but that can be changed by regular users if they set up their own Shoes download site (perhaps a large  intranet, e.g.)\n. I'll open the issue and provide the info. Tobias et all can edit the html. I hate editing html ;^)\n. Sometimes the admin needs a reminder to check the pull requests.\n. Shoes has no menubar or menus attached to a window or across windows. You can create a menu (links or button) with a stack or flow and clever programming (see the Shoes manual for an example, or HacketyHack). It depends on your project requirements and the amount of effort you want to put into it.\n. Fixed in Shoes 3.2.13 \n. It's wasn't a known problem until now. Thanks for reporting it. I can \nreproduce your problem.\nOddly, binject.so is right where the error message says it is. I suspect \nI may have been too agressive in stripping the debugging symbols.\nI'll follow up with a newer version that works once I figure out what's \nwrong.\nThanks for the bug report.\n--Cecil\nOn 08/27/2014 01:23 PM, Gavin Kistner wrote:\n\nI am trying to create a self-running .exe on Windows.

This may take some time than either of us like.  The only work around would be to do the packaging from OSX or Linux (for an exe). Older versions of 3.2 that I know worked,  don't work any more. I hate blaming Windows updates but that's the leading explanation. \n. Sadly, the packager is currently limited to packing one (1) file.  It's a big weakness that's on the todo list.  One could try packing your directory into a .shy and then package that into an .exe - it might work. \n. @Phrogz  (and others watching). I've updated Shoes 3.2.15 (Sept 2 2014 date). It's now working for me: Packaging a single script with Shoes Windows.  Packaging a directory hasn't been fixed yet.\n\nYou'll have to download and reinstall 3.2.15 to test it. \n. Sigh.  This is going to be a tough one to fix - I don't have the Windows skills to debug that. The best guess is a mismatch between Gtk threads (pthreads emulation), Ruby threads and the unlying Windows threading. \n. No one can promise to fix anything or give you a time frame. If it was easy it would have been fixed years ago.\n. It would be helpful to know why Windows thinks it's hung - What event is it not responding to. I don't know the Windows event system well enough or the tools. I haven't found a log that shows anything I understand.  Maybe the App is running 100% cpu? Or 0% These would be helpful data points.\n. Thanks, that helps a bit. If that is  the cpu used by Shoes when Windows reports a hang then I really need to find a tool that reports on all threads of a running app.  I vaguely recall there is such a thing.\nThe event  handling I'm worried about isn't Shoes, it's lower down in gtk, and windows.\n--Cecil\n. Here's a description of what's happening from Windows perspective.  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd744765%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\nI'm not signing up of their service so that option is closed.\n. Hmm. According to the perfmon tool (search for it, you probably have it). A shoes app doing nothing, just sitting there (splash screen, manual, my little app) runs 100%  That's before it hangs. Can anybody confirm?  If true, it's really bad.\n. I haven't checked your hangon.rb code yet but you're comment about the logging continuing says something very important. Ruby is not hung and much of Shoes is not hung.  My observation of 100% at idle suggests that the gui thread (gtk2 isn't behaving) properly. It certainly gives me a place to see if there is a silly error on my part. \n. Thanks so much. Process Explorer is what I was looking for. The stack button gets me very close to\nwhere the race condition is. At first glance, their may be confusion between Ruby and Gtk (cause by me and Shoes) on clocks and time.\n. I think I know where the problem lies (it's in Shoes calling a deprecated Ruby internal function). It's blind luck that it runs in Linux. Too soon to say what the fix is or how long it will take to fix. Thanks for your perseverance and support.\n. For those willing to test, I've uploaded a Shoes 3.2.16 with some changes that (so far) don't hang on Windows. It still runs 100% cpu (one core) at idle so my task is not finished.\nhttp://shoes.mvmanila.com/public//public/shoes/beta/shoes-3.2.16-gtk2-32.exe\nPlease do not use the Shoes packaging features with this beta.\nWoops -don't bother.\n. Don't tell anyone, but there is  a Shoes-3.2.16-msw-32.exe you could download. Subtle differences in the name. It doesn't use Gtk, It's more like Shoes 3.1 at the C level and is more likely to exhibit additional bugs. The hang may be more frequent with it -- it's been a problem since 3.0 \n. There's a memory leak  in Shoe animation (all platforms). Watch the splash screen suck memory 4KB/min or faster. Depending on your app, that might matter. Might not. Supposedly, gtk2/windows has a optional theming engine which is  not included with Shoes. I think it's bit ugly on Windows but I never intended to support Windows with 3.2 until it just happened to cross compile and kind of work. \nThe original problem still exists. \n. Status update: I'm still working on the problem(s) with help from Backorder.  It's not pretty being this deep in the swamp. You should not expect a quick answer. Sorry.\n. For the bold (or desperate): I think I've fixed the problem. It works for me which might be different than works for you, so it needs some testing. http://shoes.mvmanila.com/public/shoes/beta/shoes-3.2.16-gtk2-32.exe\nI'll hunt you down and taunt you if you complain about the new packaging features in this issue thread or complain that the beta spawns a console window and its 8MB larger. It's a beta! And it needs testing.\n. Thats odd.  Which version of Shoes are you using? If it's 3.2 you should have a Maintain Shoe link on the splash screen and from there  you can get some build info. I just checked my OSX system and the build on 20140903 doesn't exhibit the problem you describe. \n. Very odd. That's Ruby code that hasn't been changed in ages. (Shoes.app/Contents/MacOS/lib/shy*.rb). One speculation is that perhaps Shoes doesn't like the UK keycodes. That sounds like crazy talk to me. Can you try some of the Samples from the manual (AndSoForth section) and enter text?  Simple-controls should work.\n. Tom, are you tabbing to the next field in the Shy screen or clicking to the next field. Tab navigation (focus) is a problem on OSX (all Shoes actually but worse on OSX)\n. Tom,  I'm seeing some weirdness too with the 3.2.15 download now (doesn't work at all).  Give 3.2.14 a try at http://shoes.mvmanila.com/public/shoes/  That seems to work better. \n. Or the 3.2.16 beta in http://shoes.mvmanila.com/public/shoes/beta/ - don't the packaging features with\nthis one.\n. Tom,  I've taken another look at this issues.  The latest Shoes 3.2.16 beta works ok for me. Do you have other versions of Shoes on your box(en)? \n. @SteamComputing. Thanks for reporting  and including an easy test case and work around.  Thanks. Definitely a problem. \n. I found the problem. It will be fixed in 3.2.17. If you promise not to package things for Windows, you can get a beta with the fix from http://walkabout.mvmanila.com/public/shoes/shoes-3.2.17-osx-10.9.tgz \n. Mr BackOrder, you seem to know your way around Windows better than I. There is a lot wrong imho with what Shoes does with nsis , particularly after I changed how Shoes version numbers work. \nThanks for the bug report and the solution pointer.  It's going to be low priority for me with all the other issues currently needing attention. \n. Actually, no one has built Shoe on Windows since the Wiki article was \noutdated ;^).  I haven't. I cross compile the windows stuff on my Linux \nmachine - that is complicated  - Ruby hates being cross compiled. I have \nthe scars - documented in my blog at walkabout.mvmanila.com and in the \nnotes/ of the github repo (none of which make sense until you get into it).\nThe basics are simple. Install MSys. Install RubyInstaller (a 32 bit \nversion, 2.x.y although 1.9.3 should work). Install the matching devkit \n(mingw compiler tool chain) from the RubyInstaller links. It might get \ncomplicated if you have MSFT compilers already installed in your path. \nSo I've heard.\nThen you have install git (if Msys or devkit did'nt) and clone my Shoes \ngithub repo. Try a simple 'rake' which might work. Then fix the \nmake/mingw/env.rb and task.rb files to be more like my cross compiled \nxmingw32 or xmsw32 (env.rb and tasks.rb).\nIt's grinding work but it's not hard work. Once you learn to hate the \nRakefiles like me and are willing to live with them, then It's almost easy.\nOh, I forgot! You'll  need the freaking dependencies: glib, cairo, \npango, cairopango, zlib and Gtk2. Just download the pre-built binary dev \nbundle for gtk2 on Windows (2.28 I think) and move the dlls, libs and \nheaders to where they need to be for your system to compile, build and run.\nIt's probably better to take this conversation to email instead of \nfilling up bug report threads.\nccoupe@cableone.net\nOn 09/29/2014 11:11 PM, BackOrder wrote:\n\nNo pressure, simply reporting this bug since I encountered it while \nfirst uninstalling 3.2.15 to try Shoes 3.2.16.

I'm sorry to hear that.  I un-install/install shoes two or three times a week on Win7 and haven't seen this problem.  I know it was tested by others on 8.1. Do you have other applications that set the path? Perhaps shoes is conflicting with them?\n. I've fixed this (NSIS now has longer strings) and tested it,  @Chia-KY  There's a beta build of Shoes 3.2.19 that has this fix at http://walkabout.mvmanila.com/public/shoes/shoes-3.2.19-gtk2-32.exe \nPlease don't use the Advanced Packaging in the beta. \n. It would be best to refile this issue over at https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues where we just happen to be discussing some font issues - https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/96. Yours looks similar - we'd love to fix it if you can help us.\n. Sort of. Maybe. Over at the Shoes 3.2 issues there is https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/26 which shows the window events and their problems. Not mentioned there is that if you call exit() none of the gui events fire.\n. Shoes 3.2 is a lot more refined than 3.1  (the repo you reported this bug to ) and it works better than it ever did. Shoes 4 is the java/swt version that isn't completely nailed down.   \n\nTo close/kill  a Ruby spawned process (not really a  Shoes  process/window)  is highly platform specific. I suggest you file a new bug report at https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3 with some additional details  (like the platform you are using) or if your running Shoes4 then the issue tracker is https://github.com/shoes/shoes4\n. @southwolf - Thanks for the bug report and with details! I need one more detail though (or two). My first guess is you have an older Shoes 3.2 but my first guess can be wrong. From the Shoes splash screen -> Maintain Shoes -> Shoes Info. What is the value displayed for Shoes Release: \nFWIW, The Shoes 3.2 issues are at https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3. This issue list is for 3.0 and 3.1 - yes it is confusing.\nDoes the app run well  after the delay? Is there a delay if you quit and relaunch?\n. @southwolf -It would be best if you filed an new issue at Shoes3 (with a link back to here). Do you happen to have quartz-X11 installed in homebrew for other programs and projects?\n. @aarmora, you didn't mention which version of Shoes you are using the old 3.1 or the newer 3.2  that has it's own issue page at https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3. If it's 3.2, that stack trace suggests you are attempting to run scraper.rb and it's not where it's supposed to be (I assume your testing the packaged exe and it's only one file (not a shy?). \n. Jordan, on Windows the script (or shy) inside the packaged.exe is expanded into %HOME%\\AppData\\Local\\Shoes when run on the users machine (and deleted when Shoes is closed).  With the console error screen up, Shoes isn't closed so you should be able to look in there to make sure it is there and named correctly.  Please open a new issue at https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues so it can be tagged and followed.  Please mention which Windows version you are using and the Shoes 3.2.xx (or r(nnnn) number so I know how old it is.  Also, how you packaged it - 'download if needed' or 'include shoes' and whether you packaged from the command line or from the Shoes GUI.\n. Huh? Did you enter this in the wrong window?\n. I can \"close\" it here but I can't move it to where ever you wanted to complain to. There are 1000's (perhaps 1000 x 10) of projects on github. I can only manage comments on 3 of them.  I'll close this issue which is all I can do for my little section of github You will have to find the github project that bothers you and re comment there. \n. You appear to be using Shoes 3.1 which is old and very out of date. Shoes 3.2 is up to date and even has binaries for Linux if you don't want to build from source.  Much of the 3.2 work was done on Ubuntu 14.04 so I know it works ;-) See https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/wiki/Building-Shoes-on-Linux if you want to build from source.\n. I no idea who or what plexus is or does or why you think anyone here can update that page.\n. This is an older version of Shoes3.0 and those instructions are old . Shoes 3.2 is at https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3 if you want to build from source. You can also get a prebuilt linux  binary that may work on arch linux. (it doe work on Ubuntu/Debian/Suse/Fedora) http://shoesrb.com/downloads/\nOr you can try Shoes 4 which is jRuby based. https://github.com/shoes/shoes4.\n. Hi David! @Dassadar \nIf you downloaded shoes3.3.0.install into your Downloads folder or where ever your browser stored, open a terminal,  and cd to where the .install is. then\n$ chmod +x Shoes-3.3.0-gtk3-x86_64.install \n$ ./Shoes-3.3.0-gtk3-x86_64.install \nThe first command sets the executable permission. The second command executes the install. You'll get a message on the terminal that Shoes was installed and to look in your menus for it. \nIn your home directory will be a .shoes/ directory and a walkabout directory in there. If you want to run shoes from the command line then you could type $ ~/.shoes/walkabout/shoes file-to-run.rb\n. Menu's are bit of a mystery depending on your Choice of desktop manager.  I happen to hate the default Ubuntu Unity thing with having to search for an app,  so I changed mine to heavily tailored Cinnamon. \nDid you try the logout, log back in advice? \nIn ~/.shoes/federales you may find a copy of the Shoes.desktop - don't delete it. It's needed to uninstall the menus once you find them.. I'd does show a working examples for many Linux desktops - not yours apparently so I can't help much. . desktop file are also stored in different places by different Managers, often in /usr/share but I've seen stuff in ~/.share and other places. \nwhere ever they are, they were installed by xdg-desktop-menu. \n. You can also choose a different window manage from the Login page - Maybe Gnom-Shell works better? \n. remove the app. from the start of stack, flow, edit_box and image. also remember Shoes 3.2/3 has a different issue page. As does Shoes 4\n. That code works on my Ubuntu box! I don't have img/ok.jpg which the Shoes console tell me about.  What error message are you getting - alt / to get the console.\n. \n. We need to verify that you've installed Shoes.  Are you running from the Menus or the command line? Linux or Windows? .  Can you run Shoes at all - the manual? the maintain shoes? the samples in the manual->furthermore ?\n. In samples is simple-control-sizes.rb (or the Packaging, or Maintain Shoes->Manage_Gems) all use edit_boxes, if they work, then the problem would be something in your code like somehow they are defaulted to hidden state or Shoes just doesn't see them as Shoes methods.   If edit_boxes don't show up in the examples mentioned then it's something much much different that would affect all applications on your machine, not just Shoes.\n. You have to attach files using the web browser https://github.com/shoes/shoes/issues/282 . Replying in email doesn't send them to github (or to mail box)\n. Here's what it should look like:\n\nThat screams some sort of theme problem. Notice edit box and edit list are both wrong! However, you do have edit_lines.  Do you have some sort of mobile friendly theme installed. I'm Ubuntu 14.04.\n. Please  posting a new issue at https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3 since this site is only for very old Shoes. Over there, are some additional  folks that don't monitor this old site. They may have better ideas.  Be sure to mention Ubuntu 15.10. This is very disturbing.  If if you just want to click things, then you could change themes and/or check the settings inside.\n. @rucuriousyet  Please ask on Shoes 3 or Shoes 4 depending which one you're asking about.  In general. Shoes does not have menus so there is nothing to build a menubar with. Depending on the platform and shoes version their may be 'workable' tray support - depending on what you want to do. . Thanks for the Java pointer.  Shoes 3 can not do that - no structured menu support.  I've added the request to Shoes 3.3 . Shoes 4 uses swt instead of  awt/swing - I have no idea if swt has that ability and if it's cross platform. . @rucuriousyet, @ilovemysillybanana  please see https://github.com/Shoes3/shoes3/issues/363 and provide your opinion and even better, a use case. . Better to move this question to Shoes 3. Might still be an open issue there?   Short answer is we tried calculating the rect size of a text string using pango and it was not sufficiently better than  (str.length*font_width_guess)+some_padding. . ",

Thanks, I will let You know. I did try the 'homebrew' approach but it fails during the 'rake osx:deps:install' phase. I filed an issue with the Maintainers and am waiting for it to be addressed since I have no idea how to proceed in order to fix it Myself.\n. Well, something happened alright but I do not think it was what I wanted. Using 'rake --trace', I get the output found at https://gist.github.com/1358286. Any thoughts on how to proceed? Apart from the erros prompted by the use of the '-arch' option, one piece which strikes Me as possibly incorrect is the reference to the 10.6 SDK but that information is possibly less urgent at this stage than the '-arch' errors. I am not certain enough how the command line is being created to alter this Myself.\n. Okay, so, this has really become two issues then (1) homebrew: I did a 'brew update' after clearing out the *.gz files from ~/Library/Caches/Homebrew and am getting a new error on 'rake osx:deps:install' relating to -march options (this seems related to the fact homebrew is trying to use GCC 4.2 when My system is set to use GCC 4.5 from mac ports) but I can discuss that with the homebrew People and (2) My GCC 4.2 is build 5577 (https://gist.github.com/1358364).\nSwitching to GCC 4.2 (via 'port select'), homebrew ... (trying it out) ... still fails on the same spot. Yep, definitely need to discuss with the homebrew People.\nMaking the changes in Rakefile and make/darwin/env.rb, well, no reference in Rakefile but in the env.rb I have two. Upon changing them and running rake, I get warnings about converting 64 bit types to 32 bit values. These warnings cause rake to abort since, for whatever reason, the compiler is being passed a -Werror=shorten-64-to-32 option. As far as I can tell, this option is not requested by the Rakefile, yes?\n. So ... does Anyone have any thoughts about the rakefile with respect to -Werror=shorten-64-to-32 option or why the rake command is trying to use that option?\n. D'oh! I don't know why I did not try that. I guess I keep thinking of symbols as strings. Thanks!\n. ",

I cloned from the git repo (git://github.com/shoes/shoes.git) so it's definitely the newest version.\nAs far as system setup goes, I can't think of much that that could be causing this. I'll just throw some details in. This Fedora installation was originally branched/Rawhide, then updated to 15 after release. RVM isn't installed and as far as I recall hasn't ever been (but I may be wrong). I think I built Ruby with its default configuration (dynamic libraries) but I'm not sure.\nIf you need to know anything just ask. I'm about to hit the hay though so I won't be around for a while. Thanks for the help so far.\n. I deleted as much of my 1.9.2 build as I could, then installed and removed 1.8 through yum (just thought it may clear anything I missed), then installed RVM and built 1.9.2 through that and shoes built and runs successfully. Thanks.\n. ",

    "myra": "Thanks for the quick reply. I guess I should have shown the following link to the bug.\nhttp://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3357929&group_id=976&atid=100976\nThe comment by the developer makes it clear the types.h file won't be replaced. The build log is here:\nhttp://pastebin.com/i8c3dUrR\nHope this helps.\nMyra\n. One more thing. The build log was after commenting out types.h in /shoes-git/src/shoes/shoes/config.h. I don't use an AUR helper. I download the tarball, extract it, and run makepkg.\n. The solution is at, it's the types.h file from a previous release.\nhttp://pastebin.com/vcmshQGS\nPut it in the shoes directory along with the config.h file, change the include line to #include , and the build works (at least on my x86_64 box). I've only tested one of the sample, and it worked.\n. The difference is due to Arch Linux. The rolling release model keeps everything up to date with the lateset releases. The file existed but was empty until curl version 7.21.7-1 which was just released. If you look at the pastebin I posted, the original file didn't contain much. I just used the file from a previous release instead of an empty file.\nThis problem won't affect other distros until the update curl to version 7.21.7-1. Including it with the shoes files seems to cure the problem and it could be an empty file like the one on your Ubuntu box.\nMyra\n. Then the build fails as the build log here shows http://pastebin.com/i8c3dUrR . Thats why I started my search for the problem. I suppose rewriting shoes to eliminate the problem is also an option, I was just trying to determine the problem and find a solution so I could try out shoes.\nAs I said, it won't be a problem until distros upgrade curl to version 7.21.7-1 when the empty file is dropped from curl and won't be replaced as per the bug report here http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3357929&group_id=976&atid=100976 .\nThe app belongs to y'all, I was just trying to solve my immediate problem.\nMyra\n. No such thing as a pedantic a**hole. This was my bad. Software needs to be done correctly, at least that's what I've come to believe over the last 40+ years. I'm not a C programmer and prone to make such mistakes when I occassionally slip off into that bad habit. Thanks for pointing out my error. I had a manager once who said \"if your not screwing up ocassionally, you're not doing anything\". I must be really busy.\n. ",

So removed homebrew and rvm, started fresh.  I figure out that cairo wasn't installed correctly.  I assume it's because I'm using Xcode 4.2 (llvm-gcc.  I think I need to figure this out first.  Anyone know how to get cairo it to build in 10.7.1 with llvm-gcc4.2?\n. thats the problem, rake osx:reps:install is failing on cairo:\nld: lto: could not merge in .libs/cairo-analysis-surface.o because Unknown instruction for architecture x86_64\ncollect2: ld returned 1 exit status\nI guess the default cairo on homebrew fails with llvm-gcc?\n. 2011 MBP i7\nI saw in another thread you guys were trying different cairo formulas, I tried one that was linked and it built. \nSo I don't think this is really a problem with shoes, its with the version of cairo homebrew is using.\n. So I used cairo1.8.10 and pango1.28.1 from https://github.com/secondplanet/homebrew/blob/patch-5/Library/Formula/cairo.rb and https://raw.github.com/secondplanet/homebrew/patch-6/Library/Formula/pango.rb\ngot everything to build with rake osx:deps:install\nthen when I run rake, it appears it can't find pano\nI tried brew link pang, but it says its already linked....\nhere's the rake trace\nJeremys-MacBook-Pro:shoes jeremy$ rake\ngcc -I. -c -oshoes/app.o -Wall -I/usr/local/include

It appears to be \"resolved\" by wrapping the shoes .run file in some sort of an archive (tar, bzip, zip etc).\nHowever, while this might in theory \"solve\" the issue, it's more of a band-aid than a solution unfortunately.\nUnless of course as part of the magic rakefile that makes the .run, it zips it up\u2026 hmm.

I assume you downloaded the .run from Github?\n. @steveklabnik Judging by the date you uploaded it, it was probably 11.10 32 bit. \n. @steveklabnik Just tested, it works, submitting pull request in a moment (and yes, i shall credit @ngiger.)\n.

Considering that the default download for all linux distros I've seen (other than Arch) is 32, i don't think 64 bit is worth the trouble. Yay or nay?\n. The error I pasted above is complaining about not knowing where the libraries are - since it was compiled on a pre-multiarch lib OS version (10.04), it will probably fail on say, 32 bit Fedora 14 or 15 - since it doesn't know that the libraries are in /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/ and /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ - it thinks they're in /usr/lib/\n.

I do not currently use shoes in any projects and only took over as maintainer to fix the build script when I was tinkering with it many months ago so that others could benefit. Shoes worked then on the stock ruby with no problems, and it'd be nice to fix the script so it works now with no problems, and preferably without needing a patched ruby (which is rather against the \"arch way\"). I am quite happy to give the role of package maintainer to anyone who actually uses shoes and uses arch linux who has more of a vested interest in the project than I do. I reported this bug as I was requested to by steveklabnik, not because I wanted it to be fixed for me because I live on the bleeding edge (it makes little to no difference to me at this point in time). It just happens that that is how arch (and I) have things set up. Anyway, sorry if I rubbed you the wrong way, it was not my intent..

Will enter a separate issue about the fonts thing.\nRe item 2, if I can get the environment running on my MacBook, and we end up using it for the project, I'll be happy to do what I can to help you sort the issue with the macports environment.  I've never used homebrew, so I've no idea what the brew calls are actually doing in the rakefile.  \"Back\" to OSX from using Linux as primary platform since Apple bought NeXT and originally dropped Intel support for Rhapsody (years ago), so haven't really paid much attention to macports other than getting the tools I needed on the machine so I had a sane command line environment.  Might take a bit of investigation before I can a) understand exactly what the issue is and b) contribute something useful to the project.\nRight now, I'm just under pressure to find something simple that allows me to leverage Ruby to present a simple, non-Web UI on both Windows and OSX. :)\nCheers,\nast\n. Will have to check the other machine at the office to be sure, but not intentionally.  I originally copied it to the Applications directory before trying to mess with it at work.  However, this morning it's working properly when launched from the Applications directory on a different machine.\nI guess it's a non-issue.  Might be worth adding to the FAQ somewhere, because I couldn't find any obvious troubleshooting tips for this issue.\nWill close this issue as now having working environment and can move forward with my tinkering.  Thanks for the suggestion!\n. The OSX version is 1739.  Both the OSX and the Windows versions were downloaded from the shoesrb.com/downloads links.\nIt looks like the offending line is here in common.rb:\n214     def escape(str, unsafe = @regexp[:UNSAFE])\n215       unless unsafe.kind_of?(Regexp)\n216         # perhaps unsafe is String object\n217         unsafe = Regexp.new(\"[#{Regexp.quote(unsafe)}]\", false)\n218       end\n219       str.gsub(unsafe) do\n220         us = $&\n221         tmp = ''\n222         us.each_byte do |uc|\n223           tmp << sprintf('%%%02X', uc)\n224         end\n225         tmp\n226 #      end.force_encoding(Encoding::US_ASCII)\n227       end\n228     end\nSo, I just commented out the #force_encoding call in my OSX version so I could get on with what I was trying to do.  Obviously, this isn't exactly the ideal solution.\nFrom googling, this seemed to be the most relevant result, but isn't Shoes related: https://github.com/brianmario/mysql2/issues/178\nMy guess is that something strange is happening with namespaces somewhere, but I don't have any specific evidence for that.  Once I commented out the #force_encoding, the gem installed and the above code works fine.\n. It is?\nvalkyrie$ ./shoes -v\nshoes policeman (0.r1739) [universal.x86_64-darwin11.1.0 Ruby1.9.1]\nApologies.  I should've put this in originally.\n. Ok.  Thanks for the clarifications and the fix for the version stuff.  Makes more sense now.\n. Actually, this gets worse once you try and save anything.  The Encoding thing bites you in the backside all over the place.\nThe only way I was actually able to continue with what I was doing was to hack the .shoes/+gem/gems/activesupport-3.1.2/lib/active_support/core_ext/string/encoding.rb file to force it to define #encoding_aware? to return false.  Doing this (and the above) will allow you to use AR as expected.\n. I hadn't ever had an occasion to look into class instance variables before.  I only use class variables extremely rarely, but it seems to me that what Widget is trying to do is exactly the case Fowler describes in the article about class variables:\n\nClass variables, often referred to as static variables, are shared across all instances of a class. Every instance points to same value and any changes are seen by all.\n\nIt seems to me that in this case, what Widget needs is exactly to implement the Registry pattern across all instances of the Widget class, regardless of where they are in the hierarchy.  Alternatively, it seems that it might be just a side effect of the instantiation order of derived classes by the interpreter.  I don't know enough about the internals to comment further.\nI'll send you a pull request later today, because I really need this for how I'm trying to use Shoes.  How do you guys manage release schedules for the binaries?  Is there a roadmap, or is it more ad-hoc than that?\nThanks for the feedback,\nast\n. No worries.  Totally understand both points.\nWhere's the best place to put the simple test case above?  It doesn't really seem like a good sample, but I think it should be there somewhere to demonstrate the issue is actually resolved...\n. Um, right.  All I see in the spec directory is a set of tests for homebrew.  I've no idea how to integrate a GUI test into rspec.  \nThe only Ruby test frameworks I've used are RUnit and Testy.  I pretty much use Testy for all my Ruby tests these days.\nThe reason for my question is that I don't see any Shoes-specific, GUI test cases anywhere.  I guess I'm just blind... ;)\nAlso bear in mind that at the present time, I can't actually build Shoes on either of my machines, so anything that requires a full build just isn't going to happen for a while.  Sorry.  I'm already a week or so behind on what I'm trying to actually do with Shoes, so I have to ship something before I can go back and attack the build issues.\n. First off, I don't understand what the big deal is here in this case.  Why is it not the right thing to have Widget maintain a list of all the inherited types, regardless of the level of inheritance?  The way that the above is coded assumes that Widget is the registry of all derived types.  The class instance variable breaks this once you get into another derived type.\nThe above example from @wasnotrice doesn't illustrate the problem because it only has one level of inheritance.\nThis is an example that illustrates the problem:\n```\n$ cat /tmp/foo.rb\nclass A\n  @types = {}\n  def self.inherited subc\n    @types[subc.name.downcase] = subc\n  end\nend\nclass B < A; end\nclass C < B\n  def initialize\n    puts \"C\"\n  end\nend\nC.new\n```\nAnd when run:\n$ ruby /tmp/foo.rb\n/tmp/foo.rb:4:in `inherited': undefined method `[]=' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)\n    from /tmp/foo.rb:10\nInstrumenting it a bit further confirms what I suspected.  The class instance variable idiom breaks here because you're defining the instance variable for class A - and only class A - yet when inheriting from class B, you're still executing the same #inherited method (due to inheritance), but the variable referenced in the base class method doesn't actually exist.  Naturally, this is the definition of what class instance variables do, and this is why the idiom breaks in this case.\nI understand you guys seem allergic to class variables, but I don't see any other way to solve this problem without rethinking the way that Widget manages the registry of helper methods.\nHere's the modified test case:\n```\n$ cat /tmp/foo.rb\nclass A\n  @types = {}\n  def self.inherited subc\n    puts \"Subclass: #{subc}\"\n    @types[subc.name.downcase] = subc\n  end\nend\nclass B < A; end\nclass C < B\n  def initialize\n    puts \"C\"\n  end\nend\nC.new\n```\nand the output:\n$ ruby /tmp/foo.rb\nSubclass: B\nSubclass: C\n/tmp/foo.rb:5:in `inherited': undefined method `[]=' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)\n    from /tmp/foo.rb:11\nRe @steveklabnik on tests, yes, I know GUI testing is hard.  I spent about 7 years doing automated GUI testing on Windows, and it's still a nightmare on most platforms.  While the issue itself doesn't need the GUI (as we've shown above), I wasn't aware that you could instantiate Widget instances without having the UI involved.  If you can, then the test case becomes trivial.  If you can't, then you need to ensure that the instance exists/or no exception was thrown.\nLooking forward to see what you come up with, and have a good flight to wherever you're going! :)\n. No worries, guys.  Not trying to be a pain, just need this to work given how I'm trying to use Shoes! ;)\nThought I'd also share a bit more analysis just in case anyone else wonders what's happening and why this is the right solution.  Naturally, you could obviously fix the bug simply by following Fowler's example and ensuring that the variable was initialized if it didn't already exist, but I don't think that's useful in this case.  Since the #inherited method is defining methods on the Shoes class dynamically at compile time based on the registry of all widgets to instantiate the derived class via a helper alias, the only way it can do this is by accessing a global registry of all Widget classes.  Obviously, Widget is already a global object, so it's a good candidate for holding this registry.\nIf the class instance idiom were used, the reference to the derived subclass name when the method in Shoes was called would return a nil reference, and the mechanism would still break--just in a different place.\nHere's another quick example:\n```\n$ cat /tmp/foo.rb\nclass A\n  def self.inherited subc\n    puts \"Subclass: #{subc}\"\n    @types ||= {}\n    @types[subc.name.downcase] = subc\n    puts \"@types: #{@types.inspect}\"\n  end\ndef self.types\n    @types\n  end\nend\nclass B < A; end\nclass C < B\n  def initialize\n    puts \"C\"\n  end\nend\nC.new\nputs \"A @types: #{A.types.inspect}\"\nputs \"B @types: #{B.types.inspect}\"\nputs \"C @types: #{C.types.inspect}\"\n```\nand the output:\n$ ruby /tmp/foo.rb\nSubclass: B\n@types: {\"b\"=>B}\nSubclass: C\n@types: {\"c\"=>C}\nC\nA @types: {\"b\"=>B}\nB @types: {\"c\"=>C}\nC @types: nil\nAgain, perfectly in line with the expected behavior of class instance variables.  The registry maintained by each type only contains references to the direct subtypes.  Unfortunately, this isn't what the original code implies it really wants to do.  It seems to want to create helpers for every Widget subclass so they're available just the same as the built-in methods.  The only way to do this that I know is to have a registry of all subtypes and to centralize that registry somewhere convenient, like the root of the type tree.\nRe @steveklabnik on Widget being experimental/half baked:  I think there are potentially some other problems with this approach in larger projects with name collisions.  If someone defines A::MyWiget and someone else defines B::MyWidget, I'm not actually sure which one you'll get when you call Shoes#my_widget.  Maybe this approach will need to be flagged for a revisit at some stage.\nI'm creating a few widgets in different namespaces, and it took me a while to figure out exactly what the relationship was between the magic helper method and the class names.  Given the above potential conflict scenario, I'm not actually sure what the right answer is except to say \"don't do that.\"  Doesn't really seem like a robust solution... ;)\n. No worries.  I haven't had a chance to try and come up with a good way to test the change either, given all the rest of the hair pulling over the last couple of weeks... ;)\nThanks for the update.\n. ",

Since I am running OSX I have been testing out the builds just by dragging the ruby file onto the app in the launch bar. I believe the jeweler aspect is not a problem because that is not a C based library. \nWhen I tried to build the default shoes under the normal environment instead I could not get it to build but that is another issue. If rvm is messing up the serialport build I will have to do some work to get the native environment up to date.

I guess then next step is to get it to build without rvm since that seemed to work for you.\nThanks for your continued support,\nEd\n.

It sounds like serialport is working on your linux machine. I guess its just a platform issue.\n. My .shoes directory is completely empty. In /shoes_serialport/dist/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems the serialport gem is not being built. Im assuming all of the shoes gems are built in there. @lljk does your serialport built have the serialport in that directory?\nThanks for everyone's assistance.\nEd\n. I can get serialport to work with green shoes which is a good start. Using X11, the green_shoes is just not as \"pretty\" as the native OSX capabilities that red shoes has. If anyone is working on getting serialport to run on red shoes it would be much appreciated. I do not have the ability to get it running but am definitely willing to help out in any way that I can.\nThanks for everyone's support,\nEd \n. Glad to hear it! Thanks again. \nWith serial communication, shoes could be a great tool for those making microcontroller integrated apps.\nIt looks here like it is definitely possible\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=017loHbDUCE\n. I contacted the owner of the YouTube video above and found out that he did not integrate serialport with shoes but used DRb to relay the serial signals to the shoes program.

Hi ashbb, I managed to package a solution and run it locally, but when i try to pass the executable to someone who hasn't shoes installed, it seems that it's retrieving an old version and not the one i built the app with (r1783), since they get the same error i got earlier...

I am having one other problem though, when i package my rb file more than once, it seems to be loading some kind of cache instead of my latest updated document....Any ideas on this one?\n. Basically i copyed the new r1783.exe, and renamed it to latest_shoes.exe, and afterwards repackaged, following my interpretation of your instructions. When i passed it over to someone without shoes installed (well, in the meantime they probably had the previous version of shoes), it kept sending the same rubygems version message. \nTo test this, i just uninstalled both version of shoes i had (1514 and 1783), and just tried and install from my shoes packaged with shoes file. \nWith this i got two issues : One is that when i run, it keeps forever and ever looking for httmultiparty : http://screencast.com/t/rZceaobE\nThe other is that this shoes version that got installed as a different package screen, that only allows to package to .shy files (is this a known issue of this shoes version? - instead of an inline browse button with all the packaging options, i get a popup to imediatly choose the file and then this screen : http://screencast.com/t/KXsvwCQNA) \n.

The problem is that when Ruby 1.9.3\nstarts up (initialized by Shoes) it looks for rbconfig.rb in the file\nsystem where the ruby was installed. Since Shoes has a copy of Ruby at a\ndifferent location all kinds of interesting error messages may occur. The\ncode in cache.rb that fixed things up barely worked with ruby 1.9.1 and\n1.9.2 but it does not work \"properly\" with 1.9.3. If you convince your ruby\nto be built --enable-load-relative - there is a option to rvm to (re)build\nit that way (and you should) then you get a different set of error messages\nbecause Ruby 1.9.3 is HARDCODED to look for rubygems.rb in lib/ruby/1.9.1\nand Shoes has ruby/lib/ This all happens before the first line of Shoes.rb\nis run and there is nothing cache.rb can do about later.\nI fixed both of those problems with my fork of Shoes.

    "pietrofxq": "So what's is being used these days to make an Shoes app turns into an .exe for windows?\n. That is sad. Shoes is awesome and if the packager were working it would be perfect. Will wait for the next version or for the updates, then. Thanks\n. You mean that all I need to make shoes work for windows is upload the .exe to an server? That should be pretty easy... I was thinking about wrapping ruby, shoes and the rb files with a standard packager, and make the installer install each of the programs, but that should be a pain indeed. Shoes is still the best option for creating tools for your personal use, though\n. Amazing! Any idea of when you are going to update the website with the installer? :D\n. A pre-compiled version of shoes 3.2 in the official website would be awesome. I'm excited to announce the news to my friends\n. ",
    "Phrogz": "I didn't realize that OS X could package for Windows. That sounds like a reasonable workaround.\nWhen packaging a folder of files, how do I instruct Shoes which is the main file? I have tried the GUI Packager on OS X and successfully created a .exe that runs on Windows, but it just spews a bunch of output about non-UTF-8 files:\nError in <unknonwn> line 0 | \u2026current date\u2026\nundefined local variable or method `\nError in <unknonwn> line 0 | \u2026current date\u2026\nnot a valid UTF-8 string: undefined local variable or method `\n(second message repeats \u2248infinitely)\n\nHowever, manually replacing all require with copy/pasting all files into the main and packaging just that file on OS X worked like a charm on Windows. Thank you for the workaround.\n. Possibly a duplicate of issue #142, though that issue claims that foregrounding is relevant. In my experience the app goes down on its own 95% of the time while in the background. (There were a handful of cases in 8 hours of interactive editing and launching where I was able to background it, make some changes, and then foreground it again without it crashing. Perhaps this was simply because I did so quickly enough, though I don't think so.)\n. Wow. My sympathies. (That's all I can offer, as I too have no expertise in that area.)\n. ",
    "BackOrder": "I am having the same problem on Windows 8.1 using Shoes 3.2.15.\n. It would be helpful if anyone who has investigated the issue shares his or her findings. We might be able to figure something out of the findings.\n. ccoupe, the CPU usage is the same as a normally running shoes. My app is more responsive and freeze considerably less since having the code handling events all in one place, no duplicate/multiple events on stacks and no overlay clickable regions. It will however hang when the app is in the background for a period of time (few to several minutes instead of relatively immediately).\n\n. Good news, Cecil. I figured out a way to consistently cause this issue while giving us more insight into it. Below you shall find a pair of smelly Shoes, handle with care.\nHow to cause the issue:\n1. Open Task Manager\n2. Run HangOn.rb with Shoes\n3. Select other windows to be on foreground, try to have a bit of the HangOn.rb window visible in order to see whether the animation is going on or not.\n4. Check Shoes in Process pane in Task Manager\n5. Hold CTRL + ALT for a while, release.\n6. You are now the proud owner of a Not Responding pair of Shoes.\nInteresting insight: HangOn.rb keeps logging timestamps in a file even when it is not responding.\nHangOn.rb\nruby\nShoes.app(width: 1200, height: 325, title: \"Hang on, shoes!\") do\n   @para = []\n   @log = File.open(\"#{Time.now.strftime(\"%H%M%S\")}.log\", \"w\")\n   15.times.each { |n|\n      @s = stack(width: 1200, height: 325, top: 0, left: 0) do\n         start do\n            @para << para(\"Burning shoes!\")\n            animate(rand(5) + 1) { \n               @para.each { |m| \n                  m.style(size: rand(50), stroke: \"#\" + rand(15).to_s(16) + rand(15).to_s(16) + rand(15).to_s(16))\n               }\n               if 0 == n\n                  @log.puts(Time.now.strftime(\"%H%M%S\"))\n                  @log.flush\n               end\n            }\n         end\n         #click { 500000.times { |i| i + rand(i) } }\n      end\n   }\n   @s.click { @para.each { |n| n.text = n.text.reverse } }\nend\n. This is also my observation. Process Explorer reports that both shoes.exe and msvcrt-ruby210.dll are running while the GUI is not responding. There are no distinguishable difference on CPU usage or cycles delta between a fully working Shoes app and a not responding one. See below (screenshot while HangOn.rb is not responding). Let me know if I can be of further assistance.\n\n. You're welcome, Cecil. It seems that fixing this issue will make a lot of people happy, myself included. Once again let me know if you need further assistance.\n. The correct link is http://shoes.mvmanila.com/public/shoes/beta/shoes-3.2.16-gtk2-32.exe\nThis version will still hang using the method I described earlier, holding CTRL+ALT for a while. It also takes one core around 90-100% at idle running shoes manual.\nDo you need stack traces on shoes.exe, msvcrt-ruby210.dll, etc?\n. I gave the msw version a try for good measure. It doesn't hang by holding CTRL+ALT for a while. Loading is slower than the gtk2 version but it is noticeably faster animating HangOn.rb and no core used at 100%. The msw overall performances is however decreasing using my application, more complex, when the number of images are increasing (noticeable at 40 and sluggish at 60+ images) whereas the gtk2 version slightly noticeable at 50.\n. Fix below is working.\nhttps://github.com/shoes/shoes/issues/110\nhttps://github.com/shoes/shoes/commit/4e7982ddcc8713298b6959804dab8d20111c0038\n. No pressure, simply reporting this bug since I encountered it while first uninstalling 3.2.15 to try Shoes 3.2.16. I know my way around windows but the Building Shoes on Windows wiki page is overly outdated.\n. Thanks, this is useful.\n. Known issue with the version of NSIS used.
