You shouldn't include nifty-generators in your config file. If you install the gem you should have access to the generators from any Rails project without doing this.\n. Rails 3 is working in version 0.4.0. The cucumber specs need more coverage and it isn't as modular as I would like, but it's a good start. Closing this. If you find specific Rails 3 bugs please open a separate ticket.\n. You need to gem install mocha and then set mocha up as the mocking library in the spec_helper.rb. I have had bad experiences with RSpec mocking so I prefer mocha (or RR). Also I don't care for how RSpec sets up the specs for scaffold, specifically how it handles view testing.\n. I believe this is working now in the rails3 branch. Please comment here if it's not working for you.\n. I'm assuming you added a column in the migration and want to re-generate the views to include this column? In that case you can run it with the --skip-model method and it will look at what columns are in the existing model to re-generate the views.\n\nscript/generate nifty_scaffold item --skip-model\n\nI don't know of an easier way. It's best to define all the columns in the initial run of the generator so you don't have to do this step.\n. bringing up to speed with Rails 3 beta 3 - closed by 3f58e7204ebd9844ffa9452eddaa550451e0e45b\n. adding xmlns to layout  element - closed by 8b90e3cb0c0e40139aaa23e68e401c26e71bdf5c\n. See if this is fixed now in the latest commit.\n. @nickslime06, that's strange, it looks like a syntax error in the internal Rails route_set.rb file. I also don't see mention of nifty generators in the stack trace.\nDo other built-in generators work such as rails g scaffold?\n. @plehoux, that is interesting. I wonder if there is any way I can resolve this. It seems like more of an issue with Thor, but if anyone has suggestions on how I can improve this let me know.\n. Any suggestions on how to fix this in the gem?\n. @mikbe, once you generate the nifty:layout once then it shouldn't be re-generated again, that's why it isn't included in the authentication/scaffold generators. However I'm open to ideas on how to make this more intuitive.\n. don't attempt to set thor options hash since it's frozen - closed by 9529eff7d2ad270024a8ff9699e37aa5cdda2ce9\n. fixing rendering of default title in Rails 3 nifty:layout - closed by bd12e3fe34d91a04608b45a8989827c34ab17a7e\n.

I think this is a duplicate of issue #35. Are you still getting this error with the latest version of nifty-generators (0.4.1)?\n. Thanks for confirming it's fixed.\n. The scaffold generator is intended to be used with resources, in which case the controller name should always be the pluralized version of that resource. If you're wanting to generate a home controller I suggest using the rails g controller Home index command instead.\n. This has been fixed in a recent commit. It now adds lib to autoload path automatically. I feel a little intrusive doing this but it's the easiest solution for now. I'm hoping this lib autoload business will be resolved in a future version of Rails 3.\n. replace integrate_views with render_views for rspec - closed by 30504513ea12d42ccb0d1b1c3062ba06017a60a6\n. Try running rails g nifty:layout which generates error_messages_helper.rb which provides these methods in Rails 3. I'll add this to the documentation.\n. That's strange, I'm not sure. Are they using the same exact version of Rails in both development and production? And you're certain the production version has the error_messages_helper file?\n. I hope to add support for Rails 3's generator modularity in the near future. However I'm still unsure of the best way to do it. If anyone has ideas that would be appreciated.\n. Thanks, this has been pulled in.\n. Duplicate of issue #48.\n. It looks like this problem happens when generating the \"ri\" documentation, which would make sense that it continues to work despite this error.\nI don't know enough about Windows to resolve this issue myself, does anyone know what the problem might be? Any ideas would be appreciated, thanks.\n. Closing because duplicate of #33.\n. As nhocki mentioned, does adding map.resources :products to your config/routes.rb file work for you? the scaffold generator should have done this automatically.\n. Did you ever get this issue resolved? If so I will close this ticket.\n. Sounds like a bug, I'll look into fixing it. Thanks for reporting.\n. automatically generate rspec tests when spec directory is used - closed by 7a512f69d0d3d02f1e4d09452d224ddb9f188d9f\n. The reason you get this error is because it will attempt to determine the User attributes based off the users table. There's no way to determine the attributes otherwise, so a rake db:migrate is necessary.\nI'm just curious, what behavior are you wanting? Devise generates a User model already and has an engine for managing the user registration pages, so I don't know if nifty:scaffold User is the right way to go.\n. @shmichael, there's no way for Nifty Generators to detect what columns are in the user without the table, this is why db:migrate is necessary. Closing this, but feel free to add a comment if you have a suggestion on how to handle this better.\n. Are you using Rails 2 or Rails 3? The escaping should be happening automatically in Rails 3. As for Rails 2, the escaping will need to happen when calling yield(:title) in the layout. The nifty_layout generator does this already.\nIs it not working for you?\n. That's very strange. I'll see if I can duplicate it on my end.\n. escaping page title in layout helper (thanks cbmeeks) - closed by d101f02b87559dd681049ed6c98b714fc7811b9f\n. switching to bcrypt for password encryption - closed by ebb5bf1f928108862297f8620fe99800b8b66d49\n. adding edit profile page to nifty:authentication - closed by 94404effdbb5de03ef7b10fee02045936851e6b9\n. Correct. This would just be for setting up the development environment.\n. Yes, it should work. After I get the Gemfile up it will be easier to ensure the environment is set up correctly.\n. The Shoulda tests (which require Rails 2.0.2) are for the Rails 2 version of the generators. I'm no longer developing those generators and instead focusing on Rails 3 which use the Cucumber features for testing.\n. adding Gemfile for setting up development environment - closed by 1ad410f65e666bb9348bd10561d9172fdbb10a12\n.

Closing because this is a duplication of #33. If you have any ideas on how to fix this please post there, thanks.\n. renaming edit_user to edit_current_user in nifty:authentication - closed by 30ffad96e1241525d19a63986b72156bcbec7a94\n. Thanks for your work on this. Although I think it would be best to have options which are at the root level work in all environments. This way one doesn't have to specify different environments at all if they don't want to.\n. Sorry for not getting back to you sooner on this, but can you clarify what you are looking for? Do you want more customization in the generator behavior? Can you provide an example of this?\n. If I'm understanding you correctly, Rails 3 already has this functionality. You can place your own templates in the lib/generators directory in your Rails app. For example if you want to customize the index template for the view you would place it in lib/generators/nifty/scaffold/templates/views/erb/index.html.erb in your Rails app.\nYou can do the same thing for any of the generator templates such as lib/generators/nifty/scaffold/templates/model.rb\nLet me know if that works for you.\n. Hmm, I'm not sure why it isn't working. I'll need to do more research to try to determine the problem.\n. removing extra white space when joining controller methods - closed by 6187df1a942a604594e7f36dc3c6781b3dc6b7b2\n. Thank you for your work on this Doug, sorry for not getting back to you sooner on this. It is something that I have been meaning to add to Nifty Generators but never got to it.\nOne thing I am unsure about is whether the model should have a namespace. I realize this is how the built in Rails scaffold generator works but imagine you are creating an administration interface for models. The models should often be at the base layer without a namespace.\nWhat do you think? I'm adding a discuss label to this to get some feedback from others as well.\nYour solution looks very clean and simpler than I had expected, nice job.\n. The only problem with the --skip-model option is that it will still reference the model name with the namespace in the controller. I prefer to have it only namespace the controller by default.\nMaybe add a --namespace-model boolean option to get the behavior you have now? If it's too much trouble you can leave off the option and just remove the namespace on the model since I think that is generally the behavior one wants.\n. Actually I take that back, it isn't necessary to have the model namespace in the controller since Ruby will find it in the same namespace by default.\nI would still like no model namespace as the default behavior though, so an option might still be necessary?\n. Thanks Douglas. Once you get this working I'll pull it in.\n. Thanks for your work on this. I will try to get it pulled in soon.\n. This is pulled in now and will be in a version release soon. Thanks Doug!\n. I am not planning on adding new features to the Rails 2 version of Nifty Generators. Partly because the tests are a mess. Doug, if you want to figure it out and make sure it's fully tested I will pull it in. But if you aren't up for it then don't worry.\n. @DouglasMeyer Thanks for your work on this, I'll get it pulled in soon.\n. @DouglasMeyer are you running the specs for the Rails 2 generator? Those are terribly broken. I am surprised you can get them to run at all actually, which is one reason I have not changed the Rails 2 generators much. I think I will discontinue Rails 2 support after this latest feature is in. Thanks for your work on it.\n. > Probably say something like \"Rails 2 supported up to version 0.4.6\" in the Readme.\nYeah, that is the plan. It is probably best to test Rails 2 additions manually for now, I don't trust the test suite that's in there for that. Once this release is done I will remove the Rails 2 support and only update it for minor bug fixes.\n. adding line before inserting gem into Gemfile - closed by 0688687ae10c70048936e9f93f60a1be733de455\n. Sorry for not getting back to you about this earlier. What command are you trying to execute? Be certain to use something like this.\n\nrails g nifty:scaffold\n\nYou shouldn't be running a command called nifty-generator.\n. Have you added gem \"nifty-generators\" to your Gemfile? And then run the bundle command to get it installed and included?\n. Actually it's the nifty_layout generator which is out of date. I have not been updating that one. What problems specifically are you seeing with the nifty:layout generated stylesheet?\n. Nevermind, I see your pull request with more detailed information. Thanks! Closing this one.\n. I believe Devise uses the term alert instead of error so the flash_alert should stay the same.\nAs for the errorExplanation vs error_explanation, I agree this should be addressed. I'll consider pulling that part in, thanks.\n. I think this is better left to the jquery-rails gem. The layout generated with nifty:layout should already be compatible (since it uses :defaults) and it is not much more work to add the jquery-rails gem to your Gemfile and run the generator command for that.\nIf you would like the Google CDN option I suggest seeing if they could add support for that in the jquery-rails gem.\n. Sorry for not addressing this sooner. The patch looks good and I'll work on getting it into the 0.5 release.\n. This is improved. Now it will show the USAGE documentation when the model name doesn't look valid.\n. Thanks, the pull request is in.\n. Awesome, thanks! I'll work on getting this pulled in.\n. That's strange. I'm unable to duplicate this issue, and the --haml option shouldn't effect the migration at all.\nWhat is the exact command you used when generating the scaffold? Perhaps there's a stray comma in there somewhere.\n. Thanks for reporting this, I'll get it fixed soon.\n. fixing instance instance variable in haml form for nifty:scaffold - closed by 405b83d29106504f2120928405c869c4f8049fce\n.

It's mentioned in the FAQ in the readme but I'll mark this for better documentation. Thanks for bringing it up.\n. Thanks, I'll mark this closed since there's a pull request.\n. Thanks, I'll work on getting this pulled in.\n. Hmm, if you tried running it in the console and you still get an error then the error probably isn't specific to Nifty Generators. Do you know if you are using the latest version of Nifty Generators? Version 0.4.5. Maybe it is picking up an old release.\nOther then that I'm not sure what the issue could be, I haven't seen it before and assume it is Windows specific. I'll mark this for help so hopefully others with Windows experience can chime in.\nI'm not sure why NetBeans is saying it's a Rails 2 generator. It includes both a Rails 2 and Rails 3 generator so maybe it just doesn't like that.\n. Datamapper isn't supported, sorry. I'll mark this as a possibility in the future, if someone wants to implement this please let me know.\n. The helper in NiftyGenerators has a translation like this: activerecord.errors.header and activerecord.errors.message so you'll need to adjust those in your en.yml file. Does setting those translations work?\nSo what your'e showing here is the previous translation keys Rails 2 used? Maybe they should be changed to match that.\n. Hmm, so it looks like it shouldn't go under the activerecord namespace. I'll consider changing this in the nifty:layout generator.\n. @JeanMertz thanks for looking into this issue. I hope to spend some time on it soon and find a good fix. If you do find a concrete solution feel free to submit a pull request.\n. Yeah, there were some bugs with the paths in older versions. Closing since the latest version is fixed.\n. Closing because this is duplicate of issue #33. Since I'm not on a Windows machine I can't debug this very well. If you or anyone has ideas on how to resolve this please let me know.\n. Which version of Nifty Generators and Rails are you using? This should be included, see issue #63.\n. Thanks! I had been wanting to get this fixed.\n. Also the name should be singular instead of plural (user_attribute). I'll mark these for better documentation.\n. This seems like a good idea, but I'm not sure of the best way to go about it. For now you're probably best forking the project and using that in the Gemfile. But if anyone has a better way to do this please comment here.\n. It should actually do content_for?(:title) ? yield(:title) : \"Untitled\" like the ERB version. Thanks for reporting this. Feel free to update this pull request.\n. Perfect thanks!\n. Try using nifty:scaffold instead of nifty_scaffold.\n. Rails 3 has a way to specify defaults like this, it would be great if nifty generators could listen for these defaults, I haven't built this into the gem yet though.\n. See the Configuring Generators docs for where to set default behavior.\n. This looks really great, thank you! We should probably make this dynamic so it only happens when one is using Rails 3.1 that way it doesn't break Rails 3.0. What do you think?\n. That should work, you can just check if it starts with \"3.0\". There may be better ways, haven't looked.\n. The problem isn't in the SessionsController, so changing that won't help. The web app shouldn't be sending a GET request to the /sessions/ route at all. Is this getting triggered when you submit the login form? Check the HTML generated and make sure the <form> tag method is \"post\". You may need to change the form_tag method to this. Does that work?\n. Passing :except=> [:login_url, :signup_url, :logout_url] will not work. Those are named routes you are passing. You need to specify the name of the controller action. Instead, add a skip_before_filter option to the SessionsController.\n``` ruby\napplication_controller.rb\nbefore_filter :login_required\nsessions_controller.rb\nskip_before_filter :login_required, :only => [:new, :create]\nusers_controller.rb\nskip_before_filter :login_required, :only => [:new, :create]\n```\nDoes that work for you?\n. It sounds like the JavaScript isn't working. Make sure the rails.js is loaded. This is usually done through a javascript_include_tag :defaults in your layout file.\n. Yes, I believe this is what SecurePassword does. This way we don't have to store a salt. I'll mark this for being added.\n. Hmmm, where are you seeing this error? In the gemspec it specifies this.\nruby\ns.required_rubygems_version = \">= 1.3.4\"\nSo your version should work.\n. respond_with is nice when you need to support multiple formats, but 90% of the time I do not need to do this. Many times you can get by with just adding a template with a different format and it will be picked up automatically. No need to use respond_with and respond_to. I prefer to keep the generated controller very slim which makes it easy to add what you need later.\n. Thanks for this. I had been meaning to add this. I am not yet certain if I want this in the next version bump or in a major release, but I hope to get it pulled in soon.\n. Thanks for reporting this. I think I kept it that way for backwards compatibility but I'll change this in the next major release.\n. Thanks for reporting this. Nifty Generators are not yet designed to work in 3.1. I hope to get to address this soon.\n. I18n increases the complexity of this project quite a bit. I probably won't add this into the gem, but feel free to fork the gem and make an i18n varient of it. Thanks for your work on this though.\n. ",

May be it is not DRY enough. Would it be better to modify directly the ErrorMessages helper ?\nThanks & regards\n.

    "craic": "What was I looking for? ... let me just fetch that from cache...\nSo with Rails3 regular scaffolding I can add my own erb scaffold templates for views in myapp/lib/templates/erb/scaffold. The regular scaffold generator will use those in preference to the Rails defaults.\nI would like to have the same functionality for controllers, models, tests where I can drop in custom templates into an individual Rails project.\nWhat I'm doing at the moment is modifying files in the nifty_generators gem templates directory (nifty-generators-0.4.2/lib/generators/nifty/scaffold/templates) so that I can create, for example, a custom model file. Now that works great - but it is system-wide and I really don't want to mess with the innards of gems.\nSo if nifty_generators looked in myapp/lib/templates first and used anything in there before using its defaults, that would be great.\nFor some parts of a MVC 'module' (not sure what the right term is for that entire bolus of code), such as the model .rb file itself, this just involves rendering a custom erb template. But for the tests, if I remember correctly, this was a little more involved - I had to modify some of the generator code. So there may not be a simple way to use templates for ALL the pieces of that need to be generated.\nHope that makes sense. \n... and thanks for all your good works for the community - very much appreciated\n--Rob Jones\n.

Say you already built a scaffold for Contacts, if you wanted to create an admin interface, you wouldn't create a new Admin::Contact model.\nI imagine this would be more common than a case where you wouldn't have an existing model and would not want it namespaced. Also; with this approach, you can skip the model and build it with another generator; with the other approach, if you wanted one, you wouldn't be able to generate a namespaced model.\nThanks again for going over this. Let me know what you think,\n-Doug\n. In the latest intermediate commit (https://github.com/DouglasMeyer/nifty-generators/commit/eb12c149f2d), I'm seeing a weird issue. It looks like, in the Admin::UserController, the User model isn't getting loaded.  Running the features should show this.  So it looks like we may have to explicitly reference Admin::User to get to the model, when using the --namespace-model option. Otherwise, it should be functional.\nPS: this is an intermediate commit, I'll finish it probably tomorrow and this commit will get blown-away.  I think I've made it a personal vendetta to get this finished before the new year :-)\n. Hey Ryan-\nit's working!!  https://github.com/DouglasMeyer/nifty-generators/commit/7dabe270bd\nAfter creating a new project, adding nifty generator to the Gemfile, and committing it in git; this command is a good test:\ngit checkout . && git clean -d -f && rails g nifty:scaffold Admin::User name:string && rails g nifty:layout -f && rails g nifty:scaffold Admin::User -f && bundle install && rake db:drop db:create db:migrate test\nAnd there is the --namespace-model counterpart:\ngit checkout . && git clean -d -f && rails g nifty:scaffold Admin::User name:string --namespace-model && rails g nifty:layout -f && rails g nifty:scaffold Admin::User -f --namespace-model && bundle install && rake db:drop db:create db:migrate test\nThanks for following the progress on this.\n-Doug\n. Your welcome. Glad I was able to help.\n. Hey Tom & Ryan-\nSorry, oversight my me. I assume nifty-generators still supports rails 2 to some extent, so I'll see if I can get that working as well.\nLet me know if that is not the case.\n-Doug\n. Hey Tom-\nI got a fix so nifty_scaffold with a nested resource works in Rails 2.\nRyan-\nDoing this because \"Rails 2\" is mentioned at the beginning of the Readme with no mention of it being deprecated.\nLet me know if it looks like anything is missing,\n-Doug\n. Hey Matija-\nThanks for catching that issue with generating rspec tests. I've updated my fork, and we'll see if Ryan has any more time to update github (it looks like he has been busy).\nI'm getting a few errors from running the tests, we may be using different versions of libraries. I would make sure you have the correct versions of the gems \"bundle install\" and are intentionally running them (\"bundle exec rake\" or \"bundle exec cucumber\").\nAs for saving to the \"articles_posts\" table, there is a flag \"--namespace-model\" that will do that and store the model Articles::Post in \"app/models/articles/post.rb\" (similar issues were discussed earlier in this pull request).\nHey Ryan-\nLooks like this pull-request is getting kind of lengthy. My fork should only contain these bug fixes and related refactorings. But there is a commit to include a development dependency.\nIt looks like a few people (myself included) are having issues with failing/broken tests. Could you make sure things are running correctly (bundle install && bundle exec rake)? If not, I could look into it.\nThanks,\n-Doug\n. @ryanb Oddly enough, I didn't have many issues running rvm use ruby-1.8.7-p334@rails2 ; ruby -I . test/test_nifty_scaffold_generator.rb. I was talking about the tests that get run through bundle exec rake.\nI think discontinuing support for rails 2 would immensely help with keeping the code clean.

It\n- also removes the prototype files\n- lets you chose the exact JQuery version, and add JQuery UI, interactively\n- pulls the latest JQuery-UJS driver at generator runtime\n- switches between minified and readable version dependent on rails env (by definition of default javascript includes)\nTherefore if this is pulled, please stick to the proposed default of disabled.\n. No, it downloads JQuery to public/javascripts, that is really an advantage of your feature. Maybe the ideas could be combined - s.th. like downloading JQuery uncompressed for development, but include jquery minified from CDN in production.\nWhat I'd really rethink is: do you really want to duplicate rails.js into nifty-generators? That would mean keeping track of all changes ...\n. AFAIS there are two \"issues\" with your request:\n- nifty:layout and nifty:scaffold are largely independent of each other (with a loose dependency via a helper method that scaffold uses, and that can be generated by layout)\n- rails does not provide a standard way for generators to store preferences in a project\nIf this will be addressed at all, I ask to make the implementation general, and also remember the options for the test framework.\n. cool. In such a case it is nice to be proven wrong. Can you give a pointer on how to store defaults with/for a generator (rails doc, or some starting point in the rails sources ...)?\n. Ah thanks Ryan. Never noticed that part.\n. This helper method is provided by nifty:layout (again). The templates already expect nifty:layout to be used by using the title message. Maybe the usage section of nifty:auth could simply mention the error_messages helper in addition to mentioning the title helper.\n. ",
