    "aheinze": "sorry, but I don't get your issue :-/ could you describe it more detailed?\n. I think the actual implementation is the way a tooltip has to behave ... on click modes are something for popovers.\n. this is probably because you load the fonts from http://getuikit.com/src/fonts/ e.g http://getuikit.com/src/fonts/fontawesome-webfont.eot\nwe'll investigate the issue\n. thanks for the translation effort but as you can understand, we can't merge this in the main repository.\n. yes, we know about the issue. it is the default browser behavior...we hope to find a solution for that.\n. I can't confirm this issue, which android version + phone/device do you use?\n. there should be no problems. :-)\n. maybe you didn't change anything in the customizer?\n. UIKit supports all modern browsers and IE>=9...we'll update our documentation\n. you don't need to add the variable to the general group...all@utility-* vars are already registred to the Utility Group...so maybe this is why it appears twice, because the variable is in two groups?\n{\n        \"label\": \"Utility\",\n        \"advanced\": true,\n        \"vars\": [\n            \"@utility-*\",\n            \"@theme_utility-*\"\n        ]\n    }\n. you activated the off-canvas menu and then resized the screen? right?\n. alright, then this is the expected behavior. off-canvas menus are fixing the position of the complete document when they are open. they are supposed for mobile devices (no resize possible) and let's be honest how often does anyone resize their desktop browser window while surfing?\n. sorry IE < 9 will not be supported\n. you can write a custom script that stores the state in localStorage/sessionStorage and trigger the offcanvas on page load\n. maybe this answers some questions: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/wiki/Create-a-custom-theme\n. sorry, codekit is a commercial and not \"standard\" software. thats why we won't merge this. but thanks for your efforts!\n. can you provide an example e.g. via jsfiddle - http://jsfiddle.net ?\n. I see...we'll work on fix for the next release\n. I think that it's a question of time when a community member contributes a dark theme :-)\n. should be possible now after this commit:\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/3cb1bad1e01bc349f39f2f1cc3b82033c619cd87\n. Hi , this is the way you should implement it:\n``` html\n\nMultiple Modal\nOpen Modal 1\n\n This is the modal 1\n\n\nModal 1\nOpen Modal 2\n\n\n This is the modal 2\n\n\nModal 2\nClose Modal 2\n\n\n```\n. done... you can now do: bower install uikit\n. which component? offcanvas, dropdown?\n. we're now using translateX for bar animation (off-canvas)\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/d9575a8c91a1536d688e27f3b96379a6785746b9\n. see https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/8\n. Hi,\nI'm sorry to say but the ProximaNova font family is commercial and that's why we can't ship the font with this public repository.\n. sorry, but custom select boxes are not planed in the near future.\n. you can already listen on events triggered by UIKit e.g.:\n$('[element-selector]').on(\"ui.switcher.show\", function(e, active) {\n        //...\n    });\n. docs are now updated:\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/2032b7e63e90514b6a917fa511ecdebf01145efb\n. already fixed: \nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/4240a92e9d40083ad246d44f3d0a34fad229720f\n. can you confirm this with the latest code base (14-08-2013)?\n. strange, could you please provide an example via e.g. jsfiddle? (http://jsfiddle.net)\n. Fixed. see:\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/7f7be9f28229d44ed69922dfc117db84ee5337d8\n. you still need an extra compile step for the live preview (customizer + tests). There isn't really an advantage for an auto-prefixer nowadays anymore....mainly for keyframe animation code\n. you can do this:\nvar modal = new $.UIkit.modal.Modal(\".modalSelector\");\nmodal.show()\n. yes, this should be considered.\n. sorry, this has nothing to do with any js event but with the :hover css behaviour. right now we can't do anything to solve this the right way for touch devices.\n. we're using font-awesome as our icon font and I'm sorry to say that the vimeo brand logo is not included.\nhttp://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/\n. @zslabs thanks for resolving\n. the links in the dropdown? \"#\" is just a placeholder for the demo, so an expected behavior\n. nope, columns must be the direct children of a .uk-grid element ... \"target\" is just an option for selecting elements where matchheight should applied on. columns are completely independent...\n. see https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/23\n. seems to be gone in safari 7.0\n. this is true, scrollspy works with elements existing in the dom on domready. to initialize dynamically added elements take this as a hint, taken from the UIkit source code:\n```\n// init code\njQuery(function($) {\n    $(\"[data-uk-scrollspy]\").each(function() {\n    var element = $(this);\n\n    if (!element.data(\"scrollspy\")) {\n        element.data(\"scrollspy\", new $.UIkit.scrollspy(element, $.UIkit.Utils.options(element.data(\"uk-scrollspy\"))));\n    }\n});\n\n});\n```\n. could you please provide more details? browser, os, ...\nthanks!\n. you can now also modify the default tooltip settings, so you don't have to add e.g. the animation option to every element:\n<script>\n    $.UIkit.tooltip.defaults.delay = 200;\n    $.UIkit.tooltip.defaults.animation = true;\n</script>\n. ios, android or windows mobile?\n. UIkit supports IE >=9 ... to fix the error above you can extend the Array object prototype e.g:\nif (!Array.prototype.forEach) {\n    Array.prototype.forEach = function (fn, scope) {\n        for (var i = 0, len = this.length; i < len; ++i) {\n            if (i in this) {\n                fn.call(scope, this[i], i, this);\n            }\n        }\n    };\n}\n. hi,\njust set the option msgMoreResults to false e.g.:\n<form class=\"uk-search\" data-uk-search=\"{source: '...', msgMoreResults:false}\">\n....\n</form>\n. tooltips are not supposed to be used in the offcanvas. offcanvas moves the whole document/page so the calculations for the tooltip fail to get the right position. we'll add this issue for a later review.\n. multiple modals are leading to bad user experience and are just bad practice...why not connect different modals between each other, like here: \nhttp://getuikit.com/tests/modal.html (Trigger new modal inside current modal)\n. yes, for some components this is true...the way to go is create custom directives which initialize the desired uikit components in the link callback\n. I would take a more general approach, e.g.:\n```\n(function($, UI){\nangular.module('uk', []);\nangular.module('uk').directive('ngUk', function () {\n\n    return {\n      restrict: 'A',\n      link: function (scope, elm, attrs) {\n\n         var component = UI[attrs[\"ngUk\"]];\n\n         if(component) {\n             if(!elm.data(attrs[\"ngUk\"])) {\n                 elm.data(attrs[\"ngUk\"], new component(elm, UI.Utils.options(attrs[\"ngUkOptions\"] || {}));\n             }\n         }\n      }\n    };\n});\n\n})(jQuery, jQuery.UIkit);\n```\nUsage:\n```\nangular.module(\"myapp\", [\"uk\"]);\n..\n```\nTHIS CODE IS NOT TESTED, JUST A WRITTEN DOWN IDEA*\n. [data-uk-nav] is missing\n. please checkout the wip branch https://github.com/uikit/uikit/tree/wip, this branch implements MutationObservers, so you don't have to trigger anything after manipulating the dom\n. did you try\n$(\"#grid-id\").data(\"grid-margin\").process();\nOr just\n$(window).trigger(\"resize\");\nafter adding items\n. Ah yes, I see...another try:\n```\nvar grid = $(\"#sys_grd\"),\n    blk  = '...',\n    gm   = grid.data(\"grid-margin\");\n$(blk).prependTo(grid);\ngm.columns = grid.children();\ngm.process();\n```\n. I'll experiment with MutationObservers to solve this issue in general for further releases\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver\n. please checkout the wip branch https://github.com/uikit/uikit/tree/wip, this branch implements MutationObservers, so you don't have to trigger anything after manipulating the dom\n. could you provide an url to see it in action?\n. thanks for the suggestion\n. sorry, we don't see a special need for range sliders. maybe you could use this one? http://jqueryui.com/slider/\n. maybe this snippet can solve your issue:\n$(document).on(\"uk.switcher.show\", \"[data-uk-tab]\", function(){\n    $(window).trigger(\"resize\");\n});\n. can't confirm this issue. could you please provide more details (browser etc) ?.\n. https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/a125c015938240f194c1e5519bd604b0ce12f59e\n. use data-uk-dropdown=\"{mode:'click'}\"\n. thanks for the efforts and suggestion but we have to come up with another solution for translations\n. it is already there https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/js/modal.js#L129\n. it is the action url provided by the search form\n<form class=\"uk-search\" action=\"MORELINK_URL\" method=\"post\" data-uk-search=\"{source:'searchresults.json'}\">\n    ...\n</form>\n. do you refer to data-uk-grid-match or data-uk-grid-margin?\n. you can already use delay: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/js/tooltip.js#L168\ndata-uk-tooltip=\"{pos:'bottom-left', delay:500}\"\n. IE9 doesn't support css keyframe animations, which we use for the demo of the scrollspy...so scrollspy is working, the animation classes not. \n. see https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/330321ea3aad631ca335510c6257550d3ae02f84\n. maybe you can provide it as add-on?\n. Correct markup:\n```\n\n\n<div class=\"uk-width-large-1-5 uk-width-medium-1-3\">\n    <div class=\"uk-panel uk-panel-box uk-panel-box-secondary\">\n        <p class=\"uk-text-bold\">corporate marketing</p>\n        <br /><span class=\"uk-icon-button uk-icon-facetime-video\"></span>\n        <p>promote your business or event with our high quality videos</p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"uk-width-large-1-5 uk-width-medium-1-3\">\n    <div class=\"uk-panel uk-panel-box uk-panel-box-secondary\">\n        <p class=\"uk-text-bold\">sports production</p>\n        <br /><span class=\"uk-icon-button uk-icon-trophy\"></span>\n        <p>professional video production of your sports highlights</p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"uk-width-large-1-5 uk-width-medium-1-3\">\n    <div class=\"uk-panel uk-panel-box uk-panel-box-secondary\">\n        <p class=\"uk-text-bold\">real estate</p>\n        <br /><span class=\"uk-icon-button uk-icon-map-marker\"></span>\n        <p>local HD virtual tours with online streaming video</p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"uk-width-large-1-5 uk-hidden-medium\"><div class=\"uk-panel\"></div></div>\n\n\n```\n. could you provide more details? browser, browserversion etc?\n. maybe via http://cdnjs.com?\n. I made a pull request for uikit - https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/pull/2189\n. http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/uikit/1.2.0/js/uikit.js\nhttp://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/uikit/1.2.0/js/uikit.min.js\nhttp://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/uikit/1.2.0/css/uikit.css\nhttp://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/uikit/1.2.0/css/uikit.min.css\n// themes\nhttp://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/uikit/1.2.0/css/uikit.almost-flat.css\nhttp://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/uikit/1.2.0/css/uikit.almost-flat.min.css\nhttp://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/uikit/1.2.0/css/uikit.gradient.css\nhttp://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/uikit/1.2.0/css/uikit.gradient.min.css\n. just don't use the responsive classes e.g. uk-width-1-3 instead of uk-width-medium-1-3 etc.\n. I can confirm the bug. but it seems to be a bug in the rendering engine of IE9.\n.uk-height-1-1 .uk-form legend:after { content: none; }\nseems to solve the crash issue but you'll lose the border under the legend.\n. we are aware of the extends function but had some reasons to stick with less 1.3 in the past...we already switched to less 1.5.1 in the wip branch.\n. first of all thank you @srsgores for your effort to contribute to UIkit. I see and understand your arguments for IE <9 support...but we follow another approach. UIkit will always try to embrace and implement the best and latest techniques to build great interfaces BUT with a graceful degradation (whenever possible) for older browsers. \nIf an element just appears on mouseover without an animation or has just a plain background color without a gradient, then it is ok as long the user gets his information that he's looking for on your site. And believe me when I say that IE < 9 support is not that important as supporting all current mobile devices (windows phone etc).\nthank you again for your work and code but we have a different vision for UIkit. but hey, it is all open source and we love to see forks and any kind of solution based on UIkit!\nHave a great weekend!\n. sorry this is not possible. the scroll event is also firing, when the animation scrolls the page up and down.\n. we know, this is a strange browser behavior when setting the document to position:fixed. we'll try to find a solution.\n. have a look at the wip branch https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/74f60dc92141b7733aaf71294af9ae86d8380b77\n. so you can use simplified js json objects as config:\n```\n// will raise error with .data()\n \n// .data() requires strict json\n\n```\n. so you want to access the settings via data() after initialization? \nwhy not $(element).data(\"tab\").options ?\n. yepp, because you can initialize a tab component in two ways. with your code you still create everytime a js object. even when it does nothing. this polutes the memory.\n. sorry, but I think it is still a cleaner approach.\n. IE < 10 doesn't support keyframe based animations. a fallback for IE < 10:\n<!--[if IE]>\n<style>\n    [data-uk-scrollspy*='uk-animation-'] { opacity: 1; }\n</style>\n<![endif]-->\n. Hi! We don't see any use case where you would use a warning button...that's why we didn't implement it.\n. this does already work...\n. you can already do that. e.g.:\n<a href=\"#bottom\" class=\"uk-button\" data-uk-smooth-scroll=\"{offset:100}\">Go Down!</a>\n. we don't do this, just because we don't want to conflict wit other js/css libs/components ... but should'nt break if you set the border-box property to border-box for all elements.\n. strange, sorry can't confirm this.\n. sorry, this is not possible in the way the current off-canvas is implemented\n. ist is on our todolist :-)\n. we want to keep add-ons small and simple. for more complex features (multiple transitions effects,...) you need more time to maintain and fix things. but hey, we welcome any add-on code somebody provides. so, feel free to commit some code.\n. I cannot verify this. could you please give more details (firefox version, os)?\n. maybe some installed plugins causes the issue?\n. hi please download and build current uikit status. this issue is already fixed : https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/3f3be5dd7d36cf5b7a416096c49acab35ac9b847\n. thanks! we'll fix it!\n. done https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/07bd599200ec00e6503283a797fa8369ad04799a\n. no, this by design...the dist folder in the root is only for official releases.\n. sorry for the late answer. we'll release a minor release soon!\n. this issue should be fixed now\n. Thanks! We'll look into that after the christmas holidays.\n. thanks for the suggestion, we'll keep it in mind for future releases.\n. could you provide a code example (for example via jsfiddle)\n. No it is not working at the moment but we'll keep it in mind for future releases.\n. thanks!\n. do you use it with the data-uk-button attribute?\n. $('textarea[data-uk-markdownarea]').on(\"markdownarea-update\", function(){\n    console.log( $(this).data(\"markdownarea\").preview.html() );\n});\n. thanks, we'll fix it\n. fixed in 2.4.0\n. it is not hard coded, you can apply your own i18n settings like this:\n$.extend($.UIkit.datepicker.defaults, {\n        weekstart: 1,\n        i18n: {\n            months        : [...],\n            weekdays      : [...]\n        },\n        format: \"...\"\n});\n. it does work: http://jsfiddle.net/EXSuj/2/\n. feel invited to write an addon :-)\n. I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I don't think this will happen. btw you can also write syntax highlighted code in the markdownarea.\n. this won't work, scrollspy.js depends on core.js. try to add core.js then scrollspy.js\n. http://jsfiddle.net/EXSuj/21/\n. didi\n you include the markdownarea plugin?\n. because the older browsers don't support dom Mutationobservers. add the following line after any dom manipulation to support  also the older browsers:\nif(!$.UIkit.support.mutationobserver) $(document).trigger(\"uk-domready\");\n. great!\n. please contact the template developer (http://themeforest.net/user/dhsign) we don't provide support for products from third party developers.\n. this is already impemented\ndata-uk-tooltip=\"{delay:400}\"\nthe delay param is always in ms.\n. $(\".myclass\").each(function(e) {\n    var tip = new $.UIkit.tooltip(this, { /*..options..*/});\n});\n. it is via post and \"search\" is the default query parameter.\n. could you please create a jsfiddle?\n. there is an official Sass release since UIkit 2.11.\n. please use data-uk-switcher instead of data-uk-tab, with the same settings. example: http://jsfiddle.net/bHCfU/2/\n. $.UIkit.smoothScroll.defaults.offset = 65;\n. did you already try:\n<div class=\"uk-grid\" data-uk-grid-margin data-uk-grid-match>\n    ...\n</div>\n. http://jsfiddle.net/Ut2HH/2/\n. for better understanding http://jsfiddle.net/Ut2HH/3/\n. this is a question you should ask here: http://www.yootheme.com/support\n. I updated the bower.json\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/f6f8d2c1423a8ec84eae82337bc3bdd7bfe83731\n. uikit depends on jQuery >= 1.8. could you be more detailed?\n. uikit should work with any jQuery version >= 1.8\n. Notify allows messages with html markup...it is the developers responsibility what he passes to the notify function + sanitizing the message\n. hi,\nwe don't plan a multilevel menu. I think a custom add-on solution is the the best approach here.\n. sorry but this is how we want the timepicker to behave.\n. add .uk-offcanvas-close to the items which should close the offcanvas\n. is now fixed with this commit https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/2ae342212fb8e23a02326b4a5c38bacd2757817a\n. sorry, no there is no such official addon.\n. do you use a rtl version of uikit?\n. the offcanvas test with rtl seems to work for me: http://getuikit.com/src/tests/offcanvas.html\n. scrollspy works in IE9...just don't use the animation classes if you also target IE9\n. Thanks for the hint!\n. Some good stuff is on the way ;-)\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/158f524c5812b87ca957d210ed35aee3c06db8b7\n. I don't see another solution right now. we use a debounced event approach, otherwise the site could freeze, if we do a match on every change. I think this would be more worse\n. this is not a bug, but default browser behavior.\n. Ah sorry, I misunderstood the issue you described. your issue is fixed and will be included in the next release.\n. did you clear your browser cache?\n. this is already fixed here: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/2ae342212fb8e23a02326b4a5c38bacd2757817a\n. do you use the latest master? don't use the current dist files in the dist folder. run grunt to have fresh dist files and don't forget to clear browser cache.\n. btw. there is a check before preventDefault if it's an anchor or not.\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/js/modal.js#L223-L225\n. yepp, then you're right. the 2.4.0 release has the issue, but it is already fixed for the next release\n. very soon ;-)\n. Yes, you're right....but this just simulates an ajax call. If you query a real server, the server should already return a filtered result depending on the search query.\n. sorry, but the sticky at the moment only handles top oriented positions\n. everything works fine on small screens with the current setup.\n. sorry, there's no workaround yet.\n. you can't match the heights of switcher panels, because they're set to display:none. so the height calculation fails.\n. Try this:\n```\nvar modal = new $.UIkit.modal.Modal(\"#modal\", {keyboard:false, bgcose:fale});\nmodal.show();\n```\n. as described in the docs, sending files one by one is the default ( single = true ). Imagine you upload 5 files at once, it is very possible that you get problems with the max file upload size. sending on by one reduces the amount of data sending at once. but it is as an option, turn it of if you like :-)\n. does this bug still exists? which UIkit version do/did you use?\n. looks good, I think you can leave the 'end' parameter.\n. @Torcado is right.\n. firefox?\n. sorry no, html tags are allowed in markdown by spec\n. which phone do you use?\n. we updated offcanvas in the upcoming release to be more smoother\n. thanks for you code, I'll merged it with the following commit:\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/6c752498b0187b2fad1f64ec11c70458e777c3b6\n. not yet, but I'll add this issue on our todo list.\n. could you please give more details (browser, version etc.?)\n. Firefox 12!? sorry, but firefox is currently on version 29. we won't support such old versions.\n. is the footer fixed (position:fixed) ?\n. should be fixed with the upcoming release\n. sorry I can't reproduce this issue. could you please create a fiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) ?\n. the easiest way would be to trigger the click event on the a element:\n$('.selector > a').trigger('click')\n. hi it depends on the source. if you have an array as data source then the autocompleter tries to filter the values:\n<input name=\"city\" data-uk-autocomplete=\"{source:[{value:'Hamburg'},{value:'New York'},{value:'Moscow'},{value:'Amsterdam'}]}\">\nif you query the server, then the autocompleter suppose that the results are already filtered on the server side based on the query parameter.\nwe'll improve the docs.\n. I would prevent styling column divs (.uk-grid > uk-width-*). why don't you wrap the autocompleter in its own div?\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/y3Ft8/3/\n. we know and flexbox is awesome, but it is way to early to drop ie9 support\n. what about http://jsfiddle.net/8y48q/5/\n. will be fixed in the next release\n. the callback function is meant for the special cases when you initialize an autocomplete manually via javascript. we don't want to support this in the data attribute \n. fixed https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/03731e0a227aa9592ec7ef4b0e251a443f0553f0\n. ``` javascript\n// Notice\nif(!localStorage['notice.accepted']){\nvar msg = $.UIkit.notify(\"Message...\", {status: 'info', timeout: 0, pos:'bottom-right'});\n\nmsg.element.on('click', function() {\n    localStorage['notice.accepted'] = true;\n});\n\n};\n```\n. you can also trigger click on the document\n$(document).trigger('click')\n. a reworked editor will be  in the upcoming release\n. ``` javascript\nvar msg = new $.UIkit.notify.message({message: cookielaw, status: 'info', timeout: 0, pos:'bottom-right'});\nmsg.element.find('>.uk-close').remove();\nmsg.show();\n```\n. the uk-close is just a dummy. the message should always close when you click on it. \n. you can just link to an php file: \ndata-uk-search=\"{flipDropdown:true, source: 'path/to/search.php'}\"\nin search.php just get the query parameter with $_REQUEST['search'] do your server side filtering and return your results in json\n. the initial modal object creation is bound to modal in the dom. so every modal trigger uses the initiated modal object. why do you want to open the same modal with different options?\n. please try to build the switcher with a div construct or maybe wait for the next release and try the new sortable add-on\n. hi zach,\nsetting border-box on all elements seems to be a great idea at first glance, and we already thought about it. but let me tell you that you'll run into some problems when you try to use some 2rd party components / scripts which don't assume that everything is border boxed (e.g. codemirror etc). keeping UIkits current strategy makes it also way more easy to inject UIkit in already existing codebases without messing up existing css rules (e.g. use UIkit as the css framework for your next Wordpress plugin in the backend).\n. should be fixed with the upcoming 2.7 release\n. as @davidchase already explained, disabled controls don't trigger any events. on solution might be, that you wrap your button in a span/div and give that element the tooltip.\n. then don't use anchors as the overlay area, and put action links in the overlay area, to support dektop + touch devices\n. the upload add-on works with all browsers supporting the new xhr standard - http://caniuse.com/#feat=xhr2 (IE >= 10)\n. sure\n. you can see an example here: http://getuikit.com/src/tests/addons/upload.html\n. This is already fixed : https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/822eb152eb544cfbb6101fe8606bec1241cb16e9\n. sorry this is not possible.\n. why reload the grunt file?\n. sorry, but I can't confirm this issue. could you please provide an url where this happens (jsfiddle?).\nthanks!\n. or just add the type=\"button\" attribute to prevent form submissions\nhtml\n<button type=\"button\">...</button>\n. thank you for the suggestion, but I think this should be a community effort as we don't have the resources right now to implement uikit for 3rd party tools.\n. please try:\nhtml\n<img src=\"img/dashboard.png\" alt=\"dashboard impianti fotovoltaici\" title=\"dashboard impianti fotovoltaici\" data-uk-scrollspy=\"{cls:'uk-animation-slide-left', delay:200, repeat: true}\" >\nyou already added uk-animation-slide-left, uk-scrollspy-init-inview, uk-scrollspy-inview which should be handled by the scrollspy js.\n. it seems that you are searching for the edge cases ;) I'll look into that\n. @zslabs it was fixed when I tested it ... I'll test it again tomorrow!\n. @zslabs works for me ... maybe you can update your codepen with the latest UIkit release\n. \"drag & drop the slider\" .. do you mean the scrollbar within the dropdown?\n. thanks, then it seems to be a windows related issue, I'll look into the issue\n. how common is it that you resize the window when you're entering the date?\n. sorry but i don't get your issue, could you describe it more detailed, maybe with a code example?\n. sorry but i don't get your issue, could you describe it more detailed, maybe with a code example?\n. this should be fixed in the current branch.\n. this should be fixed in the current branch.\n. the easiest way would be to add  the uk-animation classes to the switcher content container elements which will be triggered when they get the uk-active class.\n. the easiest way would be to add  the uk-animation classes to the switcher content container elements which will be triggered when they get the uk-active class.\n. we plan to release an accordion addon in one of the next releases\n. we plan to release an accordion addon in one of the next releases\n. the problem is, that there is no safe way to detect touch on desktop pc's. we use the following approach:\njavascript\nUI.support.touch  = (\n    ('ontouchstart' in window && navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase().match(/mobile|tablet/)) ||\n    (global.DocumentTouch && document instanceof global.DocumentTouch)  ||\n    (global.navigator['msPointerEnabled'] && global.navigator['msMaxTouchPoints'] > 0) || //IE 10\n    (global.navigator['pointerEnabled'] && global.navigator['maxTouchPoints'] > 0) || //IE >=11\n    false\n);\nif you have any hint, please let us know :-)\n. the problem is, that there is no safe way to detect touch on desktop pc's. we use the following approach:\njavascript\nUI.support.touch  = (\n    ('ontouchstart' in window && navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase().match(/mobile|tablet/)) ||\n    (global.DocumentTouch && document instanceof global.DocumentTouch)  ||\n    (global.navigator['msPointerEnabled'] && global.navigator['msMaxTouchPoints'] > 0) || //IE 10\n    (global.navigator['pointerEnabled'] && global.navigator['maxTouchPoints'] > 0) || //IE >=11\n    false\n);\nif you have any hint, please let us know :-)\n. @drodil is right. the filtering needs to be done on the server side.\n. @drodil is right. the filtering needs to be done on the server side.\n. thank you, we'll consider it for UIkit 3..0\n. set a value in the localStorage or sessionStorage and check that on the next pageload before showing the modal.\n. closed because of duplication\n. thank you for the suggestion! we'll discuss this intern for the next major release\n. you can already do that in the customizer + tests\n. thanks for the suggestion, we'll keep it in mind :-)\n. you can listen now on uk.dropped\n$('#element').on('uk.dropped', function(e, files){ ... });\n. thanks for your suggestion, we'll consider it for UIkit 3.0\n. windows mobile issue, without a workaround yet...let's hope for the next windows mobile update.\n. could you please try to use the un-minified version, so we can get a direct code hint?\n. please check the error against the actual uikit version. with the latest version it is not reproducible.\n. sorry, but this is not intended to work this way. we'll re-think the whole button  concept for UIkit 3.0.\n. @zslabs why don't you initialize the sticky manually via js after checking the screen size? e.g.:\n``` javascript\nif (window.innerWidth > 640) {\n    $.UIkit.sticky('#myelement', {top: 10});\n}\n```\n. added breakpoint option:\n// min width 640px\ndata-uk-sticky=\"{media: 640}\"\nor\n// match media string\ndata-uk-sticky=\"{media: '(min-width: 640px) and (orientation: landscape)'}\"\n. yepp, that's the way it works :-)\n. should be fixed with that commit: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/fb7318f818d4c05073451a4e5d84f0cae0be07f0\nplease build the current master.\n. add data attributes (like data-id) to the li's and whenever you need, serialize them, e.g:\njavascript\n$(\"#mynestable\").data(\"nestable\").serialize();\n. this is a custom need and can be handled pretty easy wit custom js (onchange, ...). but we'll keep on eye on that, thanks for the suggestion.\n. see https://github.com/uikit/uikit/pull/480\n. thanks, but I think this is too much overhead. if someone can edit/submit html markup, then it's also possible to use script tags, which has the same effect. so I think this should be the responsibility of the site/app owner to sanitize the data.\n. the slidenav add-on is just a css extension, you can use for your own markup/solution. it has no \"actions\"\n. we're already working on something.... ;-)\n. @connectr https://github.com/uikit/uikit/tree/feature/slideset ;-)\n. @zslabs is right, just run grunt to build UIkit and grunt watch if you want to work on files within the UIkit folder, so UIkit will always be build whenever you modify/save a JS or LESS file.\n. just remove the following line\n@import \"addons/form-advanced.less\";\nin /src/less/uikit-addons.less\n. could you provide an example, where I can investigate the issue?\n. could you provide an example on jsfiddle?\n. I updated the fiddle:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/qt2aA/1/\n. same as https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/462\n. overlays should work with touch devices since UIkit 2.7\n. you can do so by setting the following css properies on .uk-offcanvas:\ncss\n.uk-offcanvas { pointer-events: none; } /* click through overlay */\nor\ncss\n.uk-offcanvas { right: auto; } /* same width as offcanvas-bar */\nProblem: you have to implement the offcanvas closing yourself ...\n. we started to extend the docs to cover all js functionality\n. you have to initiate the autocomplete manually e.g.\n``` javascript\nvar autocomplete = $.UIkit.autocomplete($('#element'), {\n'source': function(release) {\n\n    var data = [];\n\n    // fill the data array e.g. via ajax\n\n    $.getJSON('/filterurl', { q: this.input.val() }, function(data) {\n        if (data.cod == 200) {\n            release(data.list);\n        } else {\n            release([]);\n        }\n    });\n}\n\n});\n```\n. just add uk-hover class to the element with the uk-overlay class\n. thank you for the suggestion, we'll discuss this!\n. try \njavascript\n$(\"#switcherelement\").data(\"switcher\").show(index)\n. why don't just use the value=\"\" attribute of your input field for a default value?\n. UIkit works very well with jQuery 2.x ... how do you load jQuery? Via require js?\n. I just upgraded jQuery to 2.1.1 and have no issues:\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/811ca298e3c9b34fe1531507fe6a11ad0d0dd6af\n. this is an edge case and creates a dependency between a core component and an add-on...we'll keep it in mind, thanks for the hint.\n. Thanks for the suggestion, we'll consider it for the UIkit 3.0 release\n. see https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/456\n. will be available soon\n. should be fixed with this commit:\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/fb7318f818d4c05073451a4e5d84f0cae0be07f0\n. as described in http://www.getuikit.com/docs/addons_upload.html you vae the params option to add additional parameters. e.g.:\n``` javascript\nvar settings = {\n    ...\n    \"params\": {\"token\": ourtoken}\n};\n$.UIkit.uploadSelect($(\"#upload-select\"), settings);\n```\n. since this commit ( https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/91f30e2db667eae2d99181e6cd5296381f9f7d64 ) you can also utilize the xhr object:\njavascript\nvar settings = {\n    ...\n    \"beforeSend\": function(xhr) {\n        xhr.setRequestHeader(...);\n    }\n};\n. thanks zach, but please create a pull request with only changed source files (js, less)\n. please create a jsfiddle to better explore your issue\n. as @robertotremonti mentioned, you need to do some work on the server side to complete the upload process\n. the action parameter is the target url\n. please build UIkit from the current branch, then this works:\nhtml\n<div class=\"uk-form-icon\" data-uk-timepicker>\n    <i class=\"uk-icon-clock-o\"></i>\n    <input type=\"text\">\n</div>\n. hi zach,\nthis should be fixed in the current branch.\n. closed because of duplication\n. the template script must be within the autocomplete root element. e.g:\nhtml\n<div class=\"uk-autocomplete uk-form\" data-uk-autocomplete=\"{source:'autocomplete.json'}\">\n    <input type=\"text\">\n    <script type=\"text/autocomplete\">\n        <ul class=\"uk-nav uk-nav-autocomplete uk-autocomplete-results\">\n            {{~items}}\n            <li data-value=\"{{ $item.value }}\">\n                <a>\n                    {{ $item.title }}\n                    <div>{{{ $item.text }}}</div>\n                </a>\n            </li>\n            {{/items}}\n        </ul>\n    </script>\n</div>\n. thanks for the suggestion, we'll discuss this intern\n. this should be fixed in the current branch and will be available in the next release.\n. thanks for the suggestion, we'll discuss this intern\n. could you provide an url to inspect the issue?\n. try to add this to your css:\ncss\n.uk-modal-page, .uk-modal-page body {\n     height: auto;\n}\n. hi, this is the default markdown parsing behavior (by marked js) to avoid that you can also use ``` for code blocks. but thanks for the hint, we'll keep an eye on that.\n. hi zach,\nthanks for the suggestion, but I think parallax is a trend that's already fades away and will be pretty soon outdated. But we'll keep it on the radar. thanks again for the suggestion!\n. did you also include the uikit js?\n. we'll check that...thanks!\n. hi zach,\nduring the \"W.I.P.\" phase we only commit changes made to the source files, the dist folder on the repo always contains the latest release. Also committing the dist files every time on any change would bloat the the repo very fast and you'll have to clone a big monster.\nIn git you can add only certain files to a commit, a git gui like sourcetree simplifies this a lot.\nBut we'll test some workflows to make it more comfortable.\n. thank you for the suggestion! we'll discuss this intern for the next major release\n. this brings back the problem of using tooltips in off-canvas menus ... it seems it must be a combination of the body offset and html offset \n. fixed with this commit: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/5fdcf44e2dbd5ddcf8b587b26590e8b42a4972b7\n. the jQuery dependency is set to >= 1.9 now.\n. just think outside the box and use what is already available. ;-)\ndata-uk-dropdown=\"{justify: '.uk-touch body'}\"\nthis only justifies on touch devices, utilizing the auto added uk-touch class to the html root element. just add your own classes on dom-ready. hope this helps.\n. as I already a solution on google plus:\nthis is not a bug, but a z-index issue, try:\n.uk-sticky .uk-navbar-attached { z-index: 1000;}\ufeff\n. sorry, this is not planned.\n. please try this (latest UIkit dev version):\nhtml\n<div class=\"uk-form-icon\" data-uk-timepicker>\n    <i class=\"uk-icon-clock-o\"></i>\n    <input type=\"text\" name=\"start\" value=\"...\">\n</div>\n. you're right. both are decoupled from each other. we keep an eye on that that issue\n. could you please post the markup you use?\n. can't confirm without response.\n. $('select[name='sbankacct']').val('Axis Bank');\n. please try:\n$(function(){\n    $(\"select[name='sbankacct']\").val('Axis Bank');\n});\n. sorry but you're navbar markup looks pretty strange...the dropdowns are working fin, as you can see here: http://jsfiddle.net/Lv46b9eu/ ... please check your markup\n. as I mentioned here https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/567#issuecomment-52283894  this a topic for UIkit 3.0. you can already customize the icon less with a custom theme. just include you own icon.less instead the one from UIkit.\n. This will be reworked in UIkit 3.0\n. this is a question of taste...thanks for the suggestion, we'll discuss this intern.\n. thank you for the suggestion! we'll discuss this intern for the next major release\n.  nestable-start and nestable-stop, sortable-start and sortable-stop\n. This will be reworked in UIkit 3.0.\n. data-uk-button triggers a change event, you can hook on:\njavascript\n$('[data-uk-button]').on('change', function(){\n   ...\n});\n. I think this is a z-Index issue. Please try to increase the z-index of the dropdowns parent container. \n. thank you for the suggestion, we already re-thinking the whole icon concept for UIkit 3.0\n. @zslabs looks great :+1: \n. this would be pretty hard to achieve, tootips is a core component. take a look at the grunt build file, maybe this helps: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L126\n. this is warp related issue. please post this issue here: http://yootheme.com/support\n. there is no recommended site structure. it always depends on the project where you use UIkit and what is recommended as best practice within the parent project.\n. Closed because of no feedback.\n. $('textarea[name=\"desc\"]').data(\"htmleditor\").editor.setValue(descripton);\n. thanks, should be fixed now!\n. sorry, but I can't confirm this. could you post your overlay markup?\n. ;-)\n. you can listen to the following events:\nnestable-start, nestable-move, nestable-stop\nsortable-start, sortable-change, sortable-stop\n. closed because of duplicate request\n. the wrapper is created to prevent page jumping when the sticky element gets position fixed. this is an edge case and needs a custom solution\n. Fixed https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/1617f4d19c546e8908051e5a141d29b9a42f0fc9\n. Hope this helps:\n``` javascript\nvar ac = $.UIkit.autocomplete('#element', {\n    source: function(release) {\n        var data = [];\n    // custom code to collect data\n\n    release(data);\n}\n\n});\n```\n. this isn't really a bug. nothing breaks. offcanvas are for meant for mobiles where resizing is not possible....and let's be honest, how often do you resize your browser window while you're browsing the web ;-)\n. this seems to be a problem with the editor you use which strips out the scrollspy settings.\n. Could you please provide a JSFiddle?\n. closed because of missing feedback\n. sorry, but this is isn't planned.\n. this issue should be gone since the 2.9.0 release.\n. please create a jsfiddle to better explore your issue\n. thanks!\n. try this:\nhtml\n{{#$item.transaction_id}}\n<a href=\"/shop/orders/{{ $item.id }}\" class=\"ui-anchor-container\">\n    <span class=\"ui-item-container\">Order #{{ $item.id }}</span>\n    <span>{{ $item.title }}. {{ $item.first_name }} {{ $item.last_name }} - &pound;{{ $item.amount }}</span>\n</a>\n{{/end}}\n{{^$item.transaction_id}}\n<a href=\"/shop/edit/{{ $item.slug }}\" class=\"ui-anchor-container\">\n    <img src=\"{{ $item.image_url_tiny }}\" class=\"tiny-img\"/>\n    <span class=\"uk-text-small\">{{ $item.name }}</span>\n</a>\n{{/end}}\n. we use the json file, so the user has an example how the server response should look like. thanks for the suggestion, we'll discuss this intern.\n. we've decided that the button isn't really needed.\n. as @malles already mentioned, just avoid the breakpoint classes (e.g. uk-width-medium-*)\n. thanks for the report, this seems to be a theme related issue. please consult the yootheme support forum for a solution. thanks!\n. there is no \"disable action\" but you can give them a class which sets the handles to pointer-events: none as a workaround\n. @luetn right :-)\n. please try:\n$.UIkit.Utils.checkDisplay(myrootelement)\nsource: \nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/js/core.js#L183-L185\n. @jbenesch please look here: http://getuikit.com/docs/documentation_javascript.html#dom-observe\n. please look here: http://getuikit.com/docs/documentation_javascript.html#dom-observe\n. thanks for the suggestion, this will be a topic for UIkit 3.0\n. @malles is right you have to listen on document\n. thanks, but the dist folder should be rebuild by any developer when testing. official builds can be found here: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/releases\n. this will be reworked in UIkit 3.0\n. please add uk-img-preserve to your map container divs. e.g.:\nhtml\n<div class=\"uk-img-preserve\" id=\"map-canvas\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 300px\"></div>\n. maybe your embed code is wrong, I have no issues with the following embed code:\n<iframe data-uk-cover=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://maps.google.de/maps?hl=de&q=Pariser Platz, 10117 Berlin+(Brandenburger Tor)&ie=UTF8&t=&z=17&iwloc=B&output=embed\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n. UIkit doesn't provide any form validation functionality.\n. yes, but UIkit has no additional \"Number Input component\", we validate the date input just to re-parse it correctly on show.\n. I updated the jsfiddle with a working example : http://jsfiddle.net/y39v79nq/2/ .\n. yes correct, if autocomplete is initialized via js, you don't need the data-uk-autocomplete attribute.\n. sorry, but this is a support question and not a UIkit issue. Please ask these kind of questions on our Google+ Community site.\n. could you please provide an example, e.g via jsfiddle.net?\n. closed because of no feedback.\n. could you be more detailed, please?\n. sorry no, you need to solve this with custom code\n. thanks for your suggestion, we'll re-evaluate this for UIkit 3.0.\n. sorry, I'm not that familiar with silex... maybe you should investigate $_FILES. This is an extern framework related issue.\n. just set a negative top offset parameter:\ndata-uk-sticky=\"{top:-50}\"\n. which mobile device do you use? (android/iphone/ windows mobile? version etc)\n. closed because of no feedback.\n. agree and done: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/7127a4d9032675007b4314248c120bf7fbff1c48 ;-)\n. just add data-uk-check-display to the tab element ... will be available in UIkit >=2.11\n. this will be more customizable in the next release.\n. Hi, we had this also in mind some time ago, but this creates issues with actual js frameworks, which relate on hash for url routing. so thank you for your suggestion, but I don't think that this will make it in a future release.\n. Did you enable compile less on each request? this is a YOOtheme related question could you please post this in http://yootheme.com/support? thanks!\n. I don't have any issues with angular..could you provide an example e.g. jsfiddle.net?\n. so components/tabs don't work on loaded views? is that your problem?\n. sorry, but Android < 4.4 don't support woff ... so we can't remove the other font files yet.\n. thank you for contributing :+1: \n. could you please describe you problem more detailed?\n. as @malles already mentioned, we recommend using buttons <button></button>\n. UIkit registers itself also with $.fn.uk as a jQuery plugin, so you you're able to do the following:\n$(element).uk('datepicker', {/* options */});\n. Thanks!\n. Thank you for your contributions and help with the issues!\n. Thank you for your contribution. Unfortunately we have to be very strict about what is added to UIkit and what not. Otherwise it will get bloated soon. We would recommend you add this to your site as a custom component if you need this.\n. you just need to add the selectedattribute the the option you want to be selected\nhtml\n<option value=\"1\" selected>Test</option>\n. close due to outdated issue\n. theme less files are not conerted to sass, so there are no $global-* variables. \n. @samks the problem is, that you've used alert. the alert function doesn't show objects in detail. please use console.log. to display the serialized data correctly. \nwith the alert function, try: \nvar data = $(\"#list\").data(\"nestable\").serialize();\nalert(JSON.stringify(data));\n. PR was merged, thanks!\n. Here is an example, how to use a callback function as a source:\n``` html\n\n\n\n</p>\n<pre><code>function cb(release) {\n\n    var data = [];\n\n    // build your data ...\n\n    release(data); // release the data back to the autocompleter\n}\n\nvar autocomplete = $.UIkit.autocomplete($('#callback'), { 'source': cb });\n</code></pre>\n<p>\n```\n. @vuchl ;-)\n. the throttle is because of performance reasons. how often do yo resize your browser during surfing? a way more real world example is an orientation change, where the lag is not that noticable.\n. this works great for us:\njavascript\nconfig: {\n    \"uikit\": {\n          \"base\": \"vendor/assets/uikit/js\"\n    }\n}\n. as @vuchl said correctly, you have to implement the result array yourself on the server side\n. thank you, this is fixed now\n. you can do that. btw can find every release here ready for download: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/releases \n. yes, the plan is to remove it in the future...please be a little bit patient ;-)\n. thanks, but this will be issued for UIkit 3.0\n. for mobile I would suggest to use \"date\" as the input type : <input type=\"date\"> to use the native datepicker\n. should be fixed now, see https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/develop/src/js/components/datepicker.js#L163\n. please make sure that you always include the uikit mixin file first, like here:\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/tests/_test.scss\n. this is fixed now, thanks!\n. thanks, we'll consider this for future releases.\n. just give the parent element of the grid data-uk-observe\n. Please look here: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/tree/develop#custom-prefix\n. I think this will always be a custom solution\n. why would you assign a fixed  height of 100%? isn't it better to use min-height?\n. hi!\nwe'll look into the issue and try to find a work around to have better rtl output.\n. thank you for the contribution. could you please create a pull request for the develop branch?\n. we want to provide a simple implementation. you can always register your own plugins/buttons for extended functionality.\n. thanks, but this is already fixed in the develop branch\n. the develop branch is where the current development is going on. so you you want the latest and greatest you should checkout the develop branch.\n. try before sending the ajax request\nvar element = $(e.target).css(\"pointer-events\", \"none\");\nand after you're ready\nelement.css(\"pointer-events\", \"\");\n. just modify the animation duration, e.g. style=\"animation-duration: 2s\"\n. everything works as expected: http://getuikit.com/docs/addons_notify.html .. did you clear your browser cache?\n. Thanks, we're fixing it right now.\n. thanks for the suggestion, but this should be provided as a third party add-on\n. I think this needs to be implemented by the app/script utilizing the pagination component. if we we would do this, code for other libraries (angular etc) will break. thanks for the suggestion.\n. thanks for the suggestion but the described behavior doesn't feel right. we think the current behavior should be kept.\n. this is by design. custom themes should import all components they need in its uikit.less\n. this is pretty app specific, some do #/ other do #!/ I think you should try to use and implement  the new html5 url route, also supported by angular.\n. could you provide an example?\n. fixed https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/48f10c6fec71e4d9b4d1a5a08f28337120f14826\n. Fixed https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/48f10c6fec71e4d9b4d1a5a08f28337120f14826\n. the editor writes back the value to the textarea on change. so just get the texarea value if yo need it\n. this should be possible with the boundary option. http://getuikit.com/docs/sticky.html#sticky-boundary \n. data-uk-observe is buggy in 2.13 ... it is fixed in the development branche\n. hi,\nas @schinckel suggested you can build custom behavior with the change.uk.tab event without connecting to a switcher.\n. thanks this is already fixed in the develop branch\n. why don't you just use the value attribute of the input field for init value?\n. could you please shed some light why you need the field to be blank in initial state?\n. you can use the minDate and maxDate options, we'll update the datepicker docs for the upcoming release.\n. We decided to keep $.UIkit for the 2.x releases. But it will be removed in UIkit 3.0\n. please run gulp with a -c parameter e.g. gulp -t custome-theme-name -c\n. please run gulp with a -c parameter e.g. gulp -t custome-theme-name -c\n. thanks for the hint. this is fixed now.\n. Old json parse function is back\n. the docs will be updated in the next release\n. please add uk-offcanvas-bar-flip to .uk-offcanvas-bar and it should work for you on rtl as expected\n. Could you please provide a code example on jsfiddle?\n. Could you please provide a code example on jsfiddle?\n. thanks!\n. thanks!\n. should work with the next release and data-uk-observe\n. should work with the next release and data-uk-observe\n. close because of duplicate issue\n. close because of duplicate issue\n.

Thanks for the hint. This should be fixed in the develop branch.\n. yes this was a temp. bug\n. the value attribute is just for initialization on dom-ready and won't change during an update of the field. to get the current value via jQuery: var value = $('#my-text').val()\n. wrap the text in a div within the td and add the class uk-text-truncate to the div\n. there is no #m-sticky in your markup but a #sticky\n. Thanks!\n. @jerry1970 provided the right solution\n. Sorry, I can't confirm this issue. could you please provide a code example on jsfiddle?\n. Fixed: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/eb281f559bf195cf49ff3e29da92b7520d59bc33 . Thanks.\n. this is an overflow \"issue\" during the animation. try body {overflow-y:hidden;} ;-)\n. thanks for the suggestion, we'll consider it for future releases.\n. should be fixed wit this commit: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/27d2e1cdb0f081bfacbbbf30287ce7b36c121936\n. thanks\n. @vuchl thanks!\n. Thanks for the hint.\n. it is an input element. the change event is always triggered if the value changes. I don't know if it is something needed to extra document.\n. hi, you have to implement this on your own by listening on change.uk.nestable on the list. \n. does this issue still occurs? which UIkit version did you use?\n. add the class uk-width-1-1 or  uk-width-1-2 to the navbar\n. I think this is too special and case related. but thanks for the suggestion.\n. I think this can be easily done by custom code and 2 helper variables in your code. But we'll consider it it for UIkit 3. thanks!\n. I didn't want to be dismissive, sorry if you felt so...I hope this commit helps you:  https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/34854d469007b604a3d90274e580eeddebdd71fb\n. thank you for the contribution, but this was addressed in UIkit 2.19.0\n. will be included in the upcoming release\n. could you please provide a jsfiddle - http://jsfiddle.net ?\n. will be included in the upcoming release.\n. @malles feel invited to create a pull request ;-)\n. @malles pull request is merged for the upcoming release\n. thanks for reporting, this will be included with the upcoming release.\n. thanks for the reporting, will be fixed with the upcoming release\n. you can already do that for each component. e.g. for the tooltip:\n``` javascript\nUIkit.on('beforeready.uk.dom', function(){\n$.extend(UIkit.components.tooltip.prototype.defaults, {\n    pos: 'top', \n    delay: 500, \n    animation: true\n});\n\n});\n```\n. could you please try, to give the image width and height attributes?\n. please try to use/add the following snippet:\n.uk-modal { transform: translateZ(0); }\n. can't confirm this for current develop branch + FF 35.0.1.\n. this is because of the placekitten image provider. thanks for reporting.\n. @malles thanks\n. I don't really see a real world scenario for this, sorry.\n. which browser is your target of concern?\n. Thanks for the suggestion, but this is too special\n. could you please be more detailed?\n. I think the best way would be to build custom directives.\n. Fixed in the develop branch\n. this should be fixed in the upcoming release\n. should be fixed with this commit: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/27d2e1cdb0f081bfacbbbf30287ce7b36c121936\n. try to run gulp -a or gulp --all this will also compile custom themes\n. there is still one problem...imagine the scenario, when uikit is included with a plugin e.g. for the backend for an existing system (cms etc). normally you would compile uikit without base.less to not mess up the systems css and only use the uikit components. this wouldn't be possible anymore with this PR.\n. Hi Zach,\nwe plan to (maybe) introduce the Autoprefixer in the next version. Thanks for the suggestion.\n. please try to run gulp watch or extract the zip within a webserver and navigate to e.g. http://localhost/uikit\n. please check against the current develop branch. should be fixed now\n. Fixed with this commit: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/74d26410ce0ee25730f857b20655b5ac858845e4\n. this is already fixed in the develop branch, thanks!\n. should be fixed with this commit: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/74d26410ce0ee25730f857b20655b5ac858845e4\n. Added with this commit: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/375ff4e0caff33553dfa7690c2d680a2db023367\n. thanks for the suggestion but I think this is an edge case. I can't really imagine a scenario wit more the 5 notification at the same time.\n. Sorry, but I think this is also to specific, but we keep it on our watch list. thank you for the suggestion.\n. thanks @malles \n. thanks!\n. the slideshow already supports touch events (swiping). the drag feature would only make sense with a simple slide effect. as nearly all effects are css based, it is impossible to hook into each effect step to sync it with current drag position. \n. I think it is the best approach for now to implement this functionality yourself. there are too many cases where you can't use the location hash as an identifier (hash based routing etc).\n. thanks @malles \n. as @malles said type=\"button\" is always required for \"normal\" buttons. I don't want to bloat the code with an unneeded extra check. but thanks for the suggestion.\n. @zslabs done: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/d7670ca0887652d8f1f2005e117e1113cb10ed52\n. thanks @malles \n. docs are updated now, thanks.\n. thanks for the suggestion, but this is too specific and should be easily created with existing components.\n. if you add content to closed items, the should expand fine on expanding. if you add content to open items, you need to toggle the manually\n. thanks for the suggestion, we'll consider it for future releases.\n. please make PRs only for the develop branch. thanks!\n. thanks!\n. can't you just center the content with the minor height?\n. this is the behaviour by design - dynamic height brings way more issues, especially in autoplay mode and jumping content below the slideshow for example\n. thanks!\n. please try to clear the browser cache\n. try <input type=\"date\"> \n. done https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/5d12bb9a0968f8adf8ae98dae8aa9a4b14a69d68\n. sorry, but this won't work because the there is no initial calculation for the grid possible if it is display:none. hover is triggered via css, so no way a dynamic grid will work in overlays. sorry. \n. implemented here: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/dfe8f581e49f2b3f06177da3871fc5dcc6de8bdb\n. closed because duplicate issue: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/1105\n. you have to create a custom theme (http://getuikit.com/docs/documentation_create-a-theme.html) and just and include the components you like\n. we would suggest to use a custom class in this case\n. Implemented here: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/f49340037e07051fee7f2d751d62acfebe43dcb2 . Thanks for the contribution.\n. as @PixelT you can use any uk-animation-* class. just override animation-duration for your sticky in your css for custom speed\n. yes, the scrollspy toggles animation classes in the demo, which use css animations which aren't supported by IE9. so if you want to support IE9, don't use scrollspy in combination with css animation based classes. scrollspy itself works without any problems with IE9. \nAlternative fix for IE9:\nhtml\n<!--[if IE 9]>\n<style>\n    [data-uk-scrollspy*='uk-animation-'] { opacity: 1 !important; }\n</style>\n<![endif]-->\n. this should be fixed with the upcoming release\n. the jumping issue should be fixed in the upcoming UIkit release\n. UIkit just adds classes which are needed by UIkit itself. to have a an extended support class list. I would recommend to use modernizer.js if needed.\n. should be fixed in the upcoming release.\n. I can't reproduce that. could you please provide a jsfiddle?\n. linebreaks in tooltips isn't something common. why don't you just use <br> instead. looks also cleaner.\n. I think normally you don't enter a full-screen mode for videos which cover an area. dbl click also only works with an embedded youtube player as I can see.  I would rather suggest:\niframe[data-uk-cover] { pointer-events:none; }\n. thanks!\n. sorry, but I can't confirm the issue. could you please provide a jsfiddle?\n. this is pretty strange, which UIkit version do you use=\n. this is because element.is(':visible') returns false if opacity is 0. use .uk-grid-match as a workaround suggested by @malles \n. thanks!\n. thanks!\n. this should be fixed with the upcoming release.\n. the slideset has a visible option:\ndata-uk-slideset=\"{visible:{default: 4, medium:3, small: 1}}\u201c\n. or define a drag handle element, the everything should work fine again.\n. Thanks Zach!\n. add the class uk-dropdown-close to span.\n. Do you have tested it against the latest Codemirror release? The demo uses a pretty outdated version. We'll updated Codemirror for the next UIkit release\n. Do you have tested it against the latest Codemirror release? The demo uses a pretty outdated version. We'll updated Codemirror for the next UIkit release\n. thanks for the hint, I committed a fix.\n. thanks for the hint, I committed a fix.\n. I agree with @malles this is not and won't be part of UIkit. The browser already provides multiple tools to validate and serialize a form. HTML5 forms + FormData object (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData). I don't see a need to implement something custom for UIkit. \n.

Thanks for the hint. Should be fixed now in the develop branch\n. hi, please visit http://yootheme.com/support , this is not a direct UIkit related issue. thanks!\n. Thanks, fixed.\n. @malles thanks!\n. thank you for the suggestion, but as @malles said, this is way out the scope of UIkit.\n. thank you for the suggestion. we'll consider it for future releases.\n. thanks!\n. can I close this issue, or is any question left?\n. :+1: \n. slider dragging is fixed now on touch devices in the current develop branch. we'll consider your suggestions for future releases, thanks.\n. thanks!\n. this is right, because the tooltip component doesn't belong to the core anymore.\n. @malles thanks! can we close that issue now?\n. thank you for your suggestion, we'll discuss this.\n. thank you for your suggestion, we'll discuss this.\n. thanks!\n. thanks!\n. Sorry but I can't confirm the issue. do you have a custom styled build of UIkit?\n. so can you confirm that getuikit.com has the same issue?\n. please contact @zslabs the creator of basey-theme. Thanks!\n. thanks!\n. truncate what?\n. Thank you for the suggestion but I don't see a need to implement this in UIkit. Please use existing js solutions if uk-text-truncate is not enough.\n. thanks for the suggestion. we'll consider it for UIkit 3.0\n. this should be fixed with the upcoming release. thanks!\n. thanks! we'll update jQuery.\n. thanks!\n. @malles thanks!\n. the uk-fade-scale02 issue will be fixed with the upcoming release. the was a bug in the build tools.\n. Could you please provide a jsfiddle? thanks!\n. because only this duration modifier is implemented. you have to add your own classes for custom animation durations.\nsee: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/less/core/animation.less#L144\n. please try to add data-uk-check-display to the grid root element  - http://getuikit.com/docs/documentation_javascript.html#data-check-display\n. thanks for the hint. this will be fixed with the upcoming release.\n. thanks!\n. this is implemented in the current dev version, just pass modal:false as option\n. this is fixed in the current dev branch.\n. thanks for the contribution, but this should be fixed wit the following commit: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/34660a9f8682d52b64a4482fe16316a357007a5d\n. thanks @malles !\n. it is possible by adding .js-uk-prevent to the anchor element e.g. \n<a href=\"#\" class=\"js-uk-prevent\">My Link</a>\n. the upload component uses the xhr2 transfer component which is only available for IE >= 10, sorry.\n. thanks for reporting! this is already fixed in the dev branche.\n. this is a special use case, thanks @rolandtoth for providing a custom solution.\n. this will be possible with the upcoming UIkit release:\n$(function() {\n    $('iframe[src*=\"www.youtube.com\"],iframe[src*=\"player.vimeo.com\"]').each(function() {\n        UIkit.responsiveElement(this);\n    });\n});\n. thanks @malles \n. thank you @malles for helping out.\n. in general you add uk-width-1-1 as the default width, and add columns for larger screens. I can't imagine that someone goes from uk-width-medium-1-4 to  uk-width-large-1-1 on large screens.\ncould you please try to explain a use case? \n. @malles thanks!\n. this is fixed in the dev branch: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/develop/src/js/components/slider.js#L266 . focus seems to work only with inputs. so focusitem ist the new event name.\n. try to add the attribute data-uk-observe to the grid element\n. the smoothscroll is just an effect thing, this makes sure that you don't mess up with all the js based routers. but we'll bring it back to discussion. thanks!\n. that's right, the extra animations only support image based slides. to support content based slides would be too much effort and overhead + I don't think it will look nice. thank you for your suggestion.\n. @zslabs thanks!\n. could you please provide a jsfiddle?\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. uikit provides support for some touch events (swipe, tap etc, see: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/js/core/touch.js ), but not multi touch gestures. please use hammer.js or similar script for advanced touch gestures.\n. thanks, but this is only releated to uikit. please visit http://yootheme.com/support. thank you! \n. should be fixed in the dev branch now.\n. the slideset component, doesn't have any less file, but re-uses the grid component.\n``` html\n\n\n\n\n        ...\n    \n\n``\n. should be fixed in the develop branch. thanks!\n. I would also recommend to use a \"binding\" framework , like angular, react etc for that.\n. the iframe needs to have the classuk-responsive-width... btw, the script auto-init all iframes with that classiframe.uk-responsive-width, so no need to manually init them\n. I think this should be easily fixed by using an exiisting 3rd party lazyloader script.\n. thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. thanks!\n. thanks!\n. thank your for sharing, we'll take a look on it.\n. thanks!\n. done for UIkit 2.23.0\n. what is$(location).attr('href', '/home');? do you want to go to another url? then the correct code would belocation.href = '/home';. in the callback forUIkit.modal.confirm`\n. thanks!\n. android < 4.4 is pretty common, so ttf won't removed but eot could be removed.\n. should be no difference\n. Thank you for the suggestion, we'll discuss that.\n. hi, sorry I don't think this is common behavior of a slideshow, and to be honest it feels somehow wrong. \nI would suggest you t add a custom snippet, that restarts the autoplay after some time without interacting.\n. @jerry1970 yes, for UIkit 3\n. awesome! thanks!\n. maybe you can try to solve it with flex (uk-grid-match)?\nhtml\n<div class=\"uk-grid uk-grid-match\" data-uk-grid>\n    <div>\n       <div class=\"uk-panel\">\n             Your content\n       </div>\n   </div>\n</div>\n. sorry, but the video doesn't load/exist\n. thank you for the suggestion .... We'll discuss it intern\n. which uikit source do you use? (e.g. bower uikit, or cdn)\n. I can't verify this, do you have still the issue with UIkit 2.22?\n. It is already planned to remove moment for UIkit 3.0\n. just override the prompt in your custom script.js:\njs\nUIkit.modal.prompt = function() {\n  // ...\n}\n. maybe related to issue #1462\n. @RowdyRocko does the issue still exists in UIkit 2.22?\n. thanks!\n. thanks for the suggestion, we'll consider it for future releases\n. <tr>'s should be possible to sort with <tbody class=\"uk-sortable\" data-uk-sortable>\n. Thank you for your suggestion, we already put this on our todo list for future UIkit releases\n. thanks!\n. did you try data-uk-scrollspy=\"{target:'#that'}\" ?\n. the variable is defined in variables.less  https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/less/core/variables.less#L20\n. thank you for your suggestion, we'll discuss this\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. this is already fixed, thanks.\n. please fork and create a pull request for the develop branch, thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. you have then to manually initialize it after  you appended the options, UIkit.formSelect(element)\n. thanks!\n. why don't you solve this via css .special-slideshow li { max-height: 300px; } ?\n. thanks for the suggestion, but I don't see an often scenario for this (timepicker with seconds).\n. I fully agree with zslabs on this topic.\n. sorry but this needs a custom solution -  maybe someone from the community can help: https://plus.google.com/communities/114238665434626719878\n. yes, please make sure to urlencode the paths properly before adding them as source\n. @zslabs thanks!\n. thanks for your suggestion, but this is a very special case where toggle is and should be a generic approach for simple toggles\n. sorry but it is not that simple as you think it is to remove jQuery, it has its reasons to stay (for now)\n. this setting is mentioned in the autocomplete docs now, and as the search component inherits from the autocomplete component... I hope that it is clear now. thanks!\n. no, sorry ... we'll discuss this. thanks for your suggestion.\n. sorry, but I can't verify that.\n. Thanks!\n. Already fixed in the dev branche, thanks!\n. closed because of overdue reply\n. Thanks!\n. default is now changed to \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n. Thanks!\n. you can still use uk-dropdown-flip etc, the will be available in all 2.x releases but will be removed in 3.x.\n. do you add the data-uk-slideshow-item attribute? e.g.: <li data-uk-slideshow-item=\"0\"><a href=\"\"></a></li>\n. you can use chaining here:\nUI.autocomplete($('#autocomplete'), {\n      source: getAutocompleteData\n}).on('selectitem.uk.autocomplete', function (e, data, ac) {...;\n });\n. did you try: data-uk-dropdown=\"{justify:'body'}\" ?\n. why don't you just use the mentioned table sorter. it seems that no real styling is needed. just drop the js in your project and use it.\n. try to add the uk-dropdown-close class to the anchor, e.g:\n<a class=\"uk-dropdown-close\">Compile</a>\n. Thank you for your suggestion, but I think this is too special for a css frontend framework.\n. this is not possible, sorry...the dropdown always relates to the first offset parent.\n. sorry, but uikits upload component just supports/uses the Formdata object, you need a custom solution.\n. thanks! we'll check this\n. jQuery 3 is still alpha ... please don't use it in production, as we also won't put any effort into it before it isn't in beta.\n. Thank you for the suggestion, but I think this should be a community based effort\n. try give the element an initial style=\"transform: translate3d(0px, 50px, 0px);\"  parallax starts on dom ready, this explains the jump\n. this is a special case and should stay a custom solution, but maybe as as suggestion:\nUIkit.modal.blockUI('<div class=\"uk-text-large uk-text-center\"><i class=\"uk-icon-spinner uk-icon-spin\"></i></div>', {center:true});\n. the @icon-font-path variable is dependent where you compile your less too. so if you compile the less by yourself you have to adjust the variable to your paths.\n. @zslabs thanks!\n. thank you for your suggestion, we'll consider this for future major releases\n. form icons don't work with textareas, sorry\n. try UIkit.init()\n$(document).on('ready page:load', function(event) {\n    UIkit.init();  \n});\n. could you please provide an example via jsfiddle?\n. which browser do you use?\n. what is xpages?\n. you've forgotten to add the uk-sortable class to the sortable element, e.g.:\nhtml\n<div class=\"uk-grid uk-grid-small uk-grid-width-1-3 uk-sortable\" data-uk-sortable=\"{handleClass:'uk-sortable-handle'}\">\n...\n. take a look here: http://getuikit.com/docs/dropdown.html#grid\n. thanks for the suggestions we'll discuss this for the next major release.\n. don't use the uk-overlay-hover class\n. sorry but no, a \"reversed\" overlay functionality is not supported.\n. http://getuikit.com/docs/modal.html#javascript\nUIkit.modal(\"#modalId\", {center:true}).show();\n. I think this is a wrong approach. more correct would be a custom class :\ncss\n.fixed-bottom {\n   position:fixed\n   bottom: 0;\n   left:0;\n   right: 0;\n}\n. seems to happen only on the documentation site, the test is working fine: http://getuikit.com/tests/components/parallax.html\nI'll investigate the issue\n. Thanks, fixed in the develop branch\n. Right, because the modal doesn't care about the content it contains. I think you're looking for the lightbox component: http://getuikit.com/docs/lightbox.html .\n. Hi! Yes should be fixed now!\n. hi,\nI can't verify the issue, using this test: http://getuikit.com/tests/components/form-file.html \nmaybe you can give more details when this occurs (Windows, Mac etc)?\n. me too, mac/chrome 47 ... no issue\n. will be fixed with the next release, thanks!\n. hi,\nI see your issue, but data-name-a=\"1\" won't happen....maybe the possibility to make { and } obsolete, so you can just use data-name=\"a:1, b:2\"\n. Hi! sorry can't confirm this: http://getuikit.com/tests/components/progress.html ... did you include the compnent, e.g. css/components/progress.css ? \n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks, this is fixed now\n. In general you should create a custom theme, where you set e.g a global font variable and reuse it for all components\n. PR merged.\n. Thanks!\n. you need to call update on the accordion object after adding dynamic markup: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/develop/src/js/components/accordion.js#L115 \n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n.

You can name the id however you want. This is why we used \"my-id\" in the example to make that more clear.\n. Ok, now I get it. You can give ANY container element the boundary identifier. It doesn't have to be on the dropdown button itself. Maybe our example isn't a good choice. A good one would be a navbar with dropdowns and you want to flip any of the dropdowns if it sticks out the navbar boundary.

But we don't want to bloat uikit with shorter alternative class names.\n. We want to keep the code readable. The longer class names are no issue because the larger size is irrelevant if using gzip.\n. Yes, would be nice but we don't want to bloat the uikit core with it. Maybe an addon?\n. Ah, thanks for clarifying the issue. We hesitate to add this feature because it is a large code block and you need it very rarely. If more people request it we will reconsider. I would suggest that you just add your needed CSS classes manually to your UIkit theme.\n. must also reset .uk-form-small and.uk-form-large which use !important (to keep the selector simple)\n. Please post a link where we can inspect the issue.\n. It is needed to create the grid gutter.

This is really an edge case. You shouldn't use the markdown fullscreen mode in a modal box.\n. Can you post a link again, so we can inspect the issue?\n. Sounds great. Maybe you can create an UIkit add-on for it?\n. Thanks for you suggestions. For now we want to leave it like it is but if more people will request this we will reconsider.\nBut we will have a new uk-border-circle class in the next release 198dafda11965b8ac84a259a8764adc02ecb8e63\n. Thanks! I added it.\n. Just add a class for each switcher. For example switcher-blue and switcher-red. Now you can select an active tab by using switcher-blue uk-active\n. You can see all included brand icons here http://www.getuikit.com/docs/icon.html under \"Brand Icons\"\n. Can you describe this issue a little more?\n. Yes, the small breakpoint is currently not used by any of the components. Nonetheless, we provide this breakpoint to detect phone landscape size. Themes, add-ons or new components may use it.\n. Just add the class uk-form somewhere around your input or textarea. It doesn't have to be the form element. It can also be a div\n. Thanks! We think it is clear because if you don't use a uk-with-* class why would you even use th uk-grid class...\n. Sorry, we won't do that. This is what the LESS files are for. The core UIkit is nicely separated from the theming. But when you compile the CSS you get one file. Your suggestion would have a lot of selector overhead. Why would you need that?\n. That is just because the distributions (compiled CSS) are not up to date in the repository. When you run grunt the latest LESS files are compiled to CSS. The repository is currently work in progress and we will compile the dists once when we are ready for the next release.\n. This is a matter of taste. Currently we don't want to add the pointer cursor for labels.\n. It is fixed in 2.3.1 d0eea5c073dc3d790ae48f3f59e78f3d36da3927\n. Thanks for your suggestions! You can easily add the FontAwesome SVG icon font yourself.\nWe will keep an close eye on how SVG icons will evolve in the future.\n. Guys, you are both talking about different things.\n@Anachron \nAs you can see here http://caniuse.com/#feat=ttf and here http://caniuse.com/#feat=woff You would only need the SVG font for old Android 2.1 devices. Besides that the SVG font for FontAwesome is 202KB in size which is also very large for a mobile device. So we dropped it.\n@willfaulds \nWe are talking about SVG fonts and not about SVG image fallbacks. At the current state we will not include any SVG image fallbacks. If you need that for your website you can include that yourself. \n. This is an edge case. Do you really need a sortable in the offcanvas nav?\n. You can solve the z-index issue by setting the @dropdown-z-index or @global-z-index variable.\n. No, it is not bad for SEO.\n. Can you give more information?\n. You can search with Google using the inurl parameter. For example try dropdown inurl:getuikit.com in the Google search. You will only get search results from getuikit.com\n. Vertical alignment can be done with the flex component https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/less/components/flex.less\n. Fixed with the next release 72e19363a1dc1aae9cc79816b1664a190dda0513\n. It doesn't look like this is an UIkit issue. If you have questions regarding YOOtheme and Warp please ask in their support center.\n. The test pages are working perfectly for me. What issue do you have? You don't need the header information you added. The test pages are using LESS and compile it in real time.\n. See #246\n. The tm- prefix means \"theme\". This is additional CSS we needed for the docs theming.\n. You are loading the default UIkit. It doesn't have much styling. If you want it to look like the docs use the Gradient theme. Just include uikit.gradient.min.css instead of uikit.min.css\n. This is not a bug. Please ask this kind of questions in our new Google+ community https://plus.google.com/communities/114238665434626719878\n. Please just change the color of the tooltip by using the variables or customizer.\n. Please take a look here http://www.getuikit.com/docs/documentation_get-started.html at HTML Page Markup\nIf you still have issues please ask this kind of question in our new Google+ community https://plus.google.com/communities/114238665434626719878\n. Not at the moment but we are working on it.\n. Hi, we also thought of doing a SASS port. What would you suggest?\n. Thanks guys! Please be a little patient. Currently we are a little limited in resources but we will take a look at it as soon as possible.\n. Hi guys, finally we have a Sass port!\n. Can you provide a JSFiddle? I can't reproduce it.\n. Yes, if you float you have to clear in the parent container.\n. Please ask this kind of question in our Google+ Community\n. Thanks for your suggestions.\n. Just don't add data-uk-tab. This is what makes the tabs responsive.\n. Will be fixed in the next version. eb2e516028cea8540df474e51c6599a54501048a\n. This issue should be fixed with d23a1ac95bb0719b2db42effa32915043d18d295 If not please let us know.\n. @vouvrat UIkit comes with a very minimal default style. If you load uikit.min.css you only load the default style. If you want a nicer look you have to choose a uikit theme. We have two themes already on board: almost-flat and gradient. For example just load uikit.almost-flat.min.css for the almost flat style. \n. You need custom code.\n. This is a support question and not a UIkit issue. Please ask this kind of questions on our Google+ Community site.\n. Thanks! Will be fixed with the next version. 308b2abc0f3322334d2d92c8357502a5308fa99b\n. An accordion addon is on our todo list.\n. We added an overflow container which is really helpful to make tables more responsive. 6701f903b7f8e95b920d71dc73cc8d4494edbdae\n. Our plan is to tackle this problem when we start with the SASS port.\n. This is a support question and not a UIkit issue. Please ask this kind of questions on our Google+ Community site.\n. This is a support question and not a UIkit issue. Please ask this kind of questions on our Google+ Community site.\n. This is a support question and not a UIkit issue. Please ask this kind of questions on Google+ Community site.\n. The print stylesheet is currently very basic. We are changing all backgrounds and colors\ncss\n* {\n     background: transparent !important;\n    color: black !important;\n}\nWe won't change that. Just create your own print stylesheet and include it instead.\n. It is fixed\n. Issue is fixed\n@arrowthemes The modal has now the slide animation by default. So no need for .uk-modal-dialog-slide\n. The 3/5 and 2/5 ratio are working for me. Please provide a JSFiddle\n. It is fixed with the next release\n. This is not an issue. Please ask this kind of questions in our UIkit community page.\n. Thanks for the suggestion. We will keep it in mind.\n. We won't do this for the 2.x releases but we will keep it in mind for 3.x\n. Can you provide a JSFiddle?\n. Can you provide a JSFiddle?\n. I think removing -webkit-tap-highlight-color would remove useful feedback. Sure it looks ugly in android we don't want to remove this by default.\n. Thank you! I couldn't merge your pull request because you did the changes in the print.less and they needed to be in the navbar.less. But I fixed it now 7235b2c8a4506cb28c272317b95984255e20714b\n. Please ask this kind of question in the Google+ community\n. Sorry, your Android browser is too old. Please use a newer version.\n. Can you elaborate this more? All components are prefixed. Only the base styles are not (normalize.less and base.less)\n. Thanks, this is a special case because the badge is not using the global border radius (too large) and not all properties in the theme are set using variables. I would recommend to change it manually in the theme or the compiled CSS\n. We will merge the WIP branch as soon as the work in the WIP branch is finished.\n. Or take a here\n. Can you provide a JSFiddle where I can see the issue?\n. The breakpoint exists and is used in some components. But for example for the Grid we thought it is not needed. Where do you miss a special behavior for xlarge screens?\n. Thanks for your suggestion. It is not planned for the 2.x releases but we will make the color modifiers more consistent for 3.x\n. We are working on a slidehow addon. See our WIP branch.\n. Thanks, its fixed now 13217a39ae30e9a442960d6b5970839e87761a43\n. UIkit components don't use global variables. They need to be dependency free so they can be compiled stand-alone. What you are looking for is the default theme (/themes/default/default). It adds global variables to make theming easier. It does not change the basic UIkit style. It only introduces global variables.\n. There is no dependency on the base.less . You can compile each component file on its own. Please take a look at the default theme. That's what you want.\n. It is working for me in your JSFiddle example?!?\n. Sure, but this is not how it looks for me in Chrome. Which browser are you using?\n. Thanks, we will put it on our todo list\n. Thanks for your suggestion. We will think of it.\n. UIkit supports IE9 and higher\n. Actually it is correct. This is how it should be.\n. For RTL everything is reversed. So this classes too.\n. Please provide a JSFiddle\n. Sorry, for the downtime. The DNS change took a little bit long. It's working now.\n. You might get more help in our UIkit community\n. Dopple post #408\n. The showcase has its own repository. We will put it on getuikit.com with the next release.\n. Can you provide an example where we can inspect the issue. For example at JSFiddle\n. Can you provide a JSFiddle or another example where we can inspect the issue?\n. Thanks, it is on our todo list.\n. Please ask this question in our UIkit community\n. Unfortunately your JSFiddle doesn't show that. Can you provide a new one?\n. Ok, this is a special case. We don't want to give the overlay a z-index by default but you can do so by using following hook in your uikit theme.\n.hook-overlay-area() { z-index: 2; }\n. Overlays don't have to be rounded in the almost-flat style\n. Yes, panels have but overlays can be on any kind of elements like images which don't have rounded corners.\n. I see what you mean but this is a special case and we would solve it by using custom code.\n. Please provide an example on JSFiddle\n. @jerry1970 Yes, search close button and loading spinner were removed in 2.9. See changelog. The essential HTML classes uk-active and uk-loadig are still set by JavaScript (only the CSS is missing) so you can add this yourself.\n. Can you provide an example? JSFiddle\n. See #438\n. Thanks! Unfortunately I couldn't merge your pull request because in your commits are more changes done (Search.js, Sortable.js, Sticky.js and UIkit.js). What is it about? Please also leave out the compiled dists (CSS,JS) and do pull requests only for the changed core files.\nI optimized your background fix for for form-advanced and committed it bf0697a6997bec5fa1e87c2c4283824207fac5b8\n. We will consider it.\n. We had some issues with the server cache. Please try again. Is it fixed?\n. If I get it right, you want to introduce global color variables? That is exactly what the default theme in themes/default/default does. For example take a look at the variable file .\n. If I get it right, you want to introduce global color variables? That is exactly what the default theme in themes/default/default does. For example take a look at the variable file .\n. Thanks, we put it on our todo list for future udpates.\n. Thanks, we put it on our todo list for future udpates.\n. Please provide a JSFiddle\n. Just click into it and enter a new value.\n. We will rework the themes for UIkit 3\n. Thanks for all suggestions. I moved the list to the top of this thread.\n. Get ready... UIkit 3 beta is coming on Monday 9th, January \ud83c\udf89\ud83d\udca5 https://twitter.com/getuikit/status/817379709503832064. Thanks! That is a good suggestion. Unfortunately we have to be very strict about what is added to UIkit and what not. Otherwise it will get bloated soon. We would recommend that you add this to your custom theme if you need this.\n. Thanks! That is a good suggestion. Unfortunately we have to be very strict about what is added to UIkit and what not. Otherwise it will get bloated soon. We would recommend that you add this to your custom theme if you need this.\n. Please provide a JSFiddle\n. For the tabs please use data-uk-tab and your problem will be solved. See tab docs.\nFor the navbar we don't provide a solution. Normally you hide the navbar on small devices and show a off-cancas menu instead.\n. Thanks, this is know issue when height is set to 100%. Instead of uk-height-1-1 please use uk-height-viewport and it will work.\nOr in other words use height: 100vh;\n. Thanks, this is a known issue. You need to address it with custom CSS. Just change the icons with CSS only for RTL\n. Thanks, it is a known issue with elements which are  position: fixed;. You need to address this with custom code.\n. Please provide a JSFiddle\n. Please provide a JS\n. Thanks, that's interesting. But since we are talking about milliseconds it is insignificant.\n. Done :-) 80c221f9fbdc529fedc63660907bb4d84bfa26d0\n. Please provide a JSFiddle\n. @zslabs The z-index issue is fixed 34d3a62dadf40345de944de2367f3f5763d10e20 Are the other issues are still there?\n. You need to set a width to the parent element of the thumbnail. Normally you have it in a grid where a width is already set.\n. Please provide a JSFiddle\n. Thanks!\n. The radio button looks fine for me. Is it still an issue in the current version? If yes, file a new issue and specify the browser you are using.\n. I noticed that too. What about using a <button> element instead?\n. Fixed #709 \n. Thanks, we will consider it for future updates. Till than you can change the variable @form-mini-width: 40px; in Less.\n. Thanks, we will consider it for future releases.\n. Thanks, we will consider it for future updates.\n. Each grid cell has a padding to the left to create the grid gutter. And the left padding from the first cell needs to be compensated. This is done by giving the container a negative margin to the left with same value of the gutter padding.\n. You can change the Less variable @breakpoint-xlarge: 1220px; to any value you want. And compile the CSS again using gulp\n. Thanks, it's fixed in the next release 61308f3e053b6bbc5084434198829388cad621ea\n. Thanks, we will consider it for future releases.\n. Thanks, we will consider it.\n. Thanks, we will consider it\n. The distribution files have now their own repo: Bower UIkit\n. Yes, we removed the old addons CSS file because it included every addon and was very large in file size. We think it is better to include just the addon files you need and not all addons at once. So instead we have CSS files for each addon.\n. Fixed #709\n. Absolute Horizontal And Vertical Centering In CSS\n. The distribution files have now their own repo: Bower UIkit\n. @novusidea Basically a good idea, but I think it is not very often needed and we don't want to bloat the code with all kind of utility classes.\n@krzksz I got you, but I think there is nothing wrong with some utility classes\n. Thanks for reporting.\n. uk-button has a specific style (depending on the theme). If you don't like rounded corners, change it in the theme.\n. We can't remove the color: inherit; because it is part of the form normalization.\nWhy not use <button class=\"uk-button\" type=\"submit\" name=\"myButton\" value=\"foo\">Click me</button> in the meantime while we think about a solution?\n. Fixed #709\n. Sorry guys, we won't do that in the near future.\n. It is working in the Docs and Tests Right?\n. Thanks Zach, yes I agree ;-)\n. Thanks! Unfortunately this is not the default behavior we want. We would recommend that you add this to your custom theme if you need this.\n. You forgot to load the Cover component in the External Resources ;-)\n. Thanks for you suggestion\n. The nav component comes with an accordion effect.\n. Please provide a JSFiddle. Otherwise we will close this issue soon.\n. Thanks, it is fixed.\n. Thanks for reporting. Please provide a JSFiddle. Otherwise we will close this issue soon.\n. Thanks for reporting. It is fixed now.\n. Hi, it is already on npm\n. You suggested code does not the same like the original one.\n.uk-grid-divider > [class*='uk-width'] does also select all .uk-width-medium and .uk-width-large classes.\nIf you have an alternative I would also suggest to provide a test where we can see if it working, like a JSFiddle. Otherwise we will close this issue soon.\n. We will consider this issue for UIkit 3 when we rework the grid component.\n. Thanks it is fixed now 270de99\n. It is working for me. What is exactly not working? Please provide a JSFiddle. Otherwise we will close this issue soon.\n. This is necessary to allocate the space and to have equal cells.\n. Please provide a JSFiddle. Otherwise we will close this issue soon.\n. Thanks! That is a good suggestion. Unfortunately we have to be very strict about what is added to UIkit and what not. Otherwise it will get bloated soon. We would recommend that you add this to your custom theme if you need this.\n. We have already done some prototyping and it's on our todo list :wink: \n. Thanks! The .uk-container class is not intended to be nested at the moment. Primarily it is used to create the the layout width wrapper for a theme. I would rather add this to your custom theme if you need it. \n. Please provide a JSFiddle or similar.\n. Please use \ncss\na:visited:not(.uk-button) {\n  color: yellow;\n}\n. Some hints also in the blog post.\n. It is working in 2.15 again, right?\n. You are right, there is some inconsistency...\nThe additional components are not included in the theme (CSS) distributions. It's because these components are special and you don't need them very often.\nWe included them in the customizer so you can use the customizer to style them. Because of this they are also included in the customizer generated CSS. This is were it's wrong...\n. Thanks! Unfortunately we have to be very strict about what is added to UIkit and what not. Otherwise it will get bloated soon. And there are not that many requests for a 8 and 12 column grid...\n. Please ask your questions in the YOOtheme support center.\n. We are torn about it. Why do you need this? Don't you have your own theme? Just copy one of the existing...\n. Please use the @overlay-area-icon\n@overlay-area-icon:                             \"\\f002\";\n. Please use the @overlay-area-icon\n@overlay-area-icon:                             \"\\f002\";\n. We changed our release strategy a little. Before UIkit 3.0 you can still expect a couple more 2.x releases, which will include additional features. UIkit 3 itself will primarily contain breaking changes, like renamed classes, variables and markup. You can find a list of feature requests and ideas for UIkit here #560\n.

Thanks, should be fixed with the latest release dc7834efbb10bdd620ba5d76ff70ef3bd82dd525\n. Yes, this can't be combined at the moment, sorry.\n. Sorry, this is not possible with the current grid. But if you find in any other existing CSS framework a solution for this, please let me know and I will take a look at it. :smile: \n. Yes, this is a known issue. It will not be fixed in UIkit 2.x because we would have to change the grid and that would break too much in existing pages. But we will tackle this in UIkit 3 :smile: \n. Sorry, grid dividers does not work with grid small at the moment.\ncss\n/*\n * Horizontal divider\n * Only works with the default gutter. Does not work with gutter collapse, small or large.\n * Does not work with `uk-push-*`, `uk-pull-*` and not if the columns float into the next row.\n */\n. Could you please provide a JSFiddle?\n. Could you please provide a JSFiddle?\n. We won't introduce this to UIkit 2 but it is really an option for UIkit 3. Please suggest it here https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/560\n. Thanks, we fixed it 6e2e6a2be410e1070215a0198954a2ac59d65bfe\n. Could you please provide a JSFiddle?\n. Thanks, I fixed it 9556740c00057c1a0d00d339e007e3d654f29114 Please send pull requests only to the develop branch\n. @zslabs Thanks, I fixed it 49b9c6578fb2987454273e4d39d33c5b28b8ebe6 Please send pull requests only to the develop branch\n@malles LOL :-)\n. We also need something like that for Widgetkit. At the moment we use the subnav or just inline elments in a row.\n. We added a new thumbnav component :smile: f1e5a672644928e73e1c175c2aac18b96244ab7b It uses flexbox and can be aligned using the flex component. We also refactored the subnav and dotnav to use flexbox.\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/develop/src/less/core/thumbnav.less\n. Could you please provide a JSFiddle?\n. Could you please provide a JSFiddle?\n. I'm afraid this won't work as expected. But we will have a solution in UIkit 3.\n. Sorry, this was just an upload issue. There are only 3 official UIkit themes: default, gradient, almost-flat\n. There is already a class uk-panel-title. You can use it to style the panel title of the panel box like in your screenshot .uk-panel-box .uk-panel-title. We don't think you often need a panel footer and we don't want to bloat the code with it.\n. Please put the hidden element outside of the button group. We want to keep things simple and not bloat the code.\n. We think a warning button is a rare use case and we don't want to add too much stuff to not bloat the code. But sure, it is open for discussion.\n. Isn't that already possible if you use the text utility classes? Try uk-text-center uk-align-medium-left\n. Sorry, it doesn't work. It could, but we didn't want to bloat the code. :grin: \nCSS\n/*\n * Horizontal divider\n * Only works with the default gutter. Does not work with gutter collapse, small or large.\n * Does not work with `uk-push-*`, `uk-pull-*` and not if the columns float into the next row.\n */\n. We will tackle this in UIkit 3 when we rework the grid :wink: \n. The link you are referencing is to Widgetkit 1. It doesn't use UIkit.\nWhy would you need to open an iframe with the lightbox? You can just use the modal component. The lightbox just helps to easily generate modal dialogs for galleries with images and videos. I don't think you need this for iframes or do you? I'm sorry but we also won't add swf support. \n. Could you please provide a JSFiddle?\n. We updated the subnav to use flexbox in next UIkit version. This issue should be fixed then. Also instead of uk-text-center you have to use uk-flex-center\n. Please make a new pull request for the develop branch.\n. Thanks, it is already fixed in the develop branch. Please always do pull requests to the develop branch and not the master.\n. Could you please provide a JSFiddle?\n. Added 3558a008dde866ba021c0fbaaecc6a02e6215548\n. Fixed ed697b9294aa2d4935fe3c407e115b7dd2c5afca\n. Thanks for your suggestion. Maybe in the future\n. Thanks, good idea! But we don't want to change it at the moment because it could break current themes (for example if gradients are used). We will definitely consider it for UIkit 3. Please suggest it here. For now, please do a work around in your UIkit theme.\n. Looks correct to me. If you want a dynamic grid take a look here\n. Please suggest this feature for UIkit 3. https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/560\n. Thanks for reporting. We are aware of this issue but we don't have a fix at the moment without doing too much custom code.\n. There are core components which usually consit of a CSS and JS source file. All core components are bundled in UIkit. So you only need to load uikit.css and uikit.js\nAnd there are additional components called add-ons. They require UIkit. Just load their CSS and JS file after UIkit if you need one of the additional components.\n. We will fix and update it with the next release :smile: \n. Could you please provide a JSFiddle?\n. Please create a new pull request for the develop branch. \n. UIkit is moving slowly to use flexbox in all components. Sorry, but you need a browser with flexbox support.\n. The fix broke the form component. Unfortunately we don't have another one at the moment. We moved the normalization into the components to cause less conflicts with 3rd party CSS.\n. Could you please provide a JSFiddle?\n. If you run gulp you always get a CSS and minified CSS version in the dist folder.\n. I' afraid a lot of themes may break. We need to make sure it would be a safe update.\n. I don't know of any CSS fix for the min-height/height 100% issue. But maybe build it different like @malles suggested...\n. Mhh, since there are 593 icons it would bloat the code a little, right? :grin: \n. What about a uk-list-bullet class?\n. In the first UIkit releases the global variables were bundled with the core but at one point we decoupled them from the core to be more flexible and modular. I get what you are saying and it is definitely something to rethink but I would wait for UIkit 3 to do so. We have a lot of ideas for UIkit 3 especially cleaning everything up ;-) Maybe we will create a branch in the near future to put the first ideas there.\nCan you post this in the UIkit 3 ideas thread? \n. Thanks, we will keep it in mind for future development.\n. You should do that in your UIkit theme by using a hook.\n. It works for me in the modal test. Are you using the latest UIkit version?\n. Please provide a JSFiddle.\n. The icons seem to be fine aligned in the test.\n. Since this is not an UIkit issue, I closed it.\n. Try to get help in the UIkit Google+ community\n. UIkit is still working fine in IE9 but we are moving flexbox slowly into the core. Sure, the flex classes won't work in IE9, but you know that and don't have to use them if you don't want to.\n. Thanks :smile: Please do the pull request to the develop branch.\n. http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/whats-new/\n. Please ask for help in the UIkit Google+ community\n. Please try to ask for help in the UIkit Google+ community\n. So it is solved?\n. How can people easily join a Slack chat without being invited? I don't think this is possible. And to have the guest access feature everyone has to pay $6.67 per month...\n. You can change it in the theme.\n. Yes, I agree and we will do that for UIkit 3. But I don't think we can introduce it for UIkit 2 because it would break existing themes and it would take a lot of work to fix it. Please put it on the UIki 3 feature list.\n. Maybe someone in the UIkit Google+ community can help you? Try to post custom issues which are not bugs there.\n. Yes, that's why we have a min-height set. There is currently no solution because if IE11/10. Maybe use a custom class.\n. Yes, good idea! Like I wrote https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/1139#issuecomment-92336163 we are thinking of a gutter, width and flex component to replace the grid.\n. Please provide a JSFiddle\n. We will try to be more clear next time.\n. Right, currently we don't have a border-width variable. We will keep it in mind for UIkit 3\n. Please take a look Embedding Sass in your project\n@christianmagill Yes, the current themes need to be updated so they can converted easily to Sass. But I think, if you start a Sass project you will have your own custom theme anyway, right?\n. Please provide a https://jsfiddle.net/\n. I don't think it is a good idea to remove the color from the uk-badge rules. But I see what you mean. UIkit 3 will be more consistent. \n. Mmh, it is a matter of taste. I like how it is now.\n. We will keep it in mind for future releases\n. Just don't include the base.less in your custom UIkit theme.\n. Please take a look in the docs or tests, and provide a JSfiddle.\n. Sorry, but we think stacking icons this way doesn't look very nice. We recommend to create your own icons (SVGs). Or put this code in your custom UIkit theme.\n. Please don't use the fieldset not as grid cell. Just use a div http://jsfiddle.net/d8wxnvv9/1/\n. Can you provide a JSFiddle?\n. It's on our todo list\n. Please provide a JSfiddle :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: \n. Please add the suggestion to the UIkit 3 ideas thread.\n. Thanks, we will keep it in mind.\n. Thanks! Seems that the element needs a specified width and not just on the container element. I fixed it. 4e8b322babd25912e9802a7df0c86381b9ea5262\n. If I get it right display: -webkit-box; is breaking your site in Safari 8. But you added this property/value manually. So everything is working if you use the default UIkit grid?\n. Yes, I bet it's because of the Autoprefixer \n. But at the moment the autoprefixer seems to break stuff, right? So this needs to be solved first...\n. @PixelT We have plans to add the uk-width-xlarge classes.\nUpdating the visibility and hidden classes for the different breakpoints can only be done in UIkit 3 because they would work differently than now and changing it in UIkit 2 would mean to break stuff.\n@zslabs Nice idea. Most likely we will also split the Grid component into a gutter and a width component. So we would have gutter, width and flex to rule them all :smile: \n. Done ca903f850c5dd013d7e44ed8832a4ccd0868e227\n. Maybe uk-flex-wrap works? If not, we should come up with something. A JSfiddle would be nice to play around.\n. I will keep it in mind for the next Grid update.\n. You mean the bower repo with the Sass files?\n. You mean a version number set in a Sass variable? Sorry, there isn't one. But sure, there is the version number in the bower.json file.\n. @malles Everything looks alright for me in your example. You can't get the exact same result with the flex classes like you did with the push/pull classes. But I think the first example is very unlikely. At least we never had such a case :grimacing:  Actually, the flex example is more like our usual markup.\n. It's working in the tests. Please provide a JSfiddle.\n. The currently preferred solution is to hide the navbar and provide an offcanvas menu with toggler instead.\n. Thank you!\n. You can also ask in the Google+ community or in our developer chat.\n. Thanks :smile: \n. Thanks, done it with 2.20.3\n. Thanks! You mean if you use <input type=\"submit\">? Please use <button type=\"submit\"> instead.\n. @uundh They are added in the latest release https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/cc80972fdf7db5bc7c520087bb2dd79508f69d9e\n. We added this because if you have a navbar with dropdowns and the navbar items are just separators (like it can be in Joomla and Wordpress) the text cursor indicates that the navbar items are not clickable.\nSure, we would build this differently in UIkit 3.\nMaybe you can explain why this needs to be removed now. It would change the cursor behavior in our themes. I leave this open for discussion.\n. Thanks!\n. We often use different colors for text and backgrounds. That's because colors look different when used on thin lines instead of background areas.\nThis is why the text color default values are not the same like the global colors.\nYour custom theme is the perfect place to do this.\n. Thanks, it is already fixed in the developer branch. f15889e4fd37f75b72d68a391a854758a6ef888f\n. @luxlogica Yes, this is a good idea. I don't know if you are aware that we are also the creators of Pagekit, a new CMS which user interface is completely built with Vue.js and UIkit :wink:\nWe are in the middle of planning UIkit 3.0 and we take care of a great integration with Vue :smile: \n. @nblackburn @jods4 Yes, of course it would be optional / its own project. UIkit itself should work great with any JS framework.\n. Hi guys, UIkit 3 is in heavy development. You can expect a whole rewrite with tons of great features \ud83d\ude04 Please bear a little with us. We will share the alpha version in fall, so all of you can give their thoughts and contribute \ud83d\ude04\n. Thanks!\n. Dude, what's wrong with you?\n. Thanks! Fixed https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/8b46c16eed7b69342f8ad86f684335d9e36b8f21. Thanks! Fixed https://github.com/uikit/uikit-site/commit/95a4b1500cab6f366dfae3fc08adc1bbfc81312c. Thanks! I removed it from the docs. It doesn't work https://github.com/uikit/uikit-site/commit/7639d8c9a6ac94157e4804fde7c35236f2f2ce81. Can you post a screenshot?. It's fixed https://github.com/uikit/uikit-site/commit/9ec01c757cf00ff01993db85163d99d79fd2676a. There are no uk-invisible-* classes. It's called uk-hidden-* \ud83d\ude09  https://getuikit.com/docs/visibility#hidden. Off-canvas was refactored in Beta 19. How is it performing now? That's the best we could do.. The Dark/Light select box just adds uk-dark or uk-light to the body element. This will of course \"destroy\" the style of the navbar, sections (primary + secondary) and cards (primary + secondary) because they already color their own content automatically.\nYou won't set the uk-dark or uk-light classes to the body element if you use one of these components. You set the classes only for elements which needs them.\nIn the tests the Dark/Light select box is just for faster testing.\nDid my answer help understanding it?. Are you using Beta 2 ?. Can't see it. Please provide an example where we can inspect the issue, like this one. The grid is working for me, see Grid test. What's not working for you?\nYes, dynamic grid (sorting effect) and lightbox are not included in the UIkit 3 beta. We are still working on it.. Thank! Can you elaborate why it should be on the table data element? It's working for me, see table test.. Yes, it's not ready for the beta yet. We are working on it. . Thanks @viocassel, yes, FontAwesome still works great with UIkit. It's just not included in UIkit itself. You have to add it by following their official guidelines.. The dropdown has CSS to apply a style. uk-dropdown That's all. JS-wise its just like an alias. Please use uk-switcher-item=\"next\" and uk-switcher-item=\"previous\". See switcher docs.. Good idea. Do you want to create a pull request for this?. Sorry, we dropped the uk-width-*-10 classes. If you want to create a grid with equal columns just use uk-child-width-expand It works with any column number.\n<div class=\"uk-child-width-expand\" uk-grid>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div>\n</div>\nYou can also mix it with item width classes to get different proportions.\n<div class=\"uk-child-width-expand\" uk-grid>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div>\n    <div class=\"uk-width-1-3\"></div>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div>\n    <div class=\"uk-width-1-6\"></div>\n</div>\nIf that doesn't help you and you really need tenths, you have to add them manually using the Miscellaneous hook as @BobbyBabes said.. Thanks for you feedback!\n\n\nWe will consider it in the future\n\n\nThe uk-icon=\"icon: NAME\" attribute sets the uk-icon class automatically. When using the uk-icon-image class, you don't use the icon component (because you use a custom image) so you have to add the uk-icon class manually.. Sorry, we won't add new classes to v2. Also the proposed solution increases the selector specificity from 1 class to 3 classes.. It is already implemented. You can also use data-uk-* See documentation. Please provide a working CodePen http://codepen.io/anon/pen/KaZqdw. The animation class in the first list item is set on an inline element, but animations only work on block elements. See http://codepen.io/anon/pen/KaZqdw. Thanks! Fixed with this commit. https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/fb54e001380654c1a715b9e3aec2002b258bf1b1\n\n\nUse uk-width-expand instead of uk-width-1-1. @kiarashi You can already build the layout shown in the image with the Grid component\n@luxlogica With our Grid component you can easily build the Bulma example. Use the Tile or Card component for the cell style. We have the dynamic grid in UIkit 2 and we will have it soon in UIkit 3, too. Shuffle.js looks nice, btw.. Sorry, we don't have a CSS solution for this. If uk-dark or uk-light (or extended like primary and secondary sections and cards do) is apply once, you can't revert it.. @Toccoan This is a Safari bug http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18860098/on-a-browser-sessionstorage-in-safaris-private-browsing-does-not-work-the-same. Thanks!. Everything works fine for me in Opera 43. Which version are you using?. Thanks!. Just use uk-position-relative instead of uk-inline \ud83d\ude09 . Great \ud83d\ude04 . If you want to disable the inverse mode in general just do:\n@inverse-global-color-mode: none;\nYou can also disable the inverse mode for specific components:\n```\n@card-primary-color-mode: none;\n@card-secondary-color-mode: none;\n@offcanvas-bar-color-mode: none;\n@overlay-primary-color-mode: none;\n@section-primary-color-mode: none;\n@section-secondary-color-mode: none; \n```\n. The Slider component is now available in UIkit 3.. Thanks!. Just set the divider icon color. To do so add the following code to your custom UIkit theme\nless\n@divider-icon-color:                            @global-border;\nThe overlay icon automatically takes the text color. But you can also set the overlay icon color directly:\nless\n.hook-overlay-icon() { color: blue; }\n. Yes, that's fine. It's not an error, it's a notice/warning.\nThe theme has one style by default which is light or dark, right? So only the inverse style needs to be added. By default UIkit has very light backgrounds and dark text colors. This means it only needs to implement uk-light(to get light text colors, for dark backgrounds).\nIf you set the offcanvas bar to dark Nothing gets extended because your theme has dark colors by default. So you don't need extra CSS to get dark text colors for your offcanvas bar.\nIf you design a dark theme\nIn dark themes you have dark backgrounds and light text colors. So the inverse component should implement uk-dark (to get dark text colors, for light backgrounds).\nTo do so, you have to define the needed inverse color of your theme. By default it's set to @inverse-global-color-mode: light;. For a dark theme just set @inverse-global-color-mode: dark;. Now the your offcanvas bar would extend the uk-dark (which makes sence if you have a white offcanvas bar in a dark theme.)\nHope this explanation helps a bit.... The Slider component is now available in UIkit 3.. The Slider component is now available in UIkit 3.\nWe won't make a vertical mode.. Best way to modify the UIkit style is to create and compile your own theme. Here is the doc https://getuikit.com/docs/sass\nWhen done just add 2 lines of code to make the offcanvas white:\n```\n@offcanvas-bar-background: #fff;\n@offcanvas-bar-color-mode: none; \n````\nDid it work?. @aarongerig No, sorry, it's currently not resolved. But can be with a little work. We've put it on the todo list \ud83d\ude03. uk-button-ghost has the style in the name. Then we could have uk-button-gradient or even uk-button-blue. The clue in UIkit is, that the button class does not contain any style related naming. It's uk-button-default to indicate the standard button or uk-button-primary to indicate a primary action.. Where did you find the link?. @luxlogica answer is \ud83d\udc4d . Just set the divider icon color. To do so add the following code to your custom UIkit theme\nless\n@divider-icon-color:                            @global-border;. Thanks for reporting. Will be fixed with the next UIkit version. Should be fixed with the next release\nPlease take a look at this commit https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/60622f85e8b2c504b67ee02b67d79a719a37a68e\nThere is also a test in the dev branch, see Utility test and uk-cover should also work.\n. Ah, I misunderstood. Currently, it is not solved for the viewport but if the video is hidden and shows up. But depending on the viewport could be added later.. I think it won't what you call \"take over\". Both fit great for different use cases. \nBuilding a grid with flex works great for a CSS framework because you can have all kind of modifier classes like different widths, etc. At first sight, a useful implementation of grid into a CSS frameworks looks harder. We have to think more about what would be the best way to do it.\nIn the meantime lets see what other CSS frameworks come up with regarding grid.\nBut one thing for sure, it won't replace the current grid built with flex. . Hi, thanks for the feedback \ud83d\ude04 \nWhy would we need to refactor UIkit? The classes are named fine. The errors you found, are the theme classes. They have a different name space tm-. And some custom JS related classes namespaced with js-. Both are not part of UIkit.\nWhat do you suggest?. Yes, the overlap modifier needs to be implemented by the custom UIkit theme. Here is an example how to do it (Overlap image has to be an SVG in this case):\n``` less\n// Overlap image\n@internal-section-default-overlap-image:            ;\n@internal-section-muted-overlap-image:              ;\n@internal-section-primary-overlap-image:            ;\n@internal-section-secondary-overlap-image:          ;\n@internal-section-overlap-height:                   0;\n.hook-section-overlap() when not (@internal-section-overlap-height = 0) {\n&.uk-section::after,\n& > .uk-section::after { height: @internal-section-overlap-height; }\n\n& + .uk-section { position: relative; }\n\n& + .uk-section-default::before,\n& + .uk-section-muted::before,\n& + .uk-section-primary::before,\n& + .uk-section-secondary::before {\n    content: '';\n    display: block;\n    position: absolute;\n    top: -(@internal-section-overlap-height);\n    left: 0;\n    right: 0;\n    height: @internal-section-overlap-height;\n    background-repeat: repeat-x;\n}\n\n}\n.hook-section-overlap() when not (@internal-section-default-overlap-image = ~'') {\n& + .uk-section-default::before {\n    .svg-fill(@internal-section-default-overlap-image, \"#000\", @section-default-background);\n}\n\n}\n.hook-section-overlap() when not (@internal-section-muted-overlap-image = ~'') {\n& + .uk-section-muted::before {\n    .svg-fill(@internal-section-muted-overlap-image, \"#000\", @section-muted-background);\n}\n\n}\n.hook-section-overlap() when not (@internal-section-primary-overlap-image = ~'') {\n& + .uk-section-primary::before {\n    .svg-fill(@internal-section-primary-overlap-image, \"#000\", @section-primary-background);\n}\n\n}\n.hook-section-overlap() when not (@internal-section-secondary-overlap-image = ~'') {\n& + .uk-section-secondary::before {\n    .svg-fill(@internal-section-secondary-overlap-image, \"#000\", @section-secondary-background);\n}\n\n}\n```\nThis won't have any CSS output when compiled. But when you add the following code, it will.\nless\n@internal-section-secondary-overlap-image:          \"my-image.svg\";\n@internal-section-overlap-height:                   20px;\nI hope the code helps a bit to implement it. . We had the same idea when we started but in the end it's more important to keep the framework lightweight and not to add too much stuff which is rarely used. Most the time subtile fade and slide animations are perfect.. @jerry1970 with the latest release we published some new docs and tests which will help you exactly with your question \ud83d\ude04 \nHere are the sticky navbar docs. They include examples for the navbar with the container class.\nAnd here are a lot more sticky navbar test cases which will help you.\n. Unfortunately it's not possible to style checkboxes and radio buttons in Firefox und IE11.\nThere is also a note in the form component.\nless\n/* Radio and checkbox\n * Note: Only works in Chrome, Safari, Opera and Edge\n ========================================================================== */. Unfortunately it's not possible to style checkboxes and radio buttons in Firefox und IE11.\nThere is also a note in the form component.\nless\n/* Radio and checkbox\n * Note: Only works in Chrome, Safari, Opera and Edge\n ========================================================================== */. @Septdir \ud83d\ude35 \ud83d\ude48  Whut?! I'm pretty sure we tested it and something didn't work. But you are right, looks fine for me! Thanks \ud83d\ude04  If nothing comes up, it will be included in the next release https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/d67f4a3b7610d862ac722ae84b6c005cad2cd88a. Mmmh, uk-child-width-1-1 does not exit because that's the default grid behavior. There is no need for this class when using the grid. That's why it doesn't exist and is left out in the docs here.\nuk-child-width-1-1@s to @xl exist and are needed. In the docs for Responsive Width the actual width is left out, e.g. uk-child-width-*@s.\nSo, what do you suggest to improve the docs?\n . So, you want to have only 3 items per row for medium and larger viewports and all items in one row for smaller viewports.\nFor example, if you have 6 items, they are nicely aligned into two rows and on smaller viewports they are squeezed into one row.\nI'm I getting this right? Why would you want that?. UIkit is far from dead. I'm a little shocked you got this impression.\nWe use UIkit 3 in production a year now and it is really stable. It's just labeled beta because some components from UIkit 2 are missing. We will call it officially stable when the slideshow and dynamic grid components are ready.\nWe are currently working on the slideshow and on removing the jQuery dependency.. Thanks! Please only include files you have added or changed in your pull request. This pull requests includes changes from UIkit itself which are already commited.. Thanks for reporting. It's working for me. Anyone else have this issue?. Thanks, fixed https://github.com/uikit/uikit-site/commit/9cb2fdd6df1cd799c80ec7f29582d665e0b58e54. Thanks. We thought, that it's a feature that you still can select text \ud83d\ude09 . The new Slideshow component is now an image slideshow only. This decision was made because of the animation effects between slides. The fade, scale, pull and push animations all require a completely opaque and covering area (like an image) otherwise they would look good. Also we don't need to take care of the height because all slides should have the same height.\nThe new Slider component mentioned by @aarongerig will be the same like Slider in UIkit 2.\nWhat you are looking for is our Switcher component. It allows to switch between content tabs.\nDoes this help you?. @george-kar @viocassel Support for previous and next buttons is already there. See documentation\n<a href=\"\" uk-switcher-item=\"next\"></a>\n<a href=\"\" uk-switcher-item=\"previous\"></a>\nI noticed the markup may not work the same like for the slideshow. We have to test it. But it can easily be fixed.\nPlease let us know all requirement for the text slider.\n. There  is one already called receiver. It's missing in the docs. I will add it.. Sure, UIkit will adopt CSS grid but one note: That doesn't mean flexbox is bad. Flexbox is for 1-dimensional grids and Grid is for 2-dimension grids.... It will be included in the next release. See d175d1c04aba3f5b8f6bdec705bb8c7bf1d5098e\nDocs will also be updated.. The next release will have this feature on board \ud83d\ude09  The documentation will reflect that. Coming in the next days..... As far as I know 100vw (like in the proposed solution) does not take the scrollbar into account. Is that issue solved?. @TomS- Thanks for the example.\nHere is the vertical scrollbar I meant. . Thanks! It's fixed now.. Thanks for you suggestion! Progress pies have a very low priority for us at the moment. May be some else can step in and create one?. You can do this with UIkit already. All font-sizes are in rem units. So you can start scaling your typography. Other element variables can easily be overwritten with rem units. Just create your own UIkit theme.\nThere are different ways to implement responsiveness. One of them is using rem but there are others too. We want to keep UIkit as clean as possible. Therefore, we leave it to the developer what solution is best for him.. At the moment, the uk-overflow-auto attributes also sets a min-height of 150px.. That's on purpose. It's only one of the inverse classes implemented. By default the theme as a text color. It's dark. Therefore, only uk-light is implemented. If the theme is a black one with light text color then the theme has to implement uk-dark and not uk-light.. Fixed a8936702620142baeb9af078e859107c9e584e40. Thanks for reporting. This iOS bug (iframe width + scrolling) is really hard to fix. I'm sorry to say, that we don't have any solution at the moment \ud83d\ude15.. You test is not working for me. Using CSS selectors for the animation should work in all browsers. Here are 3 selectors for all 3 states:\n```css\n/ Initial state: Image hidden (because to hide alt text) /\nimg:not([src]) { visibility: hidden; }\n/ Placeholder state: Image is not loaded, yet /\nimg[src^='data:image'] { ... }\n/ End state: Image shown (Placeholder is replaced) /\nimg[src]:not[src^='data:image'] { ... }\n```\nDon't worry about the HTML validation. It's absolutely fine. The HTML is valid as soon as the JavaScript is executed. No issue here.. Thanks, fixed 6f768b746cd4d222865e524c283830eb7201f0bc. Hi Jan, UIkit is far from dying. I'm a little shocked you got this impression. Active development never slowed down since we started UIkit 5 years ago. Let's take a look at the stats:\nSince the first UIkit 3 release \u2013 20 month ago, there is nearly one commit every day and we released a new UIkit version every 12 days. That's pretty active, right? There were also some really big feature releases:\n\nMay 2018: Masonry, Filter and Lazy Loading Image components\nJanuary 2018: Slider component\nOctober 2017: Slideshow component and remove of jQuery\nand so on ...\n\nWith the latest big release in May, UIkit got feature complete and RC status. Internally, the UIkit code is stable over a year. We just wanted to wait till all the features are on board before we release a stable version. So the stable release will happen in the near future. Please follow our blog posts about UIkit, to see what's coming next.\nIf you want to help the project, you are more than welcome. Please let us know which suggestions you think are left behind and what you got in mind for UIkit. You can do it here or reach me in the UIkit community chat. I'm always online.... > Thanks for your reply, Sascha! We following UIkit development long time, and in meantime UIkit changed its status to RC some other frameworks were released, which got more popular from start than Uikit (see Bulma for example). And that is very sad.\nI agree that we could do more marketing for UIkit, but I don't agree that the current feature set of UIkit is responsible in any way.\n\nWhat is sad also, that you're adding new features and removed old which were on v2 (autocomplete, calender,...). As for now there is always need to load third party libraries to got same functionality as one was with v2 out of the box. A lot of months passed and those are still not there. Core functionality was wiped in flavor of new features (which are also good too).\n\nAll components in UIkit 3 are completely rethought from from scratch. We could do that because we actually need them ourselves and we have many examples of use, so we can test them. That's why we dropped 5 components in UIkit 3: Nestable, Autocomplete, HTML editor, Date- and Timepicker. They were introduced in UIkit 2 because we needed them for our Pagekit CMS. They are components which are used in admin UIs and are normally beyond the scope for a common front-end framework like UIkit. It would take a huge amount of time to rethink them from scratch. Furthermore, you would use Vue or React to archive similar functionalities.\n\nWe also regulary check your blog, but... last post from \"January 11, 2018\". So, what should new users see there? Nothing new since over half a year. What will user think while seeing that? Dead.\n\nAs I mentioned before, the latest blog post is from May 15 and really had huge features on board (Masonry, Filter and Lazy Loading Images).\n\nIf you check the stats yourself, you will notice that contributions amount is decreasing from month to month. That is also not a good sign.\n\nI checked the stats and, as I mentioned, we have one UIkit release every 12 days. If that's not active what else?. The decreasing contributions are because UIkit 3 is feature complete. We are just fixing bugs. So we are now researching stuff for UIkit 4.\n\nYour mentioned \"really big feature releases\" are also not that big if you compare them with v2. They were already there, got rewritten to fit v3 requirements. So, are those really that big? May be, but nothing new.\n\nAll components in UIkit 3 are completely rethought from scratch. We started like there is no UIkit 2. Just take a look at the code or check the features... Every line of code changed between UIkit 2 and 3. I would consider this really big.\n\nSo, and there is the good point. No one know what are those features. How to contribute if we don't know what are you trying to build?\n\nThe roadmap is always in flux. If you want to help, please get in touch with the developer team using the common channels. You can propose things and start working on them.\n\nI'm not trying to shit-post or to blame anyone, just want to know what will happen to uikit next time.\n\nThat's absolutely fine. Please don't forget to let us know which suggestions you think are left behind and what you got in mind for UIkit.\n. PS: Regarding the Date- and Timepicker. Why not use the native browser implementations? Here is the Datepicker and here the Timepicker. @cookmscott Thanks \ud83d\ude0a. Thanks for reporting! \ud83d\ude03 I've got three things:\n\n\nThe commit https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/66c0d9b96d9d96703e37c2eb9cd6ef50fa9bb5d9 fixed inline SVG images (<svg>) not being responsive like normal images (<img>). This if fine and a must have.\n\n\nThe icons in the Iconnav are not shrinking like images in the Thumbnav would do. I fixed it with this commit https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/5d4bc8f043ed0265de7bcf3e59f2aff5ec4304e9. In your example the icons should now shrink without the max-width.\n\n\nTo make icons in the Iconnav (or images in the Thumbnav) not shrink, add uk-preserve-width to the ul element.

Fixed in https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/a2bbfc83b392401ba0e22370c2e7990a3993312f. @piotr-cz Yes, should be fixed with the mentioned commit.\n@JeremieD Please reopen if not. Which iOS and Safari version are you using?. @ecksite You can also deactivate the inherited color by setting the color mode for each card to dark.\n```css\n@card-primary-color-mode: dark;\n@card-secondary-color-mode: dark;\n```\nIt will disable the inverse mode for both card modifier and you don't need to use uk-preserve-color.\nLearn more about it (the inverse component) here https://getuikit.com/docs/less#disable-inverse-component\n. Unfortunately, the width is needed in Firefox to fix text wrapping if the content is larger than 50% of the container (See UIkit test to the right). \nJust nest a child element and add the needed width there.\n. The test works for me in Safari 12. Can you described what's broken? https://getuikit.com/assets/uikit/tests/leader.html. Works for me in Firefox 65 on macOS. To add a little history: When we started UIkit, we also thought about the ui- prefix but it was already taken by jQuery UI. See the buttons component. And most likely, they are not the only ones using it. Overall, uk- does the better job being conflict free, which is the main reason of using a prefix...\nBut as @aarongerig said, you can change it to what ever you want \ud83d\ude09\n. We are aware of this. It's currently not supported by Firefox. Here is the filed bug report.. ",

    "schinckel": "You can easily prevent this scroll back to the top by removing the position: fixed; from .uk-offcanvas-page.\nUnless this is performing something else that I'm not aware of.\n. My workaround was just to use:\n.uk-offcanvas-page {\n  position: static;\n}\n. Yeah, I\u2019ve been playing around with other ways of doing it, like using CSS transforms, but they aren\u2019t perfect either.\n. You can get this behaviour by listening for the uk.tab.change event, and handling that. I'm using it to load content via AJAX.\n. That's a fairly dismissive comment: care to share how you think it could be done? I'm currently having to run a patched version of UIkit, it would be nice to run vanilla. \n. For context: I'm using the Tab controller to load content using AJAX when the tab is changed.\nBecause I load the whole page with the initially selected tab selected, and the data for that tab, I don't want to fire the ajax event during the init of the tab controller.\nThe other part is related to needing to know the previously selected tab item - basically when I have two-level tab controller, I want to be able to keep the selection in the second-level tab, which means I need to extract parts of the URL from the previously selected item (since the active tab has already changed by the time this event fires).\n. For what it's worth: bootstrap has evt.relatedTarget which points to the previously selected tab.\n. JQuery .serialize() only works if your elements have a name and a value: which makes sense, when you consider that is also the data that would be sent when you submit a form normally in a browser.\n. JQuery .serialize() only works if your elements have a name and a value: which makes sense, when you consider that is also the data that would be sent when you submit a form normally in a browser.\n. Hmm. This doesn't seem to be solvable with the current structure - the mouseover event sets this.selected, which is then used by the select method.\n. Any feelings on this?\n. There is already a facility that allows adding extra items to the dropdown: in the code I was working on today, I needed to be able to clear the date picker value, and created an item in the dropdown to do this.\nHaving [data-date=\"\"] worked, but there is a warning when doing this in chrome (that the format is incorrect).\nThis works around this warning by setting the value to \"\" instead of \"Invalid date\".\n.

And NOW they added their own CMS on top of that... They need to hire more people or focus their efforts. Everything they do is awesome, but as a longtime customer I'm disappointed with each project because they put a lot of potential in everything but since they are spread too thin you lose out on new features, bugfixes, better support, etc. that I feel they could pay more attention too if they weren't into so many different things.\n.

We've played around with the grunt tasks and simple search/replace works pretty well for the plain syntax differences.\nHowever, because LESS has late/lazy binding of variable values and hooks and SASS does not, we need to restructure the complete code base.\nRight now, one component can overwrite a value that is used above, even in the core components. This is why styling works so well. With SASS, we have to make sure that all values are set before they are being referenced for the first time and that nothing overwrites them throughout the CSS generation (because then it will use one value at first and then the second value for all later references).\nThis is the reason why a SASS port isn't as straight forward as I thought at first. But yes, it's on the roadmap. :)\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Great job, love that this is a possibility with Grunt!\n. This was proposed in https://github.com/uikit/uikit/pull/539\n. Agree - options that could go along with that feature request would be to specify a min/max year (and possibly month). If we allowed people to enter in data, I'm assuming the false data fallback would be to go to the date that was selected previously.\n. Thanks Artutr. Appreciate you guys thinking this one through. Would be hesitant to think that border-box would not be considered \"default\" nowadays and it'd be easier to adjust 2nd party scripts to adhere (which would be a simple reset within them). I can always add that in myself, just food for thought :)\n. A great article came out on CSS Tricks about a \"different\" way of thinking about global box-sizing.\n\nThe difference here is enabling it by default, but allowing for components to override (and anything within it inherit the top-level box-sizing declaration. The other \"win\" part of this is less duplication throughout the areas that we need to currently \"re-declare\" border-box support.\n. I'd really like to recommend checking out this article that I mentioned in my previous reply --- it would trim down the number of times you need to call box-sizing and any other components that need it would be able to override it very easily.\n. Sorry about that, I'll try that again.\n.

You're using an old version of UIkit\n2. You're trying to support a browser that isn't supported.\n\nI'm not sure where we'd go from here - if you use Selectivizr, RespondJS, and EMAC Polyfill, that'll get you support for IE8 (for the most part), but the on method was added in jQuery 1.7 so I'd make sure you're using at least that... IE8 supports that just fine though (make sure you're not using jQuery 2.x as that doesn't have IE8 support).\n. And that's with nothing else in your project? No other libraries or plugins? I've seen some reports that older versions of jQueryUI can cause such an error.\n. I'd still want the content available just positions relative --- I guess I could just use !important selectors to override the behavior, think a destroy method would be useful.\n. Thanks @aheinze Is there a way to then \"de-sticky\" the element? I'd like to continue to watch it so it calculates the dimensions it needs (as well as wrapping the element and/or removing the inline styles it attaches) depending on screen-size. Thanks.\n. You're on a roll man! Really appreciate this addition, completely changes the game!\n. It looks like the current update method is only firing on scroll, but what I think would also be useful would be the width/height recalculations on resize.\n. Nice, didn't notice you snuck this in! So it looks like this resets it back to the defaults (before it's \"stickied\"), so if they're half-way down the page and resize, does it reset and then immediately re-figure the dimensions it needs to be? Thanks again!\n. Awesome!\n- Zach Schnackel\n\nOn Jul 3, 2014, at 10:47 AM, Artur notifications@github.com wrote:\nyepp, that's the way it works :-)\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. There isn't any JS components for a carousel at this time, just the UI components behind it. If you do want something that's light-weight and configurable, I'd personally suggest http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/\n. What are you expecting to happen? grunt builds the projects and then grunt watch will watch the project for changes and compile them as needed.\n. Do you have a question? All I see is what you copied from the docs.\n. I think you'd be better off adding these yourself; http://brandcolors.net/ shows there's quite a few that people may want to include ;)\n. Definitely agree. Lots of nice utilities that are needlessly replicated because we may not know all the inner-workings.\n. Ah, looks like line 50 of tooltip.js is the offender:\n\nbodyoffset = $('body').offset()\nBelieve we should be checking $('html').offset() as that is the highest element on the page that can have styles attached to it; like margin/padding.\n. Not sure what happened with this pull request, but the \"Warning button\" commit is the piece you want if you just want to manually merge over.\n. Awesome, thanks so much!\n. Will be in the upcoming version, no release date announced as of yet.\n. It shows you... {media: 640}\n. Appreciate your thoughts on that, thanks @aheinze \n. As a quick follow-up to that, if we did want to manually access settings (either onload and change defaults or possibly in the case here where I'd be checking on window resize), how would we override core setting vars? I think that'd be great to add to the docs as well. Thanks!\n. +1\n. Shouldn't the /dist be added to the git ignore file; not sure how I'd avoid that when submitting a pull request unless I manually delete that folder each time.\n. Awesome thanks!\n. Makes sense, I've added a few pull requests the right way ;)\n. Not saying this wouldn't be a good idea, but are you not using Grunt/Gulp for your build process? If you're talking about only loading the CSS/JS you need, then Grunt/Gulp would be exactly what you want, so you can take full advantage of LESS variables/mixins to keep your styles as small as possible.\n. Interesting - if we put in a check for off-canvas then that'd create an edge-case between the two components - but since they're both core would that be alright?\n.

Kick-ass, thanks!\n. I think a possible solution would be to add a callback function or element that it should match for the offset. That way, you can set it to whatever you need. You could either do the media check there, or add a media option to the smooth scroll element and specific callback functions within that.\n. https://github.com/uikit/uikit/pull/555 Is the first part of that (not the name, but the unicode maps themselves)\n. I'm also seeing the same for \"Almost Flat\"\n. Can also confirm; the input should be updated upon both exit of the datepicker and the selection of a day.\n. @brunopacola There isn't one.\n- Zach Schnackel\nOn Aug 24, 2014, at 12:53 AM, brunopacola notifications@github.com wrote:\nI would suggest the availability of the UIKit 3.0 in .PSD\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n.

Have a use-case for that for when tooltips need more feedback/interaction.\n. ParsleyJS has always been a viable option for me -- here is a demo I did that integrates it with floating labels (some base UIkit styles in there)\n. Already in core.\n. I have a starter theme, Basey that does exactly that. Look in /inc/menus.php\n. There really needs to be a config option added to stop the \"stickiness\" at/before another element on the page\n. I added one in https://github.com/uikit/uikit/pull/539 but it has yet to be merged.\n. @aheinze I don't think the height should be calculated on page-load until the item is \"stickied\" and should be re-checked based on resize; since an elements content can wrap based on how wide the screen is.\n. This is what I currently have to do on resize to make sure text doesn't wrap and change width calculations of the uk-sticky-placeholder:\n\n// Recalculate UIkit sticky component placeholder on resize (doesn't do this in the core... yet)\nfunction reCheckSticky() {\n    $('.uk-sticky-placeholder').css('height', $('.uk-sticky-placeholder > [data-uk-sticky]').outerHeight());\n}\nwin.on('resize', UIkit.Utils.debounce(reCheckSticky, 200));\n. Actually it'd need to be more like this because you could have multiple instances on a page:\n```\nfunction reCheckSticky() {\n    $.each($('.uk-sticky-placeholder'), function(index, val) {\n        var $instance = $(val);\n    $instance.css('height', $instance.children().outerHeight());\n});\n\n}\nwin.on('resize', UIkit.Utils.debounce(reCheckSticky, 200));\n```\n. Thanks man!\n. Did you read about the dom observe change in their release post? http://yootheme.com/blog/2014/08/18/uikit-29-released\nI personally added data-uk-observe to the body element (which I believe should revert to the default behavior) since so much of my application is always moving around.\n. Here is the template utility they use -- so I think ^ would be what you need in your case.\n. Awesome man appreciate it! I'll let you know how that goes.\n. Dupe of https://github.com/uikit/uikit/pull/561 - but I believe they may be reworking a few things with the icon-font in general; would be good to get cleared up in the meantime though.\n. I believe there could be an issue with the z-index value of the datepicker and modal (since they are both appended onto the DOM), we'll want to make sure the datepicker has the highest z-index available.

Hey @aheinze want me to separate this out? The amount of 3rd party libraries used in UIkit is obviously pretty slim, but feel this is something we could introduce bower_components into if necessary.\n. Where are you looking? All compiled files are stored in the Bower repo\n. If I change it to \"date\" then it does indeed use the default mobile option, but the datepicker itself still shows up randomly as well.\n. I'm not seeing anything in the 2.12.0 release in the datepicker specifically that may have caused this; so something outside of that may be the issue.\n. Thanks man!\n. Datepicker is unfortunately still failing horribly on the demo site\n. You'll have to be more specific on what you're even referring to.\n. They won't be supporting something that old; but you can use Selectivizr and respondJS to get you part of the way there -- and then grab any other EMAC5 polyfills needed as they pop-up in the console for unsupported features.\n. Nice! Appreciated as always -- elegant solution.\n. I like https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/gulpfile.js#L529-L542 but how does that work for using it within a gulp task like the following:\n\ngulp.task(\"styles\", [\"prefix\"], function() {\n  return gulp.src(\"assets/css/src/app.less\")\n  .pipe(less())\n  .pipe(gulp.dest(paths.styles.build))\n});\nSo here I'm pulling in a central Less file and compiling from there. What I'd like to do though is prefix \"all\" Less files (what the app.less file imports) and be able to reference extends or selectors like this:\n.bt-button-special { &:extend(.uk-button all); }\nTo this:\n.bt-button-special { &:extend(.bt-button all); }\nBut the above would still know to grab uk-button.\nRight now I have:\ngulp.task(\"uikitprefix\", function() {\n  return gulp.src(\"bower_components/uikit/src/less/**/*.less\")\n    .pipe(replace(/(uk-([a-z\\d\\-]+))/g, 'bt-$2'))\n    .pipe(gulp.dest(\"assets/css/src/testuikit/\"));\n});\nWhich solves the prefix issue, but wanted to see if there was a better way going about it. It's one of the reasons I liked actually doing this in Less than in the gulp task, because right now it's separated logic.\n. At the very least it is odd how the formatting options appear when switching to Preview mode, even though their interactions are useless at that point. Think structurally that component could use a rethink.\n. Also thinking about this for Widgetkit. Think if you didn't have to choose between a type of widget --> everything is a \"combo\" widget and you build what you want your Widgetkit instance to be. So if you want a gallery, twitter box and slideshow in one, you've got it.\n. Very cool! Let me know if you need any help testing.\n. They've already responded to this in https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/560#issue-39799578\n. I'd check out the changelog -- the event names changed so you'll want to run through what you're using and match up the latest and greatest.\n. An option to this I'd also like to see is instead of collapsing everything, put the items that would break the layout into a bucket, called \"More\". That'd be extremely useful for varying content lengths.\n. Agree as well\n. I had also mentioned this before and would greatly prefer it.\n. I had also mentioned this before and would greatly prefer it.\n. Hey @saschadube,\nAppreciate the reply. The easiest way for me to explain the reasoning is how UIkit is used in my typical setup as an abbreviated example:\n```\n    // app.less\n/ 1\nI pull in the core button component from UIkit /\n@import \"/bower_components/uikit/src/less/button\";\n/ 2 \nSince the core doesn't provide any sensible defaults for global variables, \nI pull the almost-flat version of the button component to give me some global \nvariables to work with /\n@import \"/bower_components/uikit/themes/almost-flat/button\";\n/ 3 \nIf I then have project specific overrides for the button component, I create \na button.less file in a uikit folder in my src files to keep the logic of what's \ninteracting with UIkit and what's my custom styles separate for clarity /\n@import \"uikit/button\";\n/ 4\nAny custom styles that are not UIkit specific go here /\n@import \"global\";\n```\nAs you can see, I have a \"multi-layered\" inheritance system going on here. Why don't I just copy over almost-flat and build from there? Simple, to keep my sanity. I'm one for keeping up to date with UIkit as it changes and evolves. If I were to copy over the almost-flat theme over to my own folder, then when an update occurs, I'll have a mess to go through to figure out what vars were changed or added specific to that theme, instead of inheriting from sane defaults.\nThis is just another example of why the default theme should be in the core. Think about how much smaller gradient and almost-flat would be if they don't \"re-override\" core variables that should be globalized by default, and only include the UI elements they need to override. Also maintenance of not only these separate themes, but your WordPress & Joomla products would be dramatically simplified because you wouldn't be reinventing the wheel each time.\nIf that was done, then there'd be no need to add themes to the bower distro, because sane defaults would already be there. This next part is only said as an example, but it's for good reason that Bootstrap and Foundation do this by default -- it's because the layer of complexity that is added by having this core setup with no real-use of the power of LESS turns into a dependency nightmare.\nI sincerely hope you consider the comments above in hopes of a natural progression of making UIkit have saner, smarter defaults with not only just end-users, but maintenance to all parties involved much easier.

I don't see anything in that commit that would sync up their selections in the thumbnav component to lightbox attributes, so I think that's the part that's missing still. Either manually setting a thumbnail nav to match the amount of items that are available in the lightbox, or by passing a data-uk-thumbnail attribute onto each lightbox item (to manually create the thumbnav) would be pretty sweet.\n.

There was talk about SVG icons (as a sprite possibly) replacing the icon fonts for better rendering, I've personally got an SVG set working within my app -- will see if I can get with them on ways they can also integrate.\n. @robertotremonti Since icon fonts are rendered as just that, \"fonts\" -- you'll always deal with aliasing issues across different browsers. SVGs have a consistent rendering appearance among others. CSS Tricks has a good comparison article.\n. Could you expand on a real-world application for something like this? I have never seen anything like this used...\n. This isn't really a UIkit question as much as it is a YooTheme/Joomla question -- you may want to ask on their support forum.\n. If you look in the Developers part of the README, it tells you how to download the UIkit repo locally and run it. Inside of those folders, is a working Customizer page; which is obviously great for you, since it's a working example you can build off of.\n. Thanks @malles - added.\n. @malles Think that's also something that needs to be addressed -- I use Autoprefixer in all my projects without any issues, they've moved it in and out a few times now and I think this is another use-case of it just not being needed.\n. @aheinze I appreciate the response. The only thing I could respond to with that is the idea that border-box has become all but a standard in web development nowadays. content-box brings us back to the days of IE7 support where width calculations were an utter nightmare.\nI can fully understand that UIkit doesn't want to step on the toes of any existing styles that are going on in a page, but think that this one is more a sanity check of what is assumed to be the proper defaults nowadays. content-box is basically a left-over from darker days in web dev. I'd appreciate at the very least a quick poll to see who would be opposed to this. Thanks as always man!\n. @krzksz That's what mine does...\n. @saschadube I'm happy to amend this to get it up to speed with the current develop branch, but believe there is great value in assuming border-box by default and letting 3rd party components (or UIkit's when needed) override that behavior.\n. @saschadube @aheinze Where do we stand on the discussion of simplifying UIkit's base style set? We need smarter defaults, taking advantage of CSS pre-proecessors as they are done in the themes themselves.\n. Badass! Thanks man!\n. Could you not just append on whatever notification you need to that dropdown list and then just call dropdown's show() method?\n. Looks like setting the input to readonly when text type is used should work. Disables the native iOS keyboard, but click events still work\n. I agree -- think this could be done with a content-box within the lightbox that says the resource wasn't found. That way, they could still interact with the lightbox without the obstruction. \n. The one you're seeing in Chrome is the native browser datepicker, not UIkit's. I'd make sure you're loading the correct assets. I also wouldn't use date as the type for the datepicker. See this discussion on why.\n. I'm actually testing out the following to see if it helps:\n```\n.hook-modal-misc() {\n.uk-modal-page body {\n    position: fixed;\n    top: 0;\n    left: 0;\n    right: 0;\n    bottom: 0;\n    height: 100%;\n    width: 100%;\n}\n\n}\n``\n. You should be able to just fine without additions -- just add theuk-text-primary` class (for example) to the content within the header/footer.\n. Background classes have been proposed for 3.0 https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/560\n. @robertotremonti You can have one-off conversations with people in Gitter.\n. Good point @mcraiganthony \nI think this also brings us back to the point of https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/461\nWe should have a consistent line-height throughout the system. That would make the system even smaller while having smarter defaults -- just like my border-box discussion.\n. This something I can jumpo on to get it knocked out?\n. You have to handle the actual upload of files yourself. That's what the action param is for.\n. Not that I can see in the script -- could be a server-upload issue.\n.

It's kept things lean, mean and focused. Think the core of UIkit being written in a BEM style would be a fantastic compliment.\n@krzksz gave a great example there too. \n. Awesome thanks man!\n.

I had also brought this up so the YooTheme team doesn't have to worry about prefixing their src code -- let Autoprefixer do that in the build-step.\n. I've never had that -webkit-box show up -- I'd make sure your Autoprefixer is up to date.\n.

I think the use-case for this isn't as common as the already in-use attributes available, but what I would like to see is all of these grid-sizes in separate files so we can include what size of the grid-system we require for our project. This way, if there are the common use-case of your size needed, it's easy to plug into the system. cc @aheinze @saschadube \n. It will not, no. You can use some polyfills like RespondJS and Selectivizr to get part of the way there with their selectors and grid system, but too many of its JavaScript components depend on features that are not compatible with IE8.\n. Yeah, I did a combo of that and added on my own modifier class:\n```\n.uk-flex-medium {\n    @media (max-width: @breakpoint-small-max) {\n        .uk-flex-wrap;\n    > * {\n        width: 100%;\n    }\n}\n\n}\n```\nCan see how this could get a bit messy with all the modifier classes that come with Flex already, but the one above is pretty minimal.\n.

There's plenty of alternatives that UIkit (or any other framework) would just be reinventing the wheel for.\n. I realize it may seem like a very common use-case since you may be trying to use something like that in a current project perhaps, but it is a rather specialized case. I've never had the need for this myself as the programming language can handle truncating this for me before the final output. Since this issue is closed there's no need to beat this into the ground anymore.\n. Could see something like that working well with a generic pop-over component\n. Thanks, appreciate it!\n. Can you try adding box-sizing: border-box to your custom tooltip styles? This is another reason why border-box should be the default cc @aheinze @saschadube but that should help for now.\n. A CodePen would be more helpful so we can see it visually and try to help debug.\n. That looks exactly how it should. I think what you are trying to do is show the navigation in an off-canvas menu -- you don't have any of the required DOM to do so. Please read through the documentation again. If you're just trying to toggle the menu, you'd want to apply a different style to the UL than what you have -- otherwise it'll still look how you have it.\n. Of course, always happy to help. To be perfectly honest on what you're missing, I'd just be regurgitating what the docs mention, so I'd recommend just running through those again for each individual component. The docs are quite good, so just start with copying the HTML examples that are there and then start modifying to your needs.\n. I've also tried manually re-initting scrollspy with no luck on this AJAX'd content:\nif $('img[data-src]').data 'sticky'\n  $('img[data-src]').data('sticky').check\nelse\n  UIkit.scrollspy($('img[data-src]'), UIkit.Utils.options(\n    repeat: true\n  ))\nreturn\n.

The second one you mentioned is working great --- but obviously fails for browsers that don't support MutationObservers. Working on a fallback for ones that don't with https://gist.github.com/stucox/5231211 Will let you know if anything comes of it.\n. @malles Completely forgot about trying UI.init() because I was on an older version. Thanks for the heads up with that, seems to be working well!\n. Wonder if we should also start looking into using requestAnimationFrame as described in http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/animations/\n. Resolved via https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/04ed47fc711e22ec6f8600278da6abc3d7350ce9\n. I believe that's the point of uk-icon-bars (the icon font)\n. Do you mean this kind of animation?\n. I've been doing the exact same thing with .uk-hidden-small .uk-visible-medium etc classes for the icon itself. if you need extra borders, or highlights, then just attach a modifier class to it and add it yourself. IMHO it really doesn't make sense to add this to the core because you can use existing visibility classes to do this yourself.\n. Can you explain what vir-form-search is? That doesn't look UIkit related if I'm not mistaken - and if so, wouldn't be added for one-off cases.\n. This doesn't sound like a bug - that's exactly how the icons should display; you're expecting them to work as a \"table-cell\" element instead of the inline element they are. If you want something like what you pictured, then you'll either want to use the Flex component or create a custom list class that adds in left padding to each list item and uses the :before pseudo selector to add-in the icon.\n. It sounds like it's not going to hurt leaving it in, especially if in a way we're \"future-proofing\" the json file for whenever that becomes a reality.\n. Do you mean have the off-canvas open as the main desktop menu and then hide it on mobile? If so -- you'd have to style it specifically on your own for your use-case as it wasn't designed to be used like that.\n. This seems like a rather specific request -- you can build this yourself using sortable's event system:\n$('[data-uk-switcher]').on('show.uk.switcher', function(event, area){\n    console.log(\"Switcher switched to \", area);\n});\nWith the area attribute being mapped to your specific button, you could toggle all other buttons to be uk-disabled and the active one removing that class.\n. Right - you'd fall down into the specific selector you want to modify and only add/remove the uk-disabled class there. The area param returns the current item, but you can still map that to a select and go inside the DOM further.\n. That's more just an element of using Flexbox; like this example. uk-height-1-1 isn't what you're looking for in those inner <div>s, so you'll want to read up on how Flexbox works for the inner children.\n. @aheinze Just to append onto the requestAnimationFrame scroll listener push, it seems like this would be a good time to implement a better throttle/debounce core method by using the above as well as a replacement.\n. Awesome thanks man!\n. What is moodle? Your question honestly sounds more like a general \"how does Less\" work question, rather than specific to UIkit. I'd take a look at the Less docs to help you get started and then this tutorial from UIkit to bring all of your Less knowledge together to working with the framework.\n. Again - your question doesn't sound like it has anything to do with UIkit specifically, more a general Less question, so I don't believe this is the right medium for this type of question.\n. +1 didn't even realize this was happening until you mentioned it. cc @aheinze \n. I actually needed to override the function entirely due to the dynamic nature of my application. Would really appreciate a more reliable solution @aheinze \nUIkit.on('beforeready.uk.dom', function() {\n  return $.extend(UIkit.components.switcher.prototype.init = function() {\n    var $this, active, toggles;\n    $this = this;\n    this.on('click.uikit.switcher', this.options.toggle, function(e) {\n      e.preventDefault();\n      $this.show(this);\n    });\n    if (this.options.connect) {\n      this.connect = UIkit.$(this.options.connect);\n      this.connect.find('.uk-active').removeClass('.uk-active');\n      if (this.connect.length) {\n        this.connect.children().attr('aria-hidden', 'true');\n        this.connect.on('click', '[data-uk-switcher-item]', function(e) {\n          var item;\n          e.preventDefault();\n          item = UIkit.$(this).attr('data-uk-switcher-item');\n          if ($this.index === item) {\n            return;\n          }\n          switch (item) {\n            case 'next':\n            case 'previous':\n              $this.show($this.index + (item === 'next' ? 1 : -1));\n              break;\n            default:\n              $this.show(parseInt(item, 10));\n          }\n        });\n      }\n      toggles = this.find(this.options.toggle);\n      active = toggles.filter('.uk-active');\n      if (active.length) {\n        this.show(active, false);\n      } else {\n        if (this.options.active === false) {\n          return;\n        }\n        active = toggles.eq(this.options.active);\n        if (active.length) {\n          this.show(active, false);\n        } else {\n          this.show(toggles.eq(0), false);\n        }\n      }\n      toggles.not(active).attr('aria-expanded', 'false');\n      active.attr('aria-expanded', 'true');\n      this.on('changed.uk.dom', function() {\n        $this.connect = UIkit.$($this.options.connect);\n      });\n    }\n  });\n});\n. Thanks @aheinze \n. I don't agree with this addition at all -- seems like a bunch of unneeded weight. At the very least, this should be in a cursors.less file as I wouldn't want this included in a core file like utility.\n. Did you happen to remove the slideshow-animations file as well? That's separate from the slideshow JS file.\n. Are you talking about https://github.com/cworreschk/uikit-sass-rails ? We can only support the repo here itself -- if you are getting issues with that repo you need to file an issue there.\n. Can you show me your complete JS tree in the order you are compiling them together?\n. As long as you're loading the core utils in that uikit.js file, then there'd be no reason to receive those errors, as I cannot dupe any errors. I agree the docs could be better on what components depend on what, but I'm not seeing anything from what you've provided that would lend to the idea of there being an issue with UIkit. If you wanted to create a CodePen with your setup, we could try to troubleshoot from there.\n. That's not one better... that's one worse ;)\nI'd want to see the setup in the simplest case possible. Looking at it amongst everything else you have going on isn't helpful.\n. Sorry if I haven't explained myself better, but if you want help with open-source tools, it's best to dumb everything down to a bare minimal example -- take anything else out of the way and recreate what with UIkit, is pretty simple to do via the docs and match them up to what you're trying. In this case, take the slideset example from the docs, put in some dumby text if needed and load the scripts as you have been (but from a CDN so we don't run into potential conflict issues) and from there, we can determine if it's user error or a potential issue with UIkit.\n. +1\n. You could always wrap some additional markup with a <label> to include a flex property that could take care of the indention. You could also attach .uk-text-nowrap to the label, so there would be no overflow if space wasn't available.\n. Not sure what you mean by your own styles as the Flex and Utility components are already in there, so there isn't a need for custom styles. There wouldn't be anything added for this because the functionality is available in at least the two different ways as I mentioned.\n. Sure http://codepen.io/zslabs/pen/waOwrb\n. It'd be far better to implement a progressive lazy-loader for images instead of putting this much bandwidth hogging the server. @aheinze \n. I have also mentioned this, UIkit shouldn't be afraid to have a dependency set as long as their documentation lays out \"how\" to install these, whether it be via Bower or NPM\n. Hi,\nOn http://getuikit.com/docs/lightbox.html at the bottom you'll see an Events section that has a JavaScript trigger you could use to implement functionality once an item was shown. If you're not too strong in JS, then you'd want to get with a JS developer that can help you further with this. This isn't something I see being added to the core because while your usecase is interesting, I'm not sure if that speaks to a larger audience and would cause bloat for those that don't need it.\n. This would be a nice addition to the stackMargin listener.\n. @aheinze Came across this\n. Great addition!\n. @aheinze I believe we ran into this when we were calling Uikit.modal(selector).hide() more times than we were showing it, but if you get to a negative number you're essentially screwed ;)\n. Couldn't we also just use the vertical-align trick?\n```\n.container {\n  position: relative;\n\n.child {\n    position: absolute;\n    transform: translateY(-50%);\n    top: 50%;\n  }\n}\n``\n. I'm going to strongly suggest this is not added - there's plenty of existing solutions out there to get the job done and this is very seldom used nowadays. https://github.com/Diokuz/baron is a decent choice if you're looking for something like this.\n.data-uk-observe` auto inits UIkit components, it doesn't do anything with 3rd party ones. You'd have to hook into:\n\nUIkit.domObserve('#element', function(element) { /* apply on dom change within element */ })\n. Create your own utility class and add the spacing on your desired breakpoint.\n@media (max-width: @breakpoint-small-max) {\n  .padding-top--smalldevices { padding-top: @global-margin; }\n}\n. That'd be a huge rewrite at this point - not sure I personally see the big advantage compared to the time it would take to make that transition. We're talking about 30kb gzipped, which is smaller than most images you'd also have on your site. Maybe you could start a branch and the transition to compare the effort involved?\n. @uikid Ha not sure I get what \"for some cool devs\" means, are you saying jQuery isn't cool? Certainly no need to use jQuery if it's not needed, but remember that UIkit is built by YooTheme, a company that builds commercial Joomla/WordPress themes, both of which depends on jQuery. So -- the reasoning behind using jQuery was most likely a business and familiarity decision - one that I don't see the need of spending a huge amount of time on for little to no gain for their end-goals of the framework. Let's also not forget, https://twitter.com/paul_irish/status/431584056883429376\n. @uikid Totally get it and a good conversation to have. I'm all for anything that'll push UIkit to new levels, we just always have to weigh the benefits of a restructure/rewrite while there's lots of other moving pieces in the framework.\n. https://github.com/uikit/uikit/pull/1552\n. Do you just mean the word-wrap property?\n. .uk-text-break has the hyphens property set to auto, which will cause those hyphens in the word-breaks. What I'd suggest is you just creating another utility class for your own purposes that only has what you need, for example:\n.uk-break-word { word-wrap: break-word; }\n. Is this a question or request? You can already extend and override defaults with something like the following:\nUIkit.on('beforeready.uk.dom', function() {\n  $.extend(UIkit.components.datepicker.prototype.defaults, {\n    format: 'DD.MM.YYYY'\n  });\n});\n. Your reference to the FontAwesome files is probably wrong. If you open up the \"Network\" tab in Chrome, you'll probably see an issue with FontAwesome not finding the correct files.\n. The JS should be doing that for you when it's attached to a \"trigger\". If you manually call the show() method attached to the modal it'll do what it needs to do for visibility and classes.\n. Create a CodePen to show the issue.\n. Create a CodePen to show the issue.\n. That's not how the offcanvas works unfortunately. Even if the DOM could be duplicated, each \"type\" of menu requires different HTML to structure the menu items as they need to be for each.\n. Correct, but if I'm not mistaken, even with Bootstrap you need to duplicate the DOM, even if it is the same in that case. I do agree however while duplicated, the DOM for the menu should be able to inherit off of something a bit more generic found in other components cc @aheinze \n. Meh, I guess this is along the same lines of smarter defaults instead of setting this to normal and then have the default, gradient and almost-flat themes do it \"the right way\" by variabilizing this.\n.

I believe that code prevents scrolling on the main page when scrolling the sidebar so needs to be there at all times. I'll create a pull request for fixing the resize issue.\n. Hi Shoumma, I believe this is intended so text doesn't sit flush again the side of the screen. I very much doubt that this will change in the core. \n. Hi, \nI don't use Yootheme however I do use UiKit. I have this trouble with the websites I build using UiKit. \nThe off-canvas and sticky seems a little buggy. For example if you resize the browser when it's open, it doesn't work out the new width. However most of these problems can be fixed with CSS overrides. \nHere are the CSS declaration I use:\nApply this CSS to the sticky header \n(if it's right aligned)\nleft: auto !important;\nwidth: 100% !important;\n(if it's left aligned)\nright: auto !important;\nwidth: 100% !important;\n. Hi Jerry, I'm struggling to visualise your problem. Are you able to link to me to a live example? It sounds like you are on the right tracks however you will not need to use a sticky with negative top. \n. Hi vj2201, this isn't really a bug report. The off-canvas is part of the core and does not require a plugin. \n. 1 = Scroll speed\n0.4 = Less than scroll speed\n. You are using velocity right? velocity: '0.5'? It's working fine for me on Chrome. \n. Hi aheinze,\nI'm not entirely sure if that's the problem.

Hi choppe, \nI've taken out the sticky nav, however the problem persists. Good guess, however it seems that this isn't the problem. \n. Bump - This problem still exists. Still avoiding Parallax so far because of elements jumping around. I would really like to use the Parallax plugin. \n. @annedorko I'm sorry, no solution as of yet. \n. Hello, \nThis is mostly a windows 8/10 problem, however can be fixed by setting .uk-offcanvas-page width to 100%. \n@aheinze, You may be able to answer me this, why isn't .uk-offcanvas-page 100% by default? setting the width in my experience causes problems, especially when resizing the browser with the offcanvas bar open. However width 100% seems to remedy that.\n. I'm having this issue, on window resize it doesn't recalculate it's width. I've downgraded to 2.23.0 for now.\n. This has been fixed in version 2.24.1\n. No solution I'm afraid. \n. If I recall correctly, using \nleft: auto !important; on that element will fix this. \nThis has been there since I've used UIKit, it's because sticky can be used in columns and therefor needs a left value. \nI would however class this as a bug as everything should move on offcanvas. I can do a push request to fix this. However pull requests rarely get added. \n. This is already functionality? The sticky appears when you scroll up. Use showup: true.\n. For now you can apply left: auto !important on the sticky menu item. It's a frustrating bug that I've come across many times. I've seen it reported many, many times also. \n. Apologies, it was fixed here: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#2250-february-17-2016 \nCompletely forgot to close the issue.\n. bump.

However, you can use triggers to do what you need to do using the module above. . @duyhung85 thanks for confirming this. iOS 10 works fine, everything below is broken. Android as always works great :-) . Maybe it's something relating to this? https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/develop/dist/js/uikit.js#L1095\nUIKit devs can be slow sometimes (as they have so many other projects). I'll see if I can figure something out to help them out. . @duyhung85 found it, comment out line 1110 in UIkit.js it's checking the object is clicked, if not fire a click. However clicked will return false regardless causing click to fire twice on single tap. . No. > Yes, you can use:\n\nUIkit.util.on(document, '.uk-lightbox', 'beforeshow show shown itemshow hide hidden', listenerFunction)\nIt basically does the same though.\n\nThis should be in the documentation - I had to search for a while to find this. \nEDIT: \nDoesn't seem to work?. @aarongerig Thanks, it's not quite working as expected: \n```\nUIkit.util.on(document, 'shown', '.uk-lightbox.uk-open', function(e) {\n    var items = e.target.querySelector('.uk-lightbox-items');\nUIkit.util.on(items, 'click', 'li', function() {\n    UIkit.lightboxPanel(e.target).show('next');\n});\n\n});\nActually does nothing . @zzseba78 did you manage to figure this one out? I've seen another example of\nUIkit.util.on(document, '.uk-lightbox', 'beforeshow show shown itemshow hide hidden', listenerFunction)\n```\nWhich doesn't work either. @zzseba78 \nI can not for the life of me get these to work. \n```\nUIkit.util.on(document, 'beforeshow', '.uk-lightbox', function(e) {\n    var items = e.target.querySelector('.uk-lightbox-items');\nUIkit.util.on(items, 'click', 'li', function() {\n    UIkit.lightboxPanel(e.target).show('next');\n});\n\n});\n```\nAny ideas?. Care to illiterate? If it works on CodePen then it should work for you. Also you'll find that if the bug exists in UIKit you'll also experience it in \"https://getuikit.com/docs/slider\" - make sure you are following the documentation correctly. . For those who want to use .36 and need a fix for this you can use:\nUIkit.modal.dialog(d);\n$(\".uk-modal\").on(\"hide\", function() {\n    $(\"html\").removeClass(\"uk-modal-page\");\n});\nfor jQuery or \nUIkit.modal.dialog(d);\ndocument.querySelector(\".uk-modal\").addEventListener(\"hide\", function() {\n    document.querySelector(\"html\").classList.remove(\"uk-modal-page\");\n});\nfor vanilla. . Recently UIkit dropped support for iOS < 9.1, however as yours is 9.3 I believe this maybe an oversight. There are possible prefixes or JavaScript differences that haven't been accounted for. . @zer0lik I was going to reply saying you could do this in JavaScript by binding a next to the image however it looks like the API doesn't offer any control over that. \nWhich is a massive surprise! Javascript should really offer ways to control the sliders etc.\nUIkit.lightboxPanel(element).to(3);\nUIkit.lightboxPanel(element).next();\nUIkit.lightboxPanel(element).previous();\nShould exist on slider elements etc. \n. @janschoenherr excellent, thanks for clearing that up! Didn't realise \"next\" and \"previous\" were accepted in show().\nSo @zer0lik try doing this:\ndocument.querySelector(\".uk-lightbox-items > li > *\").onclick = () => {\n    UIkit.lightboxPanel(document.querySelector(\".uk-lightbox\")).show(\"next\");\n};. I can't seem to reproduce this.\nI've tried your codepen on Chrome and Firefox (non-nightly) - I was experiencing something like this recently and a fix was pushed.\nIt's possible that this is only happening in the Firefox nightly. . @jsieler I don't know why it was changed, it was changed to apparently fix this bug. However, I like @JoeMac90 am not getting this bug? \nStrange it has different results computer to computer. Maybe it's cached? . @jsieler it might change :'' to :false or :0 . @m0n0mind while this currently isn't a feature of UIKit, you can very easily implement it - https://codepen.io/anon/pen/wpRXYg (Same naming convention as uk-height-viewport) . @saschadube I guess you could do https://codepen.io/anon/pen/MrZzzd \nIf this was to make it into the core though;\nI feel like JavaScript is the most dynamic way to achieve this in case someone wants to change the width of the container without the need to recompile, however it could be the case that a vertical scrollbar will appear slightly before the JavaScript loads. Since UIKit JS is loaded into the head, and since it does all the magic with uk-grid etc. I feel like JavaScript might be the way to go.. @m0n0mind I agree CSS is preferred, it can use the less variables to work it out. It should also check whether it's in a container or not. However, you can't always guarantee that it will be in a container. I still stand by JavaScript is the most dynamic way and means you can put full with elements anywhere if so required.  . One thing I've noticed is the scrollspy items get an empty style tag? I'm not entirely sure why. . @Blinks44 if you don't need to interact with the slideshow at all you can use CSS pointer-events: none on the slider. Otherwise use my code change. No idea why my push request hasn't been looked at. . This is because you use .uk-width-1-3 and .uk-width-2-3. It's all about minimising the CSS used. . ES6 let and const are not full supported by slightly older browsers yet. It would mean bumping the Safari/iOS to 10+. There are many people reluctant to update their OS due to performance issues. Why browsers that update when the OS is updates exist is beyond me. Safari and IE should be dead.\niOS 9 is still at 10% of iPhone users.\nAlso shouldn't it be\nvar el;\nvar placeholder = this.placeholder;\nvar outerHeight = (this.isActive ? placeholder : this.$el).offsetHeight;\nI agree there should be a move to let and const, but I'm not sure if now is the time. . @miljan-aleksic apologies, didn't know that was the case. Yup, I'm all for this change to. . @janschoenherr Amazing, I would say that only answers 1/2 though. \nThere is still:\nlet fs = require('fs'),\n     exec = require('child_process').exec,\n     path = require('path'),\n     util = require('./util'),\n     glob = require('glob');\nWhich doesn't follow the airbnb guidelines (https://github.com/airbnb/javascript#variables)\nlet fs = require('fs');\nlet exec = require('child_process').exec;\nlet path = require('path');\nlet util = require('./util');\nlet glob = require('glob');. Yup, I noticed this too. . https://codepen.io/anon/pen/mXEbjK You should be able to re-instance the sticky component, however, I've tried every single component update and that hasn't worked. The only thing that has is completely re-instancing UIkit. \nI think there may be a bug in the actual component update. . Your link is to localhost, will you be able to put it on CodePen? localhost is a host local to you (not online). . @zzseba78 I noticed this too, I've been experiencing this since Beta 36. . @janschoenherr https://codepen.io/anon/pen/VQPYwd\n(Chrome)\n1. Drag the slider, while it's still fading, drag again.\n2. The animation should fade to white then pop back in. \n3. Repeat dragging until you see the effect. \nI would say do the action of you're trying to get through the slider quickly. If you give time for the animation to run through you don't see the problem as often. . @janschoenherr I've updated the CodePen to have 3 slides, it does still happen but it's much harder to replicate with more than 2 slides.\nMy theory is if you grab it just as it's fading out, it keeps that as the starting animation, as the previous element doesn't exist underneath the opacity is showing white. Once it triggers animation finished, it puts the active slide at 1 opacity the new slide just seems to \"pop\" in. \nEDIT:\nGot a video, found out how to replicate, if you grab the next slide just before the animation finishes you will see the bug - https://streamable.com/t2a27. @janschoenherr I'm afraid not, recompiled the develop branch and it's still happening. I've updated the codepen with the new CSS/JS - https://codepen.io/anon/pen/VQPYwd. @zzseba78 please re-open this. @mbaehr2909 I was expecting this library to be huge, but at 7kb it ain't that bad. Shame UIKit includes all it's modules now rather than being able to choose as I'd prefer this as a module rather than in the core. UiKit as a framework is already getting pretty big.. Hey,\nYou don't really need Ajax for this. You can do this simply by adding the class .open-video to the button you want to open a Modal and give it the attribute data-id=\"youtube-id\".\nHTML:\n<div class=\"open-video\" data-id=\"2UByqalCfnk\"></div>\nJS:\nUIkit.util.on(\".open-video\", \"click\", function (e) {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    e.target.blur();\n    UIkit.modal.dialog('<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/' + e.target.getAttribute(\"data-id\") + '?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>');\n});. https://codepen.io/anon/pen/WzRWQp\nMake sure you stop propagation . @janschoenherr might be worth doing a little check to see if  > 3 li exists, if not turn off center. I'm thinking for CMS's. I know you could do the check in the PHP/Template code and not pass center to UIKit in that case, however, I would say that doing the check in JavaScript would be preferable.. Yeah I could use padding for now. . This is when you set the uk-sticky-placeholder to display none. I have a uk-sticky that will sometimes overlap. This is use-case and used max-height 0 instead. . From what I can see, it's working correctly? It just doesn't look right because you have the height of the card at \"100px\" but you are setting the first li to \"50px\".\nhttps://codepen.io/anon/pen/rrZaBm. That's a shame, is there no plan to change this? What about Masonry is that the same? Because masonry.js has no trouble handling this and it's what I've had to swap to. . @eladnova Hey! I recognise you from the ProcessWire forum! \nHere is a solution you can do in the mean time:\nhttps://codepen.io/anon/pen/GYoxGm\n. @acidrums4 hardly suspicious. I haven't seen your code, but it's the correct way to accomplish this. So that's why both answers would be the same.. @zzseba78 \nTrying to reproduce - I came across another bug - uk-sticky-placeholder does not take the height until the browser is resized: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/XxVRoM\nThe code that I'm using that causes sticky - bottom: true; to fail when bottom is in viewport: \nhttps://codepen.io/anon/pen/aREwyK (Again resizing this fixes it. The issue with Codepen is it always defaults to scrollTop(0, 0). So it's hard to demonstrate). . I believe part of the issue is placeholders in uk-img are generated after uk-sticky is calculated. From what I can tell. Because I have placeholders set up correctly, but sometimes it still displays as 0 height while the image is loading. \nWhile this also happens on RC.16 - I do not experience the issues with calculating sticky: bottom like I do in later versions. . While not documented this has been fixed in RC 20.. @janschoenherr because of this, sometimes if the image isn't loaded instantly, even if cached. It causes undesired effects with things such as scrollspy in terms of appearing in the viewport before it's actually moving into the correct place. So in some cases the animation isn't played when the object comes into viewport as technically it's already been in the viewport.\nIs there any reason why you just don't load in the svg placeholder until image on load? It seems to me like that would make more sense right? Is it a performance thing? . @janschoenherr it's actually becoming a problem when using this with scrollspy. The images do not always load right away, even if javascripts assumes they are cached. Scrollspy will fire because on DOM load element are in viewport as the image hasn't pushed it down. \nThis is completely opposite to what is expected from placeholders. . @janschoenherr \nI'm unsure. Refreshing the same page will be fine. However, if you visit another page and re-visit the previous page (not using the back button but clicking a link) sometimes you will see the images not load in instantly, regardless of the fact that they are \"cached\".\nI appreciate you looking into this, for now I've just removed the check here and always make it generate the svg placeholder. https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/develop/src/js/core/img.js#L68\nThis has a better appearance when loading as the placeholder will always be present and prevent the content jump you see. Even though width and height is defined. It could be the case that isn't getting the width and height of \"cached\" images correctly. I know it also caused other issues in UIKit for example  (https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/3629). This is still an issue in RC 26 sadly. I will apply my fix to the new version also. . Hi @janschoenherr \nI can't seem to replicate this in 3.0.1, has this been fixed? . Actually, tested this. It does not work. . The second one works, however, I'd like it to be specific to the dynamically created lightbox, not all. . @aarongerig Yes I did. I'm providing a reproduction link atm. @aarongerig added reproduction link, had to use my server as UIKit seems to be better at putting a placeholder there while an image is loading if it's external. As you can see there is NO place holder while the image is loading. The background is red so you should clearly see it. . This is still an issue in .23 but works in .16 \nIs there going to be any update on this bug? . @zzseba78 That's what I ended up doing haha. I might keep this open for autoplay however. . @neokio just put something like delay: 50; and that  will fix it. I opted for 200 but I should imagine any number greater than 0 would work . @janschoenherr That could be the issue. What would be the solution in that aspect? I'm using UIkit.util.on in which I need UIKit for, however, if inview is triggered right at that time is there a way that I can load UIKit after my script but not fire until UIKit has loaded? \nEdit: \nAlso, I know UIKit it's better to have the JavaScript in the head part of the website as it makes visual changes to things like grid, which might make content jump around on load. I've always assumed that putting javascript in the footer is better. I normally use UIKit in the head but the rest of my JavaScript on the end of the document. . @evolvens I would argue it's much better for user experience as it's widely adapted.. Also experiencing this\nEdit:\nThis has been broken since 3.0.0 beta 39. @aarongerig Thank you for your reply. Very helpful, I was wondering if you have any example of 4 - 5, I like the idea of using UIKit as a module and extending it from inside my folder structure. I use Gulp so I'm not entirely sure how to include it into my build process. Especially when it comes to JavaScript. I know I can import the less file, but the JavaScript I'm a little loss to. I'm guessing Gulp wouldn't work in this aspect because it's more of a post-processor than a package manager?\nIf I could run yarn install to compile to /assets as you said, which will also include any variable modifications or hooks that seems really clean.. Found easing 0 is linear. Is this intended? If so this is not correct: \nLower values will cause a faster transition in the beginning, higher values will cause a faster transition in the end of the animation.\nDefault is 1, to be faster in the beginning you need negative values. Makes sense to me. Wouldn't it make sense if the default was 0? . ",

This causes issues in Sass. Altering the line order solved the problem.\n. After playing with the themes in both sass and less it seems there are some big limitations in sass.\nMainly these have to do with variable scoping.\nLess' variable scope is fairly loose, which allows it to use variables before they are created. As such if I'm creating a theme I can use variables from the core and components of uikit. In sass however I can only use the variables from my theme itself. \nI'm not sure how best to solve this problem other than separating/duplicating the core/component variable declarations into separate files that could be imported before the custom theme\n. +1 for BEM.\n.

The addition of 12 columns would be a good idea, beyond many divisions are already covered  by the framework in a clever way ( say 1-3 is better than 4-12 ), would make it more friendly to people coming from other frameworks like bootstrap, and add some new divisions that currently can not be achieved (1 -12, 5-12, 7-12, 11-12). Anyway, I think is imperative to add 1-7, 1-8, 1-9, may sound like they are not useful but when you need granular control of the grid size you miss more options.\n. @eladnova Lightbox component it's under development.. @frumbert If you are working with less ( or sass ) you can not import Base component styles, wich have basic tags styling and browser consistency ( Normalize ).\n//@import \"base.less\";\nhttps://getuikit.com/docs/base. try this:\n$(window).resize(function () {\n    var pageWidth = $(window).width();\n        if (pageWidth > 960) {\n        UIkit.offcanvas.hide('#menu-id');\n     };\n});\n.

Works for me, OSX El Capit\u00e1n, Firefox 47.0\n. I read that uikit v3 it\u00b4s planned for release later this year. Seems that they have all the effort in Pagekit right now, considering that they created UIKit for use in their templates i don\u00b4t think they're not working on improving it. Anyway, every month they publish an update and small improve of version 2, Bootstrap announced the V4 since almost 1 year ago and they are not even close to launch it... this things take time.\nSo we have to wait, I think we can expect something really amazing :)\nhttps://yootheme.com/blog/2016/02/25/recap-2015\n. @saschadube AMAZING! \ud83d\udc4d \n. If you apply this it fixes this problem data-uk-slider=\"{infinite:false}\"\nBut, if you want 4 items per row, but if you have only 2 elements to show, the desired behavior would be only show those two, and not repeat them. It looks like an error. \nMaybe the logic behind this is that if you want 4 items p/ row you have al least 4 items to display, but if the site is dynamic ( the client change the content ) this isn\u00b4t alway the case, so, it should loop if there\u00b4s is more items than the definied in the grid for the specified size ( for example, if exist 5 items in a row of 4 ).\n. I think it will be rewrited in v3\n. Here is the place : https://gitter.im/uikit/uikit\nProvide codepen.\n.

I would be nice... maybe it\u00b4s not the best way to organize a site nav structure, but somtimes it\u00b4s useful and neccesary.\n. Hi! I agree with the navigation structure should be kept simple, but the option of indenting navigation should be available for at least two levels in desktop version or tablet. It is not the best, but sometimes it is a requirement. In Material Design is contemplated the multi-level menu, but also warns about using the fewest possible levels.\n\n. I would like a swipe animation in offcanvas too :)\n. Same, not only in the dropdown element... this is happening from version 2.27\n. You mean something like this: https://getmdl.io/components/index.html#chips-section\n\"Represents complex entities in small blocks.\"\n. I think it\u00b4s not. You can use the slider component, but you don\u00b4t have the bullet navigation.\nhttps://getuikit.com/docs/slider.html\n. Can you provide a codepen or uikitplay to check?\n. Yes , it has.\nhttps://uikitplay.com/plays/FXsR\n. Good news! \nUIkit 3 comes with its own SVG icon system\nhttps://twitter.com/getuikit\n. It\u00b4s fixed in version 2.27.2, i\u00b4m gonna close it.\n. Offcanvas men\u00fa can be better, that\u00b4s right, but use css transitions already, triggered by js.\nI think the problem it\u00b4s that , apart from the offcanvas bar, the whole html gets animated ( instead of a content wrapper ), and the property animated it\u00b4s margin and clip ( on reveal mode ) , causing Browser repaints and reflows, instead it should use css transitions and opacity only.. Like one of the Greensock team member says, use the best tool for testing animations performance... your eyes.\nIt doesn\u00b4t looks soft and fluid, and you are right, i think there is room for improvement here.. Do you see that the Offcanvas Slide ( corrected ) mode perform better?\nThe rule in fact it\u00b4s quite simple, animate only transform and opacity properties, modern browser manage this quite well. So, for example, instead of animate left, you should use translateX.\nI don\u00b4t know why, offcanvas in reveal and push mode don\u00b4t use transforms, they animate position intead, and this cause the re-paint. The Slide mode use transforms ( translateX ), and looks softer.\nThere must be a reason why you can not use transforms, one might not play well with other elements (sticky for example), or maybe it makes it difficult to do in the same markup 3 different modes of Offcanvas. UIkit have a great animation component and it uses transforms all the way, so there must be a reason.. Sorry, i should write \"Slide\" Mode, where the content doesn\u00b4t animate ( like in Reveal or Push mode ), only the offcanvas bar.. One question, how do you see the performance of the offcanvas menu in the awwwards website.\nhttps://www.awwwards.com/\nLooks smooth to the eye.. Check this: https://github.com/zzseba78/Kick-Off. Offcanvas has been reworked, closing issue.. Did you type it correctly? it\u00b4s uk-visible@s\n. Lightbox it\u00b4s out and looks great, so i\u00b4m closing this issue.. Done.. Hi! thanks for your response, i will try to crete them!\nP.S. yes,  11-10 doesn\u00b4t seems to be useful size :)\n. Yes, true. The .uk-grid css class it\u00b4s added to the element with js, but if you add the class .uk-gridyourself you avioid this effect.\n<div class=\"uk-grid\" uk-grid></div>\nI always use it.. Same problem here with Beta 7\n. Works only if you call the js scripts in the head, if i put them before closing body tag it doesn't work, and if i put the scripts in the head and use defer it doesn't work.

And if you try this way?\n$('a').on('click', function (e) {\n  UIkit.modal('#my-id')[0].toggle();\n  e.preventDefault();\n});. Still happening in the latest Beta 18. Thanks!. Mmm, i don't see this happen. Some graphics at some sizes can look bad, it happens with svg images too. Try to change the value, did you try on mobile with good pixel ratio?. Yes, offcanvas it's buggy on mobile. And the animation performance it's poor.\nNeeds to be polished. It's labeled as bug already.\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/2216. It works for me, the head stays fixed at the top... i put in the head a red background to see it.\n\nDid you include jquery, uikit js and uikit css file?\n\n. Datepicker and other components from uikit 2 are missing, they will be available later.\n\nOur focus for this release has been to create a stable core and provide extensive documentation right from the start. Next on our list are the Slideshow, Slider, Slideset, Parallax, Nestable, Lightbox, Dynamic Grid, HTML editor, Date- and Timepicker components.\n\nhttp://yootheme.com/blog/2017/01/09/uikit-3-beta-released. It works fine for me, can  you create a codepen to see the code?\nWorking example:\nhttp://codepen.io/anon/pen/pRYLEm\nIf you have questions about using UIkit 3, you can ask the community :)\nhttps://gitter.im/uikit/uikit. Mmm, this is strange, using latest version, but uninstall and re install and same problem. The functionality looks  all broken. Check another websites to check, they work fine. I check if javascript is enabled too, and not in turbo mode. I don\u00b4t get it... \nIn Opera Mini, android 6 all looks fine.\nFrom Fjord Theme\n\nUIkit docs\n\n\n. No, it doesn't look good, icons not showing, none of the code examples are available, grid broken, it doesn't take the full height, etc. It shows some js errors, in uikit site, and in another site that i create with uikit 3, same errors, same files.\n\n\n\n. It's not finished yet. Look for another alternative, it's under development.. It works perfect for me, in Firefox, Chrome, Safari.\nDid the test page works for you?\nhttps://getuikit.com/assets/uikit/tests/navbar.html. Seems like a bug... i see the same with cdn css and js files, it happens with beta 12\n. Sure, they will fix it. It\u00b4s not a bug, uikit remove alias ( redundant proportions ) from the grid, so uk-width-3-6 doesn\u00b4t exist anymore, you should write uk-width-1-2, and with uk-width-2-6 you should write uk-width-1-3... I'ts made to save some space. \nTo me, it slow down the workflow, make you stop to think ( more that you are already thinking ).\nI already ask to bring them back.. Same here +1. Yes, me too @krisj , i'm playing with Pushy, nice and simple script to create offcanvas and seems to play nice with uikit ( not sure if Scrollspy works well on mobile ).\nHere is an example:\nhttp://research.electricmonkey.co/uk3/offcanvas.html. Hi @blue-eyed-devil !\nGood catch! I'm using TouchSwipe, a well known script for touch interactions.\nHere is the example with touch swipe ( close on swipe Left ) implemented on offcanvas bar, some tweaking in the pushy script and when the width is more than 767px the bar get closed ( on resize and orientation change).\nhttp://research.electricmonkey.co/uk3/offcanvas.html. Thanks for label this as a bug, surely you will be able to improve it! \ud83d\udc4d . Offcanvas has been reworked, i will close this issue. Thanks!. There is no such functionality in uikit 3. https://getuikit.com/docs/text\nOf course you can create it with media queries.. There is no such functionality in uikit 3. https://getuikit.com/docs/text\nOf course you can create it with media queries.. Yep.. Yep.. Added on Beta 20, closing this issue, thanks!!. Added on Beta 20, closing this issue, thanks!!. +1 .\nMaybe the close button could be up and right aligned with the content, in order to don't lose space ( adding margins ) on both sides of the modal content.. +1 .\nMaybe the close button could be up and right aligned with the content, in order to don't lose space ( adding margins ) on both sides of the modal content..

Have similar problem with a element with Y negative position, it dissapears like your example, maybe there is way to correct this.... To me seems like it\u00b4s fixed in RC 25. Since Beta 18 the icons are managed with js, did you include the uikit-icons.min.js file?. Fortunately everything evolved...No need for unwanted annoying sounds. Fixed in Beta 19.. Fixed in Beta 19.\n. I think it\u00b4s not on the list.... Switch Component proposal, check it out: https://codepen.io/zzseba78/pen/PxwmeV\nIf you like it and think that something like this could be useful, give it a :thumbsup: and see more here uikit/uikit#3649 and maybe the UIkit team have this functionality in consideration. Thank you.. Thanks for your work!. Same here, only in Firefox. It's like a random error, sometimes happens, sometimes not... To me it happens at any screen size. If you rezise the browser the margin it's added.. Yes, this happens since they released uikit 3, it happens sometimes, and in a specific grid, i mean, all the grids work great, but in one specific grid this error happens randomly. Strange. I double check if everything it's fine and it's is. And it's always in the second row.. I doesn't look like a bug... for me it's more CSS Inheritance.\nTry to be more specific with your css selector to override the uikit style. for example:\n.uk-card-primary.uk-card.body h3.uk-card-title\nOr, you can use the card-header less hook to put there your styles ( best practice )\n.hook-card-header() {\n    ....\n}. Make sure that you have @section-primary-color-mode set to none, because this can cause that your section is inverted by default. \nAnd for this cases, you have Preseve color for not affect the elements inside a section with the color mode\nhttps://getuikit.com/docs/section#preserve-color. The Offcanvas doesn't close on swipe on Android 6 - Chrome and Opera ( even in the docs ).\nIt works on Firefox.\nBeta 19. Well, i think that is the desired effect, imagine that you have 10 rows ( two items for row, 20 items  ) and you scroll fast... the content will not show, because it's waiting for the top items to appear. And content not showing it's a problem. Or worst, mobile stacked columns, you force the user to scroll at the time the items appear, not good at all. Scrolling animations are good visual enhancements, but  should not interfere with how content is accessed.. Great! Thanks for your work.. Hi! You are right, it's not the .uk-offcanvas-content... thanks, i will remove it. Nice idea, in order to make optional the header resizing. Agree. Closing this since UIkit rc implement this for h1 and h2.. Redundant sizes has been removed, so for example uk-width-2-6 it's not available, you have to use uk-width-1-3. This was made in order to save space, but it affects the workflow in my opinion.\nIf you need the 10th grid and use less, there is a extended grid size less file that adds 7th 8th 9th 10th and 12th sizes. Of course you can choose that sizes to use, it's great, if you are interested i will search for the link.. https://alekvolsk.pw/jed/uikit-grid-width/\nThe author is @AlekVolsk \nYou can find him here: https://gitter.im/uikit/uikit. Done Alek, sorry i didn't find the Gitter chat where you put the source.\nGreat work!. @AlekVolsk seems like your extended width it\u00b4s offline.\nhttps://alekvolsk.pw/jed/uikit-grid-width/. Still happens in latest Beta 27.. @gazley Great!!. I want the 10th grid back too. In my opinion the grid is the base to build upon, every bit that improves the grid is worth it.\nReasons to have it back:\n\nDirect percentage reference, easier to work with proportions: want a 30% cell, done, uk-width-3-10\nMore granular control to the grid, more proportions, more options, more control and posibilities.\nPrevent nesting grid for achieve some proportions ( for the reasons OwenMelbz explained ).\nHow many bytes were saved? Is it really worth removing?\nWorking with repeatable elements: the only way to get 10ths with uk-width-auto is that you have exactly 10 elements, with 10th grid you keep consistency.\n\nAnd it would be nice to have back the redundat grid sizes removed, they make the workflow faster.\nResponses from what i read:\nCan we have it back?\nYes,i guess so. UIkit3 it's in beta, and if more people ask for it i imagine they will bring it back.\nWhat is the reason for not having it?\nSize and they argue that the same can be achieved with new flex sizes.\nWhy was it removed?\nSave some space. Same reason why they remove redundant sizes. UIkit 3 minified and gzipped it's less than a thumbnail image size... and if Yootheme wants to save space, please don't touch the grid :)\n. Great, thanks!.. You created the issue, you can close it.. Nope... :(. @danijelh Besides this feature it\u00b4s implemented or not, go for this framework, it\u00b4s amazing.. @arisaves Yes, it is, but it doesn\u00b4t have the use of requested feature. It only let\u00b4s you pick one value, not a range. It\u00b4s the html range input styled.. I notice in Safari that if you set modal center the modal opens and close without animation, some flickering on the overlay too.\nAnd with the Close component ( offcanvas and modal ) it closes without animation ( sometimes works fine, sometimes not ), if you click on the overlay, it close correctly.. Background blend it's not fully supported yet in all browsers, for example, it's not supported in IE. or Edge yet. http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-backgroundblendmode\nAnother point is it seems to have issues with performance, so if i where you i definitly wouldn't use a full background body image blended, you can ruin you users experience for a background detail ( which is not even certain if gets better... ).\n\njust because you can doesn't mean you should .... Where is this link present in the docs?\n\nIn introduction, the link of \"create your own UIkit theme.\" takes you here:\nhttps://getuikit.com/docs/less\n. Lightbox component it's work in progress, not finished yet.. Works fine for me in all browsers.\nChrome screenshot\n\n. This is not a UIkit issue, it's a browser behavior with html5 validation.\nUIkit doesn't deal with it, if you want to validate the form and want to add uikit error and success classes to form elements use some 3rd party script to do it.\nI use this, works great.\nhttps://jqueryvalidation.org/. Thanks, closing this.. Yes, i will move it.. Yes, the Theme version comes with transparent background by default. the Core version have the muted background.\nhttps://getuikit.com/assets/uikit/tests/button.html. Did you wrap  your content with .uk-offcanvas-content? It\u00b4s required if you want to use the push mode ( docs ). And yes, seems that offcanvas doesn\u00b4t have the inverse mode, it would be nice to have it, and since nav component have this mode i don\u00b4t think it will be a code bloat.\n. Yes, this happens to me some time ago, a Slideshow with full width image, and the container inside with some data, the container was centered  vertical and horizontal, and in Edge and IE 10 the content appears at the right.... Has this been fixed?. Fixed in v 31. I did the the responsive headings feature request too some time ago, since each heading ( h1, h2, h3...) can have different styles applied ( color, weigth, font ), i don\u00b4t think to change the class it\u00b4s a good idea, since you only want to change the font size according to each responsive size.\nI like more the approach of carlos dur\u00e1n here.\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/2583\n. It works, you just forget to add the point to the class selector:\nuk-switcher=\"connect: .test-projects\"\nYour previous example works because it takes the next element with .uk-switcher applied.\nIf you confirm that it works ( i just did it ) please close this issue.. Yes, good idea! The clearer the better.. In macOs Sierra 10.12.\nWorks fine in Chrome, Firefox and Opera.\nIn Safari there is a quick \"Jump\" on the accordion clicked, and as you click the text gets selected.\n\nFrom IPad - Safari there is the quick jump to, and the whole accordion container blinks.\n. Hi, do you see this ok?\nhttps://codepen.io/zzseba78/pen/gRogxV. Same issue in Safari - macOs Sierra 10.12.5\nWorks fine in Chrome.. Hi @florianletsch , thanks for your response.\nThis happens on simple or complex grids, only in second row, please check this link in Firefox:\nhttp://www.seba.adestudio.com/Napoli/menu.html\nClick on the sub menu items ( with switcher ) and check the grid.\nIn this example there is a uk-switcher implemented, but this happens randomly in any grid structure.\nI put this examples in this website because it\u00b4s the one i\u00b4m working on right now, but this happens in every project i worked.\nI\u00b4m using latest Firefox 54.0.1 in macOS Sierra 10.12.5\nThanks.\n\n\n\n. Seems to be fixed in latest release, thanks for your work, closing this issue.. This is not the right place to ask about how things works.\nYou can get help here : https://gitter.im/uikit/uikit\nPlease close this issue.. https://codepen.io/zzseba78/pen/BZOvYq\n. If you have so much pain reading the uikit docs you can edit the css , for example in Firefox with the inspector, since the website doesn\u00b4t refresh you can see all the website with your changes.\n\n. Hi, what do you mean by responsive navbar? The navbar adapts to the window width, all depends on how many items you have in the nav. You can hide items on certain size, you can hide entire nav ( right for example ) in some size, you can show the hamburguer menu to toggle the offcanvas menu or make your nav in a full modal. Uikit gives you this flexibility. \nIf you want something like bootstrap that collapse the entire the navbar in a drop menu, sorry but i prefer flexibility over time saving.\n. The .uk-grid class it\u00b4s added with js, but you can put this css class yourself to avoid this short transition.\n<div class=\"uk-grid\" uk-grid></div>. The docs says there is no need to put the class, and they are right, the grid works as expected.\nSimply add this class and it works fine, if you want it on the docs create a pull request on the UIkit site to get this point clear. \nThe margins on the grid are great, keeps all balanced and prevent from creating paddings or margins on the content all the time, not many frameworks have this feature.\nThere is no need to change the grid. Good luck.. @uikid Good job! \ud83d\udc4d . Works perfect for me Chrome, Safari, FF, Opera. MacOs Sierra 10.12.5\nhttps://codepen.io/zzseba78/pen/vJBNNB. Closing this since the difference between disable inverse completly and disable the available components in the final css file it\u00b4s very small, ( 107kb vs 123kb without gzip ), and gzipped this difference is even less appreciable, I dont think it's worth the effort. Thanks. I think the docs are quite clear with lot of examples. In the case you mention, Tabs, the tabs are just the navigation, it works in conjuction with the Switcher.\nIn the Switcher section you will see a example with Switcher and Tab.\nhttps://getuikit.com/docs/switcher#switcher-and-tab. @saun4app I think it\u00b4s quite clear, first paragraph on Tab Component docs:\n\nThe tab component consists of clickable tabs, that are aligned side by side in a list. Its JavaScript functionality extends the Switcher component and is necessary to dynamically transition through different contents using the tabbed navigation.\n\nTabs are only nav styles, if you need to switch content it depends on the Switcher.\nThe weak part of the docs are related to js, it\u00b4s a frecuently requested point to elaborate, but the rest it\u00b4s concise and clear, there are lots of code examples, test pages and Codepen code.\nOf course if you have doubts and questions, go here:\nhttps://gitter.im/uikit/uikit. @saun4app Well, this phrase maybe it\u00b4s great for usability, but if you want to learn something new, you will have to read and think... a lot \ud83d\ude04 \nDon\u00b4t forget you have the \"Open Test\" link ( at the right ) in each component section in the docs, and you will see the component funcionality in almost all ways. You can check the source code of course.\nGood luck.. @saun4app Take your time to learn the framework and you will see that working with UIkit 3 it\u00b4s great. I recommend to use it with less/sass so you can take the best path from the beginning. Good luck.. Optional closing animations will be good thing, in some cases it\u00b4s a enhancement. \ud83d\udc4d . Seems that you are mixin things here...\nI don\u00b4t think that the Alert component was created to be used in table rows ( tr ), and it should be used in block elements. Modal have nothing to do in this.\nThat\u00b4s why you see it ok in medium size, because the tr it\u00b4s displayed as block element by uikit responsive behavior. This is not a bug.\nCheck this: https://codepen.io/zzseba78/pen/pryLNG\nSet the tr as block element\n.uk-table-responsive tr {\n    display: block;\n}\nIf it works fine, please close this issue.\nGood luck.. @vaniakosmos Seems that you don\u00b4t position the dropdown correctly, you have it to the top-right, and since your element it\u00b4s at the top it doesn\u00b4t make sense...\nCheck this:\nhttps://codepen.io/zzseba78/pen/yoYmgb\nIf it works please close the issue.\n. Hi @jerry1970 , this is not the place to get help using uikit.\nPlease close this issue and ask in the official chat:\nhttps://gitter.im/uikit/uikit. You have a Google + channel too.\nIf you had put your question in Gitter maybe it would already be answered. Stop complaining.\nDefinitely this isn\u00b4t the channel to response questions dude.\nIn the Docs you have several examples on how to create a navbar.\nhttps://getuikit.com/assets/uikit/tests/navbar.html. UIkit applies margin to the previous row in the grid, and this margin depends on the screen size and gutter.\nCheck this example with js, and then remove the uk-grid attribute ( leave the .uk-grid class ) to see the difference.\nhttps://codepen.io/zzseba78/pen/QMmXKK. @flyboarder  You can create a PR in the UIkit docs to make this point clear. \nPlease close this issue. \ud83d\udc4d . @saschadube Thanks for your response. \nI get your point, and the example it\u00b4s just to show the issue, it\u00b4s not a real use case.\nThe real use case it\u00b4s any situation that you want to use uk-width-expand ( in conjunction with uk-width-auto for example ) by default , and in larger breaking points you want to be able to control the width. . Check this part on UIkit docs:\n\n.uk-preserve-width | Since images are responsive by default in UIkit, using an image inside a table cell with the .uk-table-shrink class would reduce the image width to 0. To prevent this behavior, add the .uk-preserve-width class from the Base component to the  element.\n\nCheck this pen:\nhttps://codepen.io/zzseba78/pen/QMJKGL\nIf it works ok for you please close this issue \ud83d\ude04 \n. Not the coolest solution, but in few seconds you can change the color and size of the font... and you can navigate the docs because it doesn\u00b4t refresh...\nI don\u00b4t digg it but maybe there is a way that you can store this preference for the website in your browser...\nNot a solution, but it\u00b4s a momentary release of pain \ud83d\ude04 \n\n. Maybe you can close the drop and open the modal programatically.\nhttps://codepen.io/zzseba78/pen/xLezpq. Of course, z-index it\u00b4s for this...\nhttps://codepen.io/zzseba78/pen/YxMOEq\nIf it works for your please close this issue.. @aarongerig Yes, but that you can specify breakpoints, like Horizontal alignment.\nFor example: uk-flex-top uk-flex-middle@m. You are right that it\u00b4s good to have UIkit light, but with the fact that there is a responsive horizontal feature, don\u00b4t have the same for vertical is seems inconsistent to me, since both are useful and quite used.\nBut if this is not taken into account, surely  i will extend this functionality in less because in my case i really miss this option \ud83d\ude03 \n. Closing, i create my own styles for this \ud83d\udc4d . Well, i have this implemented in muy custom container.less file, for improve readability in some article sections in one column layout, something like this:\nBTW, with the 3 container sizes in UIkit i think it\u00b4s sufficient for most use cases, use the Small, Default and Large sizes as you wish.\n```\n// Variables\n// ========================================================================\n@container-max-width:                   1250px;\n// New sizes\n@container-tiny-max-width:              35rem; \n@container-small-max-width:             45rem;\n@container-medium-max-width:            900px;\n@container-large-max-width:             1450px;\n@container-padding-horizontal:          14px;\n@container-padding-horizontal-s:        @global-gutter;\n@container-padding-horizontal-m:        @global-medium-gutter;\n// Miscellaneous\n// ========================================================================\n.hook-container-misc() {\n.uk-container-tiny { max-width: @container-tiny-max-width; }\n.uk-container-medium { max-width: @container-medium-max-width; }\n}\n```\nThe result is something like this:\n\n. Sorry, but this is not the channel to receive this kind of issues. If you need some help with UIkit, visit Gitter: https://gitter.im/uikit/uikit. Hi! Check this example, if it works for you close this issue, i create a Pull Request with this ( https://github.com/uikit/uikit/pull/2897 ).\nhttps://codepen.io/zzseba78/pen/XejEvR\n. This feature would be great, it\u00b4s needed in mobile version.\n. First of all I clarify that I am not part of the development team of UIkit, I am just another user, with this in clear here are my first thoughts.\n\n\nAs you will know if you check on the people behind UIKIt, Yootheme is a company dedicated to themes market, and UIkit is a core part of your business, having this in mind I doubt that they abandon a project that is a key part of their business.\n\n\nI like to look UIkit 3 as new product, and I do not see it as \"incomplete\" for not having components present in version 2 ( and in fact v3 have more components that v2 \ud83d\ude04, around 70 components  ), I see it as a new product better to its previous version and expanding . Surely in the course of time will add components and functionalities (in fact there are several ongoing, such as the new lightbox, slideshow, remove JQuery dependency). So... a lot of work for a dead project!\n\n\nPerhaps the speed of development of UIkit was diminished this last month, perhaps by vacations (they are human after all). But the pace of work on UIkit is almost daily, and you can corroborate it in Github.I don\u00b4t know many free frameworks that work with this level of intensity, and you?\n\n\nUIkit is mature and has been around for years.\n\n\nThe last commit was yesterday \ud83d\ude04 https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/a816f1beb2b6caa82fc3ffdfd0177f182a4e3d8d with 158 additions and 90 deletions.\n\n\nSo, what do you think? \nI think that you should check things a little more in depth.\nGood luck! Have fun.. Do you have a reproduction link? Because i see the icons, and i use Firefox v56.\nhttps://codepen.io/zzseba78/pen/WZJqOd. Did you include the <div class=\"uk-offcanvas-content\"> wrapping the content like it\u00b4s described in the docs? \nhttps://getuikit.com/docs/offcanvas. Hi @maksim-mul. Use data-type=\"image\" in the link.\nhttps://codepen.io/zzseba78/pen/XeLXwK\nIf it works for your please close this issue. Good Luck. @kiarashi And why don\u00b4t you use the Lightbox component? I think that gives better results for what you want.. Strange, working fine for me. By scrolling you mean to be able to zoom in the image with gestures?\n. Thank for your response. Closed.. It doesn\u00b4t work in the docs, but it works in the test and you can use it.\nhttps://codepen.io/zzseba78/pen/ZaQbBw\nMaybe change the title to \"... not working in the docs.\".. @wolfcreative Did the Codepen works for you? Can you crete a codepen to check your code?. @HassaN0152 It\u00b4s not a problem, it works this way, if you take control on the navigation ( interacting with it ) the autoplay should stop, it\u00b4s annoying if it re-start.\n. Perfect, thanks for the explanation! \ud83d\udc4d . @janschoenherr And how can i reference to the Lightbox Panel in order to use events?\nhttps://codepen.io/zzseba78/pen/YEqaRW\nSorry, i didn\u00b4t found an example on the docs.\nThanks.\n. @TomS- Hi! Try this:\nUIkit.util.on(document, 'shown', '.uk-lightbox.uk-open', function () {\n  console.log('Lightbox is displayed!');\n});\n. Hi, well i can see the text shadow in all browsers.\nhttps://codepen.io/zzseba78/pen/RjoyBG\nDo you see it in the codepen?. Closing, i guess that it\u00b4s for don\u00b4t have dependency on the Container component.. I see, i was targeting the button. Thank you, and your code will be very useful to deal with events! Thanks Aaron! Closing this.\nPD: your code in action \ud83d\udcaa \nhttps://codepen.io/zzseba78/pen/EbowbW. This is not an issue, it\u00b4s a feature, and it\u00b4s great! Combining fonts it\u00b4s a key feature for add meaning, hierarchy and constrast to designs. And there are several cases when you don\u00b4t want to apply to  the navbar items  the same typography of the paragraph.. @tyler-x Most of the time, designers use a font pair, one font for body content and another for headings, special text, maybe buttons, or maybe navigation items. They are different types of deliver  your message, so make sense to use a different fonts.\nIt\u00b4s great to have the option, because, again, this is the most common practice, and if you want to use only one font family you just need to asign the same font family to the heading font.. Maybe you are talking about css version.\nIn less for example, uikit defines the general font-family, and apply the same family ( less variable ) to headers and navbar, so in one place you can change all fonts, i don\u00b4t see the wasting time.

I\u00b4m using Quantum in OS Hight Sierra, and don\u00b4t having any problems with icons.. @SanuNak Hi, this is not the place for learn how to use uikit and ask questions, go to the docs or the official chat: https://gitter.im/uikit/uikit\nHere you have a working example of the slideshow, please close this issue.\nhttps://codepen.io/zzseba78/pen/rYZxvy\nGood luck\n. @hansamars Please clost it then. \ud83d\udc4d . Working fine with latest versions, check this:\nhttps://codepen.io/zzseba78/pen/XZWxrE. Your are right, it\u00b4s not working fine on beta38.. UIkit 3 removed redundant sizes, instead of uk-width-2-4 use uk-width-1-2. Fixed in Beta 42, thanks for your work!. Great! Thanks!!. Did you check this? https://getuikit.com/docs/javascript#component-usage\n\nNote React will work with data-uk-* prefixes only.\n\nSo try data-uk-slidenav-previous\n. Did you try using data-uk-slider instead of uk-slider attribute?\nhttps://getuikit.com/docs/javascript#uikit-and-reactive-javascript-frameworks. Great, thanks.. Thanks for your response @janschoenherr. Closing this.. Thanks for confirm, i didn\u00b4t know what version intruduced this issue back.. It happens with more than 2 slides too.\n. With the recompiled file that @TomS-  create is still happening.\nhttps://streamable.com/2xh4n. Yes of course.. The problem persist. Please if someone else can confirm this.. Fixed in Beta 41! Thanks!!. I was surprised when I see the pixel value too instead of container width variable... uikit is very well structured, maybe the idea it to avoid dependency on the Container component ( i know it doesn\u00b4t make much sense ), and uk-modal-container just act as a width modifier.\n . It would be nice in my opinion.. Please close this issue and ask for help here: https://gitter.im/uikit/uikit. Thanks for your work!.

You are welcome, if it\u00b4s resolved please close this issue \ud83d\udc4d .

Ok, since this is more a use question than an issue, you can close this issue and ask the uikit community for help.\nhttps://gitter.im/uikit/uikit. Hi! Seems that you are a bit lost.\nuk-align-* works fine, no problem with it: https://codepen.io/zzseba78/pen/GxzaMB\nIt\u00b4s used to float an element and create some space with , for example, some sourrounding text...\nIn your case you should align your checkbox with uk-text-right ( or left, center )on the th or td element, that\u00b4s it.\nhttps://codepen.io/zzseba78/pen/VXgOxX\nIf the only way it\u00b4s to float elements, you can remove the margin from the uk-align-* or you can create your custom css in media queries, floating things left or right on each breakpoint without margin.\n. Same thing :) https://codepen.io/zzseba78/pen/VXgOxX\nPlease close this since it\u00b4s a implementation question, not a bug.\nTo ask for help form the community go here: https://gitter.im/uikit/uikit\nThanks.. \u00bfWhat do you mean? by adding uk-text-right@m?\nWhat do you expect when adding it? the text or child element aligns to the right from medium size and ahead... that\u00b4s what happen... i don\u00b4t get your point.. ok.

And you didn\u00b4t close the <main> tag too.\nSo, as a recommendation ( take it or leave it ), before you create a new issue:\n\n\nRe-Check the docs ,  maybe you are doing something wrong, and more likely if you are new with uikit.\n\n\nCheck the test in the docs, see if it works fine there and how it\u00b4s implemented: https://getuikit.com/assets/uikit/tests/height-viewport.html\n\n\nRe-Check your code, maybe you are doing something wrong.\n\n\nAsk the community for help, there are people that can help you. https://github.com/uikit\nThere you can confirm if it\u00b4s a bug or not.\n\n\nUIkit team has tone of work to do, let's not make things more difficult.\nGood luck, please close this.. What you mean by aggressive?\nI\u00b4m just telling you that check before creating an issue, you already create about 3 issues that where bad implementations. That\u00b4s it.

Duplicate of https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/3277. I think it\u00b4s a good idea to implement icons to select elements ( left side ) without replacing the default select element.. I experience this issue, in my case it fix using ratio:false. Hi @fxmountain , i don\u00b4t think this feature it\u00b4s needed on the core uikit, it\u00b4s a quite specific implementation that can be used on a specific case, you can achieve it easy with some css lines.\nRemember that a lightweight framework it\u00b4s a starting point to work upon.\nhttps://codepen.io/zzseba78/pen/zjzXpb\nIf it helps you please close this issue.. Thanks! Did you check the codepen? . This isn\u00b4t how UIkit works. You can use the Visibility component to show or hide elements, and offcanvas for mobile navigation.\nHere you have some examples:\nhttps://github.com/zzseba78/Kick-Off\nPlase close this since it\u00b4s not an issue.. @janschoenherr Thanks for your reply.\nTo get the html validated,  img should specify a src attribute, not empty, so i already set a path to some transparent image ( the path can change depending on file structure, cms dynamic path, etc )\n that uikit will replace when image load.

I try it with some css attributes selectors, works fine in Firefox and Chrome, but not on Safari ( both pc and mobile ) and in Chrome mobile.\nhttp://test.byhumans.works/KickOff/lazy.html\nMaybe adding a class could be more \"clean\" solution, i will leave this open if you want to consider it, thanks! UIkit rocks :metal:. Thanks for your response @saschadube !.

Cookies issue with opera setting, closed.. Works fine for me in Chrome 66.0.3359.181, High Sierra.. The default uikit grid it\u00b4s dinamic, so in default, small and medium have a smaller gutter, and from large the gutter it\u00b4s larger. Of  course you can customize this gutter values in less / sass.\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/067028fe54f4109b33a890a50e45d53449eca860/src/less/components/grid.less#L29-L32\nIf it helps, please close this issue. \ud83d\udc4d . Yes, it\u00b4s a good idea, but i guess the idea is to keep uikit lightweight and not bloat code, and this is for a very specific use case, for example, in your task this can be done with default grid ( remember that large grid it\u00b4s dinamic too, so you have another sizing alternative ).. Remember you can customize breakpoing points to your needs.. Yes, it throws html5 validation errors because img src attribute it\u00b4s not set. The src attribute it\u00b4s created by js after load and place a transparent data uri image.\nYou can set the src attribute yourself in the image in order to validate your document, for example:\n<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-src=\"your-image.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"670\">\nUIkit create this for you, but it could be in the docs that you have to set src attribute yourself if you want to pass html5 validation.\nI agree with your thoughts, also, I think it would be nice to add or change a css class name when image have loaded ( like Lazysizes does for example, makes life easier \ud83d\ude04 ), for example to apply fade in effects, or blur low quality placeholder images while the original it\u00b4s loading.\nFor last but very important, it\u00b4s good to know if using uikit lazy load affect SEO, it will be nice to have this point clear. \nThis is a solution that lazysides implement:\n\nSEO improved: lazysizes does not hide images/assets from Google. No matter what markup pattern you use. Google doesn't scroll/interact with your website. lazysizes detects, whether the user agent is capable to scroll and if not, reveals all images instantly.\n\nMaybe uikit Image component already to this in his way, but i think it\u00b4s good to know.\nThanks.. @AlekVolsk First part, true,...  \"SEO is not relevant\".: wrong.\nhttps://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/lazy-loading. @picov the src attribute it\u00b4s to place a lightweight placeholder image only ( and validate html ) that will be replaced with the data-srcvalue later, you can put it yourself... i don\u00b4t know if i\u00b4m following you...\nYou mean \"modern transparent srcset pattern\" in Lazysizes?. > The tab component consists of clickable tabs, that are aligned side by side in a list.

I think it\u00b4s a way of keep UIkit as light as possible, but i think this should be covered. \nHere are some ideas, what do you think?\nStatus as a separate component\nCreate a Status component where you can choose if use or not status modifiers ( Success, Warning, Danger ) globally or for each component: Alert, Background, Badge, Button, Form,  Icons, Label, Marker, Notification, Progress, Text. Why to load all the styles if i will use Status only on buttons for example.\nOR: \nGlobal Modifiers\nSimplify the styling using global modifiers: for example a button that it\u00b4s success, just add uk-success and it\u00b4s done. All the same styles could be apply to almost all the elements, for example a success color background and white text could be appied on: Alert, Background, Badge, Button,    Label, Marker, Notification. If someone need control over some specific component, overwrite it on the theme.. Related to https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/2858. @Bloemendaal Sorry, I do not mean that it's repeated, I mean I published the same thing a while back.\nI closed it because i don\u00b4t think it will be fixed. Confirmed :point_up:\nIn Safari Tooltip flickers too, and drop and dropdown works normal first time it opens, but then it open very slowly ( like 2 s ). @hrstoyanov  Please close this if your problem it\u00b4s resolved, there are already tons of issues. thanks.. @danbrellis The responsive background works fine, when the page loads put the right background image according to the size to cover.\nhttps://byhumans.works/area/test/responsive-bg.html\n\nIf the page is resized, the appropriately sized image should be swapped in.\n\nIt\u00b4s true, the background image doesn\u00b4t change if you resize the browser window, you have to reload the page to see the changes ( or open in a new tab and update in Chrome ).\nMaybe this is the desired behavior ( i mean, choose the right image for background on page load ) and the resize is not contemplated... maybe you can ask @saschadube or @janschoenherr about this.. Ken burns are just css animations, using transform scale and a long duration...\nBy the way, i see them perfectly in Firefox Quantum OS Hight Sierra.. Add .uk-preserve-width css class to the icon span.\n\nSince images are responsive by default in UIkit, using an image inside a table cell with the .uk-table-shrink class would reduce the image width to 0. To prevent this behavior, add the .uk-preserve-width class from the Base component to the  element.\n\nhttps://getuikit.com/docs/table#utilities\nIf your problem it\u00b4s solved please close this issue. Good luck.. @TomS- Amazing! \ud83d\udc4f . @TomS-  Using your script in one of the layouts of the KickOff project to filter cards.\nhttps://zzseba78.github.io/Kick-Off/cards.html. @oshihirii Hi!\nThis is not a UIkit issue, it\u00b4s how CSS works. Elements with transform ( used by UIkit masonry ) create their own stacking contexts, so if you apply zindex on card or dropdowns it works only for each columm, but other columns have his own stacking context.\nNote: i saw this issue when making the Card Layout for Kick-Off, each card have his own dropdown, then i removed them to avoid confusion.\nI don\u00b4t know if you can change this, but a possible solution is: place dropdowns outside of the stacking context. So, at the end of the page you can put all the dropdowns and target the reference element with toggle, each button should have a unique class or id. Example:\nhttps://codepen.io/zzseba78/pen/dgVbXq\nRead the first answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20851452/z-index-is-canceled-by-setting-transformrotate\nAnd here an article about the Stacking Context: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context\nIt it works for you, please close the issue. Good luck.. @dpuffenberger Add this to uk-slideshow: ratio: false; and you are done. If works, please close this issue. . @dpuffenberger Great!. @TomS- Can you create a reproduction link?\n. Why don\u00b4t you hide the buttons?. Hi @Kevin-at-Navigram , thanks for your comments and thoughts.\nI agree with you  on the square switch, when it\u00b4s off you don\u00b4t can\u00b4t notice clearly wich is the button.\nThis could be solved putting a darker background, and yes, some labels to indicate, or just removing the square modifier, the idea is to keep it as clean and simple as possible.. Yes, it will require some js. This try to be lightweight, simple css only solution.. Confirm :point_up:.

That's what makes the site responsive.\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">\nDon't use the -medium- etc classes and I quess you'll be fine.\nOf course you could also use a table for your pagelayout ;)\n. It's because of the new way of watching the DOM in UIkit 2.9.0.\nhttp://getuikit.com/docs/documentation_javascript.html#dom-observe\n;tldr:\n<div class=\"uk-grid uk-grid-preserve\" id=\"content\" data-uk-grid-match data-uk-observe> ... </div>\n. Thanks!\n. +1\n. Great!\n. The events seem to be fired on de doc, not the .uk-offcanvas element.\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/js/offcanvas.js#L72\nTry $.UIkit.$doc.on({... (untested)\n. Hmmm. did test it, but it doesn't work in 2.8.0. Works in 2.9.0 though that code didn't change.\n. What value is in the href of the anchor? It should be #idOfElementOnThisPage\n. You'd have to put an element with that id on your page.\n<div id=\"bio\">....</div>\n. DOM-observer changed: http://getuikit.com/docs/documentation_javascript.html#dom-observe\ntldr: put data-uk-observe attribute in the element surrounding the ajax-loaded content\n. I'm not sure why the negative margin is applied, I'm curious about that. Maybe someone from the team van explain.\nIf you make sure you nest you uk-grid-s correctly, and always make sure their direct children have a uk-width-* class, you should be fine.\n. No need to change any code.\nIf you want to close a dropdown via JS, use UIkit.dropdown($('#yourdropdown')).hide() when you need it.\n. Oke, starting to answer my own issues too now :)\nI fiddled with the timeout in the ready function, and it works fine in 200 ms. Figured it had to be a problem with the timing of the measurement or order of operations since the height of the dropdowns were measured (439px).\nChanging the timeout is of course not the solution, it turns out that compiling the LESS with JS on pageload causes the problem, and I can imagine that taking time. Switching that off solves the problem with the timeout on 0 as it should be.\nStill really weird Chrome and even IE solve this differently/better and that FF restores on refresh. Any thoughts on that?\n. Thanks!\n. Thank you for your elaborate issue. The 3 exclamation marks really describe the problem. \n. Oke, that makes more sense!\n. Try using a button element for the button instead of an input.\n. Always a bitch, vertical align.\nThe new lifesaver Flex to the resque! Try uk-flex uk-flex-center uk-flex-middle. That does work woth the min-height the match column heights gives.\n. Duplicate of https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/675\n. \\o/ Thanks. Great working hours!\n. Try using buttons for your buttons, the problem won't be there.\n<button class=\"uk-button uk-button-primary\">Submit</button>\n. If you give the form-element the attribute disabled, it's styling will be as uk-disabled would be.\n. Confirmed this. \n. @vuchl See http://getuikit.com/docs/addons_autocomplete.html#custom-templates\n. The input element is not suited for the uk-button classes. Change the input to a button and it should be fine.\n. Still in 2.16.2. http://codepen.io/anon/pen/JoLNJP\nI'm not sure if this is an issue, since all components are protected from initializing twice.\nI'm just curious if this is done deliberately, and if so, why?\n. What is the expected result?\nI didn't try, but I expect the two divs below each other, maybe with a negative margin?\nIt won't be a grid. Add uk-grid-width-1-2 for the result I think you're expecting.\n. And I saw that issue after that :)\nI think it is a choice not to have all grid-features available for the 'shorthand' uk-grid-width-1-*\n. Simular to https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/808\n.

I feel 1.16.3 coming up...\n. Nice!\n. Make sure you load the sticky component css/less\n. @jerry1970 http://yootheme.com/demo/ would be the place to be :)\n. But that is basically what they do. Their themes are a less-layer over the UIkit LESS, just as the UIkit themes are.\nI think it's up to the community to create different themes. I think the combination of these three, and the millions of styles that can be created in the customizer should be enough for a framework to deliver.\n. See #808 \n. Nevermind, yelled too early.\n<div class=\"uk-accordion-title\">\n       <h4>Title</h4>\n</div>\nTakes on the correct font-size\n. Fair enough :)\n. Definitely +1, I use this very often myself\n. Hurray!\n. Oops, that merge got in there... I'll create another PR\n. just returning false in the before function works for me.\nbefore: function (settings, files) {\n                        if ($this.options.uploader.sizelimit > 0 && files[0].size > $this.options.uploader.sizelimit) {\n                            var msg = UI.bixLang._('fileTooLarge')\n                                .replace('{file}', files[0].name)\n                                .replace('{sizeLimit}', UI.bixTools.formatFileSize($this.options.uploader.sizelimit));\n                            UI.notify(msg, {status: 'warning'});\n                            return false;\n                        }\n                    },\n. You do need to use the option before and put your function there, an event won't return anything:\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/js/components/upload.js#L171\n. Try using the sticky-component:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/tpmauyqw/1/\n. Sidenote: uikit.gradient.min.css is a full css file. You don't need to load the uikit.min.css file before that.\n. It's the overflow: y in the red div that gives the trouble.\nI'm not sure if this is possible this way...\n. I think this is about a offset from the bottom. For example a sticky sidebar that stops x pixels from the bottom, not to overlap the footer. For example https://www.boekenbrochures.nl/. In this example not a fixed offset from the bottom is used, but the sticky module is constricted by the container it's in.\n. This is my adjustment for this behavior: https://github.com/malles/uikit/commit/e74e15a1dae899cbf19e18aae03a90d036678eaa\nI'm not sure if this is worth a PR, it is up to UIkit to see if it is a wanted addition.\n. +1\nSame goes for i18n settings for datepicker and other default-options.\n. Nice! I knew there would be something like that!\nMaybe put this snippet in the javascript-docs?\n. Sorry, I'm messing up my Git today...\n. It seems to be a common typo :) Check https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/develop/docs/addons_lightbox.html\n\nI'll close this PR.\n. Thanks!\n. I have implemented the uploader, but that is not live yet. Here is a Gist of my upload-file, maybe it can help you https://gist.github.com/malles/5a2ef0dee6d6889acb13\n. When you make your base uikit, it refers to your path uikit, and replaces it with uikit/js/uikit.\n. Try using the flex component for these kind of layouts. http://getuikit.com/tests/components/flex.html\n. +1\nI tried this with a icon in the :after of the li. Works fine everywhere.... But not in IE.\n```\n/list-checked/\n.hook-list-misc() {\n  .uk-list-checked > li {\n    position: relative;\n    padding-left: 20px;\n    &:before {\n      position: absolute;\n      left: 0;\n      content: \"\\f00c\";\n      font-family: \"FontAwesome\";\n      font-size: 14px;\n      line-height: 23px;\n      color: @list-checked-check-color;\n    }\n  }\n\nli:nth-child(n+2) {\n    margin-top: @list-line-margin-top;\n  }\n\n}\n``\n. I don't it is meant for every icon. Just the checked, and maybe some other list-bullet type of icons\n. @MacWordPress That is how the UIkit docs suggest it now, and is fine. But HTML-editors for instance strip out empty elements, so this can't be done easily in an editor for an enduser. Styling a regularulmarkup makes that possible.\n. Seems a sane thing to do.\nOne note; you only added the FF prefix for the, :after, *:beforeselector.\n. I think we crossed here :) I guess this is the same issue as #954.\nTry this UIkit version with the proposed patch: http://www.bixie.nl/uikit.gridfix.js. \nHope it solves this as well.\n. I don't see amin-heightattribute on the uk-panels either...\n. Seems that the bugs are not related after all.\nThe grid withulas you use it, works fine on UIkit 2.16 (http://jsfiddle.net/h42Lgutb/1/) and 2.15 (http://jsfiddle.net/46o2pea2/1/)\nYou might have a different problem..\n. Page is fine on my end: (newest Chrome on windows)\n![screenshot_20](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5442402/6096795/bf97e3f8-afa4-11e4-94c1-32fb09b42e9e.png)\n. I think I found the problem. This is related to #920.\n![screenshot_21](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5442402/6096808/25c5ea44-afa5-11e4-8a85-1e63ed58074b.png)\nThis is the clearest example: http://getuikit.com/docs/addons.html#usage\nJust includeuikit(.min).jsand theuikit(.theme).css` file if you don't use any add-ons. If you do, add the css and js of the addon seperatly\n. That's weird behavior. That fiddle looks fine in my Chrome indeed. So now the problem only seems to be the grid-matching and grid-margin are not working properly in Safari.\nMaybe change the title of this issue, or close it and start a new, focussing on this issue.\nIs your sites js behaving better with the correct script included?\nedit: just see the new screen. Only in Safari?\n. You still have different issues.. data-uk-grid-match is still not adding style to your panels.\n\ndata-uk-grid-margin is working though... In Chrome and FF the flex is keeping your grid up better (I guess) and the problem is less visible.\nThis is beyond my scope now..\nCrying women is never good.. This is getting serious.\n. Added example with this patch: http://jsfiddle.net/23x21pcy/2/\n. Took me a while to get this one! I now see the reasoning behind the columns and elements. Nice.\n. Nice fix, thanks!\n. I think both features are a combination of existing components that are coupled in a javascript script. That is what UIkit is made for in my opinion, to give these tools (buttons, tabs, navigation, badges, animation) to a developer to turn them into a page like a timeline or wizard.\nMaybe open-source that combo to the community so there can be a UIkit-timeline for everyone.\n. I use something like this:\n(function ($) {\n        $(document).on('ready', function () {\n            var sortable = $('[data-uk-sortable]');\n            sortable.on('stop.uk.sortable', function (e, el, type) {\n                setOrdering(sortable, el);\n            });\n            setOrdering(sortable);\n        });\n        function setOrdering(sortable, activeEl) {\n            var formordering = 1;\n            sortable.find('>li').each(function () {\n                var ele = $(this);\n                ele.find('input').val(formordering);\n                ele.find('div.uk-badge').text(formordering);\n                formordering++;\n            });\n            if (activeEl) {\n                activeEl.find('div.uk-badge').addClass('uk-animation-scale-down');\n            }\n        }\n    })(jQuery);\nThis script presumes you have one input in the li that holds the ordering, and a div.uk-badge to display it to the user.\n<li>\n<div class=\"uk-panel uk-panel-box\">\n    <div class=\"uk-badge uk-badge-notification uk-panel-badge\">0</div>\n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"formordering[{{item_id}}]\" value=\"0\" />\n    <strong>{{Title}}</strong>\n</div>\n</li>\nShould look like this:\n\n. Your ul should have the attribute data-uk-sortable, but you could select it by it's id.\n. +1 for the idea.\nYou should create PR's for the develop branche, it won't be merged into master.\n. You can setup your accordion to trigger on another element than the default .uk-accordion-title docs. That way you can place your input inside the title, and have another element/button act as the trigger.\n. You should always make your buttons type=\"button\". For good practice, but especially in forms to prevent submitting. A button as itself should not fire a event to prevent.\n. I think you're looking for this: http://getuikit.com/docs/switcher.html#switcher-with-tabs\n. Just get rid of the <div> elements in your ul markup, it works fine: http://jsfiddle.net/malles/xf8gup1t/1/\nSee accordion section in nav documentation\n. You don't even need the accordion addon, the accordion in the menu is default core functionality.\n. Please create a PR on the develop branche\n. Thanks!\nReminder: I didn't edit changelog in this PR, it should be mentioned in update guidelines since it breaks existing markup.\n. http://getuikit.com/docs/addons_form-select.html\n. Because it can be easily created adding a uk-dropdown-notification and some minor design. Hence, use the framework to create this specific need. A framework gives you article titles, subtitles and text-styling, but you won't expect them to create an article for you. Kind of the same I think.\n. You'll be looking for http://getuikit.com/docs/documentation_javascript.html#dom-observe. Or found it, since this issue is already closed.\n. Try data-uk-check-display, that might work.\n. +1\nFor revealing a hidden object with scrollspy, for instance.\n. Problem is to revert uk-hidden, uk-display-block does not do the trick because uk-hidden also sets  visibility: none !important;.\nClasses uk-visible and uk-visible-inline, similar to uk-visible-hover-inline classes would be highly appreciated.\n. These should really be the last one of those....\nCould you create PR's to the develop branche, they won't be able to merge this.\n*edit develop branche, of course\n. These lines have been changed in the current develop branche.\n. And this has not been changed yet in develop, you're right\nThis table with events is in the doc twice, https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/develop/docs/scrollspy.html#L499 and https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/develop/docs/scrollspy.html#L363\nThe one ~363 is not fixed yet.\n. And there is a bonus on line 380: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/develop/docs/scrollspy.html#L363\nCould you fix that one as well?\n. \nThat should really be the last one. The only occurences I can still find are in the changelog. \n. :+1: \n. You're nesting a form in a form, that's never a good idea.. Are you sure you loaded all js and css correctly?\n. http://www.pastekit.com/j2KBzz\nHere is your exact html-code, with only the links to js and css replaced with those from the cdn. The slideshow works fine there. \nIt must be in the including of your local files. Open the browser console (F12) and check for loading errors.\ufeff\n. If you're calling the template function manually from a script, you could replace brackets to curly's before you put the string in. In this case the option would have to be brought back to the autocomplete options. \nI was looking at https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/js/core/core.js#L283 as well, and I was wondering why the {{{...}}} are valid and used, but act the same. In the example above and in docs only {{{ $item.text }}} has three curlys. Any reason for that?\n. Nevermind, I read the code a bit more carefully. {{{varname}}} == {{!varname}}, not escaped.\n. You could change that line to var tokens = str.replace(/\\n/g, '\\\\n').replace(/\\[\\[\\s*(.+?)\\s*\\]\\]/g, \"{{$1}}\").replace(/\\{\\{\\{\\s*(.+?)\\s*\\}\\}\\}/g, \"{{!$1}}\").split(/(\\{\\{\\s*(.+?)\\s*\\}\\})/g), wich I think could work for you. It's just a bit of a nasty way to go about it.\nOr you could change it in https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/js/components/autocomplete.js#L76, where that function is called. this.template = UI.Utils.template((this.template || this.options.template).replace(/\\[\\[\\s*(.+?)\\s*\\]\\]/g, \"{{$1}}\"));\n@vuchl It would be nice to have it as an option, but I guess it would have to be globally set, like the prefix. I think quite a big change if done properly.\n. You could change that line to var tokens = str.replace(/\\n/g, '\\\\n').replace(/\\[\\[\\s*(.+?)\\s*\\]\\]/g, \"{{$1}}\").replace(/\\{\\{\\{\\s*(.+?)\\s*\\}\\}\\}/g, \"{{!$1}}\").split(/(\\{\\{\\s*(.+?)\\s*\\}\\})/g), wich I think could work for you.

I think quite a big change if done properly.\n. One way you could work around all this, is to put the template in via the options of the autocomplete component.\nIf you don't provide a template override in script tags, the template is picked from the options. So if you set the template option (like so), you wouldn't have your {{...}} in the markup.\n. No, but you can create your own template, and pass it in UIkit via strings, so TWIG won't pick it up.\n. @hanlan The @- is removed from 2.17\n. I guess this issue is kinda solved...\n. The function scrollToElement on line 33 is indeed the one you're trying to call.\nAs it is within the closure of the files' \"iife\", you cannot call it directly. A so called protected function in javascript.\nFor our convinience the function is bound to an accessible variable on line 55.\nUIkit.Utils.scrollToElement(UIkit.$('#go-to-this-div')); should do the trick.\n. +1\n. I have recreated the issue in some codepens.\nScrollspy triggers too early when a slideshow is above it. Tested in Chrome, IE and FF.\nRecreation of the bug: http://codepen.io/malles/pen/ZYjKPx. Best viewed in iframe with devtools\nControl test; same setup with plain image instead of slideshow: http://codepen.io/malles/pen/ByPZBp iframe\n. This issue still exists in 2.19, see the codepens. Should be fixed with #1045 but is not...\n. I agree on this, but @jerry1970 how would you call a single core piece of code without calling it a component? Throughout the docs there those pieces of code are called components, and that seems ok to me. Eg the panel page refers to the Grid component and Badge component, which are both cores.\nIn a way I think add-on was more distinctive to separate 'core components' and 'add-on components'. Maybe it would be best to consistently refer to core components as \"core component\".\n. It's intended: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/js/components/slideshow.js#L160\nAnd as @jerry1970 said, default behaviour on most slideshows. I wouldn't want an autoplay interfering with me clicking the arrows...\n. +1\nI think this is directly related to #1027 \n. The template engine allows some simple logic in the templates (source).\nBasicly this is possible:\n| operator | function | example |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| {{..}} | code separator | Separates the template logic from the markup. You can display the value of a variable {{varname}} or use it for logic {{^block}}{{/block}}. Using spaces is optional, {{ varname }} works the same. |\n| {{{..}}} | unescaped code separator | Use this when you want to display a variable that must not be escaped, eg html-markup {{{myHtmlString}}}. |\n| / | terminate | Terminates block opened before {{^block}}<p>Some text</p>{{/block}} |\n| ~ | forEach loop | Iterates over an array of items. {{~items}}<li>{{ $item.value }}</li>{{/items}} |\n| : | for..in loop | Iterates over an object of items. {{:items}}<li>{{$key}}: {{ $item.value }}</li>{{/items}} |\n| # | If condition | Checks for positive value {{#value}}<span>It's {{value}}</span>{{/value}} |\n| ^ | If not condition | Checks for negative value {{#value}}<span>It's empty</span>{{/value}} |\n| ! | Don't escape | Displayed value is not escaped. Same as {{{ ... }}}.  {{!myHtmlString}} |\nMake sure the data you put in matches the functions you use. Errors are displayed in the template until you get rid off them.\nAs an example a snippet where a list of file that has an image/icon is displayed:\n<h3>{{fileName}}</h3>\n{{#hasImage}}\n    {{#isIcon}}\n    <div class=\"uk-float-right uk-thumbnail\">\n        <img src=\"{{thumb.url}}\" width=\"{{thumb.width}}\" height=\"{{thumb.height}}\" alt=\"{{fileName}}\"/>\n    </div>\n    {{/isIcon}}\n    {{#isThumb}}\n    <a href=\"{{thumb.lbox}}\" data-uk-lightbox=\"\" class=\"uk-overlay\">\n        <img src=\"{{thumb.url}}\" width=\"{{thumb.width}}\" height=\"{{thumb.height}}\" alt=\"{{fileName}}\"/>\n        <div class=\"uk-overlay-area\"></div>\n    </a>\n    {{/isThumb}}\n{{/hasImage}}\n{{^hasImage}}\n    <i class=\"uk-icon-cloud-upload uk-icon-medium uk-text-muted\"></i>\n{{/hasImage}}\nExample data:\n{\n    fileName: 'file.pdf',\n    thumb : {\n        url : 'thumb.jpg',\n        width : 64,\n        height : 64,\n        lbox : 'image.jpg'\n    },\n    hasImage : true,\n    isThumb : true,\n    isIcon : false,\n}\n. Yes, I saw you sneak that in there. That's not the proper position because it won't hide if data but !data.length\n. Well, you gotta scroll down before you drop down :)\n. gulp dist -t Themename will compile the custom themes. The watch function has to be looked at, as well as the docs\n. Please, always create a PR for the develop-branche\n. It seems to make sense to make this and that #885 FontAwesome functionality available in UIkit.\n. I think this really was the last one... :)\n. No, but it used to be. Upgrade your UIkit and it all will match again.\n. Please, always create PR's for the delevop-branche\n. +1\nAlthough I'd rather have a tooltip that would take full html. That would have to be some modified dropdown I guess.\n. @Dmatafonov This would be done in a uk-dropdown with some observers. \nIn this example I created a slideshow that comes in on hover.\n\n(Still waiting on proper content)\n. Oops, to master..\n. Another weird code example:\n\nli's without an ul? I understand it's part of example code, but this looks really weird. Again this could be solved by putting a real example in another tab.\n. I think that's reasonable.\nDo you mean that declaration to be in cover.less or in a custom file?\n. Use uk-subnav for your ul\n\n. If you can, replace the a with a span for the disabled, then they will be muted as will I think\n. No, that is not the effect I was hoping for.\nOff course you can just use the class uk-text-muted, and you'll have to surpress the link as well somehow.\nIt is weird that uk-disabled works in uk-subnav', but not inuk-dropdown-nav. By the looks of it, that looks a YOOtheme template. Create a default menu with a separator. See how that's made up and copy that markup.\n. Yes, that is possible, but not as easy as it seems.\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/js/components/autocomplete.js#L201\nHere you see that the eventselect.uk.autocomplete` is triggered before the value is placed in the input. It does give you the opportunity to alter the value that is placed in the input. \nUIkit.$('#ac-input').on('select.uk.autocomplete', function (e, data, ac) {\n    UIkit.$('#clickResult').text('You clicked ' + data.value + ' and I erased that again!').addClass('uk-alert');\n    ac.input.val('');\n    data.value = null;\n  });\nwill do the trick, as shown in example 4 in http://codepen.io/malles/pen/qEyEZr\n. Lightbox tries to detect the type of data it has to show. You can force the type by putting data-lightbox-type=\"image\" in your lightbox tag. http://getuikit.com/docs/lightbox.html#different-content-sources\n. @aheinze maybe the Regex could be passed the i modifier to be a bit more flexible?\n(data.type == 'image' || data.source && data.source.match(/\\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|svg)$/i)) src\n. And it will work without the extra tag as well soon: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/07ced8e9fd41c68c20d2aaec1329abd6e030c21b\nThanks @aheinze !\n. It would help to know in what file on line 176 this occurs...\n. The world would be much cooler\nif IE8 is out of it...\n. as a href it is not forbidden, a link can contain those characters. You're referring to other element on the page that would have to have an id like user/3, and that is forbidden.\nThe error you get comes from selectors trying to find that element like $('user/3'), which throws an error.\nIf you're trying to link to another page, just make the href user/3\n. I'm not sure this is an issue. As @luetn said, just make sure the link doesn't start with #, and make it a valid link\n. Try adding the uk-grid-match class to your grid. http://getuikit.com/docs/grid.html#match-column-heights\n. Nope\nThe conflict with scrollspy seems valid: http://codepen.io/malles/pen/XJomQq\nOne other issue with your code, you should apply the align_height class to the div inside the grid you want to match, your scrollspy divs in this case. I made it panels in my example, to see the edges better.\nThe actual grid-divs are matched fine, it's the animated content that is not adjusted after animation.\nWhen I let UIkit.Utils.checkDisplay(); run after the animation, the heights are set properly.\nI think you should reopen this, as it's a valid issue.\n. did you load the sticky css file?\n. Yes, it would.\nFor that, you can compile your own minified theme file and include the components you need there. http://getuikit.com/docs/documentation_create-a-theme.html\n.

If uk-pull and uk-push might become deprecated, how would one order a column that is not first or last? Nesting the grids like I did messes up the column-widths...\n. I agree to this, just was staring a minute to find the Accordion I expected on top..\nI don't think your pull-request covers it, it will have to be changed on every page of the components section. I think this is easier done as an internal refactoring job.\n. This was just implemented:\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/7069faba5a1c5f41c2e8515fef237b422fdd6f04\n. I think the effect he means is for uk-text-truncate to only truncate after eg 3 lines:\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur er\nsadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod \ntempor invidunt. Lorem ipsum dolor alk ...\nBut I don't think that is even possible in css...\n. All UIkit javascript components have their options, most of them are in the docs.\nYou can override them like so, set them in the data attribute, or use JS to initialize the elements.\n. I see what you mean. Already done in eg sortable: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/js/components/sortable.js#L41\nI think it will work its way in the code.\n. Most of them work fine, only Scale is not working. I've been looking at it for quit some time now, and can't figure out why not. Tests work fine, and all works fine in the codepen\n. Okay, I've been fighting with this for some time now, and I officially give up. :confounded:\nThe scale switcher fails at https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/js/core/switcher.js#L170, the promise is not returned, .then() i snot executed, nor is the release of the animation. The event UI.support.animation.end is never fired.\nOnly on the scale switcher. I switched the markups, order of examples, animations, even element-ids, nothing helps.\nWeirdest thing is, tests and my codepen work fine. Only on the docs' markup this fails.\n. Of Course I didn't give up... Just took a bit longer.\nIt's not in the switcher or tabs. Nor in any javascript. It's a typo in the docs' css! :smirk:\n\nI can't make a PR for the docs' less, so it will have to be fixed in Hamburg.\n. Making all css compatible for template using framework has too much impact vor UIkit 2. We will certainly keep these things in mind when building UIkit3.\n. The sortable component has been reworked quite a bit now. All events should be as documented now.\nThank you\n. Issue is picked up in #1308 \n. The tooltip has moved from core to components. You'll have to add the js and css file separately now. \n. You don't need the uk-scrollspy-init-inview class on your element, that is added by the javascript.\nDoes the effect work with another animation, eg fade? The scale-up animation is broken in the docs at the moment, but I don't think the releases are or have been.\n. Oh, and the closing i-tag is missing :)\n. Hmm. That may mean it has broken.. I can't recreate it in a codepen though. http://codepen.io/malles/pen/waBgEK It works fine (Icons don't work in Codepen.) Can you check in the debugger if it's the same problem as #1207 ?\n. That is correct, you shouldn't have the docs css. The bug in the UIkit site is in that file and I presumed (hoped) it is not in the regular css. If you find uk-fade-scale02 instead of uk-fade-scale-02 as animation name in the css, the problem is bigger.\n. That is the way it is supposed to work. Can you create a codepen or live example of the code you are trying? \n. Include your element like this $('#manualInitNested'), and it works fine http://codepen.io/malles/pen/OVVzKm?editors=101\n. I was wondering that myself. On the other hand, it's logical that one instance of the nestable can handle one ul. And indeed, only the first element of the selector is used.\nIf you init the jQuery object on the template you create, you can pass that. See fiddle\n. Try UIkit.$html.trigger('changed.uk.dom'); after you toggled the div. That should force the grid to update. See https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/1348\n. Yeah, it's a bug in the docs. Should work fine in the releases. See #1207.\nAlso visible in http://getuikit.com/docs/scrollspy.html and http://getuikit.com/docs/switcher.html\n. Make sure all PR's are made to the develop branche\n. This van be done already by combining the thumbnav/slider with a switcher.\nIt would be nice to have a good example of this, indeed.\n. It works almost with default UIkit code: http://codepen.io/malles/pen/qdOvJP\nProblem is that the copies of the images in the slider have the wrong index. Adding a data attribute and a small fix to the switcher code makes it work.\n. Suddenly seeing you refer to the slideshow. That of course is much better, and works out of the box!\nhttp://codepen.io/malles/pen/bdVJXg\nSo forget the switcher :)\n. And works with slider as well: http://codepen.io/malles/pen/qdOvJP\n. Right. Widgetkit is made with and by UIkit (YOOtheme), so it is all the same in essence.\n. @florianletsch No probs, I'll publish it to G+ as well. You can make the video :wink: \n. You can override the value of the touch-detector I guess. It would be kind of a hack though..\nUIkit.on('beforeready.uk.dom', function () {\n    UIkit.support.touch = false;\n});\n.

This can mostly be done with the responsive widths classes: http://getuikit.com/docs/slider.html#responsive\n. I've located the problem.\nThe variable text-primary-color is used by the contrast component at line 412, but declared by the text component at line 739.\nThe same issue is with the button-component variables used in the contrast component, but that throws no errors, due to the sorting by alphabet.\nI've made a fix, but want to see if it is an option to move the contrast vars down in the uikit-variables file.\n. Here are some examples withe the buttons: http://codepen.io/malles/pen/YPjLpr That might help you.\n. Yeah, it won't get into the regular form-fields. You could off course create a hidden field and put the value there.\nI agree, a good module for native radio's as buttons is not in UIkit. Form modules are so specific, that I think it's better to find a custom solution per project.\n. Make sure you include the autocomplete component and it's css/less files. \n. The @mixin is not used for Less, I suppose it's Scss\nThe hook hook-base-body is added to the html tag actually. (see https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/less/core/base.less#L99)\nThis would result in css like \nhtml * {\n-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);\n}\nwhich should do the trick.\n. Have you tried it with the responsive element as in #1310 ?\n. AFIK these issues have been resolved now.\n. Even if the element that generates it has position: relative as well?\n. I don't think this can be prevented then. You'd have to create a custom css solution or try not to use a relative position on the body.\n. +1\n. Problem with this is the behaivour over multiple lines: http://jsfiddle.net/Lrdsu1oo/1/, the reason this issue is opened. The FA css accounts for that.\n. This is what I get from the generated RTL-css from the UIkit customizer:\nuk-align-left {\n  margin-left:15px;\n  float:right;\n}\n.uk-align-right{\n  margin-right:15px;\n  float:left;\n}\nWhich is the correct reverted behaviour.\n. That is accounting for the width of the pulldown arrow.\n. The em/px issue shall be addressed in UIkit 3, it will break too much existing code to change that now.\n. You could try to adapt this pen for use i slider. I think it should work: http://codepen.io/malles/pen/vOXzxZ\n. Hmm, I'm afraid not. It might be interesting to build it in the slider component as an option. For a slider it's an obvious performance winner.\n@aheinze Maybe allow a data-source attribute on image and lazyload those when coming into view?\n. There is the option media you can pass into the parallax, simular to sticky.\nI don't know why it's not documented.\n. Technically this should work too, judging form these lines:\n<div data-uk-parallax=\"{media: 1200, bg: '-200'}\" style=\"height: 400px; background-image: url('img/parallax.jpg');\">\nDidn't test it though.\n. Okay. wild shot. try\n@media (max-width: @breakpoint-small-max) {\n  [data-uk-parallax]:extend(.uk-height-viewport):extend(.uk-overlay) {\n   }\n}\nIn your less\n. I'm not sure. I'd check out the declarations for .uk-height-viewport and .uk-overlay and go from there.\n. Use a button element as a button. See #805, #671.\n. Just add the data-uk-observe attribute to the parent element.\n. The data-uk-observe should be in a parent of data-uk-grid-margin.\n<div data-uk-observe>\n  <div class=\"uk-grid uk-grid-width-medium-1-2\" data-uk-grid-margin>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div>\n    ... inject dynamically\n  </div>\n</div>\n. To force the grid to update via JS you have some options:\nSee https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/js/components/grid.js#L86\nTrigger display check event on grid element or instance\nvar myGrid = UIkit.grid('#grid-el', {...});\n//when redraw is needed\nmyGrid.trigger('display.uk.check');\n//or just trigger it on the element itself, or one if its parents\n$('#grid-el').trigger('display.uk.check');\nSee https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/js/components/grid.js#L90\nTrigger dom changed on $html\nUIkit.$html.trigger('changed.uk.dom');\nWhen you add entire components to the dom, you can init UIkit on a part of the DOM via:\nUIkit.init('#updated-dom-el');\n. Can't you avoid using those in the comments?\nTry commenting like //Some example \u2014 test String\n. Yeah, the wonderful world of computing! :confused: \nI think this is an issue for the less-compile scripts used by gulp, not a UIkit issue. \n. Thank you for your input.\nThe sortable component is under heavy development. The events from the options object will be deprecated. You can hook on to the *.uk.sortable events.\nThe events are added to the test pages, as suggested in #1213 so the devs can make sure they are not broken.\n. You can override the renderer for the autocomplete, and control your limits there.\nFor examples, see http://codepen.io/malles/pen/qEyEZr\n. This was done in favour of the filters in Pagekit. It makes sense in that case. If this would be made optional in UIkit, it would need refactoring in Pagekit. It'll have to be discussed there.\n. Thanks for reporting!\n. If you choose to change and maintain your own style of Uikit, really the best way to do it is to handle it with the less/sass source files, and compile your own uikit.css. http://getuikit.com/docs/documentation_less-sass.html\n. If you set up your less files as done in the themes you have your own variables and custom style in the override files and hooks. You can update the core and leave your modifications in place.\n. Seems that IE takes the font-size of the h1 the icon is in, 36px, and Chrome sticks to the 250% uk-icon-large size. Take the icon out of the h1.\nYou are loading uikit.css and uikit.min.css. That is is not helping it I'm afraid.\n. This is indeed not a bug, the overhead of remeasuring on resize is not worth it for these corner cases.\nTry this setup for a sidebar on large screens: http://codepen.io/malles/pen/YXNLJN\n. I'm not sure if it's a bug, but you did understand it :)\nThe problem is in the togglers having a different start-state. One of the icons has the uk-hidden class, one hasn't. \nThe code checks the group for having the toggle-class: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/js/core/toggle.js#L72 This always returns true since there will be an element with the uk-hidden class. Therefore the 'show' animation is always played.\nI made a test that fixes that, see http://codepen.io/malles/pen/WvZepj and https://github.com/uikit/uikit/pull/1341\nNow the downside is, that it still does not have the desired behaviour for your purpose, since the buttons you're toggling are now both visible during the animation. Technically it is more exact, but it might break other togglers depending on the current behaviour. \n. It's because two panels in a grid get margin applied:\n.uk-grid+.uk-grid, .uk-grid-margin, .uk-grid>*>.uk-panel+.uk-panel {\n  margin-top: 25px;\n}\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/less/core/grid.less#L134\nSolve it by not using uk-grid or add uk-margin-remove to your panel. https://jsfiddle.net/mru0sc0L/2/\n. Is solved in next version. Thank you.\n. The slider would need a big rewrite to fix this and other issues. It is on our todo list.\n. Okay, another go: try UIkit.$html.trigger('changed.uk.dom');\n. The sortable component is under heavy development at the moment. The event-functions in the options will probably be deprecated, since they are doubles for the *.uk.sortable events. \nThe event triggers are monitored in the tests, as you suggested in #1213.\nAt the moment only the move.uk.sortable is still broken in the development branch, it is on the todo list.\n. The sortable component has been reworked quite a bit now. All events should be as documented now.\nThank you\n. @nghuuphuoc Great, thanks!\n. Yes, there are triggers: http://getuikit.com/docs/offcanvas.html#javascript\nUse them like\n$('#offcanvas').on('show.uk.offcanvas', function () {\n    //do your magic\n});\n. The offcanvas component will be completely reworked in UIkit 3. For now you'd have to work with the current design with it's limitations.\n. Do you still have this issue?\n. It is mostly caused by a lost reference to the modal. Can you show an example?\n. @zslabs Thanks!\n. These issues are no longer valid as far as I know.\n. You can try the cover component to spread the background image over the header.\n. Default behaviour of css background properties would be the answer to that. \nI don't know in what menu you changed the background of the header, but that seems not to do the trick properly.\n. That really depends on the framework you're working on. This is really a question for them to answer.\n. Those lines prevent the anchor from navigating away when you pick it up to move. Then on mouseup the click is triggered when there was no move and the click was intended to click the link.\nThe event click is triggered twice because of that, but the actual link is only triggered once.\n. Best way to prevent trouble with this double triggering of links inside sortable elements is to use Sortable handles in your sortables, or mark the elements (' parents) you don't want to fire the drag-events with the uk-sortable-nodrag class.\n. Do you have an example in codepen for that? You could fork this one as a setup.\n. Will be in next release!\n. No it is not released yet. If you can't wait, replace the contents of your slider.js with the develop version.\n. Pass code you want to execute when user clicks OK to the second argument of alert as a function.\n$.post('test.php', post_data, function(response) {\n  UIkit.modal.alert(response.text, function () {\n    $(location).attr('href', '/home');\n  });\n}, 'json');\n. Ah I see now. UIkit.modal.alert is not meant to be blocking. Use UIkit.modal.confirm instead.\n$.post('test.php', post_data, function(response) {\n  UIkit.modal.confirm(response.text, function () {\n    $(location).attr('href', '/home');\n  });\n}, 'json');\n. Pasting this snippet in the console on any UIkit-docs page gives the desired behaviour, it only redirects when the OK button is clicked, dismisses without redirect when cancelled:\nUIkit.modal.confirm('Make a choice!!', function () {\n    console.log('only when ok');\n    location.href = '/';\n});\n. The content of the modal is taken from the modal that is in the DOM. Calling UIkit.modal(\"#mymodal\").show() will open the modal with that ID and Content. If you call UIkit.modal(\"#mymodal2\").show(), another modal with other content will open. If you want to use the same modal for different content, you'd have to change the content via JS.\nvar modal = UIkit.modal(\"#mymodal\");\nmodal.find('.uk-modal-dialog').html('<p>New content.</p>');\nmodal.show();\n. No, it doesn't create/clone anything in the dom. Only alert/confirm create their own modal.\nThis works for me, I think this is what you need:\nhttp://codepen.io/malles/pen/dodwwW\nvar modal = UI.modal($('#my-id'), {bgClose: false}),\n        modalContent = modal.find('.modal-content');\n    $('#modal1').click(function () {\n      modalContent.html('<p>Content modal 1</p>');\n      modal.show();\n    });\n    $('#modal2').click(function () {\n      modalContent.html('<p>Different content modal 2</p>');\n      modal.show();\n    });\n. If you replace the content of your JS-template, you'd have to inject that template again into the modal.\nTry to replace the DOM of the modal itself, like I did. \nAnyway, any solution works.\n. I don't think you question is clear. What do you mean exactly? Do you have an example?\n. Ah, that would need the flex classes. Play around with the classes and modifiers. You'll need uk-flex-space-between for a start.\n. I don't think this is desired default behaviour. You can use the .uk-text-break class from the text component to break long words.\n. This question does not seem UIkit related. \n. Thanks!\n. I do agree with you on that. But just changing this at one spot, potentially breaking existing builds does not seem wise.\n. It's caused by a conflict between the modal's overlay and the 100% height on the body element. \nPrevent it by using the uk-height-viewport on the actual elements you want to have the full height. Remove the height classes from body and html.\n. Do you have a live example of this? Or can you reproduce it in a codepen?\n. The main solution is to put a data-uk-check-display attribute on the element that has data-uk-grid: \n<div id=\"example\" data-uk-grid=\"{gutter: 20, controls: '#filter'}\" data-uk-check-display>. This forces it to recalculate the dimensions when it becomes visible.\nCheck out this codepen: http://codepen.io/malles/pen/rVrNzM. I did quite some cleanup. Remove all aria-*, data-uk-grid-prepared and style attributes from your elements. These are added by the javascript later.\n. That is not possible with the accordion. maybe it should in the future, since switcher, menu and tabs do have that option.\nFor now you can select the correct content-element with some javascript:\nUIkit.on('afterready.uk.dom', function() {\n  var accordion = UIkit.accordion(UIkit.$('#my-accordion'), {showfirst:false}),\n      wrapper = accordion.find('[data-wrapper]').get(2); //2 as index of the content\n  accordion.toggleItem(UIkit.$(wrapper), true, true);\n});\nDemo in this codepen: http://codepen.io/malles/pen/bdMMGB?editors=101\n. Try to add a separate handle for the sortable, that usually solves these issues.\nhttp://getuikit.com/docs/sortable.html#sortable-handle\n. Place the uk-tab-center class on the uk-tab-ul itself: <ul class=\"uk-tab uk-tab-center uk-tab-bottom\" data-uk-tab=\"{connect:'#my-id'}\">. You can remove the surrounding div.\nEdit: I'm sorry. You lose the centering then. You can position the tabs correctly by replacing uk-tab-center with uk-flex uk-flex-center in the surrounding div. Only the separating border won't be full width.\n. Great! Use the both on the parent div, and it works fine:\n<div class=\"uk-tab-center uk-tab-center-bottom\">\n    <ul class=\"uk-tab uk-tab-bottom\" data-uk-tab=\"{connect:'#my-id'}\">\n      <li><a href=\"\">Tab 1</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"\">Tab 2</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"\">Tab 3</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"\">Tab 4</a></li>\n    </ul>\n</div>\nNo need for the change in the PR then. Docs need to be more clear here.\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/83d26f7ed599e13a5f4a3a2de54e7ee66effcdcc\n. Use both classes on the parent element. Docs are clarified on that.\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/83d26f7ed599e13a5f4a3a2de54e7ee66effcdcc\nThanks!\n. Interesting question. The images in the slideshow are loaded anyways, so that should make no difference. \nIt would be the difference between checking if the element is visible or not and sliding the slideshow.\nMy 10 cents says it makes no difference in the end.\n. @luetn Thanks!\n. The scrollspy component does not have a media option (yet). \nTry this:\nUIkit.on('beforeready.uk.dom', function () {\n  if (UIkit.$win.width() < 767) {\n    UIkit.$('[data-uk-scrollspy]').removeAttr('data-uk-scrollspy');\n  }\n});\n. ow sorry, I made a typo, it must be UIkit.on.... I edited the post now.\n. Do you have it setup with a dropdown in the tabs, like this: http://codepen.io/malles/pen/oXMXPY?editors=101?\nThat setup as some problems when responsive, and shows the behaviour you get when you resize the screen to a small viewport when the fourth tab is active.\nI think you have the responsive dropdown in your markup. You don't need to do that, it's done by the js.\n. I can't reproduce the error in the pen: http://codepen.io/malles/pen/oXMXPY?editors=101\n\nThe tab that is passed on that breakpoint is the correct li, that is hidden and active, not the responsive tab.\nI might have to do with the order of rendering the markup with React in play.\nHow and when do you init the tabs/switcher?\n. I agree with @zslabs on this. This is easy to add to a custom theme if wanted, and bloats the framework if added.\n. I don't see why you just shouldn't create separate bars for separate progresses;\n<div class=\"uk-progress uk-progress-danger\">\n    <div class=\"uk-progress-bar\" style=\"width: 40%;\">40%</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"uk-progress uk-progress-warning\">\n    <div class=\"uk-progress-bar\" style=\"width: 30%;\">30%</div>\n</div>\n. The kenburns effect cannot work with most special effects, that is indeed true. The nature of the two animations don't allow each other.\n. My guess would be that you don't need a html-editor, but a Ruby-editor.\n. These issues should be resolved in the current versions.\n. UIkit.datepicker($('#date1'), { minDate:0, maxDate: maxDate.format(\"DD/MM/YYYY\"),format:'DD/MM/YYYY' }); initializes an instance of the datepicker, or returns the already existing instance. So calling that on change would return the existing datepicker with its options. You'll need to keep a reference to the datepickers and change their options.\nSee this codepen for an example: http://codepen.io/malles/pen/BNOemW?editors=101\nTLDR;\nUIkit.ready(function() {\n  var date1 = UIkit.datepicker(UIkit.$('#date1'), { minDate: 0, format:'DD/MM/YYYY' }),\n      date2 = UIkit.datepicker(UIkit.$('#date2'), { format:'DD/MM/YYYY' });\n  date1.on('change.uk.datepicker', function () {\n    date2.options.minDate = UIkit.Utils.moment($(this).val(), \"DD/MM/YYYY\").add(3,'days').format('DD/MM/YYYY');\n    date2.update();\n  });\n });\n. Can always be better :)\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/pull/1404\nMakes the current value available in the datepicker instance. So you can do:\nUIkit.ready(function() {\n  var date1 = UIkit.datepicker(UIkit.$('#date1'), { minDate: 0, format:'DD/MM/YYYY' }),\n      date2 = UIkit.datepicker(UIkit.$('#date2'), { format:'DD/MM/YYYY' });\n  date1.on('change.uk.datepicker', function () {\n    date2.options.minDate = date1.current.add(3,'days').format('DD/MM/YYYY');\n    date2.update();\n  });\n });\n. Does this issue still occur in the latest version?\n. Thanks!\n. It looks real nice as a concept. We'd have to study this more though.\n. Because the modal element is already set on the page, it will inherit the css from its environment. Place the modals in a neutral place in the DOM, eg at the bottom.\n. It's not possible through an interface, but you can compile your own stripped down themes with the gulp-tools from the repository. See http://getuikit.com/docs/documentation_create-a-theme.html#how-to-start for how to. Here an example of the uikit.less file https://github.com/Bixie/uikit-bixie-theme/blob/master/big/uikit.less. If you need more help, give a shout here or on the Gitter chat.\n. This example may help you: http://codepen.io/malles/pen/qdOvJP\nThe autoplay is controlled by a separate button.\nTLDR;\nUIkit.on('init.uk.component', function(e, name, component) {\n  if (name === 'slideshow') {\n    UIkit.$('#autoplay').on('change.uk.button', function(e, active) {\n      component[(active ? 'start' : 'stop')]();\n    });\n  }\n});\nor just\njQuery(function ($) {\n  var slideshow = UIkit.slideshow('#slideshow');\n  $('#stop').click(function () {\n    slideshow.stop();\n  });\n});\n. Reading your title better, the slideshows autoplay is by default set to pasue when the user hovers the slideshow, and stops when he clicks the navigation buttons.\nSee the javascript options\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\nI applied your fix in the develop branche, I can't merge this PR since it is to the master branche\n. That can be done with:\n```\nUIkit.ready(function() {\n    UIkit.$('#yourGrid').filter('filter-a');\n});\n``\n. You can override that selector and set the content to that of the camera icon, \"\\f030\".\n. UIkit is used with webpack in Pagekit as well, and this does not seem to be an issue there. An amazing find!\nCould you please create a PR to thedevelop`-branche, so we can merge it.\n. It's ready for the next release: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/pull/1427\n. duplicate of #1420 \n. @PixelT I think it's a great solution!\n. Thanks!\n. Not the big zoom-functions you see in some webshops. The overlay component can provide a zoom effect: http://getuikit.com/docs/overlay.html#overlay-transitions\n. You luck out, I made some docs about out in this pen earlier: http://codepen.io/malles/pen/qEyEZr\n. Thanks, fixed it. \n. Thanks! They will be back: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/c38e8e888a2f4da5f50d67ec1606fd7a8369f787\n. @luetn A stethoscope :scream: I hope everything is allright?\n. This is indeed impossible since UIkit uses only one DOM element to show all tooltips. Only the content and position changes. So by definition, only one tooltip can be shown at a time.\n. It should work. Tooltip has moved from core to a component. Do you have it's js- file included?\n. Simular to https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/1420, we'll look into that\n. Yes, that can be done with some extra javascript. I created this Codepen as a demo:\nhttp://codepen.io/malles/pen/xweBge\n. As you can see in this demo it takes a bit of adjustments on the z-index to get it all right. \nThe z-index is a variable in the less code, so you can change the value in your style's variable settings.\n. The tests of scrollspy do not show this. The first three panels are exactly as your example.\nhttp://getuikit.com/tests/core/scrollspy.html\n. Thanks @robertotremonti \n. Simular to https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/1325\n. The docs pages of both components work fine on my Android. Do you have an example?\n. Stock Android browser has been dropped by Android, and is no longer supported. Use Chrome.\n. Stock Android browser has been dropped by Android, and is no longer supported. Use Chrome.\n. We can't merge PR's into the master branche, see https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md.\nWhat is the reason for this change?\n. Use an overlay-anchor for the image, that might work. http://getuikit.com/docs/overlay.html#overlay-anchor. You can use it without the panel or background.\n. I don't think so at the moment. \n. As far as I know, Javascript is enabled in all web browsers since the late nineties. (That is previous century :) )\nPlease check your local settings.\n. I can confirm the behaviour on my adriod device, opening the datepicker in the docs.\n. Yes, it is. Here is an example!\nhttp://codepen.io/malles/pen/NqmLLX?editors=101\n. You will need to load the slideshow-fx.js file for these more advanced transitions. See docs\n. Duplicate of https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/422\nUnfortunately, disabled buttons don't fire any events.\n. Yes, that's possible with a bit of code, see http://codepen.io/malles/pen/bdMMGB?editors=101\nvar accordion = UIkit.accordion(UIkit.$('#my-accordion'), {collapse:false, showfirst: false});\n   accordion.find('[data-wrapper]').each(function () {\n      accordion.toggleItem(UIkit.$(this), true, false); // animated true and collapse false\n   });\n. Thanks! It is fixed.\n. focus is passed into the function as a parameter. It prevents focussing twice when called from within itself for infinite sliders.\n. I must admit, it was not implemented properly before, it should already have been if (focus) this.updateFocus(0); in that line.\n. I had to figure it out myself too, but it's easy to do; just setup the input the way you want it to start. The form-password component just toggles text in toggler and the input type from text to password and reverse.\n<div class=\"uk-form-password\">\n        <input type=\"text\">\n        <a href=\"\" class=\"uk-form-password-toggle\" data-uk-form-password>Hide</a>\n    </div>\n. I can't see it on the source in Chrome..\n\nnor in a normal tab;\n\nDo you have a printscreen of the exact location?\n. No, they will only work when applied with the regular uk-width-* classes.\nFor source ordering, I advise you to use the flex component.\n. The event names should be formatted as the others in UIkit, event.uk.component, so active.uk.sticky and inactive.uk.sticky.\nIf you'd change that, we will certainly consider this PR.\n. The lightbox has its own plugins that handle the content. Here an example of an iframe handler:\nhttp://codepen.io/malles/pen/vEQgME\nYou could make similar for your case.\n. I can't really picture what it looks like tbh. Sounds good though. Do you have an example/codepen of this?\n. Fised with https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/d95cae413f2b09ab99bf794bfaa06765b7570c78\n. Check the test page of the sticky element and its source.\nSee the javascript options for the events fired by the element.\n. The notification is centered in the page. The modal does influence that. I don't see an easy workaround for this that would not cause more trouble than the initial problem.\n. Fixed in https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/d95cae413f2b09ab99bf794bfaa06765b7570c78\nThe docs template is not quite like the default template, that causes this. I kept the description a bit more general.\nThanks!\n. The modals are not kept in a collection. You could keep that collection for your self, by setting up the modals manually via js;\nvar modals;\nUIkit.$('.uk-modal').each(function () {\n   modals.push(UIkit.modal(UIkit.$(this), {options}));\n});\nEach modal instance has a method to check if it's opened modal.isActive().\n. Fixed in dev branch. Please don't make PR's to the master.\nThanks for reporting!\n. Thanks for reporting.\nPlease create PR's only to the master branch.\n. Do you mean slide or side? Can you provide a example? \n. http://codepen.io/malles/pen/EVzKQo\nIt seems to work fine here.\n. Always apply uk-contrast to the container: http://getuikit.com/docs/contrast.html#usage\n. When used correctly, the grid does not behave that way. Make sure you use the correct syntax and nesting for your grid elements.\n. The test page is usually the best demo\n. You're right, thank you!\n. Put the link in the panel:\n<div class=\"uk-panel\">\n    <div class=\"uk-align-left\">\n      <a href=\"/sf\">Where's my link?</a>\n    </div>\n    here we are!\n  </div>\n. Thanks!\n. The selectitem.uk.autocomplete event is triggered on the data-uk-autocomplete element, not the input.\n$(\"[data-uk-autocomplete]\").on(\"selectitem.uk.autocomplete\", function(a, b, c) { console.log(b); })\n. Do you have a demo for that?\n. You should always use the type=\"button\" attribute on button elements when they are in a form and don't need to submit. This is left out of the example for simplification purposes.\n. Sorry for the backlog in issues. I don't see the issue on the test-page. http://getuikit.com/tests/core/scrollspy.html. Are you still having issues? If so can you provide an example in a codepen/jsfiddle?\n. You have to create some javascript logic to open the modal. http://getuikit.com/docs/modal.html#javascript\nIt is indeed not an issue for this framework.\n. This is not possible, UIkit is dynamically converted to RTL by javascript.\n. The best way to do this, is to clone a local copy of this UIkit repo, and create a custom theme and customizer. This is a big chore for once, and will give you much more development and design power once set up.\n. UIkit is a lightweight framework, meant to be included in projects or larger systems. In order to keep that lightweight and non-bloated property, these kind of additions are up to the implementation of the framework. \n. This is a known issue, and we have not been able to fix this. Using another browser for this task is the best workaround for now.\n. You are hiding the modal element, not only the modal. $(\"#searchModal\").hide();\nSee this example for controlling the modal: http://getuikit.com/docs/modal.html#javascript\n. The touchscreen can't detect your finger hovering over the screen, you will have to touch it :)\n. The uk-dragholder class is used and defined in the upload component: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/develop/src/less/components/upload.less#L26\n. When cloning, destroy the UIkit component when already initialized, or it will keep a reference to the created dropdown/tooltip.\n$('$my-dropdown').data('dropdown', null),clone();\n. I think it looks fine in the general scheme: http://getuikit.com/tests/core/contrast.html#\nIn your code you lose the difference between hover and active.\n. Although most options are reviewed in the page, I think an overview would make sense, as most components have it.\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/pull/1828\n. The loading of the components have changed in version 2.26.2. The data-uk-observe attribute is no longer needed, nor is initialization in eg angular apps.\nCould you please try and test if that improves matters?\n. I really recommend using the latest jQuery 2 version.\n. These kind of storage and state logic really should be in the code of the app controlling the UIkit components, not in the component itself. Here are some examples on how to control the UIkit switcher: http://codepen.io/malles/pen/BNXrmO\n. I don't see why that would make more sense than wrapping them in an element with the uk-form class.\n. Do you have an example url or preferable jsfiddle/codepen that shows the issue?\n. You can access the initialized component via the UIkit function you use. It will return the existing instance if exists. If you init the component as you showed, the instance will be in the accordion var.\njavascript\nvar accordion = UIkit.accordion(element, {collapse:true});\n//change options\naccordion.options.collapse = false;\n. I think the key here is the trade-off between being light-weight and being robust/performant in all situations.I think it would be great if velocity could be used as an option. The UIkit default animations for basic usage, and velocity when more performance is needed on complex pages.\n. We had noticed the discrepancy in the docs. They have been adjusted in the develop branch already: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/efc5a52c0b3e0f09ed8f3ae38feb8d350d716cb3\nThey will go live on the next release.\n. Couldn't this just be\nvar stacked = parseFloat(firstvisible.css('width')) <= parseFloat(parent.css('width')),?\n. I think this should be changed to normal, as the value was This could break builds when you build without the base component.\n. ",

It works for me in Opera 12.16 and latest Chrome 33.0.1707.0, Linux.\n. I want to store reference to DOM object, that is not possible to serialize, but possible with .data() method.\n. This is connected with #162, currently I need to use internal functionality directly through $.UIkit.tab in order to realize functionality, that I mentioned in that pull request - connect switcher not by id, but by position in dom (next element after tab).\nIn case of .data() usage I can set connect property not as selector, but as jQuery collection, and there will be no need to use $.UIkit.tab directly.\n. Also it will be more consistent with other components.\n. I know, because at this time it is checked twice: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/js/tab.js#L9\n. But that is only for one moment, it disappears immediately after creation.\n. Of course\n. RTL Mode is shown in two lines, but checkboxes are available now.\n. I've applied such workaround for myself:\ncss\n.uk-grid > .uk-article {\n    margin-top : 0;\n}\n. My bad, bug in css minifier\n. @khanduras, just look at customizer. All components are already there and css contains styles for everything.\n. About https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/560#issuecomment-51617251\nIt is great that you use observers, but I'm not sure you'll be able to observe elements inside shadowDOM, and it might be useful to have possibility to initiate UIkit on some root element manually.\nI'm using them (shadowDOM and custom elements) a lot, and it is really important for me. Also, there will be even wider usage of Web Components with time.\n. Can anyone take a look at this while it is not very outdated?\nPatch is simple.\n. Merged latest master, find some tme to look at this, please.\n. I think you got me wrong. I'm not asking to remove any font format, just to make it configurable.\n. Yes, customizer is buggy now, path to icons font in css that customizer gives is core/icon/fonts/fontawesome-webfont.woff instead of ../fonts/fontawesome-webfont.woff in distributive on GitHub (and as it was previously).\nUntil they fix it, you can just modify path manually in css file.\nI wanted to report this issue, but found this one.\n. Possible realization in pull request #700\n. @aheinze, my last fix was really wrong, sorry about that. #1112 is clear and simple, does just what it should and not likely to break any existing code that uses it.\n. #1117 is against develop branch\n. Sorry, my fault.\n. Basically https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src%2Fless%2Fcomponents%2Fform-advanced.less#L43\nThis block is present in Almost Flat theme generated in customizer and not present in distributive (was present as of 2.12.0)\nFrom customizer rules: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/themes%2Falmost-flat%2Fuikit-customizer.less#L16\nThere is definitely inconsistency somewhere.\n. Probably, additional checkbox in customizer would solve this.\n. Here is simple script written in PHP that successfully converts UIkit (and any other) CSS file into such that will work inside Shadow DOM (requires native support from browser or polyfill to work). You can use it as reference, media queries, imports and other stuff should work fine.\n. @cajoy, use the script I've mentioned, it works in CleverStyle CMS which extensively uses Web Components.\n. @cajoy, now you have \"or no\")\nIn fact, solution might be to have 2 css files, because if you have Shadow DOM-specific css constructions it will broke whole css file all in browsers that doesn't support it (majority right now).\nIn my system polyfills are bundled and third party libraries are patched if necessary to provide the best possible Web Components experience out of the box (I didn't hear about any other system that have such level of support currently).\nIf you don't have PHP you can rewrite that code in any other language and use it, for example, in your build system.\nI do not expect UIkit developers to implement this anytime soon, so I wrote it myself and shared what works for me (it is not like \"may work\", it does actually work with any possible kind of CSS including any imports and media queries, including already processed, so that you can safely apply it twice and more times to the same file).\nAt least developers know this issue and hopefully have some checkbox not very far in TODO list.\n. Yes, sorry, just edited example. I wanted to simplify it because there is an issue #814 with the same class combination without uk-grid-small,\n. What about this? I can make pull request if you would like to merge it.\n. Whoops, sorry\n. Finally figured out how to fix this, look at PR #1304\n. @piotr-cz, yes, it is possible to happen, but very unlikely.\nOfficial guide suggests to have structure like .uk-tab > li > a, so probability of .uk-tab > li > article is negligible.\nWhy is it mandatory? Everything works perfectly without it and code relies on elements order rather than on href value and ids (seems to be true in past, but not now).\nOf course, copying is awkward, I'd suggest to replace it with:\njavascript\nclone = $(item[0].outerHTML);\nclone.children('a').attr('data-index', i);\nThis might be a better fix, I just wanted to make minimal code changes here.\n.

Even with a normal space they glue together too much with many fonts, which affects readability. I am aware that simple adding right padding could be conflicting with icons that should align to the right. But maybe you know some clever trick :-)\nNOT PRIO: (maybe) have a modifier that make uk-icons same width so they look better in a simple phone/fax/email list for example where lines of text start with an icon each. Right now I use a table or let the icon float left in that case. I am even not sure this can be programmed in a framework, I just wanted to mention it.\n. 1+ for relative font sizes\n. slideshow fullscreen toggle button for making a slideshow normally embedded but fullscreen-enlarged on demand (as known from flash)\n. dynamic grid - multiple categories for filtering?\nExample case: one doctor can work in many practices.\n(if this has been asked for already, pls. excuse)\n. @malles From the manual multiple categories work for sorting, filtering is not mentioned there???

The Form-File component needs a user feedback, i.m.h.o\nThe only way to see that the button has a file selected, right noiw is a changed title tag tooltip.\nWhat I would expect: being able to change the color or name of the button to the file, or add a \u221a icon,\nand/or show the filename (like the original browser button would do it\nor did I overlook something?\n. I like the animations but the animations.css that you find on the web makes more subtle and elegant movements. I like UIkit's \"modern\" look in gereral, but find bootstrap + animation.css still superior, if it comes to certain animations.\nMovements which do not look robots-like but human, are the trend: smart timing differentiation between instances (what UIkit has started already) and interesting, non linear movements, visibilitiy and easing. (Had you considered something like velocity.js? )\n. In case not mentioned yet, nice hover effects, like:\nhttp://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/\n. ...why not adding then something that does the opposite:\n.uk-showonly-print for something that is normally uk-hidden.\nI use a css of that sort to show an extra address and phone number on printouts.\n. Hi creativesprite, great reply, thank you! I already have a script which is exactly doing that.\nI just thought this is worth considering having it in a framework for easy access.\nI need that often and others might need that too.\nA framework (from my understanding) does not do things that could not be done otherwise. \nIt just bundles often needed things into one piece of code for quick and easy usage.\n. OK, I understand. Is this a general \"no\" to tabs remote control or do you consider some other way?\n. +1\n. +1 ...and fixed-width icon modifiers (for lists) I would appreciate very much as well.\n. was it THAT simple?\n. ok, I reopen it for you so this can be investigated further :-)\nYour comment lead to a solution in a slightly different direction, using panels. \nThis works here:\n<div class=\"uk-grid uk-grid-match\" data-uk-grid-match=\"{target:'.align_height'}\">\n    <div class=\"uk-width-large-1-2 align_height\">\n        <div class=\"uk-panel uk-panel-box\" data-uk-scrollspy=\"{cls:'uk-animation-scale-down'}\">\n            TEXT\n        </div>\n    </div>\n        ....\nDon't ask me why ;-) \n. The problem was something else: My navbar, which holds the uk-dropdowns was \"position:fixed, z-index:1\". And the uk-sticky menu changed to \"position:fixed\" as well - on srolling through UIkit.\nThose two layers were fighting. Setting up my navbar (not the included uk-dropdowns!) to a very high z-index fixed it.\n. I realized that the way to do this changed a lot but I got my elements working using the new scrollspy group together with uk-invisible, as seen hidden in the example source code (not the example explanation, maybe that one could need a better explanation).\n. Thanks malles, I just tried this, and not even adding \"!important\" helped:\n< iframe class=\"t_iframe uk-responsive-width\" height=\"300\" width=\"940\" style=\"max-width:100% !important;\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"<?=$showtime_complete_url ?>\" data-uk-check-display></iframe...\nNo improvement, unfortunately.\n. thank you... I am not using the lightbox here, my iframe contains an Adobe Edge Animate element and it is a header element with 100% width on top of a page.\n. from the changelog, which came with the firefox update today, there seems to be a known, yet unresolved problem with responsive images under Firefox right now:\nhttps://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/38.0.5/releasenotes/\n. Same problem is with the great new validation plugin, formvalidation.io.\nThere is a jsfiddle there, which shows the problem:\nhttps://github.com/formvalidation/support/issues/256\n. Yes, I could tweak UIKIT to my needs by adding some of my own CSS on top. :-)\nI just thought that this is such a standard task that I wanted to mention this here. I.m.h.o. this could be included as a UIkit standard behavior (option?) - or at least it would be useful to have a solution illustrated in the docs, don't you think?\n. Cool. Do you have a rough example how you would do this with Flex and Utility? \nI solved this for me using a custom class for radio-input and -label - but using UIKIT would be preferable to adding my own stuff. This is what solved my problem right now (on top of UIKIT):\n. radio_input {\n     float: left;\n}\n. radio_label {\n      margin: -9px 10% 20px 20px;\n      display: block;\n      line-height: 1.3;\n}\n.radio_label:after {\n      content: \"\";\n      clear: both;\n      display: table;\n}\n.

That does the trick.\n. I appears that having height=100% on both the html and body element causes the page to scroll to the top again when opening a dialog. (Using v2.8)\n. In Firefox at least, the page scrolls to the top, but is restored to the previous scrolled position after the modal is closed. All other browsers I tested scrolls to the top and remains there after the modal is closed.\nMaybe the scroll position can be saved when opening a dialog and restored manually after the dialog has been closed.\nExample:\nIn modal.show()\nactive = this;\n    scroll = body.scrollTop(); // save the scroll position\n    $html.addClass(\"uk-modal-page\").height(); // force browser engine redraw\nThen in model._hide():\n$html.removeClass(\"uk-modal-page\").css(\"margin-\" + (UI.langdirection == 'left' ? \"left\":\"right\"), \"\");\n    body.scrollTop(scroll); // restore the scroll position\n.

See under \"WebKit-prefixed properties on the standard track\".)\nhttp://alistapart.com/article/the-vendor-prefix-predicament-alas-eric-meyer-interviews-tantek-celik\n. @anthony-redFox \n\nHow I know uikit support IE9+\n\nWhich of the following 2, or both ?\n1) You don't have IE9+ installed?\n2) Or you don't know how to test IE9+ compatibility?\nFor 1) go here and download a Guest/VM (for Windows, Mac, or Linux hosts) with Windows and IE pre-installed in the Guest/VM : http://www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools#downloads\nBTW, it's a Microsoft site, so the OS licensing is OK.\nAnd, I forgot about that jQuery fact. Hehe! Thanks for mentioning.\n@srsgores \nRegarding adding the missing vendor prefixes, and refactoring of keyframes :\nHave you actually tested properties like transition: transform and keyframes in IE7, IE8, and IE9 ?\n\nSo given that we can start to use these javascript-dependant LESS libraries, since compilation is now taking place client-side, that might be an option.\n\nCompiling Less client side, in a live environment, is considered bad practice.\nAlso, 16% usage might seem high, but that's worldwide.\nIf you and your clients get all of those 16% 10% 1% and 4.9% to your website than congratulations, because you've got it made. And should keep supporting all those browsers.\nI'm not seeing much of those visiting at my own sites, clients, and buyers of my themes, although I do support IE9+, the 16%, and other browsers.\nI can understand that you still want/must support old browsers, but that shouldn't burden/bloat the framework.\nWhy not try to make this a completely separate and optional add-on (file or files) which anyone like you who still wants/must support older browsers can compile in?\nRemember old browser hacks could also introduce border and edge cases in modern browsers. I'm not looking for more (unwanted) work.\nAnd it will also be easier for you and others to drop support when the time comes.\nAlso it doesn't make sense for others to have CSS rules added to their stylesheets for which no support will be given by the designer/developer of the theme.\nDebugging CSS (and coming up with a workaround which works cross-browser) is already harder than debugging JavaScript. Let's not complicate it even more for people who do not support these older browsers.\nRegarding IE, I only support from IE9+ and others.\nIn the message to visitors with old browsers (taken from H5BP) I added this URL : http://portableapps.com/apps/internet\nWhere they can get a portable version of a modern browser. And either run it from a USB stick or from a folder on their HDD (without system changes).\nA large portion of those visitors with older IE browsers, are (local) government or banks. This is a much heard/read excuse.\nThis means :\nMost visitors, are visiting from their workplace, and are not proper visitors. They should be doing something else. Or use their own notebook with a modern browser.\nVisitors have low authorization level To install missing stuff to display your page (more) correctly.\nNo flash (which is necessary for zombie cookies from PayPal, eBay, Amazon, and others).\nLimited JavaScript Some commands do not work.\nCaching proxies Your pages might look the same to everybody. Good or bad.\nProxies Everyone from that bank has the same IP.\nPayment gateways Sometimes do not work. They silenty fail. Deliberately sabotaged through scripting. Nice for your visitors to see their EFT hang and silently die, without any message. Did that payment go through? Should I try again, or will that make it a double payment? Would they try again when they get home?\nThey'll probably blame you and your theme for it.\nI decided to build my next WP theme with UIkit instead of Foundation 4, because it is much more suited for the WP platform. There are typical usage patterns and constructs in WP and Joomla which are harder to achieve in F4, but which are native in UIkit.\nUIkit has a clean and modern setup. And it's slim.\nIf support for IE up to and including IE8 is added, I'm moving on to continue the quest.\nHow is UIkit going to make anyone \"build fast and powerful web interfaces\" (taken from UIkit's slogan) within IE7 and IE8? The rendering engine of those 2 is already dead slow.\nI still wish you good luck with all this. It's just a difference in opinion and views. And I do not have the illusion that I will be able to change yours. Nor do I want to. ;)\nBut personally, I hope that support for these old \"browsers\" is never added to UIkit. Enough is enough.\n. @srsgores I asked you the following. Which you just ignore.\nRegarding adding the missing vendor prefixes, and refactoring of keyframes :\nHave you actually tested properties like transition: transform and keyframes in IE7, IE8, and IE9 ?\nI'm actually trying to help you with that question.\nBecause transition and keyframes do not exist in IE7/IE8/IE9.\nIE9 only supports transform. So the transform will be instantaneous, not animated.\nIE10/IE11 support transition, transform and keyframes without prefix.\nThe best you can do for IE7/IE8/IE9 is fallback to jQuery's animate(). But the distributed version of jQuery doesn't support IE7 and IE8.\nOpening a pull request is a good thing.\nBut opening a pull request for untested code/markup, which on top of that attempts to add support for non-existing functionality is just not done.\nYou are right, let's leave it up to the maintainers to decide.\n@aheinze @saschadube \n. @srsgores Wow! You're following me now.\n. @shenjiayu\nHave you got the following line in your page's <head> section?\n``` html\n    \n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">\n\n</head>\n\n```\nThe same issue here : https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/143\n. Will these be added in addition to existing vertical alignment classes?\nOr will they completely replace the already existing classes?\n. Even WordPress Core is adopting Sass apparently : http://wptavern.com/wordpress-core-adopts-sass-css-preprocessor\nThe last line of the article links to this : https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/26137\n. With uk-width-* grid columns are supposed to stay side-by-side. That's how the grid was designed.\nhttp://getuikit.com/docs/grid.html\n    Class   Description\n    .uk-width-*   Affects all device widths, grid columns stay side by side.\n    .uk-width-small-* Affects device widths of 480px and higher. Grid columns will stack on smaller sizes.\n    .uk-width-medium-*    Affects device widths of 768px and higher. Grid columns will stack on smaller sizes.\n    .uk-width-large-* Affects device widths of 960px and higher. Grid columns will stack on smaller sizes.\n. You probably just need your markup changed. (Haven't seen your markup though.)\nThe  reason (in your 2nd example) that the sticky sidebar is not going through anything below it, is that (together with the main content) it is wrapped into a container content-wrapper. This container wrapper is stacked on top of the container which wraps the footer footer-wrapper.\nWithin content-wrapper, the main content and sidebar are also wrapped in their own container. Classed/Named content and sticky-wrap respectively. (sticky-wrap sits within sidebar actually.)\nIn the markup below (taken from your 2nd example), sticky-wrap is the equivalent of uk-sticky.\n``` HTML\n\n\n\nSticky Block Example\nLorem ipsum blah dee blah dee blah ...\n\n    <!-- M A I N  C O N T E N T  A N D  S I D E B A R -->\n\n<div class=\"content-wrapper\">\n\n        <!-- M A I N  C O N T E N T -->\n\n   <div class=\"content\">\n     <img src=\"image.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n     <p>Nulla eget gravida  blah dee blah dee blah ...</p>\n     <p>Duis sed laoreet lectus.

Hi @Surbma, \nClassuk-stickyis defined in all 3 add-on stylesheets : https://github.com/uikit/uikit/tree/master/dist/css/addons\nIt's automatically added bysticky.jswhen the attributedata-uk-sticky` is specified on an element. I was just referring to it as the target of the JS.\nI converted your 2nd example to use the UIkit framework, and posted it at JSbin.\nJSbin : http://jsbin.com/moxipohi/2/\nEDIT: I added background colors to make it more clear what is scrolling/happening.\nYou're right the sticky.js JS should stop scrolling when the bottom of the article levels with the bottom of the sidebar (similar to what is done in the JS in your 2nd example). But it doesn't.\nMaybe Yootheme will add/fix it. (Or we both did it wrong. Heh heh.)\n. Just tested. Confirming that the issue is fixed.\nThanks!\n. Lookie look : https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/217#issuecomment-31829807\n. To make it easier to use another grid system\nRemove the grid dependency from the dropdowns.\nAt the moment the grid classes uk-grid and uk-width- are only used in dropdown.less.\nuk-push* and uk-pull* are not used in Less files.\n(Of course I'm excluding grid.less.)\nThe JavaScript doesn't use any of the grid classes (uk-grid*, uk-width*, uk-push*, uk-pull*).\n. Cleaning wipes all style sheets first.\nI need the original style sheets as a reference to compare against my style guides.\n(All my style guides also have a version which pulls in the stock style sheet.)\nSo when I recreate the stock style sheets the issue occurs again in my custom style sheets.\nLet's leave this as is. I'll fix it here with a changed Gulp script.\nYou're assigned and refuse to do it.\n. ",
    "kraymitchell": "Thanks RobertinoValue\nWorked like a charm! Well, mostly anyway, now I can do up my CSS for mobile too.\n.

Can you explain what you mean?\nEDIT: I did not know at the time of adding this issue that you were compiling client-side using less.js.  So would the &:extends directive now work, as you updated to the latest less.js version?  I may test shortly...\n. Ok, commits are mostly done.  Please have a look, and I will appreciate your comments.\n. @RobertinoValue, thanks for your input.  I still think that it's our job as developers to accommodate for \"border\" or \"edge\" cases.  The only disadvantage to supporting more browsers is longer CSS files.  I might suggest a set of boolean variables to turn on and off browser support, but I still think the support is needed (like in LESSHat).  So given that we can start to use these javascript-dependant LESS libraries, since compilation is now taking place client-side, that might be an option.  Like it or not, 16% is a large percentage, and part of quality assurance for UIs, IMO, is making sure it works on all browsers: new and old.\nDon't get me wrong: I want to move the web forward too.  But with preprocessors like LESS, we really don't need to worry about this anymore.  It's the same amount of code that we see.  We cannot rely on the user updating the browser.\nThis is, of course, a highly-debated topic, and I will leave the browser support issue to the maintainers.  My fork will always be IE7+ compatible.\n. @RobertinoValue, thanks again for your feedback.  I value your points, and I think that you're right in that a customizable approach may be most desirable.  I think it shouldn't be too hard to update the mixins to toggle support for legacy browsers.  In the mean time, I leave it up to the maintainers to decide on how to deal with support issues.\n. ",

I don't get your problem, everything is fine?\nhttp://steambrazuca.com.br/projeto/css/uikit.min.css\nThere is a uk-panel in here and the style is applied.\nWhat do you think the site should look like?\nEdit:\nNow I see, you mean the panel does not get styled.\nWell you need the correct sub-classes as in the panel demo:\nhttp://getuikit.com/docs/panel.html\n.

Nope, doesn't seem to be included for now: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/dist/css/uikit.css#L5742\nSection doesn't include any coloring like tooltip-danger, tooltip-warning or such.\n. Why not create subclasses for colors like warning, error, success and such?\n. You could create a GIST and add a link to it?\nIf you don't provide the source, it's impossible to help you.\n. ",

Fixed.\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/84b0fd1553c8a1e8874344481942d4a7f528f91b\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/9226facde43ccf04a296c5ba198f9fd2d665c05b\n. I've looked into this and started working on the work contributed by @anotherZero's pull request as this seemed to be an easily maintainable approch. Check out my fork if you want: https://github.com/florianletsch/uikit\nHowever, there is a huge difference in variable semantics. Simply put, LESS will output the value a variable has last had while SCSS will output the value the variable has at its position in the script. Our theming approach is based on this system, as we are loading the core uikit files and then load the theme files that change variable values. In SCSS this would need to be the other way around. \nAs an illustration of this difference, check out this simple example: SCSS version versus LESS version.\nWe're open for input. How do others solve this without rearranging everything by hand?\n. @zslabs That exactly is the plan. We've played around with the grunt tasks and simple search/replace works pretty well for the plain syntax differences. \nHowever, because LESS has late/lazy binding of variable values and hooks and SASS does not, we need to restructure the complete code base. \nRight now, one component can overwrite a value that is used above, even in the core components. This is why styling works so well. With SASS, we have to make sure that all values are set before they are being referenced for the first time and that nothing overwrites them throughout the CSS generation (because then it will use one value at first and then the second value for all later references). \nThis is the reason why a SASS port isn't as straight forward as I thought at first. But yes, it's on the roadmap. :)\n. @nnjpp Why is that UI toolkit you're building not possible with LESS?\nCurrent state is that we've started working on a SASS port which will come with the new UIkit 3.0. As the whole codebase will be restructured for that there will not be an official sass port for the 2.9 version. And also, there's no official timeframe announced at this point. Link to official announcement blog post: http://yootheme.com/blog/2014/08/08/whats-up-yootheme\n. @yhaow +1 for what? The sass port is available already :) http://getuikit.com/docs/documentation_less-sass.html\n. The datepicker does not require jQueryMobile or jQueryUI. It still requires uikit and therefore jQuery. There is no intention on releasing any of the addons by itself.\n. So you are talking about the sublime package I'm assuming? https://github.com/uikit/uikit-sublime\nThe way auto completion should behave is the following: inside a tag <anyelement HERE> you should receive suggestions for all uk-data-* attributes. Inside the quoted string class=\"HERE you should see suggestions for all uk-* css classes. A box should never pop up by default but only when you start typing a class name. This is what it looks like on my system: http://quick.as/pr9Ai0nJ\nNow, the behaviour you describe sounds wrong. Please specify the operating system you're on. Which syntax highlighting have you set? The above recording was for syntax highlighting set to HTML, others might behave differently.\n. @blaasvaer: Thanks for the details. Please tell me which syntax highlighting you've activated when you encounter that problem. (displayed on the right on the bottom status bar, works fine with \"HTML\" for me).\n. Leave as is. This would interfere with one-page sites using window.location for routing. \n. Can you specify what exactly is happening? I don't notice anything unusual when going to that page on my iPhone. \n. This has been fixed a while ago.\n. This has nothing to do with PHP but with you inserting the HTML at runtime (using jQuery). In order to have UIkit pick up those elements and apply the data attributes, you need to add data-uk-observe on the parent element in the DOM. Please have a look at the appropriate section in the docs: http://getuikit.com/docs/documentation_javascript.html#dom-observe\n. Thanks for reporting. But I don't see that error. \nPlease empty your browser cache, as it's probably still loading the old UIkit files. That should fix it.\n. :+1: \n. I see the following behaviour: \n- Background doesn't scroll on Desktop devices. (Mac OS, Chrome + FF)\n- Background scrolls on touch devices. (iOS8 Safari) \nAnyone's got an idea where to start looking into this issue?\nThe following lines in modal.less should prevent scrolling. Somehow this doesn't work on iOS.\ncss\n.uk-modal-page,\n.uk-modal-page body { overflow: hidden; }\n. Did you ever manage to resolve this or at least narrow down the issue?\n. And please provide a JSfiddle or Codepend with the issue.\n. I've added documentation for the JS options. Will go online when with the next release\n. Fix will be included in the next release.\n. Hm, when I print in Firefox, it doesn't seem to throw anything away. Some of the content gets pushed to the second page however, so there's definetly something going on. Not sure if this is a core UIkit issue or the getuikit.com custom css that's messing things up.\nDo you have a link to one of your pages where this is happening?\n. On pure touch devices this seems to work without any issue (tested on iOS at least). I guess the issue relates to mixed devices (click + touch capabilities). We'll somehow need to get our hands on a test device to figure this out.\n@meriturva Have you tested on a smartphone or tablet if you get the same issue there?\n. Thanks @malles.\n. Can't reproduce 2 weeks later.\n. Can't seem to reproduce anymore. Will reopen in case I encounter this issue again.\n. Not that I know of. Maybe ask around in the community: https://plus.google.com/communities/114238665434626719878\nIf you find one (or want to create one?) please report back. \n. I'm torn on this. The aundance of -, --, __, _ just looks... weird to me. This is just a personal perception of course, the current names with just single dashes feel cleaner. \nI still get it though, right now there's no distinction between modifier classes and sub components (aka elements according to BEM), and strict BEM would help with that.\nWhat is your personal take on this? Did you have the same doubts in the beginning but just followed along and got used to what the classes look like? Or am I just being picky here? :)\nWhat does BEM say about state classes (uk-active) and utility classes (uk-text-center) anyway, how would those work out?\n. Good point\n. Thanks for reporting! In which scenario does this break the grid in Safari? Could you provide an example in a CodePen or similar?\n. Ok I see. The reason this breaks is because old versions of Safari Mobile do not support the new flex syntax. Here's the support chart from http://caniuse.com/#search=flex \n\nWe will not include this fix, because UIkit only supports mobile Safari 7.1 and later.\nIf you need to support older versions of mobile Safari, you should include this fix yourself. To do this, you should probably create your custom UIkit theme to keep the UIkit core and your customizations separate. Here's how you can do that: http://getuikit.com/docs/documentation_create-a-theme.html (just start by copying the default theme and working from there).\nI hope this resolves the issue. Thanks for taking the time to look into the grid issue.\n. Oops, sorry. Sometimes it just looks easy in the beginning. ;)\nThanks, a Codepen would be great then.\n. The gulp task is working fine for me. I've added to the docs to explain how to actually build the theme. The docs will go online with the new release.\nIf this still doesn't work for you, please report back with a more detailed description of your folder structure and the steps you're executing.\n. What exactly do you mean with flickering? When exactly does that happen? \nI can only test iOS 8 right now but can't seem to reproduce that. Are you testing on older devices?

Could you pack this into a CodePen or JSfiddle? Makes it easier to reproduce on the same code. Thanks.\n. Great answer malles!\n. You're right. Browser support for the download attribute doesn't include Safari or IE. Guess we'll need to find another solution. http://caniuse.com/#feat=download\n. The editor is not inside an iframe, so the css is injected into the regular DOM. So when using general selectors like body this changes the global look of the site. This is expected behaviour.\nThis makes sense if you think of using the editor for a blog post and want to inject that css in the blog post's global CSS.\nIf you're trying to target something specific, just use selectors less general than body.\nHope this answers the question.\n. Awesome, thanks @malles \n. Thanks @malles :+1: \n. Thanks malles. :+1: \n. thanks!\n. You could either:\n1. Duplicate the almost-flat folder and use it as a starting point for your own theme\n2. Create your own less file and import the uikit.less of the almost-flat theme, then add your customizations below:\n``` less\n@import \"path/to/themes/almost-flat/uikit.less\";\n// your customizations here\n```\n. @Skymidt Can you provide a live example (codepen, jsfiddle) for us to have a look at your particular code? As you can see in the example by malles, it should actually work.\n. Thanks for your suggestion.\nYou can use the hooks in less to inject styles like this in the grid css. If you need it, just add it to your own theme. Here is how you do that: http://getuikit.com/docs/documentation_create-a-theme.html\nI think that is a good solution already, so I don't think we need to add this to the uikit core.\n. Yes, please add the uk-grid yourself like in the example above. Please also checkout the source code of the examples located at: http://getuikit.com/tests/components/slideset.html\nReplicating those should work in your own code. If not, can you please prepare a codepen or jsfiddle for us to inspect the issue? Thanks.\n. Thanks for reporting. \nWhat is your file setup (are you importing all files or just specific ones?)\nAre you experiencing this on the current version or an older one?\n. I'm no sass expert. But could you show the generated css from your sass code?\n. Looks like the box-sizing isn't set correctly because the clever selector [class*='uk-width'] doesn't apply to your semantic class names. That's why some styles needed for the width classes are not applied here.\nThe short answer is probably that extending uikit's default classes for semantic names is not supported. Long answer is that you can add some css to fix the missing styles, but I'm not sure if that's what you were going for. \ncss\n.ce_image, .ce_text {\n  -moz-box-sizing: border-box;\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n  width: 100%;\n}\nExample: http://codepen.io/florianletsch/pen/WvOEEG\n. If I'm not mistaken, the default font uses Helvetica or Arial right from your system, which should support cyrillic characters. Could you provide a demo (Codepen or JSfiddle) with your issue?\n. The off-by-1 error should have been fixed since you reported this.\nI not exactly sure what kind of focus you talk about. I will close this for now, but please report back with more details, if the focus issue still exists.\n. Alternatively, you can use plain CSS for a similar effect.\n``` css\n/ 1. optional: smoothes the scaling /\nimg {\n  transition: transform ease 0.2s;\n}\n/ 2. here's the trick: zoom on hover /\nimg:hover {\n  transform: scale(1.05);\n}\n```\nLive example: http://codepen.io/florianletsch/pen/vNregz\n. Fixed by https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/255c0bf38c6a3f9ee8ff98e8be1974a228d0bea8\n. Wow, this is really unusable. However, I already seem to be having these issues just when scrolling. Firefox seems to take some really long time for redrawing. \nI opened the run time analysis tab in the Firefox web tools. It seems like this actually isn't related to UIkit, or at least not exclusively? \nThe browser seems to be taking most time in the code from the slider script you have included. I have attached the screenshot (sorry it's in German). I guess you will need to look into that a bit further yourself. Good luck!\n\n. Thanks for the PR. Will go online with the next release.\n. Thanks!\n. Can you provide a live example of your issue?\n. Can you please elaborate? What is your question, what is your issue?\n. You will need to include jQuery.js and uikit.min.js. If you still have the issue, please report back with a live example so that we can have a look at it. Thanks.\n. Thanks for the idea. That's probably a good discussion for UIkit 3. Feel free to add your input there; https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/560 \nIcons are already under discussion because it might be good to move away from the Icon font and have SVG icons instead.\n. This is probably related to auto prefixer. \nI remember a similar issue a while ago. If I remember correctly it was related to different behaviour of the flex layout if you add the -webkit- prefix. That is why the uikit code does not include the prefix for the grid on purpose. When you use autoprefixer, this will break.\nPlease try disabling autoprefixer, everything should already be properly prefixed in the core less/scss. If you want to use autoprefixer for your own styles, maybe split your scss files so that you only apply it on your own code.\n. Yes, the brand is only meant to include a single line. It is for a brand name etc, not meant to be used as a style for single menu items. \nIf you want to change the look of the single items, you should rather change the default style for these items. I hope this clears things up.\n. Please provide an example (Codepen or JSfiddle) if this doesn't work for you. Thanks\n. Could you elaborate? I am not familiar with Typescript. What does the .d.ts definition do?\n. Hey,\ngood observation and thanks for the suggestion. The reasoning here is that there are 2 packages: A \"Quickstart\" package with just the compiled CSS and JS files. And a \"source\" package which is available in the Github repository.\nActually, every release on Github has a .zip file attached to it, which also only includes the compiled files.\nI guess you pressed the \"Download Zip\" button on Github? That will simply download the repository as a zip file.\nI understand this could be explained bit clearer. Do you have any good suggestion for this? Thanks!\n. Hm. Close to where the error happens, I see a hardcoded uk- prefix. In line 250: anim = cls.match(/uk-animation-(.+)/);. can you try to replace uk-with your prefix b01- and see if that works?\nLooks like the uk- prefix is not correctly replaced in the build process. Probably because of the escaped \\- in that line: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/3ad8015e68124d66f9cd72316fa3b6b471fcf9c8/src/js/core/core.js#L249\n. Did you confirm that replacing the prefix manually in that line fixed it? If that's the case we need to fix the build process.\n. Markdown rendering is done by marked.js which is only used by uikit, but it is a separate project. You could request the feature there: https://github.com/chjj/marked\nHowever, I don't think spoilers are part of the implemented markdown specification, they are probably only added by stackoverflow for their needs.\nBut checkout the marked project, maybe there is an easy way to add additional syntax features easily, I am not familiar with the project.\n. It might have been broken when you reported this. Now, it should work. Also look at this new section in the docs, even though your setup might look a little different. This should all work now with the current release. We have also added a basic tutorial to the docs: https://getuikit.com/docs/webpack. I am not sure this is actually an issue. \nSince... always, the direct children of the grid container have had some styles assigned to them. It is usually required to nest elements inside the grid columns. Look for example at the grid examples from the official docs, such as https://getuikit.com/docs/grid#match-height\nhtml\n<div class=\"uk-grid-match uk-child-width-expand@s uk-text-center\" uk-grid>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"uk-card uk-card-default uk-card-body\">Item</div>\n     </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"uk-card uk-card-default uk-card-body\">Item<br>...</div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"uk-card uk-card-default uk-card-body\">Item<br>...<br>...</div>\n    </div>\n</div>\nAs you mention, having such a nested markup works (which is also why the uk-text-center works in above example.\nI think we therefore won't need to overwrite the text align for these cases, as using such markup already solves the issue.. Icons have a \"ratio\" parameter to change their size: https://getuikit.com/docs/icon#ratio\n<div class=\"responsive-block\">\n     <span uk-icon=\"icon: cloud-upload; ratio: 2\"></span>\n</div>. What do you mean exactly with \"issues\"? Of course, the navbar is also sticky, so the examples arent exactly how you would implement it in your own site. But at least it highlights what the sticky looks like without an offset. Hm, what would you suggest instead?\n\n. As long as their templateing engine supports the laoding of all required assets (CSS and JS), UIkit can be used for any kind of templating. I guess further discussion should happen on their channels, as it is not directly related to UIkit,. I think we will keep the current options of the visibility component. Special preferences like this can easily be implemented on a per-project basis with some custom Less/Sass/CSS. https://getuikit.com/docs/visibility. This should all work now with the current release. We have also added a basic tutorial to the docs: https://getuikit.com/docs/webpack. The features to come are listed in https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/560\nRight now there is no plan to add more styles to the project itself. If you buy Pro, it will include a large number of additional UIkit styles in the Page builder. https://getuikit.com/pro. I think it depends on the use case. But if you want your clients to create content and not have them worry about adding classes, why not let them write in markdown (or HTML) and have the classes added automatically?\nThat is how we do it ourselves with the UIkit docs. The docs are written in Markdown, and all standard classes are added during rendering. We use the marked.js Markdown renderer for that, and have exchanged some of the default rendering functions: https://github.com/uikit/uikit-site/blob/develop/docs/app/util.js#L9\nIf you do not like it in JS, this can be done on the server side as well. In the Pagekit docs, for example, pretty much the same thing happens in PHP.. Thanks, search is a good idea. Has already been suggested by #2240. 1. UIkit 3 was developed and tested with jQuery 3.1.1. You are right, we should add that in the docs.\n2. Yes, loading at the bottom of the page works. True, we could also update the examples. Good idea.\n3. The \"old\" docs for UIkit 2 included sample layouts that showed how to use the container, etc. https://getuikit.com/v2/docs/documentation_layouts.html We haven't come around to creating new ones for the UIkit 3 docs, but I hope we will be able to some soon. In the meantime, maybe check the the past few yootheme releases and check out some of the page sources. It's pretty much all built with UIkit 3 markup, plus some theme specifics on top. https://demo.yootheme.com/. I am not sure I understand your question exactly, but if you are using the Accordion, you can set items to be opened initially: https://getuikit.com/docs/accordion#set-open-items. It is currently in development. When it is really finished, the doc will be added ;). It seems this has been resolved? I was trying to confirm this on https://getuikit.com/assets/uikit/tests/scrollspy.html but it works for me (latest Chrome on MacOS, trying at 150% zoom). Can you just upload to YouTube or similar and post the link here? Thanks.. Is this still an issue? Please provide an example of what exactly is happening.. Thanks zzseba78, this is correct.. Thanks, the team appreciates it. :). You can still make the auztocomplete package work for UIkit 2 markup. I explained it in that ticket: https://github.com/uikit/uikit-sublime/issues/15. The height depends on the content. If you want to match the height, you can use the available utility: https://getuikit.com/docs/utility#match-height\nFor example, wrap your cards in a Grid and match the height of all your card's body elements:\nhtml\n<div uk-grid uk-height-match=\"target: .uk-card-body\">\n     <div class=\"uk-card\">...</div>\n     <div class=\"uk-card\">...</div>\n</div>\nSimple Codepen example: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/Zebpoa. Thanks, search is a good idea. Has already been suggested by #2240. Duplicate. Closing.... Hm, this is curious. However, I think this is not related to UIkit, it seems to be a general behavior. Look at this isolated example. It also happens when I use Chrome in fullscreen there: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/evpdWG\nThis appears to be a known, but unfixed Chrome bug. https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=170058\nI don't think there's anything we can do about it.\n. Okay. Do you have more ideas what this could be related to, then?\nThe hover style contains nothing fancy: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/develop/src/less/components/table.less#L155\n\nThat codepen is not working in the slightest.\n\nWhat do you mean? In my case, I observe issues when in Chrome fullscreen, but not with other browsers.\n\nBut to confirm, did you see my comment about how the issue does not exist if the browser window is at full screen from the beginning? \n\nYes. I am guessing that this could be related to a window resize event that the UIkit JS might trigger and that might change the behavior, when the browser is already in fullscreen.\nI still think it is because of the documented Chrome bug. \nCould you elaborate why you do not think it is related to that bug?\nThanks!\n. Great! I have added it to https://github.com/uikit/awesome-uikit that we just started this week.. As Jan said, this should now work. Can you confirm this?\nFor the basic Webpack setup (not including the fonts import, though), we have added a section to the docs. https://getuikit.com/docs/webpack. Yes, they will be added. See https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/2379#issuecomment-278691968. I think he means the cache of your Browser. Please make sure the browser loads the newest version of the JavaScript, thanks.. Hm, I found a source confirming that self-closing tags cause troubles with IE8. However, IE8 is not officially supported by UIkit, so I am not sure if this is a valid reason. \nAny source for newer versions of IE?. Hm, this looks like a non-issue to me, or at least not a UIkit issue.\nHere's what I think is happening: The Babel compiler produces that output. The resulting line is actually a variable declaration after a return statement. According to the JS standard, hoisting means that the declaration is equivalent at the bottom than if it would be at the top. Or in other words: It is valid JS.\nLooks like the people who build the closure compiler are a little divided about that topic: https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/2240\nEither way, I think this is part of the toolchain and nothing we can or need to change.. Could you copy the markup to Codepen to show the issue? Thanks.. If you can reproduce this error on a Codepen, please post the link to the Codepen.\nIf it does not happen in the Codepen, it is most likely not a UIkit issue.\nI am afraid I cannot understand the problem from screenshots alone.. All icons have been moved to the JavaScript icon library which need to be injected into the DOM dynamically. In total, there are 3 kinds of icons. 2 of these are compiled into JS files.\n\nThis is true for icons form the \"Icon\" component which are located in /src/images/icons.  These are compiled into uikit-icons.js. \nAdditionally, some components use icons as well. These are located in /src/images/components and are compiled into the default uikit.js.\nSome SVGs are just used as background images. These are located in /src/images/background and are not compiled into the JavaScript. . Yes you should be able to just use an iframe with 100% width.. Here is the basic idea:\n\nAdd a class from the visibility component to only show the right column on larger screens, e.g. class=\"uk-visible@m\".\nMake sure the other two columns expand to 50% width in that case. Use classes from the width component to accomplish that. For example: class=\"uk-width-1-2 uk-width-1-3@m\" for 50% width on small screens and 33% width on larger screens.. If you can create a Codepen with your Markup, maybe someone can take the time to look into this and add the appropriate classes for your specific usecase. However, as this is not a UIkit issue, I  am leaving this closed. \nFor further usage advice, please refer to the G+ community: https://plus.google.com/communities/114238665434626719878 or join the Gitter chat https://gitter.im/uikit/uikit. > Perhaps you need to add this information to the webpack/some part of the documentation\nDone.. Thanks for the suggestion, but this is not something we are considering, please refer to third party scripts such as linked above.. Please fill out the issue template properly and provide more information of what exactly your problem is.. Thanks, I've fixed it in the docs repository. https://github.com/uikit/uikit-site/commit/0a38094e90342f573bf5cef9d7f2bfc91f79cdaa. Correct. We also like to collect such resources here: https://github.com/uikit/awesome-uikit\nMaybe someone would like to create a PSD for UIkit 3 and add it to the resources list?. You mean as the header of the CSS files? I think that's a good idea, we can consider that.\nNote that you can already get the current version on a JS level. It's in the UIkit.version object. See screenshot. \n\n. It seems to work in the official component test: https://getuikit.com/assets/uikit/tests/tooltip.html\nPlease provide more detail and a Codepen example with your issue, thanks.. Also works fine for me (UIkit beta 22, Chrome 58).\nIs this still an issue for you, Miljan?. I cannot reproduce this on beta-28. I used your markup example and the CSS compiled from SASS.\nHowever, I used static markup and not React. Might this be related to React evaluating the JS after the icons have been replaced? Does it work if you use static HTML?\nAlso, make sure to properly inluce uikit.js and uikit-icons.js. You are right, we should work on the docs in that direction. To get you started, here is a brief answer anyway.\n\nYou could grab it there, but I'd rather see a helper like this: (...) So unless the provided example UIkit.offcanvas('#offcanvas').toggle(); works as the code above\n\nIt does! Just call the component constructor on that DOM element, without providing the options argument. For example for the off-canvas:\nvar component = UIkit.offcanvas('#offcanvas-toggle');\ncomponent.toggle();\nThat is actually exactly what happens in the offcanvas test example when you click on the \"via code\" button: https://getuikit.com/assets/uikit/tests/offcanvas.html \nFor the remaining requests, we will try to provide more extensive docs.\n. The first version looks fine to me. I'm not sure why it wouldn't work. Can you double-check if the paths are correct?\nIt's very close to how this simple example is set up: https://github.com/florianletsch/uikit-webpack Does that one work for you?. Good catch. Here is why it happens: The website shows the changelog from the master branch. The one you linked is on the develop branch. When we merge back to master, it will be deployed automatically and it will be fixed on the website.\nI think we forgot to include to list the countdown component when we last made a release (it was still included in the release, just not listed in the changelog).. I have finally found and fixed the link you mentioned. https://github.com/uikit/uikit-site/commit/c0554f9c4ed72658e36f19c29b2f9409310aabad . Yes, jQuery is required. Thanks, I will add it to the installation doc.. The reasoning behind using bolder instead of bold is that the browser's default styles for the <b> and <strong> elements also use font-weight: bolder (at least in Firefox: https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/layout/style/res/html.css#l511 )\nI understand this might be a bit confusing because the uikit class is explicitely called -bold... maybe it should have been called uk-text-strong from the start?\nCan you elaborate if you have run into any troubles with this or if this is just a consistency thing?. So would this be a feature request to add -100, -200, ... as utility class?\nPersonally, I would advise anyone who needs such specific utilities to add them in their project, as the code is pretty straight forward and it would allow the uikit core to stay a littler smaller.\nAdding utility classes for bolder, lighter etc on the other hand, is worth a discussion, I think.. The migration script is available here: https://github.com/uikit/uikit-migration\nI think... that it should be enough to just search and replace \"uk-\" with your prefix in all files and then run the build script? :thinking: \nWould that do for you? \nMaybe @philoest knows more. I guess we could also extend the migrate script with a custom prefix option, but I'm not sure where the priority for that would lie at the moment. Maybe if there is sufficient demand?. I think we will recommend that workaround for now, unless someone would like to contribute a custom-prefix option to the migration script. If so, please contribute there: https://github.com/uikit/uikit-migration. Check out the sass docs and set up a sass file where you import the uikit scss files: https://getuikit.com/docs/sass#how-to-build\nChange the example hook and add for example the table hook:\n// 3. Your custom mixin overwrites.\n@mixin hook-table() { border: 5px solid lime; }\nWhen you compile this file, your styles should then be included. Also, as you only import the uikit scss files and do not change them, these can be updated without problems (for example with npm, bower or manually by replacing the files for a new version)\n. I think you are right, sorry for closing early. Will need to look into this next week.. Thanks, however I think this is already fixed now. The scss is automatically generated from the Less files just before every release, that is why it wasn't part of my original commit.. The offcanvas markup has changed in one of the last few beta releases. You will now need to add a class=\"uk-offcanvas-content\" container around the markup. Is it possible that you just need to update your markup to fix this issue? https://getuikit.com/docs/offcanvas. I think the solution is not add the uk-overflow-auto attribute on a container inside the modal, not on the modal itself. At least that's the way it is shown in the documentation: https://getuikit.com/docs/modal#overflow\nAnd that way, it also appears to work when the close button is displayed outside: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/QvQMVy. You're right. I think I'd see this as an error in the docs. \nAfter all, adding the overflow to the modal itself would cause any control elements inside to scroll out of the container as well (I mean things like Save and Cancel buttons).... and I don't think this would be desired. \nI will change this in the docs. \nI think you can fix your issue by just setting the overflow attribute on a container inside the modal, right?. It appears that calc() fails when used on a <td> element or something like that.\nLooks like a Firefox bug to me? Haven't found anything specific about this one yet. Any ideas?. Yes, currently running some maintenance. Will be back soon. If you need to access the docs in the meantime, maybe browse the markdown directly: https://github.com/uikit/uikit-site/tree/develop/docs/pages. I agree this was a great feature. I've put on our list to discuss.. You're right, I'll add it to the doc.. I've added the instructions. Will go online when we next deploy the website. Thanks for pointing this out.. Hm, so far \"UC Browser\" has not been tested for UIkit. Check the browser compatibility chart: https://github.com/uikit/uikit#browser-support\nAre you familiar with the browser? What rendering engine does it use anyway? I could not find conclusive details when I had a quick look at it.. You are right, UC Browser has a considerable market share, I honestly wasn't aware of that. \nThanks, we'll look into this.. Thanks, however I think this is already fixed now. See my comment at https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/2646#issuecomment-304645510. You're right. I think we'll need to update the docs for this.\nI will also put it on our list to discuss if the event should be triggered on both containers.. They have added in the meantime and 2.27.3 is available now (along with 2.27.4). \nAlso, this is kind of a duplicate of #2678, since we are currently discussing the auto-update functionality with them. \nClosing this one now, thanks for reporting.. Hey @PeterDaveHello. Would it be possible to use the npm package for updating instead? That one always includes the dist folder, both for UIkit 2.x and 3.x releases.\nFor example you can review this locally:\nnpm install --save uikit@3.0.0-beta.24 # UIkit 3\nnpm install --save uikit@2.27.4 # UIkit 2\n. Awesome. Thanks @PeterDaveHello for your work with cdnjs :). Thanks aaron for explaining, I also think it was just run from the wrong directory. For further details on how to build, please refer to https://getuikit.com/docs/installation and https://getuikit.com/docs/less. True, the 2.27.4 release is not published on npm yet, we'll fix that. . 2.27.4 is published on npm now, thanks for letting us now.. It won't be enough to compile uikit.scss directly. You need to create an additional scss file with several imports. Then, compile that file instead. Please refer to the documentation, it explains the required steps https://getuikit.com/docs/sass. Thanks. Fixed it, will go up with the next deploy. https://github.com/uikit/uikit-site/commit/c0554f9c4ed72658e36f19c29b2f9409310aabad. I think you should be able to achieve this by using multiple Tab elements and aligning these with Flex.\nSomething like this? https://codepen.io/anon/pen/mwMMjK. Happened to me as well, when I clicked in the right rhythm.\nThis... is... weird.. Looks like it. Can't reproduce it anymore: https://jsfiddle.net/mq0ovszo/2/. I assume your question applies to UIkit 2, as the webfont is not present in UIkit 3 anymore. \nYou can use the Less variable @icon-font-path to point to the directory with the font files.\nHere it is in the core files: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/v2/develop/src/less/core/icon.less#L25\nJust overwrite its value in you own Less and then compile.. Excatly, look at Transition: https://getuikit.com/docs/transition. This is a good idea! I have put it on the team list to discuss. \nSince this has already been suggested in #2583, I will close this issue as a duplicate.. This is a custom styling thing, I would not put this in UIkit core. But you can simply achieve this yourself:\nIf you use the Less sources, you just need to set @label-text-transform: none to disable the uppercase for labels. For Badges, the default behavior looks like it doesn't show uppercase anyway: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/YQGpVr. Please phrase your support issue in English in the future, thanks.\nGoogle Translate helped me guess what your issue is. Please note that getuikit.net is not an official website and not hosted by us. As @lupuxyz has correctly pointed out, you can find the Customizer for UIkit 2 on the official .com website.. Hm, I cannot seem to reproduce this...\nI tried https://getuikit.com/docs/accordion on macOS and it worked in Chrome, Firefox and Safari.\nWhich OS are you using? Can you try again with any browser plugins disabled that could interfere?\nDoes anyone else experience this?. I copied your example and inserted a badge. Looks alright to me: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/NgEbOW\nWhat am I missing?. EDIT: Nevermind my post, I was going through pagekit and UIkit issues at the same time and thought this one was related to Pagekit. My bad. :neutral_face:\nThat being said, the channel that is closest to a forum is probably the G+ community which currently has 2000+ members. https://plus.google.com/communities/114238665434626719878\n\nIf you are into traditional discussion boards, there is https://pagekit-forum.org/forum/ (it's a mix of German and English). I think that one is the one we should promote more, so that it gets more attention. It is run by @SPQRInc, so it's a community forum.\nBesides, we actually do have quite a few channels. Maybe too many different ones? I suggest to keep Gitter as the main dev channel and not move this to Slack, as Gitter is the most active one!\nSome more that come to mind:\nThere is a subreddit, though it's not active: https://www.reddit.com/r/pagekit/\nI still check the Google+ community, so that could be a channel to use as well. https://plus.google.com/communities/104125443335488004107\nSome people also ask questions on stackoverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pagekit. Can you provide a link to the website where this is happening? We already test on quite a complex grid example (https://getuikit.com/assets/uikit/tests/grid.html), but there might always be edge cases which could cause wrong behaviour.. Thanks!. The HTML editor is just an alternative view on a <textarea> element, so you can use it as a regular form element in your web app. \nFor example, you can use jQuery to read the content of the textarea and send it somewhere to be stored.\nvar content = jQuery('[data-uk-htmleditor]').val();\nAlternatively, you can submit the form with a regular post request and validate and store the html on the backend, using PHP or the language of your preference.. I guess we will have to check which additional replacements we need to do when converting Less -> SASS. \nFor \"fade\", it looks like it is safe to replace with \"opacify\" from SASS, as they look semantically equivalent (have to replace 70% with 0.7, though): http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html#opacify-instance_method\nHave you noticed more functions missing?\n\nUPDATE: I wasn't quite right, the correct function woulf be \"transparentize\" or \"fade-out\". However, the \"amount\" value seems to be interpreted differently compared to the Less \"fade()\" function, so this will need some more looking into.... Fixed it, will be included in the next release. If you need it right now, clone the the v2/develop branch, run npm install && gulp and you will find the converted sass files in dist/scss. I am not sure I understand you correctly. \nI am assuming that you want your links to lead to a page with your sort criteria attached, so something like https://example.com/list?sortBy=date, where the ?sortBy=date is changed when a user clicks on a link. Is that correct?\nThe problem with this is that the uk-toggle and uk-switcher components will prevent the default action of the link, so your URL will not change. This is on purpose! That way, the browser does not navigate to a different site, but instead displays a different item on your page - which is exactly what the switcher an toggle are designed to do.\nIf you want to link to a different page and have your backend render the frontend differently depending on the ?sortBy=date arguments, I suggest you do not use the switcher and toggle at all, but instead render plain UIkit components without using these JS functionalities.\nDoes this help you?. Note that there is a differerence between \"component options\" and \"JavaScript options\", as well call them. The first ones can be used in the attributes directly (<div uk-modal=\"center: true\">) while the latter are passed when initializing the component from JavaScript (UIkit.modal(element, { escClose: true });).\nYou are right that the Modal doc currently only includes the component options, not the JavaScript options. We are currently reworking that doc anyway, as the next UIkit release included some changes for the Modal component. I will make sure that we also add the JS options.. Added https://github.com/uikit/uikit-site/commit/b9d3c23913ab317e24a5fb94bef9f8b6408a5bfe. Yes, but I think it is included. What am I missing here?\n\n. Ah, you mean the example! Yes, you're right. We will consider adding it, thanks.. Looks like an issue with conflicting CSS to me. What CSS do the other parts of your project include? Can you provide a live link please?. I can see how this could be useful in some cases.\nHowever, such niche styling requests are always hard to balance if we don't want to bloat the codebase too much. You already mentioned that yourself. ;)\nDo you have a very specific example of where this could be useful? Otherwise I would personally suggest to put such code in your project-specific code instead of into UIkit core.. I hear you. I am personally also not a huge fan of the low contrast that is considered \"en vogue\" in webdesign at the moment.\nThat being said, the contrast of #666on white is still considered adequate according to the W3C accessibility guidelines.\nI think the color on the website will stay that way for now. As the others have mentioned, there are ways to increase contrast for yourself using your browser tools and to use higher contrast when using UIkit for your own projects.\nThanks for your feedback, as accessibility is a central topic we should all care about and probably think about more often.. This is a good idea. I have added it to our list of ideas to discuss internally.. I see your point and I agree this would be useful in some projects. \nPersonally, I would prefer to just keep a general notion of \"progress\" and not add the modifier classes. It is the always the same discussion of how we should balance \"essential features\" with \"bloat\" of the UIkit CSS.\nHowever, this is just my personal opinion. I will add this feature request to our internal list to discuss with the team.. Is the footer the last element on the page? Sticky will disappear when you scroll past that element. If it is the last element, you won't be able to scroll past it and it won't disappear. Compare the example at: https://getuikit.com/docs/sticky#bottom\nIf I misunderstood you, please provide a live example.. Please provide an example. Agree with @zzseba78 here. The navigation paradigm that UIkit promotes is to use a Navbar on large viewports and hide it on smaller ones (exactly like you see on https://getuikit.com). For mobile navigations, you can then use offcanvas or display it in a full modal.\nFor ideas what to do you can also see the different options that we use in the Pro themes: https://demo.yootheme.com/joomla (go through the recent themes and try out, it's all built with UIkit and some theme specific styles on top).\nIf you want a different navigation behaviour, you are of course free to add your own styles, but I think the navbar will stay the way it is for now.. I think this is a good idea. Feel free to send a PR.. Can you provide an example of this, or at least the code you are using? UIkit 3 currently does not have a datepicker, so I am not sure what exactly you are referring to.\nI have tried to align the icon just using the form component, and it works for me: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/rwXxNN. Hm, but maybe this will already work if you combine video and scrollspy (\"already\" meaning with the next release).\nSo, something like this, I suppose?\n<video src=\"\" uk-video=\"automute: true\" uk-scrollspy=\"hidden: true\"></video>. The datepicker is currently only available in UIkit 2 (https://getuikit.com/v2/docs/datepicker.html), but it has not been ported to UIkit 3 yet.. It's great to read this discussion and see that many people seem quit content with how we've structured the docs. Cheers for that, we've put quite a lot of effort into them. :)\nYes!\nI agree with all of your points: Yes, many \"new\" users might think of \"tabs\" and want to use them with content immediately. More extensive examples are always great to get people started. That is why in UIkit 3 docs we have These \"Example\" boxes where you can toggle the complete markup of an example and even view it on Codepen (in UIkit 2, the examples were simplified markup to only show the general structure of a component - they were not copy-paste ready). \nAnd here's why:\nAt the same time, UIkit is very modular and our first priority when writing the docs was to show in a technical way what every component is capable of. Wherever useful, we have added pointers to related components (for example from Tab to Switcher) and the Test of a component usually contains many examples of a component in connection with other components.\nSo, I suggest:\nInstead of expanding the current examples, I would rather like to include more \"Getting Started\" information for new users. This would include complete layout examples (like we had in UIkit 2) and some more tutorial style docs (like the screencasts I produced back in the day). Then again, time is limited, so we'll see how soon this can be tackled.\nWe will take your feedback into account for further improvement. Also, we are currently re-working the YOOtheme Pro documentation, and we will take all of these ideas into account as well. Working on the Pagekit docs, UIkit 2 and 3 docs and YOOtheme Pro docs has slowly improved the way we write, structure and visualize documentation, I'd dare to say. ;) It's an iterative process, so your feedback is always highly appreciated.\n. Line break in markup is lost during JS compilation which causes this bug. We'll fix this.. In the default theme the button has the same font size for both button sizes, yes. This improves readability of smaller elements and is correct. If you prefer a different font size, you can change this variable in your own theme.. Please check your browser console for errors. Is it possible that you try to embed a site which does not allow it? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27358966/how-to-set-x-frame-options-on-iframe. A datepicker has already been requested and it's on the list to be added, however we don't have a fixed timeline for that feature yet. https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/2740. Your example is a full calendar application. I don't think something like that will be introduced. Remember that UIkit is a collection of UI elements and components to create your own applications. A full fledged calendar application is a little out of scope I think. \nWith the future datepicker and the other components that already exist however, you should be able to build your own calendar application that goes in that direction.. You can try to create a custom build script to filter out thee classes, but we won't support this officially.. This feels like a Windows related issue to me (which I can't support personally).\nMaybe someone else can?\nMaybe just try adding the right path to your PATH variable? A quick google search turned up several of these suggestions: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31398380/fatal-error-spawn-cmd-enoent-grunt-serve. Make sure you download the source code of one of the v2 branches (e.g. v2/master).

This is broken again.\n. So, I figured it out (I'm a dummy), only use uk-active on the element, not uk-open and uk-active or just uk-open only uk-active triggers the event.\n. I can't seem to pinpoint it. I looked for any new browser styles, couldn't find any. I'm just gonna leave it.

    "Torcado": "In addition to this, the centered navbar content won't center correctly if you scroll down the page and after(!) that resize the window. It only works if the page is at its top.\n. It seems like this has already been fixed in WIP.\n. That's a normal* behaviour. Your un-choppy example only works on iOS, because there you have support for \"position:sticky\" (that's also the reason why it does not work on most of the desktop browsers).\n*normal meaning that mobile browsers do not update the content while being \"touched & scrolled\". Choppiness only occurs because as soon as you lift your finger, the mobile browser does its \"re-ordering\".\n. @schinckel Gave your workaround a shot and noticed a few side effects:\n1. offcanvas-page is still scrollable (will jump back to initial position after closing offcanvas-bar).\n2. Browser on Android 2.37 will rescale the whole page (page + bar). Chrome does not have this issue.\n. Well \u2026 there's no hover event on touch screens, so overlays won't get triggered on such devices. https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/337\n. Correct, that's why I have linked to #337. Seems like https://github.com/santosmena is working on such a solution.\n. Take a look at \"responsive visibility\". http://getuikit.com/docs/utility.html\nThe class \"uk-hidden-small\" should solve your problem.\n. Did you include the corresponding js file? \"Search\" got moved to the add-on library in 2.5.0.\n. msg.close();\n. Quick info: This does also happen on OS X (Chrome), so I guess it's not Windows related.\n. You could achieve this by using the responsive visibility features.\n. I know \u2026\u00a0this is where all those responsive visibility features come in handy. You would have to create your content at least two times (sticky vs non-sticky). IMHO not the most elegant solution \u2026 but a great workaround as long as there is no other way of doing it.\n. You'll have to also bind it to a touch (e.g. touchstart) event.

    "ahallicks": "http://jsfiddle.net/aUb2A/1/ shows this working as expected. Though I would recommend putting uk-clearfix as a class on the parent div to avoid the floated element breaking out of the container, such as:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/aUb2A/2/\n. This is because .uk-grid>* is set to float: left; in uikit.css. This meant that putting a container as the direct descendant of a grid collapsed it's width. I had to add the following to my own CSS to fix the issue:\n.uk-grid > .uk-container { float: none; }\n. I didn't say the problem was only in IE8. It's happening in ALL versions of IE and when I upgraded to the latest build I still had the intermittent issue.\n. I've actually sorted (hah) the second part. Subscribing to the \"sortable-stop\" trigger worked great. However, it would be handy if the dragged element could be removed before this trigger is fired as, when I look through the elements after sorting them, the cloned element is also appearing!\nThanks\n. Previous experience of this bug says this is something to do with line-height:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/5208418/the-placeholder-text-in-my-text-boxes-is-mis-aligned-in-chrome\n. After doing some tests I've found a solution that works for me. Changing the following line:\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/develop/src/js/components/sortable.js#L388\noverElement = UI.$(document.elementFromPoint(e.pageX - document.body.scrollLeft, e.pageY - document.body.scrollTop));\nto\noverElement = UI.$(document.elementFromPoint(e.clientX, e.clientY));\nworks in my tests.\n. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19635188/why-is-body-scrolltop-deprecated\nAfter some more testing it seems something is triggering strict mode for me, which detects document.body.scrollTop as deprecated. document.documentElement.scrollTop works just fine though\n. It looks like you don't have the form select component styles:\nhttp://getuikit.com/docs/form-select.html\nThe second paragraph here explains about it http://getuikit.com/docs/datepicker.html#usage\n. There is nothing built into uikit for this, as far as I know, but it's pretty custom and very simple to implement.\nHave a look at the source code. All Stu has done is wrap an inner table in a div, given it a height and added overflow: auto.\n. ",
    "miljan-aleksic": "Try var modal = new $.UIkit.modal.Modal(\"#modalCreateProject\").show(); instead and then close with modal.hide();.\nMake sure the hide action is deleyed or trigered by user or the modal will not even have time to be displayed.\n. :+1:\n. I may be wrong, but the components already depend on the base.less file. Adding there the color variables should not change they current independency.\nOk, let's call them base instead of global\n@base-color-success: #fff;\n@[some_addon]-color-success: @base-color-success;\nThe above example will produce the exact same result for the components while the colors are standarized and can be used to create the mentioned color classes.\n. This is a theme specific question, if you considere it an Uikit issue you should first reproduce it in a clean environment and send a link to it, with JSFiddle for example.\nAs about the issues: the .tm-fullscreen is on top of the form, blocking it, and the datepicker addon js is not loaded.\n. You are welcome!\n. thanks @davidchase for the explanation. If there is no easy solution to trigger the events when disabled, perhaps an a.uk-button could be emulated as disabled via uk-disabled. Just an idea.\n. BTW, the title would be processed as tooltip by the browser even if disabled.\n. Thanks Artur, but already thought about it. Unless the wrapper has some undisabled or unhidden content, it will not be triggered neither. Maybe I'm ignoring some workaround?\n. +1\n. Thanks Zach! We should not code in hurry...\n. I saw dropdown transitions were scoped all under .uk-open > and by not using uk-open at all one could set up custom transitions. At least it could become a standard and use the same approach for modal and any other.\n. Yep, Chrome 57. Are you trying out Overlay and scrolling down before opening? Will make a video if you can't reproduce.. Yes, still an issue in Chrome 58 and UIkit b22. I have recorded it, see how the offcanvas content jumps vertically when toggled.\n. No, although the used version is clearly the latest. Anyway, it's working\nfine on another Mac, must be the cache. Closing this ticket.. @saschadube, just a friendly reminder about this unsolved issue.. Closing this as it is solved in the develop branch. Thanks!. Ok, bad example provided. Sorry about that, please review this one - https://codepen.io/miljan/pen/opBOpY\nMake sure to resize your window so that the 3rd card falls in a second row. There, it should not get any match as row option is on by default, but it does.. Thanks, @aarongerig, I like that solution, with uk-grid-match the height-match is not even required.\nPerhaps there are some edge situations where matching the height would fit better. Reviewing this bug in some future refactoring would be nice.. @TomS-, ES6 code is compiled to ES5 on build, so there is nothing to worry about that or the missing commas ;). @janschoenherr, awesome!. Yes, that could be the reason but then there should exist a global variable used by both components.. I would also suggest to remove dist files from the repo and keep them only on npm.. ",

All I can guess from your request: it doesnt make any sense to put a dropdown menu in a tab item itself, if this is a challenge you want to archive, try to avoid the onclick tag if you are going to do this with js, instead of indepently jquery script which could be placed inline or extenal js file. Don't forget check if the uikit prevents default event if you want to use the default href by the a tag.\nput your code here would be very helpful to solve your problems.\n. are they not there?\n. Try to use an :before/:after with absolute position, put the icon's unicode as content.

You just can not to do that but rework on the source, just open a new branch and try it out.\n. @franziskaschulz , I watched your uikit presentation on youtube, very impressive, good work.\n. fixed now\n. data-uk-dropdown=\"{mode:'click',boundary:'#id'}\"\n. the same issue for all the modal, and WIP fix is not correctly solved this problem, still there.\nAs been told, this problem will be fixed in the next release, and its coming very soon!\n. this one is not working, and not all the trigger are a element.\nI even tried to preventDefault for all element but the page still goes to top.\n. actually Im using the complied uikit.js, the one downloaded from the uikit official homepage, cache has been cleared for sure.\n. ok, thx, thats a important info, when it will be released?\n.

I'm on a Mac at the moment, and haven't checked on Windows.\n.uk-container-center should be used with .uk-container.  The documentation says uk-container is used to wrap the main content of your website, and that's the only way I've ever used it. I don't think your images are being centered no matter what ratios you're using.  They just happen to be aligned properly in a sufficiently narrow div because the images are responsive and they shrink to fill the area. With larger divs, the images aren't large enough to fill.\nUse Firebug to remove div.uk-width-5-6 and then change div.uk-width-1-6 to div.uk-width-1-1 to make that sidebar take up the whole page.

Hey, unfortunately it's a little too complex to post to jsfiddle but here is the css.

Hi @RobertinoValue,\nthank you for your reply!\nI don't know what is uk-sticky, that you mentioned, but I guess you mean data-uk-sticky attribute. If this is the case, I exactly did the same, as you wrote. That block got the data-uk-sticky attribute.\nIt is not stopping at the bottom of the sidebar wrap, because uikit has no option for this. It has to change the class or inline style, so it can be changed from fixed position to absolute position. There is no other solution for this. If it stays fixed position, than it will go through every other blocks, sections, like footer.\nSo uikit sticky feature needs to be changed to have the option to stop at the bottom of a selected block.\n. Thank you for your reply and work, regarding the example conversion to uikit. Your converted code shows, that the uikit sticky addon can not be used in the sidebar. It is good for the navigation menu, but it is not good for widgets.\nThat's my problem and this is the reason I was started this issue. I really hope YOOtheme will recognize the need for this feature and they will add it to the addon.\nMeanwhile I must use other scripts, like the script in my second example, which is working nicely on one of my client's site.\n. @pniaps Thank you for your answer!

    "robertotremonti": "Yes, I know. Thanks.\nI'm only suggesting to add it into official code.\n. Any news on it?\nI guess it's a small and useful addition, ten lines of code in CSS.\n. Here it is.\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/9Y4LM/\nIt seems an incompatibility with responsive layout.\n. Did you even try my example?\nPlease see attached screen recording.\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/wy0a9dizzn6h7et/sticky.mov\n. Safari 7 and 8.\nThe ones that come with OS X Mavericks and Yosemite (beta).\nI see no problems with Chrome and Firefox.\nSorry for not specifying it.\n. Yes, but a tap event could be added.\n\nOn 11/mag/2014, at 16:20, Torcado notifications@github.com wrote:\nWell \u2026 there's no hover event on touch screens, so overlays won't get triggered on such devices. #337\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Thank you for the fix.\nI confirm overlay now works on touch devices, but it's quite unusable.\nYou can't interact with overlay content, i.e. buttons and links.\nOverlay should be a two-step operation, first step to activate (show) overlay, second step to interact with overlay content.\n. Here's a working example.\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/96efx/2/\n. Yes, but panels have round corners in almost-flat style.\n. Oh, ok.\nHere's a working example with overlay inside a panel.\n\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/96efx/2/\nAs you can see, panel has round corners while overlay hasn't.\n. Hi, zslabs.\nWhere is media option mentioned in documentation?\nI can't find it. It should be very useful in my project.\nThanks.\nhttp://www.getuikit.com/docs/addons_sticky.html\n. Thanks for your reply, zslabs.\nHow do you use it in beta?\nI don't understand from source code.\n[EDIT: found it in the commit. https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/fc51094c8b0b9dedf41ed93cd73b398b069d80cc]\n. Don't know what action parameter should do, but file upload is handled on server side.\nFor obvious security reasons a client can't set upload folder.\nYou need to write your own function.\nIn a PHP environment, for example, once the file is uploaded, you access and move uploaded file with move_uploaded_file() function.\nhttp://php.net/manual/en/function.move-uploaded-file.php\n. Anyone knows what action parameter should do?\n. @aheinze, thank you.\n. http://jsfiddle.net/robtrem/tnz3n637/\nZ-index with Select seems correct now.\nProblem still happens with date picker.\n. Thanks for your reply, Evanion.\nThis happens in both Safari and Chrome on iOS.\nI know I can force border radius to 0 but it should be fixed in official code.\n. Yes, already done.\nThe problem is related to how webkit on iOS renders input elements.\nYou need to use\n-webkit-appearance: none;\n-webkit-border-radius: 0px;\n. @muffinjello Do not wrap the area you want to center with the... what?\nYour message is cut.\n. Thank you, @muffinjello.\nI'll give it a try.\n. +1 on this\n. Release standalone versions of your YOOtheme UIkit styles.\n. @Intiligent As UIkit includes regular Font Awesome icons set, you can use FA search functionality.\nhttp://fontawesome.io/icons/\n. Also a div inside a anchor is not semantically valid.\nSee Navbar Subtitle\nhttp://getuikit.com/docs/navbar.html\n. And please uniform colors.\nText danger red color is not the same as badge danger red.\nUsing them in the same layout is an eyesore.\n. Congratulation for this update!\nI was confident that you would add a more coherent primary/secondary/success/warning/danger style for all colorable elements in this new release, but you even got rid of success button.\nWhy this choice?\nBadge element is blue only while label element has all colors.\nButton element is missing warning and success colors.\n. What do you mean?\nThe callback function must return a simple array containing matching words.\n. After several test, I can say that forms inside a modal window are unusable on touch devices.\nDate and time pickers are not shown, modal window is not scrollable.\n. JSFiddle doesn't work correctly on touch devices.\n. Ok, but while in datepicker if you enter some garbage (like \"kjbkjjkjbkj\") it has been replaced with today date, in number field it's not replaced with anything (min value I suggest).\n. Ok, thanks.\nI thought there was a component.\n. http://jsfiddle.net/robtrem/9pLw6an8/\nIt seems Time Picker doesn't work in JSFiddle.\nTake a look at console.\nAnyway, in my tests, once you choose a time, icon is removed from input field.\nThis doesn't happen with Datepicker addon.\n. Well, the problem is in documentation.\nhttp://getuikit.com/docs/addons_timepicker.html\nIn your example, you use \"data-uk-timepicker\" attribute in \"uk-form-icon\" div container, while when using without an icon, you must add it to input element.\nThat's not explained.\nIn datepicker addon, attribute is always added to input element, even when using an icon.\nIf added to div container, addon doesn't work.\nYou should fix this.\n. +1 on this\n. Just found that you can add round borders with \"uk-border-rounded\" class.\nSo old \"uk-modal-dialog-frameless\" is actually replaced with \"uk-modal-dialog-lightbox uk-border-rounded\".\n. +1 on this\n. Please move font awesome functionality from core to a separated additional component so one can choose to use uikit version or original one without duplicated resources.\n. Please move font awesome functionality from core to a separated additional component so one can choose to use uikit version or original one without duplicated resources.\n. @zslabs What's the problem in using icon fonts? Aren't they rendered properly?\n. @zslabs Thanks for the clarification.\n. That was fast!\nThank you.\n. Nevermind. Just found uk-align-medium-left in the documentation.\n. I'm talking about backgrounds and borders, sorry.\nText color is not enough.\n. Oh, thank you.\n. For not working well I mean that Gitter notifications are not reliable, new messages are often not highlitghted, when app is hidden it seems to go \"offline\" (no refresh, no notifications), it frequently reloads, no direct messages and powerful search.\n. @saschadube Honestly I don't know.\n@zslabs Ok.\n. @PixelT Ok, but the result is ugly :smile:\n. The problem seems related to a failed HREF assignment in downloadCSS JS function.\n. Yes, even with position: relative.\nTooltip element is not child of the element that generates it, it's appended directly to body element.\n. Still experiencing this issue in latest 2.22.0.\nThe problem seems related to Firefox only.\nIt works correctly in Chrome and Safari.\ntarget option make the element appear but without animation on Firefox.\n. Don't know if it's your case, but I was using a modded minified CSS that added quotes to animation effects.\nThis prevented Firefox to apply effects.\nRemoving the quotes fixed the problem.\nFirefox was acting correctly.\nIt's Chrome and Safari that apply effects even when they are quoted in CSS.\nHere's the bug report.\nhttps://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=423424\nAnd here's a test for all browsers.\nhttp://codepen.io/rupl/pen/nIbEa?editors=110\n. That's a great addition.\nI'd like to see it added to main branch.\n. Just realized that you can move image tag outside overlay and lightbox components without compromising layout.\nThis way it works.\nPlease consider this issue closed.\nThanks.\n. @miladmeidanshahi Your code works for a single click on each button. Once you click a button, event is removed.\nSo no, that's not a solution.\nAnyway the problem is within UIkit not jQuery code. If you remove data-uk-button-radio attribute, the code works correctly.\n. Autocomplete++\nProgress colors++\nMore colors++ (it's a shame there's no green button). Thank you, @danny-englander.\nI couldn't find any mentions on autocomplete, but I guess it's already included in the to-do list.. ",

Hi Giacomo,\nI had a look into this problem, we are sorry that this took so long!\nI tried it firstly with the Moreno template and added the flip modifier to the offcanvas bar and set the navbar to sticky. \nBut neither in the online emulator or on a real device I saw the problem you described. In my case the sticky navbar didn't get shifted to the left at all and the offcanvas bar was just displayed above the sticky navbar. So that when the offcanvas closed the sticky navbar did not have to move back. \nThe same result happend by using the eat template. \nDid you have other customizations, so that we can rebuild the problem to find a proper solution?!\nI saw that you said in your forum posts that you are using the following system setup:\nIPhone & with IOs 9 as the customer \nJoomla 3.44\nWarp 7 ( newest? )\nPHP 5.4.41\nAre these informations still correct?\nYou mentioned that you are using the plugins from vmuikit, which normally doesn't cause any problem with our widgets, but did you tried to deactivate them and see if the problem lasts?\nThe solution you provided seems to work fine, but in our case it seems not to be the correct way since we want to have the effect of the offcanvas sliding in from the left/right with the page still visible.\nI will talk with the designer about the other 3 issues you pointed out and hope this will be fixed soon :)\nHope we will find a solution for this soon! \nKind Regards\nPhilipp\n.

Had a talk about this with @saschadube and we don't see this within UIkit, none the less Select2 should work perfectly as an addition to UIkit.. The Datepicker component will be completely reworked for UIkit3, we are trying to add this feature, but the biggest problem coming with this functionality is the responsiveness, how this works on smaller screens and in smaller areas. We will see if we will find a solution for this that satisfying. . We have released the next major version, UIkit3.

We are sorry but this is currently not planed. . These will come step by step, we can't give you a timetable for all the components but we want to keep adding them with constant releases :). In most the cases 1-8 or even 1-10 are pretty small on screens that was the reason we haven't added them. If you are using 10 items in a row you also can use the uk-width-expand classes, since this will set all the items to the same size. If you want to have one small item and a large one you could also consider to use one of the fixed width classes in addition to uk-width-expand. \nIf all of this doesn't work for you, you have to copy that from UIkit2 as @svjansen already mentioned . Since we have released the next major version, UIkit3. To start focusing our work on the most recent release, we decided to close all the issues related to UIkit2. \nRegarding your question, have you tried to initialize the slideshow or slideset again after you added the new item via javascript? I think with reinitializing it, the items should be added correctly. \nThanks for your understanding,\nYour UIkit Team. Within your HTML code, the class should be named uk-visible@s the \\@ is only needed within the css files. \nTo see how this works take a look into the width docs example code.. For this case we have the class uk-preserve-color https://getuikit.com/docs/section#preserve-color. The Sortable component within UIkit2 has a serialize function which can be used for this, within UIkit3 this is not added, so here you would need some custom JS to track the order of the items.\n. We have released the next major version, UIkit3. To start focusing our work on the most recent release, we decided to close all the issues related to UIkit2. The switcher component has not been released yet but we are working on that, please let us know if the problem when it is released for UIkit3.\nThanks for your understanding,\nYour UIkit Team. Thanks for reporting I can confirm this within Firefox, we are working on this. \nPlease don't use Safari v. 5.1.7 for Windows any longer the official support ended in 2013, so a lot will not work in there..  Has been fixed: f9af435. Thanks for reporting has been fixed in ca92c85. We thought about this while developing the visibility component but we couldn't find a case where it would be helpful to show an element only on medium screens. Because of that we decided to not add such a class. \nIf you need this you would need to create this with custom CSS. This can be done with the following command:\nnpm run prefix -- -p myprefix\nNote that this will give also the UIkit Javascript the prefix.. this is done with some theme customization which can be seen in the uikit-site repository ( https://github.com/uikit/uikit-site ) the theme.less stored within the less folder is also added to the theme.css additionally to the UIkit less files.\n. Do you have a codepen example where we can take a look at?. What do you mean by it does support <input type=\"file\" multiple><button class=\"uk-button uk-button-default\" type=\"button\" tabindex=\"-1\"></button>??\nI tested this in chrome firefox and opera and here selecting multiple files and upload worked as expected.. Within UIkit3 there is no alsmost-flat theme. You would need to use the default theme.. If you are using the src you also can create your own icon within the src/images/symbols folder (this has to be an svg file). And then run the command npm run images. After that you can use your own icon the same as the default icons. Note that the file name will be the icon name.\nThis will be changed in the future so that it will be easier to add custom icons and also that this will not be removed after an update, because I think this would happen now. \nAnd of course as @BobbyBabes already mentioned you can still use Font Awesome. . Via CSS you can do it that way:\n.uk-progress::-webkit-progress-value{\n  background-color: red;\n}\n.uk-progress::-moz-progress-bar {\n  background-color: red;\n}\nThere is also a LESS variable for this if you downloaded the code, which can be found in the progress component.\n. Which params do you add via the before function? Doesn't it work when you create the upload component via JS UIkit.upload(element, options)? . Oh, that is correct currently this is not possible the same as in UIkit2, we will add this back in a future update. \nCurrently you would have to do it via the beforeAll function, but here you have to watch out since this changes the original settings of the upload. So when changing back to default you would have to reset the settings again with the beforeAll function. \nAnother not so nice option currently would be initiate the upload component again, as soon as the settings have been changed. \n. Thanks for reporting, will be fixed with the next doc update :). Do you have an example page or a codepen where this problem is visible?\n. I tried to rebuild this on codepen (https://codepen.io/philoest/pen/zNRByd) but here it seems to work as expected, do you have an example where this happens?. Thanks for reporting changed this https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/43ea0270bd71544acd9bc897bacc4548478c3493. Have you tried changing the @offcanvas-bar-color-mode variable to dark within the less file:\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/develop/src/less/components/offcanvas.less#L32\nThis should do the work :)\n\nEdit: \njust saw your pull request regarding this, so wanted to edit that this is a fifty fifty consumption and from our point of view most of the offcanvas' have a dark background so that the default font color should be light. Since this is only one line of change I think this can be changed pretty quickly if you have a light offcanvas background. But I think you are right that the docs should use the same or at least mention that the other color mode is used.. Fixed within the next version https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/5092ca099b36172f062d823daff46897e15960c9. Thanks for reporting we are taking a look into this please follow duplicated issue in #2323. Best practice would be a surrounding <div class=\"uk-width-1-1\"> for the container. You might also want to consider using a section for your parent div. \nhttp://codepen.io/philoest/pen/OWQXbr/. I am not sure what you mean, but the message is only a Notice which means that you have to decide if you need to take a look at this. In this case you need to take a look if you need the uk-navbar-toggle attribute since the way this is created has changed from UIkit2. No this warning is targeting the uk-navbar-toggle-icon when it is used within the navbar. You would need the burger menu to open the offcanvas menu. But this is independet from the uk-close icon :)\nhttps://getuikit.com/docs/navbar#toggle-item. If everything is working and the notice still shows up, everything is fine, we are using CSS selectors to check if a warning / notice needs to be shown. There are selectors which will also print out the notice on a warning page\n\nNotices highlight potential issues that might not break your site. Some notices might not require a change at all. This is caused by the fact that some names from UIkit 2 still exist in UIkit 3, but now belong to a different component or carry different semantics. This can't be detected by the selectors we use to determine if this is a correct markup, so you need to take a look into it and need to decide if you already have changed it or still need to fix it.\n(https://getuikit.com/docs/migration#notices)\n. Has been fixed: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/33ff12f0e887203a0ca4122fdb6a5660fdee7524. Please take a look how nested grids work:\nhttps://getuikit.com/docs/grid#nested-grid\n\nBoth grids apply CSS changes to the same div in your case which leads to the problem.. This can't be fixed since this comes from the build process which puts all the components together. We would recommend to use uglifyjs. You can also use the already compressed uikit.min.js file. \n. Thanks for that :). When the basic color options are not enough ( default UIkit3 comes with 3 colors when I am not missing one ( primary, secondary, default ) where you can change the colors to your needs ) you have to add the other colors with custom classes. There is no script or auto generation for more color classes in all components. . Does this still appear on the newest version? Tried this with the simulator and here everything worked as expected. If there is still a problem please add a link so we can take a look. has been fixed :) . I tested this on a surface with a external mouse and here the hover worked the same as click ( which is wished ) but I couldn't see the bug you described. Does this happen on the docs page or do you have a codepen where I can see the problem? \n. Do you have a link to your testpage or the place where it doesn't work? . Safari v7 support has ended in 2015/2016 please update to the latest version :). I am sorry I didn't head in mind that 7.1 is still supported, I reopened this, so that we will take a look into this again :). Yes since it is totally the same you just ave to use 2-3 instead of 4-6. Since there is no special need for this and would just take some extra space we thought it wouldn't be needed :)\n. I think a search and replace either within the created JS itself as well as in the rules within the uikit-migration src it self should do the trick. Since we are using CSS selectors to detect these problems, only these selectors are needed to be changed. . ",

Any suggestions?\n```\nvar input = $('#searchInput');\nvar searchdown = $.UIkit.search($('#dropSource'), { \n    source: function(release) {\n        var json = \"\";\n    $.when($.ajax({\n        type: 'GET',\n        url: '{{ base_url }}/search.json/query:' + input.val(),\n        dataType: 'html',\n        async: false,\n        timeout: 30000\n    })).done(function(data) { \n        json = data;\n        if (json) {\n            release(json.html);    \n        }\n    });\n\n    console.log(json);\n\n},\ndelay: 500,\nminLength: 4\n\n});\n```\n. I'm using this: \n```\nvar input = $('#searchInput');\nvar searchdown = $.UIkit.search($('#dropSource'), { \n    source: function(release) {\n        var json = \"\";\n    $.when($.ajax({\n        type: 'GET',\n        url: '{{ base_url }}/search.json/query:' + input.val(),\n        dataType: 'html',\n        async: false,\n        timeout: 30000\n    })).done(function(data) { \n        json = data;\n    });\n\n    console.log(json);\n\n    if (json) {\n        release(json);    \n    }\n\n}\n```\nWhich saves appropriate JSON to the console but doesn't work with the dropdown for the search.

Are you sure this is fixed ?\nI have Toshiba Satellite with touch screen, windows 10 x64, and on latest Chrome this is still not working (on Firefox is working), testing on your component page on your site, not my script\nor it is not implemented on your website yet ?\n. Being very excited to implement UIkit in my first project (migrating from Bootstrap), and going directly with v3 (even if its still Beta and not yet complete, all components)\nI will probably have to build a small / custom slider using jQuery until the built-in component will be ready, but I would like to point an important detail which in my case will be mandatory: \nthe slider / slideshow to work smoothly inside a cover container (with responsive height / viewport height) as well !\nKeep up the nice things here ;). @ruchern there's no Slider component in v3 (at least I cannot find it)\n@Riddler84 Cool, I hope that not only fullscreen, but maybe in combination with responsive & viewport height (with offsets for header & navbar for example), like Cover does. Because this was a little bit challenging and maybe others will need this, here's a how I've done it (without altering UIkit core JS): https://codepen.io/qdev/pen/WORarX\nAnd here I've explained the issues & solution above: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/2247#issuecomment-309264805\nUntil official slider / slideshow ... ;). @ruchern Nope, the overlay, cover and height-viewport are already implemented and used accordingly, I just wanted to show what I needed it for and how the complete solution looks like ;)\nI only styled a little bit differently the overlay in order to follow design request ...\nThanks !. @ruchern Oh yes, you can add or not overlays over the pictures, some can have others not, depending on the requirements ...\nThe only buggy thing which I don't like but I can live with until official / dedicated slideshare component, is that using setIntervals() for triggering clicks to automatically go to next slide it works (updated the pen), but it's defocusing / closing opened submenus (if opened) .... @saschadube\nI don't know what was @pavlosadovyi's reason for asking this, but in my case I'm trying to build kind of a replacement for missing (yet) slider / slideshow component using switcher & slidenav like I was suggested to.\nSo basically what I want is a header image rotator, with arrows as nav (no tabs), inside a height-viewport cover\nWhat I've discovered trying to achieve this:\n\nswitcher can only work connected to some kind of parent / child navigation (ul -> li) where each list item corresponds to a switcher item (maybe this can be configured somehow different using toggle option selector which defaults to > *), and this is mandatory for passing animation options as well\nuk-switcher-item works only if defined inside uk-switcher component, which means to have them on each switch / panel, which maybe I don't want but only one slidenav for all items, and I couldn't connect these like tabs\nI couldn't figure out yet why on UIkit switcher example I could change the items using JS method show('next') but on my website it didn't work, even if I copied exact same DOM code from example page ...\nunfortunately there's no way (yet) of passing options to switcher JS show method (like animation)\n\nThe only hack I could find to make this work like I wanted without touching UIkit JS code (yet), was to:\n\ninject dummy (hidden) uk-switcher-items buttons on one of the uk-switcher items\ninject dummy (hidden) uk-tab (actually any parent / child element would do the trick I guess)\ntrigger uk-switcher-items clicks from a visible uk-slidenav\n\nResult: https://codepen.io/qdev/pen/WORarX\nBarely waiting for official slider / slideshow components :). Wouldn't have been nicer not to restrict icon size with fixed width / height (and use math calculations with JS using ratio), but make them responsive and adjust them from CSS (100% dimensions of parent element) ?. It seems that the icons do not initialize if the resource JS file is loaded somehow async !\nHow can we manually initialize the icons in a callback ?\nI have my own custom / optimized JS async loader which works as expected (respects dependency and order), but the icons do not work in this case.. Here's how I async load UIkit & UIkitIcons for my website.\nHow can I initialise / render icons after everything is loaded ?\nAs you can see, the uk-icon tagged elements will have injected uk-icon class but no SVG !\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/razvanioan/rnrL38gy/3/. I don't know yet why, but I think that the cause is: connected() method of SVG component does not fire (properly), and I haven't found a solution to do this manually ... \nI've struggled to find some working solution / hack, which I execute in the UIkitIcons load callback !\n```javascript\n$(\"[uk-icon]\").each(function(idx, el){\n    icon = UIkit.icon(el); \n    // exclude our code from modals (at least) as they will get doubled\n    if(icon.$el.parents('[uk-modal]').length == 0)\n    icon.$el.append(icon.getIcon().childNodes[0].cloneNode(true))\n\n})\n``\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/razvanioan/rnrL38gy/6/. @itfinally I also haven't got the time to investigate it, but only created thehack` above which is working fine for me: check the fiddle\nI've just updated it in order to exclude my code for modals as it seems there the core framework it works by default, and I just add them twice ...\nthis got me even more confused about the cause, as I couldn't find a better way to detect if the icons already rendered by UIkit or not ...\nI will exclude it when / if the core framework will work as expected ;). Increasing the timeout interval even further from 350 to 400ms it seems to fix triggering events twice on iOS InAppBrowser (website loaded into an app WebView). And where's your Pen link ?\nHere's my UIkit 3 playground, modals are working just fine\nhttps://codepen.io/qdev/pen/vZJMPj. @fabien You forgot to load jQuery first (before UIkit). Maybe @SaphiLC refers to the user scalability (zoom) option, but that's a non-recommended method as somebody can really want to zoom in .... javascript\nUIkit.offcanvas('#invoice_sidebar').toggle();\n\nUIkit is a direct window object, so NO jQuery.UIkit\nthe first parameter of the offcanvas function is a string with the targeted element selector, no need to select it with jQuery / UIkit\nthe correct method is toggle(). @zzseba78 You've used beta35 in your pen, the latest is beta38\n\nI've found the bug on my current WIP project(s) where I update & build from github latest / master repo\nI know it was working fine in beta35, I suspect the bug was introduced in the latest changes of the position calculation module. That's one of the good points of Open Source, if something's missing, you can fix it yourself ;)\nhttps://github.com/razvanioan/uikit/blob/qdev-labs/src/js/core/svg.js\n\nline 76: removed width & height from the list of attributes in order to have responsive SVG\nline 123: triggered a custom svgloaded event (you need to add trigger on the import list from uikit-util\n\nCompile it and you have the desired event ;)\n```javascript\nUIkit.util.on(UIkit.util.$('.uk-logo[uk-svg]'), 'svgloaded', function(event) {\n  var svgLogo = UIkit.getComponent(event.target, 'svg');\n// do whatever you want with your loaded SVG here ...\n})\n```\nHope this helps !. Does it work with other SVG's, like logo for instance ? I see it's a method of UIkit.icon ...\nThe other request it's important: responsive SVG, this means without width & height attributes\nThx. Yeah, although UIkit.icon() was not working for uk-svg elements, the same solution seems to be working for SVG component, where svg property returns the load Promise:\njavascript\nUIkit.svg(element).svg.then(function(svg) { ... })\nThis can also be used to remove attributes like width & height as well in order to make it responsive, so no need indeed for my override !\nThx ;). If there's no reject callback defined, at least not throw an error or to catch it, at least that's what I'm thinking ;). So actually in the case of show(n) events, the event.target points to the current item / li (in the switcher).\nBut it would have been nice also to have an easy parameter or method callable independently (not as a result of en event) to get the current item / index.. Nothing on this yet ?\nHere's another demo, directly on UIkit Slider documentation page\n\nBrowse to UIkit Slider documentation page, and scroll to Navigation section, dotnav example\nbe sure to have a browser window width bigger than @m, in order to show 4 slides per set\ndelete all last li items, and keep only 4 of them (only one set visible) or execute the code bellow in console to automatically do this\nthe navigation (arrows & dots) will still be visible although not needed\n\njavascript\ndocument.querySelectorAll('.uk-slider')[4].querySelectorAll('li').forEach((li, idx) => {if (idx > 3) li.parentNode.removeChild(li)}). What browser do you use ? I just found that on Chrome it works as expected, but on Firefox & Safari not (I will update browser section on initial post)\nHere the screenshots (Firefox, Safari & Chrome)\nPS: I've removed the uk-visible-toggle class in order to see the arrows too\n\n\n\n. I've double checked, Chrome (at least for Mac) doesn't work, like on all the other browsers I've tested.\nBellow there's a screenshot.\nedit: also Chrome for windows is wrong (I've asked somebody to test)\nI've changed the Pen in order to automatically open the offcanvas & flipped it on the right side to see both icons.\nYeah, I've seen that it is moved in DOM the entire offcanvas content, but why all the HTML it's correct (final state, I've tested with AJAX data table too and that's fine) but the SVG not the latest state before the move, that's what intrigues me.\nSo you say that's better to reapply the SVG changes only on the first shown event, in order to make it right, I'll try that, but I'm still curious why is that.\n\n. Yeah, I know I can use CSS.\nBut unfortunately my real cases are not that simple as the pen, I'm inserting complex custom animations on the SVG on the fly, because I want to use the same external file but acting differently on parts of the page.\nThanks. ",
    "aarongerig": "@razvanioan That totally defeats the purpose of the class .uk-disabled. If you want to allow all pointer events for an element, simply don't add the class .uk-disabled nor the attribute disabled.. @iyobo Works fine on the official documentation page, right?. @iyobo If you want to have a dropbar for example you'll need to add the uk-navbar attribute. Have a look at the source code to see what exactly it does: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/develop/src/js/core/navbar.js. @iyobo Not true, you don't have to add the class uk-navbar to the navbar element. It gets added by the uk-navbar attribute, if it hasn't been added yet. See this codepen: https://codepen.io/aarongerig/pen/LqJMYy. If you'd like to use UIkit in combination with React, make sure you add the attribute with a data- prefix. So uk-navbar becomes data-uk-navbar, otherwise it won't work.\nFor further usage questions, please consult the community on Discord. https://discordapp.com/invite/NEt4Pv7. I can confirm @blagodus issue with UIkit 3 and Webpack. Right now I'm using version 3.0.0-beta.6 and it works. But if I update any version higher than beta.6 I run into the error\nUIkit.update is not a function. http://codepen.io/aarongerig/pen/XMjxMM\nOpen this pen in Chrome and Firefox and watch the console closely, while clicking on Position modifiers. In Firefox it's like .3 pixels off.\nI recommend rounding the offset value with parseInt().. Just do it like this: <div uk-spinner=\"ratio: 2\"></div>. Works fine for me.... Don't worry, I'm not developing on Safari v7. Just wanted to let you know, since you support Safari v7.1+ (according to your docs).\n\nThis issue should be reopened!\n. Actually IE11 has the same problem, because animating stroke-dasharray or stroke-dashoffset is not supported: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33812303/svg-animation-is-not-working-on-ie11#answer-33828560\nMaybe it would be best to change it to a simple html markup and css solution? Just let me know, I'd be happy to provide a PR.\n. This should be labeled as bug.\nHere's a screenshot of uikit-site in Internet Explorer (v11).\n\nThe problem is a IE bug with justify-content and auto margin.\nSolution\nSimply remove margin: 50px auto; from .uk-modal-dialog when centering the modal.. This should be labeled as bug.\nHere's a screenshot of uikit-site in Internet Explorer (v11).\n\nThe problem is a IE bug with justify-content and auto margin.\nSolution\nSimply remove margin: 50px auto; from .uk-modal-dialog when centering the modal.. Nope, like you said it has been removed.. bolder is a relative font weight:\n\nThe 'bolder' and 'lighter' values select font weights that are relative to the weight inherited from the parent\n\nbolder and lighter are even part of the official spec. How they are interpreted and displayed is up to the browser.\nSo it really depends on the font and its weights you are using inside your project. In my opinion this way a font is less \"static\", since the difference between normal =  400 and bold = 700 is quite significant.\nAnother good explanation made by CSS tricks.. @janschoenherr / @saschadube This should be resolved with https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/dda8f676a07d497dc922c45893c77e9405c0004d, right?. I will test it asap and will let you know.. Please always look at the docs (https://getuikit.com/docs/javascript) before asking such questions: \nIf you need to make sure a component is properly destroyed, for example upon removal from the DOM, you can call its $destroy function.\n```js\n// Destroys the component. For example unbind its event listeners.\ncomponent.$destroy();\n// Also destroys the component, but also removes the element from the DOM.\ncomponent.$destroy(true);\n``. Yeah, you typeduikit@2.27.4instead ofuikit@2.27.3`. Please try again.... If you're using less or sass for compiling UIkit, adjust the following variables:\n```css\n// less syntax\n@offcanvas-bar-background:                      #fff;\n@offcanvas-bar-color-mode:                      dark;\n// sass syntax\n$offcanvas-bar-background:                      #fff;\n$offcanvas-bar-color-mode:                      dark;\n```\n. @michielswaanen It\u2018s most likely not gonna happen. You should use a 3rd party library, something like flatpickr.. @KaKi87 Oh, that\u2018s just a guess and since UIkit is feature complete I simply don\u2018t think it\u2018s gonna happen.. I don\u2018t think Date/Time picker will come to UIkit 3.. Guys, have a look at purifyCSS (https://github.com/purifycss/purifycss) or unCSS (https://github.com/giakki/uncss). Great tools to do all this work. \ud83d\ude09. @saun4app Do you know the term \"RTFM\" a.k.a. \"Read The Fucking Manual\"? It exists for a reason. \ud83d\ude09 Don't expect to just watch a video or look at examples and learn a whole (frontend) framework. Some people always state \"don't make me read something\", but it doesn't get much clearer explainig something than reading and looking at examples. UIkit docs do exactly that.. @saun4app Sorry if you thought my comment was harsh, but a lot of people complain about something that is already there and are too lazy to have a real good look at it. I was more generalizing that I should of. Me myself changed frameworks about half a year ago (came from Bootstrap) and I never had a problem reading the docs until I understood all the specialities of UIkit.\nConcerning the uk-tab you were talking about:\nI think UIkit keeps tab and switcher apart because of SoC, since the framework's components rely on each other. uk-tabs are for styling and uk-switcher for toggling the tab.\nIf you have any more questions about UIkit, either ask on Gitter as @zzseba78 said or hit me up with a PM. Have fun using UIkit!. The official line of code is here. The one you are referring to is inside the theme folder, which is a starting point to create custom themes.. No bugs, simply wrong placement of closing button (tested with Chrome 59.0.3071.115):\nhttps://codepen.io/aarongerig/pen/aydgGB. Have you tried initializing Google Maps, when a tab has been switched? You can do so by using the event show. This could look something like this:\nhttps://codepen.io/aarongerig/pen/gxPNRe. I don't think this is a UIkit issue at all. Maybe this might help you:\nI personally use keyboard shortcuts to select words, even hyphenated one's.\nOn my mac a useful shortcut is Shirt + Option + Arrow Right/Left. It selects whole words. For hyphenated words I have to do click the Arrow Right/Left multiple times, but it's much faster than selecting the words with your mouse.. Yes it works, here's an example: https://codepen.io/aarongerig/pen/xLLvOp. Yes, but I'm not sure if that's a real issue when you can solve this in other ways. Don't you think my example would work for you?. On what browser(s) does this happen to you? I cannot reproduce your problem on Chrome 60 and Safari 10. The one thing I would change in your code though is the version of jQuery. Please always use the latest (currently v3.2.1) available.. For that you'd have to explicitly hide() the dropdown on click, since you're not loosing focus on it. https://codepen.io/aarongerig/pen/BdmXmM. The grid uses the following syntax:\n<div uk-grid> ... </div>, which intializes the grid using Javascript. It adds dynamic vertical margin to its children. If you want to use the grid without Javascript, simply use the following syntax:\n<div class=\"uk-grid\"> ... </div>, but with that you lack the dynamic margin.\nEither way, I recommend you using the javascript code provided by UIkit. Makes it so much more powerful. ;). @i-am-the-slime Prevent DOM bubbling with:\njs\n$('#my-svg').on('click', function(e) {\n    e.stopPropagation();\n});. https://codepen.io/aarongerig/pen/RZebpr\nThis pen might help with this issue. So basically we have to set flex-basis: auto on every element with expand behaviour. Additionally all elements with a fixed width also need to have a max-width.\nTested on Chrome 60, Firefox 55, Safari 10.1 (Attention: has to be tested on Safari < v10.1, since this got fixed with that version.), Opera 47.. @miladmeidanshahi UIkit v2 support is NOT abandoned. They still provide bug fixes for it, only new features are not implemented anymore. Also, I highly suggest you guys to use v3, even in production. Our agency is doing it and we absolutely love it! There\u2018s no need to stick around with v2 when v3 is already production-ready. Go give it a try! ;). @gustojs That\u2018s correct, right now UIkit is not optimised for server side rendering. Maybe you could provide a pull request to solve your problems?. A little bit of custom javascript and the desired functionality is there.\nhttps://codepen.io/aarongerig/pen/YxJogE. Please close this issue, since it is resolved. Thanks!. What are you talking about? What about the card and form elements is not responsive in UIkit v3?\nhttps://getuikit.com/assets/uikit/tests/card.html\nhttps://getuikit.com/assets/uikit/tests/form.html\nI'm sure you are doing something wrong.. Alright, so after a long time trying to prevent the modal from closing, I finally came up with some kind of workaround. It is very ugly, doesn't work properly (esc-close and bg-close don't work any longer) and should only be used as a temporary hotfix: https://codepen.io/aarongerig/pen/Qqbrmo\nAgain, this is not a solution to this problem and should be taken care of elsewhere!. Created a PR to fix that (see above). Thanks for reporting it!. As far as I know, it's not being worked on. At least not for now... I'd recommend you using a 3rd party lib to accomplish that.. It has been removed in beta 25, see https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md\nPlease close this issue.. Slideshow, Dynamic Grid and removing the jQuery dependency will be the next tasks.. Uummm... https://getuikit.com/assets/uikit/tests/flex.html ? . Well, you could add responsive classes pretty much everywhere. But I don't like the idea of having this functionality everywhere, because of code bloating. Let's keep UIkit as small as possible, don't you think?\nWhat about some custom CSS? It's fairly easy.. For that you could simply change the value of the following variable:\nLESS: @container-max-width: 1024px / Sass: $container-max-width: 1024px\nNo need for .uk-container-medium. @bdthemes Dude, relax... It\u2018s coming, but you can\u2018t force it.. The filter component is here: https://getuikit.com/docs/filter. Simply use the attributes like data-uk-* instead of uk-*. That way React will render them correctly.. Don't forget the sass file ;). For the sake of completeness, this should work:\njs\nUIkit.util.on(document, 'shown', '.uk-lightbox.uk-open', function () {\n  console.log('Lightbox is displayed!');\n});. @TomS- Please join Discord for usage questions and post a pen, that'll make it way easier to help. Thanks!. Ummm... where did you find the stack option for the off-canvas component? I haven't found it in the documentation nor inside the code. Am I missing something?. Ahh gotcha, haven't noticed that. I think your \"hotfix\" would be a good approach to solve the issue. Maybe you could provide a PR to fix that? :). You're totally right, documentation is lacking especially for the javascript part. The devs were on vacation and also had some other events to plan and attend, that's why things got a bit slower than before. Luckily they started to work on UIkit again, which you can see by all the commits from today for example (removing the jQuery dependency). I'd give it a shot with a PR. ;). Wouldn\u2018t that belong into the background component? I mean its only purpose is to have some extra background colors... also I think a color component should be more than just background color, since it could also include font color, border color, maybe even gradients, etc.?\nAlso I don\u2018t think this addition isn\u2018t really necessary to the core. I\u2018d rather solve this with a hook, for example:\nhook-background-misc(). UIkit\u2018s grid is based on flex, which means you can use it in combination with the flex component: https://getuikit.com/docs/flex#item-order\nIf this resolves your case, please close this issue. Thanks!. @bdthemes Why remove all data- stuff? Has nothing to do with jQuery. It\u2018s a valid HTML 5 attribute for HTML elements and is required by for example React.. What about Notifications? There you can define a \u201eautoclose\u201c option. To me a modal has to be controlable by the user. By that I mean, the user has to interact with the modal to close/open it.... Simply apply a color: value; with css and the icons will adapt to it.. @samanmohamadi SVG icons with the class uk-icon inherit the color for fill and stroke color, as you can see here: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/54b0f37db96b1e29bf43edc9db180a6bc7dfa9eb/src/less/components/icon.less#L91-L99\nYou wanted to fill out the default UIkit icons, which is not possible, because the don't have a \"filling\" in the first place. If you want to achieve that, you will have to create custom icons, as described here: https://getuikit.com/docs/custom-icons. I would suggest you to make use of hooks. Like that you can add any custom styles to any component you like. https://getuikit.com/docs/less#create-a-uikit-theme\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/develop/src/less/components/notification.less. You could do this yourself with some custom javascript. Wouldn\u2018t be too hard. ;). This is already possible. Simply add the hidden attribute to the element to be toggled. Finally, configure your desired animation and it will \"animate in\" your element.. Could look something like this...\nhtml\n<button href=\"#toggle-animation\" class=\"uk-button uk-button-default\" type=\"button\" uk-toggle=\"target: #toggle-animation; animation: uk-animation-fade\">Toggle</button>\n<div id=\"toggle-animation\" class=\"uk-card uk-card-default uk-card-body uk-margin-small\" hidden>Animation</div>. What if you just use uk-position-fixed uk-position-bottom?. Yes you can: https://getuikit.com/docs/switcher. First, instantiate your component, then call methods on it.\n```js\nvar modal = UIkit.modal('#my-modal', {\n    escClose: false,\n    bgClose: false\n});\nmodal.show();\n```\nHope that helps. :). Works fine for me...\nhttps://codepen.io/aarongerig/pen/pdaLaR. Actually they do fire: https://codepen.io/aarongerig/pen/dZjKmb\nThe only event it's not reacting to is hidden. \nBTW: If you want to find out, which element triggers an event, you can use this:\njs\ndocument.addEventListener('someevent', function(e) {\n  console.log(e.target);\n});\nThis adds an event listener on the whole document and logs the element in the console, on which the event was triggered.\nHope this was helpful! ;). @algo99 You're right, should probably be fixed. @janschoenherr What do you think? ;). For reference: https://getuikit.com/docs/tooltip#example. To reproduce this issue, simply open the background components page https://getuikit.com/docs/background in IE 11 or Edge.. As a simple workaround, here's an example:\n```js\nfunction animateValue(element, start, end, duration) {\n    var range = end - start;\n    var current = start;\n    var increment = end > start ? 1 : -1;\n    var stepTime = Math.abs(Math.floor(duration / range));\n    var timer = setInterval(function() {\n        current += increment;\n        element.innerHTML = current;\n        if (current == end) {\n            clearInterval(timer);\n        }\n    }, stepTime);\n}\nanimateValue(document.getElementById('my-element'), 100, 25, 2000);\n```. Could be achieved like this:\nhttps://codepen.io/aarongerig/pen/qVyKWJ\nWith jQuery it's even easier .... For that you have to set: uk-offcanvas=\"overlay: false\". Prevent DOM bubbling and it should be fine:\njs\n$('#ui-datepicker-div').on('click', function(e) {\n    e.stopPropagation();\n});. @Yiannistaos Yes I did: https://codepen.io/aarongerig/pen/JOaxaw. Great, then you can close this issue. Thanks!. With Less/Sass you can adjust the grid-size yourself:\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/develop/src/less/components/grid.less#L34-L43\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/develop/src/scss/components/grid.scss#L34-L43\nPlease close this issue. Thanks :). That's why you have to edit the icons before you compile them. It's the same when you place a SVG with invalid markup in your website, it will break as well. Have a look at UIkit's examples:\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/tree/develop/src/images/icons\nThe SVG markup should look like this:\nhtml\n<svg width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n    <polyline fill=\"none\" stroke=\"#000\" stroke-width=\"1.03\" points=\"13 16 7 10 13 4\"></polyline>\n</svg>. This PR became redundant with commit 6dc10c52992ede999f86654a385f01ce2d462adc .\nThanks!. IMHO, this is unnecessary. It's easy CSS you can add yourself.\nHave a look at this pen: https://codepen.io/zzseba78/pen/YEMrvZ (Thanks to @zzseba78)\nNot a lot you have to do in order to make it possible.. If you add the class uk-card-media, it prevents coloring the card contents.\nhttps://codepen.io/aarongerig/pen/POvVQp.

You're right, that doesn't work...\nBut you could use the powerful flex component to fix that: https://codepen.io/aarongerig/pen/MrJRLg. Thank you! :). As far as I know, the next beta version will include a slider component, which would fit your needs. So stay tuned for that! . @viocassel @george-kar Here's a simple example of how you could achieve something alike with some of the currently available UIkit components: https://codepen.io/aarongerig/full/KZXVjy/\n  . @dalenguyen The slideshow component is supposed to be used with images. I'd either suggest you use the switcher component (here's a small example: https://codepen.io/aarongerig/full/KZXVjy/) or try it with a 3rd party library. Good luck!. The attributes disabled and readonly do not behave the same.\nhtml\n<!\u2014 Disabled: The value is not editable and will not be submitted \u2014>\n<input class=\"uk-input\" disabled>\nhtml\n<!\u2014 Read only: The value is not editable, but will be submitted \u2014>\n<input class=\"uk-input\" readonly>\nYou can add the class uk-disabled to the desired element and style it accordingly.\nhtml\n<!\u2014 UIkit disabled: The same as read only, but with custom styles \u2014>\n<input class=\"uk-input uk-disabled\" readonly>\nHope this helps!. The only way to use a auto complete together with UIkit v3 is to use a 3rd party library like this right now: https://goodies.pixabay.com/javascript/auto-complete/demo.html. The problem here is that the div surrounding the images is hidden when your viewport is smaller than 960px (uk-visible@m). Once you remove that class, it works fine even on smaller screens.\nHope this helps!. @Alymbek Sketch and Less are not quite the same. ;) One is for compiling Less syntax to CSS and the other is for designing websites, mobile apps, etc. But your answer is helpful as well, let me explain.\nGrid\n@Lenchezzz UIkit's grid isn't based on conventional column grid. The grid works together with the Width component, which allows the following widths to be combined with each other:\n\n1/1 (=100%)\n1/2 (=50%)\n1/3 (~33.333%)\n1/4 (=25%)\n1/5 (=20%)\n1/6 (~16.667%)\nauto (according to content)\nexpand (takes up the left over space)\n\nThose widths can be nested and therefore are not limited in any way. One level of nesting extends the column amount by times 6 (1 level: 61 = 6, 2 levels: 62 = 36)\n\n1st level = 6 possible columns (+ auto / expand options)\n2nd level = 36 possible columns (+ auto / expand options)\n3rd level = 216 possible columns (+ auto / expand options)\nand so on...\n\nSo let's make a small example. This grid contains up to 2 sub grids (3 levels of nesting).\nhttps://codepen.io/aarongerig/full/zpRBjg/\nGutters\nBy default UIkit's grid allow five gutter modifiers: collapse, small, medium, default and large. Translated to pixels, the values of those are:\nScreens wider than 1200px\n- collapse (=0px)\n- small (=15px)\n- medium (=30px)\n- default (=40px)\n- large (=70px)\nScreens narrower than 1200px\n- collapse (=0px)\n- small (=15px)\n- medium (=30px)\n- default (=30px)\n- large (=40px)\nNote: These gutters also apply vertically!\nCustom gutters\nAs every other component in UIkit, the grid is also customizable. Like @Alymbek pointed out, those gutters above are default UIkit settings and can be adapted to your needs. Best you do that with either Less or Sass. More on that topic here and here.\nHope this brief explanation of the grid helps you! If not, let me know what else you want to know.\nCheers!\n  . Great, thanks!. Yes you can: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/develop/src/less/theme/accordion.less#L15-L16. You have to define a title (either an dedicated attribute on the same element or inside the uk-tooltip attribute). Have another look at the documentation: https://getuikit.com/docs/tooltip\nhttps://codepen.io/aarongerig/pen/EQPWaB\nDoes this resolve your question? If so, please close this issue.. Yeah, it\u2018s because of that line: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/develop/src/less/components/form.less#L684\nWhy don\u2018t you set the tooltip on the input?. @acollins1991 It's exactly how @m-ahmadi described it. Instead of uk-width-2-4 you'd have to use uk-width-1-2, because mathematically 2/4 is the same as 1/2.\nClosing this as it should be clear from here on.. @freefri It's described in the docs under Component options.\nHere's an example: https://codepen.io/aarongerig/pen/LQZxaM\nIf this solves your problem, please close this issue.. @dalenguyen Yes there is a way:\n```css\n/ Default state /\n.uk-accordion-title::after {\n    background-image: url('your-image');\n}\n/ Open state /\n.uk-open > .uk-accordion-title::after {\n    background-image: url('your-image');\n}\n```\nIf this solves your issue, please close this issue.. Maybe this is what you are looking for? https://getuikit.com/docs/icon#properties. Well yes, there is a workaround for this. https://codepen.io/aarongerig/pen/YJeoBg?editors=1100\nBut IMO this is not ideal, since all table header items are stacked on top of each other.\nYou may close this issue, if this resolves your problem.. No, it\u2018s definitely not a bug. It\u2018s intended behaviour.. IMHO this is not generic at all and should be done with either Less or Sass.. @Uranbold This is a usage question and should be asked in the Gitter chat. https://gitter.im/uikit/uikit\nHere's an example on how you can listen to events on multiple HTML elements.\nhttps://codepen.io/aarongerig/pen/geYbdo. That's totally intentional, because 2/6 is the same as 1/3 and so on. So instead of .uk-width-2-6 simply use .uk-width-1-3.. No, that\u2018d be redundant code, which is unnecessary.. @badpenguin Please, do not spread information that is wrong. You can extend the grid!. @badpenguin As I mentioned in the Gitter chat, the order of your media-queries matter. Pay attention to that!. Why would you copy and paste the already existing implementation into that mixin? You\u2018re not gonna overwrite the whole width component by just that mixin, just so you know.... That\u2018s intentional behaviour. Mathematically 2/4 equals 1/2 (.uk-width-1-2), 2/6 equals 1/3 (.uk-width-1-3) and so on ...\nHope this helps!. Closing this, because of lack of information. Please describe your problem in a new issue with more detail!. As @lupuxyz said, you don't have to use jQuery in order to make UIkit work.. Works fine: https://codepen.io/aarongerig/pen/zjpdRP. Nope, you're setting the switcher on the wrong element. Check this pen again: https://codepen.io/aarongerig/pen/pVpdzx\nAlso, you don't event have to trigger the show function in that scenario.. https://codepen.io/aarongerig/pen/zjLygY?editors=1010#0\nWorks fine, hope this helps!. Thanks for reporting, will be fixed with the next release: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/f25ed57afae5cf1c844f9fda6c33137b8b5f26a6. Thanks for reporting, will be fixed with the next release: f25ed57. If you prepend title: to your tooltip attribute it works. So instead of uk-tooltip=\"Hello World:\" use it like uk-tooltip=\"title: Hello World:\".. This is the wrong place to request code snippets. Maybe you could try https://stackoverflow.com/ since your issue doesn't necessarily concern UIkit's framework.. @mthomsonnz Why not use UIkit's switcher component then? ;). @violinxsc To be fair, that's true. But you could solve this problem with some custom JS code. Simply listen for the tabs to \"switch\" and initialize the slideshow programmatically UIkit.slideshow().\nWhat I meant with my previous comment, why make it complicated, when there's a solution already.... @mthomsonnz Ok, then use the switcher if the user wants to use UIkit. If the user wants to use Bootstrap use another switcher / slideshow. No biggie, right?. TBH, I would never install a plugin that comes with jQuery UI and another framework (even only partially) on top. I think you should let the user choose, which framework he wants to use. Either UIkit or Bootstrap or any other framework out there. Plus, do you really need jQuery / jQuery UI? I mean only for those tabs, it seems like an overkill to me.. Alright, then use JavaScript events to initialize the slideshow on \"show\". UIkit style would look something like this https://codepen.io/aarongerig/pen/XqLeQM?editors=1010. I see. This line of code here defines on what events the slideshow should update. As you can see the slideshow updates on load and resize. I don't even know if it's possible to detect whether the slideshow element or one of its parents becomes display: block; or even visibility: visible;, without knowing what event you have to listen to.. You have to set the alias in your webpack config: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/develop/webpack.config.js#L40\nAlso in order to add components to UIkit use the following syntax: UIkit.component('filter', Filter);\nThe icons still have to be used like UIkit.use(Icons);.

Almost, you have to import your components like this https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/develop/src/js/uikit.js#L16-L28\nYou could also import the icons in that very same file as showed in the documentation: https://getuikit.com/docs/webpack\nWith those lines you're either activating or deactivating JavaScript components of UIkit. Simply comment out the one's you don't need and you'll get a reduced filesize..

We have the same problem and the issue has been already been reported and is resolved already as well: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/a4520d1fdd8f3d0595c677371388ef484961630a\nAs soon as we have a new release this problem will no longer occur. ;). Yes, now you're on the right track!

With pug you could do it like: div(class=\"uk-width-1-2@s\"). The line import UIkit from 'uikit'; only imports UIkit's JavaScript. There was never told anything different, see the docs. If you want to load the CSS of UIkit via webpack as well, I suggest you to use either a less or sass loader, which compiles your Less/Sass to regular CSS.\nDoes this answer your question? If so, please close this issue then. Thanks!. This exists already: https://getuikit.com/docs/subnav#divider-modifier\nAnd if you want to display something different on different viewports, simply use the visibility component: https://getuikit.com/docs/visibility#responsive. There is a offset option: https://getuikit.com/docs/scroll#component-options\nPlease close this issue, if that resolves your problem.. If you read this section carefully, you'll see this part:\n\nOptions passed via the component attribute will have the highest precedence, followed by single attributes and then JavaScript.\n\nIn your example you have set the ratio of the second icon inside the HTML attribute, which has the highest precedence. Therefore it not change the size, when changing it with JavaScript.. I suppose it's for the following reason. If someone doesn't include the additional icons plugin, UIkit wouldn't have any icons to work with. Instead UIkit implements those icons it needs (navigation parent, accordion, etc.) directly into its core as CSS background images. That way, it's guaranteed that those icons display, even without the additional uikit-icons.js library. Hope this makes sense.. And what is the issue with that?\n. Closing as it is resolved.. @danbrellis You always have to clear the session storage. So in order to see the 500px image do the following:\n\nGo to the desired webpage, in this case this one\nResize your browser to less than 500px width\nOpen your dev tools and navigate to Application > Storage > Session Storage and clear that cache\nReload your browser\n\nThen you should see the 500px image. Works for me as expected.. @oshihirii Your browser / OS version is not supported by UIkit: https://getuikit.com/docs/introduction#browser-support\nYou could use a browser and/or OS version detection service to display that message. I'm sure the framework you are using is capable of such thing.. @ecksite You have to add the class uk-preserve-color to your section and it works.. Did you add width and height attributes to your image?. You have to add uk-slider-item=\"previous\" and uk-slider-item=\"next\" to the nav elements.. toggle is what you are looking for: https://getuikit.com/docs/lightbox#component-options. I'm loading UIkit's JavaScript in the head, but with the defer attribute. This ensures to not block any HTML rendering and therefore increases the site's performance. This approach makes content jump, once the JavaScript gets initialized and because of that I add the basic classes manually. So for example for the grid I code my HTML like so:\n<div class=\"uk-grid\" uk-grid>...</div>\nOr a dropdown:\n<div class=\"uk-dropdown\" uk-dropdown>...</div>\nIf you don't want to code like that, you could also add a site loading animation to cover the content \"jumping\" and remove it once the page has fully loaded.. This is not a bug! A link, whether it contains an image or not, can be dragged either into the url bar of the browser or onto your desktop to create a hyperlink. This is default browser / OS behavior and therefore totally fine.\nI'm closing this for now, feel free to reopen, if you think I misunderstood your problem.. Resolved by https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/30f01f7045d249f9d638ba0a790dfa63fa6232b0. @wortkrieg It works as expected for me. Adds the hover state to the search icon, just as described in the documentation. What exactly doesn't work for you?. You can customize the prefix to whatever you want: https://getuikit.com/docs/avoiding-conflicts#custom-prefix\nNo need for mass search and replace.. The <em> tag is for emphasizing a certain part of a text, therefore it is not explicitly meant to display text in italic. I would suggest you to do this with plain CSS:\ncss\n.uk-text-italic { font-style: italic; }. Well, then that's where the issue is. Also see: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_em.asp. If you don't like the default danger color for the <em> element, you could create your own theme with a custom color for it.. ### Simple example with yarn\n\nyarn add uikit --> installs UIkit into node_modules/uikit\ncd node_modules/uikit && yarn install && yarn compile --> installs UIkit's dependencies inside node_modules/uikit and also compiles UIkit. To simplify, add this to your package.json file under scripts and name it install. Next time you run yarn install inside your document root, UIkit will get installed and compiled simultaneously. With version 2 of yarn, this will be much easier, see https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/6953\nNow, don't ever add any of your code inside of node_modules.\nAdd your own code (CSS and JavaScript) somewhere you can easily modify and add it to git. I, for example, put it under /assets, but that's just my preference and you can name it whatever and place it wherever you want.\nSetup your workflow with webpack or any other module bundler and bundle UIkit's file with your custom code. Now you won't have to include ugly paths like /node_modules/uikit/dist/css/uikit.min.css or /node_modules/uikit/dist/js/uikit.min.js\n\nNote: If you won't bundle UIkit's code with your own custom code, don't install UIkit with yarn or npm. Simply use the CDN version or download it directly from Github.. Of course this works with gulp as well and yes, I would recommend to use webpack. Once you have some spare time, have a look at it. ;)\nSimple gulp setup\n\nyarn add --dev gulp-less gulp-babel babel-core babel-preset-env babel-polyfill\nCreate your gulpfile:\n```js\nvar gulp = require('gulp');\nvar less = require('gulp-less');\nvar babel = require('gulp-babel');\n\ngulp.task('styles', function() {\n  return gulp.src('./assets/src/less/main.less')\n    .pipe(less({\n      paths: ['./node_modules/uikit/src/less']\n    }))\n    .pipe(gulp.dest('./assets/dist/css/'));\n}); \ngulp.task('scripts', function() {\n  return gulp.src([\n    './node_modules/babel-polyfill/dist/polyfill.js',\n    './assets/src/js/main.js'\n  ])\n  .pipe(babel({ presets: ['es2015'] }))\n  .pipe(gulp.dest('./assets/dist/js'))\n});\n// maybe some other tasks ...\n```\n3. Create you custom CSS and JavaScript files:\nassets/src/less/main.less\n```less\n// Core\n@import 'uikit.less';\n// Customize your theme here ...\n```\nassets/src/js/main.js\n```js\nimport UIkit from 'uikit';\nimport Icons from 'uikit/dist/js/uikit-icons';\n// loads the Icon plugin\nUIkit.use(Icons);\n// components can be called from the imported UIkit reference\nUIkit.notification('Hello world.');\n```\nNote: This is completely untested and may contain errors.\nI'm closing this, since this has nothing to do with UIkit anymore.. This doesn't make sense. I don't know why version 2 had a composer.json in the first place. UIkit is not a PHP package and Packagist is for PHP packages only.. By default a modal gets appended to the DOM. In your case it removes itself out of the form context. Therefore you have to either set a specific container for the modal to attach to or set it to false to prevent this behaviour: https://getuikit.com/docs/modal#component-options\nIn your case <div uk-modal=\"container: false\">...</div> should be enough.. That is already being worked on, see https://github.com/uikit/uikit-site/blob/feature/js-utils/docs/pages/javascript-utilities.md\nSince it is a side project of mine and I can only work on it in my free time, you are more than welcome to contribute. Thanks!. I hope you are not using plain CSS, because with SCSS or Less you could change one variable and you would be set: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/develop/src/scss/components/subnav.scss#L18.

Sounds like you are trying to make a lightbox slideslow but with tab contents.\n\nIf you have a 'next' element inside the tabs (see documentation, page http://getuikit.com/docs/switcher.html, search for the text Switch to the next content section), you can trigger that from javascript using this: $('next_selector').trigger('click');. I guess even a hidden \"next\" element would work.\nThere's probably a full-javascript way to do this, though.\n. Shouldn't be too hard. Take a look here:\nhttp://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_settimeout.asp\nIt will look something like this:\n```\nfunction nextTab() {\n    // here comes the function to click the next tab\n    $('next_selector').trigger('click');\n// and here you call this function again\nsetTimeout(nextTab, 1000);\n\n}\n// this is to call the function for the first time\nsetTimeout(nextTab, 1000);\n``\n. Seeing your javascript as well would be useful, but if it is too hard to find out that after the last one you need to find a way to go back to the first, maybe it's a bit too far-reached for now? Also, now I see you really are making a slideshow and there are way better ways to do that. Try google...\n. Can't reproduce the error anymore, I guess it's fixed.\n. I believe I tried returning false from thebefore, but I'll try again, probably something else I forgot.\nI said \"beforeevent\", but I meant the same as you: thebefore` option.\nThanks\n. Also possible: keep FontAwesome as it is (so we would have to use fa classes) so anybody can use any version of FA without needing a new version of UIkit.\n. Ah, @robertotremonti has the best solution.\n. Not sure what you mean by your explanation, but a +1 for the Stick To Bottom (which sounds only marginally better than Sticky Bottom ;))\n. Thanks, @aheinze ! Didn't know this, and I am not the only one. Seems like a good idea to spend a chapter in the documentation on this...\n. So the site has \"core components\" under components and \"add-on components\" under add-ons.\nBut the files for \"core components\" are stored under core and the files for \"add-on components\" are stored under components.\nThat is confusing.\n. OK, good to know, thanks\n. Useless, I think. If I'd ever need this, I think adding a transparent element with tooltip center bottom on top of the button with tooltip center top could do the trick, if the mouseover was delegated properly.\n. I've made a wizard with only elements that are available now. A form with inputs that have a data-wizard-step-target=\"X\", X being 1 to 5. The steps are in a button group with data-wizard-step=\"X\".\nOf course you can style the wizard steps any way you like.\nA JS function of a few lines listens to the click event of the elements in the button group and hides all form elements except those with the data-wizard-step-target the same as the button's data-wizard-step.\nYou can add anything you want in this function: animation for showing and hiding the inputs (you might want to group input elements inside a div and show/hide the whole div at once), change the colour of the radio button elements (that's what I did, using primary, warning, and danger), add an icon to the buttons.\n. Can you be more clear on what you want to achieve?\n. Still not sure what the responsiveness means, but I assume you want to have tabs that work like tabs (so click on a tab makes it active) but do nothing else. When I use the first example from the link you provide, I get exactly that:\nhtml\n<ul class=\"uk-tab my-tab\" data-uk-tab>\n    <li class=\"uk-active\"><a href=\"\">Tab 1</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"\">Another tab</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"\">Last tab</a></li>\n</ul>\nDon't add anything else, just that. Well, I assume you want to do something when the user clicks on one of the tabs, so you would probably add your own listeners:\njavascript\n$(function(){\n    $('.my-tab li').on('click', function(event) {\n        console.debug('This is the LI that was clicked:', $(event.target));\n    });\n});\nIf this is not what you want, please explain your problem without using the word 'responsive' because that is causing some confusion.\n. I suggested you would rephrase your request without using the word 'responsiveness' because it means too much.\nThe second sentence is much clearer: click on a tab should go to another URL. Do you want that all the time or only when the tabs are collapsed into a menu? If you want it only when the tabs are collapsed into a menu, I'd say you are wanting something different than tabs. Why would you want that?\nYou could add listeners to tabs based on .uk-tabs > li > a or uk-tabs-responsive > li > a, but you'd have to listen to a page resize as well. Way too difficult. Stick to the regular tab control or do something completely different like show tabs on medium or larger screens and a dropdown button with menu items on a small screen. Then you have the default tab function on medium and larger screens and a default dropdown button on a small screen. Yes, that's code duplication but a lot less code than adding listeners.\n. That is default behaviour. If the datepicker does not show, it could be that the input has no datepicker or the datepicker on that input has not been initialized properly. If you do get a datepicker when you click on the input but not when the input gets focus, maybe you've removed the focus listener for that input.\n. Can you show us some console logs?\n. I use select2 for that:\nhttp://select2.github.io/\nI use that to style even simple select dropdowns so they all look the same. The select2 CSS needs some tweaking to make it look like the rest of UIKit, though.\n. Fair enough. But I think select2 has so much in it that it will take a while before this is copied into UIKit. Plus, I would understand if no one would touch this because select2 is good enough already.\nAlthough I like almost all of UIKit, the form elements for checkbox, radio, and select could use some improvement. Checbox and radio are in the Form Advanced add-on, but I prefer a CSS only solution that simply hides the original control and shows something else in place. That way you have the same focus and navigation abilities as with regular inputs (well, they are regular inputs, you just don't see them).\n. @kevinresol, that was not very easy. To be honest, the logic and structure of their CSS classes looks like it could be a lot simpler.\nI currently have the following but this is in an unfinished project from a few months ago so I don't remember whether it needs more:\n``` css\n.select2-container .select2-choice {\n    background-image: none;\n    transition: all 0.2s linear 0s;\n    border-color: #ddd;\n}\n.select2-container .select2-choice .select2-arrow {\n    background: none;\n    border-left: none;\n}\n.select2-container-active .select2-choice, .select2-container-active .select2-choices {\n    box-shadow: none;\n    background: none repeat scroll 0 0 #f5fbfe;\n    border-color: #99baca;\n}\n.select2-drop {\n    box-shadow: none;\n    border-color: #99baca;\n}\n```\nThis is using directly styled elements, not SASS or LESS, of course.\n. This has nothing to do with uk-grid, your JS is incorrect.\n. Your wizard request was rejected as it was too specific, see #926 .\n. Personally, I wouldn't want a toolkit like UIKit prescribe how a wizard or timeline looks like. I want it to give me the basic elements, which I can use to build the rest of the site with.\nA timeline or wizard is too specific. Let me explain. I have three different looking wizards in a single project. Making those using the basic UIKit elements is easier than to use a predefined wizard and changing two of them to get what we want. Of course, the three wizards are used throughout the project and I only had to define them once. I don't have a timeline, but the same logic applies to timelines. Build one yourself using the basic elements.\n. Works for me now as well!\n. +1! I've seen this in a few other projects and yes, that would be nice.\nIn my projects I've only needed this to set the tab when a user reloads the page so had a simple workaround by storing the active page in the localstorage.\n. The hash has become a bit abused for different things. I didn't like the way hash based routing made the anchor ability useless. But we have to deal with it. So although a hash in the URL would be most logical thing to do (ie. open the page at the anchor), I now agree with @aheinze that you should try and do it differently.\n. @malles' idea is better, cleaner, since it is in less and not css. The logic has already been done so it makes sense to have a divider-icon for breadcrumb as well.\n. I completely agree, @malles - they're all components. I don't care how the distinction is made, so long as there is a proper and consistent distinction in the changelog, documentation, and folder structure.\nCore Components and Add-on Components are the clearest names for this. So the documentation menu bar should have \"Core\" and \"Add-on\", the changelog and documentation should speak of core components and add-on components, and the folder structure for JS and CSS should have folders \"core\" and \"addon\". That would be consistent. But like I said, I don't care how, as long as it is consistent.\n. I would prefer that to be the default behaviour. I've never seen it act differently anywhere so I assume it's intended behaviour.\n. Providing both Less and Sass would be wonderful...\n. I don't follow you completely, but I can't imagine sass doesn't have an import like you need without duplicating. But my IDE (NetBeans) deals with Less as well as Sass (change a file, save it, NetBeans runs the compiler right away), so I don't complain.\n. You're right. Also, the uk-icon-square uk-text-danger looks bigger than the others, don't know why, but the idea is clear, I guess.\nMaybe I should add some more examples because the uk-icon-square-o could also be done by adding a border with border-radius to an inline-block element. More examples of course on the Fontawesome site: http://fontawesome.io/examples/#stacked\nThat site also makes me realize that there should be a way to make the second icon the bigger one in case of uk-icon-ban.\n. :+1: \n. Before this is implemented, I got an idea for a special kind of stacked icon that might be added separately: action icons for create, update, delete. In other words, crud-stack or more generally, action-stack.\nAlthough Fontawesome now includes a few icons like that (user-plus, user-times), I would love to be able to stack small and possibly even coloured icons plus, pencil, and times on top but at the bottom right of larger icons (that might be in a different colour) like user, folder, document.\nI'll mock up some examples...\n. This:\nhtml\n<style>\n.uk-icon-stack {\n    display: inline-block;\n    height: 2em;\n    line-height: 2em;\n    position: relative;\n    vertical-align: middle;\n    width: 2em;\n}\n.uk-icon-stack i {\n    left: 0;\n    position: absolute;\n    text-align: center;\n    width: 100%;\n}\n.uk-icon-stack *:first-child {\n    font-size: 2em;\n}\n.uk-icon-stack span {\n    display: inline-block;\n    width: 2em;\n    text-align: center;\n    font-weight: bold;\n}\n.uk-icon-stack-action i:nth-child(2) {\n    text-shadow: -1px -1px 1px #fff;\n    xline-height: 2em;\n    bottom: -0.2em;\n    text-align: right;\n}\n</style>\n<div class=\"uk-icon-stack uk-icon-stack-action\">\n    <i class=\"uk-icon-file\"></i>\n    <i class=\"uk-icon-plus uk-text-success\"></i>\n</div>\n<div class=\"uk-icon-stack uk-icon-stack-action\">\n    <i class=\"uk-icon-user\"></i>\n    <i class=\"uk-icon-times uk-text-danger\"></i>\n</div>\n<div class=\"uk-icon-stack uk-icon-stack-action\">\n    <i class=\"uk-icon-folder\"></i>\n    <i class=\"uk-icon-pencil uk-text-warning\"></i>\n</div>\n<div class=\"uk-icon-stack uk-icon-stack-action\">\n    <i class=\"uk-icon-folder-o\"></i>\n    <i class=\"uk-icon-pencil\"></i>\n</div>\nresults in the attached screenshot. Would be lovely to see it included (but a bit more streamlined than my example).\n\n. Instead of having a larger bottom icon, I now think I would go for a half-sized top icon...\n. :+1: \n. I remember I once used an actual line-break for a regular tooltip:\nhtml\n<a href=\"...\" title=\"This is line one.\nAnd this is line two\">...</a>\nNot sure if that would work with this one.\nI'd like the suggestion @malles gave: full html. I once did that with hidden elements, something like this:\nhtml\n<div data-uk-tooltip-target=\"#my-tooltip\">Something</div>\n<div id=\"my-tooltip\" data-uk-tooltip-source>This is <b>the</b> tooltip.</div>\n. Hm, qipt2 only adds a little bit, namely the HTML and iframe. So I would need the uikit tooltip (to be in style with the rest of uikit) and qtip for a few html tooltips? Uikit is already loading CSS and JS and showing HTML for the regular tooltip. Needing qtip2 is duplicating code.\n. How about adding some paragraphs to the documentation?\n. I did this several times but it's too easy to do by yourself that I don't really need extra UIKit classes.\nHave a look here:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/Lrdsu1oo/\nhtml\nThis is a list with asterisks:\n<ul class=\"charlist\">\n    <li>Item 1</li>\n    <li>Item 2</li>\n    <li>Item 3</li>\n</ul>\nHere one with an exception:\n<ul class=\"charlist\">\n    <li>Item 1</li>\n    <li class=\"charlistitem-at\">Item 2</li>\n    <li>Item 3</li>\n</ul>\n<style>\nul.charlist {\n    list-style: none;\n}\nul.charlist li:before {\n    content: '* ';\n}\nul.charlist li.charlistitem-at:before {\n    content: '@ ';\n}\n</style>\nIt's easy to use FontAwesome characters (and add a fixed width) instead of the * and @.\n. Ah, of course, sorry about that... \n. Thanks. I assume that UIkit's modal makes a copy then? I change the contents of '#mymodal' and then call UIkit.modal(\"#mymodal\") again and the old contents show up.\n. But modal1 and modal2 are static. Try adding a form field to the html. The second time I opened the modal (while even recreating the html including the form field) did not change, the value was the same as the previous time I opened it.\nI'll try and add a code sample when I am back home.\n. Ah, I see the difference. I have a single template (piece of html) for modals. It has an ID that does not change. See this example I use for adding buttons to a markdown editor to help our writers.\nhtml\n<div class=\"uk-modal\" id=\"our-modal\">\n    <div class=\"uk-modal-dialog\">\n        <button type=\"button\" class=\"uk-modal-close uk-close\"></button>\n        <div class=\"uk-modal-header our-modal-header\">\n            <h3></h3>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"our-modal-content\"></div>\n        <div class=\"uk-modal-footer our-modal-buttons uk-text-right\">\n            <button type=\"button\" class=\"uk-button\">Cancel</button> \n            <button type=\"button\" class=\"uk-button uk-button-primary\">Save</button>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\nThis template is not in the DOM when no modal is used, the JS adds it to the DOM as soon as the first modal is requested.\nAction buttons that add text to an editor all use the same modal but they need different modal contents. The first button shows the modal with an explanation and two text fields for a text and a URL, to add TEXT to the text area. All buttons ask for different things.\nSo I am changing the template (source of the modal) and then call this:\njavascript\nUIkit.modal('#our-modal').show();\nAnd although I changed the contents of the template, the old contents were shown.\nI solved it by $(\"#our-modal\").remove(); before opening the next one. So I am not destroying the modal but the original DOM element.\n. I haven't tested it yet, but I was thinking along those lines.\nHowever, setting the class by default on uk-offcanvas (mobile first) will trigger the javascript and then removing the off-canvas class and adding the 3/4 width class, wouldn't that screw up the layout somehow? Like I said, I need to see it work, but I was just wondering what would happen if I only removed the class. Does uikit set any listeners, perhaps?\n. Are there plans to move fontawesome to the add-ons to make it easier to choose between fontawesome and icomoon, for example?\n. Ah, that explains... Sorry, I should have noticed that myself!\n. Ooh, I found something... Sticky elements seem to have z-index 980, so both the uk-navbar and the ul.uk-nav get a z-index: 980;. When I change the z-index of the nav to 970, it looks OK. (I was setting the z-index to the wrong elements.)\nIs this something for a setting when calling sticky?\n. Or could this be done using the Sticky with showup parameter?\n. OK, I had to remove the uk-navbar-attached class and add the data-uk-sticky=\"{showup: true}\" attribute. It works! :)\n. Weird, now the before actually seems to work... Cache problem, I guess... Sorry!\n. What is data-uk-observe and where do I find it in the documentation??\n. Thanks! Wow, another showcase of how the structure of the documentation could use a bit more thought or more cross-referencing...\n. @peterbrinck 's answer is not enough, the docs don't tell us how to stick to the bottom of the page/viewport. I can enter a top in number of pixels but not a percentage. A negative number is used for a delay, not number of pixels from the bottom of the page/viewport.\nWith \"page/viewport\" I mean that if the page is shorter than the viewport is high, then the footer should stick to the viewport bottom. When the page is longer than the viewport is high, then the footer should stick to the page bottom.\nIt's possible it's a limitation of the documentation (wouldn't be the first), but a working example would be nice.\n. LOL, I completely missed the datepicker component, so thanks for this question!\n. I am having problems with getting a checkbox work in a form on a modal when trying to set the value with Vue.js. All examples from the Vue community don't work. It's like a listener is removed as soon as the modal is shown or the listeners are unreachable due to an extra listener that stops propagation of the event.\nAlso, setting a datepicker (XDSoft's datetimepicker) on a text field doesn't work when the text field is on a modal. I have to set the datepicker (jQuery('input.datepicker').datetimepicker(dtpOptions);) every time after showing the modal.\nAlso setting a listener using jQuery on the Submit button in a modal doesn't work after showing the modal. I've solved this using Vue's @click attribute (which is actually better than using jQuery because it's more Vue and less jQuery and I am moving towards Vue).\nI am too busy to check out what is going wrong and the workaround is OK for now, but I do wonder what is happening with the listeners when on a modal.\n. Same problem here.. Ouch, completely managed to miss that blog, thanks.\nI don't read anything about a roadmap or vague ideas of when those features are going to be implemented. Any ideas? No guarantees necessary, just ideas.. It works if I add this at the beginning of my main.scss:\n@import \"../../bower_components/uikit/src/scss/variables-theme\";\n@import \"../../bower_components/uikit/src/scss/variables\";. How could I have overlooked that page?! I did try and find stuff but apparently not good enough, sorry.\nMany thanks, yes, this works!. What, gitter the only way to get help? No history, no structure, 1300 people talking at the same time. I hate Slack for the office with 70 people, but gitter with so many people is even worse. Damn, this really sucks.. I was just upgrading from UIkit 2 to 3 and was having problems, but this is a reason serious enough to stop and find a different front-end framework. I hate to say it but I am really considering it right now.. OK, bye.. ",

Not sure if this is exactly what you are looking for, but I use the uk-hidden attribute to achieve something similar:\n<div>\n    <a href=\"my-image1.jpg\" data-uk-lightbox=\"{group:'my-group'}\">\n        <img class=\"\" src=\"my-image.jpg\">\n    </a>\n    <a class=\"uk-hidden\" href=\"my-image2.jpg\" data-uk-lightbox=\"{group:'my-group'}\"></a>\n    <a class=\"uk-hidden\" href=\"my-image3.jpg\" data-uk-lightbox=\"{group:'my-group'}\"></a>\n    <a class=\"uk-hidden\" href=\"my-image4.jpg\" data-uk-lightbox=\"{group:'my-group'}\"></a>\n</div>\nHope it helps.\n. Right now I was going to submit a fix for this. \nfitSize: function() {\n        ...\n        ...\n        // calculate width\n        var tmp = UI.$('<div>&nbsp;</div>').css({\n            'opacity'   : 0,\n            'position'  : 'relative',\n            'top'       : 0,\n            'left'      : 0,\n            'width'     : '100%',\n            'max-width' : $this.modal.dialog.css('max-width'),\n            'padding'   : $this.modal.dialog.css('padding'),\n            'margin'    : $this.modal.dialog.css('margin')\n        }), maxwidth, maxheight, w = data.meta.width, h = data.meta.height;\n        ...\n        ...\n        maxwidth  = tmp.width() - pad;\n        ...\n        ...\n        if (maxwidth < data.meta.width) {\n            h = Math.round( h * (maxwidth / w) );\n            w = maxwidth;\n        }\n        ...\n        ...\n});\n.

Thanks for your reply, Sascha! We following UIkit development long time, and in meantime UIkit changed its status to RC some other frameworks were released, which got more popular from start than Uikit (see Bulma for example). And that is very sad.\nWhat is sad also, that you're adding new features and removed old which were on v2 (autocomplete, calender,...). As for now there is always need to load third party libraries to got same functionality as one was with v2 out of the box. A lot of months passed and those are still not there. Core functionality was wiped in flavor of new features (which are also good too).\nWe also regulary check your blog, but... last post from \"January 11, 2018\". So, what should new users see there? Nothing new since over half a year. What will user think while seeing that? Dead.\nIf you check the stats yourself, you will notice that contributions amount is decreasing from month to month. That is also not a good sign.\nYour mentioned \"really big feature releases\" are also not that big if you compare them with v2. They were already there, got rewritten to fit v3 requirements. So, are those really that big? May be, but nothing new.\n\nWe just wanted to wait till all the features are on board before we release a stable version.\n\nSo, and there is the good point. No one know what are those features. How to contribute if we don't know what are you trying to build?\nI'm not trying to shit-post or to blame anyone, just want to know what will happen to uikit next time.. Native Date- Timepicked are only good if you don't need styling. That was nice part on v2.\nBtw, last Uikit blog post is not listed under Uikit tag. See yourself:  https://yootheme.com/blog/tag/UIkit. @zzseba78 it would be nice to have some \"size\" modifiers, like \"small, medium...\" (ref: https://getuikit.com/docs/width#fixed-width).

I really appreciate all of your hard work, just being little bit more open about where do you want UIkit to head to would be awesome :)\n. It would be useful, but not reasonable. I'm sorry guys but it's another issue that misuses HTML role in whole document. You seem to forgot that HTML should only describe content and not presentation to highest possible level.\nI know that it's hard to keep this separation of concerns nowadays, but the point is that, in my opinion, the majority of frameworks provide to many classes like this one, which encourages developers to pollute their HTML more then they should. Of course, it's impossible to avoid classes like this all the time but in many cases they can be easily replaced but a few lines of CSS. \nAlso keep in mind, that practices like this one may not have any negative impact at the beginning or inside small projects, but they are prone to introduce difficulties in maintaining code later.\nIn this situation for example you would want to change floating of element depending on viewport width which would require to overwrite this class in particular cases.\nHope you got my point ;-)\n.

Spliting it to theme.base.less would just allow to exclude it from build stylesheet.\n. I am a strong +1 for this. I have been already combining my BEM CSS with uikit's one using brackets to visually group classes and this would greatly unify my style e.x.:\nhtml\n<form class=\"login-form [ uk-form ]\">\n    <input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"\" class=\"login-form__input [ uk-form-large ]\">\n    <input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"\" class=\"login-form__input [ uk-form-small ]\">\n</form>\n@florianletsch As to utility classes, we could simply have uk-text--center, uk-float--left, uk-float--right etc. which would make sense to me.

If I'm getting you correctly it was a problem I ran into too. When you have a parent that is meant to be clickable to oen up the sub-items make sure the anchor points to '#':\n<div id=\"offcanvas-1\" class=\"uk-offcanvas\">\n        <div class=\"uk-offcanvas-bar\">\n            <ul class=\"uk-nav uk-nav-offcanvas uk-nav-parent-icon\" data-uk-nav>\n                <li class=\"uk-parent\">\n                    <a href=\"#\">Parent</a>\n                    <ul class=\"uk-nav-sub\">\n                        <li><a href=\"\">Sub1</a></li>\n                        <li class=\"uk-parent\">\n                            <a href=\"\">Sub2</a>\n                            <ul>\n                                <li><a href=\"\">SubSub1</a></li>\n                            </ul>\n                        </li>\n                    </ul>\n                </li>\n            </ul>\n        </div>\n    </div>\nI got this from the docs and combined the Accordion form http://getuikit.com/docs/nav.html and the offcanvas markup from here: http://getuikit.com/docs/offcanvas.html Offcanvas navs\n. I think what he does wrong is that he has the generated and hidden div's allready in his html instead of using the right code snippet from the docs. \n. This would actually interfere with this: http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/ (if present)\n. I can't test it right now but is it related to the space between the < and input and the space at the end between value=\"Submit\" and >?\n. Use the 2.11.1 build: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/v2.11.1/CHANGELOG.md\n. As far as I can see from the docs it works like that:\nif you use an URL for example, the autocomplete sends an ajax request to the url from the source attribute. The string that is the input is stored by default in the search variable. so you need to make sure you respond with a JSON data string.\nAJAX Method\nIn Laravel 4  it would look something like that:\n``` php\nRoute::post('/ajax/search', function()\n{\n    $searchValue = Input::get('search');\n    / do some database stuff here /\n    $results = DB::table('cities')->where('name', '=', $searchValue . '%')->get();\n    / you need to build the json in a specific format see here: \n     http://getuikit.com/tests/components/_autocomplete.json */\n    $wellFormedArray = array();\n    foreach($results as $result)\n    {\n        $wellFormedArray = array_push(array('value' => $result));\n    }\n    return Response::json($wellFormedArray);\n});\n```\nSo the HTML sould look like that:\nhtml\n<div class=\"uk-autocomplete uk-form\" data-uk-autocomplete=\"{source:'/ajax/search'}\">\n    <input type=\"text\">\n</div>\nThis is my header\nhtml\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <script src=\"/js/jquery.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"/js/uikit.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"/js/addons/autocomplete.js\"></script>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/css/uikit.css\" />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/css/addons/uikit.addons.css\" />\n</head>\nCallback Method\nThis one was tricky and I only got it to work via JavaScript (to make it short, I mixed it with the html). HTML Header is the same as the previous example:\nHTML\n<div class=\"uk-autocomplete uk-form\" data-uk-autocomplete id=\"callback\">\n    <input type=\"text\">\n</div>\n<script>\n    var autocomplete = $.UIkit.autocomplete($('#callback'), { 'source': callBackExample });\n    function callBackExample() {\n        /* just for debugging purposes, here goes your JSON building */\n        console.log('callback');\n    }\n</script>\nArray Method\nIs pretty obviously described in the docs\nEdit: Sorry if you allready read this, I made a couple of mistakes and did just verify it.\n. So I wasn't that far off :smile: \n@aheinze This should be added to the docs as well\n. Duplicate https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/703\n. When you look at the docs at http://getuikit.com/docs/addons_htmleditor.html#tab-mode and click on the preview link, then go to thje page source code you see the following:\nhtml\n data-active-tab=\"preview\"\nBut this doesn't work. So you need to send the click event to the \"Preview\" link via JavaScript/jQuery\njavascript\n$('.uk-htmleditor-button-preview').trigger('click');\n. You forgot the \nhtml\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/addons/uikit.addons.css\" />\nThis can happen since it's not clear from the docs\n. The JSON returned in this example is only provided as is. What will be returned in your real world project is your thing.\nSee https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/704 \nThere I quickly showed a Laravel 4 route skeleton. But it applies for more purposes: The autocomplete component sends the search parameter to your webserver and expects an json object with matcing entries in response.\nThe callback and array functions are there if you make the requests with different aproaches ($.ajax, ember.js or something like that)\nTL;DR: You need to implement the logic that filters the entries (that are returned) by yourself. UiKit is a frontend framework not a backend controller.\n. Look at this: http://getuikit.com/docs/documentation_javascript.html#dom-observe\n. Can you share a code snippet of your skeleton HTML and the stuff you inject? You can use JSFiddle (it can be fed with the UIkit library) or simply a gist\n. Hmm, I can not spot the error. The hmtl and ajax call look valid. Is it valid if you paste the output of the PHP backend function into the html skeleton source (maybe somewhere is a ' or \" missing so that PHP isn't complaining but the html is not valid and therefore the mutation observation fails (just pointing in the dark)?\nThe error on line 588 in uikit.js is triggered from here: https://github.com/uikit/bower-uikit/blob/master/js/uikit.js#L588 There the \"observee\" get's initialised.\nMaybe try to put the data-uk-observe into the <table> tag?\n. Use the JavaScript workaround from here: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/778 or as originally documented here: http://getuikit.com/docs/documentation_javascript.html#dom-observe\n. Related: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/764\nSeems like the data-uk-observe is broken.\nEdit: the problem is due to this (from here and here): \n\nAlso worth mentioning is that we moved UIkit to the global namespace, so you can access UIkit directly with UIkit instead of $.UIkit. The reference within jQuery is deprecated now.\n\nBut I'm unable to fix this myself.\n. Related: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/764\nSeems like the data-uk-observe is broken.\nUse the JavaScript workaround from here: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/778 or as originally documented here: http://getuikit.com/docs/documentation_javascript.html#dom-observe\n.

It shows up in my notification lsit but I can't see it in the issue.\n. You use angular or something, right? I can't help you with that. No experience in this.\n. The whole \nhtml\n<script type=\"text/autocomplete\">\n    <ul class=\"uk-nav uk-nav-autocomplete uk-autocomplete-results uk-dropdown-scrollable\">\n        {{~items}}\n        <li data-value=\"{{ $item.value }}\">\n            <a>\n               <i class=\"{{ $item.value }}\"></i>\n               {{ $item.title }}\n               <div>{{{ $item.value }}}</div>\n            </a>\n         </li>\n         {{/items}}\n    </ul>\n</script>\nbaffles me. Why do you put this in a script tag?\n. From this, this and that i would guess it has to look like this:\n``` html\n This is a button toggling the modal \n...\n This is the modal \n\n\n\n        ...\n    \n\n```\nI can't test it right now.\n. I think you need this. Sorry, can't test right now.\n. @sommarbar you could implement a simple cookie with Javascript that listens to the change.uk.tab event and stores the current tab.\nThe event gets fired when you click on a tab. See here\n. from http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_cookies.asp:\nif your HTML looks kind of like this:\nhtml\n<ul id=\"city-tabs\" class=\"uk-tab\" data-uk-tab>\n    <li class=\"uk-active\">{loadposition stock}</li>\n    <li>{loadposition malm}</li>\n    <li>{loadposition g\u00f6te}</li>\n    <li>{loadposition upps}</li>\n</ul>\nYou could doo something like this:\n``` javascript\nfunction setCookie(cname, cvalue, exdays) {\n    var d = new Date();\n    d.setTime(d.getTime() + (exdays2460601000));\n    var expires = \"expires=\"+d.toUTCString();\n    document.cookie = cname + \"=\" + cvalue + \"; \" + expires;\n} \n$(\"#city-tabs\").on(\"change.uk.tab\", function() {\n    var cityName = $(\".uk-tab > .uk-active > a\").html()\n    if(cityName != \"\")\n    {\n        setCookie(\"cityName\", cityName, 7);\n    }\n});\n``\n. Also take a look at that:: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/document.cookie#A_little_framework.3A_a_complete_cookies_reader.2Fwriter_with_full_unicode_support\n. Come on. This isn't about me making it all work for you. I don't have that much time. You can put this code in your template or stuff it into an external JavaScript file and reference it in your template.\n. from the docs it looks like you need to add thedata-uk-scrollspy=\"{topoffset: 47}\"attribute  to the scrollspy element.\n. I can't see the scrollbar on my screen (24\" FullHD)\n. Yepp on 1400x1050 in Firefox ESR 31.4.0 I can see it too.\n. The event you are looking for ischangenotonChange. Anyway you should maybe listen to theselect.uk.autocomplete` inside the date picker (the datepicker uses the autocomplete component).\njavascript\n$(document).ready(function() {\n    $('#time').on('change', function() {\n        alert(\"Monkey\");\n    });\n});\nAlso your syntax looked messed up, or maybe now I'm tired\n. You are right, that the date picker is not firing an event. This is due to the fact that it is using the autocomplete component. But I guess it would be the right call to ask for some date picker events like show.uk.datepicker, hide.uk.datepicker and update.uk.datepicker.\n@aheinze Maybe you guys could take this into consideration.\n. you need to listen to the changeevent of the underlying autocomplete component. See https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/884 and https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/872\n. From the source at https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/js/core/offcanvas.js#L46 the .css() should do that. The implementation according to the jQuery docs for multiple css properties looks fine.\n. Useless feature I think\n. So just to make sure everything is working do the following:\n- Make sure jQuery is loaded before js/uikit.js\n- add the stylesheets js/uikit.css and css/components/slideshow.css\n- add the JavaScript files for the component too: js/component/slideshow.js\n- add the css/components/slidenav.css for the cursors\nHere the boilerplate from the tests page:\nhtml\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <script src=\"http://getuikit.com/vendor/jquery.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"js/uikit.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"js/components/slideshow.js\"></script>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/uikit.css\" />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/components/slideshow.css\" />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/components/slidenav.css\" />\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div data-uk-slideshow=\"\" class=\"uk-margin uk-width-1-2\">\n        <div class=\"uk-slidenav-position\">\n            <ul class=\"uk-slideshow uk-overlay-active\" style=\"height: 571px;\">\n                <li class=\"\" style=\"animation-duration: 500ms;

Unfortunately I can not provide a PR. Too dumb to make it look good.\n. @malles Still if you override the template it won't be parsed by the UI.Utils.template function since the pattern matching is against {{.}},{{{ and }}}. the idea for a global enclosing/escaping tag isn't that bad though. Allthough I am not aware where else in the framework this function is used (from searching the repo for \"template(\" it only shows https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/e38cfbbb12287c7db18c6f87149636fd142580e1/src/js/components/datepicker.js#L252 as a right result apart from the autocomplete.js file)\n. Ah, after thinking about it it makes sense since the JavaScript files are not parsed by twig. So yeah that is a working solution.\n. This looks neat! Allthough the once with the letters could use some editing to push the letters a bit mir to the top.\n. This is actually quite out of question.\n. You need to define the logic which menu item has the uk-active class yourself. It's not Uikits jo to do your logic/templating stuff. It's just fpor decoration as it is a CSS frontend framework.\n. https://www.drupal.org/node/97193\n. Up and running for me\n. Just checked with FF and IE (ugh) again and I don't see the down message. Do you use VPN or a roxy?\n. I am not quite sure if you are using the right Uikit package since there is a package named Uikit for OS X/iOS development (which I think you only get when you have a developers license?) aswell.\nThis Uikit right here is a frontend CSS framework and not a OS X Library\n. I'm bugged by this too.\n. put a <div class=\"uk-clearfix\"></div> between the header and the meta div\n. @Intiligent Did you make the wizard yourself? Looks really cool and fits the theme very well. Maybe you can share that? with a fork or something?\n. @Intiligent I meant if you have the markup + css for the wizard? Or is it just photoshopped? Because the official Uikit doesn't have a wizard component.\n. @Intiligent Ah I see where you got it from. I like it! Thanks for sharing!\n. Maybe you can use jQuery.ajaxSetup() before sending the request to the laravel backend. I think you could use it maybe like\njavascript\nUi.$.ajaxSetup(...);\n. Fuck. now I am hungry for pizza. Also reproduced here again:https://uikitplay.com/plays/FXsG\nUiKit version as of today is 2.26.2\n. Give the section you want to link to an id like\nhtml\n<section id=\"firstsection\">\n...\n</section>\nand use the standard link with the pound sign:\nhtml\n<a href=\"#firstsection\">Link to the first section</a>\n. :+1: good component + clean solution provided\n. What are you asking for exactly? \n\nThe caret-down is on the right side i both examples.\n. A now i understand. I bet it's because the targetoption will save the selected text/value to the inner html of the target. and since <input>doens't have inner html it's not shown.\nedit: I was almost right: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/develop/src/js/components/form-select.js#L53\nThis could be done with a simple  PR like:\n``` javascript\n// js/component/form-select.js\n/!

I think I know why:\nin the minified version of the gradient theme (probably the other theme too) the hr border-top definition is not combined in one hr css selector.\nthe second hr css selector has border: 0 in it, which overrides the first definition.\nso there is something wrong with your minification process here, because in the unminified version everything is correct!\n.

Get it?\nAnd guess what, YooTheme is starting too: Pagekit uses Vue! The only reason they need jquery is for some UiKit stuff that could be replaced with simple vanilla JS functions.\nI really loved jquery, but now I only need it for some UiKit stuff. If you haven't used Angular or Vue then try it, you will see that your 30 kb compressed stuff is a bit much for some functions that easily could be replaced.\nAngular startet with jquery too, now they moved away from that. It's starting to get too heavy.\n. The benefits are huge! And for marketing you can place another checkmark for \"No jQuery dependency\" on comparison lists. How cool is that?\nBetter now than later.\n. For point number 2, the comments here are incorrect. If you load the JS at the bottom of the page, your uk-grid can be show a \"stacked\" version instead of \"side by side\" for the elements (until the JS is loaded). This is in a lot of cases visible for a very short period.\nTake a look at this isse: #2792 . Take a look at this issue: #2792 . @zzseba78 you are right! This should be in the documentation.\n\nTo create the grid container, add the uk-grid attribute to a <div> element. There's no need to add a class.\n\nSource: https://getuikit.com/docs/grid#usage\nThat is wrong, there is definitely a need! Please update the docs:\n\nTo create the grid container, add the uk-grid attribute to a <div> element. This will add the class uk-grid via JavaSript to the <div> element. It is likely that you will load the UIKit JavaScript before the closing body tag. If this is the case, you should add the class uk-grid class manually to the <div> element, to prevent stacking.. Actually, if the need for the attribute is eliminated when only the class uk-grid gets added, then that would reduce the JS too.\n\nUsing a class is for most of the people more common and brings in this case even important benefits/fixes. So the docs should be like:\n\nTo create the grid container, just add the uk-grid class to a <div> element, e.g. <div class=\"uk-grid\">.\n\nThat's all you need, no more stacking etc.. > The JavaScript part of the grid component applies margins between rows, whenever the grid starts to stack and also adds a class to the first column of a grid.\nWhy does JS apply margin? Shouldn't this be a CSS part?\nHowever, the documentation still should be updated like stated above.. Yes, plus the class for the wrapper element. I bet there are a lot of people that include the JS before the closing body tag. And you could remove a little bit of logic from JS (adding the class).. ",

I have noticed development on Uikit appearing to stall and so was worried that things were not being developed as much as they once were. Knowing that v3 alpha is out in the fall puts my mind at ease. Can't wait to see what you have produced :)\n. In my opinion I would much rather they hire more staff and push on with all the products they have. ALL of their products are excellent, but like you say the problem is that they are spread too thin to make each product reach its full potential. Zoo is a prime example of this - absolutely fantastic product that could be absolutely mind blowing but has received very little attention in over 3 years now.\nPlease Yootheme hire more people! If it means prices of the software has to go up then so be it, I am sure all of yootheme\u2019s loyal customers would happily pay for this if it meant better support and more regular development across the board (and not just focused on uikit, then widgetkit, then pagekit for example, but teams focussing on ALL products ALL of the time).

I appreciate the non hulk-smash style box-sizing declarations but using selectors like [class*='uk-width'] to set it on or off totally breaks doing something like the above.

The header covers the elements until they are 'stuck' and are rendered on top of the header.  If the z-index of all of the sticky elements and containers was set higher than the header by default, that would help.\nHonestly, I just wouldn't use a sticky header on the docs/demo site.  IMO, the links aren't going to be quickly navigated between enough to justify constantly taking up screen real estate, from a UX perspective.  This would also create less confusion by having the demo scaffolding be as basic of implementation possible.  Having an element with the unique (to a new user) 'sticky' behavior being rendered on top of elements before the component's behavior is introduced could confuse the learning process.  If the header wasn't sticky you could see blocks being 'stuck' to the top of the screen, without the confusion of having to figure out that there is another sticky element being rendered on top/in-between the demo elements.\nI'm sure you guys could come up with other elegant solutions.

Hi Nicolai,\nThanks for your informative response.\nFrom a developer pointer of view I can see why the touch.js listens to the \"touch support\" of a device as to whether it fires of a touch event.\nBut from a user/behaviour point of view why would they expect a tap to be fired when they click a mouse?\nIf that is how pointer-events are designed in IE11 then surely the touch.js framework should make sure that the behaviour is the same for all browsers shouldn't it?\nBecause now IE11 works different from every other browser including IE10, which now makes working with touch events really difficult.\nMoreover, I could understand if the message was UIkit detected touch support ... and a touch event was fired but it actually says the opposite; UIkit did not detect touch support on your device! :( but still fires a touch event which suggests unexpected behaviour.\nRegards,\nPaul\n.

The grid component actually caches the columns in the elements data attribute:\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/js/grid.js#L144\nSo then when we re-render the li elements, I have to call $.UIkit.$doc.trigger(\"uk.dom.changed\");\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/js/grid.js#L37\nIs there a better way of doing this?\nThanks.\n. Dang wrong branch...\n. More on the Zeptos convo: https://github.com/madrobby/zepto/pull/937\n. It's a timing issue. If you call .hide() and then .show() immediately after, the show method calls .hide(true) which forces a hide and the first .hide() call finally gets processed during this event: UI.support.transition.end which causes the activeCount to go negative.\n. You can recreate the issue by going here: http://getuikit.com/docs/modal.html\nAnd in the console enter this: UIkit.modal('#modal').show(); UIkit.modal('#modal').hide();\nNow try and scroll, or click, or just interact with the window in general.\n. Ok I got to the bottom of this one. If removeClass('uk-open') gets called before the addClass('uk-open') modal transition has happened, then UI.support.transition.end never actually fires and this._hide() never gets run.\nProposed change adds a hasTransitioned property to the modal component. If client supports transition, we attach a one time event listener when we add class to switch the hasTransitioned flag. Then in the hide method, we check to see if the open transition has happened or not to decide whether we should try and transition out the modal or just force close it.\n. ",

I'm not sure a requirement to use uk-icon-* is the best here. While I do want the ability to use uk-icon-*, as that often does come up, not having a default is cumbersome as well.\nInstead of removing @overlay-icon, we could use this instead:\n.uk-overlay-icon:not([class*='uk-icon-']):before {\n    content: @overlay-icon;\n}\n.uk-overlay-icon:before {\n    position: absolute;\n    top: 50%;\n    left: 50%;\n    width: @overlay-icon-size;\n    height: @overlay-icon-size;\n    margin-top: -(@overlay-icon-size / 2);\n    margin-left: -(@overlay-icon-size / 2);\n    font-size: @overlay-icon-size;\n    line-height: 1;\n    font-family: FontAwesome;\n    text-align: center;\n    color: @overlay-icon-color;\n    .hook-overlay-icon;\n}\nTherefore, when not using .uk-icon-*, the default @overlay-icon is still used, and not enforcing an icon selection for each overlay icon.\n. Try checking the grid children after update. Something similar to:\n$('[data-uk-grid]').on('afterupdate.uk.grid', function(e, children) {\n    var isVisible = false;\n    children.each(function() {\n        if($(this).is(':visible')) {\n            isVisible = true;\n        }\n    });\n    if(isVisible == false) {\n        // nothing is visible, do something\n    }\n});\n. Your issue is likely that the browser is blocking the request to the URL. Check your console for Cross-Origin Request Blocked or something similar.\nFurthermore, the data on your URL is not formatted for the autocomplete component. http://getuikit.com/tests/components/_autocomplete.json\nThe likely place you need to start to get this working is to setup a server side implementation.\n. Try \n<iframe src=\"<url>\" data-uk-cover=\"{automute: false}\"></iframe>\nThe controls for the video player will likely be out of view using covers, and having sound play through without being able to mute it would suck.\n.

Is this still an issue with 2.17? For me, it's fine running the touch test on the latest developer build on a Dell Latitude, W 8.1, IE 11.0.9600.17631\n. Hi,\nso here is the deal: Using IE 11 on a Windows 8.1 machine, that does not support touch, you get the message UIkit did not detect touch support ... which is correct. If your Windows 8.1 device does have a touch interface you get the message UIkit detected touch support ...which is correct, too.\nBut there may be touch events detected (like swipe and tap) in IE11 on Windows 8.1, although they do not come from a touch input but a mouse. This is due to the pointer-events we are listening on. IE11 fires them, no matter if you use touch or mouse. And this exactly how those events are designed.\nBest,\nNicolai\n.

Hi Paul,\nBut I think this is a basic problem with touch input on devices which also support mouse AND touch input. You are merely not able to find out, if the current input comes from a touch or a mouse input. Especially in IE11 :)\nIf you look at the source code of the tests, you can see the following:\njavascript\njQuery(window).bind('swipeRight', 'body', function(e) {\n    jQuery('#output').prepend('<li>swipe right</li>');\n});\njQuery(window).bind('swipeLeft', 'body', function(e) {\n    jQuery('#output').prepend('<li>swipe left</li>');\n});\njQuery(window).bind('tap', 'body', function(e) {\n    jQuery('#output').prepend('<li>tap</li>');\n});\nYou can see, that we are listening to normal tap and swipe events... If the browser (IE11) fires those events, when a mouse is used, we cant do nothing against this :) Those events are not manipulated by UIkit. However you can use those information (if touch was detected), to handle those events accordingly. We do this in our JavaScript code at some points...\nAt the end, also remember that this is just a test, where you can see, if UIkit detected touch support on your device and if some touch-gestures are working...\nBest,\nN\n.

However, if this is not a static site, you can of course use the same renderer for both menus and only need to change one CSS class.\n. Because I did not think about it ;) That works, too.\n. @aheinze I have a website, where the navigation is aligned to the right. The furthest right element has a dropdown. All dropdowns are by default aligned bottom left. When I open the dropdown on the furthest right, it is automatically flipped to bottom right because there is not enough space on the right side. In an older UIkit version I was able to align the text to the right using CSS, because there was a class added to the dropdown named uk-dropdown-flip. This has been removed and I wanted to re-add this behaviour, because in the latest UIkit version there is no class added to the dropdown when it automatically flips horizontally.\nThere may be something I am missing, but I did not find anything, that gives me a hint, that the element was automatically flipped to the other side.\nThe PR is basically to allow custom styling.\n. @aheinze I have a website, where the navigation is aligned to the right.

Ok thanks, but it's nevertheless a bug in UIKit or am i wrong?\nIt's not a problem to me personally. I have found it more or less accidentally.\nI only used the code from the UIkit Docs in the codepen example and it don't work as it should be. You can't combine uk-tab-center with uk-tab-bottom. The border-line is then on the wrong side.\nEdit: I have take a look in the tab.less file and it seems there is a undocumented uk-tab-center-bottom class. Using this class change the border to the top, but its doubled and also the tabs are not centered anymore. Pasting the class to the other uk-tab-center classes solved this problem.\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/pull/1385\n. Shame on me ;) I hadn't thought on this simple solution.. thanks!\n. @razvanioan The v2 Slideshow has already a fullscreen feature. I'm pretty sure, this will also be possible with the new v3 version of the Slideshow.. Have tested a lot of different zoom states from 50% to 300% on https://getuikit.com/assets/uikit/tests/scrollspy.html and everything looks good to me. (Latest Chrome). You have basically a few options to compensate this. I don't really miss the 10 Grid classes ;)\n\nNested Grids allows you to have any number of grid items per row as you want.\nThe new uk-width-auto and uk-width-expand classes gives you great flexibility and you can mix them with the normal uk-width-classes.. Ok you're both right. If you need columns with exactly 10, 20, 30% and so on, you can't achieve this with uikit3 at the moment, unless you write custom css on top. So, i understand the wish to have it back. \n\nPersonally, i'm totally fine with the actual grid and width components, because i haven't used the 10th classes before.. Hi, its only clipped because the offcanvas layer has set overflow-y: auto. Set it to initial or visible and the dropdown will be completely visible.\nBut btw. this is not the right place for support questions. Ask them here  or here  ;). No, it's not. We've only get a styling for the html5 range input, but no javascript implementation. So theres no tooltips, scale labels or double slider yet. :/. Yes, because this site simply doesn't exist. And like the others, i can't find any link in the docs, which leads to the site you've mentioned. So.. where is the link? ;). What's the matter? Looks good to me.\nhttps://codepen.io/Riddler84/pen/BRdzxN\nDid you put the required input inside a form element? That's required ;). The red border is rendered by firefox. It has nothing to do with uikit. Firefox applies the pseudo-class -moz-ui-invalid to the input, which is defined with a red box-shadow. You can overwrite it, if you want.. What you see there is simply a grid with a sticky nav menu in the left column. You can do this easily with uikit too, like in this example: https://codepen.io/Riddler84/pen/JNrqwK. Same problem here, but i'm using not the scope mode. If i close a modal via JavaScript, e.g. modal.hide(), then the scollbar will stay hidden, because of the uk-modal-page class, which remains attached to the html element.. The \"block\" component was replaced with the \"section\" component. You have to change your markup if you want to use the new version. I don't really understand your problem, the v2 documentation is still accessible and downloadable via the uikit frontpage, if you don't want to use the beta.. You should test it with the actual beta-build before you write an issue.. You can simply overwrite the CSS rule with your own.\ncss\n.uk-offcanvas-bar {\n    background: #fff;\n}. You mean this?\nhttps://getuikit.com/docs/tab#alignment. Check out the transition component. Btw. support questions belongs here.. The modal alert is not like the javascript alert. The message has to be a HTML string, so try <br> instead.. I cannot confirm this. I'm using Win 10 and Chrome and i have clicked very rapidly ;). What you mean with \"not readable\"? I can read it very well. But if you want to change the color to black you could simply change the LESS variable or overwrite the CSS.. No, it's not hurting my eyes ;) Ok, the muted links at the left could be a bit darker, but the overall text color is totally ok for me.\nBut it's nothing more than a default theme and you are encouraged to change it to your needs. I don't really see a reason to change it to #000 by default. That would be too much contrast for me. But maybe, i'm a special case ;). There is no .uk-dark class, because that's the default. You have to use the .uk-light class to lighten text up on dark backgrounds.\nhttps://getuikit.com/docs/inverse. @aarongerig Wow, nice tip, thank you. Will definitely take a look :). Pretty much what @aarongerig said. The tab component is only there for styling purposes. The functionality comes with the switcher component, which can switch not only tabs, but also buttons, navs and subnavs. \nSo it's logical to split these things, because you can also use a tab menu without the switcher component, by using the tab menu items as normal links.\nAnd the first paragraph on the tab page has a big hint on the switcher component and explains how they work together. ( mentioned before by @zzseba78 )\nI think this makes it clear enough. A bit reading could be expected, couldn't it? ;). But then you should update the docs, because the description of the animation option mentioned a second  parameter in a comma separated list.\n\nSpace separated names of animations to apply. Comma separate for out animations.\n\nBut in general i think, why not let the users decide, if they want closing animations?. Set data-type=\"iframe\" or just type=\"iframe\". https://codepen.io/Riddler84/pen/RZGELQ. There is no example because there is no uk-section-overlap anywhere in the code. There's just a hook in the LESS and SCSS files, but no default CSS markup.\nMaybe it will come later or it has been forgotten ;). Are you using the scroll component in combination? The active status is only applied, if the anchor is in viewport. And if you have a long text, the scrolling could need a moment.\nNevertheless a codepen example is always helpful.. uk-panel is still part of v3. https://getuikit.com/docs/utility#panel\nThe benefit of tiles is discussable, but it's an easy way to create formatted and/or colored boxes. It combines several components, if you will... Try .uk-form-icon {cursor: pointer}. The :hover makes no sense, because you see the cursor change always only at hovering over the element.\nEdit: There is also a pointer-events: none active, if the icon is no link, button or input element. You have to overwrite this or make it a clickable icon. https://getuikit.com/docs/form#clickable-icons. Is there a difference between the user agent stylesheet of Chrome in Windows and Mac? Because i'm using Win10 and here i have no border radius. But a few more other default styles as in your screenshot.. Already fixed.\n2943 . It's fixed in the develop branch and will merged into master when they released the next beta version. I'm sure it will be soon.\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/583037ca1d835b2555152c88c864509f30ba1425. I think this is intended behaviour.\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/2163\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/1414\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/1290. @HassaN0152 I've linked these topics because of the statements of the devs in them, not because of a possible solution. Like @janschoenherr mentioned, it's not officially a \"problem\" ;). Basically the font is all the same as default. LESS and SASS files will use the global font-family. But you have the possibility to change the font-family for headings, navbar and pre-tags etc.\nI think it's important to have the choice, because it can be often desired to use an other font for headlines as for normal text.

Stylistic differences aside, you can see that the stacked text inside of the Bootstrap button is more presentable.\n\nThanks!\n. \"Unitless line heights are recommended due to the fact that child elements will inherit the raw number value, rather than the computed value.

If there is another element which name starts with a, inner html code will become malformed.\nbtw: the href tag is (unfortunately) mandatory, that's why there are <a href=\"#\">s around and probably space is assumed.\n. Okay, I was wrong and it's little more complicated: <a> element without href attribute is valid, but it's not a link so won't be receiving focus when navigating on page using tab key (see this SO answer)\n.

    "rvalitov": "It's 2017, and the UIKit 3 is here. Still the checkbox toggles are missing.... Faced a similar problem. The off-canvas rendering is fine, but scrolling is not working. In my case it happens if:\n- I want to use the off-canvas as a mobile side menu\n- I put a Nav component inside the off-canvas\n- initially the whole content of the off-canvas fits the screen (no scrolling is needed), but when the Nav's elements expands, it becomes too long and requires vertical scrolling. In this situation the scrolling breaks on iPhone and iPad. Reopening the off-canvas can sometimes allow scrolling (for some time, the scrolling can break again any time).\nAfter googling I found out that it's a well known bug with iOS: scrolling breaks inside a div if dynamic content is added which is greater than the height of the wrapper. You can google a phrase \"scrolling problem iPhone for div fixed position\" and similar. There's a nice article with GIF that shows some scrolling tests http://blog.christoffer.me/six-things-i-learnt-about-ios-safaris-rubber-band-scrolling/\nI could solve this problem only by using iScroll http://iscrolljs.com/ I had to add it to the off-canvas.. Had the same problem with AngularJS. The solution is to remove the modal from DOM manually.. The example above doesn't work anymore, because UIKit 3 is released, so some links don't work. Fixed example is here http://codepen.io/rampen/pen/MJmqmw. Almost one year passed since this question. Still the documentation of UIKit lacks this information. Thank you for posting your findings here.\n. I'm not sure if it's a bug, but I faced a similar problem. In my case I need to destroy the modals manually, i.e. remove them from HTML DOM. If I use modal.hide() then the modal is not removed from the DOM. I need to call modal.$destroy(true) manually. If I use destroy in the hide event, then the uk-modal-page class is not removed. Adding a timeout helps to avoid this issue. Tested for UIKit 3.0.0-RC2\nExample is in JSBin.. @janschoenherr  Thank you, I did. Code which does not work (uk-modal-page stays visible, but the dialog hides itself correctly and is removed from DOM):\n```\nfunction displayModalDialog(content, center) {\n    var cssClass = \"uk-modal-dialog\";\n    if ((typeof center !== 'undefined') && (center))\n        cssClass += \" uk-margin-auto-vertical\";\n    var dialog = UIkit.modal(\"\" +\n        \"\" + content + \"\" + \"\",\n        {\n            'escClose': false,\n            'bgClose': false\n        });\nUIkit.util.on(dialog.$el, 'hidden', function (ref) {\n        dialog.$destroy(true);\n });\ndialog.show();\n\nreturn dialog;\n\n}\n```\nIf I add setTimeout, then it works much better and the uk-modal-page is removed:\n```\nfunction displayModalDialog(content, center) {\n    var cssClass = \"uk-modal-dialog\";\n    if ((typeof center !== 'undefined') && (center))\n        cssClass += \" uk-margin-auto-vertical\";\n    var dialog = UIkit.modal(\"\" +\n        \"\" + content + \"\" + \"\",\n        {\n            'escClose': false,\n            'bgClose': false\n        });\nUIkit.util.on(dialog.$el, 'hidden', function (ref) {\n    //We must set a timeout, otherwise the scrolling can break because the CSS classes are not removed\n    //correctly - https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/2651\n    setTimeout(function () {\n        dialog.$destroy(true);\n    }, 1000);\n});\ndialog.show();\n\nreturn dialog;\n\n}\n```\nWhat am I doing wrong?.

Needs reproduction link. By default there is no mime type filtering in the upload component.. I believe this is fixed in the develop branch. Can you confirm?. After revisiting this issue. You'll have to set the documents dir attribute. For UIkit it doesn't suffice to set the direction via css.\n\nIt seems to be the recommended way: https://stackoverflow.com/a/5375907.

You could start with this template: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/XMpryM. This should be resolved in beta 21. Thanks.. For VueJs there is a nice workaround by using letting Vue itself set the attribute:\n\nThere is most likely something similar for RiotJS?\nOther than that, UIkit supports the attribute uk-no-boot which will prevent the automatic booting on this element and below.. Resolved the JS approach with fa81fee8cf396012805a4c139e891a7d858454fb. This should be resolved in beta 21. Thanks.. Has this been resolved? If not, please add a reproduction link..

I leave this open for debate, but currently. The Toggle component toggles a target. While the Dropdown component itself is the target that is being toggled by its toggle.. The Video component supports play/pause video as it enters/leaves the viewport. \n\n5fc8f223d8fc9e9ba863cdb5b1f6a349ca8ac824. This seems to be happening on the benj section. Could you try to separate all of the flex, scrollspy, grid action a bit. Maybe a use an additional wrapper div?. Is this still an issue with the latest Beta 34 release?. The JavaScript part of the grid component applies margins between rows, whenever the grid starts to stack and also adds a class to the first column of a grid.. Only cells below the first row will get a top margin applied. We haven't found a good non JS solution for that.\nThe documentation should be more precise about that..

I believe this has been resolved in Beta 34.. We will start working on this in a little while.. Currently there is not. Can't give you an estimate as to when or even if there will be one in the nearer future.. There shouldn't be a tests folder in the UIkit dist download.

Discussion continues on #2955 \n. Not sure if we will work around this issue. We are using querySelector now and those accept valid CSS selectors only.. Is this a function you are calling from custom code? It does not seem to be part of UIkit in Beta 31. The beforeSend callback gets an env object. Attached to that is the xhr. \nenv.hxr\nThis has probably been different before Beta 31.. Thanks, resolved with c636f10d44af0efda0bc79b4d40e197c0a291e12.

You are trying to position the dropdown at true-center which is invalid and defaults to center-center.\nPos is the primary option for the Dropdown component: https://getuikit.com/docs/javascript#component-configuration. Internally UIkit would be looking for a tag with the name true.\nAs an alternative you could use the value you've put into the href attribute..

You'll have to give the slideshow div a width or remove the uk-width-auto class.\nCurrently the slideshow will close the modal after dragging, this is resolved with 6ad630aaec17b83496d80703a6a942531fa47a24. That is currently intended behavior. Setting the containeroption to false will prevent this behavior in the next version. . Please ask questions like these in our Gitter Channel. You need to check for the event target. In UIkit 3 togglable components fire beforeshow, show, shown, beforehide, hide and hidden events.\nThe tab component initially fires the show events, true. That is also intended, you might want to react on the initial state too.. Duplicate of #2809. \nDocs are fixed: uikit/uikit-site@adc6572b4492638dcae18340f77f8e1ad4414f32 and 7e95507eb6a2dfcdd13c1253920c91d9ef48239a.

Would you update the docs?. There is also an index property on the slideshow instance itself.\n\nUIkit.getComponent($0, 'slideshow').index;. That is currently not possible. To prevent scrolling the body, it is shrunk to the viewport height. That'll in turn mess with the sticky component.\nWe haven't found a better way (consistent across browsers and systems) to prevent scrolling..

You can do this already by adding a callback for beforeSend(env)\n\nbeforeSend(env) {\n    env.headers = myHeaders;\n}\nI will update the docs to reflect that.. Both UIkit and Video.js utilize a custom DOM event called tap. UIkit triggers the tap event accommodating each mouseup, pointerup and touchend event to unify those across environments (Based on zepto.js). \nVideo.js now receives a tap immediately succeeded by a click event, though starting and pausing the video in one go.\nI don't think there is much we can do about this. . If you defaultPrevent the beforehide event, the Offcanvas will not close.. For that you can use the bg-close option. I've just updated the docs:\nhttps://getuikit.com/docs/offcanvas#component-options. Yes, you need to check for the event target to determine what tries to show/hide itself. \nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/target\nFor consistency most components that show/hide trigger the same events.. I believe this has been resolved with d875a1e53b902b127aa770cb8e2d916d1e88363b. Thanks.. This should be resolved with 2a72dcef2a33da6fe45a4c63e17002c7fe760f77. Could someone setup a codepen? Thanks..

What Android version is that?. That is the same issue as with the icons. UIkit is manipulating the DOM (removing the title attribute) prior to Vue reading its template from the DOM. If you prepend the title with a colon you should be fine.\n:title=\"mytitle\". Please try\n\nuk-tooltip=\"title: my title text\". As a workaround, you can use:\n\nuk-scrollspy=\"offset-top: -1\". Does the above commit resolve your issue?. Thanks, this is available in 3.0.0-dev.e02d1d6 now.. Thanks, fixed with uikit/uikit-site@805c5707f05188659844e809adad2d9ba23ceafe. Seems to be fixed?. Yes, it was fixed with b7bc40f. Please initialize you component like this:\n\nuk-tooltip=\"title: Hello World\"\n\nI will update the docs accordingly. Thanks.. If you don't want UIkit to append the modal to the body of the document, set the Modal's container option to false. Good call Miljan, we'll probably abide to these rules:\nhttps://github.com/airbnb/javascript#variables. That was fun 7fc1e52328f318a9dd13e56a51f952615c47d075 :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:. Please add a codepen with your setup, so that we can inspect the issue. If you want the modal to remain in place, you can simply set container: false\nuk-modal=\"container: false\"\n\nThe reason to move the modal to the UIkit container/body by default is, so that one does not get nested forms.. Has been resolved this morning. Thanks.. Use uk-tab-item. We'll have to add a note to the docs.. I believe this to be an issue with codepen, as it injects your custom Javascript in the footer of the document. By the time of its evaluation, UIkit components are already instantiated. If you do this in the head of the document, you should be fine.. Could you please add a codepen. Not sure how to reproduce the issue.. This is happening only, if there are just two slides, right?. Could you test with the latest develop branch? It should be fixed now.. Could you give https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/8fcf696d776f3e8fcf74ad97226f85642ee3fdd5 another try, please?. Yes, currently, interacting with the Slideshow will stop the autoplay.. You need to check for the event target. \nYour code listens for a hide event. Both drop and modal trigger a hide event.\n```\n$(function() {\n$(\"#modal-example\").on({\n'hide.uk.modal': function(){\n$('#modal-example').html(\" \");\n}     \n});\n\n});\n```\nAlso, UIkit events are no longer suffixed.. Use container: false\nuk-modal=\"container: false\"\n\nhttps://getuikit.com/docs/modal#component-options. Currently clsPanel is just a selector and should be named selPanel. It does not apply any classes at the moment.. You can, just call UIkit.icon.add(YourIcons) from your JS file.. Thanks, fixed.. https://getuikit.com/docs/accordion#component-options\ncollapsible: false. Seems to work fine with the official UIkit release\nhttps://codepen.io/janschoenherr/pen/xYmjae. That is actually intended behavior. Two things are happening here. \nThe infinite mode is automatically disabled, as soon as the slides aren't covering enough space to scroll infinite (Unlike other sliders we are not cloning DOM elements). \nIn finite mode the slides do center the slide, that's why there is white space left of the first slide.. You are attaching the scroll component to the target. Currently there is no utility function for smooth scrolling.\nhttps://getuikit.com/docs/scroll. Resolved with 35a952d809eb2cd64093eb26dd3c991c56ee41b5. Simply space separate the event names.. UIkit reacts to the whole page being RTL. There currently is no setting that makes the slider or slideshow behave in RTL mode separately.. Resolved with 91499d0a22ce3a10c85532236e87f43467013b9c. Please don't use the data-type=\"iframe\" for videos.\nhttps://getuikit.com/docs/lightbox#content-sources. Is this about the extra params passed to the Vimeo url? Yes, UIkit's URL matching needs to be smarter here.. Please checkout https://getuikit.com/assets/uikit/tests/sticky-navbar.html\nThis seems to be a usage question.

I think the viewbox dimensions are a fallback. Could you please provide a reproduction link? Thanks.. It gets converted from autoplay-interval to autoplayInterval on component initialization.\n\nIf you want to use UIkit programmatically, check out these docs: https://getuikit.com/docs/javascript#programmatic-use. Could you elaborate? Why do you need that?. The \"easy\" solution to this is to use Vue's bind directive. We are working on having something better in the foreseeable future.\n<span :uk-icon=\"heart\"></span>. How would you prefer to react to the _cancel_?. Unfortunately that's not how promises work. For now you'll have to handle both cases.. Hi,\n\nthere is no data-type option, that I know of. You can set the responseType to 'json'\n    beforeSend: function(env) {\n\n        env.responseType = 'json';\n\n    }\n\nThat will not throw the error though.. Thanks, you are right, it should be fixed now.. There is currently no way to prevent this behavior. The Offcanvas gets a fixed height when active to prevent scrolling on mobile. That causes the issues with the sticky navbar.. We are currently not actively working on that, but we do have it in mind, then we stumble upon a better implementation or another solution comes up.. That's the idea, you listen for the itemload event and then call the setItem method of the LightboxPanel component from the event handler.\nUIkit.util.on(document, 'itemload', '.uk-lightbox', function (e, item) {\n    if (item.type === 'vue-pdf') {\n        UIkit.lightboxPanel(e.target).setItem(item, '<my-markup>');\n    }\n}. You'll have to set the regex flavor to Javascript.\n\nI will change it with the next release to not use [^]. Thanks, this is resolved in the development branch.. Please check out https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events#Bubbling_and_capturing_explained\nBoth, modal and switcher trigger the same events, you'll have to check for the event target.. This should be fixed with 85f071270dbe6eeea5236650dff9a05fa9e6f6ba. I believe return false is used by jQuery.\nUIkit 3 no longer uses jQuery. You'll now have to defaultPrevent the event.\ndropdown.addEventListener('beforehide', function (e) {\n  e.preventDefault();\n});. Fixed with 03680270919c29d997350e5f68ea278b6dafb852\nWe'll release an update soon. Thanks, fixed with 03680270919c29d997350e5f68ea278b6dafb852. There were a couple of issues with Height Match. I hope 2a72dcef2a33da6fe45a4c63e17002c7fe760f77 fixes those.. What version of UIkit is that stack trace from?. Is this still an issue with the latest UIkit version?. For now, the easiest workaround would be to use Vue's v-bind directive:\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/t75vumcr/\nI am closing this issue as it has come up multiple times and we are aware of the situation.. Yes, the center option is currently not supported for 3 items. This is due to how and when the reordering is happening at the beginning of the \"switch\". The \"missing\" slide is actually sorted to the left of the active slide, because part of it is visible at the beginning of the transition.. This seems to be a usage question.

Okay, I see that it misbehaves. However, it would be great if you could provide a minimal codepen example. e.g. a site with just the offcanvas and as few additional scripts as possible. Thanks.. Thanks @KobuKovu It actually seems to be working fine for me - I couldn't find the button \"Toggle device toolbar\" though. I simply resized the browser window. \n\n. Thanks!. Resolved with dd75ce6b5ab143b7aa586238d1c6f7f0fb7bf6e1. Duplicate https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/3380. Duplicate #3380. You could you use a selector like [uk-img][src^=\"http\"]. Please use UIkit.components.dropdown.options.data.animation instead.\nThe docs will be updated with uikit/uikit-site@3eeeebb3c25934e43b5327656502f1a9604da87a.. Thanks, I've updated the docs: uikit/uikit-site@bcbf9d1fca045d2ee0cc95d5b623fe803a748381. This might happen when Vue \"redraws\" the DOM. If you let Vue set classes on an element and UIkit does too, those classes, set by UIkit, will be reset by Vue. Calling UIkit.update might solve this in some cases or setting e.g. the uk-grid manually.\nWe are aware of the issue and are working on a better solution.. Thanks, this has been fixed with: 3422862c39f8ba5b1606afec1000b2d3134dd2e0. > Important: this issue only happens in a NEW browser page, that is for the \"very first time\". When a browser page which has already succesfully displayed the images is used, then the images do show up as expected.\nThat is happening because UIkit stores information about the image probably being in the cache in the session storage.. Grid Parallax has been merged into the Grid component and no longer exists standalone.. Fixed in rc4. Thanks.. Fixed in rc4. Thanks.. Fixed in rc4. Thanks.. Fixed in rc4. Thanks..

Unfortunately, I had to revert the fix as it prevented the Masonry Grid from \"shrinking\". Do you have to set an inline style on exactly that element? How about setting min/max-height?. Unfortunately, I had to revert the fix as it prevented the Masonry Grid from \"shrinking\". Do you have to set an inline style on exactly that element? How about setting min/max-height?. Yes, but can't you wrap the sortable like this?\n<div class=\"uk-overflow-auto\" style=\"height: 200px\">\n    <ul uk-sortable></ul>\n</div>. Yes, but can't you wrap the sortable like this?\n<div class=\"uk-overflow-auto\" style=\"height: 200px\">\n    <ul uk-sortable></ul>\n</div>. There's a property on the component index.\nUIkit.slider(element).index. Thanks for your feedback. With UIkit 3.0.3 we started using IntersectionObservers. The crawler no longer needs to scroll.\n\nAccording to these two links, this is what Goggle recommends:\nhttps://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/lazy-loading\nhttps://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/lazy-loading-guidance/images-and-video/. This has been fixed with 7fa2039a9cdb239b5b365d1d923d4a4235268eee and will be released with the next update.. This should only select the adjacent one:\n<ul class=\"uk-subnav uk-subnav-pill\" uk-switcher=\"connect: +.uk-switcher\">. There is a separate section on \"Programmatic Use\" in the docs: https://getuikit.com/docs/javascript#programmatic-use. Yes, that's true. Could you open a separate issue at https://github.com/uikit/uikit-site/issues? Thanks.. Fixed with 866b0e3d95a07c0079ee199dc639c13d9f961554\n\nYou can pull the latest dev version from https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/uikit@dev. Thanks, fixed in rc8.. This seems to be happening within the iframe only.. Yes, this is on our todo list. That said, I can give no time frame for this.. Thanks, this is available in 3.0.0-dev.e02d1d6 now.. Sorry, cannot reproduce the issue. In both of your examples the navigation is hidden for me.. Thanks, I can reproduce the issue in FF.. Fixed with 185749af9fb7e731ba66bec8676b9bda672d35d8. I believe, that would be quite tricky. Is it possible to solve this with other markup?. Yes, we need to update the documentation.\nUIkit.component('sticky', UIkit.component('sticky').extend({\n    data: {\n        offset: 50\n    }\n}));. Yes, that's buggy at the moment.\nfunction destroy() {\n    UIkit.offcanvas('#offcanvas').hide().then(function () {UIkit.offcanvas('#offcanvas').$destroy(true)});\n}\n\nThis is probably not the workaround you are looking for, as the hiding animation needs to finish first.. I believe this to be fixed. Please comment if not.. Your reproduction link seems to be broken.. It seems to work fine here: https://getuikit.com/docs/navbar#dropbar\nYou are having custom styling applied\n style=\"position: relative; z-index: 980;\"\n\nAfter removing that, it works fine too.. Currently the parallax and masonry grid supports \"column\" layouts only. That means that all child items need to be the same width.. Thanks, resolved with 5ad623fd9f9d79fa3e42995860fd5832fd552b83. Thanks!.     I'm broken\nor \n<div uk-tooltip data-title=\"broken tooltip :\">I'm broken</div>. Try clearing the browser cache. There has been an issue in the past and that has since been resolved.. You can test the fix with the latest dev build: 3.0.0-dev.22ec208. Add `mode:click` to the _uk-drop_ components. The SVG component removes the SVG element from the DOM the moment it is disconnected from the DOM and adds a new SVG element once it's connected again. Changes done to the element manually are lost.\n\nYou could use CSS to achieve the result you want though:\n[data-color=\"green\"] svg * {stroke: green}\n\n. Thanks, fixed with rc 14. Most components fire the same events - the events then bubble up the DOM. Yes, you'll need to check for the event target to determine what is firing beforeshow etc.. You can use VueJS's v-bind directive:\n:uk-icon=\"info\"\n\nThat'll prevent the icon from rendering twice..     :uk-spinner. Please add the uk-offcanvas-contentclass: https://getuikit.com/docs/offcanvas. This should be fixed in 3.0.0-dev.894b245\nAs a workaround, you can set the ratio: false option.. This has been fixed in rc.17.\nThere are two issues with your codepen though. Firstly the JS code is executed too late. By then, the tooltip has already been initialized. You'd have to reinitialize the tooltip. Secondly, the animation property needs to be an Array.. It seems to work fine for me on iOS 9.3.. The infinite mode is automatically disabled, as soon as the slides aren't covering enough space to scroll infinite (Unlike other sliders we are not cloning DOM elements).. UIkit tries to determine if an image is already cached or not. It does that by storing information about loaded images in the sessionStorage. If you clear the browser's cache, it will not clear the sessionStorage. In that case UIkit still thinks the image is cached and therefore does not use a placeholder.\nCalling sessionStorage.clear() will clear that Storage.. I understand the problem you are facing. I am just not sure what to do about it. I wonder why - if cached - the images do not load right away? However, i will further investigate and try to come up with a better solution.. @TomS- not intentionally. It could behave a bit differently though, as the update system has seen some changes.\nGreat that it seems to be fixed though :-). Resolved in develop version.. UIkit.util.on(lightbox.$el, 'hide', function() {\n    alert('hello');\n})\nor more generic\nUIkit.util.on(document, 'hide', '.uk-lightbox', function() {\n    alert('hello');\n}). None of the snippets above?. We are using the yarn.lock file for this. Thanks.. This seems to be fixed with 3.0.0-dev.f1300ce\n. Please make sure to check the event target. Both, modal and tab fire hide / show events.\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/target. This is most likely already fixed in the dev version.

This is intentional. The scrollbar gets pushed too.. That is most likely not going to work. The transform makes the body act as the sticky's containing block instead of the viewport.\n\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position#fixed. I believe it takes a little while for CDNJS to update.. Thanks, should be fixed in rc 22.. Currently that is \"intended\" behavior. The navbar acts as the dropdowns boundary. The dropdown can't open to the left because it would cross the left boundary. Therefore it falls back to its default (opening to the right). \nIf you add few more nav items left of the parent, it will work as expected.\nWe might need improve that behavior.. This has been fixed with rc 23. Thanks.. You got the quotes messed up. \ndata-ng-class=\"{invisible: invisible}\"\n\nwill fix your issue.

Thanks, the options are now shown in the `Component options` section.. I'd say you are probably in the wrong repository. This is http://getuikit.com. I can't reproduce this issue. However, if the element behaves normally, e.g. fades in, it might be that your event listener hasn't been attached at the time the event is triggered?. @hoppingmadZH this should be resolved with the latest dev version. Thanks.. This issue is similar to the \"duplicate icons\". UIkit applies the `uk-active` class before Vue takes the `app` out of the DOM. For Vue, the markup looks like this:\n\n<li v-for=\"tab in tabs\" class=\"uk-active\">\n\nYou can easily solve this by using Vue's bind directive: https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#v-bind\n<ul class=\"uk-child-width-expand\" :uk-tab=\"''\">. Thanks, it is fixed in the develop release.. Thanks, this has been fixed on getuikit.com.. Setting the `animation` option to `false` seems to improve the issue a little bit. However, we'll have to take a closer look at the issue.\n\nPlease also take a look at: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/2892. With the next version, you'll be able to set ratio to false, which will prevent the Slideshow and Height-Viewport component from competing with each other.. Is this resolved with 3.0.3?. As a workaround, you can use the toggle option, to define what areas should be clickable. With the next release, the default selector will be > * > :first-child. https://codepen.io/anon/pen/NeeeNN\nor with version 3.0.0\nhttps://codepen.io/anon/pen/qLLLNM. That seems to be working fine for me. Do you have a reproduction link?. Does it work if you delay the UIkit.modal('#hpc-check').show(); with a setTimeout? Or calling it manually after page load?. iOs seems to ignore the element.focus() call as long as it is not directly triggered through a click event handler.. The code snippet is working fine for me. There might be something else interfering?. This should be fixed in 3.0.3. It's not valid JSON, use e.g.: uk-offcanvas='{\"mode\":\"push\", \"overlay\":true, \"flip\": true}'. The problem here seems to be, that codepen inserts the javascript at the bottom of the page. By the time it gets executed, UIkit has already initialized its components.. Yes, you'd have to do your own UIkit build, if you'd want to defer UIkit and change the global options.. Thanks, fixed with 65541ba5790aee618d92e19bca3269fc889fb492. Thanks, fixed with e9a07e6182d024b597028545f62375baa01268a5. Did you build the JS after using the code from develop branch? You can also pull the latest dev release from npm.

Yes, we already use that. It works fine for videos with the `<video>` tag. But it seems to no longer work for iframe embedded videos.. You'll need to apply the `delay-show` to the custom `Drop` components too.. This can already be achieved by giving the button the `autofocus` attribute.\n\nWe'll update the tests and docs. Thanks..

Yes I know that, thanks. But isn't it strange having multiple offcanvas menu for top and bottom menus?\nAs a workaround, using helper classes like \"uk-display-small-inline-block\"  and \"uk-display-medium-inline\" (etc), so one could easily solve this. Unfortunately no such classes are available.\n. For example (untested):\n``` javascript\n// initialize\nvar myGrid = UIkit.grid($('#mySelector'));\n$(\"#myTextbox\").keyup(function(){\n// get user entered text\nvar textinput = $('#myTextbox').val();\n\n// filter grid items\nmyGrid.filter(textinput);\n\n});\n```\n. I don't see a way it is possible currently. As a workaround you could build an array of all your available filters and check user entered text against it. Then filter the grid with the matched elements.\nBut perhaps someone can suggest a smarter solution.\n. +1\n. ",

An option to \"trash\" every change uikit made to the cached page with javascript would fix the issue, at least for turbolinks5 since we can trigger that clean up on the before-cache event.\nfor now my solution with turbolinks5 is this\ndocument.addEventListener('turbolinks:load', function() {\n    Turbolinks.clearCache();\n});\nno cache, but in my case is fine since the pages are cached in the server, still getting jumps on stuff with margin added with javascript tho (like grids) but 0 duplicates. well, not in the windows version of chrome then :p. https://getuikit.com/docs/introduction#html-markup without this:\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">\nuikit doesnt work on phones/tablets. it's really needed.

I am going to let you have it just a bit, and I will still blame in fully on my lack of sleep.\nI am fully aware of what bower is, its purposes of injecting those dependencies to an asset builder of choice... to compile, appropriately flush through gulp... may I go on? \nI develop on the front end with gulp, bower, bedrock... and all the other great node modules that they come with. News flash, women have the ability to be just as kurt towards men who believe we know nothing.\nSecondly, CLONING SOUNDS WIERD TO ME? Man, was that not a sorrry attempt at trying to look superior. And finally I DO NOT WANT the simple css files - as I build use LESS to build my stylesheets  and then use wiredep to minify them. Why would I want to waste so much time?\nMy questions are simple, and I do not appreciate what I took as very sexist remarks. Additionally, I like to take advantage of the AngularUI instead of having to bloat my docs with so many unnecessary js files. SO - with that being said, I will just figure it out myself. Which I am very capable of... but as I stated, very sleep deprived and was hoping for some help that wasn't so... snooty.\n.

Because it's exhausting really. Not that the package isn't great. However. - G'night!\n. Ok - last one I promise, but I also am not sold on the idea of having to install all of those modules deeper into my project when I have already done that in my project dev which also uses gulp to manage those dependencies so it just looks like its going to take some customization  on my part to minify the docs way down. \n. k... well since you are the ONLY one out there... have you had the trouble of running the bower install uikit --save and its returning with bower no-json       No bower.json file to save to, use bower init to create one\nuikit#2.20.3 bower_components/uikit\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 jquery#2.1.4\n.

I'm a big fan of uikit and I'd love to contribute. :smile_cat: \n. @saschadube I don't mean to be a pain, I really like UIKit but get the general feeling that the team is ignoring a lot of the incoming suggestions and needed fixes from developers.

Making them separate bars would just make it harder to gauge overall progress, unless you had yet another bar to track that.\n. Also, Bootstrap supports this.\n. I'd also be curious about this.

Not sure what to do about the animation transition, but I found the answer to toggling autoplay in another issue: #1263\n. @ZeGregg: That helps for controlling initialization time, but it doesn't help if you need to add more elements after you've already initialized.

In poking at the return value of UIkit.accordion(), it seems that the correct solution is to call .update() on that returned object. This should really be documented somewhere; I haven't found any mentions of what to do with the return value of any UIkit.*() function call.

    "luxlogica": "I think this is a more serious issue in the latest version of UIKit, on Safari desktop: when a full-screen slideshow is using Ken Burns, even if just the default fade effect is being used, the slides have a 'pause' of about 20 seconds after loading for the first time. So, it happens like this:\n1. page opens, slideshow opens with first slide, and ken burns effect animates nicely.\n2. when ken burns effect finishes, the slide image 'reloads', and stays fixed on screen for about 20 seconds - no animation.\n3. the next slide starts playing, with ken burns animation going nicely. \n4. as the animation finishes, it reloads the image and displays it statically with no animation for about 20 seconds, again.\n5. the same thing happens to every slide, as it is being shown the first time.\n6. once all slides have been shown once, then it starts again from the beginning, but this time it plays nicely all the way through - no more 20-sec pauses.\nThis seems doesn't happen in Firefox, but happens reliably in Safari, every time.\n. Ok, I checked and noticed that I was (unnecessarily) loading the 'slideshow-fx.js' file in my <head>. Removing it helped a lot. There still seems to be a glitch - the slides pause for an unusually long time after the animation - but at least they don't reload, so it's acceptable. But the 'slideshow-fx.js' file seems to be definitely causing some issue with Safari.\n. Perhaps switching to using Velocity.js, as suggested in this issue, would provide more flexibility, as well as better performance. \n. BTW: in regards to item 2) above, what I currently do to configure a new, 'basic' default set of fonts, is to redefine the following variables in my _base.less file:\nless\n@base-body-font-family: \"My New Body Font\", Arial, sans-serif;\n@base-heading-font-family: \"My New Heading Font\", Arial, sans-serif;\n@base-code-font-family: \"My New Monospaced Font\", Courier, serif;\n@navbar-nav-font-family: \"My New Navbar Font\", Arial, sans-serif;\nThese variables are based on the output of the Customiser - these are the fonts the Customiser allows you to change, in 'Advanced' mode... Am I covering everything with these, or are there other variables I should be changing?...\nMany thanks in advance for any guidance.\n. is this the official recommendation from UIKit for users who wish to use Google fonts? - that it's easier to go and build a whole new theme, or a whole new customizer? That doesn't sound very encouraging. \n. Shouldn't this issue remain opened, until it's resolved? - this way others users will know you're aware of the issue, and won't file it again. Closing it may seem like you've decided not to resolve it. \n. If you want an element that is \"on-canvas\" (on the screen) all the time, then you don't really need an \"off-canvas\"! It may be simpler to just use a fixed-position div, and then style it. \n. Velocity.js enables us to do more with less coding: instead of having to use several jQuery plugins and third-party libraries, all the animations could be done using just Velocity.js. In this sense, Velocity is the 'lightweight' option. ;-)\n. @nblackburn Just like a UIKit user doesn't have to know jQuery - or any of its plugins - in order to use UIKit, they also wouldn't have to know Vue.\nLook at the first example I gave above, for the modal. It shows what the current syntax is for implementing a modal in UIKit, and what the syntax would be if UIKit used Vue under-the-hood. AFAIK there is no UI framework that makes it this easy for a developer, so this could be a great boost to UIKit.\nBut the advantages of Vue don't stop there. If you're offering to help me with Vue, you've probably already checked it out, so you know that it has its own Transition implementation for animations, as well as two-way data binding - extremely useful for forms. Vue might help simplify and speed up some of UIKit's code, making it easier for the team to maintain. And if its code is easy to maintain, it opens up even more possibilites for UIKit: the UIKit team would feel that it's easier to add more features to existing elements, as well as come up with new elements - all with a syntax that would be much simpler, easier to remember, and less prone to error for the end-user.\n. @nblackburn I do apologise, but I'm not really getting your point. You seem to be saying, that if UIKit were to start using Vue under-the-hood, then UIKit users (web developers using UIKit) would also need to learn Vue, and Vue's templating language. That is just not true.\nIf what you're saying, is that they'd have to learn a new syntax for using UIKit's elements - a simpler syntax that you'd have control over - then yes, I agree there: that is the whole point. A web developer getting started with UIKit right now already has to learn a \"syntax\" of sorts (every 'recipe' for using a core element or component is a 'syntax' that has to be learned), and that syntax is often nested in multiple levels, complex, full of caveats and prone to errors. It could be greatly simplified using Vue - meaning that there would be less syntax for newbies to learn.\n\nI honestly get your excitement for Vue but when building a frontend framework, you need to design things in a way that works for everyone.\n\nI totally agree: the more approachable we can make UIKit to newcomers, the wider an audience it can have.\n. @nblackburn just like you have the freedom to choose to use jQuery - and tell your users to include it in their project along with UIKit - you also have the freedom to use Vue. Just like the end-user does not have to know anything about jQuery now, then wouldn't have to know (or use) anything about Vue.\nThe ones who have to know and use Vue are the UIKit team - and it seems they are already doing it! \nYay!\n. That can possibly already be accomplished manually with Flex.\nI really would like to see something closer to - or perhaps even simpler/easier to use than - the Tiles in Bulma, or ideally, a complete, responsive, flex-based dynamic auto-layout engine, like Shuffle.js.. You can also look at Shuffle.js in the meantime.. Configuration should also extend to being able to change the colour of the icon, as described in Issue #2710 .. @saschadube This is very useful to know! It might be a good idea to add it to the docs.\nNow, is there already a way to change the actual icon? - that is what this issue was about originally. If there is, it's not clear in the docs - or perhaps it is, and I've missed it.... @ratiofu IMHO, the Container component is not really meant to be used as a generic device for centering blocks of content anywhere in your layout. You can actually just use the flex component for that - a container is not needed at all.\nThe container is meant to be used inside a <section> element, as the top-level container of the overall layout content of your page. If you want, you could place a Flex component inside a container - e.g., if you wanted to equally spread items in a gallery image across the entire width of the container, which will automatically change at different breakpoints. \nBut placing a container inside a flex is probably not intended usage, and this is likely why you're experiencing issues.\n. @saschadube it helps a lot! Is there a way to add it to the docs? . @saschadube How about implementing it as an 'optional plugin' - like the 'components' were in v2?.... It is possible to override the animation with a .hook-modal-dialog(), but you then have to specify the animation 'manually', from scratch, overriding the pre-defined transform that the modal dialog uses. Using the hook, UIkit also does an 'out' animation in reverse by default. For example, to change the animation so we get a 'slide-left' that is longer than the default animation, we could use:\nless\n.hook-modal-dialog() {\n  transform: translateY(0px) translateX(-300px);\n  transition: 0.8s ease-out;\n} \nIt's not difficult, but it's cumbersome, and it would be infinitely better to be able to just 'plug-in' the animations from the Animation component.. I would also suggest having a look at the excellent Fontello Project.. ",

    "bbenne10": ":+1:\nThis is an extremely silly problem to continue to have. There are at least two other issues that bring this up, and no note in the documentation about this. The first was closed by simply saying \"compile again after changing the  variable that controls this\", which works but is EXTREMELY inflexible (what if I want different overlays on different types of things with different meanings?). The second answer is \"change the class that's generated after the less is compiled\", which is also a bad answer since the reason I'm using this framework is to minimize the amount of CSS I'm writing. If I wanted to do this by hand, I would. \nThere's no reason that this can't be simply solved by either adding !important to all .uk-icon-*'s content declarations, or (and I think this is a better solution) making it an error case to use uk-overlay-icon without also specifying an associated icon by also specifying uk-icon-*. This would mean that the content declaration could be removed from uk-overlay-icon and the controlling variable could be removed (provided it's not used anywhere else). This could be documented and all of us would be happy. \nWould a PR be accepted here? Provided I'm not missing something, I'll be happy to make the required changes and open one.\n. After having a look at the code, it does look like fixing this the second way (removing the default icon) is as simple as I thought. I'll go ahead and create a PR.\n. While I disagree that it's any more cumbersome to explicitly add the icon you want to use, this also works just fine. I'm not sure about performance of the attribute prefix selector, but I don't think that should be too much of a problem.

Appreciate it!\nI will add a fiddle tommorow (it's 5:30pm here), as I can't manage it today!\nYes, Paul Irishs Infinite Scroll is unmaintained and probably somewhat outdated, but it is, as far as I know, the only working solution so far or at least one of the few working ones. Especially when it comes to Tumblr, it is somewhat the standard and about 50 and more percent of the Thumblr themes are using it in combination with Masonry or Isotope.\nIt wouldn't be a problem to use masonry and UIKIT together with Infinite Scroll, but as UIKIT is coming with the Dynamic Grid, it would be good to have everything coming from one source. Also my personal experience is, that UIKITs Dynamic Grid is faster and less ressource hungry as masonry is. But that might just be me.\nThanks for your help so far!\n. That would be great, but I don't think, that I am able to adept it. I am mainly a frontend dev. I saw that example before, but it just repeats the list. For Tumblr you need some ajax-call to get the next page, and add the next items to the list.\nTumblr is using a pagination like this.\n{block:Pagination}<ul id=\"pagination\">\n        <li><a href=\"{PreviousPage}\"></a></li>\n        {/block:PreviousPage}\n        {block:JumpPagination length=\"5\"}\n        {block:CurrentPage}\n        <li><span class=\"current_page numbersNav\"><strong>{PageNumber}</strong></span></li>\n        {/block:CurrentPage}\n        {block:JumpPage}\n        <li><a class=\"jump_page numbersNav\" href=\"{URL}\">{PageNumber}</a></li>\n        {/block:JumpPage}\n        {/block:JumpPagination}\n        {block:NextPage}\n        <li><a id=\"nextPage\" href=\"{NextPage}\"></a></li>\n        {/block:NextPage}\n        </ul>{/block:Pagination}\nWith Infinite Scroll you do somethink like this:\n$(window).load(function () {\n        var $content = $('.maingrid');\n        $content.infinitescroll({\n              navSelector    : '#pagination',  \n              nextSelector   : '#pagination a#nextPage',\n              itemSelector   : '.item_container, .loading',\n              loading: {\n                finished: undefined,\n                finishedMsg: \"<em>Congratulations, you've reached the end of the internet.</em>\",\n                img: null,\n                msg: null,\n                msgText: \"\",\n                selector: null,\n                speed: 'fast',\n                start: undefined\n              },\n              bufferPx       : 200,\n              debug          : true,\n        });\n        });\nI am sure, from what I saw, It would be possible with Scrollspy, but as I said for me it is too hard to adept. Although I don't expect anyone to do my work, I thought, that maybe someone is having a working example.\n. I decided to stick with Masonry and Infinite Scroll for the moment. The scripts are the same in size as the ones from UIKIT and as I don't know how to adapt Scrollspy with Tumblrs pagination, nor I know how to use Infinite Scroll with UIKITs Dynamic Grid, I think it's best to stick with the one I know.\nI want to thank you for your help so far. I I come up with a solution at any time, I will add it here. Until then I'll close this issue.\n. Noone there, who is able to tell me what I am doing wrong or if this is by purpose?\n. ",

Ah I didn't realise this, thanks!\nI think then it's making this more granular - the main tasks they'd be handy for is mobile landscape / portrait and tablet landscape / portrait, in which the resolution jumps are relatively small but space is at a premium, and gutters on a portrait phone should ideally be smaller than a landscape tablet.. I do agree on bloat and I'm glad Uikit is as tightly constrained as it is for the most part, but not sure I agree on thins being a 'very specific use case' - having equal gutters on 375 x 667 and 1024 x 768 but being able to vary them between 1024 x 768 vs e.g. 1920 x 1080 seems like having priorities the wrong way round..

This is as per your own instructions on Yootheme. \ntheme_rightoffcanvasMenu.txt\nHere is the recording of what happens on my Iphone 6. \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/j7bwq88o79l4n3m/YooMoreno_RightOffcanvasMenuOnly.mp4?dl=0\nThe recording was generated using Reflector 2\nYou will notice that when on top of the page, the offcanvas slides over the navbar. As you scroll lower the behaviour becomes erratic, with the navbar moving partially across the screen under the moving offcanvas.

The offcanvas bar sometimes covers (depending on where one is situated on the page, it seems, sometimes moves the sticky navbar, which itself remains halfway across the screen).\n- Contrast this with the following observation : on Android devices (Chrome browser), the offcanvas and site canvas work like they do on the desktop, they both move synchronously and smoothly across the screen. \nGENERAL QUESTION: \nIs there a conceptual / philosophical reason why you want the main page canvas to be shifted when the offcanvas opens/closes? I do not understand the value of shifting the whole canvas. Looking at gmail and facebook apps online, it seems they keep the main page canvas fixed and allow the offcanvases to slide on top. \nI hope you can agree, the problem is real and requires attention. \nPlease let me know if you need further informations/clarifications \nKind regards \nGiacomo Bruzzo\n. Hi there\nthank you for your response. \nPremise: I am aware that Yoo_Moreno does not use the sticky component / does not call sticky.js, as, for example, Yoo_Eat does. \nGiven this premise, could you please clarify what you mean by \n\"Please note that the Moreno template does not utilize the UIkit sticky component. It is a custom implementation as the sticky component didn't exist when the template was developed.\"?\nAre you saying there is nothing you can do for Yoo_Moreno? \nI just checked the Yoo_Moreno download page on the YooTheme website, and the template for download is still v 1.0.14. (dated Jan 13, 2016). Has that been modified? \nPlease advise \nGiacomo Bruzzo\n. I tried using the modified sticky.js on our test Yoo_Eat site. \nIt kind of works, but is a very stodgy solution. The top navbar now behaves erratically in the desktop chrome browser. People will play around with their browser edge and the following behaviour would be grossly unacceptable: \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/tecs7ohmllcc7oj/Untitled%20Screencast.webm?dl=0 \nlook at how the top navbar breaks when moving the screen around! To me, it is a gross nono. \nHere is a suggestion\nAssume now you really need (for whatever reason) the whole site canvas to move \n You still could apply minor code changes to Uikit.js or sticky.js to add a class, say \"uk-active\" to the navbar when the show.offcanvas function is triggered, and add css so that on that event, the navbar vanishes. This way \n1. your main canvas is moving\n2. there is no navbar there to (but who cares, the main page is covered with an opaque layer now). \nyou then add an appropriate animation class when the hide.offcanvas function is triggered to make it reappear when the canvas closes. \nspecifically, this means that the code segment of uikit.js which I changed to  \no.css(a ? \"margin-right\" : \"margin-left\", (a ? -1 : 1) * 0).width()\nremains instead \no.css(a ? \"margin-right\" : \"margin-left\", (a ? -1 : 1) * (s.outerWidth()*l)).width()\nSee this video of how the desktop page is not affected anymore by the navbar being there \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/z8miyx3bss7ipzy/Untitled%20Screencast%20-%20vanish%20navbar.webm?dl=0\nPlease let me know your thoughts about this \nGiacomo Bruzzo\n.

If not in UIkit 2.x than at least in UIkit 3.x? Thanks \ud83d\ude09 \n. @jsieler Thank you for the reply and for the snippet.\nIn my particular case I do not need to add AJAX as I'm not pulling the data dynamically, it is not in a DB, not in array or anything.\nI'm generating the whole output at once, via Twig. In means that I already have all Grid elements available in the DOM. So I just need to handle it from the front-end.\nInstead of appending the elements (as in your example) I might just hide most of them and reveal them when the user clicks the button. And this is what I'll do if the UIKit guys refuse to implement this feature.\nBut since UIkit is a front-end framework, it will be really nice to have such JS option, such Data Attr (for example data-uk-grid=\"{items: 20}\") that will handle this in the front-end only. And since UIkit 3.x gets so many nice improvements like 3 different Offcanvas animations, universal Transitions component (that will replace the overlays), many nice little additions to the Navbar, improvements to the Tabs and Buttons styling, etc.... I really do not see any reason why this very nice addition to the Dynamic Grid component shouldn't be added as well.\n. @jsieler I know mate, everything can be done with few (or more) lines of code.\nOf course UIkit cannot (and should not) handle all possible scenarios. As a framework, it is the starting point, the backbone of a project and should be extended and customized for the specific needs by the user.\nThat being said, I do believe that my request is very reasonable and it will be a great addition to the framework.\nI do have a great respect for the Open Source projects, I am involved in few myself, therefore I very well understand that not everything can be implemented, that there are different priorities and that if you want something to get added the best way is to log a new PR and contribute to the project.\nI just want to see what the UIkit developers think about it and what's their take on this.\n.

FYI I use Angular 4 and Webpack 2 for the build.\nCreated the following service to return the window object and registered the service.\n```\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nfunction _window(): any {\n    return window;\n}\n@Injectable()\nexport class WindowService {\n    get nativeWindow(): any {\n        return _window();\n    }\n}\n```\nTo register ofcourse,\nstatic forRoot(moduleConfig: ModuleConfig): ModuleWithProviders {\n    return {\n        ngModule: SharedLibsModule,\n        providers: [WindowService]\n    };\n}\nIn my component where I want to inject UIkit and Icons,\n```\nimport { WindowService, UIKit, UIKitIcons } from '../../shared';\n@Component({\n    selector: '....',\n    templateUrl: '....'\n})\nexport class MainComponent implements OnInit {\n    constructor(private winRef: WindowService) {\n        winRef.nativeWindow.UIkit = UIKit;\n        UIKit.use(UIKitIcons);\n    }\n}\n```\nUnfortunately, one thing I wasn't able to do get going was import UIkit from 'uikit' but it might just be my webpack configuration.\nHence I had to do,\n```\ndeclare var UIkit: any;\ndeclare var Icons: any;\nexport const UIKit = UIkit;\nexport const UIKitIcons = Icons;\n```\nand webpack configuration,\nnew webpack.ProvidePlugin({\n    $: \"jquery\",\n    jQuery: \"jquery\",\n    UIkit: \"uikit\",\n    Icons: \"uikit/dist/js/uikit-icons\"\n})\nFor the purpose of writing up a solution I am not putting out a full example. But happy to answer any questions.. Perhaps if people think this is a good enough solution some official documentation is recommended to help others.. Have you seen https://getuikit.com/docs/inverse#customize-using-less ?. There is an existing request for this feature already.. ",

Or is that file there as a placeholder for when someone gets around to setting them up? \n. @miladmeidanshahi I think I wasn't clear about what kind of mixins I was hoping for, from what I gather you were trying to show me how you used bourbon mixins with that theme. \nBootstrap allows you to apply a mixin to your own css selectors. An example is instead of .col-md-3 you can use a mixin within your selector:\n/* SCSS example instead of .col-md-3 */\n.myClass{\n    @include make-md-column(3);\n}\nSCSS Extending doesn't work with uikit because of the heavy use of attribute selectors [class*=\"grid-width\"] etc.\nThe benefit being that I can write my html with more semantic classes and IDs.

    "EricJammin": "Hi, this is a very critical issue, can someone please take a look?\n. Hey Luetn,\nThe newest version of Chrome (v54.0.284.71), is only affected on older MacOS, like 10.9.5\nFor  MacOS 10.11 (El Capitan) or 10.12 (Sierra), the issue is resolved with the latest version of Chrome. I did however see the bug in the previous version of Chrome 53.0.2785\nIf you have access to a Windows machine, could you try with Edge or IE11?\n. Thanks, appreciate you looking into it.\nWe've been really thrilled with everything else UIkit has to offer, but the tabs are a central component to our app.\n. Hey all, checking in to see if there has been any progress on this issue? Or at least been able to identify the root cause of the issue? Thanks.\n. @GreenWisdom that's how I initially discovered the issue, loading a tab with a google map and going to drag the map. Then I realized this behavior would happen without a google map and was indeed a UIkit issue.\nHas anyone made any progress?. @GreenWisdom I first noticed in while testing a web app in Internet Explorer and Edge. Then I saw it on my older mac running OSX Mavericks using the latest Chrome build, and noticed it on my newer Mac running El Capitan with a slightly older version of Chrome. Updating to latest Chrome fixed it for me on my new Mac at the time, but now the problem is present again.\nSetting swiping: false is an interesting approach, good find! That would be a good solution for us since we wouldn't want the swipe ability even from touch screens as it would interfere with the google map dragging behavior.\nI'd still love to see this issue actually solved though, as a click + drag with the mouse should not be handled as a touch swipe.\n. @ambroisemaupate Are you using this with the tab structure?\nIf so, try using data-uk-tab instead of data-uk-switcher.

    "GreenWisdom": "I just started experiencing this issue.  I'm running OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 and have the latest version of Chrome installed.. In Google Chrome, when trying to pan a google map on a page that includes tabs, the tabs instantly change.  These issues did not previously exists for me, so I assume they are due to a recent chrome update.  Is anything being done to fix this issue?. @EricJammin It only started happening to me within the past couple of weeks (I assume due to a recent Chrome update), prior to that I was not experiencing the problem (been developing this app in one form or another since August using UIkit); but now its a major problem.  I see you initially created this issue back at the end of October; however, I wasn't experiencing anything like this then (and  Chrome has been set to auto update on my local machine).  Did this problem always exist for you or were your maps working correctly up to a point/chrome update?  . @EricJammin I reached out to a developer experienced with UIkit regarding this issue, and this was his response..\n\"About this \"issue\" regarding tabs. It's more like feature rather than issue and this feature was there since Jan 2015 https://github.com/uikit/uikit/commit/0e358929ba625ee376acbd46818594021624ce71\nOn default swipe event is set to true to enable swiping across tabs. Please check options for switcher component (tabs are using this component) https://getuikit.com/docs/switcher.html#javascript-options\nYou can set swiping option to false: swiping:false to disable swipe events.\nPlease check second tabs here http://codepen.io/anon/pen/rjawzB\"\nThis fixes the problem for me.  Let me know if it works for you.. @ambroisemaupate Does it work if you remove #node-source-form? I'm not familiar with nodesource, so this is perhaps a wild shot in the dark, but if it works when you remove it, can you include the node-source-form is a <div> inside a tab instead? . @EricJammin Thanks.  I agree, but at least this is a work around.  It seems like it would likely be easier to recreate the swipe feature correctly rather than trying to fix something that's obviously broken.. That codepen is not working in the slightest.  But to confirm, did you see my comment about how the issue does not exist if the browser window is at full screen from the beginning?  And that it only exists when the browser is made full screen after visiting the page in a browser window not at full screen?  I don't think this issue should be closed.. Thank for looking into this though.. I agree with you that its a chrome bug.  I meant to follow up with another comment saying so but forgot; my apologies.  Btw..did you get my email?\n.

Issue seems to be that uk-navbar should be used as class and not a custom html attribute....even though doc says you can.\nI agree with this as it is much cleaner to use classes. All these custom attribute alts are kinda messy. So in fixing the opening code:\n```\n\n\nLogo\n        <ul class=\"uk-navbar-nav\">\n            <li>\n                <a href=\"#\">\n                    <span class=\"uk-icon uk-margin-small-right\" href=\"#\" uk-icon=\"icon: star\"></span>\n                    Features\n                </a>\n            </li>\n        </ul>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"uk-navbar-right\">\n        <div class=\"uk-navbar-item\">\n            <form>\n                <input class=\"uk-input uk-form-width-small\" type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Input\">\n                <button class=\"uk-button uk-button-default\">Button</button>\n            </form>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</nav>\n\n```\nEDIT: As per @aarongerig's comment, not adding the custom attribute uk-navbar=\"\" will lead to other problems. But you definitely need to have uk-navbar as a class too.. @aarongerig ok editing previous comment. But Either way, the point is that the markup documentation for that page is wrong.\nuk-navbar needs to be added as a class to the div for this to work. The markup doc is different from what actually works.. @aarongerig I think a good number of people who use UIKit or do any kind of serious webapp dev today do so in some frontend framework e.g React, etc. In that space, for whatever reason, uk-navbar or other customs attrs do not always get added as a class. I am assuming that is a similar scenario to which this issue spawned from. So it is best practice to add uk-navbar as one of the classes.. ",

    "lukehutch": "\n. @saschadube @janschoenherr You guys are fast :-). Right, but what I mean is that you cannot drop the button below the last item in another column if you drag it there directly, because there is no invisible element at the end of the list of existing items that can accept a drag-drop. If you drag an item directly to the end of the list to try to drop it below the last item (i.e. drag it to below the last item, not on top of it), then when you release the mouse cursor, the drag operation is canceled. However, if you drag the item to an internal position in the other column first, so that a gap is created, and then drag it to the end of the items before dropping it, then the drag-drop does in fact succeed.\nWhat I'm saying is that you need to always create an invisible dropzone at the end of each of the groups as soon as a drag is commenced, so that you can drag and drop on this dropzone without first dragging to an internal position.\nIt would actually help a lot to show a dashed empty rectangle at the current insert position during a drag operation, so you can see where the dragged item will end up if you release the mouse.. This is not fixed, the button still does nothing on mouseover. (Scroll down to the \"Modes\" section in the page I linked, and hover over the \"HOVER\" button.)\nI have no way of reopening this bug since I didn't close it. Can you reopen it please?. @janschoenherr I am not able to reopen this bug, since I wasn't the one who closed it.. Using the Chrome Dev Tools' Timeline panel shows a very irregular framerate. I'm not an expert in reading the results of this tool, but every time there's an animation frame, two events (pointermove and mousemove) are generated, which calls into jQuery. Probably the entire document should have these two events disabled before the animation starts, and re-enabled at the end of the animation.\nAlso, every frame goes through these steps: Recalculate Style, Layout, Update Layer Tree, and Hit Test. Every other frame does Paint and Composite Layers. Definitely there is room for improvement here.\nAre the current animations 2D or 3D? The fastest mechanism is supposedly 3D with a 2D fallback, as shown in the links in the original bugreport.. @saschadube It's still very janky in Beta 22 (which appears to be what is running on the documentation site), both on mobile and on desktop. Even running on my fast desktop machine (8 core / 16 thread Ryzen 1800X, with a recent NVIDIA card, using the closed-source NVIDIA drivers), the offscreen menu demos show frame times of anywhere between 16.6ms to almost 60ms per frame (which causes major hiccups). Even the 16.6ms time per frame is too long, since that is the total rendering time, not including the time gap between frames, so you can't hit the 16.6ms budget per frame to animate at 60fps. The max framerate ends up being 30fps, frequently stuttering to 5-15fps.\nHowever, the browser can easily run hundreds of CSS animations at once at 60fps, so I don't understand why this particular animation is so time-consuming, or why the framerate is so irregular.\nHere's a screenshot of the animation, being rendered in Chrome Developer Tools. You can see the frame times near the top, with green background:\n\nIt looks like most of the time is being spent in GPU rendering, which is surprising. Probably it would be worth it to look in detail into what the GPU is doing during that time. You can do this by going to about:tracing in Chrome, and enabling the GPU options, then closing all tabs and windows but the one you're interested in, and running a trace while sliding the menus in and out. (Unfortunately I'm about to leave on an overseas trip, so I don't have time to dig further right now..)\nProbably though the answer to why the animation is janky is contained in this blog post. (Followup post)\nAlso, there are other tips in the links I posted earlier on how to improve performance (e.g. by removing backface rendering, by enabling 3D transforms with a fallback to 2D transforms, by setting the z-order, etc.)\nAs a stop-gap, you can hide some of the jankiness by doubling the speed of the animation (the animations are too slow right now anyway, in my opinion).. Exactly. Either you have some Javascript handler code that is being triggered during the animation, or you have some derived  properties that are being recompiled as translation is changing, or you are triggering layout. But yes, just affecting translation and opacity should be much smoother than this. \nThe overlay:true version in the docs looks just as janky to me as the non-overlay version.. Slide is no better. The modes all have equally uneven framerates.. If you can't directly see the stuttering leaping out at you (people's temporal perception abilities vary -- I can't not see it), then you should be able to see the effect by opening the Chrome Developer tools (Ctrl+Shift+C) and switching to Performance, then taking a recording while sliding the menu in and out.\n. That site is pretty smooth to the eye, yes, although it is animating at 30fps, not 60fps, because the frames don't fit into the 16ms budget. However, the frames consistently take about the same amount of time to animate, about 17ms, or 20ms with the inter-frame interval (whereas that is not true on the UIkit docs site, with frame times typically taking 20-24ms, but rising to almost 60ms every 5-10 frames or so). If I open/close the menu a few times on awwwards.com, I do see the occasional hiccup (dropping to 15fps or something, for a frame or two), but generally it's pretty consistent.\nThe thing about the awwwards.com site though, looking at it in Dev Tools, is that it spends quite a lot of time in each frame recalculating styles, and recalculating the layer tree. There must be a complex set of stylesheets and/or layers on the site. But the other thing that is not optimal is that the animation triggers mousemove events during each animation frame, because the canvas is moving under the mouse pointer. One optimization for desktop browsers would be to temporarily remove mousemove event handlers during menu open/close.. Yes, although the purpose of the test page is to view a bunch of elements that are supposed to work with a given theme setting, so maybe you should shim this and comment it in the test source. It is highly likely that I'm not the last that will think this is a bug. . Pinging on this again. Stencil is now very mature. . ",

[class*='uk-navbar-dropdown-bottom'] to work with the dropdown, i use to drop the value of margin-top: 15px; to margin-top: 0;.\neverything works fine.\nthe only part that i can the issue is the \"boundary alignment\" which is similar to the issue of mouse hover connection to the dropdown menu body which the mouse cursor cannot connect because it is far or there's a gap.. Im not sure if there missing 2 CSS code here, but finally i made the Off-Canvas closing animation back to work... All you have to do is add this 2 CSS:\n```\n/ this was trigger on and off during offcanvas animation /\n.uk-offcanvas { display: block; } \n/ i just add this to my css to support the transform CSS effect /\n.uk-offcanvas-bar { transition: all 300ms ease-out; } \n. Probably, this will come with font-size viewport or general static breakpoint font-size. yeah, these icons are getting more complicated than usual font-awesome version. though, i like the new icons... regarding icons, when checking the uikit-icon js file, all scripts written there are mostly svg's XML... I haven't get a chance to play around this but, I am assuming that perhaps I can add another line of svg's XML script there and see if the icons will work. as i understand, svg icons inside the folder are no longer called since it was completely rendered at js... it was very tricky at first place.. yeah, these icons are getting more complicated than usual font-awesome version. though, i like the new icons... regarding icons, when checking the uikit-icon js file, all scripts written there are mostly svg's XML...

Btw, the initiation of closing the offcanvas is different from beta.30... It instantly close the offcanvas instead of sliding-to-hide.\nUpdate: When trying to check the issue... it was the uk-open from the uk-offcanvas that should be the first to take-off before the parent-containers when closing the offcanvas window.\n.

Thanks!. I think that they are still working on the icons, and that it's just a matter of time :\n\nThe Icon component now comes with its own SVG icon system. It dynamically injects SVG icons, which can easily be styled with CSS. All icons were custom-built and include many beautiful elements for pretty much every usecase. More and more icons will be added over time.\nSource : https://yootheme.com/blog/2017/01/09/uikit-3-beta-released. @PistonPL There already was and still is a tool to do that. It used to be that you had to add your svg icons to the folder src/images/symbols and then run the command npm run images. (From the top of my head.)\n\nNow you need to add your svg icons to folder(s) custom/*/icons and run npm run icons. You should also be able to pass the path to a custom/*/icons folder as a parameter to the npm run icons command.\nThe svg file name becomes the icon name. and the * in custom/*/icons can only contain characters A-Z and a-z if I remember well.\nJust have a look at the icons.js script in the build folder.\n. You can add them yourself in the provided hook or miscellaneous hook.\nSee under Use hooks and Miscellaneous hooks here : https://getuikit.com/docs/less\nIn this case you need to add the \"missing\" widths to the miscellaneous hook (because no hook was provided)  at the bottom of this file : https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/develop/src/less/components/width.less#L398.\nAnd then recompile the less source code to css.\nP.S.\n\nuk-width--10( you have addition of 1-10, 3-10, 7-10, 11-10 proportions )\n\n11-10 doesn't look so hot.. @zzseba78 I forgot to add the link to the UIkit 2 grid.less file which contains the definition of the uk-width-*-10 classes : https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/v2/master/src/less/core/grid.less\nMakes it easier to add and derive the 7 and 8 variants. Just scan the file for -10. The media queries will probably be different from the ones in v3 though. \nGood luck with it. @saschadube method is a lot easier though. And less maintenance and liability too.\n. There is one more option (if you always want class .uk-list automatically applied to all ul elements).\nYou could try the :extend feature of Less: http://lesscss.org/features/#extend-feature\nI haven't done a regression test for lists though.\nLess:\nless\nul:extend(.uk-list all) {}\nshould become CSS:\n```css\n.uk-list,\nul {\n  padding: 0;\n  list-style: none;\n}\n/\n * Micro clearfix\n /\n.uk-list > li::before,\n.uk-list > li::after,\nul > li::before,\nul > li::after {\n  content: \"\";\n  display: table;\n}\n/ Etc. /\n```\nCurrently these CSS selectors would be extended with element ul. The first 2 are shown above.:\nCSS\n/* ========================================================================\n   Component: List\n ========================================================================== */\n.uk-list {\n  padding: 0;\n  list-style: none;\n}\n/*\n * Micro clearfix\n */\n.uk-list > li::before,\n.uk-list > li::after {\n  content: \"\";\n  display: table;\n}\n.uk-list > li::after {\n  clear: both;\n}\n/*\n * Remove margin from the last-child\n */\n.uk-list > li > :last-child {\n  margin-bottom: 0;\n}\n/*\n * Nested lists\n */\n.uk-list ul {\n  margin: 0;\n  padding-left: 30px;\n  list-style: none;\n}\n/*\n * Style\n */\n.uk-list > li:nth-child(n+2),\n.uk-list > li > ul {\n  margin-top: 10px;\n}. I thought this was only about unordered lists.\nOne line of Less ul:extend(.uk-list all) {} is not exactly rewriting the CSS.\nHave you checked the relevant CSS of Bootstrap 4? Their way, you have to fight the framework (undo) if you want something (completely) different than their CSS styling (and sometimes some of their JS). Their styling is always there as soon as the CSS is matched.\nBrowsers are optimised for logical OR'ing when matching CSS rules. Check their source code.\nI personally think that the whole bloating thing is wildly exaggerated. Just like the semantics thing, e.g. .island and .islet classes (my God!) in Inuit.css (a framework by a CSS speaker). All subjects invented by CSS speakers who need new subjects to keep speaking. Natural language (non-technical and related) is much more intuitive.\nIt looks like you have to make a decision between learning your users/clients how to use UIkit properly/directly, or to learn them the markdown way (if they are not familiar with it yet).\nI would stick with UIkit 3, its patterns are so much more up-to-date and it does so much more than Bootstrap 4. And only when you want it to.\nuikit.min.less (186KB) vs bootstrap.min.css (147KB). I remember using Foundation 3's CSS with approximately 325KB minified.\nAnyway, it was just a suggestion of another option.\n. You(r users) could have learned all tech mentioned in this issue since it was opened.\nMy users are buyers on Themeforest and Creative Market. Not the most cooperative bunch when it comes to learning new stuff. But they do to achieve what they want.. Other than freelancers, and companies with knowledgeable staff, most of my users also have other jobs and things to do.\nIf your users want a GUI, why not write them one? There are plenty of SPI / SPA frameworks.\nBut if they don't want to learn they should pay/find someone to do the work for them.\nJust like users at Themeforest are made aware of (gently being pushed into) paid customisation. Usually at third parties.. Apparently you can keep using Font Awesome : https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/2236. ",

A bit of a roundabout fuss and sort of counter intuitive.. The Icons component fails to load up the icons when the scripts are appended to the body/below the actual content. I've not had a chance to debug the issue entirely and have continued development with the script tags in the head.\nI noticed your docs site places the scripts in the head. I'll clone it down and move the location of the tags.\nOn 14 Feb 2017, 08:34 +0000, janschoenherr notifications@github.com, wrote:\n\nCould you be more precise as to what is not working?

    "jlauemoeller": "I see this as well. My conclusion is that at the moment UIkit 3-beta-11 and earlier is not compatible with import use in a webpack managed app. You have to import UIkit js and css using old-style script and link tags.\nHere's what I have seen so far:\nThe reason the import of optional components such as Tooltip fails is that these make references to a global UIkit object. This won't be available in the host application when managed by webpack. It's interesting to note that the built-in components are actually \"imported\" in a way that explicitly provides them with a UIkit reference and that is the reason they work. Importing uikit-core.js works because that file does not contain the optional components -- uikit.js is really just uikit-core.js with the optional component source files appended verbatim.\nAdding import UIkit from 'uikit' to the start each optional component source file partly fixes the issue; the basic import uikit from 'uikit' in your application code will now work (after a npm run compile step, of course). \nHowever, the problem then simply moves to the UIkit mixins (as reported by @mjbates7), which suffers from the same issue; they appear to webpack as ordinary modules and references UIkit, but does not import it. This is the reason we see errors in the console even when just importing uikit-core and not using any optional components. In this case, however, importing UIkit directly in the mixin won't help as the mixin themselves are imported by the rest of UIkit; webpack detects this circularity during npm run compile and marks UIkit as an external reference. This allows the npm run compile step to complete with the added import statements, but doesn't actually help at runtime as there will be no global external UIkit reference available when the host app is managed by webpack. \nI have tried using the weboack ProvidePlugin but didn't arrive at a configuration that worked..

Also, when i check what is imported and follow through the debugger, the icon object is present and looks all set. Finally, when I just set them through CDN links in my index.html they display ok, so it's strange.\nMaybe there is something webpack related preventing umd module with icons from firing the icon functions?. Unfortunately, though I missed to mention I have tried all possible css imports, directly from links in html head (from node modules and cdn), as well as through my scss setup. While all styles are there in the complete app icons are not. \nAlso in my source (https://github.com/paulidealiste/GeometricShank) i'm using Electron for this, so maybe that has something to do with it, since it overrides some global variables.. @dasdeck Hey thank you so mush for the ui-kit example repo, since I have managed to find out what was the problem with my setup by looking at your example webpack configs.

I'll commit an update that will use the --watchContentBase by default. This will trigger a few more updates then needed but works for now.

Thanks for the report!\nTurns out the documentation has not been updated properly (which will come next).\nin your fiddle, simple add:\njavascript\nUIkit.container = UIkit.util.$('.uk-scope');\nto your javscript\n..doc..\nNow you need to tell modals, tooltips and the likes where to append themselves into the dom when they want to show. To do so, set the following parameter to UIkit:\njavascript\n//simply pass the selector\nUIkit.container = '.uk-scope' \n...\n//or you can set an element directly, for example\nUIkit.container = document.getElementById('#id-of-scope-element-or-element-inside-your-scope');\nCheers!.

I'll close this for lack of interaction.. edit: I'm just setting up an example project and now see your point there!\nMy advice below certainly did not help.\nMy typescript is kinda basic, but as I understand we'd either need someone to create typings for the current version of UIkit or, In the meantime, you should be able to get by using the --allowJs compiler flag. https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html\nCheers!. @gokkep \nI created a minimal example on how to bundle UIkit inside a TypeScript environment. \nhttps://github.com/dasdeck/uikit-example\nThe solution seems to be to use import * as UIkit from 'uikit'; instead of import UIkit from 'uikit';, which seems to be common practice for TypeScript users.\nPlease let me now if that helps!\nCheers!. We thought about normalizing sizes for custom icons, though last time I did just that, with the libraries available at that time, It did not turn out to be as trivial as it sounds. We'll consider it in the future.. @marcelgeratsch Maybe I'm mistaken, but wouldn't size normalization involve checking the actual paths, which then leads to the whole relative vs. absolute thing etc.? As far as I know, adjusting the bounding box will nut suffice in many cases. If it works for you, very good though!. Hey there! SSR is not really supported for UIkit. However, I wrote a simple wrapper that will at least make UIkit boot on the server. It works with jsdom. \nhttps://github.com/dasdeck/uikit-ssr\nYou can either use this wrapper or can get some inspiration on how to solve it in your environment.\nCheers!\nedit: also a side node: When we were working with nuxt, we simply externalized and removed UIkit in the server webpack config so it would not fail during import. Also we made sure to only use UIkit inside events that do not get called on the server. . true, this approach is very simplistic and assumes a lot, it worked in most cases and is a little sugar on top anyways. you really should rebuild and prefix from scratch. I'll remove or update the feature now.\nThanks for your input!\nCheers!. Thanks for the report! This will be fixed in the next release!\nCheers!. I'm not sure I understand you correctly.\nyarn watch seems to work just fine over here.\nAre you talking about your own custom less?\nOnly less files inside the UIkit directory are watched.\nCheers!\nJM. Ok, I'm happy to look into it, you'll have to provide me some repo/steps/info to reproduce the issue though. Out of the box, everything works just fine.. Ah, ok, I see now. It does not work when running inside another node_modules folder.\nThe issue seems to be related to this:\nhttps://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/faq.md#overriding-the-underlying-default-ignore-rules\nAs a quick workaround put a nodemon.json inside your uikit folder and add this as content:\njson\nhttps://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/faq.md#overriding-the-underlying-default-ignore-rules\nWe will consider this as a possible fix, if it has no bad side effects.\nCheers!\nJM. hey @stell !\nI recommend to only use the scope script on clean builds. I'll add a compilation step in the yarn scripts section and remove the clean options to make that clear.\n. I just found a way to fix the issue while keeping the \"clear/change\" functionality, it will be released soon. What is currently missing for your workflow?.

This should be fixed in the next dev-version/release.\nCheers!. This should be fixed in the next dev-version/release.\nCheers!. Can you elaborate on how this is a bug? The '!default' flags behind all our variables are intentional, it is due to the nature of how our conversion script works. The resulting CSS looks identical on a manual comparison.\nCheers!\nJM. Can it be that you are comparing the wrong builds? the \"theme\" build in scss is the uikit.css, \nthe other one is the \"uikit-core.css\" build.\nI just did the same :blush:\nCheers!. Ah! Yes sorry, I was working on an already fixed version.

Although this doesn't really answer any of the questions, or solve any of the issues people would be having.\nuk-width-auto and uk-width-expand are not a solution to situations where you would want something like uk-width-1-10 and uk-width-9-10.

As you said means you gotta do a bunch of nesting, when HTML should be used for defining the structure, not appearance. This is EXACTLY what css is for. So why try do it with HTML? Having a few lines of cacheable css seems to be a much nicer solution, is much more readable and maintainable, 12 months down the line seeing a 1-10 and 9-10 is more obvious than what seem randomly nested divs. Which also adds extra overhead to CMS projects where repeatable elements are required to be embedded..

I do not quite understand how you can connect the uk-img here to chrome used webp, and in firefox jpg:\n<picture>\n    <source srcset=\"examples/images/large.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n    <img srcset=\"examples/images/large.jpg\" alt=\"\u2026\">\n</picture>. +1. New added icons double corners stylistically different from the usual corners, together they look terrible. Adding just icons, without js-attributes, imposes the use of the icon component, which is not always desirable.. I confirm the bug, it is observed not only on the documentation page, but also on working projects. \"Secondary\" column is missing.\nPerhaps some styles are missing because of their lack of demand, which is debatable.. Hi @zzseba78 ;) Perhaps \"secondary\" is identified with \"success\", but this is not accurate )))\nDo not forget about the style of \"muted\" which is more like a disabled state, but also has weight, I would have added it as a separate column.\n( Sorry for the English curve ). This is not a bug, this behavior has always been normal: a click outside the content displayed in the lightbox closes the lightbox.

At the time of writing this I was working on beta7 of the framework (is my memory serves me right, that is), today i downloaded beta9 and the problem went way.. Ah, that explains it. Somehow I missed that part of documentation.\nIt all works now, thanks.. oh yes. Just revisited the functionality using rc5 and I still have the same issue. Something tells me that the fix didn't really fixed it.. Ok, try this: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/vrXpBo\nTry to drag a file into the file upload (empty txt will do).\nOnce the upload is done the final alert will contain the value of the input field and if you do the inspection you will also see the posted value is also 1\n\n\nnow click button 2, and upload the file again. The alert will show 2, but the inspection will show id has not changed\n\n\nI know the reason behind is the fact the value is passed into UKkit.upload at the time the page is rendered. However I am struggling to figure out a way to make it more dynamic. I tried wrapping the whole UIkit.upload into a function with parameter and calling this function on change event for the upload area but no luck.\nI am guessing here that in the main js file there must be something that wipes and rebuilds the array of files that are being posted. Maybe there should also be something that wipes and rebuild the params?. Please forgive me if this question seems daft (I'm more of a back-end, rather then front-end person), but how would I (re)initialize the component everytime file are dropped into it?. Never mind, I had a bit of a brain-blackout\n$(this).attr('uk-icon','minus-circle') will do the job. I just tried on Android (6.0.1) with Chrome (68.0.3440.91) and Firefox (61.0.2). I am unable to scroll the content in both browsers if my finger is over the card and its content. I am able to continue scrolling if I manage to \"grab\" the space between the card or either side of them (highlighted red in picture below).\n\n. By \"fully expanded\" I assume you mean that all accordion elements are opened, while on mobile they are all closed by default.\nThe quickest way to achieve what you want is to have two accordions, one visible on mobiles only the other on everything else. The general template would look like this:\n```\n visible on anything bigger then mobile \n\n\n\n\n\n visible only on mobile \n\n\n\n\n\n```\nSee this: http://jsfiddle.net/pk0zdcn4/8/\n. Just an afterthought - if you want to have the accordion always expanded on large screen you might as well change it to a https://getuikit.com/docs/description-list. Pretty much the same thing but without the close/open option.. Flickers on Chrome, Firefox & Opera.\nWorks fine on Safari, Edge & IE11.. All you have to do is to add a custom css to your page where you can extend the functionality of Uikit, without touching the main framework.\nThis is a quick jsfiddle that should point you in the right direction.\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/cg9he635/2/\nEssentially I created new class called uk-progress-lime (catering for ms, webkit & mozilla), applied lime  colour to the background, and then added that class next to the uk-progress\nclass=\"uk-progress uk-progress-lime\". I'm currently on Mac so can't test IE but checked on Chrome, FF, Safari & Opera - all works as expected.\nNot sure why is there a 2000px height attached to the main body div, but just in case I removed it and tested again, with same result.\nSince you appear to be working on windows, can you possibly record the bug as it happens (with console opened would be nice) to a gif and post it somewhere. Try using this: https://www.screentogif.com. LOL, in my case IE11 just shoved the modal to the bottom of the page \ud83e\udd23 \nAnyway, if you remove the 2000px style all is fine, and on OSX everything is fine in both cases. Something tells me that you are looking at OS/browser behaviour. If you look closely, you will see that when you open the modal, both browser are disabling the scrollbar. Maybe this has an effect on how the browser renders the content of the page, but that's just a guess.. I'm pretty sure now it's the browser behaviour.\nTest the below code in Chrome:\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n\n\n\n\nmodal bug\n\n\n\n    html { background:#fff url(http://yanshi.sucaihuo.com/modals/39/3978/demo/img/header.jpg);}\n    ::-webkit-scrollbar{display:none;}\n   \n\n\nopen\n\nHi! I should be at the bottom\n<div id=\"modal1\" uk-modal>\n        <div class=\"uk-modal-dialog uk-modal-body\">content</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n```\nI added a css that hides the scroll bars, while still allowing the user to scroll through the document.\nNow calling the modal does not resize the background, while still allowing user to scroll to the bottom of the page (I added extra div with white background for visibility)\nKeep in mind the added css will work for webkit browser only, so you need to research solution for FF, IE & Edge.. Sadly not really, as the site is live and I need to keep that thing working.\nThe only other thing that comes to my mind is that the site is based on a CMS system that is using Bootstrap 3 as the main theme. However I do not get any errors or even warnings in the console, I don't think scoping of uikit would do any good, and as mention everything works fine on rc16.\nMaybe I should start slowly incrementing the version of the uikit starting from rc17 until 3.0.0 and see on which it breaks :unamused:.

Perhaps the switcher would accomplish this? https://getuikit.com/docs/switcher - you could add the animation class as well to give it a more toggle-like feel. . It looks like it's missing from here: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/6626e0993fefaa547342bdedcd751af48a2cef4a/src/less/components/width.less\nAlso missing, 2-6 and 3-6.

There's now different exceptions to an expected pattern that will inevitably break things as the OP has demonstrated in the codepen above. It also makes it much harder to document because of these exceptions.

Simply by swapping uk- for data-uk- \nThe docs state both are fully supported but only data-uk-* seems to pass validation.\nI read somewhere (can't recall where!) that W3C validation of custom JS attributes is a little unreliable currently - so even though your code is failing, it is actually valid :). I've noticed on the grid - where a width-X-X would duplicate another width declaration, it doesn't exist. \nSo, because width-1-3 and width-2-6 would be the same, only width-1-3 exists as a valid tag. The same for width-2-3 and width-4-6. So I think the expectation is you need to mix width tags like this.\n<div uk-grid>\n    <div class=\"uk-width-1-6\">...</div>\n    <div class=\"uk-width-2-3\">...</div>\n    <div class=\"uk-width-1-6\">...</div>\n</div>\nI guess this is to reduce the overall size of the CSS, but it will (and has) cause confusion. It doesn't help that the documentation doesn't explain this and actually suggests 2-6 and 3-6 would be valid tags.. I think the confusion has to outweigh the load gains here. You're only talking an extra 10-15 lines of CSS to add the duplicate/expected declarations in. For a doc that is already 9000+ lines, that addition is negligible.. I just tested your HTML and it's throwing an error as it's unable to locate the CSS file. Is the URL in the head correct?. And is it working now?. Ah, that's because you haven't set a height on your uk-cover-container. You need to add a uk-height-* tag too. This is because once the image is applied as a background via the JS, there is no content inside the cover div so it collapses. \nTry this...\n<div class=\"uk-cover-container uk-height-medium\">\n     <img src=\"https://getuikit.com/assets/uikit/tests/images/photo.jpg\" alt=\"\" uk-cover>\n</div>\n. No worries :)\n. I'm not sure I agree that the default icon set should cover much more than it already does - social media/brand icons maybe but surely as designers/developers you'd want use original icons that fit your designs better rather than using a generic set that would lead to every site looking the same?\nAdding your own custom icons the SVG file is relatively straight-forward too.. I do like these button styles, but I think the question needs to be asked - when does UIKIT stop being a CSS/HTML structure framework and become a design framework? . The documentation does not help. By saying '.uk-width-1-6 to .uk-width-5-6' - It does suggest 2-6, 3-6, 4-6, are acceptable classes.. I think the SVGs in that folder are for reference only. They appear to be hardcoded in the CSS as data URLs rather the pointed to in the traditional url('.../images/plus.svg') way.. I think the SVGs in that folder are for reference only.

The icon will automatically be added to the main icons.js file ready to use in your projects. So in theory, you don't have to edit the JS file manually at all :). I guess you could. Using the docs, you could probably compile a custom theme that only imports the elements essential for the icon component - and then use that along side your existing design/code/framework.. There is one already :)\nReceiver - It was added a few versions again, for some reason it doesn't show in the main documentation but it can be seen on the test page :)\nhttps://getuikit.com/assets/uikit/tests/icon.html. I don't think this will happen. UIKIT 3 is the later stages of development so will replace UIKIT 2 soon and includes a whole new way of handling icons.. Agreed, but there is a difference between supporting and updating :). Sorry to jump on this, but I'm seeing similar (and more) issues with the test files in 31. Should there also be a test.js file included? Most of the test html files reference it, but it doesn't exist in the tests/js folder.. Sorry to jump on this, but I'm seeing similar (and more) issues with the test files in 31. Should there also be a test.js file included? Most of the test html files reference it, but it doesn't exist in the tests/js folder.. You can already target them individually? Target you CSS are .uk-dotnav > li (or whatever your dots are).\nWhat would be the benefit of adding further complexity to the component?. Personally I think there are already too many icons. Who uses UIKit without customising it anyways? So there only really needs to be a handful of icons to show you how to customise - then the only limit is your creativity and imagination. . I've been experiencing issues with the Filter too in WP. When filtering the animation is jumps then corrects itself.\nIt does appear to be being caused by the admin bar, but I cannot seem to get the fix to tooltip to work for filter.

However, it looks like they plan on getting to it based on their release blog post from 09-Jan: UIkit 3 Beta Released. Sure thing:\nExample. I added a nav-bar right to the codepen I linked to above to try to demonstrate it working with using a button instead of a hyperlink. Interestingly, the way it's coded works for the dropdown when using the button as the trigger. However, if you remove the li after the dropdown (<li><a href=\"#\">Item</a></li>), it works the same as when using a hyperlink as the trigger.\nIt appears that the hyperlink as the trigger may not be the issue, but instead is something with the way the dropdown is being triggered from the navbar?. Yes, I've tried all the same browsers, and am experiencing the issue described above.\nI did find that adding uk-dropdown=\"pos: bottom-center\" to the div with uk-navbar-dropdown allows the dropdown to persist when mouseover. .

Not the kind of behavior I would ever want to endorse, but until a fix comes out, you might find that it works.~~\nUpdate:\nYou can import uikit and icons in the standard manner:\nimport UIkit from 'uikit'\nimport Icons from 'uikit/dist/js/uikit-icons'\n...\nat the top of the page with your other imports, and then instantiate your Vue instance when the page becomes ready. After instantiating your vue instance, then do UIkit.use(Icons), and the page should render normally. Something like:\n...\n$(function() {\n    const app = new Vue({...})\n    UIkit.use(Icons)\n})\n. @rossity, this is what I did (in an off-canvas element, for example):\n<button class=\"uk-offcanvas-close\" type=\"button\">\n   <span uk-icon=\"icon: close\"></span>\n</button>\nPretty easy \ud83d\ude04, although I can't guarantee it will be this simple for all components.

Thanks!. @johncarter-oz looks like you're referring to the v2 documentation. Are aren't you using v3? . Someone (@carlos-duran) on gitter posted this solution, which is supposed to work (haven't tried myself, yet):\njavascript\nconst UIkit = require('uikit')\nconst Icons = require('uikit/dist/js/uikit-icons')\nUIkit.use(Icons);. Another idea would be to have a specific prefix, which would only be observed after explicitly being enabled. So instead of uk-* you'd write defer-uk-* and enable it later:\njavascript\nUIKit.observe('defer'); // optionally specify the prefix of choice\nThis would be a flexible approach, that is also fully backwards compatible.\nHere's a naive workaround:\njavascript\n$('[defer-uk-icon]').each(function() {\n    var $this = $(this);\n    var value = $this.attr('defer-uk-icon');\n    $this.removeAttr('defer-uk-icon');\n    $this.attr('uk-icon', value);\n});. Also related: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/2357. This appears to be fixed: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/mmrEbw\nHowever, I cannot make the js-only approach UIkit.icon(elem, { icon: 'world' }) work at all.. Update: this only happens if { center: true } is set. When false, it fires consistently and immediately.\nSee: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/aWBaLw (events are logged to console). @florianletsch thanks for confirming this! When using this, I assume the existing component is used or updated, instead of throwing it away and re-initializing it?\nUIkit is pretty awesome! Would definitely like to know more!. In believe this issue manifests itself when using jQuery v.3. In v.2 dimensions were rounded to integers, but this is no longer the case.. You should add cls-placeholder: uk-placeholder to #website as well, in order for this sortable to know which class to remove. \nPerhaps it can be improved within Uikit to use the same settings within groups automatically.. See: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/MmXRNg - the event is only triggered on the container of the items that are switched. Perhaps the same event should also be triggered on the switcher itself, though. I find it counter-intuitive to not have any events there.. @razvanioan here's one example, simply created from the first Modal example on that page:\nhttps://codepen.io/anon/pen/vZppmL\nStrangely, your Pen is working for me.. @razvanioan well, in that case, I think the documentation examples should be fixed (Pens used to work straight from the 'Edit in Codepen' buttons in the docs).. @SaphiLC this is a known (and unresolved) bug, when using center: true: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/2626. Well, that's true indeed ... however, the Modal mixin is applied to the off-canvas component, which makes it inherit those properties. Besides, it has been working well for me, except for this minor glitch, the off-canvas can be treated exactly like the Modal component. Which might be useful to point out in the documentation as well.. Here's the Pen from above, with a workaround applied: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/zEPEqV. There's actually an additional issue, which is the (in my experience) notorious 'bubbling transitionend' effect: the uk-close button has a css transition applied as well, which causes the transitionend event to fire prematurely due to the hover effect that happens during clicking on the button, bubbling up to the handler that is actually only watching for the offcanvas animation to complete.\nBecause of this, there's a visual difference between closing the modal using the mouse or using the esc key. It's very subtle, though. If you click without moving the cursor much, it will still be unaffected by it and look smooth as expected. I'm trying to get this issue resolved right now.\nI don't know how effective a PR is though - I haven't seen much activity lately, let alone issues being closed much. In that case, the documentation should also be updated btw.. @janschoenherr There's a similar issue I'm encountering in Off-canvas (current version from GH):\nuikit.js:5784 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'scrollTop' of null\n    at Offcanvas.write (uikit.js:5784)\nFor some reason, content is not available, and this is not accounted for gracefully. Fix would be similar: check for a valid content element first.. @ruchern it\u2019s a customized Woofmark editor (https://github.com/bevacqua/woofmark). @janschoenherr I've found the issue. For some reason, the toggle parameter (which was pointing to a specific jQuery element) was not taken into account anymore. Due to the nesting of the tags, the width of the wrong element was being used, hence the issue I was seeing. It was indeed the border, but this was applied to the parent, causing both child nodes to be smaller. And the preceding node was used automatically now.\nIs there a reason the toggle parameter stopped working, perhaps?. I was expecting an event once the svg is loaded as well.. @tzd I think they were a bit quick to dismiss this as a documentation issue. \nIt's still a blocking issue for me as well.. @tzd I think they were a bit quick to dismiss this as a documentation issue. \nIt's still a blocking issue for me as well..

Here's a link: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/WzPoEV\nThanks for the reply!. Not quite. I was aiming for the checkbox to be on the right with a responsive table on mobile screens, and a normal table with the checkbox on the left for desktop screens. I tried adding the alignments to the rows as well, but to no avail. . I appreciate your advice and I'll check out that link. I do feel like this might be a bug though. It definitely tries to align right but carries over to the next line instead. That doesn't seem like the right behavior. Maybe I am doing something wrong, but it doesn't feel like I am. I'll keep things open for more discussion, if that's okay. Thanks!. Clarification: Just a follow up, it appears to be two bugs with responsive tables and input fields. \n1. Right alignment in the table header row will always be wrong with just a simple \"uk-align-right\" tag. The auto-add margins feature is adding too much margin. (https://codepen.io/anon/pen/zWeQYv)\n2. All other fields work as long as a responsive @ tag isn't used with uk-align. (same as first posted)\n. Right, but you're not using inputs... I'll add that to my clarification post.. It is a bug: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/JLxgXQ\nThe bug is adding a responsive tag.. Thank you thank you thank you.\nI understand now. I was trying to do this: \"uk-text-right uk-text-left@m\". Ahhh! Thank you!. Fair enough. Closed.. Not sure why you're so aggressive here... I applied it to main and it has the same issue.\nI'm using Chrome on Android. Any other suggestions?\n```\n<!doctype html>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<title>UIkit Example</title>\n<link rel=\"manifest\" href=\"appmanifest.json\">\n<link rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"favicon.ico\" type=\"image/x-icon\" />\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"lib/uikit-3.0.0-beta.42/css/uikit.min.css\" />\n\n<!-- Script Imports -->\n<script src=\"lib/uikit-3.0.0-beta.42/js/uikit.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"lib/uikit-3.0.0-beta.42/js/uikit-icons.min.js\"></script>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Test App\n      \n\n\n\n    Test\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest\nTest\nTest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```.

Hmm, had to run npm install yarn and npm install after updating uikit.  . I have completely uninstalled UIkit and then installed again, and still get this error message on the frontend.  Help appreciated!. Update:\nI specifically re-installed rc4 and I don't get that error on the frontend, something in rc5 is different and is breaking for me:\nnpm install --save-dev uikit@3.0.0-rc.4\n\n. @dasdeck \nI uninstalled and then re-installed uikit (now at rc6) and custom icons aren't showing on the frontend.\nThere are no build errors or front end errors.\nAll configuration is the same as displayed in original post.  \nThe html where the icons should be showing is:\nhtml\n<li id=\"input\" title=\"Input\" uk-tooltip=\"pos: right\" class=\"iconnav-item-color iconnav-item-hover-color uk-padding-remove-vertical\">\n<a data-content-name=\"input\" class=\"uk-padding-small uk-icon\" uk-icon=\"icon: ic_add_white_24px; ratio: 1.3\"></a>\n</li>\nAnd normally, the svg tags would appear within the <a> tags, but they are not.  \n. I resolved this by adjusting the following in src/js/uikit.js from:\nimport Icons from 'uikit/dist/js/uikit-icons';\n\nto:\nimport Icons from 'uikit/dist/js/uikit-icons-my-theme';\n\nI'm not sure why previously the custom icons were available in uikit/dist/js/uikit-icons and now they are not. \n. Actually, my bad, I forgot this:\nhttps://getuikit.com/docs/custom-icons#add-and-overwrite-icons\n\nThe build process will check two places for additional icon files:\nThe custom folder: /custom/icons/.svg\nAny custom theme: /custom/mytheme/icons/.svg\n\nand had copied in an old custom folder with a nested theme folder, whereas it just should have contained an icons folder.  . I've tested further on browserstack.com and the above behaviour occurs in:\niPhone 5S (Safari, Chrome)\niPhone 6 (Safari, Chrome)\niPhone 6 Plus (Safari, Chrome)\nIt displays as desired from iPhone 6S and up.  \nI've googled flex not working in safari iphone and come across these answers:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/41425528\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/35137869  \nThey basically say that flex is not supported in all browsers, and some require -webkit- prefixes.  \nI've read the following at:  https://getuikit.com/docs/introduction\n\nWhat is the solution to have UIKit working in iOS versions less than iPhone 5S (i use LESS)?  \n(I am still using iPhone 4!). @saschadube \nBelow are results for Safari in:\niPhone 5S iOSv7\niPhone 6 iOSv8\niPhone 6 Plus iOSv8\nThe same behaviour occurs in Chrome browser.  \n\n\n\n. Is the only way to handle it, to display a message if they are not using a modern browser?  \nFor example:  \n\nIt appears you are not using a modern browser.     \nThe application is only supported on modern browsers.  \nThe following list specifies the versions this application is supported on. \n\"Latest\" means that it works just fine on all recent versions of that browser. \nChrome: Latest\nFirefox: Latest\nEdge: Latest\nIE:  11+\nSafari:  9.1+\nOpera: Latest\n\nIf so, how would that be accomplished?  . I am finding the earliest version on browserstack that seems to support flexbox, is iPhone 6 with iOS 11.  Anything lower just \"doesn't work\".    I don't even know how to begin applying the same sort of logic tests for Android etc.  I don't know how you guys do it, it's doing my head in :(.  . I tried using Modernizr with the Flexbox and Flex Line Wrapping detects, but it seems to return true if browser supports -webkit- prefix  (which is not used in Uikit).  \nFor example, I tried the following codepen at browserstack on iPhone 5S, iOS, v7 and console logs flexbox is supported.   \nEdit View:  https://codepen.io/oshihirii/pen/mGvJaW\nLive View:  https://codepen.io/oshihirii/live/mGvJaW\nSo i will have to try something else.\n. I also tried a CSS only solution which seems to be working (based on this post).  \nYou can try this codepen on browserstack.com:\nhttps://codepen.io/oshihirii/live/RYvgvy   \nCSS\n```\n.no_content_container {\n    width: 100%;\n    height: 100vh;\n    position: absolute;\n    z-index: 1;\n    background: #fff;\n    display: block;\n}\n.no_content_inner {\n    width: 80%;\n    margin: auto;\n    margin-top: 10px;\n    padding: 10px;\n}\n_:-ms-fullscreen, :root .no_content_container { display: none; }\n:-o-prefocus, .no_content_container { display: none; }\n@supports (display: flex) { .no_content_container { display: none; }}\n**HTML**\n\n\n\nIt appears you are not using a modern browser.\nThe application is only supported on modern browsers.\nThe following list specifies the versions this application is supported on.\n\"Latest\" means it works fine on all recent versions of that browser.\n\nChrome: Latest\nFirefox: Latest\nEdge: Latest\nIE: 11+\nSafari: 9.1+\nOpera: Latest\n\n\n\n```\n. That's not even working completely.\nIt seems Safari in iOSv9 is still handling uk-flex, uk-width-auto and uk-width-expand weirdly.\nFor my reference, this includes:  \n1) If a flex container has three child divs - one that is full width, and subsequently one with uk-width-auto and one uk-width-expand, and the uk-width-auto div is hidden, then the uk-width-expand div does not show.  \nYou can test this in browserstack iOS v9, Safari:\nhttps://codepen.io/oshihirii/live/XPOZjB\n(update: i wrapped the 2nd and 3rd child divs in a div and it sorted itself out)\n2)  Absolutely positioned elements within a flex container can't be made visible (z-index does nothing), they have to be moved outside the flex container.  \nNothing erroneous shows up in console or elements view in dev tools, it just doesn't behave. . Can anyone recommend or otherwise using UIkit with:\nhttps://autoprefixer.github.io  \nEdit\nI have read the following:\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/3538\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/55\nwhich basically comes to the conclusion 'there's no point'.  \nIt just doesn't seem like a viable solution to not support anything less than iPhone 6 with iOS 11.  \n. If I move the dropdown div outside of parent container, to a next sibling position, then the desired behaviour occurs:\nhttps://codepen.io/oshihirii/pen/LgGzEr\nBut then the whole previous div becomes the toggle element.  \nIf I specify a toggle element, it inherits the padding of the specified toggle element, and the original undesired behaviour occurs.  \nI am now trying to use the javascript options to show the dropdown - is there a way to disable the default event being triggered when hovering over the previous div?\n.

It looks like masonry adds <div style=\"transform: translateY(0px);\"> wrapper to uk-card, if I untoggle that style in dev tools, the dropdown div is not beneath anymore (however then the masonry effect is not applied).  \nMaybe these are relevant solutions:  \nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/32816750/why-z-index-does-not-work-for-element-having-transform-translatey\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/43059582\nhttps://katydecorah.com/code/z-index-and-transform/\nhttps://codepen.io/mrmoje/pen/yLIul (from https://stackoverflow.com/a/18754257). Update: \nI've implemented another solution to get around this dynamic, which essentially:\n\nmimics the uk-tooltip functionality (an on click, mouseover to show and mouseleave to hide content)\nmimics the uk-dropdown styling.  \n\nI append the dynamically generated div to body and then destroy it on mouseleave.  Because the div is outside of the container that has had the transform applied, its z-index is preserved and above other content as desired.  \n. @zzseba78 thanks for your comments (and codepen!), yes the only issue I kept coming up against was there was no way to maintain absolute position of dropdown to relative uk-card (to maintain position when scrolling content) and keep above other divs (although you seem to have achieved that by defining toggle property).  So I just went with solution in my last comment which appends div to body, outside of stacking context, but destroys it on mouseleave.  It works ok for this scenario.  (Ergh, actually my solution doesn\u2019t work on tablet, there is no mouseleave so dropdown is just stuck in absolute position to body when scrolling down and can\u2019t be closed, might have to look at your solution more \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd) . @zzseba78 - feel free to ignore but, in my scenario, masonry is applied to a container div that is scrollable - ie it has height and overflow-y: auto defined.\ni forked your solution, and added height and overflow-y to the container, and now the dropdown \"stays in place\" whilst the rest of the content scrolls.  do you know how i can make it scroll in line with the rest of the content in the scrollable area?  \nhere is demonstration:\nhttps://codepen.io/oshihirii/pen/GYMMNe (forked v1)\nEdit:\nMy solution was to wrap the dropdowns in a relative positioned wrapper div, at the end of the div with masonry applied - it seems to work!\nhttps://codepen.io/oshihirii/pen/zmEEdE (forked v2) \nAnother Edit:\n@zzseba78 \nAnd here is a solution for dynamic dropdowns - i replicate the look and effect of uk-dropdown without using the uk-dropdown component (unfortunately that means i lose out on the 'flipping' behaviour when touching edge of viewport, but i wasn't sure how else to make a dynamic solution):\nhttps://codepen.io/oshihirii/pen/rqGJqY\n. Interestingly, moving between groups is recognised with the added event, so maybe i can use that.  . ",

    "saun4app": "@vuchl, @zzseba78:  thanks for your prompt replay. I agree with you that, uikit docs has very high quality.  uikit docs  also show signs of Curse of knowledge; result in requiring more effort from new users than you may expect to jump start using uikit.\nPaying more attention to the \"last-mile\" or \"last-one-percent\" effort would make a significant different for a new user.\n@zzseba78,\nYou are right that https://getuikit.com/docs/switcher#switcher-and-tab is a complete enough example as I suggested.  However, this example does not stand out in the https://getuikit.com/docs/tab page.  A new user, who see the uk-tab example for the first time, is not familiar with uikit enough to look for uk-tab examples in https://getuikit.com/docs/switche page.\nBefore you pointed it out.  I did not know to look for  switcher-and-tab while I was looking at tab.\nPlacing switcher-and-tab in https://getuikit.com/docs/tab page is an example of the  \"last-one-percent\"  effort that has significant impact on a new user's effort in learning uikit.\n@vuchl,\nI truly want to see uikit to become more popular, therefore more sustainable.  The last thing I want to pointlessly arguing with you.  Please don't feel the need to reply this message. . @zzseba78 ,\nDon\u2019t Make Me Think or read;  Show examples like switcher-and-tab;\nMore than 90% of the code samples are great.  I am trying to say I stumbled on the https://getuikit.com/docs/nav page.  I did not know to look for examples on https://getuikit.com/docs/switche.  Adding code samples like switcher-and-tab will make the https://getuikit.com/docs/nav page as good as the other sections of the doc.. Well, I sincerely believe that uk-tab is better than bootstrap tabs and fundation tabs.  I failed to understand why you guys resist putting a good tab code sample, that you already have, on the tab page, in order to  get more new readers understand ui-tab more easily; just because you disagree on how every reader should read your docs.\nAsk yourself, but don't answer, this question.  When you read a doc (of a framework) do you prefer look at code samples or paragraph of text?\nI personally prefer to scan code samples on a specific component (e.g, tab) when I look at a new framework.  If I don't see code example(s) that is better than the frameworks that I knew, I would skip the page (component) or the framework.  tab is usually my first test case.\nBasically, \n- tab is a familiar term for most readers.  New readers are likely to look for tab code sample on tap page.\n- switcher is not a common enough concept (term).  New readers are likely to look for tab code sample on switcher  page. \n@zzseba78,\nI understand and appreciate your thoughtful comment about the need to read and learn.  Please keep in mind that when I encounter  uk-tab the first time I am at pre-learning stage; I am trying to determine if I should invest time and energy to learn ui-kit.  As you must realize, there are a lot of frameworks out there.  We don't have to time and energy to learn all of them.  Most, nearly all, of uikit code sample are great. Just happens that my typical first \"screening\" component is tab because few frameworks offer really good tab.  uk-tab is better than most.  However, the code samples on uk-tab are not as complete enough.   Because you pointed my to switcher-and-tab, I think I should invest the time to learn uikit and the readings that comes with learning.\n@aarongerig, \n- I failed to see the reference to \" just watch a video \" or \"learn a whole (frontend) framework\" from my comment.\n- I am pointing specifically to the uk-tab not  UIkit docs  in general.  I did say \"More than 90% of the code samples are great. \"\n-  Where I came from,  \"RTFM\" a.k.a. \"Read The Fucking Man Page\". \n. @florianletsch, I appreciate your thoughtful and informative comments.   I spent significant amount of time commenting here (and https://gitter.im/uikit/uikit) is because I think uikit (the freamework and document) is better than most CSS frameworks out there.  With very little effort, adding existed code samples to the tab page, will enable new site visitors to get to know uikit with less effort, . @florianletsch, here are some thoughts (comments) related to your \"So, I suggest\" section with \"time is limited\" in mind.\n\n\nCurrently, uikit docs offers sufficient (or very close to sufficient) number of code samples.  Placing code samples on the same page as the UI component (without increasing number of samples) would be helpful. \n\n\nIn programming setting, many (some, most) of CSS framework target user are likely to be more proficient in code languages (CSS, HTML, JS, etc.) than in English.  Therefore, \n\n\nshowing code sample of a UI component (with resulting screen short or preview, like uikit docs are doing) is likely to be more effective (and require less effort from the user) than describing the UI components in English or screen casts.  I suspect that a typical CSS framework target user can understand   switcher-and-tab example with previews in around one minute; and would take longer with English description or a screen cast.\n\n\nthe focus of code samples is less about \"Getting Started\" vs. \"intermediate, advance\" code samples; it is more about demonstrating multiple (nearly all) usages of a UI component.  Using tab as can example, the multiple usages may include horizontal, vertical, responsive, font setting, content display types (li, dev) etc. \n\n\nmost CSS framework target users know what UI features to look for.  They just need to see (and re-reference) the syntax for the particular (new) framework for implementing the mostly known (familiar) UI features. uikit docs is one of the best examples that I know of that offers one document that serves as introductory and reference docs.  Given the target user and the nature of CSS framework, I think the current structure of uikit docs is great.  Foundation is a counter example.  Foundation uses a lot of screen casts.  Viewing the screen casts is time consuming.  Reference back to the code samples is hopeless. \n\n\ntab is a UI component.  switcher is not really a UI component; switcher appears to be more of a very useful utility feature, (function, capability, helper) of number of UI components.   switcher appears to be documented as if it was a UI component;  A user new to uikit (not new to coding) likely knows to look for a UI components (e.g., tab), and know to look for typical (and special) tab features; BUT not know enough to look for switcher.  Therefore, all tab code samples should appear on tab page.  \n\n\nIn short, by mostly repurposing existing code samples can go a long way to enable new site visitors to get to know uikit with less effort; without putting significant time and effort in crating new samples and screen casts.\n.

I pulled the master copy and it's still not working well.. Why does UIkit pre-define the font-family for headings and navbar? I think it's better to leave it blank or as default. So people who wants to use specific font can just define it globally.\nPeople who want different font for headings and navs can simply define them by themselves.. I agree that a lot of projects require different font settings on body and headings, what I'm suggesting is UIkit to not pre-define the font family for these tags. As even if developers want to set different font for different tags, they will certainly not use the font UIkit pre-defined, so they will have to change it anyway.\nSo why wasting time pre-define something that most users will have to change anyway, whether they want to use different fonts for body and navs or not.. Yes, you are right, I was referring to the CSS version. Most of my project are simple one page site, and I just quote the css/js from the CDN without hosting them. And most cases, I will have to override the font-family in my own style, and have to list all tags that have pre-defined fonts, which is somehow annoying..

I'm looking forward for this feature too.. Hi.\nI don't think this is an issue. You should clear the default margin first and use the utility classes. There's no need to declare or overwrite the uk-align-left css class.\nhttps://getuikit.com/docs/margin#remove-margin\nEdit:\n\nThere's also a helper for padding (just in case).\nhttps://getuikit.com/docs/padding#remove-padding\nWhile not related but rather a heads up, if you use the navbar <a>, you will notice an extra horizontal padding, this is by design. You should remove it manually using the uk-remove-padding-horizontal class if you don't like it.\nThank you.. Hi.\nI don't think there's a need to bloat the icon js. Not everyone needs all the things you want for their projects. While, UIKit3 is good enough as a starter framework, you may want to extend it to suite your project specifically. For example, if you need a \"basket\" icon, why not head over to icomoon app? You'll have plenty of choices there and use exactly what you need and minimize your file size in general. P/s: I don't endorse nor promoting the app, it somehow just related to this question as an alternative workaround.\nI never like the UIKit3 icons anyway, they are too light for my taste and the positioning isn't quite well arrange (in comparison to FA5 svg js).\nThank you.. Hello.\nIf you read this, you can actually style the select form to your liking and limited only by your own creativity. For example, the codes below will give you the following result:\n<div class=\"uk-margin\">\n    <div uk-form-custom=\"target: > * > span:last-child\">\n        <select>\n            <option value=\"1\">Option 01</option>\n            <option value=\"2\">Option 02</option>\n            <option value=\"3\">Option 03</option>\n            <option value=\"4\">Option 04</option>\n        </select>\n        <button class=\"uk-button uk-button-default uk-form-width-medium uk-text-capitalize uk-text-left uk-padding-remove\" type=\"button\" tabindex=\"-1\">\n            &nbsp;&nbsp;<span uk-icon=\"tag\"></span>\n            <span></span>\n        </button>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nAs for the textarea, I'm not sure why you want to logically do this. I've never seen any UI/UX designers add an inline icon to a textarea element due to it having multiple lines. It just doesn't make sense since it will eat up valuable real estate. Somehow, this topic is rather subjective. You can try a workaround but that will require extra CSS or even JS hacks.\n\nThank you.. Hello.\nI think that should be the intended UX design since the input element is currently \"on focus\" (where uk-tooltip is declared). However, you can still create a clickable icon inside the input element to act as a tooltip placeholder if you prefer it to disappear on input loose focus. You can see the example here,\nhttps://codepen.io/rangka_kacang/pen/Yadrza\nThank you.. Hello.\nJust for the record, I'm not a part of uikit official team. This is just my personal point of view. Logically, the tooltip will be shown if the input is currently focused (where uk-tooltip is declared). That's because if you use a mobile device and touch on the input, it will fire the tooltip and the tooltip will stay because technically, you can't hover or \"mouseover\" on an element (in this case the input) when you are not using a \"mouse\" since you only want the tooltip to be shown on hover not on focus. I hope that makes sense in a user experience perspective.\nHowever, you can still hack this with some additional javascript but since you want to keep your code simple, you might want this to be included in the next release so you should tag your title as a feature request instead. I think this should be an easy hack (jQuery has a workaround or hide the tooltip in smaller devices) since there's a native tooltip hide function but I'm no-javascript-geek so, I couldn't help much here.\nThank you.. Duplicate of #3340\nReference #2421. Because you are asking to bloat the icon js not everyone need what you need. Your problem does not rely in the core but can easily be solved by extending it yourself. This is uikit not another fontawesome clone.. Closing this due to unpopular request.\nEdit: I'm now using VSC again.... I think this has something to do with the animation timing/queue. I wonder who click \"sidebar 2\" as soon (milliseconds) as they click on \"sidebar 1\". Nevertheless, it's a cool bug. Let's see what the contributors say about this. It will happen the other way around to if \"sidebar 2\" already showing and click \"sidebard 2 + sidebar 1\" soon after.. I beg to differ.\nAs we all know, this is a front-end framework and not a ready-made template.\nAs far as I'm concern, the use case scenario is totally subjective and up to the authors' creativity to implement the way they prefer. I don't think it is necessary for the \"official team\" to provide such examples to avoid the community being \"mainstream\" or be made as \"guideline\".\nTake this (purely UIkit 3) \"dashboard\" and look at the sidebar menu for instance:\n1. https://zzseba78.github.io/Kick-Off/dashboard.html\n2. https://codepen.io/rangka_kacang/pen/Yadrza\nAs you can see, with the power of the core framework itself - one can easily create whatever they want easily. It's all in your imagination (and a little research). It is really fun! Don't follow examples, create your own solutions to your problems and you will appreciate UIkit 3 more, I guarantee...\nGood luck!.

So maybe it is just my problem. In the end, it seems that the problem is related to the container change: when the final container changes, no icon is displayed. However, I have not yet been able to repeat it in CodePen.\nSo, for me, only the modalsplaced on the body, or those in which I explicitly established the goal of the container, were working.\nWORKS:\n```html\n\n\n ... \n\n\n\n\n ... \n\n\n**FAILS:**html\n\n\n ... \n\n\n\n\n ... \n\n\n```.

I think I may have found my issue was with webpack loading my css. It looks like the script was running before the css was loaded, so the height of the navbar was determined before css was established. Not sure if that can or should be fixed.. FYI it doesnt seem ideal, however I was able to get it working by removing all uk- and data-uk- attributes from all react render() functions and moving the UIKit initialization to the componentDidMount() function in the react component. This way the UIKit rendering only occurs client side\nI also had to not import UIKit at the top but pull it in only when needed.

Please ignore this... just tested with 3.0.0-beta.42 ad it works..

Using the \"modern transparent pattern\" the src attribute point to the image as usual (not to the lightweight placeholder), thus the markup is W3C valid, SEO friendly, screen reader friendly, javascript disabled friendly, search bots that not handle javascript (or has poor support) friendly implementing in this way a perfect graceful degradation/fallback.\nThe trick is the presence of the srcset standard attribute that point to an inline (so no extra http request) small transparent gif image and this force all modern browsers to use this image and IGNORE the src value (so lazy load become possible).\n.

    "ijcd": "I'll get a new trace with the version number. For now, this was suggested from the unpoly developers:\nhttps://github.com/unpoly/unpoly/issues/58#issuecomment-380376650\n\nI'm not familiar with UIKit, so I can only guess:\nIt looks like UIKit is using MutationObserver to run JavaScript whenever an element enters or leaves the DOM. Unpoly replacements manipulate the DOM, so UIKit JavaScript will run when Unpoly changes anything.\nThe stack trace above shows that you're using the up-keep attribute. To process up-keep elements, Unpoly needs to temporarily detach keepable elements from the DOM. It looks like UIKit runs its JavaScript on detached elements, but crashes because it cannot find the element's scrolling viewport (to measure scroll positions or something).\nThe major change in Unpoly 0.50+ is that we're now using native promises instead of jQuery deferreds. This means that async code now runs in the next microtask instead of the next task. This may have changed the order in which async code in Unpoly and UIKit is scheduled.\nYou could try to make your app work without [up-keep], but it doesn't change the underlying issue that UIKit seems to assume that it is the only code working with the DOM.\n\n.

    "mthomsonnz": "Hi I haven't found a solution to this yet. @aarongerig I'm developing a Joomla gallery extension that is listed on the Joomla extensions directory, UIkit is one of the libraries that I'm using. My extension has to work in any website using bootstrap etc... @aarongerig For the gallery extension, it will be downloaded as a plugin, as used (hopefully) in hundreds of joomla websites and in the future wordpress sites. So the plugin needs to be installed through the joomla/wordpress installer and work out of the box in the sites current website. I'm not doing custom work on single website, I'm making a package that is intended to work on hundreds of websites.\nI'm using the build tasks to only use some parts of uikit, so I'm not using it as a framework, just some components for some parts of the gallery.. with my extension I am packaging some uikit components with a unique prefix, so it is not an extra framework, just some javascript to do a gallery. If I used another library like slick or owl carousel it would be the same amount of javascript. With the jquery ui tabs, this is just a working example, there are many ways that elements are hidden on page load and shown later, ideally the slideshow will display in all of these cases. This is the core issue, my code pen is just an example.. I think we are misunderstanding each other here :) I don't use jquery tabs at all, this is not the issue. I just used jquery tabs for my code pen example. My gallery script could go into any number of tabs, or sliders, or parts of the page that appear or disappear on some kind of click. There could be 100 different situations where this happens (eg every joomla and wordpress template developer have there or own way of implementing show/hide). Writing custom code (like your example) for every type of tab/slider extension isn't a solution in this case. I have been looking over the uikit code to try and see where/how it could detect that its parent has gone display:block, but I can't see the solution yet.. Yes I was looking at that exact line too :) The only workaround I can think of is polling the slideshow div for style changes, but that is a last resort. It seems a display:block change doesn't fire a resize event. Maybe one of the other uikit developers knows a way around this. If I have to I will poll, but I hate resorting to that kind of solution.. This is the best workaround I could find. I don't like doing ugly solutions like polling, but I can't see any other way in this situation. Hopefully someone else can suggest something better, in the short term this works for me:\n```\n$('.slideshow-wrapper').each(function(index,el)\n{\n    var lastVisible = $(el).is(':visible');\n    if(!lastVisible)\n    {\n        //hide any hidden tab slideshows so they don't show with no image on tab show event\n        $(el).css('visibility','hidden');\n    }\nfunction checkIfVisibleChanged()\n{\n    var visibleNow = $(el).is(':visible');\n\n    if(visibleNow != lastVisible)\n    {\n        //event: the tab with this slideshow has been shown\n        if(visibleNow)\n        {\n            $(el).resize();\n            UIkit.update($(el));\n            //show the slideshow now that the tab is shown and the update is done \n            setTimeout(function(){$(el).css('visibility','visible');}, 200);\n        }\n        //event: the tab wiith this slideshow has been hidden\n        else\n        {\n            $(el).css('visibility','hidden');\n        }\n\n        lastVisible = visibleNow;\n    }\n}\n\n//check to see if the elements visibility has changed every 1/4 of a second, nooooo polling sucks!\nsetInterval(checkIfVisibleChanged, 250);\n\n});\n```\n. Ok I understand. I can use the camel case, but I think new users of the library might have difficulty. If they miss this part of the docs they will find it difficult, as usually you look for an option name in the list of options and copy and paste it. Maybe in a future version there could be just 1 way to call an option.. ",

    "andy-blum": "Late to the party here, but I'd also like to commend the uikit team for a fantastic product. I'm one of the maintainers for the Drupal theme implementation of UIKit and we LOVE the theme.\nI am curious if there is any rough idea when v3 will be upgraded from RC to a full release. Any ballpark dates there?. This is good to know and works well for one-off icons, but I'm thinking of a more flexible way to handle a large variety of icons.\nSpecifically, I'm thinking about ways to utilize other icon libraries such as FontAwesome. I have been using their sprite files to include all their icons in my projects and then I can use them (or more specifically my clients can use them via the CMS) hassle-free.\nRight now, I'm utilizing the uk-svg attribute to pull specific symbols from the sprite files, but it doesn't allow the use of ratio and it attempts to load in the SVG automatically at the size of that symbol's viewbox. It's usable, but there's a lot of work that needs each project.\nWhat I'd look for more is the ability to do something like this:\n1) Have a folder full of svg icons or a single svg with a bunch of symbols in it.\n2) Call something like  <span uk-icon=\"icon:custom; path:path/to/icon.svg#symbol;\"></span> and have UIKit scale that SVG up or down to match the size of the included icons.\nThanks for the help with the icon.add() code. Fingers crossed we can get something similar to the above in UIKit 3.x sometime soon!. ",

Making the following change to the node_modules/uikit/src/js/icons.js script will make this work without copying the script, and from my limited testing will not break anything else:\n``\n14c14\n<             util.compile('src/js/icons.js',dist/js/uikit-icons-${name}`, {name, replaces: {ICONS}})\n\n\n\n        util.compile(`${__dirname}/../src/js/icons.js`, `dist/js/uikit-icons-${name}`, {name, replaces: {ICONS}})\n\n4. run `node node_modules/uikit/build/icons.js --custom=\"assets/icons\"` to build your icons, this will create a `dist/js/uikit-icons-assets.js` file at your root directory.\n5. Use the newly created file, I use this through webpack, so I do this like so:\nconst UIkit = require('uikit');\n\nconst uikit_icons = require('uikit/dist/js/uikit-icons');\nconst custom_icons = require('dist/js/uikit-icons-assets.js');\nUIkit.use(uikit_icons);\nUIkit.use(custom_icons);\n```\nTested on uikit 3.0.3.
