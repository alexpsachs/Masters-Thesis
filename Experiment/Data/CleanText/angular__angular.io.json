However, I don't want folks to exit the flow on this page to github. The the next CTA will be geared toward viewing the guide in order to continue the learning process. \nWe have already given top billing to \"Contribute\" in the main navigation. It's now one of only 4 links in the navigation (25%) which I think it exceptionally high priority given the real estate. \nThat said, perhaps there is a more subtle way to include something like this. I'm going to close this pull for now but play around with designs ideas that could work for incorporating something like this. Again, great idea, l'll def play around with this. \n. Thanks @kennethormandy I'm sure it will. Appreciate you sharing this :+1: \n. @gorork Here's another one. We don't currently have print styles for the site. \n. What type of videos, you have some examples? Gracias! \n. hmm, seems to be working now\n\n. fix in branch, added favicon \n. Thanks for the heads up! This was addressed in another branch updating the bios. \n. @kwalrath live \n. Fixed has been deployed \n. @naomiblack is this branch still valid? Should we close this. \n. fix in branch \n. @gorork this is very nice, thank you for the help. I'll tag you when my branch is in and we push the directives out, I'll likely incorporate your handy work.

Thanks. \n. @btford good point, I'll put some documentation in the style guide then close this when it's ready. \n. +1 we'll have to create our own custom filter. Haven't found a good one for this yet. \n. https://angular.io/docs/styleguide.html\nAdded to code examples now in styleguide :) \n. @btford I would say we should lead with the recommended but provide both. It's ultimately a developers choice how they want to roll. Our job is not to enforce but to guide. I've user tested this type of thing extensively (sudo vs non sudo) and it causes some serious issues if you don't have both (people simply fail). We cannot assume a developers level of experience with best practices etc. many are beginners. \nOn a personal note, yes non sudo is a much better way to roll. However, UX wise I've seen this fail too many times. \n. Updated readme to lead with non sudo install and added or sudo... depending on your permissions. \n. @btford I think the best thing is for us to just link to the harp js site. Will take all of the responsibility off of us, I can update the readme to just point there, ie install harp.js etc. \nThere was a breaking change in harp's latest version so we hard versioned on harp@v0.15.2\nI plan on fixing the bug this weekend and will this should go away and we can use the latest. \n. nice catch :eyes: \n. should be fixed now\n. @kwalrath live :+1: \n. @btford this will change in the future, temporary hold over since the pages are not mirroring right now. \n.

This is not a primary button (download) and should not be styled or emphasized the same way as a primary action (learn). It's possible to use a darker shade of the \"blue grey\" material design to increase the contrast ratio of the secondary button. This button should not be emphasized the same way though so please start with lighter (less heavy) shades of blue great. Thanks. \n. These changes look awesome. Please merged forward so there are not conflicts with master and I'll get this in. \ud83d\udc4d \n. @jackmu95 Just had one small change that's needed and it's ready. Thanks again for the help. \n. @jackmu95 Yah, I like that idea on hover. If you wanna add that it would be great. Can you use the new color vars.

But we could be talking about a different thing? Send me a screen shot of the culprit in slack and I'll make short work of it ;) \ud83d\udc4d \n. @Foxandxss ahh, I see the problem. Something didn't come through right. Going to fix this and push again to this branch. They should def not be that light, something got messed up with the merge with master. \n. @Foxandxss ok, fixed :) they look the way the are supposed to now (like headings you can see). Thanks for the heads up, not sure how/why my original changes got squashed but we should be good to go now. \ud83d\udc4d \n. @chalin @Foxandxss good catch, the title should def be \"Quickstart\", my fault guys. :P\n. Believe it or not it will actually reduce the contrast ratio (since bg color will be a darker gray). So for accessibility, the color is better at .56. \nAny specific reason to change it (preference is a valid option btw :) ) \n. @ericjim Ahhh, good catch. Can you simply apply it to the mobiles styles? Otherwise I can do it today (will be tinkering around today anyway). Let me know. \n. @ericjim perfect \ud83d\udc4d Thanks for fixing this! \n. \ud83d\udc4d  thanks for the help. \n. @naomiblack so apparently this bug is caused by a conflict of some sort between angular and swyftype, I've confirmed this on my local env. I'll continued to dig in and let you know when I have a fix. Installed 2.0 and have it working locally as well. \n. Ok, closing this one. Reopen if you feel like we haven't addressed it. \n. One this is merge, give me a heads up and I can do a reindexing. \n. @naomiblack I can do something to make this less jarring . Hey @IgorMinar I addressed your comments. In terms of the X-frame origin error, that is a setting that needs to be adjust on the site (Firebase). It should be set to: \nX-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM https://www.google.com \nwhere that option is available. . @IgorMinar Updated the firebase.json with the new x-frame options allowing google. Looks like the search worked either way but agree it's preferable not to have these errors. . @IgorMinar Hmm, not seeing the Nexus 5 issue, I'm using chromes browser to test with the Nexus 5 setting. Can you send me a screen shot of what you're seeing? Attaching what I see currently: \n\n. @IgorMinar Ok Just pushed an update to the branch. I've included an example of what the page should look like if the user clicks on the ... button for the contributors. You can view the footer on the ngFor Directive page to see an example. . :+1: nice catch ;) \n. I think you should just replace the entire containers on the install page with the cards instead of putting them inside the card module. You should then be able to remove these extras styles.

A few comments:\n1) we specifically chose the red D for directives to make them the most prominent. The dark blue and placement for decorators as first in the list gives them too much visual prominence relative to the others.

Hi @valorkin -- Ward is right that this doesn't fit in the quickstart, but I am happy to see you have a module to share and we'll be working on a section about best practices for third party modules soon. Would you be interested in helping to write it?\ncc @IgorMinar \n. Thanks! merged.\n. thanks! merged.\n. Thanks! merged.\n. Thanks! merged.\n. sorry -- I missed this back in Jan -- but would have declined. I would prefer to keep this page for news rather than promos.\n. I'm not going to merge this because we've explicitly decided not to provide a tertiary nav for angular.io. But I'm curious to see it on your site. \n. I would prefer not to list Material 2 on the contribute page, as we're not set up for additional contributors, but the link fix for material 1 is good\n. I like where you're headed with the expandos, but I'd like to spend some design time on making them look good. The \"Why\" button isn't quite right. I don't want to merge this in without some professional styling and animation -- but the mechanics of it are great. Let's hold off on this PR for a bit.\nThe banner align on the resize is now off-kilter with respect to the sidenav buttons. The banner is already on my design to-do list. I've nudged it as far as I'm comfortable with for now. Please don't spend more time on banner adjusts.\n\n. Give me a couple of days, Ward, I'm on it.\nI hear you, but I don't want to just throw a button up there. \n. Some issues that still need to be resolved:\n- You're using a button here to open the expanded content, but once it's expanded, the button label is still \"why\" -- that doesn't make any sense with the text open. The label on the button should change when the text is expanded. or try using md-dialog for this instead? \n- text labels, instead of \"why\" should give some indication of what's behind the expando\n- instead of button, use md-button(class='md-primary')\n- align the button left a bit farther so it is flush with the code examples\n- when the text section is open, add some more padding below it. It's not clear where the expanded bit finishes and the next bit of body text begins. it would be helpful to also indent it farther from the left margin so it's clear this is separate from the main body\n- the grey background used on the inset text in sub-section style is identical to code background color, causing code samples on these to be lost. \n- sometimes this is used for really big blocks of text, sometimes for short asides. it seems like overkill to use this just to hide a one or two-line aside. let's keep it for larger digressions.\nI worked on the text labels and material designified the buttons, here, but I'm still not happy with this PR from the pov of the user who needs the extra handholding. For the user who wants to speed through, it's great, but I think we've lost something that served the newbie well and perhaps gone too far in the other direction.\n. Until I have a real web designer I can lean on to improve the interaction problems of how the expando works, I think a single switch might be the way to go for now. We could apply some light styling, maybe create a new .l-verbose-section class to apply some light shading or other minimal visual indicator to show the diffs. And then give readers a \"jump to the brief version\" escape hatch back from the verbose one.\nI like the way we do this on our internal codelab docs, but I don't have the time or skill to build it. Would rather take a simple approach to the immediate need to simplify the QS, and then iterate on doing expandos later.\n. This left nav is looking good but something strange has happened to the height of the blue and grey banners (hero style). also check spelling. \"API Peview\" and \"Dependancy\" should be fixed.\nCookbooks should be their own section below the Dev Guide.\n. This looks ok to ship as an interim solution while we work on expandos. Like the thinner sidebar lines.\n. I like the new switcher. Make it so! Also, thank you for fixing the styleguide issue here.\n. I think this is looking good... ship and iterate!\n. closing -- will address via edits.\n. @ericjim I merged in a1678e5 but still see the flicker.\n. fixed!\n. Please note that we do not yet have hooks for the Stable / Draft / Deprecated indicator output by dgeni, and I think we still need to figure out how to make \"Improve This Doc\" work. @IgorMinar @petebacondarwin.\n. Updating with status for others. I ran this past @mhevery -- @howtouse etc sounds fine. We'll start by updating ng-Switch and trying it out.\nOne concern is that we'll need to update the Dart transformers to correctly output this for the Dart version of the API docs. Could you keep a list of the new annotations that you add so it's easy for me to get them all in one update later?\n. @petebacondarwin @wardbell I'm not sure if this is dgeni or a drop-down issue... could you have a look?\n. Thank you!!!\n. closed in 0fdceec96342aef96f63cbb8dfb2696365ba7488 which updates to the latest version of harp, with fix from @jvandemo and @sintaxi. THANK YOU!\n. Thanks for your pull request. It looks like this may be your first contribution to a Google open source project.

Thanks.\nIf you've already signed a CLA, it's possible we don't have your GitHub username or you're using a different email address. Check your existing CLA data and verify that your email is set on your git commits.\nIf you signed the CLA as a corporation, please let us know the company's name.\n. Thanks! I've merged your change. Appreciate it. :)\n. Thanks -- this is a good change -- it also makes it easier to work offline. @eeandrew Could you sign the Google CLA please? This is essential in order for us to accept your PR.\nSeparately, I'm working on a project to localize the docs to Chinese, which would involve hosting all the content on a more China-friendly server. Would you be interested in contributing to that effort? :)\n. Please see angular.cn and http://github.com/angular/angular-cn -- I think this addresses your concern as it's hosted in China.\n. See https://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/1181 with some extensive copyedits\n. @johnpapa @wardbell @thelgevold is this ready to merge? seems like maybe...\n. @wardbell this looks good to me -- I won't have time to merge it until late today. If convenient, could you merge and verify with check-deploy? (but no rush if you are swamped)\n. Merged and live!\n. on further reflection, I think we need to have four states: stable / experimental / deprecated / undefined.\nCould you create both @stable and @experimental and then make the default (undefined) show no button at all? that gives us space to go through the API surface incrementally, and saves us from accidentally making something experimental look \"done\".\n@IgorMinar  FYI\n. #1118 is closed now! :)\n.

We should make it clear to the user that this is a filtered list, but I don't think we want a full button on the APIs page for it.\nI need this to link to from the security doc... \n. I'd like to do (1) re: @amitafr, but I am worried that the design will get visually overloaded really quickly.\n. We could also order the entries in the list by \"stable\" and \"unstable\" with a visual separator between them (maybe unstable get grey background)\nNote though that content has states: stable, experimental, deprecated, and not-defined -- not-defined means we haven't reviewed it yet! \n. merged. live!\n. merged. live!\n. live and in master.\n. paging @alexwolfe -- would love some design input from you if you have any thoughts\n. live and in master.\n. live and in master.\n.

Also @StephenFluin for help with a final review while Ward is out.\nI'm happy to push live when it is.\n. merged!\n. I'd like to adjust the tone a bit to avoid high-level direction to the reader \"We strongly recommend consulting a security expert at strategic moments in the project timeline.\" feels a bit pejorative, like \"go find a grown-up\", and it's not clear who \"we\" or \"a security expert\" are. Instead, use something like \"Securing a server is a complex topic beyond the scope of this guide. Here are some Angular-specific tips to help you get started.\" that sticks to the facts.\nAlso be careful of ambiguous \"we\", e.g.\nIn this chapter we focus on an important part of the security story: ensuring the safety and security of the content we display and the user input we accept.\nThe authorial \"we focus on\" is fine, but \"the content we display\" is unclear -- who is displaying the content? \"ensuring the safety and security of the content displayed by an application, and the user input that it accepts\".\n. I had a look on my dev server and noticed some markdown errors and inline comments. Can we polish this up to publish for RC2?\n. This PR has both public/docs/ts/latest/guide/content-security.jade and public/docs/ts/latest/guide/content-security.md -- I think .md is an error and should be deleted? Can @wardbell confirm?\n. obsolete.\n. this is in master\n. is this something we can fix in dgeni, or do we need to un-lint-format these entries in the API itself?\n. merged and fixed! thank you so much @petebacondarwin \n. merged and live!\n. @Foxandxss is this ready to merge?\n. merged, live.\n. +1 for using JSON for the localized site\n. merged and live!\n. merged and live!\n. @stevemasta34 I can't accept this fix without a CLA (I know, it's tiny...)

In the meantime, I'll add you to our localization chat on Slack so you can find out how we're doing this for other languages.\nCommunity members: If you're interested in contributing to the localization project for Korean, please comment here and let us know how to reach you!\n. @onyoon7 I sent you an invite, but I am not certain that it worked.

The text talks about creating a main.ts file, but I suppose technically, the es5 example would be called main.js. I think this probably belongs in a note before the first code-box, something like \"Although we work through the examples here in TypeScript, you can also use regular ES5. Click the ES5 link in any code box to see the ES5 JavaScript version. Note that in ES5, you'd want to name your files .js rather than .ts.\"\n. L124 should comment out the reference to Plunker\n. add Note: in es5, this would be called show-properties.js\n. L139 es5 comes first. should be swapped so ts example is first.\n. L164: should that just say \"the angular For directive\" to be consistent with the new TS example?\n. If\n. not new in this change, but is the backtick on L21 and L24 correct? Looks like a typo\n. this will be 41 within 24 hours\n. I removed this heading deliberately. There's already a heading above it that says \"Security\" from the site template.\n. should actually by AoT\n. should be JiT\n. This is taking a little too much away. It's important for the reader to know why they are entering the command.\n. Using \"here\" is a deliberate choice (earlier drafts did say \"by convention\"). We don't want to impose a convention on the user that Angular itself doesn't enforce. \nWhat a developer calls the root component is their call.\n. This is useful to know, but belongs in the TOH rather than here. The QuickStart is just a quick limited scope demo. We'll teach concepts later.\n. @robwormald @StephenFluin Ward is proposing a restructure to create the component before the module in this doc flow. I think we did it the other way for pedagogical reasons... Can you have a look and comment please?\n. agreed, but we would rather not make it a requirement called out this strongly.\n. \"ogling\" has one g. Otherwise, LGTM!. Let's just call it plunker. \"People know what it is (we've told them). You can run the live example of the app in plunker and download the code from there.\". ",

Hell all,\nRight now we're waiting on TypeScript 1.5 which will have the features needed to fully drop AtScript in Angular 2.\nThe example in the quickstart will be valid TypeScript once 1.5 releases. The only change that will be needed is dropping the traceur/es6-shim setup in favor of the TypeScript compiler. The code should stay the same.\nOnce TypeScript 1.5 releases we'll update the quickstart. Until then it's not completely truthful to use TypeScript in the code samples.\n.

I would like to understand the \"resistance\" to using links more. Sounds\nlike security via obscurity to me (since once you click the button the link\nwill be exposed anyway).\n\nDo you know what's the real intention here?\nAs for material, in v1 they allow  which internally\nuses an anchor. in v2 they will also allow  style\nof creating buttons.

I think my point is that buttons should never just tell the router to\nnavigate somewhere on click as the only thing they do. If that's the only\nthing they do then you should use anchors instead.\n\n\nIf however button executes an action (e.g. save a form) and then they\nnavigate somewhere, you should not use anchors.\nThe way I think about this is when I would use GET vs POST in the old days\nwhen building a form that does a full page reload. GET = [routeLink] and\nPOST = (click). And if you don't remember, GET should be used for all\nidempotent actions and POST/DELETE/PUT/PATCH should be used for all\nnon-idempotent actions.\nOn Tue, Mar 29, 2016 at 12:48 PM Ward Bell notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nIt is hard for me to explain the resistance because I don't always find\nthe reasons all that compelling.\nFor example, many say that deep-linking into your bank account isn't\nsomething they want to encourage. Maybe this is faux security.\nI've heard a UX reason that aligns with resistance to the old MDI paradigm\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_document_interface: users get\nlost when there are a bunch of open windows into the app ... some of which\nthey forget to close.\nThese kinds of reasons motivated one client to avoid the router altogether\nin their A1 app. Navigation was controlled entirely through traditional\nmenus and buttons.

I think it's better to error on the side of overusing anchors than\nunderusing them. Links/anchors is what makes the web work. Having a few\nextra links is not a big deal from UX perspective, not having them does\nimpact UX in a big way.\n\nI just read Georgios' comment and I think we think alike.

I think this PR is good.\n\nI'll have my team take it from here and we'll contact you if we find any issues during the integration work to into the new app.\nThanks again.. just to clarify - we are NOT going to merge this repo because we worked on just mocks. I'll keep this PR open until we copy all the contents over to angular/angular where the new app is being built.. resolved: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/20758#issuecomment-348789315. resolved: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/20758#issuecomment-348789315. undo\n. clear -> clearly\n. shouldn't this be updated with the index.ts info which change the import to from './speakers'?\n. I'm confused about how are you avoiding naming collisions. ES module system is designed to prevent name collisions.\n. the conventions themselves should be unique? unique for each project or each file? that sounds a bit counter-productive to our goal. :)\n. public functions -> public methods\nprivate functions -> private methods\nwhat does \"not spread through the component code\" mean?\n. also keep in mind that ES6 doesn't have property initializers yet. So unless you are using some custom babel plugins, you'll have to initialize the properties in the constructor.\n. is it intentional that public properties are below private properties? with methods the order is reversed.\n. this sounds weird to me. In my mind there are two kinds of components:\n1/ routable components that are usually very application specific and are not meant to be reused even within the application.\n2/ reusable components (application agnostic ones as buttons, or the whole material suite, and application-specific ones like profile/product widgets with pop-overs, etc).\nthe purpose of the service is to facilitate data delivary to these components\n. functions -> methods?\n. well, not quite. services are singletons within the same injector - you can think about each element in the component composition tree as having it's own injector and each element inherits injector services from the parent.\nbut if a child element defines a provider for a service that was already defined an instantiated in the parent, the DI will create a new instance of this service visible only to this child component and its children. This is what allows you to have multiple instance of certain services (e.g. ElementRef is different for each component) and we don't need the concept of \"locals\" from Angular 1.\n. Maybe we should even before this section introduce the concept of component hierarchies as a separate recommendation. Everything in an Angular app is based on this single concept (the component composition, routing, di, directory structure, lazy-loading, compilation units....).\nThe general guidance for creating reusable components or defining providers should be that they should be created at the level of deepest common parent. This sets the visibility of that component or service instance within the application tree.\n. $http is no more :)\n. ^ -> +\n. ^ -> +\n. why are you repeating yourself? this is the same as line 548. no?\n. \"every single commit\" sounds a bit dramatic and it's not really true. we run tests on PRs which can contain multiple commits.\n. functionalities -> features\n. \"here under\" -> below\n. \"are the ones which, others may be required for your application\" - what do you mean by this? I don't understand. can you rephrase? \n. \"on top\" -> \"In addition\"\n. is the double space after span intentional? \n. really? what requires typed arrays?\n. \"Optional browser features to polyfill\" - isn't this more accurate? the list above doesn't list polyfills but feature that should be polyfilled.\n. the same for Blob and FormData - they are not really needed unless you are using particular browser features in your app at which point you are responsible for figuring out what polyfills you need. none of these should be used directly by angular's code unless I'm missing something.\n. both stability and security fields can contain free-form text. we should escape those too.\n. yeah. I agree but I didn't know how to do it in a template :) I left a comment on your pr\n. please add a comment about what this does\n. I intentionally didn't make this \"Only Experimental\" because that's too long and gets clipped in the dropdown menu.\n. can you remove the swifty script? we shouldn't load it if we are not using it any more.. if we no longer need this css we should delete them. otherwise it's unclear why they are just commented out.\nif we do need them we should add a comment why this is being commented out temporarily and what action is being taken to uncomment this and by whom.. delete?. delete?. delete?.

The testing series is in flux and on the backburner at the moment due to other priorities but expect it to get some love in December. It's not wrong as far as it goes. But it is weak.  Sorry for the inconvenience.\n. Yes ... source code is coming ... when the Testing section is finished. Sorry for the delay. I hope something is better than nothing.\n. A) The best current source of the ToH is in John's repo\nB) Rado's fork is interesting but not what we'll use.\nC) No, ToH is not the source of the testing chapters. The testing source is on one my \"private\" repos at the moment. FWIW, ToH is actually derived from the source from my testing chapter ... which shows you how long THAT has been in the works.\nWe've had to put the testing chapter on hold while we work on higher priority docs. I will get it done this year or ... or ... well I don't know .. .something horrible.\n. Keep watching and fixing. It helps.\n. Closing because the entire topic is being overhauled in the next week or two.\n. Good catch. Should accept PR\n. I agree and I believe this is non-controversial.\n. There seems to be some remaining debate within the #309 .  Would you please clarify if that debate has been resolved and this PR should be accepted.\n. My bad in my instructions. \nThat gulp task rebuilds everything ... including the API docs which require access to the angular2 source code repo. The task assumes/requires that a clone of that repo reside under that name in a sibling folder to your angular.io clone.\nYou don't have to clone one level above (which would bring down a ton of irrelevant stuff). Just clone angular into a neighboring folder once and carry on.\nDon't have a better way right now. Welcome suggestions.\n. Don't sweat it. I didn't mean just that. I think the whole doc could be more clear. But it is mostly for us so I'm not worrying about it.\n. The revision in this commit is still not as clear as it could and should be but it is correct and much better than what we have now. Therefore, I'm accepting it.\n. Checking with Jay (when he gets back).\n. Thanks!\n. We are using npm instead of cdn in TS for at least two reasons\n1. Ensures can run even the network is poor or unavailable.\n2.

You are right.  OTOH, there is a large issue that concerns us.\nThis part of the code isn't an important point for the tour ... more of a distraction really. We want to keep the reader's eyes on the prize. My instinct is that your solution adds complexity without much _Angular 2_ insight. Perhaps we'd better off saying ...\n\nWe've created an array of Heroes that are structural equivalent to an instance of the Hero class which is good enough for our tour.\n\nOr perhaps we should give the Hero class a ctor and rewrite this to instantiate Hero instances?\nI want to think about it. I'm leaving this open while I do. \nThat said, thanks for your close reading of the text and thoughtful comment. We need that kind of help.\nKeep your eyes on this and see how we decide.\nAnd keep those suggestions coming.\n. Also ... you've only seen the first two chapters of the tutorial.  The Hero class becomes more important as the app evolves. \nThat you haven't seen the rest of the tutorial is entirely my fault. @johnpapa  wrote it; it's up to me to get it published ... and I have been tardy in doing so.  Intend to fix that soon.\n. I'd prefer that we do not do that. It's pretty confusing. It's also a bear to maintain.\nDidn't I avoid that in the TS version?\nI have finessed this elsewhere by creating a single sample with a shell page, router, and links to navigate among the variations.  Maybe we should talk about this first?\n. Hi Kathy. Are you expecting me to do something here? I don't feel competent to merge DART content \n. I thought what I read before was fine and now you've improved it. I say \"go for it!\"\n. Yes\n. Done. Closed by #941\n. I can't find this phrasing anymore. Maybe it was cured in an update? If you find it again, please open an issue.\n. Looks promising. Will try tomorrow.  Any reluctance to merge it on your part?\n. Thanks for finding this. We decided to fix a different way; see #422.  Either way closes this PR\n. Too late. I've been following my own wacky convention (which makes it \"not a convention\").  Maybe I'll get it right next time.\n. Need a PR before we can entertain your suggestion. Closing until then. Thanks for the thoughts though.\n. Christoph - we needed to consolidate the code samples into a SINGLE project folder and update to beta.\nI did that ... and reviewed ... and in the process made so many changes that I created a separate branch and PR #662.\nIf it's ok with you, we should switch to that one and close this one.\n. That is a recent change to A2 and we are updating docs. Thanks.\n. Closing as this has been taken care of by  @petebacondarwin in 7fb3452 . Thanks for your help though!\n. @vicb - Copied issue to angular/angular, #5618\n. Often a problem with the node version. You appear to be using v.5 (experimental). We're all using 4.2.x.

Will resurface later when ready.\n. ## INSTRUCTIONS AND ADVICE FROM JAY IN THIS COMMENT\nadd-examples-symlinks\ngulp add-example-symlinks will walk every subdir of the \u2018_examples\u2019 folder and create a symlinked \u2018node_modules\u2019 folder anywhere it finds a \u2018package.json\u2019 file.  If there is already a node_modules folder in place, it and all of its children will be deleted before creating the new \u2018node_modules\u2019 folder.  The folder being \u2018pointed to\u2019 is the node_modules folder in the \u2018_examples\u2019 folder.  You will need to run \u2018npm install\u2019 in this folder at least once in order to have any node_modules to point to.  You should probably update the package.json in this directory to represent the versions of any dependencies that you want to have as the standard.  Once this is done you will never need to run \u2018npm install\u2019 in any of the subdirs, only in the _examples root. \nImportant: This gulp task requires admin access on windows but you will probably only need to run it once. I\u2019m not sure of the requirements on a unix system but the code is all standard node. \nThat said, what is kind of neat is that if you really want a different set of dependencies for a specific _examples subdir, you can explicitly run \u2018npm install\u2019 in the specific folder.  This will in fact update the \u2018node_modules\u2019 in the _examples folder ( if you are linked) and your code will operate with the current directory\u2019s package.json settings.  You can then later rerun \u2018npm install\u2019 in the _examples folder itself to get everything back to the way it was. \nremove-examples-symlinks\ngulp remove-example-symlinks removes all of the symlinks created by \u2018add-example-symlinks\u2019.  This task does not need admin access.  One side effect of running add-examples-symlinks followed by remove-example-symlinks is to remove all node_modules completely from the \u2018_examples\u2019 subtree. \nNote that neither of these tasks has any effect on the git repo because the only folders changed by any of this are all excluded \u2018node_modules\u2019 folder. \nA few other changes were needed to make this work.  First, as you noticed, when you have a lot of node_modules populated a number of our gulp tasks got very slow.  Once I ran the \u2018add-example-symlinks\u2019 I started running into this ( as well as crashing WebStorm because it couldn\u2019t handle the depth issue unless I told it to ignore node_modules).  \n\nWebStorm users: remember or learn to exclude node_modules!\n\nI finally traced the  problem with the gulp tasks to the \u2018globule\u2019 npm package.  The real issue was that \u2018globule\u2019 was walking every file and directory in the _examples folder, including all of the nested node_module folders and then removing the ones with \u2018node_modules\u2019 in the path.  I found an alternative \u2018globbing\u2019 package (\u2018globby\u2019) that has a much faster algorithm.   Some tasks went from minutes to seconds once I replaced all use of \u2018globule\u2019 with \u2018globby\u2019.  I made some of the \u2018node_modules\u2019 exclusions more explicit as well. \n. Actually, the leading underscore has no meaning to TS/JS at all. It is a convention that lets the readers (and the persons debugging the code) know that this variable is NOT part of the public API and may not be referenced externally (at your peril).\nTS enforces the  private and internal access modifiers within the TS world; it has no runtime effect.\nIt is an instance variable, not a class variable.\n. Ugh!  This is the kind of breaking change we were NOT supposed to see. It affects almost every attribute directive.  The API guide is no help on the subject as it describes the first parameter as  renderElement: any w/ no further comment.  \nWhen we went to beta we promised people that we would be cautious about breaking changes. We're supposed to have a high bar for breaking changes.\nAs a matter of policy, we should always update API docs when making a breaking change.   I do not think that noting it in the CHANGES.MD is sufficient.\nSee issue I raised: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/6627\n. ### PLEASE DO NOT MERGE!\nWe cannot have samples running on different versions of A2! We have to all be on the same version across all samples and all language tracks.\nI'm grateful that Tom discovered the issue though!\n. I haven't looked yet. I want to. Hope Naomi beats me to it\n. @mithun-daa The QuickStart reflects the recommendations. I'm afraid it is  difficult to see all of the discussions that lead to them as they occur mostly internally right now and at a rapid pace as we drive toward beta.  To be honest, we're applying our best educated guesses right now. We expect to have a broader discussion when things settle down a bit and more people have actual experience to support their opinions.\n. Closed by 296b501\n. Please add Josh4gitaboutit (Josh Otis) to the list of people who have a CLA. He is covered by IdeaBlade's CLA.\n. It's 2016. Time to bring this up again. I think we all agree decorators are hard to find and are worthy of distinction. They don't feel like \"V-Variables\" to me ... as they are clearly functions.\nPerhaps the way forward is to update this idea again, lowering the positional and color  priority of the decorators (N's key objection).  \nSuggestion: move \"A\" to the end (with Const or Enum) and make it gray (like Const or Enum). A distinct color is not important in this context, IMO, and we've run out of colors \nI realize \"A\" stands for annotation ... which few will get immediately ... but I can't think of anything better.  Can we add tooltips to these icons to give them some explanatory substance, at least on a desktop browser?\n. Oooo.

It's not a huge deal in practice but reduce is more to the point.\nIt is also more efficient because it does not create a new array, only to discard it after calculating its length (I repeat: not measurable in practice).\n. THE MOST IMPORTANT thing is that we fix the darned method soon ... because it presently returns the number of completed Todos rather than the number remaining.\nWith everyone's indulgence, I'm just going to git-er-done here and merge this version ... w/ slight amendment to satisfy TS type-checking\nget remaining() {\n    return this.todos.reduce((count: number, todo: Todo) => count + +!todo.done, 0);\n  }\n.

There is a bug.  useAsDefault doesn't work when the target component is a child routing component (works fine for top components which is why the Tutorial has no such problem). \nIt is supposed to work. Redirect serves a different purpose and I didn't want to promote that.\nThis issue was reported (verbally and in angular #5742). I left the doc as is, hoping that it will become correct soon.  I may have to reevaluate my notion of \"soon\".\n. Actually, the error is in Pt. 4.  Accepting it.\n. Thanks! \n. Sorry no. When you wrote we were behind on publishing. Now we publish pretty quickly, often several times a day.\nIf you need fresher than that, you'll have to clone and generate yourself per the instructions in the README.md.

This issue belongs in angular source code.\nCan't fix it here. Closing\n. I like all of your changes a lot with the reservations noted in the other comments. I'd run with this as is but maybe you want to incorporate my suggestions first?\nI can squash commits if you're not sure how.\n. We know! Tutorial is a work in progress. Part 5 is a sketch and not ready to be seen ... which is why didn't link to it.\nIt will be ready soon. Please hang in there.\nClosing this issue for now. Reopen if we don't make good on the promise of part 5 soon.\n. Ok. But please ... no more complaints about ToH part 5 being \"broken\". It was never published so it can't be broken. It does need to get finished.\n. It's fixed now.\n. I updated the sample to use the in-memory web api so we can save as well as read. The POST now works.\nThe // Todo: Error Handling comment is sufficient, given that we show what error handling looks like in the ToH example.\nI saw (working) code for the promises option but didn't see it in the text. We need something and we should be able to leverage your code which I skinnied down into hero-list.1.ts\nWe're getting closer. We need at least another pass though.\nWe need to discuss and show options ... the 3rd parameter.  What goes there besides query params. How to set headers most importantly.\nI'll have more for you later today\n. I'm sorry but this repository is not the proper place to ask for help. It IS a place to describe specific/actionable issues with the documentation.  I suggest you ask your question again on StackOverflow.\nAccordingly, I'm closing this issue.\n. Dive right in!\n. Dive right in!\n. I like all your suggestions. Pushing them (after squasing).\nN.B.

Issues with API docs go in the angular source code.\nThis is one of a great many out-of-date API samples. A sweep of API docs is coming.

Not sure what will take its place.\n. See also my comment to angular/angular#1662 where I  object vigorously to a required selector:.\nIMO the compiler should be fixed to create a <div> not an <undefined>.\nFWIW, <undefined> is unappealing but harmless, right?  So why are we pressing this issue?\n. Oh this is so sad :(\nIt really should work.  Curiously, why does Dart freak out? Is it the presence of the <undefined> element ... which browses simply ignore.\nI'd rather that you add a selector to the Dart version, but I'm prepared to add a selector to the TS version to get you out of a jam. It will only confuse a few readers.\n. Is this resolved in angular.io?  I'm not talking about whether it has been fixed in Angular. Let me know if we need to reopen.\n. Is this ready to go? Looks like it to me.\n. Naomi already has a re-org that addresses most of your concerns. It\u2019s on the backlog\nA chapter on components and directives is on the backlog.\nFrom: Jeremy Wilken [mailto:notifications@github.com] \nSent: Monday, January 11, 2016 6:21 PM\nTo: angular/angular.io angular.io@noreply.github.com\nSubject: [angular.io] Suggestion for content navigation structure (#678)\nI'd like to suggest some restructuring to the navigation to better guide the reader through a learning path. Right now the navigation is somewhat choppy. Even the learning path outlined in the architecture guide has you jump around several places.\nI have it in two segments, reference and learning. I think there will be a lot of people who come back for the API docs, and having that near the top will be helpful, along with other reference materials. \nThe bottom would have the content in an order that would be conceptually possible to read directly through as the learning path. I also suggest there should be a dev guide on Components, since they are so fundamental. I also didn't think it was necessary to separate 'developer' and 'testing' guide content.\n-   Home\n-   Architecture\n-   API\n-   Cheatsheet\n\n\nQuickstart\nTutorial \nTour of Heros chapters\nGuides \nComponents (Not currently there)\nTemplates & Displaying Data\nPipes\nEvents (currently called User Input)\nForms\nAttribute Directives\nStructural Directives\nRouting & Navigation\nDependency Injection\nHierarchical Injectors\nLifecycle Hooks\nUpgrading from Angular 1\nTesting with Jasmine\nUnit tests\nGlossary\n\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub https://github.com/angular/angular.io/issues/678 .\n. The cheat sheet is actually defined in the Angular repo. Raising the issue #7504 there.\n. Thanks\n. I think this is valuable information but it does not belong in the quickstart.  We are not teaching how to add 3rd party modules to an A2 app in this chapter.\nThanks for your offer but I'm afraid we must refuse it.\n. Agreed!  Having just written a package for A2 developers myself I can confirm there is a lot of work involved.\nI added a few more considerations to Igor's list. Copied here:\n- testing\n- copyright, licensing, and open sourcing (source open) options\n- how to prepare for contributions (assuming it is open sourced)\nI would _not_ expect you (or anyone) to cover all of these topics in depth. But they deserve some coverage.\nShould check with Google/A2 team about the legal issues mentioned and how they relate to what Google can or cannot do to promote a 3rd party component.\n. I did!  I copied them here :-)\n. Thanks. Someone beat you to it. #680 \n. Thanks!  Picked up your recommendation while making other changes to Quickstart. Incorporated in #715 \n. It seems the app has changed since that description was written. Your suggestion doesn't match the new behavior either. Fixed in #716\n. Closing because we are not translating to ES5 in this manner.\n. Sorry. Rob's objections stand. Alt2 is modestly better but necessitates a sweeping change to all samples and tests in multiple browsers. I am unpersuaded that changing from then(null, fn) to catch(fn) does much to relieve the SystemJS intimidation factor\nWe'll probably do it eventually but we won't be in this PR.\nThanks for offering though.\n. This suggestion is more appropriate on the angular/angular repo. THIS repo is for documentation issues.\n. Todos:\n- [ ] Why A2 ships without a  FilterPipe and OrderByPipe (equivalents in A1)\n- [ ] Memoization in an impure pipe improves perf (that's what the crazy JSON example does)\n- [ ] Trim some of the rhetorical excess (says the man with rhetorical excess)\n- [ ] Clarify implications of Misko's minification concerns for pipe developers. How do they avoid trouble?\nRegarding the first Todo, Misko writes:\n\nI think in NG2 we are saying that you should do more of your filtering in controller rather then in the template. The issues with filter and orderBy is that they rely on reflection, and as such will break with minification. So we have been making sure that all of our core directive/pipes are reflection free and hence minification safe.\n\nI hadn't considered those angles.\n. So am I a \"go\" to incorporate these changes into the chapter (w/ my usual filter)?\n. moved to PR #974 where I can work on it\n. This is an Angular issue, not a docs issue.\n. I wasn't so fond of your stylistic suggestions but many of your recommendations were worthy and you inspired me to take an ax to the entire page. Less is definitely more here.\nI like to think I incorporated the best of your ideas in my rewrite. See PR #717\n. You are correct that some of these mistakes pepper the code. We fix them when we find them. Also, these are defects in angular/angular, not angular.io so they won't be discovered or fixed by the responsible team.  You might want to post there.\nI'm closing your issue for now because we can't act on it. We'll hold open any that you specifically identify.\n. Yikes!  Thanks Eric!\n. I don't see us addressing this anytime soon.\n. Closed by 8183ad6f548c79d4f9d726105e0de84a2cec7f5b\n. @kwalrath You may wish to propagate these changes to DART version. There is no such page for JS yet.\n. Thanks for your submission. It happens that we reworked these examples substantially so your change will no long apply. We also took a different approach, omitting the href altogether and using CSS to present the hand pointer.\nSee #740 \nThanks again. Keep helping.\n. I like it.\n. The flash approach is overwrought IMO but, as you say, maybe we're missing something. Either way, it seems best to throw into an A1 directive for angular.io site-wide use and plug it into our code panel generation. Does that make it your department?\n. @filipesilva  That's a very thorough explanation and I like the solution. c/@petebacondarwin \n. Closed by merge of Pete's excellent solution #728 \n. Closed because subsumed in #662 \n. Thanks. Done\n. Huge payoff!\nHere is what the jade looks like (or would look like if we had the JS versions of the doc pages that are linked in the original) for the Developers Guide home page:\ninclude ../../../../_includes/_util-fns\n+includeShared('{ts}', 's1')\n:marked\n  Look for a link to a running version of that sample near the top of each page such as this\n  [live example](/resources/live-examples/architecture/js/plnkr.html) from the [Architecture](architecture.html) chapter.\n+includeShared('{ts}', 's2')\n:marked\nIt required exactly TWO // #docregion markups, named 's1' and 's2'\n. Merged by 45ac0ee37dd0f0075fed9ba23a24ebc692de1d4f\n. I do not know. Maybe @petebacondarwin does\n. Thanks but this is a difference of literary taste not substance and doesn't significantly improve readability\n. Looking forward to trying it. Just as soon as I can breath ...\n. SUPERB!  Thanks, Pete! Merging. Thanks for the cross-browser checks, @filipesilva \n. Thanks but your suggestion is a tiny difference of literary taste not substance.\n. Looks like someone fixed it. Let me know if you think otherwise.  Thanks for the help.\n. The SystemJS site describes the system-csp-production.js as \".. a separate build for production only.\"\nThe doc samples and tutorial are most definitely not guidance for production builds. They are intended for learning Angular 2 features and techniques.\nIt would be inappropriate for us to even hint that these demos are suitable for a secure, production environment. \nWe'd love to have guidance for production builds. I don't know where to find reliable sources for such guidance at this time. So much about the environment (I'm not talking about Angular) is in flux.\nMaybe you can contribute a blog post or comparable advice on StackOverflow?\nWhile I appreciate this suggestion and the need, I'm confident that we won't be putting this kind of advice in the tutorials.\nAll the best.\n. Thanks for all of the effort but as I said many times this chapter was not broken but rather a work in progress whose pieces were committed here but not published. Sorry for the confusion.\nThe proper tutorial chapter is arriving any day. See #749\n. Thanks. You certainly found one of the problems. There were many others preventing this app from running in beta.0 (it used to run in alpha). \nYour change is subsumed in #754 \n. Thanks for the catch. This will be fixed within a much larger revision of the DI chapter, arriving in a day or two. See #748\n. Also dealt with the change in positioning.\n. I pushed it. As with all docs, it can be improved some more.\n. Holding back while we reconsider our approach to ES5 translation\n. Closing because we are not pursuing the ES5 option at this time. Let's keep the branch alive as we may comeback to mine for good stuff.\n. We don't have \"latest bits\" yet. We'll have to coordinate on the expected move to beta.2 which (if we are fortunate) will require no code changes.\n. @kwalrath LGTM. I pinged Jay again about moving the _. files to a subfolder. That's a must!\nI like your naming convention ... starting a new #docregion prefix at each section break. That should work everywhere.\nLooking at your Dart file, my sense is that this is a workable approach. Thanks to your convention, I can find my way between the two versions pretty easily.\nHow does it feel to you?\nWhen can we accept this?  I have some pending updates to this chapter (#818 new ngSwitch and ngForTrackBy syntax)  that await at least the TS version of the jade.\n. Thanks\n. Sure. I'm looking forward to the day when I can update the testing pages. They're stuck in alpha-land right now. \n. Incorporated in #723 \n. It is semi-obvious and this is an optional appendix. Added a phrase to the appendix reminding about the import. See PR #792\n. That is the web api server reporting a 404. It should tell you what resource it couldn't load.\nI cannot reproduce. I grabbed this PR. It compiles and runs fine.  I tried the promise version too ... by modifying these two lines of toh.component.ts to use the \".1\" versions:\nimport {HeroListComponent} from './hero-list.component.1';\nimport {HeroService}       from './hero.service.1';\nActually ... the more I look at your error, the more I'm convinced that your app failed to load the in-mem web api file itself.\nAre you sure it is where the script tag says it should be?\n<script src=\"node_modules/a2-in-memory-web-api/web-api.js\"></script>\nTo get it, you have to re-install our development set so that it propagates via our symlinks to each sample's node_modules file.\ncd public/docs/_examples\nnpm install\nI updated everything to beta.2 today.  I'm going to rebase this branch and git push -f. BEWARE\n. I've polished the prose and examples a bit more (particularly error handling which no longer launches an untestable alert box) and I  git push -f again.  \nI merged it in 8a5bcb4  \nNow we need the material on other request options.\n. closed by #769 \n. Closed as part of cleanup. New PR is #786\n. Closed by dd0d822cbc60d0b5153cddf85fb0aaa28d75a6f\n. Commit message for 9f692ffb27ef0043d04c5961c9b24281580e8a40 incorrectly says \"beta.1\". It converts to beta.2. Too late to fix it now.\n. It's a great topic ... a huge topic.  Not sure when we'll get to it ... if ever. \nWe'd welcome a literature/resource review that we could point to. Your contribution in this regard would be welcome.\n. That is the plan.\n. I'd rather fix it then remove it.\n. Thanks but, sadly, you've invested your time in hidden, unpublished pages that no one should reach. Some of them have no business being on the web at all.\nThe only exception is the testing page which is stuck in Angular alpha world and is scheduled for a complete overhaul. There is no value in \"fixing it\" either.\nAppreciate the effort and very sorry to have lured you into this. But we won't be able to do anything with your PR.\nIn future, please focus on published pages. We'd love to accept your contributions.\n. No problem. We welcome help!  I'm sorry we wasted your by leaving this for you to find.\n. Kept the link fix; ignored the rest. Thanks.\n. Thanks. Superseded by PR #791 \n. This was a mixed bag. Separated in to #785 and  #786\n. Closing. Unable to repro\n. Thanks. Appreciate it. Rather than dedicate a commit to this, I folded it into an (unrelated) PR #792. Hope you don't mind.\n. Thanks. Picked up your fix with PR #792\n. Closed by 73dad5d\n. Oops. Good catch.\n. Oops. Good catch. Closed by 7e3f90f\n. Closed by b2b025aab752f3006fb2ed5cf4894fce22e78986\n. No one could find the chapter. I can't tell you how many people said \"What chapter on http?\".\nAnd since jsonp inherits from http we have a little justification there.\nI decided to go with your improvements to observable before asking Rob W on the grounds that it is manifestly better guidance than what we publish now. I will get his insight and update as necessary.\n. Thanks. \n. Not a problem on a Windows Phone. ;-)\n. Closed by #985\n. Closed as part of #805\n. Fair point. The JS language track is woeful at the moment. We have it high on our backlog. Leaving open until we get there.\n. We now have that cross linking.\n. The testing chapter is slated for an overhaul soon. But I agree with this and accepting it now will remind me to get it right later.  Thanks.\n. What does \"I tried it locally in a slightly different context\" mean? What context is that?\nThe only context that matter w/r/t the HeroService is the chapter sample itself. I'm sorry but your claim of error and your proposed changes are simply not correct. \nThe HTTP Chapter code works as demonstrated by the plunker link in the chapter itself. That plunker is generated directly from the sample\nYou can see that the HeroService code really is\ngetHeroes () {\n    return this.http.get(this._heroesUrl)\n                    .map(res => <Hero[]> res.json().data)\n                    .do(data => console.log(data)) // eyeball results in the console\n                    .catch(this.handleError);\n  }\nIf I had to guess, I'd say that you were targeting your own web api which returns response data in a different shape ... perhaps a response that lacks the wrapper object with a data property that this sample presupposes.\nThe chapter warns several times that you have to adjust to the actual characteristics of your target web api.\nI'm closing until you can provide evidence that the chapter and sample are actually wrong.\n. It's valid JSON. The problem is that it is _insecure_ JSON on the wire.\nSee this OWASP security guideline on the subject\n. @steinsag Sorry for the confusion. It is easy to overlook the data property on the response in the sample API.\nThe real take-away should be: look closely at the details of your web api before unpacking the result object.\nI tried to make that point. It doesn't always register.\n. Closed because this change was already picked up (somewhere). Thanks for finding it.\n. Closing this as issues here should be confined to documentation issues.\n. You found the first one. I fixed them all (I think). Thanks.\n. Thanks for your help.  We caught this in a pending round of changes so won't be needing it.\n. Are you sure about the self closing tags, @tomplusplus?\nMy understanding is that that is neither required nor desirable in HTML (but is required in XHTML). Picky either way\n. Closing because this never got out of incubation.\n. @Dotneteer  Thanks for these tests!\nOn a downbeat note, though, your claims about the empty list in wiki tests are not verifiable. They do not actual test what you say here:\n\nWith the 'testForRefreshedResult()' method we check that the result list is immediately deleted after\n      sending a key to the search field,\n\nI tried to come up with a test that would confirm/deny it and I can't. The old list is always populated until replaced by the new.\nTherefore, I removed your comments with what seem to me to be false claims.\nI agree that it is not easy to test the difference between the two wiki requests. The challenge is that we cannot know if wikipedia will respond in under 300ms.\nI don't think this is worth solving right now.  It is enough to know that the samples function. That is their real purpose.\nI'm accepting this as amended and moving to master.\nThanks again!\n. - cutting words. Favor imperative sentences.\n- many changes to make the samples abide by our naming conventions (or get them closer).\n- do not use underscores in names. cb_ becomes cb-.\n- component element names must always be hypenated.\n- images go in resources/images/cookbooks/component-communication/ not in cookbooks.\nI updated the Cookbooks guidance to conform to these points.\nI'll be squashing to one commit and force pushing.\n. @zoechi  Correct!  This is a WIP and is not ready for press for reasons that include the one you cite.\n@Dotneteer The tests were incorrect and only appeared to pass. I fixed many of them but the last two examples fail the corrected tests and are too difficult to repair today.  Feel free to try to fix them.\nMore important, these two recipes are too complicated and I'm not convinced they tell a good story or are good advice. Holding until I can think this through.\n. @Dotneteer I really want to publish this. I made changes and am forging ahead.\nWe are NOT supposed to use the EventEmitter for services. I replaced the EvE with the RxJS Subject in the mission-control-astronaut service example. I also show unsubscribing in the component's ngOnDestroy so that readers will know to beware of the memory leak potential.\nI had to discard the last \"message bus\" recipe for three reasons:\n1. It didn't adequately differentiate itself from the mission-control-astronaut service.\n2. It didn't really demonstrate unrelated components communicating. It looked like a more complicated version of the previous recipe.\n3. It mistakenly added the message bus to the providers array of two different components. Although it finessed the mistake by forcing both to share the same instance, this is not a good practice.\nI deleted the code for this last recipe and the other disused recipes as they would otherwise be discovered and distract readers.  You can find them in your own copy of earlier commits.\n. I'm merging now. This PR will be closed.\n. LGTM (where G=Great)\n. Fixed it. Please try again.\n. I'm replying as an individual, not as a representative of Google (which I am not). What I am about to say is not pleasant. It is merely true.\nYour hours of head scratching may have lead you to four important life lessons:\n1. Read the documentation\n2. Make no assumptions\n3. Learn the target web api\n4. Adapt to the web api rather than copying-and-pasting blindly\nWe did our part. We warned you about the shape of the returned web api result on at least two occasions. For example:\n\nWe must also know the shape of the data returned by the server API. We shouldn't expect json() to return the heroes array directly. _The server we're calling always wraps JSON results in an object with a data property_ [emphasis mine]. We have to unwrap it to get the heroes. This is conventional web api behavior, driven by security concerns.\n\nWe never said that every http json response is retrieved by res.json().data.   That would be foolish. _No one can tell you how to interpret _every http response.\nWe said that res.json().data is the way to extract the data from this particular server response.\nYou are free to complain that your api doesn't do this and that you think this is a bad design. To which I reply without hesitation \"you missed the point\"  We are rarely lucky enough to face the web api we prefer. It is usually someone else's design, someone with a different notion of what is \"right\".  The wise developer adapts.\nThere was no error in this example.  The data property does exist ... for this sample's web api. It exists for reasons clearly stated in the documentation and matches the behavior of many existing web apis.\nIn the real world there is, in fact, an easy way to troubleshoot this (aside from reading the documentation):   send a request to the server and look at what it returns on the network tab of the developer tools. \nIn this sample, which intercepts HTTP requests with an in-memory server, the shape of the result is clearly stated in the documentation. You could breakpoint that service if you liked.\nAt one level I am sorry for your pains. But at another level ... not so much. \n. Language please. Not nice!  \nI tried to give a substantive response.  I do regret the brief moment when my reply said \"Get over it\"; I changed it to \"You missed the point\" but obviously not before you caught me with my guard down.\nFWIW, I drew sharper attention to the importance of knowing the API and the possibility that your web API might not send back an object with a data property.\nClosed by 99caf75\n. Thanks. Got it while updating to beta-6\n. I fixed it. Try again.\n. This version of the QS is about to be entirely replaced ... and the problem you've identified will be swept away. Talking a day or two. Closing.\n. Duplicate of #768 \n. thanks @filipesilva; updated w/ your changes (except as noted)\n. I abdicate on styling. I have spent almost no time on it and will not spend more.\nMy concern about delay is new-comers to A2 aren't getting the information they need. Are we letting the better be the enemy of the good?\nLooking into Kathy's suggestions now.\n. I'm chillin'!\n. I discarded the style changes and force pushed. Those bad boys are gone forever :-)\n. Thanks, @naomiblack \nThe most significant question is \"have I gone too far in the other direction\"?  I don't know how to resolve that one. Maybe we can find some time to talk it through?  Or I can always unwind it completely and go back to a long, flat page.\nDo you agree there is/was a problem to be solved? I was getting strong push back on how not-quick this was  (e.g.,from the visitors last week). The new material on typings that arrived last week just pushed it over the edge for me. But I confess I have no direct line to newbies who could tell me which QS style is better.\nMeanwhile ... there are substantive changes here that aren't in the published QS. They need to go to press one way or the other.\nWhat can I do to make this right and get it unstuck?\nRegarding other points\nI completely rewrote the gigantic AppComponent block (another excellent @kwalrath suggestion). I think it is more clear and in more digestible pieces.\nI agree with removing the tiny expandos. \"Why create an app sub-folder\" is particularly egregious.\nI like your labels and button stylings ... let's go with those! \nEasy for me to change the button text when the expando is open (I wrote the JS for it) . Do you have a suggestion for how it should read? For example, what should \"Why do we need a main.ts?\" change to when its content is open?\nI can adjust the indents and padding. I'm pretty helpless when it comes to the other styling concerns, especially colors. Not my forte (you noticed). I'm inclined to think that some of those improvements could come later when your designer becomes available.\n. ### Brief/Verbose Mode?\nMaybe I overdid it with the fine grained approach.  What do you think of a single switch (checkbox) - Brief/Verbose Mode - and we do away with the individual expandos. \nThen could revert to the original formatting instead of tucking verbose-mode text in .l-sub-section.\nThat would get us unstuck and out of the styling/labeling challenges.\n. See the new single-toggle version #863 \n. We will do expandos but not this way and with the latest content. Keeping the branch alive but closing this PR\n. closed in favor of #769\n. Closing because not relevant to angular docs\n. Thanks, Istvan! Closing because we have one now. \n. Good catch\n. Merged in f07ca64\n. See #852\n. Closed by #852\n. Accepting this PR would not have prevented the original error that spawned the typings issue; see my comments there. The errant command would still have failed.\nThere is a limit to how much we can teach the community tools such as npm. That said, I think we could do better by drawing attention to the significance of the -- argument and linking to the npm guidance.\nThat may be how I address the problem rather than substituting one mysterious command for another.\nI do appreciate the heads up, though!\n. I agree and will do\n. Ok ... I've thought about it more and incorporated all of these suggestions in a new PR #849.\nI also incorporated it in PR #838 which is my preferred version of the QuickStart.\nThese typings changes will arrive in one or the other PR.\nWe don't need THREE PRs on this subject so I'm closing this one.  Thanks for the help.\n. Would love to see a PR that you recommend to fix the problem\n. Apparently my last force-push closed this PR. Reopened as #908\n. I'm not sure why you think it should work if you remove the server. Where would data come from?\nI think I see your point though.  The text retains a statement from a pre-published version of the sample:\n\nWe pass the resource URL to get and it calls the server which returns data from the heroes.json file.\n\nThat's not true if the url is 'app/heroes'. It becomes true if the url is 'app/heroes.json'.\nI updated the chapter to make this more clear. See PR #850\n. Accepted because of delays to PRs #838 and #863\n. k.  Incorporated in PR #859 . Closed\n. @naomiblack @kwalrath  ... ready for your review\n. Added to this PR the plunker image revision requested by @naomiblack  and related changes; see 12500eb\n. Thanks. Closed by pr #867\n. Thanks\n. @aciccarello - Thanks but we do NOT recommend adding that ///<reference line. We have expanded the QuickStart instructions to include typings.  The matching Tour of Heroes reflects this (see the plunkers).\n@alexeagle Have already updated QuickStart for this stuff and published.  \nI'm assuming we should close this issue as it has been addressed.\n. Excellent idea. I filed as issue #7502 over there.\nI also updated the README.md in this repo to clarify these points.\n. If hand coded it would be: <span ngSwitchWhen=\"Eenie\">Eenie</span>\nI went there and backed off because I'm trying to tell a story about <template>\n. The key is that one should use foo=\"some-string\" when the value is constant for life and you're NOT binding. Reserve [foo]=\"someProperty\" for property binding scenarios in which the value must be watched.\n. Well .. that's what I did and why. I would think the same reasoning would be persuasive in Dart world but not sure. That's your judgement call\n. Incorporating this change. Opened companion issue #935\n. Good catch. Made the slight mod of moving the files below the folders ... as one expects in a file viewer.\n. The gameplan is to ensure that there is always a corresponding page in each of the language tracks, even if that page can't be navigated to from the left nav.\nI wish I could do it all programmatically ... discover if the page exists; if it doesn't, generate the replacement on the fly and fool the server into serving it. That is beyond my present talents.\n. @kwalrath\n- replaced the word \"decorator\" with \"annotation\" in Dart ... using my new, mad javascript-in-jade skills.\n- Found and fixed many (all) of those broken links (there were others ... omission of # was the common cause).\n. Open to another solution I you have one.\n. Rejecting because this is a site infrastructure file that belongs to @petebacondarwin and he undoubtedly held on to this for a reason. He can clean it up if he wants.\nWe appreciate the help but we'd prefer contributions that improve the documentation rather than clean up  obscure corners.\n. Some guidance on EventEmitter is on the documentation backlog. Hang in there.\n. Closing this issue based on the above.\n. @kwalrath You've reminded me that I need to adjust what was the DevGuide intro to be the Basics intro\n. @kwalrath I revised the Basics overview; it's now a Documentation overview. You may want to leverage it  for Dart (see the JavaScript version for clues).\n. Thanks\n. Too old. Close and try again when ready. Thanks\n. Excellent!\nWe'll have to sweep and replace the \"I\" and \"You\" with \"We/Us\" or just simple imperatives.  I haven't told you about the doc voice yet.\nI had some of my own fun with your sample starting point. Checkout the revised sample code in the cb-dynamic-form-2 branch in ideablade/angular.io.\nLet's talk about it tomorrow (Wed) if you have time.\n. Moved to #943\n. Thanks for catching. Closed by #932\n. closed as dup\n. Excellent suggestion. I've merged your change (w/ slight rewording for what I think will be a bit more clarity). Thanks.\n. Yes ... this needs clarification.\nPiling on to @zoechi, for any given injector there is only singleton lifetime. It is truly a singleton.  But because you can have multiple injectors, each redefinition (each setting of a component's providers) creates a new injector scope with its own singleton.\nI don't think I've said that very well. Anyway, we'll work on clarifying.\n. See also #318 \n. Where do you recommend making this observation? Pull requests are most welcome!\n. Old. May or may not do this\n.

I authored these requests.  The author in question, Joe Eames, is also covered by the IdeaBlade corporate CLA.\n. closed by #978 \n. Yes @gkalpak. And you SHOULD use the no-brackets form if the value never changes during the lifetime of the component/directive.\n\nIf that's the case here (and I think it is), I'd prefer:\n<label attr.for={{question.key}}>{{question.label}}</label>\n...\n<select id={{question.key}} *ngSwitchWhen=\"'dropdown'\"\nThe question marks are not needed.\nI confirmed this just now in an update to my spike on a SelectorComponent \n. I believe you ARE mistaken. The critical difference is that Angular will continue to watch bar for future changes in the first case. It will NOT do so in the second; that will be a first-time binding only.\nAlso, you don't need the (\"). This is fine: foo={{bar}}\nI admit this is performance nit picking. But I think it is worth knowing.\n. Yes. I was just looking at Template Syntax. I thought I updated it for this case but evidently not. Put it on my todo list ;-)\n. AAARGH!  I was wrong.  You were correct @Foxandxss \nThe use of interpolation means that A2 continues to update the value ... something I just tested.  So the special first-time-only case works only if set with a string literal.\nIn the following example, <selector> is a component with its own id input property. The attr.for setting is for demo purposes to prove a point; you'd actually just write for=\"foo\".\n<label attr.for=\"foo\">{{question.label}}</label>\n...\n<selector id=\"foo\" ...\nI still have to document this case. The <label> example is also a great use case for the attr.xxx binding; using just for={{key}} throws an exception. Note to self!\nAnd the (\") around the interpolation are still unnecessary ... perhaps even wrong (I haven't checked).\n. I agree. Now we have to be careful again. At least the change detection cycle doesn't spin over and over as in A1.  To be honest, first-time binding never made that much of a difference in any test known to me. It made us feel good though :-)\n. Please fix to consistent syntax. I personally like this:\n<label attr.for={{question.key}}>{{question.label}}</label>\n...\n<select id={{question.key}} *ngSwitchWhen=\"'dropdown'\"\nBut the following is acceptable too:\n<label [attr.for]=\"question.key\">{{question.label}}</label>\n...\n<select [id]=\"question.key\" *ngSwitchWhen=\"'dropdown'\"\nBut, please, not a mix of property binding and interpolation\nUnrelated: how is the new image different from the first? I couldn't see it ;-)\n. I haven't heard that [] is easier to tool than {{}}. I don't understand why that would be so. Handlebars/mustaches are tooled by Visual Studio just fine.\n. I'm taking this NOW even if it isn't done ... because TODAY it is better than the existing published chapter.\nThank you for this great start!\n. Must also remove the beta.11 warning added to public/docs/ts/index.html in commit ac7097300ad96c23cfb0db682c308300494325f0\n. Took care of this when we updated to beta.12\n. Thanks\n. Please only file documentation issues here. Yours is a support question which is better placed on StackOverflow.  That's why I'm closing it.\nBut ... because I was curious ... I modified the QuickStart plunker to align with your code and this works:\njavascript\n(function(app) {\n  app.AppComponent =  ng.core.Component({\n      selector: 'my-app',\n      template: '<h1>Hello {{obj.a}}</h1>'+ \n      '<div><input type=\"text\" [(ngModel)]=\"obj.a\"/></div>'\n    })\n    .Class({\n      constructor: function() {\n         this.obj = {a: \"World\"};\n      }\n    });\n})(window.app || (window.app = {}));\nThe only differences I see are (a) the selector and (b) the name of the component. \n(a) Why did you write: 'div[ng]?  You didn't show your index.html so it's difficult to see how this does or does not match the application start tag there.\n(b) You don't show your main.ts so can't see how you bootstrap. I suspect that you aren't importing and bootstrapping with app.comp.  I reproduce your error when I misalign the component name.\n. You're in!\n. I like it! Merging\n. LGTM\n. That is great information and I'd like to capture that in the router chapter as well!\nThe accessibility arguments for <a> are winners (and I wonder what the material design people are doing about this).\nDelegating link parameters array definition\nWe should note that, if the developer want's component control over the navigation, that's easy to do while still using RouterLink to display the target url.\nTemplate:\n<a *ngFor=\"#hero of heroes\" [routerLink]=\"gotoDetail(hero)\" class=\"col-1-4\">\nComponent:\ngotoDetail(hero: Hero) {\n    let link = ['HeroDetail', { id: hero.id }];\n    return link;\n    //this._router.navigate(link);\n  }\nRouterLink or (click) binding?\nI need to discuss with John why we used (click) to delegate to a component navigation method rather than using RouterLink. I suspect we did so without thinking it through.\nIt could be intentional under some circumstances: maybe you do NOT want the user to easily open it in a different tab; I've seen resistance to that AND to deep linking among some of our IdeaBlade clients.  \nIf that's what you want, fine. But you should KNOW that you're making that choice deliberately ... and we'd say so in the docs.\nPlunker sadness\nI'm somewhat challenged by my present inability to demonstrate the \"open in another tab\" feature from within plunker. Works find when the app is run independently.  Within plunker, we seem to be generating a URL with a base path that is different from the base path of the source tab. \nIn this snapshot, the top url is the source tab and the bottom url is the generated url for \"Narco\"\n\nTherefore opening the link in a new tab results in a 404.  Works fine if I click-in-place. Maybe someone has an idea? \n. It is hard for me to explain the resistance because I don't always find the reasons all that compelling. \nFor example, many say that deep-linking into your bank account isn't something they want to encourage. Maybe this is faux security. \nI've heard a UX reason that aligns with resistance to the old MDI paradigm: users get lost when there are a bunch of open windows into the app ... some of which they forget to close.\nThese kinds of reasons motivated one client to avoid the router altogether in their A1 app. Navigation was controlled entirely through traditional menus and buttons. It worked fine for them (and this is one reason I'm hoping we don't couple async module loading TOO closely to the router, even thought that is a natural fit).\nHere is that plunker: http://plnkr.co/edit/NiMRE6EYUEwElODjyDiW?p=preview \n. @IgorMinar: had this been a button would we feel the same way? Should buttons expose urls that can be opened in another tab?\nBefore saying \"of course\", I observe that _very few of the buttons on this github page do that. Is github \"wrong\"?_\nGiven that the Dashboard renders those links as buttons, I'm waffling on how I come down on the use of RouterLink in ToH!  If github doesn't support \"open in another tab\", why must ToH do so?\nI DO get why the <div> should be replaced by something ... either <a> or <button>\nI've invited Marcy and Almero to chime in.\n. That's a good intuition, Igor. Yet it feels a wee bit incomplete. \nThe ToH editor has a back button. All it does is navigate back to the screen you were on. Personally, I wouldn't want that button to display a url nor would I think it intuitive to \"go back\" by opening in a new browser tab.\nI do not have the answers. I have instincts derived from my experience of using apps ... just like all of us.\nI'll bet that people who do app UX for a living have some rules of thumb that we can sample. Before we  set this \"in stone\", I think we should gather some of those rules.  \nDo you have a UX expert/book that you refer to?  Anyone is welcome to chime in.\nOn an interim basis, I'd invite developers to ask themselves\n-  does it make sense for the user to click here and open in a new tab?\n-  would it be useful to be able to email this link to someone?\n-  ...\n. Adopting this [routerLink] binding suggestion for ToH 5 in PR #2718\nKept the button-click imperative navigation in HeroesComponent mainly to show how to do that when you need imperative navigation but also because this use case is more button-like than anchor-like.\n. Old. Raise again if it's still relevant\n. Making a few adjustments:\n1. I replaced the Hero interface with a class ... everywhere ... and adjusted the text accordingly. I just don't want to have to deal with this ... even though I cannot repro your plunker problem\n2. You added a new snippets file. No to snippets files!  They are the last choice of a desperate author. They are not testable.  I can eliminate the need for this file.\n. Weird. I see it now. Whatever. Problem solved by making it a class. Thanks. Committing and pushing now.\n. Ooops. You missed the others in toh-4 ... tutorial. Getting them now.\nMore precisely, you left the inputs: arrays in. Thus they are marked twice as inputs which is not a good thing I've learned.\n. I think we're good to go. I'm merging.\n. Thanks! Merged.\n. Thanks. I added similar updates to all similar links.\n. I believe the best way to address this is by reformatting the signatures in angular/angular.\nI create issue #7819 there and PR #7820 to fix it.\nThanks, @Foxandxss, for figuring it out.\n. Thanks\n. Holding until A2 has this change ... which it doesn't yet.\n. I don't believe we're going with this. Switching to new router. Closing \n. I don't believe we're going with this. Switching to new router. Closing \n. Why do you say \"incorrectly\"?  The text seems correct to me. We're asking the reader to use the \"slowly\" version instead of the regular version. That's what it means to\n\nswap _heroService.getHeroesSlowly for _heroService.getHeroes and see how the app behaves. \n\nThe change that you are suggesting would do the opposite ... which makes no sense to me. \nHelp me see what I am missing.\n. I like it. That I can do. I'll make that change as I merge yours (so you get credit ;-))\n. Hi Tor -\nI'm documenting here some of the more important changes that I'm making/recommending.\n1. We recommend registering application-wide providers in the root component, not in bootstrapping.  Anything that really belongs with the app itself goes in AppComponent.  I'm moving your app-specific providers there. Illustrated usage by extending HeroBiosComponent with logger service injection.\n2. We only register Angular overrides in the bootstrapper.  A good example is router LocationStrategy or a dev-time http backend fake like a2-in-memory-web-api. \n3. All component class names should end in Component. Fixed that.\n4. We recommend that constructors be super simple and never call services that could do anything like hit a database. I revised the SortedHeroesComponent by moving the HeroesService call to ngOnInit.\n5. I wanted to make a more dramatic argument against component inheritance so I made HeroesBase into a component. I also shifted the sorting logic to SortedHeroesComponent for ... ahem ... greater realism.\n6. I think the inheritance issues are lower priority than anything else that you're showing. I shifted it to the bottom.\nI'll update this comment as I make more changes.\n. Hey Tor - I've made more changes but it's in a broken state. Please don't touch at the moment.\n. AARGH.  I renamed the branch to all lowercase (our standard), and it closed this PR.\nPlease see continuation PR #1022\n. Thanks\n. The other author, @thelgevold, and I are working on this together. He knows about this. Removing the CLA: no label\n. @googlebot I authored these commits\n. Piggy-backed an unrelated commit:  \"chore: replace VSCode-specific settings.json with broadly recommended .editorconfig\"\n. Closed by #1027\n. Thanks for your effort and kind intent. This isn't urgent and I'm not sure if these are good keywords anyway (other than Angular2 and documentation). I'm going to decline with regret as we should be working on higher priority things right now. Sorry and thank you.\n. Please explain what this about and why it matters\n. Oh .. why not. I'm merging it.\n. John and I are working on this together. He's ok with this commit.\n. Merging ... THIS BRANCH IS NOW CLOSED\n. Thanks. Fixed in PR #1045\n. We're about to rewrite most of this. Thanks, but I'm declining as this change will be lost in the wash.\n. Thanks. Merged\n. I like where you're going.\nRemember that the tour is a gentle introduction to A2. It's meant to reassure the reader that A2 covers the application ground that they need it to cover.  It's not supposed to be comprehensive. It's not supposed to be contentious or risk confusing the reader with choices.\nLet's keep the http chapter in that spirit.\nThe chapter should also be short. Not too short but I'd definitely err on the side of brief and breezy.\n\nThe promise/observable trade-off is the most vexing to me. With my preamble in mind, I think we stick with promises at the boundary between the HeroService and the components. Within the HeroService we talk observables and hint at what's possible there. But I don't want an essay on observables in the ToH.\nThis is not the place to lead readers on a scary adventure into the uncertainties of observables and other competing data strategies.\nThere is no reason for ToH to get into the observable weeds. We should say just enough to let the reader know that _we know observables are there_.\n\nYes the A2-in-mem-web-api is the way to go. It handles all the CUD methods you need. No reason to go too deep though. Remember that the in-mem-web-ai exists for demos and early development only. We want the reader to know that we're using it to make their learning experience easier (they won't need to set up a server to learn A2's http).  We don't want to go overboard. They should know that using a real web api involves no more than a change of  URL.\n\nPlease make sure that we give a nod to error handling. We must write error catching. We don't have to do anything grand with the errors: writing to console is probably sufficient. But we absolutely must have catch in the HeroService for all methods.\n. What's holding this up?\n. Merged in 8b1683f51397e704363c52ec504331a60a0fa43e and two previous commits\n. I updated a few things and polished here and there. I clarified the moduleId in particular.\nFWIW, the problem wasn't with plunker but the fact that we were serving an old version of SystemJS that didn't support __moduleName.  I'm told by the Angular team that that will be fixed soon (how soon I don't know).  Leaving your shim in the code as that might be handy elsewhere some day.\nI know you use the word \"attribute\" when referring to the keys in the component metadata object. That's technically correct. Nonetheless, I switched to the more colloquial (albeit inaccurate) word \"property\". I feared some readers would be confused by \"attribute\",\nI did not try to resolve the matter of whether to remove /deep/ from the doc. I'm leaving that to you.\nI'd like to merge this tomorrow a.m. so that it makes the beta.14 publication.  Please let make any necessary corrections and tell me when I can let it go.\nPlease note that I force-pushed so you may have to re-pull the branch.\n. The word \"_property_\" is correct. Attribute would actually be wrong ... an important point that I belabor earlier in the chapter. \nWe must distinguish between the property binding and attribute position; the former is what it is, the latter is where it is.\nEvidently I have yet to firmly establish this essential point.\nThanks for the fix!\n. (April 5) Great start!\nI'll bring my red pencil to it later. Let's focus on content.\nI like the pace and the unfolding of concepts. \nI am unclear on when the techniques you show are wise and when the alternative isn't.\nFor example, the labeling section begins with a large group of implicit label components. These lock the control inside beyond the reach of developer control (binding and styling). Are you recommending that we create these a11y components for ourselves? \nWhy do I need these components?  Once you tell me about wrapping a control in a label, do I really need them? Why and when is ...\n<a11y-input>First Name:</a11y-input>\n... better than ...\n<label>First Name: \n  <input class=\"form-control\" [(ngModel)]=\"person.firstName\">\n</label>\nEven more important:  how do I use <a11y-input> in an application? How do I bind the person.firstName to the input box within <a11y-input>?\nI have the same questions about your explicit label controls. But before that, I'd like to when to choose  implicit over explicit label controls. You have two sentences on the subject but they don't help me decide if I chose to do the layout myself rather than use your a11y wrapper components.\nI'm so glad to learn about hidden labels. But do I need an entire suite of controls that duplicates  your earlier ones just to restyle the label? Couldn't I just write\n<label for=\"fn\" class=\"hide\">First Name: </label>\n<input id=\"fn\" class=\"form-control\" [(ngModel)]=\"person.firstName\">\nAnd why bother with it at all when I could omit the label and use the cool aria-label that you taught me?\n<input aria-label=\"First name\" class=\"form-control\" [(ngModel)]=\"person.firstName\">\nTo sum it up:\n1. I don't have a clear sense of when to use each alternative.\n2. I'm not sold on the value of <a11y-...> controls; TBH, they feel more intrusive than helpful\n3. I'm not convinced that <a11y-...> controls would work because I can't see how to bind to their inner form controls to the data properties of the components that would use them.\nI don't mean to rain on the parade. You've have really good points in here and have taught me stuff that I didn't know and want to know!\nKeep it going!\n. I agree that it reads better. The reduce would be more efficient if we had a gazillion todos ... an absurdity in itself. Accepting ... after taking it the last step (because of type inference):\nreturn this.todos.filter(todo => !todo.done).length;\nSnuck in a few similar cleanups and spacing for readability. \nThanks.\n. Thanks. Merged.\n. Good catch on the \"If\", I prefer \"With that concern in mind, ...\" to \"It is therefore understood,...\"\nThat's how I'm going to accept your PR. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Done in #1144 \n. Please verify that my amendment works in your timezone. Thx.\n. Well done, Tor!  And thanks also to everyone who reviewed it.\nI scrubbed and adjusted for our latest thinking about RxJS operators and where to configure the in-memory web api.\nI added two more commits:\n1) Removed the Tutorial sample code because it is always the latest part in the series. THIS is now the latest in the series.  I combined the old Tutorial e2e tests with Tor's for this chapter.\n2) Removed the unneeded HeroDetailComponent reference and directive from HeroesComponent as suggested in issue #1398.\nMerging now.\n. Thanks\n. Thanks\n. Component communication cookbook exists. Change Detection guide underway. Closing for now. File again if we don't make good.\n. Hi Ben -\nGreat first-time cookbook!\nI've tweaked it to get around the rough spots, illustrate some of our elements of style, and open some possibilities for the future.\nI linked Title back to the API guide. You can see how for future reference.\nThe plunker is working now. I'm not sure what was wrong or how I fixed it. There were some HTML tags that weren't quite correct (<link> doesn't take a closing tag although most browsers ignore that).\nIt may have been the tabs. All of our code samples use two spaces for tabs.  I converted your code accordingly. Please set your environment to do that automagically.\nOther style points\n\nWe use single quotes for strings in our code.\nWe use less vertical white space and fewer comments than you prefer. I like your approach, especially for your blog. But our chapters are already so huge that we trim that. Another advantage of TypeScript is that the reader can expect more feedback in a supportive IDE so we don't have to tell them how the code works so much.\nWe always use \"we\" instead of \"you\" except in an aside where we're allowing them to go their own way as in \"You could do 'x' but we'd rather not\". \nWe don't reference Angular 1 except in extraordinary situations (and the A1 -> A2 cookbook of course!).  We think others outside the docs should and will do that. But our docs try to stand alone and really be about Angular 2 (which we always refer to simply as Angular).\nThe alert and callout don't work that well, especially for long text. We tend to pull them into the .l-sub-section area or, as I did in your point about the different Title services, pull it into a section of its own, perhaps as an appendix at the bottom.\nI carve up the samples with more #docregion tags to focus the discussion more. I often use the +makeTabs plugin to provide the full source code at the bottom when that feels appropriate. I show how in my tweaks.\nThe compiler complained when you set _titleService in the ctor without first declaring it.  We often leverage TypeScript's ability to declare and set a variable in the ctor params like this:\n\npublic constructor(private _titleService: Title ) { }\n- I love your videos!  We aren't that bold. But we often illustrate running code with animated gifs. I made one for you.\n- We list cookbook topics alphabetically. We lack automation for that. I moved this entry in the _data.json\n- An admin step that I do that you don't have to worry about is make sure there are entries for this cookbook in the JS and Dart language tracks (see their _data.json files and the placeholder jade.\nJust me\nAs other author's know, I have a hard time keeping my hands off the prose.  I elaborated on why you are right to register the Title service in bootstrap when we almost always register application wide services in the root App.Component.\nI added the observation that one could grab the document object and wrestle with the DOM directly ... and why we discourage that.\nThe plunker doesn't show the title changing. This is a problem I first encountered with routing. I provided a little instruction to show you can see the change in pop-up window mode.  \nTell me when it's ready!\nThere is a future task that I hid in Jade comments ... how to use the Title service to set the back/forward buttons in navigation. Maybe you'll take that on at some point. We can talk about it.\nBut I'd be happy to publish now ... or as soon as you give the signal that you think it is ready ... and someone adds an e2e test\nCheers,\nW\n. Where did I do <title>{{ pageTitle }}</title>???\nI thought I was pretty darned clear that wouldn't work ... although I neglected to make it look like a binding so I MUST do that to complete the example.\n<title>{{This_Does_Not_Work}}</title>\nDo you see any ambiguity there? ;-)\n. Sweet!  Merging it now\n. rebased and merged as ec4c1edff44f0730a00b6120ec317082a6480ed5\n. Oh my my. That's a lot of the the's.  Thanks.\n. I'm closing because there does not appear to be an outstanding action item here. Happy to reopen if I misunderstood.\n. Thanks. I know it is counter intuitive but API issues belong on the https://github.com/angular/angular/issues site. Please resubmit this issue there.\n. I don't think we've run it recently. Must check on that.\nI caught a couple more.\nThere is a remaining problem.  We have hidden glossary \"guard\" pages within the guide directories. If someone had an old link to them there (and some of the docs pages might!), these repaired links would be broken. There is no easy way to make them right in both places.\nI'm tempted to delete those guard pages but not sure what I'd break. Look at this another day.\nMerging this.\n. I'd rather not have an issue without a repro and without a course of action.\nPlease correct or close. Thanks.\n. Old. No longer an issue\n. Thanks!\n. I've asked Tero, the author of this chapter, to take a look at this issue.\n. Thanks ... but I'm declining this PR for reasons that you may regard as incorrect. They are reasons nonetheless.\nWe omitted the styles even though they are part of the QS application when you look at it in detail. We also omitted mention of the test configuration files even though those are part of the angular.quickstart repo.\n_These omissions are deliberate.  There are already too many steps and we didn't want to burden the text with anything we didn't consider essential. We don't think there is anything learned by adding css. And while there is much important to be learned by adding testing support, we didn't think that was essential to _starting quickly either.\nThe additional files have been include silently. Maybe that is a mistake. It's one we'll live with for now.\n. You should be able to extend the node_modules in the _examples/package.json to include the ones you need that aren't there already ... unless you're saying you need alternatives to the ones we require now. That would be a problem.\nDo you need your own local package.json? Why?\nIt shouldn't be a problem to have your own tsconfig with a different name and write a bash/command/gulp scripts to invoke them (I'd use gulp). Then you can ignore our standard npm scripts. Do the same with your own protractor.conf and reference it.\nI'd be happy to define an additional scheme for running your e2e-tests as part of the larger run. \nLet's work this out apart from this issue/PR.\nMeanwhile ... want to get this in the documentation as soon as we can.\n. You do not need your own package.json\n- I don't care if our _examples/package.json loads more node_module. Add more. That's ok. It's a one-time hit\n- you can create additional webpack scripts for everything if you don't want to use  gulp. I don't care. Call them tsc:webpack and start:webpack or whatever. Just make sure they don't conflict with the ones we use elsewhere.\n. ### Changes:\nBiggest thing is that the application folder structure must follow the CLI standard which is src/app/...  Please conform to the output of the CLI.  We are migrating everything to that.\nThe next big thing is conversion to RC1. That changes a lot ... including the shims (no angular2-polyfills; add the zones and reflect-metadata shims)\nYour example should begin with the output of the CLI QuickStart.   Basically the minimum out of the box from the CLI.\nAdjust your npm scripts per the above.  I know you tell them npm start. You will create a package.webpack.json that looks the way they should have it (just as we do for package.1.json in QuickStart). But that won't be the one we actually use for developing and running the samples locally within _examples. We'll have npm run start:webpack and such.\nSame game with karma.webpack.conf.js ... if we need one that is different.  I don't think we will for the version.\nWill the webpack version support TDD? What happens when I change an app file?  What's the watching story?\nWe need link(s) to webpack resources where the reader can learn more.\nStanding by to move this along!  Thanks, Jesus!\n. @googlebot chill out. All authors are ok with these commits\n. The cb-webpack/ts/karma.webpack.conf.js is missing from source control so we're getting a BAD FILE for the karma.conf.js file. There is a ts/config/karma.conf.js; is that what we should be showing.\nThe ts/config/karma-test-shim.js is also missing and producing a BAD FILE message.\nPlease make these corrections and review my changes so we can publish this ASAP.\nP.S. What is the workflow for development and testing? Is there the equivalent of browser sync? Am I running development and karma at the same time. Do they refresh as I make code/spec changes? Is that fast?\n. While you're there, please fix \"Configurating Webpack\" -> \"Configuring Webpack\" in the ToC.\n. Sorry ... one more biggish thing.  This is really a guide chapter ... far more than it is a cookbook.\nI love it and I am happy that it is.\nBut that means moving it to Guide and (harder) stripping the cb- prefix everywhere.\nPlease do that and we'll drop it in.  Thanks!\n. I'm convinced.  Merged.\n. @teropa  - how does this relate to the new world version?  My inclination is to stop dev here.\n. We opted to drop the _ prefix and are sweeping the docs to conform.\n. Right. I was stuck.  The partial file exists only because someone might have an old link to it. The proper solution is a redirect to the current location.  I don't know how to do redirects so this was a hack that obviously isn't up to the task.  \nIf someone can teach me how we do redirects, we can fix this one and a few other cases where I used this inferior technique.\nTossing it back to @naomiblack to find the info or the person who can help me.\n. This should be fixed in the real server (but not locally!) by the firebase redirect  in PR #1836 \n. Thanks. Merging.\n. Bad idea. Use other techniques. If temporary, turn change detection off. If you wanted to do what is recommended here, *ngIf would do it. I don't think performance optimizations are a matter of style.\n. @igorminar Really?\nI have not discovered any such advantage when testing. I rarely test the AppComponenf  and therefore anything I would have provided there I must explicitly re-provide for tests of the components that are actually worth testing.\nI like the rule for reasons explained elsewhere but I do not grasp this particular reason.\n.

The branch doesn't bother me (although I'd have created a branch for myself). We can work around it.\nIt is so generous of you to work on this contribution. Unfortunately, I fear that you'll have to rework it entirely as we are about to refresh the entire ToH series to align with the CLI and I'm afraid of what that will do to your flow. \nThe CLI is typescript only. In a sense, that leaves the JS version free to remain as is. But I'm not sure that is a good idea and it will complicate our end-to-end testing.\nNo matter what, you will want to update for RC1 as well.\nBecause there is so much that you'd have to redo ...

Yes, we do apply rxjs operators before we talk about them. Maybe you have a better idea for teaching this.  But I don't think the solution is to add an import that you don't actually need.\nWe do call out the need to Enable RxJS Operators in the http chapter.  \nI'm closing your PR with a tinge of regret.  Thanks for helping.\n. Thanks, but that is incorrect. We need both package names as both packages exist. This is being handled in a forthcoming docs update to router documentation\n. > the callback passed to the Observable#map method will never be called, if the response status code is <200 or >=300. \nSadly I believe you are misinformed. The current http and backend pass responses with status codes outside the 200 range as SUCCESSFUL results. I read the source code you cited and it confirms my understanding. I've also tested it. Where do YOU see that it redirects the observable on to the failure path?\nIt is perfectly reasonable for these Angular widgets to behave this way. The server did not fail in its response. It delivered a response ... that happens to be a 404 or whatever. It's up to the caller to determine whether that was the desired result (maybe you wanted a 404?) or not.\nA future version of http may behave differently. But today's version does exactly what I said.  It is the responsibility of the app to weed out responses with \"bad\" response codes ... exactly as the sample shows.\nWe make that point explicitly in the Http chapter.\nThanks for contributing.\n. Hmmm. I can assure you that was NOT there when this chapter was written. \nMoreover, while I anticipate seeing such logic in a future version of http, it is definitely an error (I will report it) for the low level XhrConnection to do this. It is up to the the higher level module to determine how to handle a non-200 response.\nThanks for forcing the issue. Looks like we'll have to fix the chapter. See PR #1415\n.

We are not using the new new router until it is ready\n. Demo PR. Closing it\n. @michaeljota We all like barrels. What has changed is that they are now considered a matter of personal style, not Angular style.\nThere was a time when we thought they would be almost essential for aggregating access to components. After modules were introduced, that purpose melted away. They still have utility for aggregating model and service classes; I'm sure they are useful elsewhere too.\nSystemJS is not a factor in this decision. Barrels and SystemJS get along fine.\nKeep using barrels as you find them helpful. We have decided not to restore barrels to the Style Guide. This issue is closed.. you are correct. Thanks!\n. you are correct. Thanks!\n. Like it.  But I'm going to reject it because we deliberately do NOT provide this kind of detail here. Immediately after the display of package.json we direct the reader to a discussion of the package.json in another guide chapter.\nWe also hide this entire discussion when the user opts to hide explanations. It would not have been hidden where you put it.\nI appreciate the thought but I have to make tough decisions. In the absence of concrete evidence that anyone was actually confused, I must demur. \n.

Go for it!\n. Is it ready to merge?\n. That should be good enough.\nFor those who need more, Angular itself follows this convention as does Microsoft and most of the programming world. Citations when we have a moment. \nLike many conventions, it's difficult to justify in the abstract. We can say that many developers care about the naming conventions that proclaim how an identifier is defined: class or property, constant or variable. These needs change with time: the 'i' in interface, the '_' for privates, Hungarian notation for data type... once essential, now proscribed.\nIt's far from my favorite recommendation. I'd put this one in the \"consider\" category.\n. We will continue to support the non-CLI approach in its own cookbook. We agree with @filipeaguiar  that it is valuable to understand how Angular 2 can work without the CLI. Moreover, there will be many who cannot use the CLI because of certain CLI requirements that they can't meet.\nThat said, we are moving judiciously toward CLI-based documentation because that is/will be the smoothest learning path and, for most, the most productive path. \nRegardless, 90+% of the documentation applies equally to both modalities. \n.

But I don't see how to make your point actionable and there is no use pretending that we're going to do it on our own.\n. Thanks. Merged\n. Very nice. I agree. Slight wording change. Merging. Thanks.\n. Thanks.  I'm going to close w/o merging because that chapter is not even close to ready and shouldn't have been visible at all. Sorry to have troubled you.\n. Closed by #1561 \n. Superseded by PR #1561\n. Great job. I made one final change to capture the final suites passed/failed status report inside protractor-results.txt.  This picks up the test suites that were missing from the results because protractor couldn't compile them (the specs, not the app).\nMany such un-compilable tests remain because we haven't swept them and added proper type annotations. That's the next todo.\n. Actually, you misunderstood the example. The one you \"corrected\" is meant to demonstrate property binding. \nI think I can clarify the label so that is more obvious.\nClosed by PR #1568\n. And I think I have improved it. Thanks for bringing it to my attention.\n. This pr has served its purpose.\n. This is incomplete in several respects\n- [ ] Let's keep shims together. The new polyfil should be moved up near (just below?) the other browser shim. If it must be where it is, explain why.\n- [ ] We can't get this from npm? Why.

If only here, must update the chapter so that the reader knows to add this shim.\n- [ ] If should add this shim everywhere, then explain in the Quickstart and add to all index.html.\n- [ ] If should add this shim everywhere, reconcile with the CLI's position on shims (I don't know what that is).\nSorry, I know this is a royal PITA. But just slapping a shim into the example is not the answer.\n. Will look\n. Here is (perhaps) pertinent excerpt from link checker run last night.

Thanks!\n. I piggy-backed e2e changes on your pr. They are in their own commit.  We're in good shape after this merge.\n. Please post to angular, not angular.io\n. Thanks.\n. Proceeding with the agreement that @chalin will fix what we broke in Dart at his convenience.\n. LGTM\n. Merged. No harm in being clear. Thanks.\n. I tweaked the text and merged. Thanks @Foxandxss and @filipesilva.\nLooking forward to the companion CLI cookbook\n. We agree! We had to postpone on our road to final. We're rev'ing up to review this, clean it up, and get it done.\n. Thanks!\n. Closed by 59408b1\n. Rebased and squashed. Tweaking some of the prose and samples.\nThe most important things I did were\n- rename \"validation\" to \"form-validation\".  Folders and references adjusted accordingly.\n- rename \"model\" to \"reactive\" in labels and files\n- tighten the reactive TS code for readability\nMore prose fixes to come.\n. Putting this on hold until key architectural questions are answered\nI really enjoyed reviewing this cookbook. It brought some nagging questions into sharper relief.\nThe more I looked at it, the more I felt that we remain uncomfortably unclear on the ReactiveForms value proposition.\nFrankly, I fail to see anything particularly reactive in the Reactive form approach. We need some insight here that perhaps @kara can supply.\nI dispelled the myth that the template approach involves more, ugly HTML.  It seemed to me that myth arises from primitive examples rather than the template approach per se. \nYes, the primitive examples bake error logic and messages into the HTML as we see in the first example. But this is not an intrinsic defect of the template approach. In my last commit I showed an intermediate Template 2 form that _uses the same validation message code as in the Reactive form example_.  \nI aligned code and html for Template 1, Template 2, and Reactive 3 examples such that the reader can see the progression and true differences.\nI am troubled by the claim that the reactive approach is easier to test. There isn't any evidence in support of the notion in this example (although there is an opening for a testability claim in my comments below).\nAFAIK, the substantive differences between template and reactive approaches are:\n1) Reactive defines the form controls in code within the component class; layout and styling remain in html.\n2) Reactive defines the validation functions in code within the component class rather than as HTML validation attributes.\nMy intuition is that developers will find #2 to be the most significant. It also creates an architectural dilemma.  \nOTOH, having validation in code rather than attributes has advantages:\n- richer validation logic is possible\n- the validation logic could be re-factored into the model (or model metadata) rather than hard-coded in the component.\n- the validation logic can be tested independently of the component's interaction with its template, especially if refactored into the model.\nOTOH, the glaring negative is lack of ARIA support. It's easy but tedious to add that support manually (I updated the sample with a hint in that direction). Ideally the Angular library can do more to be helpful.\n. Talked to Kara and got some additional clarification on required and ARIA. \nI removed the isRequired function which is tough to talk about and not recommended by her. She says we should keep the required attribute and add Validator.required. Do both. We'll only need the validator function in a future version of forms; it will add the required attribute for us.\n. Added a custom validation ... as that is something you can do easily with Reactive Forms and can't do AFAIK with the Template-driven.\nAt this point the cookbook has evolved rather considerably from the inspirational version by @DeborahK .\nReady for a review.\n. I just learned about that from @kara. \nNow I'm torn.  I think it is important to see where the true differences are w/r/t validation in the two approaches.  I thought custom validation might have been one of them. It would have been a shame not to show it.\nNow that I know there is symmetry (if not parity) on that front, I'm not sure what to do.  Pulling custom validation out seems to undersell the story.\nI agree there is more to cover ... cross-field, async, who knows what else. Can't do it all in here.\nThinking.\n. Decided that we should show custom validation so that readers know it is possible. By putting the validation logic in its own file (in the shared folder), we postpone discussion to the bottom of the cookbook so that it doesn't distract from the main story.\nI think this works. \nEnough already. Merging it.\n. closed by PRs\n. What is the state of this? It is difficult for me to review when there is a mix of Dart and TS changes.\nThe TS changes LGTM.  Maybe it is better if Kathy merges this one.\n. LGTM.  I don't know about @Foxandxss question but if we messed up, we can fix it.\n.

A lot of hard work went into getting this right. Much appreciated and happy to merge.\n. I've been lobbying to remove this rule. Haven't got it done yet. \nBUT ... you can stop Codelyzer from enforcing that rule. Codelyzer relies on tslint so do what you would do to configure/control tslint behavior.\n1. Everywhere in your app\nOpen tslint.json and set \"use-host-property-decorator\": false,\n2. Disable in one file\nAbove the offending line add: /* tslint:disable:use-host-property-decorator */\n. It turns out that we have followed advice (1) in our documentation development. You can keep that rule for yourself if you find it valuable and pursue advice (2) on a case-by-case basis.  I don't see us changing the rule implementation itself.. Sorry but I have a different perspective on this. \nI'm generally in favor of DRY. But not when it comes to sharing content-specific material/tests across samples. Test infrastructure? Of course we do! But specific tests? I'm uncomfortable with that.\nWhy? Because it binds the toh parts together. Now I can break tests for toh-2 when I make changes to toh-4. I don't like that kind of vulnerability.\nI DO like that you uncovered some bugs. Let's fix those independently.\nOtherwise, ... sorry ... I'm declining this PR.\nLeaving it open (briefly) to allow comments and so you can mine the bug fixes in a separate PR.\n. I'm sorry, Patrice, but I'm going to have to insist on the \"non-DRY\" part. I hate doing that. I hate it more because my instincts align with yours.  But that just isn't how ToH is set up.\nObserve that the ToH code samples do not share code. They too are far from DRY.  Your argument in favor of DRY would apply equally there. And yet we didn't do it. Why?\nBecause we decided - rightly or wrongly - to insulate each ToH tutorial for its comrades.  If we change that, we can change the tests. I don't think we should be DRY in the tests and WET in the code.  \nWe don't have time to revisit that decision now.\nI'm sorry. Hate to be heavy handed. Please forgive me.\n. Please follow the PR naming standard as you see amended here.\n. Actually, the situation is much worse than you describe. \nWe kept this section mostly intact when we translated from the deprecated router to the v.3 router. Unfortunately, the new version only has a one element parameter array and therefore doesn't illustrate the possibilities of a multi-valued parameters array at all.\nWe need to rewrite/rethink this entire section.  See issue #1868\n. Before committing I adjusted redirect's pathMatch explanation and also replaced <base href=\".\"> with <base href=\"/\"> because (and I should have discovered this much earlier) '.' doesn't work for deep linking to child routes.\n. I agree. And many thanks!\nBut why stop with this file? Fix 'em all. That's what I did with #1816 which supersedes your PR here.\n. Oh. Sorry. But you really did the most important thing by calling it out. The rest took me 15 minutes. Thanks again.\n. Please update ts/architecture.jade as follows:\nline 84: \"Look inside such a file and we'll see a declaration such as this one.\"\nline 384: \"They tend to appear within an element tag as attributes do,\"\n. I am uncomfortable with certain changes in the e2e tests, most especially the tests-that-are-not-tests such as \nit(`selects ${targetHero.name} from hero list`, function () {\n    let hero = element(by.cssContainingText('li', targetHero.name));\n    hero.click();\n    // Nothing specific to expect other than lack of exceptions.\n  });\nand\nit(`can update hero name`, () => {\n    addToHeroName(nameSuffix);\n    // Nothing specific to expect other than lack of exceptions.\n  });\nThe second is also not accepted because it delegates to addToHeroName, a helper function that is used exactly ONCE, in this place only. That move detracts from readability and maintenance w/o compensating benefits.\nI think I know why you created these tests; they are a clever way to slip in an async operation w/o waiting for it. But they depend upon test order which test suites should not do. Move one of these tests and the suite fails.\nI realize that a great number of our e2e tests have this failing (when you see beforeAll loading the browser just once, you can guess that cross-test pollution is a likely risk). I accept that to make these tests faster. But I don't accept splitting what is actually ONE test over two tests in order to avoid the async setup operation.  Please think of a better way.\n. Unfortunately, this PR is NOT based on an IdeaBlade branch. That means I can't fix it.\nYou and Kathy have the ability to add branches to ideablade/angular.io. \nPlease base all future PRs on branches in  ideablade/angular.io or at least all future branches that involve this many changes. That has been the long standing practice for members of the author team.\n. Thanks. Merging.\n. 1) Yes you can change it (that's implied) to whatever is necessary. Might have to after the CLI shakeup. Did you notice the bit about how to set it dynamically ... for plunkers?\n2) Helpful perhaps ... but this is a long chapter and the explanation would be lengthy, sad, unconvincing, annoying, confounding, and depressing.  Let's leave it as is.\n3) Fixed in an update that I should be published soon (as in \"tomorrow\")\n4) What words are missing? You think I should say \"in the future\"? That's certainly not necessary in English.\n5) You're right. You're right about all of the routing constants. If they're going to be constants they should be in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.  We have a mix of lower camelCase and PascalCase. Both are wrong.  Let's get that fixed. I think they should be constants so they should be UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.\n6) Why? What would that serve? And TS type inference will tell you.\n7 & 8)  I tried all kinds of ways to show the imports with the ctor ... and I couldn't find anything that didn't obscure the message. The full code with imports is available in the milestone code tabs.  I think I'll let this sit until/unless we learn it is a real problem.\n9) Thanks. See PR #1837\n10) Placeholder for future discussion. But I think you're right to question having them here as a tease. Removing them. See PR #1837\n11) Would have included by makeExampleTabs can show a maximum of 8 tabs. We could fix THAT ... but didn't want to go there right now.\nTherefore, the user will have to get from plunker if s/he really wants it ... which s/he shouldn't. Because it's NOT the kind of service you'd want to emulate. It's a hacky mock. No real loss by omitting it.\n12)  It's a good question. The short answer is that the QueryParams belong to the entire route, from top to leaf (and thus come from the RouteState) whereas the params belong to the route segment, known as the ActivatedRoute.  \nYou can see by this answer that it just begs for more discussion about these distinctions. We didn't get into that yet. We will when we cover matrix parameters.\n. To your list, I'm adding:\n- interfaces.ts should be something else; that term is too broad. See next.\n- maybe have a folder for top level routing stuff called /routing and move the loose stuff into it.\n- The current contents of interfaces.ts are really guard service classes and interfaces.Maybe rename this one can-deactivate-guard.service maybe.\n-  .guard isn't an \"approved\" extension in the StyleGuide. Rename classes with approved .service extension.\n- The .routes extension has been approved and will be added to the StyleGuide\n- We should follow the StyleGuide and change all constants to UPPER_SNAKE_CASE. That means HEROES_ROUTES (or HERO_ROUTES?), not HeroesRoutes. And export const ROUTES, not routes.\nNo PR for these yet.\n. 1) See how we do it for plunker, as described here\n4) meh :-)\n6) Fixed in PR\n5) PR #1848 changes style recommendation for const variable naming to lowerCamelCase\n. Closing after merging #1848. \nIf you have new recommendations, please create a new issue.\n. @kwalrath I'm leaving this to you to merge. Not my department.\nPersonally, I wouldn't do this. I'd fix the angular side.\n. I like what I see here. I didn't review every detail; deferring to @Foxandxss on those.\n. Should we warn against node v.6?

I will squash and merge (no one cares about the steps)\n. Merging on @chalin approval.\n. We WILL have style guidelines for it soon. Do you want to add it back when we do? Or keep as a placeholder?\n. LGTM\n. Merging because @chalin and @filipesilva say so. Presumably they'll fix a busted CI.\n. I agreed that the prose needed work. I updated and force pushed and now you can't see what the passage was before I rewrote it. Here is my new version:\n\nWhy declare angular as any?\nA strongly typed angular reference to Angular 1 would be great. But we can't import its UMD typings library, @types/angular, without also importing Angular 1 itself via import * as angular from 'angular'.\nAngular 1 is currently loaded by a script tag in index.html and switching to an ES6 import at this time is not worth the considerable effort. Instead we declare angular as an untyped any to avoid typing errors.\n\nIf you two have no further objections AND my update survives Travis, I'll merge this in after lunch.\n. Closed by 8c1bbbf\n. Closed by #1951\n. Please no gulp task called check  Check what? I don't approve.  \nI do understand the impulse. It comes down to naming. I strongly prefer one of these alternatives (in my preferred order)\n1. an option on harp-compile such as harp-compile --no-build\n2. new  build-compile task that is check-deploy without the deploy.\n. Please also update the READM.md to explain these gulp tasks-and-options.\nOtherwise, LGTM\n. LGTM. @kwalrath is free to merge :+1: \n. Aaarg. Please create a separate PR to fix when you have a chance.\n. Actually ... it isn't lazy loaded. We'd like to make it lazy loaded someday soon, now that lazy loading is almost here (RC5). But it isn't yet so the code is correct.\nWe're also changing our position on the + prefix. We're softening from \"do\" to \"consider\" because there have been problem with servers that don't allow this prefix. And when we try something different (e.g., _), other servers don't like that. We can't find a prefix that works on all servers. And many of us don't think having a prefix is sufficiently compelling to overcome the grief.\n. There's a race condition in which the gulp plunker-builder task starts before the _copy-example-boilerplate task updates the samples with shared files from _examples.  This race may have been there all along. This PR revealed it  ... because the new a2docs.css file didn't show up in time and therefore wasn't included in the plunkers.\nFix that before proceeding with this PR\nPlease note: this PR creates the new a2docs.css file and populates the samples with it. But it does not change the way samples display because they don't know about it.\nWhen we have confirmed that we like this new css file - a @naomiblack task - we'll need another PR  (TBD) that propagates it to all doc samples by changing the generated filename from a2docs.css to styles.css;  this works because all samples install styles.css today and the new a2docs.css style sheet incorporates everything currently in styles.css (to be confirmed).\n. Thank you, @AlmeroSteyn !  And @Foxandxss for taking it the last mile.\n. Ok if you say so. Merging.\n. Replaced by ngModules chapter PR #2029\n. LGTM.  Ping me when you've made those tiny adjustments we discussed and I will merge it.\n. I suspect that the example in the API guide is incorrect. At least I can't make it work. I filed issue #10134 over in the angular repo.\nYou're right that they are called. For example, I was able to demonstrate that ngAfterViewInit is called (see below). I just couldn't do anything with it that seemed useful.  Directives don't have templates. Therefore, I don't see how they could have template views or projected content.\nI thought perhaps the directive could reach into the component whose element matches its selector. \n``\n@Directive({\n  selector: 'after-view'\n})\nexport class AfterViewDirective {\n  // Query for a VIEW child of typeChildViewComponent`\n  @ViewChild(ChildViewComponent) viewChild: ChildViewComponent;\n  @ViewChild('container_ref') containerChild\nngAfterViewInit() {\n    debugger;\n    this.viewChild; // undefined\n    this.containerChild; // undefined\n  }\n}\n//////////////////////\n@Component({\n  selector: 'after-view',\n  template: <div #container_ref>-- child view begins --</div>\n      <my-child></my-child>\n    <div>-- child view ends --</div>,\n directives: [ChildViewComponent] // not shown; its selector is 'my-child'\n})\nexport class AfterViewComponent { }\n////////////\n@Component({\n  selector: 'after-view-parent',\n  template: <h2>AfterView</h2>\n    <after-view></after-view>,\n  directives: [AfterViewComponent, AfterViewDirective]\n})\nexport class AfterViewParentComponent {}\n```\nbut the viewChild  and containerChild were  undefined.\nShow me a sample (e.g., a plunker) that gets such view-or-content and we'll have something to talk about.\n. I'm out of my depth. Since @filipesilva approves, in it goes\n. Closing as #2198 was merged\n. Thanks. Merged.\n. I thought the default was no-dart except for check-deploy.\ngulp check-deploy (and the new variation that does a check w/o deploy) should do all languages.

I'll take yours.\n. I like these changes ... except the word \"pattern\".  Although you are technically correct that it is a pattern, semantically it's about search terms.  I can roll with this if Patrice doesn't mind sticking with that.\nI'm happy to fix as i merge or he can update. I'm standing by.\n. I'm confused. I thought the topic was \"Dynamic Forms\" (plural). \"Dynamic Form\" (singular) sounds weird. What was the problem?\n. um ... OK.  I think I understand. Don't want to waste precious time here. Let's move on.\n. @kwalrath Exactly!  I'll fix it as I merge it\n. Sorry but I cannot find evidence that ES 2016 has been ratified. I see predictions that it will be ratified in June 2016 but maybe it didn't actually happen?\nIf I'm wrong, please send evidence.\n. Thanks.  I looked but not the right place. Merging (after a few more tweaks)\n. While you are technically correct, I don't see how we're misleading anyone into making a mistake nor do I see how the distinction you're making between decorators and factories would have practical value.\nYou are welcome to submit a PR with improved language. I'm closing for lack of a specific action.\n. We do not recommend the $ suffix. It smacks of Hungarian notation.  But neither do we wish to prohibit it.

My only point of disagreement is about whether to show import statements in the extracts.\nAs I explained above, I am reluctant to do so because I feel that it distracts from the code.  Someone who wants to know where those thing actually come from can see that in a heartbeat by looking at the full code in the plunker.\nI don't know that I'm \"right\" about this choice. I can only say that I think I have a good reason. Let's see what our audience thinks.\nThanks so much!\np.s.: I know this is incomplete. I have many more sections to go.

Ill have a chance to review when I return on Monday. @foxandxss maybe you can get a jump on this and make sure it is ready to go. Thanks everyone!\n. Thanks!  Merged with slight change.\n. Thanks for taking this on. I appreciate the effort and your care.\nI don't think we should add an entire file just to delete the <h1> . The maintenance burden is not worth it. You can see the problems already. For example, your version still has the title property which shouldn't be there. And all those irrelevant #docregion tags.\nI think the world will survive an extra <h1>, especially if we tell folks to delete it.\nYour other change to ToH-6 is important.\nI incorporated these thoughts into #2264. Closing yours. Thanks.\n. Thanks. Merged\n. It doesn't hurt. But it's a mistake. I'll fix.  Hang tight.\n. Looks like the mistake is in the statement. A routed component doesn't have to be exported but it must be declared in a module and, unless that module is lazy loaded, that module must be imported in another module as well. Fixed by pr #2304\n. @mlaval @Foxandxss Hi folks. Mind looking at my edits here? Mostly links and language.\n. @vicb Can you point to where this appears in our docs and what we should be doing? As I recall, our only mention of  <template [ngIf]=\"\" is during our discussion of how Angular desugars <something *ngIf=\"\"\nIn that discussion we have illustrative code. But that is in keeping with the explanation of how it works, not a recommendation.\n<ng-container> is not yet documented in angular.io.  Didn't know it existed. <ng-content> I knew about. How would we know about <ng-container> ?  It's not in the API docs (as you say, it's a \"special Angular construct\", not a class). What is it for? \n. @vicb At long last, I'm working on this in #3110 . Now superseded by #2491\n. Thank you!  We're working on it pronto!\n. Made moot by new angular/angular/aio.. @Foxandxss Yes ... we don't want 404s when you toggle from one lang to another.\n. We can't merge until you have a CLA that Github recognizes.\nNormally I take care of that by adding you to our IdeaBlade google group (you're covered under our CLA). But that isn't working here because you're github contributions are in the name of \"niceredfrog\" which doesn't have an associated email address.\nI can enroll you in our group but only with a github-recognized email address. I've sent you an invitation to join that group using the email associated with your commits.  You may have to update the niceredfrog profile with that address.\nIf you don't want to do that (not clear why; anyone looking at your commits can see the email address as I did), you can sign your own personal CLA.\n. Travis reports that this jade doc is broken.  Confirmed by running gulp serve-and-sync-devguide and going to the \"User Input\" chapter.\nThe cause in this case is a blank line after :marked (line 177). That's a familiar problem for Harp.  I'll leave it to you to fix. Please know that we generally can't merge PRs that Travis rejects and certainly can't merge broken jade pages.\n. I just registered your github email with the appropriate IdeaBlade google group. You have to accept the email ... and then automation should kick in. Although by the looks of it, you're already past the CLA stage.\n. Reminder that the jade is still broken because of blank line at l.178\n. Good catch! I have a large number of changes stacked up in pr #2396 so I've incorporated this one in that PR.\n. I hear you. TBH, we've got higher priorities than striving for perfect alignment of our samples. \nAs @Foxandxss says, our goal is thematic consistency (so we're not repeatedly explaining the sample use case). We do not aspire to cross-sample code consistency.. This is fine. Thanks.\n. How did // #docregion cookbook creep into Jade pages? What was the intention?\nMerging\n. I beg to differ. The type-parameter passed to the Promise constructor is perfectly correct in all languages that support generics properly. It should work in Java too.\nThat said, the example code is horrible (which I am allowed to say because I wrote it :)).\nIn a PR #2991, I change it to the following:\nts\n  getHeroesSlowly(): Promise<Hero[]> {\n    return new Promise(resolve => {\n      // Simulate server latency with 2 second delay\n      setTimeout(() => resolve(this.getHeroes()), 2000);\n    });\n  }\n@aluanhaddad I like type inference too. Within the docs, our policy is to state public method return types explicitly on the method signature so that you can tell at a glance while reading the code what the method returns.. @aluanhaddad true (until TS 2.1 I think). I would hope that I didn't make that mistake. I also hope that anyone who sees explicit typing of  Promise<any> or Promise<void> realizes that the returned value is uninteresting; what matters is that it resolves or errors.\nStructural typing is not as safe as nominal typing ... by design. That's why we say that TypeScript provides \"static typing\" not \"strict typing\".  It's still JavaScript after all.  On balance, I'm happy with the compromises.. This was merged some time ago.\n. Oops. I guess not. Revived in PR #2467\n. Thanks. Picked it up in pr #2453 \n. You are correct. Have merged a correction in PR #2458\n. Thanks. Picked it up in PR #2453 \n. This PR responds to the concern in issue #2527 by deleting the offending section\n. Thanks. Incorporating in a PR #2490 that makes version updates.\n. @rolandoldengarm This is a minimum, introductory chapter. We'll be revising as more i18n features and ergonomics arrive. Thanks for the feedback though.\n. @rolandoldengarm  Almost ready with this PR.\nQuick answers to your questions:\n1) This PR will mention that you cannot change the language dynamically. You must re-load the web page. That's because the language-substitution happens as a compile step, not as the app runs.\nThis makes sense to me. The facility described here is for static content in the component templates, not live content from a database. Therefore, there is no obvious benefit to re-translating fixed text for every component as it loads. That would make the page slower and heavier.\nIt seems also a safe bet that users aren't changing language in the middle of their work. A page re-load at the start (if you loaded the wrong version), is a small price for smooth running throughout the session.\n2) There is a separate facility, not yet documented, for handling pluralization: i18nPluralPipe. Please give it a try. If you have an issue, please file that on the angular site, not here!\nCheers.\n. Made moot by replacing this site with angular/angular/aio. I am rebasing and reviewing and will force push so beware\n. I reviewed it and cleaned up some prose. It's in good shape except for the todos below.\nI rebased and force-pushed so delete your local branch and check it out again. \nOutstanding issues:\n- [ ] Doesn't compile anymore since the Protractor PR changed our setup. Mostly duplicate typing errors\n- [ ] No obvious way for readers to get the samples.\n- [ ]  I don't think Rollup works in Windows when its configuration file is named rollup.js; as I recall it should be named something else like rollup.config.js.\n- [ ] Use AppRoutingModule instead of routes in AppModule ... or understand why that does not work.\n. I've extended the gulpfile's e2e facility so it can run the same e2e.specs against the AoT build of an app when ~/aot/index.html is defined.\nIt's primitive and rigid but it works as seen in the toh-6 in his  PR. That means no need for a separate aot project folder (toh-6-aot is gone).\nThe \"trick\" is that the AoT version of the index.html is in the /aot folder and to run it you serve from within /aot!\nStill don't have a good way to demonstrate this to our readers. The instructions in the prose describe what to do if you've cloned the repo.\n. This is on our backlog and I hope to get to it soon. The testing doc sample includes a test that uses the MockBackend. We just haven't documented it yet.\nSee https://github.com/angular/angular.io/blob/master/public/docs/_examples/testing/ts/app/model/http-hero.service.spec.ts. Closing for reasons stated by Brandon\n. I think we just remove this file altogether.\n. Closing because we do not agree that these are typos ... except the one\n. Thanks!\n. Good catch!\n. The statement \n\nThis limits the scope of the CrisisService to the Crisis Center routes. No module outside of the Crisis Center can access it.\"\nis incorrect for precisely the reasons you state. We are doing a small rewrite of this chapter and the modules part in particular in PR #2478 and I'll make sure this is corrected if it hasn't been already.\n\nI agree that the statement about service loading needs to be revisited at the same time.\nThanks.\n. In the re-write we dropped the entire \"Service Isolation\" section. It's not relevant to routing and requires a discussion best left to the NgModule chapter. Closed by PR #2478\n. oops. Thanks\n. I think you missed the critical difference between the eagerly loaded AppModule and the lazy_ loaded CrisisCenterModule. That difference resolves the apparent contradiction.\nWe talk about this difference in numerous places including the FAQs. Do you have a specific recommendation about how we can make that more clear? \n. @alindsay55661: My statement isn't false. It's true. You ONLY get something resembling module scoping if you lazy load the module. And that is not an aspect of modules, it's an aspect of how the router works.\nI agree that this is not as easy to follow as I would like.  I do not have a better way of expressing it at this time. With respect I must say that your proposal does not strike me as sufficiently better. Others have asked me to remove much of the repetition. \n@falconmick Suppose you do eagerly load a module that you formerly loaded lazily? Something \"bad\" (i.e., breaking) happens ONLY if your feature module deliberately tried to shadow (replace) a provider defined in the root injector. Now you may have a reason to do that! But I'll bet it is rare and that you'll be aware that you did that intentionally ... in which case you will not be tempted to eagerly load that module.\nThere is very little risk from having a feature-specific provider in the Feature Module promoted to the root injector. Who is going to know? Who (outside of the feature) will inject it?  You can object on purist grounds but there is little to worry about in practice. And if you are a purist, you will have followed my advice to purists and provided the service in the top component for that feature. \nIf you added a provider to the root level component (AppComponent), that service will be available to every routed component from an eagerly loaded module.\nLazy loaded modules are different. They do NOT have access to anything provided in the AppComponent (or its subcomponents). They only have access the root injector services (above AppComponent) and the provided services within the context of the lazy loaded module.\nI wish I knew an easy way to say this. If you wish to challenge the design, please send your comments to the angular site. \n. Please reference the specific place.\nI'm not following you. IfAppModule and AppComponent source files are siblings, then import { AppComponent } from './app.component'; is correct.\n. Ah. Ugh. That's bizarre and bares no relation to any sample that we actually have. Fixing it in PR #2535\n. Closed by #2535\n. Please raise your quarrel about the API documentation on angular. This repo is for issues about angular documentation.\nIn our defense, the DI guide is correct in saying:\n\n@Injectable() marks a class as available to an injector for instantiation. Generally speaking, an injector will report an error when trying to instantiate a class that is not marked as @Injectable().\n\nGenerally speaking you'll get an error if you try to inject a service class without the @Injectable  because generally speaking services have constructor dependencies and you will get an error if you neglect the decorator on a service with constructor dependencies.\nWe recommend adorning all services with the @Injectable because its a simple standard that can save you some grief and you can't go wrong following it.\nNow that we have that out of the way, we can concede that the wording should be much better.\nWe intend to revisit the two DI chapters and fix many things ... including the wording around @Injectable.  We probably won't take up this particular issue before the rewrite.\nI'll leave this open for now. \n. Closed by ec1c8281e26fcf9a3920c6c9521ed4d94e6bbfe4\n. Restored as new PR #2565\n. Restored as new PR #2565\n. Can't reopen until there is a reproduction. I just ran the code locally and it works exactly as described. I don't doubt that you have a different experience. But we can't fix something we don't see.\nI notice in your report that you're running the site at \"www.ng2finaltut.debvm Port 80\". When we say locally we mean \"localhost\" and some port. For example, right now I'm navigating successfully to http://localhost:3000/detail/12.  \nThis leads me to believe that your server is not configured to allow for deep linking at all. I'm no good at apache configuration but I'm pretty sure that is the place to look. By contrast, the lite-server supporting the sample is a node express server specifically designed to recognize these requests as deep links and to serve  index.html so that the Angular router in the client side app can process that URL.\n. Can't reopen until there is a reproduction. I just ran the code locally and it works exactly as described. I don't doubt that you have a different experience. But we can't fix something we don't see.\nI notice in your report that you're running the site at \"www.ng2finaltut.debvm Port 80\". When we say locally we mean \"localhost\" and some port. For example, right now I'm navigating successfully to http://localhost:3000/detail/12.  \nThis leads me to believe that your server is not configured to allow for deep linking at all. I'm no good at apache configuration but I'm pretty sure that is the place to look. By contrast, the lite-server supporting the sample is a node express server specifically designed to recognize these requests as deep links and to serve  index.html so that the Angular router in the client side app can process that URL.\n. Did I miss one? I think I got those.\n. Sorry the passage confused you. It is factually accurate and makes an important point. \nWe are declaring a number of things in ContactModule. All of those things belong to that module. NONE of them would be usable in any component outside of ContactModule ...\n... unless they were listed in ContactModule.exports ... which ContactComponent is.\nHaving exported  ContactComponent, any OTHER module that imports ContactModule (e.g., AppModule) will be able to reference ContactComponent in one of its component templates (e.g, AppComponent).\nHad we not done so, AppComponent could not display the ContactComponent.\nWhere do you see us exporting ContactModule?  Ahhh. You mean the ES2016 export class ContactModule statement.\nYou have fallen victim to the unfortunate similarity (and confusion) of ES2016 export statements and NgModule export properties.\nThis is a distinction you just have to learn. \n.

You're right. Took too long to get to it. Thanks.. Thanks. Rendered moot by the complete redesign of this documentation site in angular/angular/aio.. @laco0416 The documentation samples adopt a standard approach that relies on SystemJS. It is a good approach that will carry you safely to a production app of any scale.  We are comfortable encouraging people to follow it.\nAs @Foxandxss observes it is not the only approach.  The CLI, for example, takes a different approach, one that relies on Webpack.  That's also great ... when you have the CLI to help you.  In our opinion, it is much harder to explain how to setup and build the app correctly with Webpack without the CLI. We want people to focus on Angular, not setting up the environment for Angular.\nAs @Foxandxss explains, Angular itself is independent of the module bundling and loading technology. You have choices. Which choice is best for you? You'll have to decide. We've decided that the SystemJS path is our best option for samples that do not depend upon the CLI. As it happens, a significant number of users will not be able to use the CLI. They may find comfort in our SystemJS-based guidance; they may develop their own tooling to go the WebPack way. \nIn any case, we need to be clear that there is no best way for everyone.  Our commitment is to steer you down a viable path and to be consistent. I think we've met that goal.\n@jetlogs I cannot say for sure but I'm guessing that webpack has nothing to do with the error. I'm betting the problem relates to AoT compilation constraints. Unfortunately, we don't have the resources to debug everyone's application code. You'll have to seek community help or create a simple repro ... and submit that to the angular site, not this documentation site.\n. Closed because incorporated in Kapunahele's PR #2508\n. I just addressed this in an update to \"Template Syntax\" in PR #2639.\n. Closed by PR #2639\n. I'm sorry but I cannot repro.  I just took that sample, cleared node_modules, re-installed with the latest (v.2.1.0), re-ran the sample and it runs fine.\nYour main.ts has one change ... {providers} to  {providers: providers} ... which is completely immaterial. They are the same thing.\nI'm closing this as \"not a bug\"\n. I don't believe that tick is necessary. The test passes w/o it. Do you have evidence to the contrary?\n. Thanks for clarifying. In general there is no harm in extra call to tick() just as there is no harm to an extra call to fixture.detectChanges. But there is no bug here and I'm closing because there is no problem\n. I'm in the process of  reviewing and copy editing. \nMy biggest change so far is moving the code from the js/ tree to the ts/ tree (for reasons I can explain offline). \nIn keeping with official Google style, I've changed the person from \"we\" to \"you\".\nIs there some reason for repeatedly writing \"ES6 JavaScript\" and \"ES5 JavaScript\"?  I find the text and instructions easier to follow when I see \"ES6\" and \"ES5\" instead. I've been changing to that form. Stop me if I shouldn't be doing that (it's easy to fix)\n. Heavily refactored the samples so they look more like what we might actually write. Most importantly, each language dialect has an AppComponent, an AppModule, and a main that simply boots the AppModule.\nAdded many more ES5 DSL examples too.\n. Thanks. We did this in a different PR. \n. While we agree in principle, we have been on the fence about this for the tutorial.\nWe can't just change the code. We'd have to change the prose at the same time.  We'd be more interested in this PR if you updated with revised guidance.\n. @webtrix My apologies. Upon further review, the original line was always wrong and your fix was correct. Should have been import { Observable } from 'rxjs/Observable';\n@e-hein The import of the map operator shouldn't have been necessary because of the rxjs-extensions.\nHowever, we're not going to promote the rxjs-extensions approach in this tutorial. Revising to oblige you to import what you need for each file.\nSee follow up PR #3075, which closes this one.. @bennadel Ok ... I agree that my previous approach was unintuitive.  So I've completely rewritten it. What do you think now?\nThe config phase, by the way, occurs within the AppModule constructor. Yes ... it's back!\nI wasn't keen on the class for an interceptor. You'll see I went with a registry and now interceptors are just functions. You could make them pure functions if you wished.\nI wasn't keen on the multi-provider idea either because (a) most devs don't know about multi-providers and (b) you can't remove providers. At least with the registration idea there is the potential to unregister them.\n. Angular is adding HTTP interception; no point in this one.. Closing as this PR is unclear, includes 250+ commits, and would affect 1700+ files.\nPlease try again.\n. Thanks but I think that's something that will confuse many and people in the know can figure that out. Judgment call to be sure but I'm making it and closing.\n. @chalin  Good suggestions! Will do\n. Sorry but we will not accept this. It adds a burdensome new file without compensating significant value. You saw (and deleted) the comment in the text that tells you to delete the <h1>. Neglecting to do so caused no serious harm. We do appreciate your close reading of the Tour and your readiness to help.\n. @johnpapa I didn't want to get into this depth in our Angular docs. But I took a crack at it in an update on the security page\n. @mprobst I wasn't sure about AoT's ability to instantiate with string literals. Not sure what the rules are. Good to know. Thanks. And thanks for your other comments which I will incorporate. \n. @mprobst @johnpapa Changes have  been made and force-pushed to this branch. I'll merge in a day or two if you have no more objections.\n. Thanks @mprobst @johnpapa. If you have more changes, time for a new PR \n. I meant \"nestled\" but I have to agree, in hindsight, that my verb choice was a bit to intimate :)  Accepting your PR\n. Closed by #2668\n. Thanks Deb!\n. You cannot use inject instead of async ... they have different purposes. There is no relationship between the two and therefore nothing to document on that score. What led you to believe they are related?  The inject function is always synchronous, btw.\nThe doc does explain the use of inject (always from the root injector) vs. debugElement.injector.get which gets the service from the injector (at whatever level) of the particular debugElement instance. It also explains WHY you would chose one vs. the other.\nI'm not sure how to improve upon that. Your issue isn't helping us do so. Perhaps you can clarify?\n. As one S.O. respondent noted, the difference is explained in the docs (my emphasis added):\n\nAs we learned about guarding routes with CanActivate, we can also protect child routes with the CanActivateChild guard. The CanActivateChildguard works similarly to the CanActivate guard, but the difference is its run before each child route is activated. We protected our admin feature module from unauthorized access, but we could also protect child routes within our feature module.\n\nThe issue becomes apparent when you consider navigating from child-to-child (see respondent's example).  The CanActivate on the parent component presumably allowed navigation to the first child. \nThe parent's CanActivate is not called again as long as sibling children only navigate among themselves. That could be a problem. Maybe the proper guard logic involves knowledge that is specific to each child. It may be legit to navigate to one of them but not all of them. \nBecause the parent's CanActivateChild will be called before inter-sibling navigations, you can implement that child-specific guard language.\nI'm not sure if this clarification is needed in the docs. @brandonroberts ?\n. I've had to fix a few things that were either wrong in the original or got lost in translation. For example, the first code snippet extracts the entire value of the input box from the $event, not the individual keystrokes!\nEliminated the pointless examples of the wrong way to use the template reference variable. Looks like @naomiblack has you covered on this. Let me know when/if it's appropriate for me to review.\n. I agree with this approach. I creatd and merged companion PR #270 in angular/quickstart\n. I just now tried in IE 11 (same build) on Windows 10 Pro 64bit ... and no problem. Sounds like a flake (not you, the experience you had) to me. I'm going to have to close this issue. \n. We're going a different path.\n. Excellent. Will merge right after #2718 with Igor's suggestion. Want to make sure no merge conflicts.\n. Resolved merge conflicts (all in toh-pt5.jade) since the last review. Merging as soon as it clears Travis\n. Thanks, @chalin. Merging. You'll come back latter with the Dart fixes and remove the entry from bad-code-excerpt-skip-patterns.txt.\n. I squashed the original 3 commits and added a 4th with my touches.\nI researched and improved the links to CLDR and ICU. Replaced alt (which doesn't work) with title (which does).\n@vicb should give it a quick look before we merge.\nI'm concerned that a few things do NOT work as advertised:\n\n\nI couldn't get any of the spelled out plural categories to work (zero, one, two). Fortunately, \"other\" works.\n\n\nThe elements that aren't supposed to show (<ng-container> and the i18n in a comment) DO show\n\n\nI don't know if these are bugs in i18n or in our effort to document it. Either way, I'd like to know before I approve for merge into master.. @vicb Looks like with my last updates all pending concerns have been addressed. Ready to merge.. Cool. That didn't exist when the chapter was first written. But you missed a few :-)  Got 'em all in #2742.  Thanks!\n. @chalin Sure.. Maybe later. I'm in the midst of a total reboot of the Quickstart. To see where I'm going, look at this plunker.\nFirst pass will be TS only after which I strongly suspect you'll want to follow suit in Dart. I need to focus on that right now. This is the last step before I create a PR that requires widespread blessing.\n. Thanks @foxandxss. Will fix typos. I feel QuickStart is appropriately brief but let's find out what others think\n. Substantially revised to reflect @IgorMinar feedback. Thanks, Igor.\n. I want to accept this PR but you must sign the CLA. I'll wait a while until you do.\n. Thanks!  See #2798\n. Why haven't we merged this yet? I don't know enough about it to do it (except to blindly click the button)\n. Merged on Pete's request to me in Slack on Dec 14. It's an interesting example but I fail to see what this has to do with Lifecycle Hooks which is the focus of this guide. Unless you make a compelling argument very soon, I will be obliged to close.. As you pointed out, there is no place where we talk about content projection. We haven't documented that yet and don't have it scheduled as yet. When we do write it, we will talk about this of course.\nI'm sorry but I'm going to have to close this PR as it can't possibly go here.. Get it from the Quickstart Seed repository which we keep in sync with the documentation.. See my comment on your angular/angular#13108 in which I investigated and determined that the problem is your compilation with a pre-release version of TypeScript.\nI think that version of TypeScript has a bug and I should not compensate by dirtying the documentation with what is actually a misleading solution even if that solution is an effective workaround.\nLet's also admit that this is a corner case.. While it should be 'api/', in practice it doesn't matter because the in-memory-web-api actually doesn't care. Maybe it should, but it doesn't.  Of course it would matter talking to a real web api where the base address would be 'api/',  \nYou're right also that we didn't show handleError.\nBoth problems fixed by PR #2899\n. Sorry for the long delay in response.  Of course you are correct. We are rewriting the section that includes this passage so we will incorporate your finding in a different way.  Thanks for pointing it out!. Closed by PR #3110. That's a bad rule. There is absolutely nothing wrong with renaming a property. Could someone do that for no good reason? Of course. But you can't legislate against stupidity. And you can't automate against it.\nI will lobby hard to have it reversed.. See the \"Setup Anatomy\" guide. Merging because was committed in Angular by https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/2d6a003dba165436d8e09a2eca3e01d5a545d4e3 on Nov 29. Oops. Prematurely merged. Must wait for next Angular release. Please reapply at the appropriate time via PR #2926. OK.  Coming in PR #2740. That answer didn't make sense to me. I still don't know why this is so. It has nothing to do with testing, btw. You get the same effect in a production app.\nI filed as a bug a long time ago. Still unresolved. See https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/10788. Working on an Angular 2 version. Stay tuned.. Thanks. I took care of the testing and amended your commit.. Superseded.. Thanks for the effort!  Unfortunately, I must close because translation efforts need to be coordinated with Angular management. Please contact @juleskremer if you'd like to follow up.. The in-memory-web-api adds a default delay of 500ms to simulate latency. This is documented in the readme. I was touching up the examples and prose when I discovered that this depends upon an Angular 4.x feature. We do not have a way to handle those as I write. We'll figure it out.\nMeanwhile, I've incorporated your head start in PR #3074 which closes this one.\nThanks!. No. That idea was floating about for a while but is officially dead. Don't do it.. Thanks for finding this. I decided that the entire passage needed improvement so PR #2962 supplants yours. You deserve the credit in my book :-). Oops. Shouldn't have Kapunahele's Reactive Forms changes. Good catch!. Sorry but your question isn't a docs issue. Best to ask this in a place like StackOverflow.. This sounds like an angular request not an angular docs request. Closing. What is \"wrong now\"? Where is the contradiction?\n13490 comment says:\n\nYou can use <template [ngIf]=\"expression\"><li>....</li></template>. Closing as already supported.\n\nStructural Directives mentions: \nts\n<template [ngIf]=\"condition\">\n  <p>\n    Our heroes are true!\n  </p>\n</template>\nClosing as not-actionable. Happy to re-open once you clarify and show us what's wrong.. I understand your frustration in not finding an answer to your specific test case. But please be mindful of the code of conduct for this site. It asks you to avoid making sweeping negative generalizations of this kind.\nWhat do you mean by \"end to end functionality of a component\"?\nWould you please enumerate \"the huge gaps\" so we can consider addressing them.\nTBH,  the  viewContainerRef is an advanced feature rarely found among Angular apps and, in our opinion, does not represent a \"huge gap\" in testing documentation.\nIf you submit an issue that provides a specific, trimmed down testing challenge, focused on a feature, I'd be happy to consider it.\nI am closing this issue because of its tone and its lack of specificity.\n. JavaScript is supported and the docs say so.\nHave you looked at the \"TypeScript to JavaScript' cookbook? It explains in great detail how to translate between Angular-in-TS and Angular in several dialects of JS.\nWhat you won't find is translations of every TS doc into their JS equivalents.  That is big job and the appropriate resources are very busy adding/fixing TS documentation.\nSo I'm curious ... in what ways is that cookbook inadequate? If that cookbook was all you had, would you still say that Angular doesn't support JS? Why?. Please highlight inconsistencies and call out any trick in TS that you don't know how to perform with reasonable grace in JS.. lgtm from TS perspective. Merge away!. This doesn't help me. You don't have an elementRef anywhere in this example and you aren't saying where the you're getting the nativeElement of undefined error.\nIf you want help, please provide a real reproduction, preferably in plunker, and it absolutely must be small and focused. You have far more going on above than is necessary to make your point.. Please explain how your case differs from the example of testing the HighlightDirective in the Testing Guide.\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular.io/blob/master/public/docs/_examples/testing/ts/app/shared/highlight.directive.spec.ts\nThat has no trouble getting to the native element.\nAs you can see from that spec, you first create a test component and then attach the directive-of-interest to it. Then create the test component with the TestBed and probe.\nIf I was interested in the effect of the directive on a real application component, I'd substitute that for the  test component.\nWhat am I missing?. You realize that you did not include in your complaint the code that shows exactly how you dynamically replace the component (the \"component\", not the \"template\", right?).  That's a critical bit of information to have withheld. Even now I have to guess at what you are doing.\nTo be frank, this is an advanced use case that only a relatively small number of people will need.\nThat's why I find the title you gave this issue \u2014 \"No way found to test the end to end functionality of a Component\" \u2014 particularly irksome. That is simply not true ... as the Testing Guide clearly shows. I will give you the chance to re-title the issue. If you are unable to do so, I will do it for you.\nWhen you show me your code for dynamically loading a component AND I have a spare moment, I'll look into your use case because it interests me. However, it is not something that we feel deserves high priority and it may not make the Testing Guide at all.. I have no trouble at all getting an instance of the viewContainerRef from within a test.\nFor example, in the testing sample inside bag.ts I modified the ParentComponent to inject its ViewContainerRef and make it a public property\n@Component({\n  selector: 'parent-comp',\n  template: `Parent(<child-1></child-1>)`\n})\nexport class ParentComponent {\n  constructor(public viewContainerRef: ViewContainerRef) {\n    const el = viewContainerRef.element.nativeElement as HTMLElement;\n  }\n}\nI modified bag.spec.ts to inspect it.\nbeforeEach( async(() => {\n    TestBed.configureTestingModule({\n      declarations: [ParentComponent, FakeChildComponent]\n    })\n    .compileComponents();\n  }));\n ...\n  it('ParentComp should have viewContainerRef', () => {\n    const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(ParentComponent);\n    fixture.detectChanges();\n    expect(fixture.componentInstance.viewContainerRef).toBeTruthy();\n  });\nThe test passes.\nYou're doing something wrong. It does not seem to be Angular's fault nor a lack of documentation that stands between you and success. I suggest you simplify and work up from working tests until you discover your error.\nThis is a place for documentation issues. It is not the right forum for debugging your tests. StackOverflow might be better. \nAs I said earlier, yous is not a mainstream testing scenario that I feel merits documentation at this time. So I'm closing this comment.\n. Thanks ... but we are about to replace all of the JS docs and this error will be rendered moot.. The statements you cite are still correct.  I'm not sure how you derive any conclusions about subscribing/unsubscribing other Observables from those statements.\nYou do subscribe to other Observables such as the ActivatedRoute and the returned values from Http. These particular observables are designed so you do not have to unsubscribe from them.\nThe ActivatedRoute evolved such that it unsubscribes all of its subscribers when the component is destroyed so you don't have to do it. That was not always the case ... as you recall in your issue.\nYou can always play it safe and unsubscribe ... and that may be a best practice; the jury is still out on that. \nWe have a guide coming soon that talks about RxJS in Angular and recommends sound patterns for these things.\nThanks for  your thoughts. I'm closing because I don't think there is any action that needs to be taken ...that we aren't already taking elsewhere.. I see your point. Not having to unsubscribe was a virtue of snapshot. Now it isn't. Not having to subscribe remains a snapshot virtue. I'll update prose accordingly.. We have a guide on RxJS in Angular underway with some good guidance there (I believe)\nStay tuned.. Yes it will. This doc has been rewritten so your fixes, worthy as they are, are gone.. @DzmitryShylovich What value do you see in the meta service described in #3005. I mean that as a sincere and open question. Will help me understand our documentation needs.. Thank you. The CI failures seem unrelated. I'm merging.. We are covering RxJS usage in a forthcoming guide where this topic will be discussed.. This is not an angular.io issue. You might try your luck with an angular issue. Thanks!. I will resolve the conflicts and give quick review.. Moved to a new PR #3077 under IdeaBlade repo (that's where we authors do our work so everyone can share and commit to the same PR).\n3077 closes this PR. Please continue work and reviews there.. The PR#3060 incorporates this advice and much else. Thanks, but closing as a duplicate.\np.s.:  Perhaps you were the reason we added that advice. Don't remember. Thanks anyway.. Yes, you're right. The button would be effective and have a reason for being if blur didn't clear the input value.\nYou're the first to have noticed this. Despite it's actually irrelevance, because this guide is about varieties of event binding, I'm inclined to keep the button for pedagogical reasons.\nDo you see my point? Thanks.. No ... you can work around it (see https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/ts-to-js.html), pretty easily if you're willing to use ES6-with-decorators . \nBut we recommend upgrading to TypeScript as you go if you think you'll get there eventually. \nOh ... you won't be able to use AOT until you're in TypeScript. That's the current state of AOT and likely to remain so for a considerable time.\nOh ... we don't test the thesis that upgrade works without TypeScript. It seems like it should (as I said). But we don't have the resources to verify at the moment.. Thanks. I felt the need to further refine your observation in PR #3056. Closing this PR in favor of that one. But do much appreciate your contribution.. I agree that \"when rendering the data value as a string\" is more precise.  See PR #3041. I very much like the tone, direction, and brevity of this cookbook!\nI'll put copy edits elsewhere. Here are some stream-of-consciousness questions.\n\nI ask a lot of \"why\" questions below. I'm not suggesting that we burden this page with a lengthy discourse about the \"why\" of everything. But we should know \"why\" ... and may want to condense the \"why\" into a sentence here and there.\n\n\nI think we need a different title as \"Production deploy\" is a slang noun. Suggestions welcome. So far the best I have is \"Deploy to production\".\n\n\nFS: Going-to-production Cookbook was actually the original name in our planning but I didn't see that \nuntil you mentioned the name. @DeborahK and @johnpapa might have suggestions.\n\n\nI'm not sure that this is a cookbook. There is a lot of high level advice but relatively little in the way of instructions for what to do after you've done the \"simplest deployment possible\". The notable exception is that highly detailed \"Server configuration\" section.\n\nCan we be more specific about how to do some/all of the tricks in your list? If we shouldn't be more specific here, where should people go to learn more?\n\nFS: most of the optimizations related to build size itself are addressed in the Ahead-of-Time Compilation cookbook (I link to it in the appropriate bit), so I did not want to duplicate the scripts/commands to do that. I would like to review that one in the near future, though. \nI think we will need to provide a simple way to do all of that in the quickstart repo, and also to apply it to our tooling so that we auto-run AoT in our e2e suite. That's actually how I started this chapter but then though it better to separate the two tasks.\nRegarding the cookbook classification, we might need another section for these more general chapters. Perhaps \"Tooling and Setup\". The Setup Anatomy, TypeScript Configuration and Webpack chapters currently in advanced would also belong there.\n\n\nWe should separate \"optimization\" from \"deployment\". You do that yourself by offering a path that pushes the dev environment to the web: \"Simplest deploy possible\" ... love that title.\n\n\nFS: They are conceptually different but in practice I don't think anyone cares for one without the other, except for internal demos. Maybe reordering the sections is enough to make the distinction. \n\n\nI think we should be more clear about what we're optimizing for.  Is it faster launch time? That seems to be what you're after. So what is the metric there? I've seen discussions that call out the time from click-to-app-usability. Maybe we should reference those?\n\n\nFS: I elaborate a bit on how each optimization does different things after I present them. Perhaps it should be the other way around, presenting some axis on which to determine performance and how to navigate them.\n\n\nLet's make a strong case for a published dev build; as @DeborahK as observed, that's often a crucial step in winning (and retaining) managment/stakeholder support.\n\n\nFS: That is a useful tool in a dev's toolbox. I have used it myself several times.\n\n\nIn several places you say \"optimize for loading speed and payload size\".  Is payload size a goal on its own? You suggest it makes a difference in transfer time and startup time. In what environments is that true? I haven't seen numbers that support this claim for desktop or mobile apps over 4G networks. I'm a skeptic.\n\n\nFS: I haven't the numbers, but AFAIK it is especially relevant in emergent markets where smartphones are the primary web device and connection is very poor. That one was of the reasons for the big AoT push.\n\n\nIn any case, I think of a smaller payload as just one factor that contributes to faster loading.   It's significance in that respect depends a great deal on the target environment, yes? In my (limited) experience, the far bigger factor, both in desktop and over mobile, is the number of trips to the server.  \n\n\nFS: I also put more stock in round trip number but both matter. Bundling (the solution to round trip numbers) is also somewhat shallow (you... bundle and that's it) so I don't feel there is as much to list there.\n\n\nIn several places, you conflate reduced payload size and number of files. They are separate issues and may be seen as inversely related: bundling, for example, reduces the number of files while increasing the payload size for each request. \n\nWhich is more important? When? \nIn my (limited) experience, the number of files matters a lot whereas (total net) payload size makes comparatively little difference in app launch and startup time ... at least for enterprise apps. Is that your experience?\nThere may be good reasons to do both. My point is that a few optimizations (bundling and inlining?) may be more significant than the others combined in improving perceived app launch time. Bundling may be much easier to achieve than some or all of the extraordinary efforts to reduce total payload size.\n\nFS: My experience is also that bundling/inlining is the biggest gain. I don't think it would would be significantly easier to do just one though. Most toolchains do all of them with a few lines. Setup is the hardest bit.\n\n\nI confess to wondering about the nearly maniacal effort of the Angular team to shrink the payload. Where are the metrics for the benefit of that? @johnpapa may be able to weigh in from his corporate experience.\n\n\nFS: I don't have these metrics myself but they would be a compelling reference in this chapter.\n\n\nYou wrote:\n\n\nFor one, it has a lot of files that aren't even used when serving your site to users since it has all the development only packages. \n\nWhy should I care? What is the cost of having extra files on the server now that storage is almost free? \n\nFS: Deborah's experience was that in some hosting solutions it is very relevant due to storage caps. The quickstart setup by itself is 100mb for instance. Bigger setups might take a while to upload/deploy as well, once you consider upload speed.\n\n\nI thought Tree Shaking was a technique for Dead Code Elimination. You list these as separate items. Why?\n\n\nFS: They are slightly different. I also assumed they were the same before, but then read up a bit and there are technical differences: https://medium.com/@Rich_Harris/tree-shaking-versus-dead-code-elimination-d3765df85c80#.9wsa1wxwl\n\n\nWhy is the following statement under the \"Template compilation\" heading?\n\n\nAnother great choice is Webpack 2 together with the Angular Ahead-of-Time Webpack Plugin.\n\nPerhaps you should say what it is.\n\nFS: I should elaborate on that, yes. \n\n\nMany people wonder if using SystemJS is \"wrong\" or means that you can't optimize for production. I don't think that is true, even if we are leaning to Webpack ourselves. What can we say to help people not worry about their use of SystemJS? Or should they worry?\n\n\nFS: it's not true, no, but our setups don't help with that perception. We say that the quickstart is not meant for production, our AoT cookbook eschews it for the production builds, and Webpack doesn't use it either. As it stands we use SystemJS at dev time and that's it. We should address SystemJS and it's worth in the same way we do Webpack via a cookbook.\n\n\nWhat would be the perf benefit of switching to umd scripts for Angular and other 3rd party libraries. Aren't these a good choice if you can't go the webpack way? That's what we do for plunkers. Or is this thought just a distraction?\n\n\nFS: There is a big benefit at development time due to loading a single file instead of hundreds of modules. It's irrelevant for production because the build pipeline will optimize and bundle anyway. Switching back and forth requires specialized configuration for SystemJS that we do not address though.\n\n\nThe base tag section raises a concern but doesn't say how to ameliorate it.  There is a line of index.html code that works everywhere  I think: in local development and on any server. It's the one we use in generated plunkers:\n  <script>document.write('<base href=\"' + document.location + '\" />');</script>\n  If that's true, should we recommend it?\n\n\nFS: I actually have not looked into it in detail. I don't know what it's pitfalls are, if any. Can you consult with the Angular team about it? If it's a catch-all then we should always recommend it.\nWB: It doesn't work, not that way. There may be some value in the APP_BASE_HREF but it requires more research. Stepped away from it.\n\n\nRe: enableProdMode - why do you recommend setting that in main.ts. That defeats its purpose during development. Shouldn't it be inside a conditional that enables production mode in production builds?\n\n\nFS: It needs to be set in main.ts, but only for the production build. To be honest I have a lot of reservations about how enableProdMode works. I don't have a good pattern to enable it without acrobatics that are highly dependent on the build system. \nWB: I added what I think is an ok pattern.\n\n\nThe Lazy Loading section is a great start. I don't think we're as clear as we could/should be on how to recognize and overcome the mistake:\n\n\nA common mistake to make while lazy loading a module is to also have that module imported via an ES import. If you do that, the module will never really be lazy loaded since the import statement will cause it to be imported directly instead of being imported via the Router.\n\nThat's something we can look at in copy editing.\n\nFS: we need tooling for this. That is why the AoT Webpack Plugin exists, but that only works for Webpack. I didn't want to elaborate because similar tooling for SystemJS or Rollup does not exist and we need to produce it if we want lazy-loading to actually be used in those setups. \n\n\nYou made several references to the Angular Ahead-of-Time Webpack Plugin.  You don't say how I can use that independent of the CLI. Can I?\n\n\nFS: Yes, it's a separate plugin that can be used in webpack in general. That page serves as documentation for it.\n\n\nThe Server Configuration section is excellent and unusually detailed compared to anything else on this page.  I like that. But it feels a bit strange to be reading high-level advice and suddenly diving into details.\n\n\nFS: That was a side-effect of my writing process actually. I did it all in one sitting almost, and the longer I was writing the more in the zone I got. Another factor was that a lot of the implementation of the optimization section is actually in the AoT cookbook.\n\n\nThanks for the CORS section!\n\n\nFS: I wasn't going to put it in but Deborah reminded me of it. I figured a few lines would save a lot of headaches.\n\n. Well I know the difference between a cookbook and guide :-)\nFor sure a cookbook contains detailed instructions you can follow. For sure it contains sample code. This PR offers neither.\n\nI'm not judging. This is all I had reason to expect from the author, given the constraints I set for him. But I am stating facts.\n\nImagine a cookbook recipe called \"Boil an egg\" that talked about how chickens come from eggs (it might or might not mention that eggs come from chickens), and the relative merits of cooking in hot water versus steam, and how most people used gas stoves ... but never told you what to do.  That is a guide at best, not a cookbook recipe at all.\nAt some point we have to go beyond musing about the factors and give people some real instructions. That isn't happening here to my satisfaction. There is one place that comes close to giving actual instruction for deploying to a server - the \"Simplest possible deploy\" - and even that omits crucial details or an example for even one server.\nThere is no accompanying code, nothing you can run, nothing you can see that looks like a production app.\n\nI must repeat ... I'm not condemning the author. I asked for this and I got it.\n\nHaving said that, so pressing is the need for something that I agree to completing the review and copy-editing this week ... as a preliminary guide.  Hold me to it!\n. @robwormald Thanks for the perf feedback and for demonstrating these points to me personally (Stephen did so too). I understand much better. I think we're silent on which factors are \"more important\" ... and silence is golden.\nThanks for your help!. I do too. Merging.. Please try StackOverflow. This is for documentation issues only.. Where is the demo incorrect? I see the following textbox in the demo\n<input *ngSwitchCase=\"'textbox'\" [formControlName]=\"question.key\"\n            [id]=\"question.key\" [type]=\"question.type\">\nIt clearly does work, as we see in this excerpt from Chrome showing the case of an email textbox:\n<input ng-reflect-name=\"emailAddress\" \n    ng-reflect-id=\"emailAddress\" \n    id=\"emailAddress\" \n    ng-reflect-type=\"email\" \n    type=\"email\" \n    class=\"ng-untouched ng-pristine ng-valid\">\nHad there been a problem with input.type binding it would not have been an illustration of issue #11716 anyway which, it seems, is limited to a binding problem with an attribute binding in the manner of [attr.xxx]=\"...\".  There is such a binding in the cookbook example: <label [attr.for]=\"question.key\">.  It works in Chrome (and elsewhere AFAIK):\n<label for=\"emailAddress\">Email</label>\nI'm closing this as invalid until you show where precisely the cookbook is incorrect.\nHappy to reopen when you have proof.. Huh?\nIn #13243 didn't change the value of inputType. Why would you expect the <input type> to change because the type of the value changed? In any event, that has nothing to do with this guide.\n12585 and #7329 are irrelevant as they are not use cases in this guide.\nThis guide does not depend on dynamically changing the input type.  It only requires that the type be set once.  You cannot fault the guide for something it doesn't attempt.\n. It can't be type=\"number\" because that isn't a binding and the type is determined by the question metadata in this guide example.\nYou have yet to show that the Dynamic Forms guide behaved other than exactly as expected and described.  I'm not sure where you're seeing these accessors.   If there's a bug, lets fix the bug; the guide is correct as written.  It may be a somewhat anemic example of dynamism but it does what it says it does.. @GuyShaanan  I did what you said and it worked just fine in Chrome and Edge\nnew TextboxQuestion({\n        key: 'age',\n        label: 'Age',\n        value: 21, // <-- also OK with \"21\" or if no `value` property\n        type: 'number',\n        order: 4\n      })\nInspecting the HTML in Chrome:\n<input ng-reflect-name=\"age\" ng-reflect-id=\"age\" id=\"age\" ng-reflect-type=\"number\" \n    type=\"number\" \n    class=\"ng-pristine ng-valid ng-touched\">\n\nWhy do you think we're getting different results?. @DzmitryShylovich - confirmed ... and that's not good. Not sure why that is happening (I take it you are sure), and it would be something (I call it a bug) that the dev would have to work around. \nThat said, the <input type> remains 'number'  ... as it should be.  I thought your claim was that the type binding wouldn't work.\n\nI'm not sure we can call it a bug. It never worked like expected. I would say it's a feature request\n\nWe'll never know if they think its a bug and unless we file it as one. \nNone of this means the cookbook is wrong ... or should be removed. It does mean that we should warn the reader that s/he must guard the type of the changed value coming from the form and ensure that the proper value goes back into the data object.\nI've encountered this problem many times before (sadly) and it always seems to fall on the developer to cope with string values coming out of the UI.. Thank you.  Timing is uncertain. I may be able to whisper something in someone's ear.\nPlease reference our discussion in your PR. It may help.. This is great. But I need to copy edit a few of the copy edits and this branch isn't in the IdeaBlade repo (ahem!).\nTherefore, I had to close and move it to a new PR #3060. Pretty messed up, mainly because it refers to the wrong episode of the tutorial: should have been based on the \"Services\": https://angular.io/resources/live-examples/toh-4/ts/eplnkr.html\nWhile this isn't supposed to be a word-for-word tutorial, we agree that we should be much more on target.\nWill correct in forthcoming PR.. Yes, I know there is no routing in \"Services\".  I wanted to grab code for the routing guide before the Tour of Heroes tackles routing. This is, after all, a separate guide to routing. That is why I believe the source should be copied from \"Services\", not \"Routing\".\nMoreover, the code for the heroes feature is much simpler in \"Services\" than in \"Routing\". For example, there are no separate HTML and CSS files to worry about.\nI don't see what you mean about \"outdated\". We're just trying to grab some code for the heroes here ... enough to keep the routing discussion moving forward and without rewriting a bunch of code that doesn't illuminate routing. I fail to grasp your objection.\nClosed this issue so I wouldn't forget to get it later. Sorry, that is premature of me. I'm working on it today. All will become clear soon I hope.\n. Not your problem. In fact, you lead me to some things that needed improvement. Thanks.\nThe update is in PR #3060 . Nope. Both work.  The resolve method accepts either a value or a promise of a value such as that returned by this.getHeroes(). The latter is better because it abstracts the process of hero getting and simply adds the delay ... as it says it will.. That's because the class is not called doc-page after Angular gets done mangling it to be local to the template. \nThe best way to see what I mean is to add the doc-page class to your ViewPort component and inspect the DOM in the browser. You'll seen that Angular generates a special name.  I can't remember if the name is predictable enough for you to use inside your injected <div>.\nThe real problem is that you're creating elements in the DOM by hand inside your component. There is no way for Angular to know that you are doing this. Nor is that the \"Angular\" way to add dynamic content (a subject too big for this answer).\nI am closing because this issue is unrelated to any of the documentation currently published.. There are 2 schools of thought about \"a\" vs. \"an\" before a word beginning with a vowel. I accept your school.. The CI sample tests had failures but for reasons that can't possibly relate to this PR. Merging anyway. . No. This is incorrect in two respects:\n1) That's now how you unsubscribe from an observable\n1) there is no need to unsubscribe from an http observable.\nWe will discuss when and how to manage Observable subscriptions in our forthcoming RxJS guide.. @naomiblack I think this is for you to merge, yes?. Thank you!\nI dug into Style Guide which was hiding the moduleId=module.id in many examples for some reason ... and thus sending the wrong message!\nFixed that. Started adding/correcting advice, and soon had a lot of Style Guide \"improvements\".\nI'll merge these with yours ... they overlap so much ... but keep the commits separate.. Do you really think someone is going to treat this as a recommended practice. The point is to show how the NgClass works syntactically.\nI'd happily look at a PR. I'm worried that, in making it \"correct\", we'll lose sight of the point.  If you can keep it simple, I'm interested.. Ya all nailed me for being a grumpy old man. I'll get out a PR.  Thanks for making the case.. Fixing in PR #3076. Merging this incomplete PR because we need the code-snippets changes in ToH 1 & 2 to land for aio.\n@kapunahelewong will begin a new PR that picks up from the unfinished work here.. Merging this incomplete PR because we need the code-snippets changes in ToH 1 & 2 to land for aio.\n@kapunahelewong will begin a new PR that picks up from the unfinished work here.. Closed after cherry picking 6cc22fa4452fef0ae4294cf0ae88976a772f6409 into PR #3077 . >have changed drastically between builds\nReally? There have been no breaking changes since the release of 2.0.  What build are you talking about.\nIn any event, we have no intention of providing documentation for any pre-release build. Sorry. Must close.. I don't think you'll convince us but, as your suggestion is about Angular, not the Angular docs, you must post it as an issue on the angular website.. OH MY!  You are absolutely right. Thanks for catching that. Fixing. See PR #3091 \nI ended up removing the example which wasn't particularly helpful anyway.. @mattdistefano is correct. I'd have answered anyway if the answer was immediately obvious but there isn't enough context for that. So, with sadness, I'm closing and urging you to take your case to S.O.. I disagree. I personally revised this rule in order to satisfy #2896 while keeping its original intent which was to discourage spurious aliasing. \nHere's what it says that specifically honors #2896:\n\nYou should use an alias when the directive name is also an input property, and the directive name doesn't describe the property.\n\nInstead, you just removed it all together. Please explain.. I think we agreed to close this PR. lgtm. The question was answered (Paul Taylor) and the observer is preferred.. We probably should be referring to the Microsoft web site, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48593, rather than a specific download.\nMy current worry, however, is that the specific download you have selected is for TS 2.1 and, AFAIK, Angular apps can't use that version of TS yet.  Checking on that now. Then will take appropriate action\nThanks for raising the issue.. I found one grammar mistake. As I fixed it, I decided to convert to the Google doc guidelines (a lot of \"we\" to \"you\"). I touched up a few things while at it. All of my changes are in a separate commit for comparison.\nWould you mind giving a swift read to make sure it's still good. Then we can merge (feel free to merge it yourself as I am done with my review).. I don't recall that style-guide says anything about how to choose input or output property names. There is nothing in those two links about it.\nI suppose it is worth mentioning that one should use property names that do not collide with either a native property/event name or a property/event name used by any other component or directive (same reason). TBH, there are many ways to shoot yourself in the foot and if we tried to cover them all, we'd have a ridiculously, unreadable guide.  TBH again, this particular issue has not come up often. Calling an event change is kind of asking for trouble.  So I'm not feeling great urgency on this one. \nI'll ask my  colleagues for their opinion.\nI'm reluctant to go beyond the advice to avoid collisions. We should take no position on prefixes. In particular, the on prefix is a personal decision; as noted, many developers like that for the handler, not the event.  So I think we should stay away from any naming recommendation.. Can you identify a guide or cookbook that lacks a plunker? I think almost all of them do.. I feel your pain. We are about to scrub the tutorial and rewrite parts of it that will affect this section. I believe in our rework we will be much more careful to show the steps we talk about (such as imports ... a problem for some here and elsewhere) while removing some of the other repetitive stuff. For that reason only, I'm closing this PR.  Please bear with us while we are in transition.. Closing, at @juleskremer request, because we aren't developing the current angular.io in this repo.. The design of the new aio pages is complete, rendering this PR moot.. Closed by https://github.com/angular/angular.io/commit/b2f41484721265026c87fb5c8780a8a4a57d5b61#diff-ea8e16eabf541f0e00287f1ba4bf7a69R79\nI tested these instructions on my MBP.. We'd like to publish information about this too. We regret that we do not have that information at the moment and we do not have a predicted delivery date for it either. \nIt is not correct to say that \"angular moved to webpack\". Angular has no commitment to a particular module loader.  Our examples continue to demonstrate both systemjs and webpack modalities.. I agree that it all needs rethinking. But, for now, let's at least get the direction right. So Thx!. Thanks. Sign the CLA and I'll accept this. If you disappear, I'll have to do under a different PR. Thanks!. I see your point and agree that the text can be improved. However, it is not contradictory and those two sentences are bridged by an explanation that breaks the apparent contradiction ... a bridge that you break when you jam them side-by-side.\nThe mental model: every component has its own injector.  You will always experience it that way. That's what the first sentence means.\nUnder the hood is often a proxy to the actual injector (which has a reference to the real one which may ... and probably is ...shared). There is only a need to create a real injector when you provide a service at that level. Otherwise, Angular proxies up to the root. That's what the second sentence means.\nMaybe we should have said it that way. We probably shouldn't say anything about it because it's an implementation detail that has no consequences for the developer. \nWe will leave this issue open until we correct the prose, one way or the other.\nI'd like to take a moment to speak to you about how you framed your issue. Perhaps you are unaware that it came across as argumentative. The bit about \"any English teacher would fail a student\" is disrespectful and contrary to our Code of Conduct. Please keep the feedback coming but temper your language a bit.  We humans will respond better when you do.. Thanks for the head start. I fear that your proposed language draws us into details that don't matter. As a developer, I should think \"each component has its own injector\". The fact that we use injector proxies wherever we can is an implementation detail that ... I don't think should matter. At most we might have a note along the lines of \"Angular may proxy the injector for efficiency\".\nSo, while we much appreciate your effort ... and I'll hold this PR open until we fix the text ... we're unlikely to accept it as written. . I'd prefer not to do so. That's an implementation detail that doesn't affect developer behavior ... nor should it. If you really really want to know ... read the code.\nHint: if you add a component provider, it's a real injector. Otherwise, it's a proxy. But I don't want to say this because I happen to know that there are more changes coming to the implementation and ... most importantly ... it does not matter.. Looks great. \nOne question before we merge ... do you want to include the Karma Jasmine HTML Reporter for tests? Many of us really like it and it just made it into the CLI.\nThe package.json is\n\"karma-jasmine-html-reporter\": \"^0.2.2\",\nThe changes to karma.conf.js that enable it are visible at https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/%40angular/cli/blueprints/ng2/files/karma.conf.js\nYour call. Feel free to merge now or after adding that.. @petebacondarwin weighed in\n\nHi Mi\u0161ko,\nCan you elaborate on the bugs that you are describing?\nHave you tested that moving it actually fixes these subtle bugs?\nWhat about moving it to the ngDoBootstrap hook?\n\n. I like these changes.. Travis is going bonkers but we know this line is harmless at worst so I'm merging it.. As noted in Slack, I'd like to get this PR in and then let Kapunahele and you work out the TOC question in a followup PR.. This will do for now. I'll be revisiting shortly for v.4 to cope with changes to the microsyntax and the move to <ng-template> whose implications I have not yet thought through.. Why are we backporting images? What do they have that the current images lack? What's up?\nI can't tell what's different between the images nor what this PR is about.\nBlocking while we await answers.\n. I didn't see significant size changes in the handful I checked. A few 100 bytes here and there.  And I didn't have time inspect the images that github wouldn't diff.  \nI'm accepting your word (Patrice and Kevin) that this will all be fine.. Yeoman effort!  Big improvement. I see nits. We'll get 'em next time.. LGTM - except we must remember to fix the animations.jade to go with the changes we made to the animations sample code.. I'm still not sure if we should write \"Ahead-of-Time\" or \"ahead-of-time\". We can revisit later if we come to a different conclusion.. Yes. The URL class is explicitly \"experimental\" and only supported in a handful of browsers. Let's try never to use it again :-)\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL. Igor ok'd. Merging.. Don't worry about travis e2e build failures.  This is an archive ;-). Thanks. Others beat you to the fix.. We have two problems that we'll address quickly:\n1) The docs need to reflect the relatively recent restructuring that introduced the src/ folder\n2) The systemjs-angular-loader.js has a known bug (didn't work in IE, Edge, and some other browsers) that we fixed ... but neglected to deploy to the quickstart repo.\nWe'll fix (2) within hours. (1) should be fixed soon too. Sorry for your pain.\nUpdate 12:30pm March 24\nUpdated quickstart repo. Please get the latest systemjs-angular-loader.js from there.. Hi. Thanks. Yes ... we're close to the update. The move to src/app adds some wrinkles to the instructions but it's not horrible. Stay tuned. We got the update in master. Just has to be published. Look at the PR #3433 if you can't wait.. Thanks!  I have a few more to correct but this gets most of them.. Thanks. I amended with some tiny edits and added a plunker (which meant I could kill the file listing at the end).. Right you are! Thanks.. Thanks. We got that one in a different PR. I am NOT an official spokesperson for the Angular team. But we poked around and our understanding is that the Angular Team has no plans to add direct support for <input type=\"file\">. You're on your own.\nI guess you'll have to omit it from your Reactive Forms control structure and program to the DOM element directly. MDN has a good article about how to do that here.\nI personally am OK with this, although I feel your pain too. The file API is an odd duck. The others take simple data input from the user and store that data within a \"form\" that parallels a data record (e.g., the \"name\" of a person in a \"Person\" record). The file API seems intended for getting files from your local machine and uploading the file data someplace rather than simply adding to the collection of information in a data record.\nI'm not saying you're wrong for wondering at the omission. I am saying that the omission is understandable.\n. I'm closing this issue because there just isn't going to be another answer in the foreseeable future.. I do not understand. The OnSelect method is added to AppComponent. And there is a code snippet immediately after that sentence that illustrates.\nMeanwhile, I have no idea what \"placed in the export statement\" means. There is no such thing as an \"export statement\" (there are two export declaration, neither of them involving this method).\nWe're also about to refresh the tutorial in the next few months.\nFor all of these reasons, with regret I must reject this PR.. Not sure why a space at the end of the line is a problem ... it shouldn't be ... but happy to kiss them goodbye.. Thanks for taking this on. As it happens, we addressed this matter in another PR #3479 . While reviewing I decided to fix two other problems that were outside the scope of your assignment but important for DI\n1) Angular v4 deprecates OpaqueToken in favor of InjectionToken so I swapped the latter in (and don't bother to mention OpaqueToken\n2) The MinimalLogger illustration of class-interface was hard to follow (as you pointed out).  I think I made it more clear.. Thanks. Good catch. Thanks.. While I agree that the current prose is a bit confusing when it says \"don't copy this into your code\" ... you do need to import OnInit from @angular/core, I fear your suggestion will add to the confusion.\nWe do NOT \"extend the Angular core import statement.\" Rather we declare that the AppComponent implements OnInit and implement that interface in the body of AppComponent by adding the ngOnInit() method.\nWe're going to refresh the entire tutorial soon so I think it is best if we just leave this as it is. Thanks for contributing.. We plan to show a cli-based quick start. Thanks for suggesting a way to do so.. Thanks. I disagree that this is repetitive. It links back to the base discussion of DI. The entire DI section is scheduled for refresh anyway. Therefore, I'm closing your PR.. Actually, it should just be (setup.html) rather than (../guide/setup.html).  But I'll take the correction and clean up later. Thanks.. Thanks for this change. But, believe it or not, I intended for the duplication in the one case and not in the other. Because it is intended (which doesn't make it right, just intentional), I'm closing your PR. Thanks again.. I fixed a few things (e.g., (done: any) to (done: DoneFn) and fixed the failing test. Force pushed.. The travis failure concerns TOH-6 which this PR does not touch. Ignored.. Good. But I think we should make clear that we are no longer accepting or evaluating issues and PRs.\nHow about:\nThis angular.io documentation repository is closed\nPlease do not add issues or pull requests to this repo. \nWe are no longer making changes to documentation in this repository.\nWe will no longer process new issues or PRs and we will close them automatically.\nPlease post new issues and pull requests to the content folder in https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/master/aio/content.\nBe sure to prefix your issue/PR title with \"docs(aio):\"\n. True but the other GS changes matter more.  And soon it will be 42 :-).  Please accept this as my next PR builds on it.\n. Ignore QuickStart ... it is dead ... soon to be replaced by Getting Started.\nWe'll remove QS very soon and replace with GS.\nAlex may not know about this plan yet.\n. Will be in next PR\n. Please change \"bew\" to \"new\" while you are here.\n. It is true that one can bootstrap multiple apps. That isn't a typical scenario but it is possible and even useful.\nI'd like to see a chapter on bootstrap that I can refer to rather than complicate things here. Open to alternative language of course!\n. Who knows if there really will be an ES2016. We can update this as it happens.\n. We can update as the term ES6 finally disappears. There are still a great many references to ES6\n. They are directives without the * and may even be applied without the *, albeit in the expanded form with the <template> tag.\nI have played fast and loose with directive names, sometimes using the class name (NgIf) and sometimes the applied form (ng-if). Someone may want to clean this up everywhere when if/when we detect confusion in the ranks.\n. It's writer's choice: singular or plural.  We're allowed to say \"HeroList\" to describe a list of heroes; the \"list\" part conveys the plurality.  \"HeroesList\" is equally correct.  I'm keeping it ;-)\n. I struggled with this.  Of course it isn't an element at all. But I'm targeting the novice and I felt that imprecision was acceptable in the service of learning.\nIt will be interesting to see what others say.\n. Good catch!  Now says \"Angular inserts an instance of the HeroListComponent view between those tags.\"\n. Agree.  \nI deliberately did NOT say \"add decorators ...\". The fact is that we \"must add metadata to our ... code\" no matter what kind of code (DART, JS, TS, ES2015) it is.\n. Good point. Done.\n. Nah!  Trying to cover the mainstream of DI for the novice A2 developer. Your observation would be a good one for the DI chapter itself.\n. I don't know which is best. I've been consistent across all chapters in calling it the \"Developers Guide\" as in \"the guide for developers\".  It's a good question for Naomi.  I'm staying the course for now.\nReminds me that the current title on the sidebar is \"Developers Guides\" which is totally confusing!\n. These form images have always felt to big to me.  After some experimentation, I think 400px works.\nSuggest you do as I am doing and replacing .png\" alt  with .png\" width=\"400px\" alt   or some such thing.\nReview to make sure you like the result and adjust as necessary\n. Good idea adding the file name to the example title bar\nI notice you do this elsewhere when showing a fragment of a file. I find this confusing ... because it isn't the whole file.\nOne way to be clear would be to add the suffix \" (excerpt)\" at the end as in \"web/index.html (excerpt)\"\n. I found it confusing to read this after the sample.  So I revised the TS version to pull this up.  Mine now reads:\n```\n:marked\n  It's an anemic model with few requirements and no behavior. Perfect for our demo.\nThe TypeScript compiler generates a public field for each public constructor parameter and\n  assigns the parameter\u2019s value to that field automatically when we create new heroes.\nThe alterEgo is optional and the constructor lets us omit it; note the (?) in alterEgo?.\nWe can create a new hero like this:\n```\nThen the example follows ... and this sentence is no longer needed.\n. By adding (format=\".\") you eliminated the line numbers ... and also the horizontal scrollbar. The example can't be read when the browser is made narrow (or on mobile).\nIn general, I remove line numbers only for one-liners that are short (and I try to keep my lines short ... not always with success).\n. We're going to have to sweep ALL documents and pull out every place that we add FORM_DIRECTIVES and CORE_DIRECTIVES.  A PITA for us but good for developers.\nI confirmed with alpha46 that the sample still works without these directives or their explicit imports.\n. Better than the original tortured passage. I adopted something like it\n. Great improvement. Took it.\n. You improved this section but I still find it clumsy.\nI updated the TS version to the following (calling them chapters rather than guide as we discussed):\nWe don't see hero data because we are not binding to the `Hero` yet.\n  We know how to do that from earlier chapters.\n  [Displaying Data](./displaying-data.html) taught us Property Binding.\n  [User Input](./user-input.html) showed us how to listen for DOM events with an\n  Event Binding and how to update a component property with the displayed value.\nYour change to \"from the components\" is incorrect. We use the event binding to move values from the HTML controls to the component. I clarified as above.\n. Better. But better still might be:\nThen we can confirm that two-way data binding works *for the entire Hero model*.\n. How did you get such a different image from my TS version? Can you prove that it displays the way you're showing it in DART? It doesn't look like that for me in plunker.\n. Better. I changed the TS version of this segment to:\n:marked\n  If we ran the app right now and changed every Hero model property, the form might display like this:\nfigure.image-display\n  img(src=\"/resources/images/devguide/forms/ng-model-in-action-2.png\" width=\"400px\" alt=\"ng-model in super action\")\n:marked\n  The diagnostic near the top of the form\n  confirms that all of our changes are reflected in the model.\n. Delete this alert. It is no longer meaningful.\n. I like!  Stole it.\n. Better!\n. Missing the word \"about\". Change to we'll talk about it\n. NICE!\n. Better. Better still?\nNow run the app and focus on the *Name* input box.\n  Follow the next four steps *precisely*\n. I am adding an animated gif in my TS PR that may help make this clearer.\nWhen I do, you should be able to use this:\nThe actions and effects are as follows:\nfigure.image-display\n  img(src=\"/resources/images/devguide/forms/control-state-transitions-anim.gif\"  alt=\"Control State Transition\")\n:marked\n  We should be able to see the following four sets of class names and their transitions:\nfigure.image-display\n  img(src=\"/resources/images/devguide/forms/ng-control-class-changes.png\" width=\"400px\" alt=\"Control State Transitions\")\n. The FORM_DIRECTIVES stuff is no longer relevant. \nI suggest that you replaces this sub-section with the following (as I have for TS)\n``\n.l-sub-section\n  :marked\n    ### The NgForm directive\n    Recall from the previous section thatng-controlregistered this input box with theNgForm` directive as \"name\".\nWe didn't add the **[`NgForm`](../api/core/NgForm-class.html) directive** explicitly.\nAngular added it surreptiously, wrapping it around the `<form>` element\n\nThe `NgForm` directive  supplements the `form` element with additional features.\nIt collects `Controls` (elements identified by an `ng-control` directive)\nand monitors their properties including their validity.\nIt has its own `valid` property which is true only if every contained\ncontrol is valid.\n\nIn this example, we are pulling the \"name\" control out of its `controls` collection\nand assigning it to the template local variable so that we can\naccess the control's properties  &mdash; such as the control's own `valid` property.\n\n```\n. I saw that.  I'm worried for you on two counts\n1) Those numbers are killer hard to get right in the first place (what with #docregions) and almost impossible to maintain.\n2) Colored dark red against black. they're barely legible anyway.\nI fear a ton of effort for paltry reward. YMMV. \n. I floated the term \"Component Element\" on slack. I think it is good for noobs and pros.  We'll see if anyone complains.\n. Done\n. Done\n. Maybe ... but I thought it drove the point home. I'm leaving it this way until I hear more complaints ;-)\n. That will take care of itself upon release\n. Done. I put that observation down in the systemjs configuration section.\n. I won't change the image names. Too much trouble for too little gain.\n. I'l bite.  What talk?\n. This paragraph buries the lead. We should delete it.\n. lower case \"from\", etc.\n. Strike the future tense \"will\" in this para (and others).  Present tense is easier to read.  This is as much a note to myself as to you!\n. Ultimately, we'll have to eliminate all fragment files because they are  difficult to test. Notice the use of ng-for which no longer exists? We'd never catch that in fragments if we can't test them.\nI think we can leverage your sample code to make these points  It shouldn't be a problem to refer to <hero-detail> rather than <child-comp>.  \nOtherwise, we have to create real samples with ParentComponent and ChildComponent.  That's possible but we have a lot of code already.\n. What does NgFor have to do with the point the \"bind multiple properties\" point? Or are there two points here ... one about multiple bindings and one about multiple children?  \nIMO, the NgFor clouds the issue. Let's drop it. and stick w/ component communication.\np.s.:  must sweep the jade for all use of defunct kebab-cased directives.\n. elim space before comma\n. Confusing. The reader doesn't know what an output property is yet or how it relates to the child-event property.\nI feel this example is confusing because of the <button> and the unexplained relationship between the raiseMyEvent click handler and the child-event. There is either too much or too little in this example. My feeling is that we should trim it down to just\nparent-comp>\n  <child-comp (child-event)='handleMyEvent($event)'>\n  </child-comp>\n</parent-comp>\nHEADS UP: Must rename all kebab-case sample component input/output properties (child-event) to camelCase (childEvent).\n. Events may have at most one argument. That argument is an event object.\nAfter removing the <button> we should not tell the reader that the event object is the \"Fired!\" string because the reader can't see that.\n. Let's remove this example entirely.\nIf we decide to discuss handing the parent to the child at all, we should do it in an appendix ... and there explain why it's discouraged ... which includes the high danger of violating unidirectional data flow when a child calls anything on a parent ... as you note here.\n. \"The parent and child delegate shared state management to the service and communicate about that state through the service.\"\nA bit abstract. Need to think of a way to make this compelling in a few words.\n. We should discuss and show the NgModel approach:\n<hero-cape-picker [(ngModel)]=\"hero.capeColor\"></hero-cape-picker> \nWhere the picked cape updates the parent property. If the caller needs to react to the change can do with (a) definedProperty and/or (b) OnChange.  Let's chat about that.\n. Again, I'd rather we find a way to leverage the real code rather than mention a CommService.\n. The caveat (\"unless we do not configure\") is a bit confusing and unnecessary. If we have to say anything here ... and I'm not sure that we do say anything here ... it should be something like.\n\"The parent component instance and its children share a single instance of the CommService.\"\nIf that seems too mysterious, they can read about it in the detail.\n. We give no hint why we would want to use a shared service instead of the earlier techniques.  I haven't read ahead yet to see if you talk about this.\nIf not, we need to. When is a shared state service a good idea?  I'm not sure how often it is. I think it is the right choice when \nA)  there is a complex, multi-stage, bi-directional workflow that is best represented by multiple touch points.\nB) when the children should respond to messages or events from the parent.\nC) to avoid complex parent/child protocols that would otherwise flow over a single property channel (corollary to A).\nD) to simplify both child and parent components by delegating complex state and logic to a service (which is typically the reason to have a service in the first place). An example is a service that acquires and manages data from a remote server.\nThese are specialized scenarios. I suspect that the shared service is rarely a first choice.  Particularly when you consider that it adds complexity and ... when the service exposes events to children ... requires careful OnDestroy logic to avoid memory leaks.\nWith this in mind, I'll look forward to seeing what YOU said.\n. \"parent\" not \"perent\".  Rewrite anyway to avoid leading with a preposition. Perhaps simply:\n\"The communicating components aren't always in a parent-child relationship.\"\n. Actually, there are only two choices: \"they can be siblings or they can be in distant branches of the application component hierarchy.\"  All components have a common root ancestor ... unless you're thinking about two separate applications launched from the same index.html ... a scenario I think we can safely ignore.\n. How can these components communicate with each other (not \"others\") directly?  I don't know how. I don't think we show how. AFAIK, they could only communicate through an intermediary such as a \"message bus\".\nThe \"message bus\" is a variation of the service example we showed before. We should be clear about that.\nAlso, I don't think we should limit this to a message writer and a message listener. Component can be both senders and receivers.\n. See my earlier note about this being structurally the same as the service example.\n. The name for this isn't telling the story. \nMore importantly, I think you may have confused two different cases. The example certainly confused me and took several hours to unravel (some of them filled with my own silly mistakes ... and I learned a ton while exploring it so thanks for that).\nIn the content case, you have a directive (such as a TabControl) that does involve transposition.  The telltale sign is that the consumer's content is between the open and the close tags of the parent directive.  Such an example would look for content children ... and yours does ... by using NgFor to repeat the consumers content.\nOn the other hand, if you had simply used NgFor, you could access the child components via the view children.  NgFor uses the <template> tag to stamp out new views that are view children of the parent component, <parent-comp>. That would have been a simpler and more obvious example. \nNotice the difference:  content children vs. view children.  They have different search and access mechanisms.\nThe content case is advanced stuff.  I wonder if we should tackle it.  The view children are not the same as the content children. The view children can be a superset of the content children ... as can be seen in this variation of your plunker.\nContentChildren Sample Concerns\nBefore I forget, I should say that this content children sample is very complex and very unclear. It doesn't seem to me that it actually shows component communication via content children _because you never actually use the content children for communication!_  You're using the HeroPanel in the same way that you did before. You're communicating with the HeroPanel, not with the content children.\nI wonder if people are aware that, as written, the hero children are created before they are even invited!  They're sitting there, in the shadows, waiting to be displayed. \nThat's really tricky, perhaps unexpected, and probably not helpful to the story.\nIt's completely contrary to the backstory you tell:\n\nLet's play with the idea \u2014 and it's seems realistic \u2014 that the list of heroes to invite is managed outside of HeroJobBoard, and even it changes while we use the app. The Hero Job Board application's logic requires that by the time we click the Invite heroes button, we need to know the list of heroes to invite, so that the corresponding HeroPanel components could be nested into HeroJobBoard.\n\nThat's not how it works in your code. The heroes are already in memory ... hidden in shadow DOM ... before the user clicks the button ... as can be seen in the console log of this variation of your plunker.\nWe need to talk about this example.\n. What does \"crm\" stand for?  The CRM system? Very confusing name. You say this is an entity.  Why would a directive represent an entity? An entity is usually part of the application model ... it's not a UI artifact.\nNow sometimes we create a UI wrapper around an entity ... which is widely known as a \"ViewModel\" or an \"ObjectViewModel\".  Is that what you intend? If so, I wouldn't call it an entity.\n. The fact that we use a router shouldn't come up at this level of detail. It's part of the sample harness ... the thing that enables us to jump among the examples within this chapter.\nIt plays no role in the example you're talking about. \n. I actually do understand what you're saying but I don't think the reader will get it. Who is managing externally such that the author of the component can't know the children? That would need explaining.\n. Several mechanisms?  What are they other than the content children example you're about to look at?  Why would I pick this mechanism over the others?\nBtw, the only other mechanism that comes to mind is the shared service mentioned earlier. Why choose this approach over that one?\n. You don't showed the usage of ngAfterContentInit. It appears no where in the sample. We can't talk about it if we don't show it.\n. As I observed above, the sample does not illustrate this case. I don't mean that it should go to a server.  I mean that the list is not determined dynamically and is in fact consumed long before the user pushes the invite button.\n. This is not the way to argue for this approach. Changes to the displayed list are not the driver.\nIf the list changed over time we could handle that entirely with the binding mechanisms shown earlier and with NgFor.   You could have demonstrated that with any of the other samples.\n. We need a different name for this section. This one doesn't speak in plain language that the reader can understand.\nI think you may have confused \"transposition\" with \"transclusion\".  \n\"Transposition\" involves an exchange of positions as when we move a term in an equation from one side of the (=) to the other or when we exchange the first letter of a word with the last.\n\"Transclusion\" involves moving content from one place to another. There is no exchange. Nothing from the target goes back to the source.\n. This may be part of the problem with this sample.\nIt doesn't demonstrate that the getting the children has anything at all to do with component communication.  You've shown how to get the children. But you're not using the children in a way that demonstrates how they offer a communication mechanism that's different than anything else you've shown.\nYou're using the same old binding techniques to the HeroPanel. The only difference is that you've found a complex and improbably way to get the heroes via shadow DOM.\n. \"which\"\n. The point you're making about different content children with different types won't be understood by the reader, mostly because we don't show it. I almost didn't get it myself.\nNo point in talking about something we don't show. FWIW, I don't think this is the place to show or talk about it.\n. Too bad we're not making use of that. \n. The component children case should be in a new paragraph as it has nothing to do with \"intermediary components\"\n.  @ContentChildren doesn't help us \"transpose\" children.  We aren't \"transposing\" children in any case.\nWe are \"projecting\" the external content (says the Angular team) that the consumer put between tags.\n. I don't think that we are clear enough about what this sample is for.\nWe should say that we're implementing the same example 6 different ways, each way illustrating one of the aforementioned techniques.\n\nOr at least we try to. The first and second techniques alone can't cover all of the requirements.  That in itself is an important point.\n\nThe role of the router is to make it easy for us to hop among the 6 different illustrations.  We should also correlate the 6 techniques with the 6 illustrations and make that clear in the sample links.\nAlso note that we have 6 techniques and 7 sample links. That doesn't align.\n. Not precisely true.  We can modify the Hero object itself and that modification flows through to the parent.\nWhat you mean to say is that we can't change the property value and thus cannot replace the hero reference.\n. Please avoid passive constructions such as \"is used\".\nKeep it simple:\nWe use Angular property binding to pass the current iteration hero to the child component.\n. The diagram shows the old ng-for syntax.\n. \"we are age going to use the\"? Do you mean \"we will always use the\"?\n. Not \"can\".  It DOES iterate through ...\n. It is not an \"annotation property\".  It's a property of the @Componentconfiguration object.\n. replace the passive sentence with an active sentence.\n. Missed an important opportunity to talk about how the child can know when an input changes.\nSuppose we bound to a single component ... a message component ...\n<message-box [message]=\"currentMessage\"></message-box>\nHow does the MessageBox know when the currentMessage changes?\nThat's a really important question.\nI can think of 2 ways (I learned them from Victor):\n1. implement the MessagBox.message as a setter-only property.  The setter method is called when the message changes which is the opportunity for the message box to respond (e.g., by changing the color of the display based on whether the message is a success, warning, or error message).\n2. implement ngOnChanges. Angular calls this method when any input value (e.g., the message) changes. \nThe first option is usually the simplest. The second option makes more sense when you want to respond to multiple input binding changes and, perhaps, coordinate among them. For example, if our component is bound to departure and arrival date properties, we'd want to know both dates before updating the display (e.g., showing an error if the user would arrive before departure).\n. It's good point you make about no reverse property binding from child to parent. Enough to observe that all data flows are parent to child during a single JS turn. Flows from child to parent must occur in a subsequent JS turn. This is an aspect of unidirectional data flow (I call it uni-flow for short ;-))\nLet's skip the discussion of why? Just cut these sentences and move on.\n. It is misleading to talk about property and event bindings as two simplex channels. They aren't. They are completely different mechanisms: different syntax, different timing, different binding targets.\nJust say that a child can communicate with its parent via events.\nBetter to say that out\n. Set the problem up.\nNotice that in this illustration we did not provide a way for the child to accept a job. We could have bound a callback method  with a property binding\n\nand may we should show that?\nbut that's hacky.\n\nChild components don't use property binding to communicate with their parents. They can talk to their parents with events.\n. Simplify this section. Suggestion:\n\nWe establish an event-based channel in three steps:\n1. Create a child property that returns an EventEmitter\n2. Declare it to be a public output property\n3. Bind that property to a parent component event handler\n\nRe-arrange the discourse to conform to this recipe.  Write the property first, then declare it public, then bind to it.\n. Make these sub heads imperative. Say \"establish\", \"write\", \"create\".  Not \"establish_ing_\"\n. Don't use the deprecated next method;  use emit!\nFind and fix all occurrences.\n. Don't talk about it. Do it. Use the strongly typed form.\n. Replace the \"snake case\" (which was actually dash- or kebab-case) with camelCase ... everywhere.\n. Too much code. Can't find the relevant part of the template.\nI think we're going to have to move the HTML out of the component and into its own file so that we can use <!-- #docregion --> to cite the appropriate fragment.\n. WAT?  Where did you hear that emitting events is an anti-pattern?\nIt's highly recommended actually. What do you think is wrong with it?\nI think your note actually refers to the NEXT example in which you bind to a parent property.\n. Diagram uses outdated syntax\n. This discussion about parent binding actually _belongs under the first technique ... Property Binding_.\nIt is a way to have bi-directional \"communication\" with property binding alone.\nI don't mind mentioning this approach and then arguing against it. We shouldn't go on about it -- maybe in an appendix but not here -- and I do NOT think we should have a sample that does it.  That only encourages the idea. \n. I believe you have a sequence problem. The discussion of @Output belongs up with the event emitter property.\nWhen you remove the parent example above, this discussion will fall into place.\n. Not an \"annotation property\". See my phrasing w/r/t the inputs array.\n. Too wordy. Reduce ... perhaps to this:\n\nWe bound all every child component's onJobTaken event property to the same parent heroTakesJob method. We have to tell the parent which hero took the job. That's why each child emits the hero that took the job and the binding passes that hero to the parent method via the Angular $event object.\n. Do it, don't talk about it.\n\nDidn't we say this earlier?\n. Why are we talking about this? It's not something we're showing.\nTo be honest, it isn't nearly as bad as passing the parent to the child.\nNote also that we are passing the entire child to the parent when we use the contentChildren approach. If it's \"bad practice\" here, it must be bad practice there, right?\nI think I'd ditch this argument.\n. meh.  Others are good catches.\n. I recommend replacing the hyphen-without-spaces by &mdash;  surrounded by space,  here and everywhere in this document.\n. I prefer the original but it's not a big deal.\n. I've been including a \"Next Steps\" section in the introductory chapters that are on the learning path described in the introduction.\nI don't have such a section for the more \"advanced\"  topics.\nDo you have a better idea?\nNaomi proposed separating the learning path chapters into a \"Basics\" section with sequence number and moving all other chapters to an \"Advanced\" in alphabetical order.  That would make this moot.\n. Thx. Fixing. Also adding a note about IE!\n. Argh! I'll fix and force push\n. I really wanted it to be \"a\", not \"the\".  Don't want to offend others\n. The following kind of test, which you use repeatedly, does not work \naddButton.click(function() {...})\nThe function is never executed; the test always passes.\nThe click method returns a promise. The correct syntax invokes the function within the then success callback:\naddButton.click().then(function() { ... })\n. Why remove the space before the ellipsis? \nMaybe it should read \"we can think of other dependencies that should be shared such as the onboard\"\n. Why remove the title 'Simple Car'?  Doing so makes it difficult to relate this code to the derived \"Super Car\" coming up soon.\n. Without the Super Car title, I can't tell that this is a different class - a derived class - with a different implementation.\nWhy do you think these particular changes are worthwhile?\n. That's a lot of \"that\"s.\nMaybe we can say \"We do have to configure the injector by registering the providers  that create the services our application requires.\"\n. If they blindly copy it, presumably they copy the comment with it. One can only hope that a code reviewer says \"What is that?\"\nUnlike other examples of \"bad\" code, this example is merely discouraged. It still works. Believe it or not, this was once the encouraged practice ;-)\n. \" such as what? \"  ... we don't want to go down that rabbit hole now. \nIf you're curious, a good example is changing the router's default location strategy:\nbootstrap(AppComponent, [\n  ROUTER_PROVIDERS,\n  provide(LocationStrategy,\n         {useClass: HashLocationStrategy})\n])\n. I'd prefer the italics around @Injectable. No biggie\n. You are the comma queen.  I'm not sure why you want the reader to trip over that comma on the way to \"and\". ;-)\n. I vaguely recall that we need a more complete link to API topics if this text is to be re-used in a Dart or JS document. Do you remember what the formula is? I don't.\n. I suppose this is true in both TS and Dart. In JS we'd have to annotate to tell Angular the service/provider lookup token.\n. Maybe we should go with neither ellipsis nor dash but rather the full, unbroken sentence?\nSee my comment.\n. Good point. But this passage makes no sense at all if we can't tell that we're referring to two different classes, one inheriting from the other.\nIf we must we can say 'app/car/car-creations.ts (SimpleCar)' and 'app/car/car-creations.ts (SuperCar)' ... or whatever is technically correct.\n. Feel free to modify the sample itself accordingly. \n. I'm in big trouble then because I've adopted the practice of using italics in these headers when referring to code objects.  The <code> tags (and backtics) are less readable in headers.\nI felt we should do something to differentiate a code symbol from mere text.\nWe are bike shedding ... but I'd really like to settle on something.  Do you really dislike italics?\n. That bothered me too. I'll fix.\n. I've rewritten this segment in the spirit of your suggestion. Hope you think it is an improvement.\n. Easy to remove. Look at _nav.jade under Dart folder. Hack away.\n. Fixed in all three language tracks.\n. Removed \"Testing\" from Dart and JavaScript tracks.\n. Disagree about removing the example which is enormously valuable in exploring the ideas expressed here and closely tracks the ToC here.\nBut I do agree that the purpose should be made clear. Doing that.\n. Please do not add (!). Retract this change.\n. The = is harder to read than (=).  I've gone back and forth on this myself and come to that conclusion. Please retract\n. I know what you mean (because it is there in the QuickStart distribution). But I think it's an awkward parenthetical and not necessary. Please retract.\n. The makeExample extract that you added doesn't \"implement the interface\".  The implementation is the ngOnInit.\nWhat your extract shows is  how we tell TypeScript that the class implements the interface.\nEither we say it that way or leave this out. Thanks.\n. If we keep this, please leave out the blue title bar that reads app/hero-detail.component.ts (class).\nWe're not showing the class, just this one line of the class. I don't think we need the title bar at all.\n. So it will only fail in Europe one day of the year. LOL. I can live with that.\nBut this doesn't get to the point which is about whether the date was formatted by the pipe. So I'm going a different way, adding a regex test that will bracket the international date problem.\n. Replace like with such as:\nLook inside such a file and we'll see a declaration such as this one.\n. Please revert to (change).  We're not trying to be responsive. We're trying to make a point about how (someEvent)=\"0\" is a trick to cause dirty checking when the user enters something.  (input) invites the kind of distracting question that Jesus asked.\nPlease revert type=\"number\". This is a distraction from the point. Again, we're not looking to produce the best app solution here. We're trying to make a narrow point. Let's not add distractions from that point.\n. Why switch from <div> to <ul><li>?  That a distraction. I wanted less code on the page. I didn't want to have to deal with the bullets of a <ul>.\nI'm not going to insist on reverting this.  But I think you are mistakenly trying to improve the code at the expense of the clarity of the Template Syntax. \n\"LESS HTML IS MORE\"\n. Please revert for reasons given in the Dart version.\n. This is I like\n. We are about to have TWO notions of module when _Application Modules_ land in RC5.  That will force the next revision of this doc.\n. What did you have in mind, KW?\n. Is this going to render as \"an decorator\" in TS? I thought you had another token that distinguished \"a decorator\" (ts) from \"an annotation\" (dart).\n. For future reference, I don't mind using the word \"list\" in TypeScript instead of \"array\" if that makes it easier for text sharing with Dart. Everyone in JS/TS land is comfortable interchanging those terms as there is no list type in JS/TS.\n. Can't say \"at runtime\" because the Angular Static Compiler will do it \"offline\". Maybe we just say \"Angular discovers ...\"\n. That's how Angular learns to do \"the right thing\".\n. @RouterConfig is dead as of the new router. Let's just say \"@Injectable, @Input, and @Output\"\n. See my note about this in the code sample. I'm not insisting on reverting this one. But I want to register my distress with the unnecessary HTML bloat introduced by switching from <div> to  <ul><li>.  \nReasonable minds might differ I suppose.\n. Actually, this is wrong. Angular processes bindings from the root of the app down.  \nI don't think we need to specify the details here. Let's just say something like:\n\nAngular processes all data bindings once per JavaScript event cycle from the root of the application component tree down to the leaves.\n. Service is a ...\n\nI don't mind that it is not plural like the section header. I do mind using a plural noun as the name of a category.\n. Dependency injection (italics please)\n. I think we're losing the point by including to much code.\nWhy not say \"Alternatively, we might register at a component level in the providers property of the @Component metadata:\"\nThen the only thing in the \"providers region\" of the sample is:\n// #docregion providers\n  providers:   [HeroService]\n  // #enddocregion providers\n\n. We should add something about the Router. Maybe the following?\n[**Router**](router.html): Navigate from page to page within the client application and never leave the browser.\n. I'll fix that as I merge. Thanks for catching it.\n. Can you explain what the consequences of this (and similar changes) are for the way we write examples in Jade?\n. Why removing (format='') here and elsewhere in this file?\nNot against it. Just wondering why the change.\n. Kind of a PITA I know.  I wanted to fix the folders so we didn't have the discrepancy that requires this hack. That would mean adding firebase rewrite rules to handle external links. Sigh. I guess this gets it done. But it adds technical debt.\n. Actually, something has changed. code-example _used to_ display line numbers by default. \nNow the default is no line numbers. If you want them you have to add them explicitly as in:\ncode-example(format=\"linenums\").\n  // Code with line numbers\n  a\n  b\n  c\nI wonder when this change took place? Not that I'm objecting.\n. This could be build-compile \n. Interesting. The weight of the writer world is in your favor.\nI read several posts like this one which say\n\nThe choice of article is actually based upon the phonetic (sound) quality of the first letter in a word, not on the orthographic (written) representation of the letter. If the first letter makes a vowel-type sound, you use \"an\"; if the first letter would make a consonant-type sound, you use \"a.\" \n\nNews to me and English is my first language. \nThanks.\n. What is this, @chalin ?  Otherwise this PR makes sense to me.\n. what is http_in_memory_web_api? I guess this is all Dart so I shouldn't care ;-)\n. It's actually a \"recent\" release. The latest is ES2016/ES7.\n. I think it is time to strike this alternative.\n. Before we can use the ngModel directive in a two-way data binding, we must import the FormsModule and add it to the Angular module's imports list.\nLearn more about the FormsModule and ngModel in the Forms chapter.\n. See my comment above\n. Consider striking\n. I don't understand what this change fixes.\n. I took a crack at clarifying this particular passage which is a head scratcher.\n. Remove first \"before\" in \"before before\"\n. @johnpapa Apparently the spread operator is still required in routes. I tried removing them all and it wouldn't compile.\nWe are NOT showing export default because we can't make it work with AoT (yet).\n. Not to my ear. Perhaps you can elaborate.\n. Indeed!  Fixed\n. Good point.\n. I don't see where \"your\" is needed. Are you objecting to \"on the current..\"? I don't see anything wrong with that.\n. I don't talk about how the default module is created in this chapter (not yet anyway). Curious as you are, I'd point you to karma-test-shim.js where you'll find\ncoreTesting.TestBed.initTestEnvironment(\n      browserTesting.BrowserDynamicTestingModule,\n      browserTesting.platformBrowserDynamicTesting());\nTo be pedantic, the statement is correct ... it does export CommonModule ... by way of exporting BrowserModule (plus other stuff).\nI'll fix it.\n. TwainComponent:\nngOnInit(): void {\n    this.twainService.getQuote().then(quote => this.quote = quote);\n  }\nThere is no obvious way to get the promise returned by calling twainService.getQuote inside the component. Is it really ambiguous?\nWill get rid of double \"is is\" and add a bit of clarity\n. Yes ... I explained in the context of it.  I deliberately repeated here in the context of beforeEach because I couldn't be sure you would see it here first or there first. Keeping for now.\n. The callbacks receive an AnimationTransitionEvent which contains useful properties such as fromState,\n. What about the same line in _examples/package.json?\n. This should be \"angular\" as well, right?\n. \"responds respond\" ?\n. Yup.  \"In this case, bind to\"\n. The imperative mood can help here and many places, don't you think. \nAs in \"This time, listen to an event\"\n. Curious about the penchant for the present participle. Is \"containing the\" really better than \"that contains the\"? \nThis is a genuine uncertainty on my part. Maybe it's a matter of mixing the two forms so that neither dominates and tires the ear.\n. > Then the interpolation displays the accumulating values property.\nNo need for \"back onto the screen\".\n. > Casting the the $event as an any type trades strong typing for simplified code.\n. I agree with Kathy's approach PLUS mixing in some imperatives.  While there is far too much \"we\" and \"us\", it isn't made better by \"you\".  \nLet's also look to remove future tense. \nWow was I sloppy.  It's painful to re-read some of this ;-)\n. > the shortest statement imaginable,\n. > Here's a rewrite of the previous keyup example that uses the variable to get the user's input.\n. > A nice aspect\nThe intensifier weakened the point ... as intensifiers usually do\n. > The (keyup) event handler hears every keystroke.\n. We should keep the reason for the keyup.enter alternative. How about this?\n```\n  Sometimes only the Enter key matters because it signals that the user has finished typing. \nThe event handler could examine every $event.keyCode and pounce on the Enter key.\n  But there's an easier way: bind to the keyup.enter pseudo-event and Angular will call the\n  handler for that key alone.\n+makeExample('user-input/ts/app/keyup.components.ts', 'key-up-component-3' ,'app/keyup.components.ts (v3)')(format=\".\")\n.l-sub-section\n:marked\n  In this example, the data binding expression handles the event. It's a better practice to\n  minimize JavaScript in HTML and move this code into the component.\n```\n. Let's crisp up the entire intro. What do you think of this:\n\nIn the previous example, the current state of the input box is lost if the user mouses away and clicks elsewhere on the page without first pressing Enter.\nTo fix that, listen for both the Enter key and the blur event.\n. @kwalrath We've been consistently calling these things \"chapters\".  When did they become \"pages\"?\n. > Although the example works, it relies on JavaScript in the HTML. That's a bad practice. Move the JavaScript to the component class.\n. > You have mastered the basic primitives for responding to user input and gestures. \nThey quickly become verbose and clumsy when handling large amounts of user input. Two-way data binding is a more elegant and compact way to move values between data entry fields and model properties. The next chapter, \"Forms\", explains how to write two-way bindings with NgModel .\n. We are switching ot you. But this switch is just one part of a deliberate sweep of the docs leading to conformance with the Google docs standards. No need for Brandon to take that on for this particular revision.\n\nAfter  a doc has been converted, then our revisions must conform.\n. This is a true type. Thanks. Except it should be \"add it to the\"\n. These two common animations have their own aliases:\n. Yes. We want links to external sites to appear in a new browser tab by default. Can't specify that in markdown\n. oops\n. Thought about that. We need some context here.  I only repeat the intro and this is material that shouldn't change even if our implementation does. I didn't think making up a new summary description would make a difference. I'll crisp it up in the Http chapter.\n. That's what I think I'm saying here. Did I leave that in doubt? That is, after all, how this attack works. I'll try to clarify.\n. the + in front of params is not needed because the CrisisService.getCrisis converts the string id\n. The CrisisService.getCrisis returns a promise. Are you saying that switchMap handles that as if the service method returned an observable? [A: apparently yes ... says the discussion of switchMap in the prose.]\nAnd why is  switchMap needed at all? What was wrong with the original code, assuming we replace forEach with subscribe. This version is longer with more parts (the switchMap import and usage). To what purpose?\n. Why? What's wrong with type inference?\n. Why? What's wrong with type inference?\n. Why? The imported switchMap is not used? Nor is it mentioned in the accompanying text.\n. Why? Don't do this. Let type inference do its thing.\n. That's it???  That's all you're going to say? No explanation of what switchMap does or why we're using it ... as opposed to the more obvious subscribe?\nWe can't treat our readers like that. Need to let them know that an explanation is coming\n. This is not an explanation that justifies switchMap\n. I don't see the point of talking about flatMap which we (and the reader) hadn't contemplated using in the first place.\n. At last ... an explanation.  Seems too late in the chapter.\n. Is this the justification for switchMap?  I guess it makes some sense even though this app doesn't support direct re-navigation to the route and the service doesn't support canceling a request. Maybe these will be capabilities some day.\nMeanwhile, we're introducing something that our reader is not prepared to understand.\nWhy is this important here when we are trying to teach routing? It feels like it makes routing seem even more complicated.\n. \"to perform operations\"?  It can only perform ONE operation, right? If we say anything it might be\n\nWe import the switchMap operator because we need it later to process the Observable route parameters.\n. This sentence (which I probably wrote originally) needs to be reworked. Too wooden, too complicated.\n\nTry:\n...\nThen we inject the ActivatedRoute in the HeroListComponent constructor.\n[show the code snippet]\nThe  ActivatedRoute.params property is an Observable of route parameters. The params emits new id values when the user navigates to the component.  In ngOnInit we subscribe to those values, set the selectedId, and get the heroes. \n...\nAlso re-title the code snippet which purports to be about the constructor but is actually about both the constructor and the ngOnInit.\n. Thanks for adding this.\n. I wonder why the original said there is an array of route parameters. There is a params object and the  +params['id'] expression gets the id parameter from that object. Weird.\nRewrite\n...\nNote how the switchMap operator maps the id in the observable route parameters\nto a new Observable, the result of the  HeroService.getHero method.\nIf the user re-navigates to this component while a getHero request is still inflight,\nswitchMap cancels that old request before calling  HeroService.getHero again.\n...\n. As I understand it from the new prose (which I did not see when I made this comment), the switchMap has the ability to cancel an in-flight request. That's useful if (a) the user can re-navigate to this component instance with a different id and (b) the previous request could somehow arrive after a new request returned.  (a) is not possible in this app and (b) is highly unlikely. But ... at least I understand the intention.\nI guess I'll let it go ... for now.  I'm removing my objections to switchMap here and elsewhere in this PR.\n. Upon further reflection, while I remain profoundly uncomfortable with what seems like a distraction to me, I'm letting it slide. \n. > What a developer calls the root component is their call.\nThe docs, the styleguide, and the cli all create and refer to AppModule and AppComponent. These are not my conventions. They are our conventions. \nAs with any conventions you are free to create your own, but you would be wise to do so only with a good reason.\n. As I have been told, the QuickStart is not a \"conceptual journey\". It is supposed to be a clear, straightforward path to a start.\nThis is a confusing path here, creating first one module and then another. \n. Frankly this one sentence doesn't \"teach concepts\" more than any of the many other sentences around it.  I don't understand why the other statements are valuable and this one is not.\nWe can delete the comment. If we do I suggest we remove the backticks too  ... even though experience teaches us that it is easier to add HTML to the template when you start with backticks.\n. I went back and forth on this. I decided to keep export even though not needed rather than have this be a difference later or make you wonder why AppModule is exported and AppComponent is not.\n. Agree needed better verb. I went with \"run\" instead of \"display\" or \"use\"\n. Removed all periods from these bullets for consistency (rather than make them all sentences.)\n. Wrote:\n.l-sub-section\n  :marked\n    ### Next step\n    [The _Tour of Heroes_ tutorial](../tutorial)\nThe forced magic generated \"next step\" bothers me. I want to say what the next step is.

Fixed platformBrowserDynamic().boot..\nDropped \"!\". Now just \"Hello Angular\"\n. Two votes to remove export on component class to my one; you both win.\n. Are you sure that we don't have to wait for the browser to settle after clicking the button. That line had a purpose at one time.\n. This change seems picayune.  I feel it distracts from the point and starts a conversation that isn't helpful.  I can understand that you feel that being inspecific about the units in the property name provokes a distracting conversation too. I don't actually feel strongly about this so I'd say \"whatever, OK\" . \n. Good\n. Please make \"EventEmitter\" italic. That's the (desired) standard presentation of code elements in a header ... because EventEmitter doesn't display well in a header.\n. See my corrective above\n. I'm cool with it\n. \"minimal\" seems to capture my intent best. Thx fellas.\n. Done. And dropped unused langName var\n. Fixed. Thx.\n. I remember putting them in because someone complained that it didn't work on his/her browser. They're harmless, right?\n. Done\n. Done. Thx.\n. They need to be links that open a browser tab (that's the rule for links to outside the doc). I've put these vars in in the anchors. \n. done\n. done\n. Done\n. Agreed. Reverted to bullets\n. Done\n. It does but we have counter argument that samples must look consistent.\n. Nah. That serves no real purpose and it distracts.\n. Actually, it is no longer true! Removed.\n. Done\n. While you are correct that there is not a tree of modules, there is still a root module ... the one that you bootstrap.\nThe word \"root\" is significant and appears widely in the docs and the API. Recall the forRoot method.  Reworded to distance from the notion of a folders.\n. I got push back from high places that Angular doesn't have this convention, we do. So I'm trying to be more explicit about that.\n. I don't like line numbers for short files, even if they are complete. I'm not a stickler about it but it's how I roll.\n. Fixed.\n. Fixed\n. Agreed\n. Fixed\n. Disagree. These are phrases that continue \"As much fun as this is ...\"\n. True but harmless. Meanwhile, the maintainer can change the label w/o breaking external links. I'll take that trade.\n. I understand. And I tried variations. But the problem is that the download instruction is NOT a code snippet. \nI wish we had a tab thingy so I could put the instructions with tab panes ... and format those panes as desired. Maybe you want to add that to _scripts-include.jade ;-)\n. Done\n. Done\n. Fixed.\n. Prefer the first.\n. I linked to the glossary entry which doesn't really add more info. I didn't want to go to the AoT guide because that's overwhelming.\n. I went back and forth on that earlier in my process. I generally don't like one sentence paragraphs. But your feedback pushed me in favor here.\n. Changed it to \"typed superset\", as described by the TypeScript site itself.\n. Done\n. You dog!  You noticed I took Dart out. I'll put it back.  I have to put a placeholder in for the Dart link because it 404s as I write this comment.\n. Wanted to emphasize \"action\"\n. True but the counterargument - all samples should have a consistent style - prevailed.\n. Good idea. Done.\n. It's technically OK in TS although misleading. It would read like this:\nHeroesComponent(this._heroService,\n                  );\nThat's pretty awful in all kinds of ways. There should be another way to convey the message.\n. Would you please remove this removeComments setting too. That is the default setting and we don't want it here. I thought I'd removed it everywhere but I guess I missed this one.\nThen I can merge your PR.. Wasn't clear to me at all. I think I can fix that. But why care if the tag is rendered or not? Why not just use a span?. \"zero\" did not work\n. This file is a precursor to the final app.component.html. The title step hasn't occurred yet. It's ok. Ok so this is another way to translate something w/o putting a DOM element in. Who cares? . I think we should just skip the \"zero\" \"one\" \"two\" thing.. Do we really need this in the docs? The pluralization rules just get weirder and weirder the more you  read about them. Our docs don't seem like the right place for this.\n. Let's just cut this section.. You MUST have -- before the flags or ne marche pas\n. I'll clarify the prose ... in case someone really does care.. Yup. That's the way you have to do it.. Deleted this passage.. I deleted this. Just have =n now.. Yes.  I think we don't have to explain all the reasons you'd do this. The CSS one was compelling enough.. Thanks.. This should stay in English: \"Translate text messages\".  The Spanish was cute but inconsistent. Let's fix the actual subhead too.. Why the comma? A comma in that position indicates a pause. Would you pause as in \"... require translation ... ... ... too\"? Who speaks like that? Please remove it or explain.. Oh my. Why did I write the passive?  Thanks for fixing.. Needed more thorough rewrite. Disagree: \"the\" was correct. There can be only one \"initial\" url. reverting to \"the\"; see comment above.. Actually, per issue #3055, we should have been referring to the \"Services\" episode. Fixing that in my update.. Agree this passage needed work. I took it a bit further.. I always add an explicit anchor in case the section title changes; don't want to break external links.. @DeborahK @kapunahelewong The problem with talking about routing resolvers is that we'd have to show it. There is no router in this code. \nIn other doc examples, the detail component calls the dataservice rather than passing in through an Input(). We don't show that either.  \nSo I don't know that there is anything actionable here.. Yes ... really want @kara perspective on this.  She has been so adamant about immutability in the past ... and that's the only argument against having NgModel in ReactiveFormsModule AFAIK.. Yup. It's a clarity trade-off. . Maybe this makes it clearer?\n\nExplicitly declare the type of the heroForm property to be FormGroup; you'll initialize it later. . @DeborahK Not following the question.  Yes, those symbols are needed. I searched the text and see that we didn't make a point of applying the decorators. They're in the code base but we don't say anything other than in our summary of imports on L#152.\n\nI think our justification is that the reader is presumed to know what they are and do by the time they get to this guide. BUT maybe we shouldn't assume so much. Maybe we need to add a sense where we first add input/output fields. We'd link to the doc that discusses them more fully (not sure what that is).\nWhat do you think @kapunahelewong ?. Please revert to Single Responsibility Principle as it is known throughout the world by that name and its initials, SRP.. I prefer the infinitive to the participle.\n\nIt is a better practice to redistribute the component and its supporting classes into their own, dedicated files.. Should these be two separate DOs?\nDo use upper camel case for class names.\nDo match the name of the symbol to the name of the file.. I think the following is better\nDo append the symbol name with the conventional suffix (such as Component, Directive, Module, Pipe, or Service) for a thing of that type. . I think the following is better\nDo give the filename the conventional suffix (such as .component.ts, .directive.ts, .module.ts, .pipe.ts, or .service.ts ) for a file of that type.. Better?\nWhy? Consistent conventions make it easy to quickly identify and reference assets of different types.. >Do suffix a service class name with Service. For example, something that gets data or heroes should be called a DataService or a HeroService. \nA few terms are unambiguously services. They typically indicate agency by ending in \"er\". You may prefer to name a service that logs messages Logger rather than LoggerService. Decide if this exception is agreeable in your project. As always, strive for consistency.. >and there are no repetitive or redundant names.. Should it be?\nthis folder and file structure example\n\nIf referring to a section, italicize as in\n\nthis Folder and File Structure example. Please rewrite as follows:\n\nDo declare components, directives, and pipes in a shared module when those items will be re-used and referenced by the components declared in other feature modules.\nConsider using the name SharedModule, when the contents of a shared module are referenced across the entire application.\nDo not provide services in shared modules. Services are usually singletons that are provided once for the entire application or in a particular feature module.. Better?:\n\nConsider collecting numerous, auxiliary, single-use classes inside a core module\nto simplify the apparent structure of a feature module. \nConsider calling the application-wide core module, CoreModule .\nImporting CoreModule into the root  AppModule  reduces its complexity and emphasizes its role as orchestrator of the application as a whole.. >Why?

The details of data management, such as headers, HTTP methods, caching, error handling, and retry logic, are irrelevant to components and other data consumers.\nA data service encapsulates these details. It's easier to evolve these details inside the service without affecting its consumers. And it's easier to test the consumers with mock service implementations.. Replace this line and next\n\nWhy? Lifecycle interfaces prescribe typed method signatures. use those signatures to flag spelling and syntax mistakes.. Please revert to the &nbsp;.  I wanted that extra spacing.. Please revert the &lt; as our jade engine is confused by angle brackets.. @DeborahK Hmmm. It's a trade-off.\n\nPro current\n\nWe simplify the prose by not constantly repeating \"add imports\" over and over and over.\nK explains those imports and their roles so that the reader should be able to tell what's needed for what.\nTools like VS Code tell you when you're not using an import ... so you can clean up if you want\nNo harm in including more symbols than you use.\nThis is NOT an introductory guide; it's supposed to be read after you have a foundation in Angular, which is why we didn't delve into all kinds of details beyond imports and inputs/outputs\n\nCons\n- The careless reader who lacks experience with Angular and TS may think every imported symbol is necessary.  Not sure what conclusion such a reader draws.\nIMO, the pros of \"standing pat\" outweigh the cons.  But then I did stack the deck :). Please change the first logged message to\nlog.push(`Initial value of ${propName} set to ${to}`);\nand update the image. Otherwise, LGTM. You could say that it looks like the live example. We usually explain that you can run the sample in a live coding environment and download the code from there.\nCan you rephrase to that effect?. Feels wooden and alternates between singular user to plural users/them.\nMaybe should speak as if \"you\", the reader, are clicking through the app ... in which case this all becomes \"you\" rather than \"users/they\".. >such as your machine\nMay be better to just cut this. Devs know what a \"local environment\" means.. Actually, if you only followed the current setup instructions, there would be many more files.  I just added a section to the Setup guide for deleting non-essential files. We should refer to that too.\nSee https://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/3079 which will merge soon.\nThe link to it would be\n[_Deleting non-essential files_](../guide/setup.html#non-essential \"Setup: Deleting non-essential files\"). I made a note in the \"Todos\" at the top of this PR that we need to review the images and the current state of the ToH app. These images were taken before ToH 6.. See earlier comment in which I wonder whether \"should look like this\" adequately conveys the idea that the app can be run in plunker and downloaded from there.. >Show the hero\nAs I've been going from \"we\" to \"you\", I've found that going to \"the\" is often less jarring ... particularly when there is a parade of punishing \"you\"s.

Since this was written, there is no need to \"change the quotes ... to backticks\".  They already are backticks.  \nNot everyone will know about backticks or ES2015 strings yet so we should still call this out:\n``\n  To show all of the hero's properties,\n  add afor the hero'sidproperty and anotherfor the hero'sname`.\nKeep the template readable by placing each <div> on its own line.\n  The backticks around the component template let you \n  put the <h1>, <h2>, and <div> elements on their own lines, thanks to the\n  template literals\n  feature in ES2015 and TypeScript. \n```. With the link to template literals (as seen in my comment), we don't need this anymore.. This part, where we show them the wrong way to do it, should be removed. It seemed useful at the time.

But in more than a year of working with template driven on real apps, we have never noticed the asynchronous nature of value and validity. In fact, people have been very happy with the ease of using template forms.\nUnless the consequences are easy to describe/illustrate, this paragraph should be removed.\n@kapunahelewong Please mark this for reconsideration.. @kara No problem softening it. Are you suggesting that we should mutate the data object?  If so, why not offer NgModel as part of ReactiveFormsModule?. Not so fast. What other way is there to use ngModel in template forms such that Angular will push/pull data values? When, in template forms, do we use ngModel except in [(ngModel)] syntax?  Hardly ever if ever, right?. >When writing in a reactive style, you determine the timing and flow of data between the data model and the screen. You rarely, if ever, use two-way data binding. For this reason, the ngModel directive is not part of the ReactiveFormsModule.\nFWIW, while I'm not sure who owns \"reactive principles\", the react framework and its acolytes routinely describe data binding as contrary to reactive principles. . Agree. Delete.. >exclusively on reactive forms techniques.. I see both points. @kapunahelewong do you think we could get by with a brief, forward looking paragraph?\n\nYou'll learn about reactive forms by building one from scratch.\nIn the next section, you'll prepare your project for reactive forms.\nThen you'll learn about the Angular form classes and how to use them in a reactive form.\n\nIf we really need to, we can forward link \"learn about the Angular form classes\" in that sentence.. That's two strong votes to \"import as needed\".  Let's do it @kapunahelewong.  I'll help you get the #docregion's right.. I'm confused. Doesn't the form itself have to be a FormGroup? Would one ever create a reactive form without a form and its FormGroup?\nIf the answer is \"no\", because this is a guide to reactive forms, rather than to forms parts and pieces, I think we should describe the FormGroup here and keep going.. \"you\" for \"we\". Is FormGroup a reactive form directive or is it a \"forms\" directive? I can see a FormGroup when I write template driven too.\nFine with the rephrasing otherwise.. You mean?\n\nThe HeroDetailComponent template uses FormGroup and FormControlName directives from the ReactiveFormsModule .\n\nNotice I omitted \"in the @angular/forms library\".  That makes the sentence too long and the reader will see it in the code anyway.. Because of the previous sentence re-write, we can't use the pronoun, \"it\".\n\nso you must add the ReactiveFormsModule to the\n. The argument for form model is that the value is a highly structured object that models the form. You must understand its structure to do anything with it and it's critical that it closely approximates the form control structure of nested groups, arrays, and controls.\n\nI feel pretty strongly that this isn't just any value and I feel pretty good about our use of the term throughout this guide.\nThere is little risk of confusing it with ngModel because we've made clear that (a) ngModel is a directive and (b) that directive doesn't exist in the reactive forms world.. k.. We'll do it.. Does this do it?\n\nAdd a createForm method to the component that uses the FormBuilder to define the heroForm.. I like it!. >Nesting groups and controls in this way. We are so close to done. Unless there are strong objections, lets stick with what @kapunahelewong has here.. That's better.. k. Rephrase as a 3rd list item\n\nThe form controls never update the data model.\n\n\nThen pick up at \"The form and data model structures ...\". Yes. @kapunahelewong let's find a way to make this clear. Perhaps\n\nPreviously you created a control and initialized its value at the same time. You can also initialize or reset the values later with the setValue and patchValue methods.\n\nIf we feel the need to link to an example, the earliest occasion is #formbuilder. How about ...\nThe setValue method checks the data object thoroughly before assigning any form control values.\n * It rejects a data object that doesn't match the FormGroup structure.\n * It rejects a data object if it is missing values for any control in the group.\n * It returns helpful error messages.\nIf you have a typo or nested controls incorrectly, setValue will catch the error and report it clearly. patchValue will fail silently.. that's better.. And adding the imports here won't hurt either ;-). Because we didn't want to burden this example with RxJS imports.  The http guide shows both techniques.\nIncidentally, in the developer community the jury is still out on whether a data service should return an Observable or a Promise to its consuming component.  Even Ben Lesh is waffling.. @kara I think @DeborahK really wanted to drive home the difference between the hero's address model property and the FormGroup that presents it on screen.\nI'm cool with making this point here although I'm very glad we didn't introduce it earlier.. @kara.  I thought about that too. What a shame that Angular 1 has taken ownership of a perfectly useful word, \"watch\".  \"Observe\" is kind of snooty.\nThis was one of many steps in an effort to take back \"watch\".\nLet's compromise. Set the section title to \"Observe\" but let the paragraph use \"watch\" as a synonym.. See my comment above about why I used \"watch for\". It expresses our intent. We already made clear that subscribe is how you watch in RxJS.. @kapunahelewong Let's change the method to logNameChange. Rename the #docregion accordingly.. @kara My problem with your recommendation is that it requires the component to inject the data service. This is kind of a \"no no\" in apps (like this one) that follow the \"container/presentational\" (FKA \"smart/dumb\") pattern.  It isn't bloat at all if you care about that pattern. \nAre you saying you don't care? We could still use the Input hero to receive the model instance and call the data service to save it.  I hear kittens dying ... but I'm a puppy person myself.. The reactive form directives aren't prescriptive. I've been told, however, that you felt strongly about avoiding data model mutation when using the reactive style.\nWe can crisp this up so it is less pedantic. Let me take a look at that.\nUpdate: mission accomplished (I hope).. Interesting idea. I'm not using forms at all here and isn't particularly form-y. This is a pretty simple selection harness. Of course I'm open to a suggestion.. Because (a) this section is about patchValue and (b) didn't know you could do that.\nEven though you can, does it make sense when we're trying to focus on patchValue?. Let's do it. I like it. However, I hesitate because we have a policy about not contrasting Angular to Angular 1. We pretend that Angular 1 doesn't exist (except in the conversion guides).  Talking Angular 1 confuses noobs who never used it and once we start down this path ... it goes over the cliff.. k.  @kapunahelewong and I will figure out how to clean this up.. Can't use \"we/our\" any more. The following is ok\n\nAdd a new method that uses the FormBuilder to define the heroForm; call it createForm. Ooooo. That's important. Let's do as you say and highlight directive.. Sell me with an example. We can't just talk about it. I have no idea what you're talking about even now.  @DeborahK what did you run into that illustrates this point.. @DeborahK How does \"input elements\" expand from just the <input> element to <select>, <textarea>, <form> etc.? I'm open to it. But \"form element\" is the only thing that seemed safe.\n\nSee https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms. ^ That's something you'd do in template driven forms?\nWe don't show this technique anywhere in the docs.\nOne reason to fear it:  this approach requires that the component class understand the structure of f.value. One beauty of template driven and binding with ngModel is that the template is loosely coupled to the component class. The component class doesn't have to know how the controls are layed out. \nIt also means writing more code to move the contents of that f.value object into something that can be passed to a data service save method.\nI don't know anyone who does this.  @DeborahK  do you?  Never seen it in a demo or presentation let alone real code.\nThat doesn't mean it's wrong. But it is kind of difficult to promote in the absence of documented examples and experience.\nI know this sounds like I'm closed to the idea. I'm not. I'm struggling to relate the suggestion to something we haven't shown or recommended somewhere in the docs.\n. I mean that we should document it in the (template driven) forms guide if we're serious about promoting it and then we can reference that pattern here.\nNET ... let's remove the [( )] around ngModel as @kara requests.. Yuck. I don't like the original and not loving the update. \nHow about getting to the problem and the point of this page.\n\nThe AppComponent is doing everything at the moment. First it showed details of a single hero. Then it became a master/detail form with both a list of heroes and the hero detail. You can't keep piling new features into one component; that's not maintainable. \nYou'll want to break it up into other sub-components,each focused on a specific feature or workflow. Eventually, the AppComponent could become a simple shell that hosts those sub-components.\nIn this page, you'll take the first step in that direction by carving out the hero details into a separate, reusable component. . No longer needed if you like the new intro.. The reader should know the drill by now. We don't need a separate  section for this. Just say.\nKeep the app transpiling and running by entering the npm start command in a terminal window as you did before, and continue building the Tour of Heroes.\n\nWe'll need to go back to toh-pt1.jade and add a#keep-transpiling above that section so that the new link works.. >## Make a hero detail component. Let's cut the theory ... and this link ... and the repeat of the motivation that I added at the top.  \nLet's cut this entire section ... straight through \"Separate the hero detail component\" and begin with ...\n\nAdd a file named .... Remove the sub-section completely. See next comment.. Wooden. Also, we didn't have a style guide when this tutorial was written. \n\nLet's make this whole section more crisp. What do you think of this?\n\nAdd a file named hero-detail.component.ts to the app folder. This file will hold the new HeroDetailComponent.\nThe file and component names follow the standard described in the Angular style guide.\n\n\nThe component class name should be written in upper camel case and end in the word \"Component\". The hero detail component class is HeroDetailComponent.\n\n\nThe component file name should be spelled in lower dash case, each word separated by dashes, and end in .component.ts. The HeroDetailComponent class goes in the hero-detail.component.ts file.\n\n\nBegin writing the HeroDetailComponent as follows:\n+makeExample('toh-3/ts/app/hero-detail.component.ts', 'v1', 'app/hero-detail.component.ts (initial version)')(format=\".\")\n. I think the comment above clears this up.. The following rewrite replaces everything in this section through to the Hero detail template section. It also answers your question.\n``\n  To define a component, you always import theComponentsymbol. \n  You imported theInput` symbol at the same time because you'll need it soon.\n\nThe @Component decorator provides the Angular metadata for the component.\n  You specified the selector name, my-hero-detail, that identifies this component's element\n  when it's referenced later in another component template.\n. >Always `export` the component class because you'll always `import` it elsewhere.. The instructions aren't quite correct. How about this rewrite?\n  ### Hero detail template\n  To move the hero detail view to the HeroDetailComponent,\n  cut the hero detail content from the AppComponent template\n  and paste it into a new template property in the @Component metadata.\nThe HeroDetailComponent has a hero, not a selected hero. \n  So replace the word selectedHero with hero everywhere in the template.\n  When you're done, the new template should look like this:\n. >The template binds to a `hero` property.  Add that property to the component class, giving it the type `Hero`.. >The `hero` property refers to the `Hero` class which is still in the `app.component.ts` file.. Delete this sentence. We just said that.. Now that the `Hero` class is in its own file, the `AppComponent` and the `HeroDetailComponent` have to import it.\nAdd the following `imports` statement near the top of the `app.component.ts` and `hero-detail.component.ts` files.. Yes there is ... and I've included it in my commit:\n// Enable production mode unless running locally\nif (!/localhost/.test(document.location.host)) {\n  enableProdMode();\n}\n```. The word \"watch\" has been replaced.. I believe I have successfully finessed this issue.. I think we've managed to cut this way back. We simply explain how to create a new hero object from the changes, which I believe really is essential, without architectural commentary.. @kapunahelewong found a way to work it in. Well done.. Thanks to your checkbox example (to be added to the Forms guide), we have an example and the point makes sense to me.\nWe'll be able to reference that example in future. For now, I'm suggesting:\n\nOne advantage of working with form control objects directly is that value and validity updates are always synchronous and under your control. You won't encounter the timing issues that sometimes plague a template-driven form.. Can you suggest an alternative sentence that explains why NgModel is not available when you import ReactiveFormsModule? My understanding from @DeborahK is that you actively discourage using it in reactive forms (after importing it from FormsModule).. Converted HeroService to Observable and async pipe in code. Someone should confirm my technique. @kapunahelewong - please update the prose.. @kara What would that look like. You can see the progression now.  How would one do a control all by itself in the absence of the form envelope? Does that mean the <form> element is not in the html for that example.  TBH, we are confused about both the use case and how to code it. A code snippet or plunker would help.. My reason was that I was gathering together the queries I wanted to do in tests. Wasn't sure how many tests I would write but I was pretty sure the affordances should be involved. \n\nDid it make the tests hard to read?. \"splitted\" is not an Engish word. The past tense of split is ... split. Please change.. I hate to be picky but could you align the from keywords while you're making other fixes?. Style guide says we separate 3rd party imports from app imports with a blank line.. Why false? I realize we generally don't test model classes.  But is that true for classes in general? I'm not saying I know the answer.. Replace \"we\" in these these final sentences. \nSuggested phrasing:\nThat's about all you'd expect to do in a \"Hello, World\" app.\nYou're ready to take the Tour of Heroes Tutorial and build a small application that demonstrates the great things you can build with Angular.\nOr you can stick around a bit longer to learn about the files in your brand new project. \n. It is an expression in English. I fear it's a bit too colloquial for our guide. I know it's pedestrian but how about\n```\nProject file review\n```\n\nCut the marketeering about \"rock solid\".  Not sure what \"enterprise\" means anymore either. I think the following will do:\nAn Angular-CLI  project is the  foundation for both quick experiments and enterprise solutions.\n. Delete \"Let's go over the goodie bag:\"  . It is the root component.  It's also the component that you bootstrap. But we still call it the root component.. \"go here.\" instead of \"goes in here.\"  Maybe this is better:\n\n\nFiles that belong to the application go here, including components, templates, services, classes, styles, and images. Files that help you build and deploy the app belong outside of the src/ folder.. I was confused by the intro to this section, How about ...\nThe app/ folder is just one of the items inside the project's root src/ folder. Other files help you build, test, maintain, document, and deploy the app. These files go in the src/ folder next to app/.. Reversing. Talking about the directive class, not the selector name. The class has features. The selector does not. HTH.. Let me try again and see if it helps.. How about \"if you omit the brackets\"\n\nI thought I fixed all the \"we\" to \"you\". Hmmm. Why are you disabling this test?. Oh my!  Some kind of search and replace changed \"your\" or \"we\" to \"directive\".  Seems to have been limited to this location. Fixed it..

How about ...\n\nFor a use case in which inject and TestBed.get do not work, see the section Override a component's providers, which explains  why you must get the service from the component's injector instead.\n. >The TwainService implementation is irrelevant for this particular test..

FIrst, you couldn't use the style binding to set the background when the user hovers.

I just saw these, and I'm really looking forward to them going in. Thanks for your work, @gorork!\n. LGTM. Thanks, @PzYon!\n. ptal. I beefed up the tools coverage. Hope it's not too beefy.\n. @rkirov I'm planning to merge this unless you scream no...\n. Good point. Merged! I'll update the site soon.\n. I pushed the site, and filed bug #140 to follow up on the... lowlighting?\n. I'm updating this to 26. (See also issue #141.)\n. @davideast here are my changes that correspond to #142.\n. OK, I'm going to commit and push the site. Scream if you disagree....\n. I'm making the corresponding Dart changes in #139.\n. @davideast maybe you could take a look? I'll update the corresponding Dart PR (#139) to be 26, not 25. \n. @davideast or @rkirov could you take a look?\n. @davideast could you take a look? This might overlap with some other bugs/PRs.\n. Thanks for the fix!\n. FYI, we probably won't deploy the site until next week, so don't worry if you don't see the fix online.\n. @davideast or @rkirov could you review?\n. LGTM. Thanks for the fix!\n. @naomiblack is out, but this seems safe enough, so I'll merge it and attempt to republish.\n. The fix is up! Please let me know if you notice anything that went wrong with the updated site. (I had to delete an extra lesson: #196.)\n. @stevenroose can you tell me which version this name changed? The guide is a couple of versions behind, but I was pretty sure everything worked as of that version.\n(If this is a recent change, then we should update all the files to the latest version.)\n. Thanks very much, @stevenroose. I'm a little reluctant to update only this file to alpha-35, so perhaps I should just update them all. (Your work will have made the job much easier.)\nDo you have any doubt (per @todoubaba's comment to ask @vsavkin) as to whether this should be viewBindings or hostInjector/bindings?\n. Thanks vsvakin.\n. Just to update you, I haven't forgotten about this, but I haven't yet found the time to test/update all the docs.\n. Another update... I'm prepping an alpha.38 version of the guide. Besides this change, it'll also add angular2.dart imports to most of the Dart files. (Importing bootstrap.dart isn't sufficient any more in alpha.38, as per this commit.)\n. Another update: the alpha.38 PR (#223) is LGTM'd and waiting for alpha.38 to be published.\n. I just confirmed that viewBindings is in the text at https://angular.io/docs/dart/latest/guide/displaying-data.html, and viewInjector no longer exists there.\n. Thanks for the heads up, @PascalPrecht. I'll make sure the docs and examples have that change.\n. I happened to notice a small punctuation error. Someone more familiar with the JS dev process should probably review this.\n. I believe the Alt file shows how to do examples in the new way, whatever that is. You might want to update that too.\n. Oh, and... I accepted this because the alt page isn't required for this site, but did you restart the harp server? I think json file changes require restarting it.\n. Sorry, I meant running harp compile again. I'm not sure whether watch-and-serve would be enough.\n. I've updated the imports and import discussions.\n. Oops.\n. My understanding is that this page will go away, in favor of the Quick Start. I'll leave this open until that happens.\n. My understanding is that this page will go away, in favor of the Quick Start. I'll leave this open until that happens.\n. We also need to ignore build directories.\n. It doesn't seem to be a problem any more, so yes, I guess it was done.\n. 2 reviewers have confirmed that this is good, so go ahead and merge it as soon as you practically can.\n. @naomiblack this brings the Dart quick start up to alpha 44 and updates the sample locations.\n. I've seen this complaint from googlebot before. I see that you have signed the CLA, so we needn't worry about it. (It'd be nice, but not crucial, to figure out how to avoid it in the future.)\n. @kevmoo do you have an answer for Tom's bootstrap CDN question?\n. It looks like this is ready to go. Correct? If so, @tomplusplus please remove the [WIP] and I'll merge it (not using the big green button). The commit message should match the angular commit message guidelines, but  I can take care of that.\n. LGTM. Thanks!\nYou've confirmed that the samples still work? (I can't remember if there were any breaking changes between 39 & 45.)\n. OK, that makes sense. So you'll remove the WIP when that's complete?\n. I'll do the honors, but I think we might still need @wardbell or @naomiblack to update the site.\n. then() is fine. I'd like to revisit this sometime, though, to see if we can't make it easier to explain.\n. @kevmoo lgty?\n. Yep\n. I'm going to start on the tutorial now, fwiw...\n. About my template syntax work: I've only been working on the text, not the code yet, so it's not too late to switch to something else.\nAbout the enums: @kevmoo what do you think we should do? I've never used enums in Dart, except to demonstrate very basic usage.\nTom, let's chat on Slack later... I'll be offline for about an hour, but when I get back we can talk.\n. @kevmoo Do you have an opinion on the fix? I'm inclined to take this code as-is, so I can get started on the text.\n. The fix was to reuse maps (styles & classes) rather than returning a new object each time. This is different from the TS code, and it took a while to figure out what to do.\n. The fix was to reuse maps (styles & classes) rather than returning a new object each time. This is different from the TS code, and it took a while to figure out what to do.\n. I guess we should cover these modes in the docs. It's slightly complicated by the fact that Dart has its own modes (checked vs production).\nHowever, it looks like prod mode doesn't work for Dart: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/5982, https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/6189\n.

I haven't started the Template Syntax docs yet, so I don't know whether these changes will be visible. I suspect they will be, though.\n. Did you get a chance to look at Ward's changes?\nI think app-component.html should be app_component.html, but otherwise I'm inclined to take this as-is. We can always iterate...\n. I'm taking a look at this sample right now...\n. I fixed a few issues and committed this. It still needs work, though.\n. Thanks!\n. lgtm, after you fix/remove window.console.log. (If you've used that in any other samples, we should change it to print().)\n. One more thing I forgot: Please add a comment with the text #docregion at the top of every file, using whatever the comment syntax is for that type of file. For example, in a Dart file:\n// #docregion\n...\nMore details at https://angular.io/docs/styleguide.html. (I'll take care of the forms examples, since I'm working on that guide right now.)\nCould you also remove any filenames you see at the tops of files? Those aren't necessary any more with the new styles.\nThanks!!\n. @wardbell Is it OK to have many copies of the sample? I'll ask some other questions in comments on the author guide.\n. @wardbell: This might be ready to go.\n. I'm happy to merge it if you're happy (enough) with the text style. The content is just a Darty version of the TS content, so I believe it's much better than nothing. I suppose I could ask @yjbanov to review it, but he's probably very busy, so I don't think that's a showstopper.\n. Great, thanks!\u200b\n. Looks good to me. (Wow, alpha48 already!)\n. Looks like this languished a bit. Could you please check this against the current TS version and update it to beta 0? Thanks!\n. LGTM\n. I'm going to merge this in, so I can update the chapter.\n. Other than the two small things I pointed out, this LGTM.\n. I've started working on this chapter, so I'm going to merge this and make the last couple of changes myself.\n. I've started working on this chapter, so I'm going to merge this and make the last couple of changes myself.\n. @kevmoo could you please take a look?\n. I don't think we should use the logging package. It's all hidden code (makes the example run, but isn't quoted on the page), so it doesn't matter what we use.\n. @kevmoo any feedback before I take this code?\n. @tomplusplus go ahead and make changes here. I'll merge them when you're ready, and then finish the docs.\n. Closing this, as I've incorporated the files and kevmoo's comments into #460.\n. To make a variable private, you just name it with an underscore prefix. But it seems weird to use a constructor to initialize a class variable. Is it really an instance variable?\n. Yep, that looks right. Dart style is to avoid abbreviations, so we'd probably use _element instead.\n. PS to Ward: Dart has no private/internal access modifiers. Just using _ makes the variable library-private.\n. Thanks, @wardbell.\n. Thanks, Kasper!\n. LGTM \n. This change looks amazing!!! I'll merge it now.\n. I can do the merge if you're happy enough with this.\n. OK, merging now...\n. @wardbell here's another copyedit, for you to review at your leisure. I'm now going to start converting the Dart version of the first chapter I edited (displaying-data).\n. @wardbell I'm going to start converting this to Dart. If we subsequently make any changes to the TS version before committing this, then I'll make them to the Dart version, as well.\n. @wardbell I'm going to start converting this to Dart. If we subsequently make any changes to the TS version before committing this, then I'll make them to the Dart version, as well.\n. @sandfordredlich this is ready for review (with special attention to the PENDING items).\n. @sandfordredlich this is ready for review (with special attention to the PENDING items).\n. About to merge... Thanks very much for the review, @matanlurey!\n. Bugs filed: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/6956, https://github.com/angular/angular.io/issues/825\n. I agree.\n. I agree.\n. Just to be clear, is it https://angular.io/docs/dart/latest/help.html that you're talking about?\n. Just to be clear, is it https://angular.io/docs/dart/latest/help.html that you're talking about?\n. About to merge this...\n. @andresaraujo I think it's better to keep everything in platform_directives.\nI don't know whether it's better to use COMMON_DIRECTIVES or CORE_DIRECTIVES & FORM_DIRECTIVES. @yjbanov?\n. This looks good to me, as far as I can tell. @sanfordredlich can you do a technical review? \n. @andresaraujo: You don't need to squash commits when you upload. I'll take care of that when I merge, and it'd be nice to be able to more easily see the diffs between versions.\n. LGTM! I'll merge this.\n. @sanfordredlich could you please take a look?\n. Taking a look now.\n. LGTM. I'll merge this soon.\n. Good work! I left a bunch of nitty comments, but I think the code is good. I'll ask @sanfordredlich to be the real technical reviewer.\n. LGTM! I'll wait for a real technical reviewer to have a look before merging this.\n. Taking a very belated look now...\n. @kasperpeulen could you please git rebase upstream/master, resolve any conflicts, and push? If that's not practical, I guess we should start a new PR.\nYou can rename your .jade files to *-NEW.jade to get around some of the conflicts. And just drop the _data.json changes.\n. Just FYI, I'm copying down the toh-1 code to submit in a separate PR.\n. Closing, now that all changes have gotten into merged PRs. Thank you, @kasperpeulen!\n. It looks like you haven't incorporated all the comments from #696, so I'll wait for another commit before taking a final look.\n. @sanfordredlich could you please do a technical review? I'm especially curious about the _tick() => new Future(() {}) code in heavy_loader_component.dart. (It's derived from the TS code, but using a Timer resulted in more complicated code, so I suggested new Future() as a way of kicking the event loop.)\n. I'm going to merge this PR, so we can point to this code from a placeholder page. We'll do a final technical review before I write & publish the real page.\n. We should update the JS & Dart versions to match. (Part of this PR? File issues so we don't forget?)\n. I'm going to merge this change but add a note about angular/angular#6498.\n. Wow, apparently I made too many changes to for GitHub to be able to show the diffs.\n@wardbell could you please try to take a look anyway? The Blame view would at least show which sections have a change.\nI guess in the future I should have multiple commits.\n. I've uploaded the changes to Rietveld, so you can actually see and comment on the diffs:\ntemplate-syntax.jade diffs\n. Changes are all in #772.\n. This is ready to ship. Any objections?\n. I ran into merge hell, so I've created a new PR: #772.\n. LGTM. I'll confirm that this still runs once you commit this change.\n. What are the \"latest\" bits? You might need to modify pubspec.yaml to specify that version of Angular.\n. I've saved my work on the Dart text here, but it's not ready for review yet.\n. Now it's ready for review, though not ready to be published. Please pay special attention to \"QUESTION:\" and \"Dart difference:\".\n. @wardbell you might want to check out how I did the includes. Do they look reasonable to you?\n. My approach seems pretty workable. I think this page was an extreme example, since it's so long, but it was pretty easy to know where I was when I needed to make a fix.\nI'm hoping to clear up the remaining questions within the next couple of days.\n. The TS version is ready to go, but the Dart content still needs review, so I've moved it to template-syntax-NEW.jade.\nI'm going to merge this PR, and I'll finish/publish the Dart version in a separate PR.\n. The draft Dart content is viewable at https://angular.io/docs/dart/latest/guide/template-syntax-NEW.html.\n. Thanks for the fix! I'll merge this now.\n. I'm going to commit these changes and, I hope, republish the site.\n. And... it's published.\n. @wardbell if you'd like to see the diffs between the final and original versions of the chapter, they're readable in https://codereview.appspot.com/282380043/diff/1/public/docs/ts/latest/guide/template-syntax.jade.\n. The fix for this is in PR #666, which has been languishing, waiting for review. I'll try harder to get a reviewer.\n. The changes are in and will be released the next time the site is published (within a few days). Thanks very much for your bug report, and please continue to file more bugs when you encounter doc problems!\n. @zoechi thanks for the review!\n@luisvt thanks for all the work you put in! The app now runs, but not quite completely \u2014 it throws exceptions (which you can see in the JS console). If you compare it to the plunkr, you can see that the \"Provider variations\" header is the last thing in the Dart version, while the JS version has a bunch of output after that. Also, the JS version has \"R.O.U.S.'s? I don't think they exist!\" at the end of the \"Other Injections\" section, but the Dart version doesn't (due to this exception, I assume:  EXCEPTION: Failed assertion: boolean expression must not be null in [{{rodent}} in InjectorComponent@3:19](program):1 (anonymous function)).\nAlso, don't worry too much about the text. I'm editing that, and it'll change so much I won't be able to accept your edits to the .jade file (though I will be happy to use them as a guide to what needs to change).\nI'll note a few things in the sample which either you or I could change:\n- We should add a lib/ directory and move the non-main files there.\n- Filenames should be underscore (_) separated, not dot-separated. E.g., web/providers.component.dart should be lib/providers_component.dart.\n- We should use single quotes, not double quotes, in the Dart code (and double quotes in HTML code). This is arbitrary, but I'd like the samples to be consistent.\n- Run the Dart style formatter on everything. Its formatting is not always ideal, but it fixes a lot of stuff that's hard to remember.\nAn example to follow would be https://github.com/angular/angular.io/tree/master/public/docs/_examples/displaying-data/dart.\n. Night is fine. Thank you, @luisvt!\n. One final thing (for tomorrow!): The UI still has the same problems it did before, with the same exceptions  and missing lines.\n. Yes, our convention is to use single quotes in Dart code only, and double quotes in HTML only.\n. The new version runs cleanly in checked mode. Woohoo! I'll take a look at the code now...\n. It's looking really good, @luisvt. I haven't finished looking, and I noticed some fixes to be made, but I might not finish the review until next Tuesday. (We're out Monday.) In the meantime, I'll just make a few comments, in case you have time to make updates.\n. LGTM! I'm going to merge this. (I'll revert the .jade file changes when I do.)\n. @thso is going to take a crack at the Dart version of the sample.\n. replaced by #827.\n. Also... be sure to explain COMMON_DIRECTIVES, CORE_DIRECTIVES, FORM_DIRECTIVES, etc.\n. @wardbell this is ready to review.\n. I'm going to merge this, but of course we can always change it in the future...\n. Thanks very much for the reviews, @zoechi & @thso. (@adaojunior, @thso is Thibault, the Google engineer I asked to review this.)\nHere's my feedback, most of which other reviewers have at least alluded to:\n- It runs, and its UI is the same as the TS version, yay!\n- We should delete .gitignore. (All this is handled by the top level .gitignore; the TS version needs the .gitignore to deal with build cruft, iirc, but they'd rather not have it.)\n- I think we should delete the LICENSE & README, since the other samples don't have them.\n- Make sure all functions have return types and that the types are OK when you run the app in Dartium in checked mode. E.g., in lib/wiki/wiki_component.dart, the search method should return Future<List<String>>, I think.\n- Make sure the import order in all files matches the standard that Thibault referred to.\n- Run dartfmt on all .dart files.\n- The \"then()\" in addHero surprised me.\nThanks very much for all your work, @adaojunior!\n. I'll merge this. Thanks, @adaojunior!\n. About to merge...\n. Once we get the content and look closer to done, we should do a copy edit. (I do like the general approach of hiding information that people don't necessarily need. We could use animation to make the reveal fun.)\n. Single switch seems fine, as long as you can see when you're missing out on a discussion. But if you can't... then you don't know what you're missing. I'd rather have a companion page than an all-or-nothing, see-it-or-don't switch.\nI suppose a companion page would be an interesting test. We could use analytics to see whether people ever go there...\n. Your changes LGTM.\n. Merging now, and then I'll publish.\n. Oops, thanks for pointing this out. I'll fix it asap.\n. I plan to push this as soon as I merge #879 and confirm that the page generates correctly.\n. @wardbell I'm going to merge this. I'd like to publish it tomorrow morning.\n. We have some no-return methods that aren't marked void. Should we say their return type is void? I'm thinking of delete() in [Big]HeroDetailComponent, and ng*Init() in AppComponent.\n. We'd talked about changing the ngSwitchWhen templates (in app_component.html) to not have the [...]. For example, we'd change this:\n<template [ngSwitchWhen]=\"'Eenie'\"><span>Eenie</span></template>\nto this:\n<template ngSwitchWhen=\"Eenie\"><span>Eenie</span></template>\nThe former works, but it's ugly.\n. @thso: Yes, please change it to <template ngSwitchWhen=\"Eenie\"><span>Eenie</span></template> is the upshot. (Right, @wardbell?)\n. LGTM. Thanks, @thso!\n. Does this point to the Dart sample when one exists? That's an additional link that's helpful to our devs.\n. LGTM\n. It's great to have a Dart glossary! There are still a few minor problems, but they shouldn't necessarily hold up this PR.\nProblems I noticed in the glossary:\n- 3 occurrences of \"decorator\" (should be \"annotation\" in Dart); we could just have a note that explains that, I suppose (I do try to explain differences from TS in the Dart docs)\n- In the #component section, links to Directive and decorator are 404s (true in the TS version, too; I suspect it's either a redirect on the server or the glossary has lots of bad links)\n. Thanks, @wardbell!\n. Looks good! I'll need to update the Dart quickstart's link to the developer guide (since it's no longer to the developer guide, technically). But that's not a big deal.\n. For some reason, I can't push to this branch any more. I'll create a new branch & PR.\n. For some reason, I can't push to this branch any more. I'll create a new branch & PR.\n. LGTM\n. Thanks, @luisvt, for the PR! It spurred me to finally publish the sample. I modified the code, to some extent, and added links to it.\n. @thso & @wardbell, I've incorporated more feedback. The remaining work depends on sample changes.\n. @wardbell: This might be done, but I'm going to take another look tomorrow before committing it.\n. About to merge...\n. I got this error yesterday with a brand new, clean angular.io repo, and I suspect my setup is very close to Naomi's.\nI'm using the command gulp check-deploy. I'm not sure which version of harp I'm using. There's one apparently installed by homebrew, but another copy under angular.io in node_modules/harp/bin. I'd hope that the gulp command would use the latter.\nbin (master)$ harp --version\n/.../homebrew/lib/node_modules/harp/node_modules/terraform/node_modules/node-sass/lib/extensions.js:146\n    throw new Error('`libsass` bindings not found. Try reinstalling `node-sass`?');\n...\nbin (master)$ pwd\n/Users/.../angular.io-CLEAN/node_modules/harp/bin\nbin (master)$ ./harp --version\n0.20.1\n. Good to hear! I'm unable to deploy angular.io (at least, using my normal workflow) until the fix is in.\n. I was able to deploy angular.io. Many thanks, @jvandemo!\n. Looks good! Did you view the built version in a browser?\n. Sorry, I dropped the ball on this. I'll try to take another look today.\n. Closing, per Patrice's comments, but as always thanks very much for your work, @luisvt!\n. Closing, per Patrice's comments, but as always thanks very much for your work, @luisvt!\n. Looks lovely. Merging!\n. @Foxandxss I'll make sure the Dart version is updated when this goes in.\nThe cheatsheet is generated from files under https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/master/modules/angular2/docs/cheatsheet. It looks like most of those haven't been updated for months, so don't count on it happening magically!\n. All I needed was your OK. I'll take care of merging.\n. Merging...\n. Fix a problem reported by @montyr75\n. Committing...\n. Merging now...\n. I'm going to merge this.\n. I'm going to commit this now.\n. Merging...\n. In general, I'd like to stay on the Dart docs unless I explicitly go to the TS docs. That means once I've gone to docs under docs/dart, I'd expect the drop-down list to default to Dart until I explicitly go to a docs/ts or docs/js page.\n. I'm going to merge these now.\n. I have the same 100% CPU problem on my Mac (OS X El Capitan, 10.11.4, 16GB memory). I usually do gulp serve-and-sync-devguide.\n$ node --version\nv4.2.1\n. Merging now...\n. Just getting started on this review...\n@chalin did you run gulp check-deploy yet?\n. LGTM. Great job! (It hurt to ignore the \"it's\" that should be \"its\", but another time...)\nI'll run gulp check-deploy.\n. @thso you want to try merging this?\n. Closing per @chalin's comment.\n. @chalin it looks like the end of your message is gone. Could you add the missing text?\n. @chalin it looks like the end of your message is gone. Could you add the missing text?\n. Line numbers in excerpts make sense to me only if they reflect the actual line numbers in the file. Otherwise, I think it's very confusing.\nTo me, line numbers seem relevant if you're actually referencing them in the text. Otherwise, they just take up space.\n. @wardbell do you want me to make the section descriptions match what's really there?\n. About to merge...\n. I've made Patrice's suggested edit, plus rearranged a bit to feature dart_to_js_script_rewriter. And a few misc. copy edits. I'm planning to submit, as it'd be hard to judge the changes without actually building the docs.\n. LGTM. @wardbell do you have an opinion? I wonder if the name makeExample1 could be clearer. makeExample2? makeSimpleExample?\n. OK, I'll merge a little later this morning. Thanks, Patrice!\n. Thanks, Patrice. I'll commit this and create an issue so we don't forget to make these fixes.\n. cc @naomiblack\n. I'll take a look. @wardbell, do you also want to review this?\n. LGTM! I'll squash and merge.\n. LGTM! Merging now.\n. Taking a look now...\n. LGTM, once you fix the minor problems I noted.\n. LGTM\n. I see \"no changes\" to those 4 files, for some reason.\n. I'm not sure what the protocol is when the CI build fails... @naomiblack? @wardbell?\n. Cool, merging now...\n. LGTM\ncc @wardbell \n. Looks great! The only real problem I saw was the \"key benefits of defining a configuration object class\" paragraph, which needs to be clarified and probably broken up.\n. @Foxandxss & @wardbell: I don't know the TS side, so you still might want to take a look to make sure the new text is OK by you...\n. I had a couple more quibbles about the cascade wording, but otherwise LGTM.\n. LGTM. I'll merge this unless someone screams NO...\n. LGTM\n. Before pushing this, we need to do a few things:\n- [ ] Make sure the issue search uses the right labels (probably 'api' & 'dart': https://github.com/angular/angular.io/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aapi+label%3Adart)\n- [ ] Add known issues to the database.\n- [ ] Add text to each page linking to known issues.\n- [ ] Either add Dart examples everywhere or change the text to NOT imply that we have them everywhere.\n- [ ] Make sure the output is useful (which maybe it will be once Dart examples are everywhere?). I didn't realize that all the generated entries in the docs are directly from TS, not from generated Dart. \n- [ ] Be more specific in the caveat about how TypeScripty the docs are. Perhaps create a page telling people how to figure out what the API actually is? E.g., how do you find out all the args to bootstrap()? Array -> List, string -> String, boolean -> bool etc. Consider pointing people to both the angular.io and dartdocs.org docs? E.g. https://www.dartdocs.org/documentation/angular2/latest/angular2.common/Control-class.html seems to have correct type info except in methods, which lack types (it also shows lots of inherited properties); http://localhost:3000/docs/dart/latest/api/common/index/Control-class.html is much shorter and/but has little useful information except the text.\n. I like the new links.\n. I took a quick look; @chalin will take a closer one.\n. I got distracted trying to make my doc build work. It's still broken, but I won't let that hold up this PR.\n. This seems safe enough. Any objections to my merging it, @wardbell or @Foxandxss?\n. I didn't try building it, but it LGTM. (More examples, yay!)\n. I'm going to merge this now.\n. cc @chalin \n. Thanks!\n. LGTM. Merging now...\n. LGTM\n. There's also the fact that most people don't use Stagehand from the command line\u2014they get its functionality for free when they use an IDE like WebStorm.\nIt might be nice to have all the text in one file, letting the user choose which approach they want to take. That way the user has one place to go, and they can see how their choice (vanilla/CLI/WS) affects the process.\n. Taking a look now...\n. LGTM. Merging now.\n. LGTM, though we should fix that snake_case link.\n. I can't get the link to work in my build, but then building anything more than the devguide fails for me right now. I'll take your word that it works.\n. The changes look good, with the exception of what I commented on. (This page needs a good copy edit, but I tried to avoid looking at anything you didn't change!)\n. LGTM. Merging now...\n. I'm taking a look now...\n. LGTM\n@thso LGTY?\n. Merging now...\n. I just ran a link checker and got a ton of output on (almost?) every page because of the missing icons.

The copyedits look reasonable to me, but I'll leave the content review to the TS experts.\n. Any objections to me merging this change? @Foxandxss?\n. I didn't try following the steps, but this looks fine. I like how you simplified it (caveat: I didn't try to really understand either version). I had a few comments/questions...\n. LGTM, but @thso should take a look.\n. fwiw, I just used this script, and now my repo is the happiest it's been in weeks (I'm able to deploy the docs again).\n. LGTM, but I didn't try to run the example or build-and-compare the Dart page. Would you like me to do either of those, @chalin?\n. LGTM.\n. LGTM aside from wondering whether a null comment will break this.\n. LGTM.\n. LGTM\n. LGTM\n. Looking good! Once you address a few comments, the Dart side is good to go.\n. LGTM! @Foxandxss or @wardbell, who's going to review the TS side?\n. I've staged this here: https://kw-angular-io.firebaseapp.com/docs/dart/latest/guide/security.html\n. I did a side-by-side comparison, and apart from the couple of minor things I commented on, LGTM.\n. LGTM\n. Taking a look... First impression: nice!\nThe second thing I noticed is the lack of a language dropdown at /docs/dart/latest/api/ (or any page under it). Would it be possible to add it? (And add some reasonable behavior in the likely case that there's no equivalent page at the dart -> ts/js version of the URL.)\nIf a dropdown isn't practical, we should put \"Dart\" in that space, so it's easier to tell that you're in the Dart version of the API docs.\n. LGTM.\n. @filipesilva @Foxandxss @wardbell @naomiblack: Unless you object, I plan to merge this after confirming that I can, indeed, generate the docs. 2 pm Pacific time is my goal.\n. LGTM\n. LGTM\n. I merged because I heard (elsewhere) that Ward's good with this.\n. cc @chalin \n. @chalin: My first thought is that we might want to cover this in the guide somewhere, and then refer to that coverage in the API reference docs. What do you think?\n. Talking with an engineer today, he suggested that # mode should perhaps be the default for Dart.\n. Actually, our new style is going to have Title Case only for page names, and Sentence case for section names.\nI'm going to close this PR, but I look forward to seeing more from you!\n. @chalin, please handle this. (I can't assign to you.)\n. LGTM. I plan to push the site after checking my build.\n. LGTM\n. LGTM\n. I should finish taking a look, but in the meantime, please see my comments on https://github.com/angular/angular.io/commit/d0811714d54cda1882f8287e095bf182ce39421d.\n. Closing this PR since we have no CLA.\n. The doc builds, but I don't see a difference in the output, compared to what's on angular.io. What should I look at/for?\n. Ah, OK. So those files are still being generated, but they aren't being linked to. Good. (Or at least better, if still not perfect.)\nE.g., locally, I can still see http://localhost:8080/docs/dart/latest/api/angular2/PipeMetadata-class.html, but I guess it isn't linked to?\n. @wardbell or @Foxandxss does the code look good to you?\n. LGTM\n(That's google-speak for looks good to me.)\n. Closing this PR since we have no CLA.\n. I'm going to close this PR since we have no CLA.\n. I like most of your edits very much!\n. Sorry for the delay. Taking another look now...\n. OK, all done. Could you make the final changes and resolve any conflicts? Thanks!\n. Last I heard, CI was in early days and failing it wasn't a showstopper.\nSo don't worry about it. :) I'll look at your changes now.\n. LGTM aside from one tiny character, which I can fix.\nThanks very much for your work, @pfryerda!\n. I'll merge this now unless someone screams...\n. LGTM. Merging now.\n. Some minor issues, but otherwise looks great!\n. LGTM\n. @chalin, could you please take a look?\n@ben4ever, thanks for the report!\n. Interestingly, the , will soon be legal. \nIn this case, you're telling the reader to add something, so it'd be a little weird to have ... in there.\nCould you work around this, somehow, @chalin?\n. We don't want to imply that the type name is ActivatedRoutes, so this change won't work, as is.\nBut you're right that \"ActivatedRoutes\" is not great.\nHow about \"ActivatedRoute objects\"?\n. I can fix the changelog link. @chalin, what's your plan for beta.19?\n. SGTM. Updating to a new version is quite a production, even when there are no API changes.\n. I've fixed the changelog link in #2025.\n. This capability would also help if we decide that generating the dartdocs on Linux is necessary.\n. @chalin: OK change by you?\n. I'm going to merge this, but we should fix the text in the *-deprecated pages soon.\n. LGTM. Merging now.\n. @filipesilva could you review this?\n. Thanks, Filipe! Merging now...\n. @wardbell I plan to merge this as soon as I've confirmed that check-deploy is happy. OK by you?\n. LGTM, but @wardbell or @Foxandxss should review the script.\n. LGTM, but an engineer should review the changes, if possible.\n@thso @matanlurey\n. We didn't get the engineer review, but the changes work and LGTM, so I'm merging.\n. LGTM. Merging now...\n. LGTM. Thank you!\n. Could you please resolve the conflicts?\n. Thanks!\n. LGTM. Thanks!\n. LGTM\n. LGTM.\n. Comparing http://localhost:3000/docs/dart/latest/quickstart.html & https://angular.io/docs/dart/latest/quickstart.html side-by-side, I see an extra paragraph in the new one (the circled <my-app> in the screenshot).\n\n. Aside from that one thing, which you could fix later, LGTM.\n. Merging now...\n. LGTM (both TS & Dart)\n. Works for me!\n. LGTM. Merging...\n. LGTM. Any objection to my merging it, @wardbell & @Foxandxss?\n. LGTM. I compared the old & new Dart versions side-by-side, and the few diffs I noticed were improvements. Ditto for the old & new TypeScript versions.\n. LGTM\n. Aside from what I marked, LGTM. \n. Actually, I wanted this change in before the editor looks at it. Pushing the updated site now...\n. LGTM!\n. Aside from the one wording thing I noticed (which isn't a showstopper) LGTM.\n. Does @Foxandxss need to review this, or can I merge?\n. LGTM\n. LGTM\n. LGTM\n. LGTM\n. LGTM\n. LGTM\n. So much faster!\nThere's one issue with the output, though: The \"Deploy to Firebase? (y/n):\" question is obscured by the 3 new lines of \"Rename\" output. Could you move those lines to be before the deploy prompt? Here's what I see:\n...\n[10:11:29] compile ok\n[10:11:29] running live server ...\nprompt: Deploy to Firebase?

The newest version works great for me! OK if I merge this, @wardbell & @Foxandxss?\n. LGTM.\n. I'll deploy ASAP. (Which might be tomorrow, but I'll try for sooner.)\n. And... it's deployed.\n. LGTM. Merging.\n. LGTM\n. LGTM\n. Yikes, this touches lots of files! I'll take a look ASAP so things don't get clobbered.\n. Generally looks good, but I found a few issues.\n. LGTM once you fix the \"re introducing\" thing.\n. OK, done looking.\n. LGTM, once you fix OrderBy and /. (We could do more, but perhaps we shouldn't. :)\n. LGTM.\n. LGTM. It'd be nice if I could generate the Dart docs into a shared place, so that I'm the only one who has to generate those docs...\n. LGTM. Merging...\n. LGTM\n. Thanks for the PR, @ben4ever!\n@chalin OK by you?\n. Let's have Patrice make the text changes, since he's rolling through a bunch of those.\n. LGTM\n. The changes you've made look good, but there are many more changes you could make\u2014especially ones that came up in reviews of previous pages you worked on. I marked a few things, but I wasn't too thorough this time.\nIf you could refer to the checklist (and, better yet, improve the checklist) each time you edit a doc, I think that'd improve the quality of the docs.\n. Looks great! I found a few more capitalization/hyphenation things, but once you fix those, LGTM. \n. LGTM once you resolve the conflicts.\n. LGTM once you resolve the conflicts.\n. LGTM\n. LGTM\n. From @matanlurey on August 19, 2016 1:56\nThis is WAI, BrowserClient is not an @Injectable(). I agree the error is confusing, but:\n- We will be deprecating the reflective mode.\n- This is WAI for non-annotated classes.\n. From @sturmf on September 10, 2016 6:40\nThis is marked as wontfix but the heroes tutorial still points to this issue.\nhttps://angular.io/docs/dart/latest/tutorial/toh-pt6.html\nSo how should one proceed. Keep the original code?\n. @chalin could you please update the tutorial and NOT point to this issue?\n. I was probably too picky, but in general this looks good.\n. The results look great. Does anyone want to review the actual code, @wardbell?\n. I'm going to merge, but I need to talk with @naomiblack before deploying... That should happen within the hour.\n. LGTM. Thanks!\n. LGTM. Let me know when it's safe to merge this.\n. Still LGTM. OK to merge once Travis passes?\n. It looks like #2750 was merged, so once you resolve the conflicts, I'll merge this.\n. Staged at https://kw-angular-io.firebaseapp.com/dart.\nSome notes from poking around:\n- In https://kw-angular-io.firebaseapp.com/docs/dart/latest/guide/dependency-injection.html:\n  - Link to InjectableMetadata goes to TS... and is a 404: https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/core/index/InjectableMetadata-class.html\n    (InjectableMetadata no longer exists in Dart)\n  - (On the other hand, the link to \"Provider class\" does work; but it did before, too.)\n- In https://kw-angular-io.firebaseapp.com/docs/dart/latest/guide/template-syntax.html:\n  - All links work!\n  - Links to viewChild and contentChild should be ViewChild and ContentChild in the text.\nI ran the script, and it seemed to work although it didn't catch the bad API link in dependency-injection.html.\nAnyway, this is an improvement and doesn't break anything. LGTM.\n. LGTM. Thanks for the fix!\n. Could we have a travis or other test that finds \"BAD FILENAME\" occurrences, so we at least know about them before pushing the site?\n. LGTM\n. LGTM. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. @juleskremer is this fixed in the new site?. @jwren might have an opinion on whether writing around this is the best/only approach.. How does the second commit change the visible formatting? Also, does webdev handle this OK?. This reminds me... We need to update https://github.com/angular/dart-doc-syncer (and the README.md files that it produces).\nhttps://github.com/angular/dart-doc-syncer/issues/21. LGTM. Thanks, Kapunahele!. I'm checking with Natalie about what we should use instead of \"browser: any\", since \"any\" is now discouraged.\n. It's not very noticeable on my screen, but I wanted to highlight the text they should enter, without using the pink highlight I used in code.\n. It's slower, though. I personally would use WebStorm to run it in Dartium.\n. Yep, they do, although they don't have to wait for the build if you're using Dartium.\n. I decided to go with ^0.10.0+2. We could probably go with an earlier version, but I figured it wouldn't matter too much right now... and I didn't want to test earlier versions.\n. boostrap -> bootstrap\n. pull -> pulls\n. and -> and the\n. ). -> .)\n. Ah, so I should remove the angular2.dart import from all the web/main.dart files that don't use @Component (or any other annotation). That affects every example except for the very first ones (getting started & quickstart). I blame WebStorm. It didn't mark the import as unused. :)\n. The ../web seems suspect. @kevmoo, how should it be done?\n. delete this.\n. @kevmoo, shouldn't this file be under lib?\n. @yjbanov should we be using show in our imports? (That's not Dart style, but it seemed to be Angular style. Do we need to comply?)\n. Could this be just => JSON.encode(this)? See the library tour's dart:convert coverage for details.\n. Never mind, this isn't a Map.\n. Remove this line. (If we kept it, it would be \"print\" instead of window.console.log().)\n. I think you can drop the @View and just specify the template in the @Component.\n. I think you can drop @View and put the template in @Component.\n. Yep, it started out with @View being required, but now @View shouldn't be required unless you have multiple views (which might not even be possible yet).\n. I'll fix forms, but do please fix pipes. Thanks!\n. I only used line numbers when it was code I wanted them to actually type in.\n(Come to think of it, that's part of the reason why I was keeping so many copies of the app around\u2014so I'd know the line numbers for each sample. Of course, with #docregion you still have to do some subtracting to get the real line # that they'd see.)\n. When it's a fragment I specify line #s that don't start at 1 (assuming that I do it right, and that the fragment isn't from the beginning of the file).\n. To be clear, I'm not opposed to \" (excerpt)\". I just happened to convey the info another way, and I didn't think of changing the text at the top.\n. I like the result. Thanks!\n. Added \" (excerpt)\" to all titles of incomplete files. I'll need to take a closer look before I remove the line #s. (I think that having line #s start at 1 is misleading for excerpts that aren't at the start of the file.)\n. I like it. Done.\n. It doesn't work in Dart in alpha46. @vsavkin is apparently working on it. I'll leave a note to remove this.\n. I like it. Done.\n(Do we really need to capitalize Property Binding and Event Binding? I saw some places where it wasn't capitalized... and I liked that.)\n. Better. Done.\n. The toString() method that I added to Hero produces this output. It's a custom string. Overriding toString() is a really common thing to do in Dart. The alternative (which we originally did) was to add and call a toJson() method, which was fine but produced output that's less readable and less Dart-y. It didn't seem like JSON was important here\u2014just easy to produce\u2014so I used the string instead.\n. I like this better (although I changed display to look because display like this sounded weird to me; display something like this might be more correct, but then it's getting wordy).\n. Done.\n. Done\n. I do like it better, although I worry that \"focus\" could be misconstrued as setting the place where keyboard input goes. How about:\nNow run the app, and look at the Name input box.\n  Follow the next four steps precisely:\nAlso... do we need to italicize UI names? I was relying on capitalization alone to set them apart. (I once had feedback that many people have trouble reading italics, so I avoid them whenever possible. People seem to read boldface more easily, but I try to use it sparingly since it attracts so much attention.)\n. After trying this out, I think we don't need both the image and the animation, but I'm not sure which to drop. (Animation could be annoying; images take up more space.) One option is to do the following, so that people who can't see the animation/image for some reason (maybe they're blind or have processing issues) can get the info:\n```\n  Now run the app, and look at the Name input box.\n  Follow the next four steps precisely:\n\nLook but don't touch.\nClick inside the name box, then click outside it.\nAdd slashes to the end of the name.\nErase the name.\n\nThe classes are displayed as follows:\n\nform-control ng-untouched ng-pristine ng-valid (initial state)\nform-control ng-pristine ng-valid ng-touched (after clicking)\nform-control ng-valid ng-touched ng-dirty (after changing)\nform-control ng-touched ng-dirty ng-invalid (after erasing)\n\nfigure.image-display\n  img(src=\"/resources/images/devguide/forms/control-state-transitions-anim.gif\"  alt=\"Control State Transition\")\n``\n. I did this even before looking at this note! However... I have a few minor differences in bolding and capitalization. You'll see them when I post my changes...\n. I never bothered with#enddocregionsince the EOF is implicitly the end. Does the original have this comment? (Just curious; I don't think it matters.)\n. FYI: Soon, apparently, we won't need to declare these built-in directives. But not yet. (I think it works in TS as of 46 but not yet Dart, even as of 47.)\n. Nice. I just did some similar multiple-version work on the Forms example, but I just created copies of the HTML file and didn't make it easy to switch between them. I like this v1/v2/v3/v4 approach. I suppose the only downside is when, even when the HTML is the only thing that changes, you'd have to create extra Dart files to go along with them.\n. Dart usually avoids abbreviations in names. @kevmoo do you think it matters here?\n. I see _Color.Red used below. Is that what @kevmoo was referring to?\n. @kevmoo: ping\n. Wait, this is where _Color is used!\n.this.shouldn't be necessary.\n. deletethis.?\n.this.idshould be justid`\n. littleHero -> little_hero\nWe use _ separation, not camelCase, for library names. \n. 47 now :)\n. Sorry, I should've been more specific. v1, v2, etc. seemed fine to me, since v is a very common abbreviation.\nIt's Ctor that we don't usually see in Dart. Maybe we should change it to \"Creator\" or something other than \"Constructor\"? I don't want it confused with a Dart constructor.\n. About the only time I use this is in constructor arguments, where they're\nsyntactic sugar that lets you avoid putting this.a = a in the body.\n. Does this really require a string in a string (\"'violet'\")? That's kind of gross!\n. async -> defer\nin these two lines.\n. No directives field is necessary? (I'm comparing this to https://github.com/tomplusplus/angular.io/blob/DeveloperGuides/intro/public/docs/_examples/intro/ts/src/app/hero-detail.component.ts)\n. Although, to be honest, this looks correct and the ts version looks weird to me.\n. The ts version has #docregion ng-model here\n. The #docregions are different in the ts version. I'm going to stop marking this, but it'd be great if this version had the same #docregions as the ts version.\n. We usually do 2-space indents, which is what the ts version uses.\n. Be sure to run the formatter on this (and all the other .dart files). I'm pretty sure there should be a space after the comma.\n. I think there should be space before the { (but the formatter would know for sure).\n. Shouldn't Logger and BackendService be provided using arguments to the constructor, as in the ts version? So:\nHeroService(Logger this._logger, BackendService this._backendService) {}\n. Usually we'd have a return type, although it's not required. So:\nList<Hero> getHeroes() {\n  ...\n}\n. Usually we wouldn't have a type here. We'd just have:\nreturn _backendService.getAll();\n(Does this code even run?)\n. I wonder if we could/should use https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/logging here. @kevmoo?\n. It looks like you could just use print() instead. Also, we don't usually use dynamic in signatures. Object would do.\nvoid log(Object msg) {\n  print(msg);\n}\n. Another possibility (although some people object to using => with methods that return void):\nlog(msg) => print(msg);\nOR\nvoid log(Object msg) => print(msg);\n. Ah, now I see why you used window.console.log() above. Oh well.\n. 47 -> 48\n. Use 2-space indents and as few diffs from the ts version as possible.\n. Could you use newHero?.value?.length > 0 here?\n. 2-space indent\n. It looks like that source code isn't in the page. I suspect the Logger is just an example of a Service. We can leave it as-is, I think.\n. heroForm -> hf\n(assuming you aren't changing the image filename; if you are, then we'll need to change it in the dart version of this file)\n. heroForm -> hf\n. heroForm -> hf\n. Good catch! I'd rather solve it the other way:\nIn addition to providing full support for ES5, TypeScript, and Dart, Angular 2 works equally well with ES6 and other languages that\n. I took it out because the \"Next Steps\" section doesn't look right with the auto-generated \"Next Step\" section. Many other possibilities could work...\n. The mix of past/conditional and present tense (were...omits...is) was what I was mainly trying to fix. The relationship of the message to the paragraph/Angular was also a bit unclear. (The next sentence does address that, iirc, but better to be clearer from the start.) You can probably think of a better solution, though.\n. @yjbanov what would you recommend?\n. You can delete this file, I think. (angular.io has its own .gitignore.)\n. We should use package: imports for libs within the same package. (Now that we're recommending not using the library directive, I believe it's important not to use relative imports.)\n. Ditto about using package: imports. I'll stop remarking on this, but it applies globally.\n. I didn't realize we were on beta.1!\n. There's a risk of importing the same library multiple times, iirc.\n. You can delete this file, since angular2 has its own .gitignore.\n. We haven't specified this in other pubspecs. I've been following the Forms example for the pubspec contents.\n. We haven't specified this in other pubspecs. Do you think we should?\n. src/common/directives.dart -> common.dart\n. We use a 2-space indent (for both Dart & HTML).\n. Did the formatter put @Input() on the same line (or care, either way)? I'm used to seeing annotations on their own lines.\n. Use package: imports, even for files within this package.\n. I'm curious why you used heroes.elementAt(0) instead of heroes[0]. heroes?.elementAt(0) would make more sense to me...\n. We should use 2-space indent\n. I think this filename should probably be structural_directives_component.html, to match the Dart file (not the TS equivalent).\n. delete the this.\n. ditto\n. I had no idea what the () {} meant! But I finally figured it out. :)\nYou've run dartfmt, right? Just checking, since I have no idea how this should be spaced.\n. I suppose I never noticed because I don't normally see dotfiles. I'll check in the angular author channel.\n. That's just the Dart equivalent of the TS code, which I assume is just to kick the event loop. I have no real knowledge of how it works, and it's possible that without a return value it might be optimized away.\n@adaojunior: Does the app behave differently when you comment out this line?\n. Just to confirm, we decided to add sdk and dart_to_js_script_rewriter to all pubspecs.\n. Good question. How about \"browser event loop\"? We should perhaps make this change to the JS/TS samples, too.\n. Good point.\n. el -> element, right?\n. The transformer docs I found (https://github.com/angular/angular/wiki/Angular-2-Dart-Transformer) don't have any info on platform_directives, so I'll file bugs to update those docs and to either make these docs point there or add docs here about the transformer.\n. Yes, it looks like the class should implement/extend OldLogger. When I run the app, I see this exception (which, though not about NewLogger, is for a similar case):\nORIGINAL EXCEPTION: type 'EvenBetterLogger' is not a subtype of type 'Logger' of 'logger'.(program):1 (anonymous function)\n. Return type should be String, shouldn't it?\n. I think you could shorten the returned string to:\n'$description car with ${engine.cylinders} cylinders and ${tires.make} tires.'\nYou might still need to split it over 2 or 3 lines, though. I think dartfmt will do this for you.\n. should have a return type, shouldn't it?\n. Similarly, this should have a return type of Car.\n. should have a return type of Car\n. All the methods should have a return type.\n. Oh, this string is closer to what I recommended above! But ${description} can be just $description, and we can delete the space before tires.make.\n. I wonder whether Dart factory constructors might be a Dartier way to do this. @zoechi?\n. Or maybe they share a name but aren't really applicable here...\n. I'm not used to seeing cascades all on one line. Did dartfmt leave it that way?\n. Yes, please. In fact, be sure to always run dartfmt before uploading your changes.\n. @zoechi Could we easily change this to be closer to package:test APIs?\n. Add a description above the version. Maybe:\ndescription: Dependency injection sample\n. 3 -> 6\n. This is a real test, not a simulation, right? So how about these comments instead:\n// A simple test\n// More details will be in the testing chapter.\n. browser -> vm\n(It's totally cool that this test can run on the command line! It makes the test much faster!)\n. I expected something more like this:\nexpect(hlc.heroes.length, equals(expectedHeroes.length));\nDoes the previous version really work for you?\n. We need to revert the changes to this file (though I'll definitely use your diffs to guide my changes).\n. It looked wrong to me with spaces before & after, but (upon further research) it's not.\nIn general, I usually use ellipses in very informal communication, and em dashes in docs. (I think ellipses sound wishy washy, which I am IRL but not when I write tech docs. :) But I'm fine with using ellipsis here, with whatever spacing you like.\nI'll undo this change.\n. In all the pages I looked at before, we were using this title to specify the filename and whether it's an excerpt or a specific version.\nIt seemed weird to have a different convention here.\n. Your suggestion is better.\n. I like to use CAPITAL LETTERS in bad code comments. :) Because you can't shout loudly enough that this is BAD CODE.\n. Ah, cool. The test didn't work for other reasons, but by the time I figured out what was broken about the test I'd already changed this code.\n. This \"why\" needs to be preceded by an action. Maybe:\nLet's create a super simple Angular component.\n[WHY]\n. This is a really long \"WHY\" segment. Also, it's unclear what \"WHY\" refers to. Maybe split it up into a few WHYs, and make sure that the most important stuff is always visible. For example:\nAt the top of the file, you import the Component class.\n[WHY]\nNext, you create a class that has an @Component decorator.\n[WHY]\nThe @Component decorator specifies a selector\u2014the name of the HTML tag you'll use (<my-app>).\n[WHY]\n...\n. I have no taste, but I've heard from people with taste that italics with boldface is a design no-no. Also, I've heard from real live readers who have trouble reading italics, so I tend to avoid them (italics, not readers).\n. The comma makes it easier to avoid having to reread the sentence, due to incorrectly combining the \"and\" with one of the two phrases that come before it.\nIt generates metadata for any class [that has a decorator and for any decorator]... no wait!\nIt generates metadata for any class that has [a decorator and any decorator]... no!\nIt generates metadata for any class that has a decorator, and any decorator will do. (harder to misread that!)\n. Is it really that important to have different fonts in headers?\nMost places I've worked, we use only plain old bold font in headers (no code font, italics, or other special cases). Some of that might have been due to tool limitations, but it might have been a purely esthetic decision.\nIn this particular case, the @ and the capital I make this unmistakably a decorator. And I tend to thing of italics as variables (e.g. cp file1 file2).\nAll that said, I don't care too strongly about this. It's my knee-jerk reaction to avoid italics in headings and question them elsewhere... but I can control my knee.\n. Looking around in template-syntax.jade, it appears that ../api/ -> /docs/ts/latest/api/.\n. But it's not a derived or different class. It's just two different ways of calling the same constructor.\nEither way, I don't see how the title helps you grasp the difference. Maybe if I highlighted the constructor call, that would be more helpful.\n. I'm adding a tiny bit of explanation, since not having one distracted me.\n. It works to have a line break here? (I never tried it)\n. Do you think we should have @override here? And for deleteRequest, heroImageUrl, and maybe delete?\n. htm -> html\n. We don't plan to provide this for Dart. OK to delete it?\n. Again, we don't plan to provide this in Dart.\n. I don't think this is relevant to Dart. Would removing it cause problems with other testing chapters? If so, maybe we should remove all of Testing from the Dart version, for now.\n. It's a little weird to have the cheat sheet in two places in the sidenav. I can't think of a better solution, though.\n. I didn't notice that. You're right, \" is better.\n. I missed that recommendation. Can you tell me more about it? When talking to an internal engineer who uses Angular (but isn't on the Angular team), it seemed to us that angular2.dart was better because you wouldn't have to think twice about which files to include. (And tree shaking would make it not matter if you included more than you needed.)\n. True. Thanks for catching that.\n. I'll check, but I believe we're just following the original TypeScript example here.\nWe follow Dart conventions where possible (e.g. using types for APIs), while trying to keep the code similar (e.g. names).\n. Done (like the others)\n. @zoechi would you be willing to do a CL with your suggested fixes in it?\n. That does help, thanks.\n. Please replace this with a link to the Dart source, as in the Template Syntax page.\n. decorator -> attribute (global)\n. call the ... decorator function -> use the ... annotation\n.  I just published a wiki page in this repo where you should be able to find that info: Converting Pages to Dart\n. Oops, this isn't actually true, so I'll need to fix it. (Dart uses lower_with_underscores, which has no cool name that I know of.)\nYou can either drop this file from this PR, or I'll wait for it to clear and fix the file later.\n. Yeah, I just saw that. :) snake_case. Cool.\n. I know what you mean, but it's pretty standard to not include the (). (E.g. https://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/ch03.html refers to \"a @MirrorsUsed annotation\". Then again, https://www.dartlang.org/articles/reflection-with-mirrors/ just says \"MirrorsUsed annotation\".\nI'll keep an eye out for whether people are confused by this. I like the clue that @ provides, but resisted putting more characters after the classname...\n. Oops, I thought I'd caught all the \"decorat*\"s. (It's on my list of common differences.)\nGood catch.\n. That's not the name we've used in Dart, but I can live with it.\n(For the curious: The Dart spec & language tour tend to avoid using a name for it, although the language tour does once call it conditional member access.)\n. It's the \"live link\" vs. \"sample repo\" difference. I could've made it a variable and probably should.\n. It actually is in the TS & JS pages, but they have an all-plunkr solution where they can change the example. So the text needs to be different.\n. I hadn't realized you could start multiple docregions with one comment!\n. Http -> HTTP?\n. This link doesn't work in the Dart version. It goes to: http://localhost:3000/docs/dart/latest/guide/!%7B_httpUrl%7D\n. We should change the \"s to 's in Dart files, for consistency.\n. This results in a lot of \"BrowserClient client\" occurrences in the page, which is awkward but OK for now.\n. It's good to change the original sentence, since it was imprecise, but the new version is rather run-on. How about:\nOur Angular application manages what the user sees and can do, achieving this through the...\n. Add a blank line above this, so people are less likely to miss the context for the list.\n(It originally had this blank line, but sometime before your changes the blank line disappeared.)\n. Why leave out Date?\nIf there's a good reason to leave it out, change _a to _an.\n. camcel -> camel\nOr maybe camel case -> camelCase? (What do we use elsewhere?)\n. I'm not sure this applies to Dart. (Maybe it does. But I think I left it out for a reason...)\n. Why leave out DateTime & Map?\n. Or we could just use \"list\" everywhere, since that's easy now. We'd still want to call out that difference somewhere (perhaps in this chapter), but maybe we don't need to say \"array\" anywhere else in the Dart docs.\n. __chaining_op is inconsistent between the TS & Dart versions. TS says the full name with the op in parentheses, while Dart just says the op name.\n. I guess this is what we need for now, but once https://github.com/dart-lang/api.dartlang.org/issues/62 is fixed let's update this link!\n. An expression plus a ; is a statement, to be precise. The reverse isn't true.\nI don't think you could legitimately have , chaining in any context other than a for loop, so I'm excluding it from consideration. :)\nBut niggling precision aside... I think my comment was referring to the 4th line, which doesn't exist in the online version. \n. Actually, it did refer to the 3rd line. For some reason, I didn't have \"chaining expressions with ;\" in the old version of the Dart TS page.\n. Should this comment really be visible? Also, it doesn't reflect test_component.dart.\n. APP_CONFIG seems like an un-Darty name. (But if it's mentioned in text, it'd be easier to leave this capitalization.)\n. Remove the \",\" after \"classes\" while you're in here. (It's a restrictive phrase, not a parenthetical one.) Or delete the \"the\" before \"very\" and keep the comma; that way the phrase becomes parenthetical.\n. \"study\" sounds so serious. Also, \"which\" (when introducing a phrase/clause) should have a comma before it; if a comma doesn't seem right, then you should probably be using \"that\" instead.\n` which we will study later on\n->\n`, which we'll see later\n. Remove the link from the second occurrence of InjectableMetadata.\n. The blank line above the getter seems excessive. Is it standard? (It could be; I don't happen to know, and I don't see anything definitive in Effective Dart.)\n. This sounds very formal. Also, we should mention @Optional() in the text, not just in the code. Maybe:\nWe can tell Angular that the dependency is optional by annotating the constructor argument with @Optional():\n. Instead of 2nd person here, let's continue with a \"we\" focus. Maybe:\nWhen using @Optional(), our code must be prepared for a null value. If we don't register a logger somewhere up the line, the injector will set the value of logger to null.\n. I get BAD FILENAME for v2 in the TS docs. (bad docregion?)\nAlso, the Dart docs show this:\nimport 'hero_list_component_2.dart';\nimport 'hero_service_1.dart';\n/*\nimport 'hero_list_component.dart';\nimport 'hero_service.dart';\n*/\nThey should instead look more like the v3 imports, shouldn't they?\nimport 'hero_list_component.dart';\nimport 'hero_service.dart';\n. I'm so glad this doesn't say ProviderComponent8 any more!\n. This is a really long sentence, and it continues the thought of the previous paragraph. Let's shorten this sentence and combine the two paragraphs. Maybe:\nBut what should we use as the token? We can't use Map because it's too general purpose. Our app might depend on several maps, each for a different purpose.\nDart difference: Interfaces are valid tokens\n... are just class names. Map is a valid token even though it's the name of an abstract class; it's just unsuitable as a token because it's too general.\n. By this time we might have forgotten the problem. :) How about:\n\nThe solution to specifying non-class dependencies is...\n\nOf course, that raises the question (especially for Dart): what should that solution be? is it the only one? Maybe \"The solution\" -> \"One solution\"?\n. Define \"it\" before using it:\nit <-> the !{configType} interface\n. Move the comma to be before \"relative\". Maybe change \"relative...\" to be clearer. I'm not sure if you're comparing the map & class benefits, or something else.\n(Where the comma is, it's equivalent to \"This, is that\", which is you wouldn't normally do. If the sentence seems too hard to read without the comma, I'd rewrite to make it clearer. Maybe: Defining a configuration object class has a few benefits. One key benefit is strong static checking: we'll be warned early if we misspell a property name or assign it a value of the wrong type.)\n. Cascade isn't an operator, strictly speaking. Also, be sure to show it \"(..)\", not just name it.\nI'm not sure what the most important points of this discussion are. It needs to be clearer, and probably broken into multiple paragraphs.\n. consequencem -> consequence,\n(if it isn't rewritten out of existence)\n. How about ngio-issues -> new-issue and use this URL:\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular.io/issues/new\n. On the right track, but this could still be simplified. Maybe:\nIf we use cascades, the configuration object can't be declared const and we can't use\na value provider. The solution is to use a factory provider:\n. Could we just delete this paragraph? If not, let's simplify the wording.\n. If we're editing this, I'd use sentence caps but not add commas at the end. (Periods would be fine, though.) I'd also add a colon after \"plan\". For example:\nHere's our plan:\n- Turn ... navigation.\n- ...\n- Tie ... structure.\n. Move the \":\" to the end of the line.\n. Remove the punctuation at the end of these lines.\n. Let's reword this a bit to clarify what \"it\" is. Also, maybe you could show the imports, since you mention them? Or don't show them, but don't mention them. (If you do mention them, try to reword \"might as well\".) Maybe:\nBecause the template for HeroesComponent no longer uses HeroDetailComponent directly \u2014\ninstead using the router to navigate to it \u2014 we can remove HeroDetailComponent from the directives list. That list is now empty, so we can remove the directives argument. The revised @Component looks like this:\n. \"is referenced\" is passive voice. Maybe:\nAlso, edit index.html to refer to this stylesheet:\n. Why change chapter to part? I thought they were consistently using \"chapter\" for each page?\n. Fix the snake_case link? (It just went to the top of the glossary page, for me.)\n. This paragraph currently says \"We'll be using the Dart BrowserClient to communicate with a server. This class is exported by the Dart http library.\"\nA more correct, natural way to say it might be:\nWe'll be using the http package's BrowserClient class to communicate with a server.\n. Let's orient it around the http package, not the http library. (E.g. the docs are under browser_client, not http. I actually don't see how BrowserClient gets included... and sure enough, when I tried making main.dart match the code shown below, it couldn't find BrowserClient.)\n. I think the v1 imports should be:\nimport 'package:angular2/platform/browser.dart';\nimport 'package:angular2_tour_of_heroes/app_component.dart';\nimport 'package:http/browser_client.dart';\nSo no imports of angular2/core.dart or http.dart, (At least, that made WebStorm happy. The app still wouldn't run for me.)\n. Dart Angular 2 Transformer -> angular2 transformer\n. Move the \"(we'll...)\" to be after the end of the sentence. Also, let's phrase it a little differently so it's not about us as explainers. Maybe:\nWe also need to add a resolved_identifiers entry, to inform the angular2 transformer that we'll be using BrowserClient. (For an explanation of why this extra configuration is needed, see the HTTP client chapter.) We'll also need to use Client from http, so let's add that now as well.\n. It occurs to me that additions are lowlighted. :) But I don't have a better word.\n. Unclear whether \"standard\" is modifying the library or the class. Or what it really means. Delete \"standard\"?\n. Technically, get() returns a Future. Also, \"which\" without a comma before it is a red flag for possibly unclear text. Maybe:\nTo get the list of heroes, we first make an asynchronous call to http.get(). Then we use the _extractData helper method to decode the response payload (body).\n. \"Edit in\" sounds weird. (the TS \"Add/Edit in\", strangely, seems more understandable, probably because you have more context.)\nWhy are the Dart & TS versions so different here?\n. Yes, I saw that too. :) I wasted a few minutes of my life thinking about what that meant, but once I saw that we couldn't get BrowserClient by importing http, muddling the library and package seemed wrong.\n. Should the . be ?.?\nActually, I guess ?. doesn't return a boolean. But should we do a null check?\n. OK to lose the null check?\n. natural extensions -> a natural extension\n. Just a note: I have a knee-jerk reaction against these Future<Null> annotations. I think it's because they make the functions look more complicated than they are.\nIf they're really the way to go, I'll play along. But... ew.\n. Why is pubspec.yaml separate?\n. Unfortunate! Maybe we can divide it up more explicitly. Maybe Dart files & Other files?\n. I guess it's fine, but it seemed like a bug. A little intro would make it seem not quite so weird.\nNot a showstopper.\n. i.e. -> that is\n(many people don't know what i.e. means)\nActually, though... do we really need to mention parts? They're strongly discouraged. Also, people might not know that each file without a library directive is itself a library. Perhaps instead:\nIn this guide, the term module refers to a Dart compilation unit, such as a library. If a Dart file has no library or part directive, then that file itself is a library and thus a compilation unit. For more information...\n. Module -> A module\nOR\nLibraries are modules\n. Just some?\n. I had left the Modules section out of the Dart version because (1) it was added late to the TS version (which is why we already had a handy, module-less image) and (2) it seemed like it wasn't really necessary, from a Dart perspective.\nAre \"modules\" a concept used in other pages?\n. Fix filename for Dart.\n. I'd leave the word \"export\" out of the Dart version, since in TS it refers to an explicit export keyword.\n. again with the \"export\"\nIn Dart (if we need to keep this section), I'd use something like \"defines\" instead.\n. \"export\" is again questionable\n. It seems like this section, if we need it at all, could be a lot smaller.\n. \"export\" again\n. exporting -> providing?\n. Perhaps this should be a DART DIFFERENCE in the Dart version only? I can't think of anywhere else where we have Dart info in the TS docs.\n. I just realized that a lot of code snippets have headings that didn't used to. Do we really need the file info? I'd rather just concentrate on the code, for small snippets like this where the filename seems irrelevant.\n. Use \"for example\" instead of \"e.g.\". From our internal style guide (which I hope will be available externally at some point):\ne.g. Don't use. Instead, use phrases like \"for example\" or \"for instance.\" Too many people mix up \"e.g.\" and \"i.e.\"\n. It seems like this transcript should include the place where _heroService is declared, so you can see it's a HeroService.\n. This excerpt uses a couple of APIs that aren't explained here (or anywhere on this page): OnInit, ngOnInit.\nIf we can't hide them, let's add an aside that briefly explains them and/or refers to where they're explained.\n. This snippet is uglier than it used to be, due to the /* . . . */s and implements OnInit. Any way to make it cleaner?\n. This link doesn't work in the Dart version. Add a placeholder?\n. It just seemed verbose, but fixing that can wait until the editors take a look.\n. I usually include the : in the boldface and capitalize the character afterward (Some). Also, I think we should explain/promise less. Maybe:\nKnown issue: Some cheat sheet entries are currently inaccurate, reflecting TypeScript instead of Dart.\n. Why is this line here? This shows up as a weird \"only ts\" bullet item in the TS version of the docs...\n. Hero object doesn't seem quite right here. Revert back to \"the string value of the Hero object\"?\n. I'm a little confused. I believe I just saw this text in a commit that I (belatedly) commented on: https://github.com/angular/angular.io/commit/d0811714d54cda1882f8287e095bf182ce39421d#commitcomment-18338618\n. Again, I commented on this in https://github.com/angular/angular.io/commit/d0811714d54cda1882f8287e095bf182ce39421d#commitcomment-18338618\n. And here: https://github.com/angular/angular.io/commit/d0811714d54cda1882f8287e095bf182ce39421d#commitcomment-18338618\n. I'm not sure whether this change is correct. (The author should comment and, if possible, provide clearer wording.) Also, we avoid passive voice such as \"is placed\", because it hides the doer.\n. We usually avoid \"note\" unless we really want to make it a note (which we'd usually indicate with a callout or alert).\n. I like these changes. You got rid of \"We\", and you clarified the \"No\".\n. This change isn't bad, but I'm not sure it's any clearer than the original.\n. The \"to\" is important. Maybe this instead:\nThe template expression should evaluate to a value of the type expected by the target property.\n(You could probably come up with better words than mine.)\n. Avoid passive voice! (I think it'd be \"omitted\" if we let it in, but we won't. :) Also, it's important to say all, for clarity. (Otherwise, someone might think it's any.) Instead, maybe:\nOmit the brackets when all of the following conditions are true:\n. Again, avoid passive voice. Maybe:\nInitializing attributes this way is common in standard HTML, and...\n. You're right to avoid \"we\", but I also usually avoid \"there\" in technical writing... it's a content-free word that's a clue that the writing could be clearer.\nOnce we rewrite this whole doc to use \"you\" instead of \"we\", rewriting this sentence will be easier...\nOur task here is more difficult because the text isn't clear. I don't think the point is that a choice exists, but that either choice or both might be valid. In this case, I'd follow up with the author to make sure we're communicating the right thing. Maybe this text and example aren't even needed.\n. I've liked all the changes up to here, but I think \"an\" is correct here.\n. the -> an\n. I'm not sure about this change. I'd consult the author.\n. Why move the ** to disinclude the most important term?\n. Can you think of a way to reword this without the passive voice?\n. Again, I like avoiding \"we\", but adding passive voice is generally bad.\n. The original seems clearer.\n. \"The directive\" seems clearer.\n(But I like the \"that\" -> \", which\" change.)\n. I have no opinion on \"which tells\" vs. \"telling\", but either one should have a comma before it.\n. \"in\" sounds more correct to me.\n. I'm not crazy about adding the big blue title to all the one-line examples. It gives the source of the code more weight than the actual code.\n. Interestingly, the version with the line numbers is vertically more compact (in a good way) than the original version.\n. This line looks weird and ungrammatical. Can we just delete it?\n. The TS version of this mentions the code/API that does each thing. I rather like that. It tells you where to look in the code up above.\n. which: -> that\n(no semi-colon, clarify that this is a restrictive clause)\n. ; -> and\n. Abbreviations are great.\n. yep, that's what I meant. :)\n. I see your point, but I'd still lean toward making the formatting reflect the phrasing, as long as the final result is still readable.\n. Yes, it matches any event property on the element, so I believe \"an\" is correct. \"the\" makes it sound like an element can have only one event property, or maybe that you're talking about a property named \"event\".\n. Looking at https://github.com/angular/angular.io/blob/master/public/docs/ts/latest/guide/template-syntax.jade, this file has had 23(!) contributors. Looking at \"Blame\", the author to blame for that line is... me. But only because I fixed some capitalization; it used to say \"an Event Binding.\"\nLooking around the web, the phrase \"an event binding\" is fairly common. It refers to a specific occurrence of event binding, where \"event binding\" refers to the practice in general.\nSo I'd switch back to \"an event binding.\"\n. That's a good start, but the second sentence sounds like a command instead of a description. Maybe:\n\nThis code sets the input box value property by binding to the firstName property. To listen for changes to the value, the code binds to the input box's input event.\n\n(I wasn't sure about this/the code as the actor, but I can't think of anything better. Another possibility was template, but that sounded too big/vague.)\n. It's the first one. The value of $event already is the hero-to-delete (as set by the code deleteRequest.emit(this.hero)).\n. directives -> directive?\n(subject-verb mismatch)\n. I wondered about having two @Component annotations for a single class. Sure enough, when I try to pub serve or pub build this, I get a build error:\nBuild error:\nTransform DirectiveProcessor on angular2_tour_of_heroes|lib/app_component_1.dart threw error: Only one Directive is allowed per class. Found unexpected \"@Component(selector: 'my-app', template: '''\n      <h1>{{title}}</h1>\n      <a [routerLink]=\"['Heroes']\">Heroes</a>\n      <router-outlet></router-outlet>''', directives: const [HeroesComponent], providers: const [HeroService])\".\n@Component(selector: 'my-app', template: '''\n      <h1>{{title}}</h1>\n     ...\nDoes the serve/build work without errors for you?\n. Do these duplicate Component decorators appear in the published/live code? That would seem to be bad...\n. In the Dart version, I see the title lib/app_component_1.dart.\n(I didn't expect to see the _1, and it doesn't appear in the TS version.)\n. We don't use \", and\" in bulleted lists, so how about:\n- Move the following from HeroesComponent to AppComponent:\n  - title class property\n  - @Component template's <h1> element, which contains a binding to title\n. Delete the \"and\"\n(we don't treat list items like parts of a continuing sentence)\n. I don't see an import of router.dart. Shouldn't I?\n. I also don't see the @RouteConfig.\n. Since this isn't literal code here, how about changing it to this:\nImport the dashboard component and ...\n. Perhaps it'd be better to show the dashboard component import, as well? That would mean changing the intro text to something like:\nImport the dashboard component and add a route definition to the ... definitions:\n. Again, I don't see the router.dart import or the @RouteConfig definition here.\n. Add a heading above this, since you're no longer talking about useAsDefault/redirectTo. Perhaps:\nAdd navigation to the template\n. Assests -> Assets\nActually, let's remove the passive voice and clarify this a bit.\nThe value of templateUrl can be an [asset][] in this package or another package. To use an asset in another package, use a full package reference, such as ...\n. This made me wonder whether the path is relative to this file or to the lib/ directory. It'd be good to state that explicitly.\n. You're not really importing that class, you're importing the file that contains it. Why not show the import, either here or in the \"hero detail\" code above?\n. ->\nFirst, add the requisite imports:\n. Let's get rid of the passive voice. how about:\nhave... injected -> inject...\nconstructor with...: -> constructor, saving their values in...:\n. This is an excerpt but has no \"...\" to indicate that code is missing. (It's missing imports, the OnInit implementation, @Component, ...)\n. I guess I'd either use the \"...\" or find another way to make clear that you need to import dart:html to gain access to window.\n. I found it disconcerting to not have the filename mentioned here, even though it's apparently in the title of the immediately following excerpt. (Don't make me think! Draw connections explicitly.)\nown file -> own file, called hero-detail.component.html:\n(of course, you'd need to adjust the name for Dart)\n. I found the \"but without...soon\" text confusing.\nHow about putting it in a note AFTER the code, since it's (1) not crucial here and (2) potentially confusing. Most people won't notice it's missing unless they're comparing it to their own code (if they're editing while reading).\n. In fact, It's not removed very soon. Why not show it, with a note that we can take it out? If that doesn't work, just add a note after the sample.\n. sgtm\n. yes\n. Let's reword the first two sentences to remove the \"There are\" and give a hint as to what other uses of \"annotation\" might be. (The first sentence stopped me cold, as I tried to recall what the other kinds of annotations were.) Maybe:\nWhen unqualified, _annotation_ refers to a Dart [metadata annotation][metadata] (as opposed to, say, a type annotation).\n. We should add a paragraph mentioning that in TypeScript, the equivalent term is decorator.\n. This is no longer true for dart-lang/angular2. We need to update this definition (at least the Dart version, preferably the JS/TS version as well).\n. Maybe remove this from the Dart version? I don't think we talk about zones, and Dart has its own concept of zones.\n. it's -> its\n. 'booting' up -> being initialized\n(In general, try to avoid language that requires quotation marks. If you do need the quotes, use double quotes.)\n. will prime -> primes\n(no need for future tense here)\n. remove \"an\". The idiom is \"seems like overkill\".\n. and -> , and\n. Yeah, when I saw it, I realized that \"an\" would make sense, but for some reason it's never used that way.\n. This is hard to read and \"like to put\" isn't quite right. How about:\nThe hero service's delete method` uses the delete HTTP method to remove the hero from the server:\n. \".ts\" appears in the Dart version\n. Oh, thank goodness you did this. The \"Http\" was really bugging me!\n. Why is this ### instead of ##?\n. This heading used to be directly tied to the order of the sections to follow (post, put, delete, and then a save section that combined the first two). Now I don't even see \"post(\" in the Dart page unless I select lib/hero_service.dart at the bottom of the page.\nI think this rewrite needs some more connecting material, plus a careful review to make sure it includes everything it needs.\n(Which reminds me... I noticed that some of the earlier samples got longer, so we need to also make sure that this page doesn't include anything unnecessary. /*...*/ can be a good thing, reducing complexity and scariness.)\n. I was surprised this was ##, not ###. Also, this section title/content wasn't clearly telegraphed by what came before.\n. I'm inclined to reduce the # of words, not increase, for greater readability. Also, we've decided to use \"page\" to refer to individual pages, not \"section\" or \"file.\" However, it seems like we could drop that here because the context is clear from the position on the page. How about something like this:\nRecommended npm packages, and how to specify package dependencies\n(I have no strong opinion about whether there should a period at the end of that.)\n. I like the original wording better. (Though, like I said, I don't particularly care whether we use a period or not. We just need to be consistent.)\n. Do a global search for \"we\"\u2014one slipped through here.\n. Actually I think this is referring to the BASICS and DEVELOPER GUIDE pages, not the ToH, which precedes this page. Maybe just:\nYou'll learn the details in the pages that follow.\n. This is technically first person plural (a \"we\" thing) but maybe it's OK. Maybe.\n. This is only an introduction -> This page introduces modules\nchapter -> page\ncovers modules -> covers them\nGLOBAL search: chapter -> page\n. GLOBAL: Angular Modules -> Angular modules\n. (I think. In general, Angular tends to capitalize things overmuch. Literal classnames should of course be capitalized, but I'm inclined not to capitalize other things like dependency injection and Angular modules.)\n. (Please reload if you were looking at the above comment. I changed my mind. :)\n. closely-related -> closely related\n(per http://www.cjr.org/language_corner/sincere-ly_yours.php, if I'm reading it right)\n. important -> important properties\n. add a \",\" before the \"and\"\n. Above, the provider entry needs a \" - \"\nAlso, what follows the \" - \" should be a noun phrase, so the bootstrap entry should be something like this:\n- bootstrap - the main application view...\n. I can't leave a comment on lines you didn't change, but just after this, \"subset\" (in the exports item) seems like it should be \"the subset\"\n. Having \" - \" as a separator in these items gives me pause, but I suppose it makes sense here since you've already used a colon (\": \") to introduce the items.\n. It hurts to add so many big words here, although I agree \"for show\" is unclear. Maybe:\n\nThe export of AppComponent is just to show how to export; it isn't actually necessary in this example. A root module has no reason to export anything because other components don't need to import the root module.\n\nIf you think that's unclear, we could possibly add more words (though you know I'm generally against more words unless they're absolutely necessary!):\nHowever, if another module did import the root module, then that module could use AppComponent in its component templates.\n. Modules -> modules (x2)\n. GLOBAL: Use sentence case for section heads\n. \"on\" sounded weird to me. It sounded like I was jumping on the page. :)\nInstead: \"from\"? \"at\"?\n. This is better, but this sentence is still hard to parse. I think it's \"the shell at the application root with navigation links\" that makes it difficult, especially since it seems like it's \"with ... a list of heroes\". Consider rewriting and using a bulleted list to clarify the separation between items.\n. Did you check whether it does indeed have this method? (The \"might\" made me think it didn't.)\nConsider clarifying what \"It\" refers to.\n. will call -> calls\ndeliver -> delivers\n. You didn't change this, but... why does this line have *s? Plus, they're mismatched!\n. Ah, I see, this was all unnecessarily conditional. Your changes make sense to me.\n. We should add back a hint about why Angular knows to call the constructor and deliver the HeroService. Or maybe just delete this subsection entirely.\n. The developer -> \"You\" or \"Your app\" or \"Your code\"... (pick one!)\n. Seems run-on and a bit wordy. Maybe:\nA template looks like regular HTML, except for a few differences.\n. \"includes\" made me think of HTML imports. Plus \"It\" has an unclear antecedent. Maybe something like this (which you can probably improve):\nAlthough this template uses typical HTML elements like <h2> and  <p>,\nit has some differences. Code like *ngFor, {{hero.name}}, (click), [hero], and <hero-detail> uses Angular's template syntax.\n. I'm not crazy about this transition. How about.\nIn the last line of the template, the <hero-detail> tag is a custom element that represents a new component, HeroDetailComponent.\n. you see -> you can see\n(It seems wrong to tell them what they see.)\n. it -> HeroListComponent\n. We! How about:\nTo tell Angular...component, attach ....\n. I'd delete \"(no surprise)\" and firm up the writing a bit. How about:\nHere is the ...}, which identifies...\n. will do so -> does so\nin -> is in\n(GLOBAL: search for \"will\")\n. Drop \"the\" before the classname. (\"the classname\" is OK if you're talking about an object, but here you're talking about not an instance of the class but the actual class, which is in the array.)\n. \"your\" could be \"the\" here. (I don't feel strongly about this, though.)\n. The \"There are\" makes me cringe, but I can't think of anything better. Still, we could tie this better to the figure. How about something like this:\nAs the diagram shows, there are four forms of data binding syntax... both directions.\n. Just to be explicit, I don't think it's necessary to talk about the arrows in the diagram.\n. Unnecessary use of \"our\" (do a GLOBAL search for \"our\"). Plus \"There are\" is a red flag for wordiness/fogginess. How about:\nThe HeroListComponent template has three forms of data binding:\n. Let's rephrase this to be clearer. (And actually, I don't see a need to explicitly say that HLC doesn't have two-way binding.) Maybe:\nHere's an example of two-way binding from the HeroDetailComponent template:\n. Direction is important here. Maybe:\nfrom the root of the application component tree down through all the components it contains, directly or indirectly.\n(Wow, much longer without being much clearer. Maybe you can improve it?)\n. I'd veto this change. It's unclear what \"it\" refers to here.\n. Here and in similar cases, I'd change the link from [example] to [example template]. (since you're linking to the template source, and not the source for the entire example)\n. includes -> contains\n\"includes\" (to me) is a synonym for \"imports\", so let's not use \"includes\" unless its meaning is very clear.\n. \"on\" still strikes me as wrong.\n. We should be consistent about capitalization of page names. Before, we used \"Angular modules\", when the page name is \"Angular Modules\".\n. you'll ... know -> you need to know\n. This page is actually part of the Basics (which is under guide/ but no longer presented as such in the sidenav). We need to decide how we're going to refer to doc groups. But maybe we don't need to be so specific? Maybe we can just say \"documentation\"\n. Since we don't have a link for this, we should change the text to reflect that. Maybe:\nThe change detection documentation will cover how...\n. and -> , and\n. This list isn't parallel. Some of the items have (implicit) \"You\" subjects, while others are 3rd person descriptions of the feature. Can you fix these?\n. This made me look up the writing guidelines, and sure enough, each bulleted list item is supposed to end with a period. (That's something I haven't been doing.) Good going!\n. use -> uses\n. delete \"by\"\n. This is good, but on second reading, I thought it could be shorter:\nAngular has a few more directives...\nBut we could endlessly fiddle with the text. What you have is good enough.\n. This should be either [Dependency Injection] or [dependency injection].\n. This wording (and all references to \"guide\") is left over from when BASICS and DEVELOPER GUIDE were all one thing (DEVELOPER GUIDE, I think). I think it predated the cookbook.\nI'm not sure how we should refer to this group of docs. Nor am I sure whether this text refers to the whole site or just to stuff under guide/.\n@wardbell or @naomiblack, maybe you have ideas?\n. GLOBAL: chapter -> page\n. covers -> covers how\n. , for -> ,\n. \"steps\" seems wrong. Maybe:\nAfter reading the above sections, you can skip to any other pages on this site.\n. A -> A link\n. comment -> comment,\n(show the icon?)\n. \"Post\" confused me. (I at first read it with the meaning \"after documentation\".) Also, it's GitHub, not github. Maybe:\nUse the angular.io GitHub repo for documentation issues and pull requests.\n. Maybe:\nUse the angular GitHub repo to report issues with Angular 2 itself.\n. GLOBAL: chapter -> page\n. won't -> don't\nyou'll -> you\n. boos -> boots\n(x2; search for this in all files, perhaps)\n. with very specific -> using the\n. We don't normally use \" with links, right? Delete.\n. As -> When\n(\"As\" can mean \"because\", so it seems too ambiguous to me.)\n. which -> , which\n. a -> an\n. Change this back. \"Progressive Web Apps\" is a thing.\n. But make it \"Progressive web apps\"\n. complex -> , complex\n. Oh, you're right. There used to be an icon for this, but isn't any longer. There's a \"Report Issues\" link in the footer, but that links to angular/angular (as reported in https://github.com/angular/angular.io/issues/2124).\nLet's just delete this sentence, at least for now.\n. chapter -> page\n(look for \"chapter\" in all files)\n. global: section heads (and links to them) should be sentence case\n. delete \"of the\"\n. in than in -> than in\n. It seems weird to link inside that page without telling you so. I might say something like \"the Interpolation section of the Template Syntax page.\"\n. delete the \",\"\n. Again, let's provide more context for this link. (It's disconcerting to click a link but be taken to a place that has a different heading.)\nThis is a global comment. (woohoo! you get to search for [.*](.*#.*)!)\n. Should the banana in a box syntax be inside backticks?\nSo this:\n[()]\nWould be this:\n`[()]`\n. Another possibility (especially in cases where it sounds like you're repeating the section name too much) is to not explicitly name the section, but to otherwise indicate that you're not taking them to the top of Template Syntax.\n. There are a bunch of unclear \"it\"s in this section. Fix it! :)\n. E.g., this sounds like \"it\" refers to \"that method\". I think \"it\" is actually \"the app\".\n. \"Code filters in the component\" sounded like a noun phrase to me. Clarify, so it's clear who does what.\n. Change this sentence to avoid passive voice:\nIf several templates use the same filtering code, consider...\n. delete the \",\" before \"could\" (or add a comma before \"instead\")\n. The title isn't doing the ordering. Clarify.\n. Like similar wording before, this is hard to read (results sounds like a verb instead of a noun). But I think this one is easier to fix:\nInstead, use component code to order or sort results.\n. Global: Javascript -> JavaScript\n. <many spaces>along -> , along\n. Attribute Directive -> attribute directive\n. (I suspect this is elsewhere, too.)\n. Change back to \"it needs\". We're talking about a piece of software here, not a person.\n. which -> , which\n. Component -> component\n(true throughout, except where you're referring to the Component type. the Angular docs have a big case of Over Capitalization.)\n. Directive -> directive\nTemplate -> template\n. This paragraph is correctly capitalized!\nExcept perhaps for \"component instance\", but I think that's just a matter of using \"instance\" in a different way than we usually do.\n. Binding -> binding\n(Switch this and the remaining items in this list to be sentence case.)\n. This is another case of a link that's more specific than the title indicates. Please do whatever you did elsewhere to make the destination less of a surprise.\n. chapter -> page (GLOBAL)\n. Component -> component\n. Injector or injector?\n. D...I...S or d...i...s?\n. Is that really the link name, with sS? Perhaps fix it (but you'll probably need to search for and fix \"#typesScript\"  in other files, too).\n. I'll stop marking this, but please do a global search for link titles that are too broad, and fix them however you fixed them before.\n. which -> , which\n(or use parens instead)\n. Put \"tutorial\" in the name, somehow, to indicate that it's part of the tutorial, not a reference/guide page for services.\n. This is a good change. Please change \"e.g.\" to \"for example\" globally. (I noticed it up above but didn't mark it...)\n. \"website\" is too broad for link text. Maybe just use the website's shortened URL:\nRead more about TypeScript at typescriptlang.org.\n. I just realized there was spaces around the /. Please remove them.\n. OrderBy doesn't seem right\u2014shouldn't it be orderBy?\nBut actually, it seems weird to repeat it here. How about rephrasing like this:\nSorts the collection in the order specified by ... \n(I'm not sure about this, because I see \"ordering or sorting\" elsewhere, which makes me wonder if there's a difference I'm not getting here. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting says there are two common meanings of \"sorting\": ordering & categorizing. Hm.)\n. As above, I wonder whether it's really necessary to use both \"order\" and \"sort\" here. Feel free to research further with the writer... or to leave this as is.\n. again, remove the spaces around the \"/\"s\n. \"Cross-Site Scripting Attacks\" should be all lowercase.\n. I'm not sure about the title (or destination) of this link. Maybe change to:\nsee the OWASP Guide Project.\n. I'm not sure how Contents are being handled (could you check other pages for good examples?). At the very least, we should capitalize it correctly and not make it a level-one heading. Maybe just use a paragraph:\nContents:\n* ...\n. It's weird to me to have 2 :s in a row. Maybe change the first one to \u2014?\n. This is a verrrry long line... I like to keep lines <=80 chars, so it's easier to see diffs in GitHub and other tools.\n. I see DomSanitizer in the API docs: https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/#!?apiFilter=domsani\n. Cross -> cross\n. Again, this is a really long line\n. paper, -> paper\n(no comma because it isn't parenthetical)\n. Time -> time\n. I'd change this to:\nJust-in-time (JIT) compilation\n. Just in Time -> just-in-time\n(global)\n. In fact, let's make this \"Ahead-of-time\", since it's a adjectival phrase before a noun. (http://www.grammarbook.com/punctuation/hyphens.asp)\n. Ahead of time -> Ahead-of-time\n(GLOBAL)\n. Ahead of Time -> ahead-of-time\n(global)\n. \"Lifecycle Hook\" seems overcapitalized. I'm also not sure about the quotation marks. Maybe:\n-> lifecycle hook\n. re -> are\n?\n. That's not how we format notes. You should be able to find an example to follow by grepping other .jade files for \"Note:\".\n. Angular doesn't pass it, our code does. Maybe:\nwhich the code passes as a parameter to ...\n. Interpolation doesn't display it, it's how we make it be displayed. Um... maybe:\nThe code uses interpolation to ...\n. Grep for \"our\", replace with \"your\" or \"the\" or whatever you deem appropriate.\n(grep for \"we\", while you're at it)\n. This page has a lot of \"will/'ll\" in it, which is counter to our style... I think our editor gave up on doing the kind of rewrite it'd take to eradicate it, but you should feel free to go further (as long as doing so doesn't make the text unfriendly or hard to read).\n. of uses -> uses\n. too many \"reference\"s in this sentence.\nchange the second one to use \"refers\"?\n. Change to avoid \"we\"\n. won't -> doesn't\n. Let's rewrite this to avoid \"You\" and be more accurate. Maybe:\nThe component's values property updates only when...\n. chapter -> page\n(global)\n. We -> (rewrite)\n. Github -> GitHub\n(global)\n. Let's not call it \"quickstart\", since I think of that as the example in the QuickStart section. Maybe just \"Simple\"? Or drop the word entirely?\n. I'm not crazy about phrasing this as a command, since they don't know how to do this. I'd prefer \"Let's build\", but maybe you can think of something better.\n. Let's drop the \" around [@triggerName].\n. . It is -> and is\n(to improve flow, reduce choppiness)\n. Later, the docs use 's inside the `s.\nShould it be active/inactive or 'active'/'inactive'? I'm guessing the former, since later it contains the code 'inactive <=> active'.\n. I'd remove the commas around \"called void\". You couldn't just omit \"called void\" without changing the meaning of the sentence, so it's a restrictive phrase (not a parenthetical one like this).\n. I'd delete the periods here, since they might be construed as code.\n. \"define\" sounds like it's required. I don't know that it is.\ndefine -> you can define\n. Define -> You can define\nAlso, \"as a number in pixels\" makes it sounds like you either can't specify px or must specify px. I think the truth (judging from the previous wording) is that you can specify a string with a px/em/% suffix, or you can just specify a number (which is the equivalent of a string with the px suffix).\nNot sure how to phrase this best.\nAlso, the \"most dimensional properties\" thing makes me wonder what the heck a dimensional property is.\n. your app doesn't -> you don't\n. For example, elements often have widths...\n. I just noticed that this doc is inconsistent about whether it uses \"s around enter and leave. I'd be inclined to not use quotes unless you're really quoting a string from the code (which I don't think you are).\n. delete the comma?\n(It would seem OK without the italics, but with them it reads oddly to me. Like \"transition\" and \"timing string\" are the same thing.)\n. and picks -> but pick\n. keyframe -> that keyframe\n(or \"the keyframe\")\n. you to -> to\n. allow -> allows\n(since it's \"using\", not \"groups\", that's the subject of this verb)\n. independent -> independently\n. / -> or\n(/ can mean too many things, including division, and-or, ...)\n. Looking at your changes, I don't see this comment addressed yet.\n. Much better wording! Nit:\nwill assume -> assumes\n. @wardbell We started that when we switched to the new style guide. I don't remember the history of the decision (Naomi might), but it's in the checklist. I've added it to the word list.\n. The only problem with using imperative here is that the reader might think that they're being ordered to do something (which they don't know yet how to do yet). This is the one case where future tense (and possibly even \"let's\") might be the way to go.\n. I don't know why, either. They seemed equivalent to me. I can ask the editor to explain.\n. Agreed that the reason for the keyup.enter alternative should be in there (as succinctly as possible, while still being clear).\n. Hmmm... I wouldn't say the binding shows it, it just enables showing it. Can you reword this?\n. This changes the meaning. The dev specifies the binding, which enables the app to display property values. Can you think of another way to say this?\n. Do we usually use a first-level heading for Contents? (I'm actually not sure. I tend not to in my own writing, but I don't remember whether we've established a good precedent in these pages.)\n. HTML -> the HTML\n?\n(It sounded funny to me.)\n. Why is XHR in code font? I don't think it's a string you'll see in any code. Also, you already said \"asynchronous\" before, so \"async\" seems unnecessary. Maybe:\n...a response to an HTTP request.\n. I'm not crazy about this change (which is similar to something I complained about in another PR). It sounds like a command to do something that you don't know how to do. Maybe:\nThe next few sections review some of the coding choices in the app.\n. you're using -> the app uses\n(or something better/clearer)\n. I'm not crazy about \"you\" here, since they didn't make the decision. Can you think of a better way to phrase this?\n. Ward mentioned using \"chapter\" instead of \"page\" because \"page\" can be confused with the app. This is the first time I've noticed that problem, although I don't think it matters too much in this case which one you mean. Maybe:\nThis app uses the more terse...\n. presentation -> UI\n?\n. good x-ref!\n. which -> , which\n(as a rule, use either \"that\" or \", which\", depending on whether the phrase is restrictive\u2014can't be dropped without changing the meaning\u2014or nonrestrictive)\n. \"you\" sounds a little accusatory here. Maybe:\nThis app's code defines the data directly inside the component, which...\n. Not sure that \"illustrative purposes\" is the best phrase here. Maybe... \"a simple demo\"?\n. Again, the \"you\" seems unnecessary here. Maybe:\nyou're binding -> the data binding is\n. Most of the time you'd bind to\n->\nIn real applications, most bindings are to\nTo do this, ...\n->\n(new paragraph)\nTo convert this binding to use specialized objects,\nturn the !{_array}...\n. Let's do more de-you-ification:\nyou have -> the class has\nyou do -> it does\n. Change this last sentence to avoid the \"your\":\nThe declaration ... parameters takes advantage of ... shortcut.\n. How about:\n...when creating an instance of the class.\n. Again, switch from a command to an intro.\n. so you -> to\n. Your -> The\nnow you've clarified ... is -> the code is clearer.\n. \"you can\" seems misleading here. The point is not what you can do, but that you're going to do it conditionally. Maybe:\nLet's change the example to display...\n(I know, that uses \"us\", but I can't think of a clearer way to introduce what's coming next. Maybe you can!)\n. DOM which -> DOM. That \n. your -> the\n. is -> is to\n. Just curious: Why did this go backwards?\n. ditto\n. back ticks are really valid here?\n. Perhaps a little help on how to get the project-or-alias-name? Or an example of a name?\n. Yep, that's great.\n. I think the \"an\"s need to go back in.\n. Events -> events\nGLOBAL: Headings should be sentence case. (There were lots of occurrences of title case that weren't visible in the diffs, so I haven't marked them.)\n. Property Binding -> property binding\nEvent Binding -> event binding\n(it looks like this section was added after the edit, and uses pre-edit capitalization patterns)\n. Is this FIXME comment still needed?\n. Headings should be sentence case\n. GLOBAL: \n- Angular library -> angular2 package\n- Angular -> AngularDart?\n- security@angular.io -> ??? (@matanlurey, what would you recommend?)\n. The formatting on this makes it look like a mistake, although I do appreciate that text is much easier to update than a screenshot. Any way we can put a box around it and/or change the font?\n. This could be dartier. Also, the dart:html APIs are safer than the raw DOM APIs (e.g., see Element.innerHtml Sanitization). Not sure how that affects the general message, though, that they should avoid directly changing the DOM.\n. Should be component, not Component, right?\n. This change doesn't appear to be in the _cache version.\n. Github -> GitHub\n(Global. Not introduced in this PR, but while you're there...)\n. It's a little weird to have links on QuickStart but not on Guide & Advanced... But it is definitely handy to have these links, especially for those times when the window is too narrow to display the sidenav.\nThis is a case where having everything in the guide/ directory is coming back to bite us.\nMaybe we should try this out and see if anyone objects?\n. angular.io -> Angular\n. No, I don't think a self-link is helpful. We could maybe briefly mention in the text that that's where they are.\n. It's OK to terminate an arg list with a \",\"? (Seems like it should be, but not sure whether all the SDKs the pubspec allows actually support this.). Nope, meant to delete this. Thanks for catching it!. Done. Fixed. Done. I vacillated about this. Let's try it that way.. This change (potential -> potent) seems questionable, but since it's not yours, Patrice...\n@kapunahelewong maybe you can fix it?. will let -> lets\n(not a big deal, but strange that it's worse). ",

I don't see any directives in core that use @Event or @Property, yet. I guess we have to support both?\n. @pkozlowski-opensource here is a bit more. It gets the properties and events for each directive and there is a basic template.\nCheck out that it now pulls the description from the relevant member and can use either the class decorator (@Directive) or the appropriate member decorator (@Property and @Event).\n. Thanks for the feedback @pkozlowski-opensource.\nI expect that someone with more skills than I will do a job on the template at a later stage.\nCan you check that programmatic side of things, e.g. the extraction of data from the source, is inline with what to expect?

I think that, once #339 lands, we can land this one as well @naomiblack.\nWhile there is more that can be done with directives, it is good enough to get us started.\n.

We should create a new processor.\n. @jtraband and @naomiblack - this is a better way of structuring the code change that was merged yesterday. It keeps the processors cohesive and focussed only on one task.\nI added some tests for both processors for good measure, which could be expanded upon if anyone had the time.\n.

This is fixed by 05a272a116e6aa3645ff0653d37d2594ae25e6cb\n. This also fixes a bug where we were not displaying API docs that have docType let.\n. Further, the barrels displayed are now entirely controlled by the top level modules that are listed in https://github.com/angular/angular.io/blob/master/tools/api-builder/angular.io-package/index.js.\nSo there is only one place to change when updating the barrels in the project.\n. FAO: @naomiblack and @kwalrath \n. We had this problem with angular.js docs.  We fixed it by adding a directive:\n\njs\n.directive('scrollYOffsetElement', ['$anchorScroll', function($anchorScroll) {\n  return function(scope, element) {\n    $anchorScroll.yOffset = element;\n  };\n}]);\nand then using it on the header that was hiding the content:\nhtml\n  <div id=\"wrapper\">\n    <header scroll-y-offset-element class=\"header header-fixed\">\n      <section class=\"navbar navbar-inverse docs-navbar-primary\" ng-controller=\"DocsSearchCtrl\">\n    ...\nWe can do this in angular.io easily too.\n. @filipesilva - here is a fix for #477. Can you try it out?\n. @naomiblack - I agree with @IgorMinar that this is a really useful addition to the docs. Aesthetics to one side, the ability to find decorators in the docs is severely limited right now. For example, imagine you want to create a pipe but you are not sure what decorator you might need. What do you look for right now? Searching for Pipe in the API list gives:\n- AsyncPipe class\n- COMMON_PIPES var\n- CurrencyPipe class\n- DatePipe class\n- DecimalPipe class\n- JsonPipe class\n- LowerCasePipe class\n- NumberPipe class\n- PercentPipe class\n- SlicePipe class\n- UpperCasePipe class\n- PLATFORM_PIPES var\n- Pipe var\n- PipeFactory interface\n- PipeMetadata class\n- PipeTransform interface\nIs it obvious which of these is the place to look for the decorator?\nAs it turns out the Pipe var is the place to start and the PipeMetadata contains additional important information.\nI expect that people who are new to Angular 2 (trying it for the first time after beta is released) will be quickly confused by this.\nI am sorry that I gave decorators too much prominence in the UI - I didn't spend much time on that as I expected that you would want to tweak that anyway. But I don't think that should block it from being actioned before or near to beta release.\n. Rebased on master (and fixed the capitalization issue with function docType in the filter list)\n. What is the \"issue label\"? Do you mean the version number?\n. LGTM although it might be clearer to write:\njs\nreturn this.todos.length - this.todos.reduce((count, todo: Todo) => count + todo.done, 0);\n. Actually I really like the filter version!\n. @wardbell well it just matches my brain's understanding of what we are trying to do. But on second look I am happy with your suggestion too.\n. Indulge yourself, with post-yule fervour!\n. LGTM\n. LGTM\n. This is already fixed at https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/c8e909f8c9f0b18a6728b0088851099f54ca7826\n. Me too. I think github has a good solution for this\n. This is what Github uses: https://github.com/zeroclipboard/zeroclipboard\n. But that requires a hidden flash element. Not sure why the would use this over @afirdousi's suggestion... Perhaps browser compatibility? But we have significantly lower requirements in that regard\n. Oh alright then!\n. From the SO answer there is https://zenorocha.github.io/clipboard.js/\n. OK. I will knock up a directive using this tool. It is even under MIT license woohoo!\n. The harp server generates the css on the fly.\nYou can get the output if you run harp compile\n. @afirdousi actually what we need is white-space: pre-wrap. This ensures that the whitespace is not collapsed, which would be disastrous for the code formatting. See the summary table in https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/white-space\n. Oh no!\n. Actually the problem is that the copy button is for the code to the left of the aside block but the aside block is floating over the code block and covering up its right hand side. We need a bit of CSS magic here to get the code block to take the correct length.\n. We need someone with serious CSS-foo to battle with this - my initial hacking led to naught.\n. That works for me! Although, it does mean that the icon looks slightly too high in that specific case. But that is much better than it was. Let's land that change.\n. Fixed in master!\n. This is a Jade issue, but I will take a look\n. I fixed it with a kludge that is no better than what is there already :-(\n. @wardbell I was waiting for someone to review before I unilaterally merged it.\n. But happy to do so, if you can verify that the site looks correct to you after gulping it\n. This was only here to provide @naomiblack  with a quick and dirty look at what tags were being used and abused in the docs. I don't have any plans to implement it further nor incorporate it permanently.\nUnless @naomiblack says otherwise I would just close this.\n. I don't think this is the right fix\n. The actual jade error is due to lines 37-55, where the list of options is heavily indented. \ndiv(layout=\"column\")\n      pre(class=\"prettyprint no-bg-with-indent\")\n        a(class=\"code-anchor\" href=\"#constructor\")\n          code(class=\"code-background api-doc-code\") constructor\n        code(class=\"api-doc-code\") ({selector,\n                       inputs,\n                       outputs,\n                       properties,\n                       events,\n                       host,\n                       exportAs,\n                       moduleId,\n                       providers,\n                       viewProviders,\n                       changeDetection = ChangeDetectionStrategy.Default,\n                       queries,\n                       templateUrl,\n                       template,\n                       styleUrls,\n                       styles,\n                       animations,\n                       directives,\n                       pipes,\n                       encapsulation}?: {\n            selector?: string,\n            inputs?: string[],\n            outputs?: string[],\n            /** @deprecated */ properties?: string[],\n            /** @deprecated */ events?: string[],\n            host?: {[key: string]: string},\n            providers?: any[],\n            exportAs?: string,\n            moduleId?: string,\n            viewProviders?: any[],\n            queries?: {[key: string]: any},\n            changeDetection?: ChangeDetectionStrategy,\n            templateUrl?: string,\n            template?: string,\n            styleUrls?: string[],\n            styles?: string[],\n            animations?: AnimationEntryMetadata[],\n            directives?: Array&lt;Type|any[]&gt;,\n            pipes?: Array&lt;Type|any[]&gt;,\n            encapsulation?: ViewEncapsulation\n          })\n. Apart from additional ignore flag, this LGTM\n. My feeling with this PR is that it is duplicating a lot of what is done to generate the cheatsheets for TS and JS. Perhaps there is some way of making that processing more generic to accommodate Dart as well?\n. I think if it works then let's go with it\n. Should be fixed by https://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/2040\n. The compute paths processor takes only one template to compute the path for each document type.\nThis new item overrides previous one for the api-list-data document type.\nSo the paths for the api-list-data is now written to api-list-audit.json rather than the previous api-list.json.\nIf you want to have two output files (api-list-audit.json and api-list.json) then you need two documents. Then you either need to give them different document types so that the path processor can distinguish between them, or add an extra field that is referenced in the path template.\n. I fixed it up to replace each leading '_' with the same number of leading '-'\n. Although it is an \"experimental\" export so perhaps they wanted it to look a \"bit private\".\n. I think we should probably close this one now (@chalin?) given that @IgorMinar closed the original issue.\n. CC @IgorMinar \n. Let's see if how far we can get by updating the templates. Obviously there are still issues around NgModule, etc\n. LGTM - although I didn't run it.\n. The bug is in the linkDocs.js inline tag handler - it is making the assumption that a doc has a fileInfo property, which is not always true.\nI also get problems with the {@example ... } tags if they contain a newline, which is a bug in the example.js inline tag handler code.\nI will put together fixes for both\n. https://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/2296 should solve your problems @tbosch \n. The latest version of dgeni-packages uses a new version of nunjucks. This new nunjucks version has a breaking change in how macros are imported.\n. @wardbell this can be closed because the changes are already in the new angular/angular doc gen tooling.. I'll take a look today.\nBoth seem a bit weird. The @stable problem is probably due to the TypeScript processor concatenating the two exports together in some way...\n. The trouble is that, as far as TypeScript is concerned, the following two declarations are the same symbol:\nexport interface Attribute { attributeName?: string; }\nexport const Attribute: AttributeDecorator =\n    makeParamDecorator('Attribute', [['attributeName', undefined]]);\nIt is not clear how we should deal with this. Since TypeScript allows reopening of types, we assumed that multiple declarations for a symbol were for the same type and so we concatenate all the information from the two declarations into a single document, which is why the content field for this document looks like:\nType of the Attribute metadata.\\n\\n@stable\\n\\nAttribute decorator and metadata.\\n\\n@stable\\n@Annotation\\n\\n\nThoughts:\n- We could ignore one of the declarations, but which one?\n- We create two documents but then they would have the same path and one would end up overwriting the other\n- Moreover it seems that now that we have dropped the [Decorator]Metadata term, the current processing to extract decorator docs is going to be broken as it relied on the ...Metadata suffix to find the symbol that contained the information about the properties for the component.\n. Currently, on angular.io, the interface version of Attribute is lost anyway. The only doc rendered is https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/core/index/Attribute-var.html\n. OK, so here is thing: TypeScript allows \"compatible\" declarations to be merged into a single symbol. So interface and const can be merged. The resulting symbol has all the symbols of both types.\nA type can have a valueDeclaration, which is the first declaration that is a \"value\" type, e.g. class, function, enum, const, etc, rather than a non-value, such as interface,typedef, etc.\nUp to now we just concatenate the docs from each declaration into a single doc, which interestingly is what TypeScript does too - you can see so in the IDE intellisense.\nI am going to update the dgeni-packages/typescript package to only take one of the declarations as the primary document, but then attach the other declarations to that doc via an additionalDeclarations property. This should prevent the doc-gen from blowing up and give us access to the other declarations.\nThe declaration that will be taken for the primary doc will be the valueDeclaration if there is one, or declarations[0] otherwise.\n. This should be fixed now, right?\n. LGTM\n. Rebased and fixed up testing\n. Rebasing and looking into a potential Travis error.. @wardbell I accidently caused this to close from a commit message in angular/angular. You might want to reopen this.. LGTM\n. This  is because the source code docs are in the wrong place.\nSee this commit for a similar fix by @vsavkin for ContentChildren https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/b6287ccc5126da9c1a052bd28b3a9e2743f67eae\n. The version is acquired by the git dgeni-package from the package.json. So it makes sense that the version number will be the same as that found in the package.json.\n. The only difference between the version shown in the API docs compared to the cheatsheet could be that in API templates we have :\n{$ versionInfo.currentVersion.isSnapshot and versionInfo.currentVersion.SHA or versionInfo.currentVersion.raw $}\nwhereas in the cheatsheet we have\n{$ doc.version.currentVersion | json | ... $}\n(where doc.version is the same versionInfo object as above)\n. That was quick @Foxandxss \n. If upgrade.bootstrap should run inside the NgZone then we should just make sure it does so by changing that method. Moving the call of the method elsewhere seems like a workaround, no?. OK we have spoken and I understand the problem. The first port of call is to update the docs and explain why it was wrong. We are going to change the library to throw an error if they do it the then way.\nI will send in a PR tomorrow for the docs.. I have a branch ready to fix this but I was holding off because I didn't have a good solution for the dual router situation. If we agree to remove that from the guide, then we can merge my branch.. See https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/16409. We are going to work on a valid solution to dual router but I am not sure what it will be yet.\nIn the meantime, to avoid confusion I would like to remove this stuff from the guide.. You also get to clear out the directive at https://github.com/angular/angular.io/blob/master/public/resources/js/directives/cheatsheet.js. For aio I think we should capture the HTML and then use the migrator to manually copy it into the air content folder as part of the migration processing. That will free you up to do what you want in angular.io. I think my IDE automatically removes those when I save. Ignore this file. It needs to be regenerated \n. there was a bug in the new inline tag def processor that we need for the target package and is fixed in 0.11.1\n. This block should actually be moved to tools/api-builder/angular.io-package/index.js\n. This adds the cheatsheet to the navigation under the Dart bit of the site - you might not want to do this yet\n. This adds the cheatsheet to the navigation under the JS bit of the site - you might not want to do this yet\n. We probably need a more automated way of specifying the version number of Angular in these (all three) cheatsheet.jade files\n. Note that we now have a nice Angular directive to display the cheatsheet\n. This file is not needed, right?\n. The Location classes have been moved to platform/browser : https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/modules/angular2/src/platform/browser/location/location.ts\n. I am pretty sure that, in addition you can also add an ignore flag:\n{ name: 'Annotation', ignore: true };\n. See https://github.com/angular/dgeni-packages/blob/master/jsdoc/processors/parse-tags.js#L92\n. readTypeScriptModules not required?\n. This is hard coded here but is a constant in the index.js file. Perhaps it should be passed as some kind of property or dependency?\n. Right, so you can remove this parameter\n. Oops wrong doc-type\n. oops that needs to go\n. I don't like doing the replacement here in the code.\nWe don't necessarily know at this point what the output rendering file format would be...\nIt is better to do the escaping in the template at /angular.io/tools/api-builder/angular.io-package/templates/api-list-data.template.html\n. Here is my fix for this: https://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/2324\n. OK. I think this is your problem @juleskremer \nThe whitespace after the :marked mixin is not allowed. And maybe here too.

Thanks for the hard work on this release, Ward.\nI'm a little disappointed that the \"quickstart\" has become much longer and less \"quick\" (see eg. https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/6536 where users point out that it is already taking much more than five minutes)\nBut I know you understand the alternatives and trust your judgement on it.\n. @wardbell changed the quickstart section to include the es6-shim typing in the original app, so using Promise later would type-check. I'll let Ward confirm if that's the solution here.\n. looks like a transient error, I am able to fetch https://api.typings.org/entries/dt/node/tags/6.0.0%2B20160621231320 right now.\nAlso we should use npm to fetch typings now that TypeScript supports it.\n. @alexwolfe I think Igor's above comment is for you. yes, test that it works if you already have an earlier one installed?\n. we don't have a release pushed to CDN yet?\n. done\n. added\nOn Thu, May 7, 2015 at 6:36 PM Rado Kirov notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nIn public/docs/js/latest/quickstart.jade\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/97#discussion_r29911723:\n\npre.prettyprint\n     $ npm install -g typescript@^1.5.0-beta\n-    $ tsc --watch\n-    $ tsc --watch -m commonjs -t es5 app.ts\n\n--emitDecoratorMetadata\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/97/files#r29911723.\n.

This issue was moved to dart-lang/site-webdev#258. @alexwolfe - is an automated way of doing this still in the works?\n. @luisvt : sorry, but we've adopted a new approach to generating the Dart versions of the dev guide chapters (see #1305) so this PR will not be merged.\nOn the other hand, I am currently reviewing your code contribution in #1171.\n. Under beta.17, a pub build yields:\n```\nLoading source assets...\nLoading angular2/transform/codegen, dart_to_js_script_rewriter, observe and smoke/src/default_transformer transformers...\nLoading angular2 transformers...\nBuilding server_communication...\nMissing identifier \"BrowserClient\" needed by \"HeroService\" from metadata map\nMissing identifier \"BrowserClient\" needed by \"TohComponent\" from metadata map\nCompiling server_communication|web/main.dart...\nweb/main.ngfactory.dart:8:1:\nCan't read 'package:server_communication/toh/toh_component.ngfactory.dart' (Could not find asset server_communication|lib/toh/toh_component.ngfactory.dart.).\nimport 'package:server_communication/toh/toh_component.ngfactory.dart' as i1;\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nweb/main.dart:\n```\nThis problem (\"Missing identifier ...\"), and its solution are documented in https://github.com/angular/angular/wiki/Angular-2-Dart-Transformer#resolved_identifiers\nThe app works once more after updating the pubspec.yaml to (only excerpts shown):\nname: server_communication ...\ndependencies:\n  angular2: 2.0.0-beta.17 ...\ntransformers:\n- angular2: ...\n    resolved_identifiers:\n        BrowserClient: 'package:http/browser_client.dart'\nFixed in #1219.\ncf. https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/8189\n. This issue was moved to dart-lang/site-webdev#255. On a related note, would it not be preferable to have a single \"top-level\" glossary, rather than the current situation in which the glossary happens to be a chapter in the basic dev. guide? If I understand the current issue reported here, migrating the glossary to the top-level may help address this problem.\n. The redirects seem like the right way to go. \n@wardbell : Have you tested #1836 with an actual deploy? Under firebase v2 it might accept the \"type\", but using v3 is gives an error:\nError: hosting.rewrites[4] additionalProperty \"type\" exists in instance when not allowed\nRemoving both \"type\": 301 entries allows the deploy to proceed.\nHopefully Naomi can deploy and we can confirm that the 301 redirects work.\n@naomiblack : when will angular.io be migrating to firebase v3 (if at all)? It nicely supports host aliases which makes it much easier for non-googlers to deploy to firebase (without editing the firebase.json file every time).\n\nBtw, while there are currently no visibly broken links in the glossary, the Dart side glossary entries redirect to the TS-side glossary (which is wrong) - #1838. So, if once the 301 redirect has been confirmed to work then we'll be able to fix that.\n. Btw, #1832 was fixing other issues, but in that PR I change the public/docs/{ts,dart}/latest/guide/glossary.jade as follows:\ndiff\n- != partial(\"../glossary\")\n+ include ../glossary\nI don't think that there is any reason to favor the Harp import (via partial) vs the Jade include. In fact, using Jade allows proper file paths to be used in makeExample mixins (rather than the path hacks that used to be there like makeExample('../docs/_fragments/architecture/ts/app/app.component.ts', ...).\n.

The edits are relatively minor.\n. @Foxandxss : thanks for reviewing. The Jade blocks define text (usually a few paragraphs) that are potential points of variation between the doc versions (TS, Dart, JS); a bit like class methods which can be overridden in a subclass. In this case, for the Dart docs, we extend the TS doc and override the blocks with Dart specific text.\n. @filipesilva : np, thanks.\n. @thso: all done with the suggested changes --- except for adding return types to methods whose supertype signatures leave the return type implicitly dynamic.\n. @kwalrath : actually, my intention was to remove that phrase fragment (done).\n. @kwalrath : actually, my intention was to remove that phrase fragment (done).\n.

Btw, the stability badge seems a bit more verbose than it needs to be. Can we drop the \"Stability:\" prefix, and just write the stability status?\n. It runs nicely :) ... below is an excerpt of the output showing how ts pipes passes but it fails for Dart (because my PR on Dart pipes hasn't landed yet).

I'll DRY it up now and push a delta.\n. All DRY'd up! (And I ensured that it still works over TS and Dart tests.)\n. To run the Dart tests you need to include the **--lang=dart`** flag, e.g.:\nrun-e2e-tests --filter=pipe --lang=dart\nWithout that flag it runs the test like it did before (I didn't want to change the default behavior). \nOf course, to be able to build the app (and transpiles it JS so that it runs in Chrome), you'll need to have:\n- Dart SDK installed with the \n- Dart bin in your path.\n. Oh, I just realized that the sample output I provided showed test being run from both TS and Dart (I fixed that now). Sorry, about that, it must have been from a run before I reverted to the behavior I mentioned above (i.e., run-e2e-tests without arguments still only runs just the tests it did before).\n. > I'm ok with accepting this PR on your say-so, \nGreat!\n\nhaving established that it does no harm to the TS/JS tests.\n\nI believe that there is no impact on the TS/JS tests. (FYI, part of my motivation for the original non-DRY version of this change was to make it really obvious that there was no impact on the TS/JS side.)\n\ngreat thing if we routinely ran the tests over TS/JS/Dart as part of our routine practice\n\nI agree. In fact, I think that we should get the docs under Travis CI!  Then we could ensure that for every submitted PR all tests pass.\n\nI'd be game to install Dart\n\nHere are the Windows installation instructions.\n. @Foxandxss: thanks for confirming that it works for you too!\n@wardbell: now that Jesus has confirmed that it works for him, could you merge this in? I suggest that we work through your environment setup issues separately (for which I would be glad to help).\nBtw, have you updated PATH to include the path to the Dart executables? Assuming that chocolatey has its own bin directory, I think that you need to execute a command similar to what is given on the Chocolatey home page:\nSET PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\chocolatey\\bin\n. Great! We're one step closer to being ready for Travis CI (for all 3 languages)!\n. Btw, good catch for the js tests. Thanks.\nAnd good improvement: to add \"all\".\n. Glad you like it.\nYes, I have been looking for ways to avoid using too much Jade vs markdown. The limitations we currently face are:\n1) While Jade string interpolation #{...} works in markdown, tag interpolation #[...] does not. This is a limitation because mixins can only be interpolated via #[...].\n2) The smallest unit of markdown that can be used in conditionals is the paragraph. E.g.\njade\n:marked\n  some initial text\n- if (some condition)\n  :marked\n    conditionally included text\n:marked\n  more text\nRenders as separate paragraphs like this:\n\nsome initial text\nconditionally included text\nmore text\n\nWhich is fine when each fragment is meant to be a stand alone paragraph, but sometimes, the prose to be conditionally included is just a word/phrase/statement within a paragraph. Like this:\n\nsome initial text conditionally included text more text\n\nTo get intra-paragraph conditional inclusion of text requires that we fall back to using Jade elements. It used to be worse, but as I learn more Jade I have been finding better ways of avoiding mixing markdown and Jade elements. Hopefully that will get better over time.\n\nAll that being said, the more I work with it the more I find the Jade readable: e.g.\n``` jade\n:marked\n  # Title\nText text text text\n  Text text text text\n```\nin Jade becomes\njade\nh1 Title\np.\n  Text text text text\n  Text text #[code text] text\nWhich seems as readable, but with one less level of indentation :).\n. @wardbell: it would be much easier for @kwalrath and me to follow the adjustments (beyond copyedits) you make if they are in a separate PR. Or, just make inline comments to the original PR source files and then I can make the edits.\nThat way it gives us a chance to discuss edits (beyond simple copyedits). Generally your edits are good (e.g. fixed links), but I do have some questions/remarks: e.g.,\n- Why did you choose to exclude the \"DOWNLOAD THE SOURCE\" call out for Dart? Is it because you want Dart users to work harder ;).\n- You renamed \"Step 0\" to \"Prerequisite\", but with the new title, this clashes with the fact that we instruct users to \"install\" s/w rather than just list it. Btw, the \"Step 0\" convention, is a convention adopted in most Dart tutorials.\n- You repositioned the \"DOWNLOAD THE SOURCE\" to be immediately after the \"Install Node.js...\" which could mislead some readers. I suggest either putting this callout before the \"Step 0/Prerequisite\" step or at the start of Step 1.\n- FYI, makeExcerpt will, by default, have no line numbers; so to appending (format=\".\") is unnecessary.\n- Speaking of line numbers, it has been my understanding that excerpts never show line numbers (to avoid confusing users), but that full examples do (so that users can more easily make reference to a specific line in the source if they wish to comment on it). Do you agree?\n. That has been my take on line numbers too.\n@wardbell : I'm ok with all of the changes you suggest I keep. As for the download exclusion, I mistakenly though that you had excluded it for some reason--- the Dart .jade file comment exclude this section from Dart threw me off. I understand now is that you were just focused on getting the TS prose done. I'll reintroduce the download for Dart.\n. Other than the one inlined comment made about moving a paragraph to the TS version, it LGTM.\n. Nice edits.\nBtw, rather than define an extra variable named _anAppDir, in the prose use: #{_an} #{_appDir}. The variables _a and _an are defined in public/_includes/_util-fns.jade (L18-21).\nOtherwise, LGTM.\n. @Foxandxss, @filipesilva, @wardbell : thoughts?\n. Will likely be addressed by #2762.\n. @tilwinjoy - see #2930. @tilwinjoy - as is mentioned in the README, this repo is closed. I'll let @wardbell comment on any possible followup to this request.. @kwalrath, @wardbell : can you have a look?\n. I agree about the name, but figured I run by the basic idea first. \nI originally thought of: makeEg as a short name (to represent that is takes the short argument list).\nOtherwise, makeProjExample? (I'm trying to keep the name reasonably short.)\n. Then makeProjExample it is.\n@kwalrath @wardbell : ready to merge.\n. I'd say that this is good to go. We can address the other issues in the next pass.\n. This issue was moved to dart-lang/site-webdev#253. @kwalrath : this impacts mainly the generated Dart docs (the TS docs will be essentially the same).\n. @kwalrath : ready for review.\n@wardbell : changes are minor and mostly Dart so up to you if you want to review as well.\n. This issue was moved to dart-lang/site-webdev#257. Working on it now.\n. @Foxandxss, @wardbell, @kwalrath, @thso : this is ready for review. As usual, it might be easiest to review while ignoring differences in whitespace.\n. @kwalrath : any updates on a review of the Dart-side prose?\n. I believe that I have addressed all of your concerns. (See my replies to specific line comments; in particular about expression chaining.)\n. @kwalrath : I pushed a new separate commit (adding a Dart difference call out), now that @vicb can confirmed the recommended style property naming scheme.\n. @kwalrath : can this be merged, if not what can I do to help make that happen? (I'd like to get the changes to _util-fns.jade for work on other chapter).\n. > Please hold on this project!\nOk. FYI, I am almost done (95%) with the dependency-injection chapter. I'll commit on Tuesday. Will hold off working on the other chapters until I hear news from you. \ncc: @kwalrath \n. We will no longer be implementing this new scheme.. @wardbell, @Foxandxss et al.: keeping things simple and dropping the recently introduced makeProjExample in favor of using only makeExample or makeExcerpt.\nFYI, I performed a diff of the generated site (www folder) before and after this PR and nothing changes -- actually, it fixes one bug in an example title on the Dart side, see below:\ncc: @kwalrath \n\ndiff -r of www before vs. after this PR:\n``` diff\ndiff -r -x cheatsheet.json www/docs/dart/latest/quickstart.html 20160524/www/docs/dart/latest/quickstart.html\n263c263\n< web/web/styles.css (excerpt)h1 {\n\n\nweb/styles.css (excerpt)h1 {\n```\n. @thso : done - either fixed issue or responded with feedback.\n. @johnpapa, @Foxandxss, @wardbell : thoughts?\n. Only #1523 remains. Closing this parent issue.. There is currently no plan to create a style guide. This was the only remaining subitem. Closing.. This issue was moved to dart-lang/site-webdev#261. @kwalrath, @thso : ready for review and merge.\n. Btw, another alternative to using an abstract class type name is to use a named function (closure) as a token.\n\ndart\nvoid APP_CONFIG_TOKEN() {}\n. This issue was moved to dart-lang/site-webdev#256. @Foxandxss @wardbell @thso @kwalrath : this is ready for review. As usual, it is less painful to view the diff while ignoring changes in whitespace (such as indentation).\n. Updates done.\n\nLooks great! The only real problem I saw was the \"key benefits...\" paragraph\n\nThat paragraph has been reworked.\n. Updates done.\n. Address each of these parts of the docs:\n- [x] toh - #1596\n- [x] basics - #1598\n- [x] dev. guide (all done for those chapters that current exist on the Dart side).\n. All done. @kwalrath \n. A complete solution is on its way.\n. Once #1589, is in place, here is what we will be able to do:\n- Generate the same API entries that exist on the TS side\n- Each API page corresponds to a generated .jade file.\nThe Jade source files are setup much like the prose, and so we have access to language-specific \"macros\"; e.g. making the following change in angular/common/src/pipes/async_pipe.ts\ndiff\n- * The `async` pipe subscribes to an `Observable` or `Promise` and returns the latest value it has\n+ * The `async` pipe subscribes to !{_an} `!{_Observable}` or `!{_Promise}` and returns the latest value it has\nrenders as before on the TS side and on the Dart side we get\n\nThe async pipe subscribes to a Stream or Future and\n\nWith no other change to the API source, we also get @example entries like this:\n\n{@example core/pipes/ts/async_pipe/async_pipe_example.ts region='AsyncPipePromise'}\n\ncorrectly picking up Dart samples. (This is because such directives become makeExample entries which have been adapted to reinterpret paths based on the page language.)\nSo the main question to ask users if whether such an incremental improvement over having no API pages at all, would be useful enough.\nAs a next step I could work on getting proper Dart API signatures.\n. Superseded by #1880.\n. @Foxandxss : let me know once this is ready for review.\n. Starting to work on this.\ncc @kwalrath\n. Completed.\n. There is currently no plan to create a style guide.. All done.\ncc @kwalrath\n. @kwalrath : anything left to do here?\n. @kwalrath @Foxandxss @wardbell : minor update ready for review.\n. :) ... Link2 actually generates 2 links in Dart.\n. Anything else to do before this is merged?\n. I think that tsconfig.json is missing.\nDoes this supersede #1241? If so maybe #1241 should be closed.\n. I've identified the problem. Will fix shortly.\n. Oups, sorry, I had not read the full text of the issue before I signed off yesterday (and seen that you outlined the problem :). Will look into this shortly.\n. Temporarily fixed by manually changing the base href to\nhtml\n<base href=\"/toh-5/\">\nLet's leave this open until we find a permanent solution (where the dart-doc-syncer can generate the proper index.html).\n. Fixed by https://github.com/angular/dart-doc-syncer/pull/14.\n. I'm not sure how this came about. I noticed the problem only for some examples (e.g. toh-1 to 3). Just re-running the dart-doc-syncer fixed those. I am re-syncing all examples, so this issue is likely fully resolved.\n. All hosted Dart examples have been updated and I confirm that the \"main.dart not found\" error no longer occurs for any of the examples.\n. @kwalrath : Dart-only changes ready for review.\n. @wardbell @Foxandxss : TS-only (minor) changes, ready for review.\n. Ready to be merged then?\ncc @kwalrath \n. @kwalrath @wardbell @Foxandxss : ready for review.\n. @kwalrath : ready for review.\n. @kwalrath @Foxandxss @wardbell : ready for review.\n.

QS is such a simple application, it doesn't seem appealing to have two long chapters dedicated to it. With two full chapters, there is, inevitably, (unnecessary?) repetition of some of the information. (My 2 cents)\n. Quickstart CLI is now part of the site. Closing.. @AlmeroSteyn - e2e tests are failing because the ts compiler is reporting errors. Can you investigate and fix the issues?\n\ncc @naomiblack @wardbell \n. All: @AlmeroSteyn isn't currently available. As agreed discussed with @wardbell via slack: @Foxandxss or @filipesilva could you look into upgrading the code from use of ng beta/rc to 2.1.x?\n. Extending this issue to also cover toh-6 proof read.\n. Sorry, the TS-side change was for the glossary: I originally needed to add a new #docregion tag to use in the Dart-side glossary file. While in there I made some minor copy edits related to the \"*-case\" entries.\n@kwalrath @thso : ready for your review.\n. The snake_case entry went in with the toh-3 changes (#1629). You need to rebuild the docs to get it to be picked up. I just did that and it works -- see below.\n\n. No, it would not mess anything up. I think that Jesus was commenting about a potentially unnecessary extra line (i.e., have two #enddocregion tags instead of one).\n. You are correct. The source of the problem is that QuickStart fails to mention the needed core/common directives. I'll update that soon.\ncc @kwalrath \n. You are correct.

Hi Fabian: please continue to report such issues; this kind of feedback is greatly appreciated :).\nYou are right, there is a switch in name.

Btw, AFAIK, this has nothing to do pushState, although it is correct that pub serve doesn't play nice with routes, by default. I'm looking into this now.\n. @kwalrath : we should probably close this issue as a duplicate of #1919.\n. @Foxandxss : very minor change is ready for review and merge.\n. Temporary files generated by Emacs during editing. \n. Actually, I don't think that we should be watching any dot files, but in particular not autosave files. Maybe that line can be changed simply to **/.?*. Let me know what you prefer.\n. FYI, I changed it to **/.?*.\n. Actually, this still isn't solving my original problem (of getting browser page refreshes when Emacs does an auto-file backup). So I'll close this for now.\n. @kwalrath @Sfshaza @thso : ready for review and merge.\n. @Foxandxss : ready for review and merge.\ncc @kwalrath \n. Yes. E.g., toh-pt6.jade will soon have:\njade\n- var _example = 'toh-6';\nat the top. Then the functions and mixins in the _utls-fns.jade files can uniformly call getExapleName() without concern of the means by which the name is obtained.\n. Subsumed by #1686 (since this was a necessary change for toh-6).\n. @zoechi: if you don't have a fix in the works, I'll be cleaning this up long the lines of #2164 once it lands. Let me know.\ncc @kwalrath \n. @Foxandxss: there is the TS side PR, but this morning you notified me that there would be Dart-side work to be done. Are you saying there is already a PR for Dart? If so, I'm not finding it.\n. This issue was moved to dart-lang/site-webdev#262. @Foxandxss : ready for review and merge.\n. Really, that's it? (I wonder why that didn't work for me.) Anyhow, fantastic! I can't wait to start using async/await. The test code will be much more readable when using it!\n. On a separate but related note: will it be possible to use async/await in the sample TS code? Maybe with the arrival of TS 2.0?\n. Ah, yes, those were the errors I was getting. Glad you caught that too.\n. @kwalrath @Foxandxss @johnpapa @wardbell : ready for review. As usual, because of the addition of blocks causes changes in indentation, it is best to review changes by ignoring whitespace, like this. Please see the original PR comment for a description of changes (besides copyedits).\ncc @thelgevold \n. @kwalrath @Foxandxss : thank you both for reviewing this.\n@naomiblack : it would be great if this could be merged before @johnpapa starts carving out the CLI editions.\n. I was reviewing my notes and noticed I had forgotten to remove an unnecessary change to a .css, relative to toh-5 (new #docregion that wasn't used). I just pushed a commit with that change.\n. @kwalrath : rebased.\nHi @Adam-Meisen : while it is true that sample.css is not mentioned in the prose, using a sample.css file is a convention followed in other chapters in the Dev Guide and the Cookbook.\nIt may make sense, as you have proposed, to merge the sample.css styles into one of the component's styles, but before doing so it may make sense to determine if there was a reason for doing it the way it is now.\n. Adam: btw, I agree with your observations, including the idea of eliminating the sample.css file as you have proposed already. I was just suggesting that we (docs team, including myself) first take a broader look to understand why the current approach exists both for this chapter and the other chapters. (As to the lack of mention of sample.css, that could be quickly fixed by adding an appropriate sentence to the prose.)\n. No worries (I could have been clearer from the start). Thanks for that info.\n. @kwalrath @thso : ready for review. Can only be merged after #1686.\ncc @Foxandxss @wardbell @johnpapa \n.

Fri Jun 17 16:00:31 2016\n```\n. @kwalrath @thso : ready for review and merge.\n. I have made some specific line comments. Please address those.\nAs I mentioned elsewhere, I like your proposal, but I'll need to discuss this with some of the doc team elders to find out the history of the sample.css files used in the various chapters.\ncc @kwalrath \n. @Adam-Meisen : oh, I thought that this had been merged already! \nCould you rebase? Then I'll review and see if we can get this merged.\n. Hmm, just realized that this might need a little more work. Let me investigate and get back to you, @Adam-Meisen.\n. @Adam-Meisen Thanks for the rebase. Getting close! Notice that sample.css has two new styles, and they are now being lost. Could you add them to a (new) hero-search.component.css file, adjust the component, etc?\n. It's looking good other than the minor changes I pointed out in the line comments.\n. Some edits just landed for toh-6. One more rebase to do.\n. @Foxandxss @wardbell : LGTM. Tests are passing. Can we please merge this before the RC5 wave?\n. @filipesilva @Foxandxss : as you may recall I had a broken local environment before I went away last week. Now things are back in order, after following the setup in the travis config file (thanks for the suggestion @filipesilva). This PR just makes it easier to do so (since I don't expect that we have seen the last of a change in typings :).\nBtw, if you agree with the changes proposed in this PR, then maybe we should update the README.md to reflect this new way of setting up / refreshing a local repo. We could then also add that no PR should be submitted unless lint is happy and all e2e tests pass.\n. Travis is all green.\nStrangely, when I run the tests locally, I get two failures:\nSuites failed:\n  public/docs/_examples/pipes/ts\n  public/docs/_examples/user-input/ts\nBut when I perform the failed test cases manually, I observe the desired behavior. Maybe the tests are failing because protractor isn't waiting for the actions to complete?  (Btw, the same tests pass in Dart.)  Any ideas why the tests are failing locally?\n. @Foxandxss : thanks for confirming that those are known failures (FMI, is there an issue open to track this)?\n@filipesilva : thanks for clarifying the situation under Windows. Note that this PR does help macOS and linux folks :) ... without making things any worse under Windows, as far as I understand.\n. @filipesilva : FYI, --prefix is needed for the webdriver:update command.\n. The webdriver:update can be set in the format of the others, but it doesn't need to.\nWhen used with install, the \"--prefixpath\" causes node_modules to be output under path, but I think it still picks up the package.json from the local directory --- at least that is the behavior I saw under macOS ... and the reason why I changed the install commands.\n. @Foxandxss : FYI, still an issue as of 07/28.\n. Disabling problematic tests for now via #2068.\n. @Foxandxss : FYI, still an issue as of 07/28.\n. Fixed by #2065.\n. @kwalrath @Foxandxss : ready for review.\n. I ran the tests (as mentioned in the initial comment), but you are welcome to confirm the results; here is the command to run from the angular.io repo root:\ngulp run-e2e-tests --fast --lang=all --filter=attribute-directives\nDo we have a build-and-compare target somewhere?\n. @kwalrath: ready for review.\n. @kwalrath : ready for review.\n. By design, comment will never be null (if/once non-null types are implemented, the analyzer will be able confirm claims like these :).\n. @kwalrath : ready for review.\n. @kwalrath : ready for review.\n. @kwalrath : ready for review and merge.\n. I decided to submit all together the toh issues found by the new e2e tests. I.e., this is now subsumed by #1785.\n. @Foxandxss @filipesilva @kwalrath @thso : ready for review.\n. Do you mean \"overkill\" in the sense that too much functionality is being tested?\n. On the good side, the tests did uncover (minor) problems with the apps. :)\n. Right, this is a special case. The given module breakdown allows toh-2, -3, and -4 to reuse the same tests (because the app changes are only internal). This makes for DRY tests.\n. The alternative would be to copy-paste tests, which I think we prefer not doing.\n. Thanks for pointing out page objects (the getPageElts() was a crude approximation of using a page object); it is nice to know about that idiom.\nIs there any chance that this might get reviewed and merged before the long week-end? :)\n. @wardbell : thanks for the feedback. Allow me to defend this approach one last time (in case it might waver your opinion). I generally agree with you points (e.g., if this were test infrastructure sharing between unrelated chapters), but:\n- The toh parts are semantically bound; they are a progression by design.\n- If ever a scenario like the one you described occurs (making changes to tests for toh-x breaks the tests for toh-y), then the fix is easy:\n  - copy-paste shared files to break the coupling between toh-x and toh-y.\nGiven the tight coupling between the toh parts, by design, I believe that sharing some test infrastructure has more benefits than risks. And essentially what you are asking me to do now is to proactively ditch the DRYness rather than do it down the line if/when it is needed. My 2 cents. Let me know what you think.\n. I understand your reasons. Will split this up into two PRs (fixes vs e2e tests) and make the e2e tests independent as you recommend. Thanks for hearing me out.\n. Superseded by #1934, #1936, #1938, #1939, #1940.\n. @mprobst : changes submitted in a new \"post-review\" commit. \n(Note that I also cleaned up makeExamples, changing most of them to makeExcerpt).\n. Good catch, thanks.\n@thelgevold could you fix this?\n/cc @wardbell @Foxandxss \n. @kwalrath @thso : Dart-side commit ready for review.\n@Foxandxss @wardbell : TS-side commit ready for review. As usual, it is best to review the .jade file while ignoring changes in indentation. Note that most of the TS Jade file edits were from Kathy's work from a while back.\n. Dart-side issues addressed.\n. @Foxandxss : please see my response to your line comment. Otherwise, are we good to go on this one?\n. @wardbell : thanks for the feedback. I believe that all of your concerns have been addressed in the last commit (https://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/1807/commits/f38496f1a11831da67d772bb7ab2d1766830fe25). Let me know if there is anything else.\n. This issue was moved to dart-lang/site-webdev#263. @naomiblack @mprobst @kwalrath : here is a Dart version of the security guide. It occurred to me that 2/3 of the chapter content was currently relevant, and so here it is :).\nAs usual, if you want to see the TS-side .jade file differences, it is best to ignore whitespace, either by following this file-diff link or appending ?w=1 to your URL when you are viewing the diff on GitHub. You will notice that the TS-side .jade has very few changes: mainly just new block headers and a few change in docregion tag names.\n. HTML escaping is implemented (being such a basic feature). The rest of the Dart chapter are guidelines (which apply just as well to TS and Dart). The Dart chapter does not mention any unimplemented features. I think that there is value to our readers to include the security guidelines that are applicable & implemented now. (My 2 cents).\n. @Foxandxss - latest news I had was the the requisite security functionality was on its way (and might be completed); but there has been a rush to prepare things for the Dart Summit next week so I'm not sure when this will get approved.\n. @filipesilva - thanks, for closing this PR.\n- #3017 covers TS changes\n- Dart side updates will be tracked via https://github.com/dart-lang/site-webdev/pull/270. @kwalrath : as agreed, added a statement of caveat.\n. Btw, I tried to regenerate the cheat sheet JSON file from Ng Dart's beta.17, but was unsuccessful. So I decided to opt for our caveat option.\n. @Foxandxss @wardbell @kwalrath : ready for review. I think you'll agree that the markdown is easier on the eyes :).\n. @Foxandxss @wardbell @kwalrath : ready for review. As usual, it is best viewed by ignoring whitespace diffs.\n. Fixed and committed.\n. LGTM!\n. @filipesilva @Foxandxss @wardbell : ready for review.\n. FYI, I just added a tweak that ties in with the standard gulp --silent flag.\n. I had missed setting the logging level for createShredMapPackage. Just added that now in a separate commit.\n. @Foxandxss @wardbell @kwalrath : ready for review.\nHere are the ngio docs related warnings:\nwarn:    Invalid example (unable to locate fragment file: \"public/docs/_fragments/dependency-injection/ts/app/app.config-config-alt.ts.md\") - doc - from file \"dart/latest/guide/dependency-injection.jade\"\nwarn:    Invalid example (unable to locate fragment file: \"public/docs/_fragments/toh-5/dart/web/index-router.html.md\") - doc - from file \"dart/latest/tutorial/toh-pt5.jade\"\nwarn:    Invalid example (unable to locate fragment file: \"public/docs/_fragments/app/in-memory-data.service-init.ts.md\") - doc - from file \"ts/latest/tutorial/toh-pt6.jade\"\nwarn:    Invalid example (unable to locate fragment file: \"public/docs/_fragments/app/heroes.component-delete.html.md\") - doc - from file \"ts/latest/tutorial/toh-pt6.jade\"\nAnd here are the ng API doc example warnings (that were repeated for TS):\nwarn:    Invalid example (unable to locate fragment file: \"public/docs/_fragments/_api/platform/dom/debug/ts/by/by-by_all.ts.md\") - doc - from file \"js/latest/api/platform-browser/index/By-class.jade\"\nwarn:    Invalid example (unable to locate fragment file: \"public/docs/_fragments/_api/platform/dom/debug/ts/by/by-by_css.ts.md\") - doc - from file \"js/latest/api/platform-browser/index/By-class.jade\"\nwarn:    Invalid example (unable to locate fragment file: \"public/docs/_fragments/_api/platform/dom/debug/ts/by/by-by_directive.ts.md\") - doc - from file \"js/latest/api/platform-browser/index/By-class.jade\"\nwarn:    Invalid example (unable to locate fragment file: \"public/docs/_fragments/_api/router/ts/can_activate/can_activate_example-canActivate.ts.md\") - doc - from file \"js/latest/api/router-deprecated/index/CanActivate-decorator.jade\"\nwarn:    Invalid example (unable to locate fragment file: \"public/docs/_fragments/_api/router/ts/can_deactivate/can_deactivate_example-routerCanDeactivate.ts.md\") - doc - from file \"js/latest/api/router-deprecated/index/CanDeactivate-interface.jade\"\nwarn:    Invalid example (unable to locate fragment file: \"public/docs/_fragments/_api/router/ts/reuse/reuse_example-reuseCmp.ts.md\") - doc - from file \"js/latest/api/router-deprecated/index/CanReuse-interface.jade\"\nwarn:    Invalid example (unable to locate fragment file: \"public/docs/_fragments/_api/router/ts/on_activate/on_activate_example-routerOnActivate.ts.md\") - doc - from file \"js/latest/api/router-deprecated/index/OnActivate-interface.jade\"\nwarn:    Invalid example (unable to locate fragment file: \"public/docs/_fragments/_api/router/ts/on_deactivate/on_deactivate_example-routerOnDeactivate.ts.md\") - doc - from file \"js/latest/api/router-deprecated/index/OnDeactivate-interface.jade\"\nwarn:    Invalid example (unable to locate fragment file: \"public/docs/_fragments/_api/router/ts/reuse/reuse_example-reuseCmp.ts.md\") - doc - from file \"js/latest/api/router-deprecated/index/OnReuse-interface.jade\"\nThe latter have been fixed via https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/9828.\n. Yes it fixes the toh fragment issues. And you are correct: those were fine in the rendered site HTML. The problem arose in the fragment cross referencer which Ward said we will likely be using once again in the future (cf. this comment).\n. @Foxandxss @wardbell @kwalrath : ready for review.\n. Closed by #2100\n. @kwalrath @Foxandxss : ready for review (ping Ward about it if you think that he needs to be involved).\n. cc @kwalrath @Foxandxss @wardbell : with this change, and the latest PRs that fix the broken links, only two broken links remain (as reported elsewhere). Ready for review and merge.\n. As of this commit (and once https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/9873 gets merged on the ng side), there are no more warnings issued when generating the API docs. To try it out yourself use either one of these commands:\ngulp build-api-docs --dgeni-log=warn\ngulp build-api-docs --silent\n@wardbell @Foxandxss : ready for review.\ncc: @kwalrath @naomiblack \n. Oh, this PR is built atop (though it is independent of) #1833. It just means that #1833 should be merged in first. I kept #1833 because @petebacondarwin gave some feedback on it, and I didn't want to loose a trace of that.\n. Superseded by #1849, #1860.\n(One more feature it to be excerpt before closing.)\n. LGTM. Lovely clean design!\nSupersedes #1846 (to be refactored and closed soon).\n. Great to see this move forward!  Please see my comments below.\n\nThe check-deploy --dry-run essentially just does a harp compile. Defining and using a simpler target might make sense (in fact, I've been using such a target in my Dart API work):\njs\ngulp.task('check', ['build-docs'], function() {\n  return harpCompile();\n});\nNote that scripts/install.sh is now part of our instructions to developers on how to install/reset their workspace. Could you ensure that you keep a copy of this file?\nActually, I think that we can simplify the situation by having a single install.sh script with conditional logic inside (defaulting to the install steps we had before). To accomplish this we might need a matrix something like this:\nyml\nenv:\n  ...\n  matrix:\n    - TASK=lint\n    - TASK='e2e --fast' PREVIEW=false\n    - TASK='e2e --fast' PREVIEW=true\n    - TASK='check' PREVIEW=false\n    - TASK='check' PREVIEW=true\nmatrix:\n  ...\n  allow_failures:\n    - env: \"TASK='e2e --fast' PREVIEW=true\"\n    - env: \"TASK='check' PREVIEW=true\"\n...\ninstall:\n  - ./scripts/install.sh\nThen scripts/install.sh could have conditional logic based on the value of TASK. This is just a suggestion, but having a single install.sh file also makes it easier to assess the installation variants.\nBtw, eventually we may also want to add checks on the output produced by the harp compile command to help determine if the check was truly successful or not.\nLooking forward to having this in master.\n. LGTM\n. FYI, on the Dart side, we've broken down the Router guide into sections; e.g.: the main router page leads to milestone pages, like this one for milestone 1. Each milestone page has a dropdown to help navigation (since the side nav has a limit on the depth of entries). We'll likely rework the guide again at some point soon. I like your topic breakdown above!\ncc @kwalrath . @wardbell @Foxandxss : ready for review.\n. I forgot to mention that to build the docs do: an install (which patches terraforma), and then check-deploy.\nPrerequisite: Ensure that you have the angular.io and Angular/Dart repos repos in the same directory, and the later must be named angular-dart --- if it isn't just create a link with that name pointing to the actual repo.\nCommands:\nSetup\nbash\n./scripts/before-install.sh\n./scripts/install.sh # this script now does the necessary patching\nIf you just want to build the Dart API docs:\nbash\ngulp build-dart-api-docs --dgeni-log=warn  # drop the flag if you want `info` level messages as usual\ngulp serve # to see the results at http://localhost:9000/\nIf you want to build all the docs:\nbash\ngulp check-deploy --dgeni-log=warn  # drop the flag if you want `info` level messages as usual\n. I chose to leave out the dropdown because IMHO maintaining a complete dart <-> ts/js mapping might be tricky and not really worth the effort (we can open a separate issue as a \"feature request\" so that we can track discussion about it). Leaving the dropdown there with only Dart is a good idea. I'll look into it.\n. @filipesilva @Foxandxss @wardbell : I just rebased. Note the following change:\n- Renamed 'harp-compile' to 'check' (as in check-deploy without the deploy :).\n- Created new 'harp-compile' that only does a harp compile; i.e., doesn't depend on 'build-docs' (where as 'check' does).\nThis makes it easier to selectively rebuild only parts of the docs and then quickly get harp to start compiling.\n. @kwalrath : I've created #1895 for the API page language-cross-referencing issue. I'd like to suggest that nothing be done in the scope of this PR. We can explore the range of alternative solutions via #1895 and a follow up PR. Thoughts?\n. @wardbell : named changed to build-compile.\nMore install / travis / gulpfile changes are on their way (to support Dart API docs building). I'll update the README then.\n. Design note (cc @petebacondarwin): while originally I started writing a dgeni package for Dart API processing, I ran into problems -- due to my lack of mastery of the dgeni framework --- and so, in the hopes of making some progress, I switched to building a stand alone transformer from the dgeni package parts. Maybe this can be revised later, or, I might just write a revised API page generator in Dart :).\n. I can think of a new xref scheme that will work ~80% of the time. For now we might want to go for that and for the remaining 20% just say that no correspondence can be found.\n. Recent upgrade to harp version fixed this. Now all we need to do is remove the path script.\n. Fixed by #2754.\n. @filipesilva @Foxandxss @wardbell @kwalrath : ready for review. Note that I have not touched the travis config.\n. > is it possible to run dart specific tasks via the CI at the moment?\nNot at the moment. That is part of what I will be working on next.\n. LGTM\n. Fixed by #1910.\n. @filipesilva @Foxandxss @wardbell : ready for review. Note that the extra wait for the doc generation only seems to be necessary when full logging is enabled; currently the logging level is set to warn, and doc generation takes ~20 min. (Otherwise I've seen it take ~40 min, though I'm not sure why there is such a difference).\ncc: @kwalrath \n. Thanks for your feedback.\n\n\nThe new WAIT env var strikes me as a red flag, why is it needed?\n\n\nSee my previous comment.\n\nHaving hardcoded waits is usually a brittle breaking point, \n\nIt is no more brittle than the current default 10 min max.\n\nor at the very least something that will overall delay CI.\n\nYes, it may.\n\nWhat are all these travis_fold commands? \n\nThey help make the output manageable by having the output between start and end sections contained within a \"fold\" (headed by triangles in the left margin of the output).\n\nWon't this immediately break if I try to run the scripts locally?\n\nNo, a value is always defined for the function, see env-set.sh.\n\nThat sounds like a problem for using these scripts anywhere but travis.\n\nI suggest we follow what is done for the angular project and actually put all travis scripts in a separate folder so that it is understood that they are meant to be used for travis ... and might work locally, but that is not their primary purpose.\n\nSeems like a lot of environment variables need to be set, \n\nNot any more than those for angular.\n\nwhich also sounds like it can be problematic for local runs.\n\nThese scripts are in support for Travis CI. I had assumed that when testing locally, doc developers would already have the necessary repos available as peers to the ng.io repo.\n\nDart now seems a .hard requirement for running deploy-install.sh, which means that I wouldn't be able to run it right now whereas before I could.\n\nIt runs fine in a Travis CI environment. Of course, I could make some parts be conditionally applied in a Travis environment only, and/or the presence of Dart tooling.\nCurrently, angular.io is the home to ng2 docs of all flavors, and under that premise, it seems essential to build all the docs as part of CI. Maybe I've been misdirected in my goal, any thoughts about this, @naomiblack?\nThe next steps, IMHO, include adding checks for broken links, etc. For that we want to do a whole site analysis.\n. > I like the idea of a travis scripts folder, but would be worried that it would lead either repetition or having some scripts only there. Do you suppose we can have some middle ground ...\nYes, agreed. It would help to know which scripts are run locally. I was under the impression that scripts/deploy-install.sh would be used only for CI (given that most doc developers, IMHO, would tend to manage repo cloning by a separate mechanism). If not, I can add some conditional logic.\n. Ok, thanks for the input on that. Let's see what can be done ... .\n. @filipesilva I have updated the scripts so that they can be run from the command line. I have moved out as much as I can from the env-set.sh script. Note that the examples-install scripts have not be touched. Please have a look.\n. Ah, that is because it isn't actually building the Dart docs. I needed to adjust the gulpfile to switch to the default of all languages for the tasks: fullSiteBuildTasks = ['build-compile', 'check-serve', 'check-deploy']. Done.\n. @wardbell : ok, this is good to go! :)\n. Great!\nBtw, @filipesilva @wardbell : if ever the extended timeout becomes an issue, we can always adjust the number. At least now the basic mechanism is is place so that all we need to do is change a number.\n. @kwalrath : ready for review. I'm unsure who else.\n@petebacondarwin : could you take a look at this new dgeni package? It is largely inspired by the TS cheatsheet package.\ncc @wardbell \n. This PR depends on #1910.\ntldr; Travis doc build is failing because I seem to have not fully turned off the Dart API and cheatsheet generation on Travis; but the cheatsheet is the subject of this PR. So, I think it will be simpler to just say that this PR depends on #1910. The build works locally, but once #1910 is merged, it should build successfully on Travis too.\n. > My feeling with this PR is that it is duplicating a lot of what is done to generate the cheatsheets for TS and JS.\nActually, I felt that this was a clean design that reused only the necessary pieces of the TS/JS doc processing chain.\n\nPerhaps there is some way of making that processing more generic to accommodate Dart as well?\n\nI thought of that too, but some of our other Dart work has been intrusive enough already. Have a separate package that reused TS-side components, seemed like the most TS friendly way to go.  One of the main problems is that cheatsheet generation on the TS side is interwoven with the API generation, when it doesn't need to be. If someone were to do a clean refactoring on the TS side, then indeed we could reuse that for Dart. Any volunteers :)\nAside from that, is this good to go?\n. @Foxandxss @wardbell : ready for review and merge.\n@almerosteyn: this should fix it.\ncc @kwalrath \n. I agree and debated that myself. I'm just worried that it is much easier to forget to put --dart when generating docs (and get no warning) than to forget --no-dart in other case (which will result in a friendly reminder being generated).\n@naomiblack, @kwalrath : any opinion about this?\n. As per @wardbell's suggestion (made elsewhere) I'll make all the default for full-site build tasks (like  check-deploy) and (ts|js) all other gulp targets.\n. As a means of addressing this issue, a PR enhancing pub serve has been submitted.\n. Btw, @kwalrath, I'm unsure why this was tagged with api. Maybe drop the api label and remove [API] from the title since this issue applies to a few chapters in the docs, though not to API docs themselves.\n. This issue was moved to dart-lang/site-webdev#252. @kwalrath ready for review. If viewed by ignoring changes in whitespace, you'll see that only two lines were changed in the TS .jade file.\n@wardbell : FYI ... I think it is safe for @kwalrath to merge given that there is no visible change on the TS side and it eliminates BAD FILENAME on the Dart side.\n. @wardbell @Foxandxss : ready for review. Jesus confirms that the toh-6 failure is a flake.\n. @kwalrath @wardbell @Foxandxss : ready for review.\n. @wardbell @Foxandxss : ready for review. Travis is green.\n. @wardbell @Foxandxss : ready for review.\n. @kwalrath @wardbell @Foxandxss : ready for review.\nI also did a minor cleanup, removing superfluous parentheses in the language regex.\n. Travis doc build is green. The failure is due to the e2e toh-6 flake.\n. Visit, say, Pipes, and then follow the PipeMetadata link in the Inheritance section. On ng.io it will bring up a page in dartdoc format. With this fix, it is in ng.io format.\n. Yes.\nAnything else to do before this is merged?\n. Hi, my bad for having chosen animate. When I made that edit a little while ago I was looking for three libraries that existed in both TS and Dart. Unfortunately, http doesn't exist on the Dart side (it does exists as a stand alone library, not a submodule of ng2).\nHow about using the following three: core, common and router, in that order?\ncc @kwalrath \n. I totally agree with your reasoning: having explicit return types helps readers figure out what is going on. And this brings the code a bit more aligned with the Dart version. I think the : void is appropriate (and not too verbose).\nOn the other hand, I find we have too many auxiliary \"documentation only\" source files, so I'd avoid creating toh-4/ts/app/hero.service.2.ts and just use hero.service.1.ts enhanced with an appropriate type annotation.\ncc @kwalrath \n. In follow-up to my last comment, this is the TS equivalent of what I did on the Dart side of the docs:\ntypescript\n  /*\n  // #docregion getHeroes-stub\n  getHeroes(): Hero[] { return []; }\n  // #enddocregion getHeroes-stub\n  */\n. Oups, my bad (I wasn't aware of that limitation in Safari). Thanks for the fix @ericjim. \n. Thanks, LGTM\n. LGTM, including the clean tweak to the directive and helper class to also support js examples!\n. I don't mind sticking with \"term\". I'll update searchSubject to searchTerms as agreed offline.\n. @wardbell : oups, sorry, I forgot to push to IdeaBlade (I forgot to not just hit publish in the GitHub app).\nBtw, Travis is green on my fork for the same commit.\n. Ah, right! Fixed: I've kept the 3 libraries for TS, but only include 2 for Dart (though I could have simply reduced it to two examples for all).\n. @kwalrath : updates pushed.\n. Yes, thanks for the detailed report @ben4ever.\n@kwalrath: this is one of the reasons why I am generally against docplaster. I would suggest just dropping docplaster so that it will be clear that there is more code than what is shown in the excerpt. Do you agree?\n. @kwalrath : have you decided how you would like to handle this? (E.g., dropping docplaster?)\n. My preference, atm, would be to leave this as is. Workarounds are possible but not worth it (esp. if that will become legal syntax :).\n. This is now legal syntax.. Given that beta.19 is mostly \"cleanup\" (no new functionality). I was going to wait beta.20 before updating the docs, and focus on other work in the meantime. Of course users can still use beta.20 from pub. Thoughts?\n. To regenerate the site after only a few minor changes to .jade or Harp data files, try using the --fast command line argument.\n. For the record: currently a check-deploy takes ~18 mins on my laptop, and ~15 with --fast, so that isn't much of a savings, but is 15 min. Is that too long? To reduce that further would involve performing the harp compilation itself piecewise.\n. Fixed by #2202.\n. FYI: a source side fix might be on its way into Angular: https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/10457.\n. Solved via https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/10457.\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. @kwalrath : ready for review and merge.\n. Follow-up changes done in #2037.\n. Migrated to https://github.com/dart-lang/site-webdev/issues/198. There are no broken links in the Dart docs. A separate issue has been opened to track the new TS/JS broken links, #2150.\n. @wardbell @Foxandxss : ready for review and merge.\ncc @kwalrath \n. cc @kwalrath @wardbell @Foxandxss \n. cc @kwalrath @wardbell\n. Closed via #2050.\n. cc @kwalrath @wardbell @Foxandxss : ready for review and merge. Note that this touches the shared gulpfile.js but (in theory) only impacts the Dart API build tasks.\n. cc @kwalrath @thso @matanlurey : ready for review and merge.\ncc @wardbell @Foxandxss : this is a Dart-only enhancement.\n. The main function is presented in two versions. I cannot make the change as you suggested; i.e., version 1 of main is correct as it stands. But I have added a comment in the final version of main:\n// Using a real back end? Import browser_client.dart and change the above to\n    // [provide(Client, useFactory: () => new BrowserClient(), deps: [])]\n. @Foxandxss @wardbell @filipesilva : this fixes the user-input e2e tests both locally and on Travis. Ready for review and merge.\n. Temporary measure in addressing  #1761.\n. Yes, closing it now is fine. I've migrated the issue to https://github.com/dart-lang/site-webdev/issues/368.. @Foxandxss @wardbell @kwalrath : as usual, it is best to view the diff while ignoring whitespace.\n. Yes, I had chosen to leave it out earlier, but since it is actually a target (#my-app), I figured that it made sense to include the \"heading\".\n. For the record, the <my-app> heading was removed (reverting to how things were before).\n. @kwalrath @Foxandxss : ready to be reviewed. The changes are simple enough that it might be sufficient for Kathy to review.\n. @kwalrath @Foxandxss @wardbell : I've decided to keep the _cache fresh rather than minimal (i.e., rather than delete cache files as they are no longer needed). This way, we can now see the diff between the cache and the current file version.\nSo, FYI, the update I just pushed has a refreshed cache file for this chapter (but no other changes).\n. Removing the return beaks the task flow. I think that the return needs to be there in some form, we just need to find the right form (and this might be it).\n. @wardbell @Foxandxss @filipesilva : ready for review.\ncc @kwalrath\n. @wardbell @Foxandxss: I'm not to sure who should review this, but given that @brandonroberts was the last to edit it, I'm including his name.\n@kwalrath : to see the diff between the old cached copy and the latest, look at the second commit. Note that in the final commit the cached and latest copies are the same (as they should be).\nAll: as usual, it is best to view diffs by ignoring whitespace.\n. @kwalrath @wardbell @Foxandxss : Ready for review. Best viewed by ignoring whitespace.\n- @kwalrath : to see the RC5 diffs in the glossary view the \"glossary: replace cached by latest before edits\" commit.\n- @filipesilva : you might want to review the JS glossary.\n. @brandonroberts : ready for review.\ncc @wardbell @Foxandxss @kwalrath\n. Good catch. Fixed.\n. @wardbell @Foxandxss @brandonroberts @kwalrath: ready for review.\nAs usual, Jade files are best viewed by ignoring whitespace.\n. cc @kapunahelewong -- I included some of your copy edits, but mostly left my revision as is. I think that some / most of your concerns were addressed; others not (e.g. adding a complete set of new/changed files at the end of the chapter -- I was missing that too, but I can let you make the addition :).\n. @Foxandxss @wardbell : ready for review.\ncc @kwalrath \n. @Foxandxss @wardbell : minor PR ready for review\n. @kwalrath @Foxandxss : ready for review. TS side changes are trivial.\n. Yes please.\n. Just ensure that the _cache and latest copies of the ts .jade are the same.\nI usually edit the latest and copy it over to the cache.\n. Thanks for reporting this. The issue is broader in scope and will be fixed as part of #2173, so we'll close this issue and track progress in #2173.\n. Yep, the HeroDetailComponent is missing from way back when it was introduced in toh-3. Maybe toh-4 needs to be checked too?\n. Minor tweaks suggested, along with the need for keeping a few lines for Dart. Other than that, it LGTM.\n(Btw, the apparent problem with the tutorial flow was just a symptom; the root cause was because the starting state of the app.module.ts didn't match the end state of the previous chapter).\n. LGTM, if Travis is happy too.\n. @wardbell @Foxandxss @kwalrath : ready for review.\nI cleaned out trailing whitespace, so ignore whitespace for a better (re)viewing experience :).\n. Good question, best answered by running the broken link checker.\n. I think that it separates concerns so that the setTimeout(...) does just that (and nothing more); otherwise it gets a bit convoluted to integrate the call to getHeroes inside the call to setTimeout (at least I couldn't find a clean way that worked).\n. @Foxandxss: can you tag as LGTM so that @wardbell can have a look at this too?\n. @kwalrath: a first pass at updated prose (see original comment for details). Once we settle on the prose we can ping the TS folks to review as well.\n. @kwalrath: post-review edits submitted.\n. @wardbell @Foxandxss @thelgevold: this is ready for TS-side review.\nPlease see original PR comment for a description of the simplifications that have been made.\nI've squashed the post-Dart-review updates into the ts-only commit, so if you want, you can review only the TS-specific commit.\n. Elsewhere @thelgevold wrote: I think your edits look good, but let's wait for @wardbell's feedback.\n. cc @kwalrath \n. cc @kwalrath \n. @wardbell @Foxandxss @kwalrath : ready for review.\n. Ah, nice and simple fix. Maybe it would be better, though, to replace only the first leading underscore with a minus? Although unlikely, this could avoid potential clashes between an entry for __foo and _foo.\nLGTM (though I haven't tried it).\n. cc @Foxandxss \n. Yes, that's fine.\n. cc @kwalrath - it may be time for another deploy\n. @kwalrath - I'm surprise that there are any BAD FILENAME errors, since Travis tests for them and the build has been green for a while. I'm not sure what happened.\n. cc @kwalrath \n. Right, there will be no impact on the Dart QS because it is build from the TS cache.\nBtw, you have two minor lint errors (which break the Travis lint tests):\n[05:31:00] [gulp-tslint] error quickstart/ts/app/app.module2.ts[4, 48]: Missing semicolon\n[05:31:00] [gulp-tslint] error quickstart/ts/app/app.module2.ts[4, 8]: You need to leave whitespaces inside of the import statement's curly braces (https://goo.gl/25R7qr)\nAnd the e2e tests are failing for QS. Edits to the main module seem a little off, maybe they should have been done to an app.module.#.ts file?\n. cc @kwalrath @wardbell @Foxandxss - minor PR over the gulpfile.\n. @kwalrath @wardbell - I need this for the jade2ng work. The changes are relatively minor.\nBest viewed by ignoring whitespace diffs.\n. Will address this soon when I sync up the Dart template-syntax page.\n. I'm updating the template-syntax page, but addressing the issue with links into the API reference will be tackled via #1895.\n. cc @filipesilva, given that you make the TS-side changes, and that the Dart changes are identical, you can validate this minor change.\n. @kwalrath - yes, this is correct. Changes are needed in the prose, which I can handle in a follow-up PR if you like.\n@ben4ever - if you want to make the changes to the prose yourself, then remove these lines from public/docs/dart/latest/guide/forms.jade:\n``\n.l-sub-section\n  :marked\n    Note theplatform_directivesentry inpubspec.yaml`.\n    It imports core directives and, more importantly for this chapter,\n    form directives.\n```\n. cc @ericjim \n. As we discussed elsewhere: this failure is by design to ensure that @naomiblack and @kwalrath don't deploy a partial site unknowingly.\nI'm ok with this fix if we we guard it with an extra command line flag, say:\njs\n    if (fs.existsSync(backupApiSubdir) || argv.forceSkipApi !== true) {\n     // ...\n   }\nSo developers building a partial site (say, w/o Dart API docs) would use the --force-skip-api flag.\n.

Follow-up issue is #2772.\n. @kwalrath - InjectableMetadata link is fixed via #2773 (where is was also changed to refer to just Injectable). The reason the checker didn't pick up on that bad link is because it was an absolute link and we're only applying transformations to relative links. (The reasoning is that if the author went to the trouble of typing an absolute link then we assume it is correct, and not a candidate for transformation ... even if it refers to some API page).\n. @kwalrath - I fixed the capitalization of ViewChild and ContentChild in a new commit, named \"Kathy's post-review edits 2\", to each of #2750 and #2751.\n. All issue items have been addressed.. We have that already. Ah, now I remember the full context of the issue.

Thanks for your PR, but the link is meant to be _quickstartSrcURL; the problem is just that the definition of _quickstartSrcURL was removed by mistake. I'll add it back in a separate PR.. Superseded by #2849.. Hi Mark, thanks for filing an issue. The forms page is in need of an overhaul. Hopefully that will happen soon. In the meantime you can ignore that step since Dart doesn't need a moduleId.\ncc @kwalrath . @alexwolfe - ETA?\ncc @ericjim @kwalrath . Ah, it seems that the thrashing has been considerably reduced; e.g., visit and refresh https://angular.io/guide/dependency-injection.\nThe main problem that existed before was that the newlines in the code excerpts were ignored until pretty printed. This usually resulted in the height of the code excerpt box changing significantly.\nNow, under angular.io, code excerpts are initially presented as if formatted as normal <pre> code (respecting newlines) before it is rapidly pretty printed. So there is still a slight change in height, but the UX is much better than before.\nI'll have to investigate what the angular.io solution was. Unless Alex or someone else would be willing to give me a summary of the solution :).. Hi @freezestudio - thanks for noticing the duplicates! But your PR actually eliminates .items li.selected which is not a duplicate. I created a follow-up PR, #2877 with this fix.. Bonjour Alexandre: thanks, I'll look into it this afternoon.. Alexandre, you wrote:\n\nI get the following error at the end of the part Add Routing\n\nJust before the \"Add Routing\" section we have the text:\n\nThe app still runs and still displays heroes. Our refactoring of AppComponent into a new AppComponent and a HeroesComponent worked! We have done no harm.\n\nDid you test your app at that point and if so, did it run with out errors?\nI carefully redid the tutorial and I'm not getting the error that you mention neither at the start, nor once I reach the end of the \"Add routing\" section. Maybe double check spellings of selectors and element tags? Otherwise, I might need to see the actual code.\n. Ah, that is a real problem (and will likely happen again). Reopening this until we find a way to address this in the prose. @kwalrath, any ideas?\n\nBTW I noticed a little issue with the lib/heroes_component.dart (showing renamings only) snippet. There's a _router formal parameter that remains undefined at the step\n\nYes, thanks, that is addressed in #2907\n. Maybe it would be sufficient to add a short note suggesting that the reader just do a local file rename (without triggering IDE refactoring) would be sufficient.  How does that sound to you?. Yes, webdev can handle all these changes (and uses all those formatings already).. (Oups, concurrent update problem over the labels it would seem. Kathy approved so I've re-instated the proper labels.). @naomiblack - yes there will be separate PRs (I haven't started work on adjusting the build scripts yet).. Contributes to #2930. @kevmoo - I was just cross linking to the main tracker issue.\nIf this has indeed been merged, maybe @wardbell or @juleskremer can close this? \n. @tilwinjoy - the title is indeed misleading, so I've adjusted it. What will be dropped will be the language submenu, not JS. Development of apps using JS will still be documented.. In this PR:\n- All gulp tasks will now build for ts|js by default (it used to be ts|js|dart).\n- I've pulled out the build safeguards that previously would force a build of Dart API docs on a check-deploy.\n- Deleted the build scripts used to install Dart repo and tooling.\n- Travis: removed reference to the deleted build scripts (only affected deploy-install.sh).\n- Added an ignore rule to firebase.json so that docs/dart/** is ignored (even if present).\nNote that Dart doc pages will still be generated by Harp (but those take a trivial amount of time to generate).\nTravis is green.\ncc @filipesilva @wardbell . Travis is fine with the changes, and I ensured that doing local builds still work w/o dart docs.\n. Supersedes #1813.. Thanks Ward. Sorry, that I forgot to commit to the IdeaBlade repo (I hit the publish button in the GH app out of habit, as I usually do for my Dart work). I'll commit to IB repo once again moving forward.. Hi Keven. Each tutorial part is filled with details specific to that part. In order to keep the text focused, we'll sometimes omit showing the details of some elementary step. For example, by the someone reaches part 5 of the tutorial, they should be well equipped to know how write an import statement without having to be shown the exact text.\nI'd vote to note make this addition. @wardbell @Foxandxss ?. Thanks for the feedback Kevin.\nTaking a peek at the live example sources is an option. Might that have been enough to help?. Very cool! What is the migration target? A simplified form of Harp+Jade? Or just Jade? Or no more Jade?. @wardbell - pls see my line comments. Anything else to be done?. All points addressed. And I've noted not to edit the +makeEx* mixin applications anymore (well, that means for the two files I have left to review :).. @wardbell @kapunahelewong - the Structural Directives page currently has (essentially) this Table of Contents:\n- What are structural directives?\n- NgIf\n- Group sibling elements with <ng-container>\n- NgFor\n- NgSwitch*\n- <template>\n- Write your own directive\nI think it would improve the flow if we covered all the structural directives first (since that is the purpose of this guide), before mentioning <ng-container>.\nI'd like to suggest that we move the <ng-container> section like so:\n- What are structural directives?\n- NgIf\n- NgFor\n- NgSwitch*\n- <template>\n- Group sibling elements with <ng-container> <======\n- Write your own directive\nI can do it in this PR if you agree.. Oups, it seems that I omitted to back propagate some copyedits. They've been added in the separate \"post review\" commit.. Images are the same, just with smaller file sizes. Something that Naomi asked be done a while back (https://github.com/angular/angular.io/issues/2436).. Interesting diagrams. I'd suggest changing the direction of most arrows so that they point in the direction of a standard class/object diagram dependency relation: e.g.\n- app.component.ts --> hero.service.ts\n- her.service.ts --> hero.ts\netc.. Interesting diagrams. I'd suggest changing the direction of most arrows so that they point in the direction of a standard class/object diagram dependency relation: e.g.\n- app.component.ts --> hero.service.ts\n- her.service.ts --> hero.ts\netc.. @wardbell - I agree with the goal of removing all blocks and variables, but this PR is only meant to \"fix\" a few issues. I'd rather the full cleanup be tackled in a follow-up PR.. @kapunahelewong - pls review & approve/comment when you have a minute. Thanks!. That is what I thought, but I wanted to double check in case there was a nonstandard case where it might have been necessary. Thanks for confirming. @thso do you agree?\n. Yes, that bothered me too, but given that this example doesn't run anymore in beta.16, I decided to stop making changes. The entire example needs revision anyhow. For now, I need to focus on getting the Dart version of the prose out. I will revise this example once I get to the pipes chapter.\n. Yes, I will be glad to try that out once https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/8258 is fixed :). What do you suggest in the meantime? As I pointed out elsewhere, this example will need to be fully revised soon.\n. Done.\n. Done.\n. Done.\n. (Yeah, my bad for just searching for (#) and not looking at the context carefully enough before editing.) Change reverted.\n. Done (and thanks for the explanation).\n. Oups, not sure how that code there. Removed leading space.\n. Done.\n. Good catch. Fixed.\n. Fixed\n. done\n. fixed\n. The ...? It is used in the prose to indicate that there is more in that class but it is not being shown. That convention is used on the TS side.\n. Ah yes. Cleaner. Done.\n. I generally do, except when it contains a single single-quote like this.\nI find \"That's\" easier to read than 'That\\'s'.\n. done\n. fixed (everywhere in example)\n. Yes, that is cleaner. Fixed (everywhere in example).\n. It has an implicit return type of dynamic, thus matching the signature of the interface method it is overriding. I would suggest leaving it like this.\n. It has an implicit return type of dynamic, thus matching the signature of the interface method it is overriding. I would suggest leaving it like this.\n. fixed (set to void)\n. done\n. done\n.

It tells the prettifier not to apply any syntax highlighting (previously the error message words were in different colors).\n. The original problem is that the sentence was a run on sentence. Adding the comma, was a \"quickfix\" to the reader so that he/she knows to take their breath :). The sentence could be reworked, but just adding the comma seems good enough for now.\n. It turns into _ in Dart and nothing in TS.\n. Ok\n. Right. Whenever you see a line starting with\njade\nblock foo\n  some-stuff\nThen look for the correspondingly named block in the Dart .jade file.\n. done\n. done\n. done\n. done\n. done\n. Because it matches compactness used in other TS examples.\nAnyhow, change undone.\n. It isn't; this is the TS prose. It is difficult to see but this text is under the block module-id (see Line 313).\nThe corresponding Dart prose is here.\n. Ditto above. This is only part of the TS prose. \n. You are correct, thanks. Fixed (though there seems to be a bug related to the styles actually being picked up properly; I'll try to isolated and file an issue soon).\n. Yes, it is more complicated, and I tried to avoid it, but it is the only way I have found to be able to conditionally include list items.\n. fixed\n. fixed\n. Good point. I've taken note to fix that later.\n. Why not include this paragraph (L15-18) in the TS version?\n. Ah, right. I just feel that we should minimize differences between the language versions. The added remark will be useful to TS and JS users too :). If you don't want to define a variable, you could just drop the last sentence (L18) and put L15-17 in the TS version. It's up to you.\n. The \"with slice\" suggests there is a slice operation in Dart. Maybe drop that fragment or just leave it for now and we can address it on the next round (when the doc is refactored to conform to the new design).\n. Example needed, which we can address in the next round.\n. (For the record, toh-6 has landed.)\n. Done.\n. Yes, start and end can be a region list (it helps reduce the number of extra lines in the file ... and makes it a bit more readable).\n. Yes, good catch. Fixed.\n. Hmm, that was working before ... investigating.\n. Fixed.\n. Hmm, maybe we should change that in ts2dart?\n. Fixed.\n. The objective was to show the result of desugaring the *ngSwitchWhen without any optimizations. The chapter material is complex enough, so I preferred that the reader not be forced to recall that if the template expression is a string constant then:\n  <foo [x]=\"'s'\">\nis equivalent to \n  <foo x=\"s\">\nBesides, this is what matches the TS example. Let me know if you agree with this reasoning.\n. done\n. done\n. Good catch re. the article. Fixed.\nYes, I removed Date because the class name is DateTime in Dart and didn't want to define a new conditional variable just for that. I think that the point of that phrase remains clear even without Date/DateTime mentions (actually, I'm not even sure that the parenthetical remark is needed at all, but it is certainly ok with just mentioning Array/List IMHO).\n. Both are used elsewhere, about equally, in the docs. I'll use \"camelCase\". Let me know if you have objections.\n. Actually, come to think of it, everything is an object in Dart, so the parenthetical remark is actually potentially confusing for Dartisans.\n. Looking into this a bit further ... interestingly, it is possible to chain expressions with side-effects in Dart, using both ; and ,.\n- Using ; comes from the fact that an expression is a statement -- see Line 577 in the Dart 1.10 grammar.\n- Using , is possible in the context of for loops; see the for-loop production rule on Line 593. The expressionList at the end is a comma-separated list of expressions.\nBut, comma-separated lists of expressions is not permitted as a statement (in contrast to other C-like languages), so I believe that the prose at line 110 that you refer to above is a good enough short qualification of the situation. Do you agree?\n. > Or we could just use \"list\" everywhere\nAgreed.\n\nWe'd still want to call out that difference somewhere (perhaps in this chapter)\n\nAgreed. I don't think that it should be nestled in a central chapter of the basic dev. guide. So I'll just cut the callout out and save it for inclusion elsewhere.\n. Yes, thanks for the reference to https://github.com/dart-lang/api.dartlang.org/issues/62.\n. Just a follow-up on this. There is actually a glossary entry for \"camelCase\", so I think that that is the better choice.\n. Changed s/4/For/.\n. done\n. I can't move lines 90-92 to the top because line 89 potentially modifies _filePath.\n. done\n. This is an idiom used with makeExample (and makeExcerpt) throughout the .jade files ... mainly because makeExample was originally written to accept positional arguments only. I would rather not make this a special case. (A proper fix would be to make the last three arguments optional named parameters, but I didn't want to do that.)\n. That was an old comment that I missed (I had only searched for todo|fixme). I have removed it since it is not relevant (the entire source file is never shown).\n. The OpaqueToken section will need to be revisited once #1563 gets resolved so I decided to leave the token name like it is in the TS example (because then the token name and the interface name will match, both being AppConfig).\n. removed \",\"\n. Fixed\n\n(like @Directive and @Pipe, which we'll learn about later)\n. done\n. dartfmt doesn't seem to care. It leaves the line there if present, and doesn't add it if it is absent. I'll all for compactness, so I removed that extra line.\n. > This sounds very formal ...\n\nYes, what you propose is much better, thanks. Fixed.\n. Fixed.\n. Good catch. Fixed.\n. :)\n. fixed per our discussion\n. Both good points. Fixed (and yes, it is only one solution).\n. done\n. I prefer your rewrite. Fixed.\n. Fixed. Changed 'operator' to 'notation' (since that matches Dart Up and Running).\n. fixed\n. How about this:\n\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular.io/issues/new?labels=dart,api&title=[Dart][API]\n\nThe title prefix is because not everyone has the permission to set the labels, so a title prefix is better than nothing.\n. Yes, what you propose is better. Done.\n. Actually, that paragraph is there to match up with the TS prose which reads:\n\n... we can provide and inject the configuration object in our top-level AppComponent.\n\nHow about:\n\nWe illustrate this next. We also show how to provide and inject the\n    configuration object in our top-level AppComponent:\n. I've always assumed that we could not specify the unnamed docregion when other docregions are being named. But I could be wrong (I'll test that out some time).\n. Had a conversation with @Foxandxss in a separate thread, and he is ok with the change made here. FYI.\n. That is my preference too. Done.\n. Fixed.\n. Fixed.\n. I like your suggestion. Fixed.\n. Fixed.\n. It seems that in the tutorial chapters are referred to as parts. Consider the following excerpt from ... Chapter/Part 2:\nBefore we continue with Part 2 of the Tour of Heroes, let\u2019s verify we have the following structure after Part 1. If not, we\u2019ll need to go back to Part 1 and figure out what we missed.\n\nBut I agree that in this case \"chapter\" might make more sense. Changing it back to \"chapter\".\n. The snake_case entry went in with the toh-3 changes. (edited)\n. Change \"chapter\" to \"section\".\n. Change \"chapter\" to \"section\".\n. I agree, but that was in the original TS text so I left it as is (but excluded it from the Dart edition). Remember that for this time, my goal was mainly to proof read, not a general edit.\n. I agree that it is all a bit colloquial (\"twists and turns\"). \"Convert\" seems at least a step in the right direction as compared to \"turn\" :). Maybe we can revise this on the next pass?\n. I agree that it is more accurate and that it reads better. I have made the change.\nFYI, the http pub page uses both terms\n\nhttp\nA composable, Future-based library for making HTTP requests.\nThis package contains a set of high-level functions ...\n. > Let's orient it around the http package, not the http library.\n\nYes, good point. Done (I changed the definition of _Angular_http_library to use the term \"package\".)\nFor the other issue(s) you mention, I'll address them in the next comment.\n. Right, those should indeed be the imports for v1. Good catch. Fixed.\n. As agreed, I've changed the providers list argument to bootstrap() to conform to the workaround mentioned in https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/9673, namely:\ndart\n  bootstrap(AppComponent, [\n    provide(BrowserClient, useFactory: () => new BrowserClient(), deps: [])\n  ]);\n. done\n. Much better. Done.\n. Dropped \"standard\".\n. Keeping 'highlighted', as agreed.\n. Fixed as you suggested.\n. The sample code and prose have been simplified on the Dart side, while preserving all essential app behavior (e.g., there is no child-to-parent event emission in the Dart version). @johnpapa suggested that we postpone these changes for TS (since he'll be revising the chapter soon).\n. Right. Fixed.\n. In the past @thso has been insistent on explicitly declaring return types, and I generally agree with this recommendation. \n. Because there can be no more than 8 tabs :).\n. Well, what is given seemed like a reasonable split: all app source files in the tabs with the config (pubspec) separately.\n. Lines 318-320 are repeated in 321-323.\nAlso, use makeExcerpt() -- see Line 311 for an example.\n. Notice the .error style here. It seems to have been lost in your proposed changes.\n. Drop the last two lines (L67-68) since all regions are automatically closed at the end of the file (and omitting them makes for fewer of those extra docregion tags! :).\n. Rename the region to \"additions\" (since you'll be re-introducing the .error style that was inadvertently dropped --- see my comment on the original sample.css), and make the corresponding update in the .jade.\n. Good point, will do (after this morning's standup).\n. How about just dropping what is in parentheses?\n. Done.\n. Yes, \"module\" is used throughout the docs. The concept of a \u201cmodule\u201d is \u200bcentral\u200b to Angular, and to the approach to app development that we want to promote.\n. Fixed as you suggested with tweaks we agree to elsewhere (in particular clarifying that a Dart package is also a module).\n. Changed to\n\nDart difference: Modules are compilation units or packages\n. I was trying to mimic the TS prose. I just dropped that sentence since it isn't very helpful.\n. Oh, I forgot to come back to that. Thanks for catching it! Fixed.\n. As agreed, I kept this first occurrence of 'export'.\n. Changed to \"declare\".\n. Right, this was meant to be only in the Dart version. Fixed.\n. Yes. I found that having, at this early stage, the context for the snippets helps create a better mental picture of how the pieces fit together (and where to find them in the sample sources without having to resort to a global text search). That's my 2 cents. If you prefer all of the snippets to be void of titles, that will be easy to fix.\n. fixed\n. Good point. Fixed.\n. Lifecycle hooks chapter is mentioned in the paragraph that follows. I've added an explicit mention of ngOnInit.\n. Its uglier but provides context. The /.../ are easily removed. It's your call. (I'd leave the OnInit).\n. Triggering on onInput rather than onChange makes for a more responsive user experience (UX). Again, using type=\"number\" makes for a better UX in those browsers that support it, and makes no difference (from the app processing point of view) in those browsers that do not support it.\n. Because of the () the mixin will render the title as app/hero.ts (excerpt).\n. wfm\nAlternatively, we might register at a component level, in the providers property of the @Component metadata:\n\nfixed\n. Ok. Undone.\n. Done.\n. Ok.\n. Good catch. Fixed by writing: !{_a} **!{_decorator}**.\n. Ok.\n. Ok, but changed \"discovers\" to \"reads\" (otherwise the phrase doesn't really make sense).\n. fixed\n. done\n. Yes, noted.\n. fixed\n. ok, changed\n. done\n. Added.\n. Short answer: because it has no effect code-example (see the source).\nLonger answer: this idiom comes from the makeExample mixin (where it prevents the default behavior of turning on line numbers if there is more than one line). But is has no utility when applied directly to code-example.\n. It has no impact on how we write the Jade, but it allows the shred xref mapper to make sense of the abbreviated makeExample source paths like:\njade\n+makeExample('app/hero.service.ts')\nvs the original long form:\njade\n+makeExample('router/ts/app/main.1.ts','all', 'main.ts')(format=\".\")\nDoes that answer your question?\n. I agree.\n. fixed\n. That was just for a test. It should not have been left in (no sure how it slipped by). Thanks for catching it!\nFixed.\n. How about\n\nAt the moment it displays the Hero object's attributes:`\n. Well, node v4 doesn't work for @kwalrath, and more often than not, forgetting to switch to v5 for Kathy has cause problems and results in wasted time.\n\nAre you aware of anyone who must stick with node 4 and who is required to build ng.io docs? (Kathy has to do this every time she tests out a PR for merging :) If not, IMHO, we should just just drop v4.\n. No, we only need to read read 'cheatsheet/*.md' files as input; see line 49 below.\n. I agree, that bothered me too, but it's hard coded in the same way on the TS side :)\nSee tools/api-builder/angular.io-package/services/packageInfo.js and that's good enough for me (for now).\n. Oh, ... right (and writeFilesProcessor can go too). Done.\n. @ericjim @naomiblack : howToUse is prose, right? Do you actually want to dump it all here or just have an \"Exists\" / \"Not Done\" status like for whatItDoes?\n. @wardbell : there was a bug in http_in_memory_web_api which the author fixed. This PR removes the temporary workaround and bumps up the library version to get the fixed version.\n. Yes, it is an all-Dart counterpart.\n. Oups, didn't mean for that to happen. I forgot that the convention for including/excluding a title with makeExcerpt is reversed as compared to makeExample. Fixed all of excerpts that originally did not have a title.\n. Right.\n. Shorten the path to just app/heroes.component.css (just like for line 318 above).\nDrop the (format=\".\") since that is the default for makeExcerpt.\n. Change this line to: +makeExample('app/hero-search.component.css')\n. IMHO, the correspondence is easy to make. The problem with the Dart is that some of the commands are quite verbose, and it isn't clear how to refer to them. E.g. TS\n- debounceTime(300)\nvs. Dart\n- transform(new Debounce(new Duration(milliseconds: 300)))\nUnless you find an abbreviation like\n- transform(new Debounce(... 300)))\nacceptable. Let me know what you prefer.\n. Deleted.\n. Fixed.\n. Oh, did you mean no colon?\n. Done.\n. Strange.\n. Oh, I just noticed this. We need to make this sentence work for all language versions. I'd suggest going with:\n\nAdd the following to the bottom of the HeroesComponent CSS file:\n+makeExcerpt('app/heroes.component.css', 'additions')\n\n(Drop the last '' argument to makeExcerpt.)\n. As a separate makeTabs is ok (since there can be no more than 8 entries).\n. There is a repeated \"the\" in the sentence.\n. Drop the \"s\" in \n\n... pipes need[s] ...\n. Fixing that now.\n. On the TS side, the \"for-snippets-only\" source files (used solely as a source of code snippets) are excluded from the constructed plunkers.\n\nOn the Dart side, I just updated the dart-doc-syncer to exclude these for-snippets-only source files.\n. Good catch. Fixed.\n. Yes, better. Fixed.\n. Ok. Fixed.\n. Yes and yes. Added them.\n. Fixed.\n. Was fixed at the same time as the other one.\n. Done.\n. How about\n\nRemember to import the hero detail component ...\n. Fixed.\n. Can we address this in another pass?\n. Fixed.\n. Added:\nWe'll also need to import dart:html to gain access to window.\n\nimport 'dart:html';\n. Fixed (for TS & Dart with appropriate file names).\n. We agreed to remove the code excerpt.\n. Just to clarify, the typo was fixed (via the rewriting of the sentence you suggested).\n. Yes, we test the updating of the hero name twice: once when accessed via the Dashboard, and once when accessed via the Heroes list. This is how it was in the previous e2e tests.\n. The test groups for the Dashboard and the Heroes list are independent. I think that it is reasonable to include this single test (editing the hero name), in both test groups.\n. For some reason I was under the impression that the old definition was appearing in the JS glossary, but you are correct, it should not. I'll remove it and rebase.\n. Better. Fixed.\n. Done.\n. Dropped that sentence.\n. Added a zone definition for Dart.\n. Nit. Drop this blank line.\n. Nit. Drop this blank line.\n. Nit. Drop this blank line.\n. Drop the #enddocregion on line 32 and this start of region (L33), since they are over the same tags.\n. Line 482 to 484 are relevant for Dart, please keep them and: just before this line, insert:\n\n\n+ifDocsFor('dart')\nand then indent lines 482 to 484.\n. I think Jade requires indentation levels to be in multiple of two characters, otherwise it can cause strange problems. Hence\n- Line 484 should be indented by 4 spaces (not 3)\n- Line 485 should be indented by 6 spaces (not 5).\n. One more blank line to drop here (since you'll be fixing the indentation in the .jade file anyways :).\n. Fixed.\n. Agreed. Fixed.\n(For the record, I just copied this from the pre-RC5 prose. :)\n. fixed\n. Interesting. It seems that I wasn't the only one surprised by this ... but I understand now.\nFixed.\n. fixed\n. Oh, that original sentence certainly wasn't right. Fixed\n. fixed\n. :)\n. Because this introduces the fact that we will be adding support for those three features.\nEach feature is then a section at level 2.\n. Oh, that needs to be fixed. Good catch.\n. The chapter title refers to HTTP (the protocol); we are not trying name a library or module (at this level).\nHTTP is achieved via different means under TS and Dart (HttpModule vs. http library).\n. Yes, it is -pre.1.\n\nsemver resolution falls back to alphabetical\n\nGood to know. Though, I wouldn't expect more than 9 pre subreleases.\n. Done.\n. I copied that over from the TS side, but I will make those fixes. I created #2407 to help track this change.\n. Fixed.\n. Nice.\n. Why this change? You are replacing a function g by an anonymous function which does nothing but call g. I.e., g and () => g() are equivalent, though the former is shorter.\n. Oops, your change is actually the right thing to do to ensure that this gets bound properly in goBack.\n. Local Jade variable names used to render TS and Dart prose from the same source. Such variable names do not appear in the rendered HTML.\n. This change is necessary so that 'const' elements get picked up in line 215; because 'const' is used as the canonical representative for the matches array elements.\n. The argument can be both an increment and a decrement, so maybe name it delta instead?\n. Drop the hypthen from \"de-sugars\" and change the article.\n\"de-sugars that\" --> \"desugars the\"\n. The ^ means it will pickup the latest 0.11.x ... so the rest after 0.11 is placebo :)\n. (Besides, we had no reason to be locked into 0.11.3+3 exactly.)\n. Pls unindent lines 46-48 so that they are at the same indentation level as app-root.\n. Actually, this might actually be ok. Leave as is for now. I'll experiment later.\n. You can leave this line here. Just indent it, and place the if !ng2 line above it.\n. Given that the styles have been changed. Could we just drop the .announcement-bar and adjust the styles to apply to the announcement-bar tag?\n. Yes, its TS syntax for a string with interpolation (i.e., the ${WWW} inside the string).\n. That's what line 773 does. It generates output like:\n```\nNo project is currently active.\nProject aliases for /Users/chalin/git/angular.io:\nlive (angular-io)\n  ngdocsdev (ngdocsdev)\n  kw-dev (kw-angular-io)\n  dev (angular-io-dev)\n```\nIs that good enough?\n. Because it isn't needed: there is no node_modules as a direct subfolder of _examples.\n. fixed\n. Made a pass and fixed them all.\n. fixed\n. No it isn't; thanks for the reminder, I had meant to remove that comment. I'll do so in a follow-up PR. #2783 is the tracker issue.\n. Yes, e2e tests run fine:\nSuites passed:\n  public/docs/_examples/template-syntax/ts\nAll tests passed\n. Done\n. Reverted.\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. Actually, this is mainly to avoid a conflict with a string property named fontSize whose initial value is \"large\".\nIt seemed to me that since the property is being assigned to [style.font-size.px] (see the old line 355 above) it could naturally be named fontSizePx (which is the camel-case equivalent of the style attribute it is being assigned to).\n. Fixed\n. Fixed the latest version.\n. I excluded guide, because this page is the link to the Guide. Do you want me to add a self link?\n\nThis is a case where having everything in the guide/ directory is coming back to bite us.\nYes.\nMaybe we should try this out and see if anyone objects?\nAgreed.\n. Fixed\n. Fixed\n. (I was thinking about that, but wasn't sure how to adjust the text.)\n. Ward guide/browser-support.jade @ line 69 needs the polyfills docregion:\n./www/docs/ts/latest/guide/browser-support.html:85:BAD FILENAME: ../../../fragments/quickstart/ts/index-polyfills.html.md   Current path: docs,ts,latest,guide,browser-support PathToDocs: ../../../A particular browser may require at least one polyfill to run any Angular application. \n. Since you have deleted the people.png figure, you can drop this <br clear...> line.\n. This code block (L18-24) is needed to compute the landing page for the Advanced section (which is different for Dart). Please reinstate it.\n. We don't _need to have a trailing /.\n. Ditto.\n. Please revert the href as !{advancedUrl} (and drop the trailing space on the line).\n. This line (block ..., and the following :marked) can be deleted since the Dart version no longer requires this block extension point. After deleting the block line, remember to unindent the code below it.\n. Given the modifications you've made, this variable definition isn't required anymore.\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. This :marked line can be deleted (since the preceding block is :marked).\n. You didn't like the compactness of a bulleted list for all the \"reference page\" entries?\n\nActually, same question for the feedback entries.\n. The two feedback links will need to be reverted to !{_ngDocRepoURL} and !{_ngRepoURL}, respectively; otherwise the links will be invalid for Dart.\n. In a bare minimal \"Hello world\" example it seems superfluous to be concerned about style.\n. In a bare minimal \"Hello world\" example it seems superfluous to be concerned about style.\n. Maybe mark name as const?\n. Nit: if you put this comment on the first line then you can delete lines 5 and 6.\n. \"Module\" should probably be uncapitalized, here, on the next line and throughout the text. @kwalrath, @kapunahelewong, what do you think? Maybe you want to put it in bold instead (or link to the glossary entry)?\n. I think that i might be preferable to write something like:\n\nEvery application has at least one Angular Module, call the root module.\n\nI would drop the \"at the root level of the app\" because modules don't have any \"placement/position\" relative to the app file structure, and this kind of statement seems to imply that there is.\n. Maybe instead, just:\n\nBy convention, it is named AppModule.\n. Nice to have this unit test as a part of the seed!\n. How about \"minimal\"?\n. Nit: drop (format='.') since this is a final and complete version of the file?\n. Why not An Angular \"Hello World\" as the banner?\n. There are two successive <ngio-ex path= on this line. You can also write this more simply as <span ngio-ex>attribute-directives</span> if you want.\n. Repeated <ngio-ex path= here too.\n. langName isn't used in this file so this can be deleted\n. Maybe drop the \"Everyone is different\", since \"Everyone learns differently\" seems to drive the point well enough. I'd merge this sentence with the next paragraph.\n. This should be <br class=\"l-clear-left\"> (since clear=\"all\" is deprecated).\nAlso, please put this <br...> at the end of the previous line (one of the jade translators needs that trigger).\n. Pages should not contain inlined <h1> titles like this; the <h1> title is set in the page header (the blue region at the top of displayed pages) via the page layout. Its value is read from the corresponding title property in _data.json file. If you want this to be a subtitle then you can set the subtitle property to \"Trying Angular\", but that seems superfluous given the descriptive title of \"SETUP FOR LOCAL DEVELOPMENT\".\n. Capitalize first words of each bullet.\n. Markdown sets the h3 id to \"clone\". By explicitly defining the anchor on line 29, this creates two document elements with the same id.\n. At first glance I found it confusing to see two sets of instructions. Why not create tabs like this:\n\n\nIf you like the idea, here is the Jade to achieve that:\ncode-tabs\n  code-pane(language=\"sh\" name=\"Clone\")\n    code-example.\n      git clone https://github.com/angular/quickstart.git my-project\n      cd my-project\n      npm install\n      npm start\n  code-pane(language=\"sh\" name=\"Download\")\n    code-example.\n      cd my-project\n      npm install\n      npm start\n. lowercase \"s\" in \"seed\"\n. You'll need a name property if you want this to link to the QS plunker. Also, why not write it as:\n<live-example name=\"quickstart\">QuickStart live example</live-example>\n. Capitalize \"it\"\n. \"the same\" is repeated; sentence needs revision\n. I would drop the first \"the\"\n\nDefines AppModule, the root module, ...\n\nor go for\n\nDefines the root module, AppModule, ...\n. Drop \"to talk about\"\n. Could we link \"JIT compiler\" to something?\n. Maybe\nin a live-coding environment like Plunker.\n. Consider putting this sentence in a separate paragraph (so that the \"Change ...\" will stick out). Or maybe make actually make it a call-out?\n. Replace \"strongly-typed\" by \"statically typed\" (TS isn't strongly typed).\n. > TypeScript compiles to JavaScript\n\nseems better than \"turns\" (and might be more understandable to folks who aren't native English speakers)\n. It would be great to plug in Dart here too! How about\n\nYou can write your application in other versions of JavaScript, or Dart if you prefer.\n. Hmm, interesting. Then leave them in in that case.\n. How about\nA typical name is AppModule\n. sgtm\n. I know, but I think our beloved tech writer leads may disagree :)\n@kapunahelewong - any opinion about this?\n. sgtm\n. I think that we might be able to put some instructions in the tab (I just haven't tried it) ... .  Can look into it later.\n. For the time being, this link should work, [Dart](../../dart/latest). I've tested it out locally and it doesn't give a 404.\n. The content of the root component element is actually completely ignored, and so in that sense it would be more accurate to write \"content is not managed by Angular\" :).  Maybe the intent was to write that the content generated by the Angular app gets inserted in the DOM below the root component element? So the remark could be changed to:\n\n<my-app><!-- app generated content gets inserted here --></my-app>\nOr\n<my-app><!-- app generated content will appear here --></my-app>\nIf this is updated, then index.1.html will need to be updated (actually, it would be nice to be able to get rid of index.1.html altogether).\n. Hmm, I think that quotes are needed, i.e.: <live-example name=\"quickstart\">.. Fixed broken link here.. Removed (format=\".\") since that is the default for makeExcerpt.. The trade-off is to enable plaster / ... / in the code excerpt, or to leave it as is. IMHO, even if a particular SDK doesn't support it, readers should understand that the code excerpt is suggestive, given that the heading is \"lib/heroes_component.dart (showing renamings only)\". Use of plaster just makes it too cluttered.. @wardbell - btw, this is only for the Dart code excerpt. . Btw, I was trying to avoid having a heroes_component_1.dart file (which would be another way of solving this).. Sure, but wouldn't that apply to all scripts mentioned in the dev setup?\nI'm just trying to keep this all DRY. We know that the scripts are kept up-to-date because they are run on Travis. If we duplicate the script commands here, then they run the risk of becoming out of step ... as they did this morning.\nIf a Windows user can't run a script I'd assume that they'd look inside and run the equivalent commands under Windows. Would that do?. sgtm, ty. Nit: space after heading.. The paragraph text is over-indented.. Since you switched the order of the files, the region list needs to be adjusted as well. Use\n',,,quickstart,',. Add the lib/ path prefix here?. Add the web/ path prefix here (and for index.html and styles.css below)?. These local variable definitions are not being used. Unless you think that we can \"re-integrate\" with TS, we might as well delete lines 2 - 7.. Yes, I found that a bit strange too, but decided to go along with @wardbell on that one (focusing instead on the heart of the changes at hand).. You can drop the block includes and unindent the include ... line.. Fixed in latest sync. Fixed. Fixed. Fixed. fixed. I thought that we were to use the term \"page\" instead of \"guide\" (although, in this case, the original \"example\" seems to be ok too).. Okey dokey. I just thought it was a TS land convention as well, but apparently no longer.. The file starts with\n/* tslint:disable:no-unused-variable member-ordering */\nand so the linter is happy (i.e., the build is green).\nThe move was so as to put all the extra \"snippets\" (not actually meant to be part of the class's default docregion), at the end.\n(Btw, those two members were already \"out of order\". I figured that if they are going to be out-of-order, then might as well be at the end of the real class members.). Ok, I'll refrain from combining them in the future (I just find excessive docregion lines distracting when trying to read the source).. done. As a matter of style, we should encourage readers to associate @Input with setters. This way, documentation and refactoring tools, for example, will attribute the decorator to the proper class member.\nRight, Angular's behavior isn't affected (though IMHO it might be incidental behavior that it happens to work when attached to the getter).\nIf you feel strongly about it, I can undo it. Let me know.. It is not an example of <ng-container>. This code is not shown in the page, it is only there to support the ngSwitch code which is shown in the page.. Done. (I thought that this file showed up in the plnkr and zip, but I just checked and it doesn't.). All reverted.\n\ndo not make further changes to structure/layout that have no visual effect\n\nOk.. Ok. Noted.. done. Done.\nAlso, I dropped the hyphen in \"desugars\" (Kathy confirmed a few days ago that there shouldn't be any hyphen).. It is not. Like for the structural directives page, this is just support code -- i.e., it is not featured on the page.. done. (I added the plural form because one listens for events on a stream.). :) k. Nit: unnecessary blank line here.. So will we be including parentheses after method names from now on?. Ok, good to know. I'll do that consistently from now on.. Lines 37-42 belong to the Jade block above it. This readjusts the indentation.. The span starts on line 406.. It was here from before, but just not updated. This is fixing it.. The code sample is part of the preceding block.. Yes, in the next pass ... :). ",

The examples you pointed out lacks that angle. E.g. the @Injectable annotation in those example really confuses me as it is missing from the DefinitelyTyped angular2.d.ts. I could probably add it to the file my self? But I've really lost track after all the different angular2 examples.\nI have created the following example by looking at the 2. Displaying Data step:\nimport { Component, View, bootstrap,} from 'angular2/angular2';\nclass FriendsService {\n  names: Array<string>;\n  constructor() {\n    this.names = [\"Alice\", \"Aarav\", \"Mart\u00edn\", \"Shannon\", \"Ariana\", \"Kai\"];\n  }\n}\n@Component({\n  selector: 'display',\n  injectables: [FriendsService]\n})\n@View({\n  template: '{{names}}'\n})\nclass DisplayComponent {\n  names: Array<string>;\n  constructor(friends:FriendsService) {\n    this.names = friends.names;\n  }\n}\nbootstrap(DisplayComponent);\nThis gives the following js.error in chrome: \nError during instantiation of Token(AppComponentAnnotatedType)!. ORIGINAL ERROR: No Directive annotation found on FriendsService\nBy comparing the 'compiled' js to the es5 source I see that I'm missing this line: DisplayComponent.parameters = [[FriendsService]];\nAdding that to either the typescript or the 'compiled' js, fixes things. So what is my TypeScript missing? What have I missed?\nEdit: This is also valid TS: DisplayComponent['parameters'] = [[FriendsService]];\n. That video did the trick, I was missing ' \"emitDecoratorMetadata\": true,' in my tsconfig.json. I don't operate with a tsd.json as I followed the quickstart guide and copied the angular2.d.ts into my workspace.\nTo me this seems a bit random, but in the 2. step in the quickstart you use this: 'tsc --watch -m commonjs -t es5 --emitDecoratorMetadata app.ts'.

I am going to research a bit to see if we can make a better index.html for plunker or just modify the demo for the affected ones.\n. To reproduce the problem, just open the plunker (on the first message) and look at the console:\n\nTo fix it, we just need to add a new meta tag to the System.js config. Problem is that is generated automatically for all files with the same content.\n1) I liked our explanation about using interfaces because they add no code and we just needed it for typings and development help.\n2) That is fine by me, I can remove them :)\n. Oh I see your changes. I was about to change them myself.\nDid I miss the toh-4 ones? Weird, I was sure I changed 3, 4 and 5 (at least add the input, there wasn't any relevant conversation around it).\nThank you for the changes.\n. I debugged it. The problem is that we generate our API based on the angular source and you can see:\n\nNotice the Promise<boolean> indentation.\nThen that will generate:\n\nWhat my editor marks as blue would be interpreted as Jade syntax and the white part will be printed out. Due how Jade works (indentation based) it will interpret the Promise as syntax and never print it out.\n@wardbell What should we do here? Can be fixed in our side?\n. Yeah I saw it. It is definitely the less troublesome solution, I like it.\n. Sounds good to me @kwalrath. If you want me to update this PR with the Dart, I will do it right away.\nAlso, if you think that those docs needs to be updated, ping me and I update them as well, no problem.\n. For what is worth, I agree with James in here. Also I prefer what he said in the last message. Better to add a with and get rid of all confusions.\n. We are promoting @Injectable() in every service (even if it has no dependency) as the best practice.\n. What is the status of this PR? Ping @eeandrew \n. Thank you sir, but this is a dup of #1021 \n. No worries, you can always open an issue / PR if you feel that something is wrong. This time someone was a bit faster :P\n. Is this still relevant?\n/cc @brandonroberts \n. Let see what Brandon has to say.\n. Updated to RC1\n. We are not releasing this repo as a package so I don't think that keywords are needed.\n. I totally agree with John here regarding promises. As long as we make very clear that we will cover observables in the next part or something.\n. You are right, I just didn't read the context properly it seems :)\n. I love they way you sell the product. The problem is that the people is not aware of the problems of not having a11y and they just say \"hey, it looks good, why do extra work?\". I think that your cookbook covers that pretty well.\nI agree with all that Ward said here so I won't be repetitive.\nAbout the custom for control, I think that you could focus in something that is not, well, a control. I agree that having a component to wrap a label + input for a11y purposes is not appealing because it has no advantage over doing it directly.\nWhat I would do personally is having a different example that is not related to a form control. For example, if you build a custom dropdown menu, you want to add a11y to say: \"Hey, this has a popup and it is actually closed / open\". For example, I have a dropdown toggle like:\ntypescript\n@Directive({\n  selector: '[myDropdownToggle]',\n  host: {'class': 'dropdown-toggle', 'aria-haspopup': 'true', '[attr.aria-expanded]': '_dropdown.open'}\n})\nIn this case, you don't expect people to write a custom dropdown directly but instead having a custom control for it, so teaching this good practices is something that works very well.\nLeaving this aside, one of the features I like from the \"hidden element\" is to mirror a feature that is not available for everyone. If you have a rating component for example, something like (simplified):\nhtml\n<i class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-star\"></i>\nas a star, ok, visually you see the star, but it is a good idea of having something like:\nhtml\n <span class=\"visually-hidden\">(*)</span>\nSo having both you have the visual clue (star icon) and the non visual representation.\nI love a11y so please, keep your good work of making people aware that this is a necessity.\n. Sounds exciting friend. I thought I knew some a11y but there are some stuff I never heard about, so I am expecting to see it :)\n. Ohh, that is a classic typo.\nThank you sir.\n. Personally I think it is good as is because that message is scoped to the concrete tutorial and its tools. \nIt is an easy going tutorial to teach the basic of Angular 2 and I personally think that we should try to maintain the reader within the tutorial context. The user should be focused on learning Angular 2 at this point.\nWebpack will be properly covered in its own page here in the docs.\nCheers.\n. Tooling and stuff will be covered outside the tutorial context. To be honest I don't know if the tutorial will have some of that in the future.\nFeel free to open issues like this if you feel that something is not right.\n. Not sure what is the status of this, but this is not an issue for this repository. This is only for docs issues.\n. Sure, let me read it and I will comment out the little details I see\n. So I read it, very nice, I like it. I left you a few comments but let's see what @wardbell has to say about them.\nThe only part I found more problematic is the \"Integration with Http\" one. I love what we are doing with the tutorial, about going the \"the whole nine yards\" (explaining everything) and that part is a bit rushed.\nTo be honest, I am not sure what to do here. Perhaps I would add a few snippets in how you import all the needed stuff and how I apply them (including the in memory stuff). Give a little explanation (basically the one you put about not using a real http server but an in memory one) and put a subsection linking to the detailed documentation.\nThe idea is to not force the user to go to another page to complete the tutorial.\nWDYT?\n. I think that it is better to reach some middle ground. Not giving all the details like the attached document nor leaving the user do it by himself. A little information + snippets + link to more details is a good middle ground for me.\nI don't think that people have a Heroes API so they are more likely going to do what yo do in the tutorial, so we need to explain them how to do it \"our way\" and if they want to implement so real backend, they can see that as an exercise.\n. In my opinion, you did an awesome job with the new change. Not too much nor too little.\n. You can use snagit or if you use mac, gifgrabber. Then simply move the .gif into resources and commit it.\n. @bennadel If you have too much trouble with the e2e, just ping me and I help you.\n. @bennadel It is lovely.\n. The JS version is not using System.js. Are you getting any error?\n. Works in both places.\nThe style guide will have a section about where to load your providers. When a decision is made, we will update the guides and examples.\n. Thank you sir, I created a PR to fix it :+1: \n. Oh sorry. For a repro.\ngulp serve-and-sync\nLeaving the command running puts my CPU to 100%\n\nOSX: El Capit\u00e1n\nNode 5.10.1\n. I am going to close this. That concrete link is deprecated and if there is a broken link, that should be reported at angular repo.\n. Ill close this and merge #1169 ASAP.\n. Doing what exactly? We need more info.\n. This repository is for the documentation. So I figured you had a problem with one of our examples.\n. No, it is not. That being said, if you are going to open an issue in the code repo, better have a plunker reproduction or something to work with. That stacktrace doesn't say anything relevant.\nOn the other hand, if it is more of a question type of thing, better try stackoverflow :)\n. With the new tsconfig doing commonjs, I can use the same.\nLocal package.json is because two things:\na) I need a lot of webpack related libraries (css-loader, extract-text-webpack-plugin, html-loader, html-webpack-plugin, jasmine-core, null-loader, phantomjs-prebuilt, raw-loader, style-loader, ts-loader, webpack, webpack-dev-server, webpack-merge). It is like 15 new libraries to add to our common package.json\nb) the scripts are actually different (this is more problematic). Our package.json runs tsc and lite-server, I need to run webpack server.\nSo I really need my own package.json for webpack. The rest are the exact same thing and doesn't need replacement, well, except the node_modules that comes with the package.json.\nOh lies, needs an extra typing too but that is way less problematic.\nFor the time being, I am updating this to new world.\nPS: Yeah, I could ignore npm scripts and run everything differently for protractor sake and teach something different for the cookbook.\n. Your solution is indeed the simpler way to make this roll, but I am afraid of ending with a package.json big  enough if we start adding more build tools cookbooks. Also I remember @teropa needing a custom solution too.\nLet me throw an idea here:\nThe way our e2e works is by looking for a example-config.json in a guide and if found, will add the boilerplate to it and run 1-2 npm scripts to launch a server and test.\nWhat if we add a custom-config.json file as a \"flag\" so when protractor reads it, instead of moving boilerplate to it, will run npm install in it and then running those npm scripts that will launch a server (those custom guides will have a way to launch a server that protractor can work with) and be tested.\nDownsides are having lot of node_modules (one for each custom guide) but as a upside we can have more custom guides without interfering with your general tooling.\n. Missing files added. I added the karma.conf.js (in reality karma.webpack.conf.js). It is needed because that one redirects to the one at config/.\ntest-shim added too (I changed the name to match the CLI and that name is globally ignored).\nFor workflow, you npm start (`npm run start:webpack for us in the tooling). That will update the page every time we change something.\nFor testing you can do npm test (npm run test:webpack for us) and that will listen for any changes and re-run tests.\nChanges are fast enough :)\n. I am going to make a final sweep to verify that everything is in order.\n. No one will ever know this was a cookbook once. Job done.\n. Let me double check, perhaps some files are missing.\n. Of course not. You know where you can find me.\n. What's the status of this PR? \ud83d\udc4d \n. Or maybe we should change Microsoft's guidelines :)\nI like the underscore for this cases.\n. Problem with Microsoft guidelines is that they are good for their usage but could be not the case of Angular 2.\nFor example, you can do like:\n<dir #dir></dir>\n{{dir.foo}}\n{{dir._bar}}\nIn the first case, you are using foo which is ok to use, but  in the second case you are using _bar which is not ok to use.\nWithout the underscore, we have no way on telling \"hey, you shouldn't use this, don't come later telling that I didn't warn you\".\nWe can't prevent (at least that I know) people from accessing everything inside the component, even private stuff, so at least the underscore gives them a big hint.\nSee: http://plnkr.co/edit/FRqM6psseX9dJ9aHMfQh?p=preview\n. That too.\n. That is not a problem. Once the styleguide is in and we have our conventions stablished, we will update all the doc.\n. Oh, forgot about that one too. Here we have no choice I think, the modifiers won't work in this case so underscore is needed.\n. because private is enough \"private\", you don't need anything extra.\nunderscore was used in the past with javascript because there was no private, but there is no need nowadays.. There is no problem at all if you do that. The most important thing is being consistent. Either you do it or you don't. But not in certain files only and not in others.. So we still get reports of this problem.\nWe have a glossary from google with a lot of broken regions and the good one. We should think about removing one and redirect to the good one or similar.\n. Perhaps not the best issue for this, but what do you think about moving \"Basic - Overview\" from where it sits now? It is like an awesome entry point for the doc itself but is not that visible in there.\nPS: That documents probably need a bit of rework for the proposed changes in here.\n. Update to this too. @thelgevold could you please update the prose now that there is no directives array so the paragraph where you mention it (for the recursive thing).\nI can do it, but I prefer that the original author does it :)\n. > Coupling the style guide with specific testing framework, test runner sounds like a bad idea.\nTotally agree. Also, there are people who don't like Jasmine and use Mocha or something else with success.\n. Yes, I would simply tone down this one. Instead of \"Use foo\", \"We recommend foo\".\n. > Suggestion for using a linter sounds like a good idea to me, however, I'm not sure if we should mention tslint explicitly.\nI think the same. I would personally suggest to use a linter and nothing more.\n\nnoImplicitAny could be too strict for some projects, however, providing only a suggestion for explicitness seems good to me.\n\nWe are already suggesting that in the \"Typescript Configuration\" project. So we could it from there if we add it to the style guide.\n. I peeked into the source and it doesn't seem to return a promise. So I am closing this.\n. We have a duplicated 05-15. Lets promote Don't Prefix Output Properties to 05-16 and Put Presentation Logic in the Component Class to 05-17\n. We have a duplicated 05-15.

The majority of those rules are working nicely with the style guide (we have those rules in master right now), just two exceptions I removed at #1229 \n. As a note for this, our guide has different prefixes to show different concepts so this rule makes the lint to fail on those cases.\nRule is better for a concrete project than this site.\n. I am not seeing the issue on my machine. Are you sure you are using the right doctype?\n. Closing as I merged this to the PR6.\n. Merged then.\n. Merged then.\n. Closing as merged in the PR 6.\n.

There is one big issue that we missed, let me see if is that and I put a PR right away.\n. #1244 That is your blocking issue @ericjim \n. I agree on this, but not sure \"where\" we should do it.\n. We can put it on the glossary and link it in the guide at least the first time.\n. I fixed that already.\n. Thank you, forgot to update that bit.\n. Anything that could be potentially wrong deserves a pull request / issue.\nWe will take a peek to see what is going on.\nThank you.\n. All tests are passing too (e2e).\n. My reasoning behind this change was to leave it with the same content as before. There are 3 cases in this file where we give such instructions. \nI can modify later today this PR to get rid of all of them in a good way. \nPS: there are no other file with instructions as far as I  can remember. ToH routing had one. \n. @wardbell I updated the PR. All 3 cases where any installation is performed is now gone without affecting the lecture.\nin the Rxjs part I left some parts of the old explanation but I think they sense in that context.\n. Seems to be fixed on FF46. We can close this then.\n. Hold. Forgot two things. There is a #tbd link to system.js config part. And a sub section ( the one with //TODO) that needs to be removed or moved into \"configuring System.js\".\nWill update later \n. This is good for review now.\n. Thank you. Will take a look \n. Seems to be fixed at #1224 so we just need to wait :)\n. This is fixed by now.\n. Let's continue in #1502\n. I like the TS changes Patrice. Lot of good stuff in here. One question: What are those new blocks you are defining there?\n. If I am not mistaken, the output of that changes every RC, so the screenshot is probably out of date.\n/cc @filipesilva \n. Yes, that does fix it. Thanks.\n. Now that you mention it @mrkiffie, you are right, this only fixes the symptom. Let see if @blackpr wants to update his PR or you can create a new one.\n. I also added plunker support (it was pointing to new router demos too)\n. Also the API to point to deprecated.\n. Fixed at https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/ts-to-js.html. I need more information. the systemjs.config.js is pulling both so you should be able to use the deprecated one.\n. Are you following the tutorial from zero? (I mean copying the quickstart by hand, etc). Can I see your package.json?\n. We are going to move this recommendation from Do to Consider.\nThe CLI adds the entries for yourself and Webpack support this out of the box.\n. I like all your points there @jmcooper.\nOne of the reasons of doing a barrel for a single export is for consistency as you said. It is better not to have some imports on folder and some imports on direct files.\n. This is going to be reviewed again soon when we update the style guide for RC5.\n. Fix the frontend masters indentation while you are there \n. Sounds good to me \ud83d\udc4d \n. Thanks. Fixing\n. You are trying to read a work in progress guide. That link is not even \"public\".\nWe are working on it and will be up and ready soon :)\n. Oh, that is a good catch.\nThe issue is that we moved the old guide from router to router-deprecated and used router for the new router documentation which is the one in the works. We forgot to update all links to it. Will fix.\n. This got fixed I think but in any case, this document is never going to see daylight, we will rewrite it for the new router.\n. Some nice people fixed this.\n. As @chalin pointed out, this won't work on the live plunker, so I am open to ideas here.\n. I won't accept this PR unless the background is #BADA55 (is green too)\njust kidding.\n. Known issue.\n. Fixed.\n. @wardbell I like falsy more. What do you think?\n. Hey @chalin. Is this still an issue? We fixed e2e tests to report the errors better, the plunkers are fixed too...\n. Thanks, I missed that point.\n. I am not sure I understand this PR. The router chapter is being rewritten right now.\n. That router page is supposed to be hidden because it is the work in progress for the new router documentation. Problem is that it is still linked to some other docs (instead of linking to the deprecated one). There is a PR already to make the tutorial link to the deprecated router for the time being.\n. Yes. All bad filenames regions are going to be fixed.\nSorry for the inconvenience.\n. Can you explain what you mean with \"add barrels to cookbook\"?\n. Oh, I see. Always better to add a description, because I was thinking in something different :)\n. Let's close this in favor of #1458 \n. Ready for business.\n. Lovely\n. Lovely\n. > I don't see the changes to the \"services\" that you mention above. Where are they?\nI just changed the excerpt to say that it is an example so it shouldn't be coded in the real app. Apart from that, I exposed there my personal opinion on what we should do, but didn't do the changes.\nSo the idea here is to agree on something so I can update this PR with those changes.\n. The person that gave the feedback things that the gray box (that explains hierarchical injection) is a bit confusing and should be explained more \"step by step\". I can understand that the gray box is a bit \"complicated\", but that gray box is just an excerpt of another guide we have, so instead of rewording the gray box, we can point people to the original guide.\nThere is also another part in services that talks about injections and containers and that person is confused about the word \"containers\". Containers is a DI concept but our DI guides never say \"containers\", that could be confusing.\n. @wardbell Ready. I got rid of all those excerpt that tries to explain too much about DI and hierarchical DI and replaced them with links (or nothing for the appendix).\n. TS changes works for me.\n. TS changes works for me.\n. Those are known issues my friend. We need to make some fixes for the API.\n. I just installed all the dart stuff on my machine (OSX), made several tests on this and works like a charm.\nAwesome work @chalin\n. Different OS so your mileage may vary. \nIt works perfect for me \n. I think we fixed this when we did all those changes to protractor. I just tried and:\n```\nDoc Sample Protractor Results for (ts|js) on 2016-07-25 14:55:13\n  Slow Mode: npm install, webdriver update, and boilerplate copy\n  Filter: template-syntax\nApplication at public/docs/_examples/template-syntax/ts failed to transpile.\nSuites passed:\nSuites failed:\n  public/docs/_examples/template-syntax/ts\nElapsed time: 3.553 seconds\n```\n. @alexwolfe WDYT? I think it is fine as it is with the tooltips.\n. Closing as we will migrate to a new design soon.. Didn't know about that. Will check.\n. Ouch, thanks. @wardbell this one is good to be merged.\nI checked all .jade files but I surely skipped this one.\n. CLI was always having main.ts in src/.\nAbout the barrel, they export more than one thing, so that is fine for now I guess.\n. And you are right, just to make it simpler I forgot about windows.\nI vote for rimraf, less intrusive than having to add a whole plugin.\nWill fix it.\n. Oh, rimraf was already installed, so even better :)\n. There is a link at the end with the image. \nAbout public, it exist that way to match what the CLI outputs. If we change that in the CLI, we will change it here too\n. You are right an all points. Fixing.\n. I love what you did with the prose.\nWhat I am a bit wary about is that now we are mixing a lot of markdown with jade. Sometimes we have links in markdown, sometimes in jade, headers in markdown, sometimes in jade... We need to make our mind. I don't really want to me \"writing markdown\" but having also to use jade.\n. I opened #1400 to research about the github way (icon on hover) and to be used in all the docs.\n. Yeah, personally it is not like the greatest idea ever, but nowadays, people is really familiar with Github and since they do it, I personally see for those hover icons when I want to share something.\n. We don't have SystemJS Stuff on quickstart right now, but what about SystemJS explanations?\n. Testing docs is a work in progress. There is nothing to worry about :)\n. There is #2198 so we will continue there.\n. I like it, but I would make it follow the style-guide. That means having /heroes/heroes.component.ts|html|css, /heroes/hero-detail/hero-detail.component.ts|html|css. Service renamed as hero.service.ts, model renamed to hero.model.ts and both put into a shared folder. That way you will have more barrels too so the cookbook would be more interesting.\nLeaving that aside, I have no problem with the prose :)\nEDIT: Service is having the right name, you just mistyped it.\nEDIT 2: You can use a .filetree to represent... you file tree.\n. Oh, final call here is from @wardbell :)\n. I see what you mean. I will give it a thought.\n. The hero-list is also a barrel, so it needs to export too :)\n. Could you also please fix the indentation? You are mixing spaces with tabs. We use 2 spaces.\n. If we see the style-guide, each folder is a barrel. That means that app/heroes exports a barrel, app/heroes/hero-detail/ exports a barrel, app/heroes/shared another barrel, etc.\n. We are promoting that on the style guide, but I will double check first.\n. After a conversation, yes, we add that even if it is one export.\n. Plunker fix is on the way. Could you please update with the barrel stuff? :)\n. Or perhaps makeLocalExample? I personally don't like example1, example2 kind of names because you can easily forget which is which.\n. Thanks :)\n. Local uses .js and plunker .ts. \n. Let me explain better now that I am not at phone.\nIf we have a app/heroes as a barrel and app/heroes/shared as another barrel, we need to add extra systemjs configuration like:\nSystem.config({\n  packages: {\n    'app/heroes': {main: 'index.js', defaultExtension: 'js'},\n    'app/heroes/shared': {main: 'index.js', defaultExtension: 'js'}\n  }\n});\nThat won't work on a plunker because we transpile \"on the fly\" so we need to do:\nSystem.config({\n  packages: {\n    'app/heroes': {main: 'index.ts', defaultExtension: 'ts'},\n    'app/heroes/shared': {main: 'index.ts', defaultExtension: 'ts'}\n  }\n});\nSo we need a way to have different \"extra config\" for local and plunker.\n. This cookbook needs RC5 update, and I guess Forms update (not sure about this).\n. @jevenson There is a new option to add reactions to issues. +1 comments doesn't help.\n. You need to use node 5 and npm 3.x to make this work.\nAlso, the bad region issue is fixed in master and will be live soon.\n. Yes. All examples (except routing, waiting for a new new router) show something on the screen that makes them testable.\nNext step is test them / fix some problems with barrels to make the guide more accurate.\n. SOUNDS_GOOD_TO_ME\n. We added this already.\n. All of that is on the way, you don't have to worry about that.\n. Oh, hadn't time to tell about more things to update. Let me PR.\n. The TS part is good for me.\n. Change webpack please. typings.1.json\n. And quickstart and I guess some other too.\n. Yes, not a html 5 mode lover \n. The problem with this kind of conventions is that you need to pick one and that is the one that made most sense for us. That doesn't mean that the other conventions are wrong or not as good as the selected one.\nThe idea is to pick one for your project and stick with it.\n. I see al they \"why\" in there. Tell me what you think that could be improved and I will.\n. Thanks, but this one is actually legit.\nWe updated the in-memory-web-api like yesterday and we put an index.js so importing from angular2-in-memory-web-api now does the job directly.\nSo, you only need to bump your version to latest.\n. How are you trying to use it?\n. Thank you!\nTutorial was written before we made those changes and we forgot to make those adjustments when we published it.\nGood catch.\n. Please rereview\n. Hush googlebot, Tero and Jesus agree on those commits.\n. I made the code lintable (I had to ignore one file from the gulpfile until https://github.com/mgechev/codelyzer/issues/60 is fixed.\nI also removed (saved it locally tho) the future features of animation per petition of @matsko .\n. On master\n. You are probably trying to push to our repo and since you don't have permission, you get an error. You need a fork, a branch there and then create a PR.\nOr I can fix that for you, your choice.\n. What's the status for this?\n. I am not sure about this :/\n/cc @wardbell \n. Yeah :)\n. I broke this, yay.\n. Lets continue at #1578\n. For me is perfect, easier for the eye.\n. Thank you. Big problem here is that we get no grammar correction on .jade files :/\n. Closing this. We can still check it closed and we can do a better demo with the new tooling too.\n. Closing this. We can still check it closed and we can do a better demo with the new tooling too.\n. I would even rename \"style-guide\" because it is not really a style guide, more of a set of tools you have at your disposal.\n. The API documentation issues needs to be reported in the angular repo. \nSorry for the inconvenience. \n. I love this idea.\n. Fix on its way.\nThank you.\n. How did you reach the router page? I mean, that page is hidden, so I guess we have some document pointing at it which is wrong. \nYour PR is good, but that document is half done so missing regions are expected. We probably need to rewrite the chapter, so spending time on it, is wasting time. \nThanks. \n. The -- foo bar baz that is to add more params to the command.\nIf npm run typings executes  ./node_modules/.bin/typings, by doing npm run typings -- install foo you are actually doing ./node_mobules/.bin/typings install foo.\nSo anything that can be used with a command, can be used with npm run as well.\nThe issue here I guess is that you are not using typings 1.x (which made a breaking change and the way of installation changed). In fact, you can read that the problem here is that it doesn't find the lib, not that it is not recognizing the command.\n\nI am closing this.\n. Apparently the Linux on travis doesn't like it at all, so I will keep investigating.\n. Fixed it at last, thanks to Filipe.\n. Fixed at #1561 \n. e2e won't work, I think it is due our issue with protractor & chrome  (sendKeys).\n. @wardbell this PR is pretty much a mess. Close?\n. googlebot, those commits are ok to be contributed.\n. Added that feature because travis won't pass without that.\n. Awesome idea, we really need that.\n. Should we close this @wardbell ?

I definitely broke the Dart part, but @chalin will fix it when this hit master.\n. Also changed a blue box where it explains differences from Dart to Typescript in regard of provide. I changed the prose there, but feel free to change it too.\n. Works for me \n. Sounds good, my only complain is... why Link2? What happened with link1?\n. From here I can see they are restricted to E by default.\n. Yes, seems that it is missing some files. We ignore a lot and I manually checked all of them but I surely missed that one at least.\nThis PR doesn't entirely supersede that one, just half of it. I left it open as a reminder that I need to do the other half of the job.\n. I like all of that.\nWhat I would personally do is: Add all those things that doesn't really change the game. Changing invalid <labels> for something else, removing non clickable elements from where they don't belong. Etc.\nFor big game changers, say adding new events for keyboard, the hover and focus thing... I would definitely add that too.\nWhat do you think (both @wardbell and @AlmeroSteyn) if we create a new kind of \"section\" (you know, a colored block) for a11y? A11y is a real thing, we should promote it everywhere and we could add this colored section (in green, I like green) with extra information.\nFor example in this case, we can add a bit of text + snippet to say that we add a keydown.enter event here for accessibility purposes, bla bla.\nAt least for the tutorial, we need to teach the best practices there.\n.

Well, for ourselves at this project yes. But we are a few that use NVM, the rest doesn't.\n. That is right.\nI don't like to constrain people to use certain versions and only recommend.\nBut I don't really mind adding this.\n. I am closing this because I need this for another PR and I will just add it there.\n. I am closing this because I need this for another PR and I will just add it there.\n. I reviewed it.\nA good thing we do in the cookbooks is to add a \"Learn more at XXX\" with certain things.\nI missed it for two topics: What's dirty and what's touched. That explanation of why we want it is good, but a \"learn more\" and link to the appropriate part of the form guide would be lovely.\nSame happens with \"controls, controlGroup\", a learn more would be nice.\nOn the other hand, you mention twice that \"template-driven\" can't be unit tested. Why? I haven't try but it should be posible by changing some values, triggering changes and checking the if model has errors.\nYou mention that we may call buildForm at ngOnInit. I would do that directly. It is just 2-3 lines of code and sounds better :)\nLast, please remove the underscore from private variables (and update the prose too).\nGood work, I learn a lot there.\n. I don't really know what's covered on the other forms tutorial. If that is not covered (and the new form changes still use that stuff), I think we should do something to fix that.\n. Yes, that is outside the scope of this cookbook.\n. We recommend in other guides to leave constructor to initialize variables and the \"heavy\" stuff for ngOnInit.\nI don't think you need to explain that, just say that we use buildForm at ngOnInit and you are good to go. Same thing as you have now but changing \"constructor\" for that hook.\n. That works for me Deborah.\nLet see what @wardbell has to say.\n. Not really sure if I follow. \nCould you give more details? \n. We still recommend Observables, but we decided to show how to use Promises in the tutorial and then move that to Observables in the next part (which is going to be released soon).\n. Let's ping @chalin in here.\n. Let's ping @chalin in here.\n. This one LGTM but I will add a reminder that I need to change your \"add style.css to root\" because that will no longer true, soon.\n.

Yes, we had the API twice in the past, one really old version and a modern one. We got rid of the old, but old links will still show. \n\nSomething to fix yes \n. That got fixed. Thanks for reporting it.\n. While you are at it, could you please update the typings.1.json that could be there? (webpack)\n. And after we propagate this to all examples, no one cries?\n. ToH, the ultimate _example where we can try everything.\nIt is good for me then.\n. What kind of update?\n. This PR looks good to me but needs a rebase. That would be appreciated.\n. I left two comments on the prose, but the rest are good to me \ud83d\udc4d \n. Works for me.\n. Can you fix all the lint issues? gulp lint.\nThanks.\n. There is one issue on the tests too. Please fix.\n. Victor, what could we do in our end for this? I see that the interpolation config is on the ComponentMetadata API, couldn't we put a little text on there? All the other configs have explanation but this one.\n. I like it.\n. This is a bit of a nitpick, but could you please put your imports in alphabetic order and leave an space between angular imports and your own imports? You are doing that for almost all files but a few :)\nThanks!\n. While at it, I am going to debug travis again.\n. I saw that variable hack on protractor's repo and seems to work fine here.\nI vote for merge it and test it a few days.\n/cc @filipesilva \n. Yes, but this duplicates his PR again instead of fixing the concrete error.\nIf you don't mind, I am going to close this and let him fix it. I need the authors to be able to lint their solutions too.\n. Oh and thanks tho, I like the initiative like this, but would be problematic to merge if both PRs contain the same changes but a bit of difference.\n. That wouldn't do any good, so instead of 3 mins, it would be 5 :P\nLet him fix the lint errors. I want each author here to get used to lint their solutions.\n. Thanks mate, all that feedback is really appreciated.\nI will take a look at all those points.\n. Still open, so I don't think so. I will leave it open so I can fix it.\n. We changed the ToH chapter quite a bit lately and I checked all this points and I believe they are all fixed. Please open a new issue if you feel like something is still missing.\n. All the API is generated automagically from the Angular repository.\nThat means that all issues / fixes about the API should be made there. Here we just pull it from there and present it on screen.\nThat being said, if you go to the API REFERENCE and look for \"ngSwitch\" you can see the new \"ngSwitchCase\" and not the old \"ngSwitchWhen\". Same with the search box.\nSo I am not sure if there is any other course of action needed here.\n. Oh, I shouldn't really read issues asleep, you are right. My bad.\nFeel free to send a PR or I can do that for you if you want.\n. There are a lot of more usage of that than what that search gives to you.\nI will fix the cheatsheet myself since that is not that obvious to fix.\n. I am closing this in favor of #1710 \nSorry, he didn't see it and pushed a PR.\n. Ahhh~ love you very much.\n. We are implemeting a new search box. We will have this in mind.. @lazaridis-com I am curious, is that an script or something you have? I see you write a lot of stuff between []. Now we have a \"browser support\" guide that cover this.\n. Now we have a \"browser support\" guide that cover this.\n. There is an www folder that gets created with the static HTML files. You could use that.\n. Now that I mention it, I am not really sure in how to generate it. Will peek.\n. with gulp check-deploy a true offline docs are generated. We should separate that process from check-deploy tho.\n. You can use gulp build-compile\n. Yes, I recommended Brandon to create a several new styles and also check if this one was valid. When I went to bed, I realized that this style wouldn't even allow us to go live, and since it is not relevant right now, I vote to delete it.\n. I love this content.\nTo run e2e, you need to:\n$ gulp add-example-boilerplate (to install the node_modules & typings on the example) and just:\n$ gulp e2e --filter=security\nFor that to work there are some needed changes:\ne2e-spec.ts needs a 'use strict'; because we are transpiling to ES6.\nThen you need to run $ gulp lint because there are a couple of errors and in concrete one of them will make tsc not happy and not compile the example for the tests.\nThe examples have some errors too, I suggest running the example:\n$ cd public/docs/_examples/security/ts && npm start\nOnce those errors are fixed, e2e should run fine.\nPlease ping me if you need something else \ud83d\udc4d \n. Nice work. But there are still some lint errors.\n. Tests are fine, there is one failing but that is fixed in a different PR\n. Is not needed.\n. I like this style but I don't really like that Why (is not really clear for me).\n. Please do.\n. Proper solution will land possibly today.\n. That is definitely wrong. We can't remove it yet until we sweep all docs. \n. Yes. There is a pr for that. We can merge that \n. Closing it since there is a PR for it.\n. With the exception of the deprecated router, we are in RC3. Update your node & npm if you can't find it.\n. You are the man! Sounds perfect for me \ud83d\udcaf \n. What's the status of this @brandonroberts ?\n. Appreciated, but I don't advice spending time on the testing guide because it is going to be revamped soon.\n. We would need more information than that and if possible, a reproduction in plunker.\n. Merged on master.\n. Let's ping @brandonroberts \n. Whats your node and npm?\n. On the one hand, new angular packages need node 5.x and npm 3.x. We recommend Node 5.11.1 and latest npm.\nOn the other hand the in-memory-web-api will be updated in the coming days (you can still work with the project, that is a minor warning).\n. Seems like latest npm works too with node 4.x :)\n. What error gives you?\n. That will be fixed soon \n. latest NPM (3.x) and node 4.x+\n. That seems to be a problem of that concrete library. I suggest that you open a issue there. I believe that they have their peerDependencies wrong.\n. We have an issue with double glossary as seen #1123.\nSo we will continue there.\nThanks.\n. We are aware of that, but we haven't made a decision yet. \nI'll put it on my list of things to discuss. \n/cc @filipesilva \n. Thanks, fixing it.\n. I created a PR in the angular repo (this changes belong there) so I am closing this here.\nThanks again.\n. Yes, we fixed them in other PR\n. We have something going on #2850 . This repository is only for the docs. Please repost at the angular-cli repository.\n. Yes, something like that should be done. We will talk about that tomorrow I guess.\n. Those two failing tests are a known issue, completely unrelated to your changes. Forget about them for now, they are an issue on chrome and/or protractor.\n. I agree. We do crazy changes to the repo and be able to restart it to brand new condition without losing the branches (the problem of a fresh copy) is 200% needed.\n. There is a broken test. Please check :)\n. This needs rebase.\n. Thanks, I will write it down and see where we can add that.\n. Sorry sir, this is not a support forum.\nIs better for you to go to stackoverflow for that.\nThanks!\n. LGTM.\n. Both Filipe Silva @filipesilva and Jesus Rodriguez @foxandxss agree on this commits.\n. Yes please, I was getting some weird behaviors with this.\n. Photo is missing.\n. Just copy it (with the right size) on public/resources/images/bios and amend the PR here.\n. The return types are completely optional but I agree that we are not doing it consistently.\nThey are probably going out.\n. Some people think that they are unnecessary as they clutter the code too much. We are proposing removing them for the style guide, but is not a sure thing yet.\nFor the time being, if you like them, use them :)\n. Interesting, how does this work?\n. Sounds awesome.\n. I have mixed feelings about this. I understand that the tests shares a lot, but I feel like the tests are now a bit overkill for what they should accomplish.\nBut that is just me :/\n. Overkill in terms that we are creating too many files for something that should be simple.\nAnd yes, that is the good side of tests.\nI want the tests, that for sure. I also understand that toh is an special case for this.\n. please, we need this.\n. I am closing this, I updated it again on the RC4 commit.\n. I think I like this change.\n. It changed to another place in RC4 and our generated API is not showing it yet, if you need to reference a link, you will need this one:\nhttps://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/core/testing/TestComponentBuilder-class.html\nIs not working yet, but that ill be.\nEDIT: Oh, it does.\n. Everything will be fixed when RC4 gets out. That originated this URL move.\n. To be fixed at #1783 \n. This repo is for angular.io and not any of the subdomains. You are better opening an issue at the universal repo.\n. Sorry, this is not a support issue tracker.\nIs better to use stackoverflow for this kind of questions.\nThanks!\n. 2) those kind of things are the perfect match for the style guide.\n. Hello sir.\nIn the past I had a discussion with someone (could be even you) when I updated my own starter to use the version 2 of the plugin and the solution was something like that.\nNow, that doesn't mean that if I am doing wrong now, I shouldn't fix this.\nSay I want to use the html-loader for index.html because the users would like to have images on it. Also I don't want to rename the index file to anything than index.html.\nCould I be able to do something like:\ntemplate: '!!html!src/index.html'\nI am trying to see what the other big starters for angular does and seems like we are all doing to wrong :/\nThank you sir.\n. As today we have this:\n```\nhtmlLoader: {\n    minimize: false // workaround for ng2\n  },\n```\nDo I still need that loader for the plugin? And is that a external library?\n. html-loader minimization is broken for ng2 (I would need to check again). I had to disable it or otherwise it wouldn't be able to create a build production.\nSo lets go back to square one. What's the problem as today with this config? I mean, what are the users seeing that they are reporting those errors?\nI want to ping @TheLarkInn because he knows more about webpack and he could shed some light for me.\n. But that guide has the minimize: false I commented you earlier.\nIf there is something I can use to reproduce it locally with this config, I would gladly try and fix it.\n. Oh, I can reproduce it now.\nI tried:\nnew HtmlWebpackPlugin({\n  template: '!!html!src/index.html',\n  minify: false\n})\nWith no luck.\nI could use raw for the index, but what if the user wants to add an image say:\n<img src=\"foo\" />\nWithout html-loader they can't, unless you copy the image over the dist folder.\nI definitely don't want the minification because it breaks the index.html if you add angular2 code to it.\nWhy can't I use html-loader and disable minification? Should we raise an issue somewhere?\n. For some reason, this was fixed already. Sorry about that.\n. @chalin what is the status of this?\n. @chalin what is the status of this?\n. This got fixed in RC5 changes.\n. Sounds good for me.\n. TS part works for me.\n. Oh, we need this because we have the first multiline annotation with BrowserModule.\n. I like the idea.\n. You have to create a karma.conf.js at root. It is specified in the guide.\n. Please, don't create a PR without description. I would like to know why do we want this change.\n. It is defined in the component too.\n. Thank you sir.\n. Put the LGTM too fast :P. The photo needs to be 240x208.\n. So this fix the two ToH issues with fragments? Those are fine on the .jade.\n. I like what I see Brandon.\nYou need to rebase because the style-guide change is already in master (I did it personally because I created that example).\nThe only remaining thing is the upgrade guide that I will tackle myself too.\n. Animation is a different issue. I will fix it separately.\n. This is LGTM, only needing the setInterval stuff.\n. I see.\nLet me take a peek.\n. After a lot of runs, this seems to be working perfect.\n. IF there is no files array. node_modules is auto excluded.. Thanks but I believe that the text is correct now.\n. I like it, but it needs a bit of @wardbell magic on the English \ud83d\udc4d \n/cc @johnpapa.\n. I am part of that team too (along with @pkozlowski-opensource) and yeah, we would like an entry there. I also agree on the alphabetical order, not giving anyone any \"promoted position\".\n/cc @naomiblack @ericjim \n. For the time being I feel like they confuse the end user. They click the link, nothing happen, they search for the content, it is not there.\nWe can add it back when we create the first style.\n. Different thing I guess.\n. The important part is more the  html than the typescript. When we say \"don't put logic\", we mean:\nhtml\nAverage power: {{totalPowers / heroes.length}}\nThat is logic, you are doing some computation on the html.\nThe DO example removes that computation from there and moves it to the class.\n. That is our recommendation. \n. In a general note. We are using double quotes \" for the HTML and you are using single quotes ' here in your example. Why?\nIs better to maintain consistency.\n. On the templates.\n<div foo='10'>\nvs\n<div foo=\"10\">\n. Hello!\nThis repository is only for the documentation. If you have any question regarding Angular 2 usage, please go to StackOverflow and use the angular2 tag.\nThank you!\n. Ouch, thanks.\n. The prose has changed significantly. If you believe this needs that change, please open a new pull request.\n. We don't force anyone to use a certain folder structure. We encourage a team to use a structure that works for them and just be consistent with it.\nI am closing this because there is no action we could do as today.\nThanks :)\n. This needs update on other places were we pull typescript 1.x (like systemjs for plunkers and perhaps more places)\n. Yes please. I need it to work on some other stuff tomorrow \ud83d\udc4d \n. I created several issues at the spanish repo so feel free to comment on one of them so I can assign them to you.\nFor a reference in how to translate, please check the chinese repo. Basically we leave the english version and we mix it with the spanish translation so the end users can toggle between languages.\nFor any other question, feel free to ask me.\n. @naomiblack what should we do with this? Now that we have a official effort on the korean translation?\n. Hello,\nIt is not an accurate map to show where Angular is used. If it were accurate, we would need to paint the whole world in red :)\nI am from Spain, I work for this project and we don't have an icon either.\n. Dependencies shouldn't never be required by a library, that is my opinion.\nBoth zone.js and reflect.js are third party dependencies. You could replace reflect.js with core-js if you find it to be a better alternative.\nOn the other hand, Zone needs to be required as soon as possible, before everything else (except some shims), angular, tooling... So the best way is requiring it using a script tag.\n. Closing in favor of https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/10072\n. I am sorry my friend, this repo is for the docs and not for support.\nYou should go to stackoverflow and ask there.\n. Sure.\n. do you have the index.ts file that exports the component and that added to the system config?\n/cc @filipesilva \n. So from now own with ditch styles.css over this?\n. I fixed the race condition by sending a done parameter which gulp supports.\nThe problem is that we would like to have the new a2docs.css in e2e tests.\nWe were never \"waiting\" for copyExampleBoilerplate to finish copying on e2e because the other tasks would take way more time than that so when the tests were to run, everything was copied. That didn't change now.\nSo as soon as you double check that the race condition is gone (and remove the gutil.log) we could merge this and if you want, look for a better solution for this.\nI could present that alternative solution in a different PR to not clutter this one.\n. I like but I don't feel confortable having to put the  --no-dart in all my commands. Shouldn't it be otherwise? --dart or something like that. There is only 2 people in here that does dart and we have a l10n project to localize this project and all of them needs to run this command too and none of them really care about dart.\n. We broke Node 4 support with that commit.\n/cc @wardbell \n. I cannot reproduce. Is this still happening to you? If so, please, reopen :)\n. Will investigate.\n. It is false in our tslint. That shouldn't happen.\n. Ok ok, I understand your problem properly now.\nLet me first ask you a question: You have a tslint.json (obviously). From where did you pick it? Is from one of our repos or did you made it up?\n. I see.\nThen where you need to look for this errors is the tslint webpage\nYou need to understand our position. There are dozens of rules for tslint and that gives you hundred of possible combinations.\nThat concrete error is simple enough. It discourages you of doing foo['bar']. As any other rule, they are optional and there are people who likes it on or off.\nI suggest you to compile the set of rules that you like and, if by reading a guide you get a conflicting rule, modify our code to fit your needs.\nThe set of rules that we have is what we agreed back in the day, but that doesn't mean that our set of rules are the best rules, is simply yet another opinion.\n. I am closing this.\nThe typings thing will come as soon as a bug is fixed on a type.\n. Please reopen (at the quickstart repo is possible) if this is still a problem.\n. Pinging @thelgevold \n. Thanks, let's continue at #2004\n. Not sure if this is valid right now. We changed the guide a bit and I think that this PR is not valid anymore.\n/cc @brandonroberts \n. Before that snippet there is an explanation of what routerLinkActive is.\n. I see. You are right on this one, but the solution is not the appropriate one. If you modify that file, the routerLinkActive will disappear altogether.\n. When we create a guide, we have two things:\n- The complete example, that can be run from the terminal or via plunker.\n- Extra files to show previous or alternative steps  (those .1., .2., etc)\nThat means, that the app.component.ts is the one that ends in the final example, so we can't use it to show a previous step.\n. I am sorry sir, we changed that chapter quite a bit and apart from the typos, I am not sure if the other part is relevant. Could you please rebase this PR or open a new one? Thank you sir.\n. Closing in favor of #1957 \nThanks for reporting it :)\n. All our code runs using end to end tests, so it is probably something you missed in your code.\n. Seems like it is related to https://github.com/angular/angular.io/issues/1875\n. I am going to lock this thread. Please continue at #1875 so we don't have the same discussion twice.\n. I like it.\n. Weird, I think I tried that way in the past and it didn't work. But it certainly does.\nCan you change the systemjs.config.plunker.js as well?\n. You can't do that there.\nJust run gulp build-plunkers and then go to any example, inside their ts folder, there is a plunker.no-link.html. Open that file in your browser and you will go to plunker.\n. You need node 5.\n. That is weird. I will check.\n. I'll do tomorrow \n. That is on the works, but is not available right now because there are some blocking issues with @types (that doesn't affect the core but affect us).\nIf you don't mind, I am going to close this and continue at #1872\n. I want to try a different approach to live examples involving embedded plunkers.\n. @wardbell so I like the end result, perhaps the \": void\" ones are a bit verbose tho.\nIn one case, we show an empty method, so I had to put it with : void and then when we put the data in it, I swapped that with the real Promise<Hero[]>.\nWhat do you think?\n. Dup of #1875 \n. You are right, I was told to do this, never put it down in my TODO list and forgot.\nWill fix.\n. Ping @DeborahK \n. Ping @StephenFluin \n. Thanks. I will take a peek :)\n.

Closing this, I don't think we are going to do this for the time being.\n. Closing this, I don't think we are going to do this for the time being.\n. Uhm? It is working for me. \n\n/cc @thelarkinn\n. I am trying right now (RC5, ngModules). I created a foo.component.ts that uses a foo.component.html and works nice.\n. Fixed on another PR.. ping @brandonroberts. Can you give some insight?\n. No. For some reason only webpack complains about it and only on build.\nPerhaps if we do system.js builds on the other examples, it will complain the same, but since we don't, we are green on that.\nSo in short, when we build a webpack application with 0.1.4 it gives warnings (a reflect or webpack bug, yet to confirm) and errors, and that is because reflect uses a really old typescript to create the final build.\nIf we were to build our examples (we don't) we would probably get the same errors. And since webpack is the only one with the errors, is the only one complaining.\nIdeally we would fix webpack if the warnings are a bug on their side and reflect to update the typescript version.\nShort them solution is to move to core-js and personally I see this like a long term solution because we can get all our polyfills in one place.\nThe problem is that the build is broken and we cannot leave it as is.\n. This needs rebase my friend.\n. the gulpfile doesn't seem to affect the TS part.\n. Just a random thought. Since this seems to be a somewhat \"temporary\" guide. Shouldn't we create like a new visible spot for people to see this guide? And perhaps delete it in some time.\n. For some reason, this line makes it fail:\ncomputePathsProcessor.pathTemplates.push({\n  docTypes: ['api-list-data'],\n  pathTemplate: 'api-list-audit.json',\n  outputPathTemplate: '${path}'\n});\n. There is a fix for this on a PR. Let's continue there.\n. We added a message at pipes chapter where we tell the user about this problem.\nWe decided not to add all the needed warnings to the quickstart.\n. I made that mistake, moved that, never realized that there was a precise explanation of where to find it.\nWill fix. Thank you.\n. ping @ericjim \n. Closing this, if that is a mistake, we reopen.. Sorry, this is not the proper place for questions. You should use stackoverflow.\n. I need to double check, because that concrete task had a problem with ordering and I think I had to remove the return to make it work so I will check later to see that it still does the job in the right order.\n. Doesn't seem to be affecting the ordering, so LGTM.\n. The last part is not needed anymore with NgModule, about the issue, ping @brandonroberts \n. Leaving the comment aside, I don't dislike it, the new Hero class makes it read better.\n. I don't have a strong opinion, but you can open a PR :)\n. That is not possible right now. A few things needs to be changed so we can use AoT with webpack like that.\nCheck https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/8759 for more info.\nI am going to close this, but be sure that I would update the guide when possible.\n. The guide will be updated with AOT support in early February.. This needs rebase, but I like what I see.\n. What was the problem with the e2e here?\n. I fixed that in #3095 @hhubik. You will see it as soon as we upload the site again. LGTM\n. Honestly, I am not sure if the link at the footer should point to angular or here, but the contributing.md has to be changed.\n. Closing this since we are migrating to a new site and we will address this.. I cannot reproduce it.\n. You are right, we don't need it. I reverted that.\n. Apparently not. I was having some weird issues but I guess I was doing something wrong. So sorry.\nRemoved it.\n. My bad. Will look into a fix.\n. Closing this and let's continue at https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/11070\n. Lgtm\n. Let me take a peek.\n. LGTM\n. They do and I did that fix too. Problem is that there is a bug in system.js and when you do all the import nicely in one line, you get a mysterious localhost:3000/traceur is missing. Or something like that.\nBasically system.js will run your code anyway but if you do it in two lines like that, it works.\n. Each page that contains images or other kind of things that are not text, will get that effect.\nPing @naomiblack @ericjim\n. Closing as we are migrating to a new design. I will make sure this won't happen.. What is the status of this?\n. I am good with it, but I am unsure if the new version is a bit harder to understand (the setTimeout changes).\n. Coming in #2161\n. No, not really. Let me explain.\nWith Webpack, you need to require templates and styles like that description says:\ntemplateUrl: require('./my.template.html'),\nstyleUrls: [require('./some.css')]\nNow, there is a loader for Webpack that allows you to \"ignore\" the require like:\ntemplateUrl: './app.component.html',\nstyleUrls: ['./app.component.css']\nIn reality that is doing the same thing as earlier but the loader is doing the require for you behind the scenes. We do this because the CLI@Webpack does the same thing as well.\nNow, that being said, the text doesn't match what the example says. The problem is that I can write an example for Webpack for the Webpack guide and then you can \"borrow\" parts of that example in other different guides. So I updated the Webpack example and explanations and since this guide is \"borrowing\" one snippet to make an example, the explanation is no longer true.\nSo thanks, I am going to think and see what's the best outcome for this.\n. prose needs change\n. Just change the references from userName to user.\n. Necesitas cambiar el texto tambi\u00e9n, no solo el c\u00f3digo. La gu\u00eda vaya.\n. Cierto, aunque userName aparece varias veces en otros c\u00f3digos. Creo que ser\u00e1 mejor que cambies user por userName en title.component y cambies el texto.\n\nTrue, but userName appears a couple of times in the other files. Will be better if you change user to userName in title.component and change the text.\n. Here is my feedback after reading it:\n- We should make this guide to work with the Quickstart. I tried and it works, it just needs some tweaks:\n  - The number of dependency to install coming from a quickstart project.\n  - Where are the aot stuff generated. (I get it at /aot and not /app/aot)\n  - More problematic is having to modify the index.html to use the bundle.js\nThe prose itself is good, but I feel like it is too rushed in some parts, like wanting to make it as small as possible but not explaining some stuff:\n- It is missing all the rollup dependencies (rollup, the plugins, the babel es2015...).\n- In the Rollup section you talk about tsconfig and I feel like that should be in its own section.\n  - Also I would put an snippet showing the tsconfig more immediately than forcing the user to scroll down to see the final result.\n- I don't like how the Rollup section is structured. You show the final rollup.js and then you start explaining the plugins like if it were \"something extra to add\" and well, it isn't.\nOn this latter point, I would personally explain what is rollup, why we want it, create a basic rollup.js (where you explain the default export) and then you explain the plugins and then you show the entire file.\nOne important step that is completely missing is: Ok, I have the rollup.js now what? How is that connected to my app because you mention a dist/build.js that I don't have. So you need to explain how to run rollup. \nI learnt a lot in here, but I feel like the different sections are loosely connected and there is some gaps in the prose. Also, te example is not really an example, is just theory.\nI would say to get the quickstart, perhaps add some basic heroes' code (to show something, you know) and from there create a story, where we have our app, we explain the JiT vs AoT (that you did nicely) and from there we explain step by step (with snippets, instructions) how can we get our application from the quickstart to use AoT. Installing all the dependencies we don't have already (we assume that we will have TS 2 and @types), explain why we need them, show them how this ngc works, the tree shaking... Once we are there, we install all the rollup dependencies, we create the file with the proper explanations, we explain how to run it and lastly, we use that build to run our app.\nOn the other hand, I guess that we would need more content / cookbooks to explain AoT with lazy loading and other advanced topics.\nPS: Before doing any change, last word is from @wardbell \n. @johnpapa \n\nBefore we tell them to run ngc it may be good to have them set the gen folder so the files do not go side by side.\n\nI totally agree. We can show this after the tsconfig.json configuration.\n\nI think it is important to show JIT and AOT for the same sample. Start with JIT working, then show it working for AOT. index.html, main.ts and tsconfig.json are different for JIT vs AOT.\n\nIf we go the quickstart path, the user should be familiar enough with JiT to having to show it yet again.\n. I made some changes of my own, so please double check it.\nImportant bits are:\n- I removed the compiler from the dependencies to install (it exist already) and instead of doing --save-dev I do --save only.\n- Changed the rollup stuff to --save only too.\nOur package.json is a bit of a mess right now. In a good world, we would have all the dependencies needed to do a build in dependencies and the ones not needed for a build at devDependencies. Since all the rollup & AoT stuff is needed for build, it is better to save it there.\nAt the moment we have typescript in the devDependencies and it should be on dependencies too, but that is a sweep for another day.\n.

This change was for .15 which only needed a file rename, but in the same day .16 came out requiring all the files, I just hadn't time to come back and change it.\nI also added the generic karma-shim. I know you want to remove it, but I am not sure if that is an option anymore, it is needed for the upgrade guide.\n. If the link is not sending you anywhere that is a bug and I will fix it.\n. I fixed this some time ago. Please open a new issue if this remains being problematic.\nThanks.. I like what I see but I will honestly prefer if @wardbell has a say on this too.\n.

We used (or use) to have 20 tasks doing similar jobs, if we can reduce a bunch of them, I will be all in.\n\nWe have 3-4 that harpCompile, another that serves, another that compiles and serves...\n. What if we set a convention on the images path so if the directive finds an image in that concrete path, will use it and if not, will default to \"an empty one\".\n. And that issue contains a link to an issue already reported here https://github.com/angular/angular.io/issues/1875\n. Sounds good to me. Did you delete also the examples folders? (and routes...)\n. Weird, this only shows me that you deleted 03-05 (not 04-12 nor 04-15)\n. That is what you said in the first comment! :P\n. Oh, we have styles without example, forgot :P\n. We should go with #2227 since it changes all the files.\n. Yes.\nBut thanks a bunch.\n. Should be fixed by now.\n. Weird, what plunker you say if fails? We are not even using npmcdn.com url anymore.\n. Let me do some questions and I will come back later to this.\n. The problem is with npmcdn that has that bug, if you change it to unpkg.com (which is the new URL) it works.\n. I like it but there are some changes:\n- Do we need a example-config.json? We had that since day 1, but I don't see why we need it, perhaps we can get rid of it.\n- The karma conf and karma shim are not copied everywhere anymore, so we don't need it inside _boilerplate.\n- a2docs.css gets autogenerated, so we don't need it inside the repo. Just make it to be generated there.\nMy concerns:\nNow we have a few boilerplate inside a _boilerplate folder and a few of them outside it. I don't like that, because now I have two different places to look for boilerplate and even more confusing, I have two package.json (one full, one with tasks only, and needing to maintain both).\nOn the other hand, we also have two tsconfig, one for protractor and one for the demos.\nCan't we have _boilerplate to have everything and perhaps a inner protractor folder with the protractor ones? Or they need to exist in the root _examples folder?\n. It has a tslint in _examples and _boilerplate. I guess we should get rid of the _examples one.\nAlso, a2docs.css at _boilerplate needs to be ignored.\n. So to summarize for @wardbell, we are creating a _boilerplate folder where we have everything we share across al the examples.\nThe important bit in here is that the package.json that we are spreading right now only have the npm scripts (just what we need) and there is a package.json at _examples that is the one with all the dependencies but not script tags.\nWe now have a less cluttered _examples folder.\n. Should be fixed by now.\n. I am going to close this @ericjim. If I remember correctly, @IgorMinar decided to remove the compiler API from the reference, so that one shouldn't show in this case.\n. Everything will be updated shortly \n. The new systemjs.config.js won't lock us into one version. Shouldn't we put that back?\n. Yes sir, will do today.\n. I would change the \"ES6\" to say \"ES6 shim\" (I know that perhaps your way is more correct, but thinking about the user perspective, I think they are more familiar with the \"ES6 shim\" term.\nOn the other hand, the first time is a bit overcomplicated. Instead of listing all versions one by one, can't we say IE9+, Android4.1+, etc?\n. > \"ES6 shim\" is also the name of a well-known library, it could be confusing, especially since we suggest to use core-js at the end (to shim ES6 :D).\n\nAnyway, it should be ES2015. So it could be changed to \"ES2015 shim\".\n\nAgreed.\n\nIt can definitely be changed.\n\nIt is only my opinion, let see what the others say\n. We removed this doc, so I am closing this.\n.

Also OSX.\nI updated to 53 and surprise, that did happen to me once but I reloaded it and now it works correctly.\nI believe this can be on plnkr side and not browser / Angular itself.\nSo what I am going to do, is keep an eye on that and investigate it with Plnkr author.\nThanks a bunch.\n. @chalin \n.

You tried all combinations but the right one.\nFirst of all, angular is not a global package, so you need to drop the -g.\nThen angular is separated in different packages like @angular/core, @angular/common so you would need to do stuff like npm i --save @angular/core @angular/common ....\nThe best thing you could do to follow the guides in this page is to clone the quickstart that has everything in place.\nCheers.\n. You need to use module.id indeed.\nI am going to update the tutorial so it gets clear that you have to use it and how.\n. We made a change recently to eliminate the moduleId need. We added a loader that will translate ./urls into absolute/urls/links.html. Yes, of course. Show me your error and the code so we can debug it together.. Ohh, yes, someone saw that loader problem. Something happened, I need to check that, that shouldn't be broken.\nSorry about that.. I am not experiencing anything on windows. I super lost track of this issue.\nThere is a loader (a plugin) of systemjs in all demos now that renders moduleId useless. So can leave it out and use relative paths ./foo.html. I need to bring the new loader into the quickstart seed. Sorry, buuuuuuuuuuusy week.. Do you have the systemjs-angular-loader.js file in src/ ? It is needed (with a systemjs.config.js change).. You are supposed to start the project using the quickstart repo and since it comes with that, it never says anything about it.\nWe need to update the docs to add a note saying that for quickstart users, you have that plugin in the quickstart and why.\nI wrote a note for myself to make it clearer.. You can go and download the zips for each chapter.. We removed that some time ago.. you need node v5+\n. Thanks. Will fix \n. What OS are you using? In Mac (and chrome) it is quite better:\n\n. We are moving to a new design. When we do that, if you think it is still a problem (we use different fonts). Please open a new issue.. is module.id and not module.Id, lowercase.\n. Can you show me your code?\n. moduleId is not a string.\nWhat error are you getting?\n. Yes, webpack doesn't have that and you don't need it.\nCheck the webpack guide to see how we load templates with it.\nAlso, questions are better for stackoverflow.\n. Duplicate of #2499\n. That is a bug (node or npm or whatever) in Windows.\nWe are changing that in a separate PR to have a different name.\nSo I close this and we continue at #2496 \n. Package was renamed to angular-in-memory-web-api recently.\nIf you started the tutorial before that, just go to the quickstart and get the new version.\n. The will goes against our guidelines, so we cannot accept this PR.\n. Our internal guideline in how to write documentation. We avoid the use of will.\n. We are migrating to a new design and taking care of the mobile part. I am closing this.. As today the subdomains are being used for angular projects (CLI, universal, ...) and it is not used for third party libraries.\nIf that changes, I will let you know.\n. It is not a typo, we renamed the library not long ago.\n. Still happening to you today? Tell me more, what are you doing, etc.. is your package.json modern? Sounds like a couple of months old.. You are missing the angular-in-memory-web-api. It does not because it comes with the quickstart already. We should add a note or something.. ping @alexwolfe \n. We have this in the new design (yet to come) so closing it.. Not happening for us. I highly recommend you to get a fresh copy of the repo because we made some important changes in the structure recently.\nOn the other hand, we highly recommend you to update the angular repo (that is where you are getting your error) or directly ignore the API part and use gulp serve-and-sync-devguide.\nCheers.\n. Thank you. We know about the search box not working like expected (or not at all). We are working on fixing this soon.\n. I agree, we should change the wording of the DI guide.\n. Lovely.\n. Reported at #1535 and I believe there is some new effort on doing that already, so stay tuned :)\n. Let's continue at #2303 where we have an ongoing discussion.\n. Thanks, but API issues goes to the angular/angular repo. Reopen there please.\n. Update webpack package.json and quickstart js now that you are here.\n. Is working for me. Weird.\n. It does not. We changed the place and we forgot to update the link.\nthanks a bunch. I will fix it shortly.\n. Are you sure you are using angular-in-memory-web-api and not angular2-in-memory-web-api ? Check out https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-in-memory-web-api\n. It is probably a problem with your app.\nDid you update your system.js configuration?\n. Perhaps the doc was updated while you were doing it, but you have to change your systemjs config.\n. API issues goes to angular/angular. So open an issue there if you feel that the docs are not ok.\nOn the other hand, this repo is not a place to report angular isues themselves.. Sorry for mega late response.\nHow is this going? You shouldn't ever need a refresh. That is the idea behind SPAs :P. I swear this was reported already, we had an ongoing discussion and ended there. I will investigate.\n. I changed the order in a PR, but I see where your problem lies.\nYou don't have to run tsc by hand. That will generate a bunch of .js files and webpack makes no use of them. With the actual resolve configuration, webpack will try to use those .js and yes, fail.\nIs there any reason you do tsc? \n. at dependencies, with the exception of angular-in-memory-web-api they are all related to angular 2. No exception (perhaps core-js, but you still need that for older browsers).\n. You need yes or yes:\nzone.js\n@angular/common\n@angular/core\n@angular/compiler\n@angular/platform-browser\n@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\nsystem.js / webpack / ...\nes6-shim / core-js\nreflect-metadata\nrxjs\nThe other are optional.\n. We can keep this conversation to all eternity, but that is what we have.\nYou need a module loader (system.js or webpack or ...) and you need es6-shim if you want to target the most common browsers. Es6-shim is contained in core-js, so one or the other.\nYou could say that es6-shim / core-js is optional, but it is not a good idea to leave it out.\nI am going to close this tho.\n. Angular is completely agnostic on which tools to use. Webpack is one option, so is System.js or Rollup.\nAngular-CLI decided to go to Webpack 2, but that doesn't make Webpack 2 the official bundling tool for Angular, it is just one option and the Angular team works hard on making Angular (and AoT, lazy loading, etc) to work with all bundling tools.\n\nAngular-CLI uses webpack 2 officially. But AoT guide documentation uses Rollup for bundling. \n\nThe objective of the docs is to teach something, and you cannot teach proper AoT with the CLI.\nCLI does AoT for you automagically, it has a lot of hidden magic and a cookbook saying \"To do AoT, please use the --aot flag when building\" is not even a tutorial after all.\nSo this mean that we need to teach AoT by hand, that means getting the quickstart and adding everything you need to achieve proper AoT with it. Creating a different main.ts file to load a ngFactory, generate those factories... the idea is to teach people what is this AoT and how to run the tools by hand to achieve the desired result.\nSo why Rollup? We use it for tree shaking and bundling. But again, why? Is just a tool like the others and being honest is the one that does the best tree shaking right now, so it is a good moment to show how it works. Again, this is just to teach AoT, the tool chosen is just one option.\nWe will teach eventually how to configure a Webpack config to do AoT as well, so we cover all the angles.\n\nWhy? It can give confusion to beginners.\n\nIt is more confusing if you go directly with the CLI, use they commands they provide to generate AoT and one day it doesn't work and you don't know how it works. First learn it by hand, then look for the CLI or any other starter that does it for you.\n\nBTW, Tour of Heroes tutorial uses System.js. There is further confusion.\n\nLike AoT, our objective is to teach Angular but for teaching Angular we need to use a tool. System.JS works great, the Quickstart gives no issue and does everything you ask it to do.\nCould we move everything to Webpack? Sure, but then we are in the same spot, why Webpack and not System.js? They are only a necessity, the point is to teach Angular.\n\nI think documentation should say that what is best way...\n\nThe best way is always really subjective. There is no a perfect tool, Webpack is far from being \"the tool\" and let alone the \"best way\". Is just one more way.\nThere are people who likes the CLI, people who doesn't. People that prefer to code a Webpack config by hand, people that doesn't want to see Webpack at all. People that likes the speed of Rollup and of course people that thinks that System.js is more robust and does an awesome job.\n. Thank you.\n. Oh, #2508 has some of this changes, so after that gets merged, I will refactor this.\n. There is a cookbook in the backlog that shows you that. Hope it gets here soon.\n. Thank you sir. Will check and update.\n. I have no idea at all and that is a good question. Will investigate.\n. Thanks. The moduleId is being fixed in a different PR.\n. Sorry for the late response. We have documentation for that now.. Old, Quickstart is completely different now.. Thank you\n. Thank you.\n. That was added in part 1, so when you get into part 2, you will have the FormsModule already loaded.\n. care to explain? :)\n. No problem.\n. Yes, sounds weird. Please open a PR.\n. Thanks.\n. Thank you.\n. Closing as we are moving to the new design with proper mobile version.. Thank you.\n. Worry not, they are going away really soon.\n. All of this needs to be reported to the angular repo, they manage the API.\nThanks.. First import is\nimport { InMemoryWebApiModule } from 'angular-in-memory-web-api';\nAnd the second one is an external file as @savurself11 said.\n. Completely true. We need to think of an alternative that makes more sense.\n. If you believe this is a bug, please open an issue at angular/angular. This repo is only for documentation.\nThank you.\n. Closing since we are migrating to a new design with a complete new search box. I will make sure that doesn't happen there.. I believe the error is in your application somehow.\n. clone this repo, clone also the angular repo. Have them inside the same parent folder:\ndocs |\n-- angular.io\n-- angular\nInside angular.io you can do npm install && gulp build-compile. That will generate a www folder that you can serve with lite-server (or any other server) for offline reading.\n. You need the angular repo too as I specified :)\n. Sorry, we need to do gulp build-compile --lang=\"ts|js\"\n. no no, npm install && gulp build-compile --lang=\"ts|js\"\n. inside angular.io folder\n. Uhm, I think we have a bug on that, you should get no error and a www folder.\n. Thanks! Seems like it is fixed already :)\n. Thanks but the localization project is not active anymore.. First is fix, second is fixed as well and the other two are API that belongs to the angular/angular repo.\nI am asking to see whether or not we should report them. So I can continue from here.\nThank you.\n. Thanks for your issue, but this kind of questions belong to stackoverflow. There you can explain what kind of environment are you using so you could get some concrete solution.\n. They are broken indeed. I will fix.\n. Fixed\n. This will be addressed soon.\n. Fixed.\n. Thanks for taking the time discovering the issue and reporting it back. I'd suggest that you could downgrade it for the time being.\n. You need to run the /scripts/install.sh that will install all dependencies and copy the boilerplate files like that package.json.\nFor a plunker, you don't need a package.json at all.\n. For @wardbell:\nThere is a section that says:\n* The first parameter is the key, which is a variable in your component that counts how many wolves we have.\n* The second parameter indicates that you are using the `plural form`.\n* The third parameter is the matches, in other words, how you define your plurals.\nReason is that verbose is because this page defines the syntax like {key, plural, matches} so I tried to map that syntax there. If you decide to leave that, you could add the link as well as context.\n\nWhen I do the translate, I show everything (that is our way at the end), but the part of the ng-container / comment / i18n-alt doesn't show too much new. We say \"You don't need to know spanish\" so I didn't want to let people imagine how to translate those things to spanish so I show that anyway.\nWe show the entire file a bit ahead, so up to you.\n. ping @johnpapa \n. I am more worried in teaching Webpack as well. There are a lot of libraries being published with a Webpack tooling and the would need guidance as well.\n. Leave the webpack aside I guess. I would like to think about some ideas but I need to run all of them through Ward first.\n. Hello!\nThis issue tracker is for documentation issues. Id recommend you to create a nice reproduction on a plunker and post it directly to angular/angular. You will get more insight there ;)\n. I confirm the issue. @brandonroberts can you take a look please? It probably need fixing in the code, prose and e2e.\n. All API issues needs to be reported at angular/angular. Thank you.\n. We are migrating the site, I will make sure this doesn't happen. Closing.. I will document that eventually. We need some other pieces to go first.. We are going to publish soon a guide about creating libraries. I don't think it covers creating a NPM package itself, but that is kinda generic.. Thanks, fixed it on a different PR.. API issues goes to the angular repo.\nThanks.. Fixed.. This kind of questions are better for stackoverflow.\n. Fixed.. I am with you on that one.. We don't need exclude without files and why do we need typeRoots? I am totally in for the lib, I wanted to add that with an update but forgot.. Sure you can.\nThe node_modules exclusion is only needed if you specify the files by hand, since we do not, node_modules is excluded automagically.. Thank you.. That code you are running is like 6 months old. Good point, will have it in mind for an update we have in the pipeline. @wardbell can we get this ASAP? I would like to work on the chapter for new features, soon.. We will have offline support soon in a new site. But no PDF creation.. I fail to see your problem.. Sorry, I keep failing to see your problem. Let's start over.\nDo you want to know the difference between *ngIf and using a template with [ngIf] ?. No, the use of  is not yet the \"preferred way\". It is a proposal to replace <template> with that, but as far as I know, not yet accepted.. API reference needs to be reported at the angular repo.. One thing is documentation per se (which we manage) and other thing is API documentation (which the core team manages on their repo, because it is embedded in the code). This is entirely a different issue.. This issue was for API not the guides. That is why I closed it, it is not related to this repo.\nAnd there is no need for new issues, we have some already.. You need to realize that this repo is dead and no one is looking at it. Just me, I still receive the emails because I posted here.. Typescript is javascript. Just have extra optional features.. Open an issue if you wish in the angular repo, this is deprecated and goes nowhere.. The issue belongs to the ionic repo and please, use English so everyone can understand and help you.. Questions goes to SO.. If you feel it is a bug, create a plunker reproduction and post it at angular/angular. This repo is only for documentation issues.\nThanks.. This is not the right place to ask, sorry.\nThis issue tracker is only for documentation issues.\nIt is better to ask at stackoverflow.\nThank you.. That is a different issue altogether.. This kind of questions belongs to stackoverflow. Sorry . We are migrating to a new design, so I am closing this.. Is that the chinese page? I never saw that with our normal page.\nIf it is, open an issue in their repo and if not, I am closing this because we are migrating.. Angular issues goes to Angular repo, this one is only for docs.\nThanks.. Closing since we are moving to a new design.. what were you using? Webpack?. it is coming it is coming. Sorry, we are preparing cool stuff for the ng-conf and that consumes our time. We will address this shortly. In fact, we have. The problem is that we are migrating to a new site and all the changes are being made in there. We haven't update our live site in a while, that is true, because we are concentrating to this new site.\nSorry for the inconvenience.. What kind of documentation are you expecting?. There are 3 guides talk mentions content projection as today.\nDI in action, lifecycle hooks and ts to js.\nWe will see if we can put a better place for it.. The search is having a few problems lately, we are fixing it right now. About the API, I will double check with the team.\nAbout the docs themselves, open an issue in the angular repo, this repo is deprecated and no one (but me) is paying attention.\nOpen an issue asking for docs and list what you would like to see on it.. Closing. VS cookbook should work perfectly in the master version which will go live late today.. I am closing this. I will migrate it by hand to the new site.. There are instructions, read carefully.. \nClick on the logo there.. Create a pull request, we are always open to improve the docs.. Included at #3283 since it changes a few things as well.\nThanks tho, it is a good addition.. We need more information. A reproduction or something.. Perhaps that is the only one (and style guide). You can't plunk a webpack application.. I believe this issue was due to the plunker live examples and that got fixed already. Please open a new issue if that is not the case.. Can you please re open this issue at angular/angular? We extract the API docs from there so the changes needs to be done in there. Also, if you can open a PR, that would be lovely :). @crh225 I don't see the problem. Can you be more specific? Those links goes to plunkers that does work for me.\n@AmyBlankenship you need to save the plunkers to do that, they are created on the fly.\nOn the other hand, I see the \"no specs found\" issue.. There is an error. I will fix.. Perhaps you should look at the last commit.\nIt is fixed in master, we go live in a scheduled manner so it is not immediately visible.. We are on it ;). There is nothing on the docs about the subject just yet. We are bringing our Webpack documentation back to the game. So we need to bring AoT, lazy and of course i18n.\nThat is my next task :). Yes sorry. We are currently migrating all examples to use the CLI and also update the prose. The current plan for the i18n chapter is to change the systemjs instructions at the end for CLI instructions.\nThere is no plan for webpack instructions per se.. Let's summon the man who knows @ocombe . Thanks, That is on me, but in my defense, they were pretty hard to find.\nFor the next time, you will like to create a PR from a branch in your fork, because now, your fork will remain out of sync of this repo.. That is a ES6 and Typescript feature. Sorry on the phone right now, but Google that and I'm sure you will find an explanation. \nIf not, I'll give you a better answer at home. . I don't see anything interesting in there :/. What you say is correct out of context, but if we unify all the different context, it makes sense.\nWe show 1 example, step by step in 4 different \"languages\". The ES6 + decorators will eventually show an example of ES6 + decorators. That doesn't mean that the example you are giving in here contains decorators. It will eventually contain decorators but not yet in that step.\nWe can't change the headers to specify \"what you see in the example\" because that will confuse the users that are going step by step.\nAbout the properties, not much idea there. WDYT @filipesilva ?. You are certainly the tooling master Pete. This looks awesome so far.. I will check. We did some drastic changes, then we removed them. I will check what is the status now.. It is the same bot!. I have been wondering the same for years.. That was fixed.. I am not familiar at all with VS2015. Are you creating the Angular like an inner project inside an asp.net mvc project or something?. Nice. I will see if anyone on the team has VS, I don't and even if I do, I don't know enough VS nor asp.net mvc to see if you are doing wrong.\nThat being said, on a simple view, You have everything in root which sounds REALLY weird to me. I see the issue now, I am going to fix it, in the mean time, in webpack.common.js, the loader for ts is like:\n{\n              test: /\\.ts$/,\n              loaders: ['awesome-typescript-loader', 'angular2-template-loader']\n          },. I don't see what you mean.. The live demos of the API are going to be revamped soon. On the other hand, API issues goes to angular/angular so please, open an issue there so they know about this :). It is fixed on the new site. We just need to go live.. As @realappie said. Yeah, it is newEvent.. Not valid, need to do a different pr.. Yeah, not sure what happened there. Closing as already reported and PR standing.. Sure, let's delete your past.\nNow you have a clean record \ud83d\ude02 . We will have a new site soon in Angular v2-4. This project was created looong ago, way before Angular 2.x was stable. We will present something in the near future.\nClosing this because there are others issues about the same topic.\nCheers.. I can be mistaken in the details in here, but the idea is that each component can have their own injection, but that doesn't meant that that injector is always created but only when you actually use it.\nSo a normal component won't create a new one, but if you set providers on it, it will.. We are open for improvements my friend. Please send a PR.. @kapunahelewong can you take a look please?. I like the change, but I think that we should explain when it is a proxy and when it is not. WDYT?. Can you take a look @kapunahelewong ?. Thank you. Guide was moved from one place to another and those links needed a change :). Seems to be fixed as today.\nThanks.. Are you installing Angular types?. There are many cases in there. Can you take a look @kapunahelewong ?. That is not the proper solution for the CLI either.\nWe are cooking a solution for certain guides to provide alternative solutions for the CLI and webpack.\nClosing as duplicated (#3238). Believe me, it is not. That will only lead to more grief and pain.. Because you are mixing different loaders. CLI uses webpack so you need to use a webpack solution. System.JS is another option.\nIt is like riding a motorbike inside a car because one tire was flat.\n@filipesilva do you have any idea in how to do it with the CLI?. > I wouldn't compare it like this. Lets say i drive with a car around the world but to get food i use a motorcycle?\nNo, you are mixing both together, at the same time.\nI bet the CLI can load your translations files without anything extra nor system.js.\nLet's see if Filipe has something to say or I will try later myself.. He is not using Webpack, just the quickstart.\nProblem with your error is that it doesn't show much.. Reopen if this is still an issue.. /cc @kapunahelewong . API issues to the angular repo.. Thanks, there is a PR to fix the guide  already :). We won't use TS 2.1 for the time being.\nThere is a PR with many fixes to the webpack guide already. Will be merged tomorrow.. @kapunahelewong can you please rebase? The update landed but the prose changes were minimum. We changed our quickstart long ago but this issue is recent.\nWhere are we doing that exactly? And I am not saying that is wrong, I am just curious to see the context.. Closing as not getting more information. Sorry, I am a bit lost.. Still not working?. No worries, Travis was flaky yesterday due AWS (I want to guess).\nPR will be reviewed :). I haven't seen that, but yeah, that can happen.. CheatSheet issues goes to the angular/angular repo because the cheatseet is in there.. No, that is clearly empty. I believe that they are here. Master changed for v4 so I guess we pull them from the 2.4.x branch.. Questions goes to stack overflow. Thanks.. @kapunahelewong ? :). Personally, I have no idea, sorry.\nThis kind of questions are better for stackoverflow :). \n\nPlease file Developer Guide, Cookbook, and code sample issues only in this Angular.io github repo.\nAngular API issues, cheatsheet corrections, feature requests, defect reports, and technical questions concerning Angular itself belong in the angular source code github repo. We can't handle those topics here and will ask you to re-post them on the angular repo.. @Equinox in the angular/angular site.\n\nThe API documentation is extracted here from the angular/angular repo and all the links, say the urlmatcher broken link comes from the angular/angular repo as well. So they need to be fixed from there and not from here.\nThat being said, if the problem is API related but is the parser who is making the errors, yes, they need to be reported in here.\n. I am going to investigate because that url should be parsed, so perhaps I am wrong and the problem lies here in the parser.. No problem Mark. Some stuff is hard to pinpoint.\nThe fact is, the documentation is not being generated for UrlMatcher for not being public. I will personally report that.. Can you take a peek @kapunahelewong . Thanks, there is a pr to fix them, I need to rebase it. . No, that is something I am fixing right now.. The other one seems like I merged it already. But tests are failing is now due the other error.. Thanks, but has been reported already and I am fixing it right now.. I have a PR to fix it. Thanks for investigating it tho.\nThe problem is that plunker needs a way, embedded as you mention needs another way, testing another way, local running another and the upgrade guide, another one. I addressed them all in one PR.. Yes, pretty much that, I just realized a different error as well, so the PR does a bit more.. I am super curious to see what does Treehouse provide that you are missing here. Any opportunity to improve is always good.. @mccumb01 I would love you open a new issue with that information at angular/angular so we don't forget about it :). Those demos are super old and they need a replacement that is on its way. Still, please open it on the angular/angular repo since this is a API issue and the code is all in there.. The example is NOT a angular-cli example so that won't work. You need to npm start it.. I need to check that. I fixed that yesterday but I am not sure if we went live after that.. I need to check that. I fixed that yesterday but I am not sure if we went live after that.. I can reproduce it too.\nGrrr. I will check as soon as I have time.\nthanks for reporting it.. I can reproduce it too.\nGrrr. I will check as soon as I have time.\nthanks for reporting it.. Should be fixed by now. If not leave a message.. That doesn't give too much information.\nAlthough, serve-and-sync needs the angular/angular project to be downloaded as well as a sibling folder.\nTry server-and-sync-devguide.. That doesn't give too much information.\nAlthough, serve-and-sync needs the angular/angular project to be downloaded as well as a sibling folder.\nTry server-and-sync-devguide.. Nothing to be sorry about.. Nothing to be sorry about.. No, that is completely my fault. In fact I am going to fix it right now. The quickstart is missing a piece. You don't need the moduleId.. No, that is completely my fault. In fact I am going to fix it right now. The quickstart is missing a piece. You don't need the moduleId.. I will give you the changes as soon as I put them.. I will give you the changes as soon as I put them.. https://github.com/angular/quickstart/commit/eaf53869d0c2f4011138fc4f311abe913006a99f\nThere are the changes. Take a peek.. https://github.com/angular/quickstart/commit/eaf53869d0c2f4011138fc4f311abe913006a99f\nThere are the changes. Take a peek.. That is fixed in master.. I think we fixed all of that. We just need to go live again.. Oh right. My zipper only does Typescript examples but the tag is applied everywhere. Will fix.\nThe article mentions that yes. We are updating everything as we speak.. Thanks but we are migrating to a new site and we are writing this page from the ground up. So merging this here wouldn't make a difference now.. Thanks. I need to investigate.. Can you take a peek @kapunahelewong ?. @petebacondarwin could you review this, please? :). We have it in our list. Closing as repeated.. This belongs to angular/angular since it is an API issue.. Yes, we will fix.. that belongs to angular/angular. It is a fix for our project. Since we have like 20-30 demo projects inside our own project, we need that to make the demo work.. Can we make it easier for the end user @filipesilva ?. Thanks. That is fixed already, it is awaiting us to go live again.. Take a peek @kapunahelewong . We don't have documentation for that, so it is normal it gives undefined.\nWe are about going to a new site so I am closing this. What do you think @kapunahelewong ?. No, the actual code is fine. Are you seeing errors? . We have a new animation package. We will update the docs on that soon.. This breakes the site with the new list style.. Open an issue at angular/angular. API issues belong there.. Please confirm if this is a problem so I can change it.\nGrrr safari.. I am going to leave it open because I need to change that anyway.. Yes, but we are migrating really soon to the angular/angular repo so no there is no value now.. That is not up to me. We have a brand new side nav in the new site. Different design and different structure. I would suggest you to check it, but I better suggest you to wait a bit. We still need to make some changes to that new structure.. Site will go live soon. I don't have a more concrete answer than that.\nI closed the issue because there is nothing useful we can do right now. The new site will arrive very very shortly and the whole side nav is completely different. The current site is actually frozen.. I'd suggest you on the other hand to look into the new site navbar (https://aio-staging.firebaseapp.com) and if you have an opinion for it, create an issue at angular/angular like this one.\nI don't expect that side navbar to change that much, so it could be a good idea.. Uhh, ah, super weird.\nThanks.. This is fixed on master. We will go live today.. I don't see it. It is a string. If it were a non string or somethihng, I would agree perhaps, but as a string, I don't think there is much confusion.. @ocombe any idea?. Thanks. We need more information than that. What were you doing?. I think we fixed that recently but we are super busy this week with the ngconf that we are not going live that often.. Thanks, will take a peek. We have a new systemjs loader to not having to use module.id. We will add better explanations soon.. I am sorry my man. I need to update the docs to v4 and I was fighting with something else.\nI can't do it now, but for the time being, go to this file. Look for:\n/angular(\\\\|\\/)core(\\\\|\\/)(esm(\\\\|\\/)src|src)(\\\\|\\/)linker/,\nand replace it with\n/angular(\\\\|\\/)core(\\\\|\\/)@angular/,. Can you take a peek @kapunahelewong ?. We have an internal document where we document everything that needs to be done. . If this is an API issue, it needs to go to angular/angular. @petebacondarwin ?. We need to go live again and it should be fixed.. We make fixes on master and time to time we put those changes into the page. It should be updated today.. Ohh the irony.. A 4.x tag where? The changelog part confused me. Can you explain with more detail?. Latest was an idea that began with the project but never took place. So latest is just another piece of the url that conveys no meaning. Our doc will be always the latest docs, except the one we have in v2.angular.io which is the v2 edition.\nWe are migrating to a new site and we are getting rid of it.. we will archive the current site probably like we did with v2. yes sir. William, did you read the warning when opening new issues? :). You just didn't read the warning when creating a new pull request :). Thanks, but we don't update the repo anymore. The issue got fixed on the new site already.. Yes, the current live site won't be updated until we swap it to the new one. We expect that to be really soon.. Questions are better for stackoverflow.. That sounds like a question for stafckoverflow my friend.\nAlso, this repo is closed.. Did you read the warning when you tried to create it?. You can start by reading it. Then we can move to the next step :). Yes, following the steps written in there :). We are not accepting more PRs in this repo and well, that is fixed for the new site.\nthanks.. You didn't read the warning when opening the PR didn't you? :). You didn't read the warning when you tried the open a new issue. The answer is there.. Sorry mate, we are not accepting more PRs in this repo.. This repo is \"closed\", deprecated. There is a giant warning when you create an issue, something like \"Please don't open an issue here, do it on the angular repo. We will close all isues here\". No, all the issues that were created before we made the switch are properly documented internally  in a document.. Open it again in the right repo (angular/angular) please.. On the one hand, questions are better for SO as you did, we ask not to open issues for them, sorry.\nOn the other hand, this repo is deprecated, no one pays attention anymore.. Thanks but this repo is deprecated, the file you updated is a very very old one.. The webpack guide is deprecated and will be removed.. Couldn't this be done like:\n<label [attr.foo]=\"question.key\"></label>\nI think that way is more angularish2.\nOn the other hand, you are missing quotes in there, right?\n. an\n. I see this, but I would say An attribute between enclosing....\nBut that is my opinion. Let see what @wardbell has to say.\n. Yeah, is a confusing point. I still think that what you see in the HTML is an attribute and then it becomes a property when it gets processed by the browser. So it is an attribute with square brackets.\nOr perhaps I am wrong. Let's get another opinion in here.\n. I love this \"callbacks\" to previous content as a recap but about this one... I guess that the user will have this HeroService open from his work through the tutorial so she/he can see the function you are talking about. Problem I see is that the link sends you to the entire document instead of showing the concrete piece you are talking about.\nPersonally I would give a better link or simply +makeExample using the toh-4 source and showing it directly.\nThoughts?\n. I personally find very confusing this 3 snippets without the function part. When I read it, it was like... where do I put this code? Seems like a function but I see no function. Ah, there are 3 mores of this (so I had to look into your PR files to see what was happening).\n. I see a save method here that you never mentioned.\n. If this method is private, we are prefixing them with underscore. Same for the other private methods in your code.\n. I think you are missing some words or something in this sentence.

Could you reword this sentence?\n. When you add a note like this, it always refers to the immediately line in the top, in this case We'll use the class form and control properties in the template.\n. Yes, that is confusing. \"First child\" or \"inside it\". Something like that would be good.\n. No, it is definitely weird.\n. Shouldn't this one disappear?\n. I personally don't like this two lines. Perhaps the tone.\n. Personally I don't like either turn nor convert. I would personally say map which is a programming concept too.\n. Nit: space after //\n. This \"we\" is confusing in here because I don't understand if you mean \"Angular\" or this concrete example.\nWe need to differentiate that \"we\" because two lines after, we mention that we are going to disable the old forms and the \"we\" there means the example and not angular.\n. I read better \"we call\" than \"we can call\" but that could be just me.\n. Not precisely from this update. We normally call \"root\" to the AppComponent and not the bootstrap. Wouldn't be better to say \"providers at boostrap makes the ...\"\n. This ended here.\n. ditto\n. this too.\n. What triggered this change (also in TS)? I am not sure I like (input) as the event name. I don't know, I guess it is just me but I liked (change) more. Input is also the element name so as an event again is weird. Also input sounds more like an input (pun intended) than as an output.\nOn the other hand, the number input is really broken in other browsers. I don't think they are fixed yet.\n. What does the () in here?\n. Why?\n. Put this in a new line, to separate angular imports from app imports.\n. Is there a reason of having 6 imports instead of 1?\n. Not an strong opinion on this, but all those things can be initialized with the properties, no need of a constructor here.\n. this : void return types are not really useful.\n. ditto\n. All the spaces between parens parameters are nice, but that is not the convention we use in this project so I would ask you for remove them in all the files.\n. We are not putting messages between avoid and do (correct me if I am wrong). We could put that as a Consider\n. Seems like we do. Let's hold on this and see if we can do better.\n. all, typo.\n. I don't remember why I did it. I will come back to this.\n. You can add them alphabetically in one line. Or if one line gets too long, you can do one import but putting each item on a new line.\n. We are technically going to recommend not using a return type in the style guide, is not there yet.\nBut the void ones are not that useful imo.\n. Problem with this is that I couldn't use this script anymore on my machine to install the repo, right? Couldn't we leave this on the travis file?\n. upgrade missing.\n. Node 4 is a valid node. Well, there is a new change that made v4 unusable but we could fix that.\n. No, no one, but we were always striving to have node 4.x support, but I guess it is fine to not have it on this project.\n.

Tests runs from a clean state and they seem to be run from the exact same page.\nShouldn't it be dropped? Or there is something I cannot see?\n. Sorry, this is not a fix. This PR Fixes zone.js update and updates karma-test-shim to use TestBed\n. This sentence is weird, an extra word or a missing word.\n. bit of a nitpick here, but the \"ideal for writing\" sounds like karma is for writing tests apart from running them.\n. If your application...\n. I would put .spec.ts to avoid confusion.\n. s/our/your?\n. your\n. I wouldn't say our (nor your) here, what about stops at the breakpoint ?\n. I searched the TestBed implementation and I can't see that it includes any default module (which I guess it does since we don't add any by hand to get the default directives).\nLeaving that aside, isn't it BrowserModule instead of CommonModule ? And if not, the explanation saying \"This chapter tests a browser application so the default includes the CommonModule\" is misleading. Also the import would be @angular/common and not platform-browser.\n. the spec.\n. inside TwainComponent or TwainService?\n. This paragraph exist already.

Leave this as Angular and not Angular 2.\n. > We don't want to do this right now because we're still loading Angular 1 via a script tag. \nThis concrete line. Even when it is true that we don't want to do this right now (we would need to teach system.js deeply here), it sounds weird. \"Hey, I am lazy, don't want to do this, so please be happy with this note\".\nI would reword it somehow.\n. Sorry, I know no French :(\n. alternative to use a tag that generates an element. But it can be confusing, agreed.\n. As in \"xliff not outputting ICU\"?\n. Is this a question of why I put that or a suggested change for the sentence?\n. I do in a box a bit below.\n. Thought 3 times about that, but I like to give the user everything and I don't want them wondering how to translate those 3 sentences to spanish, so I give them the result and we are happy with that.\nThat being said, you can see the whole translation at the end. Will give Ward the last word.\n. Sorry, is this the right comment for that sentence? I am not saying \"same but different\" in here.\nI could say \"To translate an ICU, provide....\" but I prefer to say \"plural\" or a \"select\". same thing, yes, but I think people will understand it better if I use those words.\n. Fixed.\n. Leave this to Ward. See response below.\n. Leave this to Ward. See response below.\n. Fixed.\n. I explain how to translate different things and stuff like <div i18n>what gets in here</div> are called text nodes .

What do you think about \"To use the application in the browser\". \n. Missing dot.\n. development\n. We trigger a \"next step\" automagically for the basic guides so this will trigger two next steps. No bueno.\n. I would personally drop the \"minified\" mentions you have in here. It is more common to see unminified source now than minified. Your tool will always minify third party libraries. And even when you have both options, it is better to not add the minified versions. Angular for example strips all error messages from minified versions.\n. Avoid the word will.\n. Tree\n. compatibility\n. No will (or wil :P)\n. Double but.\n. I am not sure if I understand the \"is unaware that Angular 1 will create elements under it.\"\n. Is this needed for upgrade? IIRC the router module had a parameter to include this strategy or not.. I see what you mean with this, but my first impression (even when I know what you mean) is that we need like a mini node_modules folder in our deploy to make it work. Like... let's remove a bunch of files that we don't need and leave what we need.. Popping open ?. > rock solid, scalable foundation.\nOr at least not foundation twice in a row.. Are we still calling this component a root component? Or was bootstrap component? This is a honest doubt :P. But that doesn't talk about the project files that goes into root. We have src, we have app and we have the root folder.. That is what the CLI generates, they need to change it there.. This is also generated by the CLI like that.. Personally I don't like aligning import sentences, is a bit weird sometimes. But that is just me.. Shouldn't this say src/index.html (inside <body>) ?. In the /src folder. You can also specify it more if you want.. This is not wrong, but this sentence and then a table with files, I thought for a minute that the list of files were the ones meant to be outside src/. There needs to be another sentence or something to present the table.. For some reason, the tree doesn't show as we expect to.. Well, not only src, is screwed up completely.. the header needs to be updated. Well, all of them in the file.. Shouldn't be better to say:\napp/main.ts is not at src/main.ts or something like that?. This sentence needs rewording, too many \"to\". why not here the change?. no dash. as a reminder that something is talking about moduleid and needs my revision.. Sure, saw that, forgot to make a note.. why not this weird space?. blank line in here. blank line. blank line. any reason all of this is html? But they seem to render fine. Moving on.... A block in here? I thought I removed them all.. And Ward was right. It was wrong. I need to revert this. ",

I mean, an angular-docs subproject/repo/tracker enables to keep the noise  away from the core-developers.. @wardbell , some of the documentation needs much time to be reworked (essentially, a newcomer must learn it, the document it).

I'm pretty far from being a UX-expert, but I can't think of any benefit of making it difficult to open something in a new tab, espacially for an app with mainly static content, such as the docs.\nAnd even in other kinds of applications (more \"application-y\"), I always get frustrated when \"open in new tab\" doesn't work. It's not that anyone will force a user to open something in a new tab, but if the user decides to do so, we shouldn't stand in their way because:\na. It's a very typical behavior that users are used to and expect.\nb. We can't really prevent them from opening something in a new tab anyway (e.g. copying the URL into a manually opened tab).\n. Indeed count + +!todo.done was a little too much :)\nEven simpler would be:\njs\nthis.todos.filter((todo: Todo) => !todo.done).length\n. I think one-way binding wasn't there at the time the guide was written :smiley:\n. I think it is also helpful for people using plain old JavaScript, where access modifiers aren't available.\n. While it's not important for apps, when developing re-usable \"3rd-party\" modules/widgets/libraries that are meant to be consumed by people which might not use TypeScript (i.e. consume the compiled code), it is much better to preserve some semantics that can't be otherwise communicated in \"plain\" JS.\nLike I said, for an app (that is not meant to be consumed as a dependency by another product), it doesn't make a difference. But it would be very confusing to have a guideline that says: \"Use this naming convention when developing a 3rd-party module, but use another naming convention when developing your app\".\nNot to mention that not all people are using IDEs :stuck_out_tongue: \nAnyway, it's a less than ideal situation because of the fragmentation (different languages, differents IDEs/editors, different tools), but (for the time being) the _ should stay.\nm2c\n.

I could also update the PR to only link to http://blog.thoughtram.io/exploring-angular-2\n. LGTM :)\n. @billccn that's correct. The interesting point here is that, an annotation is really something that depends on how you define it. Because, what is an annotation? Well, an annotation can be anything that annotates something. Like comments in HTML or CSS code. Or decorators in ES7/TS.\nTechnically those things are decorators, but on a meta level they are annotations as well, since you're using them to annotate your code. However, on the other hand, the decorators provided by Angular 2 specificly do create annotations. Where as the annotation is really just the annotations and params property on a component.\nSo to be semantically correct: If you write code in ES7/TS, you use decorators. The things that Angular's decorators create are annotations. Long story short, we us decorators that create annotations.\nOn a meta level decorators are annotations too.\nI think that's also what we should clarify on the website. For more details, I've written an article about exactly that here: http://blog.thoughtram.io/angular/2015/05/03/the-difference-between-annotations-and-decorators.html\n. @ericmartinezr I think this needs to be fixed in the API docs, which are written in the source code itself.\n. @ericmartinezr let me know if you need any help with this.\n. @ericmartinezr you need to edit this file right here at the marked line: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/modules/angular2/src/core/compiler/view_ref.ts#L99\nThis can be done entirely through the GitHub interface :)\n. Not sure if this is covered already (if so, ignore this comment), but viewBindings is viewProviders now since a couple releases.\n.

I left some comments, feel free to comment/ignore/make use of them.\n. Actually, committing comments into the PR feels kind of backwards. We have github comments for this, and I don't think that this is very practical. Let's talk about this.\n. @wardbell maybe you can update the commit message to be sth. like: \"docs(intro): introduce intro chapter\"?\nIf we want to follow the Angular commit message conventions, it has to be type(component): subject.

Also, see this SO post: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3503102/what-are-top-level-json-arrays-and-why-are-they-a-security-risk\n. @wardbell you'll notice that all i've done is adding a heading for the section list. I think I was lucky that the template syntax guide is already strucutred in a way that it works very well. To me it feels like add the \"Table Of Contents\" header makes a huge difference.\nOf course, it'll take a bit more work to apply that to other chapters.\n. Yes, [attr.foo]=\"expr\" is the same as attr.foo=\"{{expr}}\". Interpolations are also just a shorthand syntax for property binding.\n. @jmcooper you've pushed commits from other ppl.\nYou should rebase your changes so that they don't appear here.\n. TBH I find the shared folder inside a feature rather confusing as most of the time, there feature === component. Feels a bit over-engineered to me. However, as it is right now, I'd also put it in the shared folder then.\n. Can we use \"Decorator\" instead? Because that's simply what they are. They have been annotations when traceur was used...\n. Not sure if this is always the case, since we can also bootstrap multiple apps\n. aattribute-binding -> attribute-binding\n. It's not a feature of ES2015 but is a proposed feature for ES2016\n. Or method.\n. Ah nevermind\n. This section nails it down very very well! Good work!\n. Next year ES2016 will be the latest version. Maybe we can rephrase this?\n. Maybe worth noting that ES6 come from a time where ECMAScript 2015 was called ECMAScript 6 ?\nTherefore ES6 might go away\n. Worth noting that interpolation is a shorthand for property binding?\n. Should we add the * before the directive names?\n. Expresion -> Expression\n. I really like those graphics. This one here shows the connection between a component an the outer template where the component is used. It can be a bit confusing, because a component can have its own template/view and it's not entirely clear what template we have in this figure.\nMaybe we should make clear that we have outer/inner template? \"component template\" doesn't work because everything is a component after all...\n. Because I'm good a bike shedding: shouldn't this be HeroesListComponent?\n. Love this paragraph. Good job\n. Not entirely sure if we should use custom element as a term here. Ppl might think that Angular uses the Custom Elements technology to create directives, which is not the case.\nMaybe we can just stick with custom component/directive ? Maybe it's not even a problem at all...\n. I'd propose to change or remove this sentence, since Angular 2 does not replace a tag with a component's template. Due to Shadow DOM (Emulation), a component always needs a host element, which is the one we're specifying with selector. AFAIK, there isn't even a way to replace it.\nThis is also why the replace property in the DDO in A1 is marked as deprecated.\n. Maybe we should remove \"JavaScript\" here and just talk about adding metadata to code? Technically JavaScript doesn't support decorators, not sure if this would confuse ppl. Because on the other hand, we don't mention anything about ES5 code until this point.\nI think it's totally legit to say sth. like \"decorators allow us to add metadata to our code\".\n. Haha, you made a funny here. Very nice!\n. Actually, in the context where this figure is used, it is sort of explained. You can ignore the comment above, sorry for this.\n. attache -> attach\n. Here I also like to point out that attribute directives are applied to existing elements. It's a little word that has a massive impact on how the user understands the difference between the directive types.\n.

One nice thing about the new DI is that it is usable standalone, without being wired into the framework.\n. How about \"We configure injectors with providers\" ?\n. Developers Guide -> Developer Guide ?\n. It is at least an HTMLUnknownElement, which ofc, starters don't have to care about either. I just don't want them to confuse this with actual CustomElements.\n. Isn't this ngOnInit now?\n. Ah no. It was that thing where the interface is called differently than the implementation....\n.

Please find my answers below:\n\n\nHow does ng-view (an AngularJS directive) work in AppComponent (which is an Angular component)? (Is it upgraded automatically?)\n\nAngularJS will handle the <div ng-view></div> which will only be seen as a <div> from Angular POV.\nNothing is upgraded/downgraded here but you have an AngularJS app running \"inside\" an Angular app.\n\n... which is always an AngularJS template?\n\nThe doc is wrong here obviously.\nindex.html (the doc has an error and displays app.component.ts (body)) is not an AngularJS template.\n\nDo you need to downgradeComponent(AppComponent) since it's going in index.html which is an AngularJS template?\n\nSee previous answer. The AppComponent is an Angular component, no need to downgrade.\n\nCan ngDoBootstrap() {} be safely removed from AppModule?\n\nAs we want Angular to bootstrap the AppComponent ngDoBootstrap() {} must be removed.\nSee:\n1. \"It also imports UpgradeModule from @angular/upgrade/static, and adds an override to prevent Angular from bootstrapping itself in the form of the ngDoBootstrap empty class method.\"\n2. \"We can also remove the ngDoBootstrap() override from app.module.ts since we are now bootstrapping from Angular.\"\n1 is on the first example and explains when we want to add an empty ngDoBootstrap to prevent Angular from automatically bootstrapping\n2 is for the router exemple where we want Angular to bootstrap the AppComponent\n\nIn response to: \"But it would be much better to migrate routes one by one as they become upgraded.\" -- Why is this better?\n\nI don't really see why it would be better.\nMay be so that don't have to downgrade and Angular component to AngularJS ?\n\nUrlHandlingStrategy tells Angular what not to render, but what tells AngularJS not to render?\n\nIf the route does not match a route known to the $route service then the view will be empty.\nYou might be interested in checking those resources to get more info on mixing AngularJS and Angular routers:\n- https://vsavkin.com/migrating-angular-1-applications-to-angular-2-in-5-simple-steps-40621800a25b\n- https://github.com/vsavkin/ng1ng2router\n. > Also my teammate said that any upgraded Angular routes must not have any upgraded AngularJS components or service dependencies underneath them\nShould not be a problem, do you have more details ?. remove\n. const\n. trailing comma\n. could you split lines ?\nwould be easier to review\n.

FYI it is in xmb, not xliff\n. xlf / xliff / xtb\n. what about wrapping lines ?\ndon't you have a max line length on this repo.\n. not in gh which is annoying for the review\n. better use one and other which is the standard for en\n. FYI this will be in CompilerConfig soon, I'll try to remember to cc the doc team on the PR\n. Angular only provides 1 approach for now, full reload\n. directiveS\n. pipes also work in AoT\n. I think there is a confusion:\ndynamic/static vs JiT/AoT\nAngular always use the static approach  for both AoT and JiT\nUsage of pipes should be discouraged. They should only be used by the compiler to transform codes.\nIf you use the pipes you basically can not i18n your app because different langs use different plural category\n. same in JiT, could be overriden by the user\n. not a directive\n. don't use \"inject\" here\n. same text with different meaning = different translations\nsame meaning = same translations\n. should not be used directly\n. it will never\n. do not use directly, not extracted\n. git\n. Using git is a bad idea.\nTranslation tools to the rescue here\n. xmb is the source file\nxtb is the translated file\n. xlf, xlif or xtb\n. If we want to say that we probably want to say that support for ICU messages in attributes will come soon.\n. It's actually not directives (notice that later in the review) - may be \"markers\" ?\n. one and other are caterogies, =x is for discrete values, works with any x\n. started working on that. probably 2.1 ?\n. nothing currently exists\n. i18n / i18n- are attributes, <!-- i18n --> is a comment. may be call them \"i18n markers\" ?\n. they are just passive markers that are removed once the translations are merged\n<div i18n>Hello</div> -> <div>Bonjour</div>\nthe name is only an ng convention\n. <div title=\"{count, plural, ...}\"> will be transformed to <div title=\"count|i18nPlural(...)\"> before compilation.\nextraction:\n- {count, plural, ...} will be extracted by ng-xi18n,\nmerge:\n- ngc will merge the translated ICU message,\n- then ICU messages will be converted to pipes,\n- then the template is compiled.\n. nit: function () {...} => () => {...}\n.

To define a m and d for an attribute use the notationb i18n-x=\"m|d\"\n. Also different languages could have different number of plural forms\n. The first parameter is a variable that counts how many wolves we have ?\n. mention that this is ICU syntax ?\n. \"The remaining parameters are the plural cases\" ???\n. one and =1 are NOT the same (one def varies across languages, see your link above).\ncategories (zero, one, ...) and values (=...) are distinct.\nThis should be explained clearly (ie taking two langs as example ?)\n. Note for later: # will be replaced by the count value as speced in ICU (not supported yet)\nExplain that value match first (=...) then categories whatever the order in the src\n. \"is pretty much like a plural but different\" isn't really valuable\n. \" It has the same syntax as plural.\" I would say ICU syntax (Saying it's the same but different as little value IMO)\n. +  text nodes ????\n. removw this no added value here IMO\n. once again same but different is not the same, drop this part\n. \"That tag is like a placeholder\" -> \"That tag a placeholder\"\n. As of today, then remove yet\n. fully\n. what is this, there should be an i18n-title attribute if the title needs to be translated. you just don't output the ng-container tag sir. why ? \ncomments are only markers for content to be translated. zero / two are undefined in english. should be =0 / =2. this one is correct here. this might not be very clear but it means that the tag is not rendered, the content is. \"=0  / zero\" is wrong. Category and discrete values are different things. \"five\" is not a valid category name. this is only true in Belarusian - I don't think the docs express that clearly. this is true in english, not necessarily in other langs.. why do we have 2 ws before --i18nFormat, I guess it's a placeholder for -p path/to/tsconfig ?. I guess that if you add an npm scripts, you want to add options there.. It was in place before ng-container exists.\nIf you remember we decided (I discussed) that ng-container should be the preferred way to do things (over template and other stuff).\n+1 to remove this from the docs if you want to do so,. +1. yep extra markup can mess with your css, .... once again en locale as only one and other. agree. seen this documented later on, thanks.

Closed in favor of #2214 \n. I fixed the cause of the failing test.

I wrote up a section about the route order mattering in another PR, but I can add it to this one instead.\n. @wardbell @Foxandxss I made the edits @johnpapa suggested, so this one should be ready to go once travis goes green.\n. Fix submitted\n. @wardbell @johnpapa this PR is ready for review. All the samples have been updated to use Routing Modules. I didn't change any of the prose in the NgModule chapter but I did update the routing examples.\n. @wardbell @johnpapa I updated the ngmodule guide and ngmodule faq cookbook with sections for routing modules. Its review for complete review\n. An explanation of the route order is already stayed in the router guide.\nThe order of the routes in the configuration matters and this is by design. The router uses a first-match wins strategy when matching routes, so more specific routes should be placed above less specific routes. In our configuration above, the routes with a static path are listed first, followed by an empty path route, that matches as the default route. The wildcard route is listed last as it's the most generic route and should be matched only if no other routes are matched first.\n. This is a limitation of plunker, not of the tutorial. If you run the example locally, the deep link works correctly.\n. This PR is ready for review.\n@wardbell @johnpapa @thelgevold \n. If any clarification could be added, its that CanActivateChild can be used without a component-less route, but the difference between it and CanActivate is already explained.. @wardbell I made the suggested changes to the prose for the usage of switchMap and other concerns.\n. This is a bug in the router that has been fixed. See https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/12592. \n. Closing as its resolved in router version 3.2.x. Agreed. This will be fixed in the next update to the router guide. Its not required that you have entryComponents in your root module if they are already included in an imported module. All your entryComponents that are imported into your root module will be collected and compiled.. This is not true and is already stated in the docs\nGuards and the service providers they require must be provided at the module-level. This allows the Router access to retrieve these services from the Injector during the navigation process. The same rule applies for feature modules loaded asynchronously.. Module-level providers are gathered in the application root injector only if they're imported into the root module. The case is not the same for lazy loaded modules. Component injectors can't be used because all guards and resolvers are run before any components are rendered. This is why resolve and guard providers must be used at the module level so the module-level injector can retreive them.. I see. I'll add an explicit mention to the guide about the same requirement for resolvers .. Are you referring to the link in the routing tutorial? It has a slash in front of detail\nhtml\n<a *ngFor=\"let hero of heroes\"  [routerLink]=\"['/detail', hero.id]\"  class=\"col-1-4\">. Yea that's a typo on my part.\n. Good catch\n. Closing bracket spacing\n. Closing bracket spacing\n. Closing bracket spacing\n. Closing bracket spacing\n. There isn't any spacing in the object here\n. Fixed\n. Yes. I'll update that with a follow-up PR and sweep the rest of the docs\n. I think this was leftover from before modules came along and the process of lazy loading was loading the routes in a separate file from the components. I'll remove this text.\n. I don't think so. The service does a strict equality check so if a letter is passed in, it won't find a match\n. Added an additional note about browser support for the matrix notation by the router\n. Fixed\n. Yes, we could. I have a separate AdminDashboardComponent to have a default route for the admin routing. Otherwise we'd have to use a redirect to one of the other routes.\n. I agree about removing the return type. We are explaining the types of turns it expects. It would make the signatures in the examples shorter also.\n. We are leaning towards providing the export name here as default export isn't supported by AoT compilation yet.\n. The API isn't ready yet! Maybe I should just take this out.\n. Fixed\n. It throws an error of Cannot read property 'location' of nulll error when just providing the callback function when the e2e tests ran. I can use this.goBack.bind(this) instead of you think that would be cleaner.\n. Is there a reason we have to import this way instead of just importing from angular-in-memory-web-api?\n. I think we should expect this since one non-AoT provided library prevents AoT altogether. Maybe that is addressed in a separate cookbook on creating a third party library.\n. I mean in the context of the Angular world. Any third-party library that provides an NgModule/Component would need to be AoT compiled for the host application to be able to use it with AoT.\nThird-party libraries that aren't Angular-specific would not need to be AoT compiled.\n. Ok. It should be noted as a caveat to rollup if this is not the way it has to be done normally unless we figure out a way to use the barrel export.\n. My editor was giving me type errors. I thought something changed with the linting. I'll leave it as-is\n. Reverted\n. Reverted\n. Removed  flatMap sentence.\n. ",

    "pkozlowski-opensource": "Thnx @petebacondarwin - this looks like a good start! From what I can see it would allow us to display a selector and list properties from @Directive / @Component annotation (after adding an appropriate template). But thinking about it some more it looks like we would have hard time providing custom description for properties / events (and I guess we will need some to indicate what a given property does, what type of arguments it accepts etc.).\nSo maybe we should focus on parsing out @Property / @Event decorators (those are added to class members and I guess we could have documentation attached to those members).\nLet me know if you need any more info here!\n. Yeh, core directives are still using the \"old\" syntax so yes, I agree that we need to support both. \n\nWe should be able to match up the docs on members of a directive class with the properties and events in the decorators.\n\nThis would be great. This matching would have to take both properties and setters into account (not sure if it makes impl any harder)\n. @petebacondarwin left 2 cosmetic comments. Once again I'm not familiar enough with dgeni internals to properly review the code. But I would say - let's take it in sooner than later so we can see how directive info is being rendered so we can improve iteratively on it if needed. \n. @petebacondarwin ok, so let's taking a list of @Component properties, I think that selector, properties and events are the essential ones:\n- selector - important for usage, we've got it covered\n- properties - important for usage, we've got it covered\n- events - important for usage, we've got it covered\n- host - impl detail, might be helpful for users\n- bindings - impl detail\n- exportAs - bah, I didn't know that we've got it, not sure here :-)\n- moduleId - tpl impl detail\n- queries - impl detail\n- compileChildren - impl detail\nSo, looking at this list IMO only selector, properties and events are essential for directive users. host might be useful and exportAs is to be checked. \nMy advice: let's start with what we've got and iterate. \n@petebacondarwin could you rebase so I can test it with directives we've got documentation for?\n. @petebacondarwin thnx! I'm just taking it for the test drive. Will report if I find anything.\nIn the meantime I've checked what is the deal with the exportAs property in the @Component / @Directive and it actually matters for template authors. Assuming that I've got a directive like so:\n@Directive({selector: '[foo]', exportAs: 'foo'})\nclass Foo {\n}\nI can use it as a <div foo #bar=\"foo\"> - in other words I can declare a template local variable that points to a specific directive.\nAll in all I would say that yes, we need to parse out this property and have it in the output.\n. Duplicate of https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/5823 - please don't open multiple entries for the same problem...\n. Are you sure that you report is about https://angular.io/ and not https://www.angularjs.org/?

This is done now, thnx @StephenFluin ! https://angular.io/resources/\n@wesleycho I think this can be closed now.\n. I had a look at this PR since was curious how the template outlet thingy is going to be described. I like the example a lot! Good stuff!\n. The \"binding\" word doesn't get good press recently as it is really overloaded (currently we can have property bindings, host bindings, bindings in DI and each of them means a different things despite using the same name).\nI would say let's change it to just Properties\n. Same here - let's drop \"Bindings\" and let's say \"Events\" or \"Emitted events\"\n. Maybe we should reword it as \"a class, its members (properties, methods) and function arguments\"\nSince AFAIK it can apply to any argument, not only on constructors.\n. Maybe it would make sense to name it templateRef or itemTemplateRef? \n. externalTemplate => itemTemplate ?\n. Are we using console.warn in other examples as well? If not I would get rid of it.\n. I would side with @Foxandxss here: idiomatic ES6 and idiomatic TS are not the same and IMO there is no benefit in pretending that they are. IMO better to teach people idiomatic TS in TS examples (we all know that there is a lot of copy&paste going on)\n. ",

I think we no longer need to talk about non-entry points. You no longer import bootstrap.dart simply because you wouldn't be using the bootstrap function. Dart analyzer will flag any code that imports bootstrap.dart and does not use it.\nI think we can rephrase this as (roughly): \"To bootstrap your Angular 2 application in your entry point import bootstrap.dart and call bootstrap. To define a component or a directive, import angular2.dart and use @Comonent or @Directive respectively\".\n. If you happen to both bootstrap the app and define components in the same file, then, naturally, you'd import both.\n. Yeah, we prefer using them in TypeScript, but it's only a matter of style. No pressure to use them in Dart. Especially not on bootstrap.dart, which exports only one function bootstrap.\n. I'd recommend including the minimum necessary. It does not look like you need the form directives for this example app.\n. Either a bug or possibly you forgot an import?\n.

How about changing the name of the processor instead, because I need to do the matched backtic processing before I do the code-example substitution. \n. Merged via another branch\n. Exactly!\nMarkup consists of a jade file follows the same #docregion #enddocregion conventions as elsewhere.  The comment delimiter for jade files is a \u2018//\u2019.  \nSo in your jade file simply add something like:\n// #docregion foo\n\u2026 jade content\n// #enddocregion\nAll of the capabilities of nested and combined regions are supported here just like elsewhere.\nTo consume the shared section use the \u2018includeShared\u2019 mixin.  It takes two arguments:\n+includeShared(filePath, region)\nSo you could use it from a js jade doc  to point to a section in the ts file in the ts folder with something like this.\n+includeShared(\u2018../../ts/xxx.jade\u2019, \u2018foo\u2019)\nBut because I am assuming that you are going to be sharing with similarly named files across directories there is a shortcut for this.  i.e.  a/b/ts/xx/yy/aaa.jade will be used by a/b/js/xx/yy/aaa.js\n+includeShared(\u2018{ts}\u2019, foo)\nThe \u2018{ts}\u2019 is a shorthand to go up and over and down to the same file in the \u2018ts\u2019 subfolder.  Similarly if you wanted to point to a js file from a ts file you would use \u2018{js}\u2019.\nSide note:  Not needed to use the tool, but be aware that \u2018shredding\u2019 jade files does not use the fragments folder but instead shreds in place in the source folder and creates files that begin with \u2018_.\u2019 \n. This is a test file, and we want to insure that the shredder works with 'whatever' someone checks in for example code.\n. ",

It seems to be the wrong one, since two lines below you're asked to run nvm use 4, which isn't part of the commands provided by the npm found in npmjs.org. I'll put up a PR.\n. Sorry, my bad. I meant 'provided by the nvm' instead.\n. I can say the debate is resolved. It was due to me making a typo on a comment. This PR reflects the final comments in the issue.\n. Ah that is what I meant, a sibling directory. I should have been more clear. In the PR, I word it as Clone this repo and [angular](https://github.com/angular/angular) on the same parent directory.\n. Agree :+1: \n. Having the type there (even if it's not a real instance of Hero) helps typescript infer a few things and provide better tooling. \nIIRC as far as typescript tooling is concerned, if you say it's a Hero and the object has all the required fields of a Hero, typescript will do all typechecks as if it was a Hero. And if it doesn't have all the required fields, it'll warn you as well.\nThis is what I get in Atom if I try to say put a fake hero object that doesn't have an id into what I say is a Hero array.\n\nEDIT: just checked and typescript will even complain if you put extra properties in there, that Hero doesn't have.\n. @wardbell I unfortunately pushed a commit with comments while @PascalPrecht was doing his PR comments, so some of his were marked as outdated.\n.

Hi @Hulk-Tron! \nThis question might be better suited for the ionic repo, since it it's very configuration dependent. Have you tried asking there?\n. I'd say it is not a node server issue but rather a dependency issue in index.html. Likely a missing script tag for angular.\nBut were it to be a node issue, dependency issue, angular issue or ionic issue, this repo is dedicated only to the documentations present in www.angular.io. That is why my recommendation is that you try one of the other repos - this one will not do.\n. lgtm\n. If you're interested, I did a setup of protractor in TS without any ambient type conflicts.\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/228/files\n.

Regarding the deep linking scenario, I think the problem is actually one of application state. \nThe issue with an app that misbehaves when deep linked is that it's state was not correctly initialized on boot. If whatever route should not be accessed to anonymous users, the app should kick the user back to an authentication page.\nOn Angular 1, using ui-routers $urlRouterProvider.deferIntercept() helped massively with this scenario.\n. Right you are, completely missed this myself. Thank you!\n. John's plan to introduce Observables sounds great.\nMaybe the next chapter should be about application state, and shows how to change state on Component A via service calls on the unrelated Component B. Then it would make a lot of sense to change the promises to subscribes.\n. @wardbell I think I caught all TS ones.\n. Included in #1226 \n. I reviewed it and it looks good.

Closed in favour of #1556\n. @googlebot these commits were authored by me and @wardbell, who is ok with his commits being on this PR.\n. The plan is to keep both the CLI and the normal quickstart, I believe.\n. That was mostly it, but the setup was important. Without you wouldn't get neither code intelligence nor compilation errors.\n\nI also forgot to add in something initially (done now): all specs need to have 'use strict'; to prevent this node error:\n[01:10:42] [01:10:42] E/launcher - Error: SyntaxError: Block-scoped declarations (let, const, function, class) not yet supported outside strict mode\nBasically, since we are transpiling to ES6, node (not TS) needs the 'use strict'; to allow some ES6 features.\n. Also had to remove argument destructuring from public/docs/_examples/animations/e2e-spec.ts, since node doesn't support it natively.\n. Yes we could definitely update the CLI and quickstart with this.\n. Done\n. Tried ToH-6 and it was fine.\n. I'll wait for the router update to do that as well.\n. Added in the router, but we need to check tests. I expect some of them to fail.\n. Unsurprisingly, public/docs/_examples/router/ts failed - but it was the only one, which is good.\n@Foxandxss do we have an update in the works?\n. Blocked by https://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/1691, but otherwise ready.\n. @naomiblack I see a section regarding adding styles in the quickstart: https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html#!#add-some-style. \nIt seems to have been there since May 13, introduced on https://github.com/angular/angular.io/commit/6ca1ac2c45a26bb7857e94a6dc92b669c1ecc6db.\n. @fadiwissa right you are, I only checked the TS one. \n1699 should fix it. Thanks for finding this!\n. lgtm as well.\n. The e2e fix looks good, this should help loads.\nFor the record, here is further information about the problem:\n- https://github.com/angular/protractor/issues/2419#issuecomment-156527809\n- https://github.com/angular/protractor/issues/2419#issuecomment-213112857\n. @thelgevold I asked @StephenFluin and he tells me that the change is in angular/angular master and should be out in next RC.\n. @StephenFluin can you have a look at the comments that @thelgevold added?\n. Well need a section regarding the bootstrap logic needed at the moment, like the dynamic forms cookbook has.\n. @kara can you have a look?\n. @googlebot me and @thelgevold are working together on this PR and he approves of me editing his commits.\n. @thelgevold I updated code for RC3, added in the JS prose edits, removed unused dart forms-deprecated example code, and renamed docregions.\nPlease review the individual commits and squash them into yours.\n. @naomiblack this PR is now fully complete and ready to be merged.\n. @thelgevold updated the PR with it.\n. Great guide!\n. The examples you've shown make a lot of sense and the dir layout proposed doesn't comply to the CLI per se, but more to the style guide. I'm all for it then.\nThere's still the question of where assets go: images, fonts, global css/sass/less, pdfs, you name it. Those need a place, and for the lack of a better suggestion I would say src/assets.\n. lgtm as well, great job Brandon!\n. Let's talk about it early next week.\n. @schmuli core-js includes reflect-metadata, and more. Angular itself just requires that reflect-metadata is present.. As far as I can tell, the --prefix command doesn't work on windows or something. I tried it a couple of times and really don't get how it works, but according to the npm docs it should.\nBut, on the other hand, neither do shell files work on windows (without git bash). So I'm not sure this PR helps much in that sense.\nIf it is to go in, then the webdriver:update command should also be changed to not use --prefix.\n. @chalin so the prefix thing doesn't work on osx and linux either? That I didn't expect.\nFor the webdriver command, why can't it be done in the same scheme as the others? Does it not work either? (cd public/docs/_examples/_protractor && npm run webdriver:update)  --prefix\n. Got it. Didn't fully understand that before.\n. Let's go for it then :D\n. This seems to be the cause: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/9419\n. It adds a new env variable to the matrix, and when it is present the preview builds are installed before e2e tests are ran.\nThis would run on all PRs, and a new preview build would trigger a re-test of master. See https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/9322#issuecomment-229263886 for more info.\n. This is ready to be reviewed. It currently shows two failing test suites on the preview builds (template-syntax and upgrade-phonecat-3-final), which is accurate.\nThese failed suites will be addressed by https://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/1774.\n@Foxandxss can you review?\n. All for tests factoring and reusability. The other option is to use Page Objects with some kind of extention/inheritance but would still imply a fair bit of copy paste so I don't think it's ideal.\n. It lgtm tbh. \n. Superseded by https://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/3017. @chalin if it should be reopened let me know.. Nice and useful. Lgtm.\n. This PR will require that the latest release be updated on the LATEST_RELEASE travis env global as part of the release process for new angular.io updates.\n. @chalin can you review and tell me if this is what you intended?\nI'm talking with @naomiblack for a way around the LATEST_RELEASE variable, but for now it works.\n. @chalin thanks for the feedback! I think the simpler task for harp seems like a good idea, I'll put that in.\nI don't think having a simple script with conditionals inside is a good idea though. It might default to what install.sh did, but that's not a one size fit all. In fact, that install.sh was only part of the install procedure - the bit that prepared the environment for authors (and only TS/JS ones I suspect).\nThat is why I renamed it to examples-install.sh. The only difference from before is that it doesn't do a base npm install --no-optional, which I agree we should add back for simplicity's sake.\nI see the CI being expanded to also running dart if possible, but even in that case it's still useful to have the standalone scripts that setup your environment for what you need instead of having to setting flags locally to guide an install script.\n. Ah, I remember why I left npm install --no-optional out of examples-install.sh... because linting the project doesn't need the rest of the install procedure, but needs npm install --no-optional.\nI'll update the readme to reflect that.\n. Updated the PR with a dedicated gulp task and updated readme.\n. @naomiblack this PR still missing the latest release tag in angular/angular but it good otherwise. After it's in, we should look at triggering angular/angular.io CI on master when there is a angular/angular build.\ncc @IgorMinar \n. Currently blocked by https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/10082\n. @types/angular@1.5.13 fixes the issue in DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped#10082, so this PR can be updated and should pass CI.\n. @Foxandxss updated plunker generator and a few other places in the files provided in https://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/2227.\nAlso searched for 1.8. and 1.9.0-dev throughout the project, don't seem to have found any more references to pre 2.0 TS.\n. I agree with the edits, it looks better and addresses the problems that Jesus highlighted. Much better.\n. @chalin that change lgtm\n. It also seems to me that it's not being added to system-config. Basically, System does not know that app/contracts/ has an entry point of index.js, which is why you get web-server - 404: /base/dist/app/contracts/shared.js.\n. @francisoud can you open this issue in https://github.com/angular/angular-cli instead then? It does sound like a bug in the CLI.\n. lgtm.\n@chalin you mentioned something about the dart compilation, is it possible to run dart specific tasks via the CI at the moment? I tried to cover the ts/js ones I know of, but I don't know anything about the dart workflow for docs.\n. There's a couple of things that I would like to understand better about this PR:\n- The new WAIT env var strikes me as a red flag, why is it needed? can that value change? Having hardcoded waits is usually a brittle breaking point, or at the very least something that will overall delay CI.\n- What are all these travis_fold commands? Won't this immediately break if I try to run the scripts locally?  That sounds like a problem for using these scripts anywhere but travis.\n- Seems like a lot of environment variables need to be set, which also sounds like it can be problematic for local runs.\n- Dart now seems a .hard requirement for running deploy-install.sh, which means that I wouldn't be able to run it right now whereas before I could. \n. I haven't checked out A2's scripts and was only comparing with the scripts we already had. That's probably why I found everything so strange.\nI like the idea of a travis scripts folder, but would be worried that it would lead either repetition or having some scripts only there. Do you suppose we can have some middle ground on that, where is it possible to run locally run scripts for TS/Dart (separately, as not all authors do both), and still have all the extra tooling in travis only scripts?\n. I agree that we should build all docs on travis btw, just wanted to preserve scripts as a way to setup/reset local environments as well. Maybe it's too hard to have both at the moment.\n. The script that I care about as a TS/JS author is examples-install.sh - because it's currently just for ts/js. Maybe the specific bits should be factored out.\nThe script that I care about as someone who does TS/JS releases is examples-install.sh and deploy-install.sh, again because of the ts/js focus. If the dart part of a site deploy fails my ability to fix it is limited... I can fix jade level stuff but anything that touches the examples I try not to touch.\n. LGTM Patrice, thank your for all the hard work in getting dart doc gen working on travis!\nI'm seeing doc generation taking 7-8mins on Travis, whereas you mentioned 20m. Did you manage to cut it down further?\n. @googlebot me and @wardbell authored these commits together. \n. LGTM, @chalin thanks for making the scripts more compatible with local envs!\n. lgtm\n. LGTM\n. Breaking changes, not previously deprecated\n- Type -> Type<T>\n- ExceptionHandler -> ErrorHandler, \n- SanitizationService -> Sanitizer,\n- DomSanitizationService -> DomSanitizer\n- BaseException has been removed. Use JS new Error(...)\n. LGTM\n. Thanks for the review @cnishina! I added in all your notes.\n. Moving pack to WIP due to conflicts and Protractor4 updates.\n. Points discussed offline, addressed in commits above.\n. We should keep the tslint in _examples because it'll also affect the e2e specs. The a2docs.css at _boilerplate should be ignored, agree.\n. Good catch, updated.\n. Ah I didn't quite get that it was by design. I'll update with your recommendation.\n. @chalin updated per your comment.\n. Heya @vicb, I'm picking up this chapter for now to get it ready for our testing setup and some more edits. I'm not too familiar with the i18n functionality aside from the chapter itself, so that's my starting point.\n. The guide is heavily revised, I know that @wardbell wants to review but I would also appreciate @vicb, @ocombe and @Foxandxss to have a look. We aim to merge soon though.\nWe plan to further enhance it post AC, but for now the main priority is to get something simple and practical that users can follow.\nNotably, I removed the pipe sections as per @vicb comment:\n\nUsage of pipes should be discouraged. They should only be used by the compiler to transform codes.\nIf you use the pipes you basically can not i18n your app because different langs use different plural category\n\nI also removed sections that talked about dynamic language switching. Angular itself doesn't support it and we don't have a server setup example to show. Also, as per @vicb:\n\nAngular always use the static approach for both AoT and JiT\n\nHowever, as @ocombe noted, this is a very common request and we should incorporate it in the guide in some form when revising.\n@vicb I did not make the ICU messages note you mentioned simply because I don't know what it is nor what to say about it.\n. lgtm\n. lgtm\n. @Foxandxss is ok with me commiting these changes in his name.\n. Closed in favor of https://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/2365\n. @thelgevold I've reviewed your files and have a few questions:\n- you mentioned that after talking with Ward, you had opted to tweaking the shared tsconfg instead of adding a new one. In this PR I still see 3 tsconfig total, can you elaborate?\n- can this approach handle lazy loaded modules?\nI'm also thinking of generalizing this approach to run AoT over all of our examples in a separate e2e CI instance.\n. Addressing lazy loading separately is fine by me, just wanted to confirm.\n. @thelgevold there were a few setup changes in https://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/2233, which went in yesterday. \nWhen rebasing pay special attention to public/docs/_examples/_boilerplate/tsconfig.json, which is the new master tsconfig for example. It contains the \"types\": [] property that forces tsc/ngc to ignore any @types present in node_modules. \nSince you create new tsconfigs for your examples you must add this property, otherwise you will get a lot of duplicate identifier errors.\n. @valera-rozuvan it should now be listed in the changelog, and be available at https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/ts-to-js.html\n. Glad to hear you're finding it useful!\n. @chalin looks fine to me for the TS changes. The removal of the docregion terminator in public/docs/_examples/toh-5/ts/app/dashboard.component.ts doesn't seem to do anything though, but it also doesn't break anything.\n. Superseded by #3411. Superseded by #3411. I like it. Was quite surprised at how small the new quickstart and the new setup chapter are combined.\n. That's fine, we don't currently use that example for a guide.\n. Closed via #2877. Thanks for the review @DeborahK, I've incorporated all your feedback now. \nI think I touched everything you once listed as questions your users had. If there's something missing let me know.. @wardbell I edited your comment with my replies so as to not bloat this thread unnecessarily. My replies look like this:\n\nFS: reply here. @robwormald I added a commit addressing your suggestions:\n- added section about importing RxJs operators\n- added WebPageTest example\n- removed 'huge' and 'slow' in favor of a better description\n- added more encouragement to further pursue optimizations\n\n. Heya @guybedford, thanks for giving us a heads up! We're going to look into these changes and what we can do to mitigate them. \nAgain, thanks!. From what I can tell from https://github.com/frankwallis/plugin-typescript/issues/185 and https://github.com/frankwallis/plugin-typescript/issues/185#issuecomment-274902258 specifically, it sounds like the upcoming update to plugin-typescript should make it pretty seamless for the quickstart and the rest of the examples. \nI'll test the releases and update our examples accordingly.. @Rouche see https://github.com/frankwallis/plugin-typescript/issues/185#issuecomment-275404583. I have a setup working at the moment but it's not final.. @Rouche you seem to be using an AngularJS project, which changes things a bit... I only investigated how to update Angular (2) plunkers.\nCan you give me a plunker that worked before System 0.20 ?. Ok I see now... the problem you're having is a bit different. AngularJS is not in UMD format so these solutions do not apply.\nThis works though:\nmeta: {\n  'angular': { format: 'global' },\n}. Nice, thanks for the fix!. LGTM. Closed in favor of https://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/3156. It's completely true that the public class fields are a different proposal. But as far as decorators are concerned, class property decorators still need class fields (via the angular2 babel preset).\nSo while not completely descriptive, I still thinking that just saying that we're trying to have as much decorator support as possible (and using whatever presets get us there) is better than being overly specific about everything that goes into that.\nThere's also a simplistic progression described that highlights when the class fields go away:\n\nWhen translating from TypeScript to ES6-with-decorators, remove class property access modifiers such as public and private. Remove most of the type declarations, such as :string and :boolean but keep the constructor parameter types which are used for dependency injection.\nFrom ES6-with-decorators to plain ES6, remove all decorators and the remaining types. You must declare properties in the class constructor (this.title = '...') rather than in the body of the class.. Heya @MickL, I have good news and bad news.\n\nGood news is that i18n use/extract functionality is present in the CLI. Bad news is that it's fairly new it's not well documented.\nWe have an issue to track documentation for this, but it hasn't been documented yet: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/2711\nThe best I can do right now is to point you to the tests to see how we test it's working. The gist of it is that you can extract the messages using ng xi18n and use files with ng build --aot --i18n-file.\nTranslation usage test: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/tests/e2e/tests/build/aot/aot-i18n.ts\nExtraction tests: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/tree/master/tests/e2e/tests/i18n\n. LGTM.. LGTM, thanks for the fix!. Superseded by https://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/3415. @steveschmitt I'll be merging this PR as is for now. We may have to revisit in the future to adjust the build setup.. Included in https://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/3415. @sirhcybe the starter mentioned in this document can be found at https://github.com/filipesilva/angular-quickstart-lib. The needed commands are present in that repository's package.json.. Yeah I also spent a while re-reading this one.\n. (nitpicking) it's a bit weird to have console commands aligned like this.\n. *something\n. This package.json shows alpha52, but both plunker and public/docs/_examples/package.json have alpha51.\n. Clicking this link will hide the linked section header. This is a problem present throughout angular.io though, because there is no padding/margin to offset the navbar at the top of the main section.\nSo we get this:\n\nWhile we should get this:\n\nI'll open an issue for it. Here #477.\n. Perhaps it's worth it to mention why locally we configure it to read .js files, but in the plunker we go for .ts files? Something about tooling and code completion.\n. 'is the' instead of 'is a'\n. 'compiler' instead of 'compliler'\n. 'devDependencies' instead of 'DevDependencies'\n. Good eye, thanks!\n. This uses #, since it is a template reference variable.\n. Should be template input variable\n. Should be template input variable\n. @ericmartinezr I'm including that change in a commit now.\n. my baaad :D\n. This will make it so only files are watched, not dirs, reducing watchers by 30% (~250 of ~750).\n. This ignores the boilerplate files as well, which account for roughly 1/4 (500ish out of ~2000) of this glob.\n. This ignores the api jade files, as they are not changed. They accounted for 75% (~1500 out of ~2000) of watchers.\n. I think it will also need changes above in the mapping, the same treatment as the router (locking the version and mapping with it).\n. Do we have a resource available about how to use the offline template compiler?\n. > <iframe src> is a resource URL, because an untrusted source can e.g. smuggle in file downloads that unsuspecting users would execute.\nWeird phrase structure, not really sure of what it is trying to say.\n. How can users do this?\n. Fixed\n. Fixed\n. Fixed\n. Fixed\n. Fixed.\n. Sure, didn't know that was an issue but it makes sense.\n. fixed\n. Removed.\n. Changed.\n. Removed.\n. Removed.\n. removed\n. Done. \n. Removed.\n. It most certainly should. Good catch!\n. done\n. done\n. done\n. removed\n. Changed\n.

Fixed\n. Fixed\n. Fixed\n. Fixed\n. Done\n. Do you have an ETA on that?\n. What should be used instead of the i18nSelect and i18nPlural pipes to allow for full translations?\n. What is it instead?\n.

Replaced with \"insert\".\n. Fixed\n. =0 remains the same?\n. From a user perspective, under the context of the Angular docs, these look like directives. We should explain then that these are not directives if they truly aren't.\nWhat is the difference between these and directives? Are they just meaningless attributes that are being used as a marker for ng-xi18n to pick up?\n. Also, does this i18n attribute have any meaning outside of Angular? e.g. is it a convention, or part of a spec.\n. Done\n. Alright, I'll leave it as is for now then we'll update it.\n. Removed all mentions of reloading since it's not really relevant.\n. Removed comparison of server being relevant in the decision process.\n. Replaced directive with attribute since this guide isn't showing <!-- i18n --> yet.\n. Added explanation of the importance of meaning.\n. Removed advice to use git, replaced with specialized translation software. If you have an example of what could be used, I can add it in.\n. Removed mentions of dynamic language change.\nAlso removed the whole pipe sections, if it actively breaks language switching then we shouldn't really be describing it's use in this chapter.\n. Can you elaborate on what that means?\n. Fixed\n. In our case yes, because we there's a couple of es2015 things that node requires 'use strict'; to support.\n. A file we need for example purpose, since our docs examples come from real files. Later in the guide we insert the content of the the .xlf file.\n. Not having to do ./node_modules/.bin/ng-xi18n.\n. and -> can\n. How do you find it lacking?\n. Replaced mentions of 'loading' with 'merging'\n. Replaced with 'separately'\n. Fixed\n. I think it's relevant, since it'll use the ngc options. For instance, it'll use genDir.\n. Fixed\n. I'm sorry, not sure what you mean. Can you say it another way?\n. Added\n. Fixed\n. Replaced\n.

We discussed offline and turns out the folder still exists.\n. Tbh, because it didn't cross my mind at the time. I agree it should be const.\n. Fixed\n. Elaborated some more.\n. Can you revert this line? Not all windows users use a console that can run bash scripts.. There's only one other mention of the scripts in the readme (the one for resetting the environment). \nI guess it's fine, but will keep an eye out to see if new authors or users have having trouble.. Thanks!. Right you are, fixing.. Added note about production installs.. Done. Done. That one was added later and I forgot to do just that, good catch!. Done. Done. Right you are, I left a word in while rewriting that paragraph. Fixed.. Done.. Clarified.. Done.. Perfect place for a semicolon!. Done.. Done. Done. Fixed. I'm not aware of a super easy way to do it right now, but am planning on incorporating a production deploy script in the quickstart that would do all this.. Fixed. Fixed. I don't think so. We had to add in environment specific files in the CLI to have this functionality. I think there's an AoT option in the works that forces it when compiling in AoT, but for non-aot it has to be manual.. Fixed.. Yeap, fixed.. Fixed. Fixed. Reworded. Fixed. Fixed. Fixed. Fixed. Done. Done.. Done.. Done. Done. Done.. That will vary wildly from project to project, and will be fairly long as well here. I will add some examples though.. Done.. Done.. Done. Done. Done. Done, across the doc.. Reworded to\n\nThere is no need to have a server-side language composing the pages because\n  Angular will do it on the client-side.\n\nWDYT?. index.ts is mentioned elsewhere in the prose but not shown here.. Would it be possible to actually only use one tsconfig.json, but invoke it with overrides for the changed props? \nFor instance ngc --module=es2015.. https://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/3071 changed all paths to be relative, these should be as well.. Can you make tsconfig.1.json for this chapter with the config you want to show and use it here?\nOur internal tsconfigs have some properties that shouldn't be shown to users:\n\"typeRoots\": [\n      \"../../node_modules/@types/\"\n    ]\n\"exclude\": [\n    \"node_modules/*\",\n    \"**/*-aot.ts\",\n    \"app-aot\"\n  ]. Although this is the correct path for our tooling, it shouldn't be the path shown to users.. Same as above.. What is this step for? It's not explained in the prose.. I think we need to give people instructions on how to build a sample lib outside of angular.io. Something like a angular/quickstart-lib, side by side with angular/quickstart.\nThis is something I can do later and should not block the release of this chapter.. That's a pretty good way!. Interesting usage of the Page Objects pattern. There really is no reason to have it separately in smaller tests.. Not at all, I think we should have more page objects like this in our e2e tests overall.. It's an expression. At least I think it's an expression.. Fixed. Afaik yeah. It's the description in the setup chapter as well:\n\nDefines the same AppComponent as the one in the QuickStart playground. It is the root component of what will become a tree of nested components as the application evolves.\n\nhttps://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/setup.html. The Tree shaking with rollup section talks a bit more about it, and links to an article that elaborates on the differences.. On the docs meetings a couple of real world scenarios came up. Deploying demos was one, and for some projects there is no time/feature budget to actually produce an optimized deployment since the business does not need it.. There is value is describing how to deploy your dev code with the minimum set of changes. This is a question that comes up a couple of times every week.\nI'll add a note that this isn't recommended per se, but rather a fallback.. This section is meant to show the simplest possible deploy. Adding a build step would go against that. I'll clarify that further.\nThere is also the concern of adding another interim build step that isn't further detailed or documented. It's better to jump directly to the rollup+aot configuration for optimization.. Will fix.. Will reword to avoid that.. Fixed. Done.. Done. Should also do this in the CLI proper, this is auto generated code.. It's the default as is generated by the quickstart currently. It doesn't affect the example though. \nIn the CLI we decided by not auto adding specs to classes because we were generating too many files. But there is a spec available for classes.. Done.. Done. Done. Done. Done, but adjusted for the structure (described files are in root next to src):\n\n\n\nThe `src/` folder is just one of the items inside the project's root folder. \nOther files help you build, test, maintain, document, and deploy the app. \nThese files go in the root folder next to `src/`.\n\n. No, because in the quickstart you are looking at the plunker.. Fixed. Reworded. Fixed. Fixed by changing the paragraph order.. Fixed. Fixed. Can you use https://github.com/angular/angular.io/blob/master/public/docs/_examples/quickstart/ts/src/tsconfig.1.json here instead of the auto-generated one? It's incorrect insofar as it contains some invalid excludes and typeRoots for user projects.. Good catch!. Done. Done.. \n\n\n",

Then we'll keep updating it.\n. a2-in-memory-web-api\nI agree using this is the way to go. However ToH should just say it's here to help us avoid a backend for now. If we had a real back end, we would drop that code. If you want to learn more, check out this future appendix about how to provide a replacement for the backend. I would go any deeper than that. Otherwise, this is very scary at this stage.\npromises vs observables\nThere are a lot of ways we can go here. I like keeping the concept count down. So let's think about where we are as we enter this chapter. We know how to use a basic promise to get mock data, but we dont yet know how to get data with http or an observable. I think it makes a ton of sense to introduce one of these in this chapter, but not both. Which does the user want more? I bet they want http as many have likely rarely heard of Rx just yet. So I think adding http and showing how to use toPromise is the way to go in this chapter.\nAlso add a quick note/callout pointing out that we are using toPromise because natively the http.get call returns something else. That something is an observable. But don;t worry, we'll cover that in the next chapter.\nThen, the next chapter can show how to take http and turn things to an observable.\nFollowing this pattern it feeds what the reader is craving .... they walk into the chapter wanting to know http, they don't realize they may want Rx later quite yet. So they learn http, see a small mention of  Rx, and then they are primed for the next chapter which will swap out promises for Rx.\nerror handling\nI vote that every sample has error handling. This is a crucial and oft missing or improperly coded aspect. We should help folks see real error handling right out of the gate.\nLooking forward to seeing what you do, Tor!\n. I\u2019ll review it this weekend. I\u2019m speaking at 3 sessions, 2 full day workshop,s and filming 4 videos this week \u2026 so I\u2019m a bit beat :)\n. I 100% agree with no underscores. It's already in my revised draft. You will see it in the next week or so. \nThis is a typescript style guide. So we will use what makes the most sense for Ts\n. BTW - keep in mind that this guide is very very very very early and not publicly linked to in the menu. This is on purpose. Once we feel there is gold here, we will add it to the menu. But right now, it's placeholders and thus not ready for public consumption.\nThat all said, I'll repeat I 100% agree in removing the _. And I invite and welcome all constructive and respectful feedback on the guide now and moving forward.\nThanks for the conversation.\n. @Foxandxss that's fine. PRs work :)\n. There will be styles on how to think about providing ... but more importantly, I think a cookbook makes sense for this instead. It's less a style to know where you provide than it is a strategy. \nSo I agree this content is needed in depth, but think that belongs in the cookbooks. @wardbell do you  already have one in the works we can link to???\nFor the style guide see #1165 \n. Yep.\nSomething to keep in mind ... this will be a style guide, not \"how angular works\". They will be in concert, recommending styles that follow good practices. But details must be in the docs. In other words, the audience for the guide are folks who want to know which choice to make when there are multiple. The audience for the devgide and cookbooks are for folks who want more details on how to do things.\nSubtle difference, but it is important. It is what keeps the guide readable and digestible.

Today we know how to make this work with karma as the runner and with jasmine as the framework. These are also what the CLI is working with.\nI also have a Wallaby runner, which is cool BTW. \nI don;t think there is anything wrong with suggesting a set of tools for people to use. In fact, I think most folks just want to know a combination that works so they can grab them and go. With that in mind, I lean towards having the guide indicate we suggest Karma and Jasmine, and here is more info (link to examples) on how to do so. But we love Mocha too ( mocha is my preference ), and we will add more on Mocha later.\n. With the new terminology in the guide, this would be \n\nConsider using Jasmine ...\n.

Let's #close this ... and move to #1152\n. 1 comment, otherwise LGTM\n. Here is some reasoning here on the problem we are addressing. The number of times we import something is very large in an app. We write import { ... } from ... a lot. Those import statements add up and they can get long. There are a few things we do to make them both less numerous (creating arrays of modules) and to make them shorter (barrels). These add up significantly over time to reduce the code we write and make the app much more readable.\nFor example, here is how we would import these 4 services in a shared folder without any barrels. Notice spinner and toast are in their own nested folders under shared, too.\nimport { ExceptionService } from '../app/shared/exception.service';\nimport { MessageService } from '../app/shared/message.service';\nimport { SpinnerService } from '../app/shared/spinner/spinner.service';\nimport { ToastService } from '../app/shared/toast/toast.service';\nThis is fairly common and the larger an app gets, the more imports we have. Can we do better? If we add barrels with the index.ts file in each folder that exports the symbols, we can now do this:\nimport { ExceptionService, MessageService } from '../app/shared/index';\nimport { SpinnerService } from '../app/shared/spinner/index';\nimport { ToastService } from '../app/shared/toast/index';\nThat is shorter ... but what if we now use barrels to re-export form the nested folders' barrels too? Then we can make it a single line like this\nvs\nimport { ExceptionService, MessageService, SpinnerService, ToastService } from '../app/shared/index';\nAnd if we are willing to add a map for the folders in systemjs.config.js we can eliminate the need to say /index like this\nvs\nimport { ExceptionService, MessageService, SpinnerService, ToastService } from '../app/shared';\nAnd if we use the CLI it adds the map for us.  \nThe only Do here is be consistent with whatever technique you want (which will be added to the guide). \nIn short:\n1. The CLI adds the barrel mapping for us. So we do nothing and we get to say ./shared\n2. If we don't use CLI, we map it once in systemjs config, then every import is shorter\n3. If we don't like it, we don't do it and instead do ./shared/hero.service\n. The real issue here is to see if there is a way to easily omit /index. I propose we add something to the style guide to explain tht the CLI does this for us, but if you don;t use the CLI then you need to add this as a default or import from /index.\n@Foxandxss do you agree? if so, can you make the change and we can close this?\n. i am hesitant to change numbers now that people are linking to them. i hear your point, but i say close it and move on :)\n. @wardbell I am OK with this.. Are you?\n. I don't see the changes to the \"services\" that you mention above. Where are they?\n. I'm not sure I see a problem with leaving that part as it is. But if you feel strongly, let's get some other feedback too.\n. There are a few points we discussed. Maybe we should start by deciding if we want to have one issue to discuss them all or split this out. The main points were:\n1. What do we call the folder where we put things that are not code? (e.g. public/ or assets/) These include fonts and images\n2. At what level do we put this? Thus implying should we share these non-code assets across multiple apps in the same repo? Or would that be an npm package? Or do we care to guide folks one way or the other?\nI'll focus first on the first question first. I prefer assets/. The word public has meant this, true. But it also has other meanings to many in the Web. Public sometimes means the place we put our publicly accessible web root. Sometimes it means assets. The things we are discussing putting in here are not code, but instead assets such as fonts, images, svg, ico. Thus I vote for assets/\nFor the second issue I I don't think I understand the driving motivation behind having multiple apps in the same repo. 2 use cases come to mind quickly though:\n1. A web and mobile app, in the same repo, sharing some similar assets\nsrc/\n  assets/\n  web/\n    app/\n  mobile/\n    app/\n1. A ui control suite, sharing assets\nsrc/\n  assets/\n  button/\n    assets/\n  calendar/\n    assets/\n  modal/\n    assets/\nHowever is it better to add a source code level folder for shared assets or to put these in an npm package? Or do we care at all and make that user choice?\nI think I'm fine with multiple in a repo, but I am also fine with splitting these into separate repos for each project. Ive done it both ways and they both have pros and cons. Both ways ultimately work and have no serious flaws, so to me it is \"user choice\"\nRight now with the information I have, I lean towards assets/ as the name of the folder and to just being consistent on your choice for #2.\nComments and feedback welcome :)\n.

LGTM\n. I see the point, but I still think it is valid. It just needs more description substance.\nUsing a class is a valid alternative. It is related to this and if you truly can use a class instead of an interface, then you certainly don;t even need the I.\nWe have reported the consider needs to be green, not blue. I think @Foxandxss is on this.\n. I propose this be a Consider, not an avoid. If someone wants to use I as a prefix, the world won't end. :)\nfor this i feel we close it. @wardbell \n. Cool. Has CLI adjusted too?\n. Thanks for the idea. The angular team would need their designer to approve any changes like this. But I love the idea in general. Really, it would be nice to have a way to see that the style titles (and the codes) are links. They do in fact work as deep links, but it's not very discoverable. For example, we cannot click on them, we have to type it in. I'd like to see them act more like a standard link.\ncc for their thoughts // @naomiblack @wardbell \n. Agreed. Make it consider \n. LGTM\n. Abbreviations don't always translate. Some can have multiple meanings. Sometimes people use multiple abbreviations too.

We shouldn't have empty barrels.\u00a0\nI can't look right now but I think we miscommunicated somewhere.\u00a0\n. I do believe the CLI should create a barrel at the root for exporting app.component.ts and environment.ts. A barrel at that level should be consider in the style guide.\nI do believe all folders that have any content (a folder with content or direct content) should have a barrel (e.g. an index.ts that exports that content). This should be in the style guide as a do. This makes it significantly easier to import things. The one time setup of a barrel (especially via CLI) is so tiny and similar to making fully spelled file names, and that minor cost is well worth the easier and shorter imports.\nEmpty folders with only an index.ts with no exports should not exist. That is a Avoid\nA folder with only a folder in it (and that child folder has content) is not an Empty folder.\n. Thanks for the feedback. The docs team discussed this and we agreed that it would be clearer to do:\nDo = green\nConsider = blue\nAvoid = red\nSee PR link above\n. @brandonroberts I like this but I think it would be great to add something to address the natural questions a reader may have about how this show an animation on a single component and is this good or bad. I see the note about more is coming ... but perhaps we could add something to say that we know it is not desirable to add this to every component, so it would be great to add them at a more generic level to animate components that route to each other. We'll get there in a future update.\nsomething like that?\n. I think it is important to show JIT and AOT for the same sample. Start with JIT working, then show it working for AOT. index.html, main.ts and tsconfig.json are different for JIT vs AOT.\nAlso, we should show module.id in the source files for these samples because JIT needs it, and with AOT we can fake it. \n. Should https://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/2214/files#diff-4da8fde79cf7bf8486e1ccc80130599eR123 also mention that the order is important? If this is mentioned later, perhaps just a link to that.\n. Is putting it in a separate file really paving the way for lazy loading? We can still lazy load if the routes are defined in the same file as the module. no? Or did I misunderstand.\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/2214/files#diff-4da8fde79cf7bf8486e1ccc80130599eR404\n. Many of the examples show an empty providers: [ ] array. I recommend removing the unused property except when it is being used to serve a purpose. Every bit of unused code helps clarify the point to the learner.\n. I like that we are showing the signature for canActivate, but it makes this harder to read and more daunting to the learner. I think we should remove the return type. THoughts?\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/2214/files#diff-4da8fde79cf7bf8486e1ccc80130599eR1548\n. Consider adding a header to all code examples as it makes it easier for the learner to know what the example is referring to (file name or some concept)\n. Not sure what interface you are referring to\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/2214/files#diff-4da8fde79cf7bf8486e1ccc80130599eR1774\n. In some places we spread, some we dont. It works either way as the tools are smart. But maybe we should call this out?\nconst appRoutes: Routes = [\n  ...loginRoutes,\n  ...adminRoutes\n];\n. Great chapter!\n. I removed the folders for the examples (where there were ones). I also renamed the examples folders without the + and the code that points to them. \nOf course, please check :)\n. hmmm. I don't see a 04-12 or 04-15 in the examples\n. @wardbell this is ready for you\n. should it be rollup.config.js. or rollup-config.js ? which works in @wardbell 's case?\n. should it be rollup.config.js. or rollup-config.js ? which works in @wardbell 's case?\n. We should make sure the cookbook prose and code samples are updated too.\n. Perhaps it would be worth mentioning why the malicious code cant simply read the cookie and do the same thing.\n. I can't edit the comment so I will respond here ...\n\nWard: In several places you say \"optimize for loading speed and payload size\". Is payload size a goal on its own? You suggest it makes a difference in transfer time and startup time. In what environments is that true? I haven't seen numbers that support this claim for desktop or mobile apps over 4G networks. I'm a skeptic.\n\nI've seen many examples of this making a huge difference even on 4G. A large portion of our users use desktop/laptop on WiFi and the difference in 2 seconds to usability vs 3 has quantifiable effects on abandonment and revenue (per some companies I have seen stats from). We don't need to state this. 2 seconds is the bar that most folks I have spoken to have to deal with for public sites.\nEven with internal apps, there is a focus (though more relaxed) on the speed. I'm sure many companies dont care ... but just as many do.\n. I agree its not a cookbook .. but the content is very valuable. I think we are have a very confusing organization of docs anyway ... we should focus on good content and simply create a master list of the topics. \nMy short term point is that we should publish this sooner rather than later wherever it goes. I highly doubt anyone knows the diff between cookbook and advanced and regular docs :). I agree that Avoid providing ... would be clearer.. Why remove the tsconfig.json ?\nWe still need to transpile the TypeScript and these are the settings we are using for this and ToH.\ncc / @alexeagle \n. Right, for the reasons you point out I think its worth in getting started, just to give it to them. GS is about getting moving fat and getting early positive reinforcement. I think its better for now to give it to them.\nOtherwise its as you described:\n- go to the folder\n- init\n- change settings\n- go back a folder\nthat is friction i would rather avoid in GS.\n. you can remove that if its a problem. i think its a good thing, and prevents larger issues later. But we can discuss that more later. For now, I suggest you add the file back and remove the implict any\n. dont we also need to say the module system? when indicating systemjs it has failed often for me. when using commonjs it works.\n. this should be 42\n. should this be -g ? i thought there were no globals yet at this point\n. why do this? if you already have the tsconfig.json there is no need\n. yes. that always confused me too\n. remove \"already\". Otherwise love the intro.\n. we're not using a database, and I don't think that is important yet. We are getting our heroes from a web server api. This will allow us to get the data asynchronously and we can easily see how we can expand this to hit any database we want. I think it's worth rewording to something like that.\n. Suggest In this chapter we will connect our Angular 2 services to make http calls to our new api.\n. I recommend combining this into one then. \nreturn this._http.get(this._heroesUrl).toPromise()\n                      .then((res:Response) => res.json().data)\n. I wouldnt use a second then, it is not needed and may imply to the reader that we do need it. Let's make one then call.\n. The error handler doesn't return the rejected promise. It actually swallows it. We likely want to log it and then return the rejected promise in the code sample (and say that in the text).\n. \"We want to point out ...\" should probably just be \"We realize ...\" or just cut it. \"We\" is you and the reader and they are not pointing it out. \"We realize ...\"  might be better and convey that togetherness\n. I don't think we need to lead off with \"In this section we will ...\". We are in the section and we can just tell them what we are doing. This will provide a more active conversation instead of a passive sentence.\n\nWe'll complete our service by creating post, put, and delete http calls in our HeroService to meet our new requirements.\n. Check out the in-memory-web-api Ward created. This will allow us to make async calls and update an in memory database ... which will be super easy to use. // cc @wardbell \n. I recommend breaking the execution up to more lines, with each dot leading off a new line.\n\n```\nprivate _post(hero:Hero){\n  let heroData = JSON.stringify(hero);\n  let headers = new Headers();\n  headers.append('Content-Type', 'application/json');\nreturn this._http\n    .post(this._heroesUrl, heroData, {headers:headers})\n    .toPromise()\n    .catch(this._handleError);\n}\n```\n. Replace \"first\" with \"now\"\npossibly revise to not start with \"before\"\n\nWe'll call JSON.stringify before we post to convert the hero object to a string.\n. Perhaps make more lines of this and move each dot to a new line (see post above)\n. > We add a catch to handle our errors for all three cases .\n. Replace \"I am\" with ... \nWe combine the call to the private ...\n. We can eliminate code here in the else ...\n\nsave(hero:Hero){\n  if(hero.id){\n    return this._put(hero);\n  }\n  return this._post(hero);\n}\n. same code changes from above comments should apply here too\n. might want to rename r to response or res. I am not sure r is descriptive enough for some readers.\n. typo ... \"end\" should be \"and\"\n. suggested revision ...\n\nEarlier we used the save() to return a promise\n. add the word \"module\". \nof the Angular core module\n. Ah, i see you are using the in memory web api ... cool. I think perhaps it may be better not to call it a pure database above though ... and instead do the call out to it earlier. Reading it, i was confused on where the DB came from.\n. I may even call it \"In Memory Web API\" or \"In Memory DB\" as opposed to a simulator.\n. revise to\nLooking at the AppComponent we notice that ...\n\nwe want to replace \"you\" and \"I\" with \"We\"\n. hero-data.service.ts using our style conventions, since it is a service. Perhaps this is a better name since we are just providing in memory data ... in-memory.service.ts\n. The story is good! Need a little more meat to wrap it up. We should be excited that we added http! \nAlso, it may be nice to show the code all in a tabbed view at the end. I would love to do that in hindsight for all chapters.\n.

Make it **Why?** We spend less time hunting for code, and become more efficient. If this means we want longer file names, then so be it.\n. I prefer the original wording, just with the name of the file in it.\n.

Should all references to routing be changed to featuremodulenameRouterModule ? I think we can skip this for now and schedule this for a future PR. Thoughts?\n. Should we word this such that it explains that we are checking if we should indeed load the lazy loaded assets?

I don't have any good ideas on how to clarify it though :(\nJust pointing it out as this was the first part of the chapter I had to re-read.\nLoving this chapter!\n. In this example, I get the point ... but could we not have also put the AdminDashboardComponent as a parent of these children and achieved the same effect?\n. suggest removing the explicit return type of the CanActivateChild\n. Should we point out that we can default export too?\n. I recommend clarifying that the @HostBinding decorator statements go inside the Component class. SImple way to do it would be to show the class in a code snippet below this.\n. Leaving us all hanging!\n. We could do that. But this entire section leaves the reader with some natural questions about how to do multi route animations/transitions without copying and pasting this code to every component. And when to use this technique vs using CSS animations for this. \n. sounds like 3 reasons.  downloads a pre-compiled version, inlines html thus reducing requests for HTML, and small angular framework download \n. maybe replace \"no longer\" with \"don't\"\n. Before we tell them to run ngc it may be good to have them set the gen folder so the files do not go side by side.\n. should --> must\n. rollup.js --> rollup.js\n. put file names and paths inside ticks\n. This is something I know @wardbell has commented on in the past. The phrasing of the RxJS dependency may be something he wants to articulate.\n. what does this jade syntax do? If its code, we dont use underscore prefixes by convention. If its styling, ignore this :)\n. @wardbell mentioned to me a few days ago that we are switching from the \"we\" to the \"you\" in our prose. If so, this needs to switch. But check with Ward.\n. perfect. thanks\n. do we need this in the examples? its cool but are we using it here?\n. It is extra, and if you truly want minimal, then I think removing the export is smart. Otherwise, the the educated eye it will make them look for where it is used. This is not a tool to build on, right? If it was, we would make multiple files in the first place. I think, rather, that we want a simple starting point to explain A2 at the most simplest level. In that case, I think removing export works. Thoughts?\n. why not platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule); ?\nless code, simpler.\n. .\n. the term \"bare-bones\" can cause confusion, I have found in different cultures. I suggest something more universal like \"clean\" or \"simple\".\nI had not heard of \"seed\" used here before. Is this a new term we are using for the quickstart app? \n. Perhaps it may be helpful to have a short section here that identifies who the audience is. This is an awkward sentence.  Perhaps just remove it. Suggest ... \n\n.NET Core is a cross platform solution.\n\nSaying the cookbook uses Windows makes me wonder what will be different on OSX on a Mac. I think it would be good to discuss both in the cookbook, otherwise we cut out a growing audience.\n. Simplify ...\n\nbegin by downloading and installing the following requirements:. Should be Visual Studio .... should be TypeScript .... is this link likely to change? is there a safer one?. compound sentence. Try breaking it up.\nNow build and run the application. The .NET Core MVC application works but the Angular app appears not to work! Let's find out why. Open the developer tools in the browser .... > We have app and node_modules folders, but why can't the browser find them?. Suggest removing the word brand and just saying After creating your new Angular app.. I may not want it to be online for the world to see. I may be building a corporate internal app. Recommend just saying deploy it.. remove right now. Suggest It is working locally, so it will work when published to a web server, too. Remove And. Instead of negative prose, I suggest ... You've deployed your app, but we can do better for production to optimize the app! Let's learn how.. Maybe add a link to the package.json to show the dev packages list. Suggest adding ... Plus, there's more .... Great list! We all know what these do, but I think we should add a sentence here that explains succinctly the net effect of these tasks. Perhaps add ... which will reduce the load time and improve the user experience.. Suggest adding Let's take a moment to better understand what each of these mean, and the value that each of these bring.. I suggest removing the word Rollup from here. Why? Because we may use something else later and it would be easier to edit just that doc later and not this one too.. it's when possessive it its. a --> an. Perhaps we should just use ES import instead of ES6 import. That safeguards us for future versions ... it is also what I do for all of my material :). I know what this means, but will the reader know what a preprocessor is? either explain or remove.. ok\n. LGTM. \n",

IMHO the current sample changes to make this work doesn't seem to effect anything we are telling the audience about Template Syntax or its use cases. But he code sample itself is different enough that I would suspect it may raise some questions. @wardbell Ill look today at the stuff you just recently committed for this sample :)\n. ugh, I messed up squashing two commits. So its a bit funky. If everything looks good I'll rebase to master and squash everything into one commit.\n. OK I updated it to beta.0 and made some minor changes to match the TS example. @kevmoo and @kwalrath, is it ready to remove [WIP] ?\n. @kevmoo @kwalrath Made the updates suggested. And changed to mach TS. please review.\nTom\n. Updated. Waiting on to hear if we should use https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/logging vs the custom logger service as the TS example does.\n. Ah. Thanks @wardbell @kwalrath. I think see where my disconnect was. So if I change it to\n Renderer _renderer; and ElementRef _el; then those will both be private, correct? \nThen the constructor can be Highlight(ElementRef this._el, Renderer this._renderer); \n. Thanks @kevmoo. I made those changes. @kwalrath updating to beta.1 broke this example. ElementRef says it no longer has a getter for 'style'. Also referenced here  it suggest to use ElementRef with caution. It looks like they are still using it in TS though. Thoughts?\n. Using <input /> vs <input> didn't make a difference either way. I still had to include COMMON_DIRECTIVES in order for ngModel to work. I would point out though ( as petty as it might be ) that inputs are self closing tags so to they should have  /> to be clean html.\n. I updated it to match the plunkr version ( which didn't have any of the doc regions) I can add those in today sometime\n. Good to know. I'll update it and remember that for the future. \n. @kevmoo Ok cool. I noticed that when a List is empty that List[0] will throw an error ( rather than just return null like JavaScript would ). Does List.first behave the same when empty ?\n. Oh yeah - that snuck in there I meant to remove it.\n. Ok good to know. I've seen both ways through out other examples so i wasn't sure if we wanted to unify on one way over the other for all examples, or if we wanted to show different ways in different parts.\n. I'm using @View in the other samples (pipes and forms) that has already been merged. Should I update those and do a new PR ?\n. That is a great question! It's in the plunkr example at the bottom, but scanning through the the actual docs I don't see a reference to it anywhere. \n@kevmoo  ,@kwalrath do we want to scrub it?\n. Even though this list is not a constant, on the line right below (line 45) I reference the first item and set it as the value of the currentHero property.\n Hero currentHero = _MockHeroes.first;. \nI get an error when I put the collection inline. \nI remember chatting about a similar problem in the forms example. \n@kevmoo How should I handle this?\n. like this Type hero = Hero; ?\n. It's of type InputElement which I believe comes form dart:html. I added the import and the type declaration.\n. There are  few other questions above that I was waiting on. I'll update it tonight.\n. @kwalrath .Yep, at the very bottom of index.html in the TS example app there is a blurb about using enums in bindings. That's the part that references this enum and the colorToggle() method. What I meant to say was I don't see any reference to it in the actual tutorial. So I'm not sure if it was just scrubbed, or if it will be referenced at a later time.\nOn this note, I had a heck of a time trying to figure out how to use enums in Dart in the way that the TS example is using it. I'm not sure that what I ended up with is even right. Let me know if there is a better way to tell the same story here. Thanks.\n. Ah, of course! That worked great, and makes sense. :) \n. Ok cool, I'll remove it. When do you need to use this? It's a bit confusing to me.\n. Im not sure. I just noticed it with named regions. If it's implicit already I wont worry about it either.\n. That's good news. It seemed really odd to have to in the first place. I thought maybe it was for better performance somehow.\n. That's a good point. But I agree with you. For the use case of teaching dev's angular2/Dart, I think this approach does feel easier to follow when looking at the examples directly.\n. So v1 should be version1  etc... ?\n. removing reference to ctor in main.dart but leaving the lib file just in case we want it later. Let me know if I should so otherwise.\n. Yes it does. Anything between the double quotes is evaluated by the angular engine. If it's not in single quotes then it would look for a String object named violet\n. I agree - I'll update it.\n. In the TS version the directive they are calling is itself. That didn't seem right me either.\n. I did this before I got word back from you on the named #docregion's. I'll go through all the current PR's I have out and update them. :)\n. Yeah that was just to be consistent between the methods. I thought using print for the first one then window.console.* would seem a bit confusing. To be honest though Im not sure what the point of the logger service is even for. I don't see a reference to it anywhere. I wonder if it's in the works for one of the upcoming examples\n. It does run, but I agree with you. The TS example had the extra let heroes. Sets it then returns it. I didn't see a reason for it but converted it over 'as is' just in case I was missing something. I'll update it.\n. Oh ignore that last comment. The TS version is using the logger service here to log the length of the heroes returned form backend service. I must have left that part out on accident.\n. ",

Is \"wildcard\" what we should call it?\n. @matsko Should we also be able to do a similar thing for entering? I tried it but couldn't figure out how to make it so that it has a usable computed height in void => *\n. @matsko I also tried an alternative where the styles are not explicitly referred to from the transition, but was not able to make it work:\nanimation('heroState', [\n   state('inactive', style({backgroundColor: '#eee', transform: 'scale(1)'})),\n   state('active',   style({backgroundColor: 'lightblue', transform: 'scale(1.1)'})),\n   transition('inactive => active', animate('100ms ease-in\u2019)),\n   transition('active => inactive', animate('100ms ease-out\u2019))\n])\nShould this kind of thing be supported? This is our first \"quick start\" example, so I'm trying to make it have as few moving parts as possible.\n.

It's significance in that respect depends a great deal on the target environment, yes?\n\nAs of today, script parsing time (which is a function of how much JS you ship to browser) is the #1 (by far) cost of getting angular apps booted, especially on mobile devices. This is worse with mega-vendor bundles.\n\nIn my (limited) experience, the far bigger factor, both in desktop and over mobile, is the number of trips to the server.\nIn my (limited) experience, the number of files matters a lot whereas (total net) payload size makes comparatively little difference in app launch and startup time ... at least for enterprise apps. Is that your experience?\n\nThis is more server dependent (does your server support HTTP2 (push?) - if it does, somewhat counterintuitively, its much faster to load a bunch of smaller scripts over the single connection than one large script (!). This whole pattern is changing and I want to be cautious about getting overly prescriptive about these sorts of things while stuff is in flux.\n:shipit: \n. this is sort of ambiguous and broad (and scary) - what about something like \"angular2 uses some ES6 language features...\"\n. maybe link to SystemJS config docs https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs/blob/master/docs/config-api.md\n. This is probably not something we want to recommend, ever?. See above. Concerned people will stop here.. Lets avoid pejorative words like \"huge\" and \"slow: :). I think here, we want to use SystemJS builder instead. UMD bundles are a less optimal option and straight out won't work with AoT. ditto. UMD !== deployment.. I have a hard time with this.

I also think the docs should make this more clear. This is one of the most FAQ.\n@sullivanpt some explanation in advance\nSingleton in Angular DI is singleton per injector. Each component gets its own injector while each injector (except the root one) is a child-injector of the parent-components injector.\nThe injector hierarchy therefore mirrors the component hierarchy.\nIf a dependency is requested from DI, DI searches the DI hierarchy upwards until it finds a provider for the requested dependency. If the injector already issued an instance for this provider previously, the same instance is returned again, otherwise it is created, stored, and returned.\nRegistering a provider therefore defines the scope for the \"singleton\".\nWhen a provider is registered only in the root component or bootstrap the scope is the whole application, otherwise the scope is the component where the provider is registered and all its descendants.\nIf a provider is registered at different levels, the one deeper in the hierarchy overrides the one registered nearer to the root for the component and its descendants because search is from the request upwards until the first is found.\nIf a provider is registered more than once the issued instance is no application-wide singleton anymore.\nHope this helps. There are of course more details, but I leave that for the Angular team members with more in-depth knowledge.\n. I haven't seen a mention of HashLocationStrategy or a server that allows to develop with PathLocationStrategy. AFAIK with just pub serve the examples will fail with 404 on reload.\n. What about explicitly mention how to work around? Like a getter or function in the component that forwards to a global member?.\ndart\n@Component(\n  selector: 'my-component',\n  template: '<button (click)=\"log('been clicked')\">click me</button>')\nclass MyComponent {\n  log(String value) => print(value);\n}\nNot sure if this is obvious for everyone.\n. :D You don't want to be an overachiver? \nI just saw a few questions on SO and Gitter where people were wondering what's a valid way to do it. My example above seems to come to mind easily for them as well, but they keep wondering if this is the way to go or if they missed something. With an explicit pointer these doubts would vanish.\n. What about some words about whether to prefer decorators or component/directive parameters (inputs: [], outputs: [], host: {})?\n. Great!\nFrom what I have seen >>> is also supported (same as /deep/). Should it be mentioned?\nThere is also '::shadowwhich is also not mentioned (to just pierce one \"shadow\" boundary in contrary to all with/deep/`).\n. > Judging by angular/angular#6511 and angular/angular#7562 and the source code, I don't think the ::shadow selector actually works in emulated view encapsulation.\nSeems you're right https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/cb38d72ff4231c098c69fb3fa6dd3cbc634f0cbe/modules/angular2/src/compiler/shadow_css.ts#L317\n\nThat's a good question. I decided at this point not to mention it since it does the exact same thing as /deep/, but isn't supported by Chrome so it won't work with ViewEncapsulation.Native.\n\n/deep/ is also deprecated in Chrome and planned to be removed since quite some time (and generates a warning in the console - or was this removed again, I haven't seen the warning since a while). These selectors (/deep/, >>>, ::shadow) are currently mostly Angular2-only and I would mention that they shouldn't be used with ViewEncapsulation.Native.\n. See also angular/angular#8020\n. I guess this is also for Dart \"compatibility\" where the _ actually makes members private. \n. > In my opinion you should use Dart-conventions when writing your apps in Dart and you should use TypeScript-conventions when writing apps in TypeScript (So when writing apps in Plain old JS you should also use the underscore-prefix). You would never ask a Dart-Developer to name their files with dashes (e.g. customer-management.service.dart) as Dart uses underscores for filenames.\nThis would make ts2dart more complicated because names would need to be changed. In your application, if you don't intend to make your packages available to Dart or JS, then you are free to not use _ anyway. \nIf this style guide should also apply for contributions to Angular, then I think requiring _ for private fields is valid.\n. @ShinDarth what exactly are the inconsistencies?\nPlease consider creating a new issue, this one is closed.. I think focus is a great example for this because there is not such an easy replacement in Angular.\nSee also http://stackoverflow.com/a/34573219/217408\n. Nice one. \nI saw it mentioned several times that OnPush should be favored over the default anyway. If this is the case this should be promoted more in the doc examples as well. \nWould it make sense to detach when OnPush is set?\n. > We can inject a property with @Attribute to a controller's constructor and get its value a single time.\nI think this should be inject an attribute instead of inject a property. This can only be used to read statically added attributes AFAIK. \n. This is a topic that causes lots of confusion. I found it easier for people to distinguish between global providers (registered in bootstrap()) and providers registered on components. \nThe suggestion in the current docs leads for example devs to register them on all components which breaks for example routing when ROUTER_PROVIDERS are added to other components than the root component (which seems to be especially confusing because ROUTER_DIRECTIVES are required on every component where they are used) and of course breaks everything that should be shared among several components.\nI don't argue to change this rule, only to make it extra clear what the differences are between\n- providers registered in bootstrap()\n- providers registered only on the root component \n- providers registered on shared parents which may or may not be the root component\nEnsure there are good examples.\n. I see. That's fine of course. Just please be cautious to not cause any more confusion. Lots of questions on StackOverflow are because this is misunderstood and I got the suspicion this is because of the hint in the docs to not add providers to bootstrap() but instead to the root component.\n. provide(PLATFORM_DIRECTIVES, {useValue: [CloseContentPanelDirective], multi: true}) seems not to work on the root component but works in bootstrap() (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37560817/using-directives-in-child-components-of-an-angular-2-application/37560885#37560885)\nSuch exceptions would need to be explained.\n. This would then probably apply to all lifecycle callbacks for all directives, components, and pipes\nOnInit, OnChanges, AfterViewInit, ...\n. If you use @Inject(SomeType) does it need the @Injectable() decorator as well if it has constructor parameters?\n. @IgorMinar how is that supposed to be and advantage when added to the root component? This only helps for testing the root component, doesn't it?\nI guess for this case it would make more sense to suggest creating a GLOBAL_PROVIDERS (or whatever name) variable and refer it instead as provider (bootstrap, or root component) (like https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/d272f96e23f379e1b565435b3af010138e710ab9/modules/angular2/src/common/common_directives.ts#L49)\n. @IgorMinar how is that supposed to be and advantage when added to the root component?

Can't you invoke change detection manually? (I don't know NG2/TS testing well).\n. I think this is intentional. \nAccording to the style guide (read months ago) @Injectable() should be added also when the constructor doesn't have parameters, because it often causes issues when later parameters are added but not also the @Injectable() decorator.\nIt's an easier and less error prone rule to just add @Injectable() to all classes that are injected.\n. Sorry, I misinterpreted what \"live example\" means. Usually this opens a Plunker but here it't an embedded Plunker. Haven't seen that before.\n. https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/component-communication.html#!#bidirectional-service\n. The documentation goes quite some length about using services to communicate. This is how it's done in Angular2 when the elements are not direct parent-child.\n. Sibling to sibling is just two children communicating to the same parent (parent is mediator) or like two independent components using a shared service.\nYou can use a template variable to refer to a component on a sibling element from within the same template.\nPerhaps it could be stated in the docs that there is no special support for sibling-to-sibling communication.\n. @ayanb1991 @rajachennupati GitHub issues are for bug reports and feature requests.\n    For support questions please use other channels like the ones listed in CONTRIBUTING - Got a Question or Problem?. @Jaithra \nGitHub issues are for bug reports and feature requests.\n    For support questions please use other channels like the ones listed in CONTRIBUTING - Got a Question or Problem?. I guess this is because one is created outside beforeEach and another one inside.\nSee also http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40882395/why-does-angular-2-provider-usevalue-clone-objects?noredirect=1#comment68979871_40882395. Shouldn't this be mostly obsolete or at least discouraged, since the introduction of <ng-container>?. @Foxandxss There seems to be missing something from your comment\nIs <ng-container> not yet the preferred way?. > except one knows what she's doing\nI mean that demonstrating binding to methods in docs without special mention of the pitfalls is a bit dangerous because people might not know about the pitfalls.\nIf you know that the method must not return a new instance every time it's called, and that the method shouldn't do expensive work, then binding to a method is just fine.\nBinding to a getter is basically the same but I think it's known more widely that getters shouldn't do expensive work.\n. > Do you really think someone is going to treat this as a recommended practice. \nThat's why I created this issue, because someone was arguing on SO that this should work because it is even explained this way at (with the link in my original issue comment).\nChanging it to \nts\nstyles = {\n    // CSS property names\n    'font-style':  this.canSave      ? 'italic' : 'normal',  // italic\n    'font-weight': !this.isUnchanged ? 'bold'   : 'normal',  // normal\n    'font-size':   this.isSpecial    ? '24px'   : '8px',     // 24px\n};\nsetStyles() {\n  return styles;\n}\nwould already fix the main issue but then \nts\nstyles = {\n    // CSS property names\n    'font-style':  this.canSave      ? 'italic' : 'normal',  // italic\n    'font-weight': !this.isUnchanged ? 'bold'   : 'normal',  // normal\n    'font-size':   this.isSpecial    ? '24px'   : '8px',     // 24px\n}; \nwith\nhtml\n<div [ngStyle]=\"styles\">\nwould also do.\nI'm not sure what of this is part of the point that is supposed to be made by this example.. No worries :smile:,  :heart: your work!. wouldn't juts #COMMON_DIRECTIVES cover both?\n. @kwalrath why do you think relative imports are bad? I haven't seen any comment that they should be avoided, also not when library statements are omitted.\nWould't that make Dart look more cumbersome?\n. I personally like it this way but the style guide says to omit {} when they are not required \n. Does this really have an effect, a no-op callback in a Future that's not returned? Is this just for the side effect of zone intercepting this for change detection. \nIs this telated to\n\nYou can. Call markForCheck on a change detector ref, and then call LifeCycle.tick.\n\n(a comment in http://victorsavkin.com/post/110170125256/change-detection-in-angular-2)\n. Have you considered adding https://www.dartlang.org/tools/pub/pubspec.html#sdk-constraints? \n. Are relative imports ok now? \n. async is redundant when await isn't used. \n. I think you should ensure only strings are used in route parameters. If you navigate by clicking a bookmark you'll get a string not an int. I'm on the phone which makes reading cumbersome but i think it's cause by gotoDetail() where an int is passesd to navigate()\n. Wouldn't there shorthand functions (=> instead of {}> be more appropriate (also below one-liners) ? \n. There was a mention on another PR and the comments sounded that SDK constraint >=1.13.0<2.0.0 makes sense to ensure ^1.2.3 version constraints in pubspec.yaml are supported as well as async / await. \nSee https://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/693#discussion_r49625450 and follow-ups.\nNo definitive yes/or no though.\n. should be Tires instead of constructor\n. Car\n. TS code\n. TS code\n. TS code\n. TS code\nand also further down - stop commenting here\n. === not valid Dart\n. TS ===\n. ===\n.

Just wanted to get this topic some attention.\n. Any feedback on this string interpol style yet? \nThe Dart style guide discourages {} here\n. shouldn't this use async / await ?\n. shouldn't this use async / await ?\n. This is ok, it uses hero_service_1.dart where the value is returned sync.\n. This is ok, it uses hero_service_1.dart where the value is returned sync.\n. Is \"JavaScript cycle\" a good explanation here?\n. Sounds good and should fly in JS land as well\n. What does this mean? I got the impression this is the preferred style currently? \n. This doesn't work in Dart, is it supposed to?\n. !== should be !=\n. Shouldn't a pipe implement PipeTransform?\nWhy would a pipe need the @Injectable() annotation while directives and components don't?\n. The other methods have a return type but this one doesn't.\n. ''' is for multiline string literals, no need to +\n. as before - remove ''' + ..'''. empty constructor bodies{}are discouraged by the Dart style guide\n. return type? There are several without. IMHO public API should have types in Dart.\n. don't use'''for single line strings\n. Is this how darformat formats this? I got the impression this was changed to one line for each cascade. Could be wrong though.\n. use'instead of'''. I guess this should fail at least in checked mode becauseNewLoggerdoesn'timplementorextendOldLogger.\n. same here, these two seem not to be compatible\n.'''.'''.this.probably redundant in Dart\n. space afterEngine...\n. This is more strict in Dart and might need another phrase. \"implements the same interface\" or similar.\n. Didn't know that. Some pointer how would be great.\n.Futurein Dart\n. Is this tested? I think to remember that this didn't work for me - that Dart needs@Injectable()even when the class doesn't have constructor parameters. Might be wrong though.\n. That doesn't seem right. Only a specified list of annotations are considered for Angular DI AFAIK. \n. This doesn't apply to Dart. In TS this would needforwardRef(() => {})` but in Dart the order of the classes doesn't matter.\n. I guess not. This is something done outside the class (3rd-party) otherwise the DI factory wouldn't   be necessary in the first place.\n. Quite easy\njust a few bits about how it looks in Dart. If more info is needed just ping me\n``` dart\nimport 'package:test/test.dart';\nimport 'package:angular2/angular2.dart';\nimport 'package:angular2_testing/angular2_testing.dart';\nvoid main() {\n  initAngularTests();\n  group('basic', () {\n    ngTest('single selection', (TestComponentBuilder tcb) async {\n      ComponentFixture tc = await tcb.createAsync(SingleConfigured);\n      tc..detectChanges();\n      BwuArraySelector el =\n          (tc.componentInstance as SingleConfigured).arraySelector;\n      // Nothing selected\n      expect(el.selectedItem, null);\n      expect(el.isSelected(el.items[0]), isFalse);\n      expect(el.isSelected(el.items[1]), isFalse);\n``\n. That doesn't sound right to me. AFAIK@Injectable()is necessary when the requested type has constructor arguments (from the docs). I doubt it is related to how you request an instance. Angular2 internally also just callsInjector.resolveAndCreate. I guess nobody is going to use dart2js with Angular\n. Haven't seen this file for a long time, is this still created by any related tool?\n. Is there any style guide for Angular or Angular.io whether there should be spaces or not?\n. return type\n. return type\n. I think Dart imports should come first @kwalrath?\n. return type\n. This doesn't look ok to me. Where can I find the original source? Is it https://github.com/angular/angular.io/blob/77db0755c8ce8e001779937e5b890f13a3996484/public/docs/_examples/server-communication/ts/app/toh/toh.component.ts#L39?\n. What is this used for?\nSounds like https://api.dartlang.org/1.14.2/dart-convert/JsonEncoder/JsonEncoder.withIndent.html\n. I guess because there is no Dart equipment to theHttpclass used in TS\n. I see. I haven't seen where it's used and the name indicated something else. I guess it's fine then :)\n. that definitely works, if a value is passes instead of a matcher the equals matcher is used. I find it less cluttered without equals, which is by far the most used matcher. \n. @adaojunior no, I never user JSONP myself, therefore I didn't think of that. The name is probably fine :)\n. The lifecycle methods don't have return types (here and below) is this intentional?\n. The` seems redundant. Why single quote while elsewhere in the template double quotes are used?\n. Why are the imports changed to angular2/angular2.dart? AFAIR it was suggested not too long ago to prefer core.dart.\n. redundant \\ \n. ... to always contain? the current ...\n. I have no idea where exactly I saw this. It was a while back when the public API was reworked about 2 months ago. I don't think it's too important. \n. Shouldn't ROUTER_DIRECTIVES be added to PLATFORM_DIRECTIVES in pubspec.yaml? If routing is used they are probably used  a lot throughout the application.\n. return type? Are there any guidelines about return types of lifecycle callbacks (ngOnInit()?\n. Shouldn't the Location class be used for this (https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/75343eb34007579be9cdc803da834c38e02ae12c/modules/angular2/src/router/location/location.ts#L111) for proper abstraction?\nIt doesn't matter in this example but I got the impression that Angular tries to promote a style that is compatible with WebWorker and server side rendering.\n. This can also be done in TypeScript (see https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/5938 for instructions). I guess this would be great to show in the tutorial (TS and Dart). Adding ROUTER_DIRECTIVES to each component is error prone and cumbersome.\n. Sorry, but I guess not. I have myself involved in too many things already. I need to be more productive on my own work.\nMaybe this helps a bit\nfor TS it can be done this way (added to bootstra(...)\nts\nprovide(PLATFORM_DIRECTIVES, {useValue: [ROUTER_DIRECTIVES], multi: true})\nin Dart (see last line, rest just for context)\ndart\n- angular2:\n    entry_points:\n    - web/main.dart\n    platform_pipes: 'package:angular2/common.dart#COMMON_PIPES'\n    platform_directives:\n    - 'package:angular2/common.dart#COMMON_DIRECTIVES'\n    - 'package:angular2/router.dart#ROUTER_DIRECTIVES'\nthis way the ROUTER_DIRECTIVES don't need to be added to each component\n. Adding ROUTER_PROVIDERS on a component instead of to boostrap(AppComponent, [ROUTER_PROVIDERS]) seems to cause issues with routing. I suggested to move them to bootstrap() repeatedly on StackOverflow and most of the time this was what fixed the problem. Should this work the same on the root component?\n. Hmm, the type is actually Component instead of Component. If you use it with @ it would probably be better to use @Component() (with ())\n. same\n. I guess @Input() (with ()) would be better here. This is a mean bug, which at least in TS doesn't produce an error but  still breaks the code. \n. IMHO in Dart it's called annotation instead of decorator. TS calls it decorator. They also have annotations AFAIK but I can't tell when it's the one and when the other.\n. I don't have a strong opinion in one direction or the other, but I saw this caused lots of confusion. The hint in the docs to use provide: [] on the root component seemed to be interpreted a lot to add it on every component which breaks many things.\nI just think the favored approach should be stated very clearly.\n. 3 char indentation looks weird. Is there some rule for this? Do you use some auto-formatting tool in TS?\n. I would use:\ndart\n@HostBinding('class.theme-light')\nfinal bool isThemeClass = true;\nbut maybe I missed something.\n. Is there a reason this is inline style instead of \ndart\n@Component(\n    selector: 'hero-controls',\n    styles: const ['''\n      button {\n        background-color: white;\n        border: 1px solid #777;\n      }'''],\n    template: '''\n    <h3>Controls</h3>\n    <button (click)=\"activate()\">Activate</button>\n  ''')\nAre such inline styles even shimmed correctly for style encapsulation?\n. Ok, answered below. Sorry for the noise.\n. Same here\n. > The HeroService doesn't have any dependencies at the moment. Add the decorator anyway. It is a \"best practice\" to apply the @Injectable() decorator \u200bfrom the start\u200b both for consistency and for future-proofing.\nFrom https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/toh-pt4.html\nEvent though it's not necessary, per style guide it should be added to all classes that are supposed to be injected.\n. Just saw. It's a Pipe. @Pipe like @Component() and @Directive() don't need an additional @Injectable()\n. I guess RxJS is not covered in the Dart docs.\n. redundant `beforeBroserClient\n. Stream instead of Observable?\n. No XHRBackend in Dart AFAIK.\n. :+1: \n. styleUrls paths worked relative to the component file until beta.17 for me in Dart\n. Maybe I'm mixing something up. Here in the GitHub page it's not obvious what this is related to.\n. I guess this doesn't apply to Dart\n. This might be confusing. It can be interpreted it as \n<head>\n   stuff\n</head>\n<base ...>\nbut it should rather be \n<head>\n  <base ...>\n   stuff\n</head>\nI would write \"as first child in <head>\"\n. This sentence is weird. Might be my poor English knowledge though.\n. ",
    "adaojunior": "I messed up in the other pull request\n. @kwalrath I removed the unused file and changed to relative imports.\n.

That's a library I created to handle the jsonp calls since the other jsonp library was outdated and overcomplicated, the maintainer said it was overcomplicated because when he first built it dart:js wasn't very mature. I asked him to update it and seems like he did, I'll check if it is usable now.\nI created this one but it has no testing yet, I've been busy these days.\n. I remember I had some trouble with the annotation requiring a const class or something.

I've spent a bit of time searching around for references and I keep finding so many alternate \"development bootstrap\" examples using various different package managers (NPM, WebPack, JSPM) and unfortunately most of them are not current -- referencing older Angular2 procedures and example.\nOne resource that I was hopeful about was the Angular2 Starter Kit but unfortunately, it doesn't appear to be working at least for me (but I'm still pecking at it).\nThe one issue I have is that the Angular2 Quick Start sets you up with certain development bootstrap -- enough for a development mode environment, and then all the subsequent tutorials and guides build on that, but then there's no conclusion -- what do you do to deploy your work somewhere other than running in the light-server.\n. Found a good place to start on this topic with the angular-cli-github-pages addon (which I discovered on the fledgling angular-cli project (which I discovered thanks to AiA)).\nNot sure if the tool will work for me as it is now, but at least I can see what it's trying to do under the hood and maybe extrapolate the general case.\nActually the ng-cli tool looks like it has some great promise in general for newbies like myself as well as seasoned devs.  It might make sense to adjust the Quick Start and related docs to make use of ng-cli once it becomes more stable.\n.

AFAIK there is no reason, I'll happily merge a PR if you put one together.\n. In general, we don't use spaces, so let's be consistent here and write it as '{{hero.name}}'.\n. Indeed, as per style guide. Do place Dart imports first.\nhttps://www.dartlang.org/effective-dart/style/#do-place-dart-imports-before-other-imports\n. This is a good opportunity to use the async/await syntax. Also, we'll want to handle the error here.\n. I know it's not done consistently in the ts version, but it's more readable to indent the template content by extra spaces. Let's indent all template definition here.\n. Why wouldn't you keep the same provider pattern as in the typescript version? I.e add this to [TohComponent] instead and use DI for heroData too.\n. I think you meant 'WikiSmart loading', please fix\n. I think it would be cleaner (and closer to the ts version) to do something like this:\n  final heroes = JSON.decode(response.body)['data'].map((value) => new Hero.fromJson(value)).toList();\n. Sure, but let's keep this is as toh_component providers.\n. Yes, that's exactly what I meant!\n. Nit: Add a newline between distinct groups of imports.\n. Nit: relative imports come after all other kind of imports + separate groups by a newline.\n. Yes, it is required that factories/classes used in providers be public, also, you will need to add the @Injectable() annotation to enable Angular to find the reflection information.\nCan you move this to the my-toh component?\n. The API of jsonp is a bit awkward here, it's not immediately clear why we need to return result[1].\n.

Return type.\nAlso, this is against the general Dart style guide as we're using an action verb but not actually performing any changes.. Can we consider renaming this and making it a get?\n. Add void return type.\n. All car, heroService and hero should be final here imo.\n. I don't think the blank space before {{car.drive()}} is intended here?\n. Move ''' to the end of the last line.\n. Make heroes final?\n. Full type for Map? I suppose it's <String, String>?\n. Empty line after constructor.\n. final\n. Map of <String, String>?\n. Return-type of void.\n. Empty line after this + final + ideal would be to expose a read-only Iterable<String> logs.\n. Would be nicer to explain the purpose of the providers list on bootstrap instead. I.e. to override core features/services provided by Angular, etc.\nAh looks like it's done in the documentation instead. Should we try to have comments make sense without the documentation too, in case users read/experiment with the code directly?\n. We can use arrow syntax here.\n.

Cleaner to have title final since we should set it only once for the lifetime of the app. \n. : title = config.title;\n. final instead of var\n. Same comment about title and final.\n. Nit: newline after ctor.\n. Could showcase the cascade operator here:\nreturn new Car(createEngine(), createTires())..description = 'Factory';\n. All core pipes have the @Injectable() annotation: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/modules/angular2/src/common/pipes/lowercase_pipe.ts\nBut I'm not convinced either that it's effectively required.

Remove #withTrackBy here, it's used on the preceding div to compare the number of changes with the equivalent ngFor without using trackBy.\nWhen adding #withTrackBy here, you'll be counting the changes twice.\n. Why the leading space here?\n. Revert to old formatting here, prefer leading with 4 spaces when starting a new line with attribute or property bindings.\n. Think there is an issue with end of the sentence. Do we mean: 'when Angular IS in control'?\n. Indent the template HTML by 2 more spaces. \n. Indentation is off here + indent template by 2 more spaces.\n. What's this?\n. Prefer using nullaware operators for these:\n  child?.hero ?? 'no'\n. Prefer single quotes for Strings in Dart.\n.

Perhaps my eye for design isn't as keen as yours @naomiblack , but I am not sure I notice the \"squashed width\" in the logo. Do you have a screenshot of how it used to look before? Or how you want it to look?\nThis is currently how it looks live in production. I've included the computed properties from Chrome DevTools, the image asset is already at 100% width within its own container (I've added the width css property to be explicit in the pic, but it's not needed), it seems to me that the asset is already at full width, regardless of the height.\n\nSince the angular logo and text are part of the same asset, I can't individually manipulate them through css, I would need a new asset which complies with what we hope to achieve.\n. I believe it is also this https://github.com/angular/angular.io/issues/1177\n. I cloned the pull request locally, this seems to have fixed the issue. We are awaiting a merge for https://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/999 to fix the issue. Who else is part of the approval process? @naomiblack \nHere is /docs/ts/latest from the cloned repo of the pull request:\n\nIn the process of checking this out I also noticed https://github.com/angular/angular.io/issues/1015\n. @naomiblack with @alexwolfe changes, should we close this issue? https://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/1141\n. To accomplish this work the template file located in tools/api-builder/templates/class.template.html needs to be modified. @amitafr I'll walk you through it.\n. Additional fields in the documentation are needed to achieve the proposal, in particular there has to be a way to extract the text that will populate \"What it does\", \"How to use\", etc. @naomiblack. \nConsider the following Angular 2 directive. There currently doesn't exist a predictable way of delimiting sections in the doc string. @petebacondarwin has discussed with me the possible intent of adding @howtouse, @whatitdoes, etc...tags that will match the text we need to be exposed and stylized in the doc site. However, a decision must be made on this @IgorMinar.\n. @naomiblack I've made a list here https://github.com/angular/angular.io/issues/1028, I will be submitting a separate PR which adds support for these tags.\n. Still a work in progress, but I've managed to get the dgeni+jade templates to work in our favour.\n\n. Many of the things in the proposal have been implemented. I would say that we are missing the following:\nBar for code examples and live demo\n\nTooltips\n\nFloating Footer in API Doc\n\n. @naomiblack could we label this design love? \nThis is a similar, but separate issue to https://github.com/angular/angular.io/issues/963, the pending pull request for #963 will only fix the drop down flicker in /docs/ts/latest, but not in /docs/ts/quickstart\n. PR merged in\n. @petebacondarwin has requested that I comment the fact that, we might need to add @draft in the future. This addition will be easy to do. For now, @draft seems like it will be rarely used or present.\n. Would you like to take a look @naomiblack? @draft is seen on the proposal document, but @petebacondarwin commented on the fact that it is a rarity.\n. I'll do this one next, I'll refer to the API doc proposal from here https://github.com/angular/angular.io/issues/964\n. Work in-progress, but getting there.\n\n\n\n. @naomiblack as it stands, I am defaulting to stable. \nI can perform a check for @stable, however, if we choose to default to experimental every single page in the api doc will have an experimental label, unless given that the explicit @stable which currently does not exist in angular.io or angular2. I can add the tag in angular.io, but we will need to coordinate the @stable effort on angular2. Is this what we want?\nReferences:\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular.io/issues/1098\nPreview:\n\n. ~~@naomiblack  We already have @deprecated, wouldn't the absence of this tag imply stable? If so, then we wouldn't need the @stable tag. However, I see how we could use @docsNotRequired.~~\nOh I see what you mean by 'We need @stable rather than @unstable because we want the default state (if the author forgets about the special tag) to be to show an API doc page as experimental.', if we treat all features as experimental we would need a @stable tag to disambiguate.\n.

I feel like this specific issue should be submitted to the angular repo, consider the CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines in their repo. There is a docs type for only documentation changes which are in the doc string.\nNote however that not all documentation of angular2 is in the angular2 repo, it just so happens that this one was. Take the HostBinding for example, you'll notice that there is an exported from angular2/core defined in angular2/src/core/metadata.ts (line 1438) at the bottom of the api doc, this is indicative that the documentation was extracted from the angular repo.\nWhen in doubt, I would suggest doing a quick search of the angular/angular.io repo, if it is there then here; that should help clear things up.\nWith regards to the size of the PR you would be submitting, as long as it follows CONTRIBUTING.md, I see why not. Thanks! I'll close this issue for now.\n. @brandonroberts, are you referring to https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/router/Location-class.html? This page isn't accessible through search, and the hero title for this entry is also gone missing (it says Angular instead). Note sure why this happens... I'll investigate when I have some time.\n@naomiblack, I imagine this wasn't done deliberately, but I have to ask to make sure. Is this inadvertently missing or was it removed?\n. The changes are already merged in.\n. @naomiblack we are happy with what we have. For now \ud83d\udc4d \n. @naomiblack we are happy with what we have. For now \ud83d\udc4d \n. LGTM, @naomiblack @wardbell @johnpapa  please have a look.\n. There are two ways of interpreting this from my end. It's either:\n1.) [Directive][Stability: Risk Assessment]\nOR\n2.) [Directive][Stability: whatever][Risk Assessment]\nWhich one is it @naomiblack \n. @bekos, yeah we are currently not using tooling.jade we'll probably get rid of it.\n. @foxandxss woah, I didn't notice that.\n. How's that @Foxandxss \n. @filipesilva @johnpapa we are looking into making cli.angular.io it's own repo. We will be moving this issue to that repo once it is made available.\n. \n. \n. @naomiblack  I get the following error now:\n```\n[08:45:23] Starting 'build-dart-cheatsheet'...\n[08:45:23] { [Error: Cannot find module 'dgeni-packages/typescript'] code: 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND' }\n[08:45:23] Error: Cannot find module 'dgeni-packages/typescript'\n    at Function.Module._resolveFilename (module.js:325:15)\n    at Function.Module._load (module.js:276:25)\n    at Module.require (module.js:353:17)\n    at require (internal/module.js:12:17)\n    at Object.

I'll look into it. Oddly enough, I was able to deploy using gulp check-deploy on my own test instance. I suspect my master branch was outdated.\nEDIT: oh wait, it's been refactored out of angular.io into dgeni-packages. @naomiblack try doing npm install. https://github.com/angular/angular.io/commit/8b1683f51397e704363c52ec504331a60a0fa43e, and then gulp check-deploy\n. For reference, here is a story that is dependant on this one. https://github.com/angular/angular.io/issues/1705\n. We need to clarify how to filter through the API list in a way that is fast, clear, and accessible. I am currently talking to @amitafr to figure out a way to accomplish this.\n1.) We can currently filter by \"Stable\" elements in the API List, but we would like to filter by \"All or Stable or Experimental\". \n2.) We would also like to filter by \"Most used\" which will probably be feed by some list kept separately in JSON.\n3.)  We would also like to search the API list by how secure an API element is\n4.) We would like our filters to intersect. For example: \"Give me all the decorators that are experimental and are a security risk\", \"Give me all constants that are stable or experimental\", etc. \n. @juleskremer it would be great if we could add an entry in firebase which hasn't been approve; and leave it there for testing purposes. Just as a way of doing integration testing.\n. We sort of do something like this already on the api docs, https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/common/index/NgSwitch-directive.html#!#ngSwitch-anchor, you'll notice there is a section anchor on the link which leads directly to the specific section in Class Details\n. Already merged in\n. I suspect this occurred right about the time beta crossed to RC0. I will poke around.\n. Refer to https://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/1440\n. LGTM, here is a test deployment https://doc-bottom-link.firebaseapp.com\n. \nHow's that? The badges are aligned within a flexbox, so I can center them perfectly within their container.\n@naomiblack \n. @naomiblack @Foxandxss would this work https://no-shadow-angular-io.firebaseapp.com/ ?\n. The third point, there already exists a secure slot in the api-list.json, with the changes in https://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/158, the secure key will match the description of the badge. Does this cover your needs @naomiblack ?\n. The third point, there already exists a stability slot in the api-list.json which will match to deprecated if the API is deprecated. Does this cover your needs on this point? @naomiblack \n. This issue remains a bit elusive to me.\n. @rexebin I agree with your assessment for replacing the query with a json object. We would probably have to update the file every time we redeploy. I used .ejs because it looks more like html, and it looked less confusing to me when mixing it with angular. (versus angular with jade). We can use jade for consistency.\n. I've made a new deployment (do a hard refresh on the site), I believe this should sort out the issue.\n. I'll bring over the sites and make sure the build process is sane. I'll also document it, so that it is easy to use.\n. Can be found https://github.com/angular/microsites\n. @StephenFluin thanks for pointing that out, I'll fix it.\n. @StephenFluin I've made an update, you can see it here now https://new-schema.firebaseapp.com/resources/ , make sure to do a hard refresh. I don't know what to do with the nav in smaller screens. So I am hiding it when the screen real estate gets tight. We can revisit the design later, or we can gather suggestions.\n. I believe @StephenFluin has access to the database.\n. I'll look into alphabetizing the content.\n. I started fixing this issue, but I ran into problems building the site.\n. I believe Safari doesn't like arrow functions yet, https://github.com/angular/angular.io/blob/master/public/resources/js/directives/api-list.js#L42\nI'll have a look. Thanks.\n. @chalin the two people that use Safari are probably also not aware of this limitation \ud83d\ude04 \n. I'll defer to my design colleague @amitafr?\n. Thanks for the reply @Foxandxss, hmm, if the API reference is not the place for canonizing the compiler ngNonBindable flag. Where would be the official point of reference?\n. You sir, are the best.\n. Very nice, thank you! A lot of people are going to appreciate this one.\n. @alexwolfe The reason for change was to fix: https://github.com/angular/angular.io/issues/2408; not sure if you saw it. Though I get what you mean with the contrast ratio, it's really subtle. \nNote that the problem is only visible when you are in a narrow resolution (mobile).\n. @alexwolfe How's that?\n. LGTM\ncc @naomiblack \n. LGTM\ncc @naomiblack \n. This no longer works because we removed the router, before we relied on route changes to calculate which items were being filtered.\n. We should probably use the Location service instead.\n. the drop down is an angular 1 directive (uses ng-click), I'll port it to angular 2 or find an alternative.\n. banner is implemented, but has layout thrashing.\n. I will close this issue since we've ported the page into angular 2, however, we will be able to make this page a static page. Opens https://github.com/angular/angular.io/issues/2734\n. This also occurs presently with the angular 1 implementation.\n. Could you elaborated a bit more on this issue, I am not sure I can reproduce it.\n. Good catch.\n. :+1: \n. I realized the naming mistake after looking more closely at the api doc proposal document in https://github.com/angular/angular.io/issues/964\n. @naomiblack would it be possible to re-merge this branch in? I force pushed this, probably after you merged in. Otherwise, I can piggy back these changes in my next PR.\n. @petebacondarwin @naomiblack I didn't want to touch includeShared because it is somewhat difficult to debug and it's used quite extensively in the codebase. The safer route was to include the partial files for the glossary manually, which is probably a more clear approach (in my opinion).\n. @juleskremer I am making an explicit check for approved entries of the resource page ng-if=\"resource.rev\".\n. On really small screens, like the iphone 5s, we get right of the left and right padding to give the text more space\n. It gets a bit claustrophobic when the window is resized, so I increased the breakpoint to turn into a column sooner\n. We will use the title key from firebase\n. We will keep the h1 for now, unless anyone has any objections, this is the Education, Development, Community headers for each column. The problem here is that I am getting this text from the key of firebase and capitalizing it. Not sure if this was the intention. @juleskremer \n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. Originally we believed these would be separate pages, eventually we consolidated everything. So these pages are no longer needed.\n. Thank goodness.\n. everything after the else is the old angular 1 implementation\n. about-card is a new angular 2 component in the docs viewer registry.\n. Before we were leveraging the Firebase SDK to extract the data (and a pipe to parse the data). Rather than doing that, I simply fetch the firebase json file on npm postinstall, and flatten the file to conform to ResourceGroup[].\n. Use this function for implementing the page statically.\n.

I thought that we only need the []'s if we want change tracking on the property? In this case I wanted it to be a more like \"one-time\" bind since it's a unique id that will never change. It just needs to be set once. Am I wrong here?\n. Hm.. That surprised me. I thought the no []'s version would not do any change tracking and behave like the :: one time in Angular 1.\nHow would you do one-time in A2 now? To me the no [] seems like the perfect syntax for one-time :-)\n. I just pushed an update to switch to use [] for all of them. \nDid someone at some point say that one of the reasons for the [] syntax is that it makes it easier to make tooling around the bindings? If that's the case then maybe we should opt to use [] everywhere? Given that there is no behavioral difference between the different formats.\nThe image does not look very different, but I figured it made sense to just regenerate it since I switched to label tags :-)\n.

Closure integration with Rollup works for this simple sample, but I have seen a few issues in larger projects. Basically I've seen the process either run out of memory or hang.

This is still pending https://github.com/angular/in-memory-web-api/pull/36, but here is my first stab at supporting both AoT and JiT in the same code base. We can improve on this, but this is at least a starting point.\nAoT\nI have added a new project with no source code under toh-6-aot. I went in this direction to allow both compilation modes to be active at the same time (with e2e tests).\nThere is no source code in the new project, but there is a new index.html file pointing to the generated bundle. The bundle is generated from the source in the original toh-6 folder. Trigger a build by running npm run build:toh-aot from toh-6-aot/ts\nJiT\nThe JiT code still lives in its original location, but I have added two sets of main.ts and tsconfigs over there.

I have made tweaks based on your feedback.\nI am unsure about the Webpack part though. My thinking is that the most important take-away from this is learning what is required to be AoT compatible. Specifically, which files to include. \nI do agree that webpack seems to be very popular these days though. I have also seen feedback that people would like to see more webpack stuff in our AoT docs. \nWhat I find appealing about Rollup is that the configuration is simpler and requires less intensive tech stack explanations.\nHowever, I want to try to offer the most useful content to the users...\n@wardbell @robwormald Any feedback on whether it makes sense to include webpack here vs updating our existing webpack guide?\n. @wardbell Dynamic Component Loader cookbook ready for review.\nThe idea behind this cookbook is a dynamic ad banner where ads are loaded dynamically on an interval.

It's a bit unclear if we should replace this with alternative details. It's my understanding that the features of ngControl has been added to ngModel, so I assume this section is no long relevant, but we might want to confirm.\n. I see that this change is already on master, but it doesn't seem to work in rc2. Explained briefly that this change is coming soon though... Removed some of original justification for the same name (consistency) since that goes against the new goal of separate names.\n. @filipesilva It looks like this was included in rc3, so we have to update the template to export ngModel instead of ngForm for the input tags. We should also remove the part that says it will be here soon since it's already here :-)\n. That's a good idea. We make that point later in the article, but it probably belongs here as well\n. For some reason we get an issue with rollup not finding the module if we rely on just the barrel. If I give it the fully qualified name like this it works. It's a bit odd, but seems to be a rollup thing.\n. Hm..Does this mean that any third part angular lib has to be AoT-ed for AoT to work? We are integrating rxjs which is non-AoT, but that is not Angular....\n. I wonder if this is happening because the code is already converted to JavaScript by the time it enters the rollup world. I guess the barrel is transpiled as well, but maybe Rollup isn't considering the convention of using barrels...\n. I think I agree that we should have a separate cookbook talking about creating third party libraries. I removed the sentence that said we shouldn't expect AoT since it seems to be a prerequisite. \n. Yeah, the prose talks about how to use it, so I think it makes sense to install it with the sample\n. I think that makes sense. Some of the complexity comes from having to simulate an npm dependency, and at the same time, make it work with the angular.io workflow. \nI think most of the value is in teaching what types of files are necessary to make the library AoT compatible.   . I think it's also useful to describe the umd part of the library and its use.. ",

    "AlmeroSteyn": "Hey guys :-) My five cents.\nFirstly I think it is a good idea to step away from the clickable div here for all the reasons Igor stated in the opening post. With HTML semantics it is generally a good idea to use the already defined elements for a specific job rather than making another element pretend to be something else, unless there is a really good reason.  And if we use the div here it is missing ARIA anyway.\nWhich leaves us with button vs. link. \nI also think it should be a link.\nLook at the ARIA definitions of the roles 'button' and 'link' in the W3C spec:\nLink role\nButton role\nLinks should be used for hyperlinks to internal or external resources. Which is exactly what we are doing with the routes.\nButtons are also expected to be triggered with Spacebar and links with Enter, so this choice can have an impact on the expected keyboard navigation experience. Especially if we are mixing elements on one page. Links are also recognised by assistive technologies as part of the navigation of the site.\nAnd with resources becoming more readable, the user is tecnically able to navigate the application through the browser address bar. By hiding the link destination the user only has to click it once and can then always go there via bookmark or typing it. So the button option will not impose 'security' but rather hamper users who want to navigate more freely. \n. Thanks!\nAs for parade-raining, not at all. Please don't pull punches, this doc has to be as good as possible and that is the only way. And this is exactly the info I was looking for at this stage of the doc.\nHmm, the <a11y... components: I actually feel the same way. This is not something I would do in my applications. I love having free access to the inputs and when I want to decorate, I like doing it like this:http://almerosteyn.com/2016/03/angular2-form-validation-component\nI took the `<a11y..' component line after looking at the examples in the doc Marcy shared with us. Got the message to focus more on Angular than just the HTML structure. Probably totally misunderstood. \nThis was also where all my form related questions came from last week as I had exactly the same questions about actually using these controls.\nBut after reading your comments I am convinced. For the vanilla examples I will be going back to just the HTML versions for basic constructs. For these no one should be creating a separate components, I think. Also actually falls in the first rule of ARIA: to use native HTML elements when you can.\nOnce this is clear I will provide some info on what to do IF you want to enrich your controls, like in my blogpost above, and how to tie it to a11y.\nAnd maybe looking at what if the input is indeed inside the control. But the sheer amount of extra code you need with the ControlValueAccessor is much too much unless you really need to use it instead of the  out-of-the-box value you get from using the native controls directly.\nAs for the other comments. Pure gold. Will be looking at those as well during the restructure.\n. Thanks for the comments Jes\u00fas! Brilliant examples that we need to show indeed. \nFor now we are focussing ons some basic big wins but it will be expanded in future releases. Still trying to see exactly what will be in the first but your first example is a great idea for the section on ARIA states and properties. And one of the classic failures with third party tools. Brilliant to touch upon.\nSecond is just as great! Here we'd need to link up the description to the field with aria-describedby, so will go in the section where we talk about that.\nKeep the good ideas coming!\n. Lets put down the current planned sections for the cookbook for release 1 and also the backlog  of items. Then we can track them, add/remove items and get them in the right order.\nA lot of these are from Marcy's starter document. I have added a few to the list\nRelease 1:\n- Using text as a label for a custom component\n- Using keyboard shortcuts\n- Component that knows its own role (ARIA roles)\n- Managing focus\n- Testing for accessibility (Unit tests for functionality, Integration tests with axe-core)\nCurrent backlog with possible items for inclusion\n- Developer support tools (WAVE, Tenon, aViewer, NVDA, aXe etc. - Avoiding doing a11y blindly. I think this could be great to already have in the first release.\n- Coding accessible forms (labels, native inputs vs. custom ones) - many concepts already covered in the labelling section but need to still look at form integration and validation (aria-describedby).\n- Live page area changes - notify the screen reader of changing content (aria-live).\n- ARIA states and properties: Binding an aria attribute ( [attr.aria-whatever]=\"expression\" ). Important to explain the difference between attributes and properties. Complex widgets and ARIA. This can get pretty big so probably needs further splitting up\n- Always binding a11y attributes to the component host\n- Color contrast.\n- Avoiding keyboard traps.\n- Testing: unit tests for keyboard support, integration tests with axe-core.\n- Landmark roles and HTML semantics + components\n- General a11y concepts: 'Show more' links, image alt, not relying only on color, etc.\nPoints to consider in multiple sections:\n- Binding ARIA to a custom control\n. While creating content for the Keyboard Shortcuts section it became clear that valid examples, like menus and data tables, will make for pretty complex code.\nHowever we could make the barrier smaller to start with a11y if we show how a developer can check his `a11y\nI have discussed this with Marcy and we are changing the scope for Release 1:\nRelease 1:\n- Accessible form control labels\n- Managing focus\n- Component that knows its own role (ARIA roles)\n- Developer support tools (WAVE, Tenon, aViewer, NVDA, aXe etc.)\n- Testing for accessibility (Unit tests for functionality, Integration tests with axe-core)\nKeyboard shortcuts have been touched on in the Managing Focus  section as this is part of managing the keyboard focus. We will relook at this later to see if more complex examples are required.\n. This PR is outdated and should be closed for preference of https://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/1625\n.

And just give me a day or three to get my thoughts in a row, then we see what makes sense.\n. Added a11y suggestions to the TOH-2 application.\nSummary:\n1. All the changes for TOH-1.\n2. Added tabindex and click event for keyboard accessibility. \n3. Added button role and aria-pressed state to inform screen readers of selection.\n4. Also apply hover styles as focus styles.\n5. Extra CSS changes to fix contrast errors.\n6. Fixed header level structure.\nNOT FIXED\n1. Feeding back changes in selection of detail section to screen reader.\n2. Implementing button/link instead of span for first rule of ARIA.\n3. Button toggle logic to fully implement aria-pressed.\nThese would either conflict with the purpose of the example or make it overly complex.  Recommendation to add a note on this later.\n.

TOH application refactor complete.\nBased on this I would make the following recommendations.\nThe following actions I recommend as MUST HAVE:\nThe examples must be keyboard navigable to a degree where a user can use the full function with a keyboard alone. This means:\n1. Adding tabindex=\"0\" as well as a (keydown.enter) event for every mouse clickable element when a natively clickable element is not used.\n2. All hover styles used to functionally show mouse interaction should also be implemented as focus styles to give the same interaction for a keyboard user.\nThe examples must play reasonably well with screen readers. This means:\n1. Supplying a lang attribute to indicate the page language.\n2. All form controls should have associated labels. Either implicit labeling where the form control is embedded in the label, explicit labeling where the for/id construct is used or css hidden label or aria-label method for visually hidden labels.\n3. The <label> tag should NOT be used without a related form control. Rather use the <dl> tag for non-interactive data.\n4. Non-native clickable elements (ie using a <li> instead of a button) should be given a role and some ARIA to indicate to the screen reader that a certain state exists. If this is considered too confusing, use the native elements instead.\n5. Page structure is important so at least do not have any skipped levels in the h1-h6 structure.\nThe following action I recommend as SHOULD HAVE:\nGood contract is important for many users, even mouse users. The color ratio rule of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text should be implemented throughout when selecting styles. [This one has an impact on refactor of previous docs as any screen caps may have be recreated due to the visual changes, however this does not add complexity to the examples]\nFurther accessibility functions such as complex focus management and other ARIA function should be implemented where it does not obscure the purpose of the document example with too much complexity. For example aria-live sections, etc. When not implemented, we should provide notes/comments about their importance to guide developers.\nAlso implementation of full HTML sematics will probably make many examples overly complex but again should be considered where possible.\nIMPORTANT: All these points are MUST HAVE in real world applications.\nLets make a call on what is in and what is out.\n.

First step towards this goal being addressed in #1897 \n. @Foxandxss: There is one flow issue now, because of number 10 being reserved for the router styles. Accessibility now shows as 10 on the menu above and then you end up in section 11. Will fix itself when the router styles are added.\n. Yes, this will and should cater for all styling requirements. Should be able to use as little or as much as the example require. Once no examples depend on either bootstrap.css directly or styles.css anymore, both will be removed from the examples.\n. This was purely my own OCD. Works 100% fine without adding it. Started doing this expecially for code metrics on the code base with checkers that do not understand Angular.\n. Added.\n. Fixed.\n. Added.\n. Fixed.\n. Fixed.\n. Yes. This is why I think it would be great to also add a section on dev tools to use. One of the hardest things for me getting started with accessibility was flying blind. Giving a few options will also make it easier for someone who does not have that specific version of the browser installed to test accessibility.\n. And added.\n. No specific preference yet but I would prefer implicit labelling where possible as it removes the need to generate/bind unique IDs to controls in components. Although both options lead to valid accessible form controls.\n. Fully agree, but don't think this is the place. I'm also working on an a11y cookbook that should see the light in the near future. That has a whole section on labelling, including the explicit labelling version. Here, however, the purpose is to get folks started with Angular2 so I think adding the extra stuff to generate the IDs right off the bat will distract from what the TOH docs are all about.\n. Nah that one is outdated. Did that, then life happened, with some changes and edits. I just created a new one at https://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/1625\nAgree to a certain extent but what we don't want are devs copying and pasting it from TOH because they think that is what is needed to make Angular work \nI think most devs looking here will be mostly concerned with getting their first app off the ground and we should not confuse them with extra code. So in the TOH examples I think we should look at the big wins that require little to no extra code. The rest will come later.\n. Hmmmm it is certainly not doing anything here. Result of copy&paste without looking. Already got it fixed locally, will push with next batch of changes. Not messing with it in the main css file though, as that is used by all the examples.\n. There I fully agree with you. This exercise is exactly about giving a11y that position but to find the balance where the lessons of the separate docs are not diluted. Stuff not added to to the examples due to complexity could eventually be added as comments/notes in the examples or docs. \n. I would doubt that the aria-describedby will be auto-rendered. I wonder if there should not a split between the standard validation attributes being applied and the user applying the ARIA. Otherwise there would be some ARIA properties added by the system and aria-describedby still being added by the user?\n. We have only three ARIA attributes to consider in most scenarios if developers use the native form elements.\naria-required: If we use HTML5 then the required attribute is enough so we only need to add this if we want to be seriously backwards compatible.\naria-invalid: True or false based on the current validity. Which can easily be sourced from the control object.\nSure, these two can be added by Angular. But we still miss one.\naria-describedby: needs to contain, at any moment, the ID or list of IDs of any visible form validation error message elements. But we also need to edit this list if we want to put in, say, a descriptor field. And say we want to hide the descriptor field when the error messages are visible this has to also be possible. I dunno how reasonable it is to let Angular do this as we will need to provide something like a map of generated/hardcoded field ID's linked to validation errors and have an ngClass type of function to add and remove IDs to the ones already there. Having IDs in this list that are not present on the page, even if it is hidden, creates accessibility violations, so it has to be dynamic.\nExample:\n<input required aria-describedby=\"decriptor requiredError\">\n<span id=\"descriptor\">some description</span>\n<span id=\"requiredError\">I am required</span>\nGiven this, I still would think that it should be Angular's job to add the actual validation attributes to the form control, like maxlength, and required and pattern and the developers job to add the two (maybe three) aria attributes.\nUnless it is super easy for them to solve the ID linkup of aria-describedby otherwise there will be the situation where only half of the ARIA attrs get added and the dev has to do the other one and manage it.\n. Of course!\n. These do provide a particular emphasis highlight that is used a lot inside the docs. \n. If there is one I would love to hear about it. Due to the *ngIf the elements are not in the DOM at the time the focus is set, so the browser simply ignores it. Could be something to look at further.\n. I don't see it doing that here. It is not changing the semantic meaning of the element itself buit indicating that it is important information. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_alert_role\n. I was actually thinking about it. But then decided that this was not the place for it. Wanted to home in on a few dev tools that can easily be used during development time, and especially to introduce developers to testing accessibility matters. The mobile screen readers, I feel, is one more step that naturally happens when someone gets into accessibility. Maybe it will show up in a doc in future.\n. http://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey6/#used\n. Agreed. However that is more an A2 doc wide discussion so will align this one to the styles of the other docs for now.\n. Valid point. Will add mention of this in the next commit. However a whole walkthrough of the implementation is perhaps not the best thing for the cookbook. In fact the cookbook is constantly trying to convince developers to rather use the native elements. \n. Will be aligned in the next commit.\n. Sure! A mention is worth it.\n. I don't want to add this link to the docs. It is a survey that can be superseded at any stage and therefore adds more maintenance. Like many things in the cookbook we are simply suggesting it without references all over the place. \nAs for WCAG I honestly dunno if it should be added. The cookbook is about how to do accessibility in Angular and not supposed to be a full handbook on a11y. I find the doc extremely overbearing for a new developer for a11y. I think a dev learning about a11y for the first time from this cookbook will inevitably find his way to the WCAG, but I am scared of throwing the doc at everyone seeing it for the first time. I think webAIM and a11yproject have much more digestible material for the newbie and I'd like them to end up there first.\nBut I am still open to being convinced. Let me know what you think.\n. Changed this to IE 10/11 in the next commit. Even though there are good things in the pipeline for Edge, there are too many warnings out there to not use Edge. Including the Freedom Scientific site itself. So let's limit to these two for now. The docs will evolve with the field as time passes.\n. Good idea. Added in the next commit.\n. Fixed.\n.

On the contrary, FeatureRoutes is a constant of type RouteConfig, seems to be a special purpose constant??. If that is the case, I think it should be better documented as whether it does not follow the SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE rule.\n2. @delasteve I think that is already exported as APP_ROUTE_PROVIDERS in the app.routes.ts according to the Routing & Navigation section in Developer Guide.\n. @delasteve OK, I see your point! I am too wondering If this export needs to be there.\n. Maybe we could say that it simplifies registration of router dependencies in main.ts as stated in the docs:\n\nFinally, we export this provider in the APP_ROUTER_PROVIDERS array so we can simplify registration of router dependencies later in main.ts. We don't have any other providers to register right now. But we will.\n.

And certainly no worries about editing the prose yourself - I assume you have a better holistic sense of continuity than anyone else here, so do what you think is right.\nI did try looking at the e2e testing, but was very unclear on how they worked (I'm honestly not a big tester yet). I will try to dig in a bit more.\n. Also, is there a tool you use to create those GIFs? And, is the addition to the /resources automated somehow? Or are you just committing a file there manually?\n. @Foxandxss awesome, thanks!\n. @wardbell I think the edits you made are solid. I left one question about one of the code-snippets; but otherwise, I think I understand the style that you guys are using.\nI still have to add the e2e tests. I will get that done this week - but may need some help with figuring out how to do that.\nAfter this is all done, I will be much better with my iterations - once I have my bearings, it will flow more naturally.\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. @wardbell @Foxandxss I added an e2e-test. Would one of you be so kind as to take a peek and let me know if this is what is expected?\n. @mattdistefano Sorry, just saw your comment. I am not too familiar with any of the ARIA stuff (unfortunately). I will try to take a look.\n@wardbell I removed the WIP from the title.\n. @wardbell I removed the WIP notation from the title (re: our meeting on Monday).\n. @Foxandxss when you say \"double quotes in the HTML\", what file are you referring to? I'm trying to use single-quotes all over the place, as that's what Ward asked me to do. If there are double-quotes somewhere, it's just an oversight on my part. But, I don't see what you are referring to.\n. @Foxandxss ok, I think I addressed all of your concerns.\n. @Foxandxss the fact that the UI stops updating after an error is thrown. As such, I couldn't capture the error and then update the UI and then test the UI in the e2e tests. It seems that the only way to test might be to use non-standard testing. So, for now, I'm just testing to make sure nothing blows up.\n. @wardbell so I've been staring at this code for a while and I think I'm having some issues reconciling the NG2 approach here with the existing NG1 approach. If we look at the NG1 code, there are a few differences:\n1. Request / Response interceptors are different. Or at least, they can be defined as separate properties on the interceptor, which means the user-code itself doesn't need to differentiate between the incoming/outgoing when processing actions.\n2. The interceptors are setup during the \"config\" phase.\nNow, I know we don't really have a \"config\" phase in NG2, so maybe putting the setup in the root-component is the way to go. After all, it is the root of the application. \nThe other thing that strikes me is the use of .subscribe() as a means to alter an action. Something about that feels strange. When I think about \"subscribe\" in other aspects, such as RxJS streams, it makes me think that I have access to the \"result\" of something. In this case, however, the subscribe is to the in-process workflow. Just feels a little odd.\nI'm still noodling on this, but just some thoughts I had.\n. Going back to the config phase, I almost wish we had some sort of DI token for these things. Like:\njs\n{\n    provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS,\n    multi: true,\n    useClass: MyHttpInterceptor\n}\n... where that class could implement something more akin to the NG1 API:\njs\nclass MyHttpInterceptor implements HttpIncterceptor {\n    public function request( config ) {}\n    public function requestError( rejection ) {}\n    public function response( config ) {}\n    public function responseError( rejection ) {}\n}\nThen, maybe this class could also add another \"Subject\" for the root-node to subscribe to for the logging.\n. @ocombe In general, I would agree. But, in this case, I'm using the Browser bootstrap. If I were to use a different bootstrap, I think that's when you would need to change the way the promise is handled?\n. I don't actually know what that line does. I saw that you added it to one of my other cookbooks:\nhttps://github.com/IdeaBlade/angular.io/blame/master/public/docs/_examples/cb-set-document-title/ts/app/main.ts#L1\n... so I just copied it over here as well. Should I remove?\n. No problem, I can do that. I didn't realize that was part of the style.\n. I find it easier to scan as they are listed alphabetically. Should I convert to one line?\n. I've sort of just developed that style that the property definition says \"what it is\" and the constructor says \"what value it has.\" Mostly, I'm just making it up as I go along. That said, outside of TypeScript, I don't believe that you can actually initialize class properties as part of the prototype. So, putting the values in the constructor may keep the code truer to the ES6 spec? But, like you, I don't feel very strong. I'll do what ever you think keeps it most consistent.\n. I'm just trying to specify what I can. Should I remove?\n. @Foxandxss it looks like if I remove it I get:\nsh\n[08:46:47] [gulp-tslint] error cb-item-template/ts/app/main.ts[6, 9]: function invocation disallowed: console.info\n[08:46:57] 'lint' errored after 18 s\n[08:46:57] Error in plugin 'gulp-tslint'\n. onverting -> converting\n. plain\n. I think you need and at the start of this line.\n. JavaScript\n. In ES5.\n. JavaScript\n. In ... JavaScript.\n. JavaScript\n. I think remove the the in use the a.\n. Since Functions are hoisted, it might be nice to move the annotations assignment above the actual constructor that it is referencing. This would keep the \"shape\" of the code more consistent between the various versions.\n. Oh wait, I see, you're still using class - then I don't think they are hoisted. Sorry, was getting confused between the ES6 and ES5 versions.\n. ",

    "choeller": "Hi guys, \nok - I kind of understand some of your arguments, but to me it still seems, that most of them are only valid when thinking in \"TypeScript is JavaScript\" . I'm a little \"scared\" that by promoting underscore-prefix we would motivate people to just use their well-known patterns from JS-world just because they are used to it. So let me try to make my points:\n\nUnderscore is a good indicator during debugging \n\nI really don't think that people writing TypeScript-applications are going to debug their applications in compiled JS. This is a total PITA and it's super easy to configure Source-Maps to debug in TypeScript. \n\n\n{{dir.foo}}\n{{dir._bar}}\n\nIMO this argument only persist as long as you don't use a good IDE. E.g. Webstorm already only shows the public fields of an object for auto-completion and I'm totally sure that tooling-support for ng2 and TypeScript will become even better in the future:\n``` ts\nclass CalendarEntry {\n  private formatter: any;\n  constructor(public startTime: string, public endTime?: string) {\n}\n}\n@Component({\n  selector: 'calendar',\n  ...\n})\nexport class CalendarComponent {\n  calendarEntry: CalendarEntry;\n}\n```\n\nAlso you don't ask people to prefix their interfaces with \"I\" like ITaskService only to add semantics - your IDE will tell you cannot use extends with the interface so their is no need to encode this into the naming. \n\nI guess this is also for Dart \"compatibility\" where the _ actually makes members private.\n\nIn my opinion you should use Dart-conventions when writing your apps in Dart and you should use TypeScript-conventions when writing apps in TypeScript (So when writing apps in Plain old JS you should also use the underscore-prefix). You would never ask a Dart-Developer to name their files with dashes (e.g. customer-management.service.dart) as Dart uses underscores for filenames.\nI think that the \"mental model\" should be, that it's a coincidence that TypeScript will become JS to be used in the browser, so IMO it's quite of bad to transfer old \"JS-Hacks\" in the shiny new TS-world ;)\nStill I'm not 100% sure about it, but I think Angular should be really careful what to promote here, especially when violating the underlying languages rules.\n/cc  @johnpapa @wardbell \n. @zoechi I see that this is true for the development of angular itself (the framework) but I just don't see the use-case to compile my own app to Dart, or am I missing something here? \n\nif you don't intend to make your packages available to Dart or JS, then you are free to not use _ anyway. If this style guide should also apply for contributions to Angular, then I think requiring _ for private fields is valid.\n\nI think you really hit the point here: contributing to angular has kind of special requirements because of the ts2dart thing etc. but for at least 99% of the people out there this is irrelevant. IMO the style-guide should be meant for the developers out there getting up and running with the platform - for Contributors there already is a detailed documentation on what to pay attention (https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#rules)\n. > Like I said, for an app (that is not meant to be consumed as a dependency by another product), it doesn't make a difference. But it would be very confusing to have a guideline that says: \"Use this naming convention when developing a 3rd-party module, but use another naming convention when developing your app\".\nI think this is the main point where our opinions differ. When creating a public API you always need to think about the target-system. E.g. when creating a JSON/REST-Interface in Ruby you would not define the fields with snake_case, but you would also not write all your ruby code in camelCase just because of an API you need to provide. \nLooking at all major blogs and resources writing about Angular 2 you can see that people are already embracing the new language features. E.g. @PascalPrecht's toughtram (http://blog.thoughtram.io/angular/2016/02/22/angular-2-change-detection-explained.html) @vsavkin's  blog (http://victorsavkin.com/post/137821436516/managing-state-in-angular-2-applications) @gsans's medium articles (https://medium.com/google-developer-experts/angular-2-introduction-to-redux-1cf18af27e6e#.94p98vo6x), the ionic-blog (http://blog.ionic.io/ionic-2-and-auth0/). @jashmenn's ng-book (https://www.ng-book.com/2/), all of the currently available popular starter kits,  the egghead and udemy video courses. etc. etc. I really don't think that all of them did that accidentally, so this shows, that people \"like\" the new TypeScript features and use them. \nI would really love to hear the opinions of more people then the ones already involved in the decision here https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/issues/703. Maybe I overrate the namings, but now asking developers to stick with their old habits (and violate microsofts guidelines for TS) just because of some JS-Backwards-compability things, to me seems like a big step backwards...\n. Cool, glad to hear this! Thanks a lot for the feedback! I guess I should close this one now... \n. Just out of curiosity: Why do you still recommend to prefix private fields with _. I always saw that as an ugly hack because of the lack of the private modifier, so since using TypeScript I totally dropped that. \n. @mgechev Thanks for the quick reply! I just added a discussion-issue about this here: https://github.com/angular/angular.io/issues/1108. As this convention goes against Microsofts recommendations I think that it is at least worth to think about dropping the prefix ;)\n. ",

Hey Mark -\nAs a first draft, I created a blog post with steps. \nI hope to get feedback before converting the post to a cookbook on VS 2015. Could you take a look at see how close it is to the steps you came up with? Thanks!\n. How is it best to reply to your changes?\n1) I added the learn xxx for dirty and touched.\n2) I could not find anywhere else that we really covered control and controlgroup since we don't have a cookbook or anything on model-driven forms. (I had suggested that this cookbook cover forms and validation ... but the recommendation was to focus on just the validation.) Do you know of something that is just in an unpublished branch?\n. I agree ... but not here since the focus here is on the validation ... not the forms.\n. How important is the change to use ngInit? I didn't use it here because I wanted to keep this simple and focused on validation ... not on explaining how to implement an interface and handle lifecycle hooks.\nI removed the underscore and all mentions to unit testing.\n. OK.\n. Excellent! Just hoping this makes it into the library before Tuesday. I'm presenting on Forms and Validation in Boston and would love to point people here for more info.\n. @naomiblack I would really love to do this ... especially since I've spent some time with Kara going through the changes. But I am heading to Japan this afternoon and am not taking a computer with me. So I won't be able to do this until I get back at the end of the month.\n. @wardbell I updated this for RC 5 and the new forms. It ready for review/merge.\n. @wardbell I had a custom validator ... but removed it to keep the chapter short. You can use a custom validator with template-driven. You just need to wrap it with a directive. I have an example here if you want to take a look: https://github.com/DeborahK/VSLive2016-Anaheim/blob/master/angular2-Forms/MovieHunter%20-%20Forms/app/movies/movie-edit.component.html\n. I thought a separate cookbook on custom validation might be useful. It could cover some specific cases that people often ask about ... such as cross-field validation (such as a start and end date) and async validation (such as checking that a userName already exists).\n. Thanks for looking through these. Regarding your reply to my list:\n1) It would be great to see an example.\n4) In all other places it has wording such as \"in a future update\".\n6) Because it is in every other place in this document ... just not this one. (Search for \"export const\")\n. Does the CLI already do that magic at this point?\n. I would really like to see this come out sooner rather than later for several reasons:\n1) There is really good content here. We can edit/enhance over time.\n2) Just yesterday I received another \"now how do I deploy\" question. It would be great to have something to point them to.\n3) Talked to Joe and he did a chapter on deployment in the Fundamentals course. I would expect this to be coming out any day now. It would be great if we had something in the docs prior to then.. Should each of these A2 columns have links to more information in the developer guide section of the documentation?\n. NOTE: The A2 code will be changed to actual code examples once I have confirmation that I'm on the right track with this.\n. Glad you found the accessibility issues, but the entire point of model-driven is that the knowledge of the validation is only in the code. That way the validation can be adjusted based on the user or on the state (different validation for add vs edit for example). So we don't want to put the validation attributes into the HTML in the model-driven cases. I'm putting together an issue for Angular Forms to suggest that aria attributes are automatically added to the HTML based on the code.\n. I copied this code from the forms example at: https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/forms.html. I added the id's to my code, but the original form examples will need to be changed as well.\n. I'll add all of this to the Angular Forms issue I'm writing up because this should be generated. Thanks!\n. Because the validation is defined in the code, it could be changed based on the user or situation. For example, a field may be required for a normal user, but not an admin user. When these validation rules are in the code, there is no easy way to put the validation aria attributes in the HTML and have them work properly. (I supposed property binding could work ... but is messy in this case.)\nJust as the dev puts the basic attributes in the HTML but the validation rules in the code, it would make sense for the dev to put the basic aria attributes in the HTML, but the validation aria info would be defined in the code. Angular should then add the appropriate validation and aria attributes to the HTML automatically.\n. Can we move this discussion to the issue I am posting for Angular 2 Forms? That way the person implementing this issue has all of this detailed and helpful information.\n. Please add comments and feedback regarding attributes here: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/9121\nThanks!\n. Which sentence are you referring to? Is there something marked in the code above?\n. Will all devs know what an IDE is?\n. I thought at first this was telling me what's different between the zip and the git. May want to be more specific about what this is referring to.\n. Can we say why we need node and npm in one sentence? \n. Since this is decorating the class, consider using \"above the class\" instead of \"below the import statements\". Will the reader know what a \"form model\" is? I don't think we've used that term elsewhere in the docs. And we don't want reader to confuse this with the \"data model\" (often referred to as the form's model) which would be the hero property.. I think of the form's model as the data model for the form. ie Hero.\nI think of the \"form model\" as the set of building blocks: FormGroup, FormControl, FormArray.\nI'm not sure which one you are referring to in the text both above and below.. Ward should probably be the one to answer this.. To me a reactive form has:\n- Form model (FormGroup, etc)\n- Data model (Hero)\n- Template\nSo just the form model does not seem like 1/2. Do we want to be more clear on the form vs data model?. Might it be more clear to name the form something other than form? Maybe \"heroForm\"? That way the reader knows to set the [formGroup]= and doesn't think that the syntax is literally always [formGroup]=\"form\".. Maybe change \"this is the form\" to \"this is the form property\" for clarity. Or \"this is the heroForm property\".. This may also be a question for Ward ... but I didn't think we wanted to suggest that devs add the fb.group code to the constructor. I believe the recommendation is to use onNgInit.. \"and in this case, an empty value\" ... May want to explain why this is using an empty value here.. What is \"model\" referring to here in \"model and template\"? Is this the form model or the data model? And what does \"talking\" mean in this context? Consider something like \"but are the user's entries in the view reflected in the form model\"?. Is this the key reason to use a FormGroup? I thought it was to allow better structuring of the form model so that it matches with the data model. For example, a normal contact data model would have last name, first name, and an address object. That address object would have street address, city, etc. To map the form model better into that data model, we can use a FormGroup.. Same comment here as above.. What do you need here? A definition of what these (valid/invalid) mean?. See this link: https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/forms/index/AbstractControl-class.html#!#invalid-anchor\nAnd if you scroll a bit up and down, it covers the other status values as well. Feel free to DM me if you have any questions about these.. Maybe here: https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/forms/index/AbstractControl-class.html. I am not looking at the associated code when reading this ... so not sure if you are already covering this ... but in most normal circumstances I would guess that devs won't need to use patchValue or setValue. They will instead put the default value in when creating the form model. Consider making it clear when a dev would need to do this instead of setting the values when creating the form model.. The last sentence above is a bit long. Consider breaking it up to make it easier for a reader to digest. Also, do we \"pass in every control\"? Or \"pass a value for every control\"?. Again, didn't look at the exact code here ... but it seems that if the form model is created in the constructor that defaults would be provided there. There would never? be a need to use patchValue in this circumstance. \nLet me know if you want me to look more closely at the example provided here.. Same comment as above.. \"give it\", what is \"it\" in this sentence?. Make me laugh! :-). May want to provide an overview of what a FormArray is. The above does a good job of defining when to use them ... but not really what they are. May also want to provide some context for how to use them before going into the detail of building them. Otherwise the reader has no context for the purpose of buildArray, buildGroup, etc. . Consider explaining a bit about the arguments to the FormControl constructor. The first parameter is the default value. The second parameter is an array of validators. The third parameter is an array of async validators. (I know we don't want to talk about validation here ... but at least mentioning the syntax here is helpful to the reader.). Extra space?. Not sure \"governs\" is the appropriate word here? The form model does not really control the HTML controls on the screen. Rather it just retains its state and values.. Add a link to the template-driven somewhere in here?. \"The group's properties are its child controls.\" I don't understand this sentence. What are we trying to say here? The group has more properties than just its controls collection.. It is efficient providing all of these imports here at the beginning. But this may be misleading as the majority of these things are not required to successfully build a reactive form. It would be really nice to have a \"first example\" that showed the bare bones required to build a reactive form without the input/output /onchanges /eventemitter /FormBuilder /FormArray /etc. Some of these are needed only because of the way our example is set up. Others are only needed for more advanced scenarios.. Should this be \"FormGroup\" here and not \"FormControl\"? (I'm reading these in github so am not seeing the code examples.). We could instead have them import FormBuilder here. Then the reader is not importing so much that is not needed at the beginning.. Shouldn't the type of 'heroForm' already be a FormGroup?. Should this piece be before the refactoring to the FormBuilder? Consider moving lines 284-302 to before the FormBuilder section.. I have never thought of grouping as a technique for making a form more maintainable. In some respects, it makes it a bit more complex. To me, the real reasons to group controls are:\n1) To better match the hierarchical structure of the data model.\n2) To track validation and state for a logically related set of controls.. We had talked about not naming this 'address' to make it easier for the reader to differentiate between the data model address property and the form model address property. . So we are expecting that the \"normal\" case will be defining individual properties for each control on the form in the component code? That has not been my experience so far. . Consider asking Kara about this statement. Is this really the case? Or a side effect?. This is not 100% accurate. You can initialize control values using FormBuilder instead. You do not have to use setValue or patchValue.. Is it a common enough scenario to also mention the routing Resolve to prefetch the data? That was a common technique in Angular 1 with the UI Router.. This would then be where the reader would add the Input / Output / EventEmitter / and all of those other imports that are not needed prior to this point.. \"Hero addresses aren't named.\" This does not seem to be needed here. Even if they were named, we'd still want to build a FormArray here.. I see ... we change from address to secretLairs down here. Makes sense.. Is it that common? Most \"real world\" forms I've seen are huge (like in the insurance industry) and don't include a master detail layout like that used in our example. There just wouldn't be enough space for all of input elements. . AFAIK ... there is no reason why a dev couldn't do this. If they don't care about immutability (or the \"undo\"), there is no reason they could not just assign form model properties to the 'saveHero'. It may be very misleading to have this here, especially as an important note.. Overall - very clear! Nicely done!. Great way to organize this content!. Should \"deployment\" be \"deploying\" here?. Consider using \"correct\" instead of \"right\" here since right could mean right/left.. In my daughter's case, she had a limited amount of allocated space on the server and could not copy all of the node_module folder. Consider mentioning using npm install --production here?. Should be \"adding\" to match the other \"-ing\" words used here.. Missing word here \"that will never used\". Consider changing to: \"are not used\" to be more active.. Great list!. There is something wrong with this sentence. An extra word (\"smaller\") maybe? And the \"less\" here should be \"fewer\".. Consider changing \"Less\" to \"Fewer\".. Consider changing \"will result\" to \"results\" to make it more active.. In -> On?. Consider clarifying \"is no longer needed\". Maybe something like: \"does not need to be downloaded to the client\"  (or user). \"to do all\" -> \"to perform all\"?. Consider adding another sentence here on why this is a great choice. \"Webpack makes it easier ...\" or \"Webpack combines ...\" or whatever.. Consider reducing the number of words here \"you like however, the only important thing...\" to \"you like; the important thing...\".. Replace \"how what\" with \"what\".. \"it can also be served in\" -> \"the app can be served from\". \"will show several console\" -> \"will show several errors in the console\"?. Is there an easy way to set this up so that the same code works in dev and deployment? Like adding an environment variable? Or somehow changing this in a build step?. \"do\" -> \"to\". \"move\" -> \"mode\". Is there an easy way to toggle this for dev vs production?. Missing a word here? \"separately bundle to module listed\". Would this be more correct to say \"lazy loaded Angular module\" instead of \"route\" here?. \"lazy\" to \"lazy loaded\" for clarity?. \"by a simple\" (missing \"a\"). \"it needs to be able to fallback\" -> \"it needs to fallback\"\n. To make this more clear, consider rearranging this sentence. \"If you then refresh the page, you will get a 404 - Not Found page unless you have the fallback to index.html configured.\". Great to see this explained!. \"return the\" (missing \"the\"). \"will look\" -> \"looks\" and \"take\" -> \"takes\". Should we be avoiding he/she? Either \"he\" -> \"they\" or change to \"takes the user to the appropriate route\".. exhausting -> exhaustive. Really good info here! Great job pulling this together!. @wardbell For anyone just trying to build a reactive form (not trying to build the sample app for this chapter) having all of the imports up top make the impression that all of these imports are needed to build a reactive app. So if I can't talk you out of putting all of these at the top, can we at least say in the text that only the one is required for reactive forms, the rest are just for our sample app? . @wardbell As it is ... I think the way we are doing the imports all at the top give the reader the impression that Input/Output are required for reactive forms. They are not. They are only required here because of how we selected to build this app as a master/detail. I think the reader trying to skim this chapter to figure out how to build a reactive form is going to be confused by all of these extra imports here at the top.. In my course I went with \"input elements\" for the HTML form controls to keep the names clear.. I ran into this as well when I was trying some basic scenarios for my course. . My course has not yet been published. It should go out this week. (It got stuck behind the backlog over the holiday.) But I do think that when people hear \"model\" they are thinking \"data model\". So it is important to be clear on the difference between the data managed by the NgForm (\"form model\") and the data managed by the app (\"data model\").. ",

Seems like a poor design decision honestly.\nHaving to manually map (almost) every component in systemjs.config.js seems like one big step backwards.\nIf this is the recommended way to structure Ng2 apps, then a better solution would be for Ng2 to extend SystemJs with a small shim to provide support for Node module resolution, so that no manual config has to be done.\n. ",
    "jmcooper": "@johnpapa I'm curious if you've seen this behavior also. I'm adding the cookbook recipe for barrels and running into this same behavior. It seems that the only solution is to add /index to the end of the import (i.e. import { Hero } from ./heroes/index) or to add app/heroes to the list of packages in systemjs.config.js.  Neither of those is mentioned in the style guide, so I'm curious if you found another solution.\n. I agree, John. It's too bad that SystemJs doesn't have an option recognize /index by default (although there's probably a good reason that I'm not aware of). But even without that, adding the barrel to the config once seems better than the extra import statements everywhere. I like the idea of the style guide suggesting consistency and allowing developers to decide on whether to add the package or add /index to their imports. Having said that, I tend to think that creating barrels to consolidate multiple imports in a package should be a Do, not just a Consider and adding the package to the SystemJs config could be a Consider. \nOn a related note, when a folder only contains a single exportable item, perhaps making a package out of that folder should be a Consider since it really is just changing your import from something like ./hero-detail/hero-detail.component to ./hero-detail and not consolidating multiple imports.  Or would you consider this inconsistent if you are doing this in addition to using barrels like ./shared?  I admit I'm on the fence on this one, but not sure if it's worth adding a package to the SystemJs config in that case.\n. @wardbell do you want to assign this issue to me?\n. @Foxandxss I spoke to @wardbell last week and he mentioned that we could add a section in the cookbook demonstrating how to create barrels. Barrels are called out in the style guide and it will be helpful to have something in the cookbook to demonstrate creating barrels.

Nevermind, it appears the issue was related to running this from a bash window instead of a Windows console. \n. Committed this using the wrong github account.  I'll resubmit.\n. I accidentally opened this against my master branch on my fork.  I'll re-open it with the changes you suggested Ward.\n. Actually, Ward, I decided to look deeper into the reason for failure and the test is actually exposing a problem with the app.  You can see the problem by following these steps: 1) run the router example, 2) click on a crisis, 3) change the name and save, 4) click on the Crisis Center link.  Then notice that there  we have lost all of the crises.  I'll open an issue for this so I can finish up the barrels docs then I'll take a closer look if you haven't gotten to it.\n. Ahh, looks like I just needed // #docregion\n. Not sure what you mean by the hero-list component. If you mean the heros.component, it is being exported in the barrel.  Can you clarify?  :)\n. Ahh, I see what you're saying.  You said hero-list is a barrel, I think you meant hero-detail. But I wasn't under the impression from the \"whys\" listed in the style guide that we were suggesting creating barrels for a single import, but rather to aggregate multiple imports.  hero-detail is being aggregated at a higher level with the other imports, should we really create an index file for a single import?\n. Ok, I've added the barrel for hero-detail and made the other changes. \nHowever, it looks like the Plunker change isn't quite right.  It appears to be only updating the first package in the list from .js to .ts and leaving the others. Once that's fixed I'll rebase again to grab it. \nBtw, sorry for the \"Merge branch...\" commit, accidentally did a pull instead of a rebase on that last one.\n. Also, not sure why the CLA changed to no. It's because of the commits from other authors that I pulled in. Was I not supposed to rebase those changes into my branch?\n. Thanks, @wardbell.  Sorry for the merge headaches.\n. ",

    "colinmorris": "I wonder if 4-10 should be removed entirely as a recommendation. \nI would expect the recommendations in the documentation to represent a \"golden path\". So it's surprising that by using the loader recommended in the QuickStart guide and carefully following the style guide's recommendations on directory structure, I end up with broken code.\nShorter/fewer imports are nice, but to make barrel imports (as described in 4-10) work, I had to add more lines of code than I saved. Namely:\n- I need to maintain an ever-growing list of barrels in my systemjs.config file, and write a bit of glue code (see this StackOverflow answer for example).\n- I need to add a bunch of ad-hoc forwardRef annotations to my code to avoid spurious circular dependencies. And it won't be obvious that I need to add one until I see a runtime error about it.\nEven if it was netting out to less code, I don't think it would be worth the added complexity and fragility.\nAlso, I believe the circular dependency issue is worse than #9344 suggests, in that it's not just a problem of sensitivity to ordering. This reddit post has a nice example of a false circular dependency that (AFAICT) will manifest regardless of any reordering of exports in the barrel files.\n. This tripped me up as well. I had a feeling that the angular repo might not be the right place to file docs issues, but this repo isn't mentioned in the Contributing page, and Angular's CONTRIBUTING.md even says\n\nIf you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by submitting an issue to our GitHub Repository.\n\nEmphasis mine.

    "JohannesRudolph": "Unfortuantely I find ngModules a poor replacement for barrels (because ngModules != typescript modules). I have so far found the following tactic working well, when applied consistently: \n- intra-module (inside) imports need to reference individual files in import\n- a module definition references only the barrel file (so that the barrel API surface = ngModule surface)\n- a barrel file never exports an ngModule\n- inter-module (outside) dependencies only references other module's code via the module's barrel (ensure that ngModule dependecies = barrel dependencies)\nThis way allows me to think of the barell file like a *.d.ts file of the whole module. It has resolved the circular dependency issues I was having. I really like having a barrel file for shared modules as it makes my other code considerably cleaner. YMMV. \n. I understand as much, hence my suggestion for working with barrel files while avoiding some common associated issues. I think it's not a good idea to flat out discourage their use. \n. I've just discovered what I was missing here. My question was primarily about how to combine the two, since their use appears exclusive to me. However, the MockBackend API docs somewhat cleared it up for me, you can apparently inject an AsyncTestCompleter (which however is fully undocumented): \ninject([AsyncTestCompleter], (async) => { ... async.done(); }\n. ... adding to my previous statement, the async() code docs also says: \n\nCan be used to wrap an {@link inject} call.\n\nit('...', async(inject([AClass], (object) => {\n   object.doSomething.then(() => {\n     expect(...);\n   })\n });\nI'll leave it up to you to decide whether the official docs on angular.io should mention/explain this. \n.

It looks like from discussion in the other issues that an on-hover icon seems to be the preferred approach, but I'll leave that to the Angular teams designers to decide.\n.

Adding an on hover icon, or something to allow the user to better understand that the Header can be linked to, and what that link is, allows for ease of sharability.

Possible to incorporate the ARIA checkbox design pattern here so this is a little friendlier to users with disabilities?\n. Any word on this? I don't mind contributing some PRs (or more issues), but I really think the project maintainers need to have a position on this subject.\nFWIW, I would encourage a policy of accessibility by default. There's going to be a lot of developers who are basically learning to code from these docs, so I think the project has an obligation to promote techniques that support all users (I'd even argue that angular's own code of conduct mandates this). The a11y cookbook will be a great addition, but IMO if you have 99 docs demonstrating techniques that aren't friendly to users with disabilities, and 1 demonstrating techniques that are, there's still a problem. So I'd really like to see a project-level commitment to ensure some minimum level of accessibility across the board. \n. @wardbell I'll try to get some in fairly soon. I think the TOH app is the best place to start, but it seems like it appears over and over again, so there's a lot of ground to cover (plus I just need to get up to speed on the project structure and tooling and all that).\n. TOH also has a number of issues with keyboard operability. [Edit: I should say, later TOH examples.]\n. Sure thing. I was going to tackle some of this myself but have been too busy the last couple weeks. Let me know if you want some assistance, though.\n. Added some a11y comments. A lot of these are just issues in the existing TOH code, so I'm not sure if they should be addressed as new cookbooks are added or cleaned up later. Thoughts? CC @almerosteyn @wardbell\n. FWIW...\n- id=\"name\" is the HTML id; AFAIK angular doesn't use it for anything, it's just there to give the label something to point its for attribute to\n- [(ngModel)]=\"model.name\" is what you're binding the control to - i.e. the name property of the model property of your component\n- name=\"name\" is the HTML field name, which AFAIK angular just uses to register the control w/ the parent form or group (i.e. so you can take an instance of ngForm and get a specific control by name)\n- #name=\"ngModel\" is an angular template variable, named name and referencing the instance of the ngModel directive associated with this control. This is the name you see used in the [hidden]=\"name.valid || name.pristine\" expression.\nThat said, I tend to agree that the naming can very easily get confusing, particularly when you have both template variables and component properties with the same(ish) names. Maybe this is something that should be addressed in the style guide and then implemented throughout the examples?\n. > but how to use it/integrate with Java backend project ? i dont want to use nodejs\nIn fairness, that's a little beyond the scope of a quickstart, no?\n. Ah gotcha.\nTBH even w/ that explanation I find it a little confusing. Is the point just that, in isolated tests, you are manually instantiating the class vs. letting the test platform give you an injected instance?\n. What version of node are you running?\n. See https://github.com/angular/angular.io#development-setup - looks like you need 5 or above.\n. Also - the ... is an array spread operator. It's a newer feature of the language, so older versions of node either don't support it or require a special runtime flag to enable support.\n. It's referenced up a bit in the 'HTML attribute vs. DOM property' callout too. Some HTML attributes don't have corresponding properties. colspan is one example.\nAlso might need to be an issue on angular itself? Seems like there's some translation magic happening to allow binding via attribute or property name, but this may be missing (or perhaps there's a valid reason not to use the colSpan property).\n. You probably want to log this in https://github.com/angular/angular/issues instead - this repo is for the angular.io website.. You probably want to post this on StackOverflow or https://github.com/angular/angular/issues - this repo is just for issues with the angular.io website, so unless you're requesting documentation changes, you won't get much help here.. Is there a project preference for nested inputs vs. for/id-based association?\n. I think that makes sense, but I'd maybe like to see both techniques demonstrated at some point, simply because the explicit/non-nested labelling is pretty popular and also much easier to mess up.\n. Yup, I looked through the a11y cookbook PR a while back. Good stuff! Is it worth commenting on that PR now or are you making big changes?\nI guess my concern with the implicit labelling is just that devs who're accustomed to doing explicit labelling incorrectly might learn something from seeing it done correctly here, whereas devs who are accustomed to doing implicit labelling are probably already doing it correctly. But I may be over-thinking it, and this is definitely an improvement in any case.\n. This looks like it's present in the current TOH as well, but is the input[text] selector doing anything? AFAIK this will target an input element with an attribute named 'text'. I'm guessing input[type=\"text\"] was the intent? \n. Yeah I think as long as it's accessible in some manner I'm OK. I can appreciate not wanting to confuse people but I also think it's important to position accessibility as a first-class concern and embed it throughout the documentation. \n. I'm noting this here but it's more of a general question - are the code backticks appropriate for calling out technical terms or should some of these really be ems?\n. IMO this is a little misleading since it's really the combination of tabindex and the keydown bindings that make it accessible via keyboard. So I'm wondering if it'd be more effective to just walk through the whole implementation of the component vs. calling out these two items specifically.\n. Any reason for different text in the title vs. aria-label?\n. Is there a better way to handle this than the timeout? I've typically done the same thing in my angular1 apps but it's always felt like a hack.\n. Does this run afoul of the second rule of ARIA use?\n. Would it be worth linking to the design patterns too? IMO they have a lot of value but aren't linked very well from the widget roles page.\n. Worth calling out any mobile screen readers?\n. Possible to cite a source for this? [Edit: by 'this' I mean the three combinations specified.]\n. Does 'IE 10+' leave some ambiguity around whether you mean just IE 10 and 11 or IE 10, 11, and Edge?\n. Noting this here, but it looks like an issue with most of the inputs - these should have an id with the same value as the corresponding label's for, or be nested within the label.\n. Should render a required attribute too for a11y. [Edit: I should add, unless the Validator is doing this itself - I'm not super familiar w/ it yet.]\n. Should render an aria-invalid=\"true\" after validation if errors are present. Again, an a11y fix.\n. Should also render an aria-describedby pointing at the error div below when it is shown.\n. If possible, I'd be inclined to include the minlength and maxlength attrs here too for the built-in browser behavior. Otherwise this technique isn't actually equivalent to the template-driven approach.\n. Does this technique produce rendered HTML equivalent to the template-driven solution? If not, I think that needs to be addressed in some way - either by updating the code so both techniques produce the same HTML or mentioning it in here somewhere. \n. Right - I understand the intent. My point is that these attributes are more than just hooks for initializing angular's validation - they also have a purpose purely within HTML. maxlength for instance will typically cause the browser to limit entry to the specified number of characters. required will be communicated via AT. If you were doing regex validation, the pattern attribute might determine what keyboard is used for entry on mobile devices. So if the model-driven technique doesn't render these attributes, the experience could be quite different than the template-driven technique, even if the validation itself is the same.\n. Right, but typically the code backticks are for actual snippets of code or commands - variable names, hex values, CLI commands, that sort of thing. Whereas technical terms get the em treatment.\n. That's what I figured - can you include that in the cookbook though? I think having that linked here would help justify the recommendations. Also - unrelated, but does the doc mention WCAG anywhere?\n. I think it'd be worth mentioning somewhere. \nJust acknowledging the fact that screen readers do exist for mobile devices would be beneficial, as I think there's a lay perception that screen reader users are always on a \"desktop\" device/browser/OS. Likewise, if you're building an angular mobile app without a web counterpart, advice about testing on Firefox and IE and whatnot probably doesn't do much for you. \n. Sorry about the late response. I think the wording around the browser support recommendations is probably OK as-is. I just worry about offering that sort of guidance without having a source to back it up. \nRe. WCAG... I think you're right that the material is pretty imposing and could be off-putting. So I don't disagree about not linking to it immediately as another source of information. That said, I almost would like to see WCAG woven a bit more into the cookbook, as I think a lot of people interested in this subject will be looking for info specifically on how to meet WCAG in angular (because of organizational policy, for instance). But that probably has the same risk of alienating newcomers, so maybe it's just something to consider for the future if other folks ask for it.\n. ",

There is no way to do that outside of using the cli, or at least using the webpack plugin developed for the cli: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/%40ngtools/webpack/src/extract_i18n_plugin.ts which is defined like this: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/d52d290c80dc06b9f9c42797aceeebe678231fc7/packages/%40angular/cli/models/webpack-configs/xi18n.ts\nI've never tried to add it manually to a webpack project outside of the cli though, but I guess that it'll extract the translation files during the compilation ?. Yes it's a wrapper. But what it does is that it runs all the other webpack plugins first to resolve the files, transform them if necessary (for sass files, requires, etc...) so that the ngc compiler can understand the files as if they were regular ts files. It's the same thing that the AoTPlugin does.\nthe i18n extraction is very similar to the aot compilation, it compiles the application but instead of transforming the templates to js code, it extracts the i18n messages.\nI'll try to create a small demo project that uses the extraction without the cli. Ok I've tested to use the plugin on its own with an ejected cli application and it works, you just need to add it to your webpack plugins after the AoTPlugin:\nts\n\"plugins\": [\n  // ...\n  new AotPlugin({\n    \"mainPath\": \"main.ts\",\n    \"i18nFile\": \"src/i18n/messages.fr.xlf\",\n    \"i18nFormat\": \"xlf\",\n    \"locale\": \"fr\",\n    \"replaceExport\": false,\n    \"missingTranslation\": \"error\",\n    \"hostReplacementPaths\": {\n      \"environments\\\\environment.ts\": \"environments\\\\environment.ts\"\n    },\n    \"exclude\": [],\n    \"tsConfigPath\": \"src\\\\tsconfig.app.json\"\n  }),\n  new ExtractI18nPlugin({\n    \"tsConfigPath\": \"src\\\\tsconfig.app.json\",\n    \"exclude\": [],\n    \"i18nFormat\": \"xlf\",\n    \"locale\": \"fr\",\n    \"outFile\": \"i18n/test.xlf\",\n  })\n  // ...\n]\nIt will extract the messages when you run the webpack dev server or when you build (in this case it'll extract it into src/i18n/test.xlf). I advise you to create a special configuration for the extraction based on your build script, but without all of the optimizations since you don't need the generated files. Also be aware that it'll build your files and probably overwrite your dist folder content.. I guess yeah, the important part is to add the ExtractI18nPlugin at the end of your plugins list. You should import it like this: const { ExtractI18nPlugin } = require('@ngtools/webpack');. Apparently, sorry :-/. no, require is not valid ESx without webpack to transpile it. no, I meant that you need webpack if you want to use require. @dholovin is your application using JIT or AOT ?. Ok, I'll see if I can speed things up. The updated guide will be ready in about 2 week, but it will only cover an application that uses the cli. I'll work today on a demo app that you can use to see the setup for i18n with webpack but without the cli. Here is the demo: https://github.com/ocombe/i18n-demo-no-cli\nLet me know if you need more things in this repo. PRs appreciated.. I'm not sure if I understood you questions correctly @Brampage.\n\nWhen will this become available in the next version of Angular?\n\nDynamic loading of the translations is only possible with JIT, and you can only load one language fixed at bootstrap.\nIf you use AOT, you need one build / language for now (we're working on a single bundle for all languages, but it won't be in v5.0, most likely 5.1 or 5.2).\nAnd wether you use JIT or AOT, you cannot change the language without reloading the app (since it's fixed at bootstrap).\n\nHow do I add this to an existing webpack product?\n\nThe demo is an app without the cli. If you use the cli it's easier to setup because the webpack config is handled by the cli. You can use the environment files to achieve a similar result.. Hello, sorry ICU expressions don't work in attributes yet, it's on our list of things to do (see: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/9104). You can use https://next.angular.io/ until we fix the main site. It should be fixed now. You can use https://next.angular.io/ until we fix the main site.

    "janoc": "This is very much a Fortinet/FortiGate problem - if their appliance is configured for deep inspection, it will try to substitute a forged self-signed certificate (essentially doing a man-in-the-middle attack). Angular.io is using HSTS, so the connection will fail. \nThis is a known problem with FortiGate:\nhttp://kb.fortinet.com/kb/documentLink.do?externalID=FD37211\nUnfortunately, many of us don't have the choice about having our connection spied on, so we are pretty much screwed :(\n. @mbleigh I think nobody can blame you for that. I have managed to get my case solved by hounding the local IT staff to exclude your servers from the FortiGate packet inspection - we are getting our Internet from a municipal connection which has a contract with Fortinet. \nHopefully I will annoy them sufficiently often (because it isn't only angular.io that doesn't work) that they will disable this spying nonsense for us completely than to have to deal with me again. \nI think the best you can do is to keep this page alive and well document the problem, so that you don't get blamed for problems caused by bogus certificates delivered by this corporate spyware.\n. IMO, SSL breaking antiviruses and similar tools that install bogus certificates in your system or try to do man-in-the-middle attacks to allow data inspection are a much bigger problem. It is not long time ago that some major ones were found full of security holes and these bogus certificates are a wonderful backdoor ready for exploitation by malware. \nThe antivirus vendors should rather work with browser vendors to obtain hooks where to connect the scanning machinery, if the user so desires. Subverting security for convenience (and siphoning your browsing data for marketing purposes - just read the privacy policy of e.g. Avast or AVG!) is a really bad price to pay for convenience. \nFirebase is not a problem - you would have same issues with Google servers too, for example, if it wasn't for the fact that most antivirus vendors whitelist Google from their inspection attempts.\n. @urbanhusky Right - and you are left to trust the vendor to do the right thing - like not to siphon off the browsing data for market research and malware sample collection. Do you really have so much trust in a random self-interested third-party with e.g. your banking login? I certainly don't. Even if they don't do anything malicious themselves, companies were hacked, are hacked and will be hacked and data stolen.\nIn the Fortinet case, their system generates a completely bogus, self signed certificate, with their \"solution\" to these problems being a forced installation of their own bogus CA into your browser/certificate store to disable the invalid certificate warnings/HSTS errors. And the company is completely opaque about their policies, who can see the data, etc. Not exactly something I would trust with my data, especially as the company is in the US where the various privacy protection laws are very loose. \n. @jeffbcross I think Angularjs.org was working for me, only angular.io didn't. It is possible that the .org domain is whitelisted by Fortinet and the .io domain is unknown to their web filter, so treated as \"suspicious\" by default. \n. @jeffbcross No they do it on all domains, except what is in the whitelist, I believe. I think they exclude by default sites they class in categories like banking (I believe 3 categories are whitelisted by default). Then the local administrators can add things to the whitelists too.\nThe lists are secret, obviously. \n. ",

Are you sure these are the absolutely bare minimum dependencies? \nsystem.js / webpack / ...\nes6-shim / core-js\nare optional, aren't they? Others, too?\n. Well, the main question is: What is required for Angular 2 and what it a personal bias/preference?\nI have a strong feeling that Angular 2 keeps people from using it because it comes with to much personal biased modules which interfere with others' preferences.\nThere should be a bare minimum solution, requiring folks to only add one single dependency to their package.json file. If that single module required other modules compulsively, then that single module should come with its own package.json file, downloading all required additional npm packages.\nWe can continue this discussion on Gitter, if you prefer.\n.

FYI, I have to switch gears for a little bit, but will be back to work on this PR. Looking forward to seeing this cookbook in the docs!. In there now investigating.. Hi @shairez I'm working on a few things for this page and including this in the PR for it. Thank you! :). Thank you @robstarbuck and @Foxandxss.\nI've submitted a PR addressing this concern:\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/3521. Hi @thefliik thanks for the heads up. The numbers are there intentionally as they are part of the live example that contains all the demos, so as you work through each step, the demo has the relevant code in component 1, 2, 3, etc. Does that make sense? If not, let me know and I can explain in more detail.. @Foxandxss and I talked in Slack about this, but to answer his question for the curious visitor, yes, this is correct. It is copy edits to the body of the router doc and making the table of contents reflect the shape of the doc.. Thank you @lverns! Great catch. I've submitted a PR for this:\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular.io/pull/3526\n. Thank you @chalin!!. I've included this update with a PR fixing another issue in the same doc. Thank you very much @swseverance!!. Thank you for the kind words, @dauledk :)\nI've just submitted a PR to fix it. Great catch - it took me a minute to see the error even with you pointing it out. . Thank you for the kind words, @maxime1992. Can you elaborate on what you would have liked to have seen in the docs specifically? Was there anything pivotal in your process of figuring it out?. Thanks, @jorgemndoza :). @peterkelly thank you for the feedback. I wish those class names were different too. However, since the code samples come directly from the live examples, if we removed them, the live examples would be completely unstyled and hard to use. Though there are other CSS options, Bootstrap, as one of the most common, at least offers familiarity to many devs. If we created custom CSS, visitors would still have to sort out our custom class names. You make a solid point, though, and going forward, we'll definitely keep this in mind (seriously). Thanks again!. Agreed. Changed it back.\n. Agreed. Changed it to your recommendation.\n.

Clarified \"It\" by stating HeroListComponent.\n. Tried a few things and then deleted this subsection. What the note refers to seems better suited to a different section in the docs, especially since the original implied \"you might wonder why this works - trust us, it just does\". That would require a lot of explanation which would be great for another page. I could try other ways of rewording, though, if you decide to keep it.\n. Done. Chose \"Your app\".\n. Done.\n.

Will remember for future files. Done.\n. Good point. From my limited experience in Angular, I've seen orderBy used for the default way the data is displayed and sorting (coded in a variety of ways) used for user manipulation after the data has been rendered in its default way. With that in mind, how about this:\nDisplays the collection...\n. I think explicitly stating the two is important because the code and uses for those two actions can differ. Left it as is, but I can change if you have a preference.\n. Done.\n. Good catch!! Fixed!\n. Done. (And bookmarked that page - thanks!)\n. Both done.\n. Done. Checked globally.\n. Done. Checked globally.\n. Done. Checked globally.\n. Agreed. Done!\n. And \"let's\" and \"us\"\n.

Complex JavaScript in HTML is irresponsible\" and \"Should we reconsider our reluctance to pass the input box into the component?\", could be reworked. \nHow about something along these lines:\n\"This example works and is fine for a demonstration, but a better practice is to separate the JavaScript and HTML.

Noted on the command point, too.\n. Used \"the app uses\". Couldn't think of anything clearer. Will revisit if I do, though.\n. Good point. Changed.\n. Agreed. Done.\n. Thanks! That one took me a minute to sort out. :)\n. Done.\n. Done.\n. Done.\n. Done.\n. Done.\n. Done.\n. Done.\n. So much cleaner - done!\n. Done.\n. Done.\n. Done.\n. Confession...I love \"let's\"! :D\nDone.\n. Done.\n. I'll be on the lookout for this same opportunity throughout. Done.\n. Done.\n. Done.\n. Fixed!\n. I'd probably strike \"Try it out\", though it's better because it's shorter and more to the point than the original. How about something like what's on the Architecture page?\n\"The code referenced on this page is available as a live example.\"\n. \"and displays\"\n. Do a global search for \"our\", \"we\", \"let's\", and \"us\". You want to get rid of all first person. Ideally, we want to minimize second person, too.\n. I'd change \"Now in your\" to \"In the\"\n. In this and the following sentence, remove the future tense (two instance of \"you'll\"). Sometimes \"you can\" works. For the sentence \"Displaying a name is good...\", you could remove it altogether, turn it into a phrase and start the next sentence with it. For example, \"To show all of the hero's properties, you can...\".\n. I'd get rid of \"We want to be able to\" and make it more direct. I might even delete the sentence altogether and use the idea to introduce the next sentence. \n\"To edit the hero name in a textbox, refactor...\"\n. I'd delete \"as shown\" since that's implied by the use of the colon.\n. Change you'll to \"you can\" or reword making it a clear bridge to the next section. I'd even look for a way of getting rid of \"you\" here. You could do a number of things here like incorporating the imperative or rewording/condensing. Here's a possibility: \n\"The hero's name now appears in the  textbox but the h2 doesn't reflect changes without two-way binding.\" \n. your -> the\n. I prefer the way this sentence was originally since we don't need to specify that it's a link. That should be clear by the styles. We don't want it to read like \"click here for more\".\nI'd check globally for consistency on this point whichever way you go on it.\n. Same goes for \"we\" in this file as in part one. I won't note it each time since you know now.\n. Maybe reword to something like:\n\"It makes sense to separate the hero data from the class implementation from the start because ultimately the heroes will come from a data service.\"\n. This sentence could be deleted.\n. \"That's a lot of styles!\" is a conversational style we've been working to reduce. I'd take it out and reword the sentence immediately afterward to include that idea. \n. Your -> The. I'd do this anywhere you can.\n. We're trying to move away from  \"Learn more\" to wording like \"Read more\".\n. Yes, I think that makes sense. This section really is just a very short intro that could be reduced (because of the conversational style) and then put in the next section.\n. Yes, it is helpful. I'd pull back on the conversational style of how you say it, though.\n. Yes, they should. Check out this guide for assumptions about the reader. DevGuide for Authors\n. Yes it would be helpful.\n. Hm, not sure. I've seen this same treatment in a couple of places and I think there's a particular reason behind it. I'm going to have to defer to @kwalrath on this one. \n. As the app grows (especially in the case of a real world production app), the components can get really big and sometimes one can need changes that another doesn't, so if you separate them from one another, you have a lot more flexibility and maintenance is easier. You also have an easier time troubleshooting bugs because you're likely to be able to narrow it down to a specific chunk of code. In this particular example, the app is very small so technically, here, it's not that big of a deal to keep it in one component, but as an app grows, it becomes of paramount importance. Part of what we're doing in the docs is guiding the structure of the project toward that more flexible solution. Does that help?\n. What's your thought process on the headlines? (Maybe I've missed something - are we standardizing the grammar on them?)\n. @chalin Agreed. I have been making them lower case and linking sometimes (if it seems appropriate in the context). In this case, yes, I agree that linking would be good, too.\n. I've been following the writing guidelines (will share link in slack, but I think you have it). They say to capitalize. There does seem to be some leeway, but I haven't run into a situation like this where each point completes a sentence. Here's what I've been referencing: \n\nPunctuation and capitalization\n- For numbered, lettered, and bulleted lists, in most contexts, start each list item with a capital letter and end each list item with a period.\n- If a list item consists entirely of a literal string (such as a keyword), don't capitalize it or put a period after it.\n- In description lists, in most contexts, start each term with a capital letter, but don't end the term with a period. In other words, for the \"dt\"/\"term\" elements of a description list, leave off the period at the end of each item. Do generally put periods at the ends of the \"dd\"/\"description\" elements.\n- But there's substantial variation in appropriate capitalization and punctuation, depending on content. Don't worry too much about adhering to this guideline.\n. Oh - that's good. Thank you. Done.. Done and done.. Added a note about empty value. @wardbell could you advise me on the fb.group code in the constructor?\n\nEdit: Ward's ok with it because there's no logic.. I'll need your help on the model terminology. Added your wording \"but are the...\".. Oh wow, thank you. I hadn't seen that those were listed under AbstractControl (duh). Very helpful!. Got it, thank you \ud83d\udc4d . Broke up the long sentence. Added a note about setting a value normally, but now I'm wondering why use patchValue and setValue - I have a sentence that's incomplete right now. Will need to ask you about it.. Got it. Changed to FormControl.. Added. Thank you for the explanation.. Agreed. Got it in there and then referenced to the form validation cookbook for further reading.. Changed the language a little but I'm going to do this throughout the doc.. My mistake. I thought that was the rule but on looking it up it looks like your way is the right way. Removed.. Fixed.. Got it. Thanks!. Changed.. Added.. Changed \"are\" to \"include\".. @wardbell would you advise here?. Yes, though there is a FormGroup, FormControl is the focus in the code sample.. We had originally imported things step by step, but then decided to do it all at once in the beginning to minimize revisiting the import statements. It originally was a lot of extra steps.. Good point. It's like this in v1: \nheroForm = new FormGroup ({\n    name: new FormControl()\n  });\nThis is the first time we do it like this: \nheroForm: FormGroup;\n@DeborahK is there a better way to say this that differentiates between the two?. Good catch. Moved.. Changed wording to reflect this.. You're correct. We refactor in the final step when we create the form array. I can change it if you think we should in the early examples, but I think it it is clear when we get rid of it for the array. I can go either way, though.. Reworded.. Will note this for Kara.. Good catch. Fixed wording.. @wardbell can you help me answer this question or point me in the right direction for finding the answer?. Deleted.. Removed.. @wardbell This is in relation to her other comment about doing the imports step by step. I explained that that's how we started out but moved to doing it all at once so the reader wouldn't have to revisit the import statements.. @wardbell Thank you! :). Done.. Done.. Good idea. Done.. Changed.. Done.\n. Done.. Done.. Done.. Done.. Done.. Done.. Done.. Replaced.. Replaced.. Changed.. Changed.\n. Done.. Changed.. Done.. Adjusted language and added your thoughts, paraphrased.. Done.. Done.\n. Done.. Done.. @DeborahK or @wardbell Could one of you guide me in how to incorporate this? I'm not clear on it.. You're right. Done.. I see your point, since the doc is long. This explanation being in the beginning of the videos really helped me get my bearings. I like them in the beginning for that reason but am not married to it. What are your thoughts @wardbell?. I wondered about that. Agreed, removed and reworded the end of the sentence.. Also, I can't reply to the previous comment, but I removed the explanations.. That's what I was just thinking and saying to @wardbell :) I'll do that if we are all in agreement.. Does this work? \n\nIn keeping with the reactive paradigm, the component\n  preserves the immutability of the data model,\n  treating it as a pure source of original values.\n  Rather than update the data model directly, \n  the component extracts user changes and forwards them to an external component or service,\n  which does something with them (such as saving them) \n  and returns a new data model to the component that reflects the updated model state.\nUsing reactive form directives does not require you to follow all reactive priniciples,\n  but it does facilitate the reactive programming approach should you choose to use it.. Will await @DeborahK before marking this one as done.. ok, marked as done.. Changed.\n. ok, deleted.. Fixed.. Updated copy, moved section down (to just before section where we add bootstrap) and linked to it from \"learn about the Angular form classes\".. Done.. Done.. Got it. Changed.. ok, keeping form model. (Marking as done for myself.). Done.. Updated.. Done.. Done.. Done.. Done.. Done.. Done.. Ok, stays as-is.. ah, good catch! Done.. Done.\n. Changed title of section to \"Observe control changes\". Also changed TOC to reflect this and the link.. Ok, leaving as-is.. Done.. Done.. Done.. Changed.. I removed the first sentence, but @Kara could you help me smooth this out a little? I only have at the moment:\nWhen writing in a reactive style, you rarely, if ever, use two-way data binding. \n  For this reason, the ngModel directive is not part of the ReactiveFormsModule. . Removed. I think these were removed previously but got wiped/re-inserted accidentally.. Done.. Done.. Done.. Done.. Done.. Done.. Changed. Good catch!. Yes, my mistake. I misunderstood the last time you requested this. Just DM'd you about it to confirm.\n. Absolutely, added copy.. Ack. Thought I'd caught all those. I shifted a lot around yesterday. Thanks!. Got it. Changed.. Added.. Yes, thanks.. Oh good catch. Thank you.. Possible missing word? Maybe \"the\"?\n\n\"Only directive know what getFoo() does.\"\nThe following couple of sentences use singular \"directive\" along with the plural of the verb in the same manner.. \"If the directive doesn't have the brackets\" or something similar that fixes \"directive forget\"?. I think that was the first of a rogue find and replace that sprinkled \"directive\" in places \"you\" or \"we\" seems to have been. I think I changed all the rest of them. I just went back and changed this one and pushed up.. According to the guidelines, we're supposed to put a period at the end of each list item, however, I have seen that not applied to TOCs, which I consider this to be. However, you'd be within the guidelines by having periods on each since it isn't labeled explicitly as a TOC. I'd probably put them but considering the context, it's arguable not to have them.. Ah, I see you know what I said in my first comment.. Add period.. Typescript Type -> TypeScript type\nPlease change globally from Typescript to TypeScript.. Start a new sentence. How about:\n\nIf this looks familiar, it's because that's also how you reference the _____ variable in TypeScript.\n\nPlease be sure to specify the variable (sometimes a word like \"that\" can be vague).. How about (or something like - we just need to streamline it and state exactly what we are doing):\n\nTo access the hero data the __ returns, use dot notation to traverse the mutationResult and assign it to a ___.\n\nI don't know the exact words that should go in the blanks.. > Once you have access to the data, push them into the heroes array.\nWe want a complete sentence here.. There's an extra heroes and we don't need also. \n\n...your ~~heroes~~ existing heroes app can ~~also~~ add a hero:\n\nLove the gif!. Please make sure the comments are complete sentences. Here are my recommended changes:\n\nThe schema allows the following queries:\nThis schema allows the following mutation:\n~~you need to~~ Tell the server which types represent the root query\nand root mutation types. By convention, they are called RootQuery and RootMutation.\n\nNext, I would add a couple of sentences that are basically echoing what the comments say so that the prose is complete. We want everything touched on in the prose and comments to serve as a way to drive home what we talk about in the prose.. >...between the frontend and backend because ~~if~~ you don't  need to know the specific query the client  makes to create the server implementation.\nAdd \"the\", delete \"if\", lowercase \"implementation\".\n. ~~That~~ \n\nThis class initializes a schema property in the constructor.. How about this:\nNext, the query function takes as an argument the request, or query, and executes that query using the GraphQL execute function against the schema property.. This: \nYou send empty objects to the rootValue and contextValue arguments of the function\n\nLoses me. I get the second part of the sentence about variables and operationName but where is the first part happening in the code? It may be as simple as saying:\n\nYou send empty objects to the rootValue and contextValue arguments of the function with X and Y respectively.\n\nX and Y being code snippets like {} or whatever is actually doing it.. Now -> Lastly\nThis lets them know we are at the end of covering what's happening in this code snippet.. Let's save the details about the conclusion for when we have finalized everything. Then we can make sure it has everything in the same way we are planning for the table of contents.. API, and. I've been thinking about this one for a while but only just now came up with this:\n\nGraphQL is a replacement or enhancement for REST and can be used in conjunction with it.. ~~to~~. your server -> the server. Please search for and update spec -> specification and docs -> documentation.. Let's replace \"You can checkout...\" with:\nFor a summary of this section, see Faster modern apps with Angular and GraphQL presented by Jeff Cross and Uri Goldshtein.. Without \n\nLet's italicize it for emphasis.. ~~itself~~ and add in its place, in parentheses: \"(you cover this syntax later in the cookbook)\". You could even link to the place in the page where it's covered. I'd link from [later].. > And then modify the template accordingly:. ...how to fetch data with GraphQL for a component....\nadd \"with GraphQL\". Apollo-Client -> Apollo Client. Please search globally and replace.. Let's take out \"docs\" from the link since you say the word documentation earlier in the sentence. Also, for reference, I just learned that we should use \"documentation\" instead of \"docs\". Could you do a global search in this file for it and replace in case I miss any?. First, you import...\nThe \"you\" helps show that we are talking about what is above. It doesn't have to be this exact change, but as I read it, for a second I wasn't certain where I should be looking. You could even start with something like, \"So what's happening here?\" or an introductory clause like \"This file begins with importing ApolloClient. Then you create a constant for the new instance of the client, and finally export it so that it is available to the app.\". Apollo Client. (Capital C)\nAlso:\n\n...import the ApolloModule and getClient which you just configured in client.ts.. Let's get rid of any //... in the doc regions that are empty. By saying (excerpt) in the blue title bar, we know that there are other things in the file. This way the //... don't paste into the file when we copy using the copy button.. will return -> returns\n\nAlso, please add the below if it is the case. I noticed there was already a getHeroes in there and assume we are replacing it.\n\nReplace the getHeroes() function with this one:. ~~will~~\n...so it displays..... benefit~~s~~ ~~for~~ --> benefit of. ~~specifying~~. We are trying to reduce use of parentheses. I may have forgotten here. \nwhat mutations, or actions, clients are allowed..... ~~above~~. Please add (excerpt) beside the file name in the blue bar of the code snippet since we are building it and it already has code in it.. Same here: Please add (excerpt) beside the file name in the blue bar.. (imports) worked well above. We could do that here, too. And anywhere where the excerpt is the imports section.. ~~will~~. the Apollo Client. Please move this whole section (Further Resources) to before the Conclusion.. Let's replace \"it\" with the noun it represents. How about:\nYou can look at a mutation as the equivalent of a POST request in REST.. Let's combine these two sentences to reflect the structure of the previous one:\n...result of the mutation, which update.... ~~and~~ -> a\n\nand smooth out the middle, along with writing out \"parameter\":\n\nThe mutation requires a variable and you pass it to the mutate function through the variables parameter.. ~~this~~ -> that. Type -> type. object. --> object:\n\nIt seems like it would flow better with a semicolon.. ~~Once~~ --> \"Now that...\". mutate --> mutate \n(Please put in code font).. ~~At this point~~\n~~also~~ \n\nNow your existing heroes app can add a hero using GraphQL.. oops. Fixing. Thanks! :). Done.. It should only have an \"s\" in the indicative though, not in the subjunctive. The subjunctive here is required by \"assert\", which introduces the subordinate clause of expectation: \"that the application respond\" and the change of subject. It is the same construction as \"She insists that he see a doctor.\" An alternative in English, which usually obscures the subjunctive, is \"She wants him to see a doctor.\" If the first clause and second clause have different subjects and there is doubt, disbelief, denial, or imposition of will (under which expectation falls), the second clause must use the subjunctive.

Done.. Done.. Done.. Aw man. Cleaned up.. Done.. Done.. Done.. Reverted.. Done.. Done.. Done.. Done.. Done.. Agreed!!!. Done.. Done. Also noticed that that sentence started with \"We\". Fixed that, too.. This is a great catch, @AlexanderLukin! I was looking closely at the example files and noticed something though. How about this (or something like it):\n\nNotice that hero-list.component.ts imports Observable and finally while hero.service.ts imports Observable, of, and delay from rxjs.\n\n. Could you change \"chapter\" to \"section\"? We're in the process of moving away from the word \"chapter\".. Done.. Done.. Since these first three sentences start with \"GraphQL\", could we vary the language a little? Maybe one could start with  \"The GraphQL...\" <--- I don't know what the right word would be there. In regular language, interface would work, but considering the context, we can't use that, right? Another way we could reduce repetition in the language could be by combining two of these sentences. \nMaybe the first and third could be combined with the third starting with \"It\" instead. Then we leave the subsection immediately after.. ~, helping your Angular app:~ --> \"that helps your Angular app do the following:\". ~that~ --> \"three key points\" or \"these key points\"\nWe want intros to lists to be complete sentences, rather than having the list items complete the sentence. I just recently came to understand that if you're wondering why I hadn't mentioned it before.. comma before or. Please remove one of the occurrences of \"multiple\" since they are close together. Does that still work? Is there another word we could use for the second one? Maybe \"various\"?. Instead of \"see(video)[#]\", why don't we put \"see the following video by....\" since it is now embedded?\nYou could still link to it in the word \"video\".. After \"limitations.\", consider adding \"The following three sections cover each of these in turn.. I learned a little something about semicolons last week that should change the way we're using \"for example\" if we want to keep the overall structure. If we change \"for example\" here to \"such as\", the structure will stay the same. \"For example\" usually needs a semicolon before it, which in this case would throw off the structure of these two sentences. It's getting into rhetoric and rhythm, but I wanted you to know I'm not arbitrarily requesting the change. :) \n. should this say the \"third\" instead of the \"second\"?. This time the dependency is.... \n~it~ for clarity. This is the first mention of the Apollo Client. We should add a phrase explaining in just a few words (to preserve brevity) what the Apollo Client is:\n\"....the Apollo Client, the x that lets you x, what data....\"\nor: \n\"....the Apollo Client, covered later,....\". \"~A~nd then modify\" --> \"and then modify\". . ~the problem here is that~ --> but as your app grows. please put a comma after and.

It is used to create a promise of the desired type so that the type is propagated through .then. Your approach is clearer as to intent, and is more idiomatic.\nPersonally, I would prefer to leverage type inference all the way throughout the method to avoid misleading and potentially unsafe type assertions.\n``` TypeScript\nexport interface Hero {\n  name: string;\n  powers: string[];\n}\n@Injectable() export class Service {\ngetHeroesSlowly() {\n    return new Promise(resolve => {\n          setTimeout(resolve, 2000);\n      })\n      .then(() => this.getHeroes());\n  }\ngetHeroes(): Hero[] {\n    return [{\n      name: 'Wolverine',\n      powers: [\n        'Adamantium Claws', \n        'Mutant Healing'\n      ]\n    }];\n  }\n}\n```\nLetting the inference do more work leads to more type checking and more specific types.\n. @wardbell that's fair since the IDE isn't there to serve up the signature in the example.\nHowever, it leads people into the practice of placing these annotations. With generics this can be problematic because TypeScript's generics are unsafely covariant. So a Promise<void> will happily convert to a Promise<any> and mislead the caller into thinking they would get a result back.. @wardbell The difference between structural and nominal typing is completely orthogonal to the notion of type safety, strictness, and staticness. It certainly has nothing to do with the issue in question.. ",

I think you should rewrite the tutorial to use the CLI as that is without doubt the quickest and probably most likely entry point to Angular now.  Unimpressed.. I'd also like to question who's idea it was to take a very simple tutorial, one where you start with an empty folder and piece together a simple application, improving your knowledge as you go, and replace it with bringing down a seed project and then a set of instructions for deleting non-essential files?  .

The 6th chapter is quiet long and I am now lost in the middle of it with an inconsitant code base that needs change but I do not see exactly where (I'll find my way out).\nI realize this is yet some more work :) Awesome work and tutorial, thank you .

Seems to me I am not the only one that feels this is unclear: https://github.com/angular/angular.io/issues/2527\n\nI think you missed the critical difference...\n\nA sign that the docs need work.\nI would clarify this by explicitly stating everywhere that module providers can be scoped. In other words, delete the following:\n\"We might expect Angular to offer a module-scoping mechanism to enforce this design. It doesn't. Angular module instances, unlike components, do not have their own injectors so they can't have their own provider scopes.\"\nThis is false based on what you are now telling me as Angular does provide a module-scoping mechanism--the loading paradigm. \n\nWe talk about this difference in numerous places including the FAQs. Do you have a specific recommendation about how we can make that more clear?\n\nYes, talking about this in the FAQ would be ok if you linked to the FAQ every time you mention module provider scope. Because the loading paradigm critically alters scope behavior you need to disclose that any time you talk about scope. Without referencing the loading paradigm when talking about module provider scope, you are simply saying that module providers do AND do not have their own scope.\n. > My statement isn't false. It's true.\n@wardbell Sorry for the confusion, I wasn't referring to your statement. I was referring to the following line from the documentation (this could be your statement if you are the only author):\n\nWe might expect Angular to offer a module-scoping mechanism to enforce this design. It doesn't.\n\nSince module scoping is dictated via the loader this line isn't correct. Or if argued to be correct, it is misleading. Generally if the documentation is difficult to write it indicates a problem with the design, so I can appreciate your challenge. In your case I would push back on those asking to remove documentation... a very odd request for a new framework with a large degree of ceremony.\n. ",

The same issue https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/10522\n. https://github.com/angular/angular.io/issues/3005 is also a part of this. u can't dynamically bind/change input type and the illustration of this is\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/13243\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/12585\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/7329\nand probably more\n.

Not sure if it's a bug or intended behavior but anyway it doesn't work as users expect it to work thus I thnk is should be removed from the docs for now or at least changed to <input formControlName=\"integerB\" type=\"number\"/>. > You have yet to show that the Dynamic Forms guide behaved other than exactly as expected and described. \nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/13243 is not enough?\nAs u can see http://prntscr.com/dqwwfp the actual type of the input is number, but angular still think it's text (default).\n\nIf there's a bug, lets fix the bug\n\nI'm not sure we can call it a bug. It never worked like expected. I would say it's a feature request. It's simply was not designed to work with inputs. As u can see here CVA is injected on initialization and never changes. This is why it doesn't matter what value u specify for the type, angular will always use DefaultValueAccessor.\nExactly the same problem here https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/12585 just different property name. Angular doesn't reflect changes of multiple prop.\nThis is why it should be removed from the docs until it will be implemented.. it's a number 21 because it's an initial value. if u change it it should be a string. I will send a pr tomorrow but who knows how much time it will take to merge it :). I tried to implement it but without any success. As i said it's blocked by https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/11716\nboth\n<input formControlName=\"integerB\" [type]=\"'number'\"/> \n<input formControlName=\"integerB\" [attr.type]=\"'number'\"/>\ndoesn't trigger creation of NumberValueAccessor.

I can't imagine how its taking you YEARS to add the documentation of the key language here. it has all the features in the world you could want in ES6. I can't see why typescript matters really to the extent of totally ignoring the language it compiles to and the language of the framework.\nAnd frankly your slow it down so they learn typescript forceably strategy can't work anyway because typescript is awful to some of us (me) just for what it is, a language made by microsoft that is not even stable yet and being forceably taught through taking away a major web framework from existence and change its core programming language to \"super set of bla bla\"  then later on....much later on announce, hey we don't support js anymore take your pick js or us.\nI don't know why the heck did I trust google with a framework anyway...it was a mistake and thanks to you I will never make it again without those docs. thanks for setting me right\nBut just open the damned issue and declare a time where this is gonna be ready because your \"please bear with us\" from v2 docs didn't say for years, and it definitely didn't exist at all in the angular 4 docs. its like saying....that's the norm now....deal with the normal totally not cross platform and totally not reusable thing.. Did it not occur to you to add the docs of version 2 for javascript through the whole development time and the whole time it took to make it to v 4.x? its not taking long, its being removed slowly and very VERY noticeably!!. for example I do not (and can not) compile a single bit of my code using a microsoft product, for security (and legal) reasons.\nIts not always (they hate what they don't know) issue; typescript is simple. it just uncanny for usage in my case so a translator cookbook from ts to js won't make me use ts after a certain level of knowledge and comparison to the javascript language cycle in my mind.\nwill I be able to use this thing ever?. Wish some people from angular 2+ could do the same really, but this looks big, like a political or financial major agenda role here. js is huge, they knew for a fact that this will be very annoying ahead of publishing version 2.0. but they still did it and are doing it still. for so many versions? I mean, just a single version without the js docs must have gotten google(the company that knows about everything) millions of negative polls and surveys. why are they still missing it version after version, I mean one version would have been more than enough for them to learn how disastrous this really is.. Why didn't anyone reply so far!\nShould I protest for it?\nADD THE DOCS!\nMAKE ANGULAR GREAT AGAIN! XD. Okay, any proper way to have an answer to my(and everyone else's) question?\nHow to use this in js?\nWhere can I find the knowledge to do that?\nWhen are the docs going to be published?

We use composite component, where each stage of component is managed by a different template (e.g. something like User registration spanning across 2-3 pages). To take a sample example, a component has three diffrent states(UI stages) i.e in state one it shows a template 1, in state 2 it shows template 2, in state 3 it shows template 3.\nNow we use state_mangaement services where we tell it the total no of states and current value of a state for a component during bootstrap and this service register its events.\nCode will look like this - \n\nimport {Component, ComponentFactoryResolver, ViewContainerRef, OnInit, Injector,Attribute} from '@angular/core';\nimport {state1} from './state1.component';\nimport {state2} from './state2.component';\nimport {state3} from './state3.component';\nimport {SomeClass} from './someclass.component'; //It has the logic of assigning unique values and managing states\n@Component({\n     template: '',\n    selector: 'common-state',\n    entryComponents: [state1,state2,state3]\n})\nexport class CommonState extends SomeClass implements OnInit{\n    constructor(\n        @Attribute('id') id: string,\n        @Attribute('Keys') Keys: string,\n        elementRef?: ViewContainerRef     \n    ) {\nsuper(\n        id,\n        Keys,\n        elementRef     \n     );\n}\n\nngOnInit(){\n    super.pushComponent(\"State1\",state1);\n    super.pushComponent(\"State1\",state1);\n    super.pushComponent(\"State1\",state1);\n    super.ngOnInit(\"State1\");\n}\n\n}\n\nThe supers ngOnInit has the following code\nngOnInit(defaultState:string) {\n    this.uniqueId = this.generateUniqueId();      \n    this.elementRef.element.nativeElement[\"id\"] = this.uniqueId;\n    this.changeState({state:defaultState});\n}\n\n\nThe state1 component has the following type of code and all three states have similar kind of code\nimport {Component} from '@angular/core';\n@Component({\n    moduleId:module.id,\n    selector: 'state-1',\n    templateUrl: './templates/state1.html',\n})\nexport class State1 { \n    subsharedstate:any={};\n    constructor() {\n}\n\n//some functions\n}\n\nWe use the common state selector in a template of one commonStateMainComponent\nimport {Component} from '@angular/core';\n@Component({\n    moduleId: module.id,\n    selector: 'service-setup-component',\n    templateUrl: './templates/commonStateMainComponent.html',\n})\nexport class commonStateMainComponent{\n}\n\nCommonStateMainComponent has following template\n\nNow we are using elementRef to check stuff from a specific state but elementRef get its value at run time(when angularjs replace #placeholder with actual state template) and our test spec fails as we are not actually running the application.\nSo we need some sort of way to get the replaced/updated elementRef value during our test case execution..

For people who had same issue I had this work around to get the relative URL's. I have my application deployed on to my server and after that it had issues finding the html files as all my folders are under Virtual directory in IIS:\nhttp://dabsaa01/Ebr/build/dist/app/app.component.html -->404 not found\nhowever it has no problem while testing in local pc as the URL is\nhttp://localhost:20313/build/dist/app/app.component.html --> able to find it since it in the proper location in the project directory. \nThis issue is due to the Ebr virtual directory on IIS , its unable to find the path since Ebr in the path, even after me using module.Id concept and html resides in the same folder as js.\nHere is the possible workaround for local vs application on server:\ncustomUrlResolver.ts code:\n```\nimport { UrlResolver } from '@angular/compiler';\nexport class CustomUrlResolver extends UrlResolver {\n    resolve(baseUrl: string, url: string): string {\n        let nUrl = super.resolve(baseUrl, url);\n        let appUrl = nUrl;\n        if (!(nUrl.indexOf(\"localhost\") >= 0)) {\n            appUrl = \".\" + appUrl;\n        }\n        return appUrl;\n    }\n}\n```\nmain.ts code\n```\nimport { platformBrowserDynamic } from \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\";\nimport { UrlResolver } from '@angular/compiler';\nimport { AppModule } from \"./app.module\";\nimport { CustomUrlResolver } from './customUrlResolver';\nplatformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule, {\n    providers:\n    [\n        { provide: UrlResolver, useClass: CustomUrlResolver }\n    ]\n});\n```\napp.module.ts code\n```\nimport { NgModule } from \"@angular/core\";\nimport { BrowserModule } from \"@angular/platform-browser\";\nimport { AppComponent } from \"./app.component\";\nimport { routing, appRoutingProviders } from \"./app.routing\";\nimport { Routes, RouterModule } from \"@angular/router\";\nimport { UrlResolver } from '@angular/compiler';\nconst routes: Routes = [\n];\n@NgModule({\n    imports: [\n        BrowserModule,\n        routing,\n        RouterModule.forRoot(routes, { useHash: true })\n    ],\n    declarations: [\n        AppComponent\n    ],\n    providers: [\n        appRoutingProviders, UrlResolver\n    ],\n    bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule {\n}\n```\nWith above code it is fixing issue with relative urls even with virtual directory on IIS.\nHow ever i had issues finding images url, since its in different folder structure:\nhere is the workaround:\n```\nimport { Component } from \"@angular/core\";\nimport { Router } from \"@angular/router\";\nimport { UrlResolver } from '@angular/compiler';\n@Component({\n    moduleId: module.id,\n    selector: \"my-app\",\n    templateUrl: \"app.component.html\"\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n    constructor(private router: Router) { }\n    private logo: string = \"\";\n    public resolvePath(path) {\n        if (!(this.logo.length > 0)) {\n            this.logo = module.id.substring(0, module.id.lastIndexOf('build')) + 'src/Content/images/logo.jpg';\n            }\n        return this.logo;\n    }\n}\n```\nAnyone from Angular team, please explain how to fix this issue without all these workaround code, for now I am living with this workaround thanks :)\n.

Without using @angular/CLI, one runs into all sorts of problems extracting translation requirements using either ./node_modules/.bin/ng-xi18n or ng xi18n.... @Foxandxss Unrelated to either JIT or AOT compilation, is there a way to only specify .HTML files to the xi18n tool? Instead of it actually trying to compile and find templates itself (which, for us, does not work, because we use webpack and require() calls to template paths instead of directly using template paths.) ?. Thank you for your fast reply @ocombe ! Yes, that is how it should work ideally but I can not even get it to work using the command line (ng-xi18n cannot resolve template paths), because of the way we reference template paths in our component definitions:\n@Component({\n    selector: 'attach-files',\n    styles: [require('./attach-files.scss')],\n    template: require('./attach-files.html')\n})\nHence, I went looking for an Angular webpack xi18n plugin. But by looking at the source, here:\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/%40ngtools/webpack/src/extract_i18n_plugin.ts#L172\nI get the idea that the Angular webpack xi18n plugin is just a wrapper around ng-xi18n.\nIf that is correct, then I still need a way to resolve the template paths for ng-xi18n to be able to find the templates :/ I have not sufficient webpack knowledge yet, but this is the problem i'm struggling with.. Ah, great! I was hoping that was the case. I should be able to trial and error my way through webpack and Angular xi18n then, with the help of the webpack (wrapper) plugin!. Ah, that was fast! I've failed to mention again that in my case, for reasons, we use JIT compilation. That should pose no problem, right? we just don't use the AotPlugin at all.. Great! Thanks for the help and the quick responses @ocombe !. @ocombe I'm back to trying to get this to work.\nHowever, I'm getting the following error when I try to require the Extract I18n Plugin in our webpack.config.js, like so:\nconst ExtractI18nPlugin = require('@ngtools/webpack/src/extract_i18n_plugin');\nerror:\nUncaught TypeError: ExtractI18nPlugin is not a constructor\n    at eval (eval at <anonymous> (/Users/michahell/ZIVVER/zivver-owa/webpack.config.js:10:1), <anonymous>:1:9)\n    at Object.<anonymous> (/Users/michahell/ZIVVER/zivver-owa/webpack.config.js:10:1)\n    at Module._compile (module.js:624:30)\n    at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:635:10)\n    at Module.load (module.js:545:32)\n    at tryModuleLoad (module.js:508:12)\n    at Function.Module._load (module.js:500:3)\n    at Module.require (module.js:568:17)\n    at require (internal/module.js:11:18)\n    at requireConfig (/Users/michahell/ZIVVER/zivver-owa/node_modules/webpack/bin/convert-argv.js:97:18)\n    at /Users/michahell/ZIVVER/zivver-owa/node_modules/webpack/bin/convert-argv.js:104:17\n    at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)\n    at module.exports (/Users/michahell/ZIVVER/zivver-owa/node_modules/webpack/bin/convert-argv.js:102:15)\n    at yargs.parse (/Users/michahell/ZIVVER/zivver-owa/node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js:171:41)\n    at Object.Yargs.self.parse (/Users/michahell/ZIVVER/zivver-owa/node_modules/yargs/yargs.js:533:18)\n    at Object.<anonymous> (/Users/michahell/ZIVVER/zivver-owa/node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js:152:7)\n    at Module._compile (module.js:621:14)\n    at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:635:10)\n    at Module.load (module.js:545:32)\n    at tryModuleLoad (module.js:508:12)\n    at Function.Module._load (module.js:500:3)\n    at Function.Module.runMain (module.js:665:10)\nWe know that node can find the file, as we placed a debugger; statement right below the require and when it triggered and we checked out what ExtractI18nPlugin actually contained, it contained the plugin source code..

Actually i use a single AOT prebuild app with JIT translations.

    "kara": "Can you add a line to clarify why the name attribute is required?  Specifically, it's to provide a name for the form control so it can be easily referred to in the aggregate form value and validity state.\n. Nit: 'data entry forms' is a bit odd. I think most people will know what you mean by just 'forms'. The added specificity might confuse people.. 'in code' is a bit vague because technically everything you're writing is code, including markup and templates. Perhaps 'you create a tree of Angular form control objects in the component class'?  \nI think it's also critical to differentiate between form control objects (FormControls) and form controls themselves, which are HTML elements. We should be consistent in how we refer to them.  Here, I think you mean objects.. What is an 'HTML widget'?  Perhaps 'native form control elements in the component template' would be clearer.. Can you remove the description of ngModel as a 'two-way data binding directive'? It sounds like you have to two-way bind to use ngModel. I'd just say 'using directives like ngModel'.. I think we should be careful to distinguish between the requirements of reactive form directives vs the philosophies of reactive programming. Using reactive form directives does not require you to follow all reactive principles; it merely facilitates that approach should you choose it. This paragraph makes it sound like there is only one way to manage your data. Can we change the wording of this to make it less opinionated? . I think it's important to distinguish that here we mean form control objects. Technically, you are still creating form controls.  How about:\n'You don't create Angular form control objects. Angular directives create them for you, using the information in your data bindings.'. I think this might be confusing because all reactive form directives do require property binding, which isn't in itself isn't contrary to reactive principles. I think it'd be clearer to specify bi-directional data flow, or two-way bindings. . I don't think this sentence is necessary (it sounds a bit defensive). The next sentence might be stronger on its own.. reactive form technique might be better. Calling it a 'technology' is a bit of stretch.. I agree with @DeborahK.  I feel strongly that we should omit the following import descriptions for a few reasons: \n\nIt implies these are necessary for reactive forms, which they are not\nAdds to bloat, making it harder for developers skimming to find the relevant code\nAnyone who is reading this forms guide should definitely already know what a component is, and should probably know about Inputs and Outputs. It's unnecessary for our target audience.\n. I think this is too much detail / too basic for a forms guide and should be removed. If you don't know what the selector and templateUrl are doing, this guide is probably too advanced for you.  . I think we should mention the FormGroup too. We are creating both and the FormControl is nested, so it seems odd to omit it. . I'm not sure it's clear what formGroup is from this description. Can we be explicit that it is an attribute directive that accepts a FormGroup instance? Something like:\n\n'formGroup is a reactive form directive that takes an existing FormGroup instance and associates it with an HTML element. In this case, it will associate the FormGroup we saved as heroForm with the form element.'. Here I'd be specific that it's using the formGroup and the formControlName directive.. I'm wary of calling this the form model. Why not just \"the form value\"?  We don't want people to confuse this with ngModel.. This is a bit strong. We don't want to call normal processes in the forms module \"tedious\".  I'd remove the sentence and stick with the next sentence.. Again, agree with @DeborahK. It's much clearer to add the imports as you need them and having all of them at the top is misleading.. I'd make it clear that createForm is an arbitrary wrapper method, and isn't part of the API.. a nested FormGroup ?. I'd remove this point about immutability.. Hm maybe also mention that you can also initialize with a value at instantiation?. I would elaborate on the error checking a bit, as it is the main value of using this method. If you have incorrect nesting or a typo, it will quickly and helpfully catch it.  patchValue will fail silently.. Yeah, I think leaving the router out is a good call.. As you said, it's not an introductory guide. Adding Inputs and Outputs shouldn't be a big deal. I don't think we have to provide a big explanation if we were to drop them in here.. Why not an Observable here? Promise seems a bit odd.. *clarity. Any reason you're not just using a form directive here?  :p  Think it would be thematically appropriate.. I think it might be more accurate to say a FormGroup with a single FormControl. I'm not sure it's clear how the component class is related. It almost sounds like it does these things for you.  I'd rephrase slightly to emphasize how the developer's role changes.\n'You will be creating and manipulating form control objects directly in the component class.  As the component class has immediate access to both the data model and the form control structure, here you can push data model values into the form controls and pull user-changed values back out. The component can observe changes in form control state and react to those changes. '\nI'd also mention why this change matters. \n'One advantage of working with the form control objects directly is that value and validity updates are always synchronous. This contrasts with template-driven forms, which must update asynchronously because they delegate operations to a directive running in the template.'. Can we remove the [()] from around ngModel?  Makes it seem mandatory to use two-way binding.. Hmm, I like this section,  but I think it would have more impact if we move it further down. It's pretty far from when we actually start creating FormGroups and FormControls in the example.  It might make more sense to get set up over with first, then add this section right before we instantiate our first object. \n(I actually was going to write below that we should have a description of these, then realized we did, it was just so far back I didn't recall). Also, have you considered creating a first example that is just a FormControl? That really is the smallest unit, not a form group with one control e.g.\nhtml\n<input [formControl]=\"ctrl\">\nts\nclass Something {\n  ctrl = new FormControl()\n}\nThen as we add controls, we can switch to wrap it in a parent group.. We should make the relationship between the group and the child a bit more explicit:\n'Here we are creating a FormGroup called 'heroForm' with a child FormControl called name.'\n. How about 'Nested FormGroups' ? When I first scanned this, I read the title as a noun and thought you were phrasing \"FormGroup\" in a different way.. 'throw helpful errors'. I don't know that we need to emphasize this so much. Takes away from the main intro to arrays.. FormGroupName -> formGroupName. I'd be careful about calling this 'watch' because of conflation with Angular 1 scope.watch. How about 'Observe' ? . I think we should avoid 'watch' because of scope.watch.  How about 'listenToName'  or something?. 'watch for' -> 'subscribe to'. I think we should consider leaving this section out. Demonstrating Output and component interaction isn't really the point of the forms guide, so it's adding complexity and bloat without adding enough value.  \nThat said, I like that it explains ngSubmit. We could keep that event, but the method could just be a placeholder method with a comment  (// here is where we'd post to server) should be sufficeint.  . Another reason we should leave this section out.  We are being very prescriptive on how to manage data, and reactive form directives aren't opinionated. Explaining all of this might overcomplicate the example.. You can reset to a specific value. Why not do that instead at the end? \nts\nthis.heroForm.reset({\n   name: this.hero.name\n}). Instead of !heroForm.dirty, it'd be more idiomatic to use heroForm.pristine. the validity status of the FormControl. Possible values: ... . @wardbell From half a year of triaging Github issues for forms, I can assure you it is something people struggle with. I can't tell you how many issues were filed because people didn't realize that manipulating template-driven form controls in the class was async. I feel very strongly that we should include this point. . No, that's not what I'm suggesting. I'm saying that we shouldn't tell people how to manage their data, as it's out of the scope.  . Ah, that makes sense too.  Maybe a good compromise would be to keep the section here, but when we first instantiate the form control, to include a link back to this section for reference?. I think that makes the distinction way clearer.. ^This is the misconception I'd like to clear up. Two-way binding is completely optional, and it's often overkill for simple forms. Take the following example that uses no binding:\nhtml\n<form #f=\"ngForm\">\n   <input name=\"name\" ngModel>\n   <input name=\"age\" ngModel>\n   <button type=\"button\" (click)=\"save(f.value)\">Save</button>\n</form>\nf.value will already serialize the value of the form, and you can pass it around as needed with no binding necessary. You can also one-way bind just to initialize a start value, then work with the value from the form control going forward. There are many ways to manage your data depending on the use case.. @wardbell I think that's better. . That works too. Open to either.. I think you're conflating FormGroup and formGroup, which is why I'd like to add this clarification.  FormGroup is a class that is shared between both modules. formGroup (a.k.a. FormGroupDirective) is a reactive form directive that exists only in the ReactiveFormsModule. . I'm okay with omitting the library part, but we have to be careful to stick with either selectors or class names.  FormGroup isn't a directive, it's a form control class.  So either we want:\n\nformGroup and formControlName\n\nOR\n\nFormGroupDirective and FormControlName\n\nI think the former is clearer because people don't need to know the formal name of the directive classes. . How about:\nAdd a new method that uses the FormBuilder to define the heroForm. We'll call ours createForm.. @wardbell Much better, thanks.. Perfect . @DeborahK  Have people had issues with this distinction in your courses? Okay with keeping it in if that's the case.. I can see your point there.  I'm okay with using watch in the paragraph. But what do you think about adding a quick point to clarify that \"watch\" does not mean what it did in Angular 1?. Ha. I can see that you're trying to follow best practices here, but I think it's a balance between \"doing things as you would in production\" and \"providing a digestible, minimal demo\". I think it's forgivable to have an asterisk that says \"in a real app, we'd..\" if the section isn't strictly related to the guide. To me, it's more important that people understand the forms directives we are explaining than ancillary organizational principles.. Yeah, probably not in the patchValue section. But maybe we could refactor later?  In the final version, it would be best to use reset to pass the value.. @wardbell This pattern has been in all the Angular forms talks I've done (although I've only done two). Also I don't follow the circular logic that \"it shouldn't be documented because you can't find documentation anywhere about it\".  \nAgain, I'll stress that for simple forms, such concerns are unnecessary. You don't always have complicated scenarios where you need to heavy transformations. This pattern is perfectly valid. . Hokay, I concede :). @robwormald  @StephenFluin Thoughts?. I think we still need to mention that template-driven forms are async, or this point doesn't make sense. . This section is also an important place to establish some of the benefits of choosing reactive forms (whereas the TD section should have the benefits for choosing TD forms).\nOther things to mention: ease of using reactive patterns,  ease of testing (though we won't get into an example here), ease of validation (I think we should add a simple validator somewhere).. Please remove the [()]. We should remove this sentence (it's not completely true). Can we say 'set up your project for the reactive form demo' or something similar?  What's here implies that these steps are all necessary, when some steps like creating the Hero model, etc, are demo-specific.. Can we first have an example with a simple FormControl? It's odd that we don't cover it anywhere, since it is the simplest version of the form.. I think it would be simple enough to add Validators.required somewhere in the guide to illustrate that validators are just functions that can be passed in the class (rather than validator directives, like in TD). It's an important point to make.. These should be 'VALID', 'INVALID', PENDING', and 'DISABLED'.. Might help to mention that its opposite is \"dirty\". Might help to mention that its opposite is \"touched\". Reading through this again, I think we should replace the three points above with a few sentences. The bullet points are a bit odd.\n\"It will not accept a data object that doesn't match the FormGroup structure or is missing values for any control in the group. This way, it can return helpful error messages if you have a typo or if you've nested controls incorrectly. patchValue will fail silently.\"\n. After talking over with @robwormald in person, we think this should be an observable. . Copy paste error?  Should probably not repeat \"With reactive forms\". Just start with \"You create...\". I thought we were removing this line?  Can we please remove?. I'm confused. Where is the async section we talked about?\nEdit: Oh I see it's been banished to the appendix.. I'd specify that FormGroups are common when you have multiple controls. It's just as common to have a single FormControl on its own, so \"usually\" isn't accurate without qualification.\nUsually, if you have multiple FormControls, you'll want to register them within a parent FormGRoup.. We should say something about what's going on here that mentions the formControl directive. . This is a really important point for the advantages of reactive forms and should not be hidden in an appendix. Can we please move back up to the top? . Typo: \"you don't everything is available\" => \"everything is available\". Now that we've added the formControl directive, this needs to be updated right?  At this point, we are not yet using those.. Glad we are including this, but there is no explanation of why reactive validators are simpler to use. We need to mention that in TD forms, you must wrap validators in a directive for comparison and that reactive validators are simple, composable functions. Otherwise it doesn't make sense why this is here.. Let's remove this sentence. It just repeats the sentence before it.. ",
