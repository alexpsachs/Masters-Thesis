Just out of curiosity, does it work whenrequests` is not disabled?\n. Ah, great!\n. Sure, perhaps we should include a dummy file with the project.\n. This is actually tricky though, as the request in js is relative to the location of the web page, not of the script itself.  We could parse the script tag and try to make a request against the same directory though.  This is not so easy to determine if the script has been concatenated with others.  Maybe we should just re-request the first script on the page, and trust that we'll get a 304 back.\n. Makes sense to me, provided the web server in question supports HEAD nicely.\n. @adamschwartz I'm concerned that most web servers will not be able to handle a HEAD request any more efficiently than a GET request.  Making the question: What is more efficient, rendering the current page, or the 404 page?\n. Sure\njavascript\nOffline.options = {\n  requests: false\n}\n. You can include it, just add an extra script tag for js/snake.js.  The second method you have is correct, how script tags with both src attributes and include js work varies from browser to browser, so it's best to avoid.  I'm going to make a test page with the snake game enabled just so people can get a look at it :).\n. I just fixed a bug with how snake was being initialized, so you should grab a new copy of snake.js.\n. Snake demo page: http://github.hubspot.com/offline/test/snake.html\n. Really? How odd.  Thanks for letting us know.\n. I just tested it on FF 24, looks fine to me.  Was there something specific which didn't work?\n. FYI, firefox doesn't provide an offline event, so we will only detect the browser going offline when a request fails.  If the page doesn't make any requests, it won't be detected.\n. That's not really going to help unfortunately, the init which happens in Offline.init will bind XHR, but not much else.\n. There wasn't much to do here.  PhoneGap fortunately uses the same events introduced by HTML5, so we already had compatibility.  I moved where they were bound to ensure compatibility, but I don't expect it to have changed much.  Is there anything specific you envisioned us doing with connection.type.\n. Did you actually run into this in practice?  Looking at the code, it looks to me that i should only be decremented when the handler matches.\n. Ah, I see what you were saying.  Fixed in v0.4.4.\n. I don't think that sync ajax is ever a good idea, it blocks the UI.  It is possible for the connection issue to result in very long extended hanging requests, not a situation we want to put the UI in. I think it might be a better idea to handle the failure of trying to do those actions gracefully, along with disabling them when the lack of connection has been confirmed.\n. Hmmm, interesting.  It's pretty complex to do though, as we'd have to reopen the socket after the connection is restored, and many servers are set up to do something when a connection is initiated, so it is not going to work perfectly out-of-the-box in every situation.\n. Is it a wrong assumption to assume a client is connecting when you get a client opening a connection?\nI'm happy to review a PR, if you'd like to make one @nilskp \n. Fair enough, sounds good to me.\n. I'm a little confused, the purpose of the check near line 166 is to force older browsers which don't support XMLHttpRequest2 to use onreadystatechange: https://github.com/HubSpot/offline/blob/master/js/offline.js#L171\nMeaning, it was checking specifically that it was undefined on IE9, and it was correctly avoiding a code path which wouldn't work.  Before making your change, what was happening in IE9.  Was it just not showing up?\nThe readyState is correctly 1 before sending the XHR (it's set by the browser, not jQuery).  It will then later be reset to 0 if there is a network issue.\n. IE9 does not support XMLHttpRequest2, but I believe it does support onload and onerror events on the XDomainRequest object, which is used for cross-origin requests.  In any case though, the onreadystatechange block should work.  readyState of 1 generally means that open was called, but send was not on the XMLHttpRequest object.\n. Please reopen if you still have this issue.\n. active needs to be inside the checks section.\nAlso, checking google.com is probably not going to work, as it's going to run into the CORS protections built into the browser.  You need to be checking a url on the same host and port as the page.\n. We don't actually render any strings in the js, you can override them in css alone.  My suggestion would be to attach a class to the body based on the language you would like to render, and override these css rules for each language: https://github.com/HubSpot/offline/blob/master/sass/_offline-theme-base.sass#L31.  If you'd like to PR those css files, we'd be happy to find a way to distribute them.\n. What localized formats do you need?\n. Are you able to include CSS and JS files?\n. Take a peek at issue #16 \n. Yea, it was originally not included because cache breaking in different methods might differ.  Nevertheless, jQuery does it using underscore, so it's a good idea.\n. @adamschwartz Thanks, I made the data attribute move, so as far as I can tell this works now.  There is one issue though, the width is off with the new copy, and I imagine it will be off from language to language:\n\n. Done, this is in the 0.6.0 release.\n. I just tested it in a simple angular app and I was not able to reproduce it.  Please let us know if you learn more.\n. I appreciate it, we want it to work for everybody.\n. Offline detects when your user doesn't have an internet connection, not when your server is down.  Messenger can help.\n. Offline doesn't care if your server is up or not, only if the user has an internet connection.  Wrapping your requests with messenger, as I suggested above, will allow you to easily show traditional error messages.\n. What browser?\n. @vinay-kotian Please be sure you're including both a theme and a language file: https://github.com/HubSpot/offline/tree/master/themes\n. Sure, we can check the readyState.\n. This is fixed by 09fd5421ecb2d960c7a54fe19dd6b2141e631a62\nThere still will be issues though, as offline depends on window.Offline being setup.  If you want to send a PR moving the files to UMD, I'd happily merge it.\n. I didn't know they looked at every endpoint, interesting.  From the docs:\nOffline ships with two methods for checking the connection.  One makes a request for a tiny image hosted on a\ncloudfront account for the benevolence of all, the other makes an XHR request against the current domain,\nhoping to get back any sort of response (even a 404).\nYou can change the url of the image to be one you control, if you like:\njavascript\nOffline.options = {checks: {image: {url: 'my-image.gif'}}};\nLoading an image was chosen (rather than a script file), because it limits the potential damage if a\nhostile party were to be in control of it.\nYou can also switch to the XHR method:\njavascript\nOffline.options = {checks: {active: 'xhr'}}\nThe XHR method is not enabled by default because of a concern that some sites do a significant amount of\nprocessing to build their 404 page, so it's not something we want to send unnecessarily.

You can set the endpoint in settings as well:\njavascript\nOffline.options = {checks: {xhr: {url: '/health-check'}}};\n. This should be fixed in 0.4.6, please reopen if it persists.\n. Should be fixed in 0.4.6, thanks @underbyte \n. That was, in fact, the case; just released v0.4.5.  Thanks @beardfu.\n. I ended up shifting it to only initialize on 'complete', hopefully that will have the same effect.  Thanks @matthargett and @cjk, sorry it took us so long to make the change.\n55c8c84\n. Thanks for letting us know.  Is there some easy way we can see this happening?\n. Yep, I was also interested in fixing this.  I was actually able to fix it just in CSS, which is cool: 8dffa1c\n. Just FYI, this change was made in offline itself (https://github.com/HubSpot/offline/commit/8dffa1c), the message now shows for a full five seconds, you don't need to manually change anything if you upgrade to 0.4.7.\n. We intentionally only hang onto the last request with a given (url, method), as the assumption is that a GET against a given endpoint will always return the same thing, and if you're making multiple POSTs, you only really want the last one to count.  I suppose there is a use case for all of the POSTs being replayed (particularly if the application uses PUT correctly).\n. localhost is going to resolve whether you have an internet connection or not.  It should work when it's actually hosted over the network.\n. Everything is modular, if you include offline.js and requests.js without ui.js, you won't get a UI.  If you take a peek at ui.js you should be able to get an idea of what events the UI listens to. Files: https://github.com/HubSpot/offline/tree/master/js\n. We don't actually support IE6 (IE8+ only), so that itself is not an issue.  Trying to load the file locally (and therefore getting the file:// protocol) is a good reason to use the method you have here.\n. This is no longer a factor, as we've changed how we do the actual connection testing.  Thanks for your help @JoeWagner.\n. Interesting.  Any idea which loop/array is causing the problem @leonzinger?\n. querySelector does exist in IE 8 (http://caniuse.com/queryselector), so this must be an issue with el not being what it should be.\n. I would always recommend including the appropriate meta tag to keep the browser out of Quirks mode.  It's designed to keep IE compatible with old websites, not for use with ones under active development.\n. Thanks!\n. I don't believe Safari has support for the offline events, meaning Offline will only show up when you try to make an XHR request and fail.  No request, no offline unfortunately. \n. Done in https://github.com/HubSpot/offline/commit/b30eccbb46078f28300224fb4591b4b9eb027a62. Based on our testing it seemed that the access denied response would be considered 'up'. Do you happen to know which version of offline you are using?\n. Just restored the file until we can get to the bottom of why the library is not responding in the way we expected. \n. Should be all set now.\n. FYI: This file is being removed at the end of March.  Please update to offline 0.7.0+ if you haven't already.\n. v0.7.0 now uses your favicon as the test image, assuming you have a /favicon.ico, you should see no problems.\n. Fixed, thanks.\n. Thanks for reporting @sgringwe, we're looking into the issues now. \n.

If you update to the latest version, we now actually check the /favicon.ico, which most sites should have.\n. The short answer is that should work.  Are you sure you are setting options early enough in the loading process (e.g. it's not in a callback or anything).\n. I think I see the problem then.  You're waiting until domReady to set the options.  If an XHR request fails before domReady however, offline will run the check before you have a chance to set the options.  Try:\n\nhtml\n<html>\n<style>stuff</style>\n<script>custom library</script>\n<script>offline.min.js</script>\n<script>\nOffline.options = { ... }\nrequire([\"x\",\"y\",\"domReady!\"],function(x,y){\n     Offline.check();\n})\n</script>\n. Hey @craigshoemaker.  I like the idea, but I'm not sure that having a UI for it is really required, and having to add and remove the script to get the functionality means that I'm afraid the vast majority of developers will never even realize that it's in the repo or what it's for.  This is my alternative: https://github.com/HubSpot/offline/blob/zbloom-simulator/coffee/offline.simulator.coffee\nIt doesn't allow you to toggle, but it does add the data attribute support, the ability to use a local storage var, and it adds two new checks up and down, which will always report being up and down respectively. \n. If you publish the UI in a separate repo, I'd be happy to link to it in the docs.\n. Thanks @craigshoemaker.  Two questions:\n- I don't actually see the checkbox on that page, am I missing it?\n- What is the form in the demo for?\nYou might also want to link to the github page for your project from the landing page.\n.

Do you see it if you disconnect your internet on the demo page: http://github.hubspot.com/offline/docs/welcome/\nThat page uses the offline.min.js file in master.\n. Just to confirm @andygup, even when you make an XHR request and that request fails (while you're offline), you still don't see it?\n. I just confirmed that Offline.state has the correct values.  If you notice anything which seems to be more specifically wrong, please let us know.\n. I can double check this, but I believe that not all browsers support the\noffline events.  On those browsers, you have to try to make an AJAX request\n(which fails), before we know you're offline.\n\nZack Bloom\nOn Tue, Apr 8, 2014 at 4:35 PM, Chris Ross notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nCurrently in Firefox (version 28 also tried in version 27.01) the offline\nstatus doesn't update to show when the browser goes offline.

If it supports the events, we certainly should be picking them up, I'll look into it further.\n. I just confirmed that the offline event does not fire in firefox when the system's internet connection is disconnected.  I believe that event only fires when the user explicitly puts their browser in 'offline mode'.  With that in mind, Offline is only going to notice the loss of connection when you try to make an XHR request and it fails, or if you explicitly call Offline.check().\n\n@blackblood Do you see the issue on our landing page?\n. @eladxxx FYI, each component is modular, so you can just include the contents of the offline.coffee file without the reconnection, request retrying, ui or game.\n. Muchos gracis @macool\n. Do you happen to have a link to that page?  It shouldn't be checking after successful requests.\n. Thanks for writing this up, but putting it at the maximum allowed value prevents anyone from ever being able to override it, which, is not very nice to other people making weird and wonderful things.  If you'd like to choose a value greater than bootstrap (2000?), I'd be happy to merge.\n. Closed by 043fe58\n. Sorry for the delay in responding to this.  Firefox does not fire the offline and online events in the way that other browsers do.  You can test this by running this Fiddle with your console open and disconnecting your internet connection: http://jsfiddle.net/L507acnc/\nIn Firefox, we get no events, in Chrome, we get the events we need.  This means the only way of detecting actual network status in FF is for an actual HTTP request to fail.  On the Offline homepage, there are no requests, so this never happens.  You can manually run a check though by executing Offline.check() in the console, and you will see it correctly update.\nIf offline detection is very important to you, but you never make any requests (an odd combo), you could run Offline.check periodically:\njavascript\nsetInterval(function(){\n  Offline.check();\n}, 5000);\n. Re the IE11 issue, please open another issue if it's reproducible.  Status 0 often means the browser couldn't make a connection for an internal reason, it's possible your network connection was not truly 'up' yet.\n. Sebastian, have you tried the fiddle I included in my response? If you see a technical difference between my example in that fiddle and what the MDN article instructs, please enumerate it. Does the fiddle work for you?\n. It does not work for me on Firefox 36 / OSX.  If the fiddle doesn't work for you, I would love to hear what you see as the difference between what we're doing in the fiddle, and what Mozilla is doing in their example.  In any case, neither seems to work on OSX, making it difficult for me to examine.\n. Thanks for working with me on this.  If you're interested, you can see it not working for me: https://vimeo.com/122614412.  It may take the video a bit to upload.\nI am using OS X 10.10 and Firefox 36.0.1.  Without being able to see the mozilla page work, it's difficult for me to understand what is going on.\n. Ah, I understand what you're saying.  This was never the intended functionality of Offline.  The biggest reason for this is A. It is unclear how many users actually know how to do this, as so few modern websites support it and B. Offline's method for retrying requests is probably too simplistic for an app which is intended to be used offline for an extended period.\n. There isn't an explicit build.  As Adam said though, you can just include\nwhichever files you are interested in the functionality of, and all the\nrest will work.\n\nZack Bloom\nOn Tue, Jul 22, 2014 at 2:37 PM, Adam Schwartz notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nIn that event, I believe you can include only\nhttps://github.com/HubSpot/offline/blob/master/coffee/offline.coffee and\nthat will do the trick. @zackbloom https://github.com/zackbloom did we\never create a UI-less build for this?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/HubSpot/offline/issues/88#issuecomment-49781757.\n.

Your original error handler should run, as it would if the request errored immediately.\n. Thanks @brettjonesdev \n. interceptRequests specifically disables trying to remake requests when the connection is reestablished.  You also must switch to a different check style (other than xhr) to disable all XHR checking.  For example:\n\njavascript\nOffline.options.checks.active = 'image'\n. I really don't think this is in-scope.  If you really want to you can certainly try triggering the 'down' event:\njavascript\nOffline.trigger('down')\nThat's really what the UI is listening to: https://github.com/HubSpot/offline/blob/master/coffee/ui.coffee#L79\n. In general, making requests with async: false is not really ever appropriate.  async: false blocks all javascript execution in the browser while the request is ongoing, making something like Offline impossible.  I can't speak to what will or won't work in Offline if you do this.\n. In general, every service which uses the underlying XMLHttpRequest (the only way to make AJAX requests), should be supported.  The one exception to this is if the service-in-question is brought into the page before Offline, and makes a references to XMLHttpRequest before we get a chance to alias it.  Any other failure should be considered a bug.\n. The on function is implemented in Offline, it is unrelated to the browser's API.  onload is bad because you can only bind one function that way, this is obviously not the case with our implementation.\n. Is binding to the confirmed-up event not an option? https://github.com/HubSpot/offline#properties\n. It seems like you could bind to both confirmed-up and confirmed-down, and then remove the bindings once one of the two is called.  How would that be different than a promise?\n. I'm thinking something along the lines of:\n``` javascript\nvar initialCheck = function(cb){\n  var upFunc = function(){\n    cb(true);\n    unbind();\n  }\n  var downFunc = function(){\n    cb(false);\n    unbind();\n  }\n  var unbind = function(){\n    Offline.off('confirmed-up', upFunc);\n    Offline.off('confirmed-down', downFunc);\n  }\nOffline.on('confirmed-up', upFunc);\n  Offline.on('confirmed-down', downFunc);\nOffline.check();\n}\n```\n. These are the files Eager includes: https://github.com/HubSpot/offline/blob/master/install.json#L5-L26\nPerhaps you're missing a theme or language file?\n. You could also write out the CSS you need using JavaScript.  For example:\njavascript\nvar style = document.createElement('style');\nstyle.innerHTML = \".offline-ui.offline-ui-up .offline-ui-content:before { content: '\"+gettext('Connected')+\"'; }\"\ndocument.head.appendChild(style);\nUltimately the style block you construct would need to include all of these translations: https://github.com/HubSpot/offline/blob/master/themes/offline-language-english.css\n. The easiest way would probably be to try to make a request to your service, and then also try to make a connection to a neutral site like example.com.  If both fail, it's the client's internet connection, if example.com succeeds it's you.\n. You can connect to a URL with permissive CORS settings (Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *) or download an image or script from any domain (not restricted by CORS).  Another option would be to host a blank file on Amazon S3+CloudFront for this purpose, where you can control the CORS headers.\n. Any status code (other than 12xxx which is specific to old-IE) means the user's internet connection is working, and they are 'online'.  Offline is not intended to handle cases when your service is down, as, as you mention, it varies too much from one backend to another.\n. I understand what you're saying, but philosophically, I think it's probably a better idea to handle your service failing by handling the failure case of the individual requests you are making.  Take a look at Messenger for an example of what that looks like.  In most systems, it's very possible for your service to be degraded, but not universally down, making something like this challenging to do globally.\nThere is also a use-case for putting your service in a 'maintenance mode', but similarly, it's just not something which this library tries to support.\n. Done, sorry for the delay!\n. This is intentional.  Offline is meant to show the user when they are offline, not when the web service is offline.  To show an offline state when your server 502s, we recommend you bind to the AJAX error event of your requests.\n. In general this is the intended behavior.  Offline only forwards one request per URL.  There is an option though which will have it also consider the body of the request: https://github.com/HubSpot/offline/blob/master/coffee/requests.coffee#L42\n. Good point.  Each way of determining connectedness has its pluses and minuses, no one way is perfect.  Offline ships with two methods.  One makes a request for a tiny image hosted on my cloudfront account for the benevolence of all, the other makes an XHR request against the current domain, hoping to get back any sort of response (even a 404).\nYou can change the url of the image to be one you control, if you like:\njavascript\nOffline.options = {checks: {image: {url: 'my-image.gif'}}};\nLoading an image was chosen (rather than a script file), because it limits the potential damage if a hostile party were to be in control of it.\nYou can also switch to the XHR method:\njavascript\nOffline.options = {checks: {active: 'xhr'}}\nThe XHR method is not enabled by default because of a concern that some sites do a significant amount of processing to build their 404 page, so it's not something we want to send unnecessarily.  It's also possible that the page would respond with a redirect to a different domain, creating a CORS problem.  If you have control of the domain and can create an endpoint which just responds with a quick 204, that's the perfect solution.  You can set the endpoint in settings as well:\njavascript\nOffline.options = {checks: {xhr: {url: '/health-check'}}};\nTomorrow I'll move most of this over to the README proper.\n. You'll also need to tell it to use the xhr check:\njavascript\nOffline.options = {\n  checks: {\n    xhr: {\n      url: '/health-check'\n    },\n    active: 'xhr'\n  }\n};\n. @squallstar Thanks for letting me know, fixed in v0.4.3.\n. @sifarat \n``` javascript\n\n    Offline.options = {\n        checks: {\n            image: {url: '../img/test.gif'},\n            active: 'image'\n        },</p>\n<pre><code>    requests: false\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p> \n``\n. Just out of curiosity, does it work whenrequests` is not disabled?\n. Ah, great!\n. Sure, perhaps we should include a dummy file with the project.\n. This is actually tricky though, as the request in js is relative to the location of the web page, not of the script itself.  We could parse the script tag and try to make a request against the same directory though.  This is not so easy to determine if the script has been concatenated with others.  Maybe we should just re-request the first script on the page, and trust that we'll get a 304 back.\n. Makes sense to me, provided the web server in question supports HEAD nicely.\n. @adamschwartz I'm concerned that most web servers will not be able to handle a HEAD request any more efficiently than a GET request.  Making the question: What is more efficient, rendering the current page, or the 404 page?\n. Sure\njavascript\nOffline.options = {\n  requests: false\n}\n. You can include it, just add an extra script tag for js/snake.js.  The second method you have is correct, how script tags with both src attributes and include js work varies from browser to browser, so it's best to avoid.  I'm going to make a test page with the snake game enabled just so people can get a look at it :).\n. I just fixed a bug with how snake was being initialized, so you should grab a new copy of snake.js.\n. Snake demo page: http://github.hubspot.com/offline/test/snake.html\n. Really? How odd.  Thanks for letting us know.\n. I just tested it on FF 24, looks fine to me.  Was there something specific which didn't work?\n. FYI, firefox doesn't provide an offline event, so we will only detect the browser going offline when a request fails.  If the page doesn't make any requests, it won't be detected.\n. That's not really going to help unfortunately, the init which happens in Offline.init will bind XHR, but not much else.\n. There wasn't much to do here.  PhoneGap fortunately uses the same events introduced by HTML5, so we already had compatibility.  I moved where they were bound to ensure compatibility, but I don't expect it to have changed much.  Is there anything specific you envisioned us doing with connection.type.\n. Did you actually run into this in practice?  Looking at the code, it looks to me that i should only be decremented when the handler matches.\n. Ah, I see what you were saying.  Fixed in v0.4.4.\n. I don't think that sync ajax is ever a good idea, it blocks the UI.  It is possible for the connection issue to result in very long extended hanging requests, not a situation we want to put the UI in. I think it might be a better idea to handle the failure of trying to do those actions gracefully, along with disabling them when the lack of connection has been confirmed.\n. Hmmm, interesting.  It's pretty complex to do though, as we'd have to reopen the socket after the connection is restored, and many servers are set up to do something when a connection is initiated, so it is not going to work perfectly out-of-the-box in every situation.\n. Is it a wrong assumption to assume a client is connecting when you get a client opening a connection?\nI'm happy to review a PR, if you'd like to make one @nilskp \n. Fair enough, sounds good to me.\n. I'm a little confused, the purpose of the check near line 166 is to force older browsers which don't support XMLHttpRequest2 to use onreadystatechange: https://github.com/HubSpot/offline/blob/master/js/offline.js#L171\nMeaning, it was checking specifically that it was undefined on IE9, and it was correctly avoiding a code path which wouldn't work.  Before making your change, what was happening in IE9.  Was it just not showing up?\nThe readyState is correctly 1 before sending the XHR (it's set by the browser, not jQuery).  It will then later be reset to 0 if there is a network issue.\n. IE9 does not support XMLHttpRequest2, but I believe it does support onload and onerror events on the XDomainRequest object, which is used for cross-origin requests.  In any case though, the onreadystatechange block should work.  readyState of 1 generally means that open was called, but send was not on the XMLHttpRequest object.\n. Please reopen if you still have this issue.\n. active needs to be inside the checks section.\nAlso, checking google.com is probably not going to work, as it's going to run into the CORS protections built into the browser.  You need to be checking a url on the same host and port as the page.\n. We don't actually render any strings in the js, you can override them in css alone.  My suggestion would be to attach a class to the body based on the language you would like to render, and override these css rules for each language: https://github.com/HubSpot/offline/blob/master/sass/_offline-theme-base.sass#L31.  If you'd like to PR those css files, we'd be happy to find a way to distribute them.\n. What localized formats do you need?\n. Are you able to include CSS and JS files?\n. Take a peek at issue #16 \n. Yea, it was originally not included because cache breaking in different methods might differ.  Nevertheless, jQuery does it using underscore, so it's a good idea.\n. @adamschwartz Thanks, I made the data attribute move, so as far as I can tell this works now.  There is one issue though, the width is off with the new copy, and I imagine it will be off from language to language:\n\n. Done, this is in the 0.6.0 release.\n. I just tested it in a simple angular app and I was not able to reproduce it.  Please let us know if you learn more.\n. I appreciate it, we want it to work for everybody.\n. Offline detects when your user doesn't have an internet connection, not when your server is down.  Messenger can help.\n. Offline doesn't care if your server is up or not, only if the user has an internet connection.  Wrapping your requests with messenger, as I suggested above, will allow you to easily show traditional error messages.\n. What browser?\n. @vinay-kotian Please be sure you're including both a theme and a language file: https://github.com/HubSpot/offline/tree/master/themes\n. Sure, we can check the readyState.\n. This is fixed by 09fd5421ecb2d960c7a54fe19dd6b2141e631a62\nThere still will be issues though, as offline depends on window.Offline being setup.  If you want to send a PR moving the files to UMD, I'd happily merge it.\n. I didn't know they looked at every endpoint, interesting.  From the docs:\nOffline ships with two methods for checking the connection.  One makes a request for a tiny image hosted on a\ncloudfront account for the benevolence of all, the other makes an XHR request against the current domain,\nhoping to get back any sort of response (even a 404).\nYou can change the url of the image to be one you control, if you like:\njavascript\nOffline.options = {checks: {image: {url: 'my-image.gif'}}};\nLoading an image was chosen (rather than a script file), because it limits the potential damage if a\nhostile party were to be in control of it.\nYou can also switch to the XHR method:\njavascript\nOffline.options = {checks: {active: 'xhr'}}\nThe XHR method is not enabled by default because of a concern that some sites do a significant amount of\nprocessing to build their 404 page, so it's not something we want to send unnecessarily.  It's also\npossible that the page would respond with a redirect to a different domain, creating a CORS problem.\nIf you have control of the domain and can create an endpoint which just responds with a quick 204,\nthat's the perfect solution.  You can set the endpoint in settings as well:\njavascript\nOffline.options = {checks: {xhr: {url: '/health-check'}}};\n. This should be fixed in 0.4.6, please reopen if it persists.\n. Should be fixed in 0.4.6, thanks @underbyte \n. That was, in fact, the case; just released v0.4.5.  Thanks @beardfu.\n. I ended up shifting it to only initialize on 'complete', hopefully that will have the same effect.  Thanks @matthargett and @cjk, sorry it took us so long to make the change.\n55c8c84\n. Thanks for letting us know.  Is there some easy way we can see this happening?\n. Yep, I was also interested in fixing this.  I was actually able to fix it just in CSS, which is cool: 8dffa1c\n. Just FYI, this change was made in offline itself (https://github.com/HubSpot/offline/commit/8dffa1c), the message now shows for a full five seconds, you don't need to manually change anything if you upgrade to 0.4.7.\n. We intentionally only hang onto the last request with a given (url, method), as the assumption is that a GET against a given endpoint will always return the same thing, and if you're making multiple POSTs, you only really want the last one to count.  I suppose there is a use case for all of the POSTs being replayed (particularly if the application uses PUT correctly).\n. localhost is going to resolve whether you have an internet connection or not.  It should work when it's actually hosted over the network.\n. Everything is modular, if you include offline.js and requests.js without ui.js, you won't get a UI.  If you take a peek at ui.js you should be able to get an idea of what events the UI listens to. Files: https://github.com/HubSpot/offline/tree/master/js\n. We don't actually support IE6 (IE8+ only), so that itself is not an issue.  Trying to load the file locally (and therefore getting the file:// protocol) is a good reason to use the method you have here.\n. This is no longer a factor, as we've changed how we do the actual connection testing.  Thanks for your help @JoeWagner.\n. Interesting.  Any idea which loop/array is causing the problem @leonzinger?\n. querySelector does exist in IE 8 (http://caniuse.com/queryselector), so this must be an issue with el not being what it should be.\n. I would always recommend including the appropriate meta tag to keep the browser out of Quirks mode.  It's designed to keep IE compatible with old websites, not for use with ones under active development.\n. Thanks!\n. I don't believe Safari has support for the offline events, meaning Offline will only show up when you try to make an XHR request and fail.  No request, no offline unfortunately. \n. Done in https://github.com/HubSpot/offline/commit/b30eccbb46078f28300224fb4591b4b9eb027a62. Based on our testing it seemed that the access denied response would be considered 'up'. Do you happen to know which version of offline you are using?\n. Just restored the file until we can get to the bottom of why the library is not responding in the way we expected. \n. Should be all set now.\n. FYI: This file is being removed at the end of March.  Please update to offline 0.7.0+ if you haven't already.\n. v0.7.0 now uses your favicon as the test image, assuming you have a /favicon.ico, you should see no problems.\n. Fixed, thanks.\n. Thanks for reporting @sgringwe, we're looking into the issues now. \n.

If you update to the latest version, we now actually check the /favicon.ico, which most sites should have.\n. The short answer is that should work.  Are you sure you are setting options early enough in the loading process (e.g. it's not in a callback or anything).\n. I think I see the problem then.  You're waiting until domReady to set the options.  If an XHR request fails before domReady however, offline will run the check before you have a chance to set the options.  Try:\n\nhtml\n<html>\n<style>stuff</style>\n<script>custom library</script>\n<script>offline.min.js</script>\n<script>\nOffline.options = { ... }\nrequire([\"x\",\"y\",\"domReady!\"],function(x,y){\n     Offline.check();\n})\n</script>\n. Hey @craigshoemaker.  I like the idea, but I'm not sure that having a UI for it is really required, and having to add and remove the script to get the functionality means that I'm afraid the vast majority of developers will never even realize that it's in the repo or what it's for.  This is my alternative: https://github.com/HubSpot/offline/blob/zbloom-simulator/coffee/offline.simulator.coffee\nIt doesn't allow you to toggle, but it does add the data attribute support, the ability to use a local storage var, and it adds two new checks up and down, which will always report being up and down respectively. \n. If you publish the UI in a separate repo, I'd be happy to link to it in the docs.\n. Thanks @craigshoemaker.  Two questions:\n- I don't actually see the checkbox on that page, am I missing it?\n- What is the form in the demo for?\nYou might also want to link to the github page for your project from the landing page.\n.

Just to confirm @andygup, even when you make an XHR request and that request fails (while you're offline), you still don't see it?\n. I just confirmed that Offline.state has the correct values.  If you notice anything which seems to be more specifically wrong, please let us know.\n. I can double check this, but I believe that not all browsers support the\noffline events.  On those browsers, you have to try to make an AJAX request\n(which fails), before we know you're offline.\n\nZack Bloom\nOn Tue, Apr 8, 2014 at 4:35 PM, Chris Ross notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nCurrently in Firefox (version 28 also tried in version 27.01) the offline\nstatus doesn't update to show when the browser goes offline.

I just confirmed that the offline event does not fire in firefox when the system's internet connection is disconnected.  I believe that event only fires when the user explicitly puts their browser in 'offline mode'.  With that in mind, Offline is only going to notice the loss of connection when you try to make an XHR request and it fails, or if you explicitly call Offline.check().\n\n@blackblood Do you see the issue on our landing page?\n. @eladxxx FYI, each component is modular, so you can just include the contents of the offline.coffee file without the reconnection, request retrying, ui or game.\n. Muchos gracis @macool\n. Do you happen to have a link to that page?  It shouldn't be checking after successful requests.\n. Thanks for writing this up, but putting it at the maximum allowed value prevents anyone from ever being able to override it, which, is not very nice to other people making weird and wonderful things.  If you'd like to choose a value greater than bootstrap (2000?), I'd be happy to merge.\n. Closed by 043fe58\n. Sorry for the delay in responding to this.  Firefox does not fire the offline and online events in the way that other browsers do.  You can test this by running this Fiddle with your console open and disconnecting your internet connection: http://jsfiddle.net/L507acnc/\nIn Firefox, we get no events, in Chrome, we get the events we need.  This means the only way of detecting actual network status in FF is for an actual HTTP request to fail.  On the Offline homepage, there are no requests, so this never happens.  You can manually run a check though by executing Offline.check() in the console, and you will see it correctly update.\nIf offline detection is very important to you, but you never make any requests (an odd combo), you could run Offline.check periodically:\njavascript\nsetInterval(function(){\n  Offline.check();\n}, 5000);\n. Re the IE11 issue, please open another issue if it's reproducible.  Status 0 often means the browser couldn't make a connection for an internal reason, it's possible your network connection was not truly 'up' yet.\n. Sebastian, have you tried the fiddle I included in my response? If you see a technical difference between my example in that fiddle and what the MDN article instructs, please enumerate it. Does the fiddle work for you?\n. It does not work for me on Firefox 36 / OSX.  If the fiddle doesn't work for you, I would love to hear what you see as the difference between what we're doing in the fiddle, and what Mozilla is doing in their example.  In any case, neither seems to work on OSX, making it difficult for me to examine.\n. Thanks for working with me on this.  If you're interested, you can see it not working for me: https://vimeo.com/122614412.  It may take the video a bit to upload.\nI am using OS X 10.10 and Firefox 36.0.1.  Without being able to see the mozilla page work, it's difficult for me to understand what is going on.\n. Ah, I understand what you're saying.  This was never the intended functionality of Offline.  The biggest reason for this is A. It is unclear how many users actually know how to do this, as so few modern websites support it and B. Offline's method for retrying requests is probably too simplistic for an app which is intended to be used offline for an extended period.\n. There isn't an explicit build.  As Adam said though, you can just include\nwhichever files you are interested in the functionality of, and all the\nrest will work.\n\nZack Bloom\nOn Tue, Jul 22, 2014 at 2:37 PM, Adam Schwartz notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nIn that event, I believe you can include only\nhttps://github.com/HubSpot/offline/blob/master/coffee/offline.coffee and\nthat will do the trick. @zackbloom https://github.com/zackbloom did we\never create a UI-less build for this?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/HubSpot/offline/issues/88#issuecomment-49781757.\n.

Your original error handler should run, as it would if the request errored immediately.\n. Thanks @brettjonesdev \n. interceptRequests specifically disables trying to remake requests when the connection is reestablished.  You also must switch to a different check style (other than xhr) to disable all XHR checking.  For example:\n\njavascript\nOffline.options.checks.active = 'image'\n. I really don't think this is in-scope.  If you really want to you can certainly try triggering the 'down' event:\njavascript\nOffline.trigger('down')\nThat's really what the UI is listening to: https://github.com/HubSpot/offline/blob/master/coffee/ui.coffee#L79\n. In general, making requests with async: false is not really ever appropriate.  async: false blocks all javascript execution in the browser while the request is ongoing, making something like Offline impossible.  I can't speak to what will or won't work in Offline if you do this.\n. In general, every service which uses the underlying XMLHttpRequest (the only way to make AJAX requests), should be supported.  The one exception to this is if the service-in-question is brought into the page before Offline, and makes a references to XMLHttpRequest before we get a chance to alias it.  Any other failure should be considered a bug.\n. The on function is implemented in Offline, it is unrelated to the browser's API.  onload is bad because you can only bind one function that way, this is obviously not the case with our implementation.\n. Is binding to the confirmed-up event not an option? https://github.com/HubSpot/offline#properties\n. It seems like you could bind to both confirmed-up and confirmed-down, and then remove the bindings once one of the two is called.  How would that be different than a promise?\n. I'm thinking something along the lines of:\n``` javascript\nvar initialCheck = function(cb){\n  var upFunc = function(){\n    cb(true);\n    unbind();\n  }\n  var downFunc = function(){\n    cb(false);\n    unbind();\n  }\n  var unbind = function(){\n    Offline.off('confirmed-up', upFunc);\n    Offline.off('confirmed-down', downFunc);\n  }\nOffline.on('confirmed-up', upFunc);\n  Offline.on('confirmed-down', downFunc);\nOffline.check();\n}\n```\n. These are the files Eager includes: https://github.com/HubSpot/offline/blob/master/install.json#L5-L26\nPerhaps you're missing a theme or language file?\n. You could also write out the CSS you need using JavaScript.  For example:\njavascript\nvar style = document.createElement('style');\nstyle.innerHTML = \".offline-ui.offline-ui-up .offline-ui-content:before { content: '\"+gettext('Connected')+\"'; }\"\ndocument.head.appendChild(style);\nUltimately the style block you construct would need to include all of these translations: https://github.com/HubSpot/offline/blob/master/themes/offline-language-english.css\n. The easiest way would probably be to try to make a request to your service, and then also try to make a connection to a neutral site like example.com.  If both fail, it's the client's internet connection, if example.com succeeds it's you.\n. You can connect to a URL with permissive CORS settings (Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *) or download an image or script from any domain (not restricted by CORS).  Another option would be to host a blank file on Amazon S3+CloudFront for this purpose, where you can control the CORS headers.\n. Any status code (other than 12xxx which is specific to old-IE) means the user's internet connection is working, and they are 'online'.  Offline is not intended to handle cases when your service is down, as, as you mention, it varies too much from one backend to another.\n. I understand what you're saying, but philosophically, I think it's probably a better idea to handle your service failing by handling the failure case of the individual requests you are making.  Take a look at Messenger for an example of what that looks like.  In most systems, it's very possible for your service to be degraded, but not universally down, making something like this challenging to do globally.\nThere is also a use-case for putting your service in a 'maintenance mode', but similarly, it's just not something which this library tries to support.\n. Done, sorry for the delay!\n. This is intentional.  Offline is meant to show the user when they are offline, not when the web service is offline.  To show an offline state when your server 502s, we recommend you bind to the AJAX error event of your requests.\n. In general this is the intended behavior.  Offline only forwards one request per URL.  There is an option though which will have it also consider the body of the request: https://github.com/HubSpot/offline/blob/master/coffee/requests.coffee#L42\n. ",

Basically, you need to augment your .offline-ui-down selector with .offline-ui-down-5s.\nSo if before you had this:\n``` css\n.offline-ui.offline-ui-down .offline-ui-content:before {\n  content: \"Your computer lost its internet connection. \";\n}\n@media (max-width: 1024px) {\n  .offline-ui.offline-ui-down .offline-ui-content:before {\n    content: \"Your device lost its internet connection. \";\n  }\n}\n@media (max-width: 568px) {\n  .offline-ui.offline-ui-down .offline-ui-content:before {\n    content: \"Your device isn't connected. \";\n  }\n}\n```\nNow you should have this:\n``` css\n.offline-ui.offline-ui-down.offline-ui-down-5s .offline-ui-content:before {\n  content: \"Your computer lost its internet connection. \";\n}\n@media (max-width: 1024px) {\n  .offline-ui.offline-ui-down.offline-ui-down-5s .offline-ui-content:before {\n    content: \"Your device lost its internet connection. \";\n  }\n}\n@media (max-width: 568px) {\n  .offline-ui.offline-ui-down.offline-ui-down-5s .offline-ui-content:before {\n    content: \"Your device isn't connected. \";\n  }\n}\n```\nAdditionally, you'll want to hide the retry button when in .offline-ui-waiting.\ncss\n.offline-ui.offline-ui-down.offline-ui-down-5s.offline-ui-waiting .offline-ui-retry {\n  display: none;\n}\n. @zackbloom can correct me if I'm wrong, but as long as the requests being made are succeeding, it doesn't matter whether they're internet or intranet resources. The catch here is that the default check URL is a resource on the internet. So if intranet resources are loading but the check URL isn't, I believe we'll report you as offline. So if you desire the behavior that an intranet-only connection appears as online, you'll want to configure the check url to be a resource on your intranet.\n. Hey @phani26, thanks for the report. Which Internet Explorer version?\n[Update: my mistake, seeing \"IE8\" in the title now.]\n. I just fixed https://github.com/HubSpot/offline/issues/50 which at least solves:\n\n\nNo text message\nNo retry button\n\n\nLooking into FF now.\n. Sorry for the delay. It works in FF but since the docs don't make any requests after the initial page load, the indicator won't show up (which is the correct behavior).\n. It seems slightly unintuitive (and possibly even confusing) to me to use the indicator as the switch (since it's original purpose was read-only), but otherwise, this looks great to me. Thanks for the script! @zackbloom thoughts?\n. Sounds great!\n(And yes, interoperability with all of the themes\u2014including the indicator themes\u2014would be ideal ;)\n. @craigshoemaker that looks awesome! Thanks for putting this together.\n@zackbloom\n- The checkbox is on the left edge of the page.\n- When you check the checkbox, the form switches to a message stating you must have internet connectivity to sign in.\n. :+1: \n. Awesome!!!\n. Something like this should work:\nOffline.on('down', function(){\n    // Open Bootstrap 3 modal\n});\nHope this helps!\n. This ought to do the trick!\n``` coffeescript\nreloadIfUp = ->\n    location.reload(true) if Offline.state is 'up'\nsetTimeout ->\n    reloadIfUp()\n    setInterval reloadIfUp, 10 * 1000\n, 45 * 1000\n```\n. Thanks so much! This will be a great addition.\nWould you mind doing this in a _german.sass file similar to the way the _french.sass file was written?\n. Absolutely! Thanks :smile: \n. In that event, I believe you can include only https://github.com/HubSpot/offline/blob/master/coffee/offline.coffee and that will do the trick. @zackbloom did we ever create a UI-less build for this?\n. Offline.js provides an indication of network connectivity for the client, not the server.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks @barryvdh!\n. Hey @cutesquirrel, thanks for letting us know. We\u2019ll take a look.\n. One option is you can use JS to conditionally load the appropriate language CSS file.\n. Thanks for sharing @dannycallaghan! That will be helpful for others looking to integrate with Angular. I agree. :)\n. @ymatuhin @geekjuice I think we\u2019ll want to move the padding stuff into a separate file which gets imported into https://github.com/ymatuhin/offline/blob/master/sass/offline-language-russian.sass rather than have the default widths change. Otherwise looks great though, thanks.\n. Thanks @mamadoo. Would you possibly be able to add a language file for all of the content strings? \nHere\u2019s French, e.g.: https://github.com/HubSpot/offline/blob/master/sass/_french.sass\n. Thanks!\n. :+1: \n. yes, please. that would be great, thanks.\n. Thanks!!! :+1: \n. How about requesting \"/\", like offline-events.js shim does?\n. @zackbloom perhaps we could simply expose Offline.init so that it can be initialized manually. @adisuryadi that would have solved your issue, correct?\n. @zackbloom @adisuryadi should we make that the default bower.json configuration?\n. lgtm\n. :boom: \n. Thanks!\n. @Alex-Sokolov to localize \"seconds\", set the respective $retryingSecondAfterValue... sass variable and so on for minutes and hours.\n. @zackbloom OK, should be all set on my end. (Or at least enough for now.)\n. I'll take a look next week.\n. @saadmalik, thanks for submitting this theme!\nAt a quick glance, it looks pretty similar to the Default theme.\nHow do you see it being used? Do you think it might just be better to make these changes to that theme?\n. @saadmalik We switched blues to greens so that the default and slide themes work with the default colors in bootstrap (and for the consistency with the use of green in the dark themes). However, we've decided to keep the current red and yellow since they're added saturation should help draw the eye during a connectivity issue. Thanks again for the PR!\n. At the time of this writing, v0.4.4 is the latest release. While there may be bugs in any given release, we recommend people use the release builds because they move towards stable, whereas you can't be sure that master doesn't contain incremental fixes which temporarily make this worse. (Keep in mind we still haven't reached v1.0.0 or greater.) It may be the case that we need to make a new release soon though. @zackbloom thoughts?\n. @zackbloom I remember you having a similar suggestion. Any specific suggestion here?\n. Great!\n.
