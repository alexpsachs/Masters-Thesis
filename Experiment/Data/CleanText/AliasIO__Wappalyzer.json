    "AliasIO": "Awesome, thanks for the contribution!\n. No don't worry about that, the .xpi isn't even supposed to be there.\n. Look for \"Developer mode\" in Tools -> Extensions, click \"Load unpacked extension\". Obviously you'll need the source code from the other repo: https://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer-Chrome. You can use the same apps.js file, the Chrome version is usually slightly outdated.\n. Cheers!\n. Thanks for the request. It looks like you've only added an icon, is there supposed to be some code as well? Also, I can't find any information on NOIX, can you show me a few examples of sites that use it?\n. Well spotted, cheers.\n. Thanks again Julio, however it seems that your regex doesn't pick up NOIX on any of the examples you gave me earlier. Is there any way you can improve it?\n. Hey, I left a comment on your previous pull request and it doesn't look like you've changed any code since then. https://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/pull/5#issuecomment-2638704\n. Awesome.\n. Thanks Julio, see my commit here for a working pattern for NOIX: https://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/commit/bcad9eb5330fda70623aa476b4380257a88c8c6c\n. As I said in another message, I chose to leave it off because I believe it's too generic. I.e. other software might be using the same string and will be falsely identified as NOIX.\n. Sorry, I somehow missed this post!\nI've made improvements to the phpBB pattern, this will be fixed in the next update.\n. The next update for Firefox will be 2.0.6, which I haven't published yet (soon!).\n. Thanks!\n. Agreed, I'll replace it. Thanks!\n. Thanks, that one's much better indeed.\n. Thanks for the suggestion, although I can tell by looking at the diff that this code will throw an error. Please have a look at some of the other \"powered by\" patterns, it should be something in the lines of html: /Powered by <a[^>]+>Yii Framework/.\n. Thanks, that should be an easy fix.\n. Fixed.\n. Odd, it doesn't do that for me: http://i.imgur.com/UpCOt.png\nI could be a bug with caching, I'll have to keep an eye out to see if it happens more often. Closing this issue for now, I'll report back if I find out something more.\n. Chrome doesn't let extensions access response headers which means Wappalyzer is unable to detect servers, operating systems and several other applications. The only way around this seems to be to reload the page in the background using AJAX but that would slow down your browsing significantly. Perhaps I can add an option to do this on request.\nI'm closing this issue as it's a limitation of the extension API but I'm happy to discuss this further.\n. I could do that but I'm slightly worried it may cause other problems. GET requests are generally safe but requesting \"page.php?action=delete\" a second time in a poorly designed web application might actually do harm.\n. Wappalyzer does look for the HTTP header although this only works in the Firefox version. If you're using FF, can you give me some example URLs where it doesn't work?\n. Thanks, this should be in the next update.\n. Added, thanks again!\n. Thanks, this one looks like an easy fix as well.\n. Fixed.\n. Thanks raamee, I'll do some investigating. It's a good thing you posted the report although I don't see anything that might help me find the root of the issue. If you notice any patterns (e.g. always happens on the same sites) I'd love to hear it.\n. Without being able to reproduce this I don't think there's much I can do other than try to contact the FF devs about this, I'm unfamiliar with Firefox's inner workings. I run Firefox 10 on Debian Linux myself without issues. You're the first one to report this.\nCan you try an older version to see if it has the same issue? Version 1 was quite different under the hood:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wappalyzer/versions/?page=1#version-1.17.1\n. Ah, we're getting somewhere. I'm curious which version is the first to cause the crash, could you upgrade it to 2.0.1?\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wappalyzer/versions/?page=1#version-2.0.1\n. Thanks for bearing with me, at least that narrows it down a little. I might create a test version with some of the new code disabled to see if we can narrow it down further.\n. Try this. I comment out a bunch of code so the add-on won't work at all, but hopefully it won't crash your browser either. Remove Wappalyzer first.\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/3375548/wappalyzer.xpi\n. Thanks for testing! Here's another test with almost everything disabled:\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/3375548/wappalyzer-2.xpi\n. And another test version. If this doesn't crash Firefox I have a pretty good idea what the cause is.\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/3375548/wappalyzer-3.xpi\n. It seems that wrappedJSObject is the culprit. Here's a test with just that function commented out, I'm pretty this one won't crash either.\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/3375548/wappalyzer-4.xpi\n. It would be interesting to see if this version works. It still uses wrappJSObject but doesn't check the types of its methods.\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/3375548/wappalyzer-5.xpi\n. One last test, if you don't mind. :)\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/3375548/wappalyzer-6.xpi\n. No it appears to be the typeof call. Here's a version that's hopefully fully functional:\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/3375548/wappalyzer-7.xpi\n. Could you try excluding the window object, i.e. if ( i !== 'window' && typeof ... and see if that gets you anywhere?\n. You may be on to something with Object.keys. Your code doesn't look right though, it's checking/saving the values of wrappedJSObject instead of its keys (env is an array of variable names). Try this:\njavascript\nvar env = Object.keys(content.wrappedJSObject);\nThere isn't really a need for the typeof check or the loop.\n. Not sure if you saw my edit but I changed it to a single line. I'm assuming it works the same though, I'll do some testing on my end and push an update.\nIterating over the object doesn't cause any issues, it's accessing the variables. Perhaps there's some weird recursion going on which could explain the delay.\nThanks a lot for your help!\n. Here's the update. If anyone can confirm this works I can close this issue. :)\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wappalyzer/versions/?page=1#version-2.0.7\n. Awesome, thanks to both of you.\n. Thanks, you're doing great. :)\n. Fixed.\n. Thanks Alex. Are you running the latest version of Wappalyzer? I just tested it in two flavors of Linux (Ubuntu and CrunchBang) and the icons are being displayed as expected. Could you provide a screenshot?\n. It may be caused by another add-on. Anyway, I'm glad it's working.\n. If you don't mind, please open a new ticket with a screenshot and which version of the extension/browser you're using.\n. Although I'd love to add new projects I have to limit it notable apps with several thousands of users. See http://wappalyzer.com/suggestions.\n. Wappalyzer will become to big if I don't set some minimum requirements. :)\n. Do you have suggestions on how I'd go about identifying PHPISD? It looks like it mostly works behind the scenes which may make it impossible to detect.\n. The demo page doesn't set any cookies.\n. Wappalyzer for Firefox shows jQuery on that site. Are you using the Chrome version?\n. I'm not sure, is the other Firefox version using the same version of Wappalyzer? I'm not having the same issues.\n. Thanks! You did it perfectly. From now on it should be pretty easy to stay up to data by pulling my changes in.\nI had a quick look and your commits. Try to avoid HTML fields without tags, e.g. html: /fact-finder/ will match this GitHub page because it contains the word \"fact-finder\". It's better to do something like html /<[^]+fact-finder to make sure it matches actual HTML.\n. I think it's better if Wappalyzer fails to detect an app than to return false positives. Mainly because the statistics will become unreliable otherwise.\nVersion 2.0.8 has your changes, thanks again!\n. Added, thanks!\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. IPB is already in Wappalyzer but it looks like the pattern needs to be improved. Thanks.\n. Should be fixed in the next update.\n. Thanks, I'll report back when this is fixed.\n. I'm removing dashCommerce for now so this should be fixed in the next update.\n. Thanks, this will be fixed in the next update.\n. Thanks kacho. Does it make any difference if you disable all (or some) categories in chrome://wappalyzer/content/xul/preferences.xul? I can understand the initial spike in CPU usage but when Firefox is idle, Wappalyzer should be idle.\nI could add the option back to only scan the page on demand (when you click the Wappalyzer icon.)\n. Seems to be fine on Linux as well (I do have eight CPUs but it's only using 2% of one :).) I'll dig a bit deeper when I have some time.\n\n. I haven't been able to reproduce this, perhaps the issue has fixed itself with the recent Wappalyzer/Firefox updates. Let me know if this is still happening.\n. I'll take your word for it and see if I can borrow a Mac from someone to test.\n. I'm not surprised parsing several hundred regular expressions taxes the CPU a little bit but it's interesting it's only noticeable on Macs. I think the only solution may be to make Wappalyzer slower; i.e. not to parse everything at once. I'm not sure if short spikes in CPU usage are actually problematic though.\n. Version 2.4 has a few performance options, can anyone tell me if turning off any of the options makes a difference?\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wappalyzer/versions/?page=1#version-2.4.0\n. I severely reduced the number of regular expressions in 2.5, hopefully it performs a lot better.\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wappalyzer/versions/?page=1#version-2.5.0\n. Does it give you any clues such as which line of script was executed before crashing? Have you noticed a pattern when this happens, e.g. mainly on HTML-heavy pages such as Gmail?\n. Do you have experience with Chrome's developer tools? You can try having the following open to look for clues:\n- Tools -> Task Manager\n- Navigate to about:memory\n- Navigate to about:extensions -> tick \"Developer mode\" -> Wappalyzer: Inspect views: background.html\nI'd do this myself but haven't been able to reproduce this issue on any of my machines.\nHave you tried the Firefox version and do you know if the same issue occurs?\n. Thanks, that's much appreciated!\n. It used to be tens of millions on some pages before I optimised it. We got a lot more performance complaints back then. :)\nIt's a good point though, it runs all env patterns on every variable. It also does it on every load event. So a lot of events and a lot of variables would have a pretty big impact on performance.\nOn Firefox I hard-coded a limit of 500 variables and haven't had any complaints. I'm not sure why I haven't done the same for Chrome so let's see if that fixes it!\n. Wappalyzer should update itself in one or two days. Let me know if it still happens then.\n. Yes that's interesting. Most JS variables listed appear to be from the browser, it would be really good if we could exclude those somehow.\n. Updated. Also, feel free to submit a translation if you'd like to have Wappalyzer available in your language. :)\n. Thanks, Jira was already in Wappalyzer but I made some improvements.\n. Nope. I have removed it from Dev Tools.\n. It does still work with the hash but because it's a different URL there is no cached data. It's a good point though, they should be considered the same.\n. Different pages may use different software.\n. Yes, I'll ignore everything from the hash symbol for recognition. \n. Fixed in the next version.\n. Thanks!\n. Works fine for me actually.\n. Thanks!\n. Fixed, thanks!\n. Thanks for the fix!\n. Symfony is a frameworks that doesn't seem to leave a footprint, any idea on how to detect it?\n. It doesn't seem to set any Symfony specific headers so I don't think that's useful. \n. Thanks, I'll look into it and report back. :)\n. This will be in the next update.\n. Added!\n. Added!\n. I'm not including this one.\n. This one seems a bit obscure, i.e. not popular enough to add to Wappalyzer.\n. Awesome, I'll add those.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks! I've updated the link.\n. Should be fixed in the next update.\n. Added!\n. Thanks! You specified an incorrect category id, 22 is web servers, 1 is CMS. I'll correct it.\n. Thanks. If you can add a 16x16 of larger icon named David.Webbox.ico to /share/images/icons/ I'll merge the pull request.\n. Merged, thanks!\n. Merged the correct one this time. :)\n. I'm pretty sure Yii is undetectable just by looking at front-end code which means I can't add it. Do you know if Yii leaves any traces that can be picked up by Wappalyzer?\n. Other than a notice in Italian I can't find anything PHP-Nuke specific in the code, not much I can do to improve detection in this case.\n. This is basically just a WordPress plugin as far as I can see.\n. Thanks, I'll pull in your fix.\n. Thanks. I didn't write that pattern myself, I must have missed it in a pull request.\n. Disabled it for now.\n. Good catch, fixed it. Thanks again. :)\n. Awesome, thanks.\nAre you sure OpenGSE implies Java? \"Implies\" means it runs exclusively Java applications, not that the server itself is written in Java.\n. Alright, merged. :)\n. You're right, sorry. I can't automatically merge because of changes since this request, feel free to open a new one or I'll merge it manually.\n. Fixed in elbertf@fe0069972e4566fa3954f5bca71f55fd2d5f0289.\n. I'm guessing you accidentally changed a setting (settings are not reset with a re-install). Right click an empty space on the tab bar and turn on \"Add-on bar\". You'll probably find Wappalyzer there, right click it and turn off \"show in add-on bar\".\n. Don't worry, you're not the first. :)\n. Looks good, thanks!\n. Thanks, I'll have a look if I can change that. The category names should probably also be in the wappalyzer.properties file.\n. On line 156, w.categories[w.apps[app].cats[cat]].name should be replaced with something like strings.getString('wappalyzer.cat' + w.apps[app].cats[cat]) and the category entries in wappalyzer.dtd should be copied to wappalyzer.properties.\n. Cheers.\n. That looks great, apart from the icons.\nI prefer to keep the ICO files so I can copy favicons from sites without converting them to PNG. They can also cointain various dimensions in one file, i.e. 64x64 and 16x16. Converting them means I have to update the icons on the website as well. Is there any reason not to stick with the ICOs?\n. I don't think it matters too much. I figured on a high-res mobile device 32x32 might be preferable but there's only a handful of icons that actually utilize this. PNG is more common and the smaller file size is a plus. Converting the occasional icon isn't that big a deal so I'll merge your changes. Thanks. :)\n. Thanks! Because of a previous merge I can't automatically pull your changes in, can you update your fork and submit another pull request?\nI don't think we need a whole new category. Can you added JobberBase to the \"Miscellaneous\" category for now?\nI also think the pattern is slightly too loose as it will match any page containing \"Jobber.jobber_url\" (including this Github page). I don't mind tweaking this myself though.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks! I'll probably change the pattern from html to env: /^Jobber$/, that way it will match the JavaScript variable instead of a plain text string.\n. Fixed, thanks!\n. I've noticed this too. When I request is made I check if it's in the active tab, for some reason this includes AJAX requests (but not iframes).\n. I'm having trouble understanding your English, could you reword it a bit?\n. Wappalyzer detects applications per page, not per domain (different pages on the same domain can have different applications). So we'd just need to check if the URL is the same as what's in the address bar of the active tab.\n. That's incorrect. Varnish and Nginx can be detected by looking at the response headers of the master page (\"example.com\"). If you're using \"cdn.example.com\" to serve static content such as images it doesn't matter what software powers that server, it's likely a different server and could be run by a different company (i.e. Amazon). If your server uses PHP and the CDN uses Java, only PHP should be detected.\n. If a page loads 50 resources (e.g. images) Wappalyzer would have to do 50x more work. I can see a case for analysing iframes on the same domain but not for static content. I can guarantee you that subdomains are usually pointed to a different server (often third-party), otherwise you wouldn't have a use a subdomain in the first place.\n. Even on the same domain, two pages may run different applications. E.g. example.com/forums may run phpBB and example.com/blog may run WordPress. Going to example.com should not show both phpBB and WordPress at the same time. This is why Wappalyzer only analyses a single request, it doesn't combine detections on different URLs.\nThe other issue is performance. A single page may contain many resources (hundreds, perhaps). Analysing each request would cause Wappalyzer to slow down your browser a lot.\n. But it's already restricted. There are ~500 requests from that page and Wappalyzer ignores all of them. Only the main page is being analysed.\nThe fact that some AJAX requests currently affect what's being detected is bug and is not supposed to happen.\n. It's basically this block here:\nhttps://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/blob/master/drivers/firefox/content/js/driver.js#L72\nIt listens for location changes in the address bar and only calls w.analyze on the main request.\n. I don't have Java installed so I can't see the screencast. I did notice the icons flicker a bit when you load a page, is that what you experience? Something may have changed in a recent Firefox version.\n. I have fixed the AJAX and flickering issues in elbertf@dc783cca09448ba043b79179d7f5354f6dd23909.\n. Django is already in Wappalyzer. It's hard to detect so it doesn't work on a lot of sites.\n. Thanks, I'll look into it. It may take a little while but I'll report back when it's added.\n. Shopware will be in the next version.\n. This should be fixed in the next update.\n. Cheers, looks great. Note my comment about Jira running on other servers too (updated in elbertf@e7c147eb08c2a8223248766d886b4f4ead2be41f).\n. Perhaps you're right. I found this (Jira with plain Apache/httpd):\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Integrating+JIRA+with+Apache\nHowever it does say the \"recommended\" distro includes Tomcat.\n. Thanks, I'll report back once I've updated it.\n. I'm simply adding a check for \"Thank you for using Wolf CMS\" in the footer.\n. Merged, thanks!\n. Hi,\nThis is probably the most requested feature and I've considered it. The reason I've decided against it is the amount of work needed to update and maintain the detection patterns. I my experience once I start adding version numbers for a few applications users will expect this feature to work for all of them.\n. It wouldn't be simple. For instance Drupal might look something like this:\njavascript\n'Drupal': {\n    cats: [ 1 ],\n    versions: {\n        '*': {\n            script: /drupal\\.js/\n        },\n        '6': {\n            html: /<link[^>]+modules\\/cck/\n        },\n        '7': {\n            version: { headers: { 'X-Generator': /Drupal ([0-9.]+)/ } },\n            headers: { 'X-Generator': /Drupal 7/ }\n        }\n    },\n    implies: [ 'PHP' ]\n}\nHere \"version\" gets the actual version number (e.g. like \"1.7.2\" in the case of jQuery). For each major version we may need separate patterns (\"*\" for a global pattern if possible) as major releases are often complete rewrites.\nThe above code would detect Drupal 6 and 7 but since 6 doesn't set the \"X-Generator\" header it would only find the detailed version number if it's Drupal 7.\n. You'd only add separate entries for major versions numbers, jQuery would only have one. Drupal could have up to 7 as they're essentially different pieces of software.\nTo detect the version number itself (e.g. \"1.7.2\" in \"jquery-1.7.2.js\") a single pattern would suffice, e.g. script: /jquery-([0-9.]+)\\.js/. The first match is the version number. No need for a function.\nHowever different version of Drupal might have the version number specified in a different place (Drupal 7 has the version number in a header, Drupal 6 does not). So there could be up to 7 patterns to detect the (minor) version number.\n. That's certainly true in a lot of cases and may be worth implementing. I'm not against it.\nHowever in the case of most bigger applications (CMS, eComm) it's harder and most people seem to be interested in the major version of Drupal, WordPress, Magento etc. It's more interesting if a Drupal site is on version 6 or 7 than if jQuery is on version 1.6.1 or 1.7.2.\n. Alright, you're starting to win me over. We could even treat major versions as different applications so Drupal 6 and 7 would each have their own entry in apps.js.\njavascript\n'Drupal 7': {\n    cats: [ 1 ],\n    headers: { 'X-Generator': /Drupal 7/ },\n    version: { headers: { 'X-Generator': /Drupal ([0-9.]+)/ } },\n    implies: [ 'PHP' ]\n}\nI'm not sure how to incorporate this on the website yet but things can probably stay the way they are for now.\n. We could add a callback option (may be useful for application detection as well) but pure pattern matching has served Wappalyzer well so far and I'm somewhat concerned about speed. Portability will suffer too, Wappalyzer has been ported over to Perl, Java, Python and perhaps other languages which has been pretty straight forward.\nIf there are several ways to detect the version I imagine some patterns will fail and the first match will be the number we're after.\nI think it's ok for the stats to split up Drupal 6 and 7, you'll be able to see the growth and decline of both and still get a decent idea of Drupal's combined market share. We could add another field that links them together.\n. It's not that simple. Mozilla has a very strict policy on executing code from pages inside add-ons as it could easily compromise the browser.\n. Not sure if there is a real advantage. If applications want to make it easy for Wappalyzer an \"X-Powered-By\" header will do. I prefer to have the patterns and images embedded in the add-on.\n. Just X-Powered-By: Appname 1.0 is fine, I prefer to manually add the pattern and icon to Wappalyzer (I also need to manually add them to the website). Websites shouldn't have control over it.\n. I'm still thinking of the best way to detect version numbers. Using JavaScript is out of the question unfortunately (Firefox won't let me use eval() and running JS on content pages is unsafe).\nI'd like to somehow leverage the patterns we already have instead of having one pattern to detect the app and another to detect the version number. I'm playing with the idea of adding some custom syntax:\njavascript\n\"headers\": { \"X-Powered-By\": \"Drupal ([0-9]+)\\;version=$1\" }\nThe string would be split at the special \\; character. The first part is used to detect the app. The second part indicates that backreference 1 contains the version number.\nWe can add a tiny bit of logic using a ternary operator:\n``` javascript\n// Version is 7 if backreference 1 is set, otherwise version is 6\n\"headers\": { \"X-Powered-By\": \"Drupal ([0-9]+)\\;version=$1?7:6\" }\n// Version is 7 if backreference 1 is set, otherwise it's empty\n\"headers\": { \"X-Powered-By\": \"Drupal ([0-9]+)\\;version=$1?7:\" }\n// Version is 6 if backreference 1 is not set, otherwise it's empty\n\"headers\": { \"X-Powered-By\": \"Drupal ([0-9]+)\\;version=$1?:6\" }\n```\nOpinions?\n. Because of possible large difference between versions we may also need to allow for multiple patterns. E.g. replace the following:\njavascript\n\"headers\": { \"X-Powered-By\": \"(Foo|Bar)\" }\n...with this:\njavascript\n\"headers\": { \"X-Powered-By\": [ \"(Foo)\\;version=$1?1:\", \"(Bar)\\;version=$1?2:\" ] }\n. I agree it's not pretty. My main issue with your method that is that all fields now have to be defined twice. Also changing the pattern in one place means updating the fields in another. It doesn't easily allow for multiple patterns and we won't have the ability to add new logic to it down the track (i.e. some basic string replacements or individual confidence levels).\nSplitting a string isn't a very expensive operation so I wouldn't worry about performance too much. Doubling the size of the JSON file would affect memory usage.\njavascript\n\"AppName\": {\n  \"headers\" : {\n    \"Foo\" : [ \"(Foo)\\;version:$1\", \"(FooBar)\\;version:$1\\;confidence:50\" ]\n  }\n}\nThe above seems more readable and maintainable than something like the following:\njavascript\n\"AppName\": {\n  \"headers\" : {\n    \"Foo\" : [ \"(Foo)\", \"(FooBar)\" ]\n  },\n  \"version\": {\n    \"headers\": {\n       \"Foo\": [ [ \"6\", \"$3\" ], [ \"7\" ] ]\n    }\n  }, \n  \"confidence\": {\n    \"headers\": {\n       \"Foo\": [ null, 50 ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n. Thanks for weighing in @SebastianLopienski, I'm just about to make a decision on this.\nAlthough it would be nice we may not need the individual confidence levels. I just mentioned it to demonstrate to potential need for an extendible syntax. Another example would be simple string replacement, e.g. to replace dashes with dots in version numbers (just a thought):\njavascript\n\"script\": \"jquery-(2-0-0).js\\;version:$1\\;substitute:-/.\"\nOne thing I'm still not sure about is conflicting version numbers. What should happen when two patterns detect a different version? Pick the first one that comes up?\n. Trying to merge them is a good suggestion. Displaying multiple may be a bit confusing (one is almost guaranteed to be incorrect) but an option.\nI'm off on holiday for a couple of weeks but will probably start implementing the syntax after that. I'm assuming you'll be able to integrate it on your end as well so we should be able to combine our efforts.\n. @SebastianLopienski Go for it. We can always tweak it later.\nAnyway I'm off, I have a plane to catch. :)\n. That looks great, I'd like to merge all your changes. And yes, please provide icons and URLs (and categories).\nThe new scripts field isn't needed, I'd like all fields to accept either a string or an array to allow multiple expressions.\n. FYI, I decided individual confidence levels are actually a good idea. It makes more sense to define them per pattern and it's pretty simple to implement together with the version field.\n. Thanks! Don't worry about listing the categories, I'll get them from apps.json (most are obvious anyway). When adding the apps to the website I manually match up the categories.\n. Basic version detection is now functional. I still need to implement the ternary syntax.\n. FYI, the implies field now also accepts either an array or string. It can also have a confidence level which is multiplied by the confidence level of the original app.\nFictitious example:\njavascript\n\"mod_rails\": {\n    \"headers\": { \"Server\": \"mod_rails\\\\;confidence:50\" },\n    \"implies\": \"Ruby on Rails\\\\;confidence:50\"\nWhen the mod_rails header is detected we're 25% sure of \"Ruby on Rails\" (50% of 50%). Hopefully it's not getting too confusing because it turns out to be necessary.\n. I guess I can close this request. Version detection is now live. :)\n. @ToBeFree The last couple of days on the graph may be incomplete but I do expect the numbers to drop. We were detecting Rails by looking for the Apache module mod_rails, which doesn't necessarily mean the application is powered by Rails. We need at least two clues to be sure, otherwise it's not tracked.\n@SebastianLopienski Thank you, as well as everyone in this thread!\n. I think it's better to be specific. I can imagine a case like this where it would be impossible to tell if the site was powered by CentOS or Debian, even though it's quite obvious:\nServer: CentOS\nSet-Cookie: referrer=debian.org\n. '(X-Powered-By|Server)': /Debian/ looks better but is it really much of an improvement over 'X-Powered-By': /Debian/, 'Server': /Debian/? Right now Wappalyzer simply iterates over the header patterns and checks if that header is set:\njavascript\nfor ( var header in w.apps[app].headers ) {\n    if ( data[type][header] != null && w.apps[app][type][header].test(data[type][header]) ) {\nYour proposal would complicate this and diminish performance somewhat. I.e. instead of looping twice we'd have to loop over all set headers twice and apply an costly regular expression.\n. Nope that's not valid JavaScript I'm afraid. :)\n. Thanks, I'll add that.\n. Both have been added in #82.\n. Corrected, thanks!\n. Also fixed, thanks. :)\n. Fixed, thanks!\n. Thanks, looks good. I'll merge your changes but please see my inline comments.\n. Thanks, I'll report back when it's added.\n. Added in the next update.\n. env Means \"environment variable\". In this case it a variable in the window scope. So env: /jQuery/ will be true if window.jQuery is set.\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. Thanks. We should probably just clip them to 16px wide, that's how they're displayed on the website as well.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks, it's on the list.\n. Added in the next update.\n. Possibly, it's my list of things to do.\n. Added in the next update.\n. Hi,\nI'm not sure I understand your questions but the Wappalyzer source code is licensed under GPL so you can use it for other applications.\n. It shouldn't be too difficult to convert the file to JSON or even Python, I imagine the regular expressions will be almost the same. You'll have to do this yourself with some find & replace though.\n. I could but I won't, sorry. It will take me a fair bit of work for no obvious benefit. You can hire me to do it if you really need it and can't do it yourself.\n. I just pushed a fix so the HTML driver works again, note that it's just a proof of concept and not really useful for anything at the moment.\nIf you're on Windows you may need to manually copy all the files from the /share/ directory to /drivers/html/.\n. You can create your own driver, using the HTML driver as an example. I've been meaning to create some documentation but haven't had the time, I'll try to get to that soon.\n. Good  point, I've changed it to outerHTML. I don't see how that would break anything.\n. Thanks, I'll be sure to add that in.\n. Fixed in #94.\n. Nice work, thanks!\n. It's unfortunate that Chrome only allows for one icon to be displayed but I suppose it could show the main application. I'll add that in.\n. I don't think that's possible.\n. I just pushed an update to show the main application icon.\n. Cheers. :)\n. Thanks! Could you also include a 16x16 png image in share/images/icons? You can amend this pull request or submit a new one and I'll merge them both.\n. Thanks, I'll add the image. If you added the file to the repository you need to explicitly \"add\" it before you commit.\n. Fixed, thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Hi,\nI'm not planning on creating an Opera extension myself in the near future but I'll make sure the bookmarklet works. Can you tell me if any errors show up in the JavaScript console?\n. I just tested the bookmarklet on Opera 12.02 and it seems to work fine. Have you tried it on different sites?\n. Awesome. I'll make a mention of that on the download page.\n. Can you elaborate on your concerns? Wappalyzer picks up on publicly visible clues to identify software and there are other ways to obtain the same information. You can mostly control this already, e.g. Apache and PHP can be configured to not display any server information. If security is a concern this is your best option.\n. In that case the information is exposed anyway. Anyone could use LiveHTTPHeaders, Firebug, curl or whatever to to inspect the headers, Wappalyzer just makes it more convenient.\nI'm not against the idea but if security is a concern then blocking Wappalyzer will do very little.\n. If there is enough demand I'll reconsider but for now I'm going to leave things the way they are. I don't see many developers adding a meta-tag specifically for Wappalyzer. I do appreciate your suggestion Ilya, it's something to think about.\n. If the Apache headers are no longer present in the response than yes, it's most likely cached.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks, I'll look into those.\n. The first two are added as per JoeAnzalone@15548b7d0bd22547276ce235be8727b9cc1f5f60, JoeAnzalone@96fbfdac724f416b661539953369f024ac1e6eb9.\n. It takes a little while, I usually publish a new version when there have been a few more changes. You could run the development version using the instructions in the README if you like living on the edge. :)\n. I can't find any reliable methods to detect 3Dcart so I'm closing this one for now.\n. Those are JavaScript environment variables in the window scope, e.g. $ or jQuery.\n. I'd look into V8js for PHP or perhaps node.js to run Wappalyzer server-side.\nIn any case you probably won't be able to use the env fields unless you can execute JavaScript on web pages. This means the port won't be able to detect some applications.\nWill your PHP port be on GitHub?\n. It's probably safe to assume that people running spiders have control over their server and can install PHP modules. It would make the script more maintainable if all you need to port is the driver. It's something I've been planning to do myself.\n. Yeah I wasn't talking about the env variables, although executing the scripts in a sandbox might be a possibility. Ideally you would run the files in share/js without modification. That way I can update the core code for all platforms at once.\n. You could probably turns apps.js into valid JSON on the fly without too much difficulty. Yes, using regex to parse regex.\nYou're probably right that executing website scripts will be challenging. I might still give it a try.\n. I'm not sure why you need stdin to use cURL unless you pipe the output into the PHP script, in which getting the headers isn't as simple as just using PHP's curl_init(). Ideally you can just submit a POST request directly and the script returns a list of applications.\n. Yeah, I realise you're aiming to build a spider whereas I'm interested in a more general purpose script.\nThe env field is indeed pretty important, it made a big difference when I added that to Wappalyzer. We could add google.load(\"jquery\", \"*\") to the detection pattern.\n. Here you go, a functional PHP driver after a couple of hours of Sunday afternoon hacking. :)\nhttps://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/tree/master/drivers/php\n. Not yet but that's the next step. There are some security considerations to be made as evaluating third party scripts can be dangerous. It may be enough to sandbox them in a separate V8js instance.\nI also expect plenty of errors but it's enough for the jQuery object to simply exist.\n. I actually think just creating a new V8js instance will be sufficient, i.e. $sandbox = new V8js;. I just need to be sure JavaScript can't call any code in PHP.\n. FYI, Wappalyzer now uses a JSON file: https://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/blob/master/share/apps.json\n. I do, although I have little time. I sent you an email.\n. That looks great. I have heard of it but never looked into it. Please share your implementation if you get it to work!\n. Just the main page. Most resources will be static or coming from a different server. JavaScript files are mostly covered by the env field. It may be nice to analyse CSS files to check for web frameworks such as Bootstrap but we're not doing that at the moment (and perhaps never will for performance reasons).\n. No, you need to loop through the window object in the context of the page:\njavascript\nfor ( i in window ) { environmentVars += i + \" \"; }\nSee https://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/blob/master/drivers/chrome/js/content.js#L37\n. Thanks, I'll look into it.\n. Fixed in the next update.\n. It identifies OpenGSE and Java for me, which browser are you using? PHP is probably also incorrect, Wappalyzer shows it because WordPress is written in PHP.\n. Oddly it doesn't detect anything for me on Chromium. Does it do this every time and on every page?\njavascript\n'WordPress': {\n    cats: [ 1, 11 ],\n    meta: { 'generator': /WordPress/i },\n    html: /<link rel=(\"|')stylesheet(\"|') [^>]+wp-content/i,\n    env: /^wp_username$/,\n    implies: [ 'PHP' ]\n}\nThese are the patterns used to detect WordPress, perhaps Google Voice uses wp_username somewhere in the JavaScript.\n. It could be incorrectly cached from another website but restarting your browser should fix that.\n. I'll close this for now as I can't replicate it but I'm still curious why it happens. Thanks for the report and bearing with me. :)\n. Thanks Florian, the next update will have some improvements that should fix this.\n. Both issues fix themselves after a restart. I think w.driver.lastDisplayed causes the icon issue. I'm not sure why moving the container in the addon bar initially shows an empty space, it works the other way around.\n. I fixed the flickering by not updating the container unless something has actually changed (using w.driver.lastDisplayed.) We just need to make sure the container is updated when moving it to a different location.\n. I fixed the container issue, apparently you can't you display: block|none with XUL.\n. Can you confirm this is fixed in 2.3.4?\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wappalyzer/versions/?page=1#version-2.3.4\n. Great, thanks for reporting the issue. :)\n. Just install it for them if that's the case. :)\n. Thanks, it's fixed!\n. Thanks for the suggestion, I'll post here when I've added it.\n. Added as per JoeAnzalone@63938c2f68cd0a461cb38a70eab2a06655078e50.\n. That's odd, it looks like Wappalyzer should still be able to detect it. I'll look into it!\n. Fixed, Wappalyzer didn't handle the # symbol in the URL correctly.\n. Hi,\nThis has been fixed in 2.3.4. You can install it here:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wappalyzer/versions/?page=1#version-2.3.4\nThanks for the bug report!\n. Accessible Portal is already in Wappalyzer!\n. Thanks!\nA couple of minor things; the periods in regular expressions should be escaped and the HTML matches plain text if you don't include angle brackets. It's good enough the merge though. :)\n. Pulled that one too, thanks a lot!\n. Awesome, thanks. :)\nThe CDN category should be limited to services such as CloudFlare and Akamai who deliver the entire website through a distributed network, not video hosts or Amazon S3 for hosting images etc.\n. This has been fixed in 2.3.4, you can install it here:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wappalyzer/versions/?page=1#version-2.3.4\nSorry for the trouble.\n. I think adding env = Object.keys(content.wrappedJSObject) in drivers/firefox/content/js/content.js on line 43 (under the url bit) might fix that (I'm not at my own computer right now.)\nThanks a lot for adding those, you're doing great.\n. Thanks! Did the fix work for the issue you were having?\n. Awesome. I thought it might because I removed that line recently thinking it wasn't needed any more.\n. Thanks once again. :)\n. Fixed, cheers.\n. Do you have any examples and perhaps suggestions what to look for in the code? ModX has always been difficult to detect.\n. The problem is that Wappalyzer doesn't make any requests. If it did it would have to make dozens of queries on every page load.\nDo you know if there any specific JavaScript or perhaps cookies set by ModX?\n. Awesome, thanks. Would it be better to add this under \"Cache Tools\" instead of \"Web Servers\"? Also could provide a 16x16 PNG if possible?\n. Thanks, I've updated it.\n. Does the error message display additional information? There was an issue with an invalid Windows filename (Rack::Cache.png) which I thought I fixed.\n. http://alias.io/wappalyzer-chrome.zip\nCan you unzip this file?\n. Could you upload the screenshot somewhere?\n. Could you try to unzip the file I linked in a previous comment? Just by right clicking it and without using Chrome.\n. Great. Now if you navigate to about:extensions in Chrome and drop the ZIP file in there, does it install?\n. If you type about:extensions in the URL bar in Chrome you should be able to drag the ZIP file from your desktop or file browser onto that page.\nIt should look something like this: http://i.minus.com/jPqKUS9mbLfc0.png\n. That's ok, I think I can assume it's working anyway. If you can unzip that file on your PC Chrome should have no issues with it.\nI'll probably publish a new version later today and you can try installing it from the Chrome Web Store. I'll post here when that's done.\n. I just published the new version on the Chrome Web Store. It should be available in a few minutes.\n. Thanks a lot!\n. Thanks!\n. The input fields seems a bit too generic. The OL* variables seem to appear on other software as well.\nThere is a moodleConfigFn environment variable that I've added, and the MoodleSession cookie.\n. Google doesn't index source code unless it's hosted publicly on a site like GitHub. And new applications may start using the same field name.\n. Well spotted, thanks!\n. That's a big list, must have taken you a while!\n. I agree it's easier to manage multiple issues, don't worry about opening too many.\n. All fixed. Thanks a lot!\n. It's caching, the changes should be visible by now.\n. Fixed locally, thanks!\n. Thanks, I changed the link on the website.\n. Muchas gracias.\n. Uhm, good question. I may have worked on an older file when converting apps.js to JSON.\n. Added, thanks. :)\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. The category is really meant for CDNs that serve an entire site (like Cloudflare does). Anyone can embed an image hosted by Akamai or Amazon S3 but that's not particularly interesting.\nI'd love to be able to detect sites served through Akamai but they don't seem to send any headers or cookies.\n. Fixed, thanks!\n. I did a global replace for /i to remove the case insensitivity flag, I guess I was a little careless. :) Looks like it should be easy to fix though, it would only have affected applications starting with i.\n. Fixed in 11de2c5fa8fc5e991147a69df4dea61c69615829.\n. Thanks, I really appreciate your thoroughness!\n. This is awesome!\nIf you don't mind I prefer to keep this as a separate project, at least for now. Mainly because I have no Python experience and won't be able to act on bug reports. I'll add a link to your repository in the README and may even contribute myself.\nThe reason I used V8js for the PHP driver is that it's much more portable and easy to maintain. I can make non-platform specific changes without having to update every driver.\n. Great additions but I can't merge it its current state. It looks like the files have been reformatted (Git reports 25,000 changes). Does your editor convert tabs to spaces or UNIX line endings to Windows? Have a look at the diff.\n. I'm using hard links in Linux, not symbolic links. I don't know if Windows has something similar.\nIt's odd because I'm pretty sure Git handles different line endings. I don't see a difference between the two files other than what you've added.\n. I couldn't see a difference but it's probably my Git client that converts them. A also set my editor to automatically convert DOS line endings to UNIX.\n. I manually merged your changes, thanks!\n. Thanks. I made some improvements:\n\"(<a[^>]*(\\\\?|&)osCsid|Powered by (<[^]+>)?osCommerce</a>|<[^]+class=\\\\\\\"[^>]*infoBoxHeading)\"\nNo idea where Google Friend Connect went, I added it back.\n. I guess that's why it's been removed. I'll delete it from the site.\n. It's a bit generic but I've added it anyway. You're right that Wappalyzer doesn't really inspect JavaScript objects, it just runs through the list of global variable names.\n. osCommerce doesn't use the AjaxShoppingCart variable or the ajax_shopping_cart.js script though?\n. Looking at the source, the script is called jquery-oscart.js and it doesn't introduce any global variables.\n. Fair enough, I'll remove the ajax_shopping_cart.js bit.\n. I'm only using jQuery for CSS selectors, I may get rid of it actually.\n. Thanks. It only shaves off about 25 kB, I'll probably still get rid of jQuery altogether.\n. I prefer not to add a new category unless we add similar applications, would you be happy to file this under CMS or Miscellaneous?\nAdding a category requires most drivers to be updated as well (including locales).\nThanks for the little fixes!\n. I updated it in 578979d6ee6b6726995c90a3e28b5e91766f3d97. Thanks.\n. Added, thanks!\n. Thanks, added.\n. Added, thanks for the suggestion.\n. Chrome Frame is but this JavaScript snippet should always be detectable. I don't think it's particularly interesting though so let's skip this one.\n. Also added, thanks. :)\n. Added that too now.\n. Thanks, it looks like Wappalyzer was having trouble with the # symbol in the URL.\n. Updated, thanks.\n. Also updated, thanks!\n. Awesome, thanks.\n. Merci beaucoup. :)\n. Interesting. :) Fixed.\n. Noticed that too, thanks.\n. Evaluating JavaScript is not that simple.\n``` javascript\nvar a;\nfunction() {\n    var b;\nc = 'd';\n\n}\nwindow[c] = null;\nwindow.e = null;\n```\nIn this case we want to find a, c, d and e but not b. PHP V8Js handles this perfectly so why not use it? I'm also using V8Js to run Wappalyzer itself.\nI don't want the browser plugins to make any additional requests. Downloading all scripts a second time will only make things slower.\nI don't mind the PHP driver downloading the scripts separately and executing them in a sandboxed environment. It's a little challenging because the browser variables aren't set but I think I'll be able to work that out. I'm already half way there.\n. Well, window.jQuery is not quite the same as function() { var jQuery; }. In most cases only global variables matter.\nUsing V8Js is not a bother a all IMO. If you're running spiders you're most likely in control of your web server and installing a PHP module shouldn't be an issue. I like the idea of having a single core file that powers the various drivers instead of having to maintain several ports that all do the exact same thing.\n. Thanks for the suggestion, I agree.\n. Added.\n. Thanks a lot!\n. For some reason jQuery got deleted in this pull request..?\n. Updated, thanks.\n. What q-- said. Let me know if it's not detected on websites that definitely run the CMS.\n. I seem to make that mistake often. :)\n. Added, thanks.\n. The stats would be pretty meaningless, you might as well look at the DB manager stats which would be exactly the same. Unless we can detects databases directly I wouldn't add a category for it.\n. Yeah I think I changed my mind on this one. Let's add it in. Even though the statistics may not be particularly useful it's still nice to display which database is used, where possible.\n. Confirmed. Very odd!\n. Fixed in the next update.\n. There have been reports that Wappalyzer no longer works with version 16.\nWappalyzer is incompatible with mobile Firefox though.\n. Yeah I downloaded FF16 and it seems to work fine for me as well.\nMobile Firefox has different UI elements and I never wrote the code for it. That's not something you can work around. You can try the bookmarlet but I'm not sure that works on tablets either:\nhttp://wappalyzer.com/bookmarklet/\n. I think you're right. Updated.\n. Updated, thanks.\n. Added, thanks!\n. Fixed!\n. Fixed, thanks.\n. Thanks @gadcam! I updated it so applications with multiple categories are displayed correctly.\n. Fixed, thanks once more. :)\n. Added. :)\n. Fixed, thank you.\n. Thanks!\nHave a look at the diff, it looks like all lines have been updated again.\n. Thanks for Camille, I appreciate your efforts. :)\nHowever, I can't view the diff and merging doesn't work either because of the line endings. I'll have manually copy the files into my repo.\n. Awesome thanks.\n. Did you re-save the PNGs or something? 351 Files were changed.\n. Ok awesome. :)\n. Added, sorry it took so long!\n. You cleaned it up nicely, thanks.\n. Fixed, thanks. :)\n. Ouch, you're right. Fixing up the Chrome version now and will do the rest once that's done.\n. What other bugs? It seems to work fine. All the above issues are now fixed.\n. This is why I created the firefox-jetpack driver. It's a much simpler API and has great development tools. It didn't get very far with it yet though, perhaps it's still worth making the current FF driver restartless.\n. Have a look at this video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKN4_fOKEWQ\nThere's two parts; the add-on builder and the SDK. We won't use the builder so just get the SDK up and running and have a quick read through the docs if you're interested.\nI'm not sure if it's suitable for more complicated add-ons. There are no methods to change the address bar for instance so we'd still need the native functions for some things.\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/builder\n. Jetpack still seems to be in early stages, I'm not sure if you can get response headers or modify the chrome without resorting to the low-level API.\n. This one has been revived again.\nhttps://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/tree/master/drivers/firefox-sdk\n. This is done, more discussion in #423.\n. Fixed, thanks.\n. Thanks!\n. I'll try to work out where the conflict is, it may be fixable on our end.\n. Right, the add-on seems to be breaking core Firefox functionality. It's not really worth working around it since it hasn't been updated in over two years and isn't compatible with the FF versions Wappalyzer supports.\n. Thanks. They also reported Joomla is incorrectly being detected on RCMS sites for some reason.\n. Done!\nFor some reason Snoobi implied Joomla, so not an issue with RCMS.\n. Thanks! I manually merged most of your changes but I don't like the idea of including third-party binary files. Perhaps you can include instructions to download 7zip?\n. Much better, thanks.\n. Detection wouldn't work too well this way, i.e. response headers can only be analysed before a page is loaded and many JavaScript are fired on page load. Wappalyzer used to have this feature but I removed it, partially for this reason but also to keep the add-on code simpler and the fact that few people used it.\nCan you expand on why you think this would be a good feature to have?\n. Yes most add-ons make another request. If you use Firebug you have probably noticed the Net tab is empty unless Firebug is open when you request the page.\nYou can turn the applications icons off in the settings. It will only show the main icon.\nPerhaps I'll add a \"pause\" button until we have a restartless version.\n. That's a good point actually, the bookmarklet does exactly what you want. It re-requests the page on click to get around the response header issue.\n. Thanks Sebastian. I'm unable to merge as GitHub seems to be having some issues but I'll try again in a bit.\nWill you publish your Python port on GitHub as well?\n. Merged, thanks.\n@ebradbury created a Python driver and port here. I'd love to see yours too.\n. The first many to come perhaps? Feel free to open an issue for anything you'd like to discuss.\nI noticed the CERN reference in your profile. I visited last year, I have a pin on my bag and wear it with pride. :)\n. Excellent, I'll add a mention in the README. :)\n. Thanks, I updated the icons on the website. GitHub isn't letting me merge at the moment, I'll try again later.\n. Updated!\n. Thanks for the suggestion! Komodo CMS will be in the next update.\n. Hi Dan,\nI appreciate your feedback on this, I imagine most other people wouldn't bother and just leave. It's a common trait of developers to not be able to see things from an end-users perfective and I'm no exception.\nI used to have an About page but it was so sparse I decided the blurb in the header was enough to explain what Wappalyzer is about:\nWappalyzer is a browser extension that uncovers the technologies used on websites. It detects content management systems, web shops, web servers, JavaScript frameworks, analytics tools and many more.\nThere isn't much to it. When you install Wappalyzer it just sits there and displays logos of software that's used to create the website you're viewing.\nI'm curious what you expected when you installed the add-on. It's most commonly used by web developers such as myself and may not be useful for everyone.\nI'll definitely work on some better copy for on the homepage, hopefully that helps.\n. Thanks Dan. I do have screenshot on the \"installation successful\" page but I agree it could do with a bit of an explanation. The download page is also sparse on information.\nhttp://wappalyzer.com/installed\n. I've started by adding some instructions on the \"installed\" page.\nhttp://wappalyzer.com/installed\n. I can't think of a scenario where the \"installation successful\" page is displayed but no icons show up. I also think the newly added icons are fairly obvious, especially with the aid of the screenshots. I'll play around with the wording a bit more though.\n. I'll address that in a separate FAQ page.\n. I started on the FAQ and linked to it from several places including the install page. Let me know what you think.\nhttp://wappalyzer.com/faq\n. I'll put the table on top. I'm also adding bits to the homepage and download page.\n. Thanks a lot @q--!\n. Thanks Dan, I did notice the CDN issue. I'll also sort the options alphabetically, at least for the English language.\n. Fixed.\n. Added (just the new version), thanks!\n. Great, thanks for contributing!\n. Please do! Let me know if you feel we can make improvements to the README to make things clearer for new contributors.\nAlso have a look at the last messages in this thread, we're preparing to detect versions numbers too.\n. Cheers. It works but technically the periods need to be escaped to not match any character.\n. Hi Nisam,\nNo that can't be right. Does it always show Drupal or did this only happen once? It only detected SPDY for me.\n. Wappalyzer does use caching but that doesn't really explain why it detected Drupal in the first place. Perhaps Google returned a search result matching a Drupal pattern and Wappalyzer remembered it.\n. You're right, the HTML pattern is too loose. It would detect Drupal on any page that contains Drupal and settings in plain text. We can get rid of that bit, it's covered by the env anyway (although it's nice to have an alternative).\n. Fixed.\n. Correct, thanks!\n. Thanks a lot Sebastian! Much appreciated.\n. Oh that's hideous. Added anyway. :)\n. Cheers. :)\n. Thanks! Perhaps we can just use \\b (word boundary).\n. Thanks @satishsagi, we'll fix this one soon. Closing as duplicate.\n. Isn't that similar to calling a file \"jquery.js\"? I wouldn't expect anyone to use \"bootstrap.css\" for anything other than the Bootstrap CSS framework. False positive may occur here and there but the only alternative in this case is to remove Bootstrap from Wappalyzer completely. Unfortunately it's a bit difficult to detect.\n. Is suppose bootstrap[^\">]+css would do the trick (only matches one attribute), which would match bootstrap-1.0.0.css or similar as well. You have a valid point but I prefer not to make the pattern too strict, unless I find a better solutions to detect Bootstrap.\n. Great, thanks!\n. Awesome, thanks. Note that the HTML pattern should really have at least a < in there to prevent it from matching plain text.\n. Thanks. :)\nNote that <.* might still match plain text (e.g. <foo>plain text). You can use <[^>]* to match strings between brackets.\nAlso Ruby on Rails already implies Ruby so you don't have to imply Ruby separately. There's no harm having both in there though.\n. Much better, thanks. :) I forgot to mention all expressions are case insensitive so [a-zA-Z] is the same as [a-z].\n. Cheers. It may take a few weeks to appear in Wappalyzer as we're completing some other features.\n. Thanks, that's definitely an improvement. A few (tiny) remarks:\nWhere possible the html field should never match plain text. For example window.__admin_media_prefix__ will now match this Github page. In this case you can probably use env: \"__admin_media_prefix__\" (env is used to find variables in the window object).\nAll expressions are case-insensitive so [a-zA-Z] can be shortened to [a-z].\nThe input pattern can probably be a bit more loose, e.g. <input[^>]+name=\\\"csrfmiddlewaretoken\\\"[^>]+value=\\\"[a-z0-9]{32}\\\".\nI'm happy to make these changes but if you prefer you can amend your pull request and I'll merge it in.\n. Thanks. There's no real need to change it but a more loose pattern may deal better with slight changes. E.g. they decide to remove the wrapping <div> tag or add a class. A more specific pattern is more likely to prevent false positives though.\n. Thanks. Should X-Drectory-Script be X-Directory-Script? If so please amend your pull request and I'll merge it in.\n. Consider it merged. :)\n. This won't work because env only matches methods of the window object. There is no easy way around that.\nWhat do you mean about the headers field, use a string instead of an object? How would that work?\n. Currently the userscript just grabs all the window methods and then runs the expressions against that. The should be as little interaction with JavaScript on the page as possible, for security reasons and the possibility of breaking something on the page.\nI see what you mean with the headers field, I don't think it's worth changing though. Your first example is invalid JSON so it won't really work anyway.\n. Thanks for reporting this. And yes, it's a bug as per @gadcam.\n. Nice effort, cheers!\n. I still need to add the ternary syntax (version:\\1?1:2) but I guess we can launch a version without it. I just want to be sure the version detection works properly (it seems like it does).\n. I also noticed you didn't double escape in a few places so the JSON didn't validate. Should be good now.\nI just noticed Django is being detected on Github so it's not perfect yet. :)\nEdit:\nActually Wappalyzer only detects Django on this page because it's matching code in the \"Files Changed\" tab. Not sure why it's matching plain text.\n. Thanks. I just noticed it's already plural on the website so this will fix the currently broken link. I also updated to locales to be in the right form.\n. Thanks for the suggestion!\n. Added.\n. Thanks. Also for spotting the MySQL mistake. :)\n. Yes, I'd say the database category is generic enough to include any kind of data store.\nSend them all through at once. I'm looking forward to the pull request. :)\nIcons are required but you may use the generic Wappalyzer icon if you can't find anything. Sometimes I find something generic myself like a printer icon. A URL is always needed for the website although I could possibly change that.\nI'd create separate categories but generally only if it has multiple applications assigned to them.\n. Excellent work! Unfortunately Github won't let me merge, probably because you fixed several lines I already updated. Let me know if you want me to to perform the merge manually.\n. Much better thanks. :)\n. Perfect. ;)\n. Yes I'm aware. There is no easy way in Firefox to do this. You can see my commented out experiment with this here:\nhttps://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/blob/master/drivers/firefox/content/js/content.js#L46\n. Did you see if that works?\n. All three have \"X-Powered-By: ASP.NET\" in the response headers. How do you know they're running ColdFusion?\n. I see. Do you have any suggestions on how to detect B2C or CF in this case?\n. There are also links in the HTML that indicate CF.\n. I added iCongo (works on two of your examples) and Adobe ColdFusion (works on all three).  Wappalyzer may still report ASP.NET in some cases but there's not much I can do about that.\nThanks!\n. Have you ever used Chrome's developer tools?\n- Navigate to chrome://extensions\n- Check \"Developer mode\"\n- Under \"Wappalyzer\", click \"Inspect views: background.html\"\n- Select the \"Console\" tab.\nWhen Wappalyzer stops working, do you see any errors in the console?\n. Thanks a lot! I just published version 2.19, please let me know the issue still occurs after upgrading.\n. Thanks @mkeegan, I'll have to have another look at that one.\n. This should really be fixed this time (v2.20), thanks for you help!\n. If you can, please resubmit your pull request without changes to drivers/firefox/content/js/content.js. It seems to have fallen victim to auto formatting by your editor or something. :)\nhttps://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/pull/240/files\n. You don't seem to have our latest changes checked out so that commit doesn't play nice either. I manually merged your changes, thanks. :)\n. Thank you for contributing!\nNote that the HTML field shouldn't match plain text, ideally you have at least a < in the pattern. In this case you're better off using the env field, which is for matching global JavaScript variables. I'll amend it.\n. Cheers.\n. Updated, thanks!\nLet me point out the mild irony of your avatar having the old icon still. ;)\n. Thanks!\nIn this case you can use the script field instead of html. I'll update it.\n. Thanks!\n. Greedy means the ? includes the preceding character when possible, it will never skip the / when it's there. As @gadcam said the dot is literal inside a collection. The pattern will also match php/. It's fine. :)\n. Fixed, thank you. :)\n. It was the original \"generic\" icon. Good point though, I'll update them with the cube icon.\n. Added, thanks.\nI changed the spelling of \"advertising\" although \"advertizing\" seems to be accepted in US English as well.\n. Done.\n. Added, thanks.\n. Added. Nice icon. :)\n. Added!\n. Added, thanks!\n. Nice one, added.\n. Not really. I added SQLite with 50% confidence.\n. Why not phpSQLiteCMS( (.+))?$\\\\;version:\\\\2?\n. BTW let's stick to Perl flavoured expressions.\n. Added, cheers.\n. Added thanks. Fixed AddThis as well.\n. Awesome, updated.\n. At least on of us is paying attention. :)\n. The website now imports everything from apps.json so issues like these will probably never happen again. :)\n. Added, although Laravel is difficult to detect. The only clue is the cookie, which means it's only detected when you first visit a Laravel site (when the cookie is set).\n. Excellent, thank you!\n. Thanks. I also noticed you did a bit of refactoring. :)\n. Thanks!\n. Hey nice work! The URL matches need to be a little bit more specific but the rest is great.\n. Cheers. I wonder if we can write a validator to spot these mistakes.\n. Good stuff, thanks.\n. Thanks for the additions!\nIt looks like you undid some changes we made recently, can you please do a merge and resubmit your pull request?\nTo have Wappalyzer pick up the version number you can use Mura CMS ([\\\\d.]+)\\\\;version:\\\\1. Note that the dot doesn't need escaping in this case.\n. Have a look at the diff:\nhttps://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/pull/271/files#L16L41\nIt doesn't look like it's your fault though, the changes in share/apps.json weren't copied over to the other files. I'll merge your changes in manually.\n. Perfect, thanks a lot!\n. Cheers. Maybe we should just look for bootstrap.css for now.\n. Yeah good point.\n. Sorry for the late reply. That looks excellent, definitely something to implement. \n. This is finally done. Thanks @q-- for writing most of it!\n. Thanks!\n. Apologies for not responding sooner, thanks for the patch!\n. You're right, but in that case Hybris will never be detected unless the cookie is set. I think I'd rather have a few false positives in this case. Until we find a better pattern at least.\n. I may be possible in the Firefox version but I'm not sure how. In Chrome I think we'd need to re-request the JS and CSS files, which I don't want to do. Wappalyzer does look for JavaScript variables in the window object, for example the Mage and VarienForm variables to detect Magento.\n. The PHP version is less accurate because it doesn't evaluate JavaScript on websites. It's actually quite difficult to do this. A solution I'm interested in is running Webkit server-side using PhantomJS.\nActually running the JavaScript will be much more accurate than scanning the source code. The latter would be fairly simple to implement in the PHP version but you won't be able to use the env patterns reliably.\nMagento Enterprise could quite easily be detected by looking for Mage and Enterprise variables in the window object.\n@gadcam \"env\": \"Enterprise.templatesPattern\" doesn't work.\n. @gadcam It doesn't work because Wappalyzer only collects method's of the window object and matches patterns against that. It will find Enterprise but not Enterprise.templatesPattern.\n@q-- That's a great tip, probably something we should implement.\n. @gadcam We can't execute JavaScript on websites which is why it works the way it does. Not sure if that's what you mean.\n. @philippe-NBS Right, the env variable isn't usable in the current PHP version because the website's JavaScript never runs.\nIt's technically possible to evaluate JavaScript in PHP but I haven't gotten it to work yet, mainly because typical scripts rely on browser variables such as window and window.document to be defined.\nThe other option I mentioned is using a server-side web browser, e.g. WebKit using PhantomJS. This means creating a new driver from scratch (perhaps one or two days work.)\nYou can't link conditions but perhaps you can use confidence levels. For instance:\njavascript\n\"Application 1\": {\n  \"headers\": { \"Server\": \"App 1\" },\n  \"implies\": \"Application 3\\\\;confidence:50\"\n},\n\"Application 2\": {\n  \"headers\": { \"Server\": \"App 2\" },\n  \"implies\": \"Application 3\\\\;confidence:50\"\n}\nIn this case 'Application 3' will be implied with 100% confidence if both 'Application 1' and 'Application 2' are found.\n. Thanks, I added the UTF-8 check.\n. Unfortunately ExpressionEngine can only be detected when it sets a cookie, as far as I know. I'm happy to improve it if you have any suggestions.\n. Fixed, thanks.\n. Neat, thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Awesome, thanks!\nNote that the website URL should not be prefixed with http://.\n. Thanks, we'll add that in!\n. Closed as per #303.\n. Can you uncheck the performance options in Wappalyzer's settings one by one and tell me if any of them make a difference?\n. It's probably enough to just uncheck the onload events option, it sounds like Outlook fires off a lot of those. Wappalyzer will be less accurate in some cases but you get much better performance. What kind of computer are you using?\n. I have no plans to add site-specific settings. You don't miss out on too much with the option disabled though. I'll keep an eye out for bits that can be optimised.\n. Thanks!\n. Thank you.\n. Wappalyzer doesn't scan resources on the page because it would affect performance badly (e.g. scanning headers of potentially hundreds of images.) Also resources can be loaded from a different server, e.g. a CDN.\nThe server on that page identifies itself as Zope.\n. I added Mono and reduced the confidence level for IIS and Windows Server when ASP.NET is detected. It's not perfect but I can't not imply Windows if Mono is detected.\nThis is what it reports:\nASP.NET\nMono\nUbuntu\nApache\nWindows Server (50% sure)\nIIS (50% sure)\n. Try 2.7.2.\n. How do you decide which one is correct though? I don't want to add too much logic to the patterns.\n. Thank you!\n. Thanks, we'll add that in!\n. Excellent, thanks!\nWould you mind updating the wiki with instructions how to get it to run?\nhttps://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/wiki/Drivers\n. I agree RHEL seems slightly more specific than UNIX but the server reports both OSes. We may eventually implement an \"excludes\" directive but at the moment we can't exclude an app based on another detection.\nI appreciate the bug report but I'm closing this issue for now. We'll revisit it at some point.\n. Fixed, thank you.\n. Added, thanks!\n. As far as I know it's practically impossible to detect Symfony, there are no headers or cookies being set like some other frameworks do.\n. Thanks!\nBefore I merge your pull request, can you please add a 16x16 PNG image called \"LiveStreet CMS\" to share/images/icons/?\n. Thanks!\n. This has been fixed, it was because of API changes in Google Chrome. Thanks for raising the issue!\n. Patched, thanks a lot!\n. Hey, @q-- is back. :)\n. Thanks for that. I know you've been waiting for a little while. :)\n. Thanks for logging the issue here. If you don't mind, could you do the following to help me debug?\n- Navigate to chrome://extensions/\n- Check Developer mode\n- Wappalyzer -> Inspect views -> background.html\n- Open the Console tab\nIf you could share the last few lines in the console when the issue occurs that would probably help a lot.\n. That sounds pretty terrible. This is what I see on theverge.com:\nTested 75024 regular expressions in 0.017s\nParsing regular expressions is all that Wappalyzer does. I think the best I can do in this case is adding an option to skip checking JavaScript variables which will reduce the number of expressions quite a bit.\n. I wouldn't be surprised it is a hardware limitation but these lines stand out:\n[wappalyzer debug] Tested 5624 regular expressions in 4.873s driver.js:18\n[wappalyzer debug] Tested 5624 regular expressions in 4.873s driver.js:18\n[wappalyzer debug] Tested 41446 regular expressions in 0.041s driver.js:18\nI suppose matching against a long HTML would take longer than a short JavaScript variable name but the time difference here is huge. Perhaps it's a specific pattern that inefficient or Chrome is prioritizing processes somehow.\nCould you test the same pages in Firefox to work out if it's browser or hardware issue?\n- Navigate to about:config, acknowledge the warning\n- Search for wappalyzer.debug\n- Double-click to set the value to true\n- Press Ctrl+Shift+J to open the JavaScript console\n. I can probably add a time-out in the loop that evaluates expressions. I.e. break the loop after a second. I'll also check if the limit that Firefox has is also implemented properly in the Chrome version.\n. Please try v2.23. I added a time-out and the profiler now logs the slowest pattern to the console.\n. The Chrome driver didn't have an upper limit for HTML length like the Firefox version does which is likely at least part of the issue. Lifehacker's homepage is 120Kb which is now being reduced to 50Kb by cutting out a middle part of the page.\nPlease test v2.24.\n. Yeah it's odd. I don't see what particularly bad about that pattern.\n. No matter what the pattern is it always comes up as the slowest. If I remove it completely the next pattern is reported as the slowest. It looks like it slows down after a certain number of evaluations, perhaps garbage collection?\n. We can use Chrome's profiler as well.\n\n. I don't think blacklisting is really a solution, we should be able to fix the actual issue. Adding a limit to the number of expression evaluated and a time-out will go a long way.\n. Ohh is it Christmas already?\n. The HTML patterns are slow. We can probably speed a lot of them up by only looking in <head>, especially when looking at <meta> and <link> tags.\n. It doesn't. There is some room for improvement but it won't make much difference. E.g. if PHP is already detected it will need to run 999 patterns instead of 1,000.\n. Well spotted, the driver got instantiated in two places. Fixed in Git.\n100% Performance improvement, not bad. :)\nIf you want to test it, here's how to run the dev version of Wappalyzer:\nhttps://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/wiki/Drivers#google-chrome\n. Thanks!\n. Working for me as well, Chrome and Firefox.\n. Thank you!\n. Wappalyzer already detects SPDY. Do you have any examples of sites that use SPDY but Wappalyzer doesn't pick it up?\n. In Chrome you need to click \"Analyze headers\". It's possible it's not working properly though.\n. I think it has been added after OP requested it.\n. Thanks!\n. That's a good point, we should convert header names to lowercase before comparing.\n. Thanks! What was the reason for removing the Gravatar env pattern?\nAlso FYI, the period in the Google Charts patterns should be escaped.\n. Thanks a lot!\nI believe they do, although it may be specific to WordPress or some other implementation.\n. Nice one! Thanks.\n. Thanks for that!\n. It's not always possible to work out what language or framework is in use. It's running the Apache web server so I assume it's not .NET. PHP would be my guess.\n. Thank you!\n. That would certainly be possible but I feel that's a bit out of the scope of what Wappalyzer does. It will be a lot more work to maintain when we start adding detections for themes and plugins.\n. WooCommerce has been added.\n. Perhaps in the future, it's a fair bit of work and I'm not sure what the demand would be. For now datasets are for sale.\n. Great, thank you!\n. Sorry for the late reply. Perhaps @perchouli can answer your question, I didn't work on the Python driver myself.\nI'm not sure I understand your question though.\n. Care to comment, @perchouli? :)\n. Thank you!\n. This looks great, I'm not sure about the \"confidence\" change though.\n. Github says it can't be merged, could you update it to the current HEAD? Otherwise I'll attempt to merge it manually.\n. Merged, thank @gadcam. :)\n. Agreed. :)\n. Yes, PHP is currently unable to interpret JavaScript on websites. I think the best server-side solution will be to create a http://phantomjs.org/ driver.\nSee some of the previous discussions:\nhttps://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/issues/104\nhttps://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/issues/157\nhttps://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/issues/277\n. Thank you!\n. Fair enough, I'll mention both.\n. Updated.\n. Thank you!\n. Yeah, this has come up before (1, 2). You could ask @mlconnor if he made any progress.\n. It looks like someone took it on themselves to build it:\nhttps://github.com/mlconnor/phantalyzer\n. I finally started working on a PhantomJS driver.\nhttps://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/tree/master/drivers/phantomjs\n. The PhantomJS driver is now fully functional.\n. Good point, I made the timeout value configurable per driver.\nhttps://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/commit/68cd25bf99c2846d3a446d2b5722d3a43c727b21#L3R133\n. Thank  you!\n. Do you have a suitable 16x16 image? Perhaps just a green letter \"O\"?\n. Looks good, please convert it to PNG (transparent background if you can) and add it as share/images/icons/Ophal.png. I'll then merge your changes.\n. Perfect, thanks!\n. I'm afraid this would mostly match Polish websites? :)\n. Wappalyzer matches the URL including the hostname, it's useful to detect the platform in cases like \"myblog.wordpress.com\" and \"myblog.blogger.com\".\n. I don't think Firefox always appens a slash, e.g. \"example.pl?x=y\" would match.\n. Thanks again!\n. Thanks!\nThe url is only matched with the URL that appears in the address bar which isn't very useful in this case. It will identify scripts and other static content hosted on the CDN as AlloyUI when you view them directly, not when they appear on the page.\n. Thank you.\n. Thanks!\n. That's actually not how I'd like CDN detection to work. You could embed a static resource (e.g. image) from a different website in which case the CDN should not be reported. Wappalyzer doesn't analyse the headers of static resources anyway so I don't think your change would work the way you describe it?\n. Thanks!\n. Do you have an example of a website that uses it?\n. Like WP Super Cache, Quick Cache adds comments outside the HTML code which Wappalyzer can't access. Once we find a way to do this I'll rivisit this, for now I'm closing the issue. Thanks for the suggestion.\n. Thanks!\n. Nice find, we definitely need to implement this.\n. With WebExtensions, this doesn't apply any more.. Implemented in 74bb8fa56aec8a9692bbdc5c086b957ff4950e5c. Looks like there is still a case for it.. Thats looks great! I updated the Wiki. You should be able to edit pages.\nI noticed ZAP uses Apache Licence 2.0 which doesn't appear to be compatible with GPL3. Will you be able to distribute apps.json with a different license?\n. I'm no expert either. I think the main difference is that the GPL requires you to distribute the source code. It's great when others use my code but I'd like to pull any improvements they make back upstream.\nSince you built the port from the ground up I don't consider it derived work so feel free to use any license. I might add a license notice in apps.json and you could copy that, or include this  file in extensions/wappalyzer/resource. It may be less confusing to license the entire extension GPL v3 though.\nBy the way, you can use Wappalyzer's locales to map the category slugs to names:\nhttps://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/blob/master/drivers/chrome/_locales/en/messages.json\nIf you like you can link the application and category names to their respective pages on wappalyzer.com where their stats can be viewed.\n. Thanks for the pull request! I just merged #373 which seem to do the same thing with fewer code changes.\n. Yeah, agreed.\n. Wappalyzer looks for the X-Firefox-Spdy response header, which PHP would be able to detect. It looks like Google only returns that header when a Firefox user agent is sent though. You could try changing the user agent in the PHP driver to something like Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:26.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/26.0.\n. Not much can be done then it seems.\n. The issue has been fixed in 2.7.4:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wappalyzer/versions/?page=1#version-2.7.4\nThanks for reporting the issue! I'll leave it open for now so others can see it.\n. @gadcam Added it, thanks.\n. Cheers!\n. This should be fixed now.\n. Thanks!\n. Thank you!\n. Thanks. :)\n. Well that was fast. Thanks and congrats on your first PR merge. :)\n. Icon was missing, I added it in ae28a75881ed636e498920025aedbde8d5d25705.\n. Cheers, I already added the icon.\n. Although not perfect, this is working as intended. See my comment here: https://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/issues/290#issuecomment-17751156.\n. I reopened it.\n. Nice catch, thanks for the PL!\n. We usually pluck the favicon of the application's website. These are almost always 16x16 although some have higher resolutions available. I'd like to start collecting bigger versions but right now we only have the small icons.\n. https://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/tree/master/share/images/icons-32\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Cheers!\n. Do you have an example URL where GA is being identified incorrectly?\n. Thank you!\n. Thank you!\n. Not sure how I missed this one, thanks for the PL!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks! Please remove the http:// prefix from the website URL and I'll merge it in.\n. Thanks again!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thank you! :)\n. Thanks!\n. Escaping them won't break anything.\n. Thank you!\n. \u00a1Muchas gracias!\n. Thanks!\nI noticed you added a couple of applications, can you add icons for them as well?\n. Excellent, thanks again.\n. Had to do a manual merge for this one. Cheers.\n. I haven't seen this happen and I use Piwik on all my sites, including wappalyzer.com. Would you mind sharing the address of your website?\n. Nice find @gadcam, it looks like the ticket has had a couple of responses recently.\n. It looks like Firefox won't let us hack the URL bar anymore. I started working on 3.0.0 using the Firefox Add-on SDK which will be very similar to the Chrome version (toolbar button with a panel):\nhttps://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/tree/master/drivers/firefox-sdk\nThe API is a lot nicer and Wappalyzer will finally be restartless.\n. Here you go: https://wappalyzer.com/wappalyzer.xpi\n. Is it not already in your toolbar? I'm testing with 29a2 (Aurora).\n. The XPI has been updated with some more functionality.\n. @mlacunza It's a different issue, please install v2.7.8:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wappalyzer/versions/?page=1#version-2.7.8\n. @mlacunza Can you please create a new issue, it's unrelated to this one. If you like you can try 3.0.0: https://wappalyzer.com/wappalyzer.xpi.\n. Ok great.  Wappalyzer 3 should be done before FF 29 is released.\n. I prefer separate tickets, thanks.\n. Marking this one as fixed.\n. Thanks! The small icon should also be renamed in that case.\n. Looks alright to me. :)\n. Perfect thanks!\n. Thanks.\n. Wappalyzer doesn't work that way unfortunately, we need something identifyable on the page that the user sees. It doesn't have to be HTML, it could be a response header, cookie, javascript variable or URL segment.\n. Do you know if this is actual server software? It may be that your host simply changed the name of Apache or Nginx.\n. Do you have a larger version of the image? The Perl logo is a camel, your icon seems to be something different.\n. Something like this one perhaps. We need 32x32 icons but this should look better as 16x16 as well.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/1IdW4Nj.gif\nHere's the full sized original logo.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/yB1w6pK.jpg\n. Yeah that one looks much better, cheers.\n. Please try reinstalling it, I updated the bookmarklet recently.\nhttp://wappalyzer.com/bookmarklet/\n. Please try it again now, the CSS file was missing. Note that the bookmarklet doesn't work on pages served over HTTPS at the moment.\n. Both work for me as well.\n. Wappalyzer uses the method @Semyazz describes. You can see the pattern here:\nhttps://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/blob/master/share/apps.json#L985\nThis means that Wappalyzer can't detect the OS unless the server reveals this information.\nThis means that \n. Thanks!\n. It looks like something went wrong with your pull request:\n1 changed file with 4,925 additions and 3,082 deletions.\nPerhaps your editor automatically reformatted the file?\n. Thanks!\n. Fixed, thanks.\n. I'll repeat what I said in an email earlier but I'm happy to have a discussion about this.\nWhat I like about the SDK version:\n- The new API is much cleaner\n- The add-on is now pretty much identical to the Chrome version\n- You can choose where to place the icon\n- It's less intrusive\n- Mozilla encourages the new style\nI also really like the new panel, I'm not sure if it can be used in the URL bar. I don't like the idea of having a setting to switch between both options.\n. @gadcam, @q-- What do you think?\n. The Chrome version has always had a single icon and now has more users than the Firefox version. I've never been asked to make the Chrome version look like the Firefox version which tells me it's just a matter of being used to it. Previous changes have confused/annoyed users as well but that settles after a while, I'm not too worried about it.\nI dislike the idea of having both options, the addon should be simple. Let's explore what's involved though. I don't think the new panel will work in the address bar which means having to build fiddly context menus again.\nAlso, I think that it gets a little obnoxious when Wappalyzer displays 10+ icons in the address bar. The current icon show the most important app, which is usually the CMS or e-commerce platform.\n. Alright, I added the URL bar icons back. The panel still works but I can't attach it to the URL bar so it sits in the top right corner. There is a setting to turn the URL bar icons off.\nMozilla says changing the browser chrome this way is a \"feature\" that may stop working at some point (https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2011/08/17/panel-anchoring-follow-up/).\nPlease test https://wappalyzer.com/wappalyzer.xpi and tell me what you think.\n. Right now clicking between icons doesn't open the panel, I need to wrap them in an element that serves as a click target before adding more spacing.\n. The new version has been published, with icons in the address bar. Thanks everyone for joining the discussion.\n. The add-on bar will be removed in future versions of Firefox. The new API allows for \"widgets\" and \"panels\" which is what's implemented in Wappalyzer 3.\nhttp://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/29.0a2/auroranotes/\n. Wappalyzer 2 had an option to show all the icons in the add-on bar.\n. Thank you!\n. I fixed this today, try reinstalling from https://wappalyzer.com/wappalyzer.xpi.\n. Thank you!\n. Cheers. :)\n. I added it back, the numbers are a bit out of wack at the moment though. This should correct itself within a couple of days.\n. It's not that straight-forward, the graph takes into account the number of total detections so all the graphs don't go up on a busy day. If Wappalyzer has more users the number of detections goes up even though the app isn't any more popular. I have a simple algorithm in place to deal with that but it means points on the graph no longer relate to a specific number.\n. There is room for improvement but I'm not sure maintaining a list of TLDs is that great, especially now that ICANN is auctioning custom TLDs. On the other hand we're letting a lot of fake TLDs through now which is probably worse. Also, would we allow darknet TLDs? .onion, .bit, .free etc?\nAlthough I agree they're perfectly valid I'm not interested in showing IP addresses on the website.\n. Applications are always detected, the regular expression is only used to determine what to track. It should match the entire URL as I don't want to track \"example.com/admin\" or \"example.com/demo\". It should be case insensitive though.\n.

I'll see if I can get the page to open in the background. In Chrome you can also turn this option off completely.\n. Fixed in the next update.\n. Thanks!\n. Thank you!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks @jhewt, I'll apply @q--'s suggestions.\n. Thanks!\nA 32x32 icon is required, we can use this:\n\n. Cheers. :)\n. I'd say it's a programming language. Compiling the JavaScript is essentially just a polyfill.\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. Thanks! Don't worry, I love PRs.\n. Probably the best way is to run Wappalyzer locally, instructions here:\nhttps://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/wiki/Drivers\nIf an expression fails the whole add-on usually stops working, with errors in the console (Chrome, inspect \"background.html\" from about:extensions) or terminal (Firefox).\n. It can no longer be merged automatically, I'll try to do it manually.\n. Merged, thanks!\n. Nice one, thanks!\n. Thanks for the pull request!\n. Thanks. :)\n. Thanks again!\n. Fixed in 9864e7b161668dffb2c808d80e120dd92d10e30e.\n. It shows RiteCMS 2.1.0 for me in Firefox 30.\n. \n. This is because the server-side drivers don't (can't) evaluate JavaScript on web pages. The browser drivers look for JavaScript variables which results in a lot more detections.\n. @perchouli Any idea?\n. @q-- Perhaps that's because of your browser cache (i.e. 304 Not Modified). I'm definitely seeing Nginx:\n\n. I never really looked too closely at the Python driver code but it doesn't appear to scan response headers at all, which is why Nginx is not detected.\n. I'm not sure why this happens, the position of the panel is specified as a top-right offset. It looks like a Firefox bug but I don't have a secondary monitor to test it myself.\n. https://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/blob/master/drivers/firefox/lib/driver.js#L100\n. Or this one. Not exactly the same but related to panels and dual monitors: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=955918\n. Does this happen in Firefox 29 and/or 30?\n. Click the icons. :)\nI'll look into updating the tooltip to show the actual application names.\n. Fixed in 3.0.2, thanks.\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wappalyzer/versions/?page=1#version-3.0.2\n. This is the right place, thanks. Fixed in 9fbd28a9ab11fa16e1d0c5c1af6a4bcf079e514c.\n. Thanks! Glad to see you're still updating this driver. :)\nInstead of linking the scripts in share it would be better if the Python driver had it's own copy of the files (using links.sh or links.cmd).\nAlso does the driver look for response headers at all? It doesn't look like it does (see #477).\n. Thanks!\n. I think this is just GitHub hiding what server is actually serving those pages (e.g. it could be Nginx). I prefer not to add this as a server unless I can actually download it somewhere and use it myself.\n. Fixed in 3.0.2, thanks.\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wappalyzer/versions/?page=1#version-3.0.2\n. Thanks!\n. You're right, I'm removing the .*rhel pattern. Thanks for the bug report!\n. You can move Wappalyzer to a toolbar button in the settings (about:addons -> Wappalyzer -> Preferences).\nThe addon bar is being removed in Firefox 29.\n. You can disable icon in the URL bar and add Wappalyzer as a toolbar icon (in about:addons -> Wappalyzer -> Preferences).\nYou may need to upgrade to 3.0.2 for it to work properly though.\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wappalyzer/versions/?page=1#version-3.0.2\n. Icon: \n. Thanks!\n. Wonderful. :)\n. This has been added in 3.0.2:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wappalyzer/versions/?page=1#version-3.0.2\n. I responded in the other issue, it looks like a Firefox bug.\n. Cheers. It's because the website displays the URLs without http://, and then prefixes it in the link.\n. Great, thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Wappalyzer only looks for the Server header. If that's not present Wappalyzer won't identify Nginx.\nYou're right about the cache!\n. Great, thanks!\n. Thank you!\n. Thanks!\n. Cheers!\n. Thanks!\n. Do you have a 32x32 PNG image for both?\n. Thanks @mrinc. It's still not complete correct but I'll change it on my end. (?M\\.R\\. Inc Inc Webserver) should be M\\\\.R\\\\. Inc Inc Webserver.\n. Can you bring up the console (Ctrl+Shift+J) and search for \"wappalyzer\" to see if any errors come up?\n. Does upgrading to Firefox 29 help?\n. http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/beta/\n. Oddly that's working fine for me too.\n. Fixed in 3.0.9, apparently the add-on needs \"private browsing\" permissions in this scenario.\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wappalyzer/versions/?page=1#version-3.0.9\nNice find @ehqhelp, thanks!\n. Thanks. :)\n. Thanks again!\n. Cheers!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks, fixed in 35f032840eb712d8977ad32c9ab1f235903ba70e!\n. Thank you!\n. Merged manually, thanks.\n. Thanks, I fixed this one already. :)\n. Firefox will be removing the add-on bar in the next version. Wappalyzer has been updated to use the new APIs.\n. As of Firefox 29 there is no status bar. I'm not sure how it Pentadactyl will work. You can still place the Wappalyzer toolbar button anywhere you like but it will only be a single icon (which you appear to have already).\n. Try Firefox 29. The add-on bar is no longer there.\nhttp://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/beta/\n. Awesome, thank you!\n. Yes, this is by design. It's using Firefox's \"widget\" and \"panel\" APIs which allow for a single icon with a panel. To have all icons displayed Wappalyzer needs to sit in the URL bar.\n. Fixed in aea6135586e3c64c2fe483ac67cef5906217dc80, thanks.\n. Thanks!\n. @gadcam @q-- Can I get your opinion? A JavaScript variable called head might result in a lot of false positives. I'm also not sure if JSON should be included, perhaps for the same reason we don't identify XML or HTML. It's a protocol, not something you install.\n. No that won't work unfortunately.\n. @q-- You're right, detection explicitely doesn't happen unless the page's Content-Type is text/html. Detecting JSON this way won't work.\n. Small nitpick, the groups can be made non-capturing and the .min optional like this:\nhead\\\\.(?:core|load)(?:\\\\.min)?\\\\.js\n. Thanks! :)\n. Sure, do you want to create another PR?\n. The Wiki might help:\nhttps://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/wiki/Specification\nJust append \\\\;confidence:50 to the pattern. \n. Awesome, thank you!\n. Thanks. I came up with a better quality icon:\n\n. Also, please keep the apps in alphabetical order and use tabs for indentation. Fixed in 05fa4326c8a390cab0cfca36c928e0c76345be9f.\n. I have added the empty directories instead.\n. It's probably better to add \"excludes\": \"TYPO3 CMS\" to TYPO3 Neos.\n. It should work regardles of order. If it doesn't then that's something that needs to be fixed!\n. Thanks!\n. Release schedule? I use this. :)\nhttp://www.random.org/dice/?num=2\n. I just did a Firefox release yesterday, which will take a few days to be approved. Usually I wait until I have a bunch of changes or a fix that needs to go out straight away.\n. Thanks for the fix!\n. The Firefox version used to listen to onload events but it was a performance killer. Especially on JavaScript heavy sites like Google Drive and Outlook. Right now Wappalyzer waits exactly one second after a page loads and scans JS variables once.\n. It does that already, plus another second of waiting.\n. Nice work, thanks!\nGit does a merge-commit when you pull.\n. The .* pattern is too loose, I prefer (\\\\.min)? in cases where .min is known to be used.\n. Thanks. :)\n. I think only Rails, Ruby, D3, GA and jQuery are true. It's definitely a sign the patterns are too loose (e.g. matching plain text instead of HTML).\n. Thanks!\n. I rewrote half the driver (b2cd820f169f31534b73f80b1dc0f285a848939c), it should work now. \nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wappalyzer/versions/?page=1#version-3.0.10\nSwitching between the URL bar and toolbar button when you have multiple windows open is still broken. I haven't figured out how to get the actual XUL window object from the SDK window object. Firefox also doesn't like having two different toolbar buttons from the same addon in different windows.\n. Cheers!\n. You can kind-of do this with confidence, i.e. 50 for both which will add up to 100 if they are both present.\nIf we're going to start tracking GitHub pages we may need to add a category, i.e. \"web hosts\" or \"hosting platforms\" and add others such as Google App Engine and Heroku. I don't think it qualifies as a CDN or web server.\nPaging @q-- and @gadcam. Opinions?\n. You're right, it would be shown as 50%. Negative confidence doesn't make much sense, it would still display the GitHub pages icon. We could hide in that case but it still seems like a hack.\nWe'd need to define some rules for hosting providers, I don't want to start tracking shared hosts like DreamHost etc.\n. Fair enough, I think anything below 50% can be hidden.\n. I'm pretty sure the minus sign causes the pattern to fail and return null, Wappalyzer core will need to be updated first.\nAlso, you want to use the Add-on SDK instead of manually updating the XPI.\n. Do you have a link for us?\n. Can you have a look at the response headers? Ctrl+Shift+I for dev tools; network tab; headers.\nThe mod_ssl pattern is pretty basic, it shouldn't be picked up unless it's in the server string: \nhttps://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/blob/master/share/apps.json#L1883\n. Cheers. :)\n. Thanks!\n. I just ran the importer:\nhttps://wappalyzer.com/applications/fireblade\nI'll need to deploy updates of the browser extensions before you'll see any data though. I do this once in a while.\n. Thanks. :)\n. We can use this icon:\n\n. It doesn't look like there is usable environment variable, just like Underscore.\n. Thanks!\n. I can't reproduce this either in Firefox 31. After a restart and page refresh:\n\n. console.log Is only called from this wrapper function (see calls to w.log throughout the file):\nhttps://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/blob/master/drivers/firefox/lib/driver.js#L312\nPerhaps the content script is interfering somehow, it grabs the keys of the window object:\nhttps://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/blob/master/drivers/firefox/data/js/content.js#L23 \n. What if you clear out content.js completely? Or if you remove w.init() from exports.main so it won't run at all?\n. Good to hear, thanks!\n. Thanks. :)\n. Thank  you.\n. The database was having issues, I took it down to restore a backup. Unfortunately importing a billion rows takes a little while. :)\n. Thanks!\n. That may be an issue specific to the previous version. However there is still a bug where if you have two windows open and change the URL bar setting, both instances get added to both windows. Perhaps it's related, I haven't found a solution for it yet.\n. Wappalyzer reports Joomla 1.5 for me on that website.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. You're right, I should deploy both at the same time and run the importer on the website. When this is done it takes a few days for stats to show up.\n. Thank you!\n. Thanks @ikkez. The other issue now has a reference to this so I'll close this one.\n. I can't easily validate it without merging first. I find issues like these fast enough after a pull though. I'd like to have a validator that actually identifies which line the error was found.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks! That was definitely a bug.\n. Thanks. :)\n. Here's how you can test your code changes:\nhttps://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/wiki/Drivers\nI've added your cookie detection, thanks!\n. Added, thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. @craiglondon Did you mean to submit a pull request?\n. That's actually a snippet of old code that doesn't need to be there anymore. If you scroll down to the \"Live intercept headers using webRequest API\" comment you'll find the code that captures response headers.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks.\n. Thanks!\n. It is, but I can't merge it automatically because the other pull request changed these lines. Do you want to amend this PR? Otherwise I'll do it manually.\n. Thanks a lot!\n. Thanks, this is now fixed. I did it a little different though.\n. Looks like this is a Chrome issue:\nhttps://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=377278\nAre you running the latest version of Chrome?\n. I'm having trouble merging your changes, it looks like your fork isn't up-to-date with the latest.\n. Others have reported the same but I don't believe it's something we can fix. Wappalyzer uses Firefox' \"widget\" API, which takes care of the positioning.\n. Thanks!\n. Github still won't let me merge automatically. I'll have to see if a manual merge is easier this time.\n. Well only apps.json has changed. Last time the diff showed countless changed lines. I'm not at my home computer right now so I can't say where the conflict is.\n. There were still conflicts but I resolved them manually. If you can, please submit modifications separately from additions. Thanks!\n. That's not neccesary for these changes, I merged them manually.\n. Ah you're right, the changes are in now though.\n. Thank you!\n. Thanks for the pull request!\nA few comments:\n- The applications are listed alphabetically. Can you please insert your entry in the right place?\n- Please add a 32x32 PNG image, or a link to a logo that we can use to create one.\n- A better pattern might be <link[^>]+(?:([\\\\d.])+/)?pure(?:-min)?\\\\.css\\\\;version=\\\\1 (more accurate and version detection, not tested).\n. The version detection is optional, it will still work if the version number isn't there.\nAn icon based on their favicon: \n\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Added, thanks!\n. Have you tested this? The version detection won't work with the updated headers regex.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. https://wappalyzer.com/applications/nepso\nIt's there now.\nThanks for noticing @q--, there was definitly a problem. The graphs haven't updated for a couple of months. :S\n. The diff only shows \"Solodev\", which I merged manually (looks like I may not have pushed it up). Is this what you meant to do?\n. I think so. But I'll merge this one anyway, thanks. :)\n. Thanks!\n. Fixed.\n. If you deselect \"Display icons in URL bar\" in the settings you can place Wappalyzer in a toolbar as a single icon.\n. Correct. :P\n. Do you feel strongly about having the icon in the URL bar rather than next to it? I'm not sure if it's worth maintaining an extra feature for what I consider a minor change.\n. It's not random, the application that is considered the most important is displayed. E.g. if a CMS and a video player is detected, the CMS is displayed.\n. Perhaps we can add an option to show 1, 5, 10 or all icons. Some websites have an awful lot of widgets which take up a lot of space in the address bar.\n. This has been fixed in code but not yet released.\n. I had to run the importer for this to update. Cheers.\n. Fixed, thanks\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Fixed in 978a882bdb536aa5a130a3b9c6251cca5c0960b3.\nOnly one instance of each back reference was replaced.\n. Thanks!\n. Awesome, thank you!\n. Thank you!\n. Great, thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thank you!\n. Thanks!\n. Thank you!\n. Thought I merged this already, thanks!\n. Bedankt!\n. Thanks!\n. Thank you!\n. I don't think we can use the env variable, minified (unrelated) code is likely to use the same.\nThis pull request also includes OpenStreetMap, but not the icon.\n. Cheers!\n. Yes, implies should only be used when it's certain the application is present.\nThe JSON is invalid (curly brackets instead if square brackets). Please test before submitting a pull request.\nI also feel the HTML pattern might be too broad. I'd love to include Open Streetmap though, can we come up with a more specific pattern?\n. env only tests for methods on the window object, chaining doesn't work (you can test for openlayers but not for openlayers.layers.OSM).\n. Thanks! \n. Thanks!\n. Fittingly long and complicated expressions for this one. :P\n. Cheers. :)\n. You're right, looks like tab.js was a leftover from the old version.\n. Thanks. :)\n. Thanks!\n. Thank you!\n. Thanks!\n. Cheers. :)\n. Thank you.\n. Thanks. I always look at the diff before merging so I'm not sure how I stuffed this one up.\n. Thank you!\n. Cheers. :)\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Fantastic, thank you for going through that!\n. I have added an icon.\n. Thanks!\nMarket share goes down as more applications are added so it's not the best indicator of growth.\n. Thanks!\n. Can you please add a 32x32 PNG icon?\n. Thank you!\n. I have added a Tag Manager category, would you like to submit a pull request to add these applications?\n. The server side drivers don't pick up on some of the JavaScript libraries (the env fields aren't evaluated). There isn't much that can be done about it, you basically need a browser for this.\n. Thanks!\n. It is by design, listening for DOM changes and re-scanning the page results in extremely poor performance.\n. Sure, happy to update the wiki.\n. Thank you!\n. I don't want to remove the version detection from GA. As @q-- says the problem has already been fixed even though it's still present in the last release. You already submitted a pull request for Moguta.CMS, if you can submit Eleanor CMS and SyntaxHighlighter separately I'm happy to merge them.\n. Thank you!\n. Merged manually, thanks!\n. I have added a \"Paywalls\" category (43). Thanks!\n. Perfect, thank you.\n. The Firefox version used to have this feature, I'm happy to have this added back in.\n. Continued in #864.\n. Thanks!\n. Hi Anne,\nThe number of detections displayed on the website is by no means comprehensive; it's the number of sites that have been visited by Wappalyzer users in the past six months. As a result the number only includes active sites but definitely not all of them.\nWappalyzer does not check for the existence of certain files on website directly so we can't implement the snippet your team provided.\nCurrently Wappalyzer only looks for the \"generator\" meta tag to identify CMSMS:\nhttps://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/blob/master/share/apps.json#L521\nThere is a bit more information on how Wappalyzer works in the wiki. Your team may be able to come up with some code to improve detection (e.g. HTML, JS variables, response headers etc.).\nhttps://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/wiki/Specification\n. Thanks!\n. Cheers. :)\n. Thanks!\n. Can you re-submit the icon as 32x32?\n. Yes!\n. Can you re-submit the icon as 32x32?\n. Thank you!\n. Thank you!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks everyone, I pushed an update with @q--'s fix. I'll leave this open for now for visibility.\n. Noted, thank you. :)\n. The apps on the website link to the latest versions automatically.\n. Oh I see, I'll run the importer again.\n. Thanks!\n. Can you please re-submit the image as 32x32? :)\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Excellent. :)\n. Cheers. :)\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Merged this one manually, thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. querySelectorAll won't work in the server side drivers. Can't we just use decodeURIComponent?\n. I think simply replacing &amp;, &gt;, &lt, &quot;, &apos and &#039 will catch 99% of HTML encoded characters. Simliar to PHP's htmlspecialchars(). This way we can do it in core rather than updating the drivers.\n. Thank you. :)\n. Thanks!\n. Thank you!\n. Thanks!\n. I removed the duplicate file and pushed an update (v2.35). Did that fix the issue?\n. I removed wordpress.com from the site.\n. I'm actually not sure why wordpress.com has it's own entry, rather than just WordPress, so I'm removing it. I appreciate the pull request though!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Excellent, thank you!\n. Thank you!\n. Added.\n. Wappalyzer is no longer using the widget module.\n. Fixed, thank you.\n. Thank you!\n. Thanks again!\n. Your pull request couldn't be merged automatically for some reason so I did a manual merge. Thanks!\n. Forcing case sensitivity might help here. Every regex is case insensitive by default, perhaps we can add a flag to negate this, e.g. \"env\": \"^Mage$\\\\;c\". Or perhaps env should always be case senstive.\n. Sure, but instead of matching 4^2 = 16 possible combinations in this case it will only match one.\n. Both fixed, thank you.\n. Thanks a lot!\n. The bookmarklet has been updated on the website.\nhttps://wappalyzer.com/download\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks for the pull request!\nCan you please add a 32x32 PNG icon to share/images/icons, called \"petrojs.js.png\"? With a transparent background if possible.\nThe applications are listed alphabetically in apps.json. If you can, please move it to the right place rather than appending it to the file.\n. Can you update the pull request or submit a new one? This one hasn't been updated yet.\n. I'm actually not sure how we ended up with two Python drivers. The drivers are supposed to use wappalyzer.js as their core rather than reimplement it. The python_raw \"driver\" is really a port and should probably be a separate repository.\nIf you would like to fork it and remove it from this repository, please add it to the wiki for visibility:\nhttps://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/wiki/Unofficial-drivers-and-ports\n. That's fine, I have no objections to a Python port. I just want to avoid duplicating core functionality in this repository.\n. Thank you. Can you add the icon as well? :)\n. I'm still not seeing the icon. Can you perhaps post it here in the comments?\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Merged manually, thanks!\n. Thank you!\n. Thanks!\n. @tideman are you able to suggest an alternative pattern?\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thank you!\n. Thanks! Can you find a 32x32 icon?\n. Thank you very much!\n. Awesome. Let's try one big pull request. Note that I just did several merges so please do a pull first. :)\n. I'll remove that line from the wiki. Firefox used to have the option to turn categories on or off in the settings.\n. Wappalyzer only analyses the URLs you feed it. Which driver are you using?\n. You're using the Firefox driver. I got the impression you may have been using one of the server-side drivers (https://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/wiki/Drivers).\nI'm confused what you mean by \"downloaded 2000 files\" and hit counts on the server. Can you describe in more detail what you're doing?\n. Wappalyzer does not perform requests and does not analyse resource embedded in the page. It only analyses the page that has already been fetched by the browser. I can assure you the extension was not the cause of the many server requests.\n. Merged! Thank you so much. :) If you're making any amends please submit it as a new PR. I'll go through and see if I can update some of the icons.\n. > > You use array when not needed (L 309 - 315 - 316 - 531 - 937 - 1378 - 1497 - 1577\n\n\n1810 - 2559 - 3141 - 4158 - 4159)\n\nTrue. No strong reason behind; but I felt using arrays is more future-oriented. Any other opinions?\n\nI prefer no array purely for cosmetic reasons. It doesn't really matter though, Wappalyzer turns the string into an array before it evaluates the pattern.\n\nSo indeed a lot of existing \".*\" could be replaced with \"\". But I prefer that someone double-checks it first. What do you think, @ElbertF ?\n\nHa, clever. There is no reason why the empty string wouldn't work in any language. I like it, it probably performs better too.\n. Good idea, I'm all for it. Do you want to make a start?\n. @q-- Totally agree.\n@SebastianLopienski That would probably involve writing tests for individual applications. I don't think it's worth the overhead.\n. @chorsley Wappalyzer's basic profiler does log the slowest pattern to the console. I'm curious what regex caused it to hang!\n\n. Good idea!\n. We now have a Vagrant/Docker development environment. Running wappalyzer build or wappalyzer validate will point out any errors in apps.json.\n. Added a .editorconfig file as well.\n. One more update, the build script now validates the JSON against a schema, prettifies it and sorts all the keys alphabetically. I'd like to add some custom validation as well, e.g. to ensure HTML patterns can't match plain text.\n. You should be able to turn VT-x on in your BIOS, right? You can run all the scripts without Docker but you'll still need a VM with Linux (although Cygwin might work).\n. Otherwise you can just let Travis run the tests. :)\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks.\n. Thanks!\n. I may push a new version this weekend since there have been quite a few changes recently. Chrome should update pretty much immediately, Firefox's approval process can take a few days/weeks.\n. Thank you!\n. I realised the difference as well but Gadcam is right, it doesn't matter in most cases.\n. Thanks!\n. I missed that one, thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. The pattern is not specific enough I'm afraid. It will incorrectly identify Foundation on any website that uses \"columns\" in a div class.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. This sounds like an issue with the nightlies or the Extension Options Menu add-on. Wappalyzer uses the standard APIs provided by the Add-on SDK:\nhttps://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/blob/master/drivers/firefox/package.json#L13\nThere isn't much I can do to change the how preferences are handled and presented.\n. Nice, thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Nope.\n. Do the iframe's src attributes have any clues?\n. Fixed in f0870ee2eafc106f2b94b1093cdcb35310128e5e, thanks!\n. Cheers!\n. Wappalyzer uses multiple patterns to determine if an application is a Rails app. If only a single pattern is present there's a good chance it's Rails app but it's not 100% certain. If two or more are present the likelyhood is much greater.\nhttps://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/blob/master/share/apps.json#L3101\n. Thanks! Can you provide the icons in 32x32?\n. I don't believe there is anything we can do to fix this with the current version of the APIs, I'll keep #478 open though.\n. Thanks!\nI just noticed you're using spaces instead of tabs but I'll fix that locally.\nYou can also use non-capturing groups, i.e. (?:<script|<link)[^>]*sh(?:Core|Brush|ThemeDefault). It should perform somewhat better.\n. Unless we have a few more in the category you can use CMS or Miscellaneous for now. Perhaps even Database?\n. Cheers. :)\n. Thanks!\n. Sorry for the late reply, I wanted to review the code a bit more first. This looks great though, thanks!\n. Done. I still need to implement hiding results with a low confidence though.\n. You shouldn't need to escape slashes. Does the current pattern not work?\n. You're probably right about it being a more suitable place. pageAction doesn't support badges though so we'd lose that functionality.\nhttps://developer.chrome.com/extensions/browserAction\nhttps://developer.chrome.com/extensions/pageAction\n. Switched to pageAction in f08a5dde4d968ada145f82645275a6b9d5484877, cheers!\n. I looked at that but it doesn't seem possible without creating two versions of the extension unfortunately.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Updated in a6b91e0de26586dcde3bc1c6b53d13f5ae56f916, thanks.\n. Thanks!\n. Sounds good!\n. Wappalyzer only analyses the main request, mainly for performance reasons. It's not perfrect but most JS and CSS frameworks can be detected this way.\n. We may revisit this in the future but for now I'd like to stick with only analysing the main page. Perhaps there is a better way to look for computed CSS rules without scanning CSS files, like how we can look for JavaScript variables.\n. Thanks, but this isn't right. apps.json Is supposed to be in the drivers/php folder, running links.sh or links.cmd will copy it there.\n. Yep, but GitHub can't merge the pull request for some reason. I'll merge it manually when I have the time.\n. Merged manually, thanks!\n. Thanks! Looking for JS files in the HTML source would be useful for drivers that don't evaluate JavaScript, such as the PHP driver.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thank you!\n. No, that hasn't been implemented yet.\n. Thanks!\n. Fixed, thanks @q--.\n. Not for another few weeks, I usually wait until I have a bunch of changes lined up.\n. The current version is 1.9.32.3, I don't think the rest should be reported.\nhttps://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module/release_notes\n. Fine. I just published a new version. :)\n. Thanks, updated.\n. Pretty sure that an issue with Firefox and not something we can fix.` It doesn't happen for me on Firefox Developer Edition so they may have just fixed it.\n. Thanks!\n. Thank you!\n. Can't believe I hadn't already added this one, thanks. :)\n. Thanks for contributing! With a few exceptions (Woocommerce itself for instance) I prefer not to include plugins, considering there are so many and the most important information is the platform itself.\n. I fixed this locally but it looks like I forgot to push my changes. Your pull requests includes other files, probably not what you intended.\n. Thanks!\n. Is this about the PhantomJS driver or https://github.com/SLonoed/phantalyzer?\n. The official PhantomJS driver works fine with HTTPS:\nshell\n$ phantomjs driver.js https://wappalyzer.com\n[{\"url\":\"https://wappalyzer.com\",\"finalUrl\":\"https://wappalyzer.com\",\"application\":\"Drupal\",\"confidence\":100,\"version\":\"7\",\"categories\":[\"cms\"]},{\"url\":\"https://wappalyzer.com\",\"finalUrl\":\"https://wappalyzer.com\",\"application\":\"Highcharts\",\"confidence\":100,\"version\":\"3.0.9\",\"categories\":[\"javascript-graphics\"]},{\"url\":\"https://wappalyzer.com\",\"finalUrl\":\"https://wappalyzer.com\",\"application\":\"jQuery\",\"confidence\":100,\"version\":\"\",\"categories\":[\"javascript-frameworks\"]},{\"url\":\"https://wappalyzer.com\",\"finalUrl\":\"https://wappalyzer.com\",\"application\":\"Nginx\",\"confidence\":100,\"version\":\"1.6.2\",\"categories\":[\"web-servers\"]},{\"url\":\"https://wappalyzer.com\",\"finalUrl\":\"https://wappalyzer.com\",\"application\":\"PHP\",\"confidence\":100,\"version\":\"5.3.29\",\"categories\":[\"programming-languages\"]},{\"url\":\"https://wappalyzer.com\",\"finalUrl\":\"https://wappalyzer.com\",\"application\":\"Piwik\",\"confidence\":100,\"version\":\"\",\"categories\":[\"analytics\"]}]\n. Thanks!\n. I'd like to refine this pattern to not have .* in it. I'm removing it in the meantime. Do you have an example website that uses inline Bootstrap?\n. Great, thanks. I added it back in.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks.\n. Great, thanks!\nHow do you feel about using Gulp instead of Grunt? The config is cleaner and is supposed to be faster.\nI'm planning to have wappalyzer validate do much more than just validate the JSON against the schema. This means tests might pass on Travis but not pass validation. I guess Travis still adds some value but we're basically testing in two places.\n. I'm a fan of task runners but opted for shell scripts in this case (see here), they're a bit easier to do more complicated things with and have fewer dependencies. They're not very cross-platform but they don't need to be.\nOne of the things I would like to test is that the patterns are all valid regex, test the Wappalyzer specific fields (version and confidence), make sure the HTML patterns don't match plain text, etc.\n. @DaAwesomeP No, it shouldn't go in wappalyzer-validate. It's already in the Dockerfile, making jsonlint globally available in the development environment. If Travis needs it I think an include script is fine.\n. > Once you want to add regex testing and the other stuff, you will definitely need Gulp. I'm not sure its worth the trouble of parsing JSON in a shell script.\nI don't think we'd need Gulp, the shell script could run a JavaScript file through node to do the validation. I wouldn't use JSON schema or regex for this.\n. Ha, that would be amazing. It's a lot of overhead though.\n. Try apt-get install docker -y instead of apt-get install docker.io -y.\n. I agree that setting up Vagrant & Docker on every commit is probably a bit much. I wrote the shell scripts in a way that they can be run from outside the Docker environment, as long as the dependencies are installed. I don't mind having a setup script in two places, one for Docker and one for Travis.\n. Great. Should we perhaps keep it in .travis.yml? It's not a script anyone should run.\n. I'll have a look at the shell scripts, there may be a more elegant way to handle errors.\n. Excellent, thanks!\n. set -e seems elegant enough to catch errors. Done in ea1f3553cb644181761fd6fc262fb4a76d011c37.\n. Noticed that too, thanks. :)\n. I don't follow, can you rephrase?\n. That's what version control is for, why wouldn't you use Git for this?\n. I don't think this scenario is common enough to manually maintain a version number. Sometimes people work on different changes at the same time. Git is perfect for this.\n. Thanks!\nDo we need another .editorconfig? It's the same as the one in the root.\n. Thanks! Are you able to use a 32x32 icon?\n. Ah, you're right. The HTML pattern should have at least an HTML tag in it.\n. Transparent background, yes.\nDo you have an example website where that string appears?\n. The HTML pattern can be simplified: <a[^>]+Powered by Lithium\n. Fair enough, you can just add a space: <a [^>]+Powered by Lithium.\n. Cheers. :)\n. Thanks!\n. Cheers. :)\n. Github won't let me merge this, are you able to resolve the merge conflicts?\n. I removed assets/templates and assets/components and lowered the confidence for that pattern.\n. Great, thanks!\n. I think web/bundles is to broad a pattern. Other platforms might use the same folder structure and will be incorrectly identified as Symfony.\n. Thanks. I'd love to add Symfony but it's hard to fine a unique and accurate pattern.\n. Nice one, thanks. I'm going to refactor the JavaScript, some things I don't think we need to test for and the two functions are illegible. I like the idea of checking the icons.\nIf we're putting JavaScript in the bin folder it should have a shebang (#!/usr/bin/env node) so it can be called directly.\n. See d6debd16bbfaff3fcbd51efdb33195fd750c9505. I kept the mime type check but removed checking for extra files in the directory. You can now run \"wappalyzer validate-icons\" as a command. I moved the node_modules folder away, the bin folder should only contain commands.\n. Yeah, you're not wrong. My reasoning is that extra files don't break anything whereas missing files do. I also like to keep the shell scripts lean.\n. It's not picking up GA for me but I just made some changes to the pattern. Could it be possible that GA is used on another page on that website?\n. It's working for me in Docker and Travis. Try rebuilding with vagrant destroy -y && vagrant up. The $WAPPALYZER_NODE_PATH environment variable needs to be set.\n. I'm pushing my latest Docker image now, either build locally or try it in 10 minutes.\n\nSent from my phone\nOn 1 March 2015 4:25:12 pm LHDT, P THE AWESOME notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI destroyed/re-created the vagrant as well as updating my git and I\nstill have the problem:\n``` bash\nValidating apps.json...\nValidating regular expressions...\nValidating icons...\nmodule.js:340\n   throw err;\n         ^\nError: Cannot find module 'file-type'\n   at Function.Module._resolveFilename (module.js:338:15)\n   at Function.Module._load (module.js:280:25)\n   at Module.require (module.js:364:17)\n   at require (module.js:380:17)\nat Object.\n(/home/wappalyzer/synced/bin/wappalyzer-validate-icons:7:16)\n   at Module._compile (module.js:456:26)\n   at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:474:10)\n   at Module.load (module.js:356:32)\n   at Function.Module._load (module.js:312:12)\n   at Function.Module.runMain (module.js:497:10)\n```\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/issues/811#issuecomment-76575092\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Where do you see this happening? There should only occasionally be a request to wappalyzer.com, not on every page. There should never be a request to wappalyzer@crunchlabz.com. The latter is the add-on ID for Firefox and isn't used for anything.\n. Thanks!\n. Wappalyzer's icons are 16x16 (32x32 retina), chrome displays icons as 19x19 (38x38 retina). I don't believe there is way to define a specific size. Collecting new versions of every icon is not trivial.\n. See #1004.\n. Good as-is, thanks. :)\n. It's supposed to be in there, the Firefox version definitely has it. I'll find out what happened and push another version.\n. Thanks guys, both will be fixed in the next update.\n. The documentation hasn't changed. It's probably worth raising with the Chromium team?\n\nhttps://developer.chrome.com/extensions/pageAction\n. Thanks for reporting this here. I can't reproduce it in Linux or Windows 8.\n. It sounds like a Chrome bug. By design the API doesn't let extension affects the browser UI and this shouldn't be possible.\n. If you can, try Wappalyzer on a fresh Chrome installation. May be worth reporting to the Chromium team as well. Are you running a beta version by any chance?\n. That's good to know, I'll go ahead and close this one.\n. Results are cached for a while per domain. That way if an app can be detected on one page but not another, it will still be displayed. In most cases it's useful but can lead to odd results like this one.\n. It's intentional, see #765. The address bar is more suitable for extensions that show information about a page. From the documentation:\n\nUse the chrome.pageAction API to put icons inside the address bar. Page actions represent actions that can be taken on the current page, but that aren't applicable to all pages. \n. The Chrome API is purposely very restricted and doesn't let extensions affect the browser UI. There is a single line of code that adds Wappalyzer to the address bar, it's nothing unusual. It sounds like an issue with Chrome or your particular setup, it hasn't been reported by others.\n. You can untick \"Display icons in URL bar\" in the addon settings. This will add Wappalyzer as a single icon to the toolbar where you can move it around.\n. Depends what you mean, you already found the Github repository. The main file is this one:\n\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/apps.json\nYou can find more information in the wiki:\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/wiki\n. https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/wiki/Drivers#php\n. No, that's everything.\n. Try the PhantomJS driver instead of PHP. The PHP driver can't evaluate JavaScript on websites and therefore yields fewer results.\nYou can also use Docker:\nhttps://registry.hub.docker.com/u/wappalyzer/cli/\n. Look for the \"Detect version number\" comment in the setDetected function.\nVersion detection is part of the regular expressions. E.g. Drupal (\\d)\\\\;version:\\\\1 captures 8 in the string Drupal 8.\n. There's no reason to remove it though, especially since the generator meta tag includes version information. I'll fix the URL up.\n. Fixed in 0e5aaa44dcd181d473c7b5eaed513ae210986aab.\n. Thanks!\nIt may be better to split the HTML patterns up into an array.\nSome more work needs to be done to add a category. All locales need to be updated, even if it's not translated. The category also needs to be assigned a priority in the Chrome and Firefox drivers, perhaps we can add it between \"Marketing Automation\" and \"CDN\".\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/drivers/chrome/js/driver.js#L230\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/drivers/firefox/lib/driver.js#L438\n. Excellent, thank you.\n. That line can be deleted actually. I must have left it in there by accident.\n. I was planning on adding this, thanks!\n. Sorry, I didn't mean to close this one.\n. Thanks!\n. Although it's working as intended I agree it's a little misleading. We don't report C when a website is running on Linux.\n. We could perhaps visually distinguish between detected and implied applications.\n. What do you mean by full HTML checks? If it's in the DOM within a second of loading the page, Wappalyzer can read it.\n. Yes, very easy: \"html\": \"<[^>]+data-react\".\n. Fixed in 0b66239e3df844c4be871367a25b4157248f0fce.\n. Rails is picked up because of this: <meta content=\"authenticity_token\" name=\"csrf-param\" />.\n. Sure. I don't think we have any applications that fit this category currently, would you like to add them?\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks! Can you please rename the image to \"Penguin.png\" with a capital \"P\", it needs to match the application name exactly.\n. Thanks!\n. It makes sense to group results by category and sort them by application. We already have a priority list for categories to pick the main icon in the Chrome extension (i.e. CMS first, miscellaneous last).\n. Thank you!\n. It looks like something broke at TravisCI's end. :)\n. The thing with JavaScript variables is that the extension needs to index it first before searching through it. It would have to recursively go through the window object which holds hundreds of properties, each of which could also hold hundreds of properties. It would be more accurate but not better for performance.\nFor security, the only JavaScript Wappalyzer executes on a page is to get the list window properties. It doesn't call methods directly.\nWe also wouldn't remove the old method of detecting version numbers; the more the better (for accuracy).\nThe is a slight delay between a page load and the time Wappalyzer kicks in. This is to ensure it doesn't block loading of the page. 600 Expressions seems like a lot but I don't believe it's an issue at this point.\n. Content scripts have solved the security issue but I want to avoid executing arbitrary scripts on web pages so as not to break them. querySelector is definitely faster though, we should implement it.. In many different ways of course. The version of jQuery can be checked by executing jQuery.fn.jquery. Running that on a website that doesn't have jQuery installed will result in a type error. This example can easily be avoided but executing functions on pages can lead to unexpected results. For instance, it's unclear what happens when you run $() on a website, the function name is used by jQuery, Prototype and other frameworks.. It works the other way though, we gather the full list of variables first and then look for matches. Getting a list of variables and methods recursively is not practical.. We probably could. I've shied from executing more than a few lines of code in the context of web pages as any error will interfere with people's browsing. In most cases global variables are good enough.. Could be worth looking into, it's probably more efficient to check for the existence of properties then to run a regex over all of them.. I'm not against this idea, the Firefox add-on used to have this option. I do prefer sensible defaults over options however, it makes testing easier and keeps the code base lean. I wouldn't mind getting some more opinions on this.\n. Thanks!\n. Oh, right. Looks like this was copy/pasted from a diff? I'll fix it.\n. By looking at HTML source code, HTTP response headers, JavaScript variables and URLs. You can find the list of application signatures here:\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/apps.json\n. You're right, I was wondering why tha database has been so stable as of late... Should be fixed now. Well spotted, thank you.\n. Thanks!\n. Nice catch, fixed.\n. Thanks! Can you please provide a 32x32 icon?\n. Thank you. Do you have a 32x32 icon?\n. Thank you!\n. Either or.\n. Thanks!\n. Thank you.\n. Thanks, I couldn't work it out. Perhaps it was a BOM character?\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Great, thank you!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. I just pushed a new version.\n. :+1:\n. Thank you!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks! Let me know if you ever want to claim what we agreed on. :)\n. The spec has more information:\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/wiki/Specification\nLet me know if that doesn't answer your question.\n. Correct, the combined confidence value of any patterns that match. If a pattern matches which has no confidence value specified it defaults to 100%.\n. That's right, although it's capped at 100%. In the example when the header matches we're already 100% sure it's PHP. It makes more sense to use 50% for two patterns so that if we find both, we're confident we have a positive match.\n. A better example might be Ruby on Rails. If the Server header is found, Rails is reported as 50% sure. If the Server and X-Powered-By headers are found it's reported as 100% sure. If the csrf-param meta tag exists as well it's still 100% sure.\nIn the case of Apache Tomcat, if either or both of the headers are found it's reported as 100% sure.\n. Ah, right.\nApache-Coyote(/1\\\\.1)?\\\\;version:\\\\1?4.1+:\nThis is using a ternary operator. If \\\\1 (the first capture group) has any value, the version is reported as 4.1+. Otherwise the version number is blank.\n\\bTomcat\\b(?:-([\\\\d.]+))?\\\\;version:\\\\1\nThis is an exact match. If \\\\1 has a value, this value is reported as the version number.\n. It didn't pass the automatic validation, have a look at the Travis CI report. It returned the following:\nAvoid \".+\" and \".*\" in HTML patterns. Consider using \"[^>]+\" or \"[^<]+\" instead.\nThis is to keep pattern matching within a tag and avoid matching plain text.\n. The copyright notice is good enough, something like this will do:\n&copy; 20\\\\d{2} <a href=\"http://www\\\\.instructure\\\\.com\">Instructure</a>\nYou can match text outside tags. The reason .+ should be avoided is because it could match the entire page. I also prefer avoiding multi-line patterns for performance reasons.\n. Normally you'd be able to use the JavaScript variable (i.e. \"env\": \"^M$\"), however M is too short to be reliable. The snippet you posted isn't really usable with the current implementation.\n. Alright, let's try a newline. Something like <!\\\\[CDATA\\\\[\\\\n\\\\s*M\\\\.str = {\\\"moodle\\\". If you can, please make sure this pattern works without any other patterns.\n. Escape the double quotes (once). Also use non-capturing groups if you're not using backreferences, i.e. (?\\\"|') or a character set, i.e. [\\\"'].\n\"html\": \"<div class=[\\\"']dynamicDiv[\\\"'] id=[\\\"']dd\\\\.\\\\d\\\\.\\\\d[\\\"']>\",\n. Try installing lxc-docker instead. Are you using the latest version of Vagrant?\n. I'm also on Docker 1.6.2. If lxc-docker makes no difference, try Vagrant 1.7.2.\n. It's also possible to run the shell scripts directly. The Dockerfile shows you what's required, i.e. a couple of environment variables and some packages.\n. Cheers. :)\n. Thanks for the corrections!\n. Wappalyzer doens't scan static resources on a page. In some cases we could identify S3 by looking at the image URL, however embedding an image from a different site doesn't really count as 'using' S3.\n. Thanks!\n. To add a category the locales need to be updated, as well as references to categories in the drivers. We can probably add this one between 'Message Board' and 'Wiki' (order of importance).\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/tree/master/src/drivers/chrome/_locales\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/tree/master/src/drivers/firefox/locale\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/drivers/chrome/js/driver.js#L230\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/drivers/firefox/lib/driver.js#L438\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. It makes sense but I'm not a fan of the idea. Pushing builds is more reliable, makes it easier to deal with bug reports, probably more secure and there is no dependency on a website. I'm not sure how downloading images would work either, perhaps using localStorage?\n. I'll leave it open for further discussion, for now.\nI don't think it's a problem that the extensions are always a bit behind with apps.json. I could simply push releases more often but it doesn't matter that much.\n. Thanks Joost! I was actually reading your article on Magento SEO the other day. Greetings from a fellow Dutchie.\n. Substring matches are useful though, adding a ^ is the right solution here.\n. Thanks!\n. The build failed, can please add a 32x32 PNG icon?\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks. :)\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Nice one, thank you!\n. There is no official NPM package as of yet. I just signed up an account on npmjs.com but I haven't used it before.\n. Please email me at info at wappalyzer.com or elbert at alias.io. I'm not on Google +, Facebook et al.\n. Thanks!\n. Cheers. I don't think I'll ever grow tired of pull requests.\n. Thank you!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Not yet, I push out a new version every few weeks.\n. The tests failed on this one; all HTML patterns should have at least an opening or closing tag in them to prevent them from matching plain text. Instead of class you could have <[^>]+class, for instance.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. It's not working for me in either in Firefox 42.0.a2 (Developer Edition). I'm also unable to move it back to the address bar without restarting.\n. This should be fixed in 36a0ac90259877e400f0b3c86435b5b66037fc25. Can you please help me test by installing 3.1.0 from the following URL?\nhttps://wappalyzer.com/wappalyzer_firefox.xpi\n. If anyone else wants to test it, set xpinstall.signatures.required to false in about:config first in order to install unsigned add-ons.\n. @miynat Can you go into more detail? Can you verify you have 3.1.0 installed and say what does and doesn't work?\n. @miynat It's a big ask but if you could run Wappalyzer using the SDK we can have a look at the debug logs.\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/wiki/Drivers#mozilla-firefox\n. Right, I didn't know CFX was replaced with JPM. Please try again with the latest code.\n. @miynat Please see https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/issues/946#issuecomment-143390634.\n. Thanks!\n. Thank you!\n. Thanks!\n. Would this fit in 'Issue Trackers'? There is a bit more work involved in adding a new category.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Downscaling, say, 64x64 to 16x16 won't always looks great so we'd have to keep multiple sizes of icons. Currently we're simply loading <app name>.png, not sure how that would work with multiple sizes and/or filetypes. SVG icons would be ideal but I doubt we'd find many.\n. Let's continue this in #1004. We can start using 64x64 PNGs now and begin accepting SVGs after making the neccesary changes.\n. Thanks mate!\n. Merged, thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Awesome, thank you!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. If this is still happening, can you please clone this repository and start Firefox using the SDK: \nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/wiki/Drivers#mozilla-firefox\nThere may be a meaningful error message in the console to help me debug the issue.\n. @q-- I suspect apps.json is missing from src/drivers/firefox/data/. It's not in the repository, you need to copy it there or run the wappalyzer links command in a Linux environment (e.g. Vagrant).\n. That's a fairly big change for workaround that feels somewhat counterintuitive and I don't see being used much.\n. Awesome, thank you!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thank you.\n. Me too, thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks for catching that, again. I moved the website database and forgot to update a configuration file.\n. Merged offline in 61d5ffbcfe1b23625cb46be4fb9310047c4f41b9. I have commented out the validate-regex script for now until apps.json is actually passing the tests.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thank you!\n. Thank you.\n. Thanks! I'll change the capture group.\n. The website and extensions use encrypted connections, not sure what you mean by data being shared with AWS.\n. Yes, I know where it's hosted. :) \n@preovaleo You're right that they could get the private key pretty easily. At least it's stored on the disk and not in their key management service so they'd have to go through some effort to find it. Unfortunately this will always be the case unless you own the infrastructure, dedicated in-house servers aren't an option for me.\nWhat is dislike most about Google and the likes is their ability to correlate data. With Fiber, DNS, Chrome, Gmail, Analytics and Search they can create a pretty complete picture of a person's online behaviour. Using a different company for each service largely solves this problem.\n. The GA tracking calls have been removed a very long time ago, I just forgot to delete the ga.js file.\nI'm not sure if moving to a smaller host would address the issue. If you're worried about companies like AWS or Akamai receiving your IP address you should probably use a VPN or not use the Internet.\n. Duplicate of #703.\n. Thanks!\n. Fixed, thanks. Looks like this could happen when there was very little recent data, the table contained some stale information.\n. Thanks! Should the Ruxit script have a period in it?\n. I prefer to leave plugins (such as jquery-ui-tooltip) out of Wappalyzer. If you feel there is a popular library that's missing, please submit a pull request.\n. jQuery is usually detected by inspecting the window variable on the current page.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks Vicky. It looks like the tests are failing because the PNG is invalid. Are you able to update the file?\n. Ah, I just noticed the attachment. I'll fix up the icon.\n. I publish a new version every few weeks.\n. Great, thank you.\n. That's because not all strings have been translated.\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/drivers/firefox/locale/de-DE.properties\n. @q-- Is right that this is by design, Wappalyzer remembers which applications are used per hostname.\n. Please feel free to submit a pull request to remove it. Firefox used to have it too but I'm not actually using it anymore.\n. Like this?\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/wiki/Contributing\n. The wiki is also GitHub independent, it's just another repository that you can clone. I'm not opposed to having some documentation in the main repo but at least this way it's all in one place.\n. Which is mainly useful for source code documentation. In this case only the latest version of the documentation is valid.\n. I'm not sure what that means, we're using the latest version of the SDK. We do use some legacy code the get multiple icons into the address bar, I'm not quite ready to remove that yet.\n. I'm using Wappalyzer on Firefox with e10s enabled without issues.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. I'd be more in favour of including sample values that must pass validation. That way we can automate it. It would something like this:\njavascript\n{\n    \"apps\": {\n        \"1C-Bitrix\": {\n            \"cats\": [\n                1\n            ],\n            \"headers\": {\n                \"Set-Cookie\": \"BITRIX_\",\n                \"X-Powered-CMS\": \"Bitrix Site Manager\"\n            },\n            \"html\": \"(?:<link[^>]+components/bitrix|(?:src|href)=\\\"/bitrix/(?:js|templates))\",\n            \"tests\": {\n                \"html\": [\n                    \"src=\\\"/bitrix/templates/1c-bitrix-new/images/vlogo.png\\\"\",\n                    \"src=\\\"/bitrix/templates/1c-bitrix-new/images/16.png\\\"\",\n                    \"src=\\\"/bitrix/js/main/core/core_db.min.js?14328132264928\\\"\",\n                    \"href=\\\"/bitrix/js/main/core/css/core_image.min.css?14293595955405\\\"\"\n                ]\n            }\n            \"implies\": \"PHP\",\n            \"script\": \"1c-bitrix\",\n            \"website\": \"www.1c-bitrix.ru\"\n        },\n. @gadcam In the worst case scenario it will double the size of apps.json, adding 150KB. We could also strip out the tests in the build script.\n. It would be but last time I checked there isn't a way to do this.\n. Technically you could create a subfolder called HTTP, with a file called 2.png in it. :)\nI think HTTP2 is fine though.\n. I wasn't really serious about the subfolder hack, I don't think to will work on the website. :)\nI'm also not sure about including HTTP/2 as it's a protocol, whereas SPDY arguably is more of a feature.\n. I'd say HTTP/2 is the successor to HTTP 1.1, where SPDY was a notable stopgap. We don't obviously don't report on HTTP 1.1 which I why I said I'm not sure about including HTTP/2. However, since HTTP/2 is still a novelty at this point I don't mind reporting it.\nLet's call it 'HTTP2' or 'HTTP 2'.\n. Sorry for leaving this for so long, are you able to rebase so I can merge this in?\n. Duplicate of #703.\n. It would solve other issues as well, such as using different file types (SVG and PNG). I'd have to make some changes to the website if we go ahead with this but it's probably worth doing.\n. Let's just an an 'icon' field that specifies the filename including extension. To start we can mass update the JSON to include icon: '<application_name>.png'. The tests will need to use that field as well.\n. Yes, let's make it a required field.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Chrome does, it's to detect ads. The issue has been fixed in code.\n. Thanks!\n. Awesome, thanks. We'll still need to update the drivers to actually work with this.\n. There may be cases where it fails but Wappalyzer detects all the libraries you mention.\n. Wappalyzer works by scanning the page you're on, it wouldn't be able to pick up on humans.txt unless you went to the file directly.\n. Thank you!\n. Yes, PHPDoc is in. \n. Thanks!\n. You can run the shell scripts in any Linux environment, you just need to set the $WAPPALYZER_ROOT environment variable. Otherwise TravisCI will run the tests when you submit a pull request:\nhttps://travis-ci.org/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/builds/91711074\n. Yes, basically you'll need to go through the steps in the Dockerfile.\n. @AlexByte Have a look at the ./run script. It mounts the repository root as a folder, i.e. the Docker image should be run on the context of the repo.. No, I've just been slack with merging. Thank you. :)\n. Thanks!\n. Yes, the PhantomJS driver is recommended for running Wappalyzer server side as it will evaluate JavaScript variables in the window object. The Python driver does not do this.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks, awesome work!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. It compiles to JavaScript so I'm not sure how to go about detecting it on a website.\n. Looks like the icon is missing, can you include it?\n. Thanks!\n. I upgraded the server so it should be able to handle more connections now. I also turned off the error message display on the frontend.\n. Thank you!\n. Thank you!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Let's move the discussion to the pull request.\n. @gabrielefanplayr Can you confirm this is still happening?\n. Yes, a fix was pushed as part of another ticket. Please let me know if you notice it happening again.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n@DaAwesomeP I don't have the Wappalyzer icon in vector but do have it in a reasonably high res.\n. There are more sizes here: https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/tree/master/src/drivers/firefox/images\n. Thanks!\n. Are you able to provide more information on what happens when it crashes? I.e. a traceback or any error message?\n. We can include the license in the build but I think it's enough to simply declare the license, like in the Firefox manifest file. The Chrome version is missing this though. GPL doesn't require all bundled code to have the same license. I don't believe the GPL requires contributors to be listed either but they can be found here.\nYou're right about the BSD license, a LICENSE file should be included in that directory.\n. Rather than an option to ignore certain sites I much prefer fixing the issues. I just published a version that should address the iframe.js bug.\n. Thank you!\n. Thanks.\n. Thank you.\n. I wouldn't mind seeing a use case for this but I'd prefer to keep everything in the one repository.\n. Odd, \"0\" == false returns true but \"0\" ? true : false returns true as well.\n. Thanks!\n. Yep.\n. Thanks!\n. Thank you.\n. Wappalyzer can only pick up on technologies that are somehow exposed on the frontend. In the case of PHP, Wappalyzer looks at URLs, cookies, response headers and other software that is know to be written in PHP.\nAlthough Facebook is written in PHP I don't believe the website runs on PHP directly anymore. It's compiled to C++ and run as binary code.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HipHop_for_PHP\n. I merged one of your pull requests, it will be in the next release. Wappalyzer doesn't make network requests, you can't call PHP scripts directly.\n. Thank you. Would you be able to include the icon as SVG, or a transparent PNG no larger than 64x64?\n. You can update the existing pull request or open a new one if that's easier.\n. Nice one, thanks!\n. Thanks mate, I meant to look into this one myself.\n. Thanks!\n. Cheers!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thank you.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks! Would you be able to get the pull request up-to-date with the latest master and provide a larger icon? SVG would be ideal, otherwise a 64x64 or 32x32 PNG.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Looks like you deleted apps.json, probably unintentional. :)\n. It looks like you reset to an old version of the master branch, have a look at the changed files:\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/pull/1079/files\n. Thank you very much!\n. I'm planning to implement host checking at some point. Currently URLs that look like internal domains are filtered out, such as .local and .dev. \n. Nice, thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Everything is OR, you'd have to use confidence.\n. Thanks!\n. Finally fixed this one. :)\n. Thanks!\n. It's possible but not desirable for Wappalyzer to perform requests every time a page is loaded.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Chrome 48 changed the way it treats pageAction extensions. It looks like it's not possible to have the extension icon in the omnibox any more.\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/drivers/chrome/manifest.json#L12\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. It's a good idea but I don't have the capacity to respond to a large number of requests. Perhaps I could encourage people to submit a pull request though. :)\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Please submit a pull request!. The 'version keyword' is part of the Wappalyzer syntax.\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/wiki/Specification#patterns\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Awesome!\n. Thanks!\n. I just published a new version of the extensions.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. We'd have to maintain a list of current versions of all software. Not sure how that's practically possible.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. I'd say that's a reasonable assumption. There are exceptions but usually that's the case.\n. Fixed in 5593dba22a3705954f30bc1cbc3a55e57476c611. Thank you.\n. Hi,\nI agree with what you said and the regex looks right. By broken, do you mean it's not displaying the version number as '2'? It could be that the other patterns override the version number.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. I'm not against this. Would you like to implement the option?\n. Just Chrome would be great!\n. It's resolved, see @DaAwesomeP's pull request.. You're right @timneutkens, it's because the icon is SVG. I'm seeing this error in the console:\nUnchecked runtime.lastError while running pageAction.setIcon: Icon invalid.\nI also found this ancient bug report from 2009, which seems to be related and unresolved:\nhttps://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=29683\nWe may need to export PNGs as part of the build. I can't believe pageAction.setIcon doesn't support SVGs.\n. Fixed in f82083b3402bc8fdcb4fc5c50a29a88e376f1de2, thanks all.\n. No reason. Thanks! :)\n. Thanks!\n. The method used for detecting the application was too broad and resulting in a lot of false positives; it was showing up everywhere. Since it was deprecated anyway we decided to remove it.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Fixed in f04a83121bc8b9e98a3ae991ef2cf28c999ee686.\n. Did you see my last comment?\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Ah, I just fixed this myself. Thanks though!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Can you please include the icon in the PR? Thank you!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Duplicate of #1182.\n. That's fixed now, thanks.\n. Duplicate of #1182.\n. Please let me know if you think of something, I don't want to add options for the sake of it. Fewer options means less maintenance, fewer bugs and more consistency. I'm a advocate of simple tools that do one thing well.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Duplicate of #1204.\n. Duplicate of #1204.\n. Already fixed, but thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. I'm removing Ink until there is a more reliable way to detect it.. Thank you.\n. Fixed in source, thanks!. Duplicate of #1168. Chrome doesn't support SVG icons, we'll need to convert them to PNG during build.\n. Sorry about that. Thanks!\n. For what it's worth, you can turn off 'Tell me about upgrades' in the extension options.\n. Yep, thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. It's working in Edge now (8774fb6b86d3ef3d4fe09ffa7077e608b57934c2). Getting it into the Windows App Store is a bit of a process, hopefully I can get it approved soon.. @DaAwesomeP They acknowledged the issue here: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/9421085/. Yeah. Their last feedback was that it 'failed to install' on 'Windows 10 Desktop'. Apparently they don't know how to install an Edge extension. No way to respond to it either.. Thanks!\n. Chrome doesn't support SVG for the extension icon.\nThe PNGs should be regenerated every build, not sure why it would be using an older version.. They should be the same:\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/icons/Express.png. Thanks!\n. This is a duplicate of #1166. I would like to implement this feature.\n. Thanks!\n. I'm not a fan of the idea as it can interfere with JavaScript on web pages. Wappalyzer does inject a script but it's very minimal, just to read variables in the window object.. Thanks!\n. Yes please!\n. Thanks!\n. This has been merged manually, thanks!\n. Great! Thank you.\n. :rocket: \n. Great, thank you!\n. Not sure if I understand the suggestion correctly, but that's just HTML isn't it? No reason Wappalyzer wouldn't be able to use it.. Sure. I'll close this issue but you're welcome to submit a pull request to include this.. Thanks!\n. Thank you!\n. Closing because of inactivity. Please let me know if this is still an issue.. I can't merge this unfortunately, it looks like all of apps.json was rewritten (10,000+ changes). Would you mind submitting a new PR?\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/pull/1240/files\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thank you.\n. Thanks. You are correct but until we have more applications that fit in the 'runtime environment' category I'd like to leave it as-is. When comparing server-side languages it's useful to have Node.js in there even though it should technically just say 'JavaScript'.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. The tests are failing because it's missing an icon for the application. Can you please add one?\n. Can you please update #1255 to add this?\n. All good, thanks a ton!\n. Closing because of inactivity.. There is a threshold to show information on the website. If the number of websites is very small, it won't display.. Thanks!\n. Fixed in 14c537fbc0e911fa403c3ed8d6f60f16995f5296, thanks. In addition you can use the --quiet flag to suppress error output.. Should have submitted a pull request. ;). Duplicate of #1213.. Please have a look at the test results, it looks like the PNG image is really an ICO. Would you be able to provide a valid file?\n. Thanks!. Thanks!\n. You should be able to update your pull request or submit a new one to include the icon.\n. url only works when you're viewing the URL directly, probably not what you have in mind.\n. It only matches if that URL is displayed in the URL bar.\n. Thanks!. You're very welcome to help out. Please seen the wiki on how to contribute and feel free to open an issue if you need a hand with anything.\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/wiki/Contributing. I go through these every few weeks, when I find the time. Your submission looks good, thank you!. Merged, thanks all.. I'd recommend using the PhantomJS driver. The main difference is that the NPM driver doesn't evaluate JavaScript on web pages.. Looks good, thank you.. Thanks!. Thank you!. Thanks!. I prefer sticking to existing categories as possible, how about 'Editor' or 'Web Framework'?. Thanks!. The Vagrantfile sets the default provider to Docker so I'm not sure why it's complaining. You should be able to run vagrant up --provider=docker without having to install VirtualBox.. Ah right, you need a Linux host to run Docker. Boot2Docker sets up a VirtualBox to facilitate that. There's also this but I've never used it (as a Linux user):\nhttps://blog.docker.com/2016/03/docker-for-mac-windows-beta/. It's working for me on macOS Sierra with Docker for Mac and Vagrant 1.9.2 (not 1.9.3). For some reason vagrant up prompts for the Docker user's password, which is tcuser.\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/31613483/vagrant-with-docker-provider-requires-rsync-password. It took me most of a day but I got rid of Vagrant in favour of native Docker. Just run ./run links to get started and ./run validate to test changes before submitting a pull request. Tested on macOS Sierra, Docker version 17.03.1-ce.. I'm pushing up a new Docker image with rsync installed. Can you please try it again?. Should be there now.. Are you on OS X? Are you using Boot2Docker? Do you have rsync installed on your machine?. I removed Vagrant. With Docker installed, you can now run ./run to access the dev tools.\nConverting SVGs to PNGs doesn't work for some reason so I've commented it out in the build script for now.. Did you mean to include xregexp in the pattern? Can you show an example of a string that you're trying to match?. The easiest way to get this to work is by running the Vagrant development environment, see the README. Alternatively you can run the bin/wappalyzer-links in a UNIX-like environment but this requires some manual preparation (such as defining the $WAPPALYZER_ROOT environment variable). Essentially those files are symlinked from the src folder.. Looks like the Apache SVG does get converted to a PNG correctly.. Sure, let's call it 'Web Host'. Do you want to add it?. It can't be a DNS lookup, the information has to be present in the page response somehow.. Nice find, thanks for the fix!. It's still working for me on 51.0a2. Do you get an error when you try to install the add-on from the website?. Which version on you on? It's working for me on 51.0a2.. The WebExtension port is coming soon. You can try it out now:\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/tree/master/src/drivers/webextension. Thanks!. Thanks!. Good catch. Fixed in 6a4a7f7a8cf9f4bf590bdd7e1c511a672a8d3871.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Someone else registered the name but was kind enough to hand it over. I gave up trying to figure out how to delete the old one.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Closing this one as per @gadcam's comment.. Thanks!. I'll leave it as-is, I personally prefer lowercase filenames. Also if you just leave the argument off it will create the folder with a capital W, no need to specify it in that case.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. This will identify any website that links to clients.mindbodyonline.com to be identified as Mindbody. Can the pattern be made more specific?. I see. Using an external service to handle bookings doesn't really qualify as a website technology in my opinion. I'm closing this one.. Great, thank you.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thank you!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Agreed, thanks!. If someone wants to port the extension over to Safari, I'm happy to support it officially. I may get around to doing this myself eventually but prefer to wait until they support the WebExtension API.. Yes, you can use env to match methods on the window object, i.e. \"env\": \"Nette\".. Looks good, thank you!. Would you be able to install Wappalyzer as an unpacked extension and inspect the 'background.html' view? It may show an error in the console when you use Duo.\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/wiki/Drivers#google-chrome. This should be fixed in the next update. Please re-open this ticket if the issue persists.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Nice one, thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Nice one, thank you.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks! Wappalyzer now detects 1,000 applications.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Yep.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. The bookmarklet hasn't been updated in a little while but also has the limitation that it can't scan response headers. It's unable to pick up on many server-side applications for that reason.. I realised the bookmarklet does scan response headers but something was broken. I'll have a fix for this soon-ish.. Should be fixed.. Thanks!. The wappalyzer links command should be run before using the driver.. Thanks!. The category is wrong, I've changed it to Message Boards for now. We probably need a new category for these.. Wappalyzer will still display the application if the confidence is set to zero. This will result in false positives.. Agree, possibly even anything under 50%.. Do you want to remove the X-CMS-Version header pattern?. Thanks. I also finally added the no confidence check.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thank you!. Fixed in 3a8e9e2896e26397f61e696c1519800f68ef3b1f. You'll need to grab the new bookmarklet from https://wappalyzer.com/download in a couple of days (the change takes some time to roll out).. The expressions are case-insensitive, see:\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/wappalyzer.js#L308\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/wappalyzer.js#L326\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/wappalyzer.js#L332\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/wappalyzer.js#L361. Thanks!. Would you mind responding to @jvoisin's suggestions?. Duplicate of #1213.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. I think we should limit CDN detections to response headers. Including a script or image that's hosted on a CDN doesn't really qualify as using a CDN in my opinion.. Thanks!. Will be fixed soon.. This should be fixed in the next update, please re-open this thread if the issue persists.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Try tcuser as the password. The setup does need work, especially on Mac OS.. Thank you.. Yep, that page and chart is still a work in progress. It's hard to find a set of colours that's on brand but contrasting at the same time.. Contrasting colour added.\nhttps://www.wappalyzer.com/categories/ecommerce. Dupe of #1407.. This is fixed.. Thanks!. Closing because of inactivity.. Nice one, thanks!. CPU issue should be fixed. Preventing the script from running when tracking is disabled is coming soon.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Great idea, not sure if it's worth \u20ac50/mo. We can incorporate something into the build script.. Done. There's some work to do by the looks of it.\nhttps://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/. I ported the Chrome extension to WebExtension.\nIt works in Firefox but in Chrome the 'get_apps' sendMessage call doesn't get a response and doesn't populate the popup with detected applications. It looks like the polyfill may not be working as advertised.\n. I did change those calls but didn't commit the files correctly. That's pushed now.. Are you sure? Chrome accepts a response callback whereas WebExtensions uses a promise.\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/runtime/sendMessage\nhttps://developer.chrome.com/extensions/runtime#method-sendMessage. Thanks!. Thanks!. The correct link for Socket.IO is this:\nhttps://wappalyzer.com/applications/socket-io\nI'll review the function that creates the URL slugs in the extension.\nWhat do you mean by 'nothing works' though?. Fixed in 7d2952049f731eb262bc4b7b68bbca832fa25809.. Thanks. I'll try it out.. That works, thanks a ton.. What needs to be done to make it work in Edge?. There is a threshold for data to be displayed on the website. I'm happy to leave 1C-Bitrix in but it looks like not many Wappalyzer users encounter it.. The motivation for removing these applications is to remove bloat.. It would mainly be to reduce processing, i.e. the number of regular expressions evaluated on every page.. The applications needs to be detected on at least 100 websites to be displayed.. No, there isn't.. Ah, didn't mean to close this one. Something about the numbers seems off, not sure why Lodash has zero detections for instance.. Go for it.. @AlexByte I don't record every data point. I have rate limiting in place as well as some other methods to prevent abuse and deal with the high volume of traffic. There is something wrong with the numbers though, PHP and WooCommerce should certainly not be zero.. @AlexByte I worked out what happened, the totals on that page are now up-to-date again.. MySQL was struggling with large tables and timing out while trying to calculate the totals. I rebuilt the entire thing in MariaDB and it's blazing fast again.. The summaries get updated daily but as I mentioned I'm not collecting every single data point and they need to be corroborated by multiple sources. Lodash is zero because I renamed it from Lo-dash but that should populate probably within a few weeks.. I don't want to expose all the details but it's not enough for just one user to send information and have it show up on the website. It's to prevent people from poisoning the data with fake requests.. Ha, good point. Wappalyzer has a completely different architecture now so things have changed quite a bit.. I'm processing 10 requests per second but there is also a per-user limit. I'm not sure why you're seeing that many requests, it should only ping every 50 websites or so. Did you change the code on your end? Increasing the rate and interval both affect my AWS costs, I have to balance it.. Increasing the size of the request increases the duration of the function execution and database throughput. I'll experiment with this some more though.\n\nIt is necessary not to clear the cache if the request was completed with an error\n\nThe cache will just keep growing and a request will be issued on every page load after 50. I think that will result in more issues.. We can try that.. Good call, I've changed it in the latest version.. Oh, that was unintentional. I just pushed a stealth update to fix it.\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/commit/e6a9fcae2f04673b4dd2a52d8dc22ae09c6a70a5#diff-d7f544c6575fa5815df4b466a9e04f40. Throttling was always there, just not on a per-user basis. I made a few optimisations and seem to be capturing a lot more data now, you'll probably notice fewer 429's. We can add 1C-Bitrix back in and monitor it.. I used to have it so that it does a ping when you close the browser. I'll look into both options.. > You can save site detections to the storage when you close the browser.\nAdded that in here.. More on topic, the numbers appear to be more accurate now. 1C-Bitrix currently has 50+ detections (thanks @khazamov).. > How are detections added if extensions are not updated to return 1c-bitrix?\nLooks like some people are still running an old version with 1C-Bitrix.. Thanks!. Not if the extension injects React into web pages.. Thanks!. Use the wappalyzer package, not @wappalyzer/wappalyzer.\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/wappalyzer. Fixed, thanks.. Only global variables.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Merci!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks, I'll have a play around with this. It may be nice to keep the Firefox and Chrome/Opera manifests the same and leave it as 'manifest.json' so it can be loaded as an unpacked extension.. I suppose we can stick with PNG icons and work around the localStorage issue. We can have a separate file for Edge if required.. I made some changes and submitted the extension to Opera. Let's see what they say.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks, that's fixed.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. I don't think there is a high enough demand for Wappalyzer plugins, interesting idea though.. Thanks!. I'd have to understand the difference/benefit. . It's interesting, especially now that the PhantomJS maintainer has stepped down. Would you be interested in creating a port?. Yep, thanks for the suggestion @hbakhtiyor.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. The option has been added in v4. The upgrade notification is not there for the purpose of tracking users.. Would you mind updating the pull request with the icon?. It's working fine for me on YouTube, it returns 'HTTP/2' as the only application though.. Thanks!. It's fixed in v4.0.1.. Documentation has been moved to https://wappalyzer.com/docs.. Thank you!. Fixed in #1491, I'll push an update today.. No worries, thanks for reporting the issue.. Thanks!. That's fixed now, thanks.. Thank you!. Thanks!. Please use the wappalyzer package, not @wappalyzer/wappalyzer.. Awesome, thank you!. Sounds good. Do you want to add it?. Thanks! Categories are defined here:\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/apps.json#L10374\nEach locale will need an entry for new the new category as well:\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/tree/master/src/drivers/webextension/_locales. Nice one, thanks!. What was it using before? Xenial?. Shouldn't we move to Xenial at least?. Thanks!. You can't run arbitrary JavaScript on webpages with Wappalyzer.. Wappalyzer only deals with the main page request, I wouldn't want to run the regular expressions over every file.. Thanks!. Thank you!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Perhaps the issue is that Wappalyzer changes the height of the popup (by adding applications as it find it) during the opening animation on OS X.. It could just be timing. There have only been slight CSS changes to the pop-up CSS, nothing major.. Chrome uses the polyfill now, and promises to query the tabs. That may be causing a timing issue. I can reproduce the issue but very inconsistently, perhaps one out of ten times when I click the icon to expand the popup.. I rewrote most of the popup code in 70ecdf0899d7e4b02c866dbd1a31847f4acf96a7, hopefully it's better now. There are two asynchronous calls that happen; one to get the active tab and one to get the detected applications. Previously they fired on document ready. Now they fire immediately, which means the markup is in the popup earlier (and gets updated only once instead of once for each application to further reduce flashing). I'm also forcing a redraw of the popup after 600ms in case it does get stuck.. I'm trying something else to work around this (99579252d238c8182206f8976e8318a1fe9db88f). The issue is with Chrome on MacOS though.. Please let me know if this is still happening in version 5.. I'm hopeful that the workaround in c4328afa302c657e796e2889d8cdd06a29e35903 fixes this. Looks out for v5.0.5.. @deanylev Yes, v5.0.6. It should behave like you said but I'll reopen the issue as it doesn't appear to be working for everyone.. I think it's related to this Chrome issue:\nhttps://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=307912. Fixed in v5.1.0.. Thanks, Ward! I trust that you managed to get the development environment up and running?. Awesome, thanks!. Yeah, I should do that. How does publishing work with Travis CI?. Awesome, thanks!. It worked! \ud83d\udc4d \nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/releases. Great, thanks. I think all the i18n files will need to be updated, even if it's just the English string. I might also change it so the icon is grey by default and changes to purple when an application is detected.. Thanks!. PHP v8 support has been removed, you can use the PhantomJS driver using exec() or shell_exec().. Thanks!. Thanks!. Nice, thanks!. Fixed in 574e7b1245efff91ba4eb0bcb87d44bdcfddf6de. Not sure what happened there.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Fixed in 20a41cbeadb4198e9de4d3593d8fe99a1fa8a215.. Thanks!. Thanks!. https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/commit/f0073652cb4cc6dc96fd35c64078fa2e7325a985#diff-d7f544c6575fa5815df4b466a9e04f40R495. Thanks!. Nothing was overwritten, your changes are still there:\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/apps.json#L8404. There is no \"Server\" property, you probably meant to use \"headers\". Also you're using a backreference for the version number without using a capture group.. How would that work?. Wappalyzer needs to run in the context of the page, it looks for JavaScript variables to identify applications.. I don't think that will work as there is a ~2,000 character limit. It also means updates to app.json won't be rolled out automatically.. You can't. You can call wappalyzer.analyze() with just HTML but you'd have to make changes to index.js and driver.js.. Thanks!. Should this not be merged with the existing SweetAlert app? . That's because it uses the NPM module which hasn't been updated yet.. It's there now but it detects both SweetAlert and SweetAlert2. The latter should have \"excludes\": \"SweetAlert\" to avoid this.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. I don't want to add detection for plugins to Wappalyzer, there are too many.. That one must have slipped through! . Yes, I'd say so.. I'd like to remove those too.. There is a setting to always display the Wappalyzer icon.. Sure. Perhaps we can add a dropdown to the options page to nominate a single category that will be used for the icon.. I'm not sure how. I found this:\nhttps://blog.brave.com/loading-chrome-extensions-in-brave/\nI also added Wappalyzer to the list here:\nhttps://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/wiki/Desired-extensions. Closing because of inactivity. Will pick this up when Brave supports WebExtensions.. Closing because of inactivity.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Closing because of inactivity.. Closing because of inactivity.. Thanks!. Either spin up the Vagrant environment or run ./bin/wappalyzer-links . from the repository root. It will hard-link wappalyzer.js and apps.json to the various drivers.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks! I resolved the merge conflict locally.. Widgets was intended for embedded code like Google Maps and tweets. It's not as commonplace at it used to be.\nI wouldn't mind differentiating between back and frontend frameworks. Perhaps web frameworks can be reserved for backend and we add a new category UI frameworks for frontend. . Thank you!. Thanks!. I think Node.js makes more sense in the Programming Languages category than Web Frameworks. Express is a framework, which runs on Node.js. We could change it to JavaScript but that can be confused with client-side JavaScript. . Thanks!. The pending release is compatible.. Added a note the SVGs should be square.. Thanks!. Thanks @MicroDreamIT.\n@gadcam Yep, good idea.. Thanks!. Thanks!. I fixed a bug that prevented meta tags from being checked, which fixes the CLoudCart issue.. That's related to #1588.. Closing because of inactivity.. Would love to include Redux but I don't believe there is a good way to identify it.. Thanks!. Fixed in 04531bdee5315204b4b6fcaea24eb566677882ca, thanks.. @gadcam The icon field is no longer required, it falls back to default.svg.. Closing as this is still broken.. Thanks!. Still broken, closing.. Thanks!. What category should it be in?. Fixed, thanks!. Fixed in f14e45c431ad4123a38a4710584669a6df3d4440.. Thanks!. Thanks!. The generator meta tag confused Wappalyzer. Both issues have been fixed in 4f7b42906fe87f87d6bbae48e21b0cbb68585bfd.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Did you pass it a URL? It should be used like this:\ndocker run --rm wappalyzer/cli http://example.com\nYou don't need Kitematic, just install Docker and run the above command on the command line.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. That won't work, the dimensions of the icon are fixed.. This needs to be fixed in getEnvironmentVars in content.js. XML is excluded from checking but it's still injected with JavaScript, which is what's messing up the rendering.. Fixed in a43b4c83ffd0cd1d193a86d2e349c08cccaa1cf7.. Closing because of inactivity.. Thanks!. Today.. Good stuff, thanks!. Firefox has moved to WebExtensions which don't support moving add-on icons being placed elsewhere.. Because Wappalyzer's functionality is page-specific it uses pageAction instead of browserAction. Firefox places pageAction add-ons in the URL bar (Chrome does not). There is no option to make this configurable by users.. Thanks!. Thanks for the PR @ramsondon. I have to agree with @AlexByte though.. Thanks!. If it exceeds 50,000 characters, it grabs the top and bottom part of the page and discards what's in between. Usually that's where the most relevant code is. Scanning pages larger than that can cause delays and CPU overhead. What is it breaking?. Using selectors is a great idea.. Things have changed quite a bit, please let me know if this is still an issue.. There is no option for it currently but I'm in favour of adding this in.. Added in 3327fa18c80700ad48101784ea6acc66604f37bf. In the next version you can pass --user-agent=<string>.. Thanks!. Duplicate of #1630.. I don't think managed v.s. self-hosted warrants treating them as different applications. What makes them so different if your opinion?. Closing because of inactivity.. Is it not fixed?. The only code that's run in the context of the page is inject.js, which communicates back to the extension via an event. There is no way for a page to execute code in the extension as far as I know.. Just read your second comment. The NPM driver has been rewritten to use Zombie.js instead of Phantom.js but both are safe from websites executing code.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. What version of Wappalyzer are you using?. Please try 4.1.5 which was published today.. Thanks!. Merci.. I fixed this one already, thanks.. Thank you.. Closing because of inactivity. Please let me know if this is still an issue.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks, these have been fixed.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. I'll leave this open for now, some of the results are obviously Blackboard and not MyBB. It's a little difficult to debug without access to a Blackboard website though.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Fixed in c4328afa302c657e796e2889d8cdd06a29e35903.. It's simpler to do message && message.tracking_enabled, I'll add that in.. Great! Thank you.. Thanks a bunch!. $ git clone https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer.git\n$ cd Wappalyzer\n$ ./run links\n$ cd src/drivers/npm\n$ npm i\n$ node index.js\nIf you just want to run Wappalyzer you can run npm i wappalyzer instead.\nThe most recent version doesn't use PhantomJS.. Lovely, thank you.. Thanks!. Which version are you running? Version 5 was released recently.. Please use this package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/wappalyzer. Thanks!. Thanks!. Closing because of inactivity.. Thanks Brandon!. I'll update that, thanks!. Duplicate of #1510.. Closing because of inactivity.. Do you want to submit a pull request for it?. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. It's 0 zero for success and 1 for any failure. . Thanks!. I agree the short env pattern will return in more false positives.. Thank you!. The SVG to PNG converter doesn't work in the Docker container for some reason, I've been running it manually on my machine instead. I have to remember to do it though.. Thanks!. I fixed the wiki, thanks. ;). That looks like an error on the website that's being crawled, not Wappalyzer.. Thanks!. It looks like there isn't a good way to identify the application. If you have a solution, please submit a pull request if you can.. You need to return a promise in the map function, this should work:\njavascript\nPromise.all(domains.map(domain => wappalyzer.analyze(domain)))\n  .then(results => console.log(results));. You're right, the issue is that the driver only uses a single instance of wappalyzer. I've changed it to a class, which works.\nFixed in v5.0.7: 3057e396d9ddcddb80b23d57689cd706cfd90659.. Fixed in 735e00383fe2ec1ae92a4aded1cafaf40455182a. Alternatively you can run yarn install or npm i in src/drivers/webextension.. Please have a look at the Travis CI test results.. Thanks! I might revisit this later, I'll leave the PR open for now.. I'm closing this as the NPM driver has evolved quite a bit and a headless Chrome implementation should probably just be its own driver. Drivers are intended to be an interface between Wappalyzer core and a platform.. Thanks!. The fixed height is to fix #1510.. Either, as long as the popup window stays the same size.. Should be fixed in today's update.. Great, thank you!. Fixed, thanks.. Thanks.. Thanks!. Nice one, thank you!. Thanks!. Fixed in 0c909ae0248a49916c0719253f0dc46695b5e529. Please reinstall the bookmarklet from the download page.. Wappalyzer uses a delay to give scripts a chance to render page changes. AJAX requests are not inspected to avoid performance issues.. I'm guessing that's the storage permission which was added in April. It's there to allow the extension to save settings, which automatically means all local storage can be accessed.. I'll sort this one out, thank you!. Closing as this software does not appear to be widely used.. The output should be identical. This is likely a bug.. Fixed in 1612c54d80c2251eb9173964e22d24ec332d579e.. You don't have to use index.js, you can require driver.js in your own script and use that. Please open a new issue about the script not exiting.. Thanks!. Thanks.. I'm reverting this one. Firefox needs the height attribute.. It cuts off the bottom of the pop-up in certain cases.. Fixed.. Wappalyzer now uses asynchronous execution. Let me know if this is still an issue.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks @julienszabados!. Cheers.. Thanks. I do prefer (?:) as it makes it easier to see where the version number is coming from (and it's slightly more optimised).. I can't merge this, please rebase and/or open a new pull request.. Thanks!. The reason for rejecting applications that are not widely used is to keep Wappalyzer's footprint small. Every regular expression is evaluated on every page load, which has an impact on CPU usage and browser performance. I want to keep the threshold low but at the same time each addition should be of some value to most users.\nWe can go with 1K+ stars on GitHub, or a showcase of 10+ websites using the application. I'm also happy to just merge PRs that seem reasonable and remove them if they don't result in any detections for several months (as per #1432). That way we don't need to be too hostile to new contributors.. I've added to the new developer documentation.. Thanks!. Thanks!. I'm with @jvoisin on this one. Please feel free to join the eligibility discussion in #1742.. This should be fixed in the next update.. It specifically handles 404 by returning an empty string, which then gets cached. When I test this on example.com it only attempts to fetch robots.txt once. Would you be able to share a URL for testing?. I suspect it's your second point as I'm not seeing this behaviour on that URL. It's not ideal that Wappalyzer attempts request robots.txt once for every detected application in case of an error though, perhaps we should add a cooldown period.\nNote that robots.txt will not be fetched if tracking is turned off in the extension settings.. > For that site Wappalzer is showing me 6 items in use, so from what you said it would try to grab robots.txt file (assuming it wasn't cached) 6 times?\nOnly if fetching robots.txt repeatedly returns an error. The extension still isn't likely to be the cause of the issue.\n\nWhen you said that the robots.txt file will be hit only when tracking is turned on, did you mean then 'Anonymously send reports on detected applications to wappalyzer.com for research' option?\n\nYes, that's the one.\n\nAdditionally, if I click on \"Inspect Views\" in Chrome and look at the contents of 'Local Storage' I don't see any entry for 'robotsTxtCache' and changing the options on the options above don't seem to change any of the stored values in the Local Storage Cache.\n\nRight, you probably can't see values stored by extensions. Not sure about this though.. Thanks!. It should be the same as your browser language, is that not the case? There is no option to change it in the extension.. Thank you very much!. I'm declining this one. Apologies to the board. \ud83d\ude10 . Thanks!. Please include a list of 10+ websites using the application. Closing this for now as the user base appears to be to small for inclusion.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. It's currently prioritised over analytics and caching tools. Issue trackers is higher up because I'd argue it's usually the primary application.\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/apps.json#L10787. Thanks!. I'm not seeing a significant speed difference. Can you try running it on http://localhost to get an idea of speed without fetching a page from the internet?. I believe that's because Lambda scales CPU with RAM. Allocating a larger amount makes it significantly faster.. I get ~700 ms on a small page with 768 MB RAM.\n\n. Fixed in 5ea146f60174cca672d438c8a7a4847920cffabc, thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thank you very much!. Thanks. The locales need to be updated as well but I'll do that myself.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks. Do note that the PNG will be invisible for most people as it's white on white.. I haven't merged it because without any patterns it doesn't do anything.. Thanks!. It certainly looks like someone is sending fake data. I made a change to try and combat this but if you have any ideas I'd be interested to hear them.. The issue isn't just with CoinHive, although #1807 is interesting. I noticed that Twitter and YouTube for instance shows up on dozens of applications, originating from many different IP addresses.\nMaybe we should take this conversation off-line. What's the easiest way to do this, email perhaps?. Ah yeah, Slack. Brilliant. Inviting @gadcam, @jvoisin, @q--, @DaAwesomeP, @AlexByte and @craiglondon. I think I'll accept anyone but I'll create a channel just for us.\nhttps://join.slack.com/t/wappalyzer/shared_invite/enQtMjY4Nzc2MjczMjUxLTk4NTFmODBiNDQ4MGYyNTE5ODU2Zjg1N2Y5YmM1NzdkZTUyYjQ1MjE1OGU1NzUxZjY4ZGFlOWQxYWQ1ZDQwNjQ \n@jvoisin I'm sure there is an IRC plugin for Slack? :). I noticed that, it's enabled. Looks like @jvoisin has already come to terms with modern times though.. Thanks!. It's supported but there aren't many ways to pick up on it, other than identifying applications that are known to be built on Go.\nhttps://wappalyzer.com/applications/go. Ah, yes. You could interface with the Node driver and write a wrapper in Go, or use something like otto to interpret JavaScript in Go (I have never used either so I'm not sure what's involved). I'm usually not in favour porting all of Wappalyzer to a different language as it makes it much harder to maintain.. You can create you own driver.js, which is a wrapper around wappalyzer.js. To analyse a HTML string you can call wappalyzer.analyze() like so: \nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/drivers/npm/driver.js#L129. Please do, it's causing merge conflicts. The build script takes care of the indentation anyway.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. If you click around on the Stripe website it will pick up on more technologies and remember them. That might explain why the browser version is showing more results for you.. Docker is just a wrapper around the NPM driver. Have you tried installing Wappalyzer through NPM?. > > it will pick up on more technologies.\n\nWhat does it mean?\n\nI means that different technologies may be identified on pages other than the homepage. You often get more results the more pages you view.. Does the NPM version hang as well? I don't think it's a Node issue but perhaps a dependency has been updated. You're using Wappalyzer version 5.1.3?. Good to know. Sounds like we may need to specify a timeout value.. This should be fixed by 3327fa18c80700ad48101784ea6acc66604f37bf. Wappalyzer will wait for resources on the page to load. The default timeout for this is three seconds, you can change it by passing --max-wait=<ms>.. To make it more responsive. Usually it's enough to identify most applications.. It's a trade-off, it makes a big difference when scanning a lot of pages. Note that the browser extension doesn't wait at all. In any case, it's configurable.. Thanks!. Thanks!. This should be fixed as per #1789.. Thanks!. Thanks!. You could execute ./run links with a postinstall script or use npm link to include the package from a local folder. I'll probably push a new version up soon though.. I wouldn't mind having a look at your code bit this PR contains 8.5K changes. Can you please rebase?. Thank you! Would you mind adding the (new) SEO category as well?. Cheers!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Fixed in 5c68a1503f62a775453f6351bb7fe82e09382191, thanks.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Please see https://wappalyzer.com/docs#new-application:\n\nOnly widely used applications should be added. When creating a pull request, please include ten or more links to websites that use the application, a GitHub page with at least 1,000 stars or anything that will help establish the size of the user base.. New policy! Thanks for understanding.. Thanks!. Squashed it. :). Thank you.. I'm getting consistent results with a maxWait of 3000.\n\nwait will exit when all resources are loaded, or when it's waited for maxWait millseconds. I don't think the waitDuration option exists any more. \nhttp://zqdevres.qiniucdn.com/data/20110811173813/index.html. Looks like it's the same option, it sets options.duration to the first argument if it's a number and Browser.waitDuration otherwise.\nhttps://github.com/assaf/zombie/blob/master/src/index.js#L269\nIs using a lower value not an option for you?. > it uses waitDuration as wait param for this internal call. and maxWait is only used for our external call\nI'm not sure what you mean by this. It's using the maxWait option because it ends the request after three seconds if you set it to 3000.\nI made a fix (8db38ca79ad2545b0eeb31f201a0cdb8b5279c8f) for the 'Cannot read property 'response' of undefined' error.. I've changed this in the most recent version.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Are you using v5.1.5?. And I'm assuming you're using index.js as the entrypoint? It will always call process.exit():\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/drivers/npm/index.js#L34. I would expect the callback to work actually.\nHow are you running Wappalyzer in Lambda? I'll try to reproduce it.. Locally you'd have to call process.exit(). I expect Lambda to take care of that when you call the callback though.. You need to set context.callbackWaitsForEmptyEventLoop to false. This works:\n```javascript\nconst wappalyzer = require('wappalyzer')({});\nexports.handler = (event, context, callback) => {\n  context.callbackWaitsForEmptyEventLoop = false;\nwappalyzer.analyze('https://www.wappalyzer.com')\n    .then(json => callback(null, json))\n    .catch(callback);\n};\n``. Sweet, can't wait to see which websites are powered by Excel.. Awesome, thank you.. Thanks. :). Me too.. Added, thank you!. Thanks, fixed in code. It will go up with the next deployment.. I finally pushed a fix for this, it should start working again soon.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thank you!. This one has conflicts, does it need to be merged? Your other PR is almost identical.. Cheers!. Nice one, thank you.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thank you!. The parameter--max-waitis correct, although--maxWait` will work too. I'll try to update the Docker image this weekend and get you to test it again.. This should be fixed now, the image was updated last week.. Thanks!. Error handling should be improved in the next version. Do you have a test case for this?. Fixed in 0c53f79a547159b69d6f1f7d5e6137f7a45535ed.. Nice one, thanks.. There is a widget category that may be suitable for now. What do you think?. OK, let's add it. Will you submit a PR?. Thanks!. Thanks!. I had a look into this one but I'm still unsure as well. I'll close this one for now.. Renaming an application means it will get a new page alongside the old one. I think that's OK though, the old page will eventually drop off.\n\nThe glyphicon pattern can stay.\nThe env pattern doesn't seem right, it should probably be removed.\nYou can add new script patterns, using an array.. What an amateur. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thank you!. Fixed in v5.2.0. You may need to set a larger wait value than the default 3 seconds:\n\ndocker run --rm wappalyzer/cli https://atlassian.com --max-wait=30000. Thanks!. Perhaps in the case of scripts it's OK, it's actually interesting to see if a website loads resources from CDNJS. What I want to avoid is reporting 'Amazon S3' when the page contains in image that happens to be hosted on S3.. Thanks!. Thank you!. Thanks.. Nice work, thank you.. Thank you. The indentation is fixed automatically at build time.. Thanks!. I saw @markdalgleish at Web Directions this year, I thought his talk was the most interesting one by far. I'm a fan.\nI don't think the icon works well at 16x16, do you want to replace it with this one perhaps?\n\n. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. It's annoying because I can't CNAME the root domain and Amazon CloudFront doesn't provide a static IP. I can't use an S3 bucket because it doesn't support Elastic IP either. I don't want to rely on a third party to issue the redirect so my only option is to use Amazon Route53, which is crazy expensive, or run a separate server, which is also a cost.. Ah yep, that's what I meant. To host a certificate for the root domain I'd have to run a separate server, or use CloudFront with Route53. Not many people will navigate to the root domain over HTTPS directly, the problem is old links that I haven't been able to update.. For performance mainly, and free SSL.. Last time I checked the certificate needs to be manually renewed and installed every three months unless you let their script manage your Nginx configuration (which I don't want to do).. I'll have a look into it again if I can find the time, once every three months isn't that bad I suppose.. I think f5882705796179d455c7c41b3d588daa2b4bfd56 will fix this.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. I'm not sure what's happening here, it's a server-side error and Wappalyzer doesn't interfere with outgoing requests. The only thing I can think of is that Wappalyzer tries to access robots.txt in a separate request but I don't know why that would result in a 502 on the original request.. Thanks for getting to the bottom of that one! I'll have a think about what can be done about it.. The robots.txt requests are done a little smarter now but I'm not sure if this can be avoided completely.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. It's been there from the beginning.\nhttps://www.wappalyzer.com/favicon.ico. Added, cheers.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thank you!. Thanks!. Thanks again!. If you disable the option to send anonymous reports, the extension won't make any external calls including robots.txt.\nCan you elaborate on other reasons you'd want this feature?. Closing because of inactivity.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Nice one, thank you!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Merged manually, thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Wow, that's a bit of an oversight on my part. Sorry about that. I pushed v5.2.2.. Solid plan.. Thanks!. There is content.js, which should be all you need. You can message it with tabs.sendMessage().\nI think I'd like it better if the pattern wasn't the key in the object, maybe we can do something like this:\njavascript\n\"js\": [\n  \"jQuery.fn.jquery=(.+)\\\\;version:\\\\1\"\n]\nThis way you don't need to provide an empty string as the value when there is no version to detect.. @gadcam You're right, let's stick with key/value. We need to be able to handle true/false values as well so we can set a version number if a property exists. We can probably just omit the regex in thoses cases.\njavascript\n\"js\": {\n  \"someSoftware.enterprise\": \"\\\\;version:Enterprise\"\n}. Thanks, awesome work. I merged this into master to avoid merge conflicts in every PR.. I do still want to cap the size of the HTML that we analyse. Some pages are several megabytes and Wappalyzer will hang.. Very large pages (like Google Sheets or GitHub diffs) often have relatively useless content on them (for us), apart from the very top and bottom of the page. 1MB is huge for a HTML page (1,000,000 chars). The current limit is 500KB, we can make that larger if you think there is a case for it.. Thanks, I'll leave the cap as is but use the serializer.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thank you!. Thanks!. I have updated and merged this manually (due to merge conflicts), thank you!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Looks like it got lost by incorrectly merging a conflict. I'll add it back in.. Thanks!. Added it back in, sorry about that.. This has been added back in, cheers.. Thanks!. Thanks, this is fixed in v5.4.2.. Merged manually, thanks!. Merged manually, thanks!. Merged manually, thanks!. Is there an icon for this?. Merged manually, thanks.. This has been merged manually, thank you.. This has been merged manually, thank you.. Merged off-line, thanks!. Merged off-line, thanks!. Thanks!. Merged manually, thank you.. Merged manually because of a conflict, thank you.. Merged manually, thanks.. Merged and updated manually, thank you.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Sounds good.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Nice, thanks.. As a Firefox for Android user, very cool. :). This has been fixed too.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks, fixed in v5.4.1.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Fun one. That site overrides native functions such as Object.keys and Array.prototype.reduce, which interferes with the injected script. I've rewritten the code so it doesn't call any object or array functions.\nFixed in 4bbda8916b007f6d125bac5e73950d10e2fe2d85.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Fixed, thank you.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thank you!. Should be fixed in the next update.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Looks good!. It's not really useless if it can be identified but it looks like either of them are almost never picked up, so it can be removed.. Go for it!. Yes, they can both go. Thank you!. They should probably be integers.. Done, thank you.. Pong!. Merged, thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Can you provide an example?. What options are you running it with?. I wouldn't expect running into issues running multiple instances with those options. The following works for me (50 instances).\n```javascript\nPromise.all(new Array(50).fill(null).map(() => new Wappalyzer(url, options).analyze()))\n  .then(results => {\n    process.stdout.write(JSON.stringify(results) + '\\n')\nprocess.exit(0);\n\n})\n  .catch(error => {\n    process.stderr.write(error + '\\n')\nprocess.exit(1);\n\n});\n```\n. What is the last thing logged to the console when it hangs? Try it with debugging enabled, i.e. Wappalyzer(url, { debug: true }).. You code works for me, I think you just need to call process.exit() in the code that handles the promise.. Yes, Wappalyzer will pick up on half as many technologies without scripts.. I've tested it on 6.10, 7 and 8 should work too. I'll add it to the dependency list.. It's not planned. The extension would have to fire off dozens of requests on every website to identify technologies this way, which would interfere with people's browsing. You can still add the pattern but it would only pick up on the CMS when you visit that particular URL.. Same issue as #2008.. Happens for me too, not every time though. \nLooks like it may be a ZombieJS issue, it hangs at the following debug output:\n$ export DEBUG=zombie; node index.js http://www.kikiwomens.be --max-wait=5000 --debug=1\nzombie Opened window https://progallery.wix.com/worker.html?cacheKiller=1515644718387&compId=tpaWorker_1133&deviceType=desktop&endpointType=worker&instance=WdQNfzIOfEthuMw4NOe4Pt0idTr6WV6Zp3WBRgh7jnI.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&locale=nl&viewMode=site&vsi=317b8fa4-6255-4a98-9506-e9a6cb8e6601 tpaWorker_1133 +5ms. Still not sure what's happening here. It works fine for me 99% of the time, which makes it hard to debug.\nAs a workaround you can force-quit the script after some time, in index.js:\n```javascript\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  console.log('force quit');\nprocess.exit(1);\n}, 10000);\n``. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. The should be fixed, thanks.. Getting quite a few merge conflicts, could you maybe try a rebase?. I've applied these changes manually. Thanks!. Thank you!. Do you want to add it?. @rviscomi I don't think we should add that in, for the reason you mention. The popup should display the technologies used on that page.. Thanks, @alexxn. This is the right place for issues like this. It should be fixed now, please try it again.. Perfect, thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Right you are. Thank you!. Not intentional, not sure what happened there. Fixed in fd9c20c700f10796a7aaf429095991c19b25d51c.. @brandonkelly Good point, it might be the JSON linter.. Fixed in 07d701700a2688ff42f4e33109f3c977a3e14a0b. I disabled jsonlint, for some reason it's not working properly.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Looks like the issue might be withpostMessagefrominject.js`? Can you provide the URL of the page where you noticed this?. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Added in 09ebc4aa486b5151ab05344e7611006a877408c2, thanks!. I'll update it today.. The NPM driver will scan pages that are fetched successfully. If authentication is required there isn't much left to do.. It is, see #2095. Let's keep discussion in the other issue.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Do you want to add it?. Thank you.. This has been fixed, apologies.. Thanks, it must be related to the change below. Should be fixed in the next update.\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/commit/4a711891fc4022ba8138c55c3ed44bbba32b59bb#diff-472301373a1b20de9d316bb2fc68a9ff. Fix has been pushed, sorry about that.. Thanks!. This happened in 5.4.5 and has been fixed in 5.4.6.. Awesome, thanks!. I updated the pattern to <(?:link|script)[^>]+(?:feed|components)/com_, that should fix it.. Fixed in v5.4.7, going out today. Thanks, all.. Thanks!. Did you mean to update the patterns as well? This PR is just an icon change.. Thanks!. Closing due to inactivity.. We can just use native DOM methods instead of XPath, I'd be in favour of that.\nThe problem here though is that the pattern is matching plain text. The tests didn't pick it up because there is a < elsewhere in the pattern. I think we need to remove the first half as it targets any link to an Opercart powered website.. Thank you!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Did you ever use React somewhere on that domain? Wappalyzer caches results for some time. Restarting your browser should give you up-to-date results.. Could be. I'll close this for now as we can't reproduce it.. Thank you. Would you mind moving the icon to the icons folder?. Cheers!. No icon?. Do you want to update the locales as well?. This should be fixed in the next update. It looks like onMessage expects a return value of true or a promise.\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/runtime/onMessage\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/commit/24c460f86fa6d88bdeb24f728e05405635cd996d#diff-810b4f4b3efe5b5bc0b99ade94beecccR220. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Agree, I'm happy to include these.\nThe confidence flag can only be used with regular expressions, not with includes and excludes. Mind updating them?. I'll update these, thank you!. No worries, and congrats. :). Thanks!. Thanks! . Thank you!. Cool, thanks.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Excellent, thanks!. Thanks!. Thank you!. Please let us know if this still happens and I'll reopen the issue.. Thank you!. Would you like to help add these? I'm in favour of adding it.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Wouldn't this return the version number of the plugin and not Bootstrap itself?. Assuming that's the case, all good.. Technically possible but it's disabled by design. Wappalyzer only requests permissions for http and https URLs. In most cases it's not useful to analyse chrome and chrome-extension pages.. Closing this one for now. Thank you.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks! Mind including the icon file too?. Thanks!. Thanks!. It's a 'page action' extension which means it lives in the address bar (in Firefox) and only activates when a page is loaded. It doesn't show an icon unless there are results to display. It should show up on the installation page that loads when the extension is installed.. Yeah, we can do that.. In the next update the default icon will be shown when no technologies are identified, with a message in the popup.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks, I added a workaround in 916b3af5c030b159020a73857931d6a7f5e39d64. Looks like the issue has already been raised with Zombie.js.\nhttps://github.com/assaf/zombie/issues/1135. Thanks!. Are you sure you're not drunk? Should :? not be ?:?. Thanks. :). Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. I want to avoid running Wappalyzer over documents like PDFs and other non-HTML content. We can white-list more content types though, including XHTML.. This has been done:\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/drivers/webextension/js/driver.js#L151. Thanks!. Neither AWS or ELB is a CDN though. ELB is a load balancer. Amazon's CDN offering is called CloudFront.. ELB could go into Web Servers but maybe we should add a Web Hosting or IAAS category. ELB only works with Amazon EC2.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. I'll remove that, thanks.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Appears to be working now.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Is the issue just that scripts loaded from the 'chrome-extension' are marked as not secure? Because that would be expected behaviour. It shouldn't cause console or SSL errors on the page.. Thanks!. This is currently working correctly.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Do you have a few candidate technologies for the category?. Sounds good. Do you want to add it?. Would you be able to provide examples of websites using those load balancers? There may not be a way to externally identify them.. Thanks!. Fixed with some trickery in a0cc689e1dff9a96baf3d0488433b89d320fb062. Underscore.js and Lodash were using the same pattern and were always detected together.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. I'm adding htmlMaxCols and htmlMaxRows options to configure this in the next version.. Thanks!. Closing this as we're unable to reproduce it. Please feel free to revive this issue if you see it happen again.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thank you!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Right, it's to track ads across the web. It can be turned off in the settings. It's not currently being used to display advertising networks in the popup but I'm hoping to tie it back in at some point.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. The redirect is issued by this odd script on page itself:\n```javascript\n      (function() {\n        var eventMethod = window.addEventListener ? 'addEventListener' : 'attachEvent';\n        var eventer = window[eventMethod];\n        var messageEvent = eventMethod === 'attachEvent' ? 'onmessage' : 'message';\n    eventer(messageEvent, function(e) {\n      if (e.origin !== 'https://www.android.com') {\n        return;\n      }\n      window.location = e.data;\n    }, false);\n  })();\n\n```\nIt happens because Wappalyzer fires an event on the page, we'll have to find out if this can be avoided.. Does the extension still receive the message if we set a target origin?. Thanks!. Done, thank you!. Thanks. The 100% confidence tag isn't technically needed as it's the default.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Agree, should be removed.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks for the example. I found that Zombie.js hanged when evaluating the script loaded from //js-sec.indexww.com/ht/p/184475-137819213763014.js. I managed to get around it with a patch, which will be applied in the next version.\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/patches/zombie-vm-timeout.patch. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. We can rename Piwik but I think we should leave the old patterns in, in addition to the Matomo ones.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Fixed in 3402b850ed988d527c43d9ff9ff230766a9c7ce4..

Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. It looks right, each iteration now has it's own instance of content instead of re-assigning a value. Nice catch.. Thanks!. The setTimeout() call is what makes it asynchronous. Also the iterators don't return promises so the Promise.all() call would be redundant.. Promises are not asynchronous.. Try increasing the available memory. This will give the function more CPU to play with as well, which should speed things up.. I thought so too but the timeout only works when the call stack is empty. For instance, the following script will never output 'done': \njavascript\nsetTimeout(() => console.log('done'), 500); while ( true ) {};\nAs far as I know there is no way for a script to terminate itself when it's busy processing.\nAlso, there are multiple points in the code where the maxWait value is used. You'll want to set the Lambda timeout to a multiple of it (e.g. 2m timeout, 5000ms max wait, 768MB memory).\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop. Merged this offline, thank you.. Try applying this patch to Zombie.js. Wappalyzer is much less useful without running scripts.\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/patches/zombie-vm-timeout.patch. @avasilkov That command is working for me. The setTimeout call only kicks in when the stack is empty so it looks like the script is still stuck processing.

Hi, are you be able to showcase 10+ websites that use this software?. I don't think there's much we can do apart from setting a background colour (not pretty) or having an alternate set of icons (there are over a thousand currently).. Thanks, Patrick. I've been following your work from the sidelines, please feel free to reach out if we can help streamline the integration.. Thanks!. Thank you!. You need to exit the script. If you want to run Wappalyzer over multiple URLs, you can use Promise.all:\n```javascript\nconst promises = [\n  new Wappalyzer('https://techcrunch.com', options).analyze(),\n  new Wappalyzer('https://example.com', options).analyze(),\n];\nPromise.all(promises)\n  .then(results => {\n    process.stdout.write(JSON.stringify(results, null, 2) + '\\n');\nprocess.exit(0);\n\n})\n  .catch(error => {\n    process.stderr.write(error + '\\n')\nprocess.exit(1);\n\n});\n``. Closing this one a duplicate.. Thanks!. Thanks!. I added an option for it in the master branch, would you be able to test it? From the command line you can pass--proxy=. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thank you!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Would you be happy to help include some of your competitors as well? A new category makes sense if we have a handful of technologies to include.. Yes, thanks!. @enginaryum Thank you! I'm happy to merge this if you include a few others as mentioned in https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/issues/2307#issuecomment-390456608.. That was quick. Thank you.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Not quite right, Drupal uses several Symfony components but isn't built on it.. PR merged, thank you!. Perfect, thank you.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Merged, thanks both!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Cool!. Thanks!. Cool project but we have to be a little strict with the applications we include unfortunately.. Thanks!. Can you give an example of a website this happens on? Isn't it just an error on the web page?. Thanks!. Thank you!. Thanks!. Thanks!. There is a hardcoded 10 second timeout, I might change to use themaxWait` value. For now you can comment it out:\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/drivers/npm/index.js#L32.

Thanks!. It should work, what error are you getting?. Thanks!. It's a nice idea but I don't think we'd want to rely on websites reporting their own stack. I also think not many websites will make use of this feature. Finally, Wappalyzer intentionally doesn't make any requests to websites.. The indentation was changed from spaces to tabs. Would you mind re-submitting this pull request?. Closing because of inactivity.. Added in 0083cf14f1d0429c9ee5617b43806cb8c6a526f8.. Thanks!. Great, thanks. :). Cheers. :). Thanks!. I don't know how that got added in to be honest. We're using Yarn so there shouldn't even be a package-lock.json file.

Incorrect detections won't get fixed retroactively in the Lookup API unfortunately, as these are past results stored in a database. They disappear after a few months. I'll see if I can do something about it.. Thanks for the example. I can't reproduce the issue though, neither Google Analytics or Google Fonts show up for me.. I'm not sure what causes this. It's an issue with Zombie.js most likely.. What do you suggest?. Zombie.js is much, much leaner than headless Chrome and runs entirely in JavaScript, making it more portable.. It's now possible to use a different headless browser by crearting a wrapper, like this one for Zombie.js:\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/drivers/npm/browsers/zombie.js. Thanks!. Wappalyzer doesn't kick into gear until after a web page is loaded so I'm not sure how it might interfere with DNS resolution. I just tested it in Chrome and it works as expected.. Thanks!.

Thanks!. GTM doesn't do any analytics or tracking, I think we should keep the category and add things like Adobe DTM.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thank you!. Do you have an SVG version available? If not, would you mind resizing the PNG to 64x64?. Thanks!. Thank you!. There was a functioning port as some point but Microsoft's approval process is so atrocious that I gave up on it entirely. You can find Edge packages in older releases but they're no longer supported. You can use the bookmarklet version of Wappalyzer in Edge.. I'll look into why the bookmarklet isn't working.\nI went through all the motions with Microsoft and was invited to submit Wappalyzer to the store. Paid for a Windows license, developer license, supplied assets and information, filled out countless forms including tax details and what not, only to have the extension rejected without a reason or way to contact the reviewer. Not to mention their implementation of WebExtension is not up to spec with bugs they won't fix and the packaging process doesn't work natively on Linux or Mac OS. In contrast, submitting to Chrome and Firefox is as simple as uploading a ZIP file. Microsoft reached out to me a full year later offering some help but by that time I had already given up entirely.\nOlder releases include APPX packages for Edge but I'm not sure at what point the started/stopped working. You can try your luck here:\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/releases?after=v5.1.6. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thank you very much!. Thanks @shangul, I didn't know that. It's been corrected.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thank you!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thank you.. Thanks!. Sorry for the late reply. This is interesting. For a while now I've been thinking of using query selectors instead of regular expressions for HTML but it looks like the TreeWalker API is better suited?

I don't want to maintain two sets of icons, if there are any icons that are particularly problematic we can try finding a version that works on both light and dark backgrounds.

No IP addresses are being stored though, in accordance with privacy policy. I do apologise for the extension settings not being respected, that shouldn't have happened.\n. Thanks @DanH42, I just pushed v5.6.1 to fix these.. @jvoisin I'm all for it, of course. We don't have tests for the WebExtension driver currently.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!.

I like the idea of having an option to change the browser but I think it should be implemented the same way as the drivers. We could make driver.js more generic and add a browsers folder to include browser specific code.. @realhidden I added the ability to use a different headless browser as I described in my previous comment. This is the wrapper for Zombie.js, on which you can base yours:\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/drivers/npm/browsers/zombie.js. Thanks!. I'll update that, thanks!. It might be because maxDepth is set to 0.. Thank you!. Thanks!. By default only the URL you pass is scanned. You need to pass --recursive=1 to crawl the website.. Thanks!. Wappalyzer should work on any http:// or https:// request, but not file://. Is that what you mean?. Thanks, I'm including your suggested change.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Sorry about that. I just pushed another update to fix this. Please check your settings after upgrading to v5.5.7.. Thanks!. Fixed in 5.5.7. Sorry about that.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Documentation has been updated here:\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/drivers/npm/README.md\nThe correct line is:\njavascript\nconst Browser = require('./browsers/zombie');. I just pushed v5.6.1, please try that.. Added that one too, @doefler. Try v5.6.2.. @doefler I added events in v5.6.3, so you can do this:\n```javascript\nconst wappalyzer = new Wappalyzer(Browser, url, options);\nwappalyzer.on('visit', params => {\n  const { browser, pageUrl } = params;\n// browser.document\n});\n```. Please see #2531 .. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks @dejurin. I can't see the diff on here because it's too large, did you re-indent the entire file?\nI'll close this for now as I want to avoid including plugins and categories should only be added when it includes at least a handful of different technologies.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Can you please include the icon in the PR? Thanks!. Thanks!. I'm quite sure Jira runs on servers other than Apache Tomcat.\n. I understand why you added phpMyAdmin and FrontPage but I don't think they belong here. It should only detect phpMyAdmin when you're actually on a phpMyAdmin page, and FrontPage when you're on a page that has been created with FrontPage.\n. This pattern isn't strict enough, HTML patterns shouldn't match non-html text. It needs at least a <[^>]+ in it to match an HTML tag.\n. Some of these don't have a $ so that they match IPBoard_foobar as well. There is no advantage adding it.\n. Is there an advantage to having the $ though?\n. That may be true for very long strings (no point to keep scanning when you have a match.) I doubt you'd see a performance improvement here.\n. The HTML patterns would be many times slower then the JS ones. But I guess every bit helps.\n. Should this be [^;]+?\n. May want to escape that dot. :)\n. No need to escape the dot in a collection. Doesn't hurt either.\n. Dot should be escaped. ;)\n. Be sure to validate the JSON, there is a comma missing here. :)\n. Also, don't forget to escape the periods in the URL (\\\\.).\n. Did you copy this line from Bootstrap or does ZURB Foundation actually use Twipsy? I removed it for now.\n. firstRun and upgraded are now undeclared variables.\n. Sure, otherwise I'll add it in over the weekend.\n. This matches notblogspot.com. :)\n. Perhaps this should be (^|\\\\.)livejournal\\\\.com. Not sure if that works.\n. Same here.\n. Not exactly, before it matched *.blogspot.com.\n. I believe I did this because confidence levels would sometimes be counted several times giving incorrect results. Your solution is simpler but may be inaccurate.\n. I'm pretty sure some patterns can run multiple times, for instance onload will cause all env to be evaluated again. Counting the confidence multiple times will give a result that's too high.\n. An app may be detected using different methods which will add to the confidence level. It should stay the way it was, the rest of your changes can be merged in.\n. The dot will match any character, should it be escaped?\n. It should be \"^Ophal \" in that case, it will match anything starting with \"ophal\" followed by a space. All patterns are case insensitive.\n. Don't forget to escape the periods. Is the \"g\" supposed to be optional?\n. In that case it should be snap\\\\.svg.*\\\\.js (loose) or perhaps snap\\\\.svg(-min)?\\\\.js (strict). The period (.) matches any character, if you want to match a period it needs to be escaped (\\\\.).\n. The asteriks here just makes the \"v\" optional, it should be something like v[0-9]+\n. Please escape the double quotes!\n. You're no longer capturing the version number (\\\\;version:\\\\1). Should there be a space before the version number? Also should we keep supporting the old scheme?\nPerhaps we should go with something like this, making the \"CMS\" part optional.\nImpressPages (?CMS )?([\\\\d.]+)\\\\;version:\\\\1\n. In that case we can make \"CMS\" and the version number optional. This will pick up \"ImpressPages\", \"ImpressPages CMS 1.0\" and \"ImpressPages 1.0\":\nImpressPages(? CMS)?( [\\\\d.]*)\\\\;version:\\\\1\n. Right, so ImpressPages(?: CMS)?( [\\\\d.]*)\\\\;version:\\\\1.\n. @maskas Adding additional patterns broadens the results. The more the better.\n. Updated in Git, cheers.\n. Can you change this to \"www.discourse.org\"?\n. The ? should probably be escaped.\n. This should be \"headers\": { \"Server\": \"M.R. Inc Webserver\" }.\n. This pattern is too broad, it will match links and plain text. It should have an opening and closing bracket (and escaped dots), e.g. <link[^>]+resellerstat\\\\.mono\\\\.net/dtg[^>]+>. What are you trying to match?\n. If there is no indication which one is being used I'd rather not imply it. In this case both icons will be displayed even though we know that one of them will be wrong. If jQuery or Zepto is present on the page they will be identified anyway.\n. Please remove the trailing comma.\n. The HTML pattern is too broad; it matches plain text. Every HTML pattern should have at least a < in it, e.g. <[^>]+/binaries/(?:[^/]+/)*content/gallery/. Please also use non-capturing groups ((?:) instead of ()) unless to groups are used for version detection.\n. I don't believe the | need escaping. The + also seems superfluous?\n. It's a special character in groups (()) but not libraries ([]).\nIf that's the case I think [ |]+ is fine, or perhaps \\s*|\\s* (pipe optionally surounded by whitespace).\n. You can use \"script\": \"mg-(?:core|templates)\" instead.\n. The link will go to wappalyzer.com, why does it mention your page?\n. Can you update your pull request?\n. Syntax error, please remove the trailing comma. :)\n. The group is not needed, TweenMax(?:\\\\.min)?\\\\.js is sufficient.\n. It still seems broad but perhaps it's enough. Avoid the dot character in HTML patterns in order to not match plain text though and use non-capturing groups where possible. I think this will work:\n<div [^>]*class=\\\"[^\\\"]*(?:small|medium|large)-\\\\d{1,2} columns\n. This requires the HTML to start with a link tag. Perhaps just use <link href=\\\"/opencms/.\n. Just OpenCms should do.\n. Missing comma at the end here.\n. Another missing comma.\n. One comma too many at the end.\n. To ensure no plaintext can be matched, please change this to \"<link[^>]+?href=\\\"[^\\\"]+skeleton\\\\.css\".\n. Please remove the protocol from the URL, i.e. ckan.org.\n. Please match the case of the implies applications, i.e. Python instead of python.\n. It's not fixed yet. :)\n. Will this still match now that you changed the link? I'm guessing it won't.\n. This line can be removed, it's covered by the Snap and Yesod entries.\n. To capture the version number this should probably be Snap/(\\\\d+(?:\\\\.\\\\d+)+)\\\\;version:\\\\1. Same for Yesod.\n. I'd remove this line as obfuscated JavaScript often has one letter variables. You're likely to get false positives on JavaScript-heavy apps like Gmail.\n. No problem. Refer the wiki if you're interested:\nhttps://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/wiki/Specification\n. There is no application called CSS, please change it to \"implies\": \"jQuery\",\n. That's ok, running wappalyzer build will fix the order and indentation.\n. Aren't the patterns effectively identical?\n. In any case they should be identical so maybe it's a bug. Varnish is not the same as ^Varnish. All expressions are treated the same way though so I'm not sure why this would only occur in headers.\n. The protocol should not be included in the website address, please change this to penguin.docs.bqws.io.\n. Not sure what that means, are they spaces?\n. Can the capture group be used to identify the version number? If so, please add \\\\;version:\\\\1 to the pattern.\n. You're referencing a capture group which doesn't exist. Did you mean to wrap the digits in brackets? Also, you're defaulting to version 5 when no version information is present. This means you'll probably incorrectly identify Shopware 5 in certain scenarios.\n. Right, it makes sense now. I thought you meant to make the digits optional which would result in /web/cache/ being the entire pattern.\n. Is it possible to make this more specific? It will match any JavaScript files that ends with 'ar'.\n. This will match any page that has the word 'Arastta' on it. HTML patterns should at least contain < or >.\n. This matches any page that links to this URL which is probably not right.\n. Why not use the script field for this?\n. Should we make this Grav(?:CMS)? in order to match existing installations?\n. Let's not make it optional in that case, the more specific the better.\n. Did you mean to remove these?\n. If the env works than we should keep it in, it will identify the app when it's loaded through a different script.\n. This is too generic unfortunately. Minified code on website often have two letter variables that would result in a false negative.\n. This pattern should include HTML markup, something that can't match plaintext and only results in a detection on websites that use the application.\n. These HTML patterns are too generic and will result in false positives (Wappalyzer tries to match any, not all). The first pattern will match any website that uses canonical URLs.\n. The HTML patterns are too liberal and match plaintext. Please change it to something that contains a HTML opening tag, e.g. <[^>]+aurelia-app=.. This pattern is too liberal and should contain at least a HTML opening tag.. Minor point, you can use meta instead of html for these.. These can be shortened to [\\\"']. I'd say remove the html pattern. The env pattern is borderline too, many combinations of four-character variable names appear in minified JavaScript on sites like Google and Facebook.. Agree, it should be removed or made more specific.. Shouldn't this just be \"Nop\\\\.customer\"?. Please update this pattern to include a HTML tag. HTML patterns should not match plain text.. I'll merge it but it might be nice to change it to something like Storeden(?: (v[0-9.]+))?\\\\;version:\\\\1 so that Wappalyzer can display the version number.. <link[^>] Should be <link[^>]+ or it won't work.\n@denisdulici, @jvoisin is referring to this:\nhttps://wappalyzer.com/docs#new-application\n\nOnly widely used applications should be added. When creating a pull request, please include ten or more links to websites that use the application, a GitHub page with at least 1,000 stars or anything that will help establish the size of the user base. . Cookies are separated by semi-colons in a single header.. The backslash itself needs to be escaped in JSON, mind changing this to \"generator\": \"^Seamless\\\\.?CMS\".?. Should this be \"/_bi_sps_v.+\\\\.js\"?. Should this be \"<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"_sys_bind_[^\\\"]+\\\" id=\\\"_sys_bind_[^\\\"]+\\\" />\"?. It should be like mine. v* makes the v optional, v.+ means v followed by one or more characters.. Either pattern will work, yours is more specific. You don't need the brackets, (\\d+) is the same as \\d+ in this case.. The semicolon needs to be escaped, i.e. \"_gs\\\\;confidence:30\". I'll fix this one up.. env Only works with method's on the window object currently. @gadcam Proposed a change to change this (#1917).. Should this be .png or did you mean to include an SVG file?. HTML patterns should have at least an opening tag (<) to avoid it matching plain text.. I'm not too worried about the length but I think classes like el-form might result in a few false-positives as el is a fairly generic prefix. I'll include it for now.. \n",

Same problem here, with the same software: Firefox 10, Wappalyzer 2.0.6, Ubuntu 10.04 (x86_64).\nI opened a new profile, disabled every add-on (\"Ubuntu Firefox modifications\" included) and installed the file you've just posted. The browser still crashes almost instantly whenever I do anything that uses the network. I tried with different locales (quite a weird test, but just in case ;-).\nEDIT: I forgot to mention that it worked like a charm until the upgrade to Firefox 10\n. First off, thanks to you for a useful extension and for your nice support!\nI tried both versions (2 and 3). None did crash Firefox. And the 3rd one is functional, also!\nI'm curious, what's the problem with that onload() function?\n. That's it. It's still working.\nEDIT: I'm sorry, I replied before I saw your last message. I've tried with v4. I'm going to try now v5.\nEDIT2: Nope, it crashed again. I'd say the problem is the '''wrappedJSObject''' call itself\n. v6 crashes. I think it crashes just by iterating wrappedJSObject (?)\n. It still crashes.\nI've made the following changes:\n```\n    var promptService = Components.classes[\"@mozilla.org/embedcomp/prompt-service;1\"].getService(Components.interfaces.nsIPromptService);\n    promptService.alert(null, \"DEBUG\", content.wrappedJSObject);\nfor ( i in content.wrappedJSObject ) {\n    promptService.alert(null, \"DEBUG\", i);\n    //if ( typeof i === \"string\" )\n    //env.push(i);\n}\n\n```\nIt shows an alert box with the text [object Window], and after clicking on \"OK\", another one with the text window appears. Before you can press \"OK\" on that second alert window, or do anything else, the program crashes.\n. Mmm, seems it's somewhat asynchronous... I mean, the number of windows that appear isn't always the same; usually, only the \"window\" one shows up, but sometimes I see \"window\", then \"document\" and maybe, or maybe not, a couple more, and then Firefox crashes. I'll do some more tests and report back in a few minutes.\n. OK, after a lot of trial and error, I've found that this seems to work (note that Object.keys is available since Firefox 4):\n```\n    var jsobj = content.wrappedJSObject;\n    var ks = Object.keys(jsobj);\nfor ( var k = 0; k < ks.length; k++ ) {\n    var i = jsobj[ks[k]];\n    if ( typeof i === \"string\" ) env.push(i);\n}\n\n```\nPlease check the code still works as expected.\nI'm starting to think that there is some serious breakage inside Firefox 10. As an example, read what happens to zotero (another ffox extension): http://forums.zotero.org/discussion/21716/\n. Yup, you're right. I guess I got kind of seasick after too many changes back and forth ;-)\nThose two lines seem to work flawlessly, though I'll test it during the next couple of days. I'm also looking forward to see raamee's feedback.\nBTW I don't get why a simple iteration like for ( i in content.wrappedJSObject ) wreaks havoc in the browser. Maybe it's a mismatch in libraries specific to Ubuntu 10.04, or something on that line. Perhaps a bug report should be filed.\nI have to go now. Thanks for all your time and effort!\n. ",

I found a lot of pattern to cut url with a lot of mistakes... so with every different pattern I did one that should work for every url:\n/^((https?:\\/\\/))?(([\\w-].)+(\\w{1,6}))(:[0-9]{1,5})?(\\/[\\w-~.]+)(\\/([\\w-.])(\\?[\\w+-.%=&])?)?(#[a-z][\\w-]*)?$/\nThere is just to compare the third selection!\nThe only problem I detect is when the site address is an IP or when the extension is .co.uk, just the last two number or .co.uk are in the third parameter.\nSo every page charged with an IP with the same two last number or in .co.uk will be detected as the same website, not perfect but with less false positive than the actual system.\n. Sorry, I'm yet at school, I know that my English is not so good... I do what I can.\nWhat I tried to say was about this bug : \"With headers detection applications of other sites are detected\"\nI attempt to write a pattern to detect the domain of the request like github.com to compare with the url's domain in order to detect just app of the site.\nBut that's hard because the tld can be composed like .co.uk and a sub-domain can be present or not.\nSo the best regular expression I found for the moment is :\n/^(https?:\\/\\/)?(([\\w-]*.)+(\\w{1,6}))(:\\d{1,5})?/\nThat's not perfect for the moment... but that's a track.\n. I had understood, for stats there is no problem. But for users we need to display every app in the same domain. For exemple : My web site is exemple.com, I use a CDN at cdn.exemple.com a app detected on the CDN is used to send the page to the user, if I use Varnish cache and nginx in the CDN it has to be detected for the master page. It's my point of view, I'm maybe wrong, but every app used on the same domain to \"build\" a page have to be displayed.\n. Sorry I disagree for some case the header are removed for html content and not for static content, and for most (I think) case the sub-domain is ran on the same server. For me every app used to render directly a page have to be displayed.\nAt least every apps on the same sub-domain!\nIn the worst case we can implement 3 methods to select the apps (detected with the headers) and leave in the option the choice :\n1. Apps in the page (=url)\n2. Apps on the same sub-domain\n3. Apps on the same domain\nIf you choose this option we have to implement the three, for the first two it won't be so difficult (but for the last we should improve the expression to have a reliable matching.)-->Maybe not...\nFor the first we just have to compare the 'url' variable.\nFor the second we just have to compare the (window.)'location.host'(name) variable.\nFor the third we have to take 'location.host' and cut it with a regexp or use something from this website http://publicsuffix.org/list/ but it will be very costly I think.\n. Wappalyzer yet do this job if I'm right since he detects apps for other websites.\nFor iframes I don't know I don't think about it for the moment.\nThe simple \"www\" is a sub-domain and some webmasters use the www for some things and nothing for others, so what should be detect? Some other webmasters use the sub domain to define the language what should be done?\nOkay sub-domain are often pointed to a different server but for me it enterer on the renderer of the page (and it's not always).\nI think leave the user choose is the best way. For me the option 2 \"same sub-domain\" is the minimum, but it's quite subjective.\n. You don't understand what I'm saying, I agree with you on these points.\nWhat I suggest is to restrict the results from those we have now with either the url or the domain or the subdomain.\nIt a suggestion only for what is displayed for the users it won't affect your stats.\nEDIT : Try to browse http://www.kapook.com/ analysing Wappalyzer activity if you can, this page does 491 request as it you can see the real impact of the extension\n. Okay, so I didn't understand since the beginning how are filtered the request... can you show me where is the code doing this job?\n. Thanks, I'll look that...\nI find something else strange : sometimes when I load a page the icons on the address bar they disappear and reappear \nwithout stopping. It's shown in this screen cast : http://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/cliOlbKn8\n. That is exactly what you say. And we can separate a fast and a slow \"flicker\". I don't know since what version of Firefox it does that.\n. Thanks. I found that strange but that is what is written on their site :\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA044/Supported+Platforms\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA044/Supported+Platforms\n. Yes, it's strange... it looks like Tomcat and Apache are working together, they explain a same organisation with IIS too. But you should be right, tweaking it must be possible to run another server.\n. It's hard to write an efficient pattern first because the code used is very common and secondly because the code is used reused by FrogCMS.\nSo if you want to write a pattern you should check the common part of code between these two files :\nhttp://www.phpkode.com/source/p/frogcms/frog/app/layouts/backend.php\nhttps://github.com/wolfcms/wolfcms/blob/master/wolf/app/layouts/backend.php\n. Hello,\nI agree with @ElbertF. I reflect to that feature.\nAnd I think if we want to implement that we could start just with headers with one type of applications for example and then extend little by little.\nBut for applications that do not explicitly send their version number it's quite hard but doable for some as Joomla, to do pattern for that applications we will need very precise pattern and so people who work everyday with those.\n. I think in a first time just getting the versions numbers wrote in the code will be already a great improvement. Like the expression of jquery, the pattern wouldn't be so hard to write :\nNginx : headers: { 'Server': /nginx\\/([\\d.]+)/i } \nApache : headers: { 'Server': /Apache\\/([\\d.]+)/i }\nPHP : headers: { 'Server': /PHP\\/([\\d.]+)/i }\nFor a lot of applications the scheme to detect version is   /_\\/([\\d.]+)/ where _ is the default pattern to detect the app.\n. I don't know if having different entries for each major version is a good idea for app that don't need a specific pattern per version... it would increase a lot the apps.js, but that can be a solution.\nFor the website you can simply keep the system app by app and create a drop-down menu where the stats are separated in version. (I don't know if you were talking about that...)\nIt will be a pretty good stuff to display versions, at this time Wappalyzer will be really powerful!\n(The project cost is estimated at 29533$ at this address http://www.ohloh.net/p/wappalyzer)\n. Of course, and sometimes there is nothing for the same reasons... we just have to write something like that (I know that false but it's the idea) :\n``` JavaScript\nif ( data[type][version] != null) {\n                                        version.push(version);\n                                    break;\n                                }\n\n```\n. I think it's the only good solution!\nBut I think the logic hadn't to be there while the version is in clear in the code, it's useless and it while be less precise than the raw data.\nHowever  we can detect a version using logic if a part of the pattern is version specific.\n. I'm with @SebastianLopienski on every ideas.\n. I think there will be very few other cases than that one:\n\nPHP 5\nPHP     # no version detected\nPHP 5.4\n\nAnd why this can't be merged? :\n\nApache 2 (beta)\nApache 2.2\n\nYou can just match (.d)+ and then you use the first logic. The only particular cases are with pre,alpha,beta and maybe one or two other.\nSo I think we just need, in a first time this two logics. The extensible syntax is perfect for me.\nI think we should do something to have pattern matching version from X.x (to Y.y).\nWhat is the final decision about confidence?\nGood holidays @ElbertF !\n@SebastianLopienski : there is exactly one year I visit a part of the CERN, it was great!, and if you put your Python port on Github I surely can help.\n. I agree but it could be a big step forth to have the possibility to use pattern to select headers. I don't say \"Select everything and leave do\" but if we can select Server and X-Powered-By in a single time with /(X-Powered-By|Server)/\nOr we can select everything less hazardous headers like Set-Cookie with /.*(?!Set-Cookie)/!\nI thing this possibility for devs and the versions numbers could be the base of an alpha 3.0 (or alpha 2.3).\n. You're right that's not a good idea\nBut if something like this is writeable tell me :\njavascript\n'X-Powered-By', 'Server': /Debian/\n'X-Powered-By' and 'Server': /Debian/\n. Damn it, thanks. :)\n. Another valid pattern is :\njavascript\nheaders: { 'X-Powered-By': /PleskLin/i }\n. There is an error : the new Ruby pattern is inverted (name and content)\n. It's not always so easy but I think it's the solution too.\n. You can just detect : option=com_\nI verified with google it's enough precise, it would detect almost every not rewrited url generated by joomla\njavascript\nurl: /option=com_/\n. Maybe we can bypass this limitation making chrome believe that there is just a long icon with a container or something like that.\nDo you know some hack like that?\n. Hi,\nI think it's a very bad idea to implement that!\nFirstly because everything detected by Wappalyzer can be detected by browsing the code, the DOM or the headers... that is really easy with firebug or just with firefox's tools!\nSecondly because you can prevent all that disclosures of information and that YOUR job if you care about security. And if you are on shared hosting, as me, very few hackers (or no-one?) will gain the access to your site with just your web server and your programming language! And one of these, if they exist, doesn't need any help of Wappalyzer or something like that!\nThirdly just 2 or 3 line of code changed would be necessary to bypass that \"protection\", that restriction!\nSo I summarizes : that will protect you from script-kiddies that can't use firebug...\nWe mustn't implement that because it's a restriction and  some code more for nothing!\nI have websites in production so I know  what you fear about. But you're fighting with yourself, Wappalyzer is a great tool to know what can a normal dev can know about your site and you have nothing to say against that because it use a passive method to analyse pages : there is no prejudice.\nCordially.\n. I maintain that we don't need to implement that function. Some-one enough gifted to hack a CMS, badly configured sure, know exactly the pattern we use to detect the CMSs. I use the extension as you...\nKeeping the detection in all case some will realize that a website has to be secured, generally the simple fact to be aware of the risks and a very few tips is sufficient to prevent an attack.\nDevelopers that are afraid about Wappalyzer's detections are not enough conscientious... they just have to erase the very visible hint of the presence of something.\n. Enable detection of 3Dcart in #152\n. We could test Wappalyzer with PhamtomJS or with CasperJS http://kvz.io/blog/2012/11/03/highlevel-testing-with-casperjs/ that is based on PhantomJS\n. Don't know for w.driver.lastDisplayed.\nBut in fact we should load the interface at each event on #wappalyzer container with a code like that :\n``` javascript\nvar container = window.document.getElementById(\"wappalyzer-container\");\nif (container.addEventListener)\n{\n}\n```\nIf I'm right it will avoid useless call and so flickering and it will enable changes at anytime, at the while if I understood it's at each tabchange.\n. Here is the full list of app supported by W. that are imported :\njquery, jquery-ui, raphael, modernizr, underscore, backbone\nIf  I deactivate spliting of URL at # (driver.js#L108) it display tipekit, clicky and nginx.\nThe first problem is there.\nAnd there is maybe some more problems cause one time I saw :\n[wappalyzer debug] 4 apps detected: Backbone.js, Raphael, Typekit, Underscore.js\nAnd it doesn't displayed them but I don't if the line 108 was working or not...\n. I think a pattern like that should work for every, or almost Moodles:\njavascript\n<input[^>]+name=\"sesskey\"+[^/>]\nI verified it detects only Moodle.\n. It seems too generic but I used google and I don't find any other apps initializing it in html code.. so if I'm right there is only Moodle that used it.\n(https://www.google.fr/search?q=input%20%22sesskey%22%20-moodle%20-Moodle2.0 or https://www.google.fr/search?q=%22sesskey%22%20-moodle%20-Moodle2.0)\n. Right but when google don't find it is either private or very rare.\nI think it's enough precise to be include... as you want.\nI found another pattern but not more precise :\njson\n\"script\": \"/lib/javascript-mod\\\\.php\"\n. And if we want to continue in that way there is at least this problems on the website : \nMissing apps:\n-Alloy\n-AMPcms\n-altassian confluence\n-altassion jira\n-banshee (1, 18)\n-CFML\n-ClickHeat\n-Contens\n-David Webbox\n-Exhibit\n-Gentoo\n-Indexhibit\n-Javascript Infovis Toolkit\n-jqPlot\n-jQuery Sparklines\n-JS Charts\n-LEPTON\n-Liferay\n-NOIX\n-Timeplot\nOther problems:\nChameleon==>chameleon cms and website of the app http://www.chameleon-system.de/\nDynamicweb not present in 'web-shops' (6) and in'analytics' (10)\neZ Publish not present in 'web-shops' (6)\n. Yes a little but it's outdated but there are all apps missing at the end of august...\nSorry it's a raw list : I think the website is right for the name and the addon as to change from Chameleon to Chameleon CMS : http://www.chameleon-system.de/content-management-system/\n. Yes, sorry I forgot the pattern I thought it was specific, so we should name it 'Chameleon' if we don't find something to distinguish the shop and the CMS.\nPS: I think you do really a great work for this addon but in my opinion it could be a good a idea to open less issues and regroup changes/bugs/ideas of the same kind in a unique issue...\n. Ok I thought it was easier with less issue because I'm lost very quickly.. sorry q--.\nIn your last comment you're speaking addon-side or I should have a cache problem as there is no change for these apps on the website..\n. The website is right it's a cache tool\n. @q--  I don't use Github for Windows but Git (and notepad++ to edit the code) because I found it too distant from the modification you can do.. and I never had that problem. And if I'm right Github for Windows is very recent and so not really stable.\n. It's effectively the end of lines, in the origin file it's 0A(in Hex) or \\n so LF, the Unix end line caracter, and in your file it's 0D0A or \\r\\n so CRLF... \nAnd in WinMerge if I convert the ends lines there is no others changes then the wanted.\nYou should use this software if you want to convert this quickly to a mergeable content.\n. The only difference is when you open it with a hex editor...\nBut know if you save the file it will be ok as there is no other problems.\n. Fine but for Google Friend Connect don't add it back!! It doesn't exist anymore! Google stopped it!\n. Ajax shopping cart is used in other apps as osCommerce so I think you should remove it..\n. http://www.oscommerce.com/community/contributions,7477\nI think it's a generic addon...\n. It was a mistake yes... but I'm almost sure at least ajax_shopping_cart.js will report false-positive.\nLook at this page and tell me if it runs TomatoCart or not : http://www.rentsuez.com/\n. It's the same case as 'rentsuez' for every site build with \"webbuilder.es\"...\n. Done in #140 and with 1.8.3pre !\n. I choose v1.8.3pre because 1.8.1 and 1.8.2 doesn't wanted to work with grunt, I surely forgot something to make them work..\n. I maybe misunderstood but I think Chrome Frame is only for IE... so we won't detect it in another browser..\n. De rien. C'est avec joie que je contribue \u00e0 Wappalyzer! :)\n. Yes and there is also  detectMe = stuff\nFor RequireJS it would be ok because there is a \"jQuery =\" declaration.\nI think it's the same for every js loader : the app need the variable and so it's defined.\nWe just need to list every minimalist way to declare a variable in js.\n. You're right... but I thing even for js loaded there will be a very few that couldn't be detected just by downloading the scripts files included.\n. Why don't we want to find b? It will be even more efficient. I never told to do a second time the request we just have to analyse the scripts already downloaded.\nIn fact I wanted to get rid of V8 because it's a dependency and so if we can avoid to have some it's better.. and as you say after it's not sandboxed for the moment.\nBut if you don't want to try to convert W. in pure PHP I can close the issue, I thought it will be lighter and more responsive as it.\n(And do you want to keep jQuery for the Firefox's and Chrome versions?)\n. I just remove the jQuery files for html and bookmarklet drivers because they weren't used.\n. In fact it's really hard because a CMS is compatible with a type (or more) of database like SQL based. So you can say that there is a programming language that is SQL for example but I don't find any app that is database specific.\nBut if you found some it could be very interesting!\n. Done in #181.\n. You're welcome! I forgot some have multiple categories..\nI use Github for Windows if I'm pretty sure it's the culpit, I ask the Github team now if it's a feature... or a bug!\n(I found that but I think the default parametter should be 'don't modify' https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings)\n. In fact it's not a bug it's the default setting... The Github team told me that they will maybe change it.\n. The shop seem to be an extension of the CMS... but I don't know because I don't speak German.\nDetected for me with Win7, Firefox 16.0.2 with the version 2.5.2.\n. I the issue is to close.\n. --\" I forgot to configure corectly this computer too! I'll remake a pull request tomorrow morning..\n. Closed to make a correct pull request\n. Yes, 52 of them have been compressed..\n. I think the most part of these bugs come from the replacing of jQuery function that should be something like : \njavascript\nsomeParentObject.appendChild(someChildObject, someParentObject.firstChild);\nsomeParentObject.insertBefore(someChildObject, someParentObject.firstChild);\nBut it leads to other bugs...\n. Oh yes thanks for the fix! I surely modified something else trying to correct it...\n. Ok, I saw but I don't know at all jetpack... I will see that API.\nIt's maybe a good idea to rewrite completely the app.. I don't know.\nI think just doing what I see above and throwing away 2 or 3 bugs and it will be ok.\nThe thing that make it harder is that when the app is initializing there is no windows element .\n. Thanks I read a good part of the doc. and it's very good documentation. It seems to be simple and precise.\nI think we should use only function of the High-Level API.\nI begin to have an idea of what it will be and having a look to the possibility I thought to the future feature we could add after rewriting.\nJetpack seems to be fantastic! I begin scripting at the end of the week.\n. Well done ! It's a good step ahead ! I will have a look at it soon.\n. Hum... looks strange! But I think you shoul report it to \"Access Me\" dev because Wappalyzer is compatible from 4.0 to 19.0 and \"Access Me\" from  2 to 3.7(dev) so you're using at least version 4.0. And it's access me that is not develloped to runfrom 4.0 to X.X so I think you should report it to Access Me's devs... I think the problem don't come from wappalyzer!\nAnd at this day this addon XSS Me and SQL Inject Me from the same editor do the same thing I think...\n. It seems to be a conflit while listening a tab : \n\nErreur\u00a0: This sometimes happens... dueto the tab listener unregestring this first.[Exception... \"Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIWebProgress.removeProgressListener]\"  nsresult: \"0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)\"  location: \"JS frame :: chrome://global/content/bindings/browser.xml :: removeProgressListener :: line 465\"  data: no]\nFichier Source\u00a0: chrome://accessme/content/overlay.js\nLigne\u00a0: 104\n\nEDIT: Finally it seems to be the JSON.parse() function that doesn't work anymore when access me is activated.\n. It should be that or it turn it in a \"compatibility mode\"... with the version specified in the addon the JSON was not fully natively supported...\n. But we can maybe store header and environnement variables in a sort of cache untill you change of page, no?\n. I think it has been discussed in #201 ... You should use the bookmarklet (http://wappalyzer.com/bookmarklet). Or if you want something different you could explain a bit more.\n. You're welcome :)\n. I think something is really wrong with the Drupal's pattern because some found Drupal also on Facebook...\n. Exact the Drupal(.extend)?.+settings detected gmail when I loaded the inbox with the notification of your comment... and in this page!\nBut for the two others pattern it's quite hard to prove they detect something else than Drupal, I did research on the header pattern but I didn't find nothing else Drupal... and the third is generic but in fact there are 8 patterns to test..\n. See #213 ...\n. I though it's possible to check the value of the variable because I believe some userscripts sometimes access some variable of other pieces of code. I think it's doable.\nConsider the example of Cachefly :\njavascript\n\"headers\": { \"Server\": \"^CFS \", \"X-CF1\": \".+\", \"X-CF2\": \".+\" }\nWill be\njavascript\n\"headers\": { \"Server\": \"^CFS \", \"X-CF1\", \"X-CF2\"  }\nOr for Altassian Confluence :\njavascript\n\"headers\": { \"X-Confluence-Request-Time\": \".*\" },\nWill be simplified as\njavascript\n\"headers\": \"X-Confluence-Request-Time\",\nI don't know if it's feasible or very useful but it could simplify and, if the code to do this is optimized, more efficient.\n. You're right for the two point, thank for the explanations.\nEdit: when I spoke about \"userscripts\" I mean the scripts run by greasemonkey... I think we can do it without breaking the page but on heavy HTML5 page it would slow a lot if we don't find a trick.\n. See #213 & #218 ... And generally use the search engine.\n. You're welcome! I was guessing : when the next official version will be released?\n. Ok, it seems to work also for me.\nBut concerning the edited patterns I maybe forgot some ? when the version number can be displayed or not so it could affect number of detection.\n. I was just fixing it.. thanks. :)\nYes I fixed some Django detection bug if in the referent page url there were \"django\" it was detected.\nIn fact it's the csrfmiddlewaretoken pattern that is falsely attributed to django, it used by a language I don't remember which.\n. Thanks! I redo a mergeable push.\n. Thanks, I correct the errors in a few minute.\n. It's a good idea to add .cfm files to ColdFusion pattern : \n\"url\": \".cfm$\"\nBut why don't you explain us how did you detect the websites were using these CMS ?\n. As ElbertF explain me in a collection you don't need to escape the dot. The pattern is okay there is nothing to change.\nIn fact it didn't detect it because very often you need to reload the page to detect the applications using headers.\n. You could just put something like: \njavascript\n\"script\": \"bittads\\\\.com/js/bitt\\\\.js$\"\n. Maybe a simplest regex could be : \njavascript\n^phpSQLiteCMS( ([\\\\da-z.]+))?$\\\\;version:\\\\2\n. Because I didn't think it was the same :p\n. Done in #265 \n. Corrected in #265\n. Done in #265\n. We could simply search these mistakes using regex like I did in notepad using an UI like jsonlint.com\nExample:\n-A not escaped dot: ^\\s{3}\"[^wi].+[^]{2}.[^+*].+$ (Warning)\n-A html pattern without <>: ^\\s{3}\"html\"[^<>]+$      (Error)\nThen we could verify paging using regex like that:\nHeaders: ^\\t{3}\"headers\":\\s{(\\s\"[\\w-]+\":\\s\"[^\"]+\",?)+\\s},?$\nEnv: ^\\t{3}\"env\":\\s\"[^\"]+\",?$\nImplies: ^\\t{3}\"implies\":\\s([(\\s\".+\",?)+\\s]|\"[^\"]+\")$ (Line 995 error...)\n. Then we could add an option either check line changed (using diff) or the whole file.\n. Done in #265\n. The original commit is #766 \n. Bonjour,\nJe pense que \u00e7a doit fonctionner...\nPourriez-vous donner des exemples de sites utilisant Magento pour v\u00e9rifier que le pattern suivant fonctionne?\n \"env\": \"Enterprise.templatesPattern\"\nCordialement,\nCamille\n. I forgot to escape the dot, with that pattern it does work on that demo: http://enterprise-demo.magentocommerce.com/\n\"env\": \"Enterprise\\.templatesPattern\"\n. You're right my syntax was wrong so it matched....\nThe trick of @q-- is really interesting! I think it could even replace a lot of html element loading document.body.(childNodes|children).[0-9].(childNodes|children).[0-9]..... as JS objets it could be a lot more accurate and simple to write an html pattern! But it's very redundant with the firstChild, firstElementChild, lastChild, lastElementChild, nextElementSibling, nextSibling ... we will need to make a sorting or it's firebug that create all these objets?\n. @ElbertF No it's exactly the same as the CSS trick of --q but for html. W\u00e9 just need to read the DOM as we already do.\n. Hi,\nIt's already detected : http://wappalyzer.com/applications/expressionengine\nBut you maybe can improve the pattern?\n. This issue can be closed.\n. The buggy code should be Firefox specific :\nThe Chrome extension doesn't cause that issue on my computer. I didn't think the extension could be the culprit so since months I use Chrome to check my Hotmail mailbox.\nI think the  \"Add exception\" feature seem to be a good temporary solution or even can be useful for some user.\n. Do you know if this CMS is popular or not ?\nIf we want to detect this cms the only way I found is to match plain html :/\njs\n\"html\": \"<img [^>]+src=\\\"images/validate/flatnuke_powered\\\\.png\"\n. I think you can close this issue.\n. There is a confidence of 50% for Windows, it seems normal to me.\nThe only thing we could do is to say some thing like \"there is Mono so there is ASP.net but there is absolutely not Win or IIS\". (I don't think a new issue is needed)\n. I think redhat should override UNIX it's a very common situation..\n. Hi,\nThey are both detected for me, seems strange.. What is your browser and your OS?\n. OS: Win7\nBrowser:\n                 -Firefox --> Ok\n                 -Chrome 26.0.1410.64 m\n-->Doesn't work and show an error in the console\nRefused to execute inline script because it violates the following Content Security Policy\ndirective: \"script-src 'self' https://github.com https://a248.e.akamai.net https://jobs.github.com\nhttps://ssl.google-analytics.com https://secure.gaug.es https://collector.githubapp.com https://gist.github.com\".\n\nThe design of the top bar is broken.\n. Why did you close the issue? Did you find a solution? I still got the problem on last version of Chrome...\n. I created an issue to put the slow patterns : #307 \nBut in fact the profiler is really new and I think it is buggy because it always show on slow pages a pattern between line 1877 and line 1883... So this pattern is certainly slow but that is not it...\n. I got the same issue but I don't know from where it come from..\n. Your idea seems a bit tricky : I don't think it will reduce time of execution and how will you detect if it's one or one other app that was matched? Ok that's feasible but after you have to take in count version and confidence...\nIt would be a lot of work for no result I think...\nBut we could improve performance yet by optimizing regex and maybe as ElbertF says by matching on less content because it was select before. For me the new chrome version perform a lot better!!\n. Time:1.296s\nApp:osCSS\nType:html\nPattern:\njavascript\n/<body onload=\"window\\.defaultStatus='oscss templates';\"/i\nURL: http://lifehacker.com/ | http://www.theverge.com/ (Time: 6.609s)\nSolution: Delete this pattern and use \"meta\": { \"generator\": \"osCSS-(\\d)\\;version:\\1\" } \n. I think when the profiler will be ok you could use the \"ping\" instead of this issue to know what are the slowest pattern and display that on the website with a message \"Help improving pattern...\". And so select the 3 slower pattern on each page or the pattern that takes more than xxx ms in the limit of 10, or something like that.\nEdit: And why not divide the page in subcategories by tag or something like that using the DOM directly.\n. Close as the slowest pattern is always around osCSS.\nHowever we could keep in mind that html patterns are the slowest.\n. With the latest apps.json Wappalyzer seems to detect all these installation of Vanilla Forums.\nCould you confirm it's ok for you ?\n. Ok so could you detail a bit more the situation : what is your OS, browser, version of the addon and on what site the bug could be reproduced?\n. No problem for me using Win7, Chrome (Version 30.0.1599.101 m) and wappalyzer 2.26.\nDo you have the latest version of the addon ? (You can get it there : https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wappalyzer/gppongmhjkpfnbhagpmjfkannfbllamg/details)\n. Yes, it's really strange ! Did you try to delete and reinstall the addon ?\n. For me, on http://forums.penny-arcade.com/, it shows Vanilla and PHP in more.\n. Fine. But can you tell us with what are we conflicting ?\n. If there is no new informations I think we can close that issue.\n. For me using the firefox addon Knockout.js is detected, as ToBeFree told could you explain more what is the problem ? Otherwise we should close the issue.\n. This issue can be closed.\n. Could you precise a bit more your idea because I don't understand how detect the adobetag domain will help in detecting SiteCatalyst as the s_account env var will match on all the installation of SiteCatalyst if I understand well how it works.\n. Ok now I understand but on your example I don't see any request to adobetag.com is it using a CDN or something like that ?\n. The new CDN domain seems to be assets.adobedtm.com. With this push I think it will be ok tell me if you know a website that is not detected with these changes.\n. Look at the forks, I think the two commits done in this one, for example, will do what you want : \nhttps://github.com/perchouli/Wappalyzer\n. You can merge if everything is ok.\n. I completely agree with you commit ! I just don't know if ElbertF will agree..\n. They are already detected see apps.json but you could surely contribute by writing a better pattern or suggesting something !\nRead the wiki to see how to do it.\n(If you just want to know the complete list of apps detected see applications page on wappalyzer.com)\n. Using the latest firefox and chrome addons I see it. Could you give more details on your system (OS, Browser, Version of the addon) ?\n. It uses jQuery 1.8.1.\nThe culprit pattern is :\njson\n \"([\\\\d.]+)/jquery(\\\\.min)?\\\\.js\\\\;version:\\\\1\"\nIt's detecting that\njs\n<script src=\"/templates/gordonlegalfinal4/jquery.js\"></script>\nI can't help you more : I don't know in what case that pattern should match.\n. I couldn't reproduce it using the latest firefox addon but I think you're pointing out the problem reported in #272 and #327.\n. In the newer version I don't think I encounter this problem but it reminds something. So if the problem is solved could you close the issue ?\n. Perfect ! Thank you for reporting the issue.\n. You're right : it means that the version is 4.1< see http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/security-howto.html\nWe could add a pattern like that\njs\n\"X-Powered-By\": \"Apache Tomcat/([\\\\d.]+)\\\\;version:\\\\1\"\nbut I never saw that header and it is disabled by default so it will match on a very few websites.\nI think you can close the issue after my pull request.\n. Hi,\nIt has been fixed yesterday (see #367) so you could just update to 2.7.4 on addons mozilla.\nGadcam\n. Ok so as told in the wiki try that to enable debugging :\n-Navigate to about:config and set extensions.wappalyzer.debug to true.\n-Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+J brings up a console for debugging.\nAnd then paste there what you see in the console.\n. You paste from the good place but there is no content from the addon..\nTry to disable all the tabs less the JS one and then relaunch the browser and then repaste the content of the console.\n. @selwynpolit : You're maybe yet using 2.7.3 try to update to 2.7.4. If you're using 2.7.4 it's very strange because I have no error in apps.json !\n. Hi,\nCould you precise a bit more : website, OS, Browser, versions of the addon and the browser...\n. I dit not experience this so if you don't have an example URL I think we can close this issue.\n. Could you do a little less commits ?\nYou're spamming our mailboxes and making unclear the history by working like that !\nAll your commits should be one or two max !\n. The only lines comming from the addon are : \nd.getElementById(...) is null driver.js:338\nCode:\njavascript\nd.getElementById('wappalyzer-addonbar').appendChild(d.getElementById('wappalyzer-container'));\nd.getElementById(...) is null driver.js:343\nCode : \njavascript\nd.getElementById('wappalyzer-addonbar').setAttribute('collapsed', prefs.getBoolPref('addonBar') ? 'false' : 'true');\nThis piece of XUL isn't working enough : \nXML\n<toolbar id=\"addon-bar\">\n                <toolbarbutton id=\"wappalyzer-addonbar\" popup=\"wappalyzer-menu\"/>\n</toolbar>\nIt looks like the problem is there : https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=941903\nA workaround could be to make it restartless.\n. @AliasIO I think you can close this issue.\n. I totally agree with @q--  : the users won't understand that new design !\nSince I use the v3 (or Chrome) I find really annoying to have to click to see the whole list. I think the key of the success of W. is mainly that you can see with what a website without having to take care of that. It's more \"Oh look this site is built with _ ! Surprising !\"\nI think the best is to keep the \"old style\" and to introduce the new style leaving the choose to the user. And then you could do stats on the picked option with the ping.\nI'm not yet on Aurora so I don't know if it's shocking with the new style.\n. You're right for the Chrome version and that after a while the users will be ok with the changes. I think there is more user of the Chrome version because Chrome is more popular and that W. had some problems of lag.\nHowever the possibility to check what make a site work at a glance is, for me, what is really interesting in this addon.\nI agree the addon has to be simple, I don't really know what is the great compromise..\nEdit : In more we don't all prioritize the app in the same way.. \n. The new version looks good ! The only thing I noticed is that the star to bookmark a page is at the left of the icons, it's maybe personal.\n. What's the problem for now ? For me with the last version of the addon (3.0.1) and firefox 28.0 it's as before : with the icons in the address bar.\n. Sorry I understood in the address bar.\n. I agree we need to find a better pattern but before we need to talk about what should match or not.\n. Good job ! Thank you for the regex ?\nCan we replace {2,3,4,5,6,7,8} by {2,8} ?\n. It works perfectly for me I'm using notepad++ so I specify the flags gmi elsewhere but it's only change I do.\nAnd so your regex found errors on Apache Hadoop at line 177, Apache HBase at line 182 and on Doxygen at line 748.\nIn fact I think a better version would be\n/\"(:?html|url|script|meta|headers|env)\"[^\\n]+([^\\][^\\].(?:com|org|net|[a-z]+))/gmi\nAnd so you will alse found errors on Google AdSense at line 1018, on MOBOTIX at line 1656 and on SiteCatalyst at line 2389.\nA false positive is to notice at line 2795 because I didn't care about the meta field syntax.\nEDIT: even simpler as the cases com/org/net are taken in count by the [a-z]+\n/\"(:?html|url|script|meta|headers|env)\"[^\\n]+([^\\][^\\].[a-z]+)/gmi\n. It shows RiteCMS 2.1.0 for me too in Firefox 28.\n. Seems to be something like https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/showbug.cgi?id=98830\n. Does it occur in Firefox 30 with the latest Wappalyzer version ?\n. The only things I notice on websites using the new version are : \n-Scripts are loaded from DOMAIN.TLD/Scripts/vendor/\n-Sometimes there are js file like that DOMAIN.TLD/bundles/js?v=[a-Z\\d]+\n-Sometimes there are form with a field that match /umbraco/Surface/\nEDIT : <[^>]+=\"/umbraco/surface/ would match on a few more website\nThen on the backend side we can notice these env vars Umbraco UmbSpeechBubble UmbClientMgr.\nWhat should I add to the Umbraco's pattern ?\n. Everything is working for me with\nWappalyzer 3.0.1\nFirefox 28.0\nWindows 7 32 bits\nAre you using the latest version ? \nVous pouvez la t\u00e9l\u00e9charger \u00e0 cette adresse https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/wappalyzer/.\n. You can find all these html patterns slowing down the detection scanning the entire HTML with\njavascript\n\"html\"[^\\n]+\\.[+*]\n. I think this issue can be closed.\n. Oops I redo a pull request in five minutes with just one commit !\n. Do you know other site than www.fireblade.com matching this pattern ?\n. Ok the header field is not there for all these domains but for a great part.\nFor the png see the wiki : https://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/wiki/Contributing\n. You have to do like for the JSON : you add it in your fork (in share/images/icons), commit the change and then it will be added automatically to your pull request \n. I think it would be better I you add Fireblade.png on the patch-1 branch and on this branch the file contain Fireblade.png...\n. You should close this pull request and then everything will be perfect ! :)\n. Are you using the latest version ? (You can get it at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wappalyzer/ )\nBecause it seems to be as in #518.\n. Oups... sorry I'm using 3.0.10 I thought it had been corrected in a previous version.\n. It looks likes the Wappalyzer logging isn't working but no problem in the firebug console.\nI can't reproduce it with Firefox 28.0, Firebug 1.12.8 and Wappalyzer 3.0.4.\nEDIT : Just updated to Firefox 29.0 and Firebug is working for me.\nIn order to see Wappalyzer logging we need to set in about:config the variable extensions.sdk.console.logLevel to all see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tools/console#Logging%20Levels\n. With a page refresh I can reproduce it on Firefox 29.0, Firebug 1.12.8 and Wappalyzer 3.0.10.\nI think it's a bug in Firefox more than in Wappalyzer as we only use the console typically, it seems the Firefox's console took priority over your when we try to log something.\n. No it does exactly the same, I also tried to remove content.js#L23 and L58 with no results.\n. @janodvarko Can you tell us if the bug occurs even with the new updates ?\nFor me with Firefox 30.0 | Firebug 2.0.1 | Wappalyzer 3.0.11 everything seems ok.\n. Can you share with us some url where the detection fails ?\n. It's \"normal\". The webmaster has removed some traces of Joomla! so the patterns won't match see https://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/blob/master/share/apps.json#L1448\nIf you have an idea feel free to add a pattern. :)\n. With the latest version of W. the detection is working well for me I think the issue can be closed.\n. This issue can be closed.\n. Duplicate of #542. Please search in the issues if your problem was not reported before.\n. No problem ! Thank you for reporting the issue :)\n. I've been thinking about since a long time we could also check with regex if the file is well formated, if \"good practices\" are followed etc. But I wrote several patterns but I don't have time to implement it for now so if someone want to make the validator I can provide the patterns for the formatting and a few for the \"good practices\".\n. I don't experience it only displays me Google Analytics.\nI think it's not a bug, it's a feature ! In fact, as I understand it, the HTML pattern match before and so the script pattern won't match... But oddly it returns the string after the semicolon when it doesn't match...\n. I think it's because you need to put a space after the \":\"  in the ternary... Then you'll have what I describe.\n. If you want to write it without a space you'll need to rewrite the end of the pattern at https://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/blob/master/share/js/wappalyzer.js#L81 from :(.+)$ to :(.*)$.\n. I think you can close this issue.\n. If #629 is merged this pattern will be added back so we could close this issue.\n. I think we can close this issue now.\n. I agree with @q-- the best patterns for me (after reading the sources) are\njs\n\"meta\" : { \"generator\" : \"Ophal ?(.*) \\\\(ophal\\\\.org\\\\)\\\\;version:\\\\1\" },\n\"headers\": { \"X-Powered-By\": \"Ophal ?(.*) \\\\(ophal\\\\.org\\\\)\\\\;version:\\\\1\" }\n. I think you can close this issue.\n. This issue can be closed.\n. I think you can close this issue.\n. Added in #731.\n. @ElbertF The only way I found to make the detection more efficient is to look for a cookie and I didn't find any website powered by CMS Made Simple being not detected.\nBut if the development team knows other ways to detect it I would be happy to hear it.\njs\n\"headers\": { \"Set-Cookie\": \"^CMSSESSID[\\da-f]{8}$\" }\n. I think you can close this issue.\n. You could invert the places of the two patterns and it will match the version number.\nI don't what it will do if you split it in two patterns like this\njs\n\"html\": [ \"\\\\| phpMyAdmin ([\\\\d.]+)<\\\\/title>)\\\\;version:\\\\1\", \"PMA_sendHeaderLocation\\\\(\" ],\n. I think you can close this issue.\n. They also make ads in the page you can detect them with\njs\n\"env\": \"^ac_bgclick_URL$\",\n\"script\": \"adcash\\\\.com/script/\"\n. I found it : http://macleusb.com/ I stumble upon it by chance.\nII usually use BuiltWith too. Otherwise I google things that can lead me to a source code where the app is when I know what I'm looking for. But most of the time I stumble upon a website that seems to be using a technology I don't know and I check what is it and then I check the other website of the same web agency etc.\n. Yes but if one of these variables is present there is also ac_bgclick_URL as I understand it. When it's as it I always try to pick the most \"essential\" variable.\n. We also need to do it for html fields (and maybe for meta fields).\n. You're right it was before 759c925a and so the creation of the apps.json file.\nI think it's also the case for a lot of other tools implying PHP for example.\n. No problem using Chrome Version 37.0.2062.103 m.\nOnly @ElbertF can help but I don't know if he can do this now. It's maybe the ad networks' patterns which have been added lately.\nFor the moment you can try, as a workaround, to load wappalyzer as explained in the wiki.\n. I think you can close this issue.\n. I think you can close this issue.\n. I think there is a little problem : \"4,492 additions, 3,745 deletions not shown\".\n. You are right see https://github.com/wursta/cmsmadesimple/blob/master/include.php#L30.\n. Duplicate of #686, see #686 for a workaround.\n. Hi @napz99  Now the code is okay if you want it to be perfect you can change\njs\n \"Set-Cookie\": \"3dvisit\"\nin\njs\n \"Set-Cookie\": \"3dvisit=\"\nTo avoid any false positive by making sure \"3dvisit\" is not in the content of another cookie.\n. @AliasIO I think you can merge it manually.\n. Since last time I dug a bit more and yes it's a version number so I think the better would be to use the regex I wrote.\n. Perfect ! Thank you for contributing !\n. I looked a bit in the Yii source code and all I found is a bit disappointing..\nphp\npublic static function powered()\n{\n    return 'Powered by <a href=\"http://www.yiiframework.com/\" rel=\"external\">Yii Framework</a>';\n}\n. You have done an awesome work, I'm impressed !\nTo make it perfect I think you could change a few things, I know most of my notes are just details to keep the consistency of the apps.json so take into account only those you find relevant as I am only a contributor among other: \n    - You use things like (\\d[\\d.]+) at lines 144 - 935 - 1355 - 1370 - 2636 :\n it can be justified but if you did not do that on purpose change them to ([\\d.]+) \n    - Wappalyzer is case-insensitive at line 3110 so you don't need a-zA-Z you can write a-z\n    - You use array when not needed (L 309 - 315 - 316 - 531 - 937 - 1378 - 1497 - 1577 - 1810 - 2559 - 3141 - 4158 - 4159)\n    - You use dots for.. dots I know it will work but I thing it's better to escape them for consistency (L 315 - 360 - 2846)\n    - You use non-capturing groups when not needed or you maybe forgot some ? (L 316 - 1377 - 2657 - 3099)\n    - I think what you add as DAV is the apache module mod_dav see http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_dav.html\n    - I don't know if what you've done at L1456 - 2641 works, if it works we should change a lot of .* to what you did\n    - You could change at line 2636 - 2657 (?:-| ) into [- ]\nAfter that just a question : how did you find DECORUM  ? (there is no result when you search it on crwlr.net) I'm asking myself the same question for Happy ICS Server, HTTP-Server, Motion-httpd, RAID HTTPServer, Rapid Logic, .. are these software linked with a specific hardware or another software?\nHappy ICS Server --> OmniTouch 8660 My Teamwork\nMotion-httpd --> http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/\nHTTP-Server pattern is too broad you need to change it to \\bHTTP-Server and then it seems to be linked with Cisco IOS (using crwlr.net).\nAnd as it you don't need anymore the patch at L2647, that won't be efficient with a header like KM_HTTP-Server.\nAs a last note if you can provide 32x32 png it is better see HP.\nAnyway you did a lot of good work !\n. > And I never saw \"mod_dav\". Still, since I wasn't sure if \"DAV\" and \"mod_dav\" are the same thing here, I decided to define \"DAV\" as a separate app. Any (other) opinions?\nI was right see the current mod_dav.c.\n\n\nHappy ICS Server --> OmniTouch 8660 My Teamwork\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nSorry I didn't rewrite all my notes : I mean that using crwlr.net I found that Happy ICS Server is used by Alcatel-Lucent OmniTouch 8660 My Teamwork and it seems to be used only by it.\n\n\nAnd as it you don't need anymore the patch at L2647, that won't be efficient with a header like KM_HTTP-Server.\n\nI'm not sure if I get what you mean? BTW, a hyphen is a word boundary, so e.g. string \"Oracle-HTTP-Server\" still matches \"\\bHTTP-Server\". That's why app Oracle-HTTP-Server excludes app HTTP-Server.\n\nYou're the \\b is not enough.. I was just asking you to write a more accurate pattern in order to avoid all false positive. And as it we won't need anymore the \"excludes\" field that is, in my opinion, to use only when there is no other way.\nWe definitely need to change .* and .+ into \"\" see http://jsperf.com/regex-empty-match-vs-dot-star !\n. I think I can close this issue as most of the work has been done by @AliasIO @DaAwesomeP !\nSure we have yet things to do but we can debate about the idea in a pull request or in an issue.\n(I would love to add a PNG compression to the build process but I can't figure out how to install Docker + Vagrant on Win 7 without Intel VT-x..)\n. I just checked in the BIOS to be sure but no my processor doesn't support VT-x. I hope it won't curb newcommers to contribute.. and it's too bad that it is not completely cross-platform !\nOk fine I will test it when I have time for it!\n. You're right but I don't know any situation where we want to test if the string is non-empty so I simply replaced everything.\n. @q-- +1 I was thinking about it too.\n. One of the pattern to detect Vue.js is too broad I think the better is to delete it\njs\n\"script\": \"vue.*\\\\.js\"\nsee apps.json#L3907.\n. @andriy-f  I have a 20% confidence on facebook, which seems right : can you check if you have the same ?. Then it is not a bug for me.\nMaybe we should give priority for the main icon to 100% sure detections. What do you think ?. koken.me is not powered by Koken but blog.koken.me is, I do a pull request to detect it.\n. Can't reproduce with Firefox 35.0.1 (and previous versions), Wappalyzer 3.0.14 and Windows 7.\nI never experienced this.\nTry to use a new profile.\nCan you share with us the other addons you are using ?\n. In my opinion it would enable us to detect some(edit) more framework and version of them but how about performance ? How should we implement it to detect more things but without sacrifying efficientness ? \nWhy do you want to check fonts files content ?\n. @ElbertF @DaAwesomeP You can validate a field of the JSON with a regular expression with JSON schema, I think the better it to keep the greatest part of the validation in the JSON schema, if we can not do it all in (edit: for JSON's validation I mean). (See https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-03#section-5.16)\n. The HTML pattern is too broad I think.\nYou can find a 32x32 icon at http://community.lithium.com/html/assets/stars-icon-li.jpg.\n. You can also look for these cookies\n\nLithiumVisitor\nLiSESSIONID\nLithiumVisitor\n\nand this DOM variable LITHIUM.\n. @atcazzual : It seems good to me ! If you want to do another pull request without combining it with this one you can use a branch see Git Branching.\nI think @AliasIO will merge it in a few days.\n. For me with Chrome Version 40.0.2214.115m and Wappalyzer 2.36 GA is not detected.. you should try with a fresh install it's maybe a cache bug.\n. I think you can also search for the env var : sl_indexroot (if it's not only for sunlight.shira.cz)\n. Could you provide some example websites using hapi.js ? I think there are some more way to detect it. :)\n. @briandela I took a look a https://github.com/hapijs/hapi to check the source code but I didn't find any obvious pattern. I think you're right : the only way to detect hapi.js is to search for popular plugins.. so good job !\n. Can't reproduce :  Win 7, Chrome 41.0.2272.101 m, Wappalyzer 2.37.\n. +1 I noticed it sometimes too but I didn't figured out when it occurs and why..\n. Thank you for contributing !\nThere is a bracket in more at the end of the script pattern, else everything is perfect.\n. Firefox 40.0.2, Win 7, Wappalyzer 3.0.16 : everything is working as usual.\n. I think it's a firefox problem as nothing has changed for the addons in the release note. Try to update to 40.0.2 (could be linked to mozalloc.lib was missing from the xulrunner package (1168291) ?). I can not help you more.\n. +1: I think it's better to use this file than the wiki because the documentation is a part of the project and we can track the changes in the documentation relatively to the changes in the code. (And it's GitHub independent)\n. @AliasIO : I didn't know that.\n@rugk : You are right but you can not do a single commit to push changes to the code and documentation and so track the changes in the documentation relatively to the changes in the code.\n. +1 for the validation idea but wouldn't this make skyrocket the weight of the extension ?\nCould we put these tests in another specific file ? Or do you think it's better to keep everything in the same place and as it make it easier to understand and improve patterns (and why not trim it during the build) ?\n. > We could also strip out the tests in the build script.\nIf we do that I have no further comments.\nIt will be another step forward no enable anyone to contribute with an almost complete knowledge on how work the pattern and Wappalyzer.\n. Well done! Don't you think that we should keep a default dehaviour ? (i.e. no field icon when the icon name is appName.png)\n. @DaAwesomeP Sorry I did not see the comments on issue #1004, then it's perfect!\n. +1 I think we need to add a feature to report a potential false positive (and why not another to say an app is used).\nThe better would be to publish these information and delete them when it is corrected or proven wrong. (but it will require some efforts).\n. It's a good thing that you updated the patterns but I don't understand why did you remove the former patterns ? (They both match on http://demo.thelia.net/.)\n. Ok , I didn't know that but it's same for any pattern: if someone wants to hide all the tools powering a website from Wappalyzer he can.\nIn my opinion the better would be to keep all the patterns: it costs us almost nothing and it would improve the detection rate.\n. You're right. I read too fast, my mistake.\n. Can't reproduce : Chrome 47, Wappalyzer 2.44 (Win 10)\nIn my opinion the script on config1.veinteractive.com should be broken, I think it's something like this.\nWhy do you think it's related to Wappalyzer ?\n. I can't reproduce on Kiwoko nor.\n\nwhen i keep trying to force iframes to load\n\nI don't understand this part.\nOn Kiwoko it's the same error: mixed content. To be sure Wappalyzer is the culprit you could try to disable it next time it occurs and see what happens.\n\ni believe it's caused by Wappalyzer as clicking to expand the error it brings me to chrome-extension://gppongmhjkpfnbhagpmjfkannfbllamg/js/iframe.js which relates to the extension key of Wappalyzer\n\nI don't know this part of the code, @AliasIO could know what is happening.\n. > www.kiwoko.com/?testwapp\nYou're right after a few times I managed to reproduce it. And without W. nothing after ten trials.\n. In my opinion it's not a false positive: they are using Google PageSpeed.\nIt's more a version detection bug and the problem occurs only when the version field has been changed by the user. (coindugeek's web server is also \"powered by mana\"..)\nTo avoid such a version we could change it to\njs\n\"X-Page-Speed\": \"([\\\\d.]+-\\\\d+)?\\\\;version:\\\\1\"\n. Why did you call it Backbone.Marionette.js and not Marionette.js?\n. Apache.svg: I would say why not a full and beautiful logo however how would you display it in the URL bar ?\n. @DaAwesomeP Yes that was the question I was raising : How do we manage the scaling to keep it \"clean\" and visible ?\nHow about the size of apache.svg also ? (93.1 kb) Could we compress it or the Apache license is forbidding it ?\nFor the remainder well done, you did a great job!\n. @DaAwesomeP Then it's perfect!\nIn my opinion, by keeping it light we enable Wappalyzer to grow over and over and when Wappalyzer is used as a dependancy it's also important to keep it convenient.\nPS: a slow connection is not that uncommon ;)\n. I think afterbuy.ico and strato.ico should be deleted.\n. @q-- @AliasIO  I think you can now close this issue.. nginx/1.9.9 is already detected.\nSee https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/wiki/Specification#patterns.\n. The \"not\" (?!...)  is not implemented in W. as far as I remember.\nHowever you can use  env field see https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/wiki/Specification#json-fields.\nSo it would look like\njs\n\"env\": \"^freeProductTranslation$\"\n. If I'm right it's not the first time you try to change AnchorCache's detection: How can I help you ?\n. It's not a bug of Wappalyzer, you shoukd submit it to Mozilla.\nIt occurs with GIMP and Adobe Acrobat Reader too.\n. @Sirikon  @AliasIO  I think you can now close this issue.. @Revod if you send a pull request with your changes to port Wappalyzer to Edge I think @AliasIO would be delighted to merge it!\n. @AliasIO  Maybe you could close it as won't fix ?\nThere are only 80 extensions available for Edge, Microsoft doesn't seem to make a lot of effort to enable extensions to be in their store cf  https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/collections/edgeextensions/pc. @peyvand I'm not sure I understood what do you have in mind making this pull request.\n\"Peyvand CMS\" is not a CMS, is it ?\nIn my opinion you can not use Wappalyzer to advertise your business but @AliasIO is the only one to make decisions here.\n. The problem was reported a lot of times..\nIt is not a bug of Wappalyzer, I am not even sure it is a bug of the browser: I got the same strange behavior with GIMP for example.\nThis bug report seems to describe the same problem : https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=61000\nhttps://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=324949 is a bit similar\n. ```shell\nValidating apps.json...\nValidation Errors:\nInstance is not a required type\nuri: urn:uuid:633d6b5f-1dd8-4eb0-824d-630f23818429#/apps/Kamva/meta/generator\nschemaUri: urn:uuid:6e98092c-8228-420a-bf5a-e095892ae426#/properties/apps/additionalProperties/properties/meta/additionalProperties\nattribute: type\ndetails: [\"string\"]\nnpm ERR!

The current version of Wappalyzer for Firefox is 3.2.11.\nCould you please update the addon and tell us if everything is working then ?. Hi @ruchern,\nI am not aware of any work in this direction.\nDo you want to try to do it ?\nThere seems to be some doc here : https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Tools/Conceptual/SafariExtensionGuide/ConvertingToSafari/ConvertingToSafari.html. @AliasIO couldn't we implement the zero confidence trick ? As it @AlexByte could keep its X-CMS-Version header pattern.. See https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/wiki/Specification#patterns the regexps should be treated as case-insensitive.\nHowever if I read https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/wappalyzer.js#L278 I can't find where the regexps are made insensitive. Any hint @AliasIO ?. I was speaking about the patterns of detection.\nMy bad : the expressions are made case-insensitive at https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/wappalyzer.js#L177 during the parsing.. As for Virtuoso \"I'm only a contributor so I can't remove anything.\". I think these groups do nothing... #1911 was merged so I think we can close this one.. It's not a Wappalyzer bug see #1276. Your request seems to be out of scope, see #324.\nImho the detection of themes or plugins of a specific CMS, framework, .. should be done in a separate addon or as an addon of W. see https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firefinder-for-firebug/ for Firebug.. It is not implemented yet! I don't really know how it works with Firebug.\nWe could imagine something injecting code to add a specific apps.json and the related icons.\nI'm only a contributor, only @AliasIO could answer you if he want this type of feature to be added.. Could you please give information on how to reproduce your bug ?\nWhich browser are you using with which version of Wappalyzer ?\nAs a user of Wappalyzer 3.2.11 on Firefox 52.0.2 I don't have this sort of behavior.. Stop being paranoid. \nThis practice is also being used by Firebug, to quote a famous example, and for the same purpose : only giving information to users. Moreover I don't see how you could use it with this updating frequency..\n. Why do you want to change that ? Do you have some examples of what you want to detect ?. Duplicate of #1510.. Moreover it's not cautious to use the greedy . that could, maybe, be replaced with a [^\"].\n@stefanneculai  what do you think about using \"html\": \"class=\\\"[^\\\"]*(?:fr-view|fr-box)\" instead ?. If you open the pull request in github you will see I commented under the URL pattern ;)\nI'm only a contributor so I can't remove anything and take my comments for what they are : advises.\nIMO you don't need this pattern as it will trigger more false positive than good detections and you already found reliables ways to detect Virtuoso.. I think the better is to implement this workaround for Facebook : https://stackoverflow.com/a/25224109/1906722\nAnd then we should close it as it is a Chrome & Firefox bug. (see  https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=233903 & https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=866522)\nIf you want to dig into this issue I recommend these links : \n    https://github.com/blog/1477-content-security-policy\n    https://www.bountysource.com/issues/3561287-bookmarklet-and-csp\n    https://niutech.github.io/topnewsfeed/\n    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7607605/does-content-security-policy-block-bookmarklets/25224109#25224109. @jvoisin then we should just close this issue.\nChrome : https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=233903\nFirefox : https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=866522\nEdge : https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/11320212/. See line 904 of the TravisCI log :\nError: Missing file for app \"Shapecss\": src/icons/Shapecss.svg\nYou need to add an icon see Adding a new application. My bad, I didn't see the other pull request. These 2 pull together are making a whole that is okay for TravisCI, however the classic process is to submit both in the same request.\n1565 shouldn't have passed the tests imo, what do you think @AliasIO ? Shouldn't we check that each icon is used at least one time ?. @TechieForFun I don't understand what is your point of view : could you elaborate a bit more ?\nDid you encounter a real case where you have an URL like this google.com/?option=com_users ?\nIf not if I'm right you are making the hypothesis that someone could craft the URL to make a false positive, which is true, but how could we prevent Wappalyzer from it ?. Hi @TechieForFun,\nLook at apps.json and tell me for which pattern you couldn't  say that ?\nWappalyzer relies on the postulate that the dev is not lying to you and that we can find patterns that are unique (or almost) for a given technology.\nWhen we know that two technologies might be in conflict we try to write better patterns and we use the exclude field in case of utmost necessity.\nI'm afraid that with a passive analyzer there is nothing more to do than writing patterns with care.. To match shapecss.min.b395c90eed714ca101921.js you need to write something like shapecss\\.min\\.[a-f\\d]+\\.js or shapecss\\.(?:min\\.)?(?:[a-f\\d]+\\.)?js. You need to add an icon for each technology see Adding a new app in the wiki.\n@AliasIO the build should have failed or I'm wrong ?. I think using the same icon is a good option as SPARQL always come with RDF.\nShouldn't SPARQL imply RDF ?. @AliasIO Sorry I misssed this change. Shouldn't it raise a warning so the build won't fail but newcomers would be aware that they could use an icon ?. Can't reproduce with Win 10, Firefox 53.0.3, Wappalyzer 3.2.11 : HTTP/2 is detected.\nWhat are your OS, browser and Wappalyzer version ?. This false positive is triggered by the col-xs-12 class in the page with this pattern https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer#L8209 . At line 9 of popup.js  there is a typo : interactive is written interacrive. It was introduced on the 24th of April by 70ecdf0899d7e4b02c866dbd1a31847f4acf96a.\nI don't know if this can be the source of the problem but this need to be fixed.\nHow could we bypass add-on signing that is preventing tests ? (see https://wiki.mozilla.org/Add-ons/Extension_Signing)\n\nHowever, the fact that only one icon appears in the URL bar is not a bug; that is a limitation of WebExtensions.\n\nThere is no work-around ? Because if not Wappalyzer will lost a lot of its value for a good part of its users, including me.. @DaAwesomeP Maybe we can trick the API by adding just one long image ? I read the API's documentation and I can't find what would be the behaviour of the browser: we need to test it but I can't find how to load an extension with this new extension signing protection... Duplicate of #1601.. I just pushed a little pattern in #1911, the idea was also from #1434, which is still opened by the way.\n\nYet it is so easy to detect the version of Angular.\n\nThen we will be happy if you can help us to detect the version in other situations like this one http://www.rb2000.ps/ and everyone will welcome cheerfully your pull request.. Can't reproduce on my setup.\nWhat is your OS, browser (with version) and Wappalyzer version ?. Your usage of Wappalyzer seems very specific, as a user of the extension I don't see added value knowing that this website is a managed version of Wordpress. IMHO the best would be that you use a custom rule. Should we give a simpler way than editing apps.json in such a case ?. FYI patterns are case insensitive (see https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/wiki/Specification#patterns), so you can simplify a bit the generator pattern for example.. I think the question of rinodung was more about why is there a difference in detection between the browser addon and the NodeJS version.. Could give your OS, browser with version and Wappalyzer version ? It is working for me on Firefox 54.0.1 (Win 64) with Wappalyzer version 4.1.5.. Could you provide more information ?\nI'm using Firefox 54.0.1 (Win 64 bits) and Wappalyzer 4.1.5 and everything seems to be working.. Strange.. could you try to disable all the others addons you have and restart Firefox ?. If it is possible to detect a version with a pattern we do this. You can check we use other field like here https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/apps.json#L519\nIf your question is how to detect a version number without using patterns this sort of question is out of the scope of Wappalyzer : it's a passive analyzer.. If you are pointing at jvoisin or me for example: FYI we are just contributors just exactly as you.\nIn my case I can not really say that I can speak or even verify an Ukrainian translation so I will not review your PR. And for the maintainer I think it is a lot harder to review a translation that he may not be able to speak than a small piece of code. When I can help AND when I have some time to give to Wappalyzer I will review a PR or answer to an issue.\nMoreover, I think that 2 days is not that much for an open-source project like Wappalyzer.\nPlease remain polite with all the contributors and even with the maintainer.. First, I think you could add a pattern to detect the CDN version of Chart.js with version detection. (see https://cdnjs.com/libraries/Chart.js)\nThen you could find some CSS selectors related to Chart.js, if there are some, or maybe some other global variables specific to Chart.js but I didn't find something obvious.. Currently, the only way would be to extract it from the name of the global variable.. I understand what you mean, see #1226 and #277.\nWe could detect a lot more information with something like that : however is that possible ? What will be the drawbacks of this, especially regarding performance ? If you want to discuss about that you are free to open an issue.. Why do you remove the old pattern ? We could keep both :). Can't reproduce too.. See #1702. Travis was broken see #1722 maybe you could try again after a rebase. Your pull request with the SVG file seems good to me.. I would try to rebase before making any other assumption.. @alvarogzp I can't reproduce it. What is your OS and arch ?\n(Firefox 57, Win 10, x64, Wappalyzer 5.1.6). The problem here is a bit more complex.\nWhat is causing this false positive is that Backbone.js is a tag of the question. (and the same explanation apply if the referral page URL contains backbone.js)\nSo then you have DoubleClick and Adzerk scripts that are loading some other scripts on page load according to the tag of the question.\nWhich looks like that:\njs\n<script src=\"https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?gdfp_req=1&amp;correlator=3451486646948005&amp;output=json_html&amp;callback=googletag.impl.pubads.callbackProxy1&amp;impl=fifs&amp;json_a=1&amp;eid=108809107%2C21060692&amp;sc=1&amp;sfv=1-0-10&amp;iu_parts=248424177%2Cstackoverflow.com%2Clb%2Cquestion-pages%2Csb&amp;enc_prev_ius=%2F0%2F1%2F2%2F3%2C%2F0%2F1%2F4%2F3&amp;prev_iu_szs=728x90%2C300x250%7C300x600&amp;cust_params=Registered%3Dtrue%26so-tag%3Djavascript%252Cpython%252Cdjango%252Cbackbone.js%26X-Site%3Dserverfault.com%252Cstats.stackexchange.com%252Cunix.stackexchange.com%252Csoftwareengineering.stackexchange.com%252Candroid.stackexchange.com&amp;cookie=ID%3D8c32419c8142c888%3AT%3D1502208015%3AS%3DALNI_Mb_swgIhecg1JMew7SlXe2GMIUNsg&amp;abxe=1&amp;lmt=1505235120&amp;dt=1505235120506&amp;frm=20&amp;biw=1519&amp;bih=460&amp;oid=3&amp;adxs=0%2C990&amp;adys=0%2C151&amp;adks=58773763%2C228937067&amp;gut=v2&amp;ifi=1&amp;u_tz=120&amp;u_his=1&amp;u_h=864&amp;u_w=1536&amp;u_ah=824&amp;u_aw=1536&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_sd=1.25&amp;flash=0&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstackoverflow.com%2Fquestions%2F46157943%2Fcsrf-verification-failed-django-rest-and-backbone-js&amp;dssz=31&amp;icsg=34&amp;std=14&amp;vrg=147&amp;vis=1&amp;ga_vid=380229078.1501462052&amp;ga_sid=1505235121&amp;ga_hid=1934611349\">\n</script>\nand\njs\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" async=\"\" src=\"https://engine.adzerk.net/ados?t=1505235119790&amp;request={&quot;Placements&quot;:[{&quot;A&quot;:22,&quot;S&quot;:8277,&quot;D&quot;:&quot;adzerk2138886854&quot;,&quot;AT&quot;:4,&quot;Z&quot;:[43]},{&quot;A&quot;:22,&quot;S&quot;:8277,&quot;D&quot;:&quot;adzerk691563963&quot;,&quot;ATA&quot;:[5,17,2221,1129,43],&quot;Z&quot;:[45]}],&quot;Keywords&quot;:&quot;javascript%2Cpython%2Cdjango%2Cbackbone.js%2Cx-user-registered%2Cx-cross-site-serverfault.com%2Cx-cross-site-stats.stackexchange.com%2Cx-cross-site-unix.stackexchange.com%2Cx-cross-site-softwareengineering.stackexchange.com%2Cx-cross-site-android.stackexchange.com&quot;,&quot;Referrer&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;IsAsync&quot;:true}\">\n</script>\nSo the src part of the script tag is containing Backbone.js (or to be more accurate something like this: backbone.*\\\\.js) which is causing the wrong detection.\nSo thank you for the bug report we need to make the regex more specific by : \n- adding something like a blackslash before backbone and the same apply for a lot of other library with too simple patterns\n- be more specific with the part .*\nPs: using .* or .+ is a very bad practice and we should use them only in very specific situations and I see we have 100 usages of them. You're right : I was just suggesting that we solve both problems in one commit, plus I don't know if we couldn't trigger an even more complex situation were this part would be faulty. (I mean with DoubleClick and Adzerk). My bad, I wrote the end of my post a bit too fast I meant a slash / but we would rather need something like (?:^|/). Hello,\nI think you tried to push something directly to the repository of AliasIO but you don't have the permission to do so.\nSo you need to push to your own repository on github and then do a pull request which will be accepted, or not, by the owner of the repository (see https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). I think it is now clear that your are not trying to use Wappalyzer only to promote your company.\nIn my opinion it is hard  to tell, in the current situation, if your pull request should be merged : see #1742.\nTo start to answer this question I think we could ask ourselves :\n- How many technologies are used by 2000 websites or more ?\nTo have a magnitude we could check the number of stars and say one star is 10 users in Github project : 53 535 projects have more than 200 stars)\nFor sure, all these projects are not intended to be used at any point in the conception of a webpage and I took this ratio arbitrarily - for example for Wappalyzer is more something 200 daily users per star (however it is not the same sort of project).\n\nHow many technologies could we add to Wappalyzer before it explodes ?\n\nPs: For your information, only AliasIO can reject or merge a pull request.. It is not a bad thing to promote its company :) what I meant is that your pull request is a minima not only good for your own company and so that we have to consider it. I understand your point of view and I personally find that it is a good way to think and that your intentions are good.\nTo be clear I am neither for or against the inclusion of Simpl\u00e9bo : I think the more app we can detect the better but we need to keep the project sustainable.\nApart from the inclusion of Simpl\u00e9bo I think it would be a good thing if we could solve this question once and for all, backed with data, so everyone could understand what is the rule and why. If we do not do that we will have this sort of debate again and again and the decision will be arbitrary, as it is today.\n. Do not forget to add the png file (or even the svg file) to your pull request :). I do agree with the spirit of what you write.\nHowever did you read that part ?\n\nWhy do Wappalyzer could want to reject some applications ?\n- Wappalyzer is intended to make discover technologies used in the real world and not to help someone to promote its web agency (this has been tried by some in the past)\n- Wappalyzer should keep a maintainable list and a list we could use regarding performance in the browser for example (What are the real limits today ?)\n\nFor the first point I see that you agree with me (you said there could be some \"scammy\" submission) and we need to be able to check that at least, and so set standard to make it easier.\nFor the second point: today Wappalyzer seems easy to use and stable but it has not always been the case in the past. We had performance issues in the past for example. It would be wonderful to detect any technology behind a webpage but if we have 100 000 detectable technologies with 3 regexes each it means we will execute 300 000 search at each page load. Can we afford that ? I don't think so. (We have currently 980 apps and something like 2200-2400 regexes)\nEven if we could execute all these regexes and maintain the file where they are : do we really want to detect a technology which is used by 10 people all in the same company/group of friends/... ? I don't think there is an added value here.\nThat is why I think we need to set some standard, if possible backed up with data, because we need to stay realistic on one side and keep welcoming the contributions on the other.. The main limitations I see avoiding us to add an infinite number of technologies are : \n\n\nthe size of the extension because of the icons\nCurrently with all the good practices in place they are taking only 1.2Mo in the extension so it is not a problem before having 10 or 20 times more applications.\n\n\nthe time to process all the patterns\nI do not have data about it but someone could do some tests so we can put some figures on it\n\n\nAnother problem could be the ability to check the consistency of the patterns to keep a good quality, however some checks are already automated : maybe we could push it further if the number of detected app would have to explode.. - @abdelbk\nI really do not think icons are our first problem but if you want to go in that path you have to talk with @AliasIO, moreover I find it better to deploy something that is working on its own.\n\n@AliasIO, @q--, @DaAwesomeP, @jvoisin, @craiglondon \nDo you think a debate is needed on that point and do you want to take part in it ?. I agree with @jvoisin it would be a good thing to have both the minimum requirement for an addition and the threshold to remove an app written in a safe place.\nCould we have a specific webpage listing the technologies to be removed ?\nAs it we would enable us to know at a glance what technologies should be removed and on which we could work to find better patterns.. @AlexByte why would we want to keep an app we are not able to detect ? As I said in my previous comment this list could help us to find inefficient patterns and so to improve them.. @AliasIO This issue is open since two weeks and nothing moved since 9 days so I think we can say the problem is solved. So do you think you could write the decision down in the wiki and then I could close this issue ?. Can you give us an example page to check what is possible to do ?\nHowever I do not have much hope it is packed and with a generic name.. I also agree : what you describe should be a problem with the cache maybe, not detection directly.\nHowever we need to remove the ef pattern.. Can you confirm this file is Simplified Chinese ? If it is the case could you help us translate in Traditional Chinese by translating this file ?. Yes if you can do that it would be perfect and we will be glad to have one more translation for Wappalyzer!. However we could try to detect to detect the cookies see https://stackoverflow.com/a/21939101/1906722. Ok so if the patterns seem good to you maybe you could do a pull request.\nYou have a little \"contributing\" guide here to help you.\nFor the crayola website the only thing I could find is\nhtml\n<div class=\"hide\" id=\"sitecore_popup-location\">\n````\nit looks like the website is ran by Demandware (partly at least).. Can you show us live websites using it ? How many users do you have ?. I agree with @q--  If it is possible it could be good to make a test page like https://wappalyzer.com/test where there is nothing to detect and report on each install/update if there is something strange.. Email is good for me but we could maybe create a slack project for this sort of situation.. Solved by 9eaf963 (see #1785).. I think so but you have to write it like this as the version tag is processed separately (i.e. it is not a part of the regex)js\n\"Server\": \"Cherokee(?:/([\\d.]+))?\\;version:\\1\"\n. Can you give us some URLs so we could look into this ?. You also add installed (according to the report on forums.malwarebytes.com)  : \nMetaMask / No Coin - Block miners on the web! / Unpaywall / Bypass Paywalls / Windscribe VPN\nDid you installed \"No Coin - Block miners on the web!\" after the problem occured ?\n. I installed the extension to test it : for the moment I could not reproduce it. What version do you have @961Group ?. Thank you I needed to update the lists to reproduce it.\nI think it is a false positive : Adblocker Ultimate is initialising the Coinhive variable because of this rule (raw text extracted from a JSON file of rules filterrules_2.txt)\n\"#%#(function(){var c=navigator.language,d=\\\"AdGuard has detected that this website is trying to use your browser as a blockchain currency miner.

It is a false positive but because of a strange, if not buggy, behavior of Adblocker Ultimate : we will reach them to know how to solve this.\n\nEdit : The extension is initializing a CoinHive variable in order to block it, even if there is nothing bad running - this should be possible to avoid.. @ameshkov  Thank for your good work and to take into account Wappalyzer!\nWhat was disturbing me was that you were initializing a variable outside of the scope of your addon, which is not a good practice in my opinion. I was pointing the side effect of the way it was done previously not the method :)\n@961Group  I think you can now close the issue.\nHere is the commit of @ameshkov to fix this issue : https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/commit/d0cfa496f7f5a847bac6aaf939d4167bda9c0bba. @AlexByte I know and I am sorry, I forgot to branch.... The best could be to call them minero.cc and minero.pw.. Minero.pw is a clone of CoinHive in the end so we do not need to care about it.\nThank you @kkadosh  for adding all these cryptominers!\nSo just cloudcoins and we are done! But maybe with the current hype there are new ones.... 100% implemented thanks to @kkadosh !. Google Analytics & Google Tag Manager are both detected for me with Firefox and the last version of Wappalyzer.\nWhat is your setup ?. +1\nCan you also add Crypto-Loot & ProjectPoi to the category ?. I looked into the a few days ago : it is a bit complicated to understand exactly how it works and it seems to be active detection and we can only use passive detection currently see https://www.wappalyzer.com/docs/specification.. @TheShrike, @kirainmoe & @mxschmitt since a few weeks we can detect JS objects at any depth : does this help ?. @mxschmitt I meant using the same think you used in #2147 could worth a try. If it is fruitless I think you can close the issue as I do not see any other way to dive in.. @DanielRuf The main problem is to find something that is identifying the library in the result produced by put any type of process name here which is alterring the information we try to detect. If you have any track we would really be happy to hear about that :)\nOtherwise, I think we should close this issue as all the concerns written here can be for any application we would want to detect and that we already investigated ways to improve them. Maybe an expert in packing/minifying could help us in the future... Thank you for the Foundation pattern! (I do not know if it is independent but a pull request has been opened by @jvoisin in #2192)\nThe one for jQuery is already here.\nFor the bootstrap version we have two patterns looking very similar : \njs\n//New patterns\nbootstrap.Tooltip.VERSION\n$.fn.tooltip.Constructor.VERSION\nand \njs\n//Current patterns\nbootstrap.Alert.VERSION\njQuery.fn.tooltip.Constructor.VERSION\nI do not know very well jQuery and Bootstrap but my feeling is that we need to add the one with the dollar but not the other as I think it is redundant with the current pattern.\nWhat do you think @DanielRuf ?. Hi,\nDid you try to disable Wappalyzer to check if it was the culprit ? Because the extension id hdokiejnpimakedhajhdlcegeplioahd is the one of LastPass.. What do you mean ?. Thank you for the explanation. I do not know if we can say using an ICO is a good practice.. but you are right SVG are not supported by Chrome but Safari & Firefox support it : https://caniuse.com/#feat=link-icon-svg\nMaybe we will be able to use SVG favicon in \"a couple of quarters\" ;) https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=294179#c43. @func0der As a contributor, I can not see why the bookmarklet would not be the perfect fit for this use case : I am not against this feature but I do not understand why someone would need it.\nBy the way I do not understand what you mean by\n\nI find it very handy to have an addon installed, because it is easier obtained than a bookmarklet.. @func0der I asked some precision about your use case, you did not answered and 2 months after that AliasIO closed the issue. I think he gave you a fair time to express your thoughts but I would be more than pleased if you answer now :) . I am sorry I did not understand that you were trying to match a property of an object. It is a normal behavior in fact see the docs. \nGlobal JavaScript variables.\nMembers of the window object only; \"^jQuery.fn$\" won't work. Avoid short patterns to prevent matching minified code.\n\nHowever maybe you could replace it with sap-ui-(?!config|debug|optimized) ?. I think you did not have the time to read my comment :)\nBy the way if you change the pattern maybe you could add version detection with this pattern, what do you think ?\njson\n\"script\": \"^https://openui5\\\\.hana\\\\.ondemand\\\\.com/([\\\\d.]+)?/?resources/sap-ui-core.js$\\\\;version:\\\\1\"\". Also I just checked something : you didn't add a script pattern for all the websites so I think can also make the part before \"resources/\" (and including it) optional.. @AlexByte Are you sure we need to consider them as different ? Because in https://angularjs.org/ we can read :\n\nThis site and all of its contents are referring to AngularJS (version 1.x), if you are looking for the latest Angular, please visit angular.io.. @AlexByte fixed in 27d4552.. So the html pattern should point to Angular and the other patterns to AngularJS ?. Why did you ignore -beta case then ? It could be cool to have in the detection version don't you think ? :). Ok I see, I thought it was not that random! So good job \ud83d\udc4d . > There is content.js, which should be all you need. You can message it with tabs.sendMessage().\n\nThank you I will do it that way.\n\nI think I'd like it better if the pattern wasn't the key in the object\n\nThen why do we do like this for meta and headers fields. Should we change them all ?. I think we need to keep it as general as possible, and so make no assumption on what we want to match or that it will be a version code / number.. > Do we want to permit regexps that don't have any matching group by the way? I don't think we should.\nWhy would be avoid this ? Sometimes knowing a variable is initialized, even if it is not with a text content, can be useful.. I just finished to implement a first working version of the detection by the js field.\nYou can test it with jQuery and this pattern on StackOverflow for example\njs\n\"js\" : {\n    \"jQuery.fn.jquery\": \"(.*)\\\\;version:\\\\1\"\n}\nYou will maybe find this a bit dirty but it is not that easy to pass things from content script to the page context. However I am more than open to better ideas!. I continue to review all the new js patterns.\nI removed Jo & Koego as they doesn't exists anymore.\nI don't know what to think about Gravity Insights  & LinkSmart.. Can not reproduce with Firefox 57.0.2, Wappalyzer 5.2.1 (Win 64bit) : I only have HTTP/2 & Google Web Server. Could you explain a bit more into details how to reproduce it ?\n. I think we can close this one as we do not have enough information and that it seems to be more an interface glitch than something wrong in Wappalyzer.. It is because the comment we want to detect if before the html tag.\nWhat we do to get HTML is not picking comments outside of this tag.\njs\nvar html = document.documentElement.outerHTML;\n(cf https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/drivers/webextension/js/content.js#L4)\nThis reminds me about #237, #360 & #615.. Then what should be the cap ? 1 MB ? It would be better if we had data on the average page size but I could not find this.. The current limit seems to be 50kb. I was only guessing if the 50kb thing was a good choice to optimise the detection according to the Pareto principle, or if another bound would be better. But as I have no data neither on performance nor on html page size I can only guess.... I have the same issue and also sometimes icons won't show up. But I think the problem is on Mozilla part...\n\n. These issues are described in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1420865, https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1418677 & https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1380622\nI suggest that those who want this issue to be solved upvote these 3 bugs in bugzilla.. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Debugging#Debugging_popups ;). I am very happy to announce this issue will be solved in Firefox 62 cf bug 1420865, if you want you can double check with the Nightly build that everything is right.\nPS: In the end bug 1380622 does not seem to be linked with this issue, for the last one time will tell. Are you a web agency or do you maintain a CMS?. Nice one!\nWe need to put \u2122 and not \\\u2122 to make it work, could you do a pull request to fix it ?\nYou can run this code in the console (Ctrl + Shift + K) on the example site to convince you it is the solution\njs\nvar html = document.documentElement.outerHTML;\nvar regTrade = new RegExp(\"Forum software by XenForo&trade;\");\nvar regTM = new RegExp(\"Forum software by XenForo\u2122\")\nconsole.log(\"Trade: \" + regTrade.test(html));\nconsole.log(\"TM: \" + regTM.test(html));. The detection of OpenGSE is implying the use of Java. See https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/apps.json#L6534 and https://www.wappalyzer.com/docs/specification.. You can add detection via js with this pattern:\njs\n\"js\" : {\n  \"Inwemo\": \"\",\n  \"_0x69dd\": \"\"\n}\nA simple sample to find is their own website ;). @jvoisin I can not be sure.. but it is looks like static in https://cdn.inwemo.com/inwemo.min.js . @jvoisin  But this sample of Coin-Have has _0x0e55 https://coin-have.com/c/J5jd.js.. What do you think about scanning LocalStorage ? This one is storing something in a LocalStorage space called webmine.. It seems that on http://demo.keystonejs.com/keystone/signin there is a js variable keystone maybe we can find it in other setup on other pages.. Can't reproduce with Wappalyzer 5.4.4 and Firefox 57.0.4\nHowever sometimes it crashes randomly after and takes something like 10% of my CPU.\nMaybe @jvoisin or @AliasIO do you have any idea to debug this sort of problem ?. @phoenix-schwarz I do not know if these two issues were linked but what you describe was fixed by #2143.\n@koencg  Do you still experience this issue with the current version ?. Can you tell us a bit more on how to reproduce this ? Does it happen on regular web pages ?. You should not remove it : it is here to provide version detection when we already know that the technology is here.. I think you can also add this pattern:\njson\n\"html\": \"<!--[^>]+Cooked by ShopFA v([\\\\d.]+)\\\\;version:\\\\1\"\nAre you sure the js pattern is working ? I could not find a website where it would match.. Yes it looks perfect :)\nPs: You could be a bit more accurate by changing (.+) into ([\\\\d.]+), it is maybe a punctilious precision however.. Last version of Wappalyzer in Firefox I have WordPress with the correct version.. No problem with wappalyzer, you should use the extension https://www.wappalyzer.com/download\nI think the website is blocking the request cf\n```batch\ncurl http://larrr.com/\nError 406 - Not AcceptableError 406 - Not AcceptableGenerally a 406 error is caused because a request has been blocked by Mod Security. If you believe that your request has been blocked by mistake please contact the web site owner.\n. However you are right it would be cool to display the HTTP return code to understand what is going on or some error message.. The CI is not happy because you need to add the icon and the patterns at the same time.. Can you provide the exact web page where the detection could be wrong ? I could not spot neither IIS nor PHP.. Can you provide an example website to check if everything is right ? :). If it can be self hosted I think we should include version detection : the more information the better!. Your pattern is good, you can add it!\nBut you found a bug: the feature is quite recent and it looks like we do not manage numbers properly. Thank you! . Could you provide us more context ? To me it looks like there is no problem on Wappalyzer side.. @joanna-szuba Do you still have this problem ? If yes can you provide us more information ?. I think this issue can be closed.. You can find the pattern here : https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/apps.json\nFor Shopify it is here to be accurate https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/apps.json#L8472. I you should keep AngularJS as it : #1995 \nIt was a previous error to remove AngularJS.. I removed it a few weeks ago because I thought in 64x64 we will not notice the difference but I was wrong apparently.. @dqsully, @nghitran can you still reproduce this bug with Wappalyzer 5.4.11 ?\nI pushed a fix for a lookalike issue which was merged in 27e1fa1.\nIf it did not fix I need a *reproducible* way to debug it : so at least a complete URL and maybe some preconditions.. This part of the [html pattern](https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/apps.json#L4732) is the culpritregex\n<[^>]+(?:feed|components)/com_\n```\nSo whenever there is a link to a website using Joomla, Joomla will be detected.\nHere it is the last link of Google last result with the request \"download burning board 5\".\nI do not really know what we need to do as the confidence is already 50%.\nShould we keep it like this, remove it or do we have a way to improve it ?. I can confirm on windows that something strange is going on with Wappalyzer. One core is monopolized for several seconds.\nOne call to analyzeHtml is going crazy.\nMaybe this commit fixes it 28a93d5.. Can you give us an example URL to test against it ?. @amriunix, @ssaarinen, @dmangin, @SkySymbol, @Conorbro can you still reproduce this bug with Wappalyzer 5.4.11 ?\nI pushed a fix for a lookalike issue which was merged in 27e1fa1.\nIf it did not fix I need a reproducible way to debug it : so at least a complete URL and maybe some preconditions.. It is like this since #1917.\nAs I told in the pull request I had time to review the apps untill MediaElement.js, I have a bit of time to I will continue a bit this work.\nI think we only need to review all the js pattern after MediaElement.js (and check if we can add a version field ;)) but I do not think we need a more complex way to get js variables.. You can trigger this bug by searching inurl:index.php?route= in google.\nAs usual the html pattern is the culprit, like in #2060 ...\nMaybe we should try to use Xpath instead of matching plain html.\nWhat do you think @AliasIO, @jvoisin, @q--, @AlexByte, @kkadosh  ?. @AlexByte  It wasn't not detected in previous releases because the HTML cap was not the same before 4a711891fc4022ba8138c55c3ed44bbba32b59bb.\n. @fildenis  We can not use XPath currently so we need to implement a new way to detect technologies.\n\n@gadcam How will XPath help?\n\n@AlexByte HTML detection is really the weak point of W. : \n- the patterns are too loose cf this issue but also #2060 \n- we can not analyze a lot of HTML with regexes so we have to cap the amount of HTML to process\nWith a lot of work we can address the first concern.\nThe second point however is really bad because : we use a lot resources (sometimes it does things like #2061 or #2073) AND we surely miss a lot of things in the body of the page...\nSo XPath are selectors and so if a framework is using a given structure we could spot it and it will be different than in Google.\nYou could tell me that you can do that with regexes but I think XPath is really the tool designed to do this sort of things and you also address the performance problem.\n. To be fair I have no knowledge on XPath, I only used them a few times and neither I know how is built a OpenCart website.\nBut the main idea would be for example to check all div elements with a given class which is specific or all elements inside a p inside a ..... Also added in #2070 cf here.\nSo we need to be careful at merge time.. Duplicate of #2061. Also added in #2070. Duplicate of #1937.\nIt is an issue of Firefox cf https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/issues/1937#issuecomment-352584900.\nIf you want to help you can upvote the issue in the mozilla bug tracker (cf comment). We have only one pattern for Angular which is a HTML pattern :\nregex\n<[^>]+ ng-version=\"([\\d.]+)\"\nwhen we have a lot of differents ones for AngularJS\n\"js\": {\n    \"angular\": \"\",\n    \"angular.version.full\": \"(.*)\\\\;version:\\\\1\"\n    },\n\"script\": [\n    \"angular(?:\\\\-|\\\\.)([\\\\d.]*\\\\d)[^/]*\\\\.js\\\\;version:\\\\1\",\n    \"/([\\\\d.]+(?:\\\\-?rc[.\\\\d]*)*)/angular(?:\\\\.min)?\\\\.js\\\\;version:\\\\1\",\n    \"angular.*\\\\.js\"\n]\nHTML patterns are the least reliable ones and may not match not because they are not good but because the match is in the middle of the page and we analyse only the part around it\njs\n    if ( html.length > 100 * 1024 ) {\n      html = html.substring(0, 50 * 1024) + html.substring(html.length - 50 * 1024, html.length);\n}. 74bb8fa should help with this matter.. You can also add GazURL as a js pattern ;). You can also add the js pattern KOHA if you want cf http://koha.adminkuhn.ch/. Looks like an error of https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder.\nI can not reproduce on the demo website https://studio-42.github.io/elFinder/. I think we can close this issue.. It used to be possible but it is not anymore.\nNow we have to use this API https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/pageAction \nThis a duplicate of/This is linked to #1426 & #1541 & #1601 \nYou can check #1601 to see why it is not possible to work around this limitation.. You could maybe also ad a js pattern vaadin. @jvoisin There are at least 5300 installations ;) cf https://www.wappalyzer.com/technologies/wpcache\nTo me, everything is ok now.\n. @4cm4k1 You seem to know well these technologies so do not hesitate to review Angular & AngularJS detections :). @jvoisin should we keep both patterns ? (cf #2078). @jvoisin My policy was to always keep both pattern : someone could easily remove the React.version object but not the React object.  . Should be fixed by 74bb8fa.\nEDIT : I was wrong.. @mxschmitt @Lazza  can you still reproduce this bug with Wappalyzer 5.4.11 ?\nI pushed a fix for a lookalike issue which was merged in 27e1fa1.\nIf it did not fix I need a reproducible way to debug it : so at least a complete URL and maybe some preconditions.. @mxschmitt Facebook & Messenger can be pretty ressource consuming.\nHow do you know it is linked with Wappalyzer ?\nCould you try to extract some debug information when it happens ?. @mxschmitt The high RAM consumption is very probably not linked with Wappalyzer. (I never saw this at least)\nHigh CPU consumption can be linked with Wappalyzer when there is a catastrophic backtracking case.\nYou can use this tutorial to debug an extension https://developer.chrome.com/apps/tut_debugging\nIn the end, I could reproduce the issue and I think it is quite easy to understand what is going on haha\n\nI push a fix in a few minutes.\nPS: As you can see the heap consumption of Wappalyzer is maximum 18 Mo in this case. I think you can close this issue @castilloandres as it has been merged.. Duplicate of #2132 should be fixed by 74bb8fa.. I apologize for my quick reaction : it has not much to do with 74bb8fa in the end.\nI guessed that it has nothing to do with asynchronicity and I was right.\nAfter invegistations I finally found out what was going on :\nWe have two Regexp Criteo script pattern and Carbon Ads script pattern with which we are experiencing catastrophic backtracking.\nWe are experiencing something that catastrophic because when we get script we not only get regular scripts links but also inpage scripts.\nThis script will tell something like \"Matching on element 42 took 115663ms.\" on https://www.cisco.com/.\n```js\nconst scripts = Array.prototype.slice\n    .apply(document.scripts)\n    .filter(script => script.src)\n    .map(script => script.src);\nconst scriptsWithoutNoise = scripts.filter(element => element.indexOf(\"data:text/javascript;\") != 0); \n//const regexpCriteo = new RegExp(\"[^/]//(?:cas.criteo.com|(?:[^/].)?criteo.net)/\", \"i\");\n//const regexpCarbonAds = new RegExp(\"[^\\/]\\/\\/(?:engine|srv).carbonads.com\\/\", \"i\");\nconst annoyingRegexp = new RegExp(\"[^/]*//\", \"i\");\nfunction timeRegexp(array){\n    var totalTime = 0;\n    var i = 0;\n    array.forEach(function(element){\n        var start = new Date();\n        annoyingRegexp.test(element);\n        var subTime = new Date() - start;\n        console.log(\"Matching on element \" + i + \" took \" + subTime + \"ms.\");\n        totalTime += subTime;\n        i++;\n    });\n    console.log(\"Total time: \" + totalTime + \" ms.\");\n}\nconsole.log(\"We will time with all the scripts first :\");\ntimeRegexp(scripts);\nconsole.log(\"Now we time after filtering the scripts' array\");\ntimeRegexp(scriptsWithoutNoise);\n```. Hello @Narno,\nPartons sur Cr\u00e9ateur de Landing Page et Crypto-mineur alors :). @glad-tidings You need to upload it on your fork not in this repository directly.. Also you need to upload on the good branch so here https://github.com/glad-tidings/Wappalyzer/tree/patch-1/src/icons to be accurate.. Can you go to this page https://www.wappalyzer.com/ and copy paste the content of the console of Wappalyzer here ?\n(To find the console you need to go to about:debugging and select debug on Wappalyzer)\nEDIT : Tested Firefox Developer Edition 60.0b2 (64-bit) and I can not reproduce. Also try to disable other addons maybe. @AliasIO  What do you think about always displaying a shadowed version of the W. icon if nothing is detected ? It would avoid confusion.. Can you provide a page URL to test it ?\nFYI the pattern used to detected webpack is here https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/apps.json#L12306. Could you check the versions of Wappalyzer ? What is the URL in question ?. Maybe html to filter is a good compromise : it would solve #1395 and analyze online flavor of XHTML.. Do you mean\njs\n//# sourceMappingURL=browser-polyfill.js.map\nneed to be removed from the extension to avoid it ?. I do not think we have Heroku detection as it is hard to find a pattern for it.\nFor express.js we have a pattern \"X-Powered-By\": \"^Express$\" which is not present in this website.\nI think it is right to say that there is cowboy somewhere in the process to run this website cf https://github.com/heroku/cowboy (which implies Erlang).\nWe need the server to leak something to detect a technology but I could not find anything relevant at your URL.\nThis matter has already been discussed in #849, so if no new element is brought I think we should close this issue as it is a technical limitation.. Thank you for reporting this!\nThe URL is not taken into account here to do detection.\nIf you want, you can check the patterns here  apps.json#L3555 and look at the doc to interpret them.\nLooks like the meta description pattern is at work here and matching against this\nhtml\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"gitlabhq - GitLab CE | Please open new issues in our issue tracker on GitLab.com\" />\nand the pattern would match any description starting by Gitlab...\nSo I offer to remove it in #2191.\n. I do not understand the detection should be working : \n\nAnd in the popup there is no clue of any version detection. (checked by reading the source of it)\nMaybe the variable is initialized later ?\n(Firefox). I think it is not eligible to be in Wappalyzer as the pull request does not comply with the requirements of https://www.wappalyzer.com/docs/ cf \"Adding a new application\".. There is nothing scary when you have the explanation ;)\ninject.js is needed to make js patterns work. (You can check the source code if you are interested in how it works https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/drivers/webextension/js/inject.js)\nThe security warning looks like a CORS problem: the website is not waiting anything from any extension so there is a warning.\nMaybe we need to add a rule in the manifest to avoid it.\nHere are 3 linked bug in other addons\nhttps://github.com/bufferapp/buffer-chrome/issues/26\nhttps://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/issues/977\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react-devtools/issues/236. Yes, I think you are right and that you can close the issue.. The detection here is made with the header pattern on X-Powered-By.\nSo the culprit line could be in #2122 or #2129. (I am really sorry it seems I never sent my comment or that there was a problem when I sent it in the first place)\nThank you for contribution first contribution! But I the patterns do not seem to work :/\nOn the 10 example websites you shared I could not spot a place where the patterns would match : how did you come with them ?\nHowever these patterns seems to work on your test set : \njs\n\"html\": \"<body[^>]+ng-app=\\\"pagevamp-ecommerce\\\">\",\n\"js\": {\n  \"vampBox\": \"\"\n}\n@AliasIO can you fix that ?\n. @ujwaldhakal I understand it well.\n\nI meant two things : \n- the Pagevamp and the headers patterns does not seem to match on all the websites you gave in example so we need also other patterns, I offer two\n- the Pagevamp and the headers patterns does not seem to match on any website you gave in example so could you provide us some examples of URL where it would match :). Can you please share a real world URL causing this sort of problems ?. But you crafted this URL as I can craft a page where it would detect 500 differents technologies.\nWappalyzer has to trust the content it is given.. Can you share the URL of the installation ?\nMaybe we can do better, however it is not really a false-positive as it is not 100% sure.. These detections are caused by the last two patterns\njs\n\"script\": [\n        \"js/mage\",\n        \"skin/frontend/(?:default|(enterprise))\\\\;version:\\\\1?Enterprise:Community\",\n        \"static/_requirejs\\\\;confidence:50\\\\;version:2\",\n        \"static/frontend\\\\;confidence:20\\\\;version:2\"\n],\nIn https://recreativ.ru it triggers on\nhtml\n<script src=\"//recreativ.ru/static/frontend/js/script.js?seed=1522238110\"></script>\nAs I have no knowledge about Magento I can not even tell if there is magento or not behind this website but I think it would be good to write a better pattern or to remove it if we do not have a way to do better.. Duplicate of #1614. . @gbaudhuin  can you provide more details on how to reproduce it ?\nIt seems the version is displayed so it could only be https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/apps.json#L2671 or https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/apps.json#L2677\nwhich are not very prone to false positive.... \ud83d\udc4d . Sadly for you, the behavior of the addon is correct : the content of jQuery.ui.version is c0ab71056b936627e8a7821f03c044aec6280a40.\nWe have to trust the website to do detection there is not much to do about it :/\nHowever in this case the detection seem 100% correct cf https://searchcode.com/codesearch/view/64321654/. Agree with this one :+1:. See also #2065 . I agree, I offer that we move it to miscellaneous categorie as I did not find any good categorie for it.. The detection seems correct to me : \nYii is detected because of the detection Craft CMS which is detected via a cookie named CraftSessionId.\nAnd Yii is implying the use of PHP.\n\nsee here https://www.quora.com/What-is-Greenhouses-technology-stack\n\nAnswered Aug 10 2016 \n\n\nSo I do not know if we can still take this information as reliable.\n\nand here https://builtwith.com/?https%3a%2f%2fwww.greenhouse.io%2f\n\nHere Wappalyzer seems just to do a better job than BuiltWith : they also detected Craft CMS but they did not infer from this information that Yii was also used and so PHP ;). See #2273 for a fix.\nEven outerHTML is not enough in fact cf #615.. Can you explain the bug more in details ?\nIs the problem a race ? If so I think this bug fix is not solving it and we would maybe need to pass content as an argument of the anonymous function in asyncForEach.\nEdit : Sorry @kevNii I had a misunderstanding of the role of let here, thank you for your contribution!. I do not get the point.\nA Promise is an asynchronous call. What is the benefit to add a 1 ms delay to all Promises ?. @AlexByte I do not get your point : these app were never detected.\nHe just removed patterns that were not working. I do not see any \"editorial\" choice behind it.. @AlexByte You are right\n\nThe applications needs to be detected on at least 100 websites to be displayed.\n\nSo my comment will be a bit more nuanced.\nAccording to the Chrome Web Store there are 733 556 active installations & 76 477 for Addons Mozilla.\nI think if almost 800000 users does not find more than 100 website using a technology either the pattern is bad or there are very few website using a same piece of code and so that is irrelevant to integrate it...\nAs the documentation states\n\nOnly widely used applications should be added. When creating a pull request, please include ten or more links to websites that use the application, a GitHub page with at least 1,000 stars or anything that will help establish the size of the user base. \n\nSo according to the current policy of the project this PR seems 100% ok to me. If you are not happy with that I think the best way to proceed is to open a separate issue to exchange on this topic :) . Can you explain why ? :). Perl is deduced because of the detection of mod_perl and Wappalyzer is displaying the version number for mod_perl so it is an expected behavior.. You are right #2327 should fix it.\nThank you for your detailed bug report !. Vue is also detected for me in Firefox.. @eavichay  See https://www.wappalyzer.com/docs\n\nAdding a new application\n....\nOnly widely used applications should be added. When creating a pull request, please include ten or more links to websites that use the application, a GitHub page with at least 1,000 stars or anything that will help establish the size of the user base. . In fact each time I add a $ it's because there only IPBoard or if there is IPBoard_foobar  I'm certain to find IPBoard. If I didn't do a mistake it will match exactly the same pages\n. @q--  Told me the processing was faster if the string were more precise, it seem logical....\n. Sure... maybe having good practices with every regex will improve significantly the speed of the addon...\n. I forgot to declare them in the chrome driver, if you want I can correct it in my next pull request.\n. As before...\n. Ok in fact I think the setDetected method is called just when a pattern is matched so I don't find where it won't works with that.\nBut you're doing well reading carefully the code because I tested it only on firefox, I think especially for the DOM use.\n. You're right on each \"StateChange\" it will reevaluate. So I turn it back to its original version or we try to add a check before the this.detected = true; line ?\n. You can completely delete a pattern : you don't need to keep that line.\n. Your pattern will match each page containing Spree.\nI think you should find something more accurate..\n. It's better yes but in fact it will still match plain text : \na guideline when you write an HTML is to avoid matching text, you will often have to put at least an HTML tag like ]* for the CSS file in that example.\n. You maybe could simplify it with a collection : \n\"html\": \"]+wp-(?:content|includes)\",\n. I think you should change it in:\n\njson\n\"headers\": { \"X-Powered-By\": \"\\\\bLua(?: ([\\\\d.]+))?\\\\;version:\\\\1\" }\nBecause you don't need the first group to be capturing and it's better for performance. :)\n. This line hasn't to be there you have to either delete it or put it before the \"implies\" with a comma at the end of each line before the \"implies\" field.\nEDIT : The html field seems a bit too broad and for the script I think you should just write Kooboo. Thank you for your contribution :)\n. I think it's better to put the implies field at the end because it's a result of the patterns and as it is as it in all the other apps.\n. You should rename TYPO3.png to TYPO3 CMS.png in the folder share/images/icons\n. You have to keep the space.\nWhen Wappalyzer is displaying an icon it is loaded from (you can find the code in the Chrome driver)\njs\n'images/icons/' + appName + '.png'\n. I think you wanted to write\n(?:ga|urchin|(analytics))\\.js\n. As it I understand what you want to do ! :)\nBut for the performance (?) and for the ease of reading I think the better is to just write\njs\n\"html\": \"<form name=\\\"product\\\" method=\\\"post\\\" action=\\\"[^\\\"]+\\\\?do=addtocart&prodid=\\\\d+\\\".+<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"addtocart\\\" value=\\\"\\\\d+\\\">\",\n. The dot need to be escaped I think.\n. I think the URL pattern is too loose. (Cf. https://www.google.fr/search?q=inurl%3Aglyphicons)\n. It seems you don't need a capturing group here.\n. I'm talking about \"url\": \"glyphicons\" which doesn't require .css\n. I think\njs\n\"copyright\": \"^TiddlyWiki created by Jeremy Ruston\"\nis enough for the copyright field and you forgot the capturing group for the tiddlywiki-version field.\nAfter these corrections I think it will be perfect, thank you for contributing !\n. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3512471/non-capturing-group\nYou should add :? at the beginning of the group as you don't need to reuse the group.\nAsk me if you need some more explanations.\n. Sorry I didn't understand your question. Can you rephrase it a bit please ?\nYou need to be a bit more precise otherwise you will produce a lot of false positive.\nDo you have some URL that you would like the pattern to match with ?\n. As told in the specification page of the wiki the URL pattern is only tested against the URL of the current page.\n. I forgot to add that if you want to do what you were saying you could use the html field.\n. Sorry but I still see the dollar symbol at the end of the copyright field.\n. Both of the .+ are not necessary. It's not an error but if you add some commit I think it's better to remove them.\n. You don't need the brackets at this line and at L1665.\n. I think you need brackets here like this\"implies\": [ \"OpenLayers\", \"Leaflet\" ].\nThe implies field is an array.\n. The meta field is an object you were right before : you need to use curly brackets. Thank you for contributing !\n. I think href=[^\\\"] should be href=\"[^\\\"]\n. The ? is not needed and the group is a capturing one. Otherwise it's perfect.\n. Sorry I did not know that we can make a star lazy.\n. You have to keep the first pattern you tried because I think this one is a bit too broad as SSESSID is a very common name of cookie and CMS is also a generic term, some false positives will occur.\nYou have to escape the \\ (see https://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/wiki/Specification, a very useful page if you want to contribute) so you should write :\njs\n\"headers\": { \"Set-Cookie\": \"^CMSSESSID[\\\\da-f]{8}$\" }\n. I think you could write something simpler\njs\n\"script\": [ \"petrojs(?:\\\\-|\\\\.)([\\\\d.]*\\\\d)[^/]*\\\\.js\\\\;version:\\\\1\", \"(?:/([\\\\d.]+)/)?petrojs(?:\\\\.min)?\\\\.js\\\\;version:\\\\1\" ],\n. There is a little problem here and at the line 2423..\n. I think the pattern should be\njs\n\"env\": \"^RightJS$\"\n. If in the group there is the version number you can add the detection for it with\njs\n \"headers\": { \"X-Powered-By\": \"CppCMS/([\\\\d.]+)\\\\;version:\\\\1\" },\notherwise you should use a non-capturing group to improve performance see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3512471/non-capturing-group.\n. You don't need a capturing group (and there is an unescaped dot at L315).\n. Why did you changed it ?\n. You need to escape the dot like this \"X-Powered-CMS\": \"Mean\\.io\" ortherwise it will match any character.\n. You should write [^>]+ to match several characters.\nYou don't have to escape slashes.\nThe group has to be non-capturing like this (?:'|\\\") but when there is only one character I prefer to write ['\\\"] as it is easier to read.\nMaybe the script is a better option.. see https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/wiki/Specification\nand the wiki overall.\nThen it will be perfect. :) Thank you for contributing !\n. \"+\" I think there is a little problem..\n. You can use a script field for the second part of the pattern see https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/wiki/Specification.\nI think [^>] should be [^>]+\n. You don't need to escape the slashes.\nIf the pattern you added only matches version 5 you can add a version field see https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/wiki/Specification#patterns\n. Yes, if you change it to\njs\n\"script\": \"(?:(shopware)|/web/cache/[0-9]{10}_.+)\\\\.js\\\\;version:\\\\1?4:5\",\nit would be perfect.\n(To be accurate you need to escape backslashes but not slashes)\n. Thank you for contributing !\n. You can make all groups non capturing : \njs\n\"script\": \"(?:semantic(?:\\\\.js|\\\\.min\\\\.js))\",\n. Why do you write this pattern ? Isn't it the same than the script's one ?\n. If you want to match a dot I think you'd better escape it.\n. I read too fast and didn't know it could be loaded like this.\n:+1: \n. Both patterns will match the same thing as .* is \"optional\".\n. The ? is making it optional.\n. A good practice is to ensure HTML patterns won't match plain text see https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/wiki/Specification#too-generic-patterns\nYou should include an HTML tag in them.\n. You should escape the dot and the brackets by adding \\ before them.\n. Why don't you use a script field ? Cf https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/wiki/Specification. HTML patterns shouldn't match plain text see https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/wiki/Specification\nIn order to correct it you could add some HTML tag in the pattern.. Why not use the script tag ? See https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/wiki/Specification . ([0-9.]) shouldn't be ([0-9.]+) ?. I agree with @jvoisin : the pattern should start with / and the final dot must be escaped. If the URL doesn't take any argument then you can even add $ at the end.\nSo the pattern could be \"script\": \"/moon(?:\\\\.min)?\\\\.js$\". I think replacing (?:\\\\-|\\\\.) with [-.] can make it a bit more readable.. Sorry but I don't understand : what is role of these groups (?:) ?\nMoreover why didn't you remove the version detection ?. This pattern isn't relevant as it will trigger a lot of false positive IMO. What do you think @AliasIO  ?. Hi @nvanthao,\nWhy don't try to match something like  haravan_common\\.js or haravan\\.plugin\\.[\\d.]+\\.js ?\nI didn't find an example that won't match with the second pattern if there is something to match in the script field.\nCheers. I'm really sorry : I omit to say you need to double escape in apps.json like this\n\"shapecss\\\\.(?:min\\\\.)?(?:[a-f\\d]+\\\\.)?js\",. The same apply here : [.A-Za-z/0-9_-] can be written as [a-z\\d/._-] and slashes do not need to be escaped see the specification page ;). You should check the meta see https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/wiki/Specification#json-fields ;). You don't need to escape slashes and you need to escape dots.\nMoreover you could unify all theses patterns in this one:\n<[^>]+(?:https?:)?//(?:assets|downloads|images|videos)\\\\.contentful\\\\.com. I think the better would be Nop\\\\.customer=.\nThe dot need to be escaped so it will only match a dot and adding the equal sign will ensure that it is the name of the cookie not its content.\nNop\\\\.customer= is in \\\\.Nop\\\\.customer= so it will also match.\n(Please note that the patterns are case insensitive). The fields name in headers and meta are case sensitive if I am right so you maybe need to write X-Powered-By. You don't need a group so you can remove it. I think it would be better to escape the dots with two backslashes.. Are you sure that Apache is always the first thing to appear in the header ? If I am right when several apps are adding content to the header it is not true.. Same remark : when several cookies are set at the same time will this rule work ?. I don't have a definitive answer but you should look into https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11533867/set-cookie-header-with-multiple-cookies and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2880047/is-it-possible-to-set-more-than-one-cookie-with-a-single-set-cookie.. Moving on https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/cookies would solve this issue, what do you think ? (and for the NPM driver we could use browser.cookies / browser.cookies.dump(output?)). The dot could be escaped ? . You could use https.. Is the version number always present ? If not you should make this part optional (as the min part I think). You need to write \\\\d. You can merge these 4 patterns like this\njs\n<!-- (?:Start|End) Visual Website Optimizer A?Synchronous Code -->. There seems to be one : \njs\n\"js\": {\n  \"Minero\": \"\"\n}. I think you can remove the group.. You missed the : in the beginning ;). I think you need to change it to\njson\n\"html\": \"<html[^>]* (?:amp|\u26a1)\",\nand you could add\njson\n\"html\": \"<(?:style )?amp-\",\nAlso you could add a detection by js variable\njson\n\"js\": {\n     \"ampExtendedElements\": \"\",\n     \"__AMP_BODY_VISIBLE\": \"\"\n}. The regexes are matched against the content of the Javascript methods (if necessary cf https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Method for what is a method in JS)\nSo in this case as we have no regex we just check if the object KOHA does exist.\n. Does this mean you need both Apache and Nginx to run wpCache ?. I read the documentation where it is written\n\nDoes wpCache\u00ae run with Apache, Nginx, Lighttpd...?\nYes, wpCache\u00ae is compatible with Apache, Nginx, Microsoft IIS et\nLiteSpeed web servers.\n\nI saw no mention of a strong requirement of Apache or Nginx so I think you should remove them from the implies field. :) (cf https://www.wappalyzer.com/docs/specification for the exact meaning of the implies field). gx alone is too false positive prone : a lot of JS packers generate short variable names. I think the best is just to remove it as you already added gx.evt. You do not need to escape the dot see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10397968/escape-dot-in-a-regex-range.\n(and it is the same for the other pattern). Don't you think it needs a capturing group ?. I am sorry I did not have time to review it before it was merged but I think there is a typo and that\n(?:https):? should be somthing like(?:https?:)? or (?:https:)?.. I do not think ^/ will work any better :p \nDo we agree these 3 patterns are TLD where the scripts are hosted ?. See https://www.wappalyzer.com/docs/specification\nThe header key is case sensitive when the pattern on its value is not.. Thank you for your contribution!\nI think you can do even write to enable version detection\n<!-- Site made with Mobirise Website Builder v([\\\\d.]+)\\\\;version:\\\\1. Same for this one\n^Mobirise v([\\\\d.]+)\\\\;version:\\\\1. I think you forgot a \" at the end of the pattern ;). Why did you drop the \"version\" detection ? Was it irrelevant ?. The logic is that if the capturing group (authedmine) is here it will display CoinHive opt-in because you can configure CoinHive so it would only mine if the user accepts it.. If you escape this dot then LGTM.. ",
    "q--": "Any reason why Jira is in both Dev Tools and Issue Trackers?\n. eZ Systems has announced that eZ Publish 5 will include Symfony2. However, eZ Publish does not disclose its version currently. If this changes in the next version, this will offer an opportunity for detecting Symfony.\nAdditionally, some sites (such as Youropi and Symfony.com set a cookie named symfony.\n. > ```\n\n\"headers\": { \"X-Powered-By\": \"Drupal ([0-9]+)\\;version=$1\" }\n```\n\nTo be honest, it looks like a very ugly solution to me. I also think it has the potential to slow down Wappalyzer because the string will have to be split and parsed every time (depending on how you implement it; this does not apply if you pre-load all the regular expressions).\nA cleaner way to do things would be something like:\n\"AppName\": {\n  \"headers\" : {\n    \"X-Y-Z\" : \"Ap(p)?Name_(\\\\d+)|App Name ([\\\\d\\\\.]+)\"\n  },\n \"matches\": {\n   \"headers\" : {\n     \"X-Y-Z\" : {\n       2 : \"6\",\n       3 : \"$3\"\n     }\n   }\n}\nLogic:\nThe 2 and 3 are capture groups.\nSo, 2 is the (\\\\d+) after Name_.\nThe string at these indexes is the text that will be displayed if a match was found. In these strings, $<number> will be replaced by the matched text of capture group <number>.\nIf no match was found, Wappalyzer will continue to the next capture group.\n. > something like the following:\n\n\"AppName\": {\n  \"headers\" : {\n    \"Foo\" : [ \"(Foo)\", \"(FooBar)\" ]\n  },\n  \"version\": {\n    \"headers\": {\n       \"Foo\": [ [ \"6\", \"$3\" ], [ \"7\" ] ]\n    }\n  }, \n  \"confidence\": {\n    \"headers\": {\n       \"Foo\": [ null, 50 ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThat's not how I had it in mind.\nMy idea was to use 1 RegEx, and for each capture group (the part between brackets) that may contain a version number, specify a result string.\n\"AppName\": {\n  \"headers\" : {\n    \"Foo\" : \"SomeText (CaptureGroup1) MoreText (CaptureGroup2WithVersionNumber)\"\n  },\n  \"version\": {\n    \"headers\": {\n       \"Foo\": { \"2\": \"$2\" }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nAlthough this may become problematic if you want to specify confidence as well.\n. \"The CDN category should be limited to services such as CloudFlare and Akamai who deliver the entire website through a distributed network, not video hosts or Amazon S3 for hosting images etc.\"\nLooks like it's still in the code.\n\"I've categorized it as (...) \"CDN\" (since they host the video)\"\nNo, they don't.

The website of the author does have one though, namely this one.\n. \"Chameleon==>chameleon cms \"\nI think the add-on is right, and that it should be \"Chameleon\". Or was that what you meant?\n. Ah, I thought the Shop + the CMS were one product.\nOr are they? Both the shop and the CMS use the same meta generator tag value: Chameleon Content Management System - chameleon-cms.com.\nNow I also see that this Chameleon CMS and this one (to which, I suppose, Wappalyzer.com attempts to link) apparently aren't the same system.\n. I'd open that issue before II saw your comment here, if I remember it well.\nHowever, the advantage of putting everything in its own issue is that you can keep track of issues more easily; you can resolve incorrect name issue 1, mark it as Fixed so that you know that you've done this already and move on to issue #2. You don't have to figure where you was with resolving the problem (was it incorrect name 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11?).\n. My guess is @ElbertF made the changes in his local repository of the website and will update Wappalyzer.com with them soon.\n. For reference: https://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/commit/11de2c5fa8fc5e991147a69df4dea61c69615829#L6L1508\n. I just noticed this is about the same as https://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/pull/123. What happened to that code?\n. By the way, you've already pushed this update to Google Chrome: \n. https://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/commit/11de2c5fa8fc5e991147a69df4dea61c69615829#commitcomment-2015368\n.

By the way, I found all these using the following RegEx: ((\\s|:)\\/|\"|')I (case-insensitive mode)\n. It's already starting to affect the graph:\n. @ElbertF Possibly, but it may also have to do something with Github for Windows not liking symbolic links; I've had problems committing files and Github for Windows reported that files had changed whilst in fact they hadn't.\nWhen I added & committed from the command line in commit https://github.com/q--/Wappalyzer/commit/a784ca45e012a974df07e45f1c9d278b3022617b and onwards, I've had no problems.\n. @gadcam I'm using N++ as well, so I don't think that's the cause of the large number of changed lines. Besides, I've thought of that as well when I made the commits the first time (I later redid everything because I couldn't find out why the I's had disappeared.)\nI really think Github for Windows is the cause. They may say it's the easiest way, but it looks like it isn't the best. So, I will have to learn a bit more about Git and see if I can make these changes without the large number of changed lines.\n. How about detecting \"html\": \"<script[^>]+src=('|\\\")includes/javascript/ajax_shopping_cart\\\\.js('|\\\")?\n. You forgot to add \"implies\": [ \"Java\" ]\n. Don't forget about\nfunction detectMe(){}\n window['detectMe']=stuff\n window.detectMe=stuff\nAnd of course, many environment variables are declared in included libraries.\nHow would you, for example, detect jQuery embedded using RequireJS?\n. My point with the included libraries is that whatever tool is trying to detect a JS variable, it will have to download all included JavaScript. For things like <script src='myLib.js'></script>, this might be feasible - but there are many ways to embed JavaScript dynamically.\nTools won't be able to detect these if HTML is not parsed, so detection will be less accurate.\nThis doesn't have to be a big problem, but it will impact detection.\n. I believe a commit of @gadcam removed that in the ElbertF/Wappalyzer repository which I merged with my fork. I didn't remove the jQuery files.\n. I see. Maybe it's got something to do with the directory junctions (as Windows calls them) for the libs folder? Because Git removed those two folders, Windows may have removed the other ones as well.\nAnyway, I will re-add jQuery to my local repository.\n. CMS Made Simple is already in Wappalyzer: https://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/blob/master/share/apps.json#L289\n. If possible, could you place a 301 redirect at http://wappalyzer.com/applications/reallycms? People are still using an add-on that links to that page, and Google will like it as well if you tell it where the page went.\n. So, instead of this:\n\nsomething like:\n\n?\n. You haven't added this to Wappalyzer.com yet.\n. > I use Github for Windows if I'm pretty sure it's the culpit, I ask the Github team now if it's a feature... or a bug!\n\n(I found that but I think the default parametter should be 'don't modify' https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings)\n\nI've figured out the same myself. After I turned core.autocrlf off, everything worked fine.\nI suspect GitHub for Windows does convert the LF to CRLF, but doesn't convert them back before committing.\nAccording to the Git manual, it should do this. So, I think it's a bug.\n. I took another look... In the last paragraph, they say \"Mit der Shop-Version koobi:shop steht Ihnen zu der Funktionalit\u00e4t des CMS ein leistungsf\u00e4higes Shop-System zur Verf\u00fcgung\".\nIt's a bit difficult to translate, but it implies about With the Shop Edition koobi:shop you'll have, besides CMS functionality, a powerful shop at your avail.\nSo, it appears the shop is a different edition of the same system which adds shopping functionality.\n. You're welcome.\n. By the way, this commit also updates the Piwik icon, so you may want to replace the icon at Wappalyzer.com with this more current icon as well.\n\nThey also reported Joomla is incorrectly being detected on RCMS sites for some reason.\n\nThen there has to be something wrong with the Joomla pattern's matching. Any idea what it could be?\n. By the way, the jQTouch icon in this issue looks like it was automatically resized from the higher resolution icon.\nThe icon in #203 is manually cropped and sharper, so you can better use  for Wappalyzer.com as well.\n. Of course, you can also use the bookmarklet if you don't want to have the icons shown all the time.\n. > As a side note: have you ever thought about detecting not only web apps/technologies, but also their versions?\nSee https://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/issues/76\n. I believe DownThemAll! shows a short introductionary video after installation. Maybe Wappalyer can do the same.\nWhat would have to be in such a video:\n1. Explain where Wappalyzer is.\n2. Explain what the icons are.\n3. Explain how you can set options, and explain each option.\nYou should at least make a different video for each platorm Wappalyzer works at (Chrome / Firefox / Bookmarklet). If nescessary, you should split it out between Operating Systems.Also, It would probably be a good idea to show the other platforms that Wappalyzer is available for at the /installed page.\nThere could also be a FAQ section at the website. Preferrably, the FAQ would have a feedback form at the bottom (that does not require signing up to GitHub) for additional questions users may have.\n. Ok,\n1. It has a JavaScript variable named AmCharts.\n2. Icon: \n. Some suspects:\n\"html\": \"Drupal(\\\\.extend)?.+settings|<(link|style)[^>]+sites/(default|all)/(themes|modules)/\",\n\"headers\": { \"X-Drupal-Cache\": \".*\", \"X-Generator\": \"Drupal(\\\\s([\\\\d\\\\.]+))?\\\\;version:\\\\2\", \"Expires\": \"19 Nov 1978\" },\nDrupal(\\\\.extend)?.+settings will match any page which contains \"drupal\", and \"settings\" anywhere in the HTML after it.\n\"Expires\": \"19 Nov 1978\" will match any page set to expire at 19 November 1978 (to disable caching). It may be further refined to match only ^Sun, 19 Nov 1978 05:00:00 GMT$.\n<(link|style)[^>]+sites/(default|all)/(themes|modules)/ looks somewhat generic as well.\n. Amaya has its own logo, namely , found at http://www.w3.org/Amaya/ (top right).\n. How about this? The only thing that's missing are the line breaks, but I don't think you can detect them anyway.\n. Yes, I tested the code before modifying it slightly to make it work in Wappalyzer.\nIf you want to test it, simply paste this in the JS console in Fx at the website mentioned by @gadcam:\n```\nvar content=window;\n    // HTML\n    var html = content.document.documentElement.outerHTML;\n//Detect comments after \nvar commentAfterHtml = content.document.documentElement.nextSibling;\nwhile(commentAfterHtml !== null){\n  if(commentAfterHtml.nodeType === 8){\n    html+=''+commentAfterHtml.textContent+'';\n  }\n  commentAfterHtml = commentAfterHtml.nextSibling;\n}\nhtml;\n```\n. By the way, http://wappalyzer.com/applications/kolibri-cms and http://wappalyzer.com/applications/viennacms are using the DataLife Engine icon too.\n. I've had some issues after upgrading to Fx29+ too. Try removing and re-installing Wappalyzer and see if it resolves the problem.\n. I forgot: the script can be accessed trough both HTTPS and HTTP. So it should be:\n\"script\": \"^https?://server\\\\.bittads\\\\.com/js/bitt\\\\.js$\",\n. @ElbertF If AddThis was wrong, you'll have to fix 2z project as well.\n(Tested with document.body.textContent.match(/.+[^\\\\];version.+/i) at share/apps.json.)\n. For future reference, here a table with regular expression engines that are / aren't compatible with this:\nFeatureJGsoft.NETJavaPerlPCREECMAPythonRubyTcl AREPOSIX BREPOSIX EREGNU BREGNU EREXMLXPath (?:regex) (non-capturing group) YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES no no no no no no\nSource: http://www.regular-expressions.info/refflavors.html\n. I think you could divide the script patter into multiple patterns; one for the bootstrap loaded from Twitter's Github account, which has full confidence, and the other for files called bootstrap[.min].js which will have low confidence. Currently, this is one pattern with full confidence.\nYou might want to add CDN-hosted bootstrap versions (such as at CDNJS.com) to a pattern with high confidence as well.\n. I made a start here. Code is working, but needs some polish. Don't pull yet.\n. For same-domain stylesheets, each CSS rule can be read out through document.styleSheets[number].cssRules[number].cssText\n. The file with the icon is still called s9y.png.\n. 16\u00d716 PNG: \n. The Windows detection is due to the ASP.Net detection. ASP.Net is indeed running on this server, but it is running under Linux and the Mono framework.\nSolution: Don't imply Windows for ASP.NET if Mono is detected.\nXamarin.com (not xamarian) headers:\nhttp://xamarin.com/studio\nGET /studio HTTP/1.1\nHost: xamarin.com\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:20.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/20.0\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\nAccept-Language: nl,en-us;q=0.7,en;q=0.3\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nDNT: 1\nCookie: ASP.NET_SessionId=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\nConnection: keep-alive\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Fri, 10 May 2013 17:08:41 GMT\nServer: Apache/2.2.20 (Ubuntu)\nFFI-Control: Data\nFFI-Mode: Content\nX-AspNetMvc-Version: 3.0\nX-AspNet-Version: 4.0.30319\nExpires: Fri, 10 May 2013 17:16:16 GMT\nVary: Accept-Encoding\nX-Powered-By: Mono\nCache-Control: public\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\nX-Varnish: 1515582641\nAge: 0\nVia: 1.1 varnish\nContent-Encoding: gzip\nContent-Length: 7796\n.

I've included these other ways of detection in a new patch (includes previous patch): https://mega.co.nz/#!MJsSGRBD!DrrUhjHkh03KUZTdqctYMH8ar6NGGiUZvyu3fImemWo\n. For future reference: if you only want to run Wappalyzer manually, you can use the bookmarklet provided here,\n. Question: are other detection patterns for a certain tool evaluated even if the confidence is already 100% or higher? If so, it should be easy to improve performance. If we evaluate the most resource-intensive patterns at last, it could easily make a huge difference in performance.\n. @ElbertF\nThe root URL of pages should be /, e.g. http://www.example.pl/, so they shouldn't be picked up by this pattern.\nAFAIK the slash isn't trimmed by Wappalyzer?\n. I mean:\n\\.pl(?:$|\\?) shouldn't match http://example.pl/ because of the slash at the end, right? (Maybe I should test it... When I have time for it.)\n. I confused it with script. See #354.\n. @inspector71 Check if you've enabled JavaScript analysis. Paste chrome://wappalyzer/content/xul/preferences.xul into your address bar and look if the box in front of \"Analyze JavaScript\" is checked. Don't forget to save your changes to the options with the OK button hidden at the bottom right corner of the screen.\n. I see www.perl.org currently has a favicon. Can't we simply use that?\nCurrent icon:Perl.org favicon:\n\n. Looking at the source code of sarka-spip.net, the meta generator tag could be used to distinguish SPIP from Sarka-SPIP:\n<meta name=\"generator\" content=\"SPIP 3.0.13 - Sarka-SPIP 3.3.36 SVN [79915]\" />\nThe pattern is slightly different for SPIP and Sakra-SPIP, by the way:\n\n. Has happened to me before as well. I think you can fix this by setting core.autocrlf to false (or true, I'm not entirely sure) for the Wappalyzer repository (leave out --global), replacing the incorrect line endings in your commit (in Notepad++: display line endings, Ctrl+H, go to the Replace tab, set search mode to Extended and replace \\r\\n by \\n), doing git add * and git commit --amend --all (you will edit the current commit, just keep the commit message the same), then pushing it to your repo with the push -f (force) option as follows: git push -f origin master.\nI'm doing this from memory, please warn if it doesn't work.\n. Personally, I don't see the Chrome extension's one-button approach as an advantage but rather as a restriction that is the result of the limits imposed by the Chrome API.\nI do use the Chrome extension (it's one of the first things I install when setting up a new Chrome profile), but I really like about the Firefox version that I can see at a single glance what technology a web site is using. On Firefox, I often click trough to the Wappalyzer web site to find out more about a technology. On Chrome I do that as well, but much less often.\nI'm not sure if that's only something I do (you may be able to figure out by comparing usage statistics to your site's Google Analytics), but it would surprise me if there aren't more people who think the same about his.\nAdditionally, there is the factor of habituation. There are tens of thousands of users which are used to Wappalyzer working this way. If Wappalyzer all of a sudden would remove a feature this useful, you will at least have negative reactions \u2013 not so many yet  because the change has only reached the few people that are actively following Wappalyzer development, but if the change is send out to everyone you can expect a lot more \u2013 and probably some people which feel this is no longer the Wappalyzer they liked so much and stop using it. (Of course it's free so people don't have much right to complain, but I think you can expect to loose some users.)\nHowever, since there is not much competition for Wappalyzer on Firefox, there is also a risk that someone who likes Wappalyzer but not the change will decide to fork Wappalyzer in a separate extension (e.g. \"Wappalyzer Classic\"), resulting in a division of the user base.\nWell, that's what I think of it, basically. I think the new Wappalyzer could use an option to toggle the old way of displaying apps back on, but at the very least users should be informed well about this mayor change, so that less people will be confused and angry when their Wappalyzer seems to \"disappear\" etc.\n. - I don't see this <meta> tag back in the source of AnchorCMS.com. I see it at other sites though, so I think it's OK.\n- Their favicon  and the logo they provide here are black, so I think a black icon would be more logical.\n- You have given it category 1 (CMS), but looking at their site I think category 11 (blog) is more appropriate. Maybe you should add both.\n. Thank you very much. If I may give another suggestion, it would be nice if there were numbers on the X axis of the \"Growth over time\" statistic, like this for example:\n\n. Also, why are you not sending the domain name when _any_ part of the URL matches the following regular expression?\n/((local|dev(elopment)?|stag(e|ing)?|test(ing)?|demo(shop)?|admin|google)\\.|\\/admin|\\.local)/\nSince Wappalyzer is only sending out the host name, detecting apps with this in the URL won't be problematic.\nBesides, the RegEx is case sensitive so it won't match Admin etc.\n. A demo of a newer version of ImpressPages can be found at http://test1234.impresspages.com/#.\nFrom the location of CSS and scripts in the source code, I think this may be version 3.7. If that is correct, these URLs could be used to determine the ExpressPages version:\n<link href=\"http://test1234.impresspages.com/core/3.7/ip_cms/modules/standard/configuration/public/global.css?1\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" />\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://test1234.impresspages.com/core/3.7/ip_libs/js/jquery/jquery.js?1\"></script>\n. This is issue #460. The preferences you previously set are still respected, even if you can't see or change them.\n. This will work fine if Ophal always shows a version number, but it won't work in case of a header with the value Ophal/<any non-digit or nothing at all>.\nSince the current pattern already requires a / after Ophal, this may actually be the case. Can someone verify this?\n. @gadcam When testing, I found out that the [a-z]{\u2026} part didn't even work. The com|net|org part did work though, and I didn't have time to figure out what was the correct way to do this. So yes, if the RegEx works better with your change you can use that.\n. @gadcam Your last RegEx contains a small mistake; :? in the first capture group should be ?:.\nOther than that, :+1: nice job. I'll see if I can add the fixes to my pull request.\n. @ElbertF I think you can pull in this.\n. It looks like your image is already pretty optimized (Smush.it did not find any savings), still I was able to get 173 bytes off the size using TruePNG: .\nI think @ElbertF won't worry too much about it, but I wanted to try it anyway. Thanks for your pull request!\n. Well, you could use multiple patterns, one strict pattern with full confidence and one less strict pattern with less confidence. However, since you have both a script pattern and an HTML pattern, you could use a less strict pattern both times and give both 50%-99% confidence so that they will only have full confidence when both the script and the HTML patterns match.\nHowever, as for your statement \u2018as far as I see the only part which will be not removed in custom installation should be \"/Kooboo\"\u2019, I don't see this for the web pages linked under \u201cOur clients\u201d at the Kooboo web site. For some, the source code doesn't contain the word \u201cKooboo\u201d at all, the others would be matched with the patterns I proposed.\n. Looks like I was mistaken, I thought I had downloaded the latest version but for some reason I was using 2.7.8  (I couldn't confirm this earlier because it only happened on my work computer) and some icons weren't showing. Everything is working now though. I'm not sure what caused it, however.\nApologies for the inconvenience.\n. Looks like I looked at the wrong place to test it. I must not have been very alert last Friday.\nApologies again, I'll close the issue.\n. Looking at the headers for that page, I have no idea why Nginx is detected on that page.\nThere is no nginx in the headers:\nHTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\nLast-Modified: Tue, 25 Mar 2014 12:09:44 GMT\nCache-Control: private, max-age=600\nExpires: Tue, 25 Mar 2014 12:50:20 GMT\nDate: Tue, 25 Mar 2014 12:40:20 GMT\nConnection: keep-alive</del>\n_Edit: _ as @ElbertF pointed out this is due to caching.\n. If the problem is indeed with the User Agent, it looks like it's possible to set the User-Agent for urllib2. \nurllib2\u2018s default user agent string is \"Python-urllib/2.6\" (on Python 2.6), maybe that setting it to Chrome (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/33.0.1750.154 Safari/537.36) or Firefox (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:28.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/28.0) will work better.\nHowever, when sending a request with the Python urllib headers, I still get \nRequest headers:\nGET /article/2104123-dont-fiddle-while-fireeye-burns HTTP/1.1\nHost: seekingalpha.com\nUser-Agent: Python-urllib/2.6\nConnection: close\nResponse headers:\nHTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden\nServer: nginx/1.4.1\nContent-Type: text/html\nContent-Encoding: gzip\nCache-Control: private, max-age=600\nExpires: Wed, 26 Mar 2014 14:25:05 GMT\nDate: Wed, 26 Mar 2014 14:15:05 GMT\nTransfer-Encoding:  chunked\nConnection: close\nConnection: Transfer-Encoding\nSo, it should still be possible to detect Nginx using the headers.\n. It looks like they have removed the X-Umbraco-Version header.\nIs there any other way to detect it?\n. Maybe we could add a pattern for the Umbraco back-end.\nThat way, we could still detect Umbraco if someone uses the admin panel.\n. Duplicate of #478.\n. Not sure if it helps, but you can try downloading version 3.0.4 from here and see if it works.\n. Perhaps it's a problem with your profile or a conflict with other extensions. Creating a new profile (start up Firefox with firefox -no-remote -P) will probably help.\n(However, unless you are willing to reconfigure Firefox you may not want to switch to a new profile entirely, so if you go back to your old profile the same problem will occur.)\n. What he means:\n\nThe application names always link to the page of the last application in the pop-up.\nAnd these lines of code are wrong; by the time the click handler is executed, appName has a different value (namely, the value of the last app added to the menu) than when the event listener was attached.\n. Head.js\nThe URL pattern is too broad. It would match files like website_header.js and typeahead.js.\nEnvironment\nI see that Head.js can optionally be configured with the variable head_conf. We could detect that, but it wouldn't be present on every site.\nOf course, we can choose to include the ^head$ pattern and give it a low confidence.\nFrom the same page, I also see that Head.js can be included with a <script> tag with the data-headjs-load attribute. That's something that could be detected as well.\nJSON\nAs for the JSON rules: the header pattern (.*(application\\\\/JSON|text\\\\/JSON).*) doesn't need .* at the beginning and end, because unless you start a regex with ^ or end it with $ it will match anywhere inside a string. (Same for the URL pattern, which you should close with (?:$|\\\\?) so it matches foo.json and bar.json?xyz=1 but not this.page.is.about.JSON.html.)\nAlso, you could make the capture group non-capturing since you don't use the data. Further, you are repeating JSON in your regex, whilst the only part that does actually differ is application / text.\nSo, the header pattern could become:\n(?:application|text)\\\\/JSON\nAs for the HTML pattern, that's too broad as well. Use less dots and more of things like [^>]. Also, I doubt we would need to match any web site linking to a .json file. I think it would be better to just detect actual JSON files, when viewed directly. (I'm not sure if Wappalyzer runs at non-HTML pages, though.)\nAs for the script pattern, although JSON is valid JavaScript, because pure JSON is never assigned to a variable the object will never be accessible to the script and fall prey to the garbage collector of the browser's JavaScript engine. If a <script> tag links to a file with .json in the name, it is most likely not JSON, but some JavaScript object with var variableName = in front or a call to a callback function wrapped around it. (This technique is called JSONp, but it technically isn't JSON.)\n. It also happens if you view apps.json when not in edit mode.\nThe offending patterns are:\n- Yandex.Metrika:\n  - \"html\": \"mc\\\\.yandex\\\\.ru\\/metrika\\/watch\\\\.js|\\\\b(?:yaParams|yaCounter|yandex_metrika_callbacks)\\\\b\",\n- TWiki:\n  - \"html\": \"This site is powered by the TWiki collaboration platform\"\n  - (Also, the TWiki script pattern could be improved by making the capture groups non-capturing. I'll submit a PR for this.)\n- Store Systems:\n  - \"html\": \"Shopsystem von <a href=[^>]+store-systems\\\\.de\\\"|\\\\.mws_boxTop\"\nAnd a few others. I don't have time to look into them right now. I may edit this comment when I have  time.\n. As for the confidence thing, I've been thinking for longer that you could perhaps set a confidence threshold before an app is shown, so that you can use multiple patterns  to detect some apps for which one pattern isn't sufficiently precise. This doesn't have to be negative, you could just choose a low percentage (like 25%) below which apps aren't shown.\nAs for the GitHub Pages server, I know that GitHub has a product called Github Enterprise which is basically GitHub installed on your own server, but I don't think this is what powers GitHub pages; it's probably some standard web server with a renamed header, like Nginx.\n. I think it would be a good idea to change the confidence of the PHP header pattern`, then.\n. @DaAwesomeP There are no negative array indexes in JavaScript. You're assigning object properties instead. Also, I still think it may be a better idea to just set a confidence threshold.\n. There isn't, I checked the source code.\nIt is, however, possible to detect Lodash using a script pattern.\nHere are some Lodash URLs from cdnjs.com:\n```\nVersion 2.4.1\n//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/2.4.1/lodash.backbone.js\n//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/2.4.1/lodash.backbone.min.js\n//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/2.4.1/lodash.compat.js\n//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/2.4.1/lodash.compat.min.js\n//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/2.4.1/lodash.js\n//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/2.4.1/lodash.legacy.js\n//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/2.4.1/lodash.legacy.min.js\n//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/2.4.1/lodash.min.js\n//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/2.4.1/lodash.mobile.js\n//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/2.4.1/lodash.mobile.min.js\n//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/2.4.1/lodash.underscore.js\n//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/2.4.1/lodash.underscore.min.js\n```\n. The link given by @gadcam only shows the version of Wappalyzer that is approved by Mozilla, which still has the problem. If you click through to the all versions page and get the latest version from there, it should work.\n. That may be an issue specific to the previous version.\nThe update was from 3.0.4 to 3.0.10, so that could be the case. I'm not sure how to test for this though, because a tab displaying the icons needs to be active when Wappalyzer is uninstalled, which is not the case when uninstalling from the Add-ons manager because it has no address bar. \n. @bagit \nThere have been some issues for people upgrading to Firefox 29. It's just a guess, but could you try uninstalling and re-installing?\n. It's Contao, not Cantao.\nIt is already included in Wappalyzer, but does not have a meta pattern: https://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/blob/master/share/apps.json#L551\nShould be easy enough to write a pattern for. Something like \"meta\": { \"generator\": \"^Contao Open Source CMS$\" },.\n. One question by the way, how long will it usually take before statistics are shown for an application newly added to Wappalyzer.com? (And one small remark: it would be nice if both extensions were updated at the same time; this also prevents the stats from being off because the Chrome extension is feeding data whilst the Firefox extension isn't, or the other way around. And it would in any case (this is not a problem right now, but I've seen it in the past) be a good idea, in my opinion, to update the web site if either of the extensions is updated so that the page isn't missing when you click on a newly added application in the results list.)\n. When trying it again at a different computer, it only appeared after several tries. I pulled the latest version from GitHub and reloaded the Chrome extension several times before I got the described result for the first web site:\n\nAlso, the version (Universal Analytics) does not appear at the second web site.\nEdit: Here is the console log: https://gist.github.com/q--/931a85c334f0c79ccee7\nAlmost forgot: I'm using an extension to block trackers such as Google Analytics. Allowing GA on commonjs.org does not make any difference, nor does it change how it appears on LionLamb.net.\n. The syntax example at the wiki does not have a  at the end. So, I still think it's a bug.\n. Solved in #558. Thanks, @gadcam, for pointing me in the right direction.\n. According to https://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/pull/645#issuecomment-51554542, this is still a problem in the latest version.\n@TemaSM, just to be completely certain: are you experiencing this with the Chrome extension loaded through \"load unpacked extension\", up to date with the latest commits from this GitHub repository?\n. Looks good, but if both Railo and Adobe ColdFusion set those cookies it may be better to move those patterns to the CFML rules.\n(See also #445.)\n. That line is probably a remainder from the old detection code, which fetched the headers only after clicking a button. The new code makes use of Chrome's webRequest API and starts at this line\nEdit: I actually meant to post this comment for issue #564.\n. To submit a pull request, go to your fork and click the  button.\n. After downloading the extension, the zipped extension contains an unusual folder: _metadata.\nAnother extension I downloaded to see if it was added by the Chrome Web store did not have this folder.\nInside of this folder is a file with the name verified_contents.json, with the following contents: https://gist.github.com/q--/e81236cc3253c4a6e223/aabd58a6c511499e24e27eec61d0b5d6d1086d17.\nFormatted for better readability:\nhttps://gist.github.com/q--/e81236cc3253c4a6e223/5dc39eabf9cc192906b2126578ae855d51e59744\nThe long text strings are base64-encoded and contain more JSON.\n. I see this sometimes as well. Right now, for example, this window doesn't have the Wappalyzer icon. Another window does, but when I click the  of that window (which are correct for that page) it opens up the results for this GitHub page instead\u2026\n\n. Image size reduced to 373 bytes:\n\n. Optimized icon:\n\n. \\\\;version:\\\\1 is missing at the end. Are you aware this is stripped of before the pattern is parsed as a RegEx by Wappalyzer and used to determine where to look for a version string?\n. With the pattern Ophal ?(.*) \\\\(ophal.org\\\\)\\\\;version:\\\\1, the actual RegEx being passed to exec would be:\nParsing:\nnew RegExp(\"Ophal ?(.*) \\\\(ophal.org\\\\)\\\\;version:\\\\1\".split('\\\\;')[0], \"i\")\nResulting RegExp:\n/Ophal ?(.*) \\(ophal.org\\)/i\nThis is the regular expression Wappalyzer would use.\nIt looks like it would work. Personally, I might have done it as Ophal(?: (.*))? \\(ophal.org\\). The difference is that the space between Ophal and the version string isn't optional in this RegEx.\n. You broke stuff:\n- The implies for Lua is gone. Why?\n- The JSON can no longer be parsed because of a stray ,\nDon't worry, I'm working on a fix.\n. Applications aren't added to the website automatically once they are in the GitHub repository. @ElbertF said some time ago in response to a different issue he needs to run an importing tool manually.\nBy the way, @ElbertF, a lot of applications that were added a long time ago (e.g. prettyPhoto) still don't show any statistics. If I remember it well, you said it'd only take a few weeks. Is there a problem or am I just not patient enough?\n. The name has been updated, but Wappalyzer.com is still showing the old URL. I've opened issue #589 for this.\n. Just a guess: for some reason, it may be required to restart Firefox before Wappalyzer starts to work if you switch between the button and the address bar. (I'm only guessing.)\n. This should have been fixed in #558. @ElbertF, has a new version of Wappalyzer been released since then or is the issue still present in the current version?\n. Using this bookmarklet, I\u201dve found 9 global variables (probably) set by the script at this page.\n__googleVisualizationAbstractRendererElementsCount__: Object\n__gvizguard__: Object\ndrawVisualization: Object\ngoogle: Object\ngoogleLT_: Object\ngoogle_exportProperty: Object\ngoogle_exportSymbol: Object\ngviz: Object\nvis: Object\n. If you haven't pushed your changes yet, its often better to add related changes to the last commit using git commit --amend instead of creating a new commit for each correction of your (local) changes.\n. > I removed \"implies: Lua\" because of lack of understanding how it works, but should be there actually.\nIt tells Wappalyzer that the presence of this application means another application is also used.\n\nThanks for fixing it!\n\nYou're welcome\n\nAnd good catch with the \",\"!\n\nActually, I found it because I was trying to add another app and couldn't figure out why the JSON wasn't valid\u2026\n\nBTW, it looks like detection is working somehow: install the browser plugin and visit ophal.org\n\nThe Ophal pattern was already included, you only added a few extra rules and version detection.\n. Are sure it implies both OpenLayers and Leaflet at the same time? If it implies one of those each time but not both, the implies is better left off. (Although, to my knowledge, @ElbertF has never stated this explicitly.)\n. I borrowed them from the jQuery pattern. I guess I could have just detected xregexp.js, but this one allows version detection for at least the CDNJS version.\nI also see now that one of the capture groups (the one around \\.min) should have been non-capturing (the jQuery pattern gets this wrong as well). I may fix this in a later pull request.\n. Duplicate of #586\n. Fixed, thanks.\n. Actually, Wappalyzer does use the rendered HTML, but it fetches it only once (probably on page load) and doesn't run again after that for the same page.\nSee this test, which will dynamically write a jQuery embed to the document.\n. I guess the code you posted for detection is missing. In Markdown, code needs to be indented with 4 spaces / 1 tab and preceded by an empty line.\n. Are you using the latest version from GitHub? Issue #558 should fix the Google Analytics problem without breaking the detection of Universal Analytics.\n. Oops, this actually won't work as expected because the version number isn't matched when PMA_sendHeaderLocation( is present in the HTML. I need to fix this, sorry.\n. I've fixed it and also improved the env pattern (which was missing ^ and $).\n. @ElbertF I assume your last comment was meant for #656?\n. The console for background.html shows\n\n[wappalyzer debug] apps.json not loaded, check for syntax errors\n\nYou can go to %localappdata%\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Extensions\\gppongmhjkpfnbhagpmjfkannfbllamg\\2.33_0 on Windows to display the extension contents.\nJSONLint finds the following error:\n\nParse error on line 3729:\n...                   },        \"PANSITE\"\n----------------------^\nExpecting 'STRING'\n\nOne comma too much.\nIf you replace the contents of apps.json with this file, Wappalyzer will work again.\nHowever, you will first have to disable and then re-enable the extension at chrome://extensions/?id=gppongmhjkpfnbhagpmjfkannfbllamg.\n. By the way, the apps at Wappalyzer.com haven't been updated yet.\n. I meant not all apps added in the add-on update have shown up on the website.\nWhen I'm not getting this error, I can see that OWA is not present in the list of Web Mail apps for example.\n. Wappalyzer detects the version of Wordpress by looking for a <meta name=\"generator\" content=\"Wordpress \u00abversion\u00bb\"> tag.\nThe WPML plug-in used at your site replaces that tag with:\n\n<meta name=\"generator\" content=\"WPML ver:3.1.5 stt:1;0\" />\n. @gadcam I've used your suggestions. Out of curiosity, what page with an Adcash ad on it did you find? \n\nAnd how did you find it? I usually go to sites like W3Techs and BuiltWith and check the example sites using a technology to find out how to detect it; I wonder how you're doing it.\n. At the home page of that site, I found a few other variables for Adcash:\nac_back_changebgcolor\nac_back_followscroll\nac_back_zindex\nac_content_width\nI may add these as well.\n. @ElbertF That's for URL decoding. This is HTML. I'll give an example to clarify.\nExample\nWeb page source:\n<script src=\"http://www.example.com?foo=bar&amp;bar=foo\"></script>\nWhat Wappalyzer tries to analyze:\nhttp://www.example.com?foo=bar&amp;bar=foo\nWhat Firefox tries to load:\nhttp://www.example.com?foo=bar&bar=foo\nNote the encoding of & as &amp;.\nURL encoding is something not directly related to this, where e.g. & becomes %26 when encoded.\n. Regarding the server-side, searching for a Python solution brings up an easy solution. This is not different for PHP and the other languages either, I guess.\n. @gatcam HTML is supposed to be encoded as HTML, it shouldn't be necessary to change things there. As for the meta tags, well, perhaps; it kind of depends on how the current patterns are written. If I remember things well, the <meta tag values were being extracted from the HTML using a regular expression since I first looked at how Wappalyzer was dealing with this years ago; however, In version 2.x (on Firefox) the script URLs weren't.\n. It may be related to this issue: Chromium  Issue 399251:   Content verification handles 0-length files incorrectly.\nAnyway, it appears Google decided to start looking for suspicious patterns in extensions. Perhaps it would be a good idea to file an issue with the Chromium developers.\n. @TeamUpDevelopment perhaps that's because CMSMS doesn't re-send the cookie if it's already set (just a guess)?\n. The Google Closure compiler generates JavaScript with all variable names replaced by sequences of chacaracters that are are as short as possible. If there are lots of variables, it will start generating 4-character names.\nBecause this doesn't occur frequently (though it occurs at some high-profile web sites), a certainty of 50% for this rule seems okay to me.\nPerhaps hard-coded exceptions for certain web sites could be built into the extension, but I'm not sure it's worth it.\n. I don't think that will help here, as Closure Compiler generates variable names with A-Z, a-z and $.\n. Wappalyzer can only detect an application when there are indications a website is using it. In the case of FreeBSD, it tries to detect FreeBSD in the Server header.\nServers may be configured not to send this information.\n. Hmm, looks like my RegEx has fallen prey to catastrophic backtracking.\nThe regex you propose would match plain text and be not such a good idea for that reason.\n. Somebody should probably add the programming language C++ to Wappalyzer as well.\n. Perhaps Travis CI can be used for automatic tests? I've seen it in use by a\nnumber of other projects.\nRegarding the 0-9 vs \\d thing, note that whilst in JavaScript both will\nmatch the same, in some other programming languages it will match digits in\nother scripts (e.g. Armenian) as well. (It's just a small difference, but I\nprefer [0-9] because of it.)\nIn my opinion, when sorting the list the short form should take precedence.\nThat's how my (and probably almost every other) dictionary sorts words as\nwell.\n. Perhaps .+ could better be turned into .. After all, in contrast with \"\" and .* this checks the value is non-empty.\n. Maybe Symfony should be added as well. Unless I've missed something, it hadn't been added yet because it couldn't be detected, but if this application uses most or all of Symfony (and not just a few classes, which some tools such as Drupal are doing) Symfony could be added, and an implies rule could be added to Thelia.\n. Duplicate of #478\n. First I'd like to make sure this is a false positive. If it is, I also want\nto know what pattern is causing it.\nCan you first, at a page where you encounter the problem, run the following\nscript in the console and report back what variable names it detects?\n(function(w,i){for(i in w) console.log(i)})(window)\nAlso, if you have AdBlock plus, can you open the blockable components panel\n(Ctrl + Shift + V), sort by type and copy all entries for \"script\"?\n2015-01-09 17:23 GMT+01:00 Fonger notifications@github.com:\n\nOnly personal pages are affected. For example,\nhttps://www.facebook.com/zuck?fref=nf\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/issues/762#issuecomment-69357412.\n. Thanks. Vue is not on that list, so it seems the problem is with one of the script detection patterns (probably the one @gadcam mentioned) and that Facebook indeed isn't using Vue.\n. I think it would be best to give the broad pattern for Vue.js a lower confidence.\n. @m0sth8 And how are we going to find the comments\u2026?\n\nFor the DOM, there are ways to get the HTML comments. But I don't know if the browser offers an interface to access CSS / JS comments directly.\nBut if we can do this asynchronous, without performance degradation, I'm all for it.\n. The environment variable is too short to have 100% confidence when matching. Such short variables can exist in compiled source code such as that generated by the Google Closure Compiler.\nFor example, I can see a function named Rx at docs.google.com.\n. @toastal Google Docs does indeed have (global) variables with these characters.\n. I added something to the Wiki: https://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/wiki/Specification#hints--pitfalls\nBy the way, @ElbertF, was the confidence threshold ever implemented? (E.g. that applications with a confidence lower than X are hidden from the list.) I'm asking this because I see that RxJS adds two other (quite generic-sounding) environment variables which could used to reduce false positives.\n. By the way, I choose to match the entire header contents because I took the -4321 part to be a build identifier. Is this assumption correct? Is it desirable to show this information?\n. Looks like Wappalyzer.com is still using old data; it's missing e.g. SquirrelMail.\n. It's triggered by this pattern: https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/apps.json#L3292\n. Backslashes need to be escaped in JSON.\nYou can get a valid JSON escaped regex with this piece of JavaScript and your browser console:\nprompt(\"Copy valid JSON string:\", JSON.stringify(  /^foo\\s+bar$/i .source ));\nWhere /^foo\\s+bar/i should be your regex.\n. Also, some groups can be made non-capturing.\n. Looks like HubPress is trying to be compatible with Ghost, at least to some degree: https://github.com/HubPress/hubpress.io/issues/55\n. It also appears to set a global variable semantic. (I only tested at semantic-ui.com, though.)\n. Wappalyzer is currently not able to do this.\n2015-04-28 17:22 GMT+02:00 eduardosainz notifications@github.com:\n\nHi, there is some method to search a class/id of an external css ?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/issues/851.\n.

Since the same issue applies to me, I installed Wappalyzer through the SDK. The icon wasn't showing there either.

I removed a lowercase version of Penguin.png in #1023. I'm not entirely sure how I fixed things, but you could try something like the following:\n1. Checkout your branch patch-http2.\n2. Make a copy of Penguin.png  elsewhere.\n3. git rm both the lowercase and uppercase Penguin.png.\n4. git commit -m Msg\n5. Move the copy of Penguin.png back. Make sure the name starts with an uppercase P!\n6. git add Penguin.png\n7. git commit --amend\n8. Checkout your master branch.\n9. git pull origin master\n10. Checkout your branch patch-http2.\n11. git rebase master. Note that you will have to merge some conflicting changes manually.\n12. If everything worked out, you can now git push -f origin patch-http2.\n\nThis assumes you have no uncommitted changes for indexed files. If you do, run git stash save before step 3 and git stash pop after rebasing.\nCreate a copy of your git folder first in case something goes wrong!\nAlso, please note that this works only because I removed penguin.png (with a lowercase p) in an earlier commit.\nMerging manually (step 11) can be challenging if you've never done it before. Let me know if you need help with that.\n. As far as I'm aware Wappalyzer doesn't insert a script called ad.js. Check\nif the error still occurs if you disable Wappalyzer.

Then, you can run wappalyzer-validate from inside the bin folder.\n. Are you sure the Theila version matching the patterns you removed is in use nowhere?\n. The Python version only analyses the headers, URL and static HTML. The browser extensions will also analyze JavaScript variables and things added to the DOM dynamically. I believe the PhantomJS version will do this as well.\n. I added the icon.\n. Hi @siparker,\n\nThe way this works under the hood is that Wappalyzer will insert a \\ before every / that hasn't been escaped. So essentially, both / and \\/ will work, though just / is preferred because it's easier to read and write.\n. I learned regular expressions mostly from the tutorials at www.regular-expressions.info.\nFor finding environment variables, I'm using this bookmarklet. (Direct link to the bookmarklet.)\nAlso, for testing your regular expression there are various tools available online.\nFor the final step of JSON-encoding the regular expression, I usually use a little bit of JavaScript such as this:\nprompt(\"\",JSON.stringify(prompt()))\nBut there are also various websites available online that can JSON-encode your data.\n. The offending file (not included in the Wappalyzer source on GitHub, so I pasted it in a Gist) is iframe.js.\nAfter downloading the Chrome extension, I also noticed Wappalyzer is not in compliance with the GPL because it does not include a copy of the license with the extension nor does it mention all of its contents are GPL licensed. (Only the file wappalyzer.js includes a mention of the license, which is not enough for the GPL.) When grep-ing around, I noticed it is also violating the BSD license because the file widgets.css is licensed under the BSD-license but the license has not been included, even though the license clearly says so.\n(Actually, unless I'm mistaken Wappalyzer strictly hasn't been in compliance with the GPL for much longer because it doesn't list all copyright holders (which is everyone who has ever contributed code that is still part of Wappalyzer or upon which current parts of Wappalyzer have been based) in the source code. I didn't bring this up earlier because attribution in the code itself isn't really important to me, at least in this case.)\nYou might want to fix these things. (Disclaimer: IANAL and it's been a while since I checked the GPL, this comment is not legal advice.)\nAlso, you could use https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/URL instead of creating an anchor element in your code.\nEdit: less strongly worded.\n. It's because quite some time ago, as I understand it, somebody renamed penguin.png to Penguin.png, did a git add for Penguin.png but neglected to do a git rm for penguin.png. As the result of this, git is now tracking both penguin.png and Penguin.png. This is causing problems on case-insensitive file systems, such as those used by Windows. (Also, the person who did this should have used git mv instead.)\nSee https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/pull/1002#issuecomment-169600047.\n(By \"git is now tracking\" I mean in your fork. I fixed this for AliasIO/Wappalyzer.)\n. Also, this bug is a duplicate of  #1068\n. Are you sure the change to the GA pattern is even necessary?\n. Simple testing (using the code below) shows that the first two are matched. As for the last one, I\u2019d argue it\u2019s the responsibility of Wappalyzer to make sure the patterns are matched against the full URL. So if Wappalyzer doesn\u2019t handle protocol-relative URLs correctly, that\u2019s a bug in Wappalyzer and if you\u2019re sure that\u2019s the case, you may want to file an issue for that.\n\"https://ssl.google-analytics.com/ga.js\".match(new RegExp(\"^https?://[^\\\\/]+\\\\.google-analytics\\\\.com\\\\/(?:ga|urchin|(analytics))\\\\.js\"))\n. There used to be some code in Wappalyzer that checks if the web page is an\n(X)HTML document before running any analysis. (Which is actually a bit\nweird, since scanning headers works fine for any other content as well.)\n2016-03-15 20:11 GMT+01:00 Gregory Netsas notifications@github.com:\n\nJust to test and confirm on various OSes and browsers.

This applies to any site with a restrictive CSP, including, for example, GitHub.. I built a minimal test case to see if the problem was with Wappalyzer or with svg2png-many (which Wappalyzer uses for conversion). From my testing, it works correctly if you don't specify a width or height, but it will crop the image to the top left corner if you do.\n\nMy test: https://github.com/q--/svg2png-test\nSo if this works correctly for other icons, it's probably a bug in the svg2png-many module (as opposed to a feature).. I corrected the spelling in your example, but I'm not getting an ef.js detection; the extension doesn't detect anything for me, and the bookmarklet gives only CloudFlare, HTTP/2 and Nginx.\nI see a potential for false detections though, because one of its detection rules is looking for a variable named ef, which is so short that it'll likely be among the variable names generated by the Google Closure Compiler (which can optimize JavaScript by replacing JavaScript variable and function names with the shortest variable name available, so MyFunction becomes a, MyNextFunction becomes  b etc.).\nStill, that doesn't yield any clues as to why you're seeing ef.js detected for a text file.. Hmm, I see a lot of popular websites in the  list - Twitter, Reddit, VK, YouTube etc. I guess there's people with a hijacked web browser polluting the results.\nI wonder if there's a way we could filter those out?. @jvoisin Could be, but I don't see any obvious errors in my code. Stories like this one make me suspect that it's browser extensions injecting CoinHive into web pages.\n@AliasIO I suppose you could make a list of websites which you know don't have CoinHive on them and if it gets reported on that website anyway, ignore CoinHive reports from that IP address.\nOf course that's not bulletproof, because it won't remove CoinHive reports that were sent before the IP got blacklisted, people using multiple IP addresses etc. And IP addresses could get reassigned to somebody else who isn't infected.\nAnd then there's the risk that a website you 'know' won't have CoinHive on it gets hacked to serve the script.\nAssigning each Wappalyzer install an unique identifier and sending it with the reports could take care of the \"IP addresses get reassigned\" problem if the false reports aren't malicious, and temporary storing the identifier with reports so you can remove old reports of CoinHive if a client sends in a known false detection could take care of the other problems - but with the obvious privacy implications, and the overhead of storing the extra data.\nBut if my suspicion is correct and the CoinHive script gets injected into every web page, that means it will also be injected in the \"Wappalyzer has been upgraded\" page. If people haven't disabled the option to show that page, you would probably be able to detect at least some of the false reports early.. Seems like this isn't the only false positive either; the top result on the Now  Wappalyzer.com page is keepvid.com, which sends the header Server: Tengine/unknown. It appears something went wrong when you inserted the CSS\n\n. @AliasIO Looks like you haven't pushed the fix yet?\n\n. Check yields quite a long list of patterns with unescaped dots, only a few might be legitimate. Don't have time to check/fix them all right now.\n```\nSuspicious period (\".\") in pattern.

I just became aware of the fact that the Google Closure compiler is part of a bigger toolset, so now I'm not sure anymore if the variables I'm detecting are actually part of the Closure Compiler or if they're set by one of the other Closure tools, such as the Closure Library (which is a prime suspect for me).\nFor reference, if anyone else wants to give figuring this out a shot, the variable names I'm seeing are:\nclosure_uid_<number>\nand\nclosure_lm_<number>\n\ne.g.\nclosure_uid_579667508\nclosure_lm_262899\n\nThese can be found at e.g. Google Maps\nI haven't managed to have the Closure Compiler generate JavaScript that contains either of the above, so it's quite likely the variables aren't from the Compiler.. Relevant:  #132\n\nThe category is really meant for CDNs that serve an entire site (like Cloudflare does). Anyone can embed an image hosted by Akamai or Amazon S3 but that's not particularly interesting.\n\n(Personally, I think it might be a good idea to create a category, say \"Resource CDN\" or something, for when a CDN is used for content in the page instead of or in addition to the serving the page itself.)\nAlso, I think the main stuff detected by your rule would be CDNJS? In that case, it might be better to turn this into a rule named CDNJS and only detect cdnjs.cloudflare.com and cdnjs.com.\nOther stuff we could detect:\najax.googleapis.com\ncode.jquery.com\nWhatever Microsoft's CDN was called again. A few remarks:\n\nGitHub is spelled with a capital G and H. (You should probably also use the correct capitalization for the icon file name.)\nThe GitHub logo you have used looks a bit weird at full resolution, it would probably be better to use a vector graphic instead. (You can find the official GitHub logo here and there are plenty of online converters available which can turn an EPS file in to an SVG image. Because I was at it anyway, I created an SVG from the official EPS myself. (Took a little editing afterwards in Inkscape to get only the relevant icon out of it.) You can download it here.\n\n(Also, I personally prefer to use a more strict URL pattern. I'd probably have written the url pattern as ^https?://[^/]+\\\\.github\\\\.io/, both to prevent matching websites that have the domain I'm trying to match in the URL at some other place (e.g., your pattern would match https://web.archive.org/web/*/facebook.github.io/react-native), and because a more strict pattern means the regex engine will be able to stop looking for a match early after seeing the URL doesn't start with http(s)://pages.github.io/ instead of being forced to inspect the entire string to look for a match, which means a slight  improvement in performance.). @ElbertF That should be ImpressPages(?:CMS)?( [\\\\d.]*)\\\\;version:\\\\1\n. If the header contains version information, how about using\n\"headers\": { \"X-KoobooCMS-Version\": \"(.*)\\\\;version:\\\\1\" },\n. This may be a bit too broad; for example, it would match a link like this:\n<a href=\"http://wappalyzer.com/applications/Kooboo\">\nAlso, if it's just one pattern you don't have to put it inside an array.\n. The Umbraco pattern could be improved as well, then.\n. =\"/Kooboo\" is better, but still somewhat broad.\nAre you sure it is needed in the first place?\nIf necessary, it could be altered to match only certain tags.\nFor example, \n<link rel=\"Stylesheet\" href=\"/Kooboo-WebResource/Index/jQuery-Styles/20130227\" type=\"text/css\" />\ncould be matched with:\n\"html\": \"<link [^>]+/Kooboo-WebResource/\",\n(I removed the [ and ] around the pattern because, since it's a single pattern, an array is not necessary.)\nSince, looking at other sites than Kooboo's own using their CMS, Resource instead of WebResource is very common, I think the following would be a good pattern:\n\"html\": \"<link [^>]+/Kooboo-(?:Web)?Resource/\",\n. Thanks, fixed.\n. I tried to detect the version there, but I seem to have forgotten to add \\\\;version. The ? will make the * lazy so ([\\\\d.]+) will capture the entire version.\n. Don't worry, at least you helped me notice that I forgot the \\\\;version.\nMore info on greedyness and lazyness at http://www.regular-expressions.info/repeat.html\n. @AliasIO https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/apps.json#L4135\n&plus signs have been pasted in at the beginning of each line.\n.

Why should Wappalyzer stop detecting the NGINX version?\n. @siparker You can see if an environment variable is present simply by typing its name into your  browser console. If it's autocompleted, then the variable is present. If it isn't, then the variable is not present but you'll still want to make sure that the variable is present nowhere, even in older versions and/or on different pages. Also, Wappalyzer patterns are case-insensitive but variable names are!\n\nAnd as a rule of a thumb: don't remove detection patterns unless you're absolutely, positively sure it does not manage to detect a single version of the targeted application (even if that version was deprecated several years ago) or if you've written a replacement rule that detects the same property better\n. @adibalcan The version is still shown for version 1.9.8 at http://nginx.org/. Also, as @gadcam pointed out, your change doesn't improve detection; ? after the group makes it optional. Furthermore, even if a current version of the application doesn't reveal the version number, that's still no reason to kill version detection for older versions.\n. You fixed the Medium pattern but missed  the Reddit pattern. I think this needs to stay. IIRC, Microsoft IIS will send this header if ASP.NET is installed (by default if you use IIS, I think) even ASP.NET isn't actually used..

    "nickdaugherty": "@gadcam is right...this would need to be added incrementally, as feasible. An idea - what if the detection patterns were left untouched, and a second pass was added to detect version, once the software was identified? That way, the rules don't have to change and there isn't significant architecture changes.\nSo workflow would be something like...\n1. Detect software using existing patterns\n2. Ok, I detected x, y, z software\n3. Loop over x, y, z, and run version detection patterns for each (if available)\n4. Report any detect versions of x, y, z\n. What if the version detection was defined as a function? This could account for any number of complicated version structures. Instead of many hard-coded version patterns, like, jQuery 1.3.0, 1.3.1, 1.3.2, etc., you could have a callback that simply returned the version, or false if it wasn't detected.\nSo the above would become something like:\n``` javascript\n'Drupal': {\n    cats: [ 1 ],\n    version: function(page){\n       var regExp = /Drupal 7/g;\n   if(regExp.test(page.headers['X-Generator']) (\n        return 7;\n   }\n\n   // Some other logic to attempt a Drupal 5 or 6 detection\n\n    // Could not detect, return false\n    return false;\n},\nimplies: [ 'PHP' ]\n\n}\n```\nOr get jquery version (regex probably doesn't work but you get the idea):\n``` javascript\n'jQuery': {\n    version: function(page){\n       var regExp = /jquery\\/(\\d+.\\d+.\\d+)/jquery.min.js/g;\n   var result = regExp.test(page.html);\n\n  if(result){\n     return result;\n  }\n\n   // Some other logic to attempt a detection if above failed\n   //....code here....//\n\n    // Could not detect, return false\n    return false;\n}\n\n}\n```\n. I'd disagree that the major version is more interesting. On Drupal, yes it is. But in all kinds of software, there are many 'minor' version and fewer major versions, and the minors can be significantly different. For example, Magento, PHP, jQuery, they all have minor versions which are considered unique versions.\nKnowing if a site is using PHP 5.2, 5.3, or 5.4 is very important; all have very different characteristics. Likewise, knowing if it is using jQuery 1.3.2 or 1.8.1 is equally interesting. In all cases, the major version is the same. It's not all that useful to know the site is using jQuery 1 or Magento 1. \n. The complexities of version detection lead me to think a function is needed, or at least it should be an option. The best of both worlds may be to allow simple RegEx detection, but also allow a function in place of a RegEx, so complex version detection can be completed. \nI'm trying to account for situations where the rules of version detection change dramatically. For example, to detect Drupal 7, you look at the header, to detect Drupal 6 you look at X, Y, and maybe Z, but only if Y was true. This kind of flexibility will be needed on certain applications. \nA callback is better than defining multiple versions of the app as unique app entries (as proposed by @ElbertF above with Drupal 7), because you can handle differences in minor and revision number detection (say you needed to detect PHP 5.2 and PHP 5.3 very differently) and the app remains 'Drupal' logically in code and elsewhere (would be better to have it saved as 'Drupal' with versions rather than 'Drupal 6', 'Drupal 7', etc, for the wappalyzer.com stats).\n. ",
    "FarSeeing": "Version detection of JS libraries (as the detection itself) can be significantly simplified, if using functions instead of regexps:\njavascript\n// inside apps\n'jQuery': {\n  cats: [ 12 ],\n  env: function(){ return window.jQuery && typeof window.jQuery === 'function' },\n  version: {\n    env: function(){ return window.jQuery.fn.jquery }\n  }\nWhy not?\n. Oh, that's a trap.\n. ",
    "mintystark": "Is it possible that you could add something simple for developers that want to work with you.\nLike a Header\nX-Wappalyzer = [MyRegisteredAppName],[Version_Number]\nThis can even be used for other details.\nX-Wappalyzer = [MyRegisteredAppName],[MyAppType],[Version_Number],[MyAppImage],[MyAppWebsite]\nIt would be best if the value was JSON.\nFor Security the App would have to be pre-registered through you, but this way it reduces the management from you.\nYou could still have all the custom filter, but at least there would be something in place for developers who are willing to work with you.\nThanks\n. Ah I see, for some reason I though that Headers had to be unique, but I guess not.\nSo you are thinking of having something like \nX-Powered-By: {\"name\":\"AppName\",\"type\":\"cms\",\"version\":\"2.5\",\"icon\":\"http://www.site.com/favicon.ico\",\"website\":\"http://www.site.com\"}\nYou probably don't need the quotes, but either way this would be very easy.\nAll I know is having a Version Number would be very helpful.\nThanks\n. Awesome, Thanks\n. ",
    "SebastianLopienski": "I'm joining this thread quite late, but have actually thought about this topic a bit. I'm developing a Python port of Wappalizer, to be used in my organization, and we really do want to know version numbers - at least if they are mentioned explicitly (e.g. X-Generator: Drupal 7; src=query-1.7.2.js etc.). Detecting version numbers for apps that don't expose them would also be nice, but is less of a priority. (And it requires more work to create and maintain patterns.)\nOut of the ideas how to add version detection to apps.json that various people proposed above, personally I strongly prefer the simple one proposed by @ElbertF: \njavascript\n\"headers\": { \"X-Powered-By\": \"Drupal ([0-9]+)\\;version=$1\" }\nI really like this approach because the pattern file doesn't grow and is still maintainable (no duplicated patterns); existing patterns can be extended relatively easily; existing code using those patterns can be adapted trivially; and regular expressions are still powerful enough to accommodate most cases. \nIf multiple regexps are needed e.g. for a given header, then indeed going for an array/list is a good idea:\njavascript\n\"headers\": { \"X-Powered-By\": [ \"(Foo)\\;version=$1?1:\", \"(Bar)\\;version=$1?2:\" ] }\n.. but then, for consistence, I would tend to make all regexps (even single) an array of strings rather than strings:\njavascript\n\"headers\": { \"X-Powered-By\": [ \"Drupal ([0-9]+)\\;version=$1\" ] }\nAlso, as @user1113 commented, version numbers should be optional:\njavascript\n\"headers\": { \"X-Powered-By\": [ \"Drupal( [0-9]+)?\\;version=$1\" ] }\nWhat do you think?\nBTW, as for individual confidence levels, indeed this makes things more complex. Is it really needed/useful?\n. @gadcam - thx! :-)\n. Concerning conflicting version numbers - I'd simply report both/all (if they are different, not a prefix of one another, and both are detected). In fact, that's what my Python code already does (as is it prepared for handling version - it just misses detecting them ;-). \nFor example:\nPHP 5\nPHP <null>    # no version detected\nPHP 5.4\nbecomes\nPHP 5.4\nAnd:\nApache 2 (beta)\nApache 2.2\ncannot be merged following this logic, so both entries for Apache would be reported.\nIn my use case, I prefer to report more, as there is value in this info. But of course up to you how to handle this in the browser plugin...\nI like the idea of this extendible syntax - powerful if needed in the future, and easy to handle now. \n. Displaying multiple versions can indeed be confusing for an average end user (although makes perfect sense in my context). Then maybe displaying combined (concatenated) results, e.g. \"Apache 2 (beta) / 2.2 ?\"... (Well, Apache is a stupid example, but you get the idea.). Or use 'confidence' tag to decide which version should be presented? Or actually implement and deploy version detection; see what conflicting version numbers we get, for which apps/technologies and why; and then decide how to deal with it (e.g fine-tune regexps).\nConcerning the syntax, has a(ny) decision been taken? If yes, I will start implementing it on my Python side, and also start populating version-related patterns, at least for technologies that I see at my place - so that it could be used by Wappalizer itself and other ports. \nWish you good holidays!\n. Hi everyone, I was silent for the last 2 weeks, but actually working on this. Here's (a beta version of) my Python port: \nhttps://github.com/SebastianLopienski/WAD\nAnd the modified apps.json file with version detection and some new entries:\nhttps://github.com/SebastianLopienski/WAD/blob/master/etc/apps.json\nChanges from the original apps.json: fbf92ff4d96ff3430b1e9a162da52c751dbc8cb7\nAs you see, it contains:\n- new apps: Amaya, CMSimple, JAlbum, JavaServer Faces, JavaServer Pages, Java Servlet, KineticJS, mod_, OpenGrok, OpenSSL, Oracle Application Server, Sarka-SPIP, Supersized, SUSE, Scientific Linux. If they are accepted and taken upstream by @ElbertF, I can provide icons and URLs (if needed?).\n- a new category \"web-server-extension\", referenced by new \"mod_\" apps. At least for my use case it is very interesting to detect server-side modules...\n- a new key \"scripts\" (not to be confused with \"script\"), which is simply an array of regular expression used exactly the same way as all existing \"script\" regular expressions. (I explain below why it was needed)\n- and last but not least, version detection for a number of entries.\nConcerning version detection, so far I adopted the following format:\njavascript\n\"meta\": { \"generator\": \"WordPress( [\\\\d\\\\.]+)?\\\\;version:\\\\1\" },\nwhich is very similar to what @ElbertF proposed before. I changes $1 to \\1 to follow the usual regular expression expansion syntax. \nIn a few cases, I went beyond a simple \"version:\\1\", and was using regular expression expanding. For example, in\nmaps.google.com/maps?file=api&ver=2\nnumber 2 is a version number of the API, and not of Google Maps in general. And thanks to \nversion:API v\\\\3\"\nit expands to version \"API v2\". Another example is version detection for MoinMoin, where moin_static513/common/js/common.js is detected as MoinMoin, version 5.1.3 (note the dots between digits). Using Python's re.MatchObject.expand() method was very convenient here - but I'm not sure if you get the same functionality in JavaScript, and if not - whether you decide to keep this feature&syntax upstream?\nNow, why did I add a \"scripts\" array? Because for example jQuery version can be either part of the file name, or the directory structure:\n1.7.4/jquery.min.js\njquery-1.7.4.js\nand I don't see how a single \"regular_expression\\;version:expansion_template\" could correctly detect version number in both cases. (But maybe I'm wrong??)\nWhen adding version detection to existing regular expressions, I took care not to modify their logic, but rather make version detection \"optional\". There are some other tricks when adding version detection - see my inline notes in fbf92ff4d96ff3430b1e9a162da52c751dbc8cb7. \nSo, what do you think of all this? I'm open for comments and suggestions, and of course very much interested to get version detection - in this syntax or any other that we agree upon - upstream to Wappalyzer.\n. Icons and URLs provided in #215.\nWhat do you mean by \"please provide ... categories\"?\n. It's great to see version detection live! Thank you!\n. Yes, I plan to publish my Python code on GitHub, if you think it's useful. \nHope the merge of apps.json will work.\n. Great - this is my first accepted pull request on GitHub :-)\nI'm aware of @ebradbury Python port, looks nice and simple. I decided to develop something new, though - for various reasons (e.g. I don't want to parse HTML as @ebradbury does). This will be a part of a bigger system to monitor web landscape in a large organization (which actually happens to be the place where the Web was born ;-) with decentralized web developments&deployments. We basically need something like nmap for the web. Once finished, I will publish mine and let you know. \nAs a side note: have you ever thought about detecting not only web apps/technologies, but also their versions? I'm currently looking into it. Regexps would need to be extended (and search logic slightly modified), so it's quite some work, although some would be easy, e.g. \"IIS\" would become something like \"IIS(/[0-9.]+)?\". I may need to go this way, at least for some apps/technologies. What do you think?\n(Not sure if this topic should be discussed here under pull request - but didn't find a place in GitHub to start a project-related discussion, like a forum or something...)\n. Thx @q-- !\n. Very happy to hear that! :-)\n. For the record, here's a beta version of my Python port: https://github.com/SebastianLopienski/WAD\n. Welcome!\n. Welcome ;-) \nI'm currently working on my local copy of apps.json, adding dozens of new Web technologies that I observed at my workplace. And interestingly, I also added - in parallel to you - a category \"databases\". Which leads me to a question: is \"databases\" generic enough to also include structured storage/NoSQL solutions (Hadoop, CouchDB, HBase, MangoDB etc.etc.?)\nAnd, in general, if I'm about to propose 30-40 new technologies, do you prefer them combined in one single pull request? Grouped somehow? One by one (God, no!)? \nAre URLs and icons always necessary? (in several cases, notably of proprietary, embedded or lightweight web servers that come as part of a bigger product, it's hard to find a corresponding URL and icon).\nWhat about hardware such as printers, network devices, webcams, thermometers, ....? Should they fall into category 19 (\"misc\"), or a new category (\"hardware\" or \"device\"), or separate categories (\"printers\", \"webcams\", \"network-devices\")? (I'd go for separate categories)\nOK, enough questions :-) Please feel free to move this thread somewhere else if more appropriate. \n. Great - your answers match my preferences!\n. Not Christmas - but it's winter time in Australia, isn't it ;-)\n. The header response of the last URL (http://www.voeazul.com.br) says:\nServer: Apache-Coyote/1.1\nIndeed it probably doesn't mean that Tomcat's version is 1.1. \n. Indeed, well spotted. So I close this issue.\n. I can help with the pattern, but I don't know what logic it should represent. Or in other words: how to make Zurb detection rules more specific? \nDo you have at hand examples of site running Zurb? (wappalyzer.com is down at this moment)\n. @ElbertF FYI, Invenio is another software (like Indico) developed at CERN but used elsewhere. And @farzo works with me on this.\n. So apparently nothing has changed. I close this ticket, then.\n(Apologies for creating this new ticket rather than commenting on the existing #54)\n. Well, that's something. Detecting this will obviously work only on sites where the developer decided to use this function (so, many false negatives); and there may also be a few false positives. Still, worth adding to apps.json? I'd be inclined to say yes... \n. Added in #731 \n. Preparing... A small question: in https://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/wiki/Contributing#adding-a-new-category, what are \"preference pages\"?\n. Here you go: #731 \n. Thanks a lot @gadcam for reviewing my commits. Good to have a second pair of eyes looking at this!\nI'll try to respond to, or implement, the points you raise one by one. So, a few quick answers to start with:\n\nI think what you add as DAV is the apache module mod_dav see http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_dav.html\n\nI saw \"DAV\" in several \"Server\" header fields, but indeed always among Apache modules, e.g.:\nheader server: Apache/1.3.42 (Unix) mod_auth_pam/1.1.1 DAV/1.0.3 mod_ssl/2.8.31 OpenSSL/0.9.8g\nheader server: Apache/2.2.17 (Unix) mod_ssl/2.2.17 OpenSSL/0.9.7l DAV/2\nheader server: Apache/2.2.22 (Unix) mod_ssl/2.2.22 OpenSSL/1.0.0g DAV/2 PHP/5.3.10\nheader server: Apache/2.2.26 (Unix) DAV/2 mod_ssl/2.2.26 OpenSSL/0.9.8y\nheader server: Apache/2.2.29 (Unix) mod_fastcgi/2.4.6 mod_wsgi/3.4 Python/2.7.8 PHP/5.6.1 mod_ssl/2.2.29 OpenSSL/0.9.8za DAV/2 mod_perl/2.0.8 Perl/v5.20.0\nheader server: Apache/2.2.9 (Win32) DAV/2 mod_ssl/2.2.9 OpenSSL/0.9.8h mod_autoindex_color PHP/5.2.6\nAnd I never saw \"mod_dav\". Still, since I wasn't sure if \"DAV\" and \"mod_dav\" are the same thing here, I decided to define \"DAV\" as a separate app. Any (other) opinions?\n\nHappy ICS Server --> OmniTouch 8660 My Teamwork\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nAfter that just a question : how did you find DECORUM ? (there is no result when you search it on crwlr.net) I'm asking myself the same question for Happy ICS Server, HTTP-Server, Motion-httpd, RAID HTTPServer, Rapid Logic, .. are these software linked with a specific hardware or another software?\n\nWell, I just observed them live on our internal network. Which, granted, is large and very heterogeneous. In fact, I saw even more different \"Server\" header responses, but didn't include some if there were just a few such servers, or if I thought they were too obscure/rare. For the ones you mentioned, I saw multiple instances. And whenever I could find a link between the web server and the hardware behind, I added it (e.g. \"Schneider Web Server\" -> \"Schneider\" or \"JC-HTTPD\" -> \"Canon\").\n\nAs a last note if you can provide 32x32 png it is better see HP.\n\nWhenever I could get a 32x32 version of an icon of a given product or vendor, I did. But may still only have 16x16 versions on their websites. This unfortunately (and perhaps surprisingly) includes e.g. HP and Intel. As far as I see, many of the existing icons ate 16x16, so I though new ones will be still accepted?\n. Replying to the other points raised by @gadcam \n\n\nHTTP-Server pattern is too broad you need to change it to \\bHTTP-Server \nWappalyzer is case-insensitive at line 3110 so you don't need a-zA-Z you can \n  write a-z\nMotion-httpd --> http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/\nYou use non-capturing groups when not needed or you maybe forgot some ? \n  (L 316 - 1377 - 2657 - 3099)\nYou could change at line 2636 - 2657 (?:-| ) into [- ]\nYou use dots for.. dots I know it will work but I thing it's better to escape them for consistency (L 315 - 360 - 2846)\n\n\nDone, will commit and create a PR soon, thanks!\n\nYou use array when not needed (L 309 - 315 - 316 - 531 - 937 - 1378 - 1497 - 1577 \n- 1810 - 2559 - 3141 - 4158 - 4159)\n\nTrue. No strong reason behind; but I felt using arrays is more future-oriented. Any other opinions?\n\nYou use things like (\\d[\\d.]+) at lines 144 - 935 - 1355 - 1370 - 2636 :\nit can be justified but if you did not do that on purpose change them to ([\\d.]+) \n\nIn principle I did it on purpose, to correctly deal with such cases:\nmeta generator: muse.el                      # should not match \"Muse\"\nmeta generator: Discourse 1.1.0.beta1        # version 1.1.0\nmeta generator: gitweb/1.8.3.1.484.g21ff915  # version 1.8.3.1.484\n\nHTTP-Server pattern is too broad you need to change it to \\bHTTP-Server \n\nAdded. \n\nAnd as it you don't need anymore the patch at L2647, that won't be efficient \nwith a header like KM_HTTP-Server.\n\nI'm not sure if I get what you mean? BTW, a hyphen is a word boundary, so e.g. string \"Oracle-HTTP-Server\" still matches \"\\bHTTP-Server\". That's why app Oracle-HTTP-Server excludes app HTTP-Server.\n\nand then it seems to be linked with Cisco IOS (using crwlr.net).\n\nI saw Siemens PLCs also replying \"HTTP-Server\". So, I'm afraid we can't deduce hardware just based on \"HTTP-Server\".\n\nI don't know if what you've done at L1456 - 2641 works, if it works we should change a lot of .* to what you did\n\nIt works on my side in Python, and as far I can see (http://jsfiddle.net/Lh3zbhy5/2/) it also works in JavaScript:\nalert(\"Matches == \" + \nBoolean((new RegExp(\"\", 'i')).exec('whatever')));\nSo indeed a lot of existing \".*\" could be replaced with \"\". But I prefer that someone double-checks it first. What do you think, @ElbertF ?\n. @gadcam:\n\n\nAnd I never saw \"mod_dav\". Still, since I wasn't sure if \"DAV\" and \"mod_dav\" are the same thing here, I decided to define \"DAV\" as a separate app. Any (other) opinions?\nI was right see the current mod_dav.c.\n\n\nRight, corrected in #738\n\nSorry I didn't rewrite all my notes : I mean that using crwlr.net I found that Happy ICS Server is used by Alcatel-Lucent OmniTouch 8660 My Teamwork and it seems to be used only by it.\n\nIndeed, it's My Teamwork also on the machines where I observed it. Added in #738\n\nYou're the \\b is not enough.. I was just asking you to write a more accurate pattern in order to avoid all false positive. And as it we won't need anymore the \"excludes\" field that is, in my opinion, to use only when there is no other way.\n\nI agree, an improved pattern for HTTP-Server is better than excluding HTTP-Server in all *-HTTP-Server apps. Done in #738\n. Very good idea, and indeed let's use some CI solution for automated tests! \nI'd vote for the following order of priorities (from high to low):\n- correctness \n- performance (e.g. avoid HTML patterns if possible)\n- readability (e.g. indentation, ordering of apps)\n- standardisation (ordering of pattern fields, arrays or not when not needed)\nSpeaking of correctness tests: in the recent PR (#731) I fixed at least one detection rule, which I created long time ago, and which then got broken by someone who (I guess) wanted to improve readability or performance of that rule. We'd really want to avoid it in the future - but how? Do we want to go as far as having sample strings for each rule that should match that rule? Other ideas?\n. I was just about to raise the same point (\".+\" is \".\", not empty string) that I now see @q-- raised already. \nAlthough probably for Wappalyzer detection rules it doesn't really matter...\n. Corrected in #738 \n. ",

    "mlconnor": "Ok cool.  Thanks ElbertF.  I'm trying to make a PHP port of Wappalyzer and it's almost complete.  It basically uses CURL and your existing config to compile the report.  It actually parses apps.js so I'm hoping that I wouldn't have to fork apps.js.\n. I was definitely thinking about V8, hadn't considered node.js but that's a good call too.  I was shying away from V8 because a lot of people running PHP don't have V8 installed and I think it's always nice if code runs on the standard PHP distro.\nThe code I wrote basically takes apps.js and converts is to JSON.  I was hoping I could just read it using json_decode but the standard JSON format requires double quotes, and of course doesn't like the inline regex expressions.\nAnd yes!  I will definitely host it on github.  I'm hoping that I can fork part of your project so that apps.js and the images come through and wouldn't have to maintained separately.\nMy ultimate goal is a corporate compliance spider that does post launch analysis on hundreds of sites and reports on software used, SEO compliance, analytics compliance, proper URL structure, etc.  The PHP version of Wappalyzer would of course be separate from all of that.\n. I like where you're going with this.  The thing I'm unsure about is how we execute the page outside of the context of a browser.  I'm used tools like Selenium before that actually use the browser as a driver, but wouldn't we have to actually parse the HTML, execute all scripts within a page context, etc. in order to have the env variables you need?\nIt seems that 90% of the Wappalyzer is based around URL, headers, cookies, metatags, JS refs, which can all easily be done without any eval on the JS.\n. Just as an aside, here is a valid JSON version of the apps.js file.  This is what we be needed if you want to run this outside of JavaScript. The thing that sucks is that the regex patterns look horrible because you have to escape backslashes and quotes.  Regex is bad enough as is and this just makes it worse.  Editing this file would be a disaster.  Of course if you can run V8 then it's not an issue.\nhttps://gist.github.com/3745592\n. also, i think the issue of running JS without the browser is that the DOM and other browser provided variables like document, window, etc wouldn't be available and so the scripts would err out.  you could simulate the browser but it starts getting nasty.\n. Elbert, here is a link to a gist that converts apps.js to valid JSON. It reads from STDIN and writes to STDOUT but I can easily wrap it in a function so it can be called on the fly as you suggest.  Because it's regex, it's not bulletproof with respect to changes in app.js.\nhttps://gist.github.com/3749400\nIt might be interesting to convert apps.js to somewhat valid JSON with the exception of the regex.  Just using double quotes around keys and in place of single quotes.  This would make the parser a little more robust.\n. one more thing...  the way i designed the php version of Wappalyzer to work is that it also takes the content from STDIN.  I'm thinking that this gives you the ability to use curl.  For example...\ncurl --sslv3 --max-redirs 4 --location -i -x http://someproxy.mycorp.com:880 -U proxyusername:proxypassword http://www.slashdot.org\nI think this is really key because the user can then get the pages from anywhere.  curl is nice because we can get through a proxy, get headers, follow redirects etc. \n. Oops.  I swear I'm losing my mind.  The point of STDIN would be that you could pipe it.\ncurl --location -i http://www.slashdot.org | wappalyzer.php\nSo in this instance, curl follows the HTTP 301 redirects and also prints the headers (via the -i switch) so that wappalyzer.php can pick it up.\nI see what you're saying though, you were under the assumption that the PHP script is sitting on a server being called via HTTP.  Perhaps I can add some logic to detect whether or not it's running from the command line or a web server and handle the input differently.\n. I'm starting to see how important the env variable is...  sites are loading js in a lot of strange ways and without env you miss a lot.  For example, some load jQuery using Google other other loaders and so you don't pick up these frameworks without access to env.  rats...\njavascript\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nif (window.google && window.google.load) {\n  google.load(\"jquery\",\"1.4.2\");\n  google.load(\"jqueryui\", \"1.8.0\");\n}\n</script>\n. show off!!!  so will this handle the case where JS files are loaded by a loader?  and my other concern was if scripts like jQuery would try to reference the DOM and then throw exceptions.  even if it doesn't handle the latter, it gets us a lot closer and would probably suffice for 90% of the sites.\ni'll grab the new copy from git and kick the tires on it a little.  this is such a cool project.\n. I found this Javascript sandbox model.  It seems node.js specific but maybe it can be used outside of node.\nhttp://gf3.github.com/sandbox/\nI wasn't able to find anything else.  I submitted an issue on gf3 to try and determine whether or not their sandbox will run on V8 serverside.\nhttps://github.com/gf3/sandbox/issues/20\n. That's fantastic. I think it's a good call. It certainly makes server side scenarios more plausible. Nicely done. \nBy the way, do you do any contract work???  You can hit me @ mlconnor (at) yahoo. \n. Elbert, I'm guessing that you know about PhantomJS http://phantomjs.org.  It's a headless Webkit browser with a JavaScript API.  I'm planning to use that to do the compliance testing I was talking about.  With PhantomJS, I'll be able to run Wappalyzer server side.  This will make is easy breezy.  Thanks again for all of your hard work on this project.\n. Elbert, I've made a lot of progress on using PhantomJS.  Quick question I thought you could answer.  When I hit a web page, there are potentially hundreds of HTTP requests that get fired.  Would I need to check each HTTP request against the rule set?  Or are you just checking against the primary page that is being returned?\n. Ok cool.  I have Wappalyzer working in PhantomJS using everything but the env.  On Slashdot I'm picking up...\nApache\nCentOS\nGoogle Analytics\nVarnish\nSo what I'm missing now is the env variable which oddly enough goes back to my original question.  It seems like the env detection in Wappalyzer is based on regular expression detection of the JavaScript as opposed to the evaluation of a Javascript function or variable.\nI'm guessing that what I need to do is essentially take all of the JavaScript code that may come back from HTTP requests and add them to the data['env'] array.  Can you confirm???\n. ",

    "GreenImp": "Thanks for your response :)\nI don't think it is the same thing. The term jquery.js is very unique (it's a software name), but the term bootstrap isn't. it is a general word that could pop up in other bits of code, not relating to Twitter's own bootstrap.\nThe main issue I see is that the regular expression match seems to be too lax.\n<link[^>]+bootstrap[^>]+css\nCould match, correctly:\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"bootstrap.css\" media=\"all\">\nBut it could also match something like this:\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"my-custom-bootstrap-system.css\" media=\"all\">\nOr:\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" class=\"bootstrap\" href=\"style.css\" media=\"all\">\nYeah, that last one's highly un-likely, but the regex isn't checking that the bootstrap part is in a href attribute.\nIt will just match any <link> tag with the word 'bootstrap' followed (somewhere), by the word 'css'\nI don't really mind that it picked out my 'bootstrap.css' file as Twitter, it is exactly the same filename; but it also means that i cannot put the word 'bootstrap' anywhere in the file.\nSomething like this would probably be better:\n\"<link[^>]+href=\\\"([^\"]*/)?bootstrap(\\.min)?\\.css\\\"\"\nI haven't tested it fully, but should do the job.\nIt wont match anything like this:\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"my-custom-bootstrap-system.css\" media=\"all\">\nBut will match\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"file-path/bootstrap.css\" media=\"all\">\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"bootstrap.min.css\" media=\"all\">\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"file-path/bootstrap.min.css\" media=\"all\">\nThat way, people can have css files with bootstrap in the name, but not getting picked up as Twitter's Bootstrap..\n. Okay, fair enough. Just as a closing thought though, here's a regex that would match bootstrap-1.0.0.css:\n\"<link[^>]+href=\\\"([^\"]*/)?bootstrap\\-?[0-9\\.]*(\\.min)?\\.css\\\"\"\nI don't feel that it is too restrictive, as it ensures that bootstrap is within the href, greatly decreases the chance of false positives and it should match any possible actual uses of Twitter's Bootstrap.\nWith that said, I'll respect that you've closed the issue and leave it at that.\n. Another case where this is causing issues is on websites that use Font Awesome (http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome).\nIt's hosted on the bootstrap CDN, so to include it you would have something like the following:\n<link href=\"//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/3.2.1/css/font-awesome.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\nObviously this is picked up as Twitter's Bootstrap, by Wappalyzer, even though it is not.\nI feel as though the html regular expression should be more restrictive. Perhaps something like:\n<link[^>]+bootstrap(\\.min)?\\.css\nalthough something more like this may be better:\n<link.+?href=\\\"[^\\\"]+bootstrap(\\.min)?\\.css\nTo try and ensure that the bootstrap term is actually within the href tag.\nEither of those would also ensure that some other instances would no longer be correctly picked up, such as:\n<link href=\"http://bootstrap.com/some-style-sheet.css\">\n<link href=\"http://shoes.com/boostraps-are-awesome/some-style-sheet.css\">\n<link id=\"style-bootstrap\" href=\"/some-style-sheet.css\">\n. Yes, this appears to have been broken/modified at some point. Instead of checking the HTML just for the existence of the Bootstrap css file, it now also checks for the Bootstrap-esque class names for columns:\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/apps.json#L5820\n \"<div [^>]*class=\\\"[^\\\"]*col-(?:xs|sm|md|lg)-\\\\d{1,2}\"\nMany other frameworks, or custom rolled systems, have similar (or even identical) class names for their columns. This means that many non-Bootstrap sites could be inaccurately detected.\nI can't initially see why this was added in, as I can't find the original commit that added it. I'm sure there was a good reason, but perhaps this issue is more detrimental? I'd rather get false negatives, than false positives.\n. Ah thanks. I wonder what would be more important here then.\n- To include sites advertised as a \"Top 25\" using Bootstrap, at the expense of falsely included (potentially) hundreds or thousands of incorrect ones.\n- Or to forget about those 9 (and most probably many others that \"hide\" bootstrap in similar ways), and to not include false positives, but at the expense of missing actual Bootstrap sites.\nI wonder if the HTML match could be modified, so it's more restrictive, but probably not.\nI see an issue here, that will probably become more and more common, in that many website now compile third party JS and CSS files into a single JS and CSS file, to limit the amount of HTTP requests - I know that I do it - so this issue will probably only become more prevalent.\n. Brilliant, thanks for merging :)\n. ",

We are using the opensource project in PHP (not the wappalyzer browser extension)\nBeing specialist in this field (hosting company, 1800+ eco sites hosted), we found your product awesome but the signatures used in the Json file are sometime inaccurate or partially false for the Eco and we wish to contribute and make them more reliable.\nSome parameters, for example for Magento, are only found within the JS files, on some of the variables used.\nOne of the problem is that the Enterprise versions (EE version) are using minifications functions, hence, the name of the Javascript file cumulating all the others is randomized.\nFor the EE version, we find a variable that is always present in the files :\nif(!window.Enterprise){window.Enterprise={};}\nEnterprise.templatesPattern=/(^|.|\\r|\\n)({{(.*?)}})/;Enterprise.TopCart={initialize:function(container){this.container=$(container);this.element=this.container.up(0);this.elementHeader=this.container.previous(0);this.intervalDuration=4000;this.interval=null;this.onElementMouseOut=this.handleMouseOut.bindAsEventListener(this);this.onElementMouseOver=this.handleMouseOver.bindAsEventListener(this);this.onElementMouseClick=this.handleMouseClick.bindAsEventListener(this);this.element.observe('mouseout',this.onElementMouseOut);this.element.observe('mouseover',this.onElementMouseOver);this.elementHeader.observe('click',this.onElementMouseClick);},handleMouseOut:function(evt){if($(this.elementHeader).hasClassName('expanded')){this.interval=setTimeout(this.hideCart.bind(this),this.intervalDuration);}},handleMouseOver:function(evt){if(this.interval!==null){clearTimeout(this.interval);this.interval=null;}},handleMouseClick:function(evt){if(!$(this.elementHeader).hasClassName('expanded')&&!$(this.container.id).hasClassName('process')){this.showCart();}\nCan I use the ENV variable of the JSON to find that variable ? Is this the way to proceed.\n. wow, thanks to everyone for the feedbacks.\nHere are sites 100% sure in EE version of Magento and on other in CE version for comparison purposes :\n- http://www.whisky.fr : EE\n- http://www.gemo.fr : EE\n- http://france.hermes.com : EE\n- http://www.nitrogento.com : CE\n. I still can't use the PHP CLI version to identify the Enterprise version, I'm probably understanding something wrong.\n@ElbertF : When you say \"The PHP version is less accurate because it doesn't evaluate JavaScript on websites.\" it means that the ENV variable can never be used in the PHP CLI version of Wappalyzer because JS are not loaded ?\nBecause the real problem behind is that the companies often minify their JS, merging them all in one, and my signature looking for a script name won't work then. On the other hand, having a ENV containing enterprise is quite accurate (if doable in the CLI version of course) but I can't get it work.\nAlso, can I link condition, like with a AND ?\nThis AND that implies XYZ.\n. Hey super smart ! Great :)\nI'm not super used to Git and I don't really know how to contribute, but I've made enhancement to the driver's signatures and included new ones. I also patched very slightly the Wappalyzer.php, by checking the encoding of the content to avoid some problems I had. \nI added : \n$result->html = mb_check_encoding($result->html, 'UTF-8') ? $result->html : utf8_encode($result->html);\njust before\n$json = json_encode(array(\nto make sure the content will be in UTF8, whatever I get.\n.

Strangely, the issue seems to be when \"Analyze JavaScript\" and \"Analyze OnLoad Events\" are both checked. Unchecking either of these two options seems to fix the issue after a browser restart. I've tested each of the options + browser restart 3 times each to make sure it wasn't just a fluke.\n. Thanks alot ElbertF :) - Is there a way (or any future plans of implementing a way) to disable specific options for specific sites? Along the lines of \"Add Exception\"?\nI get lag issues on both my home PC (2.8ghz i5, 6GB ram) and my work PC (i7, 8GB ram) - Both running Windows 7.

Wappalyzer does not detect this.\nThe method for embedding the analytics does not install the environment variable that Wappalyzer is looking for; instead all the SiteCatalyst code, including the site-specific vars, is loaded from another domain, adobetag.com. So, for the site above, it loads:\nhttp://www.adobetag.com/d1/gemoney/live/gemoneyau.js\nWhich in turn sets up the SC data collection to a custom domain.\n. Yeah re-examining the example, I can see you're right. When I logged the issue 11 months ago, they were making calls to adobetag.com, but they've subsequently wrapped their analytics in another 'enterprise tag manager' product from Ensighten, which is turn is serving the SIteCatalyst (and doubleclick) stats code, buried in here:\nhttp://nexus.ensighten.com/gecapitalau/prod/code/50280678c1cb63e048a71cc936ef1f57.js?ruleId=445184\nMy original idea, of an embed tag referencing adobetag.com is, I think, still valid. But I'm without a working example for it now, so feel free to close this if you think appropriate.\nThis is a tough one for Wappalyzer and accuracy of the summary stats it records (and shares) - when stats code gets served / setup by 3rd party services.

Thanx.\nDo let us know when there's a beta available for testing.\n. That was fast ;)\n...unfortunately, I cannot see the button in my customize tab so to place it someplace to be used :(\nI uninstalled Wappalyzer 2.x, installed the new version, restarted firefox (latest 30.0a1 nightly)\n. Nope. Gimme a sec. I'll check on a fresh profile....\n. ...ok. I it shows up as soon as it's installed on a clean profile. Still on 30.0a1 nightly, so this is not a branch issue. I'll investigate some more and if I have time I'll start transferring my current profile one addon at a time over to the new working one. If this is an incompatibility with a specific addon, I'll report back.\n. ...just thought I'd let you know that when restoring sessions (using latest dev of session manager 0.8.0.9pre) the wappalyzer button is blank/empty in all restored windows and it needs a page refresh in order to detect the sites' software.\nThis doesn't only happen for the initially loaded tabs of every restored window - it happens for all tabs. So, in order for it to work you need to first click on a tab in order to be loaded and once loaded you need to refresh the page so that the page is reloaded a second time. Hope that makes sense.\nPS: let me know if you need me to file a separate issue for this.\n. ...actually, after some testing it turns out that it doesn't work for any tab that loads in the background (you can tell once you switch to one such tab). You need to refresh the page. How I'd expect this to work is either to detect site software as the tab loads in the background or invoke detection once I switch to the tab (without a page refresh though)\n. @mlacunza can you please confirm what I'm seeing with latest v3 and firefox 30.0a1: if you load a tab in the background and then switch to it or if you load a stored session (using Session Manager for example) and switch to an unloaded tab, does then Wappalyzer work or does it only show the blank gray box until you refresh the page?\n. @mlacunza: Thanx for the confirmation.\n@ElbertF: Do you want me to open a new issue for that or do you prefer to have this here as a \"catch-all\" ticket for all v3 issues?\n. I just opened #446 \n. ...if it helps, after a bit of more troubleshooting it seems that clicking a second time on the Wappalyzer menu entry provided by the Extension Options Menu menu (while about:addons tab is still open from the first click) takes you to the Wappalyzer settings. A bit better, but still +2 clicks.\n. ...I reverted back to Firefox 36.0a1 nightly x64 build 20141127030208 and the behavior changed back to normal. So this is definitely a change in latest Firefox 37 nightlies.\n. ...I believe this issue has to do with a recent change in Firefox 37. I had to revert to Firefox 36 because I've had 3 issues that seriously effected my productivity:\n- this one here\n- CTRL + clicking on any link would open two new tabs instead of one.\n- various features of Searchbar Autosizer stopped working.\nI've been a faithful user of latest firefox nightlies so that I can help with early testing, but now I don't have that much time in my life.\nAnyways, this is just me ranting. Point is there is no reason to keep this issue open.\n. I'm using latest firefox 38.a1 too and don't see this issue.\n. @atcazzual ...\n\nok, so that pattern didn't show up right.\n\nYou can wrap code in `` (or just add four spaces at the beginning of a line) and the GitHub markdown won't mess with what you type ([Fenced code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#fenced-code-blocks)).\n. Thanx!\n. I think that it is a great idea to have an option to drill down one level and that option to be off be default. In that case, I think that whatever is detected in the iframe should be noted (say with anito the right of the item) as well as whatever is used both on the main page and in the iframe (say with ai+).\n. Example URL please?\n. Oh, you're right that the icons don't show up there, but then again the URL bar in those windows is in a special/disabled state. That might be the cause.\n. You are using an outdated version of Firefox. Latest is 37.0.1, can you please try to upgrade first and then retry: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/\n. [Electrolysis](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Electrolysis) perhaps? If so, try disabling it.\n. I see the logic behind this request, but I always want to scan for everything. So, I do like the way the extension works currently.\n. ...still leads to a 404 error page on github.\n. Could be. Now it works. Sorry for the noise.\n. ...you might wanna changefr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Web_Servertoen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Web_Server(English instead of French) or plainwikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Web_Server`.\n. I wanted to file an issue for this myself, but you beat me to it @DaAwesomeP. It just makes sense to have the actual addon be updated whenever the actual code that does its magic is changed, but not the detection patterns. It's a similar situation as FoxClocks for example: the addon itself has not been updated for some time now, but its database gets updated frequently (with configurable update check intervals).\nI say :+1: \n. @miynat: if you wrap your code in triple grave accents, it'll be more readable. See this :wink:\n. Confirming this one on 42.0a1 x64 on Windows 8.1 with 3.1.1 installed through the addons update.\n. @vahidreza you did not give it enough time to upload the screenshot.

It's just that sometimes the icon is disabled but it comes back after a page refresh.

Is it possible to specify head.load or similar as a environment variable?\n.

I now see that @q-- has updated https://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/pull/520#issuecomment-40873684. This would need to be reopened for an edit.\n\nEnvironment\nI see that Head.js can optionally be configured with the variable head_conf). We could detect that, but it wouldn't be present on every site.\nOf course, we can choose to include the ^head$ pattern and give it a low confidence.\nFrom the same page, I also see that Head.js can be included with a<script> tag with the data-headjs-load attribute. That's something that could be detected as well.\n\nI think all three should be added.\n. Ok\n. Actually could you give an example on how to do the confidence part? I'm a little confused on that. Then I will have a PR ready.\n. Got it. Thanks!\n. Maybe if it were to fire on something similar to jQuery's \"Document Ready\" event it would catch more.\n. Well, I guess that's as good as it will get.\n. Wait a minute? Why are there two commits?\n. That should do it\n. Actually, it would appear to only happen on this page: https://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/edit/master/share/apps.json. Be sure to click the \"Edit\" button (you cannot just view the file).\n. Maybe it's matching the textarea (or whatever it is). There should porbably be an except in scanning for the value of form elements unless it's specifically implied with the HTML field.\n. ~~I see what you are saying with the confidence. But, wouldn't that mean that regular GitHub.com (the place this issue is on) would be shown as 50% instead of 0%?~~ I could set one that one appears on only GitHub.com to have -50% confidence, which when added will equal 0%.\nJSON\n{\n    \"GitHub Pages\": {\n            \"website\": \"pages.github.com\",\n            \"cats\": [ ID_FOR_HOSTING_PROVIDER ],\n            \"url\": \".*\\\\.github\\\\.io\",\n            \"headers\": { \"Server\": \"GitHub\\\\.com\\\\;confidence:\\\\50\", \"((?!X-GitHub-Request-Id).)\": \".*\\\\;confidence:\\\\50\", \"X-GitHub-Request-Id\": \".*\\\\;confidence:\\\\-50\" }\n        }\n}\nI think \"web-hosts\" or \"hosting-providers\" would be good. \"hosting-platforms\" sounds more like Hadoop or a \"Linux + Apache + MySQL + PHP\" combo.\n. The negative percentage would be a good hack.Rather than just detect things not equal to 0, it could be required to be greater than 0.\nI think the category should only track things with specific environments, like GiutHub Pages, Google App Engine, Heroku, Nodejitsu, etc.\n. I just inserted my apps.json into my XPI (opened as a zip with 7zip), and I am seeing GitHub Pages (null% sure) on both GitHub and GitHub Pages. I cannot quite pinpoint what would be causing this in the source (is it greater than 0% or just show a negative as null), but it could also be my regex pattern. The good thing is that it is only showing on GitHub pages at all, and not everything.\nThe idea is to mark the server tag as 50% to see that it is hosted by GitHub. If it sees a header  that is only on GitHub.com (not Pages) like X-GitHub-Request-Id, it will add -50% _(notice the negative)_, bringing the total to zero. If it sees that X-GitHub-Request-Id is not there, it will add another 50%, bringing it to 100%.\nRegex:\njson\n{\n        \"GitHub Pages\": {\n            \"website\": \"pages.github.com\",\n            \"cats\": [ 31 ],\n            \"url\": \".*\\\\.github\\\\.io\",\n            \"headers\": { \"Server\": \"GitHub\\\\.com\\\\;confidence:\\\\50\", \"((?!X-GitHub-Request-Id).)\": \".*\\\\;confidence:\\\\50\", \"X-GitHub-Request-Id\": \".*\\\\;confidence:\\\\-50\" }\n        }\n}\n. Maybe a ;//neg could be added to simplify things if a - sign would be too difficult to detect.\nI'm too lazy to use the SDK for little things. I'm not worried about updates as I can just reinstall it.\n. I experimented with lines 30 through 36 in the scratchpad, and I found that when I remove the for argument and do total += -50, and total += 50 myself, it works fine. The error has to be coming from this.confidence[id].\n. this.confidence[id] appears to be coming from line 70. I'm not sure how an - sign would throw this off though.\n. I don't think there would be a way to use a confidence threshold here. There's no way that I can tell where two low values could add up. Server: GitHub.com and \"((?!X-GitHub-Request-Id).)\": \".*\" must both be valid. However, \"((?!X-GitHub-Request-Id).)\": \".*\" will be valid on almost any website. If I set \"((?!X-GitHub-Request-Id).)\": \".*\" to a low confidence and Server: GitHub.com high, then it will fire on regular the GitHub site.\nAnother solution would be to add //;void which would multiply by zero if there is a match or just set it to zero. Then Server: GitHub.com and \"((?!X-GitHub-Request-Id).)\": \".*\" could both be 50%. The //;void statement would exclude regular the GitHub regular GitHub site, but it would ensure proper GitHub Pages detection.\n. Image? Environment variable? Version detection? https://github.com/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/wiki/Contributing\n. I myself have even manually tried removing the XPI to no avail. However, I am only seeing the icons.\n. I'll close this re-update, re-commit, and try again.\n. Which files is it complaining about? I can redo the commits too if needed.\n. I think this is ready. @ElbertF does GitHub still want a manual merge?\n. I will create another set of commits and a pull\n. They are not in apps.json. However, the images merged.\n. I have another commit ready to sync with just the new (and updated) apps.json. It would probably make it easier to merge.\n.

I think that WordPress.com should be re-added since the statistics are still on wappalyzer.com, which lacks an icon.\n. I think that a TravisCI test for checking for errors in apps.json is really needed. I could work on that. It would be really simple.\n. @ElbertF We may not be able to test the extensions very easily, but I think that testing if the apps.json is actually a valid JSON file is vital since people submit invalid JSON all the time. It usually then is followed by another pull request to fix the JSON. This would effortlessly save a step and also help to teach JSON to beginners (or just to force lazy people to check their work).\n\nTesting an individual app would require another object with example strings and outcomes. If the outcome doesn't match when the string is inputted, then an error would be thrown. It would be ~~lots of~~ _too much_ work though to add this feature in this late in the project.\n. I have been using Webmin/Usermin/Virtualmin on and off over the years, and from looking at my installs, there is nothing that can really show that it is Webmin or one of the others except for a specific image or word \"Webmin\" anywhere.\n. I am trying the above but I think I hit a problem. @AliasIO Does Wappalyzer detect in the insides of frames?\n. Webmin, Virtualmin, and Usermin use a frame on the left for navigation and one on the right for content. All of the detection ideas above are in those frames. This should be closed.\n. From looking at their homepage the only thing you have to match is this:\n``` html\n<!--\n   /\\__\\         /\\  \\         /\\__\\         /\\  \\         /\\__\\\n  /:/  /        /::\\  \\       /:/  /        /::\\  \\       /::|  |\n /:/__/        /:/\\:\\  \\     /:/__/        /:/\\:\\  \\     /:|:|  |\n/::\\__\\____   /:/  \\:\\  \\   /::\\__\\____   /::\\~\\:\\  \\   /:/|:|  |__\n\n/:/\\:::::_\\ /:// \\:_\\ /:/\\:::::_\\ /:/\\:\\ \\:_\\ /:/ |:| /_\\\n   \\/|:|~~|~    \\:\\  \\ /:/  / \\/|:|~~|~    \\:\\~\\:\\ \\// \\/|:|/:/  /\n      |:|  |      \\:\\  /:/  /     |:|  |      \\:\\ \\:__\\       |:/:/  /\n      |:|  |       \\:\\/:/  /      |:|  |       \\:\\ \\//       |::/  /\n      |:|  |        \\::/  /       |:|  |        \\:_\\         /:/  /\n       \\||         \\//         \\||         \\//         \\/__/\n-->\n```\nThere are no headers to match. If you can translate the above into a JSON escape regex, then you will have a detection. I definitely don't want to escape all of that.\n. I dug through my history: http://derbyjs.com/\n. I must have made an error. I added an HTML regex to the Twitter Bootstrap recently.\n\nOn Feb 23, 2015, at 5:10 AM, \"Alexandra Anghel\" notifications@github.com wrote:\nHi there,\nI'm trying to use the PhantomJs driver, so far I have followed the instructions. When I run the following command:\n\"phantomjs driver.js http://mywebsite.com\"\nI get the following error:\n\"SyntaxError: JSON Parse error: Invalid escape character .\"\nIf I delete the \"Twitter Bootstrap\" section from the apps.json file, it works fine.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. I made a pull to fix it in #797. I forgot to double escape.\n. Fixed. This should be closed.\n. I've never used Gulp before, but I've always needed to. I'll try to get it working with that and add another commit to remove Grunt and add Gulp.\n\nThe great thing about Grunt and Gulp is that they can do just about everything. It can be expanded to test whatever needs to be tested. The JSON is where most of the errors come from, and it's also the easiest thing to test, so I went ahead and added it.\n. I suppose you could run the wappalyzer commands through Travis. I'm not sure that they would properly trigger pass/fail, but it's worth a shot.\nI'm going to commit and try some things in my fork. I think I can get away with using the scripts in bin/.\n. @ElbertF, there you go. It is validating with ./bin/wappalyzer-validate.\nI think that we should add npm install -g jsonlint to wappalyzer-validate so that if more dependencies are needed, then .travis.yml won't have to be updated too. NPM will only install the package anyways if it is out of date or doesn't exist. I can go ahead and commit that to this pull if you would like.\nFor some reason Travis is setting up Ruby even though I have specified node_js in .travis.yml. It's not affecting anything, but it's weird.\nHere's the passed test: https://travis-ci.org/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/builds/51895639\n. Once you want to add regex testing and the other stuff, you will definitely need Gulp. I'm not sure its worth the trouble of parsing JSON in a shell script.\n. I see. So the JSON validation covers everything.\nWe still need to include a script for the dependencies or simplt add them to the wappalyzer-validate script. I am manually including npm install -g jsonlint in .travis.yml. @ElbertF are you okay with me adding that to wappalyzer-validate? This way if more things do end up getting added, Travis will still always succeed.\n. Don't close this yet; I'm trying one last thing in one of my VMs. I am going to see if Travis CI can run Vagrant. Then we can automatically test and build everything.\n. I hope this works...\n. In the docker docs it says to use docker.io. They are different packages. I think this is an older version of Ubuntu (possibly 12.04). I'm just going to use the more up-to-date manual way that they list.\nhttps://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/\n. It stalled doing the exact same thing is did before. I'll try re-adding the apt-get update.\n. It stalled again. I'm stumped. It could possibly be a particular Travis CI server, but that is unlikely.\n. I've sent a support email to Travis CI about the inconsistent stalls. Sometimes it stalls and sometimes it doesn't. I don't think it is a problem with .travis.yml or anything else that we can control.\n. I think that the solution would be not to mess with Docker or Vagrant in Travis at all. Unless there is a way to run a dockerfile like you would a sh, we need to simply have the dockerfile run an sh with all of the setup commands. This way Docker and Travis would run the same setup and build scripts without 1) having a VM inside a VM in Travis. 2) Having a Dockerfile and sh script for setup that must both be updated at the same time and match. 3) Nearly maxing the resources in the Travis VM.\n@ElbertF are you okay with this and if I do make the sh what should I call it and where should I put it? I could very easily convert most of the dockerfile into an sh. I will test it in my VM before I commit it. This would hopefully mean only one more commit.\n. Ok, I'll make an install-dependencies.sh in the root. I won't touch the dockerfile. This means though that if the dockerfile is changed, then the other file will need to be changed too.\n. That's a good idea. I'll do that.\n. @ElbertF _It is done!_ Here is a passed test that works correctly: https://travis-ci.org/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/builds/52068803#L1577\nHowever, when parts failed they did not trigger Travis. This is a problem in wappalyzer-build and probably wappalyzer-validate too. The build sequence needs to (a little uncleanly) quit completely with an error if there is a problem. In one build (https://travis-ci.org/ElbertF/Wappalyzer/builds/52068059#L1576) Travis passed, but the build really failed.\nI will fix that and use that commit to squash all of the others. I'm not sure how to fix that though (i.e. how to make the script exit on error).\n. @ElbertF actually, from looking at wappalyzer-validate, it has code the exit correct. The problem is only in wappalyzer-build. Should I add the following under each build command for Firefox, Chrome, and the Bookmarklet or do something from here.\n``` bash\nif [ $? -eq 0 ]\nthen\n    echo -e \"${color_ok}Ok${color_none}\"\nexit 0\n\nelse\n    echo -en \"${color_none}\"\nexit 1\n\nfi\n```\nThe commands I would put this under would be:\n``` bash\ncfx xpi --pkgdir=$WAPPALYZER_ROOT/src/drivers/firefox --output-file=$WAPPALYZER_ROOT/build/wappalyzer_firefox.xpi\npushd $WAPPALYZER_ROOT/src/drivers/chrome > /dev/null\nzip -qr $WAPPALYZER_ROOT/build/wappalyzer_chrome.zip .\npopd > /dev/null\necho \"var json =\" > /tmp/bookmarklet\ncat $WAPPALYZER_ROOT/src/apps.json >> /tmp/bookmarklet\necho -e \";\\n\\nwappalyzer.apps = json.apps;\\nwappalyzer.categories = json.categories;\" >> /tmp/bookmarklet\nmv /tmp/bookmarklet $WAPPALYZER_ROOT/src/drivers/bookmarklet/js/apps.js\n``\n. [Here](http://www.davidpashley.com/articles/writing-robust-shell-scripts/#id2382181) lists several ways to do it. For now it should catch theapps.jsonerrors (the most likely ones), so I will add the badge to the README and squash the commits. Then it will be ready to merge.\n. @ElbertF  There we go! **_Ready to merge.**_ One commit with the.travis.ymland the badge in the README. Once it's merged the badge should say passing since this pull will pass. Reload the page if it still says more than one commit at the top.\n. **_DO NOT MERGE YET!**_ It thinks I deleted non existent lines. My git got out of sync. I can fix that.\n. This got really butchered. I'm going to close this, pull a fresh git, and start over.\n. While it may seem overkill, I am testing that the files are actually PNGs even though they have the extension because simply renaming an ICO or JPG to a PNG technically works. It will show in most browsers, but it's not at all correct.\n. The extra files check is to make sure that extra and useless bulk of the extension would not build. I had to remove 16 icons in order for my commit to pass. I'm not sure how many mb that was, but it was probably worth it. If any apps are to be removed fromapps.json` in the future, it would ensure that a proper cleanup is completed.\n. I destroyed/re-created the vagrant as well as updating my git and I still have the problem:\n``` bash\nValidating apps.json...\nValidating regular expressions...\nValidating icons...\nmodule.js:340\n    throw err;\n          ^\nError: Cannot find module 'file-type'\n    at Function.Module._resolveFilename (module.js:338:15)\n    at Function.Module._load (module.js:280:25)\n    at Module.require (module.js:364:17)\n    at require (module.js:380:17)\n    at Object.

Please add another commit withINFOnline.png.\n. Could you add that MEAN implies,MongoDBandnode.js`?\nThis can be done with an array named implies. See Specification/JSON fields.\n. You need to not have a space after [^>] or it will require (not be optional) to only have a space there. You also need to single escape the src's double quotation mark. I would do it like the following so that it can detect both marks:\njson\n\"html\": \"<script[^>]src=('|\\\")\\\\/modules\\\\/aggregated\\\\.js\",\nPlease add another commit.\n. Great! Now it passes the tests.\n. SVG support should be added in #1012.\n. Some of those sites are going through proxies (Apache or Nginx), so that would remove/replace the server header. And actually, hood.ie is using GitHub Pages (the server header is GitHub.com) and barn2door is using Cowboy. Could you run hapi locally and see what it does (i.e. follow their example where you can access it from localhost)?\nI would recommend using the network tab of Firefox Developer Tools to find the headers. You may be prompted to reload the page. Then select a URL and look for headers in both the server and client. You should test multiple different URLs (CSS, JavaScript, images, and content from other servers could all have different headers).\n. Yay! Wappalyzer is passing again.\n. I see. GitHub Pages could be used as the CDN. It's fast (it uses Fastly as its backend), very reliable, secure, and free. The database could be versioned (by date would be easiest) and updated at set time intervals. The data would be downloaded to a temp folder. It's just an idea. Please close this if you don't like it; I don't want to work on something that will be rejected.\n. SVGs will work with #1012.\n. The changes to .travis.yml now conflict with #969.\nNot only have other parts of the file changed (git sometimes does and doesn't merge this type of conflict correctly), but I have switch it to NodeJS 0.12.x. Your commit switches the Travis one to io.js and does not change the Docker build. If you do upgrade the Docker build, then you will need to change the package that it is installing as well as the APT repo from here: https://nodesource.com/blog/nodejs-v012-iojs-and-the-nodesource-linux-repositories\n. @rugk I like that idea. For simplicity, apps.json could contain the tests so that only one file will contain all of the info as it does now. Then at build the tests in it could be removed after they are run.\n. @rugk you can add another commit to fix it. It's not a good idea to put a slash in a filename (in fact, you can't on any filesystem that I've heard of), so you might have to just call it \"HTTP2\" instead of \"HTTP/2\" as a workaround.\n@AliasIO maybe in the future an optional JSON attribute could allow for an alternative image path or maybe a pattern in the name such as \"HTTP/\\/2\" could link to the image \"HTTP2.png\" but still show the name \"HTTP/2.\"\n. The icon file name issue should be resolved with #1012.\n. I can work on changing the icon testing and compression to be compatible. I can make it look for the icon based on the application's name or use the icon path attribute if it's present. I think that it should be option and only used for special cases to prevent the need to add the new attribute to all of the current apps.\nHowever, be mindful of SVG file sizes. SVGs _may be significantly larger, even with lots of compression. The size of a PNG vs. the size of an SVG depends entirely on how the SVG was created. Depending on who created it with what tool, it can either be more efficient than the PNG counterpart or drastically worse. Since the SVGs will be physically small on screen (not necessarily pixels coughretinacough, but to the eye), I can have the compressor round off the decimals/lower the precision. *'ll try to make it pull an error if any images are embedded in the SVG, as this defeats the purpose of the SVG and makes it very large in file size,_ but I don't know if I'll be able to.\nWe could also use Gzipped SVGs, but I don't know how that will impact performance. Also, take a look at this post about a few different files types and sizes (based on Google's new logo, but informative).\n. If no icon attribute is present, I will make it first look for an SVG and then a PNG. If none or both are present, it will pull an error.\n. @AliasIO, you want to have an icon attribute for every app? For the apps that don't need it it could save space by not being a required field. I'll make it required in the tests for now.\n. I did not remove any of the duplicate icons in pull #1012 (i.e. the HP example provided by @rugk above), but it should be possible to fix that after it is merged. The HTTP2 vs. HTTP/2 issue could also be resolved.\n. @rugk I think that it should remain open until SVG support is added to the drivers and you can add a separate filename for HTTP/2.\n. This will close #1004.\n. Not sure what it thinks the deletions are in apps.json. Maybe I messed up the spacing or newlines. It seems to be fine though.\n. I have _not_ updated the wiki about the new icon attribute.\n. @gadcam\u00a0that's what I thought that we should do to avoid the need to add a field to every single app.\n. You can also enable Travis CI on your fork. Just be sure to rebase your commits or use --amend.\n. It probably wasn't detected because they're using dart. I don't know how we could distinguish between them besides checking for the \"upgrade\" library that lets you use both Angular 1 and 2 at the same time.\nAngular 1.x\nAngular 2.x\n. This can be closed now.\n. The build errored. That's odd. Seems to have been unable to download something.\n. @pallxk Great! I see that you added support for the new icon attribute.\n@AliasIO Could you please drop the SVG for the Wappalyzer logo into the icons folder as default.svg? After #1039 I'm going to change all of the no-icon ones with the Wappalyzer icon to that as well as a lot of the popular apps (jQuery, Nginx, Angular, Bootstrap, etc.).\n. @AliasIO OK, if you could please drop that as default.png, that would be great! The current one is only 32x32.\n. Kind of like CDNjs. The only problem would be when you actually compile it. It would take a very long time to download more than 100 git repos, even if it was just two files in a separate branch.\nMaybe we could do something where everything is still stored here but there is a script that can update everything when run.\n. I think that we should have a standard for this (i.e. a branch named wappalyzer).\n. Well, in my past experience with submodules, they reference a commit. So, unless there is a way to reference the most up to date part of a branch, then this may not be very effective.\n@rugk I just meant that it shouldn't be in the master branch of whatever project. A separate repo like you said would be better.\nThe other problem is with tests. There is no way to enforce testing the whole thing, which is especially important if it can be updated without approval at any time.\n. I have this problem too. I usually just ignore it. It might have to do with its version ID.\n. @gadcam It's the same icon that was the PNG. It's not square, and I haven't tested how it scales (we might need to only set the height attribute on the <img> for proper scaling, but it is locked into a certain size (see drivers.js). The SVGs are fantastic for higher-resolution displays (i.e. retina).\n. I've reported the problem with the tests here: https://github.com/sindresorhus/file-type/issues/48. When a fix is released, I'll update the version.\n. @AliasIO The culprit: anchorCache.png. I'll submit a fix to catch this error.\n@ioli Please do not upload blank files. I'm guessing by the name of the pull and the name of the branch that it came from (#1057) that you did it through the GitHub web interface. To properly upload non-textual file (binary, like images), you must use the git CLI. On the plus side, you helped strengthen the tests to prevent this.\n. See #1065.\n. @gadcam It should be compressed in the build process. I'm sure that yes, it's 93 kilobytes probably outweighs the 1.3 kilobytes that the several duplicate ones were. However, the build size for both the Firefox and Chrome extensions are still each less than one megabyte (this is why I have ls run afterwards in the Travis build). I'm not sure how much we should be concerned with the size (just my opinion).\n. @ioli To fix the image, I simply took the one from your GitHub profile. If you wish to change that I'm sure that @AliasIO would be happy to accept another pull.\n. @ioli You need to use the git command from the terminal (OSX), command prompt (Windows), or shell/bash prompt (Linux). Normally, I would recomend this, but you seem pretty new to all of this, so you might want to start with GitHub Desktop. That way you don't have to mess with SSH keys or the MSYS2 Bash on Windows.\n1. Install GitHub Desktop form here: https://desktop.github.com/\n2. Fork Wappalyzer by going to the repo home (https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer) and clicking the Fork button in the top right. This will in a way copy the repo to your account. This you can (through GitHub Desktop) clone to your computer. You will have a folder that you can make changes in.\n3. After you make some changes, you can create a commit with a message describing your changes and then push (upload) it to your fork (the \"copy\" repo that you made).\n4. Back on the GitHub website, so to your fork and click the green button that says \"New Pull Request.\" From there I think that you'll figure it out.\nThis isn't in any instructions anywhere in this repo because these instructions aren't specific to this project. All Git projects work in this way.\n. @ioli Glad to help! Please close this issue when you get a chance.\n. @ameyanaik11 No, they do not have their own logo, but they do seem to have pulled the newer one from Angular 2. Would you mind adding it in? I found it here. You can keep it as an SVG and probably just call it Angular.svg (In Angular 1, the developers decided to call it AngularJS and in Angular 2, it's just Angular).\nThe regular Angular entry hasn't been updated to check for Angular 2 because there isn't really a good way to do so (see #1030).\n. That's odd. The tests didn't run.\n. There is a new WebExtension version of the addon that will become mainstream at the very least when Firefox 57 is released and old SDK addons are discontinued. The new version will not have issues with e10s. The WebExtension is currently available for testing.. As I'm reading this message yet another message for another addon has appeared. I think that you're right.\n. @GeorgeWL Correct, the latest version (v4.0.1) was released prior to that pull. You may build the latest master or wait for the next release.. @Revod Wappalyzer has moved onto a WebExtension stack using Mozilla's polyfill. Sadly, Edge's API doesn't support Promises but does use the browser variable. Would you help to get the extension to work in Edge?. @AliasIO So why exactly does Microsoft use the browser variable but not support promises? Doesn't that mean that the entire polyfill must simple be hard-coded on a case-by-case basis?. If you may, anyone watching this issue should click the \"Me too\" button (requires a Microsoft login). It looks like they haven't done anything about it since October 2016.. Why does the SVG need to be square? It seems to scale properly.. @AliasIO why is it that Firefox uses the SVGs but Chrome requires the icons to be converted?. That was fast\n. I'm ever so slowly updating them and replacing the ones that I can with SVGs. I'm working on a commit that's about half way through the A's.\n. This issue will be obsolete when v4 is pushed to Mozilla.. This is how Chrome identifies extensions. The URL accesses the extension's internal pages. This ID system works better than names in case two extensions have the same/similar name or odd characters. All extensions that package webpages to use with itself work this way. If you go to the official extension page in the Chrome Web Store, you'll see the same ID in the URL. You can Google it if you don't trust me or use this link: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wappalyzer/gppongmhjkpfnbhagpmjfkannfbllamg?hl=en\n. @AliasIO This manual merge fix shouldn't be too hard. Do I just need to remove an icon?\n. Great!\n. The Docker Hyper-V stuff is messy. After trying it, I got a BSOD at every boot and had to boot into safe mode to disable Hypervisor. Stick with the Docker VirtualBox method to be safe.. Hi all,\nYou're probably having an issue related to e10s. Please try out the WebExtension.\n@aliasio I recently submitted a new Opera and Firefox addon. The Opera moderators are very picky about the manifest, so there will need to be two separate packages. I'll have a pull soon.. This can be closed as of #1512.. @jvoisin Nice pun. You're welcome.. \"Contributor\" means that at least one of your commits has been merged in the main repo. \"Collaborator\" means that you can push to repo, control issues, etc.. The WebExtension (in Firefox) doesn't work properly for me. The pageAction appears in every tab, and the first detected app is the icon of the pageAction. However, the popup from clicking on it is always Google Analytics and jQuery, which I assume is what was detected in one particular tab. Upon clicking the popup, I get TypeError: can't access dead object followed by [wappalyzer debug] message: get_apps in the debugger.. It seems that sendMessage isn't working in Firefox nor Chrome.. OK this is odd\u2014after reloading the addon, it is working perfectly.. I see a lot of TypeError: chrome.extension.sendRequest is not a function. This might be your issue: http://stackoverflow.com/a/15641460/2852590\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/runtime/sendMessage. Thanks for pushing.\nI found the issue and will submit a pull shortly. The polyfill doesn't work for both sides of the messages (sending and receiving). I'm really not sure why the polyfill goes to such lengths to rework sendMessage() and onMessage, because the syntax is exactly the same for chrome and browser!. @AliasIO It works. That's all I can say. Since it works, I'm probably just ignoring the response or error from a function. Creating pull now.\nThe syntax for onMessage is 100% the same:\njs\nbrowser.runtime.onMessage.addListener(funciton(message, sender, sendResponse){})\nchrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener(funciton(message, sender, sendResponse){})\n// sendResponse(object message) for both\nIn the case of sendMessage(), the code was using callbacks (not Promises), and this seems to work in Firefox (I guess they left this part compatible). So, the syntax is again the same:\njs\nbrowser.runtime.sendMessage({ id: 'get_apps', tab: tabs[0] }, function (response){});\nchrome.runtime.sendMessage({ id: 'get_apps', tab: tabs[0] }, function (response){});. See #1431. No problem! Wappalyzer will survive the Great Addon Purge.. Edge is very very very very strict about the manifest file. It doesn't really have defaults to the keys; all keys that are needed must be present. Also, some of the keys have different schemas; I don't know why Microsoft does this. Also, I don't think that the polyfill really helps at all with it.\nOpera, on the other hand, works almost exactly like Chrome (except that it puts the pageAction in the URL bar like Firefox). I don't think that there's a developer fee though, so the extension could definitely be published for Opera. I tested with Opera 43 (stable) and 45 (dev).\nI'll mess around with Edge and try to get it to work.. First error in Edge:\nSEC7111: HTTPS security is compromised by ms-browser-extension://Wappalyzer_b9gdh4rg3k5pe/js/inject.js\nMicrosoft says to ignore the error, but nothing else is in the log to show why it isn't working. There's simply no output anywhere. There is nothing in either the background page dev tools console or a tab's dev tools console. There is no pageAction in sight.. I've pushed the manifest changes for Edge to my fork if you'd like to mess around with it. I hit the brick wall.. @aditya3098 would you like to test out the WebExtension version of the addon? It places only one icon in the URL bar, but it uses a new method to show the popup.. @aditya3098 would you like to build it yourself or should I send you a ZIP? It's simple to build. You just need a Vagrant/Docker install.. Well, in order to submit to Opera at least they'll make you remove the applications key, you can't use SVG icons in Opera and Chrome, and the Opera mods will definitely catch having two options keys (for Edge).. This is from the new WebExtension version of the addon. To be clear, are you seeing this error and the extension is not functioning, or are you seeing this error and the extension is still functioning as normal?\nIn my Chrome, the extension is functioning just fine despite the errors. However, there shouldn't be any errors.. This actually seems to have run longer.\n3min 34sec: https://travis-ci.org/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/builds/218532383\nAverage of 1min ~30sec: https://travis-ci.org/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/builds\nThose times aren't a good comparison though. The trusty builds are a beta, so that might have something to do with it. Travis also probably didn't use the node_modules cache from the older builds.. @PatriotRDX, @edmandiesamonte, @RezaGhanbari What version of Chrome do you have? You all seem to be on Mac OS. Also, please look around in the debugger for CSS or markup issues if you may: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/tut_debugging#inspect-popup. @PatriotRDX @RezaGhanbari Thanks for checking! It's either that CSS file issue or another known Chromium issue:\nhttps://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=307912\nhttps://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=428044\nhttps://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=317880\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/issues/423\nOn 4/9/17 1:25, Reza wrote\n@DaAwesomePhttps://github.com/DaAwesomeP Chrome version 55.0.2883.95 (64-bit) on macOS Sierra.\nI also checked on Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 16.04. That was okay.\n. I appear to be reeving the same error on Windows, but I don't have any issues. I don't think that widget.css is really meant to exist anymore. It's probably residue in the HTML from the older Chrome-only driver. There is some other issue here.\n\nCould you attach the extension file (in a ZIP or other archive) as it appears on your system? It should be the folder at ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Extensions/gppongmhjkpfnbhagpmjfkannfbllamg. \nHave you tried completely uninstalling and reinstalling the extension? I don't have a Mac, so I can't reproduce this issue.\nThe only (and unrelated) issue I have on Chrome for Windows is that Chrome sometimes butchers the box shadow on the popup and just shows an ugly, thick black border.. @RezaGhanbari Yes, widgets.css doesn't even exist in the source, but that is not the cause of the problem. There used to be a widgets.css, but it's not needed anymore. It's just still referenced in the HTML by mistake. I have a strong feeling that this is a very specific issue with Chrome for Mac.\n@AliasIO thoughts?. @PatriotRDX what version of Wappalyzer, Chrome (specifically), and macOS do you have installed?. See #1514. Basically GitHub allows you to \"publish\" a tag and add release notes and built files to download. You will need to edit the Travis file as I specified in the pull. I added checksums for verification that the built files came from Travis.. I fixed the merge conflict.. Great!. This commit is currently causing the build to fail: https://travis-ci.org/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/builds/224815468\n\nError: The pattern uses more capture groups than needed. Use non-capturing groups where appropriate.\nFroala Editor: html: class=\".*(fr-view|fr-box). SVGs are preferred to PNGs. PNGs should be 32x32 or at least 32px in one dimension if the image isn't square. PNGs should also be cropped to the smallest size (no unnecessary padding). They are losslessly compressed during build, so don't worry about the file size.\nhttps://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/wiki/Contributing#adding-a-new-application. @AlexByte why does the icon need to be square? The original icon was just fine. As a vector, it will resize proportionally to fit the space provided. I would not recommend editing the SVG unless to remove junk elements or blankspace/padding around the main logo/icon.. I don't understand the Widget category. I like the UI framework idea though.. Why does it have to be square? The images scale properly.. That would be very hard to enforce on already-added icons. Maybe it would be better to amend this stylesheet to only specify width: 16px; height: auto so that it scales: https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/drivers/webextension/css/popup.css#L20. I don't think that we see the same issue. I think that this is an issue with the SVG converter and not the SVGs themselves. The SVGs display fine in Firefox are technically correct.. OK, try width: 16px; height: auto; max-height: 16px;.. OK, so the viewBox issue is separate from an icon simply being not square. The non-square don't scale properly and the viewBox issue causes them not to be converted properly.. @AlexByte they are probably shifting up because of the vertical align. I suppose that the images could be placed in a 16x16 div that aligns the image to the center of itself but the div itself if aligned to the top. I'll try it out myself when I have more time.. @AliasIO there would indeed appear to be a problem with the version just uploaded to AMO. The icon in the URL bar appears to be a blank space sometimes and sometimes not (ex. GitHub seems to produce a blank space, Reddit does not). I did not encounter this bug previously in my own builds.\n\n@mjmarrer Mozilla has deprecated the older addons API in favor of the newer WebExtension API. The older API addons will be disabled in later versions of Firefox, so Wappalyzer has become a WebExtension. Per the WebExtension API, an addon is allowed only one icon to appear in the URL bar (see pageAction). The option that you referenced allows for the pageAction to either always show the Wappalyzer icon or the icon of the first-detected application.. @geekyi Yes, the version just uploaded to AMO makes it now a WebExtension. I've been using my own build of the repo for several weeks prior to now, but I did not experience this bug (the blank space). However, the fact that only one icon appears in the URL bar is not a bug; that is a limitation of WebExtensions.\nI am using Nightly 55.0a1 (2017-06-05) 64-bit.. @gadcam as far as I am aware, only one icon can be added to the URL bar per extension. Maybe something can be done to prioritize which icon is chosen for the pageAction, or it can cycle it every second or so (that might cause a performance issue though). Unfortunately, Firefox 57 will disable all non-Webextensions.. @gadcam that's a sneaky trick but fantastic if it works. It will have to be for Firefox and Opera only though because Chrome puts the pageAction in the regular toolbar and not the URL bar. That will also be easiest achieved with PNGs only and not SVGs, but the build renders SVGs to PNGs already anyway. I'm not sure what the memory footprint will look like, but it's worth a shot.\nGo to about:debugging and you can load an unpacked extension. It will be removed next time you restart FF. If you install Firefox Developer Edition, I believe that it either doesn't check for signed extensions or has an about:config option to disable signing. I would recommend using a separate profile for Developer Edition though.. @gadcam supposedly we could create a virtual canvas (as in the <canvas> element), put all the images on it side by side, and then extract a data URI to use as the icon.\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/6765370/merge-image-using-javascript\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/158750/can-you-combine-multiple-images-into-a-single-one-using-javascript\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/3768565/drawing-an-svg-file-on-a-html5-canvas. @juliustip The addon has become a WebExtension to ensure that it is compatible with future Firefox versions, which will only support WebExtensions. Unfortunately, WebExtensions only allow for one pageAction and/or toolbar button.\nYou can still install older v3 versions from Mozilla, but they will not receive database/application list updates:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wappalyzer/versions/. @AliasIO are application/xml and text/xml excluded from checking?. @jvoisin @AliasIO You can connect IRC/XMPP in the Slack account settings:\n\nI've never used it before.. Good catch! I'll add another commit.\n. It is requiring that the file ends in .css or .min.css which eliminates most conflicts.\n. What do you mean? It must be one of those... It can't be fonts.whatever.com.\n. Alright.\n. Oh. I didn't think about that part. Except why would you be including one of the pages that you described in a website? The reason why I left it open is because the paid version of Glyphicons has PNGs, fonts, SVGs, JPGs, CSS, and much more. I don;t have that version so I don't know what they look like specifically.\n. As I said above, I do not have a particular URL. Since I do not have the paid version, I do not know the all of the possible filenames/URLs. However, the free versions, which only includes PNGs, has URLs like glyphicons_003_user.png, so I guess it could match only glyphicons_.\nAs for false positives, why would anyone load something like https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20344363/add-all-glyphicons-to-bootstrap-3 in their webpage?\n. Then I can remove it entirely.\n. Yes, I could use the src tag in HTML.\n. I'm sorry; I misread. I thought you said to add one.\n. This is also not in alphabetical order if that matters.\n. I noticed that it wasn't triggering. Varnish now correctly reads 1.1 varnish or 1.1 varnish, 1.1 varnish on pages. The Via header I believe is supposed to have the HTTP version in it anyways. I noticed this multiple times when observing the headers of different websites.\n. One will find only Varnish and the other will find that as well as 1.1 Varnish. It wasn't working before. I did test it.\n. My bad. I'll fix it.\n. @gadcam Fixed\n. ",

Huge thanks! \nI guess icons are too squeezed right now; perhaps adding small (2--3px) margin to the right, as it used to be (IIRC), would be beneficial. \n. @gadcam I wouldn't care too much about that, since soon this star will be removed from the address bar (think: Australis[1].) There's a handy extension called Classic Theme Restorer[2] with which you can put the star back, and then it goes to the right side of Wappalyzer's icons (as it should.)\nBut, when I am at this, let me say that adding wider left-margin to the icons block would help detach them from other icons that can be displayed in the address bar (e.g. Operator, RSS Icon in url bar, Server Switcher, possibly others) and which are displayed to the left of Wappalyzer's icons.\n[1] http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=2778881\n[2] https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/classicthemerestorer/ \n.

I'll need to wait until I get back to work on Monday to try inspecting the pop-up.. @DaAwesomeP inspecting did not turn up much besides the console message that @RezaGhanbari found, that chrome-extension://gppongmhjkpfnbhagpmjfkannfbllamg/css/widgets.css was missing.\nGranted I don't know a lot about Chrome development, since I'm just a regular old web designer/dev, but maybe this was a built-in file that was removed from Chrome on Mac for whatever reason?. @DaAwesomeP I did uninstall/reinstall. I've attached the extension in a .zip file for you.\ngppongmhjkpfnbhagpmjfkannfbllamg.zip\n. @AliasIO the weird thing is that sometimes it does work. And the extension used to work...and now I wish I knew which version started this. Definitely after the logo change went into effect though.. @AliasIO were there any changes in code other than CSS? Perhaps in the Javascript that for some reason Chrome does not like?. @AliasIO @DaAwesomeP I haven't experienced a problem for the past several days. Everything seems to be resolved.

Atm, possible and available detection indicators that fit our needs is:\n\nIn the future it will be included a more complete \"X http header\"\n\nFor TYPO3 Neos (in the html tag): \nxmlns:typo3=\"http://www.typo3.org/ns/2012/Flow/Packages/Neos/Content/\"\nFor TYPO3 Flow (the X-Flow-Powered header):\nX-Flow-Powered:Flow/dev-master\n. Nice! thanks. \nI'll try to come back to update detection indicators when the new X-http-header will be available.\nCheers!\n. Yep! i tried but it seems to not work in some conditions. \nTYPO3 CMS was excluded also.\nIs the order of declaration apps affects that rule?\n. Tried on those websites and some of old versions of TYPO3 CMS (not listed here)\nhttp://typo3.org/\nhttp://neos.typo3.org/\nhttp://flow.typo3.org/\nhttp://ttree.ch/\nhttp://demo.vod.ttree.ch/\nhttp://www.wind.it/\nhttps://www.skrill.com/\nhttp://www.notebookcheck.net/\n. Ok, i'll check tomorrow. Furthermore, sites like forge.typo3.org shouldn't be recognized as TYPO3 CMS.\n. I have a fix to submit and an updated configuration with a simplified regexp for TYPO3 CMS detection.\nI'll submit an other pull request for the fix of the \"excludes rules\" processing.\n. ~~Would you like that i make a \"git rebase -i -> squash\" to have only one commit?~~\n. Exclude rules depends on #525 \nTested on local branch test_detect_and_exclude_fix (with #524,#525) with some mambo, joomla, TYPO3 CMS - Neos -Flow websites. Also with site that use the same domain (cookies)but for others application.\n. you're welcome! It's a great and useful tool!\nWhat's your release schedule?\n. Hey! twice double six! \nok :)\n. Ok. thanks. All the best!\n. Yes, was true with previous version of Wappalyzer. But shouldn't from the release 2.32 chrome and 3.0.11 firefox.\nThis CMS provided as SaaS leave me a little bit confused and like a little taste of \"d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\". I'll be very interested to see the source code.\n.  if you think this is not necessary nor useful, you may close this pull request.\n. ok, I will do.\n. Done.\n. Thank you ^^\n. OK.\nAs there is a space in the name, is what keeps it? or, it would be better to use an underscore for the filename ?\n. OK, thank you.\n. Should be added to exclude to not match TYPO3 CMS on forge.typo3.org (not a TYPO3 CMS).\nOtherwise, the other solution would to remove the Dectection \"headers\": {\"Set-Cookie\": \"fe_typo_user\"}, that is not the best indicators. Indeed, if the domain is the same of a TYPO3 CMS website the fe_typo_user is present.\nIMHO Better to relies on fileadmin|typo3conf folders that is always there (in all typo3 versions) anyway. What's your point of view?\n. Yep i think it would be better to do that. When we check the other apps used in the typo3.org, due to that cookie all are recognized as TYPO3 CMS\n. There is another problem.\nwhen a third party website use a cdn or fetch asset from outside: like:\nsrc=\"//typo3.org/fileadmin/t3org/images/\nit becomes irrelevant to use it for detection. Ultimately, it is probably best to leave only the meta and url indicators to identify TYPO3 CMS\nAnd nevermind to cheaters website that remove the hardcoded meta generator. :/\n$pageRenderer->addMetaTag('<meta name=\"generator\" content=\"TYPO3 ' . TYPO3_branch . ' CMS\"' . $endingSlash . '>');\n\nI'll push those changes and squash to have a clean single commit.\n. ",

Anyone with ideas how to do it?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. @SebastianLopienski  Take a look at some of the patterns I added.  https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/pull/1406  Can you send me some of the sites that you want detected?  . Could you provide a few URLs of sites using that CMS?   I think HomeDepot does, but I haven't looked in a few years.\n. Might need to be tweaked, the code aready has this in it.\n\n\"IBM WebSphere Commerce\": {\n            \"cats\": [\n                6\n            ],\n            \"implies\": \"Java\",\n            \"url\": \"/wcs/\",\n            \"website\": \"ibm.com/software/genservers/commerceproductline\"\n        },\n        \"IBM WebSphere Portal\": {\n            \"cats\": [\n                1\n            ],\n            \"headers\": {\n                \"IBM-Web2-Location\": \"\",\n                \"Itx-Generated-Timestamp\": \"\"\n            },\n            \"implies\": \"Java\",\n            \"url\": \"/wps/\",\n            \"website\": \"ibm.com/software/websphere/portal\"\n        },\n. Since you work for IBM, perhaps you could tell us what to add/change in JSON file?  I looked at the header information for Newark.com and didn't see anything that screamed Websphere.  Maybe the wcsstore value in this\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" media=\"all\" href=\"/wcsstore7.00.30995.27/jawr/jawrTmp/text/bundles/global.css\" />\n. Question, the JSON entry to be updated should be \"IBM WebSphere Commerce\", correct?\n. I think this REGEX is close for the HTML value in the JSON, but I'm sure someone could improve on my limited REGEX writing.\n<((link)|script)\\b[^>]*?\\b((href|src))\\s*=\\s*(?:\"((?:\\/wcsstore\\/\"|[^\"])*)\"|'((?:\\/wcsstore\\/.+'|[^'])*)')\n. I'm also not sure what I need to change to get valid JSON\n\"html\": \"<((link)|script)\\b[^>]*?\\b((href|src))\\s*=\\s*(?:\"((?:\\/wcsstore\\/\"|[^\"])*)\"|'((?:\\/wcsstore\\/.+'|[^'])*)')\",\n. The regex isn't 100% compliant with the JSON file, but here it is...\nhttps://github.com/craiglondon/Wappalyzer/commit/5f05f7d64ce0d60ea8b43a0d60508d857f63a151\n. Thanks for the feedback.\n. @dandare76 Could you provide some more information about this product?  URL?  Sample of where it is used?\n. https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/pull/1458. @boossy maybe check out this URL http://foswiki.org/About/ExampleSites. Issue with icon fixed, was ICO, now converted ICO to PNG.  Still only 16x16.. That's a lot of things to detect!!!.

Maybe?   How do suggest the pattern be improved to avoid that?. I guess I'll close this request until I can find more examples. Testable here   https://www.peopleperhour.com/  for pattern  <input type=\\\"hidden\\\" value=\\\"[a-zA-Z0-9]*\\\" name=\\\"YII_CSRF_TOKEN\\\" \\/>. Do you have a screenshot?  Which browser?. https://nolanlawson.com/2017/03/05/what-it-feels-like-to-be-an-open-source-maintainer/. That's an impressive tool!   I recommend!. Ouch.  Yeah 50 euros is overly expensive for the size of this project.. re: SailsJS -- is the header detection portion case sensitive?\nhttps://www.scoutlit.com/\nx-powered-by:Sails <sailsjs.org>\nThe pattern needs to be updated \"X-Powered-By\": \"^Sails$\"\nBut I wasn't sure if the X-Powered-By portion was case sensitive, please advise.\n. @AlexByte Do you have sharing of detections disabled or enabled?\n\n. @AlexByte I checked https://www.1c-bitrix.ru/ and it was detected by Wappalyzer.  I guess I'll wait a day or two to see if the metrics logged the detection.. Strange.  Can you provide a few examples of sites that use this CMS?   I detected it in Chrome on the CMS homepage.  But I don't know any other sites that use it.. @alexbyte ^^^. Can you provide some sample URLs of the false positives?. Check this issue, it might be what you are experiencing.  https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/issues/1262. @mattaningram I don't have an answer to that question.  Maybe Alias does. https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/pull/1449. Remove it entirely?   Not try to find another way to detect?. Hmm... good point.  It is a little harder to detect.\nhttp://elm-lang.org/examples/hello-html\nDoes Wappalyzer only detect on a global variable?  or can it be based on a method of that variable (see screenshot below)?\nElm.Main\n\n. Jvosin doesn't do merges into master. Aliasio does. @tibu. Yes please. You don't need a paid account.   Did you fork the repo then do a pull request?. @alvinbakker Looking at your GitHub profile, i do not see that you have forked Wappalyzer.. No problem. Everyone has their first time. Thanks @gadcam \n. @alexbyte.  I could you create a new PR with your proposed changes?  I won't have time to make one any time soon.. @Bradman381 Your commit has two different things in it.  Some for Medium, some of Meteor.. @Bradman381 no problem.  It's happened to me too. I would think it would be best practices to have a seperate pull request per lib.. Doesn't matter to me.  I thought the purpose of Wappalyzer was to detect things so I've written PR's to detect stuff that I have encountered or use.. I think plugin is the wrong term.  It's jQuery dependent.  We detect a Twitter Bootstrap JS.  It is also jQuery dependent.  Zurb probably is too but I haven't looked to confirm.. I concur. Can you provide links to where you have detected the false positive?. I'm not quite sure why there is a merge conflict.  I updated my fork to master, branched off master.. I will re-create the PR.. I'll push an update soon.\nWill match\n<script src=\"/assets/74f24751/yii.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"/assets/74f24751/yii.validation.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"/assets/74f24751/yii.activeForm.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://duw6wk4ou1qt.cloudfront.net/assets/5208050a/yii.js\"></script>. @jvoisin Ready for review again.  I match on assets/#######/yii.js. @jvoisin Updated again\n\"script\": [\n        \"\\/yii(?:\\\\.validation|\\\\.activeForm){0,1}\\\\.js\"\n      ],. @jvoisin What Regex tester do you usually use?  I usually use http://regexr.com/, but then usually I have to escape some stuff to make it compatible with JSON.. @jvoisin The pattern proposed above doesn't match\n<input type=\"hidden\" value=\"82f65c11d32bf867095aa35b683de4b8a5b3f49f\" name=\"YII_CSRF_TOKEN\" />, unless I'm doing something wrong.  Please advise.. Thank you.  I updated the pattern.. Re: Escaping forward slash\nWhen I use Regexr, it throws an error if I don't escape forward slash, why does it require them to be escaped but Wappalyzer does not?\nhttp://www.regexr.com\n//tags\\\\.tiqcdn\\\\.com/. @jvoisin Thanks for the reminder.  Added.. I there there is another commit pending that is trying to solve this issue as well?. The regex proposed above won't match /yii.js\nI have been using this to test \nhttps://regexr.com/3r03f\n. How about this as a compromise, a stricter match for when it is just yii.js and then your match for the yii.validation.js and yii.activeform.js\n(?:\\/assets\\/[a-zA-Z0-9]{8}\\/yii\\\\.*\\\\.js|\\/yii\\\\.(?:validation|activeForm)\\\\.js). Yes.  Shall I do a commit with what you proposed above?. ",

Wappalyzer doesn't issue any request, so it will only detect umbraco when you're browser this specific url, or when the generator is umbraco, or when the webpage's content matches powered by <a href=[^>]+umbraco,or a header X-Umbraco-Version, or a global Umbraco javascript variable, \u2026.

Can you provide some url of websites using this particular software?. You're awsome \u2665. It doesn't show the iPresta account here, but Prestashop instead.\nAlso, the goal of Wappalyzer is to display what technologies are used on a website, not to document them.. You're right, it works on Chrome :)\nIt seems that the website wasn't regenerated yet, this might explain why iPresta doesn't show up on it.. Be my guest :).

Your pull-request contains a lot of unrelated modification, it would be great if you could split them into different meaningful pull-requests. If you're too lazy, it's ok, your modifications looks cool to me :). Good catch :). Why would you want to detect something with a zero percentage of chance of actually being used?. I don't think that it's possible.. To have conditions like the one you're looking for.. This is expected, because there is no sign at all on your webpage that you're using php. Your website could legitimately be written in Python or whatever; WappAlyzer can't divine technologies ;). Then I fail to understand why #1395 is happening :/. A closing double-quote ;). Where can I check that this is working?. Yup, I wanted to website to test your rule, thank you :). Please fix the indentation :).

I'm quite sure that spamming the issues tracker every 12 hours is the best way to get this bug fixed, please keep going.. You might want to strip/compress it a bit :). Full-disclosure: @vishva-villvay is the author of Arc Reactor JS ;). About the tracking thingy, you can disable it in the preferences I think.. It would be nice to link the commit fixing the issue \u2665. Inheritance is supported, there is no need to have the PHP dependency if it's already implied by YII.. Of course it does, just click the link.. >  We do not charge for open-source repositories, you can add as many as you like. \n;). I'm currently running it on my fork, and it works fine.. It would be interesting to add CodeClimate too.. Why did you close this issue @AliasIO ? Shall I open a new one to discuss technologies that might be good removal candidates?. I'd like to propose to remove asymptix, that has not seen a single significant detection, and has 3 stars on github, and is here since fb7be84cfbb6b36ae3d68a147147571b9135d273, 18 months ago.. Too many requests. How can you tell apart Angular from Angular2?. Like this.. Sure, be my guest, it's not hard to implement a new detection :). You need to create a fork on github.\nYou should read the documentation about how to use github.. I didn't manage to find one.. @AlexByte  : \n\nAll environment variables up to and including three characters may occur in JavaScript generated by the Google Closure Compiler.\n\nYes ;). You might want to read the documentation to figure out how github is working.. You pull-request contains unrelated changed :/. The official website redirects to a dummy website.. Please provide a website to test your detection pattern.. Be our guest and do a pull-request, it's not that hard :). I do agree with @gadcam . Do you have a list of websites where this framework/application/\u2026 is deployed?. So I can implement its detection and tests it.. Why did you remove Lighty?. So what? There might still be people using it on the internet.. I'm not a big fan of circumventing security measures, especially with ugly hacks, such as javascript injection in a css file. I would prefer to wait until this is properly supported in browsers (even if it means adding links to the firefox/chrome/IE/lynx/\u2026 trackers).. We just have to add a warning in the documentation linking those issues before closing it, in order to reduce the number of people that will open new issues on this tracker about how broken the bookmarklet is, and how dreadful this project is because it used to work before.. The website isn't the \"right\" one, and it seems that the framework is used by nobody, expect @wahyufebriyana himself.. Feel free to open a pull-request :). Be our guest and implement it yourself.\nYou should at least provide some website to test the presence of those libs, and their official websites.. Be our guest and implement it yourself.\nYou should at least provide some website to test the presence of those libs, and their official websites.. And if you add wiki.jsp to it, it'll will detect it as Apache JSPWiki.\nThis is an expected behaviour for url-based detection, what were you expecting?. Please issue a pull-request instead of opening an issue.. Feel free to issue a pull-request, it's not that hard.\nIf you're too lazy or unable to submit one, please provide at least some information about Redux, like a few websites where it's used (to help people to check if the detection is working), its official website, \u2026. The documentation says:\n\nEdit src/apps.json.\nAdd a square icon in SVG format (preferred), or a 32x32 or larger PNG file to src/icons.\n\nIf you had open the src/apps.json file, you would have seen things like this:\njson\n        \"1C-Bitrix\": {\n            \"cats\": [\n                \"1\"\n            ],\n            \"headers\": {\n                \"Set-Cookie\": \"BITRIX_\",\n                \"X-Powered-CMS\": \"Bitrix Site Manager\"\n            },\n            \"html\": \"(?:<link[^>]+components/bitrix|(?:src|href)=\\\"/bitrix/(?:js|templates))\",\n            \"icon\": \"1C-Bitrix.png\",\n            \"implies\": \"PHP\",\n            \"script\": \"1c-bitrix\",\n            \"website\": \"http://www.1c-bitrix.ru\"\n        },\nIt shouldn't be hard to infer the majority of the fields. Some might be a bit non-obvious, but fortunately, the documentation has a great list of explanations about every single field.\nYou can of course test your pull-request, but since you're only adding an application, this shouldn't be necessary.\nAgain, if you're too lazy of unable to issue a pull-request for Redux, please provide at least some information about Redux, like a few websites where it's used (to help people to check if the detection is working), its official website, \u2026. I failed to see a possible way to detect Redux on those websites :/\nIt's not included with a recognisable filename, nor does it provide a redux object or anything similar :/. There are no <Provider> tags on your page, or is it me?. As state in the previously linked documentation, there is no way to match on Javascript methods, only on global variables.. hasOwn is prone to false positives I guess :/. Apparently, there is no reliable way to detect Redux.\nExcept if someone got a nice about how this, I think that we can close this issue, sorry @wesharehoodies . I can reproduce with Wappalyzer 4.1.0,  on Chromium Version 58.0.3029.110 Built on Ubuntu , running on Ubuntu 17.04 (64-bit), on the login page.\n. > webpack is a module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.\nI would say Miscellaneous.. Maybe we could use something else, like class=\"form-control\", class=\"glyphicon glyphicon- or class=\"sr-only?. Because we now have a 100% reliable way of detecting it, without losing much detection ratio.. Sure but can you give live websites, so we can test it, without deploying anything :). Likely because this website is using jquery.\nDo feel free to implement this yourself, as I don't plan to do it.. Because no one is paid to contribute; welcome to the open-source world. If you want something to happen, write the code yourself, or wait until someone does it for you. But being passive-aggressive isn't the way to go, at all.. Please issue a pull-request then :). The major difference is that a Wordpress hosted on wordpress.com is always up to date, while other may not ;). Feel free to open a pull-request for each of them it's not that complicated.\nOtherwise, please provide at least some ways to identify those libraries/frameworks (header, patterns, url, \u2026).. @AlexByte I tend to implement things that are useful at $DAYJOB, since we're using wappalyzer internally for \"various stuff\", I don't do 6 applications for free/fun/fame ;). Yes.\nLong answer: the extension will kicks on when the page is loaded. Since it's written in javascript, you can said that yes, javascript will be executed, but not in the dom context: a webpage won't be able to interact with Wappalyzer in other way than modifying the DOM, which will lead, at worst, to false-positives.\nI would still recommend to use a virual-machine to analyse malwares, just in case ;). Yes it can and does.. It can detect the version number and application, this doesn't mean that it detects every single one of them :)\nSometimes it's not possible to passively detect the version (or even the application).. Why the removal of the .svg in favour of .png logo?. You should rebase your pull-request on top of the master branch.. I don't know, since those applications are behind a login page. How do you know that they aren't?. It is a security issue, but there is not much that we can do about: it's written in the documentation that wappalyzer will (by default) report the technologies that are used on websites that you're browsing. Maybe a bigger warning would be nice? I don't know.\nWe don't crawl indexed sites, people are browsing the web, handing the data back.. I think that we can close this issue.. I'm for closing it, because there is nothing that we can do about it :/. Since this kind of application shouldn't be exposed on the internet, ever, I don't know how useful it is to add it to WappAlyzer.. It's a tool to build websites, why would you expose it on the internet? You can expose websites built with it, but not the builder itself, would you?. Please do provide websites built with it then :)\nIt would also be awesome if you had some ideas about how we could fingerprint it :). It might be possible to detect it by checking the presence of an object named fabric I guess, albeit this might be a bit too generic.. This might be a bit small and false-positive prone I think :/. This was changed the 31 July, you should wait for the next release, since the last one was created the 31th.. Ho, in the icon and in the popup? Excellent question :D. \nI can't reproduce your issue.. I'm currently using Wappalyzer 5.0.6, are you up to date?. Unfortunately, wtf= is too small and thus will lead to false-positives, thanks to javascript \"compressors\". As for the window.Wt property, unfortunately, Wappalyzer doesn't allow inspection of properties, only of globals.. This would be too short to, compressors are typically using 2 or 3 letters for variables :/\nWt-history-field might fit :). There is no way to access properties from Wappalyzer.\nThe Wt version object and the Wt-history-field one might be interesting though.. This is a design decision, feel free to ask @AliasIO about this :). It would have been nice to split this into two commits :). Please do rebase your commits on top of master, travis as been fixed \\o/. This is a serious issue, since we lose the ability to give automatic feedback to contributors :/. \u2665. Can you give addresses of websites using those products so people can review your commits to see if they are working, and if there are ways to improve them?\nThanks \u2665. Is this CMS really used?. I don't think that 2000 customers is a lot :/\nA growth of 100% per year means that last year, you had 1000 customers, and the previous one, 500. It's not that much to be honnest.. You can use (?:\u2026) for your groups ;). But I'll will (a bit) save some memory ;). You might want to rebase this. \"popular enough, with a significant (>1k stars on github, stuff like that) user base\" should be enough in my opinion.\nDisclaimer: I'm using Wappalyzer internally at work, and for our use-case, we only care about speed and detecting \"main\" web applications like wordpress, drupal, joomla, \u2026 and their versions.. Please do write it somewhere on the wiki so we can be consistent :). Yet another php framework with no user (1 star on github), written by the author of this pull-request.. I don't know much about the Iranian web, but it seems useful to me to know that you're the author of this framework, and that no one on github is using it.. Wappalyzer doesn't issue http requests on its own. Your issue might come from something else.. Damn, you're right, this is indeed an issue, sorry for the noise :/. This has been addressed in 3c707bd42. This issue can be closed.. There is little point in removing it, since someone else might issue a same pull-request to re-introduce the detection of Rakuten DBCore.. If there is no interest in adding this detection, this issue can be closed :). Do feel free to submit a pull request, it's pretty easy ;). What is the difference between SEO and marketing automation?. Apparently, aframejs is a popular javascript framework for doing VR stuff.\n@vyaspranjal33 Feel free to submit a pull-request, it's pretty simple :). The PR you're referring to is 1776.\nYou forgot to add a way to detect aframejs, you might want to re-read the documentation about how to do this.\nOn a side note, the \"implies\": \"JavaScript\", thingy is wrong: javascript is a feature from the browser, not a framework or anything like this.\nI don't have any powers on this repository, I'm not able to merge anything, I'm just a contributor.. It's ok, we're not in a hurry, you have the time to learn and to do it on your own, it's written on your website that you \"I love 2 learn & Teach Open source Tech Stuffs\", this is a nice opportunity :). I already said that on a previous review:\n\nYou need to add a way to detect aframs.js.\nFor example, if you take a look at the hello world example, you can see that the src attribute of the script tag contains the string aframe-master.js. maybe it's worth investigating if it's always named like this.\nThere is also the presence of the AFRAMD and aframeStats javascript variables.. Or maybe those are false-positives :/. haha, people are amazing, rogue extensions that are mining stuff :'). Cool kids aren't using IRc anymore?. It's ok, I'll move to IRC ASAP \u2665. Hello @phonicmouse \n\nsince you know javascript, what about submiting a pull-request to support prism.js?\nIt's pretty easy, and everything is explained in the (nice) documentation :). This was done in 7790c29e\nThis issue can be closed.. Hello @mtemel123  \nsince you know javascript, what about submiting a pull-request to support DevExtreme?\nIt's pretty easy, and everything is explained in the (nice) documentation :). You pull-request constains unrelated changes :/\nAlso, matching on the presence of a Elm variable will be prone to false-positives, due to javascript compressors.. I can't reproduce too: Cherokee webserver is detected.. This is been done in 9eaf963f. This issue can be closed.. Can you please show us the different outputs?\n(You can surround code blocks with triple backticks (```) to make them more readable). This is a duplicate of #1605 I think.. Damn, this is a duplicate of #1432 sorry for the noise.. Are you sure that you don't have an other extension injecting some coinhive widgets into every webpage?. Maybe, do you?\nYou can check Chrome's tasks manager to see if something weird is going on.. Maybe it's a false-positive on our side, I don't know.\nDo you have other extensions installed in your browser?. Can you disabled them all and check if Wappalyzer  is still detecting coinhive?\nIf it's the case, enable them one by one until it shows up again :). Wonderful :/\n@961Group please do signal it on the Chrome store and on Mozilla, in order to prevent people from being infected too.. We should report this to Adblocker Ultimate, they might be detected by other tools too.. Wonderful \u2665. A web-hoster with a heavily outdated wordpress as landing page, and a broken certificate on the signup one, for a phony web hoster. I wouldn't merge this.. @AlexByte It's ok, it was squashed by @AliasIO :). It's already done.. Fantastic \u2665\nShall we have a \"cryptominer\" category?. Yes we should \u2665\nThis issue is related to #1820 . I opened a pull-request about this.. It looks like both are scams.\nMinero.pw isn't even working apparently :/. Have you checked that they aren't using the same code by the way?. Please don't screw up the indentation :/. It would be nice if you could split this in an other pull-request then \u2665. Purr-fect \u2665. 1. No, I don't think so\n2. I don't think it's worth adding a category for this (Also, who the hellish-fuck uses this kind of garbage? No one cares about accessibility or what?!). It seems nice to be able to write CSS with less hassle, but unfortunately, I'm not really able to use javascript in my default browser, so I simply can't use those websites. Running your system server-side seems like a good idea, but as soon as your trying to run it in my browser, you're making my online life a nightmare :/\nSorry for the harsh word, but from my usage point of view, you're breaking the web </3. React and webpack are already detected, but do feel free to investigate other ways to improve their respective detection.. Well, how would you detect the presence of react and webpack? I don't see anything fingerprintable.. Unfortunately, this is not how Wappalyzer is working.. There is a logo: . Care to share a webpage to test this? It should work.. Do feel free to rename your pull-request :). @AliasIO ^ this is up to you :). Github pages is kind of a CDN: you put your data there, and it's served as web-content. But I agree that it's a bit more than that :/. I don't know, I guess prefer to only have the major/minor numbers, instead of \"WMF edition\", or \"pre-beta\" or \"-git\" in the version string.. Shall we add a travis job that is building and checking packages?. What about something like:\njson\n\"js\": {\n  \"jQuery.fn.jquery\": \"([0-9a-z-]+)\"\n}\nOr are we going to match on anything else than a version number?. @AliasIO How about this instead, like @gadcam proposed:\njson\n\"js\": {\n  \"jQuery.fn.jquery\": \"([0-9a-z-]+)\\\\;version:1\"\n}\nI would like to keep the object dereferencing separate from the regexp:\n- This improve clarity, thus reducing the number of errors and improving readability/maintenance\n- It makes sense at a semantic level: on one hand, we have a javascript object that we're inspecting, on the other, we have a regexp trying to match something.\nDo we want to permit regexps that don't have any matching group by the way? I don't think we should.\nMaybe this one is a bit overkill:\njson\n\"js\": {\n  \"jQuery.fn.jquery\": {\n    \"version\": \"([0-9a-z-]+)\"\n  }\n}. It makes sense.. Or write something like\njson\n\"js\": {\n  \"someSoftware.enterprise\": \".\\\\;version:Enterprise\"\n}. I can't reproduce either. What version are you using?. Thank you \u2665. Wow, this was a massive commit :/. @anka09 Please do provide more information: What are elixir and phoenix? What websites are using them? Do you know how we could fingerprint them? \u2026. Unfortunately, there is none :/. Are you sure that _0x69dd isn't a random pattern?. I can't reproduce on the website, but I've got the same results in my browser :D. Pull-requests are often merged in a single batch before a release. It's not uncommon that this takes something like two weeks :). Fuck, I commited on my master branch. Please do remove the icon too :). Why do you want to add a check for the signin pattern? If someone goes there, odds are that this person knows what's running on the website anyway ;). It's detected here, I can't reproduce your issue.. I don't think that there are many setups where Werkzeug is used without Flask, are there?. No one is using bootstrap-ui. Me neither.. It would be even cooler with some transparency \u2665. Because Wappalyzer can detect versions too ;). I don't understand your issue. \nCan you please give an example of what you're trying to do?. Are you sure that this is Wappalyzer-related?. Care to provide a list of  websites that are using it?. So what? People will still be used Piwik for months (if not years) to come, no need to be aggressive/sarcastic.. It seems that Woosa is based on Wordpress, why exclude it?. I do mean react, but my example website is an internal mattermost instance :/. No icon :/. Travis is red for reasons unrelated to this PR :/. Its repository says:\n\nGazelle is a web framework geared towards private BitTorrent trackers.\n\nIt looks more like a search engine for torrents than a framework in the classical sense of it.. Be my guest ;). Is Google Tag Manager the same things than Google Analytics?. And nope, no logo :/. ```\nError: Cannot find module '../node_modules/file-type'\n    at Function.Module._resolveFilename (module.js:469:15)\n    at Function.Module._load (module.js:417:25)\n    at Module.require (module.js:497:17)\n    at require (internal/module.js:20:19)\n    at Object.

Do feel free to read the documentation to add it yourself :). It seems that this application only has 3 stars on github.. It's doesn't look very popular :/. Yes, since both are used. But we should remove the React one, and keep React.version.. The project doesn't seem to be super popular :/. I took at look at the website of the company behind pars elecom portal:\nIt has only 109 customers and 71 portals. This does seems to be super few to me. I don't think it's worth including the detection of \"pars elecom portal\".. Meh, I need to sleep :/ Yeah, those are the domains.. It seems that the CI is drunk.\nError: The pattern uses more capture groups than needed. Use non-capturing groups where appropriate.\nSlick: script: (:?/([\\d.]+))?/slick(?:\\.min)?\\.js\\;version:\\1. Well, we don't have a \"load balancer\" category :/\nCan you even use ELB without using anything else from AWS?. You might want to rebase on the master :). Err, I thought I was an anchor. Wtf.. You can do it yourself, everything is documented, and it's not that's hard :). I can't reproduce with the browser extension, so it seems to be a NodeJS driver related issue.. reactiv.ru isn't a Magento.\nI think that we can trash the last pattern, since it's a pretty common one. I don't know about static/_requirejs though.. What version of wappalyzer are your using? I'm guessing that you're using the nodejs driver?\nAlso, lease format your issue  to increase its readability \u2665. Do feel free to close this issue then :). It is working correctly. If you check the version of JQueryUI on the first website, you'll see that it's c0ab71056b936627e8a7821f03c044aec6280a40. You can check this by typing jQuery.ui.version in the console of your browser.. What about merging it directly into app.json then?. This can be closed in my opinion.. This will still yield false-positives dues to html compressors/cdn/whatever. Shouldn't we simply remove this regexp?. Thank you for writing ReDoc \u2665. I fail to understand the term \"Digital User Experience\", and the wikipedia article about \"customer experience\" is full of citation needed. Can you please elaborate?. > Swiper - is the free and most modern mobile touch slider with hardware accelerated transitions and amazing native behavior. \nHardware accelerated transition effects in my browser, \u2026 kids those days.. This website you're providing is using jimdo. We don't have detection for \"1&1 MyWebsite\" in wappalyzer, so this is an perfectly normal and expected behaviour.. What kind of fix do you propose?\nA lot of websites that are using bootstrap are using something like bootstrap.1337.js I think :/\nOr maybe it's a typo on wappalyzer's side, and it should be bootstrap-1337.js instead?. This is a bad idea.. Because ?v= doesn't give the flat-ui version. Maybe ?ver ?. This can be tested here. Perl should be detected via the headers too:\njson\n    \"Perl\": {\n      \"cats\": [\n        27\n      ],\n      \"headers\": {\n        \"Server\": \"\\bPerl\\b(?: ?/?v?([\\\\d.]+))?\\\\;version:\\\\1\"\n      },\n      \"icon\": \"Perl.png\",\n      \"website\": \"http://perl.org\"\n    },. Vue is detected here (Wappalyzer 5.4.14 on Chrome).\nYou can check wappalyzer's documentation here if you want to improve it :). It's detecting Vue here.\n@lloydjatkinson what version of wappalyzer are you using?. On http://crimson.netlify.com/ there is no Vue object, nor an inclusion of a script named vue-something. How could wappalyzer detect the usage of Vue ?. This possible detection is blocked by #2450 . With only 475 stars, the project doesn't look very popular/used :/\nThe author of this pull-request is also the author of slim.js . Are you using the latest version of wappalyzer? I recently fixed some Yii false positives..

This won't fly, because of javascript compressors, that might insert the string yii anywhere in the filename of the script.. Please don't match on yii.js. The others are fine I guess.. What about using this instead:\ndiff\n+      \"script\": [\n+        \"/yii\\\\.(?:validation|activeForm)\\\\.js\"\n+      ],\nThis won't cause false-positives, and will work on a larger number of websites, because not everyone is using the /assets\\/[a-zA-Z0-9]{8}\\/ form.. It would be nice if you could split the angular thingy into an other PR.. You can do it yourself, it's not that complicated :). gitbook.io is issuing a 301 to gitbook.com here.\nIt's ok, we can keep gitbook.io. I issued the same PR in #2344 :). Since you're a coder, you can add it yourself, it's not that complicated :). Is this a common practise to include a script file without its extension?\nI'm not a big fan of detection sweetalert2 as soon at the word sweetalert2 is present somewhere in the url of a script :/. I don't think that this is GDPR-compliant, and since odds are that you're selling personal informations from EU citizen, you must comply with it.\nAlso, the privacy policy doesn't explain what data are collected, what they are used for, with whom they are shared, how and under what condition, \u2026 it's also non-obvious how to opt-out of the collection process (it should be as easy to opt-in than to opt-out).. The website zrlog.com isn't working here.. It seems that the project isn't that popular :/\n(also @94fzb is the lead dev). Bunto has 8 stars and @SuriyaaKudoIsc is its main author..

As shown here, mainly:\n\nWebcams\nTag Managers - only one entry, that could be moved to \"misc\"\nPaywalls\n\nMore might come as we remove unused entries, like the ones in \"Printers\", as done in #2408.

Please add ways to detect your application.. Do you have an estimation of how many people are using your product? Because I've only found 159 instances of it.. I can't reproduce this behaviour with Wappalyzer 5.5.2 and Chromium  68.0.3440.75. Here, only Google web server is matching.. Either github is drunk and didn't get the memo (unlikely), or scrutinizer is wasted and forgot to send it.. Hello,\nNo need to call us stupid, everybody is acting is good faith to improve Wappalyzer. What exactly do you want us to change? There is not a single occurrence of \"Persian\" nor \"Farsi\" in its source code :)\nThe Persian localization is identified as fa in Wappalyzer, as specified in ISO 639-1:2002.. Wappalyzer.com isn't managed via this repository, you might want to send an email directly to @AliasIO because he's the one behind it.\nFor the record, the changelog is likely autogenerated based on the merged pull-requests :). The website doesn't send any akamai-related headers for Wappalyzer to fingerprint, so this is an expected behaviour.. Wappalyzer is a passive tool, active checks are out of its scope.. I can't reproduce this with firefox.. Nope: wappalyzer doesn't do requests on its own.. Why would you run this with sudo!?. We'll need more details.. Wappalyzer detects technologies used by the website. It's normal that it doesn't detect \"social links\".\nWhat do you mean \"only some technologies\"? What are the ones that you have, the ones that are expected, \u2026. I can reproduce the issue (I guess \"Zoho Crm website\" is https://www.zoho.com/crm/)\nWappalyzer's website:\n\nThe latest version (5.5.3) of the extension on Chrome:\n\nI think that the bug is on the website's side: the wordpress detection is completely wrong. Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do, except waiting to @AliasIO to fix this on the website :). Can you please show a couple of websites that are hosting it?. I'm a bit afraid of the performance issues :/. I'll be merged when @AliasIO does it :). This PR can be checked against https://www.emergedv.com/. The two forms are valid:\nthe first one will show matches (either the first, or the second one) as the version number, the second will show 4 as the version number if there is a match, 5 otherwise.. No: \\1 is a backreference in the regex world, and since the regexp is embeded in json, the \\ has to be escaped, hence \\\\1. Unfortunately, html-based detection has to start with < :). I can't reproduce this behaviour here, with Wappalyzer 5.5.5 and Chromium:\n. I can reproduce on Firefox and the latest (5.5.5) wappalyzer. Keep in mind that this is detecting docker by side effect. I will detect some occurrences of docker, but most of them will flight under the radar.. @AliasIO is usually merging PR by batches once a month :). Wappalyzer doesn't perform web requests, so this method is out of scope :/\nBut thank you for the suggestion \u2665. What do you mean by \"completely different platform\"? As far as wappalyzer's concerned, it looks like a simple version update from here.. Can you please add the implies fields accordingly then ?. The presence of Volusion implies the technological stack beneath it ;). Volusion 2 is not written in ASP ?. You're adding much more that only Shopline :/. Please don't touch src/drivers/npm/npm-shrinkwrap.json :). Care to share the url so we can pinpoint the issue?\nAre you using a Nop.customer cookie in your application?. Just do a dummy commit :). Shouldn't we test this someone in the testsuite?. Again, how do you feel about having this in the testsuite?. Feel free to issue pull-request to implement the detection of everything you linked, the documentation is here.\nI think that it's unlikely that anyone will do it for you, and odds are that this issue will be closed with a WONTFIX soon\u2122.. For the record, there are several PR aiming at improving performances: #2548 #2547 #2546 #2544 #2543 #2542 and #2541.. Don't you want to also \"Document how to easily profile wappalyzer's extension, under both firefox and chrome\"?. I seems that nobody is using this CMS.. I don't think that it qualifies as a popular software :/. I don't have the commit bit, only @AliasIO can merge PR, and he's usually doing it every other month.. As soon as @AliasIO does his monthly PR-merging. He's the only one with the commit bit :/. SVG are better than png, if you want to update the logo, please keep it in svg.. Wordpres.org says respectively 400 and 600 active installations, this isn't a lot.. A pull-request is welcome if you can come with a way to tel them apart.. Pull-requests are more than welcome.\nMoreover:\n1. http://106.14.150.161:9200/ \u2192 This is a webpage with only json on it\n2. We have no rules for awstats, but one can always check the footer\n3. I added a rule for cpanel in #2616\n4. MyBB is detected\n5. I'm not a big fan of detecting admin panels on the internet, so I guess it's more a feature than a bug\n6. We have no rules for it, feel free to open a PR to add some\n7. Same as the previous point\n8. Also same as 6.. There is no detection for webzi in wappalyzer currently.. Feel free to issue a pull-request to fix his :). Can you please share a website url so we can easily reproduce your issue?\nAlso, how are you expecting Wappalyzer to detect the \"jsdoc\"? Applying a multiline-regexp to every single javascript file doesn't sound like a great idea :/. We don't have a nice way to match on this unfortunately.\nAlso, it'll likely be too false-positive prone.. Navigate to what site?. I can't reproduce this :/\nDo you have any errors in the console?. Only 400 stars . There is one about popularity, yes:\n\nOnly widely used applications should be added. When creating a pull request, please include ten or more links to websites that use the application, a GitHub page with at least 1,000 stars or anything that will help establish the size of the user base. . Please do provide the address of your website so that we can understand what's going on.. I can't reproduce your issue on Chrome nor Firefox.. Are you using the latest version of Wappalyzer?. Because those meta tags have no names, only content and property.. This should go in a separate pull-request in my opinion.. This should be addressed in another pull request.. This should go in another pull-request.. This should go in another pull-request.. This should go in another pull-request.. This should be \"X-Generated-By\": \"UMI.CMS\",. This should be \"X-CMS-Version\": \"^([0-9.]+)$\\\\;version:\\\\1\". No it's not.. Sure, but tightening the regular expression doesn't hurt and might prevent false-positives.. Yup, I forgot a +, sorry :/. Please use $CloudCart LLC^ instead, to speed up the matching.. This will produce a lot of false positives.. I don't think that the file build.min.css is specific to Cloudcart.. This will match links mentioning CloudCart, I think it's false-positive prone.. Please use /cloudcart-assets/ instead:\n- no need to escape the - character\n- adding / will mitigate some false-positives.\n\nYou could even match on /cloudcart-(?:assets|storage)/ if you want better coverage ;). I don't understand your question. Deprecated where? The meta field isn't in Wappalyzer, and since there is an \"author\" field on the application, we don't care if it's deprecated, as long as it can serve as a marker to detect the underlying technology used ;). Feel free to put the env field wherever you want, the order doesn't matter in a dictionary in js.. This could be used to fingerprint the version. Care to add the necessary boilerplate to do it?. Sure, I could do it if you want, but it's specified (although it lacks of good example), and you can grep for version in the src/apps.json file for examples, if you're planning to continue to contribute to wappalyzer. Worst case, I'll likely do it in a couple of days if you prefer :). The env thingy is about global javascript variables, I fail to understand your question :/. What do you want to shove in it by the way?. There is no need to escape the / character.. Please use \"^keycdn-engine$\" to speed up a bit the matching :). It seems that the size of the anti-csrf token is fixed, so \"<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" value=\\\"[a-zA-Z0-9]{4}\\\" name=\\\"YII_CSRF_TOKEN\\\" \\/>\" will be a bit better :). What about \"<!\\\\[CDATA\\\\[YII-BLOCK-(?:HEAD|BODY-BEGIN)\\\\]\" instead?\nIt will go a bit faster ;). What about \"jquery\\\\.fancybox\\\\.pack\\\\.js$\" instead?. debuggex is pretty great, but here the change is trivial enough to be mentally processed :). It should be \"<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" value=\\\"[a-zA-Z0-9]{40}\\\" name=\\\"YII_CSRF_TOKEN\\\" \\/>\", I forgot a zero, sorry :). This should be 100%, shouldn't it?. Care to prefix the regexp with ^?. Please state the regexp with ^.. I think that you can drop the (?:/)?\\\\?[A-Za-z0-9+/=]* ending part of the regexp, since it doesn't improve the fingerprinting.. Care to add ^ if/when possible?. Feel free to add ^ and/or $ is possible ;). Please prefix the regexp with ^ if possible.. I fail to see where the CMS is described on your website. It only says that you're using it, but that's it.. Please add ^ in front of the regexp to speed it a bit if possible.. Hence my \"if possible\".\nA lot of CND are giving url starting with //, so everyone uses them, maybe kontactify does the same.. I think that this will generate some false-positives, because odds are that every website using client-side highlighting is using a script called highlight.js :/. Please prefix it with a / to reduce the number of false-positives.. Please use \"script\": \"/harvan\\.(?:min\\.)js$\" if possible.\nThe current rule will likely trigger false positives :). What about using ^bablic$ instead?. Please split this regex in an array.. Please put JetshopData into an env object.. Don't you think that sr-jetshop-wp is too false-positive prone? Can't you refine it a bit?. I'm a bit afraid that this will cause too much false-positives :/. Please use \"X-Powered-By\": \"^TotalCode$\" instead :). Not for javascript packers or base64 ;). I don't think that it's useful to add the [A-Za-z-_0-9/]+, collisions with X-Imperia-Live-Info are super unlikely.. Please use ^ at the begining of your regexp and $ at the end to speed up a bit the detection :). I don't think that it's useful to escape slashes, is it?. It's apparently possible to get the version of imperia via this header (see here for example.\nDo you mind adding this?. Please add ^ and $ to your regexp if possible.. Please add a terminal $ if possible :)\nI guess you could even write something like \"script\": \"^//analytics\\\\.freespee\\\\.com\\\\/js\\\\/external\\\\/fs\\\\.js$\",. Since patterns aren't case-sensitive, you could factorise them in something like \"<[^>]+id=\\\"phenomic(root)?\\\"\",. This can be rewritten/simplified as:\n\"script\": \"https?://server\\\\.livehelp\\\\.it\\\\/widgetjs\\\\/[0-9]{5}\\\\/[0-9]{1,3}\\\\.js\",\nWould it be possible to prepend a ^ to the regexp by the way?. \"script\": \"^https?://server\\\\.livehelp\\\\.it/widgetjs/[0-9]{5}/[0-9]{1,3}\\\\.js\" is wonderful :). Regexp aren't case-sensitive.. This would match stuff like https://mywebsite.com/my-article-about-debugbar/script/bootstrap.js.. This will generator false-positives with javacript compressors.. This will generator a lot of false positives.. Could it be ^noCommerce$ instead, or something like that?. Then please use ^noCommerce$ :). What about \"^Incomedia WebSite X5 (\\\\w+ [\\\\d.]+)\\\\;version:\\\\1\" to speed a bit the matching?. Please use https if possible \u2665. Uusing https instead of http is a good security practise :). Won't this be prone to false-positives due to javascript/html compressors?. The MauticTrackingObject thingy would be better I think :)\nCheck the documentation about the env JSON field. Please use \"generator\": \"^hinzacms$\", to speed up a bit the matching :). Please do use https, since it's way cooler\u2122 than http.. Please use ^Storeden$ instead, to speed up a bit the matching :). If it's the case, then you could add version information instead :). Please use \"generator\": \"^PHPoole$\"instead to speed up a bit the matching.. The certificate is broken for this host.. Please use a 64x64 icon, there is no need to use a bigger one.. Please use\"X-Powered-By\": \"^Amber$\"instead, to speed up a bit the matching.. Please usehttpsinstead \u2665. Feel free to remove them comment ;). Do feel free to remove the comment :). This is wrong: javascript is a \"feature\" from your browser, not something that is present due to the usage ofaframe.js.. You need to add a way to detectaframs.js`.\nFor example, if you take a look at the hello world example, you can see that the src attribute of the script tag contains the string aframe-master.js. maybe it's worth investigating if it's always named like this.. There is also the presence of the AFRAMD and aframeStats javascript variables.. Laravel already implies PHP.. Please use \"X-Akaunting\": \"^Free Accounting Software$\" if possible.. Isn't akaunting a bit too new (it's only 3 months old) to have a significant number of users?. This is unrelated to your pull-request :/. Please open a pull-request per topic to ease the review \u2665\n(And to speed up their merging). No, aframejs doesn't imply PHP at all.. This is a placeholder from aframe, it won't be used in production I think.. Why a 50% confidence? I think you can remove this :). This is wrong, url is for the current url.. I don't think that this actually exists\u2026. It would be nice to narrow this a bit more if possible.. Would it be possible to use \"X-Akaunting\": \"^Free Accounting Software$\" instead?. How would this look like? Can you actually set several cookies inside a single Set-Cookie header?. ```\njvoisin@mim 12:22 ~ curl https://www.facebook.com -I\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nX-XSS-Protection: 0\nPragma: no-cache\nCache-Control: private, no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate\nX-Frame-Options: DENY\nStrict-Transport-Security: max-age=15552000; preload\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\nExpires: Sat, 01 Jan 2000 00:00:00 GMT\nSet-Cookie: fr=0utGfGF1ho04AU122..BaBYv6.ud.AAA.0.0.BaBYv6.AWUx6yQT; expires=Thu, 08-Feb-2018 11:22:34 GMT; Max-Age=7776000; path=/; domain=.facebook.com; secure; httponly\nSet-Cookie: sb=-osFWsw8cvg5m6sNBEE9aN1d; expires=Sun, 10-Nov-2019 11:22:34 GMT; Max-Age=63072000; path=/; domain=.facebook.com; secure; httponly\nVary: Accept-Encoding\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\nX-FB-Debug: ymZ5XMIeSzwroDHBm1w+vUVGupOvjhtHLTo0qmQvNqqhMj/tu9DNpF0Bjem9tdyHFh8fQAnYCTUfIDUPrkAyeg==\nDate: Fri, 10 Nov 2017 11:22:34 GMT\nConnection: keep-alive\njvoisin@mim 12:22 ~ \n```\nIt seems to me that the header Set-Cookie is sent twice. Semi-colons are to separate attributes.. Apparently, it's deprecated, I don't know if we want to support this syntax :/. Can you use something like \"Server\": \"^ArvanCloud$\" instead?. I think you meant ^sap\\\\.ui$ :). arg.. Damn, you're right!. Microsoft never ceases to amaze me :/. I like the ^https?:// at the begining :/. Please do let it in the script thingy :)\nWhy did you removed it in the first place?. What about /docsify/ instead?. What about \"Set-Cookie\": \"^cnv_session\" instead?. How about \"//minero\\\\.cc/lib/minero(?:-miner|-hidden)?\\\\.min\\\\.js\", instead?. Have you checked if there is a way to detect this via env too?. This is too prone to false-positives in my opinion.. What about \"generator\": \"^Hexo$\" instead?. I think that \"Powered by <a href=\\\"https?://hexo\\\\.io/?\\\"[^>]*>Hexo</\" is prettier :3. Please add a way to get the version then \u2665. Regexp are case-insensitives :). Please add a ? after the space, since it might not be always present.. Please add version detection too :). Exactly :). I think that using /gxp\\\\.js might reduce the number of false-positives :). Please add a leading / to reduce the number of false-positives.. What about clobs.data instead, to reduce the possible false-positives due to js compressors?. Please use https \u2665. Maybe getpelican\\\\.com, just in case. Well, now it's false-positive prone, because if I'm having a link to getpelican.com, my site will be detected as using Pelican :/. What about \"Set-Cookie\": \"^i_like_gitea=\" instead?. Please add \\\\;version:\\\\1 so that wappalyzer can get the version. Would it be possible to add ^ and $ to the regexp?. Please remove this, this is way too false-positive prone.. Can't we ditch the first one?. Please use https \u2665. Even better: \"powered by <a href=\\\"[^\"]+getpelican\\\\.com\" ;). Please use \"Server\": \"^CDN77-Turbo$\" instead :). Maybe something like \"(?:/([\\\\d.]+))/?vue(?:\\\\.min)?\\\\.js\\\\;version:\\\\1\" instead?. What about \"<[^>]+(?:https?:)?//(?:assets|downloads|images|videos)\\\\.(?:cfassets\\\\.net|contentful\\\\.com)\" instead? It should be a bit quicker.. What about \"/metrika(?:-watch)?/watch\\\\.js$\" instead?. Please use \"generator\": \"^Docusaurus$\". What about this instead:\njson\n\"html\": \"<[^>]+(?:https?:)?//(?:assets|downloads|images|videos)\\\\.(?:ct?fassets\\\\.net|contentful\\\\.com)\",. Why are you using a 90% confidence?. Also, since Prestashop already implies PHP, there is no need to mention in here if you want ;). Please use https \u2665. There is no matching group for version. Plus, what's the point of opt-in? Looks completely broken to me.. This can be factorized as \"\\/yii\\\\.(?:validation|activeForm)\\\\.js\". I think that this might be prone to false-positives :/. Isn't the name MakeShop?. Please use \"generator\": \"^Fastcommerce$\" if it's possible.. Ok :). That's the plan, to reduce false-positive due to javascript compressors.. Are you meaning something like this ?\njson\n\"script\": [\n  \"/assets/[a-zA-Z0-9]{8}\\/yii\\\\.js$\",\n  \"/yii\\\\.(?:validation|activeForm)\\\\.js\"\n]. Sure \u2665. If Zone.root is always available, there is no need to have Zone as well.. Why are you removing this?. Would it be possible to add ^ and $ to the regexp?. Would it be possible to add ^ and $ to the regexp?. Please specify https for the url.. This one is too false-positive prone :/. Please remove it :). What about \"url\": \"\\\\.byinti\\\\.com\" instead?. Wouldn't it be simpler to write something like that instead:\njson\n\"script\": [\n  \"\\\\.adplan7\\\\.com/\",\n  \"(?!/o)..\\\\.advg\\\\.jp/\\\\;version:\\\\1?7:\"\n]\nI'm a bit afraid that the second pattern will lead to false-positives :/. Please use \"headers\": { \"X-Powered-By\": \"^Brightspot$\" }, if possible. You can use this instead:\njson\n\"script\": {\n  \"Raven.config\": \"\",\n  \"ravenOptions.whitelistUrls\": \"\"\n}. This is wrong: one can use sentry without using Django.. Sure :). Google Analytics' backend is likely written in Java, but it doesn't mean that the site using it is written in Java too.. Why is this wrong?. What about ^(:?Microsoft-)?IIS(?:/([\\\\d.]+))?\\\\;version:\\\\1\" instead? I'm afraid that only matching on IIS will trigger some false-positives, but maybe it's just me being overly cautious.. I think that the .jp extension is specific to Japan.. This is a bit too false-positive prone.\nMoreover, the line above is already detecting utag.js, under the tealium folder: this should be enough.. This is an \"Identity Resolution & Data Onboarding | Real-Time Marketing\" tool, not a \"tag manager\" one.. Please add signalData to the js detection method too :). How about ^//nexus.ensighten.com/ instead?. What about \"^//assets\\\\.adobedtm\\\\.com\" instead?. Sure, but utag.js is way too short (this kind of name could be generated by a javascript minimizer) to use it as a viable mean of fingerprinting.. You're absolutely right, my bad :). Maybe 32 or 10. I think that \"\\.criteo\\.(?:com|net)/\" should be enough :). Don't forget to escape the dots ;). I think that considering any javascript file served from a criteo domain as an indicator of criteo's presence isn't unreasonable. Moreover, this future-proofs at bit the signature :). Unfortunately, this is a bit too false-positive-prone, because of javascript-compressors :/. It just looks if the property exists :). If you remove the go.js thingy from script, it's ready to be merged :). You can push on your branch, it'll update this one :). What about <a href=\"https://github.com/ruibaby/halo\" target=\"_blank\">Proudly published with Halo instead, to reduc false-positives?. Could this be moved in \"js\" instead?. This one is too false-positive prone.. What about \"generator\": \"^Halo$\" instead?. Wow, this is a lot of different categories, are you sure that they do all apply?. This issue is that wappalyzer's popup will be filled with PlatformOS in different categories on websites using it :/. What about \"<div class=(\"|')[^\\1]*elementor\" instead?\nOr even \"<div class=(\\\"|')[^\\\"']*elementor\" because there is no need to be overkill.. Their website is mentioning https://api.louassist.com/v1/ instead.. What about \"generator\": \"^Gatsby(?: ([0-9.]+))?$\\\\;version:\\\\1\" instead?. What about \"script\": \"/tiny_?mce(?:\\\\.min)?\\\\.js\", instead?. I don't think that using \"LOU\" implies that the website is using Django :). Nor React. :). What about \"generator\": ^\"Website Creator by hosttech$\", instead?. What about \"X-SERVER\": \"^BIGBANGSHOP\" instead?. You can use something like this: \"html\": \"<style[^>]*data-styled(?:-components)?[\\\\s\\\"]\", I think.. It would also be super-nice to add the version detection, with <style[^>]+data-styled-version=\\\"([0-9)+)\\\"\\\\;version:\\\\1 \u2665. There is a small typo, it's ] and not ), otherwise it's perfect :). Feel free to change * for a + :). Why do you need to exclude those?. Can you add $ at the end?. Please use /rokoInstabot\\\\.js to reduce the (unlikely) false positives :). Please use \"CMS-Version\": \"^(.+)$\\\\;version:\\\\1;confidence:0\" to reduce the number of false-positives.. Can you add a ^ to the regexp?. Please use \"^(?:https?:)?//tags\\\\.tiqcdn\\\\.com/\" instead :). Wait, you're embedding a png, inside a .svg? What's the point of doing so?. I disagree: the point of wappalyzer is to detect as many technologies as possible. Moreover, if you're using all of those services at the same time, odds are that you're doing things terribly wrong.. I don't think that users will go on your website, to see if a site is using cloudflare or not.\nIn what way would removing the exclusion be confusing?. Wappalyzer isn't a software tailored for your customers. Speaking of which, you didn't provide any metrics demonstrating HiCDn qualifies for a inclusion in Wappalyzer.. This is false-positive prone, due to javascript compressors: please remove it.. This looks wrong to me, and also false-positive prone. What about mithril\\\\.js$ instead?. What about using dayjs.millisecond to reduce the number of possible false-positives?. Is this super-duper-\u00fcber-mega-giga-long regexp really necessary? Couldn't we use only the important elements instead?. This is too false-positive-prone, please remove it.. This is also too false-positive prone.. There is no need to add implies that could be detected by other means.. This is too false-positive-prone, please remove it.. The website isn't working :/. Ho, right, it's working. I had some invalid redirection when I checked.. I'm a bit concerned of the performance impact of this :). The issues is that some websites are using javascript compressors :). I mean, javascript compressors that are operating on a semantic level, like Google's one, that are changing the variable's names, so odds are that some might randomly create one named dayjs in the global scope :). For example, there is no need to include form and form-item. You could also remove the words after color-, \u2026 there are a lot of possibilities.. What about using dayjs.millisecond instead then?. Ho, you're right. Meh, I guess we can live with a minor chance of false-positive I guess :). Nope, all good :). This is also false-positive-prone :/. Please use \"x-powered-by\": \"^Rocket=https://rocketcms.io/\" instead :). This is wrong, html detection has to start with a <.. Apparently https://us-3020.cdnit.ir/ is an Iranian blog about mushrooms? I don't understand.. The links you provided are showing that your CDN has several IP addresses. This isnt' demonstrating that it's a popular one.. What about something like \"server\": \"^big-?ip$\" instead?. What about \"Server\": \"^VTEX IO$\", instead?. This belongs in a script detection.. What about something like \"<link[^>]+href=[^\\\"]+clr-ui(?:\\\\.min)?\\\\.css\" instead?. Oups, you're right, href=[^\\\"] doesn't work, my bad.\nI do prefer the + operator to * for performances concerns.. ",

The first time I tried Wappalyzer, I got bitten by a regex with catastrophic backtracking, so my initial experience was that everything just hang when I tried to run things (working out which regex was the problem required some effort, too).\nWhile writing tests for each application would likely be impractical, it might be worth having a few different analysis samples to run against each app definition to provide a rudimentary detection for this problem.\n.

    "ChanandlerBong": "Since I'm completely new to this topic I'm not quite sure what driver you're referring to. I looked for a Wappalyzer driver but couldn't find any (only a .xpi-file in the firefox folder). In case you mean the version number, it's 3.0.13.\n. Ah, I see.\nTo explain in detail: I downloaded 2000 images from a server I had an account for (not my own server). The images were from several pages within one domain on that server, a gallery, so to speak. After I was done doing that, my account was suspended. When I asked for the reason, I got that it was suspended because of siteripping, because I was using some kind of download script or plugin and got over 17000 hit counts (that was the word he used. He meant images, thumbnails, pages etc).\nThe weird thing here is that I didn't use any kind of software for downloading all the images at once, so I'm trying to figure out if maybe one of my other plugins could be responsible for that. And since Wappalyzer is analyzing the websites's technologies, I thought maybe it could be running through the elements per page, creating a similar amount of hit counts as a used download plugin would.\nIf you have further questions, just ask ahead. In any event, thank you for your answers and time until now.\n. Okay, thanks very much for clearing that up for me. Much appreciated!\n. ",
    "toastal": "One easy win would be to add an EditorConfig file like many other projects do. I know one issue I ran into was that my text editor is configured to trim trailing whitespace and one single objects in the apps.jsondidn't trim and it was showing in my diff. Just setting the whitespace with a config file like this could clear up a lot. Granted it requires users to have the plugin installed in the myriad of supported editors, but at least it'll be documented on how the files should be formatted.\n. This should be good to go now.\n. Hmm.. If I recall correctly, the env match can't match any objects deeper than what's at the global scope for instance Rx.Observable. And I suppose there's no way to rule out the use of Closure compiler/Uglify w/ mangling/etc. What's done in these cases? Is the confidence set lower? Is it removed? I mean to get to 'Rx' you would have had to have set and not reused over 1100 global variables, no? Google Docs takes all env objects [A-Za-z0-9_$]{1,3}, correct? I think most utility libraries try to keep the name short ala $().\n. So the long and the short of it is that no environment variable check for a string of 1 to 3 length is safe because of Google Docs has reserved them all? Seems like that that should be in the contributing doc or Google Docs be immune to env checks as neither GMail nor Google's homepage nor Google+ reserve all variables... and I can't think of any other site that does this.\n. As a Rails guy, you've probably heard of Elixir and Chris McCord and Jos\u00e9 Valim's Phoenix framework at least. That framework is built on one of Erlang's most popular web frameworks, Cowboy, which is Heroku maintains its own fork of for its proxy. You can see Wappalyzer working correctly at PhoenixScreencasts. Unless you can distinguish the Heroku from the Erlang's (and have it working in the current Wappalyzer system), it's working as intended. It's in the same vein as most websites showing Apache or Nginx because that's the reverse proxy server. The headers show Cowboy, so it's Cowboy bygolly.\n. Same could be said for C and Nginx, et. al. The tricky one with this is that Cowboy IS one of the most popular Erlang/Elixir frameworks and I know people writing apps in those languages... it just happens that a disproportionate amount of the requests that hit that framework are from Heroku's proxy fork because of it's SaaS prevalence. Is there a way to add up headers to get a better idea--like no Vegur (I think)?\n. curl -I https://atom.io/\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nServer: Cowboy\n...\nX-Rack-Cache: miss\n'Cowboy' is an Erlang server. 'X-Rack-Cache' implies Ruby. Now... I'm not really sure Rails gets in there.\n. @naviabbot \ncurl -I https://getrallypoint.com/\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nServer: Cowboy\nConnection: keep-alive\nCache-Control: no-cache\nDate: Wed, 13 May 2015 22:12:26 GMT\nVia: 1.1 vegur\nHeroku has it's own fork of Ninenine's Cowboy @ https://github.com/heroku/cowboy (which is still Erlang). Ninenine's Cowboy is also used for many Elixir applications like it's most popular framework, Phoenix. My guess is that most apps served on Heroku are likely proxied through Heroku's Cowboy -- which would also explain the 'vegur' -- and are thusly shown in the header's server as seen by curl -I.\nIt's common practice to use a load-balancing proxy server -- which is why you'll see nginx for web applications written in almost every language.\n. It doesn't appear that there's a header or something in the document head to actually make this possible.\n. I added support for OpenResty months ago. You can even see statistics @ https://wappalyzer.com/applications/openresty. Some results may be off though however if the Server header isn't saying openresty. A version I compiled recently just said nginx, but that's not a bug in Wappalyzer.\n. Hate to burst your bubble dude, but being on a version of Firefox almost 20 versions behind is a real security and web compatibility issue. I'd highly recommend moving to a vanilla version of Firefox over an outdated fork.\n. PaleMoon doesn't have an independent rendering engine--it uses Gecko just like Firefox. The only difference is that PaleMoon doesn't have a competent team of people keeping up with security or the latest web technologies. As more and more people start using ECMAScript2015 anything outdated simply won't work. If you're looking to test \"indie\" rendering engines, you should try testing sites with things more along the lines of Dillo and Netsurf--there you'll see a different engines on projects that are still relatively keeping up to date on security.\n. It's served on OpenResty... and the whole deal with OpenResty is allowing Lua scripting in the Nginx worker.\nbash\n\u03b2 ~ curl -I https://school.souche.com/mobile/article/f4MCEiCTR1f\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nServer: openresty\n...\n.

I think you might of accidentally click \"Comment and Close\".\n. http://jqueryui.com/button/ uses an <iframe> to display an example with the jquery-ui.js script, but the site itself does not load jquery-ui.js so this is not a bug.\n. An <iframe> is essentially a different webpage embedded onto another webpage, like looking through a window into someone else's house. You can't quite tell if they have Comcast by looking at the color of their walls.\nBut if you go to the webpage that the <iframe> is embedding http://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/button/default.html then you can see that Wappalyzer does detect it. This is like actually going inside the other house and checking out that they have Comcast, HD, and over 2000 channels including HBO.\n. I understand where you are coming from, but there are a more issues created trying to account for <iframe> than not accounting for them...\n1. What if there is an <iframe> nested within an <iframe> within an <iframe>?\n   - This could cause a massive hit to performance considering all of the regexs would need to run against many webpages.\n2. What if the <iframe> is an external webpage?\n   - Then we would have to deal with same-origin policy which is difficult to overcome (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy).\n3. Et cetra...\n. It is possible to do this and would be a great feature to have, but in my opinion though, it seems that it would be beyond the scope of this extension.\nIf you want to take the extra 5 seconds to see what is being used, then I recommend you use the  Chrome DevTools  to inspect the page for <iframe> and open them in a new tab. This way Wappalyzer will detect everything in the tab you opened properly, this is how I discovered that jQueryUI was using an <iframe>. Optionally you could use something like  Open Frame  Chrome Extension to open them without inspecting the page.\nAlso, thank you for being curious! I hope that I could help you understand a bit more :)\n.

Whatever is used on a site, so in essence, appears as part of it (interactive or not), but it came from CDN in a iframe - is not counted as \"used by the site\"? \n. Yes, iframe comes from different website altogether, and I understand you sort of counting not \"presentations\", but \"servers\" in this case. To me it feels like it is more of \"lets grab window from the other house, and install it on ours\" or \"lets project on the wall whatever is going on in the other house and call it \"window in our house\", and this is the reason why I think it should be counted towards the site I am currently seeing/visiting. Yes, it might get accounted towards 2 sites, but in case of iframe coming from CDN it might not get counted at all, and I am not sure which is worse. \n. Sorry, I did not realize that multi-level iframe will cause perf problems. Parsing past first level of iframes might be an overkill, but at least first level feels like a good idea (is it even possible from extension level?). Would it be possible as very minimum to parse first level of iframe, and/or add an option to \"drill deeper\", so when I see something interesting and curious what is that, I can get  a correct result?

Would it be possible (for some frameworks) to figure if they are used or not just by looking at file names that come from network?

Icons should be squares otherwise they will be converted to png incorrectly and displayed in the list too.\n \u2196 It's an icon from the bookmarklet\n. The same for the category Hosting Panels.. Why the issue is closed, but the code isn't fixed?. Sorry, I looked into another method.. Its's utm.plus bookmarklet doesn't loading scripts.\n@AliasIO What do you think about creating wappaluzer objects using jsonparse of scripts loaded using xhr instead of using script element?. > Creating wappalyzer objects using jsonparse of scripts loaded using xhr instead of using script element?\nI did not take into consideration the directive\nconnect-src *.facebook.com *.fbcdn.net *.facebook.net *.spotilocal.com:* *.akamaihd.net wss://*.facebook.com:* https://fb.scanandcleanlocal.com:* *.atlassolutions.com attachment.fbsbx.com ws://localhost:* blob: *.cdninstagram.com 'self' chrome-extension://boadgeojelhgndaghljhdicfkmllpafd chrome-extension://dliochdbjfkdbacpmhlcpmleaejidimm.. @AliasIO Please create variant of bookmarklet containing all required css and js files, without icons.

Why detection of fancybox was added?. fancybox should be removed?.

I guess its related with https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/issues/1426. Its not random icon, its icon of one of technologies with most significant category. Like in Chrome.\napps.json#L10189. Make the icon square. . You could just set the same width and height for the svg tag.. Thats what your did:\n<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 160 265\" enable-background=\"new 0 0 160 265\"><g>\n=>\n<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 265 265\" enable-background=\"new 0 0 265 265\" preserveAspectRatio=\"xMidYMid meet\"><g transform=\"translate(52.5)\">. I mean\n<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 160 265\" enable-background=\"new 0 0 160 265\">\n=>\n<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"265\" height=\"265\" viewBox=\"0 0 160 265\" enable-background=\"new 0 0 160 265\">\n\n\nThe main part of your solution is\n<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 265 265\"><g transform=\"translate(52.5)\">. I was wrong, the SVG icon does not have to be made square, just the viewBox attribute must be set. \nThe second commit can be removed.. Also Chart.js. Drupal already implies PHP.. @AliasIO Why bookmarklet code is not in repository?. Some not-square SVG icons don't scale properly because the viewBox attribute is not set. Also such icons are not correctly converted to png.\n\nActually, I thought that all SVG icons are incorrectly scaled.. Change icons probably because there are not many such icons.\n\n. > DaAwesomeP: Maybe it would be better to amend this stylesheet to only specify width: 16px; height: auto so that it scales: \nIn this case, all horizontal icons will be higher than they should, and all horizontal icons will be too high.\n\n. > DaAwesomeP: The SVGs display fine in Firefox are technically correct.\nOnly square icons without the viewBox attribute are displayed correctly (but not converted). Try this non-square.. @DaAwesomeP I tried and all horizontal icons have become located higher than they should. Why you don't try? In any case, CSS will not solve the problem with the conversion.. @DaAwesomeP Yes, vertical-align: middle; aligns to the vertical center.\n\nIn chrome, there is no problem with editing the extension pop-up in the developer tools.\n. @AliasIO SVG can be not square.. @AliasIO Icons without viewBox are incorrectly converted to PNG, which led to https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/issues/1622. . @AliasIO Why add 4-star technology to Github? And then create an issue with a proposal to remove unused technologies?. This is not a strange conflict, before adding the modifications, you need to update the data of the remote repository and reset the local repository data to match master branch of upstream repository.\ngit fetch upstream\ngit reset --hard upstream/master\nOr for noobies\ngit pull upstream master\nModifications are best done in a separate branch.. Did you test this?\n\"script\": \"^cdncloudcart$\",\nWhy did you delete it?\n\"script\": \"/cloudcart-(?:assets|storage)/\",. LOL. Its working, but cannot detect any technology. I think that extension should show this info.. Its because of bug that already fixed. https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/pull/1571#issuecomment-302903537 https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/commit/fbfa4dbbb67c5117d02da65f2d0c6570a0d9be1e. https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/issues/1432#issuecomment-292682691. This issue should be closed.. You should check this comment https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/issues/1432#issuecomment-292682691. You can rewrite the history of the branch for modification (git commit --amend & git push -f), rather than creating commits for change and, especially, creating new pull-requst.\nYou must change the name of this pull-request and commit name to the old https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/pull/1582 and close the old pull-request.. This is because now the name of the converted icon does not include the name of the original SVG extension.\n\nCould not load action icon 'images/icons/converted/%name%.svg.png'.\n\nAlso, the author does not test the extension for Chrome.\n. @hearvox No, it's the default icon.. @AliasIO Why not release the fix to the store?. @xstatic These bugs are successfully fixed.. It's fixed in the repository. . @xstatic \n\nthe Chrome extension is not updated\n\nThe last update was recently on 26 may.. Why not to set confidence percentage instead of deletion?. Bootstrap isn't detecting on this page. If one framework copied another its mean they are the same. A truly unique Foundation framework did not copy Bootstrap.. glyphiconis probably a reliable way, but this element is rarely used. What about adding .navbar-header or .navbar-nav?\n.

LOL, it's not my project.. @AliasIO Now i faced it, detection by class name did not work. Why does the extension not use CSS selectors?. Why did you delete \"env\": \"^ados(?:Results)?$\"?. You do not know how to load changes from upstream. Also for each pull request, it is recommended that you create a separate branch.. Proof?\n. @jvoisin Earlier you comply with the wishes from issues.. @AliasIO Finally it is fixed!. Sorry, confused with Angular Material.. @AliasIO Do you plan to fix the conversion of SVG icons to PNG?. @AliasIO open https://web.telegram.org in Chrome.\n. Image images\\icons\\converted\\AngularJS.png is completely transparent.. phantomjs opens pages in the sandbox. In any case, wappalyzer does not run javascript in the context of node.js. @chamnap zombie.js is a full browser and executes javascript.. @chamnap \n\nIt's because of timeout error.\n\nanswered here. @chamnap For your site the error is\n\nBootstrap's JavaScript requires jQuery\nbrowser.visit(\"http://www.greenlocusyoga.com/yoga-classes/online-schedule\", \nfunction (err, browser) {\n...   if (err) { console.log('Error:' + err.message); }\n...   else { console.log('Page loaded successfully'); }\n... });\nnull\nError:Bootstrap's JavaScript requires jQuery. @chamnap give a piece of code.. What OS?. Confirmed\n\n. The root is is that meta tags are not being checked. This is fixed on 20 may, but not included in the NPM package, which uses 4.1.0 release.\n\n. You should type npm install only.. Or you can just replace wappalyzer.js file with the new version.. Genius.. What have I told?\nYou should type npm install only.. 1. git clone https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer.git (get newest version)\n2. copy wappalyzer.js and apps.json to src/driver/npm\n3. cd src/drivers/npm\n4. npm install\n5. node index.js https://wappalyzer.com. Second way step by step\n1. replace wappalyzer.js with new wappalyzer.js (new version from git clone). No mistake. Check another URL. My Node.js version is v6.10.0..

It would be reasonable to apply this only to MacOS or add a setting.. @AliasIO What fixes: height of body or .container?. @tstricklin-atmosol It is SVG https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/icons/Shopify.svg. LOL, the changes that must be in one commit are in different requests for mergers..

This is necessary so that you do not have to reinstall the bookmarklet when upgrading.. What resources?. I don't know what is inspector.js..

At least I see an icon.\n. > perhaps you just don't like google analytics ?\nI don't like it too. :smile: \nIMO Piwik - even if it's hosted on AWS - is still better than Google Analytics.\nBut besides this only the public website is tracked with Piwik. The app-internal tracking is done using an own technology as far as I see.\n. BTW he does not seem to dislike GA generally: https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/issues/994\n. > not sure what you mean by data being shared with AWS.\nYour server is hosted on AWS...\nhttps://geoip.flagfox.net/?ip=54.173.152.159&host=ad.wappalyzer.com\nhttps://whois.domaintools.com/wappalyzer.com\n... and so they of course receive the data and may analyse it.\n@preovaleo\nBut the solution is easy: Disable tracking in the settings and everything is fine. :smiley: \n. > With Fiber, DNS, Chrome, Gmail, Analytics and Search they can create a pretty complete picture of a person's online behaviour.\nHarrumph... https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/issues/994 :wink: \n\nUnfortunately this will always be the case unless you own the infrastructure, dedicated in-house servers aren't an option for me.\n\nYes, but there are many other (smaller) hosting providers than AWS, which would already address the problem the TS has. So that's no excuse. :wink: \n. CC: @getkirby\n. :cold_sweat:\n. Okay, there seems to be a difference.\nWith SPDY there is the \"fake\" header:\nX-Firefox-Spdy: x.y (a version number, mostly 3.1)\nWith HTTP/2 it is X-Firefox-Spdy: h2.\n. Indeed closed by https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/pull/1052.\n. Okay just found out that 40% sure really seems to be something serious and seems to be part of the detection.\nAt the first view it was just not clear what is meant by it.\n. Ah so that's the cause. :laughing: \nOkay, so I think I can close this issue. (unless you want to add a version \"verification\" their :smiley:)\n. Ah okay. So PDF documents (downloaded and viewed by PDF.js in FF) should not be detected.\nHowever in this case it should at least not display the technologies of the previous visited site. (see screenshot)\nSo the list there should be empty AFAIK.\n. I noticed this also happens when you display a single image.\nYou can reproduce it e.g. by right-clicking on a user avatar here and choosing \"Show image\". Wappalyzer is still showing the tools of the previous site.\n. Why do you close all that bugs? They are not fixed just because you close them...\nPlease reopen. AFAIK this issue is not fixed yet.\n. Mhh, okay still strange to see e.g. \"MediaWiki\" appearing as a used technology when viewing a PDF file.\n. Ah you use the wiki...\nYes like this.\nBut as the Contributing.md is quite popular and is even displayed by GitHub when someone wants to contribute I think at least adding a link there would be good. I've created a PR for this: https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/pull/997\n. > The wiki is also GitHub independent, it's just another repository that you can clone.\nYes.\nAnd you can also track the changes.\n. I cannot find Wappalyzer on http://arewee10syet.com/ anymore. So can anyone retest it?\nBTW: Please reopen this issue until it is confirmed that Wappalyzer is compatible with e10s.\n. Nice\n. BTW you can use ACP to get to know of e10s issues or submit such.\n.  @AliasIO You may also mark this add-on as compatible if possible.\n. I don't only mean the tool as such, but including the such a URL into the app.json: https://regex101.com/r/rO3eZ0/1 (I've just choose 1C-Bitrix as an example)\nSo e.g. this could be added like this\njson\n{\n    \"apps\": {\n        \"1C-Bitrix\": {\n            \"cats\": [\n                1\n            ],\n            \"headers\": {\n                \"Set-Cookie\": \"BITRIX_\",\n                \"X-Powered-CMS\": \"Bitrix Site Manager\"\n            },\n            \"html\": \"(?:<link[^>]+components/bitrix|(?:src|href)=\\\"/bitrix/(?:js|templates))\",\n            \"html_regex101\": \"https://regex101.com/r/rO3eZ0/1\",\n            \"implies\": \"PHP\",\n            \"script\": \"1c-bitrix\",\n            \"website\": \"www.1c-bitrix.ru\"\n        },\nThis way later uses could simply check what this regexp is matching.\n. > I'd be more in favour of including sample values that must pass validation. \nYes, that's good too. Maybe a better way than putting these samples somewhere else.\n. > In the worst case scenario it will double the size of apps.json, adding 150KB. We could also strip out the tests in the build script.\nIf you care about the filesize of the app.json we could just use a new .json file for this (e.g. test.json). Obviously test.json does not have to be included in the add-on, but just be used for CI tests.\n. > Then at build the tests in it could be removed after they are run.\nYeah, that's also possible.\n. Yes maybe a separate file tests.json or validation.json is a nice idea.\n. Why did you close it?\n. (the reference to #1002 is wrong, this issue is not fixed)\n. Okay, fixed. :smile:\n. Okay the first part of my second question has been answered:\nMissing file: src/icons/HTTP/2.png\nPossibly I could create a directory called HTTP and add a file 2.png there, but that's not really a nice solution...\n. So currently I can't really encode the slash or do something else?\nThe issue is just that HTTP/2 is the official name and I don't really like to use another name. So for now I'm using the \"folder workaround\". Possibly a fix of this could be implemented later. (https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/issues/1004)\n. > I'm also not sure about including HTTP/2 as it's a protocol, whereas SPDY arguably is more of a feature.\nWhat? HTTP/2 is just the successor of SPDY. Strictly said no SPDY or HTTP/2 are features, but protocols - both.\nIf you want bto name a feature they could both called \"*Faster network transport technology\" or something similar stupid.\nSo open this PR again and let's come back to the file name issue: What do you suggest? Naming it \"HTTP2\"?\n. Also want to add that the OS, the programming language aren't features too. So \"it's no feature\" is no argument at all.\n. So can this be merged?\n. This Penguin.png is always appearing as an uncommitted change no matter whether I discard them.\nThis defectively prevents me from rebasing right now...\n. Thanks for your instructions.\nI tried to follow them and until step 11 everythig went well...\nThere git told me:\nUsing index info to reconstruct a base tree...\nA       src/icons/penguin.png\nFalling back to patching base and 3-way merge...\nerror: refusing to lose untracked file at 'src/icons/penguin.png'\nCONFLICT (modify/delete): src/icons/penguin.png deleted in f122b13a993a499b52b9d84990c12da6775dca68 and modified in Add HTTP/2 and distinguish it from SPDY. Version Add HTTP/2 and distinguish it from SPDY of src/icons/penguin.png left in tree.\nFailed to merge in the changes.\nI now just created a new PR...\n. As #1012 was merged I'll close this.\n. Actually you can add a separate filename. I mean that's the purpose of https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/pull/1012.\nSVG support is not covered by this issue. You may create a new one to track this.\n. Is this fixed?\nIf so I recommend to (automatically) let issues close when a PR is merged. This makes it easier to see where it was fixed.\n. https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/pull/1051\n. Interesting idea. :+1: \n. @berezuev I think it's not about a legal issue or a \"how to do that\" question, but rather that including a submodule is easy and especially you can update it easily.\n. > (i.e. a branch named wappalyzer).\nThis would be quite misleading. A better name for the branch would be webappsdetect-json or something similar. At least wappalyze-data or wappalyze-json...\nBut I'd still prefer a separate repo. Otherwise contributing to the apps.json would get complicated (as you cannot contribute to the master branch).\n. > Well, in my past experience with submodules, they reference a commit. So, unless there is a way to reference the most up to date part of a branch, then this may not be very effective.\nThat's what they do. With easy updating I just meant you can use a single command (git submodule update) to update it AFAIK.\n. As it seems this idea is not implemented. So you refuse this idea, @AliasIO? Could you please explain why?\nIt is quite impolite to close issues without any explanation.\n. @ioli Please do not hijack issues. Open a new issue as you did.\nAs it seems you already do it by yourself: https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/pull/1051\n\n\nI fixed this for AliasIO/Wappalyzer.\n\nOkay, so I'm closing this issue as it's fixed in the upstream repo here. In case others have this issue they can also \"solve\" it with a brute way by just deleting the fork and all files of their fork (also delete the fork on GitHub) and reforking this repo. Of course you should not have any open PRs or you have to recreate them.\nThis is how I finally did this.\n. You do not need to add your image encoded in the comments, but you also need to add your service to the JSON file.\nHave a look at https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/wiki/Contributing#adding-a-new-application for more information.\n. So when will a new Wappalyzer version be released? I'd like to use this feature...\n. BTW Have you actually released a version of Wappalyzer with this fix?\n. Nice, I see it is working. I only see a generic icon for it, but well... it looks good anyway.\n.  If you'll see it then you can close it.. ",

Merge?. @AliasIO Merge if it looks good?. @EvanGoss Vagrant is an open-source software product for building and maintaining portable virtual development environments. But it needs a backing vm engine. So for using Vagrant VirtualBox (or one of the other non-free providers) have to be installed. Vagrant, by itself, can't do anything.\nHence mentioning that VirtualBox might be needed as well is redundant and not accurate. Someone might choose to run Vagrant with another provider such as VMWare or Parallels.. @EvanGoss Okay, so I'm not exactly a virtualization expert, but here's what I know of the technologies.\nVMWare, Parallels and VirtualBox are all virtualization providers that let you, well, virtualize OSs on top of whatever you're running. Vagrant is sort of the manager for these. Vagrant provides one single API for working with any of these Virtualization providers so you can think of learning about and working with just Vagrant (which has powerful API and configurations) and not any individual provider. But since Vagrant is just an abstraction on top of these, you still need one of these providers on your machine.\nDocker, AFAIK, is an entirely different way to virtualize stuff and has a more layered-container model. This is totally separate from the world of Vagrant, VMWare, VirtualBox and Parallels although it tries to achieve the same thing.\nSo you can use Docker and Vagrant independently. If you've been using Docker and you get an error, that's an error related to Docker and nothing to do with Vagrant. \nYour first message said that when you ran Vagrant, you got a certain error. What did you get when you ran Docker?\nCan you try the whole thing with only docker and let me know what happens? I'll try the build myself at some point and see if any instructions are missing or miscommunicated.\n. @EvanGoss Turns out you can also configure Docker to be a virtualization engine for Vagrant.\nHave you installed Docker?. @AliasIO For me, when I tried this, it was a different error. Vagrant could detect my docker fine, but:\n``\n==> default: Docker host is required. One will be created if necessary...\n    default: Vagrant will now create or start a local VM to act as the Docker\n    default: host. You'll see the output of thevagrant upfor this VM below.\n    default:\n    default: Box 'hashicorp/boot2docker' could not be found. Attempting to find and install...\n    default: Box Provider: virtualbox\n    default: Box Version: >= 0\nThe box 'hashicorp/boot2docker' could not be found or\ncould not be accessed in the remote catalog.

The expanded\nURL and error message are shown below:\nURL: [\"https://atlas.hashicorp.com/hashicorp/boot2docker\"]\nError:\n```\nAny ideas what's going on here?\nI looked at the boot2docker image and it seems legit. But I can't even access it by a simple vagrant box add hashicorp/boot2docker.. @grmpyninja Hey, could you build this locally and see if you get the tests to pass? No point going forward till the tests pass. The JSON seems to be invalid.. @coachmaxz No rules to match this?. @KrishMunot Agreed it doesn't work on facebook domains, but is that happening due to a timeout or some other issue?. @KrishMunot Cool, so it's not a timeout issues. It's a failed detection issue.. @synnz Why not make a PR?. Very different results for me:\n\nYou should try with all your extensions disabled, @kasu64 . @jvoisin Could you provide examples of where these rules hold?. Awesome. Looks good to me.. @jvoisin Examples of which sites these rules apply on?. @jvoisin Some examples of where we can see these rules in play?. @wingsuitist Hi. Could you please check why the test is failing and fix the PR? Thanks :). I'll need a bit more insight into your code before I can tell you exactly what's wrong, but I've deployed Wappalyzer to Lambda before (though without the cljs-lambda wrapper) and it's been painless. I just make sure to have everything in the proper locations. I didn't change the path the wappalyzer file expects the driver to be at so both of them are in the same folder.\nI've used the following folder structure:\nsrc\n|-- wappalyzer.js\n|-- driver.js\n|-- apps.json\n|-- index.js\nAll my calling code resides in index.js. @james075 Are all three files (test.js, wappalyzer.js and driver.js) in the same folder?. @james075 This is Elbert's npm entry, by the way: npm install @wappalyzer/wappalyzer. @james075 Have you tried using the package I linked you to instead of the other one? I've tried that package with the sample code provided and it seems to work fine.. @prees1 I'm not absolutely sure (will need @AliasIO to step in), but I think the other one is an older package. Anyway, if this issue is solved, you can close it.. @patrocle Hi! Could you provide examples of websites where this can be tested?. @patrocle Could you provide examples of websites where this can be tested?. @boossy Hi. Could you check why the tests are failing and make corrections?. @digitalica Why should the w be upper-cased?

Pull request is now ready for merge. Current build is failing because yepnope.js is missing an icon.\n. Hey @AliasIO, could you trigger a rebuild. I'm curious if it will pass this time since the last time it failed it was because of the yepnope issue you merged today. Thanks \ud83d\udc4d \n. @AliasIO when do releases for chrome happen? So I'll know when this detection is available. Thanks for merging!\n. Nevermind, already noticed it's been released \ud83d\udc4d \n. Happy to help :)\n. Hi, not sure why this happens, but I think you mean that the wordpress.svg icon is not shown when it's the default icon you see in the chrome title bar.\nCan you verify that this is the issue?\n\n. Think it might have something to do with the icon being a svg.\n@AliasIO might have some insights into this.\n. Hmm that is weird indeed, might use this package to convert: https://github.com/domenic/svg2png\n. Agreed. I removed it to fix the failing build. Yepnope was actually removed a bit earlier this year. So I assumed it had been discussed before.\nSee #1164 for a reference to which commit.\n. You have opened 4 pull requests with the same commit. Could you please close 3? That way @AliasIO doesn't have to go through all of them \ud83d\udc4d \n. Yeah if you look at the stats sites like linkedin reddit etc get mentioned. But they don't actually use it.\n. @AliasIO I was thinking of this last week \ud83d\udc4d Thank you \ud83d\ude04 . @fabe thanks for implementing this \u2764\ufe0f . Ah \ud83d\ude04 . ",

    "stefanos82": "@AliasIO I have the same behavior and not only that, at some cases it does not show any icon at all unless I press at the wappalyzer area.\n\n. @AliasIO: Also I wanted to ask, why do I see a different extension image for Express.js under Firefox and a different under Chrome?\nOn Chrome I see the black 'e' logo, but on Firefox I see a nearly transparent 'ex' extension.\nDo we know whether Express.js decided to drop the black 'e' logo in place of the new one they use on their website?. Weird...I still get the old logo for some reason. \nBy the way, on Firefox my version is 3.2.8 and on Chromium is 2.47.\nDoes this help a bit?. Interesting. After I posted my last message I decided to check something. I deleted the installed extension and reinstalled it; now I have 2.50 for Chromium.\nHow come it didn't update on Chromium? I use both browsers on a daily basis for web programming and could see it auto-upgraded a couple of days ago on Firefox.. @AliasIO I have already reported this a long time ago; \nit's bug #1219, can we do something about it?\nAlso, another problem comes with Angular2. As soon as wappalyzer runs for identification, I can see which tools or services have been recognized but for default icon on wappalyzer toolbar I get a gray icon, nothing else.\nCan we do something about it?\nCheers.. Please re-open this issue as it has not being resolved.\nBrowser: Google Chromium\nVersion: 57.0.2987.98\nBrowser: Mozilla Firefox ESR\nVersion: 45.8.0\nWappalyzer: 2.52\nOS: GNU / Linux Debian 9.0 (testing), 64-bit\nThe issue with Chromium is the same as @henrooster has pointed at as in the first comment, whereas in Firefox I get an empty extension icon which I have to click on that area to see what kind of apps have been detected.. @gadcam first of all, allow me to apologize for not providing the Firefox wappalyzer version; I thought I did.\nMy version is the one you have just mentioned.\nDoes this help in any way?\nIf there's anything else you would like me to double-check, please let me know.\nCheers.. I'm closing this issue because it has nothing to do with wappalyzer itself; it's an issue with Chromium and Debian testing.\nFor those who are facing a similar issue, just add --enable-remote-extensions in front of your chromium executable and your extensions will start working again.\n@AliasIO: Apologies for the false alarm.. I meant none of icon links really works when you click on it to find out more information about it.\nI didn't mean wappalyzer is complete unusable, that sounded wrong indeed; my apologies.\nSometimes when I don't know how to write it in English, I do the naive mistake to translate from my language in English and changes the whole meaning completely lol.. As you can see above, I have clarified my position. It's not something I did on purpose, but rather from sheer naivety.. \u043f\u043e\u0436\u0430\u043b\u0443\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0430. Firebug got merged with Firefox's web developer tools. Beside this, what @gadcam has said it's true; what you are asking for is out of extension's scope.\nAlso, since I'm an experienced WP user myself, allow me to give you a small hint: you can customize how your wp-content is named; some websites rename it to something else and point to that newly named directory from inside wp-config.php.\nTo name a few heavily customized WordPress websites, I list only 2-3:\n- how to geek\n- Hongkiat\n- Make tech easier\nFeel free to check their HTML code and see how they are doing things. There's no way it worths the effort to go so deep to reveal their back-end infrastructure since it's not that obvious.\nIn other words, it does not worth @AliasIO's time nor team's effort to add a feature that is strictly tailored on WordPress's needs.\nIf you do want to find what kind of plugin and or theme a website is using, I would suggest to use Chrome that contains extra information about a website via its own web developer tools that makes things clearer for you, as of which plugin(s) or theme is used.\nBy the way, it was an excellent question; kudos for asking it.\nMy $0.02 :+1: .

I'll compare with React which can be detected by\n\nscript pattern: As Preact is so small it's very likely it's bundled when used.

So React should not show up on an app that uses preact/preact-compat.. @AliasIO Do you think this would be too heavy to run if a lot of entries would do this or is it technically not feasible for another reason?. According to the specification not. I think we should look for a way to scan JS and source files, especially with the popularity of bundlers. The extensions would definitely need to use a web worker then as requested in #362.. I think this issue can be closed then as there is no alternative way to detect Preact.

For future reference, is it best to open a seperate pull request for each lib I want to add?. Yes, I used Docker for Mac.

I ran wappalyzer build to make sure it everything was good before commiting and it automatically alphabetized/orderers some elements and added some escapes - I was under the impression this was meant to happen - I can separate them later today if you want ( otherwise I'll just keep that in mind for future pulls). I looked into this. Looks like jsonlint is being used in the wappalyzer validate script. So I think all these artifacts are just left over from additions to apps.json that weren't validated with the script.. So if this display is no longer an option wouldn't it be nice to have it display a set Wappalyzer icon instead of a arbitrary icon from the list of detected technology? I could try to this if that's something that would be wanted.. Not too fond of this, but I guess it's not an issue. Not sure the priorities match up with mine.. I'll just tweak my own build.

So unless there is something very wrong with my firefox on 3 computers and 2 different operating systems, it is not a bug, but intended behavior.\nThe is problematic for 3 major reasons:\n\nIt is annoying, not only this is the only extension that has the need to inform me every time it updates, but the updates are frequent, sometimes multiple times in a week. To make matter worse, this update notification is always opened on every firefox installation I am using. Very reason I opened the issue.\nThe website that is being opened uses cookies and tracks the users.\nThere is no way to opt-out of this behavior and there is no disclosure how you handle the collected data. I am not talking about the intended collection of data - detecting website technologies user visits. I am talking about how wappalyzer webpage tracks visitors.\nThe whole process looks like you are purposefully collecting data on your users without disclosing it.\nOn the top of that, all of this is illegal in Europe.\n\nYou can fix this issue multiple ways, but obviously I am implying you should just stop opening that dreaded webpage on every update.. No such an option in firefox, or?\n\n. It is pretty obvious I was using the tracking argument to stop the bullshit notifications popups but since you are not getting it (or don't want to), I might as well exercise my rights and warn authorities about this deliberate act of deception, I mean at least I will get a second unbiased opinion on this right? I was always curious how seriously will EU intervene if someone was clearly breaking their somehow questionable rules and this seems like a good opportunity to do just that. Fun weekend project plus they are obliged to take it seriously. Europeans pay top dollar to have these kind of people, you know.\nOr you know you can still remove that garbage popup, or if you really just want to be more passively aggressive then me just add a cookie notice to your webpage, disclosing how you use cookies.

Cool :) Looking forward to seeing how many sites run it!. I would say that marketing automation is something that runs marketing campaigns autonomously based on user behaviour such as tools like infusionsoft, pardot, mautic.\nSearch engine optimization is a broader field so could include a lot more things.\nYoast basically adds meta tags and some schema markup to WordPress sites to improve search engine rankings, but I would probably argue that it doesn't fall under an automation category.\n. The script comes from the core and is built on demand. It's not a static asset that someone would minify and then rename.\nIt gets added to websites like a Google analytics snippet which then loads the script from the Mautic instance.\nThe full tracking script contains the name of the domain where you installed it like this:\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    (function(w,d,t,u,n,a,m){w['MauticTrackingObject']=n;\n        w[n]=w[n]||function(){(w[n].q=w[n].q||[]).push(arguments)},a=d.createElement(t),\n        m=d.getElementsByTagName(t)[0];a.async=1;a.src=u;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)\n    })(window,document,'script','https://mauticdomain.com/mtc.js','mt');\n\n    mt('send', 'pageview');\n</script>\n\nMaybe the MauticTrackingObject would be better to catch so there's less of a chance of false positives with sites that have a script with the same name for another reason?\nI'm not sure how that would need to be added though.. I can access the object with window.MauticTrackingObject so I'm assuming that this will work?\n\"env\": \"^MauticTrackingObject$\",\n\nAnd that the script could stay as well?. ",

    "jrjenk": "@jvoisin , are you sure?\nI was pretty sure I saw something in 'src/drivers/webextension/js/driver.js' in 'wappalyzer.driver.getRobotsTxt' which was using the fetch method to grab the robots.txt file which is why I opened the issue here. \n```\n/*\n * Fetch and cache robots.txt for host\n /\nwappalyzer.driver.getRobotsTxt = (host, secure = false) => {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    getOption('robotsTxtCache')\n      .then(robotsTxtCache => {\n        robotsTxtCache = robotsTxtCache || {};\n    if ( host in robotsTxtCache ) {\n      resolve(robotsTxtCache[host]);\n    } else {\n      var url = 'http' + ( secure ? 's' : '' ) + '://' + host + '/robots.txt';\n\n      fetch('http' + ( secure ? 's' : '' ) + '://' + host + '/robots.txt')\n        .then(response => {\n          if ( !response.ok ) {\n            if ( response.status === 404 ) {\n              return '';\n            } else {\n              throw 'GET ' + response.url + ' was not ok';\n            }\n          }\n\n          return response.text();\n        })\n        .then(robotsTxt => {\n          robotsTxtCache[host] = wappalyzer.parseRobotsTxt(robotsTxt);\n\n          setOption('robotsTxtCache', robotsTxtCache);\n\n          resolve(robotsTxtCache[host]);\n\n          var hostname = host.replace(/:[0-9]+$/, '')\n        })\n        .catch(reject);\n    }\n  });\n\n});\n};\n```\nIt looks to me like it is only caching if it receives response text, which is why I was suggesting it might be better to cache the 404 somehow.\n@AlexByte Thanks for commenting.\n. @jvoisin It's all good. I should have provided more detail on why I thought this might be the issue in the first place, I was just in too much of a hurry.. @AliasIO \nI missed that you were caching the empty string, I am afraid ES6 and Promises are things I am not overly proficient with so I completely overlooked that when skimming the code originally.\nNow that I see that the caching is there I am thinking this might be something unrelated to the extension itself, but that because the extension is making the request I am seeing it get caught by mod_evasive.  Since I wasn't expecting the extension to make a web request (I thought it just analyzed the page's DOM for patterns), I probably jumped the gun on opening an issue.\nHowever, just in case you are curious and want to know, the site that it has happened to me the most on is www3.ca.uky.edu.  You won't really see anything on that web address though as we just use it to host registration forms and there are not currently any open.  The main page really just returns a text string of the hostname. So I am not sure it is a great test right this moment.\nI can't get you server side logs or look at the server configuration until Monday, but if you let me know the approximate time and what IP address you connect from I can pull something if needed.  \nGiven the above insights, a couple of other things did occur to me:\n\nIt does seem to happen the most frequently when resuming Chrome and having multiple tabs open.  There is a chance I had multiple pages from that host open in more than one tab.  is it possible that the Browser Extension is invoked concurrently if multiple tabs are open?  Most pages on the site would have unique URLs, but the robots.txt file is a fixed entity so if extension events get fired for all tabs as soon as Chrome launches, that might explain it.\nThis one is more for me, but perhaps I should examine the mod_evasive configuration more closely.  There is always a chance the DOSSiteCount/DOSSiteInterval settings are lower than I thought. Since I am on the same network the round trip time is pretty quick, perhaps mod_evasive is actually triggering before the extension attempts to fetch robots.txt, and I what I am seeing is its first request and then any retries it might make since it received a 503 response when it was blocked, which wouldn't be cached.\n\nThanks for taking the time to look, I will update this on Monday just to let you know what I see.\n-jrj. So it turns out there is a form live at https://www3.ca.uky.edu/forestry/forest-management/new.php if you want to see one that is live. For that site Wappalzer is showing me 6 items in use, so from what you said it would try to grab robots.txt file (assuming it wasn't cached) 6 times?  If that is the case and it tried to process those requests in parallel then that might explain it. \nThe server is configured to block people if the exact same resource is requested 4 times within 1 second.\nWhen you said that the robots.txt file will be hit only when tracking is turned on, did you mean then 'Anonymously send reports on detected applications to wappalyzer.com for research' option?  I don't see any option specifically about \"tracking\" in the options of the extension:\n\nAdditionally, if I click on \"Inspect Views\" in Chrome and look at the contents of 'Local Storage' I don't see any entry for 'robotsTxtCache' and changing the options on the options above don't seem to change any of the stored values in the Local Storage Cache.  But this could be completely normal since I know that chrome tries to separate the page's local storage from content scripts local storage and I am not sure how to view the data used by the content scripts, I just wanted to provide some additional details.\n\n.

It's weird, I run it twice in a row and sometimes It doesn't hang, but prints only 5 technologies, and sometimes it does hang but prints 7 technologies.\n@AlexByte Did you mean that the \"hanging\" was because of a timeout error? Or were you referring to not getting all of the technologies back? \nAgain, works consistently when I use docker. I took a look at the docker file and it seems like phantomjs is included there.

Although I'm not sure if it influences anything or if it's being overridden by wait param.. No, it's okay, I was just thinking maybe it needed more time on slow websites.\nI'm not very good with javascript/nodejs,\nwe are calling visit() and then wait() inside it, right? and visit accepts options - we pass only callback and url so options are {} https://github.com/assaf/zombie/blob/master/src/index.js#L538 and then it calls wait internally with these options and since they are {}, it uses waitDuration as wait param for this internal call. and maxWait is only used for our external call.

Hi @OzorNox \nI agree with @jvoisin , i don't think that there is enough instance of this technologie used in the world to add it in Wappalyzer. \nLike says in the documentation : \n\nWhen creating a pull request, please include ten or more links to websites that use the application, a GitHub page with at least 1,000 stars or anything that will help establish the size of the user base.\nWappalyzer uses regular expressions to fingerprint web applications.\n\nSince Wappalyzer use regular expression, adding technologies that are not considerably use in the world will slower Wappalyzer for something that will almost never be detected :/.

When it will happen again, I try to extract more debug information. What do you need exactly? Or what can us help? (Maybe memory profile? idk). Hm, that's true.

Lots and lots of teams and companies are happily using CSS-in-JS in production, including Khan Academy, PayPal, Reddit, Coinbase, Bloomberg, Atlassian, and many more.. @jvoisin I sympathize, but that has nothing to do with styled-components, that inherently happens when you use a JavaScript framework and don't server-side render.

Disable, starts working. \ud83d\ude22 \nI tried comparing the requests to both /api (Which fails) and root request/ (Which works) using \"Copy as cURL\" in the Chrome Dev tools Network Tab. But the results are character for character identical. (And work as expected when run from the command line)\nEdit: For the sake of completeness, I switched Wappalyzer to \"Allow in Incognito Mode\" so it was the only extension running, and that results in the same 502 errors when browsing AWX in Incognito mode.. TLDR: Wappalyzer hits /robots.txt and AWX throws a 502 for that request. If the next request is made within ~5 second it fails. This 2nd request seems to reset the web server and a 3rd request is fine. A wait of > 5 seconds seems enough for the web server to respond to the next request successfully.\nIt was bugging me why this would be an issue, so I was digging a little deeper into the  Wappalyzer options and noticed \"Anonymously send reports on detected applications to wappalyzer.com for research\"\nTurns out, if I leave Wappalyzer enabled, but turn off that option everything with AWX works, but if I switch it on, the 502 errors come back.\nFollowing with Wireshark, that is when it hits robots.txt as described above (Which doesn't appear in the Google Dev Tools Network Tab that I can see) and hitting that URL does return a 502 error normally.\nAfter a few iterations I can reproduce the issue by using curl on the command line to hit both URLs in rapid succession using: curl 'http://awx.local/robots.txt' -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate' -H 'Accept-Language: en,en-GB;q=0.9' -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_13_2) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/63.0.3239.132 Safari/537.36' -H 'Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*' -H 'Referer: http://awx.local/' -H 'Cookie: sessionExpired=false; lastPath=%2Fhome; userLoggedIn=false; current_user=%7B%7D' -H 'X-CookiesOK: I explicitly accept all cookies' -H 'Connection: keep-alive' --compressed; curl 'http://awx.local/api/' -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate' -H 'Accept-Language: en,en-GB;q=0.9' -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_13_2) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/63.0.3239.132 Safari/537.36' -H 'Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*' -H 'Referer: http://awx.local/' -H 'Cookie: sessionExpired=false; lastPath=%2Fhome; userLoggedIn=false; current_user=%7B%7D' -H 'X-CookiesOK: I explicitly accept all cookies' -H 'Connection: keep-alive' --compressed\nIf I throw a sleep 4; in the middle, the second request still fails.\nIf I throw a sleep 5; in the middle, that seems long enough to clear it and the second request succeeds.\nIf I don't sleep at all, and add another request to /api that 3rd request successes consistently.\nSo, while Wappalyzer is triggering the error, it's not necessarily at fault or in a position to fix it. .

    "sir-dunxalot": "I am also seeing an inconsistency between the Chrome extension and npm package when passing scripts to wappalyzer's analyze() method. Specifically:\nUsing, 5.5.1 in a local app, I grab script from a page:\n```js\nimport Wappalyzer from 'wappalyzer';\nconst href = 'https://www.nba.com/cavaliers/'; // The page to scrape\n// Load href in Puppeteer (code omitted for simplicity)...\n// Grab scripts like the extension: https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/c9b0ab7aa2db7ca720014a5afb096334febebcb0/src/drivers/webextension/js/content.js#L17\nconst scripts = Array.prototype.slice.apply(document.scripts).filter(script => script.src).map(script => script.src).filter(script => script.indexOf('data:text/javascript;') !== 0);\nconst html = document.documentElement.innerHTML;\n// Back in node, pass the data from Puppeteer to wappalyzer...\nconst wappalyzer = new Wappalyzer(href);\nconst { applications } = await wappalyzer.analyze(href, {\n  html,\n  headers: response.headers(), // response is a Puppeteer response object\n  cookies: page.cookies(), //  page is a Puppeteer page object\n  scripts,\n});\n```\nUsing https://www.nba.com/cavaliers/ as an example, I have confirmed that scripts contains a URL matching the DoubleClick for Publishers script. Scripts looks something like this:\njs\n[\n  'https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion_async.js',\n  'https://www.googletagservices.com/tag/js/gpt.js', // Should match https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/apps.json#L2629\n  'https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id=GTM-P8VS57',\n  etc...\n]\nHowever, applications does not contain DoubleClick for Publishers.\nSo, excluding any incompatibility using headers and cookies from Puppeteer may be introducing, scripts seems to be failing to correctly match strings (or do so before applications is returned).\nOther applications missing from the npm analysis of https://www.nba.com/cavaliers/ application are:\n\nGoogle Analytics\nParse.ly\nSiteCatalyst\nHandlebars\nAkamai\nGoogle Tag Manager\nFont Awesome\nGoogle Font API\nEnsighten\nModernizr\njQuery\njQuery UI\n\nThese are all detected by the Chrome extension.\nApplications successfully detected by the npm package are:\n\nBootstrap\nDrupal\nNginx\nPHP. @AliasIO Any tips for a workaround to the inconsistencies noted here?. I have developed a workaround that avoids using zombie to crawl the page and, instead, uses page data scraped from Puppeteer:\n\n```js\nimport Wappalyzer from 'wappalyzer';\nconst href = 'https://www.nba.com/cavaliers/'; // The page to scrape\n// Load href in Puppeteer (code omitted for simplicity)...\n// Grab scripts like the extension: https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/c9b0ab7aa2db7ca720014a5afb096334febebcb0/src/drivers/webextension/js/content.js#L17\nconst scripts = Array.prototype.slice.apply(document.scripts).filter(script => script.src).map(script => script.src).filter(script => script.indexOf('data:text/javascript;') !== 0);\nconst html = document.documentElement.innerHTML;\n// Back in node, pass the data from Puppeteer to wappalyzer...\nconst cookies = await page.cookies(); // page is a Puppeteer page object\nconst wappalyzerDriver = new Wappalyzer(href, {\n  userAgent: 'Whatever UA you want to use',\n});\nconst headers = response.headers(); // response is a Puppeteer response object\n/ Replicate https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/drivers/npm/driver.js#L31 /\nfor (let header in headers) {\n  headers[header] = [headers[header]];\n}\n/ To avoid crawling the site again, which Wappalyzer does with Zombie,\nwe don't use Wappalyzer's default usage instructions. Instead, we work\ndirectly with the Wappalyzer driver's wappalyzer object to anlayze\npre-crawled page content. In some cases, we have to prep the page data\nusing the Wappalyzer driver's helper methods (e.g. getJs()) /\nconst { wappalyzer } = wappalyzerDriver;\nawait wappalyzer.analyze(href, {\n  html,\n  headers,\n  cookies,\n  js: wappalyzerDriver.getJs({ // If you don't have access to window, omit js option\n    window,\n   }),\n  scripts,\n});\nconst { apps } = wappalyzerDriver;\nreturn apps;\n```\nWith this setup, where Wappalyzer is not used for crawling and fetching, the following apps are detected and returned:\n\nBootstrap\nDoubleClick for Publishers\nDrupal\nFacebook\nFont Awesome\nGoogle AdSense\nGoogle Analytics\nGoogle Font API\nGoogle Plus\nGoogle Tag Manager\nHandlebars\nNginx\nPHP\n\nThat's more comprehensive than the list returned by the NPM driver:\n\nBootstrap\nDrupal\nNginx\nPHP\n\nPart of the problem for me was understanding the difference between the NPM driver and the Wappalyzer source.\nIn either case, the NPM driver was not returning a full list of technology detections vs the Chrome extension..

This seems to line up with my experience as well.\nThe tracking feature is a big problem to have enabled by default regardless, as it logs every URL visited by the user and sends them to a third party server. Regardless of what you claim to do with this information, collecting a user's entire browsing history is incredibly irresponsible and puts hundreds of thousands of users at risk in the event that your servers should be compromised. Claiming that this can be done \"anonymously\" is an outright lie due to the amount of PII that is often included in URLs and query parameters by some sites. Sometimes authentication information can even make it into URLs, even if it's generally considered bad practice to do so. While malice may not have been the intent, the default behavior of this extension is indistinguishable from spyware.\nEDIT:\nAs I was collecting additional information on the extent of this issue's impact, I noticed that the path, query parameter, and hash portions of the URL are each replaced with a simple checksum, using an especially weak algorithm that I believe traces back to this StackOverflow answer. For example, the /AliasIO/Wappalyzer/issues/2531 portion of the URL to this page becomes 3751105010. However, due to the weak nature of this algorithm, similar URLs can end up with similar hashes, so the hash for issue 2532 would be 3751105011, a difference of just one character.\nWhile this is better than no redaction at all, the protection provided is fairly weak, and domain names are still sent in their entirety. Given this, I would revise my assessment of this extension's anonymity claim from \"outright lie\" to \"questionable at best\". These reports are also sent from the user's IP address, like any HTTP request, meaning there's no guarantee the receiving server isn't logging that information. Simply having a log of every time someone visited a page on a domain with millisecond-resolution timestamps is quite enough of a privacy invasion on its own. Since the hashes are deterministic, it's also possible to identify repeat visits to the same page, and if you have a guess of what a page might have been, it's trivial to confirm if that guess is correct, at which point you've unmasked the complete URL. It's still impossible to rule out the possibility that a malicious attacker could compromise the server(s) collecting and/or storing this information, and the more data you have available the easier it becomes to identify patterns and begin to unmask users.\nFor anyone else viewing this issue that's curious, below is a partial copy of one of the requests this extension recently sent back to ad.wappalyzer.com, with a couple annotations in the form of comments:\nyaml\n[{\n    \"doc\": {\n        # 3296128994 -> /mail/u/1/\n        # 5397332035 -> #inbox\n        # The URL path tells you I'm signed into multiple Google accounts,\n        # and this isn't the primary (which would be /u/0/)\n        \"url\": \"https://mail.google.com/3296129025#5397332035\",\n        \"isHP\": false,\n        \"referrer\": null,\n        \"rand\": 6526444429917,\n        \"startTime\": 1544063421990,\n        \"finalPageUrl\": \"https://mail.google.com/3296128994#5397332035\"\n    },\n    \"event\": \"invalid-robotstxt\",\n    \"video_assets\": [],\n    \"assets\": [],\n    \"version\": \"3\",\n    \"mrev\": \"fe20291-c\",\n    \"msgNum\": 0,\n    \"timestamp\": 1544063422287,\n    \"pageVis\": \"visible\",\n    \"pageFoc\": false,\n    \"pageTags\": []\n}, {\n    \"doc\": {\n        # 4443977425 -> /web/index.html\n        # This is the frontend to a Plex server.

This issue is still not fixed in 5.5.7 -- it's gotten even worse. Options can no longer be disabled at all. I tried stepping through the code myself and noticed this:\n\nbrowser.storage.local.get(name) returns an object in the form {name: value} on success, or {} if the specified key does not exist. By simply testing for option[name], options with a value of false will fail that test, falling back to the default value. Since all options default to enabled, this means that options cannot be disabled by the user at all, despite appearing to be disabled in the options UI. You should be testing for option[name] !== undefined instead.. It would also make a lot of sense if options.js used the same logic for getOption as driver.js so that discrepancies like this don't continue happening in the future.. ",

Okay, with the following piece of code executed from Chrome's JS console I'm able to detect Vue.js presence and version.\nSadly, no luck with vue-router so far.\n```javascript\nvar all = document.querySelectorAll('*');\nfor (let i=0; i<all.length;i++) {\n    if (all[i].vue) {\n        let Vue = Object.getPrototypeOf(all[i].vue).constructor;\n    while (Vue.super) {\n        Vue = Vue.super;\n    }\n\n    if (Vue.version) {\n        console.log('Vue.js detected: ' + Vue.version);\n        break;\n    }\n}\n\n}\n```\n\n. I'm not familiar at all with Wappalyzer's code.\nIf someone here with more knowledge about the project could find a way to integrate this nicely, that would be fantastic.\nI don't trust myself and I'm sure I'll be breaking things if I were to do it.\nPaging @jvoisin and @AliasIO \n.

If it doesn't actually call the function, I think looking for go.GraphObject on the page would be another good way to identify GoJS, since you need to instantiate go.GraphObject.make in order to build a diagram. .

Thanks, just did a quick search on Github https://github.com/search?q=dayjs&type=Code. There are 14,496 code results that contains dayjs, and nearly all of them are using \"Day.js\". \nSo, seems it's ok to just use dayjs as a special key word. \ud83d\ude2c . All right, that make sense. Our component is published as each individual package, that our users could use any of above components in their project. There is actually no really important elements or must have element. \nSo, any advice here, or a better solution?\nCheers. Well, that won't be a problem, since there always will be a global window.dayjs.\nYou could open one of above website, and in development console, type dayjs, you'll get what you want, no matter their source is compressed or not.. OK, that might happened, but just randomly as you said. So I think it is ok to keep dayjs. And as a 2kb tiny javascript library, we can't and won't do much to the global variable, and this might be the only evidence to detect Day.js. . We only have dayjs().millisecond method, cause dayjs is only a factory function, instead of an instance object.\nInvoke window.dayjs function will return dayjs object which has millisecond API. I don't really understand. Anything I should do now?. Got you, thanks. ",
