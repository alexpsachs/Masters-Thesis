I don't get it.  Is this some kinda text formatting thing?\n. :heart:\n. I kinda want a registry where we can do stuff like\n/scripts list - get all the scripts from a remote registry\n/scripts enable meme-generator - enable the meme-generator script from the registry, persist to robot brain\n/scripts disable meme-generator - disable the meme-generator script from the registry, persist to robot brain\nClosing this for now.\n. Can you merge master in and reconcile the conflicts?\n. Is there any way to do this without adding behavior to the robot class itself?\n. Could you make the jira user/password combo something that you teach to hubot and he remembers?  Or is this more of a per project kinda thing?\n. Yeah, you don't want to publicly paste your password though.  Let's go with a specific user for now and fix it up later.\n. You added a ton of the default scripts from github/hubot, was that intentional?\n. I went ahead and merged this.  If you can open another PR with the comments removed, that'd be awesome.\n. Then we should probably have people signup for keys.  It's inevitable with anything API driven.\n. This is so unfriendly, man.\n. Is there any way to get a random comic?\n. :smoking:\n. It does, npm just won't follow redirects.\nI've release v2.0.4, enjoy.\n. Yup, I ran into that time and time again before we pushed hubot out as actual npm packages.  Heroku has an issue where a url is pulled down and essentially cached, without checking the version number of the package.json file in npm.  As a result new tarballs at the same path don't count as updates, even updated urls seemed to have the problem too.  \nMy only solution was to nuke the entire app and recreate it, which drove me insane.\n. What adapter are you using?  Hubot shouldn't respond to himself, ever.\n. Yeah, I'd take this up with the talker adapter owners.\n. :metal:\n. Sadly, your best bet is to contact the author of the script.

Just submit the bug fixes to master when you're ready.  It's easier for me. :)\n. Now, if only it'd snow in Tahoe.\n. Can you namespace the environmental variables to be something like HUBOT_ISSUE_LINK_GITHUB_REPO or something else?\n. Yeah, either way I guess.  I just like the idea of not have minor changes in other scripts breaking my stuff. :)\n. Amazing.\n. Can we alias factoid to be something we pull from the environment or default to factoid?  We have a \"remember\" script that does exactly what this script does, it'd be cool to have that extra bit of customization.\n. Yup, I think I understand what you did.  We should be cool to merge this.\nOn Fri, Apr 6, 2012 at 2:55 PM, Arthur Kalmenson\nreply@reply.github.com\nwrote:\n\n@atmos sorry, I don't think I understand what you're asking. Would you like\nthe factoid command trigger (i.e. ~) to be customizable? Or are you asking\nsomething else?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. :metal:\n. re-published, sorry about that.\n. @technicalpickles @tombell I'm gonna start focusing on some more interesting projects so I'll be less involved in hubot. I trust both your tastes and look forward to just writing scripts for a bit. I'm gonna stop following this repo but just mention me if you guys ever need me.\n. \n. :heart: for using environmental variables!\n. You shouldn't need to explicitly return.\n. You probably want robot.respond here.\n. Yeah, build the regex dynamically and interpolate the robot name.\n\nSomething like:\nregex = new RegExp(\"(thanks|cheers) #{robot.name}\", i)\nrobot.hear regex, (msg) ->\nIt's probably best done as two matchers then.\n. Can you use one of the existing deps to handle the dom parsing instead of jquery?\n. I ran into an issue yesterday where these iterations actually require a do and a callback variable.  Is that not the case here?\nhttps://github.com/github/hubot/commit/74e9b751a7cd9242679bdedf3d1b131f8d317d9e and https://github.com/github/hubot/commit/9212731fde84695302b88393f1afc4439d7335f4\n. That's why I asked.  The behavior was completely insane when I came across it.  If it's working for you then I'll just merge it.\n. Any reason you can't use the join event type for these notifications?\n. Should this have a question mark at the end?  Seems more like a command. :)\n. Sorry, they're enter and leave.\nhttps://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/src/robot.coffee#L63-72\n. Can we nuke this?\n. And this.\n. Do you really want something like this?\nrobot.respond /(chm|tdih)$/i, (msg) ->\n. Why was this removed?\n. Err, I'm blind. :)\n. @tombell can we make an API that doesn't require knowledge of the underlying adapter's presence?  @robot.send seems like it should just delegate to @robot.adapter.send, no?\n. :heart:\n.

I no longer work on Hubot, try not cc'ing me into issues anymore.\n. Seems like the web server refused your connection when the HTTP call was made. The animal.coffee script should be updated with better error checking.\n. Forget running the tests, they need to be updated to work with new Hubot v2.0 :)\n. Easiest way to test is test the script locally on your own Hubot, or using the shell adapter\n. You will need to clone your hubot from Heroku, add the script, commit the changes and re-push to Heroku. Also locally testing with the shell adapter is just as easy.\n- Clone hubot repo\n- npm install the dependencies\n- Add your script to src/scripts\n- bin/hubot\nThen you'll have a REPL for testing commands.\n. No, only when we make a new release.\n. If you don't want to wait for actual releases, you can add the URL to a tarball which npm can use for the dependency. You can see https://github.com/tombell/pickles/blob/master/package.json for an example of how I use this for hubot-scripts.\n. Great job on the web site! I'm going to look at an alternative way to document the scripts commands and description, because people just put comments at the top of scripts irrespective of that it reads <x> - <y> as command and description of command.\n. It's probably best asking the person who wrote the airbrake script.\n. There isn't really any sort of 'official' way, except killing the process, whether it's local or on Heroku.\n. Ignore my original close, I thought this was the hubot repository. :)\n. One step closer to hubot replacing every developer in the world.\n. the RESQUE_WEB_URL should be like http://blah:port with no trailing slash.\n. You would have to make it manually follow redirects.\n. You have to manually commit the script into your hubot's src/scripts and wait for the next tagged release.\n. It will be in the next release of the package then.\n. If it's a xml2js issue there isn't much we can do about it.\n. Throw open an issue with the problems with tests/writing tests and I'll look into it ASAP.\n. This should become easier when I work on github/hubot#297, and it should flow down into hubot-scripts.\n. @technicalpickles could you remove me from being assigned to this issue please.\n. It is. https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts#installing\n. Feel free to open a pull request modifying the 100+ scripts :P\n. If I have some spare time, I'm going to clean up a lot of the header comments of scripts, there is a lot of garbage in some.\n. I'm hoping to simplify the help documentation at the top of scripts, some scripts contain a lot of useless information.\nSomething like the following is what I'm hoping for:\n``` coffeescript\n\nDescription:\n\n\nDependencies:\n* \"module\": \"version\"\n\nCommands:\nhubot do something - what does this robot.respond do\nlisten for something - what does this robot.hear do\n\nAuthor:\nOriginal author's name\n\n```\nIt's simple and if everyone keeps to the format that's better. Once every script is updated to be like this, scripts shouldn't be merged in until they to have this style of comment at the top.\n. I'm going to start work on this tonight.\n. I thought about leaving None so services like the hubot-scripts-catalog can easily parse it. When I've finished updating the rest, we can maybe work out what needs adding and what doesn't.\n. Me either, I was gonna remove them.\n. Maybe update hubot to read and parse the header comments and store the relevant pieces of info for help stuff.\n. Oof. Think that's me done for the night, you fancy finishing off the last few letters?\n. I'll work on 's' today.\n. I think we're done!\n. The commands are basically me not bothering to read a script and work out what everything does, I only added the commands for scripts that already had them documented.\n. ``` coffeescript\nDescription:\n\n\nDependencies:\n\"\": \"\"\n\nConfiguration:\nENV_VAR_1: \n\nTriggers:\n - \n\nNotes:\n\n\nRoutes:\n - \n\nAuthor:\n\n``\n. I'm going to give this another once through changingCommands:toTriggers:, then I'm going to merge into master. Anything people disagree with then can be opened in separate issues/pull requests.\n. Could you update the header documentation to match the new style (https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/pull/468#issuecomment-6245998) that we're introducing.\n. Maybe have aHUBOT_ENCODED_AUTHwhich when set will assume theAUTHis encoded already?\n. Without digging into the depths of hubot, there isn't an easy way to solve this. Hubot doesn't call callbacks forhearwith it's own messages.\n. Could you update to include the new full header documentation comments please?\n.hubot-scripts.jsonis used to load scripts from hubot-scripts. Scripts in/scriptswill be automatically loaded and you shouldn't copy scripts from hubot-scripts into that directory.\n. Could you paste the entire stack trace?\n. Edit your hubot-scripts dependency version in thepackage.jsonin your hubot repo to2.1.1. You'll have to find the author of the jenkins script.\n. I've not used node-inspector, I test my scripts using theshelladapter locally.\n. You should update this to use the hubot brain instead of the hard coded redis dependency.\n. Take a look at how https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/karma.coffee does it.\n. Make sure you document your script in the header comments like other scripts, and just open the pull request, any feedback will be discussed in the pull request.\n. Hubot already provides a built in HTTP server using Connect, should probably look into using that instead of using a 2nd copy of Connect.\n. Too much effort splitting it up! Do it live!\n. Status of this pull request?\n. Status on this pull request?\n. Status on this pull request?\n. Status on this pull request?\n. Looks like you forgot to remove the oldstartup.coffee`, if you could remove that I'll merge this.\n. Status on this pull request?\n. The storage wasn't designed to be edited outside of hubot.\n. Status on this pull request?\n. I'll merge, and people can yell if it breaks anything. :)\n. I merged everything going down, and decided to overwrite the script as that one had the extra functionality. If you submit yours with a different filename I'll merge yours in as well.\n. No problem.\n. The issue is that the 'stdout' and 'stderr' output is empty. I was testing this locally, and logged the body returned.\njack > bin/hubot -n j\nj> j eval rb puts 'hello world'\nj> {\"lang\":\"rb\",\"status\":0,\"stderr\":\"\",\"stdout\":\"\",\"syscalls\":0,\"time\":0.00653982162475586}\nIf you need more info or believe the script is broken you should ping the author and get some help.\n. If someone wants to submit a PR with a fix for this issue please do.\n. What version of node is in your \"engines\" part of package.json?\n. Seems like an issue with compiling StringPrep on Heroku.\n. This isn't a hubot-scripts dependency. One of the scripts in hubot-scripts requires the module, you could remove the script from yoru hubot-scripts.json\n. If the updates based on my comments are fixed, happy to merge.\n. Happy to merge this if the mocha spec is removed. It's not a dependency of the base hubot-scripts. If that gets removed, happy to merge.\n. If the outlined comments get fixed, this is ready to merge.\n. Repush to heroku, there is 2.4.0+ now https://npmjs.org/package/hubot-scripts\n. Also looking at that log you're using Using Node.js version: 0.6.20 and the latest hubot requires 0.8.x, you should probably update your hubot as well.\n. Does the script work?\n. What's this issue regarding?\n. :+1:\n. Can you check your logs to see if hubot actually connected to your redis instance? I just tested the script and it seems to work fine for me.\n. What does the output of <robotname> show storage show?\n. Disable all hubot-scripts except the redis-brain and factoid and see if it still runs.\n. I have no idea what could be up apart from misconfigured ENV VARS, I've tried on the terminal and IRC, and the script works fine. The IRC adapter hasn't been updated for the latest hubot adapter changes, but it should still 'work'.\n. Could you download the script and add console.log @cache https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/factoid.coffee#L29 at the top of the add function, then remove the script from hubot-scripts.json, and push that to heroku and then check the logs?\n. Okay, I think I've located the bug, and it's with the redis-brain.coffee script.\n. Could you save this updated redis-brain.coffee in ./scripts, and remove from your hubot-scripts.json\nhttps://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/redis-brain.coffee\nThen tell me if it works.\n. The IRC adapter needs updating based on changes made in the recent hubot\n. That change should fix it, if you could manually test the script by downloading it and dropping it into ./scripts and disable the hubot-scripts.json version.\n. Fixed.\n. You added the underscore dependency without adding it to the header. Please could you add that to the header (see other scripts to see how) and I can merge.\n. I'm not sure about merging this in yet as it's IRC specific, if it were made adapter-agnostic I'd be happy to merge it in.\n. A simple example is https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/github-commits.coffee\nCampfire doesn't have bold/underline stuff, so might be best leaving that out.\n. The gtalk adapter needs updating because the usersForFuzzyName is now on robot.brain not robot\n. Can you show us what you typed, and what you expected to happen.\n. That's what the script is suppose to do.\n. Yes, that is what the script is written to do.\n. The script needs updating, the function was moved into robot.brain.\n. Yes, feel free to submit a pull request to fix it.\n. I'm not sure about this. People would look at the help output and try running those commands, which won't work.\n. The userForXYZ functions need updating, they were moved to robot.brain.\n. The problem with deprecation messages is people never check the logs unless something is broken. So there will be a point where you would need to actually deprecate the method, which this you're just prolonging the removing of the method. It's easier to just see the error, update the script that is out of date.\n. I don't like semantic versioning for this type of project, with a lot of breaking changes you would like to release you have to either: a) what ages to release changes, or b) end up with version 14.0.0\n. I'd rather just not add 'deprecation' messages as they would be displayed to users not the developers of scripts, and users don't ever check logs unless something goes wrong. I would rather just say 'Until v3.0.0, shit may break without warning'.\n. The tests are a mess, you should just ignore them.\n. I would, but depends on the majority consensus.\n. Testing scripts is pretty much pointless I think, most people will have tested them while they were developing them with an actual hubot instance, and 90% wouldn't submit a broken script. I also don't feel like retrofitting tests for every script.\n. The tests in hubot are also a mess. I understand them and how they work, and I would also prefer to remove them as well.\nI personally won't be retrofitting tests to hubot-scripts for a number of reasons:\n1. There are over 200\n2. I can't be bothered signing up to service X, Y and Z to test the API\n3. I can't be bothered reading API docs for service X, Y and Z to find out what API end points and data I need to mock/stub\n4. There are over 200\nHonestly, I would prefer people stop contributing to hubot-scripts and release npm packages which use the new external-scripts.json and then people can test or not test however they like and manage issues for specific scripts.\nThe other issue I have with hubot-scripts as a repo and package is, when someone opens an issue with a script that uses a service I don't personally use, I'm not going to sign up to said service to debug and fix a script I most likely won't ever use.\nI think the route I would take is deprecate hubot-scripts as of hubot v3.0.0 and insist people start making external hubot npm packages. Making external scripts first class and hubot-scripts second class will relieve a lot of issues with maintaining hundreds of scripts in a single repo. Then having some sort of central web site listing all the available hubot scripts which can be installed externally.\n. Remove the script with a PR.\n. This follows the same concept that the other scripts and hubot itself. This is mainly because it's easier to just check if an env var is set than parse the env var into a boolean.\n. Feel free to submit a PR.\n. It'll be pushed, :soon:\n. Just npm publish, I tagged the repo.\n. :+1:\n. It's explained in https://github.com/github/hubot#external-scripts\n. Given the new script format I am working on, the 'documentation' of commands will be within the script making this idea of external documentation pointless.\n. Just a couple questions:\n1. Where are the documents coming from?\n2. If hubot is already in HipChat where would hubot receive them from\nThe better place to ask this is probably the hubot-hipchat adapter repository.\n. You're probably best asking on the hubot-hipchat adapter repo. If their API allows for files to be posted via it, then you should be able to do it.\n. What's the status on this, good to merge?\n. I modified hubot to allow adapters to pass more details along with the message, so if that isn't there it should be easy to add without breaking all the things.\n. I think the best way is attempt to identity you by campfire email else fallback to some manual identification. This means it won't be entirely tied to the campfire adapter.\n. Welcome to dates in JS :P, you can UTC it like moment(blah).utc().calendar().\n. Use .format() instead of .calendar()\n. :squirrel: \n. Is this the same as the khanify part of the existing memegenerator script?\n. Thought I'd check before I blindly merged :)\n. Releasing a new version isn't an 'issue'\n. I don't have push access to npm for hubot or hubot-scripts.\nIf you don't want to 'wait for a hubot-scripts' release, you're welcome to create an external script package. Details of this are in the hubot README, and is going to become the default for hubot 3.0 as we look to deprecate hubot-scripts.\n. There are too many to retrofit tests. This is why we suggest many people use the external script functionality of hubot (https://github.com/github/hubot#external-scripts). \n. It should continue to exist as a package, we haven't mapped out what exactly we wish to happen.\n. Because no one offered to create a pull request after 2 months. I don't have time to fix scripts that I personally don't use.\n. I closed the correct issue. Hubot is run in a \"trusted\" environment. If you don't trust the people you allow to access Hubot, I think you should stop allowing them access to Hubot.\n. I'll merge any pull request for a fix if you're happy to do it and retain functionality of the script! :+:\n. Hubot will also ignore its own messages\n. Try not to run hubot from the master repository as this has fixes and maybe bugs which aren't in the released version on npm. Installation instructions are in the main README.\n. Heroku will forward the out facing port 80 to the internal port of the application. So you just need to use the Heroku URL of your hubot without port.\n. Could you split out the hubot-plugin.sh into another pull request please.\n. The problem adding it is if people use it and have issues, we'll have to send them to your for issues, so it's up to you ;)\n. What's this pull request for exactly?\n. No probs\n. You're looking for the service hooks in the repo admin tab.\n. If you're using IRC, you could just use the IRC hook in the service hooks? It should include a link to the compare for that specific commits pushed.\n. :+1:\n. It appears that replace is trying to be called on an instance of TextMessage some where in the stack\n2013-06-17T14:52:52.244151+00:00 app[web.1]: TypeError: Object #<TextMessage> has no method 'replace'\n. I'm also not entirely sure why the eardropping script fires its own robot.receive call: https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/eardropping.coffee#L70\n. In your deployed hubot there should be a scripts/ directory, this contains things like ping.coffee and google-images.coffee. You can put your script into that directory and commit the changes. Hubot will load all the scripts in that directory.\n. Did you use hubot --create ./path/myhubot to create you hubot?\n. The scripts/ directory isn't included in the .gitignore that hubot generates: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/src/templates/.gitignore\n. You should probably restart and follow the instructions found here: https://github.com/github/hubot/wiki/Deploying-Hubot-onto-Heroku\n. No. bin/hubot --create ~/myhubot will create the directory structure that you will need to git init, git add . and git commit -m 'initial commit' into, it will have a scripts directory in where you can place your scripts, then add those to the git repo and deploy to heroku.\n. You're welcome :+1:\n. This branch isn't actually needed anymore as I left msg.http in v3.\n. msg.http isn't being deprecated anymore\n. Check the vthree-rethink branch.\n. > At the very least, this script could be modified to not work for blank query. That'd be a decent fix for now.\nThis is the fix I was thinking when I read this. So :+1:\n. yup it puts one in, if you wanna throw another PR up for that change that'll be cool\n. Returns in coffee-script are implicit the above code is the same as:\ncoffeescript\nif root?.children?.length > 0\n  return (childrenOfType(child, nodeType) for child in root.children)\nelse\n  return []\nThat's the deal with those brackets.\n. Feel free to open a pull request to add the suggestions. Generally scripts in this repo will only get updated/fixed by people who use that script.\n. :+1:\nWould love to see the GitHub scripts moved into an external package like hubot-github, so we can add tests and dependencies. So users don't manually have to specify dependencies.\n. I was going to modify the scripts.coffee in the vthree-rethink branch to allow selective script reloading. I swear I had pushed a branch to my fork, but looks like I didn't. So you could have logical npm packages which had all the dependencies included but you could also specify selective scripts you wished to load. Hubot would pass the \"scripts\" that wanted loading to the index.coffee in the package, which would then selectively load them.\n. If you want you could open a pull request to rename it, it hasn't been released yet.\n. Just going to merge this as there has been plenty of time for people to know Google Reader is dead (:rip:).\n. good example for commit messages - https://github.com/github/hubot/commit/7bc256fbff2788fda3280e7db6cd088ce6410380\n. I use git commit -m 'short message' and then I'll sometimes drop into git commit which will open vim and includes highlighting for recommended lengths. I'll write the 'subject' of the commit then on new lines I'll explain the commit in a bit more detail.\n\n. This is fine, it shouldn't break anything, although a minor change to hubot would be needed I think so it knows about the section when parsing.\n. I'll port that change into the vthree-rethink branch\n. I've added tags as a valid section to Hubot, so you're free to update hubot scripts now!\n. We can also update hubot and the help to associate these categories with the help output. /cc @technicalpickles \n. Are we talking moving things into external npm packages? If so :+1: from me.\nI need to ship my change that allows users to specify scripts in packages they wish to load.\n. :+1:\n. Created the organization, going to add a template project for external script package, then maybe a README repo explaining the point of the repo, then we can start forking packages for people to manage.\n. Added the https://github.com/hubot-scripts/packages repository to the org so people can file issues on to have their packages forked.\n. For boolean environment variables you can say if it's set to any value it's true and if it's unset it is false. That is the cleanest way.\n. Is there a reason this requires http or https instead of the built in HTTP request handling?\n. LOL, this is pretty cool\n. I already documented it a while ago lol\n. Should be moved to an external package now :laughing: \n. :+1:\n. Give https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-example a gander, it's an example package I wrote.\n. I can add you as a member to the hubot-scripts org @ymendel so you can push the package to their if that is more convenient.\n. Is there a reason for creating a Message class instead of just creating 2 functions which take some params?\n. https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/issues/1113\n. You may wish to read here https://github.com/hubot-scripts/packages about getting your package forked to the hubot-scripts organization.\n. I also refuse to acknowledge someone made this script.\n. In the spirit of #1113, we're recommending folks start packages for new scripts rather than adding to this repository. See that issue for details, and let us know if you have any questions!\nAnd this already exists https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-what-the-fox\n. It won't ever work with Heroku, because a deployed app is not in a Git repo.\n. There is not really any required Heroku variable we can check, so just adding a notice to the documentation header would be best.\n. I don't feel like adding \"environment\" checking to every script for every possible \"environment\" is the way to go.\n. But it's not required, so you cannot guarantee it exists.\n. In the spirit of #1113, we are actually moving away from adding new scripts to this repository in favor of contributors maintaining their own repository and npm packages for scripts.\n. In the spirit of #1113, we're recommending folks start packages for new scripts rather than adding to this repository. See that issue for details, and let us know if you have any questions!\n. Forked to hubot-scripts and added as collab\n. In the spirit of #1113, we're recommending folks start packages for new scripts rather than adding to this repository. See that issue for details, and let us know if you have any questions!\n. Please try to refrain from mentioning me in Hubot related issues as I have stepped down from development (see: https://gist.github.com/tombell/6703983)\n. The @robot.send is back from when the adapter was an extended Robot. The actual send function is in the Robot.Response, which delegates to the adapter. I can add a send and reply function into Robot which will call the adapter's send and reply, it will still need a User instance passing to it though.\n. That's underscore.js.\nAlthough it would be better to use CoffeeScripts native for x in y iteration.\n. You should write the array like:\n``` coffeescript\ngitHelp =\n  create: '...'\n  clone: '...'\n```\nSo it's more idiomatic with CoffeeScript.\n. May want to change these to robot.reply as they seem rather generic, and may trigger in general conversation.\n. Could you remove these dependencies from the package.json before I merge this pull request, we no longer put the dependencies in here because it becomes a message, and suggest people put the required dependencies into their hubot's package.json.\n. These two robot.hear should probably be robot.respond and you'll be able to remove the ^(?:hubot )? bit of the regex.\n. This should be changed to Robot = require('hubot').robot().\n. Eval's code on a web service, not the hubot, so there is no issue really.\n. the 2nd one is suppose to be underscore.string.\n. Not 100% certain on what the formatting of the help for keys is going to be like, they can be retrofitted once formatting is done.\n. It's JavaScript.\n. When people usually contribute to an open source project the license is usually the one of the actual project. If the license differs to the hubot-scripts license, then people should release the script in it's own package in my opinion.\n. Here the description will suffice, commands imply something you type to trigger it, where as this just detects URLs.\n. Might be a better option to rename Commands: to Triggers: which will cover everything. Thoughts?\n. Could these two lines get indented?\n. The .* and the start and front aren't required.\n. I'm unsure whether I like this change from a user perspective.\n. I would actually prefer HUBOT_JENKINS_USER and HUBOT_JENKINS_PASSWORD which makes it easier for users to set up and use.\n. What do you do for the rest of hubot then?\n. These need quoting so people can copy straight into package.json.\n. This should be:\n```\nCommands:\n  None\nURLs:\n  GET /hubot/say?message=[&room=&type=<type]\n. This should be renamed `Notes` and moved to after `Commands`.\n. Could you format the description like the following https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/commitmessage.coffee\n. These need changing to match the style of other scripts.\n. `util` comes with node so isn't required here.\n. Add extra new line here.\n. Remove `None`.\n. Remove extra white space.\n. Description needs updating.\n.\nsave_interval     = process.env.HUBOT_S3_BRAIN_SAVE_INTERVAL or 30 * 60\n```\n. See comment above.\n. This needs to specify the npm package version, not repo URL.\n. Change this to be:\ncoffeescript\nreturn unless robot.brain.data.ambuses?\n. Could you remove this line break as it will break the automatic parsing of help.\n. We should probably make sure that scripts using similar environment variables use the same names\n. Actually, would hubot be the app authorising with Twitter, or the individual scripts?\n. Could move the Twitter related things into an external package for 3.0.0\n. You will probably want to change this to match whitespace either side of the 'mention' as it may match @ in the middle of text as well (e.g emails).\n. Should remove the ^, it's not required and will break the regex\n. Doesn't need => here, -> will do.\n. Might be worth uppercasing this name to show it's a constant.\n. You might wish to use CoffeeScripts string interpolation here instead of the + lots of times.\n. A link to the docs is good if it explains it properly :+1:\n. Seems like a pretty good use case.\n. These are built in dependencies so this can be changed to None.\n. are hubot and org variables or part of the command?\n. This can be changed to if content.error?.title\n. and remove the (), they're not needed for no params, also they look unsightly :)\n. ",

And as a side note, I did look into using JSON instead of XML to remove that dependency. NewRelic's API is only JSON for some of its things unfortunately :sweat:\n. Doesn't look like you were assigned.\n. Do you have githubot in your package.json? Looks like you'll need that for at least github-issues-link.coffee.\nIf that's it, can update the comments to that effect.\n. I haven't used those myself, so I'm not sure. I'd suggest doing npm install githubot, and grok the version it installed, and then use that.\n. @tombell I did a pass awhile back for the helpCommands. Maybe we can add some help formatting for specifying dependencies for a script?\n. @travisjeffery the scripts in hubot's repo are in generally in good shape. I was pretty happy with how iced-coffee-weather was shaping up, except that I realized recently that the ----- lines get interpreted as help commands.\n@sirkitree if it's just formatting, wording, etc, I think a single pull request for all is fine.\n. @tombell :+1:\nOne reason I went with all the '-------' and '=====' was to be more markdown like, as if to use docco or similar to generate docs\n. I started apply this to hubot's src/scripts. After a few, having headings for things that were None seemed like noise. Except maybe description, which probably should be a real description.\nAlso, a few new headings I encountered needing:\n- URLs: for routing stuff\n- Examples: for examples of commands, when it's not obvious how to use\n. Template for copy-pasta into scripts:\n# Description:\n#   None\n#\n# Dependencies:\n#   None\n#\n# Configuration:\n#   None\n#\n# Commands:\n#   None\n#\n# Author:\n#   None\nAlso, this may be me being picky, but not a fan of the leading/trailing lines.\n. I was thinking about Configuration, and it probably would be good to have notes about what they are. The aws.coffee had this, and so does wunderlist.coffee which I'm looking at now. I could imagine something like hubot help configuration listing out all these environment variables and what they are for. Those shouldn't show up for hubot help for commands though.\nHaving 'help commands' be any line with a - can be kind of annoying, especially if you have stuff legitimately hyphenated words. It also means that HUBOT_WUNDERLIST_SMTP_HOST           - your smtp host e.g. smtp.gmail.com would match, even if it's not a command. For this case at least, I think we can update hubot to skip over lines that start with HUBOT_.\n. There's just s and t left. Of course, there's 47 between them... I'll see how far I can get on em.\n. Calling it night. Just 's' left now. Give a shout if/when you pick back up on these.\n. Also, the help commands should be updated to be 'hubot' instead of '@hu'. Latest hubot will handle transforming the name from hubot to your robot's name\n. Hi @pgieser! We already applied the documentation header to tumblr.coffee, at least a first pass. Could you please rebase your changes against master?\n. Confirmed this. It looks like the instance being iterated over doesn't have a tagSet, for whatever reason.\n/cc @Iristyle\n. Thanks! Yeah, for my instances, there was no tag metadata. I'm not too savvy on EC2 things, but this might be an old old instance that doesn't have that.\nEither way, it looks like it's definitely possible to not have a name tag. Maybe fall back to instanceId if it's not present?\n. Looks like Commands section is missing a description, which means hubot help stranger wouldn't give an indicator of what it does:\nclaptrap> claptrap help stranger\nclaptrap> claptrap stranger me\nCould you add one please?\nAlso, it appears to be throwing an error while trying to parse JSON. It looks like http://facehold.it/hubot is returning an error now:\nAn error has occurred: {\"code\":\"ECONNRESET\"}\n. If you used this in campfire, it wouldn't embed the image :( BUT, if you add #.gif to the end it will. Can you update to include that please?\nAlso, there's an existing pattern for animals as a service, ie pugme.coffee and corgime.coffee. Could you rename the command to match those, ie cat me? Bonus points for cat bomb support!\n. Another thing I noticed is that there isn't really a permalink for lo.no.de, which means if this gets pasted in campfire, everyone probably is looking at a different cat. For shared experience stuff, I think it'd be preferred to see the same thing, but that's just me.\n. Nice! Quick question though... are both scripts needed? It looks like there should only be moarcatsme.coffee.\n. Merged, thanks!\n. \n. #533 was merged, so we can safely close this guy.\n. Curious, what would the advantage of using this instead of the Campfire post-commit hook? I could imagine a few cases where you want to do something special with the commit data, before posting to campfire, instead of a raw import. But, that'd always be custom, so you woudn't use a hubot-scripts script.\n. That's just crazy talk :) \nAlso worth noting that the GitHub Service Hooks has an assload of different service hooks, and that it's open source.\nI prefer code that someone else has to maintain ;) But, I could imagine there's less effort to use a hubot script, than getting a github-services change merged & deployed.\n. > So after all what hook would you use then?\n\nThat depends on what you are using, right? If you are using IRC, you'd use the IRC hook. If you are using Campfire, you'd use the Campfire hook, etc\nSo building an gh-hook would be another place beside hubot/hubot-scrits where hubot related stuff would be placed.\n\nNot really? The GitHub service hook isn't really specific to hubot at all.\nWhatever though. This is still in the running for merging.\nOn Sep 5, 2012, at 9:43 AM, Ole Michaelis notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nAnd I'd prefere to have all hubot related at the same place.

Side note, but the scoped-http-client has support for auth a little more directly, like:\nmsg.auth(user,password)\nBut it too is doing Basic instead of Digest.\n. Merged this and others, thanks!\n. While the original is definitely painful to type, some folks may be used to it, and would be surprised when it goes away after merging & releasing this. Could you please add responds for the original message to continue to be support, or at least to warn that it's been changed?\nAlso, I would consider changing uptime to uptimerobot to be inline with the backend service for this.\n. I left in-line comments on the script. The main thing is that it looks like you assume that a user is going to copy & paste this into their scripts directory, changing the api key and competitors.\nWhen things are part of hubot-scripts, they are added to a bot's hubot-scripts.json, which means they need to be configurable at runtime (via the environment), or configurable from inside by storing it in the robot brain.\nLet me know if that makes sense, or if you need more pointers on getting this ready.\n. It's unfortunate, but it's actually a separate project: https://github.com/Aupajo/hubot-script-catalog\n. This looks a lot better than what we have right now. In particular, having stuff hardcoded requiring a user to edit the script is a no-no, so it's good to see the environment used.\nOne thing I'm struggling with to test this is finding in Asana a workspace id and a project id. Can you please update the script to include details about that in the configuration section?\n. Merged, thanks!\n. I think this script is sufficiently complex, that it might be better off as a separate project than hubot-scripts. In particular, if there are any issues, I don't know if I'd be able to debug it. By having it be your own project, folks could file issues against it, and you'd be able to see it.\nThoughts?\n. I'm not sure how well documented or common it is to make other npm packages that add things to hubot. If that's not easy, or documented, please drop a GitHub issue on hubot, and we can work on that.\n. I'd recommend using cheerio rather than soupselect and htmlparser, becasue it has a much more usable interface. iced-coffee-weather.coffee has an example of pulling things out of html using it.\n. It's a new dependency for hubot in the field, either way. Mostly because you can't guess if insult users are already using cheerio or other dependency.\nAs a maintainer, I'd rather see cheerio, because it's a lot easier to grok what markup is being selected, and what is being done with it. Lines like this always make me wince:\n\nquote[0].children[0].data\n\nOn Oct 22, 2012, at 12:47 PM, Brandon Valentine notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nWord. Thanks for the feedback. There's 17-18 scripts in src/scripts already using soupselect/htmlparser versus 1 using cheerio. If the intent is to move the rest to cheerio I'm happy to resubmit this pull, but otherwise wanted to avoid introducing a new dependency to hubot users in the field.\nCheers,\nBrandon\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Sure, go for it :) Just send a new pull request for them.\n\nOn Oct 22, 2012, at 9:38 PM, Brandon Valentine notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI've added an additional commit to the pull that replaces soupselect/htmlparser with cheerio. Much cleaner. I had just initially gone with the tools in use already in the codebase. Now I'm tempted to go tacke the rest of them using soupselect/htmlparser.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Don't forget to update the dependency to reflect cheerio :)\n. This is something I've wanted for awhile actually, and this is a good start :)\n\nOne thing I noticed is that the cronjob only gets set if there's a twitter_query set at load time. That would mean the cronjob wouldn't run unless you set it in the environment, despite using command to set a query :( You'd have to restart hubot for that to take effect.\nAnd speaking of cron, node.js actually has a simple way to do stuff on an interval without adding a dependency:\nsetInterval someMethod, 1000 * number_of_seconds\n. @sachinr was it intentional to close this? I've been using this since you mentioned, and pretty happy with it.\nFor @tylercal's about the adapter differences, you really shouldn't be accessing the adapter directly. Breaks encapsulation, or something.\nTry robot.messageRoom, ie as used in scoutapp.coffee.\n. I don't use cloudapp, but would like to test before merging. Could you share a cloudapp link perhaps for such testing?\nAlso, would it be useful to keep both old and new URL formats around? There may be old URLs kicking around that people may paste.\n. Merged, thanks!\n. Merged, thanks!\n. Could you please remove the change to the ChangeLog? Not sure where that came from, but I'll update it when I release.\nAlso, I think it'd be better to use respond instead of hear to be a little more explicit.\n. Merged, thanks!\n. This will fail in fun ways if one or both of those environment variables aren't set. Could you add some error checking to send back a reply to the effect of them needing to be set for normal usage?\n. Gave this a shot, and had two problems. First, I think repo needs to be like user/repo. So, that should be mentioned in the doc section.\nSecond, I'm getting ERROR 401 Bad credentials. Apparently the GitHub API doesn't do straight up API token stuff anymore, so this is some auth nonsense. I'm not sure how exactly to acquire that, so it'd be worth including that in the documentation too.\n. I don't use this particular script, or fogbuz in general, but could you include some details of how you are trying to use the script, and what output (if any) you are getting? It might not post an error to campfire, so you'll have to check the log (depends on how you deployed).\nLooking over the script now, it doesn't look like it's checking the response it gets back, so it might be failing silent. It also doesn't seem to output anything if it doesn't find a bug, so it's possible that if bug conditional is evaluating to false.\n. Adding some recent committers to fogbugz.coffee in case they've seen this or can help out /cc @jaysherby\n. @earlonrails could you resubmit these as three separate pull requests? it's a lot harder to review and merge if they are all lumped together\n. For future pull requests, mind keeping it to one script per? A little easier to discuss things :)\nMost of the feedback on transmission applies to xmbc as well.\nOne other general remark is a style thing, where coffeescript/node/javascript are typically camel-case names instead of snake-case, ie getTorrents, not get_torrents.\n. Would you actually mind splitting this into two pull requests, one per script?\n. I tried it just now, and it seems to work for me. Maybe it was an intermittent issue with tryruby.org?\nclaptrap> claptrap ruby puts \"hello world\"\nclaptrap> Shell: claptrap at your service!\nclaptrap> Shell: => \"hello world\"\n. I get the feeling this script might be doing things that are better/easily done in from the CI server. I could be totally wrong.\nIf that is the case (me being wrong), I would like to see more detailed about how and why you'd use this script in the documentation section before merging.\n. Been thinking about this a bit more, I don't think this is something I can easily be maintaining in hubot-scripts, as it requires quite a bit of setup to test. Any chance you could look at spinning it off as a separate npm package?\n. Is this intended to message someone that is in the room? Like, you'd use completion for their name? If so, you can look at robot.userForId, robot.userForName, and robot.userForFuzzyName.\n. Last comment, I swear :) Is 'tellnow' a good command name for this? What about im, or tell?\n. Could you include a version too? The idea is you can copy & paste it into package.json.\n. Merged, thanks!\n. Curious, what errors were you getting from parsing? I've been using this recently, and hadn't seen any errors.\nAlso, the echo of the URL is intentional. The values you can output from the API are useful, but I've found almost always want to dig around the web app anyways.\n. Okay, so this is very weird. I was able to use the updated header for the API key, no problem there.\nThe problem is the data I get back matches up with how the existing script works. I did msg.send inspect json, and here's what I got:\nhubot> { '@': { type: 'array' },\n  threshold_value: \n   [ { '@': [Object] },\n     { '@': [Object] },\n     { '@': [Object] },\n     { '@': [Object] },\n     { '@': [Object] },\n     { '@': [Object] },\n     { '@': [Object] },\n     { '@': [Object] },\n     { '@': [Object] } ] }\nSo, I'm getting back threshold_value with an array of  @s back, instead of threshold-values with threshold-value having an array of $s. I can't really explain why this is, but the code could at least plan for this. I have something like:\n```\n           threshold_values = json['threshold_value'] || (json['threshold-values'] && json['threshold-values']['threshold_value']) || []\n       lines = threshold_values.map (threshold_value) ->\n         pair = threshold_value['@'] || threshold_value['$']\n         \"#{pair['name']}: #{pair['formatted_metric_value']}\"\n\n```\nDoes this work for you?\n. Please send one pull request per script. A lot harder to give succinct feedback on it otherwise.\n. Actually, it looks like you did a pull request from master, and had added more scripts. Please split off topic branches, and do one pull request per branch/script.\n. Did you intend to close this? Re-open if you'd like it to be considered for merging.\n. I'd be pretty hesitant to add this. The squirrel makes enough of an appearance with the stricter regex.\nMaybe there could be an environment variable to determine the strictness? Or maybe even the regex itself.\n. Much. Thanks :)\n. Please send one pull request per script. It's easier to give feedback, and merge each individual script. Also, I'm concerned you've totally changed the sudo script into a hubot extension. That might be better as a separate npm package.\n. Merged, thanks!\n. Ah, see you added this github services instead. Just give a shout if you still want/need this guy.\n. Please do one-pull request per script. Thanks :)\n. What version of xml2js are you using? I don't use fogbugz, so can't really test too well.\n/cc @dstrelau\n. No problem. Since you were quick on the feedback feedback, I left you some more :)\n. Confirmed working as well :) Although, if the name tag is missing, is it worth displaying 'missing'? I think it'd make sense to either exclude display of it all together, or maybe more detail like 'missing name tag' or 'unknown name tag'\n. Good idea. However... multiple msg.sends in a row doesn't mean the message will hit campfire in that order. It'd be better to pass all those strings to a single msg.send call, ie:\nmsg.send object.alt, object.title, object.img, object.alt\nI know it was already like this, but may as well fix it to be more correct while we're touching it.\n. Looks like some changes to twss got mixed in here because the pull request was for master. Mind splitting off to multiple branches, and resubmitting?\n. Both seem to work here, but it would be a good thing to use imgur anyways to be safe.\n. I don't use Jira, so I can't test so well. Including original author in case he has feedback /cc @stuartf\n. I'm not sure I'm following the use case. You're suggesting this to get access to the Campfire credentials, as if to use them to setup a GitHub hook or something else using the Campfire API?\nI'm not so sure that convenience is worthwhile. If you are specifically trying to setup GitHub service hooks, maybe should implement that more directly?\n. I think the attributes are padded so that the actual values are lined up. If that's the case, then Description and Food Pairing would throw that off.\n. Looks like this may be handled by #625. yes/no?\n. For new scripts, please submit as separate pull requests. It makes it easier to individual review & merge.\n. Noticed this several times, but never tracked down a fix... thanks!\n. Was this intended to be closed? I mean, Archer is great and all, but there is no but.\n. This looks a bit redundant like you said. Maybe extract out the repeated code to a helper that takes a callback?\nI don't use pivotal myself, but open to your other changes as well.\n. This looks really familiar. I can't find the ticket off hand, but this has been proposed before. From memory, this change broke when I tested it from my hubot/newrelic account. I'm not sure if it's a newrelic thing, or a xml2js like you mentioned.\nWhat version of xml2js are you using?\n. This still doesn't work for me out of the box. But, I use a custom version of this anyways, so may as well merge if it's working for people.\n. @cylence Whenever I get the time to do hubot things (not often), I go through all the notifications I have for it, working from the oldest, and either give feedback or merge. I'm like a month behind at this point...\nI can't speak of what other maintainers do.\n. Submitting a pull request without any kind of testing is kind of... :sweat: . Please re-open once you know it works for sure.\n. Please split this out into 3 pull requests: one for each new script, and one for the update to the f-ing weather. Lot easier to give feedback & merge that way. Thanks!\n. I'm pretty sure I've been burned by this one before. Thanks for the fix! /cc @jnewland \n. @rafaelmagu as is, you wouldn't be able to. If you can find a node library to post to hipchat, you'd be able to use that. You might also want to check https://github.com/hipchat/hubot-hipchat for documentation or discussion around that, and file an issue if not.\nHope that helps!\n. Yeah, this is more clear to a reader, but the commands listed by help aren't actually valid and would silently fail if you said them. You could change the respond blocks to be optionally prefixed by memegen to fix though.\n. @holybit it's using respond, not hear, so it's only responding when someone says hubot Y U NO foobar, not randomly in a sentence.\n. Adding some author of this script and others that have contributed in the past for feedback /cc @dstrelau @mps @jaysherby \n. Re-opening, since there are still things to fix :)\n. @bjtitus if you could attach a pull request, we can see about getting it merged.\n. This has come up a few times actually. I'm thinking we add backwards compatibility like:\ncoffeescript\n  userForName: (name) ->\n    logger.warning \"robot.userForName deprecated, use robot.brain.userForName instead\"\n    brain.userForName(name)\nThat way, things keep working as is, with warnings to drive it towards the new style. I'm not sure the original motivation for moving userForBlah to the brain, but may be worth keeping this interface, so scripts just interact with the robot, rather than the brain. Thoughts @tombell?\n. Well, there's a way to deal with this. Semantic versioning :) Deprecate in minor releases, remove for next major release.\nAlso, if we are expecting people to see the error, the least we could do is make the backwards compatible method raise an error pointing the user in the right direction.\n. There's nothing really wrong with super high version number.\nIt also wouldn't have wait ages for releases. You would just be less aggressive about compatability breaking changes (ie for major release), and instead introduce more deprecations early on.\nOn Feb 24, 2013, at 7:10 PM, Tom Bell notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI don't like semantic versioning for this type of project, with a lot of breaking changes you would like to release you have to either: a) what ages to release changes, or b) end up with version 14.0.0\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. I haven't used pivotal.coffee before myself, so adding folks who have contributed to it in the past: /cc @assaf @omarkhan @christianchristensen @karlfreeman\n. If anyone out there is using hubot & Pivotal Tracker, I'd love to see them take over maintaing this script as an external script cc https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/issues/1113\n. As long as the script is in the repo and hasn't been extracted, I think it's fine to leave open.\n. Once there's a new release of wolfram, we can update wolfram.coffee's documentation to cite a dependency on the new release.\n. Not familiar, but HTTP Code 401 is unauthorized. For my bot, I have HUBOT_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, HUBOT_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, and HUBOT_AWS_EC2_REGIONS.\n\nIt is correctly spitting us-east-1 at you, so it must know HUBOT_AWS_EC2_REGIONS, so double check your HUBOT_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and HUBOT_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY variables. It'd be easy to get those two switched.\n. It looks like there hasn't been a hubot-scripts release since that script was added, which would cause the problem you are seeing.\n. In that case, should we just remove them?\n. I'm okay with removing the existing scripts if they don't run, and we aren't requiring contributing users to add them.\nI think we would need to figure out hubot's testing first, and when that works, we can start applying it (or not) to hubot-scripts, probably incrementally (too much work to apply to all). I think there is still value in having them, as it would be a good way for people demonstrate the use of their scripts. It could make things a little easier to maintain, as we'd have some baseline for how those scripts would work. Also, if we required tests in hubot-scripts, it might mean less silly scripts like 'take the blame'.\n. I think I'm missing something, especially if it doesn't reply with anything. Even without the script, you can say anything you want to hubot, and it will respond with silence (unless there's a script that responds...).\n. @rdohms pull request welcome, should be a small change around line 31. I don't have a redmine install to test against, so you may be in a better position to test a fix.\n. @tombell I can push... was there anything to do before releasing?\n. And so it has been npm published. @atmos could you add @tombell to the npm packages so he can cut releases please?\n. > Scripts are moved into subdirectories within the current /github/hubot-scripts repository so that each plugin could have a package.json and then the main script file. I think the scripts directory is just too big for this now though. I just looked and there's 420 scripts in src/scripts.\nAn interesting idea, but I think you are right that there's way too many scripts in there now to split out a directory per.\n\nPlugins are pulled out of hubot-scripts and managed within their own author's repository, this might be difficult to get authors to do but who knows\n\nWe can do something iteratively, with the more complex scripts and scripts with dependencies coming out first. I think in the near future though, hubot-scripts can remain a grab bag of scripts til all the external stuff is worked out.\n\nA hubot-scripts organization is created and individual plugins are created under that. This is similar to what opscode ended up doing with their chef cookbooks, going from https://github.com/opscode/cookbooks(a company repository with a bunch of cookbooks in it) to https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks(an organization that manages multiple repositories).\n\nI've considered this for other reasons, and I was thinking a hubot organization. That way, hubot, hubot-scripts, hubot.github.com, and any other hubot related scripts can be moved under it, and managed separately from the github org.\n\nBy looking at npm's package.json documentation it looks like we'd have the majority of the support right away from the specs of that file. The biggest discrepancy being how to specify the environment based configuration.\n\nI'm not sure I'm a fan of this. It moves the documentation further away from the code, and also having to parse the package.json in addition to the scripts.\n. @psynaptic based on the stack trace, looks more like a hubot-xmpp thing than the factoid, but glad it's working now\n. Could you add backwards comparability with HOSTNAME? This would break unexpectedly for users upgrading.\nI'd imagine something like building a URL from the HOSTNAME.\nOn Mar 28, 2013, at 5:34 AM, Jens Jahnke notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nRenamed variable HUBOT_TEAMCITY_HOSTNAME to HUBOT_TEAMCITY_URL\nExpected notation of HUBOT_TEAMCITY_URL is scheme://host:port (for example https://teamcity.example.com)\nYou can merge this Pull Request by running\ngit pull https://github.com/jan0sch/hubot-scripts master\nOr view, comment on, or merge it at:\nhttps://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/pull/853\nCommit Summary\nRefactored to support https connections.\nFile Changes\nM src/scripts/teamcity.coffee (16)\nPatch Links:\nhttps://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/pull/853.patch\nhttps://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/pull/853.diff\n.

So far, I was able to:\n- document the commands and environment variables\n- add error checking for environment variables missing\n- cleanup formatting of incidents (ie underline 'acknowledged' and 'triggered', since it confused me the first time when there were triggered or acknowledged, but not both)\n\nThe last thing I'd like to see in this is getting rid of the caveat that pagerduty & chat user name has to match. Thereotically, a msg has a user object, but the metadata of that will depend on the adapter. campfire (might) have an email, which could be looked up against the pagerduty API, but that changes the assumption to the pagerduty & campfire email are the same. The Shell does not have that though, but maybe could be fixed to.\nAnother thought is to have a pager me command to tell the bot your pagerduty id. that'd help a little, but it'd make it more manual for new team members.\n. @martinisoft yeah, I think that'll be needed. I would still like to see if we can correctly guess based on a user's name/email what their pagerduty thing is\n.

Changes pushed, for anyone wanting to try them!\nOnly things I can think of to consider fixing/updating:\n- moment('something').calendar() doesn't include timezones, which can be confusing for a distributed team\n- process.env.HUBOT_PAGERDUTY_SCHEDULE_ID needs to be checked if it's defined, because API calls will fail without it\n. I renamed pager me page to pager me trigger because I thought it was a little less confusing, and also matches the PagerDuty language. And I fixed the error checking of HUBOT_PAGERDUTY_SCHEDULE_ID. \nThe only question is that moment('something').calendar(). It returns like:\nRejoice, Blackhole! Josh Nichols has the pager from Today at 11:41 PM until Today at 11:42 PM\nNo timezones. I'm guessing it's the TZ of where hubot is running.\n. It's more a display problem. The timezone we get back is in the right timezone, but calendar() doesn't show it.\nOn Apr 11, 2013, at 3:58 AM, Tom Bell notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nWelcome to dates in JS :P, you can UTC it like moment(blah).utc().calendar().\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. I had contacted pagerduty about adding support for creating notes at some point, and they recently added it, so added support for that here: hubot pager note 123345 wow this is such a note.\n\nI also changed the hubot pager me 1 to use format instead of calendar. Moment used to have support for nice conversions to like EST and whanot, but it's been deprecated timrwood/moment#162 . For simplicity, leaving it with the default format.\nAt this point, I think it's 'ready', but like to have some other folks test it on in their hubots first. Particularly @jnewland, so he can use this script directly via hubot-scripts when it's merged.\n. Annnnd, one last change hopefully. I switched to using token authentication. This let's us use requester_id in some places, which means that when you look at incidents on the website, it shows ack/resolve/notes as being from the person who said it in chat, rather than the API user.\n. :rotating_light: :crown: :boom: :sparkles:\n. Released hubot-scripts 2.4.3 with this included.\n. What version of hubot-scripts are you using? And what are you saying to hubot, and what is he replying with?\n. What about something like HUBOT_YOURTRACK_URL? That way, you can encode the scheme, username, password, password, host, and base path in one variable.

One last comment... if someone is already using this, and the update goes out, it will just stop working because it's using HUBOT_JIRA_DOMAIN. Maybe you could default HUBOT_JIRA_URL to \"https://#{process.env.HUBOT_JIRA_DOMAIN}\" if it's defined?\n. Looks like weather used to use google, but was updated in f02306d46748cdcb2c657dc3f5116072d83172e2 to use forecast since google deprecated their stuff. So probably :)\n. If we're going to remove one, probably should remove both and move it to an external package cc https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/issues/1113\n. Thanks!\n. @gabriel403 could you elaborate a bit? Did you create a new bot recently and didn't see hubot-scripts.json or the dependency in package.json? Or was this an existing bot? If the latter, it's possible someone removed it from your bot.\nHere's the template used to create new bots, which includes hubot-scripts.json and package.json with hubot-scripts.\n. > in the docs branch that is meant to deprecate the wiki it says the best way to keep an up to date hubot is to clone the repo and just use that, but of course you don't get all the bits if you just do that.\nHmm, could you point out where it says that? That's actually the opposite of what I'm intending with the docs branch.\n. @gabriel403 yes, that's exactly it! I'll see if I can word smith that a bit.\n. @ameketa thanks, this looks like a great addition!\nOne thing I'm wondering... did you test with restarting hubot between the reminder created and when it's delivered? The brain is used to persist that, and I'm not so sure that a msg object would get saved and reloaded correctly.\n. @ameketa you may be able to pull things off the msg to pass to the reminder, and then do something to recreate a Response instance (which msg is, despite the name): https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/src/response.coffee.\n. @ameketa I just tested and works as expected. Thanks! Could you file another issue about the file-brain loaded thing?\n. Awesome, was hoping someone would write this :grin: \nWas looking at the regex, and was wondering if the goal of using a robot.hear /^fu/ vsrobot.respond /fu/` was to capture more times people nature say fu to something? I general, a lot of scripts that are 'command like' use respond instead of hear, so that might be worth thinking about.\n. Sounds good, thanks!\n. Looks good, thanks for submitting!\nSeveral other of the github-related scripts use githubot under the hood. Could you take a look at using that instead? I suspect it'll simplify a few things in the script, in addition to being more consistent across other scripts.\n. @spajus no, but you can do GET/POSTS to whatever URLs. Check the README, ie:\ncoffeescript\ngithub.get \"users/foo/repos\", {type: \"owner\"}, (repos) ->\n  console.log repos[0].url\n. @spajus I just saw that dependency. If it doesn't work out, we can go with what we have, and file tickets for githubot.\n. That's a great idea @tombell. Do you think it'd be a package per script, or\none bigger package for all github related scripts?

That's awesome! I think the main thing is, if this is going to be a generally available script, it's either more generally named or make it configurable with an environment variable. How does that sound?\n. Merged, thanks!\n. Keep in mind that robot.hear will match anywhere in the line, so if someone said something like 'do you know the countdown set us up the bomb', it would respond to that. I'd definitely suggest using robot.respond instead. Just make sure to add hubot in the front of the commands in the docs though (it gets translated to your robot name when /help is run).\n. Also, it looks like this includes files from #1047.\n. Merged, thanks!\n. I think some adjustments to the regex could fix this as well. The ( me )?(.*) means that hubot rajinikanth technicalpickles would have msg.match[3] as ' technicalpickles'. But, if it was:\n/(rajinikanth|rajini)( me)? (.*)/\nThat would have msg.match[3] as 'technicalpickles', not requiring any string trimming. This would also be a good opportunity to make the first two groups non-capturing since they aren't being used, so then the listener can use:\n/(?:rajinikanth|rajini)(?: me)? (.*)/\nThat'd make the username be msg.match[1].\nWhat do you think?\n. /(?:rajinikanth|rajini ) would only have a trailing space only for rajini, because of the way | works. I think the one I pasted earlier would work best, ie /(?:rajinikanth|rajini)(?: me)? (.*)/\n. Awesome!

Merged, thanks!\n. @w33ble the pattern I like to use is to have the robot.hear happen regardless, but have the listener check it every time and msg.reply that it's not configured. As is, it only gets logged to the console, so someone trying to use it would be confused when it's not posting things. Sound reasonable?\n. What about the existing excuse me? For developers already using it, they'd only have silence from their hubot.\nMaybe add that back, and choose a random excuse from both? Or, use more generic excuses like from http://myexcuse.is/\n. Merged, thanks!\n. So many feels :sob:\nMaybe we could remove most of the functionality instead of the script? Otherwise, people using it in hubot-scripts.json will have failures at start up time because it doesn't exist, and they'll probably end up back here. Instead, could do something like replace the robot.respond to notify the user it's gone, as well as update documentation to reflect that. Sound reasonable?\n. Merged, thanks!\n.

I was going to cut a release, so figured I'd include this.\n. @ymendel don't worry about it. I'll look at extracting the scripts we use out of this repo to their own packages at some point.\n. This changes the chat interface a bit. May want to consider making the environment optional, with a default.\n. Ah, I see it now, it just wasn't where I was expected. I would have thought there was something like (staging|production)? in the robot.respond, and then msg.match[1] or 'staging'.\n.

Maybe not, but it at least covers the default supported way of deploying hubot. Could check for HUBOT_HEROKU_URL, which is something hubot already uses.\n. That'd be worth investigation. If heroku has documentation on what they add to the environment, it'd be good to link to in the code for whatever ends up being used.\n. @raysrashmi I left you some suggestions in-line. If you do go ahead with making a separate package, I might suggest namespacing it like hubot-instagram-tag\n. The fork is done, so can close this one out. Folks using hubot-scripts will still have issues though, so might be worth making a new PR to mark it as deprecated with pointer to new one, @raysrashmi \n. @didi156 just to confirm, you set HUBOT_WOLFRAM_APPID in the environment?\nThis script doesn't seem to have a lot of error checking unfortunately, so it might be having errors that aren't being shown.\nIncluding previous contributors to this: /cc @dhrrgn @kevintraver @ejfinneran\nI really could use someone to take over maintaing this script as external packages if anyone is interested /cc #1113\n.

The thing I would worry about this if you use a bot alias (to make respond match lines that start with / in addition to hubot), it takes up a lot of phrases 'namespaces', ie free, brb, etc.\nMaybe make it configured with an environment variable?

So, here's the thing. This used to be a hear, was changed to a respond, and now this wants to put it back to a hear. It's kind of a preference thing.\nWhich means it should probably be controlled by an environment variable :)\n. I'd also be interested to hear if anyone is interested in maintaining as a separate NPM module, as I don't use jira enough to test and continue to improve it. cc https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/issues/1113\n. Closing since there isn't really consensus, and this would be better as an external script.\n. If anyone out there is using hubot & jenkins, I'd love to see them take over maintaining this script as an external script cc #1113\n. If you do, please post back here :sparkling_heart: \n. I've been thinking recently how to test these various hubot scripts, and one idea was to have vagrant files for spinning up a test environment. That'd be particularly useful for self hosts or things like Jenkins.\n. Merged thanks!\n. We are actually moving away from adding scripts to repository in favor of separate npm packages per scripts.

This would mean you can't just hubot sudo, because it wouldn't match the space. It might be better to make the space and the rest of the things optional, like:\n/(sudo)( .*)?/i\nWhile in that area, it might be worth removing sudo as a capture group so you can just use msg.match[1].\n. If we're adding a dependency, it would also be a good opportunity to move it to an external package. We've found it's a lot easier to manage dependencies that way.\n@luijose any interesting in taking that on? Check out https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/issues/1113 for more infos\n. And so it has been forked.\nI was thinking of how to handle migrations like this, and I think just adding a simple deprecation with a pointer to the new package would be a good start.\n. Merged, thanks!\n. @balbeko there's been at least one release in the last month, so should be good to close :+1: \n. Some questions to try to help narrow down where this is happening. What versions are you using for the following (should be located in package.json):\n- hubot\n- hubot-scripts\n- hubot-hipchat\n/cc @pi3r @revhazroot because of previous contributions\n. Spotted this:\n2013-10-06T02:28:57.256264+00:00 app[web.1]: [Sun Oct 06 2013 02:28:57 GMT+0000 (UTC)] ERROR Unable to load /app/node_modules/hubot-scripts/src/scripts/zendesk: Error: Cannot find module '/app/node_modules/hubot-scripts/src/scripts/zendesk'\nThat looks like it is requiring the zendesk script, but it doesn't exist. That could be because it's outdated.\n@pi3r any interest in moving this to an external package? We've been doing that for new packages, as it helps with things like this. Instead of including things in hubot-scripts, you include them as real dependencies.\n. @darksheer can you please check package.json and report back the versions of hubot and hubot-scripts? There should be a section like:\n\"dependencies\": {\n    \"hubot\": \"2.5.4\",\n    \"hubot-scripts\": \"2.5.6\",\n. Could you try changing \"hubot-scripts\": \">= 2.4.2\", to `\"hubot-scripts\": \">= 2.5.6\"?\nI think npm is being lazy and not getting a later version.\n. @darksheer I don't think there's much to 'fix' that's hubot, unfortunately. It's more how npm works currently.\nThe next best thing is moving the script to it's own package, so when you say something in package.json (ie hubot-zendesk), you know that thing will be available. Also, potentially improving the error handling in hubot.\n. @darksheer I think your best bet is to use explicit versions in package.json, that way you know exactly what is installed at deploy time.\n. This would match any number of / in the output. You probably want something like:\n/(^|\\s)(@[\\w\\-]+(?:\\/[\\w\\-]+)?)/g)\nThis adds an non-capture group to match like /whatever on the end.\n. @one/two/thee isn't a valid org team mention as far as I knew.\nOn Friday, October 11, 2013, Tomas Varaneckas wrote:\n\n@technicalpickles https://github.com/technicalpickles your regexp has a\nflaw, when you have @one/two/thee it will grab @one/two as a mention,\nwhich is not right.\nI tried for a while but couldn't get a single expresion which would\ncorrectly find mentions in string like this:\n\"text @org/one/two @org/one @guy1 @guy2 text\".

Interesting approach moving that out to a shared module!

Hmm, what happens if a user upgrades to this version of the script, but doesn't have the update from  https://github.com/gomfunkel/node-mailchimp/pull/21 ?\nWe are generally moving scripts to their own packages, so they can have their own dependencies. That would help out here, as it'd be able to specify a specific node-mailchimp that works without having to encode.

So this is going to be a problem for existing users of this script, since the dependency is only defined in the README.

It uses a general JENKINS_URL, so if that is https://whatever it's over https and if it's http://whatever, it's over http, and should just work.\nAlso, what version of hubot-scripts are you using?\n.

I don't see anything gitolite specific in hubot-scripts yet.\nIf there was a way to adjust the gitolite install to have it do HTTP posts after pushes, then you could write a script to expose an endpoint for it to hit in hubot.

The URL would just be redis://HOSTNAME:PORT\n. @sableloki I'm still not sure I follow why including the port number in the REDIS_URL doesn't work. You can see info has the URI information, which includes info.port, so that means you should be able to specify a URL with the port and have it work.\n\na third party redis provider it conked out because of a custom port number\n\nCould you elaborate on 'conked out'? Were there any particular errors or log messages?\n. I mispoke earlier, the environment variables it recognizes are:\n-  REDISTOGO_URL\n- REDISCLOUD_URL\n- BOXEN_REDIS_URL\nCould you make sure one of those is set with the port in the url, ie redis://somehost:12670?\nIt's also worth noting that this would break redis-brain for people who expect that behavior to work, of being able to include the port in the URL.\n. If that's the case, seems like a bug in the implementation. I think I rather see that fixed than adding another environment variable.\nIn general, I find it preferable to have *_URL variables, rather than several *_HOST, *_PORT, *_USER, *_PASS variables. To start, it's less code, but it's also simpler to understand how to affect change in configuration.\n.

There's manual commands to run (ie npm publish), so I prefer not having the package.json updated in PRs.

How are you fetching this exactly?

If it was removed, it would be nice to be notified of that, rather than getting a 'not found' error upon launch.\nAgree. I think this means that basically we can't remove script files from hubot-scripts. We can, however, replace them with basically empty scripts that warn or error out with what to do to find them.\n. > It's being fetched during startup, and using the direct git link (as mentioned above).\nI'm still not following. I don't see how you are fetching scripts from a git source at bot startup time. Could you walk me through what you are doing exactly?\nAre you specifying hubot-scripts as a npm dependency, and pointing it at hubot-script's master branch?\n. I'm still not 100% with you how you are fetching hubot-scripts every time... did you update your package.json to set the hubot-scripts version to work from git? I'd recommend using a specific version instead if possible, and that shouldn't happen.\nThe point is taken though about scripts being removed.\n. Make sure to check the header of a script before trying to install it. In particular, there's a Dependency section. Those lines need to be added to your package.json. In this case:\n```\nDependencies:\n\"cheerio: \"0.7.0\"\n\n``\n. Could you double check a few things for me?\n- that package.json includes that snippet in the 'dependencies' part of it\n- runnpm installin your hubot root\n- confirm that node_modules/cheerio exists\n- confirm thatnpm ls cheerio` shows something\nIf you are still getting an error, can you paste your package.json, and the stack trace that happens?\n. Good catch! I still get bitten by this from time to time.\n. I seem to think we've used this successfully for setup with a template. Do you have an example of something that, with the old regex, worked vs didn't work?\ncc @bhuga \n. Did some regex matching, and confirmed. Thanks for fixing!\n. Closing in favor of https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/pull/1396\n. The problem with renaming (or deleting) files is that existing users would end up with a pretty unfriendly message.\nA better solution is keeping the old one, and replacing it with a script that just logs a warning to update the script.\n. Possibly, I recall there were some refactorings around TextMessage and Robot at some point in the past.\nWe're actually looking to move some of these scripts (particularly that interact with 3rd party services that are hard to develop and test against unless you have an account and are familiar) to external packages https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/issues/1113 . This script hasn't seen a lot of action, so do give a shout if you are interested in taking over and extracting it.\n. I'm on the fence on this. On one hand, it's good to make the tools behave like people expect them to work, but on the other hand I don't like adding a bunch of ways for doing the same thing.\nBut, if we do go this route, probably want contractions too like what's <something>.\n. Which adapter are you using? Most I've seen don't even generate messages more than one line.\nRegardless, I'm not sure about being able to set memories that have more than one line in them, since they'd be tricky to pull out.\n. Okay, I see what you mean now. This is adding support for the value of a memory having multiple lines, not the key. That should be fine :+1: \n.

I might suggest a description change like \"Have an office foam dart fight, except in chat instead of the office\"\n. Which adapters are affected by this? It might be worth noting that here, or... only add the space when it's needed.\n. How about... instead of having it in parens, use a colon and then the URL, ie: yosida95 pushed 1 commits to master in hubot-scripts: https://github.com/yosida95/hubot-scripts/compare/fc3113312...d2c8984e9\nThoughts?

I would checkout https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio as an alternative to jsdom and pulling jquery.\n. Removing the script will basically break existing hubot scripts that include it, with a pretty obtuse error.\nIt'd be better to have this use robot.logger.warning to indicate it doesn't work anymore at load time, and replace the respond with a message to that effect as well.\n. I agree with the sentiment, for sure. The problem is that the user wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a non-existent or mistyped script, and one that was intentionally removed. I'm happy to work on getting better error handling for the former, but it'd still be better to have some vestigal script to indicate what happened to it.\n.

Ideally, all the scripts here go away in favor of npm packages, so gonna close for now.\n. I'm thinking this would be better fixed by having a default path if one isn't given, like:\ncoffeescript\nprefix = info.path?.replace('/', '') or 'hubot'\nWithout this, you'd still get a weird error if you accidentally forget the path. Thoughts?\n. This is actually a duplicate of https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/pull/1430 , which applies the fix I suggested.\n. I released a fix with #1430 in 2.5.13.\n. Yep, duplicate.

You can try setting HUBOT_LOG_LEVEL=debug when running to get more debug output, and possibly update the script to do more calls to robot.logger.debug to include useful information.\n\nSince my teamcity server is using https, and a curl request using the same headers and url would not work without the -k or --insecure option (and works fine with -k), I'm wondering if there is an SSL certificate verification somewhere in msg.http.get ?\n\nThat seems likely to cause a problem, yeah. It looks like the underlying https node library has an option like rejectUnauthorized, that you can set to false, for not caring about the certificate. There's some indirection msg.http which uses https://github.com/technoweenie/node-scoped-http-client under the hood, so not sure off hand how to pass that in.\nSome information that would be helpful for debugging:\n- output of npm ls to show hubot and hubot-scripts versions\n- version of node from node --version\n- which commands you were trying to use from teamcity.coffee.\n.

If you've installed the http://github.com/github/hubot as a checkout, that is not going to work.\nSee https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/README.md#getting-started-with-hubot for how to create your own hubot (basically, install the package, then use hubot --create to make your new bot.\n. > I installed hubot following the first 4 steps of these instructions http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=35254 \n\nNow I'm at the point where i need to install the scripts i want.\n\nI hate to break it to you, but that documentation is incorrect. You should never clone https://github.com/github/hubot unless you are developing hubot, the package. \nSee https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/README.md#getting-started-with-hubot instead.\nThe step you do see in that forum like ./hubot -c /opt/xmpp-bot creates a hubot for you in /opt/xmpp-bot. That should be generating a hubot in that directory, including a hubot-scripts.json.\nTo be clear, your bot should be running in /opt/xmpp-bot, not /opt/hubot. That is what the linked forum says to do as well.\nJust to make sure I'm answering the question of where hubot-scripts.json and if you should create it: it should live in your created hubot's directory, ie/ opt/xmpp-bot. You can just create it and make it a JSON array with the scripts you want, if it doesn't exist for some reason.\n. For what it's worth, this repository is for issues about scripts included in the hubot-scripts package, not general questions. github/hubot is probably a better place, as we can add documentation if it makes sense.\n\nwas wondering if hubot being coffeescript and phantomjs in javascript if its possible to integrate the two.\n\ncoffeescript ultimately compiles down to javascript, so you can generally use anything javascript from coffeescript. I'm pretty sure you can go the other way aroudn too, as long as coffeescript is loaded at some point (ie to support .coffee files).\n\nIs it possible to get hubot to call phantomjs commands?\n\nI haven't tried, but it should be possible. My understanding of phantomjs might make it a little more complicated, because it seems like it's wrapping a node interpreter. If it was myself writing the script, I would consider making a small express app that calls out to phantomjs instead, and make http calls from hubot to it instead.\n.

So here's the problem we find ourselves mired in: we can remove this script, but not users that were using it get an error at startup about file not found, without a pointer to how to fix it.  That is why there's an issue open in https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/issues/1641 for marking things deprecated and pointing users to the path forward.\n. I'm handling this over in https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/pull/1696\n. We have been slowly deprecating this repository over in https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/issues/1641 . This particular script was extracted to https://github.com/balbeko/hubot-jenkins. Would you be able to try that and see if it helps? If not, you can file issues over on that repository.\n. It'd be good in general, but it is a lot of work, and this repository is deprecated. Considering we are trying to move scripts out of it (https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/issues/1641), I think the time would be better spent updating scripts in whatever repository they end up extracted to.\n. This repository has been deprecated for awhile in favor of npm packages, and it looks like this one was extracted to https://github.com/rustedgrail/hubot-jira. We are in the process of finding scripts that have been extracted, and deprecating them over in https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/issues/1641, so I'd give that a try to see if it works any better.\n. One thing I brought up in https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-pager-me/pull/54 that is cause for concern when adding IDs:\n\nhow does this affect users that aren't up on hubot 2.13.0 yet?\nMaybe could do something like check robot.respond.length, and fail it isn't 3? (It used to be 2 before options).\n. > when you say fail if it isn't 3, do you mean these scripts should fail gracefully putting out an unsupported hubot version error message, instead of whatever error would be spit out right now\n\nI mean hubot should fail outright if trying to load this with an older version. Without that and the function signature changing, I think the user would get a pretty confusing error like \"Object is not a function\", since now it's getting an object hash instead of a function.\nI haven't thought of a graceful way to support both that doesn't involve a lot of extra code. I don't think there's a graceful way to support both, so it would require 2.13.0. In general, I prefer hubot failing during boot this rather than \"gracefully\" not loading the scripts, because a hubot user would expect those scripts to be present, and they won't be if they are skipped.\n. This repository is deprecated, so we won't be updating all these packages with ids.\n. This repository has been deprecated for awhile in favor of npm packages.

Was talking to @bkeepers about this earlier, and he was starting work on a script to search GitHub for possible replacements. That got me to thinking that we could just prompt users to search Google, GitHub, and NPM for packages if there isn't a replacement, and to post back on https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/issues/1641.\nIf we are doing that, then it's probably not worth updating every script to have the deprecate logic. Given that, this is probably easier to have in github/hubot. The downside is the data about replacements is in that repo, and requires hubot releases to update. That might not be so bad though.\n. A few months ago in https://github.com/github/hubot/pull/970 I added support for checking repalcements.json that I started before this branch. I expanded on that to check for the replacements.json, and if it's not present, prompt to install a newer version of hubot-scripts that includes it. If it is present, and there's scripts that don't have replacements, there's a recommendation to update for a more recent version that maybe has more replacements.\nThat makes this PR just the replacements.json, and to remove manual deprecation some scripts had. There is whitespace relatated diffs too, but those can be ignored.\n. Thanks! cc https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/issues/1641\n. We are in the process of deprecating this repository. We're not accepting any changes or fixing any issues unless it furthers that end. If anyone is interested in taking the isup script and repackaging it with fixes, I'd strongly encourage it.\nThere is a https://www.npmjs.com/package/hubot-isup but the repository is gone, and it doesn't seem to use isitup.org\n. Thanks, I added that to the list of scripts with replacements in https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/issues/1641\n. We are actually moving away from adding scripts to repository in favor of separate npm packages per scripts. See #1113 for details, and let us know if you have any questions about getting going with that!\n. Closing for https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-redis-brain/issues/21\n. Thanks!\n. It's also a little fuzzy if we should be removing licensing stuff that people add to their scripts. Or, we have to assume they are being made under hubot-script's license, and remove it from all the scripts that have it.\n. Not strictly speaking. You can have scripts that are just doing routing stuff, for example. In this case, 'command' isn't really accurate. It's more the things it will hear and respond to, ie URLs with png, jpg, gif.\n. Sounds good to me. There isn't a guideline, but there should be. The README is going to be the best place for that, I think.\n. For scripts that are a single trigger, with the help command being enough to explain it, I almost think Description isn't really necessary. It's just copy-pasta, that doesn't add anything compared to the usage.\n. Commands that use robot.respond should be prefixed with hubot, ie:\nhubot klout <twitter name without @>\nYou'll also want some description of the command after this. That way, help will show something useful if someone says hubot help klout, ie:\nhubot klout <twitter name without @> - report klout score for twitter handle, and compare to competitors\n. You'll want to load this from the environment, rather than having this hardcoded. Check out, for example, how this script loads it from the environment and then checks that it is set\n. This list is hardcoded :( You'll want a way dynamically add/remove people from this, storing that knowledge in the robot brain.\n. Can you please include details about how to get this key? ie sign up for an account over at https://something.com\n. If these variables aren't filled out, then the turntable bits would silently not get setup, which would make it tricky to debug if you are setting this up initially.\nCould you add an else clause that indicates if any of these are missing?\n. Looks like this is missing a description. Could you add one please?\n. These commands need to be prefixed with hubot. If you just type torrents or where is transmission?, the respond block wouldn't work for those.\n. There should be some error checking to make sure these are set before making http calls. Otherwise, they will fail in spectacular ways when you hit the http call :)\n. I've used Transmission before, but had no idea there was an HTTP interface. Could you include a Notes section with how to find the info to put in here?\n. Maybe could have this be /q(?:uestion)? card/i to so you can use same semantics as card me?\n. This and /card 2/ can probably be combined to allow 1 or more cards. Like:\nrobot.hear /card(?: me)?(?: (\\d+))?/i\n  count = if msg.match[1]\n                   parseInt(msg.match[1])\n                 else\n                   1\n  for i in [0..count] by 1\n    msg.send msg.random answers\nMay need some testing, but you get the idea.\n. This should have None as the Commands.\n. I'd consider using mail instead of mutt. More systems are likely to have this installed by default.\n. Notes like this should be up in the top documentation section, under 'Notes'\n. Can you use mail instead of mutt? More likely to be installed. Also, you could include notes like apt-get install mutt on debian-like systems, etc.\n. Who would this email end up being 'from'? Is it the unix user @ the hostname of the server it is running? Should that be configurable?\n. Could you rename this to 'Notes' please?\n. If I'm reading this correctly, it'd assume the person you are telling now is on the same domain as the user asking the thing to be told. Is that a good assumption to make in general?\n. This looks like an empty catch block. What type of error are you expecting?\n. Please consider using cheerio instead of htmlparser and soupselect. It's a lot more clear and concise. \n. Another empty catch block :(\n. Consider msg.sending this instead of using console.error. If folks get used to seeing YouTube metadata, they should see any errors that come up too, otherwise it's confusing why the metadata isn't being shown.\n. Maybe include the thx pattern here too?\n. What about thanks in addition to thx? Also, some of the emoji can be construed as thanking, like :+1: and :metal:\n. Check out robot. usersForFuzzyName. This would help normalize the receiver, like it'd work for someone thanking Josh or Josh Nichols.\n. If you wanted to be more coffeescript-ish, you could use a list comprehension here.\n. How about \"Hey! You need to set HUBOT_GITHUB_REPO and HUBOT_GITHUB_TOKEN before I can link to that commit.\" Otherwise, as a user it's unclear what that is for.\n. Configuration sections are actually used for environment variables. Notes would be better for this.\n. All these documentation sections needs to be indented 2 spaces for parsing.\nAlso, please add hubot to the beginning of the Commands. Less confusion for people using hubot help :) Don't worry, hubot gets replaced with the actual name at runtime.\n. the brackets usually denoate a pattern. Like search  - search something for . Just say standup for the command.\n. Maybe add a link for convenience? ie https://plus.google.com/events\n. How do you feel about making this a respond instead of hear? Seems to me there'd be too many false positives when doing a hear.\n. You'll want to check this is actually set, because sending an empty variable will cause an error. Bonus points points to display an informative message for how to set it!\n. You could also use the /i flag for case-insensitive matching instead of [Bb] and [Cc] :)\n. Hubot will expect there to be one line per configuration. Notes is a good section to put longer form notes though.\n. I think I'd rather see this managed through like HUBOT_HARVEST_EMAIL and HUBOT_HARVEST_PASSWORD. It's not great to be using chat to set the authentication bits.\n. One hubot convention is actually foo me. So, if you wanted to go with that, it'd be more like:\nrobot.respond /(commandlinefu)( me)? *(.*)?/i, (msg) ->\nYou would also not want to capture commandline all these groups. The commandlinefu part actually doesn't need any parens around it. For the me, you can add ?: inside the parens to do that:\nrobot.respond /commandlinefu(?: me)? *(.*)?/i, (msg) ->\nThat would mean it'd be msg.match[1] below.\n. So, you can use coffeescript's truthyness here. Also string interpolation. Also also if/else being expressions. Basically, lay on some coffescriptisms :)\nquery = if msg.match[1]\n                 \"matching/#{c}/#{new Buffer(c).toString('base64')}/json\"\n               else\n                 \"random/json\"\n. uri is only used once, so probably can change this to:\ncommand msg, \"http://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/#{query}\", (cmd) ->\n. I'd try using msg.http without the header call if possible. If the API is for real json, it shouldn't be too bothered. If it is, leaving a note about why the user agent is set would be good. (I realize this might be copy-pasta from part of another script)\n. Please include underscore in the Dependencies section above with a version. This should be in the same format as a package.json, so it's easy to copy & paste into your own.\n. This needs to be in Dependencies too.\n. I have a feeling that robot.brain.data.users is every user the bot has encountered, not just the ones in the current room. Have you observed that at all?\n. Yeah, he can be in any number of rooms, as defined by the HUBOT_CAMPFIRE_ROOMS environment variable.\nI did some quick checking if there was an easy hubot way to see who is in a room, but it doesn't look like it. The next best thing would be to use the campfire api to see the users in the room. Some starting points:\n- https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/src/adapters/campfire.coffee#L94-L99\n- https://github.com/37signals/campfire-api/blob/master/sections/rooms.md#get-room\nA problem there is that kind of couples it to the Campfire adapter. Maybe there needs to be a robot.usersForRoom(roomId)?\n. msg.send is asynchronous, so even if you call it twice in a row, the order isn't guaranteed. I'm sure it will annoy someone eventually. You can pass multiple strings to msg.send to ensure the right order though.\n. If there's an error, there probably isn't going to be data to spit out. Consider either returning in the if clause, or using an else clause.\n. Could you update this to include the names of the environment variables? Would help along someone new using the script. Also, maybe split this out into three checks so you can be more accurate about what is missing?\n. For the command help, I think it'd be worth while listing out the particular options. For example:\nhubot nick pirate  - Provide the user with a pirate nickname\nThis would also allow someone to say hubot help pirate, and get this back.\n. Probably don't need these trailing newlines.\n. Check out cheerio for screen scraping things. I've been recommending folks use that instead of soupselect or other things.\n. Should this be locked to something specific instead of latest to avoid API breakages?\n. Instead of keeping this in a variable, you could store it on robot.brain. This would persist across hubot restarts, assuming you are using the redis-brain.coffee.\n. Please add jsdom to the dependency section in the documentation above.\nAlso, not many things use jsdom, so I'd recommend perhaps using xml2js or cheerio for scraping the results out instead.\n. Doesn't look like you use lockpix in the match, so no need to capture it with parens. For the me capture, you can use do (?: me) so it matches, but doesn't capture it to matches. Between those two, you can use msg.match[1] below.\n. NPM can work with git repos, but it would probably be better to use a version as @tombell says.\n. No problem :) You can find it in the package.json in a repo usually, ie: https://github.com/peterolson/BigInteger.js/blob/master/package.json#L3\nIt's 1.1.5 in this case.\n. This text variable isn't used anywhere, so can be removed too.\n. The way command usage with help works is that each line is considered an item, and they are sorted. Maybe change to like:\n``` coffeescript\n#nnn - link to GitHub issue nnn for HUBOT_GITHUB_REPO project\nuser/repo#nnn - link to GitHub issue nnn for user/repo project\n``\n. Doesresultinclude the units? May be useful displaying if it's known.\n. Was worth a shot at least.\n. If I'm reading the regex correctly, this command isn't implemented below. If that's the case, it should be removed.\n. I see why I missed it now. Normally, you'd add a capture group to the respond's regex, then pull it out ofmsg.match`. Also, it looks like that regex is expecting names to be prefixed with @, which isn't clear from the help command, not to mention not all adapters use that convention.\n. You could change this to a guard clause, ie:\ncoffeescript\nreturn if msg.message.user.name.match(new RegExp(jiraIgnoreUsers, \"gi\"))\nA benefit of that is it dramatically reduces the size of the diff.\n. This would do a msg.http even if the HUBOT_WWWO_API_URL isn't set. Adding a return should fix that like in the HUBOT_WWO_API_KEY section.\nAlternatively, it might be worth defaulting it to the free feed if not specified.\n. Is there a URL you can go to to figure out what the URL would be? Might be worth mentioning that in the response.\nAlso: grammatically, there doesn't need to be a comma after please.\n. Could you add a Dependencies section? Like:\n``` coffeescript\nDependencies:\n\"ntwitter\": \"something\"\n```\nWhere something is the version you know works with it.\n. Typo on this line, should be HUBOT_TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET.\n. Yep. I'm working on twitter things now and will make sure of that. Also,\nprobably standardize on ntwitter, and eventually make a hubot abstraction\nof accessing twitter things.\nOn Tue, Jun 18, 2013 at 11:23 AM, Tom Bell notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nIn src/scripts/tweet-content.coffee:\n\n@@ -5,18 +5,41 @@\n #   None\n #\n # Configuration:\n-#   None\n+#   HUBOT_TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY\n+#   HUBOT_TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET\n+#   HUBOT_TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY\n+#   HUBOT_TWITTER_ACCES_TOKEN_SECRET\n\nWe should probably make sure that scripts using similar environment\nvariables use the same names\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/pull/988/files#r4750801\n.\n. hubot for now because it's simpler. would need more complicated things for\nper script twitter auth\n\nOn Tue, Jun 18, 2013 at 11:26 AM, Tom Bell notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nIn src/scripts/tweet-content.coffee:\n\n@@ -5,18 +5,41 @@\n #   None\n #\n # Configuration:\n-#   None\n+#   HUBOT_TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY\n+#   HUBOT_TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET\n+#   HUBOT_TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY\n+#   HUBOT_TWITTER_ACCES_TOKEN_SECRET\n\nActually, would hubot be the app authorising with Twitter, or the\nindividual scripts?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/pull/988/files#r4750884\n.\n. You can actually use robot.http here, which does some of the smarts of http vs https. It'd look like:\n\ncoffeescript\n   robot.http(\"#{jiraUrl}/rest/api/2/project\")\n     .auth(auth)\n     .get(err, res, body)\nIt might actually be worth just exposing HUBOT_JIRA_URL prefix as an environment, and letting folks specify the whole thing rather than exposing each individual component of the URL.\n. Why !zen, out of curiosity?  It might be also worth adding a description like display a zen message from https://api.github.com/zen API so it gives you more info when /help zen.\n. It doesn't look like the (countdown) group is used at all, so can probably have the parentheses moved.\nThe (for )? doesn't look like it's used either, except as a more natural way to get the countdown. You can add ?: to make it a non capture group like (?:for )?. You can then update the countDownKey to be msg.match[1] below.\n. another strategy is to use robot.brain.on('loaded') to initialize the countdown variable. See ambush.coffee as an example.\n. You should also check pagerRoom here before creating the endpoint. Not specifying the room would be the easiest way to use this script without the endpoint.\n. Could you add a Notes section with how to setup up the webhook/listener?\n. May be worth including an example of what the payload looks like. scoutapp.coffee does this, for example.\n. And also a URLs section, kind of like help.coffee\n. Instead of passing along user, perhaps pass along the entire msg? That way, you can msg.reply to it. Some adapters work slightly different, where you'd need to be like @user to get a proper reply, so it's usually better to use that when possible.\n. Do you have any concrete examples? I think demonstrating the power of this would go a ways to getting folks to use it. Also, if there's any existing hubot-scripts that could use it, would be useful to add those as well. \n. > Maybe I'm wrong, but I think that a robot can do a replay...\nYeah, you should be able to just change it to robot.reply data.user, and that should take care of it without passing the msg. You'd have to test though. That doesn't include any information about the room, so I think it'd be kind of random where the reply goes.\nIf you passed the msg object, using msg.reply knows excactly who and where it was said, so the reply should be the right thing.\n. What is this change about? Looks unrelated to the other schema/user related things.\n. Actually, I see where ask_req is set below, so probably disregard. Diff just seemed weird.\n. All good. That's what I get for only reading diffs. Totally missed the indentation (ricky coffeescript).\n. It's worth noting that node has a URL class that can help here, rather than having to implement a regex: http://nodejs.org/api/url.html\n. One thing to remember about msg.send is that it's asynchronous, so it's possible the pulls would come out of order with the summary. You can usually avoid that by a single call to msg.send with an array of strings to send.\nIt's also worth noting that sending a loop of filtered results could spam the room if there are a lot of them. Maybe generate a single multi-line string?\n. I'm not sure it's necessary to notify that you're getting the pulls, unless you really want to show the org that is pulled from.\n. Keep in mind that msg.send is async, so these are likely to come out in the wrong order. You can calling msg.send with multiple strings on it.\n. No, msg.send \"foo\", \"bar\", \"baz\" would send three one line messages. If you made one big string with multiple lines, it would go through as a paste.\n. What happens if config.client_key isn't set in the environment? does Instagram complain? If it does, should consider moving this to the authenticate_user method. Besides that, the name of the method makes it sound like that will happen.\n. This would come back as a string, so you'll need to parseInt it\n. Does this API have an option for limiting results? It may be easier to do that, and show all images, rather than doing a while loop below.\n. Idiomatic coffeescript would be camel case, ie authenticateUser.\n. Is it obvious where to get these? Might include any notes or URLs for easily finding these.\n. I would move this into the robot.respond block, and make it do msg.send. For users of the system, the command would just fail, and it'd take some digging into the logs to find the output for this little console.log.\nIt might make sense to add a helper to twitterConfig that takes a msg object so it can output what goes wrong. Like:\ncoffeescript\nauth = twitterConfig.defaultCredentials()\nunless auth.checkEnvironment(msg)\n   return\nThen have checkEnvironment do the msg.send for errors, and return false if something isn't set.\n. Wouldn't this be .coffee?\n. I tend to go all in in the word operators, ie if err or not body.\n. Also, you can check res.statusCode, ie if res.statusCode isnt 200\n. Including the error in the mesage is useful for debugging.\n. It's probably not worth capturing (clipart), since you don't use it. Nor is the optional me used. That means you could refactor to:\n/clipart(?: me)? (.*)/\nAnd then you'd be able to use msg.match[1] below.\n. Might want to check that res.statusCode is 200, and that there isn't an err before trying to parse.\n. You can call robot.http, if it's simpler. You wouldn't need to pass a msg, since you don't use it in this method anyways. That would mean this would need to be defined under the modules.export = (robot) -> block.\n. You don't actually need both sets of parenthesis. These capture groups aren't used though, so it doesn't really affect the indexes of msg.match\n. Might want to remove this commented out code if it's not being used.\n. process.env.STAGEHAND_ENVIRONMENTS.split(',') fail because process.env.STAGEHAND_ENVIRONMENTS is undefined if you haven't set .\nYou could try using the 'existential' operator: process.env.STAGEHAND_ENVIRONMENTS?.split(',')\n. Check out http://coffeescript.org/ , particularly \"The Existential Operator\" (no anchor to link to sadly :():\n\nIt's a little difficult to check for the existence of a variable in JavaScript. if (variable) ... comes close, but fails for zero, the empty string, and false. CoffeeScript's existential operator ? returns true unless a variable is null or undefined, which makes it analogous to Ruby's nil?\nIt can also be used for safer conditional assignment than ||= provides, for cases where you may be handling numbers or strings.\nThe accessor variant of the existential operator ?. can be used to soak up null references in a chain of properties. Use it instead of the dot accessor . in cases where the base value may be null or undefined. If all of the properties exist then you'll get the expected result, if the chain is broken, undefined is returned instead of the TypeError that would be raised otherwise.\n\nSo, process.env.STAGEHAND_ENVIRONMENTS? would return true/false, but ?. is a different operator that would not access the property unless it's non null/undefined.\n. Ah, missed that. It's probably fine then. Or alternatively, you could return all the art from this callback, and let the thing consuming it call msg.random.\n. I'd include a link if possible.\n. This check & msg.send are duplicated in each of the commands. I'd suggest moving it to a helper like validEnvironment like:\n``` coffeescript\nvalidEnvironment = (msg) ->\nif process.env.HUBOT_AIRTIME_URL\n     true\n   else\n      msg.send \"Please set the HUBOT_AIRTIME_URL environment variable.\"\n      false\n```\nThat would simplify the other commands to like: return unless validEnvironment(msg).\n. I would also include more details about how you figure out what value to put into this variable. Do you sign up for something? Have to setup software somewhere? \n. I'd suggest checking out cheerio for screen scraping. I've found it a lot easier to use in practice. Here's an example: https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/iced-coffee-weather.coffee#L43-L45\n. I generally recommend cheerio over soupselect/htmlparser, as the code is a lot more readable.\n. msg.http is deprecated. You can use robot.http instead, which would mean you don't need to pass in msg here.\n. I'd suggest removing these console.log, or else use robot.logger.debug for them. Otherwise, you can generate unuseful output in the logs.\n. Oh, and using robot.http would require this function to be in the module.exports = (robot) -> call.\n. Yeah, that's also work\nOn Saturday, November 2, 2013, Emmanuel Pinault wrote:\n\nIn src/scripts/devops.coffee:\n\n+\n+module.exports = (robot) ->\n-  robot.respond /devops me/i, (msg) ->\n-    randevopsMe msg, (url, title) ->\n-      msg.send title\n-      msg.send url\n  +\n  +randevopsMe = (msg, cb) ->\n-  msg.http(\"http://devopsreactions.tumblr.com/random\")\n-    .get() (err, res, body) ->\n-      console.log res.headers.location\n-      devopsMe msg, res.headers.location, (location, title) ->\n-        cb location , title\n  +\n  +devopsMe = (msg, location, cb) ->\n-  msg.http(location)\n\ncan't I pass the robot to my function?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/pull/1208/files#r7386817\n.\n\n\nJosh\n. I'd suggest including sensu somewhere in this command for consistency, and also that silence might be overloaded.\n. If you rename silence to be like silence sensu, you could remove |silence) here\n. You should definitely check the presence of this environment variable before using it, and msg.reply if it's not set with how to set it.\n. If you want to go for idiomatic coffeescript, use is instead of ==. Under the hood, it uses === which generally is more consistent and expected behavior.\n. I'd use string interpolation for all these lines, ie:\n\"Sensu version: #{result['sensu']['version']}\"\nYou could also consider using a heredoc, ie multiline string with \"\"\"\n. It can be useful for deubbing to include the status code gotten back, and possibly the body. It's also possible for err to exist, so you'd want to check that as well.\n. I would just assign these to named local variables, rather than having a comment and using msg.match later on.\n. I'd put this either in the same string with one msg.reply, or multiple string arguments to msg.reply. Otherwise, the order can come out random.\n. I think this needs to be msg.match[3], or the outer ( -(\\d+\\w+)) needs to be made non-capturing with ?:.\n. How is msg.match[1] getting spaces in it? It should be capturing \\w+, which wouldm't match spaces.\n. You can avoid an underscore dependency, by using msg.random instead.\n. This only gets evaluated once, which means this would only work if hubot was started on November 10th. I'd move this check down into the robot.hear  section.\n. I would consider changing this to a respond, otherwise it'll respond to anything matching bofh me, rather than just things directed at hubot. This would mean changing the command in the docs to be hubot bofh me.\n. I think we can remove the _ from this one. In this particular script, we wouldn't support multiple accounts.\n. Shouldn't this line be indented?\n. This should actually be hubot beer me too, since it's a respond not a hear.\n. Does this actually work? I'm not seeing where roll is defined.\n. I'd put this TODO in a Notes: section instead. Some places will scrape this info (script catalog), so you probably don't want it showing up  there.\n. Two things I'd suggest:\n- use string interpolation, ie `\"http://open.spotify.com/#{spotifyLink.split(':')[1..2].join('/')}\"\n- refactor the splitting and joining to local variables to explain what's being transfererd\nAnd a bonus third one, include a comment with an example URL :grin:\n. It's important to check if err is present, and reply with an error code. For example:\ncoffeescript\nif err?\n   msg.reply \"Ran into an error trying to spotify: #{err}\"\n   return\n. You should also check res.statusCode before parsing the body as well. Check the API for what they typically return. If it's just 200, for example:\ncoffeescript\nif res.statusCode isnt 200\n  msg.reply \"Got back HTTP #{res.statusCode} trying to spotify: #{body}\"\n  return\n. conditional statements have a return value, so you can do something like:\nresponse = if num_results > 0\n  getHTTPLinkFromSpotifyURL(results?.tracks?[0].href)\nelse\n  \"I couldn't find any songs :(\"\nmsg.send response\n. If you want to go for full on coffeescriptisms, we tend to use camelCase, ie numResults. I'm also not sure if this is null/undefined, if it'd be > 0 below. Could say like results?.info?.num_results or 0 to be sure.\n. Ahh, I see it now. I didn't expand enough of the diff to see the roll function below. You could actually rollOne instead.\n. It'd be msg.reply report rollOne(6). Your snippet was trying to do string interpolation without being inside a string. And inside that string interpolation, it was using the bracket operator ([]) without a thing to operate on.\n. Having the return here makes it a bit of a Guard Clause so you don't actually have to do elsif/else. You just check the bad condition and return if it's met, and so at the end, you are at the 'happy path' so you don't need an else.\n. From the stack:\nTypeError: Object 3 has no method 'reduce'\n  at report (/Users/jasghar/myhubot/node_modules/hubot-scripts/src/scripts/dice.coffee:42:9, <js>:29:27)\nThat line is:\n``` coffeescript\ntotal = results.reduce (x, y) -> x + y\n```\nIt looks like rollOne just returns an integer, but roll returns an array. So, either leave it as it was originally, or wrap in an array like msg.reply report [rollOne(6)]. Looking back at the earlier post you were super close, just had the string interpolation around it.\n. It'd be worth explaining what exactly Hall is, and link to hall.com.\n. These two split calls would fail if HUBOT_HALL_ROOMS isn't defined. May want to tack on a or '' before splitting. Or consider moving this to being built as it's needed by responds below. That way, you can give an error message that things are missing.\n. It's usually better to do this once, rather than in each respond callback. Check out this example of initializing it when the brain is loaded: https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/ambush.coffee#L22-L23\n. You don't need to escape the space with a slash\n. I'd recommend the existential operator here, which is better for truthy things:\ncoffeescript\nif key?\n. Might want to do something like:\ncoffeescript\nsound = sounds[key]\nif sound?\n  speakIt msg, key, sound if sound\nelse\n  msg.send \"no sounds named #{key}\"\n. You should look into adding a callback to this to check for errors, non-success codes, etc. Otherwise, people will complain when they try to play a sound and it silently fails. For example:\ncoffeescript\n.post(data) (err, res, body) ->\n  if err?\n    msg.send \"Got an error trying to play sound: #{err}\", err.stack\n    return\n  if res.statusCode isnt 201 # check the API to see what the API returns, most use 201 created\n    msg.send \"Got a bad status code trying to play sound: HTTP #{res.statusCode}\", body\n    return\n  # consider feedback here that it was sent through successfully\n. This would come up if the current room isn't set, so you could be more explicit about what configuration to change.\n. A problem with using this default is that it'd only work for the IRC adapter. I don't think there's a good abstract way of asking an adapter what rooms it's in, or the environment variable that has that list. Might be a good addition though.\n. You could make the optional space & record type non-capturing like:\nrobot.respond /dns ([^ ]+)(?: (.*))?/i, (msg) ->\nThis would let you use msg.match[2] below.\n. It's a super minor thing, but for coffeescriptisms we tend to use or instead of ||.\n. You're not using (douban) anywhere, so you can remove it as a capture group (i.e. remove the parentheses). That would mean you'd be able to use msg.match[1] and msg.match[2] instead.\n. It also might be worth making the (book|movie|music) be a wider pattern. You can they validate it's book or movie or music, and warn if the user says something else. If you don't do this, then that kind of typo would silently not match the respond regex leading to a confused user.\n. ... and, it looks like you are trying to make that category optional. The problem with this regex is that to not specify a category, youd'd have to have two spaces and then a query. You probably want something like:\n/(douban) (?:(book|movie|music) )? (.*)/\nThis makes adds a space to preceeding book|movie|music, while not changing the capture group at all.\n. I recommend always checking if err is present, and warning the user if so:\ncoffeescript\nif err\n  msg.reply \"Hit a problem using the Douban API: #{err}\"\n  return\n. I would also check the res.statusCode. Being a GET, I'd guess expected status code is 200, but you should check the API docs:\nif res.statusCode isnt 200\n   msg.send \"Hit a problem using the Douban API: HTTP #{res.statusCode}\"\n   return\n. In the respond regex, category was optional. Will this confuse the API?\n. You should remove this commented out code if itn's not being used.\n. You might want to be checking err too:\nif err?\n  msg.reply \"Nope, that didn't work: #{err}\"\n  return\n. What if they typo the stopName? You should check:\nif urlName?\n   msg.reply \"I don't know that stop\"\n   return\n. One trick for readability I like is that conditionals have a return value, so you can do:\ncoffeescript\ntimeData = if direction == \"inbound\"\n                   times[0]['div']\n                 else if direction == \"outbound\"\n                   times[1]['div']\n. This seems like it'd get out of date really easily :( Are there any APIs around you could use instead of stashing all the data inline?\n. I see process.env.HUBOT_CALTRAIN_HOME_STATION gets passed in as the source, but no error checking. What happens when it's undefined? Some of the methods look to be calling methods, which would fail with undefined methods.\n. Based on friend's recent to Facebook, I'd offer vasectomy to this list as well.\n. hear matches against the whole line, so you don't really need the .* on either side. You also don't use the captured (startup) anywhere, so remove the parentheses, leaving:\ncoffeescript\nrobot.hear /startup/i, (msg) ->\n. Coffeescript has string interpolation, so you can do:\ncoffeescript\nmsg.send \"#{msg.random X} for #{msg.random Y}\"\n. Also, since this is a hear, it'd match any string with 'startup' on it, which might get annoying in normal conversation. I'd consider switching to respond so you have to specifically trigger this thing.\n. I think (left|on hand) was meant to be a non-capture group because of the trailing :?. That actually means an optional :. It should be:\ncoffeescript\n robot.respond /cash (?:left|on hand) (.+)$/i, (msg) ->\nYou'd also need to change things to msg.match[1] below.\n. Here's another idea...\ncoffeeescript\nclark = require('clark')\nclark = clark.clark if clark.clark? # backwards compatability with older clark versions\nThat should be handle both cases, and I'd be able to merge.\n. Might want to include the body in this too, to help. If you give it as a second arg to msg.send, it'll come out immediately after (as opposed to a second msg.send, which the order could be different because async).\n. You'll want to check err as well res.statusCode.\ncoffeescript\nif err?\n  msg.send \"Hmm, I got an error trying to process that CircleCI response: #{err}\", err.stack\n  return\n. For coffeescript things, you usually want to use the existential operator ?. I tend to use unless instead of if ! too:\ncoffeescript\nunless msg.match[2]?\n. You should be able to check process.env.HUBOT_CIRCLECI_TOKEN? to see if it's not set, versus set to something incorrect.\n. Instead of calling response_handler twice, it might make more sense to update the handler to take another argument, ie (url, title). That way, in the send_meme call above, you can msg.send url, title, which ensures that they get sent in a consistent order. Otherwise, you'll randomly get the title or the url first, which can get pretty annoying to users.\n. You could also do if user_name in searchTerm.\nHilariously, I didn't even know ~ was a thing.\n. You'll want to check that these are set at some point, and reply back with an message on how to fix it.\n. Need to add this to the Dependencies too.\n. For help commands, I usually use a convention like:  where is <user>?. It's similar to the formatting used in man pages, bu t I have yet to find a name what that actually is.\n. What if username doesn't match between chat and foursquare?\n. One trick we use in pagerduty.coffee is a command like hubot foursquare me as <something>, and store that value in the brain. That way, you can associate back a foursquare thing back to the chat thing.\n. on-command, because on-load is hidden in logs, but on-command is more visible to end-users.\n. How does this localhost get used? Anything that should be configured per install of this script?\n. The nice thing about moving to npm packages is you can specify real dependencies instead of relying on people to read documentation :grin: \n. You'd want to apply it to anything that hits the API and needs those. Otherwise, you'll have silent failures. Using pagerduty.coffee as example again:\n- helper function for verifying https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/pagerduty.coffee#L208-L219\n- call it where it's needed https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/pagerduty.coffee#L238-L239\n. Two things:\n- usually the convention for these variables is HUBOT_WHATEVER\n- you should make sure these are set if they are required. Otherwise, the URLs generated by SupportFu are going to be invalid (ie missing a host)\nIn general, I recommend doing at-command time errors back to the user, rather than only checking at load time.\n. The parentheses make a capture group that you can use from msg.match. Since you aren't using it, you can just remove the parentheses.\n. You should check if there was any err while requesting, as well if res.statusCode returning something healthy (typically 200, but depends on the API).\n. This won't work the way you think you will because of async and scopping.. You'll want to update the getDeals's callback to return responseText, and image.\nIt's also possible for it to still be undefined, so worth checking for that too.\n. Since it's not just a responseText coming back, worth changing this variable name.\n. msg.send is async, so this can come out of order. Use msg.send with multiple args to ensure a specific order.\n. I like to use man page-like syntax here, ie: hubot <query> bomb <N> - get N images.\n. msg.send is asynchrnous, so calling it multiple times will come in randomish of order. You are already shuffling the  list to be random, so you could use one call to msg.send with the splat operator, ie:\ncoffeescript\nmsg.send urls...\n. These were actually correct. It's a robot.hear, not robot.respond.\n. This was trying to make the advocate optional. This regex might work better:\n/beer( a|advocate)?( me)?/i,\n. Oh fun, this collides with beer.coffee below as is.\n. The point is actually that whenever you paste a  a cl.ly link, not just at hubot, it gets pasted as an image, so no hubot required in the beginning.\n. This is also robot.hear, so the hubot isn't required.\n. Also robot.hear, so hubot isn't required.\n. robot.hear so hubot isn't required.\n. robot.hear, etc, etc\n. such :ear:, not very hubot, wow :dog2: \n. Also robot.hear\n. Also robot.hear\n. You could probably do something like:\ncoffeescript\nuseMetric = process.env.HUBOT_WUNDERGROUND_USE_METRIC?\nmsg.send \"#{report.title} in #{location}: #{if useMetric then report.fcttext_metric else report.fcttext} (#{formatted_ttl data})\"\nA little less repetition. Or, move that string to a variable.\n. The robot.respond below doesn't actually accept optional category afterwards. Is this missing commits?\n. Can you prefix this environment variable with HUBOT_? That'd also let call it HUBOT_9GAG_NO_GIFS.\n. You could use the existential operator here to make no_gifs a boolean, ie:\ncoffeescript\nno_gifs = process.env.NINEGAG_NO_GIFS?\nThat'd simplify the conditional below.\n. You could probably use javascript's built in escape rather than implementing and using escape_html_characters.\n. You should make sure to check this is set at some point before using, otherwise the API call will probably fail. I'd suggest doing that in the robot.respond block.\n. You might want to check res.statusCode too. It'll depend on the API, but probably make sure it's 200.\n. err interpolated in a string is just the name. You probably want the stack trace too, ie include err.stack\n. I'm not sure I follow :sweat: \n. If you have a msg object, there's a msg.random helper for doing just this.\n. I try to use a 'man page style' syntax for examples, so it's clear what is part of the syntax, and what is user supplied, ie:\n@<Hearthstone card> - Return <Hearthstone card>'s stats: name - mana - race - type - attack/hlth - descr\n. Please don't use raw.github.com as an API. It should be (relatively) easy to re-use https://github.com/nckg/Hearthstone-Cards in a very small heroku app to serve this up.\n. This would probably be better as a character group, ie:\ncoffeescript\nrobot.hear /it['`]?s a trap\\b/i, (msg) ->\nThat would avoid making it a capture group too.\n. This indentation looks off. Does this even work? The msg.http should two spaces indented compared to the outer robot.respond.\n. Don't you set this to true above?\n. Strings can interpolate variables, so you don't need to append with +, ie:\ncoffeescript\nmsg.send \"Last: $#{response.last}, High: $#{response.high}, Low: $#{response.low}, Volume: #{response.volume}\"\n. Not sure what this is trying to do. ? is an existential operator, so if you just need to know response.last isn't null or undefined, you'd use:\ncoffeescript\nif response.last?\n. Same indention issue here as in bacon.\n. It's more of a style thing, but I tend to avoid underscores in commands. Dashes are a bit easier to type, and spaces even easier.\nIf you use space, you'd need to define robot.respond /buffer profiles/ first, and then call msg.finish() so the message buffering command doesn't trigger.\n. You shouldn't actually need parens around this method call.\n. Might want to include the actual err and err.stack for debugging.\n. To be on the safe side, you should use the existential ?, which checks for undefined, and null, ie:\ncoffeescript\nif profile?\n. You should check that this environment variable is defined. I recommend doing that at within the robot.respond so the user gets better feedback about why it's not working.\n. cc https://github.com/github/hubot/issues/647 for identifying different adapters\n. This should be robot.respond to match the Commands above. respond match when the text starts with hubot, where hear will match anywhere in the text. Alternatively, remove the hubot from the command prefix above.\n. You should definitely check the presence of app_key and app_id before using them, ie:\ncoffeescript\nunless app_id? and app_key?\n   msg.reply \"Missing HUBOT_YUMMLY_APP_ID and HUBOT_YUMMLY_APP_KEY, so can't help sate your hunger :sweat: Go to https://developer.yummly.com/signup get started, and set those variables in your environment to help me help you\n  return\n. This is probably from debugging, but I wouldn't console.log if you can avoid it, especially if it's just the body.\n. You should check if err? and if res.statusCode is 200 before parsing the body. Either of those is an indicator something went wrong, so JSON.parse is going to fail.\n. msg.send is async, so this can come in random order. msg.send takes multiple args and ensures order, so you  can try that instead.\n. If you are replying to the user, you can use msg.reply instead. This does the adapter-specific thing, for example hipchat uses @username to reply, but most other just use username:.\n. Don't forget that coffeescript does string interpolation. You might also just want to include both the message and url in the same thing, ie:\ncoffeescript\nmsg.reply \"how about #{name}? http://www.yummly.com/recipe/#{id}\"\n. Nitpicking, but I'd remove these extra empty comments, and newlines at the beginning of the script.\n. To make it more compatible with stocks.coffee, maybe add me to the optional things, ie (info|price|quote|me)?. Similarly, make foroptional.\nAnother tip here... you can make these groups non-capturing with ?: in the beginning of the parens. This makes it nice to have less msg.matches to track indexes of.\n. Usually this is a github login, so we can easily cc people on issues that come up.\n. If possible, might want to check for this and give a warning.\n. You could also say unless robot.brain.data.quote_database?\n. You can remove these 2 lines, as they are covered in the Commands section below.\n. These commands should all be prefixed with hubot, to reflect that they are robot.responds. They automatically get translated to your bot's name when you ask for help.\n. You should remove this line, as it'd show up in hubot help.\n. You could use msg.reply to send direct it at the person saying it. I think this would get the original feel a bit better.\n. These 3 variables don't need to be quoted. They would be strings already if they are present, otherwise undefined.\n. I would add space between these commas, ie msg, action, callback\n. Depending on their API, you might also want to check res.statusCode. Most scripts check for like:\ncoffeescript\nif res.statusCode isnt 200\n  msg.send \"Got HTTP #{res.statusCode} back from Freshdesk :(\"\n  return\n. Some APIs don't always return valid JSON if there's an error, usually better to wrap in a try/rescue block.\n. What adapter are you using? This could feasibly generate lots of output if there's a lot of open things, flooding the room. I like to make things like this one long message over many lines, which some adapters like Campfire would render as a single message. Others that don't support it (like IRC) would split over several messages anyways.\n. I would ask what it looks like to an end-user if this isn't set? Having it logged is good, but if it's unset for some reason, it can take a bit to track it down to the logs.\nI tend to like to make each command msg.reply with this error, in addition to having it at boot time.\n. I think you want robot.hear /(.*)/ here instead. catchAll only gets called if no other listener matches, where as hear /(.*)/ would get everything\n. Is there a PR for this functionality? Would be worth mentioning it in the issue, so there's a cross-issue mention. Also, in case anyone comes across this and sees it's been merged.\n. 30 is still quite a bit of a flood. Since it's going to be an external package, you should be able to iterate on it yourself though if there's problems.\n. This should be included in the Dependencies above. Or, if you get it as a NPM package, you'd just include it as an NPM dependency.\n. Empty string isn't 'falsy', so I don't think it would ever fall back on 'hubot'. Maybe:\ncoffeescript\nprefix = info.path.replace('/', '')\nprefix = 'hubot' if prefix is ''\n. Ow my truthyness. Confirmed this as well.\n. The syntax I like to use would be like: hubot check on <user> and a second entry for check on everyone. This is used for hubot help, so I would include some more explanation.\n. REDIS_URL or similar should be on this list. Not every hubot is using the redis brain, which requires that.\n. These should be snippets copied from a package.json, so you a user can easily paste them in. If you extract to your own npm package, you'd be able to just specify them as a dependency.\n. What are these notes for? Typically, save this for an notes about usage. If this was for debugging, I'd remove it, or if it's for developing, I'd explain why it's hear.\n. I try to remove commented code whenever possible. If you want this around for debugging, you can use robot.logger.debug, which would be displayed when HUBOT_LOG_LEVEL=debug\n. Try using robot.emit 'err', err, msg instead. This would use the error handling API\n. This would probably generate a ton of logs, and not be very informative, so would say remove it.\n. One concern I would have is that multiple of these firing at the same time, and clobbering the results. It might be better to use multiple keys, and increment numbers independently, in order to make sure things stay atomic.\n. Coffeescript has an existential operator ? which reads a little bit better, ie:\ncoffeescript\nif not msg.match[2]?\nIt might also read nicer to assign this to a variable, ie repo since the hear regex is pretty hard to grok.\n. If I'm reading this right, I don't think you're actually using msg.match[1], so you might make it non-capturing.\n. You should check the existence of process.env.HUBOT_GITHUB_ORG before trying to use it. This would break for users not setting that as is.\n. You'll want to check that these are defined before using them.\n. These should be prefixed with hubot, since they are respond commands.\n. One pattern I've seen is to also support a room id on the URL, and send notifications to that. That way, you just configure stash to send to a room-specific URL, and the message goes there.\n. You can probably remove the capture around (remind ). That would mean you are using everything you are matching, and can change the msg.match down by one.\n. Would it be worth making this configurable, but with a default of peadmin?\n. This should probably be an environment variable, rather than hard-coded to a specific token.\n. I would consider changing this to a robot.respond instead of a hear bounded to the beginning of a string.\n. This should be a github user, so it can be mentioned in an Issue.\n. I've found it preferrable to do this check on each robot.respond, because then you can inform the user why it doesn't return the answer. Otherwise, the listeners don't get defined so a user's command would fall on deaf robot ears.\n. having the -- feels command-liney. You can probably just omit them, or make it optional.\nIt also might be worth making the @ optional, and possibly taking a URL to a twitter profile. Same idea would apply to the github below.\n. I've found it useful to include details on how to acquire this either right here, or in the Notes section.\n. Maybe it's just me, but I don't think you need to justify the lack of a feature like this.\n. I would change this to a robot.respond instead.\n. When you make this an npm package, you'd be able to make this an explicit dependency, so no extra setup on the user's part.\n. Where would you get this key? I've found it useful to include that documentation here or in a Notes section.\n. Can you search for images with spaces in them? It's currently \\w, which would match only word characters, not spaces. I'd switch that to (.*).\n. Is there anything that would lead this to being length 0? Should have an else clause just in case.\n. I would check for err, and also that res.statusCode is 200 (or whatever it's expected status code is).\n. Shouldn't we say the beeradvocate API is deprecated? This makes it sound like this command is deprecated. It's less deprecated, and more the backing service is gone.\n. Check out hubot's brain's userForX methods https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/src/brain.coffee#L100-L149\nIf this doesn't work for the @ mention, might be something to fix for the hipchat adapter.\n. This seems like debugging, so would be better for a robot.logger.debug call than replying back to the user. \n. Same thing here.\n. Looks like you found them below, so should remove this if it's not in use.\n. These should be npm dependencies, and in a format that you can copy-paste into package.json. jquery is downloaded at runtime so wouldn't need to be here.\n. I like to follow the man page format to denote input and optional versus required. That'd make it hubot http status <code>. I'd also include an explanation of what it does, so hubot help is more helpful.\n. This should be a github username, so it's easy to @ mention them on an issue.\n. This will come out of order, because async. If you pass multiple things to msg.send, they should come back in order for most adapters.\n. you could say process.env.HUBOT_USER_HISTORY_LINES or 5, instead of having to check it below again.\n. You can use the existential operator, which checks for null and undefined: if userhistory?\n. You probably could use apToLv to generate this on the fly\n. This should be in a format you can copy paste into package.json. ie \"cheerio\": \"*\". If you move it to an npm package, you can just specify it as a real npm dependency.\n. I'm thinking it'd be better to keep the pager namespace here.\n. pagerDutyShotgunId needs to be checked to see if it exists before using at some point. I wouldn't say it's a required thing, so probably wouldn't add it to missingEnvironmentForApi. Checking it first thing in the respond callback is probably the best place to check it.\n. > What namespace do you suggest? My concern is that from a UX perspective\n/pager shotgun, and my concern is from a different UX perspective. If you see references to /shotgun me randomly, do you know what it is for? If you see /pager shotgun me, the namespace provides more context about what it is.\n\nthere's no reversion chatops for /pager me.\n\nsounds like a code problem :trollface:\n. This is done asynchronously, so if you set process.env.HUBOT_GITIO, this updated commit.url isn't ensured to be set by the time robot.send is called.\nTo get around that, I'd suggest refactoring most of the logic to it's own function, so it can either be called in a callback for gitio if  process.env.HUBOT_GITIO or by itself.\n. You need to check this is set before using it, otherwise the API call will fail without feedback to the user. I'd suggest doing that check in the robot.respond call, so someone trying to use it would know why it's not working.\n. I would split this into two lines, one for each. I would also separate the command from description with a dash\n. This should be in the format you can copy & paste into package.json. If you move to an npm package though, you can remove this section, and instead have your package depend on underscore.\n. This looks like it's hard-tabbed, when the rest of the file is softtabbed.\n. I tend to use man page style syntax for these commands. So, this might be `hubot  - return  from imhc.\nAlso, keep in mind this is put in hubot help, so if people see these commands used, they are likely to use help to find it. Given that, it may be worth documenting the commands here so they show up in help.\n. This API key probably shouldn't be hardcoded. Try to use an environment variable instead. https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/scripting.md#environment-variables\n. Was it intentional to remove this? Seems it'd be easy enough to parse and use the new API.\n. I would reconsider exiting on the absence of this environment variable. There are probably existing users of this script who wouldn't have the API key set, so their bot would exit on startup next time they upgrade.\nA better approach is checking at respond time if the key is set and responding accordingly. See https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/scripting.md#environment-variables for examples.\n. This should be updated to reflect HUBOT_REPLYGIF_API_KEY\n. That seems like a perfect idea. You can just say like apiKey = process.env.HUBOT_REPLYGIF_API_KEY or \"whatever\". I'd add a comment to point at the about page noting it has a default API key.\n. The pattern I've used is #.png. That way, it's not interpreted as a param to the http.\n. Coffeescript has an existential operator which is a bit more idiomatic and thorough (checks undefined, null, false): \ncoffeescript\nreply += \" \" + description if description?\nAlso, might as well use string interpolation:\nreply += \" #{description} \" if description?\n. I'd suggest aligning this and .post() in the same column as msg.http above.\n. You could also say unless success?\n. Do these really need to be loaded in the brain? It doesn't seem like you manipulate them at all, so there's not much value in hardcoding them.\nIf you do keep them, you'll want to put this inside a robot.brain.on 'loaded', () -> callback.\n. It's important to check if these environment variables are defined before using them. See https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/scripting.md#environment-variables for some ideas on how to erro check them.\n. Thanks to coffeescript, switch returns a value, so you can:\ncoffeescript\nfrom = switch unit\n       when \"seconds\", \"second\" then 1\n       when \"minutes\", \"minute\" then 60\n       when \"hours\", \"hour\" then from 3600\n       when \"days\", \"day\" then 3600 * 24\n       when \"months\", \"month\" then 3600 * 24 * 30\n       else from = 3600\n. I'd reconsider having share be first. In general, I try to avoid having too generic words as prefixes to commands, like share, show, list, etc.\n. Keep in mind that the commands listed here, are shown during hubot help, so it's important they have enough context about what they are for someone to find. In addition, they should mention vividcortex, because right now if you did /help vividcortex, it wouldn't match anything.\n. You might want to check if the rule matches /\\d+/ before trying to access it\n. This user wouldn't exist for Campfire and other adapters.\n. You should check is set before using it.\n. Both of these packages are included in node, so shouldn't have to use the npm versions of them.\n. I'd include this in a Notes section as an example.\n. You can string interpolate the end of this, ie \"HEADER-> #{headerData}: #{req.headers[headerData]}\"\n. Also worth noting the ; isn't required on any of these lines.\n. I'd suggest making this regex a little more flexible, like /on[- ]?hold tickets/ for people saying onhold tickets and on-hold tickets.\n. If you don't need to use robot.brain.data.eval_langs anymore, can probably remove the robot.brain.on 'loaded' callback, as well as the other code to try to prepopulate the languages.\n. Is this a stray character?\n. The parens aren't needed here.\n. I would make the http a non capturing group. That way, you don't have to change the msg.match, ie: /is (?:http\\:\\/\\/)?(.*?) (up|down)(\\?)?/i\n. The parens aren't necessary here. If you are doing it for usability, I'd make it non-capturing at least, ie (?:yoda pic)\n. This looks like a debugging statement to remove. At the very least, I'd use robot.logger.debug instead so HUBOT_LOG_LEVEL is respected.\n. If you can change fu( )? to fu ?, then you don't need to change the msg.match index used by to. It's also generally better to not capture things you aren't going to use.\n. Looks like a mismatch here between what's documented to use (HUBOT_RABBITMQ_ROOT_URL) and what is used from the code (HUBOT_RABBITMQ_HOST)\n. Correct. It'd return false if the property doesn't exist, which would trigger the || part of the line.\n. ",

You could probably put the description here to be \"Returns a random meme image\", but not a huge deal I think.\n. Again, here the description could be \"Prints a nice abstract of the given topic\"\n. This could actually use a description, but should probably be a separate issue. i have no idea what the heck this does from reading the header.\n. Seems there are quite a lot of blank descriptions or the description is in the command. Perhaps a separate pull request once the formatting is at least in place would be warranted instead of pointing them all out here.\n. Commands: None? Shouldn't this be required?\n. Think we're missing a command here. Looks like the original doc header had two commands.\n```\nhubot sqs status - Returns the status of SQS queues.\nhubot ec2 status - Returns the status of EC2 instances.\n```\n. Another Commands: None\nPerhaps this is another area for a separate issue? \"Find all scripts not listing a command and document the command?\n. Missing command doc.\n. LOL - wow, this just sounds like a terrible idea - what the heck are the standards for allowing a script in? Whoa.\n. Missing command doc.\n. Missing command and description docs.\n.

Is there a better way?\nThanks :)\n. @technicalpickles Sounds good. I'll write a quick pull request for it. I'm also submitting a pull request for my tweeter script (https://github.com/jhubert/hubot-tweeter).\n. My personal preference lately has been to use git add -p to make sure I'm adding the right things to the commit and not checking in any bad code and then to use git commit -m \"short message\" to start writing the message. If the message feels like it's getting a bit long or needs some more explaining, I just add -e at the end to open it up in the editor:  git commit -m \"short message\" -e\nThis allows me to only jump into the editor when I feel it's necessary but make that decision at the end of my short message instead of diving into a full git commit right away every time.\nAlso, I've aliased git commit -m to gc, which means I just write gc \"short message\" -e. Short and sweet.\n. Whoops. Nice catch @scooter-dangle. Sorry about that.\n. @technicalpickles This pr adequately accounts for my incompetence. Please merge at your convenience. :)\n.

    "nickhammond": "I like this idea as well, here's a couple solutions that come to mind. Not saying it's the route everything should go but I just wanted to keep the discussion going. With all of these options each plugin would have a package.json file that specifies the front matter(dependencies, name, description, author, etc.) that's currently in all of the plugin files and then the actual plugin script.\n1. Scripts are moved into subdirectories within the current /github/hubot-scripts repository so that each plugin could have a package.json and then the main script file. I think the scripts directory is just too big for this now though. I just looked and there's 420 scripts in src/scripts.\n2. Plugins are pulled out of hubot-scripts and managed within their own author's repository, this might be difficult to get authors to do but who knows. \n3. A hubot-scripts organization is created and individual plugins are created under that. This is similar to what opscode ended up doing with their chef cookbooks, going from https://github.com/opscode/cookbooks(a company repository with a bunch of cookbooks in it) to https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks(an organization that manages multiple repositories).\nBy looking at npm's package.json documentation it looks like we'd have the majority of the support right away from the specs of that file. The biggest discrepancy being how to specify the environment based configuration.\nHere's the aws.coffee plugin as an example\n``` coffee\nDescription:\nQueries for the status of AWS services\n\nDependencies:\n\"aws2js\": \"0.6.12\"\n\"underscore\": \"1.3.3\"\n\"moment\": \"1.6.2\"\n\nConfiguration:\nHUBOT_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID\nHUBOT_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\nHUBOT_AWS_SQS_REGIONS\nHUBOT_AWS_EC2_REGIONS\n\nCommands:\nhubot sqs status - Returns the status of SQS queues\nhubot ec2 status - Returns the status of EC2 instances\n\nNotes:\nIt's highly recommended to use a read-only IAM account for this purpose\nhttps://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?\nSQS - requires ListQueues, GetQueueAttributes and ReceiveMessage\nEC2 - requires EC2:Describe, elasticloadbalancing:Describe, cloudwatch:ListMetrics,\ncloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics, cloudwatch:Describe, autoscaling:Describe\n\nAuthor:\nIristyle\n```\nThe same front matter specified in package.json outlined below, not sure about the commands & configuration sections though. With commands, it'd probably make sense to just provide a string for the command or a hash to denote the command and usage. For the configuration section, I know package.json has a config section but it doesn't really make sense for the usage within Hubot as you specify the defaults within the package.  I'm thinking notes can stay in the plugin file as that's more of a mini readme for the plugin. The \"_hubot\" section I suppose could just be \"hubot\", just browsed around some other npm packages and there's not really a consistent format for extra data and NPM shouldn't ever have a name conflict with \"hubot\".\njson\n{\n  \"name\": \"hubot-aws\",\n  \"description\": \"Queries for the status of AWS services\",\n  \"keywords\": [\"hubot\", \"aws\"],\n  \"main\": \"./aws.coffee\",\n  \"author\": \"Iristyle\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"aws2js\": \"0.6.12\",\n    \"underscore\": \"1.3.3\",\n    \"moment\": \"1.6.2\",\n  },\n  \"_hubot\": {\n    \"commands\": [\n      {\n        \"command\": \"hubot sqs status\",\n        \"description\": \"Returns the status of SQS queues\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"command\": \"hubot ec2 status\",\n        \"description\": \"Returns the status of EC2 instances\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"configuration\": [\n      \"HUBOT_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID\", \n      \"HUBOT_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\", \n      \"HUBOT_AWS_SQS_REGIONS\", \n      \"HUBOT_AWS_EC2_REGIONS\"\n     ]\n  }\n}\nDepending on which way you go that would modify the Hubot loading functionality, external-scripts.json would need to be backwards compatible to support aws.coffee and pointing to a repo with a package.json file.\nThis is somewhat of an ambitious effort but it seems that Hubot has just grown up too fast :)\nThoughts?\n. Yah, I think an organization is the way to go after I thought about this some more.\n\nI'm not sure I'm a fan of this. It moves the documentation further away from the code, and also having to parse the package.json in addition to the scripts.\n\nAt the same time though, we're currently parsing a plain text header for various items to determine the dependencies, commands, name, etc. Instead of parsing based on detecting a line that starts with \"# Dependencies\", we'd be able to just access the key within the package.json file. Also, I wouldn't say it really removes the documentation away from the code as package.json and aws.coffee will be sitting right next to each other in the same directory. It's somewhat similar to the details in a gemspec file actually. Specifies dependencies, authors, repository, homepage, included files, etc.\n. ",

Nothing should interfere, script receives the HTTP request after all. I would try pushing JSON data to Hubot's jenkins-notifier URL using curl or triggering a build failure on purpose and debug the request again, take a look at the headers. \nAlso, other NPM packages that Hubot depends on may be the cause.\n. @technicalpickles I could do that\n. Wanted to create hubot-jenkins-notifier repo and npm package, and found this: https://github.com/halkeye/hubot-jenkins-notifier - npm package already registered under that name. Perhaps @halkeye wants to take over the maintenance since most of the job is already done?\n. @halkeye I can co-maintain hubot-jenkins-notifier if you don't mind. @technicalpickles or somebody else who controls hubot-scripts org should fork https://github.com/halkeye/hubot-jenkins-notifier over there, if everything is fine with the package.\n. @technicalpickles your regexp has a flaw, when you have @one/two/thee it will grab @one/two as a mention, which is not right. \nI tried for a while but couldn't produce a single expresion which would correctly find mentions in string like this:\n\"text @org/one/two @org/one @guy1 @guy2 text\". If you check for (\\s|$) in the end of your expression, it eats the beginning of the next mention.\nSo I just added a filter for multiple /.\n. > @one/two/thee isn't a valid org team mention as far as I knew.\nExactly, and /(^|\\s)(@[\\w\\-]+(?:\\/[\\w\\-]+)?)/g would match @one/two instead of matching nothing. My version of regex would match @one/two/three, but fe989ce would filter it out because of two slashes. \nIf you can write a regex that would match @org/one, @guy1 and @guy2 in \"text @org/one/two @org/one @guy1 @guy2 text\" - hurray. I couldn't. \n. coffee> \"text @org/one/two @org/one @guy1 @guy2 text\".match(/(?:^|\\s)(@[\\w-]+(?:\\/[\\w-]+)?)/g)\n[ ' @org/one', <--- this shouldn't be here\n  ' @org/one',\n  ' @guy1',\n  ' @guy2' ]\nWorld boundary is the main issue. We have to check for space before @, and if we check for a space after the word, it eats the next match, like this:\ncoffee> \"text @org/one/two @org/one @guy1 @guy2 text\".match(/(?:^|\\s)(@[\\w-]+(?:\\/[\\w-]+)?)(\\s|$)/g)\n[ ' @org/one ', ' @guy2 ' ]\n@guy1 is missing. \n.

Done, tested with jsdom versions above and below 0.7.0, when breaking change was introduced.\nMoving this script to hubot-scripts org would either mean that there are two different http-info scripts floating around, or this one would have to be removed, which is a little more drastic than bumping up the dependency version number.\n.

I'd love a way to customize for single-word plusplus'ing by default, but allowing multi-word if quotes are used.

Does this work well enough? Added unless @cache[key]? to avoid downcasing for lookup and storage if the caps-sensitive version matches. Should preserve backwards compat.\n.
