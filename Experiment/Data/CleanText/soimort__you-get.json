Regarding the trailing spaces, they will eventually be removed.\n. I prefer to detach the player process from you-get, but I'm merging this commit for now since it implements a useful feature.\nI wanted to use player-specific wrappers but never has time to implement that (https://github.com/radaiming/you-get/tree/new-features/src/you_get/cli_wrapper/player) but certainly subprocess.call(shlex.split(player) + list(urls)) works for many players :sunglasses: \n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. Hi,\nDo you have a clue when this error happens?\nIt seems to me it could happen only when running python setup.py, and the default python is Python 2.x -- which is not a preferable way of installing because you-get depends on Python 3.x.\n. :smiley_cat: \n. A big thanks! :octocat: \n. Thanks! :+1: \n. thanks for the pull request. Will take a look a few days later.\n. Is it supposed to be like this?\n\n.

Thanks for the pull request anyway! :smile: \n. :+1: \n. Will take a look later, thx\n. :+1: \n. \nI'll review all PRs to you-get at a later date.\n. Sorry for the slow merge - thanks!\n.

You forgot to remove print (url), but everything is working fine now.\nThanks!\n. :+1:\n. :ok_hand:\n. Thanks, the major issue #355 related to Letv is now fixed!\n. Looks good. Thanks!\n. \n. \n. Good job anyway, the commit is kind of a mess...\n1. Please don't keep irrelevant files in commits; instead, reset them and force push back again.\n2. In the code, (videobam.py)\nold_fake_headers = fake_headers\nfake_hreaders = old_fake_headers\nWhat are...those?\n3. You don't change the version number. If every pull request comes with its own arbitrary version number, then no one can keep track of them. A pull request is a bunch of commits that fix something, nothing more. Some PRs came earlier but some others might be merged sooner, we don't know that. So don't mess with the version number anyway.\n4. The file permission is 644, please don't change this (is it your Intellij IDE changed it for you?)\nMost of our contributors write code in emacs or vim, so we haven't ignored .* in .gitignore (better if we do). When working in an IDE, you just need to be careful about those project files generated by IDE.\nBasically I don't care about code quality too much (as long as it implements something it's always welcome), we can improve it later. But I'd like to see commits that are simple and clean (no unnecessary change).\nIn this case, just having one commit that adds necessary code to common.py and extractors/ would be perfect.\n. Nevermind.\nIt seems you used songtaste.py as a template. I don't even remember why these code are there, but they should be removed (both in songtaste.py and your videobam.py).\nYou don't have to withdraw a pull request - you can just reset everything and git push --force to the same branch, and old commits shall be gone. Anyway, it does no harm to start a new one.\n. Perfect. Thank you!\n. Version numbers like N-64706-g2f71aeb and n2.3-8-g2f71aeb are composed of: revision number/release branch + git hash. Some stable branches (like n1.0.10) are even older than 1.1; we might need to consider 1.0 as a fallback.\n. There is even a 0.5 branch, which they are still maintaining:\nhttps://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/releases/tag/n0.5.14\nOld stable branches like these don't have a concat demuxer - I guess a better solution is to handle everything in exceptions, so we don't need to know the version number at all. For now, choosing 1.0 will make sure everything works (even for branches like 0.5 and 1.0)\n. OK. Thanks\n. Is cx_freeze popular among most users?\nI don't see the reason we must support non-standard Python tools, for doing this will only add unnecessary complexity to our code.\n. Thanks for the PR. For now I'll keep this one (if anybody wants to use cx_freeze). However, I'm considering py2exe as an alternative for packaging Windows executables in the future.\n. Manually merged (your branch needs a rebase)\n. Almost every video I tried threw me an error message:\nyou_get: [Error] Do not support for iQIYI VIP video.\nThat's not the right reason - It's simply because iQIYI forbids access to most of its videos for oversea users.\nI'm restarting the travis build now.\n. Hmm. Those videos are not viewable on my web browser, but now downloadable for me (although extremely slow). Thanks for the fix.\n. Which version of Python are you using?\n. Just asking.\nAccording to the document:\n\nChanged in version 3.3: ASCII-only Unicode strings are now accepted by the decoding functions of the modern interface.\n\nSo I guess this bug is specific to Python 3.1 & 3.2. Can you replicate the issue on Python 3.3?\n. It's very reasonable to keep our code compatible with Python 3.1 & 3.2. (although it already works well on 3.3 & 3.4)\nI'm changing it to:\npy\nbase64.b64decode(bytes(ep, 'ascii'))\nNo more extra check to see if ep needs to be converted to a bytes type, we can always use it as bytes, since this will work on any version of python 3.x. Just to get rid of these unthoughtful changes in Python.\nThanks for pointing this out!\n. It's better to put _unit_prefixes and parse_size inside extractors.dongting - since no other extractor depends on them.\n. Thanks!:shipit:\n. :ok_hand:\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks, I'll review this at a later time.\n. This is not working. It seems your branch is messed up with the commits you made in #417, but those changes are not included in this pull request. (Also, they have a conflict with the current develop)\nWould you please:\n1) Create an individual branch, and rebase it from the latest upstream:develop.\n2) Commit all your changes to that branch and send pull requests from that branch,. not your master or develop. (you can delete that branch afterwards)\n```\n$ ./you-get http://live.bilibili.com/live/5096.html\nVideo Site: bilibili.com\nTitle:      \u6211\u5450,\u60f3\u6210\u4e3a\u6b63\u4e49\u7684\u4f19\u4f34\uff01\nType:       Flash video (video/x-flv)\nSize:       -0.0 MiB (-1 Bytes)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/soimort/Projects/you-get-develop/src/you_get/common.py\", line 488, in download_urls\n    total_size = urls_size(urls)\n  File \"/home/soimort/Projects/you-get-develop/src/you_get/common.py\", line 209, in urls_size\n    return sum(map(url_size, urls))\n  File \"/home/soimort/Projects/you-get-develop/src/you_get/common.py\", line 202, in url_size\n    size = int(response.headers['content-length'])\nTypeError: int() argument must be a string or a number, not 'NoneType'\nDownloading \u6211\u5450,\u60f3\u6210\u4e3a\u6b63\u4e49\u7684\u4f19\u4f34\uff01.flv ...\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"./you-get\", line 13, in \n    you_get.main(repo_path=_filepath)\n  File \"/home/soimort/Projects/you-get-develop/src/you_get/main.py\", line 91, in main\n    main()\n  File \"/home/soimort/Projects/you-get-develop/src/you_get/common.py\", line 995, in main\n    script_main('you-get', any_download, any_download_playlist)\n  File \"/home/soimort/Projects/you-get-develop/src/you_get/common.py\", line 891, in script_main\n    download_main(download, download_playlist, args, playlist, output_dir=output_dir, merge=merge, info_only=info_only)\n  File \"/home/soimort/Projects/you-get-develop/src/you_get/common.py\", line 783, in download_main\n    download(url, kwargs)\n  File \"/home/soimort/Projects/you-get-develop/src/you_get/common.py\", line 988, in any_download\n    m.download(url, kwargs)\n  File \"/home/soimort/Projects/you-get-develop/src/you_get/extractors/bilibili.py\", line 142, in bilibili_download\n    bilibili_download_by_cid(id, title, output_dir=output_dir, merge=merge, info_only=info_only)\n  File \"/home/soimort/Projects/you-get-develop/src/you_get/extractors/bilibili.py\", line 123, in bilibili_download_by_cid\n    download_urls(urls, title, type, total_size=None, output_dir=output_dir, merge=merge)\n  File \"/home/soimort/Projects/you-get-develop/src/you_get/common.py\", line 511, in download_urls\n    url_save(url, filepath, bar, refer = refer, faker = faker)\n  File \"/home/soimort/Projects/you-get-develop/src/you_get/common.py\", line 267, in url_save\n    file_size = url_size(url, faker = faker)\n  File \"/home/soimort/Projects/you-get-develop/src/you_get/common.py\", line 202, in url_size\n    size = int(response.headers['content-length'])\nTypeError: int() argument must be a string or a number, not 'NoneType'\n``\n.

However, there's something you might want to fix in your code: handle title names with slashes / correctly.\n``\n\u279c  Biligrab git:(master) python2 biligrab.py -a 1652964 -p 1 -s 0\nYour targe download is av1652964, part 1, from source 0\nCannot read cookie, may affect some videos...\n('ffmpeg', 'wget')\nhttps://api.bilibili.com/view?appkey=85eb6835b0a1034e&id=1652964&type=xml&sign=5ef9df61522c8dcef6579a7184e41676\nFetching webpage...\ncid is 2516259\npartname is \nTitle is \u301010\u6708\u3011\u9ed1\u670d\u7269\u8bed 01 \u4e2d\u5c9b\u5065\u4eba/\u4f50\u4f50\u6728\u5e0c/\u5c71\u672c\u88d5\u5178/\u67cf\u6728\u7531\u7eaa\u3010\u4eba\u4eba\u5b57\u5e55\u3011\nFetching XML...\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n  0     0    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--     0Warning: Failed to create the file \u301010\u6708\u3011\u9ed1\u670d\u7269\u8bed 01 \nWarning: \u4e2d\u5c9b\u5065\u4eba/\u4f50\u4f50\u6728\u5e0c/\u5c71\u672c\u88d5\u5178/\u67cf\u6728\u7531\u7eaa\u3010\u4eba\u4eba\u5b57\u5e55\u3011.\nWarning: xml: No such file or directory\n  3  100k    3  3831    0     0   5316      0  0:00:19 --:--:--  0:00:19  7081\ncurl: (23) Failed writing body (0 != 9417)\ngzip: 2516259.xml.gz: No such file or directory\nThe XML file, \u301010\u6708\u3011\u9ed1\u670d\u7269\u8bed 01 \u4e2d\u5c9b\u5065\u4eba/\u4f50\u4f50\u6728\u5e0c/\u5c71\u672c\u88d5\u5178/\u67cf\u6728\u7531\u7eaa\u3010\u4eba\u4eba\u5b57\u5e55\u3011.xml should be ready...enjoy!\nFinding video location...\n1 videos in part 1 to download, fetch yourself a cup of coffee...\nDownloading 1 of 1 videos in part 1...\n--2014-10-26 08:29:03--  http://static.hdslb.com/error.mp4\nResolving static.hdslb.com... 178.79.128.50\nConnecting to static.hdslb.com|178.79.128.50|:80... connected.\nHTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK\nLength: 180635 (176K) [video/mp4]\nSaving to:0.flv'\n100%[================================>] 180,635      588K/s   in 0.3s    \n2014-10-26 08:29:03 (588 KB/s) -

For now, if anyone needs this feature (and doesn't care about overseas usability), you can check out the youku-full-video branch.\n. There are a few issues left in your code: First, it's no longer able to download password-protected videos; Second, while the old m3u8 method does extract metainfo of region-limited videos for oversea users, this one does not. (I was thinking if we can merge two methods together so if the k.youku.com method fails, you-get will fallback to the pl.youku.com one)\nI'll look into this further when I catch a break (can't work with code these days).\n. need to bring back the handling of password-protected videos, then it'll be perfect :shipit: \n. For the 2nd point: it's not important now. As quite a lot of users complain about incomplete videos, we can stick with k.youku.comas long as it fixes the issue. The old m3u8 method is flawed, and I haven't yet figure out a way to extract all video segments from pl.youku.com. For simplicity, whether to use Unblock Youku's proxy (or another proxy) should be left to users to choose, we really shouldn't bother with that in extractors/youku.py.\n. I noticed a few edge cases not covered by the new approach (don't know if it's just me, but the old method seems to reach more videos)\nUsing this PR:\n$ you-get http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMjU1NzMxODE2.html\nyou_get: Error\nUsing develop branch:\n```\n$ you-get http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMjU1NzMxODE2.html\nsite:                \u4f18\u9177 (Youku)\ntitle:               \u7b2c001\u8bdd \u5929\u624d\u7bee\u7403\u624b!\u8bde\u751f\nstream:\n    - format:        mp4\n      container:     mp4\n      video-profile: \u9ad8\u6e05\n      size:          91.2 MiB (95653457 bytes)\n    # download-with: you-get --format=mp4 [URL]\nDownloading \u7b2c001\u8bdd \u5929\u624d\u7bee\u7403\u624b!\u8bde\u751f.mp4 ...\n  0.8% (  0.8/91.2 MB) [                                        ] 1/4^C%\n```\nI'll keep tracking this issue.

We'll see how to get things right for the new Youku API. Thanks for the PR, anyway!\n. Would you mind rebasing these commits to squash them into one? It's impossible to see what changes you've made compared to the original code; the diff is almost impossible to review.\nPlease don't add irrelevant files to your commit; also, don't commit conflict indication lines like <<<<<<< HEAD. Thanks.\n. You may see https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Squashing-Commits on how to squash your Git commits. However, I can imagine there are a lot of conflicts against the latest develop in your current branch. If you feel unable to resolve them, I suggest that you do it the simple way:\n1. Close this PR.\n2. Create a new feature branch (for example, youku-fix) based on the HEAD of the current develop. (It is not advisable to use your own develop to create PRs, unless you just want to do a one-time PR.)\n3. Make necessary changes and commit them.\n4. Open a new PR.\n. Yes, you can do that, but there is really no need to delete a fork and fork it again. git branch -u upstream/develop will just let you track the remote develop branch.\n. We do not have plan to provide specific support for a site like this (because such sites are too many). Technically, those sites are very similar and easy to handle (they embedded the video source in HTML directly), so I'll prefer a more \"generic\" extractor for all of em (that's going to be implemented in the future)\nThanks for the PR anyway!\n. Although join_mp4.py has been out of maintenance for some time (I encourage all users to install ffmpeg or libav instead). this one seems fine to me.\nWill review and merge it later. Thanks!\n. :+1:\n. Seems really nice. I'll take a thorough look at this later next week (Although I was considering a complete refactoring of the legacy code a while ago, there is no reason we shouldn't solve existing issues first.)\n. This PR might need a rebase...\n. @radaiming If you have any time, you might want to have a look at this fix for QQ support (since I'm not familiar with this part of code...)\n@pikeszfish @lvqier \u591a\u8c22\u3002\n\u6682\u65f6\u6ca1\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u7ec6\u770b\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u90a3\u4e2a\u7279\u5b9a\u7684User-Agent\u662f\u5fc5\u987b\u7684\u5417\uff1f\n. @radaiming Sure, I just wanted to confirm if it is ok with you before I merge this, since this PR has overwritten most of your old code.\nI'll test this myself later.\n. Was this sent by mistake?:angry:\n. Please play with your own repository!\n. Nice catch.\n. Isn't foramt a typo?\n. This piece of code is weird 'cause it's not following the convention of youku.py and youtube.py. Due to its usefulness, I'll leave its refactoring to the future...\n. :thumbsup:\n.

However, I'm not sure if we should add support for all kinds of trivial sites like this one - it simply embeds videos from Youku.

The plan is to support the old plaintext cookies.txt, Mozilla cookies.splite and Chrome Default/Cookies. I'm not merging this til we're fully done.\n. Implementing Chromium cookies is non-trivial job - the encrypted_value stored in SQLite was encrypted using AES (therefore we need a 3rd party crypto library like pycrypto to handle the algorithmic thing).\nEven more sophisticated, based on this article http://n8henrie.com/2013/11/use-chromes-cookies-for-easier-downloading-with-python-requests/, the encryption methods differ on Linux and OS X (didn't mention Windows).\nForget about Chrome, fair enough to support moz_cookies and cookies.txt only.\n(To my knowledge, not only Firefox, but also some WebKit based browsers such as GNOME Web, makes use of moz_cookies too)\n. :ok_hand: \n. As I started to rethink, #377 is not really a good idea. For many videos on Bilibili, partitions are not necessarily bound together (might be different episodes, like this one) it's problematic to merge all these partitions.\nyou-get should download the exact partition which user requires. For all other partitions, use the -l option to download the whole playlist (and no merging will be carried out).\n. Due to the big size of high-resolution DASH videos, and the audio/video track merging process which relies on FFmpeg, we are not going to make the best quality DASH video as a default for downloading. Instead, users should select whatever they want via the given --itag option.\nHere's a 1080p example (of relatively small size) to test with:\n$ you-get --itag=137 youtu.be/C7xSFmsvflk\nAnd here's a very big one, which has a 4K resolution (3840 x 2160): (it played quite choppy in VLC on my laptop, but whatever...)\n$ you-get -i https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4MWgNsxd_c\n. It takes 2 times user time to finish extracting video info (for deciphering every signature it counters, but not really necessary). This needs to be improved.\n.

Whatever.\np.s. you might want to renew or close some of your open PRs (like #633). The conflicts need to be resolved.\n. Manually merged.\n. Thanks.\nInstead of \"Merge pull request #1 from soimort/develop\", remember to do a rebase against soimort/develop next time.\n. Note that universal.py already parses the page (it comes with some noises, so it's still good to have a domain-specific veoh.py). Instead of adding more and more extractors, you-get should be focusing more on a general solution in the future.\n. By \"general solution\", I mean simply extracting direct links (like exactly what you did in this PR) and (possibly) apply statistical methods to pick up whatever users might want (That's how I imagine the roadmap of you-get 0.4, 0.5, 0.6... goes)\nFor now I don't have plans for supporting more and more mid-sized websites, mainly for two reasons: 1. I don't even visit them and I don't have to download videos from them; 2. Due to the growing size of extractors, I'm not sure if I can maintain such a large repository. So these will eventually be crowdsourced to people, like brew taps & formulas. Feel free to add more extractors to you-get, but be prepared to put them into your repositories someday. That'll be the next big release of you-get (1.0).\nI'm not talking about fullstack DOM simulation right now, but I'm looking into the possibility of using WebEngine / Chromium to scrape web pages, with a PhantomJS like interface together with Pepper API support. It's kind out of scope for you-get (which is just a loose collection of juicy Python scripts), and it requires hardcore programming in C++ and Node. And this will not happen before 2016.\n. cool, thanks.\n. Just a heads up -\n\nDon't risk too much to have every existing video site covered.\n. The problematic site is embedded in a frame\nxml\n<iframe id=\"iframe01\" width=650 height=240 frameborder=0 src=\"http://www.xcmh.cc/out/out.php?key=\u94a2\u4e4b\u70bc\u91d1\u672f\u5e08FA\"></iframe>\nOf course, on you-get we don't need to worry about security issues this way (we're not trying to simulate a browser at this point). However, if a site appears to be phishing, it might not worth us the effort to implement anything for it. (still fine for this one, because the malware is on another domain xcmh.cc which is embedded in the page, not on dilidili.com itself)\n. Nice catch. thanks!\n. Thanks :+1: \n. Thanks!\n. Thanks.\n. Thanks for the pull request.\n1. Could you please rewrite the commit message in English? Doing so may help a lot for anyone grepping the history of the project. A proper msg would be something like: [qq] refactor extractor using VideoExtractor\n2. The new qq.py does not really provide anything interesting. It would be generally better to let it handle multiple formats / streams (because that's what a VideoExtractor is supposed to do).\np.s. the VideoExtractor is expected to fix #763, if possible.\n. The implementation looks good.\nThe copyright restricted videos (which used to be only accessible via the m3u8 method before), as discussed in you-get#463 and youtube-dl#6377, seem no longer to be an issue now. Here are some links to test: (previously not available)\n- http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMTQ3MDcyNTYw.html\n- http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XNTc2NDk2MDMy\nSo, nice job.\nHowever, the code is a bit tangled: import urllib.parse is not needed, and stuff for debugging purpose like pdb should be removed as you commit. The most important thing you forgot is, the code for processing passwords was commented out and never put back, so it will not work for password protected videos. (Test link: http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMzg1ODY1MTIw.html, password: 123).\nI'll do the clean-up later, so no further action is needed on your side.\n. Referer: http://static.youku.com worked fine for me just hours ago -- Now I'm getting 403 errors everywhere, as someone already mentioned in #793.\nurllib.error.HTTPError: HTTP Error 403: Forbidden\nCould this 403 be related to cookies? I suppose having only the referer is not enough.\nUpdate: Seems like a YES. After setting the handler for cookies I haven't met a single 403 error!\n. I can confirm that k.youku.com also requires cookies. And you will eventually get blocked.\n\n. > You can open the k.youku.com url in browser.\nNo, you can't, unless your browser already has its cookies (which is often the case if you have visited the Youku page in your browser before).\nYou should try with your browser's incognito mode, and see if things still work out fine even without any cookies.\n. :+1: \n. Weird naming. :frowning:\npy\n'weibo'      : 'miaopai',\n[...]\n'miaopai'    : 'yixia',\n. In the future, please consider separating different changes (reformatting dict data, add headers support in common.py, add support for FC2 videos) into multiple commits; doing so will help us review and blame changes more easily.\nThanks!\n.

By any chance proxy.uku.im is up again, we'll add it to the wiki page instead.\n. As @zmwangx already pointed out, this PR is not very acceptable.\nI would like to add that:\n1. get_response has been marked as DEPRECATED in the code, so future PRs should really move onto improving / transferring to the recommended method (in this case, get_content). instead of trying to fix a deprecated thing.\n2. For separation of concerns, do not introduce site-specific arguments like youku_url in common.py functions such as get_html(). If we have 10 more sites that we need to handle in the similar way as Youku, the argument list will soon be bloated.\nThanks for the PR, anyway.\n. I'll update this accordingly. Thanks for the fix!\n. :shipit: \nLooks ok to me.\nAs a more proper fix, I would use 'audio_lang' to identify different audio tracks - because we don't know when the duplicated stream_id would exactly occur (the sequence matters in that case).\n. \n```\n$ ./you-get -d \"http://www.miomio.tv/watch/cc251907/\" \nSite:       MioMio.tv\nTitle:      \u30ed\u30f3\u30c9\u30f3\u30cf\u30fc\u30c4\u3000\u52d5\u3051\u308b\u304a\u30c7\u30d6\u5973\u738b\u6c7a\u5b9a\u6226!! - 15 12 08\nType:       Flash video (video/x-flv)\nSize:       314.4 MiB (329667059 Bytes)\nDownloading \u30ed\u30f3\u30c9\u30f3\u30cf\u30fc\u30c4\u3000\u52d5\u3051\u308b\u304a\u30c7\u30d6\u5973\u738b\u6c7a\u5b9a\u6226!! - 15 12 08.flv ...\n  0.2% (  0.8/314.4MB) \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2524[1/1]  317 kB/s^C\n```\n. :+1:\n.

Thanks!\n. Thanks! :+1: \n. Looks good to me. Thanks!\n. 1. I'm not quite sure what this PR achieves. Can you please elaborate this a little bit by attaching a screenshot?\n2. Your solution overflows the bar near the end of the downloading progress. (bar_size should be kept consistent)\n\n. Shrinking 42 to 38 doesn't look good, too.\n42 was chosen because it's the answer given by the following calculation:\nconsole\n100.0% (999.9/999.9MB) \u251c\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2524[99/99] 1000 MB/s\n|0                   24|                                        |0             18|\n24 + 18 = 42.\nOf course it won't fit videos larger than 1GB or that consist of more than 99 pieces, or even net speed faster than 9999MBps. But in practice, 42 is the best number we'd have. :satisfied:\n. Well, I did not expect Letv could have a 3-digit number of pieces (#606 needs to be solved); in that case it all makes sense then.\n(I'll give a try for a few days to ensure it works correctly in all scenarios, thanks)\n. Thanks!\n. I had to revert this (temporarily), as I'm still seeing the overflowing bar everywhere on large-sized videos (> 1GB). \n\nPlease free free to reopen.\n. Will changing 38 simply to a bigger value work for you? (your solution looks better for Letv videos with 100+ pieces, though)\n. I prefer the let-it-crash approach when calling ffmpeg. If things go wrong (i.e. subprocess.call returns non-zero value), users will see the warning and have a chance to fix things on themselves. If you consider these calls to be \"successful\", all downloaded segments will be deleted as a consequence (which might not be a desired behavior).\n. Oh, I didn't realize it was subprocess.check_call instead of subprocess.call (I mistakenly thought you're just removing the indentation here). Iit looks fine.\n. Thanks!\n. @zhangn1985 here launch_player should not be using subprocess.check_call (we don't need to throw any exception when calling external players, I think)\n. \u8c22 Pull Request :+1:

Feel free to merge more PRs like this yourself, whenever you think it's proper.\nA few things to note,\n1. Please still open a pull request to document each change you want to propose, and they may not be merged until Travis says pass;\n2. Do not git push --force under any circumstances.\n. Looks good to me, thanks.\n@cnbeining you may merge this -- if it passes all your testing URLs.\n. :beers: \n. Good idea to just shut it down (looking for that option now). pandoc has email obfuscation already; plus, we didn't leave any maintainer's email address on the site (or should we?)\n. Nailed it, thanks.\np.s. ping me if you'd finish the Chinese translation someday; I may port things from wiki to the main site there (it's more approachable than wiki)\n. Any examples for testing? thanks!\n. Enough. You may use NSFW links as examples, as long as you give a warning in advance.\nThanks for the contribution.\n. Better to separate it out as an individual item, FAQ is not anything about issues, but common problems regarding general usage.\n. I meant something like this:\n- [x] Make sure you have read https://github.com/soimort/you-get/wiki/FAQ before reporting any issue.\n- [ ] The issue is not yet reported on blabla ...\nSadly I doubt whether people are actually reading our ISSUE_TEMPLATE, leave alone all these extra links. (Well, this might the best we could do.)\nPersonally I consider \"having to read the FAQ\" as bad user experience. I must say It's not users' fault, but that Microsoft really needs to fix their DAMNED cmd.exe. Even I myself had a hard time doing testing and packaging for you-get under Windows.\n. > I really cannot stop myself from add up something like\nYou may not do so. Feel free to ignore any issues that are too \"noob\" for you to reply, and I'll handle the rest. (by copy-and-pasting the link to them)\n. :shipit: \n. No offense, but this site seems totally cr*p for me.\n\nDoes anyone really need to download videos from a site like this?\n. A quick question: do you need this yourself?\nI've added a bunch of unpopular sites which I needed my own, that's fine because I use them on weekly/daily basis, so they are more likely to be properly maintained (by me). If you need to visit this site regularly, then it's fine, too, because it's guaranteed to be maintained (by you). However, if you don't even need this yourself, it's very questionable whether we should spend more time on this.\n(I really need GitHub to have polls, so we can vote on a new site to implement; if many people request the same thing here, we may prioritize it rather than wasting time on something nobody needs)\nFor now, if anyone needs this site, please reply this thread so I know it's worthwhile.\n. Taps are the best solution to this, I think.\nI understand that different people have different needs, but we (as contributors) have very limited time to keep up with all these changing sites. So if we are to add something new, we must be able to devote some time to maintain them in the future. From my experience, if you try to implement an extractor for every site you randomly see on the Internet, that WILL exhaust your valuable time!\nOh, don't take this the wrong way, but the more is not the better.\n. > I will look into it myself, but I would appreciate help from your side\n\nsince you are more familiar with the structure of the code.\n\nThe current structure of codebase is a mess: mixture of OOP and non-OOP (legacy) code, inconsistent coding style, quick hacks and patches merged without much thought.\n(Surely I'm the one responsible for this, but \"just getting things done asap\" was my philosophy for this project. As long as it can download something, it's good)\nI won't have much time to clean up the code at this moment, but if you find an existing extractor is broken, feel free to fix it, I'd be thankful for that - that would be our No.1 priority!\n. ...but don't depend on external libraries.\n. Firstly, thanks for the pull request.\nA rough review:\nYour implementation of huaban_download_board() perfectly ignored the current structure of you-get - it has its own version of progress bar, own file handling, own stdout printing/logging, and even own KeyboardInterrupt exception catching (why?).\nThe code is not wrong - but as it differs quite a lot from you-get's coding style, it will make itself extremely hard to maintain. If we improve any high-level routine in common,py, the code here will not benefit from our changes much, or even risk to break (e.g. it relies on some low-level API like url_save, which is not supposed to be used by extractors directly).\nEspecially, if you want to propose an enhancement to the current progress bar, or anything else that could be shared among all extractors, please consider doing a patch on common.py, instead of putting them all together specific to one site, isolated.\n. > For the progress bar, I wish its animation is based on the count of pieces of files rather than the size, \n\nbecause it isn't worth to make hundreds of connections to check the images' size of a \"board\".\n\nThat is a very good point, and that's why I prefer you to make those changes in common.py, rather than do it in your own huaban.py.\ndownload_urls does support only one extension, and you're also right, that the default naming scheme is based on the number of pieces (starting from 0). I haven't tested your PR on a real machine yet, but I guess you could just call download_urls as many times as want; doing that won't look very nice, though.\nOr, if you can abstract some of these functionalities as common routines, put them into a common place (common.py) so later implemented extractors can benefit from them.\n\nLastly, it seems I misunderstood the exception handling strategy in youku.py\n\nOh, forgot to say, but the KeyboardInterrupt in youku.py is used to skip a certain video when downloading a playlist (so if you have a video you don't like, Ctrl-C will let you skip it, instead of terminating the whole downloading process)\n. Actually I prefer the progress bar (probably other things also) to be fixed in common.py. For now, removing EnhancedPiecesProgressBarand simply making use of download_urls() will do the job.\nI don't have time to refactor this part of common.py, so let's keep things simple that if I want to rewrite the whole codebase someway, simpler extractors would be easier to improve, i.e., the shorter, the better.\n(Tip: it's completely up to you whether you would intend to change that, since you can always keep it as your own fork of you-get.)\nMaking hundreds of HEAD requests to check for all pieces' sizes, as you said, is inefficient for image downloading. The cause is, you-get was designed to be a video downloader (normally there won't be too many pieces for a video), so handling images wasn't my concern at the very beginning. Certainly, we have extended its scope to image downloading now.\n. Looks good. Could you please rebase this branch?\n. Normally rebase is used before merging, since it rewrites all your commits you made ahead of the base branch, in this case, soimort/develop.\nI can still merge your commits without rebasing; but it'd be better to make sure we have a tidy \"linear\" history, and that your PR will end up with a nicer look (purple \"Merged\" sign instead of a red \"Closed\" sign)\nPlease post your git branch -va before I can tell what the problem is.\n. This one is out-of-date with the base branch: (on the upstream)\nremotes/upstream/develop  2a80fb5 Merge branch 'zhangn1985-for-up' into develop (fix #906)\nUnfortunately commit https://github.com/soimort/you-get/commit/b35a0bd9f92a6298f58bb5281ba2bfd541d04e1e (which has been pushed to upstream after your last commit) changed src/you_get/extractors/__init__.py, so you might have some conflicts to resolve. It's very easy, though.\n. GitHub still shows me \"This branch is out-of-date with the base branch\", but it's good to merge now. Thanks!\n(it's ok to force push to a temporarily branch, but you might want to use something other than develop next time)\n. > I found two commits between mine and your merging commit, seems they are added after my rebasing, maybe that is the reason?\nSince there's no more conflict, it should not stand out-of-date anymore. If that reason is true, then whenever someone pushes some new commits to the upstream, every existing unmerged Pull Request should've been rendered outdated. That's obviously not the case. I don't know what GitHub's mechanism is; maybe they just don't bother rechecking a PR again even if it's updated.\n\nAnd thanks for the suggestion and your patience.\n\nAnd you're welcome.:+1:\n. > I found two commits between mine and your merging commit, seems they are added after my rebasing, maybe that is the reason?\nSince there's no more conflict, it should not stand out-of-date anymore.

Too many test cases will slow down our code integration with Travis and increase the probability of temporary failure (due to inaccessible servers or network status), that's why I haven't added more tests throughout years, in spite of our growing number of extractors.\nAlso, from my experience, extractors break down from time to time. If we can't fix any broken extractor immediately, then the whole status will be shown as \"Failed\", which would render our Travis tests for PR/commits useless, until we fix that specific site. Since Travis CI is mainly used for guaranteeing the PRs actually run (across various Python 3.x versions), it's actually wiser not to do intensive tests on extractors. A small number for commonly-used sites (e.g. YouTube) would suffice.\n.

The code itself is ok, but I'm skeptical about the reliability of using 3rd party services (especially, when they are random selected).\nWhat if the auto-selected proxy is malicious, or just behaves strangely without forwarding data correctly? We have no guarantee about this, and  I don't want to mislead users to think that this is a you-get issue.\n. Sorry for the late response.\n\nIn the current implementation, the proxy isn't working for around 30% of the time. This is still much better than picking proxies on my own\n\nTrue. I don't know anything about ProxyNova, how it operates and provides these free proxy services, but I can imagine that they are not as reliable as you may think. It claims to enable anonymity, but you could achieve the same thing via Tor as well. Instead of that we pick an arbitrary proxy for users, they must be aware of the transparency and the risk (there's very little risk if you're only going to download videos though) of using it -- and if they really do, they would just pick their own. Thus I'm reluctant to let you-get do this for users.\nAs for now, \"picking a freely available proxy\" was never my intent; I want to use just my own proxy, so it's not really a priority for me.\n\n...and stop using it if the result doesn't look reasonable. We may try a couple of proxies in parallel first, and then pick a random one only from the ones that are known to work\n\nHow? IMHO we should not handle that level of complexity, for this simple command-line tool that uses regexp to scrape the web. We are not going to make it a fault-tolerant, server middleware anyway.\nAs a follow-up on the technical side: BeautifulSoup is cool, but we are not going to introduce any external dependency to this simple tool at this stage.\n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n.

Not sure if we can extend our set of extractors too far beyond the current scope. Plus, all of them seem trivial in implementation, so we should instead improve ouruniversal.pyorembed.py` (I can see that eastmoney.com hosts their videos on http://www.kankanews.com/, so why do we need a separate extractor for that?)\n. I suppose @cnbeining  is ok with this.\nThanks for the fix.\n. Looks good :+1: . Thanks!\n. Makes sense :+1: \n. IMHO this isn't necessary at all...\nPreferably improving universal.py to make it recognize <meta name=\"title\" content=\"([^\"]*)\" or things like that. Using HTML <meta> tag to indicate the title of a page is an informal convention shared by many sites. (though a wrong convention)\n. Inferred from the parameter, with arange= you get partial ranges; without it you get the whole thing. Apparent naming.\n(Just saying; didn't test. Merge this if it works for you.)\n. > For some links (like the one I provided) MGTV would send this tiny little thing at the end of the URL to make it like a preview.\nLOL.\nI wish Youku was implemented that way.\n. Thanks!\n. This seems a bit hacky to me, especially that it requires all requests to be completed in 10s (before next retry takes place). There are sites known to suffer from extremely slow connections while accessing from overseas, e.g., mgtv.com, tudou.com and yinyuetai.com; and given a timeout of merely 10s, I wonder if they would ever respond. (while allowing a longer timeout might make it possible; but we certainly don't know what the proper timeout value is)\n. 600 sec is a reasonable timeout, it leaves sufficient time for a laggy connection to be set. Still, I would prefer this to be implemented as a user option (as in youtube-dl) rather than a hard-coded value.\n. :+1: \n. #1093 is a regression issue caused by #1019.\nThis PR will extract video segments in the following order:\n2, 3, ... n, 1\nSimply reverting #1019 will yield only:\n2\nBut I don't know which is the preferable behavior for most users.

Thanks for your contribution, but I wonder why it is worth spending so much effort on coloring output; that's not even the focus of this project. More importantly: too many rich colors will sometimes make the text hard to read, since different users may have quite different terminal backgrounds. A set of colors that looks good on dark background may look unreadable on light background, et vice versa.  That's why I'm conservative on this.\nAlso, please: No Chinese in the source code. All comments should be written in simple, easy-to-read English. (unless it's a proper noun refers to non-English name, e.g. \u4f18\u9177)\nFurthermore, if you have doubts about some pieces of code, or if you think something in the existing code might have a mistake, such like:\ndiff\n+#\u6055\u6211\u611a\u6627\uff0c\u770b\u4e0d\u61c2\u4e0a\u9762\u7684\u8bed\u53e5\uff0c\u6781\u5ea6\u6000\u7591\u662f\uff1a\n+sys.path.insert(1, _filepath)\n+sys.path.insert(1, _srcdir)\nPlease always open an issue to ask us first (for example #1135) or a separate PR to explain why this should be changed, instead of inserting these questioning words in the source code and sending them as a pull request. We can't merge these things.\n. (TL;DR just read the last two paragraphs.)\n\nFirst, plain text are ugly especially in cmd of my windows\n\nFair enough, and I know it looks ugly on Windows' cmd, because I had to package this software and test it on a Windows box from time to time. But essentially, everything looks ugly on cmd.\n\nWe can pre-establish all kind of Theme,such as all-blank-theame to solve it.\n\nTheming is beyond the current scope of this project. Personally I like your idea of implementing themes (I have other open-source project that involves some form of theming, e.g. translate-shell), but I would rather not to do it in you-get prematurely.\n\nBut I understand that you get bored with too much code,even there is only 4 api\n\nMore code means we are obliged to maintain them. So it's not just about the API.\nMaking a one-time, big patch is easy for any trained programmer to do, but no one can guarantee they are perfect in the first place, and chasing bugs caused by someone else's code is not really a nice experience. You'll understand it someday: Simplicity of maintenance is much, much more important than just adding fancy, unnecessary stuff infinitely.\n\nactually, \"but I wonder why it is worth spending so much effort on coloring output; that's not even the focus of this project.\" irritate me.\n\nI'm sorry if it irritated you, but let me stress this advice again: (also to future contributors) If you wish to make a significant change to the project (perhaps to any well-known open-source project), always ask the maintainers and discuss about it first. If you know what kind of changes should be allowed, you won't feel bad after spending a lot of time, only working on something the project owner doesn't want.\n\nI don't know what is the project focus on\n\nThis project mainly focuses on pulling videos (sometimes other interesting stuff) from the web, I assume you already knew that. If you can pick one of existing issues and fix that, you're more than welcome! (we have a hell lot of extractors broken at this moment)\nActually I would suggest you to publish your code here on PyPI as an individual library, so anyone who wants to use these coloring functions in their project can add your library as a dependency. That could benefit the whole Python community, and we are free of the overhead to maintain them in you-get. What do you think?\n\nAnyway ,It's Your Code, you can do anything.But Do NOT behave as there is a team to Supply Support ,Please.\n\nYes, it is our code (all 70 contributors'), although I wrote the most part and have the final say (simply because I own this repository). And you're also right, there is no team to supply support, because nobody is getting paid to do that. Everyone (even myself) is volunteering their free time to contribute to this project.\n\nOnly you have ssh-key didnt you?\n\nThen I'm not sure what that means. Technically everyone has \"an SSH-key\" on GitHub.\nIf you mean \"write access\", then Top 3 contributors on the list are all project collaborators who can push to this repository. They helped me a lot on explaining things, fixing issues I'm not able (or don't care) to fix, reviewing other peoples' Pull Requests and merging commits by their own judgment. Please, DO NOT ignore them.\n\nI understand that it is bitter to get your first Pull Request rejected, but this is just how things work (in open source). I have code that I've written then thrown away myself (because they're too complicated, unnecessary, I have no intent to maintain...), so it's not really a big deal, and there's no point to overreact on the denial of a pull request at all.\nAgain, thank you for taking your time. You're very welcome if you want to start by contributing something small (which doesn't take you too much time, but still helpful to everyone). And I hope our words didn't hurt your feelings anyway. We are harsh sometimes, that's because we want to keep the right things on track.\nCheers!\n. The best approach is to group all options in a list for adding to OptionParser, as well as for generating all kinds of shell completion files in-tree (from the source).\n(needs some refactoring in common.py, besides we'll have to get rid of getopt someday, anyway.)\nFor the moment manually-written definitions are ok. Thanks for the contribution!\n. Looks good :+1: \nWould you mind amending the commit message to make it a more meaningful one?\n. Thanks for the contribution!\n. Thanks.\nI'm leaving https://github.com/soimort/you-get/issues/1211 open for a while, in case someone finds the best solution.\n. An adaptation of https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/pull/9287 should be preferable, but depending on PySocks looks fine to me in this case. (for its usefulness in resolving #1046 )\nThanks!\n. FFmpeg can dump an M3U8 URL to a local file\n$ ffmpeg -i http://live.schou.me/fish.m3u8 -t 20 -c copy -bsf:a aac_adtstoasc output.mp4\n...but certainly it's my responsibility to implement that common part.\n. @cnbeining I thought you've made ffmpeg handle the M3U8 from iQIYI (#1237), but why am I still getting a raw M3U8 file?\n```\n[\u2665] you-get  develop  ./you-get -d \"http://www.iqiyi.com/v_19rrli054g.html#vfrm=8-8-0-1\"\n[DEBUG] get_content: http://cache.m.iqiyi.com/tmts/502278300/b3336c7d61bd0585da883066f3ca978e/?t=1467380541199&sc=cef4d843c1775b7bd5bc768e2446820a&src=76f90cbd92f94a2e925d83e8ccd22cb7\nsite:                \u7231\u5947\u827a (Iqiyi)\ntitle:               2016\u6e29\u7f51\u81ea\u5236HL\u00a0\u00a0\u79d1\u8d1d\u5c14VS\u7f57\u5e03\u68ee \u81ea\u5236HL\nstream:\n    - format:        TD\n      container:     m3u8\n      video-profile: 720p\n      size:          0.0 MiB (0 bytes)\n    # download-with: you-get --format=TD [URL]\nDownloading 2016\u6e29\u7f51\u81ea\u5236HL\u00a0\u00a0\u79d1\u8d1d\u5c14VS\u7f57\u5e03\u68ee \u81ea\u5236HL.m3u8 ...\n 100% (  0.0/  0.0MB) \u251c\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2524[1/1]    2 kB/s\n``\n. Oh, forget what I just said. iQIYI was implemented inVideoExtractor`, which makes it harder to bypass the prescribed downloading workflow.\n. Rebase this PR on @zhangn1985's #1236 and let it handle the M3U8 thing, so we can at least see how well it works.\n. > My local head is from cnbeining/you-get ...\nAssume you're on ffmpeg-live branch, I think this should work:\n$ git checkout -b zhangn1985-fix-iqiyi ffmpeg-live\n$ git pull https://github.com/zhangn1985/you-get.git fix-iqiyi\n. #1236 has been merged, so there're some conflicts need to be resolved. (on your iqiyi.py)\n. My system just fucked up today and I have not tested anything yet. Plus, iqiyi.com is still giving me timeout as often.\nI assume you've had enough time to test this PR yourself, so we're good.\n. Cool.

Thanks! :+1: \n. Non-video-service websites should be preferably handled by embed.py.\nwww.freebuf.com doesn't host anything interesting -- they're simply embedding videos from other sites. There are too many websites like this on the Internet, we can't maintain so many extractors for every of them -- and these could be fragile to changes.\nThanks, anyway.\n. Plus, if a website seems to go down very easily, it's not worth it, IMHO.\n\n. The iqiyi.py part looks good to me. So please split unrelated changes into different PRs (in the future), so that we can review and merge on an individual basis.\nAlso, the commits need to be squashed.\n. Thanks again!\n. Looks good. Thanks :+1: \n. \ud83d\udc4d Thanks\n. Any sample URL that leads to a 403 error?\n. May I ask what problem does it solve?\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. If you could take some time to look into some existing issues (that you implemented the extractor which I'm not able to fix), e.g., #1304, #1346, that would be great.\n. > @soimort I've been extremely busy these days. I will look into those issues later.\nJust saying. Fixing existing issues should always be prioritized, since there are users in need of them.\n. 1. There are a lot of unused code around (parse_srt_p, parse_srt_xml: why left unimplemented?).\n2. For old code that handles \"qqvideo\", \"sina\", \"youku\", \"tudou\" or alike: Do we still need them?\n. It seems I'm the one to blame. Nevermind, I will remove those legacy code once again (they originated from youku-lixian about 4 years ago, but never got used since then). It's time to finally get rid of them.\n. Thanks for the pull request. Could you please give some more explanation on this PR? (e.g. What problem does it fix? Any URLs for testing, if applicable?)\n. Looks good :+1:. Please do separate commits for different changes in the future; also remember to rebase your branch.\n. Looks good, thanks \ud83d\udc4d \n. Any links for testing? Thanks.\n. :+1:\n. Looks good, thanks \ud83d\udc4d \n. Please fix the syntax error and make sure this works on your local machine.\n. Looks good. Thanks for the fix!\n\n.

Give up.\nIt would vary from proxy to proxy (ProxyBasicAuthHandler vs. ProxyDigestAuthHandler), so it's more non-trivial to implement than I thought.. Drat, no wonder I  can't get ProxyDigestAuthHandler to work with squid. It's a bug of Python: (And it was there for 4 yrs)\nhttps://bugs.python.org/issue16095. After some packet capturing, I found that basic auth is implied even without a ProxyBasicAuthHandler (although not well-documented anywhere in Python's docs). If your proxy supports basic authentication, then -x username:password@host:port should just work.\nSo this PR is perfectly useless\ud83d\udca9. . Awesome work.. :+1:.

Thanks for the PR, but for now this seems like a dead website:\n$ ping songtasty.com \nping: songtasty.com: No address associated with hostname. It doesn't look like it'll be back\n\n. Note that you-get already works on this kind of websites even without this patch (as implemented by universal.py).. Tests passed. . Thanks for the PR! :+1: . Thanks!. I believe the issue has nothing to do with \\t.\nTry adding --debug option and see what the actual exception is.. Is your E: on FAT32 or exFAT? The character \\t should be well supported by NTFS, by specification.\nIf so, we'd better add it to legitimize in util.fs as a general solution instead.. I was able to reproduce the exception on a mounted FAT disk, but not on NTFS : (\nThe issue should be fixed now. Thanks for reporting this.. Thanks! :+1: . Thanks! :+1: . Nice. Thanks! :+1: . Nice. Thanks! :+1: . Thanks :+1: . Could you please provide the URL of a sample video?\nAlso, it would be a good idea to squash all your commits into one.. You may use git reset --soft HEAD~3 and commit again. Or you can just create a new PR if you prefer.. :ok_hand: . :+1: . :+1: . Nice. Thanks!. Thanks :+1: . :+1: . Thanks :+1: . Nice. Thanks :+1: . :ok_hand: . Disabling certificate verification globally would be a backward move in terms of security (on Python 3.4 and above), since it brings in potential vulnerability when users pass cookies or passwords over HTTPS -- they won't be secure anymore.\nI understand that sometimes people want to have untrusted certificates for obscure reasons (like bypassing firewalls via HTTP proxies); but a more proper solution is to make that optional (with some option like --no-check-certificate).. :+1: . If I recall correctly, sometimes YouTube can fail to provide a corresponding Vorbis audio track to pair with its video track when getting a DASH stream with WebM format (#2168). This usually happens when a video is relatively newly uploaded onto YouTube. That's why we still need to enforce the audio re-encoding into vorbis as an AAC audio is used instead. The same goes for MP4 format.\nI agree that audio re-encoding isn't very useful when it's already in the right format. Better if re-encoding is only enforced when necessary, and in other cases we may just use copy.\nAs for -strict experimental, I'd rather keep it since it works for any version of ffmpeg. Removing it will break compatibility with pre-2015 ffmpeg on older systems, but won't do any good.. Looks good. Thanks!. Looks good. Thanks!. \n. Test has passed. What's the problem?\nhttps://travis-ci.org/soimort/you-get/jobs/494225765#L466. Travis CI showed no error and downloaded the video successfully, as can be seen in the log. Works on my own machine as well.\nPlease make sure the version you have installed in /usr/lib/python3.7/site-packages/you_get is an updated one. You can confirm so by looking at /usr/lib/python3.7/site-packages/you_get/version.py.. I don't know what causes the issue since I can't reproduce it. It seems the CDN server just fails to return a proper content-type on your side.\nYou can see if the latest commit in develop fixes this. Otherwise, \n1. Try using a proxy located in another region.\n2. Try the work-in-progress refactoring-bilibili branch.. @yunqingan\nRead the comments above.. > However, will it create issue as the origin video is in flv?\nWell, the original's in FLV indeed. Most media players should have no problem at all dealing with incorrect extensions, but it will be changed to FLV in the refactoring branch.\n\nHopefully it supports 1080P+ and 1080P60 as well.\n\nIt seems they're available to paid members only, while I am not. You may try with --cookies, but I can't be sure if will work.\nClosing since it's fixed.. @simonfire007 You need to pass the HTTP referer to the player. This can't be implemented in you-get since the required argument varies for different players. For mpv it's\n$ you-get -p \"mpv --http-header-fields='Referer: https://www.bilibili.com/video/av44429269'\" https://www.bilibili.com/video/av44429269\nI don't know about vlc though.. Merged. Thanks!. Thanks!. :confused:  Personally I don't prefer short-circuiting like this, it sometimes makes code a little harder to understand\n. Have you actually run this part of code? It's an IndentationError here.\n. Should pass info_only=info_only here (I've fixed it for you)\n. What difference does it make? It seems they are identical files.\n. 1. get_html is deprecated; we prefer to use get_content in future improvements.\n2. Better style to encode the extra parameter yxon in the dict for q, instead of inserting as a string.\n. So url_info requires fake_headers?\nI prefer not to have bunch of fake headers in individual extractors, only the minimal field(s) that just works would be sufficient. Will see if this doesn't break anything.\n. For me now, it's no good to risk introducing breaking changes to common.py.\n1. I always wanted to rewrite the whole networking routines from scratch, having already get_response, get_html, get_decoded_html, get_content, get_head, url_locations, url_save, url_save_chunked, ... are a hell of a lot of chaos.\n2. If you want to propose changes to those, common.py will end up even more unmaintainable.\n3. I forgot what I just wanted to say, but don't be stressed about this; we're not in a hurry to implement custom headers, for this specific site, Things will become better when I find time to do 1.\n. Ok, I think I just figured this out:\nk != -1 could happen when the rest of video pieces are behind a paywall (VIP-only), we should just break here, instead of throwing an error, otherwise it would make such videos not downloadable at all (as in #996).\nHowever, I'm not sure if changing this would fix #996 completely. It seems that the play.youku.com API still returns \"key\":-1 even if users passed their own cookies. (though I'm NOT able to confirm this myself)\n. So now you can git rm iqiyi_sc.py\n. The Unicode literal syntax isn't available until 3.3, and it failed Travis. Just drop it.\n. If you press Ctrl-C during the ffmpeg demux process (MPEG-4), most likely all you get is a corrupted file. (I guess)\n. The room URL could contain dashes, so \\w is not enough.\n. Again, do not change the permission of source files if you don't have to.\n. Don't use any fixed version number (i.e. 0.4.486). Actually, these two links seem unnecessary, since the command choco install you-get has covered everything a user should need.\n. Well, I need to reorder the Installation section anyway. The Mac-only Homebrew option comes last, so preferably the Windows-only option is placed more closer to that.\n. What will happen if matchall(content,letv_embed_patterns) is None?\n. Although the return type of matchall can't be None (by definition), it would be better to make that bulletproof (just like all other matching patterns here).\n. What does this do?\n. VideoExtractor already takes care of json_output, it seems. So I need more information on this change.\n. If 'json_output' not in kwargs, trying to evaluate not kwargs['json_output'] will raise an exception.\nSo this bool expression doesn't literally make sense.\n@cnbeining Is it possible that url_info could take a long time so this PR is trying to get rid of that when retrieving the --json output?\n. Use params[key] is not None.\n\nComparisons to singletons like None should always be done with is or is not , never the equality operators.\n\n-- PEP-8\n. should be info_only=info_only\n. should be info_only=info_only\n. What does this commit do?\ud83e\udd14. What's the point of using a while loop?\nThe logic here is to skip netease_download_common when url_best is not valid. So why not\npy\nif url_best is None:\n    netease_download_common(title, url_best, output_dir=output_dir, info_only=info_only)\nor even\npy\ntry:\n    netease_download_common(title, url_best, output_dir=output_dir, info_only=info_only). For aesthetic reasons, better set percent_str to 100 too. (instead of the string \"100.0\")\npy\npercent_str = percent = 100. There is one more leak issue though: If the size of downloaded pieces already rounds to 100.0% while the download is not finished (self.received < self.total_size), the string 100.0% still emerges.\nExample: you-get --itag=22 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5j_lVn8Z9yA\n(Notice that 55836672 / 55844492 => 100.0%). The problem persists. You may change the condition to \nif round(self.received * 100 / self.total_size, 1) == 100:\nor alike.. To clarify, this is what it yields on this video:\n\nString 100.0% is still there, because the download has not completed yet.\n(Only videos with specific sizes are affected by this regression. The aforementioned one has changed the size and no longer reflects the issue though.). Be careful not to duplicate the keyword argument stream_id here. (it's already in extra). This will get a wrong string if page title contains the \"]\" character. A better solution is to match the whole __INITIAL_STATE__.. You may want to restrict this to domain space.bilibili.com (or alike)\nOtherwise when using -l to download a regular video (https://www.bilibili.com/video/....) it will be captured by download_video_from_totallist and raises an error..

Thanks, will do.\n. That would means simulating web browser and probably running JavaScripts in\nthe page, not to mention Flash. As we can see only limited support of\nHTML5, it could be challenging to do some simple grab-and-go.\nSince YouTube-dl is having even more extractors, I suppose we can focus on\nfinishing mid-size websites in China and Japan.\nAnd it would be great if we can have something for popular players, like\nJWPlayer. Other than that I am not noticing a lot of similar logics.\n2015\u5e7410\u670822\u65e5\u661f\u671f\u56db\uff0cMort Yao notifications@github.com \u5199\u9053\uff1a\n\nNote that universal.py already parses the page (it comes with some\nnoises, so it's still good to have a domain-specific veoh.py). Instead of\nadding more and more extractors, you-get should be focusing more on a\ngeneral solution in the future.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/soimort/you-get/pull/729#issuecomment-150210346.\n. Great job.\n\nThank you so much for your brilliant work.\nTo make future works easier, I would suggest the format of VideoExtractor to be set before the release. Although hard, I am hoping the this would reduce(or even eliminate, which would be better) the chance of disruption between versions and forks.\nAs  common.py being updated as b277d8d , I am thinking it is time to reconsider #441 regarding of solving the problem of the need of rapid change and PRs coming to several websites(which I myself do not care about either) so individual developers can just maintain their taps on their own instead of raising PR every several days, also reduce the workload of maintainers without giving out too many push accesses in case of potential chaos or incorrect using of Git or Github. \nFor the next few weeks my personal goal is trying to close as many issues as I can since most sites are quite stable, also try to catch up with commercial extractors.\nMay we make a difference. \n. These days no one really cares what the heck does those 3rd ad parties would do.\n\nAt least with you-get we can somehow keep the end users from this kind of risk. In a way. More or less.\n.

If you need to visit this site regularly, then\nit's fine, too, because it's guaranteed to be maintained (by you). However,\nif you don't even need this yourself, it's very questionable whether we\nshould spend more time on this.\n(I really need GitHub to have polls, so we can vote on a new site to\nimplement; if many people request the same thing here, we may prioritize it\nrather than wasting time on something nobody needs)\nFor now, if anyone need this site, please reply this thread so I know it's\nworthwhile.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/soimort/you-get/pull/963#issuecomment-193431987.\n.

So if we are to add something new, we must be able to devote some\ntime to maintain them in the future. From my experience, if you try to\nimplement an extractor for every site you randomly see on the Internet,\nthat WILL exhaust your valuable time!\nOh, don't take this the wrong way, but the more is not the better.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/soimort/you-get/pull/963#issuecomment-193435992.\n.

Hi there,\nThanks for your PR.\nIt is always a pain to bypass the geographic restrictions outside China. That's a very good observation.\nThe only point I am not 100% sure is whether it is stable enough to build in a 3rd party service to achieve some core functions. \n@soimort What's your opinion?\nYours,\nBeining\n. It could be risky to pass the login credentials via a random service provided by god-knows-who. I cannot see any good scenario that a well-awarded user would need this function; also I am concerning about the mortality burden of providing risky service to end-users.\nBTW BS4 is good: but from my point of view I cannot see the necessarily of adding this as our dependency.\n. http://pl.youku.com/partner/m3u8?ctype=85&oip=1&type=hd3&vid=CMzQyMjc0NA==\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u53ef\u771f\u6ca1\u60f3\u5230\u5440\u3002\n.

Hi,\nIt seems that you are trying to implement 2 major refractions in one commit.

I will probably abandon this PR since this fix is within your PR. Let's move the discussion under your PR.. Thanks for you PR!. Hi,\nThanks for your PR.\nCan you kindly rebase all the commits into 1 or 2 commits? \nThanks,. It turns out that I have to use this header to make it work: the built-in one won't work.\nSo I really hate this PR for this involves so many changes. Making things hard to test.\nShould I open an issue to talk through about this major change of common.py?\n. Nice move.\nI will withdraw this PR until further changes.\nThanks for your work.\n. As long as you do not press that multiple times, the file should be good.......I guess.\n. Why should VideoExtractor import this? Didn't the father VideoExtractor object fix the problem?\n. @wwqgtxx We are not complaining about this PR: we are talking about a potential bug deeply hiding within EVERY VideoExtractor . If that is the case, we'd better fix it for it could be critical. Otherwise, can you kindly explain why you are trying to do this hacking? What unexpected behaviour are you having? \nMany thanks.\n. I don't think so.\nAs I can remember MGTV's video URL is only one for each resolution(total resolution is 3 for most of the cases), backed by ChinaNet(WS): If the url_info fails, I can hardly imagine that the video can be downloaded by any chance.\n. I talked to the author: He DOES NOT want to get the information of every segment to reduce time. This is not what WE want here...\n. ",

Yes,the k.youku.com also requires cookies.Use browser's incognito mode,it indeed give back 403 Error to me.\n. I think this is not a mature method.This will confuse some users when the request can't return cookies and throw out HTTP 403 forbidden error.And a cookie manager would be better.The feature of cookie manager would be:\n- save the cookies for later use.\n- renew the cookies when cookies expire.\nWe can reproduce  this error from this command.\ncurl -i 'http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XNDQzNTIyMDQ0.html?from=y1.6-100.3.1.a7c275ecd7b411e1a19e' |less\nWhen there are Age: 0 and X-Cache: Miss from x.v.qd in return header.The cookies will be returned.If we run this command some times.There will aren't cookies returned.Only if the age reach to max-age=900.\n.

So is there any way for you-get download module to do something like this?\n.

Based on my rough observation, this is not the case for icourses.cn. It has a conventional Content-Length :)\n\nWell, if you try to use wget curl or something to download the video, you'll notice the server hang up (kill) the connection by force when you download approx. 15MB of data. A workaround in #1478 add some special functions to url_save_chunked (reason why is thaturl_save is used by almost every other sites, so it may break everything if I modified that) to dynamically update URLs when downloaded chunk reaches 15 MB\n\nIt has a conventional Content-Length :)\n\nYes and no, when you change the URL to try to seek the stream, you'll notice the Content-Length no longer rational.

Sorry, I'm afraid I can't help here because I'm not personally familiar withurllib(I always letrequests` do the heavylifting for me), and I didn't have much time to mess around. There are two things I'm positively sure about though:\n1. As your PR currently stands, extractor proxy is ignored;\n2. Your proposed workaround of adding a referer header and persisting the cookie does work.\nClaim 1 was confirmed by looking at the response in pdb. Claim 2 was confirmed by delegating to curl as a temporary workaround (yeah I was a bit pissed with all the complications here...) By the way, here's the curl proof-of-concept I'm referring to: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/d97766e46b40cd18cc77#file-common-py-L267-L285.\n. > Actually it would be desirable if users can use these interactive keys as an expected behavior, since they're standard to ffmpeg.\nOne concern would be lack of consistency, since ffmpeg_download_stream, for instance, connects FFmpeg's stdin to a pipe (so that the program could use the q command to stop recording). But allowing interactive commands in debug mode seems like a reasonable middle ground. I pushed an update.. Actually, the existing login API should still work; I just realized the problem was that it didn't percent encode my password.\nAnyway, it doesn't really hurt to upgrade to the current login API used by https://account.nicovideo.jp/login.. For some stupid reason I accidentally based this on my develop branch... Closing in favor of #1715.. Not sure what you mean. This is just a warning, essentially telling the user \"look, there are this many segments we can't do anything about\". All intermediate URLs are useless without keys.. 1. It's rather pointless to echo user input. Echoing back the URL is at best slightly more clear when users are downloading multiple videos, but even then due to the sequential nature of you-get, it's extremely easy to know exactly which URL the warning applies to.\nNote that currently error messages don't contain original URLs either. Not following conventions makes the (frankly already quite inconsistent, due to its nature) project inconsistent.\n\n\n\n\nUsers should not be informed with segments.\n\nUsers are already exposed to the total number of segments (that are not skipped) and the segment currently being downloaded in the progress bar. So this assertion has no ground.\n\nNumber of segments skipped does not help the user.\n\nAs a user myself, it totally helps. When a video claimed to be 1GB (in fact, that number isn't available across the board, or it could be a wrong number) ended up with only 3 segments totally 100MB, knowing that 27 segments were skipped due to paywall instantly makes the situation clear, and helps estimate how much I'm missing out.. > You mean the patch does not try to inform users which url has not been downloaded completely\n\n\nAgain, this is obvious from context.. Sure, plenty of examples can be found on vip.youku.com. Just find a VIP-only episode of a TV show, e.g.,\n```\n$ you-get --debug https://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMjY0Mzk0Mzk2MA==.html\n[DEBUG] get_content: http://play.youku.com/play/get.json?vid=XMjY0Mzk0Mzk2MA==&ct=10\n[DEBUG] get_content: http://play.youku.com/play/get.json?vid=XMjY0Mzk0Mzk2MA==&ct=12\nyou-get: Skipping 24 out of 24 segments due to paywall\nsite:                \u4f18\u9177 (Youku)\ntitle:               \u70ed\u8840\u957f\u5b89 \u7b2c\u4e00\u5b63 24 \u5343\u5e74\u592a\u5c81\nstream:\n    - format:        hd3\n      container:     flv\n      video-profile: 1080P\n      size:          1209.7 MiB (1268423229 bytes)\n    # download-with: you-get --format=hd3 [URL]\naudio-languages:\n    - lang:          \u56fd\u8bed\n      download-url:  http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMjY0Mzk0Mzk2MA==\nyou-get: [Failed] Cannot extract video source.\n``. Thanks, fixed.. By the way, checking membership ofNoneis perfectly fine. (1) An empty sequence or set type is vastly different fromNone; (2)inis a membership test operator; it doesn't test subset/subsequence. (Of course, I'm talking about its original use;containscan be implemented however you like,strbeing a good example.). Just realized this only fixes--info,--urland--json; actually downloading the URLs result in HTTP 466. It is not immediately obvious to me how to fix that part; I know that downloading fromtx.acgvideo.comnow requires a valid user agent in addition to referer, but the URLs extracted by you-get can't be downloaded either way. I'll look into it later.\n  . Closing this since #2555 should work.. You appear to be overriding all other installed openers here, including proxy settings. Don't do that! Adding a header is enough.\n. Not sure if we need to maintain Python 3.2 compatibility. If not, this compat block can be removed.. Here is the dual-call bug I was talking about. I didn't read surrounding code but it's safe to assume thatsubprocess.call(params)` shouldn't be called twice in immediate succession.. ",

    "wenLiangcan": "There are two reasons make me feel hard to fit the download process of Huaban into the workflow provided by common.py.\nFirst, there maybe multiple types of images in one \"board\". download_urls accepts only one extension name for a whole stream, and also print_info.\nThe second one is new images will be added into a \"board\". I want to continuously download images from a \"board\", but the default naming scheme is based on current number of files to be downloaded.\nThe reasons above explained why I have my own versions of file handling and logging.\nFor the progress bar, I wish its animation is based on the count of pieces of files rather than the size, because it isn't worth to make hundreds of connections to check the images' size of a \"board\". SimpleProgressBar's animation is based on size and PiecesProgressBar just count down the number.\nLastly, it seems I misunderstood the exception handling strategy in youku.py, it raise the KeyboardInterrupt but I bypass it. :disappointed: \n@soimort \n. > you could just call download_urls as many times as want\nYes, that will makes things more simple and I no longer need to care about the progress bar, but as you said, it is not so good looking.\nThis is the output of my customized version file handling code:\n```\nyou-get http://huaban.com/boards/24803867/\nSite:       \u82b1\u74e3 (Huaban)\nTitle:      \u7231\u4e0a\u5496\u5561\u7684\u5473\u9053\nDownloading 105 images in \u7231\u4e0a\u5496\u5561\u7684\u5473\u9053 ...\n     %[====------------------------------------] 8/105\n```\nand this is the output of \"calling download_urls for one image at a time\":\n```\n you-get http://huaban.com/boards/24803867/\nDownloading \u7231\u4e0a\u5496\u5561\u7684\u5473\u9053 (603832678).jpeg ...\n 0.0% (  0.0/  infMB) \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2524[1/1]  208 kB/s\nDownloading \u7231\u4e0a\u5496\u5561\u7684\u5473\u9053 (579557455).jpeg ...\n 0.0% (  0.1/  infMB) \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2524[1/1]  557 kB/s\nDownloading \u7231\u4e0a\u5496\u5561\u7684\u5473\u9053 (579557420).jpeg ...\n 0.0% (  0.1/  infMB) \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2524[1/1]  514 kB/s\n```\nDo you really prefer this way? If so, I push the new commit.\n. Yes, you are right, keeping simple is the best choice.\n. I know this is a stupid question, but, how could I do that?\nI read the README of this project and done the following steps before making the last commit:\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/soimort/you-get.git\ngit fetch upstream\ngit rebase upstream/develop\nI have a few experiments of opening PRs for other projects. After my code being merged, I would use the commands above to update my forked repo from the upstream, but I never do a rebase before the merging, so I'm not sure what that means : \\\n. Here are the outputs:\ngit branch -va\n* develop                   2a1a541 [Huaban] Refactoring.\n  remotes/origin/0.4        fb8acf4 version 0.4.111\n  remotes/origin/HEAD       -> origin/develop\n  remotes/origin/develop    2a1a541 [Huaban] Refactoring.\n  remotes/origin/gh-pages   741a354 version 0.4.324\n  remotes/origin/master     bf9910a version 0.4.324\n  remotes/upstream/0.4      fb8acf4 version 0.4.111\n  remotes/upstream/develop  2a80fb5 Merge branch 'zhangn1985-for-up' into develop (fix #906)\n  remotes/upstream/gh-pages 2062c68 version 0.4.330\n  remotes/upstream/master   bf495b1 version 0.4.330\n. There's no conflicts after rebasing, did I rebased correctly?:\ngit fetch upstream\ngit rebase upstream/develop\nI need to force push my commits otherwise I would get the following errors:\nTo git@github.com:wenLiangcan/you-get.git\n !

    "xuehuichao": "Thanks for your comments!\nI guess we can split our discussions into two layers: (1) fundamentally, do we want this feature in you-get? (2) technically, how can we improve the current implementation, if we decide to have this feature.\n- Is the proxy website reliable (e.g. will it be down, or will its format change)?\n- Are the listed proxies valid (e.g. malicious, or down)?\nI guess the technical issues can all be resolved, but the most fundamental question is whether you folks would want this feature included in you-get. I personally think this feature would be worthwhile, as a lot of users want to download from Chinese video websites, and it's a lot of pain finding proxies manually. With that said, I would totally understand if you think the proxy picker should be implemented in a separate tool.\nRegarding the technical details:\n- Proxy listing website's reliability: I think we may in the long run (1) avoid putting all eggs into the same basket by implementing proxy pickers using other proxy listing websites (2) implement some tests to check for format changes etc.\n- The listed proxies may not be valid. This is a very valid concern. In the current implementation, the proxy isn't working for around 30% of the time. This is still much better than picking proxies on my own, but it definitely has made you-get look less reliable. I think one way to mitigate it is to double check the proxy's validity before we initiate the actual download. For example, we may first try using the proxy to download a cnn.com page, and stop using it if the result doesn't look reasonable. We may try a couple of proxies in parallel first, and then pick a random one only from the ones that are known to work. Does that make sense?\nPlease let me know what you think.\n. ",

Will work on it some more.. @lamlam123tld3 in the latest commit I fixed it:\nwhile (pl_code_error and counter < len(data2[\"backup\"])):\nBut I will be looking at updating to panda.tv api_v2 to maybe remove the need to have the loops..

Timeout after only one second sounds somewhat insane. urlopen_with_retry can also catch socket.timeout exception so this can mess up the control flow.\nIn this patch it is kept with timeout set to 15 for there could be a chance someone really need it. If anyone would like to bypass IP limitations with short timeout, please change it to a rather short time period(F. I. 1 in the old commit).\n\n\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e4b\u540e\u6211\u53d1\u73b0timeout\u786e\u5b9e\u5e94\u8be5\u88ab\u79fb\u9664\uff0csocket timeout\u6307\u7684\u5e94\u8be5\u662fsocket block\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0asocket block 1\u79d2\uff0c\u6ca1\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bfb\u5199\uff0c\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u6b63\u5e38\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\uff08\u6bd4\u5982\u7ebf\u8def\u7e41\u5fd9\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7a0d\u5fae\u6ce2\u52a8\u4e86\u4e00\u4e0b\uff09\uff0c\u6240\u4ee51\u79d2\u5c31\u8d85\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u70b9\u8fc7\u4e86\u3002\u53e6\u5916urlopen_with_retry\u4e5f\u4f1a\u6355\u83b7socket.timeout\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6d41\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236\u4f1a\u53d8\u5f97\u6df7\u4e71\u3002\n\u4f46\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2apatch\u91cc\uff0ctimeout\u8fd8\u662f\u6709\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u9ed8\u8ba4\u503c\u662f15. \u5982\u679c\u6709\u4eba\u9700\u8981\u7528\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8d85\u65f6\u6765\u5b8c\u6210\u4e00\u4e9b\u4e8b\u60c5\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u89c9\u5f97\u8fd9\u4e2apatch\u8fd8\u4e0d\u5982\u539f\u6765\u7684\u597d\u7528\uff0c\u628atimeout\u7684\u503c\u6539\u77ed\u5c31\u884c\u4e86\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u6539\u6210\u539f\u6765\u76841\u3002. \u5bf9\u4e8e\u67d0\u4e9bHTTPError 403 503\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5982#1913 #1938 \uff08\u5728\u540e\u534a\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u5f00\u65b0issue\uff09\n\u8003\u8651\u4e24\u70b9\uff1a\n\nurl_info \u592a\u591a\u6b21\u8bbf\u95ee\u4f7fCDN\u6682\u65f6block\u4e86client\nCDN\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u9519\u8bef\n\n\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2acommit\u4e2d\uff0cparse api\u8fd4\u56de\u7684xml\uff0c\u83b7\u53d6\u6587\u4ef6\u683c\u5f0f\u548c\u6240\u6709\u5206\u7247\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u4e0d\u518d\u4f7f\u7528url_info\u3002\n\u4f7f\u7528url_info\u6765\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8fd4\u56deCDN\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002\n\u4f46\u662f\u6709\u4e9b\u65f6\u5019\u8fd8\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u6240\u6709CDN\u90fd\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002. \u6807\u9898\u91cc\u6709< >\u5bfc\u81f4regex\u65e0\u6cd5\u6b63\u5e38\u5904\u7406\u4e86. @ztytian \n\u4f60\u662f\u8bf4\u8fd9\u4e2a #1913 \uff1f\n\u8d34log\u770b\u770b\uff1f. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rosynirvana/you-get/f5cb6804748c25f84ce2bd4f4475e338ac45bae4/src/you_get/extractors/bilibili.py. new commit:\n```\n./you-get -i 'http://video.tudou.com/v/XMjcxNDE0MDU3Mg==.html?spm=a2h1r.8267915.m1275311.1~3!2~5~5~A'\nsite:                \u4f18\u9177 (Youku)\ntitle:               \u300a\u5feb\u4e50\u7537\u58f0\u300b\u5341\u5e74\u8715\u53d8\u8bb0(\u4e09) \u9648\u695a\u751f\u906d\u5c01\u6740\u668c\u8fdd\u4e09\u5e74 16\nstreams:             # Available quality and codecs\n    [ DEFAULT ] _________\n    - format:        hd2\n      container:     flv\n      video-profile: \u8d85\u6e05\n      size:          158.8 MiB (166508435 bytes)\n    # download-with: you-get --format=hd2 [URL]\n- format:        mp4\n  container:     mp4\n  video-profile: \u9ad8\u6e05\n  size:          84.5 MiB (88559194 bytes)\n# download-with: you-get --format=mp4 [URL]\n\n- format:        flvhd\n  container:     flv\n  video-profile: \u6807\u6e05\n  size:          39.6 MiB (41550101 bytes)\n# download-with: you-get --format=flvhd [URL]\n\n```. api changed so I believe this is outdated.. @weigeloveu \u628aximalaya.py\u653e\u5230 src/you_get/extractors/\u4e0b\u9762\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u518d\u628asrc/you_get/common.py\u66ff\u6362\u6210\u8fd9\u91cc\u7684\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e09\u4e2a.gitignore\u4e0d\u7528\u7ba1\n\u5982\u679c\u613f\u610f\u7528git\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5clone\u8fd9\u4e2abranch https://github.com/rosynirvana/you-get/tree/support_ximalaya. common.py\u91cc\u52a0\u5165\u4e86extractor\u7684hook\uff0c\u548cm4a\u7684\u6807\u8bc6\uff0c\u5e94\u8be5\u5927\u4e00\u70b9\u5427\u2026\u2026\u53ef\u4ee5\u770b\u53f3\u8fb9\u7684files changed\n\u73b0\u5728\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u662f\u4ed8\u8d39\u7684\u6253\u5370\u4e00\u6761\u4fe1\u606f\u8df3\u8fc7\uff0c\u53ea\u662f\u5728\u8fd4\u56de\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u91cc\u770b\u5230\u6709is_paid\u6807\u8bc6\uff0c\u6ca1\u627e\u5230\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u4ed8\u8d39track\uff0c\u6709\u4f8b\u5b50\u5417\uff1f. \u4ed8\u8d39\u7684\u770b\u4e0d\u5230url\uff0c\u5927\u6982\u662f\u4e0d\u884c\u3002\n\u66f4\u65b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e0b\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u5217\u8868\u91cc\u4e0b\u9650\u514d\u7684\u3002. common.py\nextractors/ximalaya.py. \u9884\u7f16\u8bd1\u7684pyc\u5e94\u8be5\u4e0d\u5927\u4f1a\uff0c\u662f\u4e0d\u662f\u6ca1\u627e\u5bf9\u4f4d\u7f6e. IMO the original url should be printed. Number of segments skipped does not help the user.. Original urls are those urls from input of users.\nUsers should not be informed with segments.. You mean the patch does not try to inform users which url has not been downloaded completely, but to tell users what percent of a single video file is downloaded?. IS_ANSI_TERMINAL = os.getenv('TERM') in (\n    'eterm-color',\n    'linux',\n    'screen',\n    'vt100',\n) or os.getenv('TERM').startswith('xterm')\nIf there's not a TERM env the code will raise an AttributeError.

I've no idea what youtube-dl does. FYI\uff0can identifier(a hash?) is not always possible to get and I can't see how a token helps. Append the vid of a qq video behind the filename is a solution but someone hates it. \nHandling identical filename is not trivial. Much code in common.py must be reritten completely. IMO the correct way to impl it should check all the input first. But now you-get has at least 3 ways to handle multi-input and it's not quite possible to unify. In short, it's now quite posible with current code.\nIMO you can try to fix it yourself because you know what you need and what you don't need. The fix wil be much easier..

Someone does not have a ffmpeg binary on his PATH  so it's better to parse the ``static'' m3u8 (all segments in one m3u8 without AES encryption) in the python code. Video segments in ts container are trivial to concat.\nFor a live stream(only 3 segments in one m3u8) it's much more tricky(polling the URI of playlist) so using ffmpeg will involve less bugs.. In apple's document it's advised to use application/vnd.apple.mpegurl or application/x-mpegurl\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/StreamingMediaGuide/DeployingHTTPLiveStreaming/DeployingHTTPLiveStreaming.html\nI'm not sure what does it mean but it seems master or playlist cannot be telled from the Content-Type\nZhanqi use application/x-mpegurl for both master and playlist\ncurl http://dlhls.cdn.zhanqi.tv/zqlive/300_lemHa.m3u8 -I\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nServer: DnionOS/1.11.2.1.10\nDate: Sat, 22 Jul 2017 10:53:00 GMT\nContent-Type: application/x-mpegURL\ncurl 'http://dlhls.cdn.zhanqi.tv/zqlive/300_lemHa_480p/index.m3u8?Dnion_vsnae=300_lemHa&stream=300_lemHa_480p&application=zqlivehls&data_type=child_m3u8&process_slot=0&suffix=_480p&original=300_lemHa' -I\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nServer: DnionOS/1.11.2.1.10\nDate: Sat, 22 Jul 2017 10:52:42 GMT\nContent-Type: application/x-mpegURL\nSo perhaps we need some tricks to tell print_info it's a master m3u8 or playlist, not necessarily a parameter.. reported twice\n2167 #1777.

Inferred from legacy code in bilibili.py\nIn bilibili_download_by_cid some parameters are already processed and discarded. \nSo kick it back will be messy. Lots of methods in common.py can act as an entrance so it will be hard to choose one.\nThere could be some videos using youku cloud player. We can fix it with adding several lines of code. That won't be hurt.  . It seems that urlencode cna works fine.. yep, it's a leak. hmmmm... Is this change harmful?. persists on Android Termux, or breaks something on other platform?. Ah, I see.\nThe old one - 100.0% is too long for the console so it prints two lines\n\nThe new one - make it 99.9 if percent_str is 100.0 but not completed\n\nWe cannot use round here \n. ",
