    "adamzap": "I applied Particules' commit and this works now.\nhttp://github.com/adamzap/html5-slides-markdown/commit/5cb9fe11f0c273fc690d88d73fde4d4770c1e81f\nThanks\n. Yeah, that would be a great feature. I'll start looking into it.\n. Merged n1k0's branch. I might try to weak the print stylesheet to look more like the slides, but this totally works with princexml.\nThanks!\n. n1k0 implemented this himself.\nThanks!!\n. I applied n1k0's changes and this now works.\nThanks!!\n. Do you mean a table of contents slide with a link to each slide? That could be nice...\n. I like the ToC feature alot, but I am seeing some bugginess when I render the README.md as a presentation and click on the last slide link in the ToC. Theres some weird rendering on the right of the AUTHORS slide.\nI can look at the problem if it's not something obvious to you, n1k0.\n. this works now. many thanks to n1k0.\n. It looks like that's causing problems with the php code sample as well.\nI'm looking into it.\n. I'm working on a solution...I'm going to use a multiline regex to get all the code blocks and highlight and replace them one at a time. It should work.\n. Fixed and pushed.\nI just leveled up in regex.\n. That'd be great, but the javascript implementation of markdown is called showdown\n. I believe I'm going to call it either Landslide or Represent. I'm leaning toward Landslide. Any objections? Going to pypi before the end of the week, I believe.\n. Landslide it is\n. Done and merged. Feedback is encouraged.\n. I was thinking we should keep it black and white for printing. The code is still highlighted though.\nIs the use case printing or just having a PDF of the presentation?\n. It might be this logic...but it works for me.\nI'll try it on a few machines.\ntry:\n    from landslide.generator import Generator\nexcept ImportError:\n    from generator import Generator\nI thought this would work for both working with a checkout and an pip install...\n. n1k0, it works fine for me on an ubuntu machine that's never seen a recent version of our code. I used pip.\n. Hmm ok. Thanks for doing that. It should also be installing markdown, jinja2, and pygments as requirements...\nI'll keep investigating.\n. I think I'm confusing setuptools and distutils...this is my first time to make a python package\n. First i have no landslide installed, then i install it, then it works...\nThis is on my macbook. \n```\n\u25cb python\nPython 2.6.5 (r265:79063, May 17 2010, 13:48:52) \n[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5664)] on darwin\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n\n\n\nimport landslide\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nImportError: No module named landslide\nfrom landslide.generator import Generator\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nImportError: No module named landslide.generator\n\u25cb sudo pip install landslide\nDownloading/unpacking landslide\n  Downloading landslide-0.4.0.tar.gz (51Kb): 51Kb downloaded\n  Running setup.py egg_info for package landslide\nInstalling collected packages: landslide\n  Running setup.py install for landslide\n    changing mode of build/scripts-2.6/landslide from 644 to 755\n    changing mode of /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/bin/landslide to 755\nSuccessfully installed landslide\nCleaning up...\n\u25cb python\nPython 2.6.5 (r265:79063, May 17 2010, 13:48:52) \n[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5664)] on darwin\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\nimport landslide\n\u25cb python\nPython 2.6.5 (r265:79063, May 17 2010, 13:48:52) \n[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5664)] on darwin\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\nfrom landslide.generator import Generator\nGenerator\n\n\u25cb landslide\nUsage: landslide [options] input.md ...\n\n\n\nGenerates fancy HTML5 or PDF slideshows from Markdown sources\nOptions:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -b, --debug           Will display any exception trace to stdin\n  -d FILE, --destination=FILE\n                        The path to the to the destination file: .html or .pdf\n                        extensions allowed (default: presentation.html)\n  -e ENCODING, --encoding=ENCODING\n                        The encoding of your files (defaults to utf8)\n  -i, --embed           Embed base64-encoded images in presentation\n  -t FILE, --template=FILE\n                        The path to a Jinja2 compatible template file\n  -o, --direct-ouput    Prints the generated HTML code to stdin; won't work\n                        with PDF export\n  -q, --quiet           Won't write anything to stdin (silent mode)\n  -v, --verbose         Write informational messages to stdin (enabled by\n                        default)\nNote: PDF export requires the prince program: http://princexml.com/\n```\n. n1k0, can you put some debug statements in /usr/local/bin/landslide to see what that import logic is really going? It should be able to import the landslide module after install...\n. Yay :)\n. I added more rst features to samples/example3. That's enough for now\n. I'm not going to worry about this any time soon other than maybe manually editing the default theme. There doesnt seem to be a good option for HTML5 tidying right now other than this nonsense:\ntidy -as-xhtml --input-xml --tidy-mark no -indent --indent-spaces 4 -wrap 0 --new-blocklevel-tags article,header,footer --new-inline-tags video,audio,canvas,ruby,rt,rp --doctype \"<!DOCTYPE HTML>\" --break-before-br yes --sort-attributes alpha --vertical-space yes\nand it doesn't even work. (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2657658/wanted-command-line-html5-beautifier)\n. Thanks for catching this. It's fixed in my trunk, and I'll push a minor release to pypi soon.\nI just adjusted the encoding of the html file as it went into princeXML.\n. I like the solution of just editing the default theme and creating a new one. This seems simpler to me.\nIt would be great if you could push that extra theme to me and I'll add it to the core distribution.\nAm I understanding correctly?\n. May I include your extra theme in landslide 0.8? I'll figure out the abstraction for theme inheritance in 0.9 or 1.0.\nYou can either update your repository to mine, commit the theme, and push it to me, or I can grab the theme from your repository and commit it myself.\n. I have added your theme and called it \"light\". Also, themes no longer need to include a custom base.html or js/slides.js. If those files are missing, Landslide will use the base.html and js/slides.js from the default theme.\n. Great Idea. I'll do that very soon.\n. I need to do some reading on this and respond.\nThanks for the contribution...Landslide is my first attempt at packaging a python app :)\n. I've just been really busy. I'll try to take a look at it again this afternoon or tomorrow.\nSorry about that.\n. I followed this to package landslide: http://diveintopython3.org/packaging.html\nWas I wrong in doing that? I will play around with your changes to setup.py, but can you explain to me why we should support setuptools and why the files should be renamed as you did?\nThanks...I'm still new at packaging ;)\n. Merged. Many thanks. Sorry for all the delay :)\n. Luckily it was a problem it example2's markup\n. Wow, good catch. I have merged mtryhall's branch so all should be well now.\nThanks!!\n. Done just now. Thanks\n. Aw man how did I miss this? Thanks...\nSo I can ignore Ticket #18?\n. You're right n1k0. I really have a lot to learn about testing. Thanks.\nHandle this stuff in the next few days.\n. Thanks n1k0.\nThis has been fixed in 0.8.1 (just pushed)\n. Yeah, this would be cool. Good find.\nI'll start looking around at how to implement it.\n. Wow this is awesome. I used it but haven't review the code yet. I'll do that before long.\nThanks as always.\n. This is awesome in the main theme. I'll look at porting it to the other themes.\n. I added your expose CSS to the other themes.\nThanks again!!\n. Yeah I was looking last night. I hope to merge everything this weekend.\nYou don't send me pull requests these days ;)\nThanks as always n1k0!!\n. Fixed in master thanks to olivierverdier.\nThanks for reporting this.\n. You sure did. I have merged your branch.\nThanks so much.\n. I am also crediting you in the README.\n. Thanks for the patches, guys.\nn1k0, can you git me an opinion on what to merge? #24? You're better at i18n than I am :)\nthanks\n. I have merged Olivier's branch. \nThank you very much millette, n1k0, and Olivier.\nI'll release 0.8.2 very soon.\n. I found that the help div wasn't hidden on PDF generation, so I wanted to get that fix released as soon as possible. This affected all PDFs.\nI wasn't sure when I'd have time to look at #25 so I went ahead and released 0.8.2. ;)\n. Merged, thanks.\n. Merged. Tanks!\n. I can't make this a priority right now. Someone who knows Windows is going to have to fix this probably.\n. I'm a little confused too. I'm currently review all of this code.\nThanks for the contributions as always!!\n. The code looks great. I am not seeing a safe way to remove those duplicate commits though. Any ideas before I push?\n. Done...I wonder if this is 0.9 worthy? ;)\n. I just implemented support for the :align: directive.\nThe width and height directives work, but you have you put spaces after the image line. Same with :align:.\nThanks for reporting these issues.\n. It looks like the FixImagePaths Macro's regex is a little too pushy. I should have a fix this afternoon.\nI guess I only tested with remote images.\nThanks for reporting this.\n. Ok it should be fixed now.\nThanks\n. I still like having an easily-readable and hopefully-obvious separator for slide.\nThis could be considered when our RST support gets more advanced though.\nThanks!\n. Is that a Restructured Text directive?\nThe table of contents in landslide is built from slide breaks. We are not using ReST specific commands.\nThe ToC generated by rendering samples/example seems to work fine.\n. We do not support the RST Table of Contents directive at this time. Our RST support is just for simple markup.\nMaybe in a later version. Thanks\n. For now we'll just say...do no use directives like sidebar.\nLandslide will only support a subset of ReST for now.\n. Awesome...will merge soon. Thanks\n. Finally merged these changes. Thanks\n. Duplicate \n. Hello. I'm finally ready to merge this, but I'm wondering where you got the theme? Did you make it yourself?\nThanks\n. Awesome. Thanks.\nMerged.\n. Is this the same problem described in issue #39?\n. I just finished implementing this.\nIt works with the -i flag.\nThanks\n. Thanks\n. I merged this but had to make another commit because importing macro messes up variables named macro in generator.py. So I renamed macro.py to macros.py.\nLet me know if you have feedback on this solution.\nAlso feel free to submit a request to have your theme merged. It is nice :)\nThanks\n. Yes, for now I think it would be better to have some kind of config option to include nondefault macros. \nYour change did bring this sort of thing to my attention, which was good.\nWhat do you think?\n. Thanks!\n. This is great!!\nOnce you're done, I'll merge it and cut 1.0. Great work, seriously.\n. Or did you want someone else to finish it?\n. Cool. I'll take a look at the CSS once you're done. No worries. Not that I'm a pro either though... ;)\n'p' would be my first idea for a shortcut key. It's keycode 80.\n. Great, I'm about to merge. One question though.\nDo you intend for markdown content (lists, for instance) to be rendered to presenter notes? I am considering replacing your heading notation with our typical macro or note notation:\n.presenter-notes Blah Blah Blah Blah\nOr something like that. To me, adding a header may confuse things a little. I'm still thinking about it.\nDo you feel strongly either way?\nI didn't encounter that bug in Chrome. I'll look deeper in a bit.\n. Yes, I'd like to move this to a macro as well. I was looking at that the other night. I'll let you know about the refactoring, n1k0. I might have some time early this week.\nI'm mostly concerned with what the input format will look like. Right now I'm leaning toward something like this:\n```\nSlide 1\nHello\nBlah Blah\n.presenter_notes\n\nOne\nTwo\nThree\n\nSlide Two\n```\nThoughts?\n. Oh yes. I forgot the trailing colon ;)\nI'll do it that way. Thanks for the feedback, guys.\n. I like this idea as well. I just merged BestFriendChris' presenter view branch, and now I'll be working on the new macro system.\nHow should we go about including new macros into the rendering of a slideshow? If there's not much overhead, we may as well parse for every macro landslide has (QR codes and all). I do not want a user of landslide to have to touch to the code to enable a macro we ship with.\nn1k0, we talked about about not including the QR macro as default...as we rethink the macro system, how should the user enable it? Or do you also think it should be enabled automatically?\n. I believe Landslide supports this now. Let me know if you have any further problems with it.\n. Yeah, this is a great idea. Could you recommend a python module for landslide to use? I guess the textile module is the obvious choice...\n. I finally added textile support.\nUnfortunately, textile has no way of rendering an  tag, so you'll have to specify those literally to break your slides.\n. Do you mean that you're not able to arbitrarily bring up a keyboard input like on an iPhone? I see what you mean...\nSwiping left and right to change slides works, but I'll see what we can do about detecting your platform and providing a menu.\n. No, you're not missing anything. I agree with you.\nThanks for the docs.\n. I thought I fixed that...thanks.\n. @sdouche I have implemented screen blanking as described and n1k0's page up and page down fix is there as well.\nWhat is freezing?\n. Are you saying that your laser button tells the browser to refresh?\nLandslide has nothing set for key code 63, so I'm a little confused. Maybe you could try to fix it in your fork and submit a pull request?\nWhat model is your pen?\nThanks\n. I'm going to close this issue. Please reopen it if anything changes with the pen.\nThanks!\n. I'm hoping to improve templating a lot in v2.0. \n. Your commits undo each other as blocke said, but thanks for reporting the issue. I'll take a look at it.\n. I fixed presenter notes in the tango and light themes.\n. On a Mac, the open command opens a file in it's associated application, so calling open an an html file would open it a web browser.\nSince you are on linux, you should just open presentation.html in a web browser or use some other command line tool if you prefer.\nUs putting open in the README is just a cool Mac trick ;)\nSorry to confuse. Does this help?\n. Thanks!\n. Good points. This will be considered post-1.0.\nThanks!\n. How do they get in the way? Are you seeing something about presenter notes without pressing p?\nIt looks like your patch just takes the title away from the presenter notes box if they're not present. Help me understand.\nThanks!\n. Weird...could you post the markdown source you are using or is it RST?\nThis .md should work, does it?\n```\nLandslide\n\nSomething\n\n1                                                                                                                                                                                  \n2                                                                                                                                                                                  \n\nPresenter Notes\nhi                                                                                                                                                                                   \n\nOverview\nGenerates a slideshow using the slides that power\n```\n.

Can you explain a little more maybe? Or include a screenshot?\nAlso, wouldn't codecs.BOM be a better way to do this?\nThanks!\n. I'm still having trouble reproducing this error. I don't see anything in my editor or in the rendered presentation. I diffed a presentation output file with and without your patch that was made with your test.md file, and I got no differences.\nI have only tested on a macbook thus far. Thanks for your patience.\n. I'm not seeing an attached zip on your email.\n. I got your attachment and I can see the problem now. Thanks for being patient with me.\n. Fixed, thanks.\n. Good catch, Thanks!\n. Thanks!!\n. I think this is a good idea.\nFeel free to go ahead and implement this with a -w flag. Hopefully we can get it in before 1.0.\nThanks!\nOh, and it'd be cool to hear more about how you're using landslide in your course. My email address is on my github page\n. I hope to have 1.0 tagged and on pypi this weekend.\n. And that presentation looks awesome! Thanks for sharing.\n. Discussion moved to #71\n. I just pushed a temporary fix for this, so you should be good.\nStill trying to solve it...it looks like the javascript is moving the last slide's presenter_notes div out from under the slide div to the slides div when there is a certain type of code block present maybe?\nWe'll see.\n. Same here!\nThanks\n. Wow, I bet it would have taken me forever to catch this.\nThanks!\n. I was hoping to get 1.0 up there this weekend. I have some goals to accomplish before I make another real release.\nI'll probably have it on pypi this weekend regardless.\nThanks\n. What does it mean to use Landslide on app engine? Hosting presentations or rendering them?\nI've never used app engine, so maybe I'm missing something.\n. I'm trying to decide whether we should require watchdog or make it optional.\nMaybe if they try the -w flag, it would try to import watchdog and upon a failure, tell them to install it.\nWhat do you think? I guess I'm hesitant to add watchdog as a dependency (along with its many dependencies). Maybe I'm wrong.\n. Whenever I save my .md file in vim, I immediately get this from the watch process:\n```\n\u25cb ./main.py -w ~/Desktop/landslide_test/test.md\nAdding   /Users/adam/Desktop/landslide_test/test.md (markdown)\nGenerated file: presentation.html\nWatching /Users/adam/Desktop/landslide_test/test.md\nAdding   /Users/adam/Desktop/landslide_test/test.md (markdown)Generated file: presentation.html\nWatching /Users/adam/Desktop/landslide_test/test.md\nException in thread Thread-2:Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.2/lib/python2.7/threading.py\", line 552, in bootstrap_inner\n    self.run()\n  File \"/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/watchdog/observers/api.py\", line 192, in run\n    self.queue_events(self.timeout)\n  File \"/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/watchdog/observers/kqueue.py\", line 686, in queue_events\n    self.watch.is_recursive)\n  File \"/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/watchdog/utils/dirsnapshot.py\", line 227, in __init\n    stat_info = os.stat(self._path)\nOSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/Users/adam/Desktop/landslide_test/test.md'\n```\nAny ideas? Maybe it's me.\n. I tried smultron, and it's not seeing the changes...weird.\nWhich editor are you using?\nI'll play with this more tonight. I'm probably missing something.\n. I used your code as starting point and finally implemented this...a year later.\nThanks!\n. Merged #93\nThanks\n. I'll do some testing with it today. Thanks!\n. I am fixing this with the suggestion by @millette.\nPlease open a separate pull request for the notes problem.\nThanks!\n. How can I reproduce this?\nThanks\n. Good catch. I was able to reproduce this by trying the -o option with \u2665 as slide content. It's odd that I didn't think to try that sooner. Oh well...\nThanks again!\n. I think the previous behavior might correct.\nTry with this example:\n```\nSlide\nI am a normal line\nI am indented\n\n!python\nx = 'first python line'\na = x\n\nI too am a normal line\n!python\ny = 'second python line'\nb = y\n\n```\nIf an indented block starts with a non code block, we can't assume the whole thing should be a code block.\nI guess a more robust solution would be for the code highlighting macro to not pick up a normal indented block. I'll look into that.\nLet me know what you think.\n. I will add author support to the default theme in v2.\n. The extra Presenter Notes pages are now hidden on pdf export in the master brach.\nPictures in PDFs retain their color. What is missing? The simple code block colors are intentional. Reopen this issue if you want to discuss further.\nI'll look into wkhtmltopdf, but it may be a while before our pdf generator changes for Landslide.\nThanks for the feedback!\n. I cannot reproduce this\n. Good catch, but I'm trying to decide if we should use \"Untitled\", a blank/space, or something else...a dash?\n\n\n\nThoughts?\n. Agreed and thanks again!\n. Did this happen from the pypi version (1.0.0)?\nIt should be fixed in master. I'll cut a new release (1.0.1) soon.\n. I'll updated it on PyPi soon. Sorry about that. It should work in master.\n. I've updated Landslide on pypi.\nhttp://pypi.python.org/pypi/landslide/1.0.1\nDid that help?\n. Thanks for the pull request!\nHowever, this adds a bit too complex for my tastes. Maybe one day I can make it easy to include external macros. \n. Thanks!\n. Yeah, generating and installing man pages seems a bit hairy. I'm closing this issue for now since running landslide or main.py with no arguments should be sufficient.\nThanks for the useful links and suggestion though.\n. Is suppressing all ReST errors acceptable behavior?\n. Yeah, I just supressed all ReST rendering errors.\nThanks\n. The current method seems to work fine. If you have some reasoning as to why it should work in the way you have suggested, please reopen the ticket and let me know.\nThanks!\n. Wow, this is great. Not sure why it's taken me 10 months to merge. Sorry about that.\nThanks!\n. Thanks!\n. I have linked to the python markdown extensions documentation in the README.\nYou have to pass in the extension name, so pass in abbr to get markdown.extensions.abbr loaded.\nI think loading them all could be problematic as some users might experience unexpected behavior with their markup. They are extensions for a reason! :wink: \nThanks!\n. This seems to be fixed in newer versions of Firefox. Let me know if you're still experiencing the problem and if there's something I can do on the Landside end of things.\nThanks!\n. Thanks for reporting this...over three years ago :wink: \n. Good catch! I'll add some blockquote styles to the existing themes.\n. Cool, let me know how it goes. I'd be open to adding click advancing as a command-line switch if you really need it.\nThanks!\n. @metal3d This isn't working for me either. Could you make a sample presentation available?\nMy initial thought is that Landslide should not support this feature unless someone else wants to implement it.\n. Thanks @gdyer!\n. Great, thanks!\n. You are currently able to write presenter notes in presentations formatted in ReST. Like so:\n```\nSlide Title\n===========\nThis is my slide content\nPresenter Notes\nThese are my presenter notes\n```\nOr are you trying to achieve something else with this code?\n. Very true, thanks. The examples really need to be redone.\n. Good catch, thanks!\n. First of all, this is great for your first pull request. Thanks helping with Landslide!\nI'm having trouble reproducing your problem though. If I run src/landslide/main.py -i -t tango samples/example1 from a clean checkout of my repo, the tango theme's background.png theme image is embedded in the output file.\nI'm probably misunderstanding something.\nAlso, when would self.theme_dir ever be False since self.find_theme_dir is called in __init__?\n. Thanks @akrabat and @akrabat. I'm going to merge #126.\n. Not currently. I think you'd need to do that with a custom theme at the moment.\n. I'm not able to reproduce your issue. Here's the file I tested with:\n```\nTesting Link Titles\n\nTest\nGoogle\n```\nPlease reopen this issue if it's still a problem.\nThanks!\n. Yeah, I'd like to add this. I need to integrate the latest version of HTML5Slides. Thanks for the suggestion.\n. I'm hoping to implement this in v2.0 after I deal with existing issues and pull requests then do some cleanup and refactoring.\n. Not at the moment.\nCurrently, centering of the title slide is done with a CSS only-child selector, so it'd be hard to add additional content without significant theme changes.\nThat said, I like the idea. What would the markup look like though?\n. Yes, @durden makes a good point, but for now there is no way. See also #111.\n. What happened here? I wonder why it says you merged a commit into my master branch.\n. I'm pretty sure this is the problem (in utils.py):\npython\ndef get_rel_path_url(path, base_path=os.getcwd()):\n    \"\"\" Returns a relative path from the absolute one passed as argument.\n        Silently returns originally provided path on failure.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        path_url = path.split(base_path)[1]\n        if path_url.startswith('/'):\n            return path_url[1:]\n        else:\n            return path_url\n    except (IndexError, TypeError):\n        return path\n. Oh! I didn't see your suggestion, but that's how I fixed it in 62fcba3a :smile: \nThanks!\n. Thanks!\n. I went with Watchdog.\n. Thanks :)\n. Thanks for the pull request. Could you make it into one commit and resubmit?\n. Thanks! I guess this was blocking lexers like c# or html+django\nGood catch!\n. Could you paste in a sample Markdown or ReST file that reproduces the error for me?\nAlso, are you using a custom theme?\nThanks\n. Thanks for the example. I believe I understand your problem now.\nI think it's best to leave the solution to be a workaround. I don't think it's wise to make a special case in the markdown parsing part of landslide for this.\nYou have two options:\n- The underscore workaround\n- Wrapping your mathjax code in <div></div> (this may require some styling, which could be added to the default theme or to your custom theme)\nDoes this sound ok?\n. Good catch. Thanks!\n. Thanks! We should talk more about what you're doing with avalanche. Very cool\n. Thanks!\n. I really like this, but it makes Landslide huge (312K to 5.5M). I'll be thinking about it.\nThanks!\n. Yeah, Google Web Fonts would be great. If you could make that change, I'll worry about any other size issues.\nAlso, do you think we need the scss files?\n. Yeah, I'm good with offline getting some nice defaults.\n. Great, thanks. Have you contacted the author of shower about doing this? I think we're ok on the licensing side of things.\n. Cool. We'll wait until the end of the week to hear from him before merging then. I want to cut a release with this theme included this weekend.\nLet me know what you hear Thanks again.\n. Does that mean we should add shower's license file in the themes/ribbon/ directory?\n. Hooray!\nThanks for all of your work!\n. I merged your pull request. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Hello,\nIt seems that this has more to do with Markdown than Landslide. Perhaps you could add some normal text between the list and the code? Or put a &nbsp; between the two.\nGithub does it too:\n- item 1\n- item 2\n!python\n  import os\n  os.listdir()\nvs.\n- item 1\n- item 2\nsome text\n!python\nimport os\nos.listdir()\n. This has already been added. See the following:\nhttps://github.com/adamzap/landslide/blob/master/src/landslide/generator.py#L113\nhttps://github.com/adamzap/landslide/blob/master/src/landslide/generator.py#L441-443\nThanks though! I'll cut a release soon.\n. Yeah, I cut a bad release. I'm about to push a fix up.\nSorry about that.\n. I've fixed the problem and pushed a new version to pypi.\nLet me know if you still have problems.\n. Great job on this theme!\nI wonder if it would better for you to keep in it's own repository on your account due to it's size and how different it is from the default theme. I can link to it.\n. Sorry I never got back to you on this!\nYou could create a new repository just for this new theme, and I'll link to it in Landslide's readme.\nThanks!\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. I've integrated the presenter notes change and credited you in the CHANGELOG.\nI hope to come back to the copy_theme changes later.\nThanks!\n. Ah ok. Glad you got it figured out :smile: \n. Thanks for the pull request!\nWhat's the harm in embedding an empty JS file if the user has explicitly asked for embedding?\n. I'm going to close this for now. Landslide now has better support for MathJax on the master branch.\nIf you try that and are still having trouble with MathJax, open a new issue and we'll see what we can do.\n. Thanks for the patch.\nThe default ReST math rendering is working, but I think the MathJax approach is breaking due to ReST's HTML preprocessing.\nThis can work for markdown though. I'll make a few adjustments after merging.\n. This is awesome!\nThanks\n. Is there anyway I can confirm that this works with Leap Motion and should be included in Landslide? I don't own the device.\nThanks!\n. That would be great.\nAdam Zapletal\nOn Aug 24, 2013, at 1:02 AM, Izar Tarandach notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nFirst of all, thank you so much for your hard work with landslide - it is \nawesome! \nIf it helps any I can make a quick movie of it working, how about that? \nOn Aug 23, 2013 10:25 PM, \"Adam Zapletal\" notifications@github.com wrote: \n\nIs there anyway I can confirm that this works with Leap Motion and should \nbe included in Landslide?

I'm hoping to implement this in v2.0 after I deal with existing issues and pull requests then do some cleanup and refactoring.\nThanks for the resources!\n. Thanks for the pull request, but I prefer explicit slide breaks. \n. @tjwood100 Thanks!\n. This kind of functionality can be available in a custom theme.\nAs I work toward v2.0, I hope to include a theme that has it built in!\nThanks for the idea!\n. They are both working for me with the examples you cited:\n```\nCSV Table\n=========\n.. csv-table:: Frozen Delights!\n   :header: \"Treat\", \"Quantity\", \"Description\"\n   :widths: 15, 10, 30\n\"Albatross\", 2.99, \"On a stick!\"\n   \"Crunchy Frog\", 1.49, \"If we took the bones out, it wouldn't be\n   crunchy, now would it?\"\n   \"Gannet Ripple\", 1.99, \"On a stick!\"\n```\n\n```\nList Table\n==========\n.. list-table:: Frozen Delights!\n   :widths: 15 10 30\n   :header-rows: 1\n\n\n\nTreat\nQuantity\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nAlbatross\n2.99\nOn a stick!\n\n\n\n\nCrunchy Frog\n1.49\nIf we took the bones out, it wouldn't be\n   crunchy, now would it?\n\n\n\n\nGannet Ripple\n1.99\nOn a stick!\n```\n\n\n\n\nLet me know if you're still having trouble...over a year later :wink: \n. Awesome, thanks!\n. Sure, I'm open to a pull request.\nThanks!\n. Thanks for this work and sorry for the delay in my response.\nThe relative imports break on Python 2.7. Any idea how to fix that?\n. You're right. I've fallen way behind on python packaging and testing. Also I've never touched python3.\nCould you squash you commits into one?\n. Great, thanks :+1: \n. Thanks for the pull request, but I think the RST directives are a bit out of the scope of Landslide. You can always use the .. raw:: html directive to embed multimedia things.\n. I think it's ok the way it is.\nMarkdown wraps images in a <p>, but restructured text does not.\n. What would the source for that look like? I mean how would you specify it in your slides?\nCould you give an example input?\n. I'm unable to reproduce this. It works for the example for me.\nCould you paste some breaking restructured text so I can debug it?\nThanks\n. Reopen this ticket if you're still having problems\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks for the pull request!\nHowever, I think it's to much of an edge case for the user to want to switch line number styles mid-presentation. \n. Thanks for the pull request, but this is too much to merge at one time!\nI'll try to incorporate some of your fixes over time.\n. Thanks, but I don't use travis-ci\n. I removed it before closing your PR :wink: \n. Thanks for reporting this problem and offering a solution.\nI'm going to fix it by simplifying the regex to look for url() in the page that contains an image extension.\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. I'll revisit this in v2.\nThanks for the PR!\n. Which version are you running? Did you download it from pypi or did you clone it from GitHub?\nThanks for the report\n. I think the issue is that I haven't cut a release since #158 was merged.\nI'll try to do that soon. Your problem would probably be solved if you used a version cloned from github in the meantime. \n. I finally cut a release!\nv1.1.2 is now on PyPI\n. I'm having trouble reproducing this issue. Could you post an example source file that where it happens?\n. Reopen this ticket if you're still having problems\n. This is a great idea, but it looks like CSS expressions are deprecated and were only supported by Internet Explorer anyway:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/6191679/css-expressions\nI appreciate your pull request though!\n. I'm unable to reproduce this with a fresh install on both Python 2 and 3.\nPlease reopen this issue if the problem persists.\nThanks!\n. @ztzt How did you install Landslide?\n. It seems to be a problem with your python or pip installation. Would you consider switching to homebrew and see if it works? http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/\n. Thanks for the bug report!\n. Every markdown-based slideshow generator has to make decisions on how to interpret the markup to output a slideshow instead of plain HTML.\nI hope the design decisions I've made for Landslide make sense. For instance, Landslide interprets the markup that generates an <hr> as a slide separator.\nI've always gone back to John Gruber's Markdown Syntax Guide as the authority on what markdown is. On top of that, I just pass text into python's markdown module.\nI understand your frustration. Markdown-based slideshow generation is a crowded space these days.\n. Reopen this ticket if you're still having problems\n. Run landslide -m on an .rst file containing this:\n```\nMathJax Test\n============\n\\[ \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \\right)^2 \\]\n```\nIt works for me. Does it work for you?\n. That's odd.\nYou can try the -b flag, but I'm not sure that it will help.\nThe best thing to do is probably to look at the generated HTML file and debug from there.\n. Reopen this ticket if you're still having problems\n. Thanks for the PR!\nCould you explain how this improves things and which problems you're having? Landslide doesn't really support mobile yet.\nWhich device are you on?\n. I'm going to close this for now since there should be much better touch support in v2.\nThanks!\n. You're referring to the master branch, right?\nDo you have any suggestions? Maybe put statements like from .generator import Generator in __init__.py?\n. I believe I have fixed the themes directory issue. I can generate presentations after installing via setup.py.\nCould you grab master and try?\nThanks!\n. Awesome!\nI'll close the issue then.\nI'm curious though why you installed with setup.py instead of pip.\n. Got it, thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. @htaslan I am able to use landslide with non-ASCII characters without your patch.\nDid you close this pull request because you discovered the same thing?\n. I'm having trouble reproducing this. Which operating system are you on?\n. Run landslide with -x tables to enable the markdown extension for rendering tables.\nFor example: landslide -x tables slides.md\nSee the markdown documentation here: https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/tables.html\n. Your theme should inherit from the default theme...or did you delete it?\nAlso, you could add a blank screen.css file in your theme directory. That's a simple way to bypass it.\n. @vbauer Let me know if you need any more help\n. That's a great idea. Maybe with this? https://github.com/google/py-gfm\nThanks!\n. Fenced code blocks will work when I release v2!\n. - Which version are you using?\n- Can you provide a file that causes it to fail?\n. Closing until a response is received \n. @luwenhegithub Could you provide a file that I can run through Landslide to reproduce the problem?\n. Could you post the input file that generated this error?\n. I'll reopen this if I get more information\n. Thanks for the pull request. Could you provide a slideshow that shows the behavior you are attempting to fix here?\n. This will be fixed when I release v2.\nThanks for reporting!\n. Thanks for the pull request!\nI like your approach here, but I'm in the middle of a full rewrite of Landslide. I'll be happy to integrate this idea (and a much better macro/plugin system) soon after I'm done.\n. Yeah, I think you'd need to write custom CSS for that right now. However, I like the idea of adding a few simply utility classes like center to the default theme.\n. Could you provide an input file that exhibits #188?\n. Thanks for the PR. I'll try to reproduce and test this soon.\nBy the way, you can pass a tuple to isinstance instead of using or, like isinstance('a', (str, int)).. I applied Particules' commit and this works now.\nhttp://github.com/adamzap/html5-slides-markdown/commit/5cb9fe11f0c273fc690d88d73fde4d4770c1e81f\nThanks\n. Yeah, that would be a great feature. I'll start looking into it.\n. Merged n1k0's branch. I might try to weak the print stylesheet to look more like the slides, but this totally works with princexml.\nThanks!\n. n1k0 implemented this himself.\nThanks!!\n. I applied n1k0's changes and this now works.\nThanks!!\n. Do you mean a table of contents slide with a link to each slide? That could be nice...\n. I like the ToC feature alot, but I am seeing some bugginess when I render the README.md as a presentation and click on the last slide link in the ToC. Theres some weird rendering on the right of the AUTHORS slide.\nI can look at the problem if it's not something obvious to you, n1k0.\n. this works now. many thanks to n1k0.\n. It looks like that's causing problems with the php code sample as well.\nI'm looking into it.\n. I'm working on a solution...I'm going to use a multiline regex to get all the code blocks and highlight and replace them one at a time. It should work.\n. Fixed and pushed.\nI just leveled up in regex.\n. That'd be great, but the javascript implementation of markdown is called showdown\n. I believe I'm going to call it either Landslide or Represent. I'm leaning toward Landslide. Any objections? Going to pypi before the end of the week, I believe.\n. Landslide it is\n. Done and merged. Feedback is encouraged.\n. I was thinking we should keep it black and white for printing. The code is still highlighted though.\nIs the use case printing or just having a PDF of the presentation?\n. It might be this logic...but it works for me.\nI'll try it on a few machines.\ntry:\n    from landslide.generator import Generator\nexcept ImportError:\n    from generator import Generator\nI thought this would work for both working with a checkout and an pip install...\n. n1k0, it works fine for me on an ubuntu machine that's never seen a recent version of our code. I used pip.\n. Hmm ok. Thanks for doing that. It should also be installing markdown, jinja2, and pygments as requirements...\nI'll keep investigating.\n. I think I'm confusing setuptools and distutils...this is my first time to make a python package\n. First i have no landslide installed, then i install it, then it works...\nThis is on my macbook. \n```\n\u25cb python\nPython 2.6.5 (r265:79063, May 17 2010, 13:48:52) \n[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5664)] on darwin\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n\n\n\nimport landslide\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nImportError: No module named landslide\nfrom landslide.generator import Generator\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nImportError: No module named landslide.generator\n\u25cb sudo pip install landslide\nDownloading/unpacking landslide\n  Downloading landslide-0.4.0.tar.gz (51Kb): 51Kb downloaded\n  Running setup.py egg_info for package landslide\nInstalling collected packages: landslide\n  Running setup.py install for landslide\n    changing mode of build/scripts-2.6/landslide from 644 to 755\n    changing mode of /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/bin/landslide to 755\nSuccessfully installed landslide\nCleaning up...\n\u25cb python\nPython 2.6.5 (r265:79063, May 17 2010, 13:48:52) \n[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5664)] on darwin\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\nimport landslide\n\u25cb python\nPython 2.6.5 (r265:79063, May 17 2010, 13:48:52) \n[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5664)] on darwin\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\nfrom landslide.generator import Generator\nGenerator\n\n\u25cb landslide\nUsage: landslide [options] input.md ...\n\n\n\nGenerates fancy HTML5 or PDF slideshows from Markdown sources\nOptions:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -b, --debug           Will display any exception trace to stdin\n  -d FILE, --destination=FILE\n                        The path to the to the destination file: .html or .pdf\n                        extensions allowed (default: presentation.html)\n  -e ENCODING, --encoding=ENCODING\n                        The encoding of your files (defaults to utf8)\n  -i, --embed           Embed base64-encoded images in presentation\n  -t FILE, --template=FILE\n                        The path to a Jinja2 compatible template file\n  -o, --direct-ouput    Prints the generated HTML code to stdin; won't work\n                        with PDF export\n  -q, --quiet           Won't write anything to stdin (silent mode)\n  -v, --verbose         Write informational messages to stdin (enabled by\n                        default)\nNote: PDF export requires the prince program: http://princexml.com/\n```\n. n1k0, can you put some debug statements in /usr/local/bin/landslide to see what that import logic is really going?

I'm not going to worry about this any time soon other than maybe manually editing the default theme. There doesnt seem to be a good option for HTML5 tidying right now other than this nonsense:\ntidy -as-xhtml --input-xml --tidy-mark no -indent --indent-spaces 4 -wrap 0 --new-blocklevel-tags article,header,footer --new-inline-tags video,audio,canvas,ruby,rt,rp --doctype \"<!DOCTYPE HTML>\" --break-before-br yes --sort-attributes alpha --vertical-space yes\nand it doesn't even work. (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2657658/wanted-command-line-html5-beautifier)\n. Thanks for catching this. It's fixed in my trunk, and I'll push a minor release to pypi soon.\nI just adjusted the encoding of the html file as it went into princeXML.\n. I like the solution of just editing the default theme and creating a new one. This seems simpler to me.\nIt would be great if you could push that extra theme to me and I'll add it to the core distribution.\nAm I understanding correctly?\n. May I include your extra theme in landslide 0.8? I'll figure out the abstraction for theme inheritance in 0.9 or 1.0.\nYou can either update your repository to mine, commit the theme, and push it to me, or I can grab the theme from your repository and commit it myself.\n. I have added your theme and called it \"light\". Also, themes no longer need to include a custom base.html or js/slides.js. If those files are missing, Landslide will use the base.html and js/slides.js from the default theme.\n. Great Idea. I'll do that very soon.\n. I need to do some reading on this and respond.\nThanks for the contribution...Landslide is my first attempt at packaging a python app :)\n. I've just been really busy. I'll try to take a look at it again this afternoon or tomorrow.\nSorry about that.\n. I followed this to package landslide: http://diveintopython3.org/packaging.html\nWas I wrong in doing that? I will play around with your changes to setup.py, but can you explain to me why we should support setuptools and why the files should be renamed as you did?\nThanks...I'm still new at packaging ;)\n. Merged. Many thanks. Sorry for all the delay :)\n. Luckily it was a problem it example2's markup\n. Wow, good catch. I have merged mtryhall's branch so all should be well now.\nThanks!!\n. Done just now. Thanks\n. Aw man how did I miss this? Thanks...\nSo I can ignore Ticket #18?\n. You're right n1k0. I really have a lot to learn about testing. Thanks.\nHandle this stuff in the next few days.\n. Thanks n1k0.\nThis has been fixed in 0.8.1 (just pushed)\n. Yeah, this would be cool. Good find.\nI'll start looking around at how to implement it.\n. Wow this is awesome. I used it but haven't review the code yet. I'll do that before long.\nThanks as always.\n. This is awesome in the main theme. I'll look at porting it to the other themes.\n. I added your expose CSS to the other themes.\nThanks again!!\n. Yeah I was looking last night. I hope to merge everything this weekend.\nYou don't send me pull requests these days ;)\nThanks as always n1k0!!\n. Fixed in master thanks to olivierverdier.\nThanks for reporting this.\n. You sure did. I have merged your branch.\nThanks so much.\n. I am also crediting you in the README.\n. Thanks for the patches, guys.\nn1k0, can you git me an opinion on what to merge? #24? You're better at i18n than I am :)\nthanks\n. I have merged Olivier's branch. \nThank you very much millette, n1k0, and Olivier.\nI'll release 0.8.2 very soon.\n. I found that the help div wasn't hidden on PDF generation, so I wanted to get that fix released as soon as possible. This affected all PDFs.\nI wasn't sure when I'd have time to look at #25 so I went ahead and released 0.8.2. ;)\n. Merged, thanks.\n. Merged. Tanks!\n. I can't make this a priority right now. Someone who knows Windows is going to have to fix this probably.\n. I'm a little confused too. I'm currently review all of this code.\nThanks for the contributions as always!!\n. The code looks great. I am not seeing a safe way to remove those duplicate commits though. Any ideas before I push?\n. Done...I wonder if this is 0.9 worthy? ;)\n. I just implemented support for the :align: directive.\nThe width and height directives work, but you have you put spaces after the image line. Same with :align:.\nThanks for reporting these issues.\n. It looks like the FixImagePaths Macro's regex is a little too pushy. I should have a fix this afternoon.\nI guess I only tested with remote images.\nThanks for reporting this.\n. Ok it should be fixed now.\nThanks\n. I still like having an easily-readable and hopefully-obvious separator for slide.\nThis could be considered when our RST support gets more advanced though.\nThanks!\n. Is that a Restructured Text directive?\nThe table of contents in landslide is built from slide breaks. We are not using ReST specific commands.\nThe ToC generated by rendering samples/example seems to work fine.\n. We do not support the RST Table of Contents directive at this time. Our RST support is just for simple markup.\nMaybe in a later version. Thanks\n. For now we'll just say...do no use directives like sidebar.\nLandslide will only support a subset of ReST for now.\n. Awesome...will merge soon. Thanks\n. Finally merged these changes. Thanks\n. Duplicate \n. Hello. I'm finally ready to merge this, but I'm wondering where you got the theme? Did you make it yourself?\nThanks\n. Awesome. Thanks.\nMerged.\n. Is this the same problem described in issue #39?\n. I just finished implementing this.\nIt works with the -i flag.\nThanks\n. Thanks\n. I merged this but had to make another commit because importing macro messes up variables named macro in generator.py. So I renamed macro.py to macros.py.\nLet me know if you have feedback on this solution.\nAlso feel free to submit a request to have your theme merged. It is nice :)\nThanks\n. Yes, for now I think it would be better to have some kind of config option to include nondefault macros. \nYour change did bring this sort of thing to my attention, which was good.\nWhat do you think?\n. Thanks!\n. This is great!!\nOnce you're done, I'll merge it and cut 1.0. Great work, seriously.\n. Or did you want someone else to finish it?\n. Cool. I'll take a look at the CSS once you're done. No worries. Not that I'm a pro either though... ;)\n'p' would be my first idea for a shortcut key. It's keycode 80.\n. Great, I'm about to merge. One question though.\nDo you intend for markdown content (lists, for instance) to be rendered to presenter notes? I am considering replacing your heading notation with our typical macro or note notation:\n.presenter-notes Blah Blah Blah Blah\nOr something like that. To me, adding a header may confuse things a little. I'm still thinking about it.\nDo you feel strongly either way?\nI didn't encounter that bug in Chrome. I'll look deeper in a bit.\n. Yes, I'd like to move this to a macro as well. I was looking at that the other night. I'll let you know about the refactoring, n1k0. I might have some time early this week.\nI'm mostly concerned with what the input format will look like. Right now I'm leaning toward something like this:\n```\nSlide 1\nHello\nBlah Blah\n.presenter_notes\n\nOne\nTwo\nThree\n\nSlide Two\n```\nThoughts?\n. Oh yes. I forgot the trailing colon ;)\nI'll do it that way. Thanks for the feedback, guys.\n. I like this idea as well. I just merged BestFriendChris' presenter view branch, and now I'll be working on the new macro system.\nHow should we go about including new macros into the rendering of a slideshow? If there's not much overhead, we may as well parse for every macro landslide has (QR codes and all). I do not want a user of landslide to have to touch to the code to enable a macro we ship with.\nn1k0, we talked about about not including the QR macro as default...as we rethink the macro system, how should the user enable it? Or do you also think it should be enabled automatically?\n. I believe Landslide supports this now. Let me know if you have any further problems with it.\n. Yeah, this is a great idea. Could you recommend a python module for landslide to use? I guess the textile module is the obvious choice...\n. I finally added textile support.\nUnfortunately, textile has no way of rendering an  tag, so you'll have to specify those literally to break your slides.\n. Do you mean that you're not able to arbitrarily bring up a keyboard input like on an iPhone? I see what you mean...\nSwiping left and right to change slides works, but I'll see what we can do about detecting your platform and providing a menu.\n. No, you're not missing anything. I agree with you.\nThanks for the docs.\n. I thought I fixed that...thanks.\n. @sdouche I have implemented screen blanking as described and n1k0's page up and page down fix is there as well.\nWhat is freezing?\n. Are you saying that your laser button tells the browser to refresh?\nLandslide has nothing set for key code 63, so I'm a little confused. Maybe you could try to fix it in your fork and submit a pull request?\nWhat model is your pen?\nThanks\n. I'm going to close this issue. Please reopen it if anything changes with the pen.\nThanks!\n. I'm hoping to improve templating a lot in v2.0. \n. Your commits undo each other as blocke said, but thanks for reporting the issue. I'll take a look at it.\n. I fixed presenter notes in the tango and light themes.\n. On a Mac, the open command opens a file in it's associated application, so calling open an an html file would open it a web browser.\nSince you are on linux, you should just open presentation.html in a web browser or use some other command line tool if you prefer.\nUs putting open in the README is just a cool Mac trick ;)\nSorry to confuse. Does this help?\n. Thanks!\n. Good points. This will be considered post-1.0.\nThanks!\n. How do they get in the way? Are you seeing something about presenter notes without pressing p?\nIt looks like your patch just takes the title away from the presenter notes box if they're not present. Help me understand.\nThanks!\n. Weird...could you post the markdown source you are using or is it RST?\nThis .md should work, does it?\n```\nLandslide\n\nSomething\n\n1                                                                                                                                                                                  \n2                                                                                                                                                                                  \n\nPresenter Notes\nhi                                                                                                                                                                                   \n\nOverview\nGenerates a slideshow using the slides that power\n```\n. Ah ok, I'll take a look at the RST stuff next.\nThanks!\n. I changed a slide in that presentation to this:\n```\nThe \"formal\" coding dojo                                                                                                                                                       \n========================                                                                                                                                                         \n(or the French way of doing it...)                                                                                                                                               \n\nProcess\n\n2 minutes: decide on date for next session                                                                                                                                     \n25-30 minutes: quick retrospective of the previous session; what went well, what was interesting, what was frustrating                                                         \n10 minutes: decide on a topic for this session                                                                                                                                 \n40 minutes or so: code!

Any ideas?\n. I'm going to close this for now. Please reopen it if you're still having trouble.\nThanks!\n. I don't see the BOM being rendered in the test file you sent me. Can you explain a little more maybe? Or include a screenshot?\nAlso, wouldn't codecs.BOM be a better way to do this?\nThanks!\n. I'm still having trouble reproducing this error. I don't see anything in my editor or in the rendered presentation. I diffed a presentation output file with and without your patch that was made with your test.md file, and I got no differences.\nI have only tested on a macbook thus far. Thanks for your patience.\n. I'm not seeing an attached zip on your email.\n. I got your attachment and I can see the problem now. Thanks for being patient with me.\n. Fixed, thanks.\n. Good catch, Thanks!\n. Thanks!!\n. I think this is a good idea.\nFeel free to go ahead and implement this with a -w flag. Hopefully we can get it in before 1.0.\nThanks!\nOh, and it'd be cool to hear more about how you're using landslide in your course. My email address is on my github page\n. I hope to have 1.0 tagged and on pypi this weekend.\n. And that presentation looks awesome! Thanks for sharing.\n. Discussion moved to #71\n. I just pushed a temporary fix for this, so you should be good.\nStill trying to solve it...it looks like the javascript is moving the last slide's presenter_notes div out from under the slide div to the slides div when there is a certain type of code block present maybe?\nWe'll see.\n. Same here!\nThanks\n. Wow, I bet it would have taken me forever to catch this.\nThanks!\n. I was hoping to get 1.0 up there this weekend. I have some goals to accomplish before I make another real release.\nI'll probably have it on pypi this weekend regardless.\nThanks\n. What does it mean to use Landslide on app engine? Hosting presentations or rendering them?\nI've never used app engine, so maybe I'm missing something.\n. I'm trying to decide whether we should require watchdog or make it optional.\nMaybe if they try the -w flag, it would try to import watchdog and upon a failure, tell them to install it.\nWhat do you think? I guess I'm hesitant to add watchdog as a dependency (along with its many dependencies). Maybe I'm wrong.\n. Whenever I save my .md file in vim, I immediately get this from the watch process:\n```\n\u25cb ./main.py -w ~/Desktop/landslide_test/test.md\nAdding   /Users/adam/Desktop/landslide_test/test.md (markdown)\nGenerated file: presentation.html\nWatching /Users/adam/Desktop/landslide_test/test.md\nAdding   /Users/adam/Desktop/landslide_test/test.md (markdown)Generated file: presentation.html\nWatching /Users/adam/Desktop/landslide_test/test.md\nException in thread Thread-2:Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.2/lib/python2.7/threading.py\", line 552, in bootstrap_inner\n    self.run()\n  File \"/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/watchdog/observers/api.py\", line 192, in run\n    self.queue_events(self.timeout)\n  File \"/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/watchdog/observers/kqueue.py\", line 686, in queue_events\n    self.watch.is_recursive)\n  File \"/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/watchdog/utils/dirsnapshot.py\", line 227, in __init\n    stat_info = os.stat(self._path)\nOSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/Users/adam/Desktop/landslide_test/test.md'\n```\nAny ideas? Maybe it's me.\n. I tried smultron, and it's not seeing the changes...weird.\nWhich editor are you using?\nI'll play with this more tonight. I'm probably missing something.\n. I used your code as starting point and finally implemented this...a year later.\nThanks!\n. Merged #93\nThanks\n. I'll do some testing with it today. Thanks!\n. I am fixing this with the suggestion by @millette.\nPlease open a separate pull request for the notes problem.\nThanks!\n. How can I reproduce this?\nThanks\n. Good catch. I was able to reproduce this by trying the -o option with \u2665 as slide content. It's odd that I didn't think to try that sooner. Oh well...\nThanks again!\n. I think the previous behavior might correct.\nTry with this example:\n```\nSlide\nI am a normal line\nI am indented\n\n!python\nx = 'first python line'\na = x\n\nI too am a normal line\n!python\ny = 'second python line'\nb = y\n\n```\nIf an indented block starts with a non code block, we can't assume the whole thing should be a code block.\nI guess a more robust solution would be for the code highlighting macro to not pick up a normal indented block. I'll look into that.\nLet me know what you think.\n. I will add author support to the default theme in v2.\n. The extra Presenter Notes pages are now hidden on pdf export in the master brach.\nPictures in PDFs retain their color. What is missing? The simple code block colors are intentional. Reopen this issue if you want to discuss further.\nI'll look into wkhtmltopdf, but it may be a while before our pdf generator changes for Landslide.\nThanks for the feedback!\n. I cannot reproduce this\n. Good catch, but I'm trying to decide if we should use \"Untitled\", a blank/space, or something else...a dash?\n\n\n\nThoughts?\n. Agreed and thanks again!\n. Did this happen from the pypi version (1.0.0)?\nIt should be fixed in master. I'll cut a new release (1.0.1) soon.\n. I'll updated it on PyPi soon. Sorry about that. It should work in master.\n. I've updated Landslide on pypi.\nhttp://pypi.python.org/pypi/landslide/1.0.1\nDid that help?\n. Thanks for the pull request!\nHowever, this adds a bit too complex for my tastes. Maybe one day I can make it easy to include external macros. \n. Thanks!\n. Yeah, generating and installing man pages seems a bit hairy. I'm closing this issue for now since running landslide or main.py with no arguments should be sufficient.\nThanks for the useful links and suggestion though.\n. Is suppressing all ReST errors acceptable behavior?\n. Yeah, I just supressed all ReST rendering errors.\nThanks\n. The current method seems to work fine. If you have some reasoning as to why it should work in the way you have suggested, please reopen the ticket and let me know.\nThanks!\n. Wow, this is great. Not sure why it's taken me 10 months to merge. Sorry about that.\nThanks!\n. Thanks!\n. I have linked to the python markdown extensions documentation in the README.\nYou have to pass in the extension name, so pass in abbr to get markdown.extensions.abbr loaded.\nI think loading them all could be problematic as some users might experience unexpected behavior with their markup. They are extensions for a reason! :wink: \nThanks!\n. This seems to be fixed in newer versions of Firefox. Let me know if you're still experiencing the problem and if there's something I can do on the Landside end of things.\nThanks!\n. Thanks for reporting this...over three years ago :wink: \n. Good catch! I'll add some blockquote styles to the existing themes.\n. Cool, let me know how it goes. I'd be open to adding click advancing as a command-line switch if you really need it.\nThanks!\n. @metal3d This isn't working for me either. Could you make a sample presentation available?\nMy initial thought is that Landslide should not support this feature unless someone else wants to implement it.\n. Thanks @gdyer!\n. Great, thanks!\n. You are currently able to write presenter notes in presentations formatted in ReST. Like so:\n```\nSlide Title\n===========\nThis is my slide content\nPresenter Notes\nThese are my presenter notes\n```\nOr are you trying to achieve something else with this code?\n. Very true, thanks. The examples really need to be redone.\n. Good catch, thanks!\n. First of all, this is great for your first pull request. Thanks helping with Landslide!\nI'm having trouble reproducing your problem though. If I run src/landslide/main.py -i -t tango samples/example1 from a clean checkout of my repo, the tango theme's background.png theme image is embedded in the output file.\nI'm probably misunderstanding something.\nAlso, when would self.theme_dir ever be False since self.find_theme_dir is called in __init__?\n. Thanks @akrabat and @akrabat. I'm going to merge #126.\n. Not currently. I think you'd need to do that with a custom theme at the moment.\n. I'm not able to reproduce your issue. Here's the file I tested with:\n```\nTesting Link Titles\n\nTest\nGoogle\n```\nPlease reopen this issue if it's still a problem.\nThanks!\n. Yeah, I'd like to add this. I need to integrate the latest version of HTML5Slides. Thanks for the suggestion.\n. I'm hoping to implement this in v2.0 after I deal with existing issues and pull requests then do some cleanup and refactoring.\n. Not at the moment.\nCurrently, centering of the title slide is done with a CSS only-child selector, so it'd be hard to add additional content without significant theme changes.\nThat said, I like the idea. What would the markup look like though?\n. Yes, @durden makes a good point, but for now there is no way. See also #111.\n. What happened here? I wonder why it says you merged a commit into my master branch.\n. I'm pretty sure this is the problem (in utils.py):\npython\ndef get_rel_path_url(path, base_path=os.getcwd()):\n    \"\"\" Returns a relative path from the absolute one passed as argument.\n        Silently returns originally provided path on failure.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        path_url = path.split(base_path)[1]\n        if path_url.startswith('/'):\n            return path_url[1:]\n        else:\n            return path_url\n    except (IndexError, TypeError):\n        return path\n. Oh! I didn't see your suggestion, but that's how I fixed it in 62fcba3a :smile: \nThanks!\n. Thanks!\n. I went with Watchdog.\n. Thanks :)\n. Thanks for the pull request. Could you make it into one commit and resubmit?\n. Thanks! I guess this was blocking lexers like c# or html+django\nGood catch!\n. Could you paste in a sample Markdown or ReST file that reproduces the error for me?\nAlso, are you using a custom theme?\nThanks\n. Thanks for the example. I believe I understand your problem now.\nI think it's best to leave the solution to be a workaround. I don't think it's wise to make a special case in the markdown parsing part of landslide for this.\nYou have two options:\n- The underscore workaround\n- Wrapping your mathjax code in <div></div> (this may require some styling, which could be added to the default theme or to your custom theme)\nDoes this sound ok?\n. Good catch. Thanks!\n. Thanks! We should talk more about what you're doing with avalanche. Very cool\n. Thanks!\n. I really like this, but it makes Landslide huge (312K to 5.5M). I'll be thinking about it.\nThanks!\n. Yeah, Google Web Fonts would be great. If you could make that change, I'll worry about any other size issues.\nAlso, do you think we need the scss files?\n. Yeah, I'm good with offline getting some nice defaults.\n. Great, thanks. Have you contacted the author of shower about doing this? I think we're ok on the licensing side of things.\n. Cool. We'll wait until the end of the week to hear from him before merging then. I want to cut a release with this theme included this weekend.\nLet me know what you hear Thanks again.\n. Does that mean we should add shower's license file in the themes/ribbon/ directory?\n. Hooray!\nThanks for all of your work!\n. I merged your pull request. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Hello,\nIt seems that this has more to do with Markdown than Landslide. Perhaps you could add some normal text between the list and the code? Or put a &nbsp; between the two.\nGithub does it too:\n- item 1\n- item 2\n!python\n  import os\n  os.listdir()\nvs.\n- item 1\n- item 2\nsome text\n!python\nimport os\nos.listdir()\n. This has already been added. See the following:\nhttps://github.com/adamzap/landslide/blob/master/src/landslide/generator.py#L113\nhttps://github.com/adamzap/landslide/blob/master/src/landslide/generator.py#L441-443\nThanks though! I'll cut a release soon.\n. Yeah, I cut a bad release. I'm about to push a fix up.\nSorry about that.\n. I've fixed the problem and pushed a new version to pypi.\nLet me know if you still have problems.\n. Great job on this theme!\nI wonder if it would better for you to keep in it's own repository on your account due to it's size and how different it is from the default theme. I can link to it.\n. Sorry I never got back to you on this!\nYou could create a new repository just for this new theme, and I'll link to it in Landslide's readme.\nThanks!\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. I've integrated the presenter notes change and credited you in the CHANGELOG.\nI hope to come back to the copy_theme changes later.\nThanks!\n. Ah ok. Glad you got it figured out :smile: \n. Thanks for the pull request!\nWhat's the harm in embedding an empty JS file if the user has explicitly asked for embedding?\n. I'm going to close this for now. Landslide now has better support for MathJax on the master branch.\nIf you try that and are still having trouble with MathJax, open a new issue and we'll see what we can do.\n. Thanks for the patch.\nThe default ReST math rendering is working, but I think the MathJax approach is breaking due to ReST's HTML preprocessing.\nThis can work for markdown though. I'll make a few adjustments after merging.\n. This is awesome!\nThanks\n. Is there anyway I can confirm that this works with Leap Motion and should be included in Landslide? I don't own the device.\nThanks!\n. That would be great.\nAdam Zapletal\nOn Aug 24, 2013, at 1:02 AM, Izar Tarandach notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nFirst of all, thank you so much for your hard work with landslide - it is \nawesome! \nIf it helps any I can make a quick movie of it working, how about that? \nOn Aug 23, 2013 10:25 PM, \"Adam Zapletal\" notifications@github.com wrote: \n\nIs there anyway I can confirm that this works with Leap Motion and should \nbe included in Landslide?

Awesome, thanks!\n. Sure, I'm open to a pull request.\nThanks!\n. Thanks for this work and sorry for the delay in my response.\nThe relative imports break on Python 2.7. Any idea how to fix that?\n. You're right. I've fallen way behind on python packaging and testing. Also I've never touched python3.\nCould you squash you commits into one?\n. Great, thanks :+1: \n. Thanks for the pull request, but I think the RST directives are a bit out of the scope of Landslide. You can always use the .. raw:: html directive to embed multimedia things.\n. I think it's ok the way it is.\nMarkdown wraps images in a <p>, but restructured text does not.\n. What would the source for that look like? I mean how would you specify it in your slides?\nCould you give an example input?\n. I'm unable to reproduce this. It works for the example for me.\nCould you paste some breaking restructured text so I can debug it?\nThanks\n. Reopen this ticket if you're still having problems\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks for the pull request!\nHowever, I think it's to much of an edge case for the user to want to switch line number styles mid-presentation. \n. Thanks for the pull request, but this is too much to merge at one time!\nI'll try to incorporate some of your fixes over time.\n. Thanks, but I don't use travis-ci\n. I removed it before closing your PR :wink: \n. Thanks for reporting this problem and offering a solution.\nI'm going to fix it by simplifying the regex to look for url() in the page that contains an image extension.\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. I'll revisit this in v2.\nThanks for the PR!\n. Which version are you running? Did you download it from pypi or did you clone it from GitHub?\nThanks for the report\n. I think the issue is that I haven't cut a release since #158 was merged.\nI'll try to do that soon. Your problem would probably be solved if you used a version cloned from github in the meantime. \n. I finally cut a release!\nv1.1.2 is now on PyPI\n. I'm having trouble reproducing this issue. Could you post an example source file that where it happens?\n. Reopen this ticket if you're still having problems\n. This is a great idea, but it looks like CSS expressions are deprecated and were only supported by Internet Explorer anyway:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/6191679/css-expressions\nI appreciate your pull request though!\n. I'm unable to reproduce this with a fresh install on both Python 2 and 3.\nPlease reopen this issue if the problem persists.\nThanks!\n. @ztzt How did you install Landslide?\n. It seems to be a problem with your python or pip installation. Would you consider switching to homebrew and see if it works? http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/\n. Thanks for the bug report!\n. Every markdown-based slideshow generator has to make decisions on how to interpret the markup to output a slideshow instead of plain HTML.\nI hope the design decisions I've made for Landslide make sense. For instance, Landslide interprets the markup that generates an <hr> as a slide separator.\nI've always gone back to John Gruber's Markdown Syntax Guide as the authority on what markdown is. On top of that, I just pass text into python's markdown module.\nI understand your frustration. Markdown-based slideshow generation is a crowded space these days.\n. Reopen this ticket if you're still having problems\n. Run landslide -m on an .rst file containing this:\n```\nMathJax Test\n============\n\\[ \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \\right)^2 \\]\n```\nIt works for me. Does it work for you?\n. That's odd.\nYou can try the -b flag, but I'm not sure that it will help.\nThe best thing to do is probably to look at the generated HTML file and debug from there.\n. Reopen this ticket if you're still having problems\n. Thanks for the PR!\nCould you explain how this improves things and which problems you're having? Landslide doesn't really support mobile yet.\nWhich device are you on?\n. I'm going to close this for now since there should be much better touch support in v2.\nThanks!\n. You're referring to the master branch, right?\nDo you have any suggestions? Maybe put statements like from .generator import Generator in __init__.py?\n. I believe I have fixed the themes directory issue. I can generate presentations after installing via setup.py.\nCould you grab master and try?\nThanks!\n. Awesome!\nI'll close the issue then.\nI'm curious though why you installed with setup.py instead of pip.\n. Got it, thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. @htaslan I am able to use landslide with non-ASCII characters without your patch.\nDid you close this pull request because you discovered the same thing?\n. I'm having trouble reproducing this. Which operating system are you on?\n. Run landslide with -x tables to enable the markdown extension for rendering tables.\nFor example: landslide -x tables slides.md\nSee the markdown documentation here: https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/tables.html\n. Your theme should inherit from the default theme...or did you delete it?\nAlso, you could add a blank screen.css file in your theme directory. That's a simple way to bypass it.\n. @vbauer Let me know if you need any more help\n. That's a great idea. Maybe with this? https://github.com/google/py-gfm\nThanks!\n. Fenced code blocks will work when I release v2!\n. - Which version are you using?\n- Can you provide a file that causes it to fail?\n. Closing until a response is received \n. @luwenhegithub Could you provide a file that I can run through Landslide to reproduce the problem?\n. Could you post the input file that generated this error?\n. I'll reopen this if I get more information\n. Thanks for the pull request. Could you provide a slideshow that shows the behavior you are attempting to fix here?\n. This will be fixed when I release v2.\nThanks for reporting!\n. Thanks for the pull request!\nI like your approach here, but I'm in the middle of a full rewrite of Landslide. I'll be happy to integrate this idea (and a much better macro/plugin system) soon after I'm done.\n. Yeah, I think you'd need to write custom CSS for that right now. However, I like the idea of adding a few simply utility classes like center to the default theme.\n. Could you provide an input file that exhibits #188?\n. Thanks for the PR. I'll try to reproduce and test this soon.\nBy the way, you can pass a tuple to isinstance instead of using or, like isinstance('a', (str, int)).. ",

For the record, the --encoding option was added to set the encoding of the source file, not the resulting one (OK the doc of the task should be rewritten). But I can't see anybody wanting iso-\\d+ based presentations, as utf-8 will cover everything he needs natively.\n\nAlso, utf-8 is a correct value for html, but AFAICR utf8 is the value used to set the character encoding for python codecs.open function. Here the patch could break things...\nAdam and others, thoughts?\n. Okay interesting, if we could provide clean and transparent I/O encoding transformation, it would be great! (but in my own experience, this usually turns into a nightmare ;))\nI'll investigate\u2026\n. You can safely merge Olivier's branch (I merged it into my own one btw, works like a charm) :)\nNow looking after 0.8.2 ;)\n. There are some tickets remaining, especially #25 looks annoying, we should probably investigate on it before releasing :)\n. Thank you for reporting, we'll take care of this asap\n. I've just added support for it in my fork, check it out\n. just for information I've added support for more standard ways to declare colored code blocks with ReST in my branch, which has been proposed as a pull request\n. I didn't know there was a \"standard\" :/\nI don't personally use ReST, so a good idea would probably to leave the feature be implemented by someone who actually uses it :-)\n. I agree, this is cleaner. And both syntaxes can probably live together... :)\n. +1 for supporting both names (plus generic cross-compatible landslide syntax)\n. I just sent a new pull request to address the issue. Give it a look.\n. Could you check my branch to see if the problem is gone? I fixed several issues and possibly the one you raise here.\n. Hmm, I realize that many things are provided in these commits\u2026 as they're mainly fixes, I don't think this will be much a problem though.\n. just realized that every commit I'm making from my branch is now published in this thread, and I can't really see the point\u2026 I should definitely make a dedicated branch for each feature I'm working on to avoid this behavior, even if I find it somewhat painful.\n. Just merge my branch as I already fixed many of the problem encountered :)\nDon't forget to run the test suite before tagging and releasing tho ;)\n. I don't think so, as it ships mainly bugfixes and makes things work as they were supposed to :)\n. I understand what you're trying to achieve, but I'm not really sure it's in the scope of Landslide \u2014 which is \"just\" a presentation generator, like PPT or Keynote are. Would you ever think producing a thesis using Powerpoint? ;)\nBut that's my point of view, others may have other opinions?\n. Use of a separator allows to manage slide separation and the amount of information you want or can display on each one\u2026 This definitely makes sense in a presentation context, while I guess we could introduce an alternative, less semantically obstrusive separator syntax like say .. slide in ReST or ![slide] in Markdown.\nWhat do others think?\n. I'm very tempted to get rid of ReST support reading all the \"features\" it supports. Will be a bunch of painful work to adapt them all to landslide.\nThoughts? Volunteers? Opinions?\n. Sounds good. Well, who?\n. Okay, I'm happy if we got somebody seeing value in this and possibly working on it :)\n. fixed in my \"fork\" https://github.com/n1k0/landslide\n. As I just said in the inline code comment above, I really think the whole presenter stuff should be handled by a dedicated Macro. I think the Generator class is bloated enough for now ;)\nIf you agree, I can help with refactoring the code if needed.\nAwesome work and great feature anyway, can't wait to see it merged =)\n. I would personaly keep the trailing colon to keep a bit of consistency, eg. .presenter_notes:\n. I was wondering nearly the same reading the mentioned conversation, so a big +1 for a Macro system refactoring. At the time I wrote it, I didn't expect landslide to become what it is now ;)\nI like very much the refactoring approach you describe, so you got a big +1 here. My only concerns is backward compatibility and QA, so we should ensure to have sufficient tests to ensure we won't break everything for existing presentations :)\n. The more I think about landslide the more I can't imaging working with it without a config file. Adding a new setting with the list of macro to load would just be the way to go imho, while I can't really imagine passing the macro names in some command line option\u2026\nLast, +1000 for allowing the use of any macro which comply to the standard interface, wherever they are.\n. I'm not sure macros should be tied to the theme concept. IMHO theming is much more about presentation than effective feature, and macros provide features (or at least, processing)\u2026\nDefinitely a tough question.\n. Hmmm you highlight a point I think I missed while designing landslide as it is now: the distinction between a /project/ and a /theme/\u2026 I'll have to think a bit more about this\n. As a side note, what do you think about the possibility of importing macros through the config.cfg file, eg:\n[landslide]\nsource = slides/\nmacros = macros.MyMacro\n         macros.OtherMacro\nSo you could have a project structure like this:\nproject/\n    slides/\n        0_intro.md\n        1_conclusion.md\n    config.cfg\n    macros.py\nWith of course some kind of import function smart enough to resolve the macro class paths a bit like how Django does.\nThis could overcome part of the the problem you're raising here\u2026 Thoughts?\n. Did you see the personal user javascripts and stylesheets feature in my fork? I think it could provide a decent solution for the use case you describe.\n. We should have a decent API and usage documentation, eg. one powered by sphinx. I started something in docs/ on my fork, but it's far from being complete atm.\n. fixed in my fork\n. okay, only PgUp and PgDown handling are fixed, your \"pen\" stuff isn't =)\nI'm on it.\n.

I would personaly keep the trailing colon to keep a bit of consistency, eg. .presenter_notes:\n. I was wondering nearly the same reading the mentioned conversation, so a big +1 for a Macro system refactoring. At the time I wrote it, I didn't expect landslide to become what it is now ;)\nI like very much the refactoring approach you describe, so you got a big +1 here. My only concerns is backward compatibility and QA, so we should ensure to have sufficient tests to ensure we won't break everything for existing presentations :)\n. The more I think about landslide the more I can't imaging working with it without a config file. Adding a new setting with the list of macro to load would just be the way to go imho, while I can't really imagine passing the macro names in some command line option\u2026\nLast, +1000 for allowing the use of any macro which comply to the standard interface, wherever they are.\n. I'm not sure macros should be tied to the theme concept. IMHO theming is much more about presentation than effective feature, and macros provide features (or at least, processing)\u2026\nDefinitely a tough question.\n. Hmmm you highlight a point I think I missed while designing landslide as it is now: the distinction between a /project/ and a /theme/\u2026 I'll have to think a bit more about this\n. As a side note, what do you think about the possibility of importing macros through the config.cfg file, eg:\n[landslide]\nsource = slides/\nmacros = macros.MyMacro\n         macros.OtherMacro\nSo you could have a project structure like this:\nproject/\n    slides/\n        0_intro.md\n        1_conclusion.md\n    config.cfg\n    macros.py\nWith of course some kind of import function smart enough to resolve the macro class paths a bit like how Django does.\nThis could overcome part of the the problem you're raising here\u2026 Thoughts?\n. Did you see the personal user javascripts and stylesheets feature in my fork? I think it could provide a decent solution for the use case you describe.\n. We should have a decent API and usage documentation, eg. one powered by sphinx. I started something in docs/ on my fork, but it's far from being complete atm.\n. fixed in my fork\n. okay, only PgUp and PgDown handling are fixed, your \"pen\" stuff isn't =)\nI'm on it.\n. ",

    "BestFriendChris": "Nope. I'm fine doing it. The only thing is my CSS skills suck, so I could probably use some help getting the presenter view to look nice, especially on other browsers.\nOne thing. What would be a good shortcut key for it? I did '4' mostly because I couldn't be bothered to look up keycodes. :-)\n. Here you go. It's not the prettiest bell at the ball, but it seems to work well.\nOne odd problem I ran into is on Chrome (on my mac) it is automatically sending the keydown event to the new window. I wanted 'p' to toggle the presenter view in both windows, but with this bug it closes immediately after opening. Not sure what's happening. For now I just ignore the event from the presenter view, so you have to close it manually. Not a big deal, but I thought you might have some ideas.\n. Yeah, that was my intention. At work we tend to have a lot of content in the presenter notes. Having the entirety of markdown (for lists, headers, code, etc) is way useful. That being said, we definitely don't need it to be a header. Anything we can use as a marker to differentiate between the slide and the notes section would work.\n. The only reason I didn't go the Macro route was because it seemed wrong to include the presenter notes within the 'inner' content div (much like how the footer exists outside of that div as well). Maybe a more generic solution would be to have the Macro (or a different type of Macro) support taking & returning the slide_vars directly. That way it could return a new 'presenter_notes' var and remove it from the 'content' var.\nIf you don't think it's a big deal no include it in the 'inner' div, let me know. I could probably be convinced of that fairly easily.\nThoughts?\n. Looks good to me.\n. I think there are 2 things we could do related to choosing macros:\n- Move all the optional macros (like QR) to the themes directory (as per issue #45). If you don't what a particular macro, you could just make your own theme.\n- Add another setting to the config file that is a list of macro files to load.\nEither one would also solve the other goal I have: be able to write new macros without having to commit to the landslide codebase\n. The problem is that sometimes a macro has an impact on layout. Take the presenter view as an example. That required additions to the HTML, CSS, and JS.\nAnother example: I put my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in a landslide slideshow (http://bestfriendchris.github.com/resume). I'd like to add a macro that has first level slides be laid out vertically while sub-slides be laid out horizontally. I don't really believe this belongs in stock landslide, but I'd like to include it in my own project. This will definitely require HTML, CSS, & JS changes...\n. Nope. I'm fine doing it. The only thing is my CSS skills suck, so I could probably use some help getting the presenter view to look nice, especially on other browsers.\nOne thing. What would be a good shortcut key for it? I did '4' mostly because I couldn't be bothered to look up keycodes. :-)\n. Here you go. It's not the prettiest bell at the ball, but it seems to work well.\nOne odd problem I ran into is on Chrome (on my mac) it is automatically sending the keydown event to the new window. I wanted 'p' to toggle the presenter view in both windows, but with this bug it closes immediately after opening. Not sure what's happening. For now I just ignore the event from the presenter view, so you have to close it manually. Not a big deal, but I thought you might have some ideas.\n. Yeah, that was my intention. At work we tend to have a lot of content in the presenter notes. Having the entirety of markdown (for lists, headers, code, etc) is way useful. That being said, we definitely don't need it to be a header. Anything we can use as a marker to differentiate between the slide and the notes section would work.\n. The only reason I didn't go the Macro route was because it seemed wrong to include the presenter notes within the 'inner' content div (much like how the footer exists outside of that div as well). Maybe a more generic solution would be to have the Macro (or a different type of Macro) support taking & returning the slide_vars directly. That way it could return a new 'presenter_notes' var and remove it from the 'content' var.\nIf you don't think it's a big deal no include it in the 'inner' div, let me know. I could probably be convinced of that fairly easily.\nThoughts?\n. Looks good to me.\n. I think there are 2 things we could do related to choosing macros:\n- Move all the optional macros (like QR) to the themes directory (as per issue #45). If you don't what a particular macro, you could just make your own theme.\n- Add another setting to the config file that is a list of macro files to load.\nEither one would also solve the other goal I have: be able to write new macros without having to commit to the landslide codebase\n. The problem is that sometimes a macro has an impact on layout. Take the presenter view as an example. That required additions to the HTML, CSS, and JS.\nAnother example: I put my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in a landslide slideshow (http://bestfriendchris.github.com/resume). I'd like to add a macro that has first level slides be laid out vertically while sub-slides be laid out horizontally. I don't really believe this belongs in stock landslide, but I'd like to include it in my own project. This will definitely require HTML, CSS, & JS changes...\n. ",

Could the following not be made to work?\n```\nPresentation Title\n==================\nSubtitle\n\nFirst Slide\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et \ndolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex \nea commodo consequat.\n```\n. This is excellent, thanks.\n. Here is one:\n```\nSimulation\n==========\n\nStochastic Simulation\nWe often want to obtain a simulated result using a model system of interest.\nUsing artificially-generated random numbers, we can generate realizations of data that would be expected under a particular model.\nInput: $\\mathbf{X}_i = (X_{1i}, \\ldots, X_{ki})$\nOutput: $\\mathbf{Y}_i = h(\\mathbf{X}_i)$\nAnalysis: \n$$Pr(h(\\mathbf{X}) \\le b) \\approx \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N I(h(\\mathbf{X}_i) \\le b)$$\n$$E(h(\\mathbf{X})) \\approx \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N h(\\mathbf{X}_i)$$\n```\nIf you remove the backslash from the second-last equation, you get the behavior that I observed.
