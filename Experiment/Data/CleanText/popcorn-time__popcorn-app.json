Awesome!\n. BTW, @nicoandrade , quer\u00e9s agregar algo para la #15 mientras terminamos la nueva descripci\u00f3n? El code lo ten\u00e9s en la sidebar (est\u00e1 comentado).\n. We've already included it! (we used the pastebin link). It's on pt.json and will be available on the next release. Thanks for the translation!\n. Thanks for adding the portuguese subs!\n. Thanks for the change!\n. Merged! It'll be available on the next release. Thanks for the translation!\n. It's just been fixed in another pull request. Thanks anyway!\n. Thanks for translating the installer! We'll get started on the other languages as well, but this will be available on the next Beta.\n. Te pasaste :D\n. Thanks for the translation! It'll be available on the next release.\n. Thanks for the fix!\n. Thanks for the changes!\n. @abadfederico , this one's all yours.\n. Had to do a manual merge since it clashed with quite a few things. Included your changes and also split app.scss into more manageable modules. Let me know if everything looks right (and feel free to move modules that don't quite fit).\n. Hi Gabriel, Thanks for the cleanup! I have a few comments to make:\nSome of the packages (superagent and peerflix) require quite a few modifications in order to work properly, specially since peerflix is not being maintained anymore and has some seriously outdated dependencies. That's why we put node_modules in the repo, so you can run the app without fiddling with a ton of packages. The right way of doing this, of course, is to refactor the code and put those customized packages outside node_modules, which we haven't done yet.\nThe same goes for node-webkit, as it requires a very specific .dll / .so to run videos. This is less of a PITA, but it simplifies the build process a lot.\nREADME also is outdated, as we're using node-webkit v 0.9.2, which fixes a huge issue with CPU usage.\n. Thanks for the change! Somehow I forgot to add the languages in the .iss file.\n. Thanks for adding the extra subs! The next release will be coming very soon.\n. Thanks for the translation!\n. That was a great improvement over the previous system! It was just merged into master and will be released on the next beta. Thanks a lot!\n. We've included your changes in the repo, but it was faster to redo it than solve the merge conflicts, so we gave you a shout in the commit instead. Thanks!\n. Thanks for he translation! It'll be available On The next release.\n. Thanks! We had to hurry up with Beta 2 so we left a few translation issues in our wake. This'll go on the next release.\n. I'm checking the original .isl file and it doesn't seem to have encoding issues (in UTF-8). I do see some changes regarding languages though, but I want to know what's being fixed.\nCan you limit this PR just to the installer? The open effect no longer applies (we completely redesigned the movie details view, so those modifications are no longer necessary).\nThanks!\n. Nice find! Merged\n. I don't believe we have Japanese subtitles readily available, but we'll add your Japanese translation on the next release. Thanks!\n. Thanks for the portuguese fixes! I'm closing the issue, but welcome any changes in category names, as I see there's a bit of discussion regarding those.\n. Great! This should settle things with the portuguese translation. Thanks!\n. We've commented on this issue on #92 . We had to modify some packages (peerflix and superagent) and we've scheduled a refactor so we can get rid of node_modules.\n. Love the new subs! Thanks!\n. That was fast. Thanks!\n. Great! This helps a lot for the next release\n. Great! This helps a lot for the next release\n. Great! This helps a lot for the next release\n. Great! This helps a lot for the next release\n. Thanks for the translation!\n. Thanks for the bugfix!\n. The language names are of the things that's bugging me. Maybe it's possible to create a basic list with common stuff (like language names, which should be in their original names) and then extend individual languages with that so we don't repeat ourselves. \nDo you want to add this so everything's tidy before the merge?\n. That was fast. Thanks!\n. We have Italian at last! Thanks a lot for the translation.\n. Thanks for the fix!\n. Thanks for the new subs!\n. Thanks for the improvements!\n. Merged! Thanks for the improvements!\n. Thanks for the pull request! We've scheduled the settings panel for Beta 4, and since we're releasing Beta 2.5 today (with many hotfixes) we'll wait until then to add the settings module.\n. Thanks a lot! Those compass line comments were very annoying too.\n. This is probably the best one-liner we have. That was a weird bug. I'll ask for confirmation from the people who reported it. Thanks a lot for the fix!\n. Fantastic! Thanks!\n. Merged! Thanks for the fixes + refactor!\n. That was a great contribution. Thanks a lot for resolving #62!\n. It's a few more (we're changing that in a bit), but some categories don't have many movies that can be streamed without issues.\n. Thanks for the fix! That alert() was really annoying.\n. Hi @uberspot . Can you provide a simpler pull request? (just the .json file). Checking out custom modules makes merging pull requests very time consuming (and we've just gotten rid of all dependencies). Thanks!\n. @uberspot Thanks for the translation! I just went ahead and added the .json file so you don't have to send another PR.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. There's always one more of these to fix. Thanks!\n. Thanks for the translation! It will be available on the next release.\n. Wasn't that fixed on a previous PR? I merged it anyway, but if we needed a second fix there might be something else going on with that file.\n. Thanks for the fix and tiny refactor!\n. Thanks for the translation! We'll add it on the next release.\n. @gutigen thanks for translating the app! We'll release this on the next version.\n. We're getting a ton of translations today. Thanks! This'll go on the next release.\n. That's a great find! We got one report of this previously, but as it seems to happen on very specific platforms and we couldn't replicate it, this should help with that. Thanks for the fix!\n. This is great! Marked #6 as fixed and we'll release this on Beta 3.\n. Te puedo aceptar startingDownload y horror en particular. Las otras son muy localizadas para nuestro gusto (y tampoco podemos dividir en es-es, es-ar, etc, a diferencia de Brazil con el Portugu\u00e9s). Cre\u00e1s otra PR con esos dos?\n. Careful with the JS linter. The comma at the end is not allowed in proper JSON.\n. @HeyTech I added it manually since we couldn't do a straight merge. Thanks!\n. I added it manually since it's simpler than merging. Thanks!\n. We're going to add a license when we figure out exactly which ones we can use and what's the best one, since this is something we have to research and we're quite busy focusing on the product right now. Thanks for the PR anyway!\n. @mccraveiro I added a few of these changes manually since we couldn't do a simple merge (there were a few conflicting pull requests). Thanks!\n. @vinkla Thanks for the changes! Make sure you don't leave trailing commas, as that causes issues when reading raw json.\n. Thanks for the translation! We'll add it on the next release.\n. Thanks! We'll add it on the next release.\n. Thanks! We'll add it on the next release.\n. Somehow we missed a few languages. We'll add them in a bit. Thanks!\n. @P0ssi merged it manually (both PRs). Thanks!\n. @hamecoded We just merged another one. You can modify the existing translation if you see anything out of place. Thanks!\n. We've already merged this pull request. Thanks @Nirlah!\n. Great! We'll release this on the next version.\n. @smoky-jr we merged #366, but modifications and improvements are welcome (though you should check with other users so this doesn't become a pull-request-fight)\n. @P0ssi be careful with the linter. Trailing commas are not valid in json.\n. Thanks! Subtitles are loaded in a different module (now it's on js/frontend/player.js). That's the list of supported subittles.\n. Thanks for the translation!\n. Thanks! Seeing that you're at this, can you add pagination on the popular page? It now covers pretty much every film on the list and it would be a good improvement.\n. That affected the design quite a bit. Thanks!\n. Thanks anyway!\n. Awesome! Thanks!\n. Thanks @razzer77!\n. @EvandroZanatta We did a fix with underscore's .isEmpty() . Thanks for the report!\n. @jpalumickas thanks for both PRs!\n. @Nirlah awesome. We get a lot of language PRs and it's very hard to figure out which ones are the most accurate, so we usually just merge them in order. Thanks!\n. @danielhusar great job! We'll add this on the next release.\n. @DirectorX I accepted the @Nirlah one. If there are any outstanding issues, feel free to talk them out and send a PR our way. Thanks!\n. @luuse you make a good point. This should help a small subset of developers. Thanks!\n. Cool, thanks!\n. @hunscream We just added hungarian support. Thanks! You can take a look at the current translation and send a PR if you want.\n@hugodias You're probably on the wrong ticket, but that's an issue we are fixing, as the differences between Brazilian and Portugal's Portuguese were more marked than we assumed when adding subtitles.\n. @1ace we just wanted to add that. Thanks!\n. @zeppelin Great job, guys! That's one of the most extensive translations I've seen yet. Merged and we'll use it on the next release.\n. @neuromancer I can't accept this, as it's an important part of our product right now (telemetry helps us find issues with the app that aren't reported). However, we are adding a way to disable tracking on the next release, which should fix this issue in a better way. Thanks!\n. Much appreciated. Thanks!\n. @WikiDZe we changed all language files to two spaces. Can you change just the modified line and resubmit? This makes the merge a bit more complicated otherwise. Thanks!\n. @thefuture2092 Thanks for the change!\n. @zbrox @gsamokovarov Thanks for the translation!\n. @tlqmj Great fix! Thanks!\n. @LightDust Thanks for the fix! That's something we wanted to add (lots of 4-star movies otherwise)\n. Thanks for the bugfix / correction!\n. @wilhelmmatilainen Thanks for the translation! We'll add it on the next release.\n. @ivantodorovich Loved the feature -and complementary refactor- (a ton of people have been requesting that feature for a while). Thanks a lot for this PR!\n. Thanks for the fix!\n. @web93onv Thanks for the translation! We'll use it on the next release.\n. We just got it merged from another pull request.\n. @cimox Thanks!\n. @LuckyThirteen This is a good idea. Thanks!\n. We're merging this one just to get this out of the way. Thanks!\n. @HeyTech You have to modify the SCSS in the .scss file and then run _compass compile on the root folder of the project to update the .css. It'll get overwritten otherwise. Thanks!\n. #528 should have fixed this issue. Thanks! We can reopen this if the issue persists.\n. This is a surprising oversight from our part. Thanks!\n. We might make this into a setting, but it's a very strong default to ship with the app. Thanks anyway!\n. @axot Can you translate the disclaimer as well? That should make for a complete translation. Thanks!\n. @azot we merged another pull request. Feel free to resubmit if you have any changes.\n. @Jackmoo Awesome! The InnoSetup guys would probably love this as well, so you should throw them a PR too. Regarding the .json files for translations, they are always in lowercase for compatibility.\nIf it's not too much to ask:\n- Rename the file to Chinese.isl so it's consistent with the other languages.\n- Just translating the lines we use for the installer is enough for now. We're releasing a new Beta in a few days, so the sooner we get this in the better.\n. @Jackmoo You can try TraditionalChinese.isl / SimplifiedChinese.isl, which is what we're doing with Portuguese and it seems to work well. Thanks!\n. @Jackmoo Merged! Thanks a lot for this translation, it was a ton of work and we really appreciate it! You should try sending it to the InnoSetup guys, who'll be more than happy to merge it into their github as well.\n. @mzgcz Already done!\n. @samccone Quick question: How well does this work and which issues does it fix/improve? (For instance the Popular > Other Category > Popular flow ruins the popular page right now, which is due to what we call the Pages Clusterfuck).\nWe're working to get the issues to a more manageable level ASAP and reviewing pull requests for quality takes a very long time, so this would be of huge help. Thanks!\n. @samccone Thanks a lot! Also I've seen you added the fix for the Windows 8.1 crash, which is very nice as well.\n. @montogeek Thanks for fixing the issue!\n. @pvieito Great small fix!\n. @trakais Thanks for the new translation!\n. Great! we'll wait until the next fix before merging.\n. ",

Yes, that would be the best but I can't see a way to do this with JSON files.\n. Yes but it would be separated from the i18n module which only works with JSON files I think.\nBut after all why not, since this is no translation anymore, why would we want to let them in the language section... We could have a custom JSON file with those language names string and load them via a custom method rather than using i18n.\n. Should I do that then? Or do you want to merge and do it later on your own?\n.

But regardless the port is still blocked by a lot of firewalls so it they won't be able to build it as it is now :)\n. @zachlatta the git protocol doesn't run on port 22, it runs on port 9418. SSH runs on port 22 but it never used SSH.\nWhile i mainly refer to corporate firewalls where Popcorn Time probably never will be built to begin with using HTTPS doesn't cause any problems and adds some security (the server will be verified with tls). Is there anything concrete about it you don't like?\n. @1ace yeah, sorry, that's my bad :/. Had forgotten to make it git+https. NPM thinks it's regular tarballs now. I made a new pull request that fixes that. The popcornflix/peerflix problem seems to be related to 10bba98cba5a2884d97b23a914ba1d8f6093bb48 though?\n. I've added support for linux32 and renamed linux to linux64.\nBut my reasoning for making it the default to only build for the current platform is that contributors and users probably only want to build for their current platform and making it as easy for them to do so as possible might help reduce the number of incoming questions.\nThe only ones that i can think of that cares about building it for all platforms would be core developers and maybe some Linux package maintainers that still need to worry about linux32 and both of these groups probably either read the documentation and quickly get accustomed to adding the --platforms flag when needed. If you want i could add this\ngrunt nodewkbuild --platforms=all\nto build for all platforms? Does that sound good?\nI can switch it to build for all platforms as default if that's what you want though?\n. @GonzaGonza it should detect all platforms correctly now and everything works as i would expect it to so i'd say it's ready to merge?\n. I added the option to build for all platforms with --platforms=all but i'd say everything is ready to be merged now :)\n.

It also requires the user to have Git installed and in their PATH.\nThe method I have used actually uses npm's tarball install feature that will grab the tarball from GitHub, extract it, and install it from the tarball. This way, we aren't cloning an entire repository recursively, it removes the dependency for Git and also has better support across platform.\n. @simofacc Yea. I would have much rathered to have used the Git URLs however on Windows I just could not for the life of me get it to work.

Hi, I've cloned and downloaded it. It make a new ./Popcorn-Time folder in Home\nNow, is this executable already, or do I still need to run/compile it with grunt?\nI tried to run it by using\nsudo run Popcorn-Time but doesn't seem to work.\nPerhaps you can give me a step by step here? :)\n. hi @myf oh, you mean literally run it like that. gosh. \nanyway, its running already and i'm just trying out if it's going to proceed to viewing after buffering is done.\nWe'll keep you posted and will surely follow your work. \nThanks brother!\n. @reddo try this:\ngit clone https://github.com/myf/popcorn_linux32 Popcorn_Time\nit should take about 5 mins to get all the files for that project to clone on your PC.\ngo to folder\nType ./Popcorn-Time\n;)\n. @myf hey man, with the compile that you gave me for the 32-bit, may I ask where the already watched movies are storing? \nwith the other source builds, it stores under /tmp/popcorn-time. However, i am running this build solely from the compiled github that you provided.\nAny ideas where the movies might be?\n. ",

Especially in the case of Popcorntime where not everyone might like the fact they are sending usage data about illegal copyright infringment...\n. I think a fix could be to distinguish click from drag. A quick click should toggle the video and a drag should move the window without pausing the video.

    "jakefb": "Hi, I'm hoping to fork this and use it for an idea that I have had for a while now. My project has a similar goal to Popcorn Time but will focus more on using legal torrent content for creative purposes rather than being purely for entertainment. I have been wanting to do this for quite a while now because YouTube has become more commercial what makes it difficult for people to share there content, especially if it gets taken down because of YouTube's strict policy for enforcing copyright - most recently for video games. I have been trying to integrate torrent videos into a browser but don't know how to do it without using a browser plugin like btapp. I don't like having to install browser plugins (especially flashplayer) so I think it is best to go entirely web based (HTML5 and JavaScript) or cross-platform client based. Peerflix works very well so I think I will have use a client for the time being. I found out about Popcorn Time after it had stopped working but the GUI looks nice so I thought I might be able to use that. I don't know much JavaScript but know a bit of C I am learning it as I go along. If anyone has suggestions or would like to help me I am open to it. Cheers.\n. @cettox Thanks I'm also trying to find a good way for people to upload torrent videos this could work http://burnbit.com/\n. ",
