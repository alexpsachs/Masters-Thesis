    "stuyam": ":+1: \n. @theaqua thanks for bringing this to my attention. So you are testing on your trackpad on your laptop that has force touch? I have an external trackpad and sometimes I forget and use what which doesn't work obviously, but I just want to make sure. When you refresh safari and try again does it fail every time? Do any of the examples work?\n. @theaqua try restarting Safari, there is a bug in Safari that I have tried to alert Apple about. If Safari is open for too long sometimes their force events stop working. Thanks for helping me out! Let me know if that works :)\n. @dcorb could you do me a favor and try quitting safari, restarting your computer, and trying again? These issues usually come from issues with the webkit force events being triggered by the Mac. The Mac implementation of pressure is basically just using the Safari api so if it is giving you a failure like this a lot of the time it is an Apple issue. Let me know what you find! Thanks man :smile: \n. @dcorb thanks for the feedback and the testing you have done to help. I made a small jsfiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/2eLdv0qc/5/ Give it a test, when you are in safari and click the red box, does it give you an alert and console log? This example is basically directly off of Apple's documentation, I am just curious to see that it works at all before debugging pressure. Thanks for all of the help, this is great!\n. @dcorb sorry to hear that. Yeah sounds like there may be a bug in safari for you. Not sure what is happening there. Bummer that safari is so buggy. I hope it gets better for pressure's and your sake. Thank you for all the help trying to work through this. Closing for now until someone else finds another safari bug ;)\n. Anyone having issues with Safari on a 2015 of higher Macbook Pro, reference this thread!\n. @albinekb it looks like there is a feature request for Chrome to add Force Touch feature support on OSX: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=481890\nHowever, that is only to add things like force touching a word to look it up in the dictionary, I have seen no word on Chrome adding support for web interactions yet. Hopefully there will eventually be support, and when/if they do, pressure will be the first to add it ;) \n. Thanks, this is great, merging now!\n. Added in v0.0.4\nhttps://github.com/yamartino/pressure/commit/eb5699553d50f34a8cd327169c6f982947eea10b\n. @kylehalleman good digging through the code ;) you are exactly right I forgot to add those in the docs. Im working on v0.0.4 right now and will make sure to include that in the docs. I also added webkit-touch-callout:none; to prevent the \"peek and pop\" feature on the iPhone 6s. Thanks for the reminder and I really greatly appreciate the feedback!\n. This is going to be released in the next version of the gh-pages branch, now it is a \"preventDefault\" option on v0.0.4\n. Adding support in branch: dev-v0.0.4\n. This option was implemented here: https://github.com/yamartino/pressure/commit/6f75b8781320f3d59cbd7445966b6c5797ccd59d\n. I think this only makes sense on certain ones, the force value will always be a set value on start, end, startDeepPress, and endDeepPress which I am not sure if that is useful or not. For example start and end will always be 0 and the deep press events will always be 0.5.\nFor events, I could pass back events on everything except the \"end\" method because there is no event to be handled there.\nI still don't know if either of these are good ideas or useful.\n. \"force\" is still only passed back on the \"change\" methods.\nHowever the \"event\" of the click or touch is pass back into the \"start\", \"startDeepPress\",  and \"endDeepPress\" functions.\nAdded in this commit: https://github.com/yamartino/pressure/commit/4beade1b2233293242f62d6e3f922f4098408aad\n. Someone made the suggestion with this to add another closure that would be called on mouse or touch move. Maybe a \"move\" function. I guess I can see this being useful for the canvas, if you had something along the lines of:\njavascript\nPressure.set('canvas', {\n    move: function(force, event){\n        // this would return the current force value whenever the mouse or touch move\n    }\n});\n. Im pretty sure there is no way to connect pressure up to an \"object\" on the canvas, like a circle for example, I don't think I would have a way of getting just a force value on that circle.\n. This will not be added in v0.0.4 but possibly in a future release\n. As mentioned above you can attach Pressure to the canvas to handle force values. I'm gonna close this issue for now unless someone has some other needs on the canvas.\n. This is broken in branch: dev-v0.0.4\n. FIxed here: https://github.com/yamartino/pressure/commit/cdcb59bc6936869b5b19e67f9657b0ad4c682bae\n. Fixed this in the following commits:\nhttps://github.com/yamartino/pressure/commit/f41064dc3e109b1b1852fe334ca519872c154e39\nhttps://github.com/yamartino/pressure/commit/d66979feb81c846b2100100c691fa011de9aeebc\nhttps://github.com/yamartino/pressure/commit/50344f9ee87db84992e1cc7ae321f2b8847a2aaf\n. @kylehalleman thanks for this, I can confirm that this does happen in the device emulator in Chrome. Ill have to dig into this!\n. @kylehalleman I appreciate all of the feedback and testing you have done so far with Pressure! Are you planning on using Pressure for an upcoming project? Just curious about your interest in Pressure :smiley: \n. @kylehalleman thanks for the feedback! I can confirm that all of the devices you mentioned trigger false results when using the Chrome emulator. However for example running Chrome on my actual iPhone 6, it does not trigger those results. It seems like that specifically is only a emulator issue.\nAlso the chrome emulator running Samsung Galaxy S4 and Nexus 5 do get the same false results. However are you getting those false results in the Chrome emulator on OSX or is that happening on the physical Android devices themselves?\n. @kylehalleman I think I fixed the bug in the \"dev-v0.0.4\" branch. Here is the commit that fixed it: https://github.com/yamartino/pressure/commit/05c290856b6902feab4d6651256d4cc5663b0109\nI would love if you could try the development version and see if that fixes it! Thanks for all of the help @kylehalleman \nIf it works for you I will close the issue :smile: \n. Thanks @dodekeract. Yeah this is a known issue. It is unfortunately the only way to test for support on mobile.\nThe way that it work is it loops over the touch event 10 or 20 times really quickly while you press it to check if any force value was made. I have to do it like this because to check for support on devices like an iPhone 6 or lower that don't support force touch, they all return force values for every touch event, they just are always 0 of course. So if you touch very very lightly on an iPhone 6s and it returns all 0's, the best assumption it can make is that your device does not support 3d touch.\nI'm always open to suggestions on how to make this better, but it is complicated so this is the best I came up with.\n. In fact I actually have to loop over the force value and not just check if it is greater than 0 but if it changes at all. This is because on some android devices they give back a \"1\" or \"0.66666\" or any other variations of force values passed back on an event. So what I actually do is get the first force value and loop over the event 10 or 20 times and if the force value changes during any of those checks then that means they support pressure. Else they have no pressure sensitive screen.\nI know, it is not trivial to check for support unfortunately :sob: Im not sure if there will ever be a better way since other devices give fake / false force values.\n. @dodekeract haha right? Super weird! Yeah that could be something to consider. It could check every time you press, or have an option to. Right now once it does the test it sets a global flag that I check for other presses on the page.\nMy only possible issue with that is if someone has something that is called in the \"unsupported\" callback, that does something on the page, then it is suddenly supported again on a different click, does that break the functionality on their page for example. I almost wonder if it fails, it should at least fail on the whole page. But it could be an optional setting to have it check each press so that it could have the potential to come back from a false negative.\n. This will stay as is for the time being. There is no good solution for this currently, though any input from anyone is greatly appreciated!\n. This seems to be working, just need to test it in more browsers and devices first.\n. Does not seem to be currently working for the jquery plugin.\n. Working so far for the shim. Test on all config options.\n. Should there be a flag of some sort to be able to determine if you are using native support or polyfill support? Not sure if I want to give that type of coarse control.\n. Thanks @kylehalleman! To be honest I have done little testing with pressure in npm, I will do some testing with that and try to come up with a fix!\n. @kylehalleman just pushed v1.0.1 that should fix this. Let me know if it works for you https://github.com/yamartino/pressure/releases/tag/v1.0.1\n. @NilsEckelt what version of safari are you running?\n. @NilsEckelt I am running the most recent version of Safari v9.0.3 and it seems to be working for me. Check out this issue #5 and see if any of that information helps you troubleshoot. Keep me posted! :smile: \n. @NilsEckelt first thing to try is restarting safari\n. @NilsEckelt glad to see you were able to fix it. It is such a bummer that Safari is so buggy on Mac :cry: \n. Hey @NorthMcCormick cool idea! Unfortunately from what I have noticed is that the UIWebView actually lags in support behind the actual Safari app. From my knowledge the web view does not support force values on touch events. That is why any other apps the use the web view like the chrome app do not support 3D touch.\nI am going to double check on this but I am pretty sure that is why. Hopefully Apple will add support soon because that would be a big deal!\n. Oh that is great news! Thanks for doing that research, that is really good to know. So it sounds like it is supported in the WKWebView but not the UIWebView. I would love to know if you switch to the WKWebView if it will work. To be honest I did not know there were two different types of embedable web views on iOS.\n. Thanks everyone for the input on this. I made two small iOS apps to test in the simulator, one running the UIWebView and one running the WKWebView. As we suspected pressure and 3D touch WORK in WKWebView but NOT in UIWebView. So if anyone is looking to use pressure (or any 3D touch in general) in an iOS web view use WKWebView and not UIWebView.\n:white_check_mark: WKWebView\n:x: UIWebView\n. @PhilipCrumpton as a test, try passing in the options {preventDefault: false} as the last parameter in the pressure block and see if that has any effect on the issue. Keep me posted on what you find out!\njavascript\nPressure.set('#test', {\n  start: function(event){\n    // console.log('cool it started');\n  }\n}, {preventDefault: false});\n. @PhilipCrumpton I will play around with it and see if I can come up with a way to give the best of both worlds. However the preventDefault stuff might just work that way on iOS. For example on iOS the preventDefault is setting webkitTouchCallout = \"none\"; and webkitUserSelect = \"none\";. One of those is blocking scrolling but if you remove it it will stop using those fixes. I will do some testing and see if I can find a way around or something.\nI also have another question for you. When you have the option {preventDefault: false} set and you can scroll while applying force, does the force returned cut between 0 and the actual force as you scroll? I was just testing it on the simulator on pressurejs.com and that is what was happening but I wasn't sure if that was the simulators fault or not.\nAlso thanks so much for the support! That means a lot, really appreciate you taking an interest in the library. I would \u2764\ufe0f to hear more about what you are working on using pressure.\n. All this information is great @PhilipCrumpton. It excites me that other people are excited about this stuff like I am \ud83d\udc4d I would really love to see what you are working on and if you have something live I will put it up on the pressure documentation site as an example. DM me on Twitter @StuYam if you wanna chat about it.\n. @PhilipCrumpton this scrolling issue is fixed by this commit in v2.0.0 of pressure which is not out yet but will be coming out soon: https://github.com/stuyam/pressure/commit/75fd0603e2ef74349953b7f240605dc2eb32247b\nThe issue was with the actual \"preventDefault()\" method that was being called on the touch events. Now by default it only applies the css to prevent selection but will not break scrolling and you can only optionally prevent the event defaults from the touch events.\n. See issue: https://github.com/stuyam/pressure/issues/36\n. @yanniks unfortunately I do not own an iPad Pro or Apple Pencil. However I am trying to get my hands on one by weeks end to try to reproduce and fix the issue. Thanks for bringing this to my attention I'm excited about the future possibilities with the Apple Pencil.\nI will report back soon!\n. @yanniks I did some reasearch. So yeah you are right. The screen on the iPad Pro is not force touch sensitive, it is just the pencil itself that can determine the force. So if you click on the screen with your finger before the pencil, it will set a flag on the page that there is no support for pressure and everything else will fail.\nIt does this for performance reasons so it doesn't have to do tests on every press. As well as in general I made the assumption that if one thing on the page gets the \"unsupported\" block called then for consistency the rest of the page should too. For example if  \"unsupported\" is called and you want to trigger something on the page that it is not supported, then on another press on something else it says that it is supported how does that affect it.\nI'm considering adding a configuration that you can set so that pressure will be tested every time you click on a pressure enable object. Anyone have thoughts on this, would love to hear from you @yanniks what you think. Sorry this is a little confusing and has a lot of jargon \ud83d\ude1c \n. Being added in v2.0.0, support is tested on every click or press instead of once per page. So the issue mentioned in this thread won't be an issue in the future because it can fail from a finger click but then succeeded from the pencil if you switch between the two.\n. Thanks @marcusmolchany \ud83d\udc4d \n. @jalbam sorry to hear that is happening. It sounds like it has to do with how babel is creating hierarchy and using proto instead of using normal prototypical inheritance the full way. I am going to look into if I can get babel to compile it differently.\nThanks for bringing this to my attention I will look into it now \ud83d\udc4d \n. If anyone knows anything about how babel compiles with the __proto_ inheritance and if that can be changed to extend the prototype let me know. Would love to know if anyone has encountered this elsewhere and how it can be fixed.\n. This doesn't seem to be throwing an error in the latest versions of Firefox 49 and since this is an issue with babel and the way they set legacy support for inheritance, it is not a big issues for me. Anyone that has this issue in the future feel free to bring in back up, just doesn't seem to be a priority.\n. Support added in v2.0.0\n. Added in v2.0.0 https://github.com/stuyam/pressure/commit/95ae3ca9268d23a6409758019e579dacfcfe7ec4\n. Added in his commit in v2.0.0 https://github.com/stuyam/pressure/commit/75fd0603e2ef74349953b7f240605dc2eb32247b\n. Leave event.preventDefault() up to the developer outside the library. The only thing I can tell it does it prevent the highlight box in Chrome on iOS. However is has some consequences, for example on iOS it makes it so you can not scroll when your finger is touching the element that's event is prevented default. That is why I leave it up to the developer base on their needs for their specific implementation. \nThe peek & pop and other actions are prevented by applying css with the preventSelect option in pressure. https://github.com/stuyam/pressure/commit/2c11127ca0a3af1da991352a72a01a213dedecbe\n. Fixed \ud83d\udc4d \n. Have taken many many passes through the code base and cleaned up and separated out things as nicely as I could.\n. It is working now. However there is a bug with the polyfill. You can tap an item and it will run the polyfill even though your finger is not on it. This happens in both the new and legacy implementations. \n. Fixed in commit: https://github.com/stuyam/pressure/commit/cd01fab66d5e2902c048d863315a5583b9456d65\n. polyfill is now on by default in v2.0.0 https://github.com/stuyam/pressure/commit/261dfd3ad834deac9f1fd210ca0274f88bc76ed8\n. Did some consolidation\n. Thanks for reporting this @henrahmagix, I am gonna look into this this weekend!\n. This should be the fixed on both iOS and MacOS. If a touch happens lightly on either platform the unsupported or polyfill may be called, that part is a little of of my control (unless someone comes up with a better solution). But now, even if unsupported or the polyfill is called and force is detected at any point during that touch/press, it will cancel the polyfill and native support will kick in. https://github.com/stuyam/pressure/commit/d6f64f113fb99af26cf197d602ed6ae3ab73090b\n. @henrahmagix and @lucdetellis I published a fix and update the docs site. Let me know if it is still an issue \ud83d\udc4d Else I will close this issue in the coming days.\n. Does that message show up on every press or just when you tap lightly?\n. @introrse can you clarify what you mean by \"I get the fallback and no force messages at all.\"\n. @zetlen wow this is awesome \ud83d\ude4c! Really great stuff in here, that UMD package is definitely a big improvement and makes the compilation less fragile so thank you for that! I will update this later tonight!\nThanks so much again!\n. @zetlen just deployed this as v2.0.2, thanks for the contribution! Greatly appreciated. https://github.com/stuyam/pressure/releases/tag/v2.0.2\n. @zetlen that is awesome to hear, love the site, very clever! Again I appreciate the help with that last PR, big help. \nQuick question, would you mind taking a look at this issue, I know that pressure works, but I am not sure why this is the case: https://github.com/stuyam/pressure/issues/53\n. Thanks for the help @zetlen, this was fixed in the newest version v2.0.3\n. Hey @davidshimjs thanks for the pull request. Can you explain to me more about the issue you found? What are the steps you took to reproduce the issue that you saw?\n. @davidshimjs can you maybe make an example of this to test in a gist? Here is my example that I tried with google maps and I did not see any errors but I don't know if I set it up right: https://gist.github.com/stuyam/c294bb78011442833e1dd5f696276e1b\n. Thanks for the extra info!\n. Thanks for the feedback @vorthess!\nI have thought of this before, kept deciding it wasn't necessary but I have seen a few examples where people implement it themselves so maybe it would be useful if it was prebuilt.\nMaybe have like a \"polyfillSpeedUp\" and \"polyfillSpeedDown\" config option that would default to 1 second.\nI guess I would have to think about how it would work in terms of enabling and disabling that specific behavior. The polyfill is enabled by default in v2 of pressure. Would the \"Down\" be another setting? Would it be on by default? Would love to hear other peoples thoughts on this.\n@marcusmolchany \n@henrahmagix. @henrahmagix smart idea with setting the default of polyfillSpeedDown: 0 I like that.\n@vorthess, curious about what your application of this would be?. Haven't had time to work on this yet. Would love help on this is people are willing \ud83d\ude04 . Coming soon in version 2.1.0 of pressure.. Released in v2.1.0: https://github.com/stuyam/pressure/releases/tag/v2.1.0\nHope you find in useful! \ud83d\ude04 . Thanks @controversial \ud83d\udc4d . Hmm, looks like I should be checking for that and return or something if there is no touches object on an event. Will look into it and get back to you. Thank you for reporting this \ud83d\ude04 . @Legohuman do you have more information on this bug? Do you have a codepen or something that could be tested?\nI have tried a few scenarios and have not been able to reproduce the error that you were encountering.. Awesome @Legohuman thank you for the example. Update to the most recent v2.1.0, it is fixed in that version. No more errors.\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/yamartino/05t7f6ja/3/\nHowever when you try to do multitouch with child elements like that it also doesn't give a pressure reading because the element you are clicking isn't the element it is attached to. But because of bubbling it does trigger pressure to run but fails to select the correct element. My hunch is that for that to work with child elements like that while doing multitouch pressure would have to traverse the elements child elements to see if any of those match.. @bhaux awesome! Thank you for the information I did not know that it was started to be included in browsers that is great news.\nI also did not know that it worked with thinks like Wacom tablets that is awesome fantastic! Luckily I have one and using the link you posted I was able to see the pressure values with the Wacom. (Side note I actually didn't know that 'pressure' was the name of the pointer event value until after naming pressurejs).\nI setup pressure to have adapters, currently there are 2, 3dTouch and ForceTouch adapters. I tried to set it up in a way that I could add more adapters in the future when things like pointer events started working.\nI am eager to start integrating this and would love help from anyone willing. Luckily the pointer events are standardized so that will future proof this project as well.\nAs for the two \"gotchas\" that you found, I am not sure how to get around them just yet but I hope I will figure something out. Hopefully with Firefox I can enable those in the library but not sure yet.\nThanks again for the suggestion.. @bhaux curious what you are using wacom tablets on the web for. Sounds interesting!. I have successfully been able to get pointer events to work in chrome and opera on mac with my wacom tablet.\nThe firefox issue it looks like I can not get around. There is a \"windows only\" fix but I am not sure how that works.\nAs for the chrome issues of being at 0 and 0.5 force on the track pad I was able to get around that by checking if the pressure values is not exactly 0 nor exactly 0.5 because that values are always some super long trailing decimal.\nWill hopefully be able to have something to release soon.. Coming soon in version 2.1.0 of pressure.. Released in v2.1.0: https://github.com/stuyam/pressure/releases/tag/v2.1.0\nThanks @bhaux for the awesome suggestion, it future proofs pressure! I didn't know support had started to be included in browsers for Pointer Events \ud83c\udf89 . @davidshimjs sorry for taking long on getting back to you on this. Most of this looks solid to me, but I am wondering why the reordering of the conditions about which polyfill to use.\nIf mouse is above the pointer, then the pointer will never run on desktop. I had pointer above it because if it supports pointer then it should use that over mouse. Same with touch. I think the order should probably be, Pointer, Touch, Mouse. I see now that I have Mouse above Touch which is wrong because most mobile devices support mouse. But I don't think Touch should be above Pointer.\nLet me know your thoughts and thanks again for the PR and fixing the bug I had in there with supportLegacyTest stuff \ud83d\udc4d . I am going to merge things now to clean things up but then take a look and let me know, I am going to change to the order of Pointer, Touch, Mouse.. @davidshimjs Check the current version of master, I made a few tweaks, let me know how that works for you. If it is all good I will push a v2.1.1 update.. Related #67 . Thanks for this \u26a1\ufe0f . Fixed in v2.1.1. Closing until someone reopens with any more info.... Related #67 . @stephaneAG thanks for reporting this. Sounds like an interesting bug. I will try to reproduce and see if there is anything more that we can find out about this issue.\n\ud83d\ude04 . So I figured it out with a little bit of testing. So there are two conflicting web views on iOS right now. There is UIWebView and WKWebView. UIWebView is the older version and is being phased out. I have seen people run into this before and the old UIWebView does not support 3D Touch events.\nI did a test to see if when saving you add a website to your home screen it will open in a UIWebView and sure enough:\n(When added to the home screen)\n\n(When opened in safari)\n\nThis was the code I used to test the page that I took from a stackoverflow on how to determine which web view a site is running in with js. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28795476/detect-if-page-is-loaded-inside-wkwebview-in-javascript\nhtml\n<!doctype html>\n  <head>\n    <meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-capable\" content=\"yes\" />\n    <script>\n      if (navigator.platform.substr(0,2) === 'iP'){\n        //iOS (iPhone, iPod or iPad)\n        var lte9 = /constructor/i.test(window.HTMLElement);\n        var nav = window.navigator, ua = nav.userAgent, idb = !!window.indexedDB;\n        if (ua.indexOf('Safari') !== -1 && ua.indexOf('Version') !== -1 && !nav.standalone){\n          //Safari (WKWebView/Nitro since 6+)\n          alert('Safari (WKWebView/Nitro since 6+)');\n        } else if ((!idb && lte9) || !window.statusbar.visible) {\n          //UIWebView\n          alert('UIWebView');\n        } else if ((window.webkit && window.webkit.messageHandlers) || !lte9 || idb){\n          //WKWebView\n          alert('WKWebView');\n        }\n      }\n    </script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n  </body>\n</html>\nFrom what I understand Apple is phasing out the native looking pinned apps, only workaround I know would be to remove the <meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-capable\" content=\"yes\" /> line but then it would just open in Safari and not it's own \"app\".\nHope this helps! <3. Yeah all of this things have to do with it being in the old UIWebView and not the new WKWebView unfortunately. Closing for now as it is out of my control \ud83d\ude22 . Added some related references where similar conversations have been had before but not yet resolved. Thanks for posting this issue. \ud83d\ude04 . I will have to check with Browserstack, I have access to it. However last I checked there wasn't an option to adjust the force applied to the a screen through Browserstack.. It's been too long but Im circling back and going to get this fixed. Was able to reproduce.. This is fixed in the latest release v2.1.2 https://github.com/stuyam/pressure/releases/tag/v2.1.2\nGive it a try \ud83d\udc4d . Hey @abdullascript sorry for the late response. I saw that you closed the issue, did you get it working? If so how did you fix it?. That is very strange. It almost sounds like it may be an Apple bug but not sure. They have had some weird bugs with the trackpad and safari but I will try to reproduce and see what I can find out! \ud83d\ude04 . Closing unless there is more evidence of this and can be reproduced.. Duplicate: #67 . Closing and refer to #67 . let's ship it. Hi @MickL,\nThere currently isn't a way I can think of to test if an element is bound to pressure. It seems like it would make sense to do so.\nFor now you could so something like add a property on any element that has been bound to pressure that you can check later. For example:\njavascript\n$(someElement).pressure();\n$(someElement).data('pressure-bound', true);\n...\n...\nif( !$(someElement).data('pressure-bound') ){\n  // do something\n}\nBut I will look into how we could provide this as a feature. If anyone has any ideas I'm all ears.. Thanks for the feedback @dantman !\nThere are a few things happening here. The mouse and touch events are working properly. The mouse one is only targeting mouse devices, which you don't have, so it is saying unsupported. The touch one is seeing you are targeting touch events but don't have touch force value so it is reverting to the polyfill.\nThe target all and pointer are targeting the pointer event because that is what your device supports. It seems like your device is probably giving weird pointer event results. The pointer event supports just maps to the pointer event api so it seems like your device might not follow the pointer event pressure api exactly (this is all too common). A lot of devices give weird pressure values, Im not sure if there is a fix for it. If you can connect to dev tools and what pointer event pressure values you phone is giving that might be helpful.. Sounds like this is part feature request, part bug report? I'm guessing the value going above 1 thing should be fixed too, I should have something to max out every outputted value to 1 if anything goes above.\nI will also take a look at adding an array option or something for config. I am open to pull requests as well :smile: not sure when exactly I will get around to this but will keep you posted.. Does it continue if you restart your phone? When you change the settings from Firm to Regular to Light does it make a difference? I have tried a number of those things and have not been able to reproduce what you are experiencing.. Cool thanks \ud83d\udc4d . Currently we don't support a way of doing this out of the box. For this to work we would need to add something like an unbindEvents() which would use the removeEventListener method which would allow you to call in some way to unbind the binded events.\nOpen to pull requests on this, will take a look when I get a chance. Not sure if there is a way you can do it right now without the implementation.. The only thing on the dom node will be the added event listeners. What did you have in mind @darkyen?. ",

I tried using variations of this code but it never seemed to work right, so I gave up. That's where I first ran into this Chrome bug.\nBut then I heard about this project on 5 Minutes of JavaScript podcast, so I've been playing around with it.\nIf I can find a solution to the Chrome bug I'll send a pull request, but in the past when using that other code, I found nothing online about the problem.\nKeep up the good work.\n. @yamartino They're actual devices. I only had deep press set, and pretty much every tap (or swipe even) triggered the deep press.\n. @yamartino I found this repo that seems to mention the odd Chrome behavior. Check out this section of the code and also here.\n. Just tested, server rendering works with no errors being thrown, thanks!\n. ",

So if we can leave this open, once I am able to get my project updated, I can test this with the WKWebKit. The newest chrome I think is using the new WKWebView as well. I'll double check that and maybe use it as a test bed too. \n. I just confirmed, as of Chrome 48 (49 is the current production version) on iOS 9 and up pressureJS does work in the browser. So that's good news! Once I get the WKWebView working I can further test to see if it works without any further options. \n. Yes, there are two, however the WKWebView has been bug-city for the last year or so. Cordova FINALLY has it supported with that 4.0 platform version. \nIn fact, it's been so buggy that (I'm pretty positive) iOS Safari didn't use WKWebView until iOS9, but it's been in the system since like iOS7, publicly available in iOS8. \nYeah cross my fingers it will work, it should open up some cool doors for hybrid apps. \n.

If it is possible to preserve scroll and prevent other default events that would be a nice feature.\nThank you very much for your work on this library and your quick support.  Very appreciated!\n. No, in my case the force returned is consistent with the force applied.  \nAlso, for clarification, from what I can tell iOS native behavior (without PressureJS) doesn't scroll in browser when a deep touch is applied.  It seems to scroll when force is less than 0.5 though that number MAY be different.\nWith PressureJS and preventDefault: true, I was unable to scroll when touching an element with a pressure listener applied, regardless of the pressure force. \n. Oh, and to answer your question about what I'm using it for, upcoming web design/dev projects I have a vision for subtle prompts to \"click harder\" for additional UI interaction.  Some just for visual fun but I'm hoping to find some useful interactions.  I'm excited about force interaction and hope it grows UI experience.\n. ",
