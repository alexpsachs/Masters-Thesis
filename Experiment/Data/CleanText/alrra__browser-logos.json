This is done because I consider that to be a breaking change in the \"API\"  as people who depend on that path will no longer have it.\n\nMINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner\n\nMinor versions are released mainly when the SVG version of a logo and/or a new logo is added.\n\nPATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes\n\nPatch versions are released when typos or links are fixed, images are further losslessly optimized, a better version of a logo is added by just replacing the existing images, etc..\nI hope this helps!\n\n\nI was on 3.* and just see you are on v22.\n\nYes, things move fast nowadays! :D\n. > Create a symbolic link of the old file, pointing to the archive folder... them, you can push v1.1 instead of v2.0.... \n\nWhen you have a lot of deprecated logos and want to clean up, then you can create a new major\n\n@Soullivaneuh That would just complicate things a lot without any real benefit as far as I see. Plus, you're just prolonging the inevitable, namely, releasing new major versions. Also, given enough time, you will still end up at versions such as 35.y.z.\n\ndeleted/moved logos should be marked in the Changelog\n\nThat is usually stated (e.g.: Move X logo into the archive/), and if users want more detailed information, they can just read the commit messages or look at the commits.\n. > have to check new majore every week. :-)\n@Soullivaneuh I don't think that's a big problem. From what I've seen, most users only care about the main browsers. Plus, when those browsers update their logos it is usually known, therefore, users will most probably only check / update at that point.\n\nthis is just a suggestion. \n\nSure thing, suggestions are always welcomed! :+1: \n. > deleted/moved logos should be marked in the Changelog IMHO.\nUpdated the CHANGELOG and the releases. \u2728\n. > Do you know if some PHP / JS whatever langage libraries related to your project exists?\n@Soullivaneuh No.\n\nWould be great to setup a list on you Readme, what do you think?\n\nIf there are projects that use the images from this one, sure, we can try that and see if it helps. :)\n. > hotlinking the images\n@dbox If you are referring to linking to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/..., I personally don't recommend it because as far as I know, it is not intended as a static file hosting service.\n\ngithub's current policy on hotlinking the images\n\nBest way to find out is to ask GitHub by either:\n- sending a email to support@github.com\n- using the form on https://github.com/contact\n. > > could use gh-pages for everything,\n\nThanks that's exactly what I was looking for.\n\n@dbox Ah, ok. I misunderstood your question.\n\nhttps://github.com/kni-labs/old-browsers\nand hotlinking the images is key\n\n@dbox Why not use npm to fetch and then copy them locally?\n\nor set up a script that copies the images to the gh-pages branch on every commit\n\n@mathiasbynens, @dbox The problem with that solution is that some of the links will end up in a 404 quite fast. Or, am I missing something?\n. > Npm fetch is new to me. How would that work? \n@dbox For example, you can do the following:\n1) Use npm's \"scripts\" property and create a custom command to fetch and copy the logos that you need from node_modules/browser-logos/ to your img/ directory. \njson\n\"scripts\": {                                                           \n  \"update-browser-logos\": \"npm i alrra/browser-logos && cp node_modules/browser-logos/*/{chrome,edge,firefox,opera,safari}_128x128.png img\"\n},\nNote: Depending on which logos you rely on, when you update to a new major version of browser-logos, you may need to update that custom command if there are breaking changes.\n2) Use the custom command to update the logos from img/\nbash\nnpm run update-browser-logos\nYou can integrate that into your build process, or just run it manually when you update to a new version of the browser-logos. \n\nHope this helps. :)\n. @dbox: browser-logos is now available via cdnjs: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/browser-logos.\n. >  could you please tell me what files should be hosted on CDN?\n@maruilian11 Everything except the following:\n.editorconfig\n.git\n.gitattributes\n.github\n.npmignore\n.scripts\narchive/README.md\nbower.json\nCHANGELOG.md\npackage.json\nREADME.md\n\nFrom https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/blob/5b14dbfc41562c2d21f75d5ae1401fc6df9e9752/README.md#cdnjs-library-repository:\n\ncdnjs will host any production version of any JavaScript/CSS library\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Do note that this is just a collection of images, it's not a JavaScript/CSS library.\n(Cc: @PeterDaveHello)\n\n@maruilian11, @PeterDaveHello Let me know if I can help with anything else! \n. > do you have any license for this lib?\n@maruilian11 See: https://github.com/alrra/browser-logos#legal\n. > I'm not sure if there will be some legal concern to host these collection publicly? Do you have any idea or comment?\n@PeterDaveHello What I can tell you is that so far there hasn't been any such issue with this project. Furthermore, some of the browser logos where even contributed by people that are employed by the companies that develop those browsers (e.g.: 1, 2).\nAt the end of the day, this project isn't different from, let say, someone just using the logos in a presentation. It's only intended to help people quickly find a high resolution version of a specific logo. It doesn't, for example, use the logos in artworks that are sold or any other things that might have a negative impact or bring any losses to their owners. \n. @Spiderpig86 Thanks! :paperclip:\n.

There are breaking changes from time to time, but I try to document them in the releases and in the CHANGELOG.md.\nSee also: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/browser-logos.\n.

Thanks, @scribblemaniac! \n. > Hopefully tools like lerna can help here.\n@mathiasbynens I actually looked into Lerna and some other tools, but I don't think I'll need them. These packages are simple, don't have dependencies, and most of them won't get many updates (probably only patch versions as the images are further optimized).\n\nif you don\u2019t mind the extra maintenance overhead!\n\nWhen needed, I'll probably write some scripts to automate things . Also, this issue is done! \ud83c\udf89 . > There are hundreds of projects that refer to that logo by its old URL. Are you sure that you want to break all of them?\n@jakub300 The recommended ways of getting these logos are listed under the Getting the browser logos section from the main README.md file.\nChanges are specified in detail in the CHANGELOG.md files as well as in every release.\nLinking directly to master is never a good idea, and if one does so, she/he assumes the risk of things breaking at any time. .

Thanks for the PR, @JohnEJames! \nThose fields are not needed, nor do they bring any extra benefit, especially as the \"main\" package is marked as private, and thus, not published. \n\nCongrats on opening your first pull request on GitHub! \ud83c\udf89 . @janpapenbrock Good catch! Thanks! . > Is this on purpose? \nYes. From https://github.com/alrra/browser-logos/issues/99#issue-187682357:\n\nLogos for which the exact browser versions are not known won't be published as that can potentially create confusion and some problems down the line.. > What is the recommended way for these?

The way I'm doing it shouldn't end up in 404s should it?\n\n@dbox Why not use npm to fetch and then copy them locally?\n\nNpm fetch is new to me. How would that work? I think the key is that the user would just have to copy the one line of code.. super easy to implement. \nI have been trying to think about how that line of code could be dynamic via npm...\nOpen to better solutions!\n. @alrra Thanks so much for the detailed instructions. That's awesome. \nI don't think it will be the ideal workflow for what i'm trying to do for old-browsers, but it definitely gives me ideas for some other repos!:)\n. Awesome.

Sorry that that's something that CDNJS won't and can't implement, the current hosting is directly handled by Cloudflare, and we won't encourage to use it most of the scenarios, to prevent any unpredictable breaking changes, like the removal, renaming of files in the case here or API changes in the other library cases..

BTW, cndnjs does have many many issues on this feature already, this one being the primary issue. Considering how long it has been open and how many people have requested it, I would not hold my breath for it to be implemented any time soon.. Here's a version of svg made to look like the icon: focus.svg.zip\nAlthough it becomes clear when comparing them that the svg we have right now is not quite the same as what is used in the icon.

A vector image's filesize doesn't matter, it's always smaller then the infinite number of raster images that can be made from it.. Thanks for adding it.
