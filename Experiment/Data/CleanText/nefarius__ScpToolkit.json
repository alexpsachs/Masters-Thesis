    "Blackbird88": "While you changed the links you should still be aware that DX Runtime is still needed to be installed for all Windows versions. XInput1_3.dll for instance is not pre-packaged with any Windows.\n. Yes please. SixAxis is great feature to have. PS3 emulators might also benefit from it in future:)\n. Thank ye!\n. Cool!\n. Very good. You should make it configurable so you can set the threshold when it shows up (and maybe even change colors to yellow and then red when it's low?). Kinda like battery LED on phones.\nOptional one-time blinking would be perfect! (so it shows up when the DS3's LED is blinking and then gets hidden until it's critical. Kinda like PS3.)\n. ",
    "nefarius": "Thanks!\n. I can confirm the behavior, I'll look into that!\n. I tried swapping out the deprecated timer code but it didn't make a difference, will continue to investigate =/\n. DS4Windows has a completely different working design and only uses a small portion of the Scarlet code, I've already looked into it.\n. Just FYI it happens on Windows 10 too sadly =/\n. Guys, I finally found the cause and was able to fix it; it's the ScpVBus.sys drivers fault, it keeps the system awake as long as a virtual controller is connected or lingering. I rewrote the driver from scratch and the problem is gone; now the system can even enter sleep mode with multiple controllers connected. I'll keep you posted.\n. @spacetraveller that's because it hasn't been fixed yet.. You may have luck, just add the HIDs to ScpControl.ini and run the installer again.\n. Do you know at which version/commit it stopped working?\n. Code would be very much appreciated. I guess by sixaxis you don't refer to the predecessor of the DS3 but the gyroscope and accelerometer features?\n. Soooo... no code to contribute?\n. Test? I though't there's working code?\n. Yes it's working again, although it's not really the ScpUser project fixed, it's a re-write from scratch. Please see my Wiki for more details.\n. Since this is in the works and the issue was kinda hijacked anyways I'm closing this one :)\n. If it's genuine and has v4 specification it should work fine!\n. You shall no more need to use Zadig! :+1: \n. This is solved in the latest version.\n. The log is written to files. Please look in the folder you extracted the program in and you should find some *.log.xml files, submit those and no screenshots needed :)\n. Errr... I can't read that =/\n. The error occurred in an outdated project, please try the latest build!\n. That's why there are *.log.xml files generated you can submit, I don't want someone to just copy the GUIs output since there's a lot of information missing.\n. Since the original issue seems fixed I'm closing this one.\n. I will add some sort of blacklist or selection screen to the driver installer to avoid this. By default it just replaces the driver for all devices found in ScpControl.iniattached to your system.\n. The latest version 1.6.x driver installer has been re-designed to let the user chose which devices shall be installed.\n. Is there still an issue?\n. Closed. Reason: no feedback.\n. Oooops, my bad! Added the missing file to the repository, thanks for reporting!\n. You didn't unblock the archive.\n. A pull request will do the trick!\n. Thank you, fixed!\n. Do you mean you tested it with this chip and I should add it to the Wiki or what do you mean by \"add support\"?\n. No feedback received.\n. Well, don't run the verifier then :P I don't have a fix for this yet.\n. Ok somehow my run of the verifier doesn't create a dump file >_<\n. @mirh yeah, I know right =P But no matter what switch I flip; none of my virtual machines (Win7/8/10) create a fin' memory dump! I sincerely don't know what I'm doing wrong...\n. Trying one more time with Complete memory dump enabled...\n. *I. FIXED. IT. !\n\n. Thank you!\n. Look for \"Xbox 360 Controller\" entries in your device manager and uninstall all of them. Sometimes the virtual Xbox 360 devices get the wrong driver; manually removing them and letting Windows re-discover it with correct drivers helps.\n. Works just as promised, thank you! :)\n. If you want to use your controllers wireless you must dedicate one Bluetooth dongle to the software. This is why the icon disappears from the tray; you can not use any other Bluetooth devices from the same dongle after the driver got changed.\n. I appreciate your submission but I will throw out the existing profile manager since it's a nightmare to maintain and too hard to extend. I'll look through the code but it's unlikely that i'll merge it, sorry :(\n. Yes, the Project ScpProfiler is meant to replace the existing one as a complete re-write. It'll support mapping controller buttons/axes to other buttons/axes, but also to keyboard keys, mouse buttons and movement etc. Currently there's no alternative in the toolkit itself I'm aware of.\n. Is this still an issue with the latest version?\n. Well, Backups... ;P\n. You're seriously opening up an issue because I'm not releasing updates fast enough? I'll put one up when I think it's ready. A how-to-build is also coming up soon.\n. And the device is... what?\n. Ah I see, have a look into ScpControl.ini :)\n. New release has the ability to let the user chose which devices to install.\n. Right, I have some prototypes in the works, stay tuned!\n. What do you think?\n\n. Well, more or less \ud83d\ude04 . Is this still an issue?\n. This is currently not possible.\n. This will be possible in the next release.\n. It isn't and won't be possible to influence which XInput slot the controller gets assigned because that's dictated by Microsofts xusb.sys driver alone. The bugyness with mixed controller environments will be solved though, that's why I commented on this issue.\n. @mirh #145 is affected and fixed in the upcoming release, I'm still not sure what i can do about #146 though.\n. Finally making use of those milestones :D\n. @charlesmilette since this weekend got pretty much occupied with other stuff, I can release a beta hopefully within the following week or the upcoming weekend.\n. Hi,\nit is implemented, my Instance of Steam opens in Big Picture Mode just fine!\n. Since this is an \"issue\" with Windows 10 in itself I'm closing this one.\n. I have no idea how the audio transmission is accomplished and I' not aware of anyone having reverse engineered it yet. Maybe Sony uses A2DP for it's audio communication but I haven't looked into it yet and doubt that I will anytime soon.\n. This will be fixed in the next release.\n. I used CCleaner to pin down the startup entry that's causing the error message and deleted it. Sadly didn't make a screenshot so I can't recall the exact name of the registry key...\n. @charlesmilette no but seeing it's an integrated (mobile) chipset I doubt I'll ever investigate or attempt to fix it since they typically do some weird sht off the specs only the vendor drivers are capable off, especially with power management. You save yourself a lot of troubles if you just use a dedicated stand-alone dongle.\n. Thank you kindly :)\n. Holy sht! I will investigate, thanks for reporting!\n. I fixed it in the latest pre-release, stable one coming up next, thanks again for reporting!\n. What version are you using? Is the delay measurable? I myself own and use a DS4 and I can't really tell a difference so I'd need more information.\n. Ok that's awful; input updates occur at least every 10 milliseconds. I'm afraid I can't really help here since I'm not really convinced it's a software issue.\n. This has long been fixed; there was a problem with the initialization of the DS4 setting the input update rate too low. Now it's set to a 1000 Hz by default.\n. Good to know, thanks for your feedback!\n. Got fixed in this release.\n. The service log is missing in your archive; did you remove it or was it never there?\n. I now own GTA V too so I can test this myself in a few days hopefully.\n. @The-Euphoria mind to share the solution?\n. Is this still a thing?\n. I'll allow myself to close this then.\n. 1.2.x is Scarlett's version, not mine. Since it works entirely different I don't support it.\n. This is resolved in the upcoming release.\n. Alright :)\n. Thanks for pushing me in the right direction; I'll look through all locked regions and try to fix them.\n. Gyroscole and accelerometer aren't implemented yet. Will announce it in the release notes when done.\n. Please try this release and tell me if it's fixed for you, thanks!\n. Closed due to hardware problem.\n. Please try this release and tell me if it's fixed for you, thanks!\n. There's a tool called ScpToolkit Debug Info Collector you can find via start menu, please run it, follow it's instructions and forward me the result.\n. Don't run the debug collector after clean wipe, you'll distort the results. Make a clean installation, connect the controller(s), shut down the service via services.msc and run the debug collector again.\n. Could you also please try this special build, just overwrite the existing DLL and restart the service. Submit the logs afterwards.\n. Could you explain in more detail what's exactly happening on your end? All logs look perfectly fine so I'm a little lost what to recommend now...\n. Could you provide a screenshot of your \"Devices & Printers\" section along with your device manager, expanding the USB and HID categories?\n. Ok, screenshot of ScpMonitor please.\n. Thanks, getting more and more mysterious... @_@\n. Give me a few secs, have and idea...\n. Nah, code-based idea =D\n. Please test again with this one, should pop up an additional error message in your case (hopefully).\n. Ok that's not good. This is a very low level error I can not fix by coding. Can you maybe try a different USB cable? Is the USB port on the controller somehow wiggly or visibly damaged?\n. Mystery solved then, are you skilled with a soldering iron? Re-flowing solder can be magic :)\n. You're welcome :)\n. Any news from ace3df since we hijacked your thread? :)\n. Well, since you didn't install the Afterglow driver according to the log it's no surprise it doesn't work... ;)\n. The reason it worked with some games and others not is, that the game pads get detected by games using DirectInput.\n. Right, you've spotted a bug. I'll work on a fix!\n. I fixed the issue; playing Metal Gear Solid 3 right now :) Will be included in the next release!\n. The Log Pack would be even better ;)\n. Search for ScpToolkit Debug Info Collector in your start menu, run it and follow its instructions.\n. The created ZIP.\n. Just use any of the 2 million one-click upload sites :D\n. The tool creates a ZIP file. Take this file and upload it to e.g. http://xup.in and paste the link here.\n. Seriously? =P\n. Np ;)\n. Search for ScpToolkit Debug Info Collector in your start menu, run it and follow its instructions.\n. Huh? I read the links but I - excuse my ignorance - didn't quite get what you want from me? :)\n. Well, wouldn't be too hard for me to provide one. Just needed to know what developers would need.\n. @mirh I designed FireShock with those requirements in mind; it will become mind-blowing(ly) easy to access those features through the driver :wink: \n. Might have identified the problem, please test and provide feedback on this release.\n. There's no service log. Installer log also states you didn't install the service. The server is deprecated, install the service and try again.\n. Yes that's correct but the server is only for testing purposes, the service is the way to go. And as the error message states they can and must not run at the same time.\n. Good to know, I'll allow my self to close this issue then :)\n. Since the driver emulates an Xbox Controller: no, it's not possible to change the button overlays. And no; the game doesn't know about Bluetooth or USB; it sees an Xbox controller and therefore uses XInput, not DirectInput. There is a 3rd party mod for DInput though I haven't tested it myself.\n. @kq01526 what the hell are you talking about? When you use a DS4 through Scp via libusbK drivers the DS4 as a device becomes invisible to any apps/games that either use DInput, RawInput or XInput. It's Scps virtual Xbox 360 controller driver that gets virtually plugged in and is seen by the game through xusb drivers (Microsoft) and XInput-API. So the game \"sees\" that an Xbox controller is used; it has no knowledge what it really is.\nYes, I know how the DS4 works in its \"native-mode\". Yes, I know that some games support the DS4 directly. What has any of this to do with the questions @Tomgroot asked? I think I already answered them properly...\n. My answer is related to him using the Scp drivers. Why would I wanna comment on the DS4s native mode?\n. @kq01526 since this would defeat the entire purpose of the software as I'd have to emulate a DS4 just for those DS4-aware games; no, there is no way currently and I doubt I'll follow this trail since it's not what the software is meant for. Good enough?\n. Ooooohh I understand now. Hm, well that doesn't sound too bad, any plans from DS4Windows in that direction?\n. I have/had no plans to somehow compete with DS4Windows so I don't know what to say honestly.\n. @My1 from my understanding of the DS4 this will not be possible with DS4Windows without some rather nasty hacks. DS4Windows communicates with the DS4 in its \"PC mode\" where it simply presents itself to the PC as a HID device. Manipulating extra stuff like the Lightbar can only be done when the DS4 is in \"PS4 mode\", which is what Scp uses. I don't think these modes are \"live switchable\" and compatible with the common Bluetooth stacks and Windows HID drivers.\n. @My1 hm? Under which circumstances? Btw. should we switch over to the chat since we're hijacking this issue thread quite a bit? ;)\n. Your service log is damaged and can't be read. Please repeat the connection procedure and shut down the service before you run the debug collector!\n. The error is still there, please stop the service, go to your installation directory, delete the file Logs\\ScpDsxService_GUILLE7$.log.xml and repeat the steps above.\n. It is! But could you also make a screenshot of ScpToolkit Monitor while it's supposedly connected via Bluetooth?\n. Mystery solved; these zeros are the packet counter; if it stays at zero that means the data the controller is sending can't be interpreted. For the moment you're simply out of luck, sorry.\n. I will come back to the counterfeit ones but just no time at all right now =/\n. @xorincret: I got some different \"breeds\" of those PANHAIs donated a few month ago and had them disassembled. I managed to tap into the communication between the Bluetooth controller chip and the micro controller (they communicate via UART thankfully) and actually could dump the streams they exchange when connecting to a genuine Sony PlayStation 3. \nSince my knowledge of the whole Bluetooth specification (if I recall correctly, v4 has nearly a 1000 pages...) is very limited I wasn't yet able to decipher those dumps. I don't have much time either since I'd like to focus on development rather than reverse engineering. \nThe Logs the toolkit produces won't help much since the inner workings of the protocols involved aren't logged; it would add too much of an overhead.\nWhat I've discovered so far is, that the actual pairing (sadly people misuse this term all the time; the flashing LEDs do not necessarily indicate a pairing problem) works fine, it's the L2CAP connections which fail after responding to a connection and configuration request. The PANHAIs just don't send the 3rd connection request for the HID Service channel which the originals do just fine. That's where the software is currently stuck.\nIf you want to know more about the inner workings of the Scp Bluetooth stack don't hesitate to ask.\n. @aking4125 the reason for my fork behaving differently than the original Scp drivers is simple: I hate hacks where even if you kind of understand what the code does you still have no idea why it works. I ripped out a good bunch of those mysterious sections (beware that the original code base was poorly documented too) so I could continue working in refining and enhancing the software without pissing genuine owners off because the \"fake workarounds\" can (and did) break connectivity with Sony controllers. So I'm simply playing safe until I am able to fully understand and reverse engineer the counterfeit ones to code a real solution that's reliable and stable.\nI hope this answer clears things up for you. Don't get me wrong, I'm eager to ship a real fix for this but it takes time.\n. @Fry1985 \nI know.\nYes.\nDon't know.\nGreat.\nThanks.\nI try =]\n. No. Sorry, just no. That's an over-complicated attempt to create a workaround for something that needs to be fixed. There's a reason it's designed as a Windows Service: to start automatically in background. If it doesn't, it has to be troubleshooted and fixed. You didn't even include the source of the executable. I highly discourage people from using this!\n. Look in your Windows Event Log, in the System-Category you should find service-related errors.\n. That's 'cause you filtered on the wrong source. The service itself doesn't log to the Windows Event Log. You need to filter and see what Service Control Manager events are there.\n. Please try if this experimental release fixes the issue.\n. The window issue is fixed but not release yet. As for your answer on the service: what?\n. So what does the event log say now?\n. I added some time measurements to this release. Please try this one and submit the log pack after reboot.\n. The logs tell the service is starting within the expected time span; I'm afraid I'm out of ideas...\n. You could also try to set the service start mode from Automaticto Automatic (Delayed Start)\n. What is \"high\" CPU usage? What are the specs of the machine(s)?\n. What version of the software are you using? Are you using a Bluetooth adapter? Are any controllers connected? Does this also happen if you manually restart the service from the service console?\n. The release you're using if over a month old. Please update and try again.\n. You don't have to stop the service by your own, the installer will take care of everything and prompt you for any additional actions needed. I recommend you to get the latest beta.\n. You can select installing them in the setup under Testing & Troubleshooting / ScpToolkit Debug Symbols\n. You could do a Save as... and submit the .sleepy file so I can open and analyze it myself.\n. Great, thanks. I'll have a look.\n. Can I also have you log package please.\n. I now know what the problem is but not yet how to fix it. Stay tuned.\n. I think the libusbK.sys driver is to blame here (which I ditched in the upcoming release) so please check out the very next release to see if this fixes your issues.\n. Yupp, fell over that myself, thanks, Microsoft =D\n. Yeah currently this is buggy behavior, I'm on it!\n. Your error where logged, so thanks for the pack :) you have a pretty low-level USB error. Are you 100% sure the USB cable you used isn't in some way damaged or worn out? Is the USB port on your DualShock wiggly or in some other way noticeably loose or broken?\n. Some quick googling after the error code 0x80004005, maybe helpful:\n- http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/error-0x80004005-window-10-update-failure/156adfb8-e7e1-46fa-b5c6-cbd5dcfebbb9\n- http://www.infoworld.com/article/2960528/patch-management/windows-10-patch-kb-3081424-can-crash-fail-to-install.html\n- http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/cumulative-update-for-windows-10-for-x64-based/792cfa6a-c08d-4ddb-be99-71b440d51252\n. What other Linux software? Unfortunately most android apps are closed source; I have tried to contact the author of the \"Sixaxis Controller\" app but got no response so far. I'd love to see some code working with those knock-offs...\n. Ah, didn't know these, will have a peek, thanks :)\n. When Windows Error Reporting kicks in it means the program has crashed and can't recover from it. You'll find additional info about the crash in the Windows Event Log (google). My interface is in German but you should be able to find the entries by following this screenshot:\n\n. @Ninja92 please try the latest stable release; I added some more error handling to the Driver Installer start-up. Also please Install the ScpToolkit Debug Info Collector component, run it after you encountered an error, and follow its instructions.\n. Damn, what's happening on your machine @_@ please zip up and attach the files in the Logs folder here for my review.\n. Happy new year to you too :)\nThat's weird; is C:\\ScpToolkit\\ your install path? Does this file C:\\ScpToolkit\\libwdi\\amd64\\libwdi.dll exist on your side?\n. Do you have UAC disabled? Have you used this install folder with older versions too? Did you try to uninstall, fully delete the folder by hand and do a fresh install?\n. Did you delete the folder after uninstall? Yes, I mean this setting. I'd stick to Microsofts recommendation and set this to its default level or else it might have weird side effects with programs requiring administrator rights. From the logs you submitted I assume a file permission problem.\n. What path did you install it to?\n. I created a chat room on Github, wanna switch over there?\n. Nice! What was the problem?\n. Well good for you! Have fun playing! :)\n. What do you mean by \"you can't move your mouse with it\"? Did you try it with a game? Or joy.cpl?\n. Glad to hear, have fun gaming!\n. @mirhl: It's not enabled by default 'cause I was afraid (and got feedback in the meantime too) it might still be buggy - which it sadly is. I'm investigating ;)\n. It definitely doesn't work reliably to mix \"genuine\" physical Xbox 360 controllers and DS3/4s due to a confirmed bug in the virtual bus driver. I'm currently testing a fixed build but even if I fix it I can't ship the fix yet 'cause I still don't own a code signing certificate (thanks, COMODO! >_<) \n. @nileplumb just a few minutes ago I dumped the request to COMODO, instead got a cert from Certum within only two days!!! Back on track! Testing the fixed code right now. Looks promising.\n. It's working! They can finally live in harmony side-by-side:\n\nNote that the genuine Xbox 360 Controllers are occupying slots 1 and 2 while the aftermarket DualShock 3 gets slot 3 assigned. What a great feeling :+1: \n. Now I'm not a narcissist by any means but this makes me a little bit proud :')\n\n. @charlesmilette I will make the setup do all the heavy lifting and put any manual actions in the notes of the upcoming release. Next build will have some big improvements but will be user-friendly to upgrade.\n. @SakifX9 I have some testing left to do, also have to finish the new instructions in the driver installer... If everything goes according to plan maybe upcoming weekend or the one after that.\n@charlesmilette no, this would not be possible since kernel-mode drivers have to be signed with a root CA cross-signed by Microsoft, we're doing this legit ;D\n. @charlesmilette the libwdi root certificates are created for the user-mode WinUSB.sys driver; its auto-generated on every machine so no one (not even myself) can accidentally leak any private keys that could be used to harm other users machines. It's not a mechanism I invented; it's how libwdi is designed. I'll think about improving this further.\n. @SakifX9 @mirh Done!\n. @mirh now why's that?\n. @charlesmilette Oops, I guess :3\n. @mirh gawddamit. Well, would've been too easy wouldn't it. EDIT: corrected.\n. The driver *.INF files for Bluetooth and controllers are always created on demand, that's why you won't find any shipped with the setup. The driver itself is embedded in libwdi.dll and gets customized for every system it's installed on. That's how libwdi is designed so I stick to that.\n. Not really, I know I'm far behind the documentation, I promise improvement ;)\nThe switch from WinUSB to libusbK was a bit of an accident I'm afraid when I was diagnosing problems with the DS4 and I didn't switch back because... reasons =P\n. Every method has it's own pros and cons:\n- Using your standard signed INF/CAT/SYS configuration for shipping drivers is the easiest for the end-user since the installation can be handled by OS-included tools. Downside is that an additional Hardware ID which might be perfectly compatible breaks consistency of the INF with the signature and you (well, me) have to re-sign it.\n- Using additional tools like libwdi (the core that powers Zadig) overcomes the signature limitation by re-creating a self-signed INF for every device/installation. Downside of this is a breach of privacy since the end-users certificate store has to be modified and it also depends on libwdi to work on every target system.\nSo there is no clear winner. As a developer less code is better code so I'll stick with the first method.\n. Just felt the urge to clarify. =P\n. Fixed; will be included in the next release, thanks for reporting.\n. Ok what am I missing here? After reading the thread multiple times I don't understand your question? Enlighten me! :)\n. @mirhl haha indeed it does :D didn't even see it!\n. A quick search reveals this. Damn AV \"solutions\" =P It's a false-positive for you worried folks.\n. I did; submission failed due to an unknown error... I won't trace this any further 'cause I feel like false detection is kinda the problem of the AV industry and not mine. If you don't trust me, compile it yourself, it's as simple as that with open source.\n. I was able to borrow a Microsoft Xbox 360 Wireless controller and receiver from a friend and as soon as I plug in the receiver the VBus ain't happy anymore =/ I'm on it.\n. Oooops, damn string quotations =D thank you!\n. Thanks for considering a donation :) I set a PayPal button up on my main forum thread here.\n. Thank you kindly :)\n. Thanks for your enthusiasm, I have a collection of links regarding code from the Linux world to look into but due to my tight schedule I just haven't had the time to read them yet. I'm sure the answers are out there somewhere ;)\n. Sorry, name can't be changed since that's a libwdi thing. Service keeps the dongle occupied since it acts as the Bluetooth stack and has to respond to connection requests.\n. Since you told the program to replace your mouses driver... what did you expect to happen? Revert the changes by hand in Windows Device Manager and revert to the correct HID driver. Be more careful next time; randomly checking boxes without knowing the consequences is... yeah.\n. Please try this release, I added a checkbox to the Settings manager where you can choose between sync and async processing. Please provide feedback if the default (unticked) setting helps your issue.\n. @Hoshiyuu ah thanks, typo fixed! You don't have to re-connect btw. ticking this box and closing instantly saves and activates it.\n. @Hoshiyuu I'll test myself again using the old-fashioned way - by playing games ;)\nMay I ask what system you're using? Up-to-date CPU? I'm still a bit thrown off this makes things worse and not better on multi-core systems...\n. Thank you for your detailed reports. I need to review the logs before I can give an answer.\n. Your wish will be granted!\n. Done; check out the latest release :)\n. The current tray tool is just a quick hack to display messages to the user; its functionality will be merged into a new tool (ScpToolkit Control Panel) which will also supersede the Monitor tool. Its currently in very early development and not ready to be released, FYI.\n. Can confirm, working on a fix.\n. Well, the profile manager is still highly experimental...\n. @marcelodcs nope.\n. Try the latest release please; I fixed some nasty bugs there, might affect your behavior if we're lucky.\n. Because it would pretty much break all links circulating around?\n. Uuuuhh, fancy! I'll be brave and try then =]\n. Great Scott, it worked! Thanks for the suggestion and the links!\n. Does this occur on a fresh installation or on an update? \n. Yepp, that's a problem with the vbus driver. Hopefully I'll come up with a solution. Debugging kernel-mode drivers sucks though X_x\n. This is fixed in the next release.\n. Uh sorry but what exactly do you mean by that?\n. Is this the value you're talking about?\n\n. @charlesmilette that's a bug.\n. I see, I'll look into it.\n. I took a close look and it seems that the IG (Device instance GUID) that x360ce reports is composed of multiple sources. Once I figured out how it's composed I'm positive I can solve this. Will browse through x360ce`s sources...\n. Thank you very much for your input; I'm currently very busy but I hope I can build a fixed version soon!\n. I fixed it! Thanks again for your contribution :+1: \n. I will add some more settings to allow more control over them in a future release.\n. I think there's still an issue in the code when the quadstick gets queried for its Bluetooth address - which it doesn't have. I'll look into this.\n. I will refine the updater to remain silent if there are no new versions in the next release.\n(I got annoyed by it too =P)\n. Trust me if I currently could I would devote more time to the project =/\n. @CoBrA2168 right.\n. I'll prioritize this although I honestly have no idea why this bug was introduced...\n. This issue is fixed in the upcoming release.\n. Yupp that's a bug. Will try to replicate ASAP.\n. Nope; the DS4 works differently because it has a dedicated \"PC-Mode\" which lets it pair with other devices than the PlayStation. The DS3 doesn't have this feature so the complete PlayStation Bluetooth-Stack has to be emulated. There's no way around this.\n. I just love it when older releases work better than newer ones -_- I will investigate...\n. Because you selected your Logitech G400 Optical Mouse as a DualShock 3 Controller in the driver installer and overwrote its default driver? Follow this guide.\n. So is there still an issue with an up2date version?\n. Sadly this isn't fixable at the moment. If you experience this it means the controller is not supported.\n. This gets fixed in an upcoming version.\n. I fixed this; will be included in the next release!\n. I'll look into this ASAP.\n. Can you provide more detail? It annoys me to no end when problems appear between commits I can't explain. I'll browse through the changes since that tag once more but I need more info.\nWhat controller exactly do you use? Do you use multiple? Problems with all of them? Current Windows version? Problems differ using USB or Bluetooth?\n. One more: does v1.5.5730.24251 still work for you or already introduce problems?\n. Uuuh the link I provided takes you right to the download? Have a direct link to the archive.\nGetting recognized as fake is an important fact, please execute the ScpToolkit Debug Info Collector utility and submit the archive it generates. Should contain all the necessary info to start investigating for me. If it's a genuine controller but recognized as fake the program will behave differently which may cause unexpected behavior!\n. What's your controllers MAC address?\n. Your controller uses a Bluetooth chip from AzureWave Technologies Inc., did a bit of research and it looks like Sony also uses their chips in some VAIO notebook models so I guess we can assume the controller is genuine. Meanwhile you could try to add the line GenuineMacAddress = 08:A9:5A in ScpControl.ini below the section [Host Controller Interface] (on a \"problematic\" version ofc.) and see if behavior changes for you.\nAgain: problems occur only during usage over USB (wired), Bluetooth (wireless) or both?\nYou can review all the logs in the Logs sub-directory yourself using YALV!, if you need more insight it'd probably be better to clone, compile and debug. Since I don't know where to look I can't just throw in more logging everywhere. You can't log logic errors.\n. Thank you!\n. Quick Google search reveals everything.\n. Try sfc /scannow\n. What manufacturer is your Bluetooth host? Did you check against the compatibility list?\n. Holy sh*t! That's not supposed to happen, could you compress and post me at least parts oft the file so I can investigate?\n. To your first question: nope.\n. That's expected behavior, the Server executable is a legacy component. The error message tells you the facts; you just not run both the service and the Server. Period. Forcing a controller disconnect isn't implemented in any of the tools yet.\n. @mmathys hold on 'till the next version, there are some huge changes involved.\n. Please post a screenshot of the Universal Serial Bus Devices section in your Windows Device Manager.\n. What Spam?\n. You can either follow @mirh 's suggestion or run the setup and uninstall the ScpToolkit Tray Notifications component.\n. Hopefully the next release will help!\n. A tad more info on the BSOD itself would indeed be helpful...\n. So no BSOD dump after a month, I think I'll close this one.\n. This behavior will be fixed in the upcoming release; then the DualShock`s will behave just like Xbox controllers and will respect connection order, free slots and slots occupied by real Xbox controllers.\n. Can't tell much about integrated Bluetooth chipsets since manufacturers drivers always do some weird magic not available to the public. Try getting one of the compatible dongles.\n. There is no check what the listed devices are, that's why you - the user - have to tell the program what's a Bluetooth dongle. The list just shows all detected USB devices.\nThis will get improved in a future version.\n. I'm currently online ;)\n. No you won't, the Dongle becomes dedicated to SCP and all currently connected Bluetooth devices will immediately lose connection.\n. Nope.\n. Do you have a dedicated switch one one of your laptops side? Typically you can turn off Bluetooth and wireless networking with that. If not - sorry, no power savings implemented in the software.\n. The software-turn-off typically only works with the original manufacturers drivers.\n. Well, what's your expectation on \"stop the Bluetooth\"?\n. Weeeeeeeeell, yeah, it was slapped in rather sloppy I have to admit ;) My main motivation of introducing them was so users would know whats going on in more detail without having to consult the logs with a separate log viewer all the time. I agree there is room for improvements though.\n. You don't have a problem with the profiler, the profiler is a problem... Don't use it. It's not finished and shouldn't have been released in the first place.\n. Since I can't see this being an actual bug repprt I'll close.\n. All future releases will suppress this window on the scheduled checks.\n. @tomahawk51 yeah, it's annoying to me too, sadly I pushed the last release without realizing this stupid dialog, next release will remain silent, I promise!\n. A kernel crash dump would really help to debug this =/\n. =D I think @shauleiz Browser is going wild or something...\n. Since the BSOD happens because of ScpVBus.sys connecting the controller making it happen is only a side-effect since once the controller gets connected, the virtual X360 pad gets spawned. That's probably when things go wrong.\n. @alvarosg sure have one but first; what's your exact Windows version and architecture (64-Bit, 32-Bit)?\n. @alvarosg I just assume your system is 64-Bit so here we go:\n1. Stop the ScpService.\n2. Open up Windows Device manager, in the category System search for Scp Virtual Bus Driver and uninstall it.\n3. Download this: ScpVBus_NEW_BETA_x64.zip\n4. Unblock it.\n5. Extract it to some arbitrary location.\n6. Open an elevated command prompt (Google).\n7. Navigate into that folder (using cd, Google)\n8. Execute devcon install ScpVBus\\ScpVBus.inf Root\\ScpVBus\n9. Start the ScpService.\n10. Cross fingers and test.\nThanks.\n. @alvarosg great news to me! I basically updated the surrounding development kits to Microsofts latest and greatest ones for Windows 10, created a proper compiling environment by introducing a fresh Visual Studio Project and had some help from @shauleiz :) I moved the bus driver to a separate repository btw., there you can read on the commits and changes which happened since Scarlet.Crushs original code base.\nPS: I do! You can find my PayPal button on the forums.\n. @shauleiz yep, I also stumbled upon this. That's why I included the manual driver removal in my short installation instruction above. The installer of ScpToolkit takes this into account but I don't know if I can put some sort of protection into the driver itself to avoid this.\nEDIT: no I don't rely on this specific path; I query the system for the path by enumerating interfaces with the bus GUID.\n. @shauleiz this kind of protection is already included in the ScpToolkit Driver Installer. I created the XOutput project as a convenient user-mode library for interacting with the bus, abstracting away the DeviceIoControl calls. Still a work-in-progress though. As for doing this in the driver itself; is it save to call functions from setupapi.lib from a kernel-mode driver?\n. ScpMonitor is still shipped even with my fork although a replacement for it is already in the works but nowhere near release state yet. You can set the LEDs to indicating the charging level in the Settings Manager.\n. Beware that the current state of the code isn't stable nor have I changed anything regarding the counterfeit pads so I'm not surprised it doesn't work. It's on my To-Do.\n. @ManHunter thanks btw. for your dedication of even making a video! Images say more than a thousand words.\n. Thanks but don't waste your time polishing bug reports on this issue, I already know what's the problem but haven't had enough time and/or play with the controllers to invent a fix.\n. @LOSSLOSS no problem, just wanted to point this out for other readers.\n. @j0shg I actually tried to get in touch with the developer but got no reply sadly.\n. Daaaaaamn... coming back looking at the progress you guys made, wanted to test it out and my last working PANHAI just bit the dust >< Bluetooth won't work anymore. Guess I tortured them too much with the soldering iron last time... Won't get a refund I'm afraid X)\n. I guess you just ticked every check box you could find in the driver installer and overwrote drivers for your keyboard and such... Well, plug in an external USB keyboard and undo your damage manually using Windows Device Manager.\n. \n. No worries, I understood what you wrote, I just don't get how an USB plug-in event could mess up your screen...\n. I don't have the slightest idea what to advise you; that just sounds too weird @@\n. Glad it's of use to you :)\n. @RED-404 I see Microsofts great plan of continuously throwing out high-quality updates really goes along well :D\n. @RED-404 ah, good to know :+1: \n. Thanks for the update!\n. Aaaaaaand what about that Bluetooth USB Host Controller in the first pic?\n\n. Composing ideas\n. Aborting composing ideas =D\n. Thanks for the visual content, the profile manager currently isn't even alpha stage so no fix available yet.\n. \nYou better start all over...\n. Soooo, issue can be closed then?\n. Then do it please to keep things tidy here... I did it for you.\n. The setup should prompt for elevation automatically if needed. Do you have UAC disabled/on the lowest setting? This can cause problems AFAIK.\n. First of all; are you a 100% sure you wiped all traces of MiJ before you migrated over? Since MiJ drivers spoof a lot of hardware IDs it may still interfere on your system.\n. I don't have the slightest idea how PC Remote Play will work but if it expects the DS4 to be connected via standard hidusb.sys, then no, they won't happily co-exist I'm afraid.\n. Update: when ViGEm is finished this will be possible!\n. @julianxhokaxhiu It's already working perfectly with ViGEm & VDX.. It won't show any windows anymore in the next and all future releases, I already made the necessary adjustments weeks ago.\n. I don't own those peripherals so can't make any promises unless someone else submits code or hardware.\n. That's because I'm an idiot >_< I somehow overlooked that the wrong hardware ID is in the Ds3Controller.inf file. If you have a look in your device manager you should see something like this:\n\nFor a manual fix, try replacing the assigned drivers manually:\n\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: ba-dum-ts\n. I ran the latest ScpVBus.sys with the verifier enabled and didn't get an DRIVER_VERIFIER_IOMANAGER_VIOLATION error any more. Can you try again but first check which version of the bus driver you are running? \n. @charlesmilette I'm seeing ghosts; tested it so many times and it worked. Please try this:\n- Stop the service\n- Go to your installation directory\n- Delete the file ScpControl.settings\n- Start the service\n- Test again\nThanks.\n. I crafted a guide on how to remove toolkit remains by hand.\n. Oh c'mon you can't be serious:\n\nI accidentally put the hardware ID of the Xbox 360 controller in the Ds3Controller.inf file... I have to package and release an emergency-build to fix that.\n. In none of my Test-Virtual-Machines ranging from Windows 7 to Windows 10 I had any problems with the signature. I'm downloading Windows 10 Client Insider Preview - Build 14295 English right now to see if I can somehow re-create this behavior.\nSadly there's like a million advice posts on Google related to mysterious driver signature issues so I'm kinda at a loss to what I should recommend you to do...\n. I tested it on a clean installation of Windows 10 build 10586:\n\nI whacked together a small demonstration video (excuse the crude quality, I'm currently testing a new screen capture software) where everything looks fine.\n. @psyke83 weird, I do have the latest WDK installed and used it to sign, verification also seems fine:\n\nBut you do seem to be on the right track here; neither of my systems are running in SecureBoot, I'll investigate.\n. This is getting absurdly ridiculous :angry: But some good news; I'm in contact with a company to acquire a certificate from GlobalSign which should still work without this \"send-to-M$\" BS. Since I don't own a company I can't buy directly from them myself :disappointed: \n. @Alpharou because it uses an older, buggy build of the ScpVBus not built nor signed by me.. Oh I sure did notice, but I was sick the last couple of days so I'm slowly catching up on all the e-mails.\n. Thank you very much :+1: \n. I'm currently installing VS 2015 Update 2. I'm still working with 2013 on the project since it's stable and all my extensions work within it. Might try to fully migrate to 2015 if some bugs have been fixed by M$ and all my extensions work as good as in 2013.\n. Ah I see. I personally prefer to linger with the older versions since software of this magnitude tends to be more buggy the younger it is.\n. Fake controllers currently not supported on a stable basis.\n. There is indeed just a README included.\n. No need for multiple issues; we're all getting notifications on new posts.\n. @acme420 does your system use UEFI (SecureBoot)?\n. @charlesmilette d'oh, right!\n. Does the last v1.6.x release work on your system?\n. I just tripple-checked the certificates and cross-certificates used in my production release signing process and according to MSDN I used the correct cross-certificate and tools so for now I'm honestly out of ideas on how to pin down the signing issues :(\n. @psyke83 I'd rotate in glee if that's the issue :+1: \n@acme420 could you please try this:\n1. Install the latest 1.7 beta as usual.\n1. After you finished the installation, manually update the driver on the Scp Virtual Bus Driver using this specific version: ScpVBus_x64.zip\n1. Test and report back ASAP :)\n. I let Visual Studio do the signing (yes, shame on my laziness), it uses the following command line:\n\"CN=\"WDKTestCert Benjamin,1309XX....\" | BD19668454XXX...\" \"E=nefarius@dhmx.at, CN=\"Open Source Developer, Benjamin H\u00f6glinger-Stelzer\", O=Open Source Developer, C=AT | 61197CF2XXX...\" \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\CrossCertificates\\Certum Trusted Network CA.crt\" /fd\"sha256\"\nWhere Certum Trusted Network CA.crt I gathered from here.\n. This time I manually signed the catalog and the driver like:\nsigntool sign /v /ac \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\CrossCertificates\\Certum Trusted Network CA.crt\" /sha1 6119XXX... /fd sha256 /tr http://sha256timestamp.ws.symantec.com/sha256/timestamp/ scpvbus.cat\nsigntool sign /v /ac \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\CrossCertificates\\Certum Trusted Network CA.crt\" /sha1 6119XXX... /fd sha256 /tr http://sha256timestamp.ws.symantec.com/sha256/timestamp/ scpvbus.sys\nRelease for tests: ScpVBus_x64.zip\n. Nonononono, not install via the .inf file, you need to hit the Update button on the existing bus in Windows Device Manager.\n. See my previous post.\n. @acme420 since the driver is for virtual \"hardware\" the procedure is a tad different.\n. scartches head\n. Right.\n. Oh btw.: can you check if you have the following Windows Updated installed? In a pretty outdated test-machine of mine I had to install it for the signature check to work.\n. \n. @acme420 might be worth a try.\n. Uh cool, I guess...\n\nAnyways, glad we could solve this. Indeed I have a PayPal account.\n. @psyke83 thank you very much for the provided link it answered so many questions straight instead of the blurry outdated results many google searches gave me. I read about the loophole he mentions and consider acquiring a GlobalSign certificate if that fixes everything.\n. Sounds like a hardware issue since the software simply translates what the controller sends in.\n. What version are you using?\n. UAC is enabled? Still happening after reboot?\n. Have you tried to explicitly run the setup as Administrator?\n. Nothing I could change about this since propper connectivity has to be assured by the operating system.\n. There is no way around manually changing the device driver if you want to accomplish this.\n. Which software version are you running?\n. @jloehr hey hey, nice to see you here, love your work!\nOk it seems like I have to clarify a few things. Here we go:\n- Until about three month ago I never did actual driver development (the Toolkit 100% user-mode and ~90% .NET) and simply adopted the original idea of the creator of ScpServer to use general-purpose device drivers like WinUSB (switching to libusbK was my mistake; I attempted to solve a problem with it that had a complete different cause, well, you always learn something new...) and implementing all the protocols within .NET and the Windows Service. This had the advantage that rapid development was possible; compared to kernel-mode stuff testing .NET apps is easy. Anyways, this has now changed. Thanks to Shaul my interest in developing actual kernel-mode drivers was lit an I dedicated every single free moment of my time learning and experimenting. I rewrote the ScpVBus.sys (Xbox 360 controller driver) in KMDF as my playground and just recently added a working DualShock 4 emulator to it. I also began to implement a USB<->HID driver for the DS3 so in a somewhat distant future the toolkit won't be required anymore for out-of-the-box DS3 HID support.\n- In USB mode the DS3 requires some additional control requests sent to it so it will start sending HID reports. It might even be possible to get away with a filter driver to add this functionality but I have to test this first. Once it starts sending it uses standard-conform HID input reports. The DS3 doesn't support pairing via common ways; the Bluetooth host`s MAC it shall connect to has to be sent to the DS3 once over USB via control request. That's why it won't pair with default Windows Bluetooth stacks.\n- In Bluetooth mode it uses a custom protocol via L2CAP so maybe also a filter driver could solve this but again, I'm at the beginning of my kernel-journey :)\nHope this sums it a with not too much rambling.\n. @mirh Ohohohoho interesting! rubs hands\n. We have some progress!\n. @charlesmilette no worries; I've got that covered too :wink: \n. @fqlx if you \"just\" need XInput support you'd rather want to check out the actual emulation driver or even better its successor. Though both APIs aren't fully finished yet.\n. Do you mean the VID/PIDs of the original \"feeding\" hardware controller? Or different IDs for the emulated Xbox controller? Sorry, I don't seem to get it @@\n. Ah I see. But don't you face problems with a lot of devices just spoofing \"genuine\" VID/PIDs especially for gamepads?\n. I did dome testing and I can confirm that I in fact _can provide the original IDs :smiley: \n. Have you tried the manual removal?\n. Thanks for the dump file, that really solved the mystery; that controller is in no way DualShock compatible so no wonder it goes crazy. I could add support later in the future.\n. Have you tried this already?\n. I'd consider this answered.\n. It heavily depends on the games you use. The main purpose of the toolkit is to make the DualShocks available through XInput while the DirectInput support is a nice side-effect of Microsoft`s own XUSB driver. I'm currently experimenting with lifting the limits of supported controllers but then again; the current API limit in XInput (which every game with Xbox controller support uses) if 4 controllers. That's not in any way a hardware limitation but a limit that Microsoft themselves forced onto developers if they only use XInput.\n. @bigbear2nd in my current development I could theoretically support tens or even hundreds of emulated controllers but still; games using XInput won't profit from that.\nWouldn't hurt if we had a list on games :)\n. Made my day :D\n. Have you tried the latest beta too?\n. LOL two weeks old...\n\n. True that, like many things =3\n. The updater behavior is tamed down since 1.7\n. @Jop-V this would be achieved by the new profile manager which is stuck in development hell since months =3 So sadly currently not possible without 3rd party tools.\n. @mirh I guess you will love this once it's finished ;)\n. With more and more knowledge of the wonders of the KMDF I also grow more and more powerful!\n\n. What I've learned from tinkering with device driver development is, that whenever you can you should incorporate with the existing Microsoft drivers so errors and development overhead is minimized. I like the modular approach; in my rewrite of the ScpVBus I already designed it with driver-to-driver communication in mind. This would allow to easily (with a few lines of code) add XInput support to HID-Wiimote and other projects.\n. @mirh Your wish is beeing implemented :smiley: \n. \n. That's a Windows-thingy and nothing I can fix.\n. Your input is highly appreciated.\n. @merklaw a 100% on the spot :smile: \n. I will consider adding an \"advanced mode\" to the installer which let's you do that again by hand. On the other hand; could you please provide the Hardware ID of your motherboard Bluetooth? Then I could add it to future releases as a supported device.\n. Since you didn't include any information on which version you used I assume you haven't tried the latest 1.7 beta?\n. The profile manager in its current form is way below alpha stage, that's why it's not included in the default setup. I'll announce it when it's usable.\n. Holy sh* you are the master of GitHub, I can't read this fast, gimme a few minutes =D\n. I'm slowly catching up; my mail server died the day I went on vacation so I currently can't get interrupted by anyone xD\n. Since this is expected behavior it's not worth keeping an open issue.\n. I wasn't aware the toolkit is affected? To my knowledge it isn't.\n. It simply is a piece of sht, sorry for that :laughing: \n. It's not suspicious at all; since the sounds come from a Windows service that's running with high privileges the mixer can't get access to the process name or window title so it shows that the name is not available.\n. Ta-Da!\n. @rougetimelord I'm in the middle of the process of getting a compatible certificate. Since Microsoft broke Secure Boot recently you might to reconsider relying on that feature :laughing: \n. That's not directly a driver issue, more of a .NET availability issue; .NET 4.5 doesn't install on XP so a large portion of the toolkit won't run. As for my other driver projects on the other hand... :wink: \n. Don't worry; I might not be that active here currently but I won't just run a script to close 'em all :laughing: \nWhat I learned from this project; don't publish beta releases, it's only stressful for both parties...\n. @charlesmilette thing is; I will lose my sanity and possibly freak out if I get more \"I can't install because it's not signed blah blah...\" BS so I try to get things right on the first release. M$ lately also being a b$tch with their new driver signing policy... Some very special people might get an early build though :wink: \n. Yep.\n. Smells like a hardware problem; the USB port on your controller might have become loose and randomly causes issues on the PCB. The software just translates so randomness most of the time emerges from the controller itself.\n. What version of SCP and PCSX2 are you running?\n. AFAIK PCSX2 1.4.X broke compatibility, I fixed it in my new project.\n. Yes, FireShock. I don't know what you tried to install since I haven't released it yet :laughing:\n. Well, builing and installing a kernel driver is a whole different story :smile: I'm only one person working on three coding projects in my free time, there will be updates but they will come at my own pace.\n. Get a different brand mouse/keyboard loaned by a friend/school/workplace and follow this guide.\n. That's because it's alpha and marked unstable.\n. Don't use MiJ together with ScpToolkit, all hell may break loose and fck things up.\n. That's why DirectX is listed in the README as a dependency... \n. Hang on, if you HAVE to copy the DLL then your DX installation might be damaged; all the DLL should be loaded from the system directory automatically.\n. Odd, Microsofts new update policy sure causes some weird stuff.\n. Could it possibly mean that BETA indicates it's not stable, I wonder...\n. Sigh\n. I'll just remove the audio BS entirely since it seems to just cause headaches. I still stand by my words though; it's a Windows permission issue, not mine :wink:\n. A common workaround would be to create a separate process which runs in the current users session that creates the sound player. Not worth it though, I'll kick the entire feature.\n. @charlesmilette the last time I introduced checkboxes and free will to the driver installer I ended up with lots of angry comments from idio... I mean users which disabled mice and keyboards \ud83d\ude09 no software can ever replace a good functioning human brain.\n. You could gift me one and I make a driver \ud83d\ude09 \n.

Currently all lines are busy, your input is redirected to our complaint department. Have a safe and productive day.\n. @BioGenx2b would you mind removing this signature/footer/ad thingy that attaches to your posts? It's not helping anyone, thanks.. So?. The issue contains a vague statement which I can't replicate so I'm at a loss of what to tell you.... If the service get's marked for removal \"on its own\" there's more wrong than just the AU. Maybe your Antivirus is interfering or smth. this simply shouldn't happen.. Very useful comment. Won't change anything though since no one has improved the code since. Nice deadline request, as if you could demand something on a free tool \ud83d\ude06 . It means that the ScpVBus driver component isn't present or failed to start. Look in your device manager under System Devices for a device with the yellow error mark.. What's. The. Error. Message. \ud83d\ude1e . @charlesmilette yeah, which I could verify if someone would at least think of posting a screenshot so I don't have to rely on my broken crystal ball.... I made a video tutorial about the installation. @lehleh you could've saved yourself a lot of time if you'd have checked out this before.. Well, a problem I could solve \ud83d\ude09 . Please stop reporting issues about the Profile Manager; I shouldn't even have released it in the first place.... I'm not stopping anyone to contribute \ud83d\ude09 . Yes; make backups and don't select it in the installer.... It's intended behavior; the other tabs aren't implemented.. It is in v1.7.. \n. That's a mobile chipset, so no, not possible.. Then DirectX Runtime isn't installed, like mentioned in the prerequisites.. @Dienfive No\n@sollano there will be.. No and no, it's supposed to auto-start. That's why it's a service.... The ScpVBus doesn't interact with hard drives at all.. Wow, you are a terrible human being. Glad you remembered my why I disabled notifications.. So what if it's in that folder? It's writable by any program running under your user. What version are you running? You got the setup from GitHub? My releases are signed, you checked that?\nInnocence until proven guilty, same with malware so thanks for the report but I don't think I can help here \ud83d\ude0f . It's hard-coded.

The difference for me is that it only affects the Screen Saver - it does not affect the Video Off function.\nI have the following settings:\nScreenSaver - 1 minute\nVideo Off - 5 minutes\nSleep - Never (have a RAID controller that doesn't support it)\nHave not tested with a DS4; however, with a DS3 controller if it is plugged in and on, or if it is on via Bluetooth, then the Screensaver will not activate. That being said, the Video Off will still work at 5 minutes even though the Screensaver was blocked.\nIf I turn off the DS3 controller - without having to touch the SCP service - the Screen Saver will work again.\nThe frustration for me is that I have Windows require a password on wakeup; however, since the Video is going off without the ScreenSaver running, it will not ask for a password when woken up.\n. Just as an FYI - I had the same error - the \"libwdi.dll\" missing.\nI was able to get it working though.\nWhat I found was the following. When I first installed it listed 4 pre-reqs (Visual Studio packages). I don't recall what they were. For me it stated that I needed all but the third in the list, it claimed the third was already installed.\nI proceeded with the install, which included installing the pre-reqs that were missing. I couldn't get it to start and was getting the above error.\nI then uninstalled and tried installing again. This time the pre-reqs were inversed. It stated that I had all but the third (which it previously stated I had). I let it install that third pre-req, and then the install finished without a problem. It has been working fine since.\n. I also have this issue with CECHZC2U B1; This is a \"DUALSHOCK 3\" \"SIXAXIS\" controller. I bought it at Wal-Mart. SCP claims it's fake, but there is no issue using it. The only \"weird\" thing is when the controller disconnects from Bluetooth due to the timeout, SCP pops up an error. This does not happen if I disconnect the controller by holding the PS button - only if it times out from inactivity. With that said, the error has no adverse effect. I can reconnect without issue.. I found the solution in #179. See the post from nefarius on Apr 18, 2016.\nQuoted below for reference.\nAfter you make this change, you need to restart the \"SCP DSx Service\" windows service (or restart Windows).\nThis will also supposedly fix any jitter that would occur when connected over USB. I haven't confirmed this yet.\n\nYour controller uses a Bluetooth chip from AzureWave Technologies Inc., did a bit of research and it looks like Sony also uses their chips in some VAIO notebook models so I guess we can assume the controller is genuine. Meanwhile you could try to add the line GenuineMacAddress = 08:A9:5A in ScpControl.ini below the section [Host Controller Interface] (on a \"problematic\" version ofc.) and see if behavior changes for you.. Look through the logs and see if there's anything that stands out as an error.\n\nThey are usually located at: C:\\Program Files\\Nefarius Software Solutions\\ScpToolkit\\Logs. When you connect your DS3, does it show up something along the lines as \"Fake Dualshock 3\" or not genuine? I forgot the exact text.\nI had a similar issue with my genuine DS3 that was being incorrectly detected as fake. Once I corrected the issue so it recognized it as genuine, I no longer had the random upper-left pull.\nIf the MAC address of your controller starts with 08:A9:5A, then it could be the same issue. The solution is about half-way down in #179. Just search that thread for \"scpcontrol.ini\" to see how you need to modify that file. You'll have to restart the service afterwards (or restart Windows if it's easier for you).\nI'm not sure why it matters whether SCP Toolkit detects the controller as genuine or not - maybe something wrong with the \"workaround\" code.. I haven't had a chance to play with this yet to determine actual steps, but you should be able to find the Mac address through USB. At worst I believe you can see it in the scp legacy monitor.\nRegardless, it can't hurt just to follow those instructions to update the ScpControl.ini anyway. Best case it fixes it, worst case nothing changes.. ",

All I could find on this issue was \"sorry, your controller is not original\" - though seeing how mine came with a PS3...\nEDIT:\nIs xinput1_3.dll support still broken? Trying out the driver, xinput1_3.dll apps don't seem to work, but SDL2 apps do (which use xinput1_4.dll if available).\nEDIT2:\nNevermind, it's somehow working now.

Kind of. It's a hack, injecting code straight into latest Scarlett's ScpUser xinput1_3.dll on runtime.\n.

I noticed but ughh, these issues will never stop...with this new BTH dongle (in compatible devices list again) only analog sticks and face buttons work, the rest is broken. ffs.\n. Come to think of it, my issue might be similar - rumble seems to send some random data on analog sticks, effectively locking them.\nDo note this is for wired. Would still like to debug it and try to come up with a solution, though for the second time I don't remember where the input gets processed. Meh.\n. This issue sounds more like a demand, thus do you have any tips on how to do it? As far as I'm aware, the protocol hasn't been reversed by anyone at that time yet.\n.

No, please. Motionjoy is just a buggy adware. \nAs I said, try those alternatives (with these very drivers of course). Vibration should work with both. \n. >  it's just dead in the water\nThe problem is not just being dead. It's dead and buggy.\nI even got BSOD some times, even with latest version. Did I sound condescending? Well, that was it. \n\nAll i was originally asking for was built in direct input support so I didnt have to load 2 other applications \n\nThis driver is emulating a xbox 360 driver. DirectInput is emulated just like microsoft meant it to be. \nAs I said two times then, you either need Xinput Plus or xbcd drivers\n. You can adjust controllers order with x360ce. \nI'm not sure this is something better to be done on the driver level. \n. XOutput magic right?\nThough, I still wonder: isn't controller slot something \"system\"-wide rather than \"controllers\"-specific?\nWhy changing this should be conceptually in the driver?\n. Oh cool. \nCould that even help with #145 and #146 ?\n. As I said. Use x360ce. \n. http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Xbox_360_Controller_Emulator#Change_controller_slot. > I need SCP to detect it and then x360ce to map the controller\nExactly, so please stop commenting the driver. . Audio is only handled in PS4 mode (which means already paired?), but it disappear soon because it expects to be already paired in the first place. \nAssumed this problem was overcome (ideally requires a real ps4 to spoof), sound should shouldn't be hard to get through normal headset profile. \nSince HSP reportedly only supports CVSD (monophonic and just crappy for general audio) and PCM (too much bandwidth intensive afaik) though, I wonder if A2DP couldn't still be involved. \nAlso, Jays2Kings/DS4Windows#17\n. Everything about spoofing is already documented. \nMoreover, with PS4 being able to run Linux, perhaps in a few years special hardware won't even be required. \n. @charlesmilette \nTo be honest this is no W10 specific. I had similar issues with the service even on 7. \n. That should be already handled by \"delayed start\" setting. \nThough, I think logic shouldn't be put towards that. \nBut rather in don't making windows kill the hanging process (ie: by avoiding race conditions)\n. Try to put SCP service on \"Late\" start. \n. For usb you can already use fireshock. Pretty sure with zadig you can get basically just everything to work. \nI'm not sure if it was still available in last version of SCP, or you needed a slightly older one though. . :P\nAt the moment light bar and touchpad access in Windows are hacks at most (from games development side)\nA more standardized way (APIs like those for sixaxis and pressure sensitivity) would be fantastic. \nEDIT: ok it seems \"hacks\" aren't all this homebrew after all\n. Is this just a deadzones problem (aka game is stupid) or does Windows even report this big \"movement\"?\n. Check in device manager if the bluetooth adapter is indeed using the SCP driver. \n. @dEEE805 Does it work now?\n. Just tried to cleanwipe a fresh install and it worked. \nI guess it can be considered fixed. \n.

Pcsx2 uses the custom XInput.dll which you put inside its folder. \nThere's nothing to worry with dolphin then. \n. Just wait for new release, coming soon\u2122\n. \nI hate you\n. Btw, I'm afraid \"Every issue linked in this milestone\" link points to wrong page (only open issues are showed, but those are closed)\n. BT pairing is done by SCP service iirc. Pairing utility wasn't needed in the first place. \nThis driver should work with both DS, so I see no reason for this problem to happen. I'd suggest to check device manager for right-wrong drivers. \nYou can find previous versions here. \nLast, I really can't understand what's the fuss with slot order between SCP devices (#45 #207) but given the problems in there are supposed to be fixed, if you want to change slot number (especially in a mixed environment) you should be using x360ce. \n. > pairing is supposed to be done in SCP Driver Installer\nNo, pairing is not done at install time. It's handled by DS3/SCP service (idk right name now). \nService as in \"Windows service\". You can see it in task manager too. \n. Oh, thank you. \nI missed a lot of this new \"revamped architecture\" though. And there's nothing in the Wiki. \nIs there anywhere I could read on the reasons of the switch to libusb?\n. Ehrm.. well, you are the boss. \nThanks for your time!\n. Ehrm.. You already had answered to this question :p\nThis, if any, replies to #380, for as much as it doesn't mention the mini-HID driver scenario. \n. For god's sake uninstall motionjoy before all. \n. You didn't delete motionjoy if it's still shown between connected devices. \nTry to go in device manager and Uninstall \"delete driver\" the thing. \n. If the driver installer is reading MotionJoy Virtual Xinput Device for Windows that means device is being reported as such. And if this happens it means it's still using one of the mj .infs which is no good sign. \n. Check device manager for wherever the hell that entry is. \nPress uninstall driver, with the checkbox \"delete driver\" ticked. \n. So tell them it isn't. \n. @nefarius After thinking a bit over #170 ... couldn't it be you are wrongly querying axis and buttons?\nI mean were you aware there are actually 27 reported axis by controller itself (check linux driver)?\nA \"sequential\" kind of enumeration wouldn't get screwed if for some reason some of the legit ones had to stop working?\n. http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-input/msg48347.html\nhttps://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-input/list/?submitter=162701\nhttps://www.winehq.org/pipermail/wine-devel/2016-March/112074.html\n...\nYes, I'm lazy. I should check if this is fixed in Fireshock rather than procrastinate on mailing lists. . @nefarius It's not to be a pain in the ass, but libwdi dev said it's already possible to change driver name. \n. Take into account XInput itself doesn't support more than 4 controllers. \n. I wonder if this couldn't have something to do with how axis are enumerated #123 \n. No you are wrong, this was just about things using this driver and the lights on dualshock controllers. \nAnd \"preferred device\" setting is just something for old DirectInput games. \nWhat you are talking about is mixed (probably XInput) cases scenarios. \nIf the problem happens regardless of connection order, bump #207. Otherwise #45.\n. Every controller has a unique identifier, right?\nIf I had two real x360 controllers, programs would always see one with a code like 028e045e-0000-0000-0000-504944564944, and another with 028e045e-0000-0000-0000-504944564944 or similar. And they would be able to remember per-controller preferences. \nWith SCP I noticed in x360ce I always get the same one, no matter which of mine controllers I attach. \nNow, of course they are two identical DS3, so I'm not actually caring, but I see many people with \"mixed vendors\" compatible controllers would appreciate this. \n. Yes, those identifiers. They shouldn't be slot-fixed. \n. This driver purpose is making DS3 and DS4 controllers completely emulating an X360 controller. \nThat hasn't this. \nBesides, that japanese driver has already been reported to be bugged. \nOther solution like Xinput plus should be preferred. Similraly though, I don't see why that should be logically included in these drivers. \n. In other news, I just remembered https://github.com/nefarius/ScpToolkit/commit/85cc28dd30ff9489da047b82f4b8cd7c743c307c#comments\nI wouldn't know if it supports FFB, if ViGEm has anything comparable, and of course without #243 it's no \"universal\" solution for all controllers..

Because DS4 has a PC specific mode where it just work with bt own \"controller\" profile. \nDS3 hasn't this luxury afaik. \n. Open device manager and check?\n. Or you can just open device manager and revert back to default driver. \nAnyway, hopefully it will be fixed in next incoming version. \n. Duplicate of #154 and\n\nDelete ScpToolkit Tray Notifications shortcut from %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\n. If you are sure you haven't ticked bluetooth devices to overwrite in the installer then I guess this could be considered a duplicare of #174 \nOr better to wait for nefarious to know if selection of every bt dongle installed shouldn't on the other hand be the point here. \n. #218 seems to confirm my second guess. \n.  #380\n. I'm not sure how controller name and VID could help specifically.. \nCould you post the actual BSOD code?\n.

Check if Ds3service is still running. \n. > This is similar to issue #219, but I didn't want to hijack some else's bug.\n\nYou don't seem to grasp the idea of bug report. This isn't a \"forum\". You are expected to \"hijack\" bugs (which aren't \"owned\" by reporters btw ;))\n. Which standalone server are we talking about? I thought service was a required component. \n. I'm not sure that's expect to work.. \nIf I had to judge from the icon, I'd say it's a original scarlett.crush driver leftover. \n. Always unplug virtual controller is what you are looking for\n. Possibly related to #29 and #205\n. So.. can it be considered fixed?\n. Try to put SCP service on \"Late\" start. \n. Considering it doesn't even support W7, I'm guessing they decided to go full MS-Vision with APIs and all. \n. Perhaps it's just a simple name check. \nI'd try to change that with x360ce. \n. I didn't know there was an official remote play program for PS3 too, thanks. \nWe were talking of ps4 one here though. \n. I don't think you need anything that fancy. \nThough, I wonder if you couldn't have the DirectInput device (because that's what vanilla DS4 uses) expose the real thing. \nIdeally it shouldn't compromise XInput and 360 emulation. \n. Ps move already has its working driver, together with a cool API\nhttps://thp.io/2010/psmove/\n. Well, surprise surprise, that ain't like everything you connect to a PC. \nYou know, devices themselves know only a part of the equation at once. Something is needed to mix this information and expose it in a meaningful way to the OS. \n. #380\n. Similar symptoms as #299?\n. #380\n. Oh, hey there :s\nThe problem now is that different USB and Bluetooth device drivers are required. \nAnd I found your HID minidriver concept way more elegant and functional. \n. .-. \nIt doesn't connect directly for the same kind of reasons a Wiimote don't tbh. \n. Yes, that's how I'd describe DS3 functioning (which works out of the box in linux and some droids btw)\nIirc instead DS4 should even support normal HID protocol (plus its special \"ps4 mode\")\n. Looking also forward to Jays2Kings/DS4Windows#123 d:\n. #380\n. Kind of related to #146\n. He was talking of the original (probably so that he can show \"PS\" buttons) hardware, but I think this was kind of relevant to the same \"abstracting\" code of the other issue. \n. Cool, I guess this kind-of-allow nice driver to still have games with native DS4 support work\n(I use too often the word \"kind\")\n. #380\n. This used v1.6.238.16010. \nCan't you test newer one?\n. And ScpCleanWipe after normal uninstall doesn't help?\nAlso, I hope you weren't running mij before.\n. So.. can you close this?\n. It might be even possible.. But remember XInput is limited to just 4 players. \nDirectInput has no such limitation, but you are still limited by whatever protocol logically carry your data. And iirc Bluetooth is limited to 7 devices. \nFor as much as USB supports tons more, a seamless experience probably require a lot of fine tinkering. \n. Did you try to put SCP service to \"Late\" start as suggested here?\n. Ugh. \nI'd try to bump all threads, let's see. \n. Not that I'd like to trigger any anti-spam filter.. \nBut try to put SCP service on \"Late\" start. \n. If you want to switch button mapping, use x360ce. \n. I'd see the sense if SCPtoolkit wanted to really go universal (#243 and 85cc28dd30ff9489da047b82f4b8cd7c743c307c) but tbh, until it isn't that far I think efforts would be better spent elsewhere. \n. I'm dreaming of your tool to be like: \n\u2197 DirectInput\nHID \u2192 Raw Input API (at least this is what MS would recommend for #82 afaik)\n                                                                            \u2198 XInput\nEDIT: which, btw if you hadn't get it, it's a bit like you could supplant/include both Vjoy and x360ce features\n. Thinking to the aforementioned evil scheme, #290 last comment and #243.. I wonder if the whole thing couldn't become.. like modular?\nThere's a toy that converts standard Raw Input to DirectInput, one to XInput, then every supported controller would have one of those USB<->HID drivers you mention.. And then I guess a pretty bare \"profile\" could be made that maps HID signals to RI ?\n. Unzips\n. \n. #380\n.

No\nYes. \nAnyway, back to the problem.. I don't think it's really something with the driver itself being incompatible ViGEm -newest nefarious driver- for example is based on KMDF 1.9, supported under XP. And original SCP driver, same should work under XP. \nMy guess is that scptoolkit is now signed with a SHA-2 certificate, which folks claim to create problems with anything before Vista SP2. \nSo.. If I were you, I'd try to download WDK 7.1 (last to support XP), and compile my own driver with blackjack and hookers. \nThankfully, XP (even 64 bit version) shouldn't require any signing, so it should be ready to be tested. \nEDIT: or perhaps it's really just that drivers are compiled under VS2015 (or something along that) that by default just comes with newer incompatible WDK\n. I know there's wdk built-in vs2015, but I'm saying you can't build anything for XP (and perhaps even Vista!) with that. \n. Yes, as I said you'll need WDK 7.1.0 to be installed separately, even with vs2015. \n. Don't name it!\nBut.. Anyway, seeing it's just an installer incompatibility I guess so?\nAlbeit a bigger funnier question arises now: how's @nefarius going to treat all those 248 bugs -probably fixed in fireshock- now? \ud83d\ude04 \n. Mhh, I dunno, that seems kind of harsh. And for as much as.. I don't think SCP will be updated anymore, it still would feel kind to replace that closeissue function with pushmessage\nWhere message is something like: hi, this driver has been surpassed by this - link\nIs that enough to solve the problem? If so, feel free to close this issue. \nThen after a week we may proceed to manually close shit. \n. Or this\n. ",

All people who reported Windows' version said Windows 10, so I tought it might be because of that\nI think the problem is, the service starts up while everything else is also starting, that actually slowdowns the service's startup over the timeout\nThis might help.

Since the other things would have finished startup, the service will start in a reasonnable time\nThese are all assumptions, nothing actually real.\n. Probably this can help. If I read correctly, sending SetServiceStatus will prevent any timeout.\n. I just started my computer today, and left it on the lockscreen for at least 10 minutes.

The driver actually installs correctly, the Bluetooth feature just doesn't works #497 . What is the version given in the control panel?\n. Any game that has a vibration feature may do the trick :)\nThis link claims to say that you can test it with x360ce, but I haven't tried it. (I know this website looks a bit weird, but it is the first link that I've fallen on with a quick DuckDuckGo search)\n. Is there going to be any special procedures to migrate from the old driver to this one?\n. Will the new version require a root CA certificate?\n. @nefarius Which means that there will still be that \"libwdi\" root certificate?\n. That's a lot of emails in a short amount of time:\n\n. Funny. The picture has the same background color as the GitHub Dark UserStyles:\n\nAnyways, even if this bug gets fixed, some other errors may be encountered because it is highly experimental, as @nefarius said. Be careful when using it.\n. I find it a bit akward to have like 4 entries in the device manager, while I plugged only 2 unique DS3 controllers in my computer. A virtual device for each real device seams more appropriate than a virtual device per player slot.\n. Try to restart your computer, for it to reinstall the original driver\n. \n. Wow, that was fast.\n. If I install the bluetooth driver, will I be able to still use it for other things, because I only have the integrated bluetooth chip, and no dongle at disposition.\n. Any way to pair my DS3 with the computer without a special driver?\n. ;(\n. Finally, i said \"Screw this\" and I overwrote my bluetooth driver. I never used it before. BTW, how can I disable bluetooth (like not active) when my laptop is on battery, I need the more battery life possible for school.\n. No I don't have a switch on it, but I have a airplane mode button on it (FN + F12) I think this button is implemented with software, not hardware, so it will not work. (When I resetted my PC, I had to install a driver this button to work)\n. I just tried, it doesn't works. It just disables the Wi-Fi via Windows\n. If I stop and start the service, it then saids \"Initializing Bluetooth host\", does that means that stopping the service will stop the Bluetooth?\n. Full disable, like when you turn the Bluetooth switch on or off on a cellphone.\nI can't just unplug the dongle, it's a integrated card. The card is inside my computer. Plus the same card also gaves me WiFi.\n. Actually, I just kept the install like that and I got nothing wrong. The error is just something to get rid of, because it is not true it failed. All succeded, except the tray app.\n. The notifications could also use the old OS' toast notifications when not in the Win10 or Win8 notifications center\n. See bug #51, this is probably your problem. The driver isn't uninstalled it is not working.\n. This driver is only for\n\nand\n \nTheir unofficial alternatives may be supported.\n. @nikhosagala A simple change in the code could do it. The only problem would be backward compatibility.\n. Have you tried charging the faulty DS3 with a PS3?\nYou said it has been several years that you use this tool. Maybe your controller battery is too used to operate correctly or has reached it's maximum charge/discharge cycles.\n. Could you provide debug info? Maybe @nefarius could look into it.\n. Instructions on how to provide it would help.\n. Thanks for the 5 tips...\n. I never had to press the PlayStation button on the controller for it to get assigned.\n. Probably that the Bluetooth is faulty. Since you press the PS button, it probably attempts to connect via Bluetooth.  \nIs the Bluetooth driver installed on your computer?\n. *Downloads and installs the beta driver\n. Have you installed the Bluetooth Driver?\nThe video on Dropbox doesn't looks to show \"Initialising Bluetooth host \" in the server log, wich only show when Bluetooth driver is installed and working.\n. Probably related to #51, then.\n. If the modified source code for the dll is provided, maybe @nefarius could see into merging the changes.\n. @n00bC0d3 It depends on your built-in Bluetooth chipset.\nI recommend you to try it by yourself.\nAlthough at first try it may seem to work, problems such as #51 may arise.\n. Try to boot into WinRE and run the clean wipe tool from here.\n. Wow. This issue is well documented.\nI'll add one thing. Is what you want is to convert DirectInput (Generic Controllers) entries to XInput (Xbox 360 Controllers) ones?  \nIn that case, x360ce is what you are searching for.\n. ScpToolkit and relatives were created because the integrated generic controller driver did not output any controls, wether DirectInput or Xinput. Therefore, the PS3 controller is not HID-compliant.\nIt requires a special driver for directly receiving communications from the controller and translating them into, in this case, Xinput entries, that can be understood by the computer.\nAny HID-compliant device will directly output DirectInput entries without any additionnal drivers or configuration. If you want an HID controller to be recognized as a Xbox 360 controller, x360ce was made for that (hence the name: \"Xbox 360 Controller Emulator\")\n. You can:\n- Write your own implementation of ScpServer taking advantages of Scp's Virtual Bus and libusbK driver dedicated to convert DirectInput to Xinput.\n- Create a pull request adding the requested feature and a key mapping tool (I'd personnaly prefer to have a tool to customize all the key instead than only presets, because DirectInput devices vary waaaaaaaaaaay more than Xinput does).\n- Search thorougly on the Internet. I'm pretty sure you're not the only one disliking x360ce and somebody already wrote a driver for it. That's also how Scp was born: someone disliked Motioninjoy and wrote this tool. Only thing is that the driver is probably buried deep within search results.\n- See if @nefarius is willing to implement this feature.\n. Seems you don't even need to quit GitHub to find something:\nhttps://github.com/Stents-/XOutput\n. > a joystick may have up to 8 (Named) axes, up to 128 (numbered) buttons and up to 4 POVs (Either continuous or 5-position).  \nThat's exactly what can make it vary way more. A Xinput device is obligatory a Xbox 360 controller. But if a DirectInput device isn't a normal joystick or wheel defined by Microsoft and send custom entries? Generally, with programs using DirectInput, you can change the key bindings for that reason, while many with Xinput don't allow that, because they are sure you are using a controller with a predefined layout\n. Or start it manually when needed.\nAnyways. Related to #48 \n. In a elevated command prompt, type sc config Ds3Service start= delayed-auto\n. Here is the slow ring Insider still on 10586 :/\n. That is what the Slow Ring is for !\nAltough I sometimes had to resist the urge to switch to Fast because of the new features... like now with build 14316.\n. So, @CoolOppo ? Any news?\n. I don't know. But it's defenitely a driver bug, since some fixed it by downgrading the Xbox 360 controller driver to 2.1.0.1349 (https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/4dmnza/announcing_windows_10_insider_preview_build_14316/d1t4235 and https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/4dmnza/announcing_windows_10_insider_preview_build_14316/d1shjde)\n. Maybe try the same thing\n. You need to have the driver installed before seeing any virtual controller\n. The driver for the PS3 Controller.\nCheck \"PS3 Controller\" on the driver installer and press \"Install\"\n. Yes.\n. Have you checked in the control panel?\n\n. Try unplugging and repluging your controller to see if it will work.  \nIf it won't work then try this:\n- Unplug the PS3 Controller\n- Delete the libusbK driver and remove it from the DriverStore\n- Then plug your PS3 Controller and reinstall the driver\n. No. Not a good idea.\nUse DriverStore Explorer. Find \"libusbK\" in the list, check it and press \"Delete package\"  \nBut before doing that, you'll need to delete the device\nWith the controller unplugged, go in the Devices Manager:\n\nThen show hidden devices:\n\nA category named \"libusbK devices\" should appear. Expand it, and \"PLAYSTATION (R) 3 CONTROLLER\" should appear (or something equivalent). Right-click on it and press \"Uninstall\". Accept the prompt and leave \"Delete driver package\" unchecked. Then proceed with DriverStore Explorer\n. Can I have a screenshot?\n. Yes. Delete them all. Also think to remove the MotionInJoy driver (at the bottom). Can cause some conflicts\n. Now try to unplug and replug the controller.  \nIf it won't work, try to uninstall \"PLAYSTATION (R) 3 Controller\" from the \"HID devices\" section in the Devices Manager (with the controller unplugged and hidden devices shown). This is the stock driver, that ... don't works. When you replug your controller, should recognize libusbK in the DriverStore and install it instead of the stock one.  \nWill be offline for ~15 minutes. Don't expect an answer in this time lapse.\n. The controller is under Human Interface Devices.\nTry reinstalling only the driver with \"Force Driver Installation\" checked\n. I'm out of idea. What do you suggest, @nefarius ?\n. Don't forget to close the issue.\n. Have you tried to scroll?\n. The PID and VID given by your screenshot says you installed the Bluetooth driver on a Xbox 360 Controller.\n. Do the controller works by USB, at least?\n. Maybe also #51 \n. #51 is something completely separated. The services detects the Bluetooth card, but can't handle it correctly, so any wireless communication is totally not working. Happens on the latest stable.\n. @Jan200101 \nSteps to reproduce #51:\n1. Install the Bluetooth driver\n2. Test the Bluetooth -- works\n3. Restart\n4. Test the Bluetooth --not working  \nSo,\n\nIt's definitely an issue with the software as the the Bluetooth card is still picked up by the computer but the software no longer recognizes it appropriately.   \n\n@gergesh I don't know. This issue seems more related to Windows 10 not doing stuff the same as 8 or 7.\n. #48 \nSimply start it from the service manager, or type sc start Ds3Service in a elevated command prompt. You could also make a shortcut to sc start Ds3Service and check \"Run as administrator\"\n\nPS: Best drawing skills ever\n. Probably won't work if RemotePlay takes only PS4 controller, since the libusbK driver does not expose the control outputs. But if it supports Xinput, it will work out of the box.\n. Remote Play for PS3 doesn't support controllers.\n. The thing that may make it work would be using the virtual bus to recreate a normal PS4 controller, and then install the regular Windows driver on it.\n. Same for me... along with C++ :smile: \n. Have you noticed that a clean wipe is needed?\n. Try to remove any Xbox 360 virtual controllers, PS3 controllers and the Virtual Bus from the Devices Manager and the Driver Store. Then retry installation of the drivers\n. Instead of using the Clean Wipe utlilty, I've done it manually. So like that I'm sure nothing was missed and it has less chance breaking my system.\nIf they weren't on the list, it is problably because libUsbK is still installed on them.\n. Removing the settings file didn't worked, neither did unchecking the box.\n. ScpToolkit_Log-Package_Charles_1460480294.zip\n. Maybe that the Certum root CA is not in your certificate store. Can you check?\nAlso, did you approved the dialog box that should show up when installing the VBus? The one that looks like that: \n. Can you try a manual removal and then reinstall?\n. No problems on build 14295:\n\n. I do have Secure Boot enabled on my laptop, and never got this issue.\nSecure Boot only concerns the Windows EFI bootloader, kernel and critical system files.  \nIf you try manually editing your Secure Boot database and reput the correct Microsoft public keys, it may do something. WARNING!!! I am not responsible for any damage done to your system by trying the following advice.\n. @psyke83 Try running this in a admin command prompt: bcdedit /set loadoptions DDISABLE_INTEGRITY_CHECKS\nDDISABLE is not a typo.\nThis should disable driver signature enforcement, and the driver should work with Secure Boot active.\n. I have Windows 10 build 14295 (That needs a reinstall, cause the guy who took care of my computer for problems f*cked it up more than anything else.)\nIf the driver won't work after a reinstall, I'll say it.\n. It's my turn to get hit by the bug:\n\n64-bits Windows 10 build 14366\nplz fix soon @nefarius \n. @nefarius This article might contain the cause of the problem: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/windows_hardware_certification/2016/07/26/driver-signing-changes-in-windows-10-version-1607/\n. Won't that not work, since the driver is still cross-signed?\n. Yeah the new signature requirements only applies to fresh installs since Windows 10 Anniversary Update.\nOlder installs use the old requirements in a effort not to break them because of unsigned drivers.\nYou can use bcdedit /set loadoptions DDISABLE_INTEGRITY_CHECKS to disable that requirement. Then you can probably enable test signing and use universal watermark disabler to remove the watermark.\nDe\u00a0: Alpharou\nEnvoy\u00e9 le\u00a0:4 juin 2017 12:55\n\u00c0\u00a0: nefarius/ScpToolkit\nCc\u00a0: Charles Milette; Comment\nObjet\u00a0:Re: [nefarius/ScpToolkit] Scp Virtual Bus Driver not signed onWindows 10 x64 build 14316 (#266)\nI already tried that just after my first clean install.

I'm an Insider, so I sure know how to live with bugs. :laughing: \n. It generally is a performance problem. Too many things are trying to start at the same time, so it slowdown this service's startup enough for it to get killed by the service controller.\nA SSD or a better CPU could help a lot and fix the issue. If that isn't possible, try removing not used programs from your computer or clean installing.\n. WIndows 7 can't Secure Boot.\n. @psyke83 Why would that be so?\n@acme420 Try running this in a admin command prompt: bcdedit /set loadoptions DDISABLE_INTEGRITY_CHECKS\nDDISABLE is not a typo.\nThis should disable driver signature enforcement, and the driver should work.\n. Try restarting. That command should work only after a restart. It does the same thing as reboot, press F8, and boot without driver signing. It just is permanent.\n. Did your mouse used Bluetooth?\n. #260\n. Take the driver from WinXP and try it on 7, maybe.\n. Normal. They were conceived for that. The Scp Bluetooth driver is generic. Thus, it cannot take in account all existing hardware only like *poof*. Some changes in the code is probably required.\n. Or in admin cmd:\nbcdedit /set loadoptions DDISABLE_INTEGRITY_CHECKS\nDDISABLE is not a typo.\n. That's the best part of it: Nope! Just reboot.\nIt will only work if the solution proposed by @acme420 worked. It is just a permanent way to apply it, instead than having to do his solution at each reboot. So I suggest you try @acme420's solution before, and if it worked, proceed with the command.\nIf not, I can't assist you any furter than: try reinstalling the driver after a manual removal\n. > The link on this github to http://forums.pcsx2.net/Thread-ScpToolkit-XInput-Wrapper-aka-ScpServer-Reloaded has been down for multiple days.\nWe can't do anything about the PCSX2 forums being down. We have to wait.\n\nI think the problem Is I chose all the check boxes for ps3 on this screen:\nimage replacing my keyboard and mouse drivers?\n\nThat's the worst idea ever! This list is built with all the USB devices plugged in your computer. Selecting them all means that all of them will be overwritten with the libUsbK driver (read as: Windows won't know what the f*ck are those devices, and Scp assumes they are all PS3 controllers). But Scp can only understand the PS3 controller input, not your mouse or keyboard's.\nEDIT: If plugging a second keyboard worked, it is because the driver package is written in such a way that it can only be installed on the device you mentionned during setup. So Windows installed the default keyboard driver (or uses the one already installed) for that one.\n. A solution would be to use this guide. Only the part named \"Remove device drivers\" concerns you. You can ignore the other parts if you plan to still use ScpToolkit.\nDon't forget to stop the ScpToolkit standalone server or service before.\nTo stop the service, run sc stop Ds3Service in an elevated command prompt\nTo stop the standalone server, simply close it.\n. Having a driver that you could simply install over the original driver and everything works... That'd be my dream.\nIt would be waaaaay much easier to simply install a driver over the original controller driver instead than having to install a suite of tools, servers, configuration utilities, etc...\nA bit like Android ADB drivers. Install over the original drivers and forget about them. No external dependencies, just a .sys, .inf and .cat file. That you can also delete after.\nI really hope someone has that idea and makes it real one day.\n. A PS3 controller won't connect directly to Bluetooth. A special Bluetooth driver is required. And I don't have enough knowledge to write a driver, either for Bluetooth or the PS3 controller.\n\nAnd I found your HID minidriver concept way more elegant and functional. \n\nSame here\n. On my computer, a WiiMote connected directly to my Bluetooth, without any special drivers (using the Windows default drivers). FYI\n. http://dancingpixelstudios.com/sixaxis-controller/sixaxispairtool/\nSadly, when my Bluetooth radio's MAC is set as host, my SixAxis controller won't show up in the Bluetooth control panel. The controller will search (light flashes) for it's host for ~1 minutes, then shutdown. It won't even pair.\nEven if I use ScpToolkit to do the initial pair (Install the WinUSB Bluetooth driver, pair it via USB, then reinstall the OEM Bluetooth driver)\n. Once you get the USB<->HID driver a bit working, I'd be glad to help testing it.\n. @nefarius Neat!\nWon't the fact of having it using DirectInput make the controller not work in some XInput-only games?\n. Are you sure the ScpToolkit driver is installed? Maybe the Insider build update reinstalled the original one.\n. Try reinstalling DirectX 9 from https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=8109\n. I have 2 SixAxis controllers, and they work fine.\n. Have you tried with a Xbox 360 controller? Because Scp emulates Xbox 360, not Xbox One.\n. JoyToKey can bind controller buttons to keyboard buttons or mouse movements.\n. L1+R1+PS until the 4 LEDs start flashing. Then simply unplug it.\nIf you're using Bluetooth, it'll directly turn the remote off.\n. That behavior is normal. That is why it is recommended to have a dedicated Bluetooth dongle for the controllers.\n. Glad to be of service!\n. If you're using Bluetooth, it may be related to #51 \n. @Artuvazro does it works via cable?\n. Then #51 is your issue\n. See #51 \n. Use the clean wipe tool or do a manual removal.\nThen restart the computer and reinstall ScpToolkit without installing every possible driver.\n. \n. That's maybe because on Windows 10 the PS (or Xbox) button is used for the Xbox game overlay. To restore normal fonctionnality, I think you can disable it in the settings of the overlay itself (Win + G) or via the Xbox app.\n. Maybe you need to have a game with 4 players multiplayer instead than 2 to have it recognize the other controllers. Also notice that XInput support only up to 4 controllers.\nTo make sure the system recognizes the other controllers, you can also list the connected controllers.\nFor example, there is only one controller connected in this computer:\n\n. Seems you left the monitor open.\nOr maybe it could have been the Windows service/the stand-alone server\n. That could be related to issue #51\n. It's working perfectly fine on the Anniversary Update for me.\n. Look at the bright side!\nYou can now shoot at twice the rate you usually do!\n. As mentionned in #266, you have two choices:\n- Disable secure boot\n- Run bcdedit /set loadoptions DDISABLE_INTEGRITY_CHECKS in a admin command prompt. Please note that DDISABLE is not a typo.\n. Is there still people using Windows 3.1? No\nWhy should it not be the same for Windows XP, an abandonned OS?\nBTW, the way driver works has been redesigned in Vista. It might not be possible to port this on Windows XP.\n. How can you compile a Hello World driver with WDK?\n. c#\nfor (int i = 0; i > 248; i++) {\n    closeissue(i);\n}\n. Then why not push a message, and set a timer for in a week that will close the issue if not already done or notify @nefarius if there has been a new comment, but the issue wasn't closed?\n. You just destroyed my hope of seeing a beta FireShock driver.\n. Issue #266 may be the problem\n. That behavior has been fixed in the beta.\nLe mer. 31 ao\u00fbt 2016 00:53, sarf2k4 notifications@github.com a \u00e9crit :\n\nHi, I kind of didn't like to have the scp's auto update checker kept\nrunning every time I start my pc and when there's no internet it would give\nme error.

So checking \"Install DualShock 4\" driver checks everything under the dropdown, and you know what happens then.\n. No.\nYou'll be able to use your DS4 on any port that you want, and you can plug something else where the DS4 was.\nWindows recognizes the controller as the same no matter in what port you plugged it in. And can recognize any device you connected no matter what you plugged in before.\n. It's the one called \"Wireless Controller\"\n. Well then I don't know what device would be the DS4.\nTry running the installer without it plugged in, and compare with when it is plugged in.\nThe DS4 should then be the one that wasn't here.\nDon't forget to clean wipe before.\n. As a workaround, you can turn the sounds off in the toolkit's settings to remove the entry from the volume rocker.\n. Have you ran the driver installer?\nIt's in the start menu, under the folder \"ScpToolkit\"\n. After installing the app, there's a driver installer to run.

I did a search on your bluetooth adapter VID and PID from your logs and I got some generic bluetooth 2.0 adapter here: http://amzn.com/B001EBE1LI.\nI don't think this adapter supports EDR. To connect to a DS3 controller, you need at least Bluetooth 2.0 + EDR. For DS4 I believe you need at least 2.1+EDR but don't quote me on that since I don't have a DS4 yet.\n. What does it show in Device Manager? I had this problem a few versions back when my DS3 kept installing as a libusbK (spelling?) device and not the Xbox 360 Controller device.\n. Try right click properties on that and, under the drivers tab, click the roll back driver button\n. I'll let you know later once I'm back on my laptop. I'm suspecting you need to install the Xbox 360 controller drivers.\n. If you have Windows 7 or earlier, did you try installing the drivers. Afterwards select Update Drivers and change it to the Xbox 360 Controller driver?\nSteps\nUpdate Driver...\nBrowse my computer for driver software\nLet me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer\n. I don't think it's possible with the DS3 because of the way the DS3 works. The DS4 is able to connect to regular bluetooth adapters.\n. ",

Have you restarted ?\nIt might be that the Windows Service didnt start up like it should\n. I dont allow Untrusted Drivers aswell but everything (except the Windows Service) works fine\n. I just installed it ... \nand with the restarting I already know what that is the Service is not starting up like it should #93 \n. I just checked i do not allow untrusted driver and i am now going to install the newest version of SCPToolKit.\nBy the way the language in the Pictures there are German.\n. In the System Category ?\nCant find anything there\n\nBut I found this\n\nBy the way it says in the Services that it is on but when i try stoping it over cmd it says it isnt open\n. Found it \n\n. It didn\u00b4t I looked in the Services and it said it was running (again) but I cannot connect a controller and stoping it over a batch gives the responds \"Service is not running\".\nOh and MS Edge said it could be a Virus here is a report of a Antivirus Scan\nhttps://goo.gl/eFQ3yK\nEDIT The SCPToolKit Tray Notifications Programm is listed as a open Program not as a Background process.

ScpToolkit_Log-Package_Jan_1450536921.zip\n. hm... I guess I will keep using my Workaround\n. I try that\n. Okay it worked i am going to close this then since it isnt needed anymore\n. EDIT: Its rocket league fault on my side\n. did it work for anyone else ?\nBTW @Kladdkaka a Log pack would be nice\n. @Aramatheus  To get the Log pack Search for ScpToolkit Debug Info Collector in your start menu, run it and follow its instructions.\n. or its a faulty usb cable\n. To get the Log pack Search for  ScpToolkit Debug Info Collector  in your start menu, run it and follow its instructions.\n. Question: There is a arrow next to SCPService in your Taskmanager click on it and look if it looks like this\n\n. My last guess would be a Virtual Controller\n. Have you tried the newest solution in #94 ?\n. okay a log would be nice\n. This might not be be SCPServers fault maybe you (or a friend etc.) changed some settings.\nIf nefarius sees this s/he might want to see the Log pack to get the Log pack Search for ScpToolkit Debug Info Collector in your start menu, run it and follow its instructions.\n. Okay i havent read the logs yet (and dont understand all of it yet) but my guess is that you maybe hold the joy stick while unplugging / the driver failed to translate the ps3 controller code to xbox360 controller code and  put it to position 0,0\n. okay lets hope it doesnt happen again\n. So you installed Windows 7 and it stoped working ? hm... have you tried uninstalling and installing every driver ?\n. Well thats a way to do it...\n. okay does it happen after you restart/ are there any errors while installing ?\nA log pack would be nice\n. I wont if it worked.... and thats the wrong log.... so yeah... would be nice if you close the issue\n. after a restart open a command promt and write \"NET HELPMSG 3521\" in it and tell us the results.\nOh and the XBOX360 Controller is only displayed once you connected a PS3 Controller\n. yep go into your services and search for \"SCP DSx Service\" and change the startup option from \n\"Automatically\" to \"Automatically (Delayed Start)\"\nthat should fix it\n. It should it did for me. The Problem is that the Service has some kind of error on startup when starting too early which kills it.\nIt may take some time now until it is started but atleast it should work\nIf it still wont work then I would try making batch for it and start the batch when you want to use your  controller.\n. no problem\n. Thats New. What windows are you using ? It looks odd to me\n. actually there might be some problems getting the Wii U gamepad to work. But you can already use Wii motes\n. actually i had one where you could write the code yourself e.g. wimote.uparrow = W etc.\nEDIT found it is called GlovePie\n. It is dead but still works with everything\n. No and Yes.\nYou can change the sound of it but I dont know if you can hide it yet\n. close please\n. only @nefarius can help you there\n. It may just be that the 2 plugins overwrite each other\n. chech if the service is running \nI would like to help but i am on my Phone right now\n. Wireless controllers wont be picked up my the installer. You have to\nconnect it over cable\nSentry\n. Do you have any virtual controllers (e.g. Vjoy) installed?\n. okay can you make a log with the controller connected over cable?\n. btw is the service on?\n. Okay try disableing the one that is not there\n. its called Xbox 360 Controller for Windows\n. okay win10 is very confusing :I\ni am going to replicate it and find out how to fix\n. The Usb file in you log says that there are 2\n. Her\n1118;654;Controller (XBOX 360 For Windows);USB\\VID_045E&PID_028E&IG_03\\2&9C6DEB5&B&03;USB\\VID_045E&PID_028E&IG_03;HidUsb;Unknown\nand here \n1118;654;Xbox 360 Controller for Windows;USB\\VID_045E&PID_028E\\0000001;USB\\VID_045E&PID_028E&REV_0114;xusb22;Unknown\n. Try these things they work for a lot of people:\n- Check if wire is okay\n- Remove controller emulators like VJoy\n- Reinstall the programm\n. XPadder isnt a Virtual Joystick so its fine it just translates the stuff over to another language.\nOne thing you could try is checking the controller tab and see if it is even seen\n. Quick question does your mouse etc. connect over a bluetooth dongle or its own dongle ? This may explain somethings\n. #224 If have put some things in there if you know how to fix it yourself now close the thread if you dont tell me\n. ehm @promanxsuper are you still there ? When yes then again the link broke because it was on there for too long\n. Uninstall it reinstall it and disable the tray app from autostart\n. Then nothing is wrong everything is okay the error is just there because it isnt marked (like the error says) lets quickly put @nefarius in here so he knows\n. Do you have something like Vjoy installed ? It breaks some games e.g. The Binding of Isaac and others\n. Wait wait wait have you restarted between 8 and 9 ?\n. @Ansem93 do you know if the service is running? \nHere is a quick tool I wrote to check if the service is on. Tell me if it is if it isnt then Ill tell you how to fix.\nSadly GITHUB is weird so I cannot upload it on here so here is a OneDrive Link https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=531AF8D5D12A8FC8!2663&authkey=!ADwvHYhVHwuE1IU&ithint=file%2crar\n. No no no this isnt a fix for that its a tool that just tells you if the Service has problems starting or not\n. no no no no thats one thing you are getting wrong the service isnt starting when  you unplug your controller normaly it starts with your pc and then uses your bluetooth dongle to connect to the controller.\nTHIS CHECKER DOES NOT FIX ANYTHING\nNow to fix this open your services (Search Services in the search bar) and fins DS3Service.\nAfter then right click it then go on properties.\nAfter that set it so Late start.\nTA DA FIXED now restart your pc\n. Okay looks like i made a mistake on some Computers it doesnt show up as the service name so look for SCP DSx Service\n. #224 Download my Service Checker from there and if it says its off do the steps on my last post.\nIf you dont get what i mean reply\n. 1.MotionJoy is not a good program and can harm your system.\n2.scpserver is no the right thing you want it just shows if you controller is working based on what you said it should work correct\n3.Try uninstalling the controller drivers and reinstall them (Uninstall the XBOX controller and reinstall this tool)\n. It can be that your controller is set to the value 0 and that it doesnt update that value sadly I dont know if this glitch can be / has been fixed\n. Im going to explain it with a picture here \n\n. Try giving Issues that just are some ideas a flare in the title like [IDEA] or something like that it makes it easier\n. I think controllers that support both arent supported they should be but the pc trys handling the PS3 mode as PS3 and PS4 ; and the PS4 mode as PS4 and PS3.\nTry using a service that only supports one like DS4Windows\n. It may be added some time please close this Issue\n. Why is everyone saying its the drivers fault for not charging the controller anymore ? It would make sense if it maybe disabled the port but as you said it would charge at all so try getting another charger or try charging it on a console or something like that\n. It works aswell you just have to set up the right USB ports\n. I mean (I dont know if this is still in the new code) if you put the Dongle in the front usb port install it and then switch it will not work.\nThat is because of the way drivers work. Try putting your mouse or keyboard into another USB Port you will see that it reinstalls itself\n. There wont be a fix for this one problem.\nIts a problem with the service not starting right most at the startup on most systems so set it to late start\n. Try running it as a admin and tell if there is another error\n. Its a problem with the service most of the time try running this tool made by me \nDownload\nand in case you wanna be save I put the source code up on pastebin and put it in a antivirus search\nSourcecode\nAntivirus\n. @charlesmilette my tools tries to fix exactly that because its a simple error if the service not starting like it should\n. @charlesmilette \n\nIt's definitely an issue with the software as the the Bluetooth card is still picked up by the computer but the software no longer recognizes it appropriately. \n\nIn the driver installer you have to pick what Bluetooth card / dongle you want to use so its either a faulty bluetooth card or someone who doesnt know how to work with computers\n. @charlesmilette there we go I am back from smashing my head against the table now back to you\nIt is not connecting to the controller because the service (the thing that the dongle needs to connect to the controller) is not starting like it should\n. @charlesmilette good that you now know that it wasnt the guys bluetooth card\n. Remoteplay is like a game it sees your controller and uses it there will be no problems if the guys at sony arent dicks but I dont think they are since the presentation with the PCMR in it\n. It worked back on the PS3 it just had no use because it was just a feature forgotten\n. by the way @mirh it can work on every OS Cough\n. @mirh sadly the PS4 one only supports\n- Windows 8.1\n  -Windows 10 or later\n  -OS X 10.10\n  -OS X 10.11\n@charlesmilette \nIt has no use anyway\n. Its a problem many users have and its easy to fix (if you now a how to get into the deep stuff) but I kept you from that trouble and made this pile of code yay.\nhope it fixes your problem (which it did in most other cases)\nMy Fix\n. Just  noticed my mistake sorry for not responding I forgot my password I am working on a system that tries to check if it running at startup so I am going to make a new one and compile it\n. Yeah we cant really do much if you just give us that info\n. I am remaking everything of the file\n. @Rezulux sorry for no respond but I forgot my password (again) but now I am back.\nYou are saying there is just a readme ? I should never use onedrive again -.- but dont worry I am working on a better bluetooth fix right now that actually checks on startup\n. To fix this set the service to delayed autostart and to restart if it crashed or failed to start sadly we cannot recreate something like that in batch yet to automate the process\nEDIT I finally fixed my programm and added stuff to make it work better\nDropbox\nGoogle Drive\nuse the Fix setting on the choice if the service is started\n. Thats why I always say : Fingers away from a program if you cant save yourself from it\n. Isnt this the wrong place to ask for this ?\n. > when I install the drivers for DS4.\nlook at the website you linked you will find it\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nPlaystation 3\n\nare you srs?\n. First #356 \nSecond #51 \n. really ? really.... \ncant you read ? @subzerocro \n\nScpToolkit slaves the bluetooth adapter\n\nyou reset it to work with something else so I wont work anymore with your Controller\n. Set SCP service to late start as mentioned above and set it to restart if it crashes.\nI can give you a tool if you cant do it yourself\n. SCPToolkit is just translating your DS3 controller to a XBOX controller\n. Makes no sense because the controller is not emulating a keyboard its emulating a XBOX360 Controller so it isnt using WASD\n. please close issues if they are resolved\n. @Markeron find your Bluetooth device in your Device list and uninstall / reinstall its drivers. That should fix the problem.\n. As stated above you can disable it in the taskmanager on windows 10 and in the microsoft settings on windows 7 and below\n. no problem for me and judging on you closing the issue its fixed itself\n. the changes where made to your pc just put the controller into the console over cable to make it work with it again.\n.

    "dreamcat4": "OK\nIt sounds like someone with real PS4 needs to get a packet dump for us, like with some 3rd party listening in. However bluetooth connection is encrypted. So surely you would also need to dump the encryption key which is negotiated during pairing or at beginning of session. And use some method to decrypt the key to use to decrypt the packet log... sounds pretty tough.\nThat is not simple like wireshark where you can just listen direct those communication back-forth.\nSo instead I would suggest maybe attach some hardware probe directly to the BT controller chip on the DS4 pcb... That is not simple either.\nForgive me if I misunderstand. It is just a speculation. Perhaps there is indeed an easier way. Like a debug hardware or some possible debug mode. Or other pre-existing known portable device (e.g. PS Vita or sony bluetooth audio products etc) which may also share similar / known protocol.\n. ",
    "kq01526": "Maybe some more people should ask for it on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/GI_FTW/status/686148538959532032\n:wink:\n. > @nefarius wrote:\n\nit sees an Xbox controller and therefore uses XInput, not DirectInput\n\nThat is plain wrong.\nWhen you connect a DualShock 4 to a Windows PC via USB or pair it via Bluetooth without using any additional driver or wrapper, then the DualShock 4 is being recognized as a DirectInput gamepad.\nThere is an increasing number of games which support the DualShock 4 out of the box (no additional driver or wrapper needed) as a DirectInput device and those games recognize that it is a DualShock 4 and they show PlayStation button prompts instead of Xbox button prompts. Assasin's Creed: Unity is among those games.\nIf you want to read more about it, see the following thread for example:\nhttp://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=935140\nSo, @Tomgroot is perfectly right in saying that he was playing in DirectInput mode when Assasin's Creed: Unity (and the other game) was showing PlayStation button prompts instead of Xbox button prompts.\nWhat he was asking for was if you could add a DirectInput mode to ScpToolkit, which would allow to switch from XInput to DirectInput, to be able to play those game that support it to run with DirectInput and to show PlayStation button prompts. Because using ScpToolkit of course defeats the out of the box DualShock 4 support of those games because using ScpToolkit they see a XInput device instead of a DirectInput device and show Xbox button prompts instead of PlayStation button prompts.\n@Tomgroot :\nWhat is the other game on the second screenshot showing the car?\n. > @nefarius wrote:\n\nWhat has any of this to do with the questions @Tomgroot asked?

If the game would see an XInput device (Xbox controller), then it would not show PlayStation button prompts. But the screenshots clearly show the game using PlayStation button prompts, so it sees a DirectInput device, not a XInput device, so you are wrong.\n. > @nefarius wrote:\n\nMy answer is related to him using the Scp drivers. Why would I wanna comment on the DS4s native mode?\n\nBecause he (and me) is asking you for a way to use the native mode without having to uninstall ScpToolkit.\n. > @nefarius wrote:\n\njust for those DS4-aware games\n\nIt still would be well worth it, since having PlayStation button prompts is a big plus.\nWell, besides, DS4Windows also has integrated an option to switch to DirectInput, see the \"Use DInput only\" checkbox in the lower right corner of the following screenshot:\nhttp://ds4windows.com/images/p1.png\nHowever, with DS4Windows, this option currently only works for wired USB and not for wireless Bluetooth unfortunately, see:\nhttps://github.com/Jays2Kings/DS4Windows/issues/48\n. @nefarius :\nWhat @My1 is saying is another good point. ScpToolkit has the ability to configure the DS4 lightbar and buttons and so on. If you have to uninstall ScpToolkit to switch to the DS4's native DirectInput mode, you lose all this configurability.\nAdding an option to ScpToolkit to switch from the emulated Xbox controller XInput mode to the native  DS4 Direct Input mode would solve all of this. It would give you the configurability and at the same time would allow to play games which support it to run with the native DS4 Direct Input mode and to see PlayStation button prompts instead of Xbox button prompts (which is a huge plus).\n. > @nefarius wrote:\n\nany plans from DS4Windows in that direction?\n\nI've already answered that question half an hour ago, see:\n\n@kq01526 wrote in https://github.com/nefarius/ScpToolkit/issues/89#issuecomment-170268284 :\nDS4Windows also has integrated an option to switch to DirectInput, see the \"Use DInput only\" checkbox in the lower right corner of the following screenshot:\nhttp://ds4windows.com/images/p1.png\nHowever, with DS4Windows, this option currently only works for wired USB and not for wireless Bluetooth unfortunately, see:\nhttps://github.com/Jays2Kings/DS4Windows/issues/48\n\n:stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:\n. > @My1 wrote:\n\n[...] without meddling otherwise [...]\n\nJust to clarify: When he/she says \"without meddling otherwise\" he/she means \"without emulating a Xbox XInput controller\".\n. Thanks, but that doesn't really explain the difference.\nI was aware that DS4Windows only works for the DS4, not for the DS3 (hence it's name).\nWhat I really wanted to know is how they differ feature wise.\nAssuming you only have a DS4 and no DS3, is there anything about ScpToolkit that would make you use it over DS4Windows or vice versa?\nOr in other words:\nWhich one is better? ScpToolkit or DS4Windows?\n. Thanks. InputMapper is not open source, so it's not an option.\nDoes ScpToolkit allow to use the DS4 touchpad as a mouse?\nAnd does ScpToolkit allow to control the DS4 lightbar?\nDS4Windows allows to do that.

After that, I ran the installation and initialization setup again and my controller once again worked. Mind, this is with the 1.7Beta drivers, but it's worth a shot, right? \n. Oh probably. But that kind of defeats the point of software progressing. Hence my report here so Nefarius knows and can perhaps fix it.\n. The main thing that bothers me about this bug is that I can't tell you what causes it to help you reproduce, and subsequently fix it. Sorry : (\n. I've re-tried your drivers every once in a while after updates to see if things changed, Nefarius. Unfortunately, they haven't. So I decided today that I wanted to see if Scarlet.Crush' old drivers worked, and they do (without my dongle, because it isn't supported by those drivers). So there's something in those and in ScpServer_v1.5.5724.38523 that works, but fails in later versions. Maybe that'll help you fix this bug. If you have time to work on the project at all that is. Regardless, thanks.\n. I have a genuine PS3 controller that apparently contains a bluetooth chip that your program flags as a fake. Beyond that, the issues immediately pop up. Is there a way for me to log what's happening under the hood? Not just the regular and glitchy input, I mean. Like what's being executed when the glitches occur. \nEdit: I'm indeed an idiot. I found the releases button. I'll test that version and get back to you whether the issues pop up in  that one too.\n. Ah yeah, sorry. Forgot to mention the link didn't work for some reason and gave me nonsense. I've downloaded v1.5.5787.40106 to give that a spin and I'll work my way back, see which version stops giving me issues first.\nedit: hate it when I click the wrong damn buttons ^^;\n. 08:A9:5A:8E:B3:0F\n. I've run some trials with two versions of yours of the Scp Toolkit, v1.5.5787.40106 and v1.5.5724.38523. Both did fine with Rocket League, causing no issues. But once I tried Helldivers, an issue popped up where using the the left control stick button to run, the input would also recognize Up on the D-pad, plus issues with the accuracy of the right stick. This persisted when I installed Scarlet.Crush' old drivers. So I'm beginning to suspect it's not something you've done. Just something that got enhanced with something you did going from v1.5 to v1.6\nMind you, Rocket League for example still works swimmingly. Helldivers is just apparently good at showing the issues. \nAlso, did you have another way for me to log what's happening under the hood?\n. The issues I experienced I described in the very first post. For the sake of testing, I decided to try with the latest 1.7etc beta drivers and adding 08:A9:5A to the list of genuine controllers, and the wired issues were resolved. The remaining issues now are the ones I first initially only experienced with wireless bluetooth connection (and which I also experienced with Scarlet.Crush's version of the wrapper); sticky camera controls in Assassins Creed Syndicate (though less so), and the left stick clicking down also registering D-pad input somehow (generally left or up) and sometimes Square/X in Helldivers. Both on wired and wireless connection.\nNow of course this is stating the obvious, but somewhere, the input coming from the PS3 controller is somehow not being translated right. Since I am no programmer (game designer, actually), I have no idea what code I would even need to dive into to help. And I'm sorry about that. : (\n. ##Possible Fix## \nwith latest 1.7beta drivers\nFirst I installed all the controller drivers and such as per normal (I have a DS3 and DS4)\nAfter that, I did a clean wipe with the clean wipe utility so the bluetooth dongle would be available again. \nThen I paired the DS4 with my PC through the normal bluetooth utility in windows (so before you claim the dongle with Scp Server) by holding the PS and share buttons until the light bar starts blinking quickly twice before going dark.\nAnd finally, I went through the driver install utility all over again, installing everything (as you did do the clean wipe)\nThere may be a possible shortcut by simply removing everything scp server related, followed by pairing the controller to the PC like a normal bluetooth device, then installing the Scp server, initializing the controller(s) and the dongle, and everything else. But considering my DS4 works again after several hours of mucking about, I'm sure you'll forgive me for not being so eager to try this out. Or trying it out with the latest 1.6 drivers. \nHope this helps anyone else!\n. I'm having the same problem now... Bluetooth won't work at all. I get a code 10 on whatever Bluetooth device (dongle or built-in card) after installing drivers. I had a hell of a time getting the normal driver reinstalled and functioning afterwards. For the record, I originally installed in November and it worked fine until late February. One of the updates broke my setup.\n. this sounds very much like my issue. https://github.com/nefarius/ScpToolkit/issues/179 So far what I suspect may have fixed it for me is adding the first bit of my mac address of my genuine controller to the scpcontrol.ini file. That's the gist of it anyway. You can read the rest of the details in that post. Regardless, ever since I have not had this particular issue with the left stick.\n. Anything?\n. @ItalisLoL can you try older version of SCPserver?\nThat version is stable and it can be used for longer time like a year, but it did not work for me at this time. i don't know why :(\nhttp://forums.pcsx2.net/Thread-XInput-Wrapper-for-DS3-and-Play-com-USB-Dual-DS2-Controller\n. Well the latest version of ScpToolkit is working perfectly\n. Excuse me. That's how I said when it works for over a year and not having issue anymore. I only use PS3 controller connected with cable and that's it. I can say it works fine (not perfectly) but not for all.\n. UPDATE! I found the Gamepad Analyzer in the latest beta and analyzed my ps3 controller through Mayflash 3003.\nMayflash PS3 Game Controller Adapter_hid-report.dump.txt\nI did this for controller nr1 but there are up to 4 controllers.\nThe only difference is the col value:\nvid_0079&pid_1801&col01\nvid_0079&pid_1801&col02\nvid_0079&pid_1801&col03\nvid_0079&pid_1801&col04\n. I had the same problem but i found out that i forgot to select my controller in the list. I selected PS3 controller and it worked!\nHave you selected your controller in Driver Installer?\n\n. Same thing for me in Windows 10x64. It was working fine for me until I did a clean install of Windows 10. The virtual bus driver appears unsigned to Windows. Not sure how to fix it. I got the driver to successfully install by disabling driver signature checking, but it chokes on reboot.. Looks like my issue is isolated to the latest beta version.

I got the same problem with trying to install ScpToolkit v1.7.277.16103-BETA on Windows 7 SP1 x64 Home Edition.\nCan we please get this fixed?\n. Same here. The only workaround which worked for me was to boot with drivers checking deactivated (advanced reboot).

In Parallels virtual machine Configuration open Hardware -> USB & Bluetooth -> untick Bluetooth Devices.\n2.  Restart your Windows.\n3. Reset your controller with the button on the back. Then, connect your controller via cable. Check if it is detected as Controller in the SCP Monitor (buttons reacting?)\n4. Detatch the cable of the controller. It should automatically connect via bluetooth. For further instructions, i used the help on the parallels website.\nOne thing I have to notice - after installing the bluetooth driver of SCPToolkit, i don't have any Bluetooth menu in windows anymore, but it will still connect to your Controller.\n1. To connect 2 controller. Do the following:\n2. wire connect Controller 1\n3. Detatch the cable. It should be connected with bluetooth now.\n4. Wire connect Controller 2. At this point, both Controller stop working.\n5. Detatch the cable of Controller 2 and wire connect Controller 1. Now both should start working at the same time, one with cable and one with bluetooth. If you detach the wire, both will stop working.\n. ",

Never mind, found the cause of the issue and the fix :)\n. @nefarius - Disable 'Vibration' in-game, that's all it was.\nI read a lot of posts of people having issue with the vibrate/rumble in some games, so I disabled vibration in the in-game menu and Bingo, no more issues, re-enable vibration and instant CTD. I got to speaking with someone afterwards, he said he'd discovered the current Scp driver has an issue with vibration in GTA and some other games causing it to freeze all input while vibrating, or completely crash the driver causing game crashes and even BSOD, which effected me multiple times.\nHope this helps\n. [Update] -- Ok this is weird! This issue happens every time and all the time when playing GTA V, but it doesn't happen when playing some other games. It's like the driver has issues with only GTA V :confused: \nAlso regarding GTA 5, it works in the menus, it works in-game (except the top bumper buttons that have the issue), but it won't allow me to Calibrate the controller in the menu, it doesn't recognise it's there. :confused: \n.

It's supposed to be true BT 4.0.\n. I don't know why people is still commenting about this, this is already solved people.\nV2.0 is insufficient for 6-axis wireless (it requires at least V2.1). There's a more than one dongle that match the VID 0A12 and PID 0001, we already know the ones that are not compatible. Please read before posting nonsense or at least report the REV number of your dongle if it doesn't work.\nTL;DR If your triggers don't work, your dongle is not compatible, get a different one.\n. AFAIK it is associated to certain bluetooth adapters. On earlier SCP versions it didn't work at all, now everything but the Z-Axis works.\n. The profiler also works correctly in my case (I opened a github issue a while ago, you can check it). Probably the profiler works when mapped as buttons, but the BT adapter can't work a Z-Axis.\n. ",

Perhaps I don't know what to look for. Is there a feature in ScpServer that can be activated to save BT packets to disk?

I know formatting windows is a pain.\nI hope somebody can tell me, how to make fake DS3 have rumble via bluetooth.\n. @aking4125 I don't know what are you doing to ur poor pc haha\nThe only person who knows why SCP Toolkit won't work with bluetooth is @nefarius. \n. Do you think we should try Better DS3?\n. @nefarius I would like to make a personal request to you. Hope to get a favorable reply. \nCurrently I'm using fake controllers with SCP-DS-Driver-Package-1.2.2.175. When using USB, vibrations work, but when using bluetooth vibrations don't work. Please help to get vibrations to work via bluetooth. It will benefit  many, me included, who got deceived by sellers who sold these fake controllers as the authentic ones. I know you can do it and hope you will help us. \n. @aking4125 The most cost effective option for you is to buy another bluetooth dongle. After going so much hassle with ps3 controllers, next time im buying an xbox360 controller. hope they are legit as they claim to be. sometimes i think those third party gamepads that can emulate x360 profile out of the box are much more hassle free. \n. Whats the difference between the toolkit version and the old SCP 122 version, apart from supporting fake controllers.\n. @aking4125 You should try third party controllers, they can interchange between ps3 controller profile and x360 controller profile with just a press of a button. BUT they only last for a week. haha. I dun mind using them, if they were longer lasting and had rechargeable batteries.\n. @aking4125 How can I be communicating with you if I don't read your posts.\nYes, I know, we're using fake controllers, me included, (i got deceived by seller that these controllers are legit, until I used toolkit). I know fake controllers work with bluetooth using 1.2.2 but not with toolkit. I mean other differences. In the toolkit, I noticed that we can assign battery status in the 4 leds instead of showing player 1. When I mean 3rd party controllers, i mean those that don't even look like ps3 controllers. Those that have turbo and / or auto fire functions sometimes. \n. Anybody knows how to have rumble support on fake controllers using SCP-DS-Driver-Package-1.2.2.175? Any help will be appreciated.\n. @aries-soft Can you confirm if the controller would work with vibration over bluetooth?\n. yup, tried it last nite, still no vibration. is there any additional drivers for the vibration?\nThe vibration works while the controller is connected via usb. only during bluetooth, there is no vibration. if only somebody could copy the usb driver to the bluetooth mode. im not a programmer, so i cant do this. relying on you guys for this.\nIts not that some pple buy fake controllers on purpose. some sellers decieve us by selling fake controllers as legit ones. its totally not my fault for getting a fake controllers and im sure, im not the only 1 with the same situation. \n. ok. that gives me more variables for me to experiment on. will let you guys know, if i ever try it.\n. is there any app that tests the vibration on the controllers? it doesn't have the test vibration option in the 'game controllers' by windows. Currently, im am opening up a game and testing it there.\n. ",
    "aking4125": "I can confirm the fake controllers working with \"SCP-DS-Driver-Package-1.2.2.175\" via bluetooth flawlessly. I don't understand they don't work in this new toolkit thing. Both works with USB though.\n. @luzair Nope. But I don't really care. So long as it works. Though now out of nowhere, 1 of the controllers is not being detected and it refuses to install the controller drivers. Then I BSOD'd. This is getting crazy.\n. The vibration works perfectly fine otherwise. My controllers is fine as they work via USB and on a PS3 and PS4.\nWhat I'm trying to say, The SCP-DS-Driver-Package-1.2.2.175 was the only way to get them to work via Bluetooth. This SCP Toolkit, doesn't work with bluetooth. Both works with USBs. So since the other one worked. I used that and everything was fine until I restarted my PC. It didn't restart properly, it BSOD'd with the SCPVBUS error or something. Restart. Now the old software refuses to install the controller drivers. I cannot gain access to my system32 folder to manually copy them anymore. Even in safe mode.\nTrying the toolkit again and it looks like I have to reinstall Windows. I don't understand how the SCP-DS-Driver-Package-1.2.2.175 worked with bluetooth while the new one doesn't. Something is off here. \nAs for the BSoD. It's probably my fault for installing, and uninstalling all different kinds of drivers everywhere.\nAnd do not use MotioninJoy. It's a virus waiting to happen. Heck, I did try it. It works with USB but again, not bluetooth. Better DS3 didn't fair any different. I don't understand what's going on.\n. None of that worked. It can't seem to gain access to the system32 folder. I found a way for me to do it. Now the SCP-DS-Driver-Package-1.2.2.175 doesn't work with USB. BUT! Bluetooth works flawlessly again! Thank god. That's all I wanted was the controllers to function. Vibration doesn't work like this but it's not the end of the world for me. \nNow, SCP Toolkit, won't work with Bluetooth. Period. I don't understand why though.\n. I know what I'm doing (Mostly) as I manged to get it to work. Now my family can play Viscera Clean-Up Detail wirelessly with our PS3 controllers\nBetter DS3 requires the normal DS3 tool drivers, which means you need MotioninJoy. Don't use it. For now, if users want bluetooth on some crap 3rd party PS3 controllers. If SCP ToolKit doesn't work, use the old SCP-DS-Driver-Package-1.2.2.175 for that. Otherwise just use SCP Toolkit. \nI think it'd may be best to just get Xbox 360 controllers or Playstation 4 controllers. Even though they are much more expensive than the cheap PS3 controllers (I got the four I'm using for $9 each). Because with those, especially the PS4 controller. They just work without having a 3rd party Bluetooth driver. And DS4 is easier to use. Too bad that doesn't work with PS3 controllers.\nI bid @nefarius luck with whatever the issue is. Cause in SCP-DS-Driver-Package-1.2.2.175 Bluetooth works, just no vibration which I don't mind at all.\n. @angelflames1337 You installed it incorrectly. You have to load the 1.2.0 files first. then the 1.2.2 files and replace everything. That's because the 1.2.2 is just an update. The core files is within' the 1.2.0 archive.\nThis doesn't explain however why the Toolkit doesn't work in Bluetooth mode. But the old 1.2.2 one does.\n. This isn't the thread or place to be talking about this. Perhaps another time via a PM or something.\n. @nefarius Yes that makes sense. Well, until you do. Users such as myself cannot use SCP Toolkit for Bluetooth with some PS3 controllers. I tried a genuine Sony PS3 controller from a friends PS3. That still didn't work via Bluetooth with the Toolkit. The 1.2.2 older drivers does for some reason.\n@luzair The old SCP 1.2.2 drivers is not under nefarlus at all. That one is no longer supported. So you are stuck without Vibration via Bluetooth. I honestly don't even think that's an issue. So long as the controllers work then just leave it be. But until nefarlus can figure out the issue with the Bluetooth in the current SCP Toolkit. There is nothing can really be done. As seeing how our issue seems to be very specific. It may never happen. \nI'm just going to save up what little money I have and get 3 more legit PS4 controllers and use DS4. I do want to use my Bluetooth adapter for other stuff and with the PS3 controllers I can't really do that which for now it isn't an issue to me. Or I should just buy another Bluetooth adapter for everything else.\n. Yeah. But I do play PS2 and PS1 games and playing them with an Xbox 360 controller is annoying you know? \nBesides, the Xbox controllers usually require batteries and a rechargeable pack is just extra money. I'll eventually get them all. And I will get another Bluetooth dongle. I'm aware. I'm still gonna get 3 more PS4 controllers though cause this was more hassle than it needed be xD\n. @angelflames1337 If even the old SCP 1.2.2 doesn't work for you in Bluetooth. Either make sure the Bluetooth Drivers and DS3 drivers are properly installed or you're Bluetooth Dongle is not supported.\nIf the installation reads it cannot write the files to the system32 folder. You need extra permissions to get that working. You need to select the .exe. Make sure to run it as an Admin. And then, go to the special Permissions and allow your current Admin account Effective access. That's what I had to do. After that, the SCP Service will take over and that worked for me.\nJust wished it worked with the toolkit from the get go but oh well.\n. @luzair If you read my first post (Or any of them). I am using 3rd party Controllers. The \"Fake\" controllers (The ones that just says \"P3\" on the home button). The Difference with the Toolkit and 1.2.2 is that the the Toolkit doesn't work for me via Bluetooth and the 1.2.2 one does as stated multiple times above. \nIf you mean, real difference. Toolkit is easier to install, works with PS4 controllers, has profile settings on it's own. More options and is more sleeker.\n. @VarunBurde I have not. Will give it a shot when I'm free from IRL stuff. Will report back within' 24Hr\n. ",

A reboot won't fix an unsigned driver issue however - he can reboot a dozen times, and this still won't work.\nIf you have a different solution, please post it. If you know how you got yours to work, let us know as well.\n. I tried to look at your issue as well, but it is in a foreign language, and I can not read it. Since it is a picture, I can't even google translate it. It does not seem to be helpful to this issue, so I did not bother manually typing it in to google translate - and this would not have helped me in debugging your issue anyways since google translations are not 100% accurate.\nYour response of \"I just installed it ...\" is not detailed enough to aid me in trying to fix this issue. How certain are you that you do not allow untrusted drivers? Can you check to see?\n. Yes, I recognized the word Das from the movie Das Boot. I recognized enough of the words to guess it was german, but I don't understand german enough to even guess at your problem.\nIt looks like nefarius is handling your issue, so it is better that I don't do a thing there.\nWhen I googled the specific error number that was received by Narkah, and the web page most useful appears to be: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd441378%28office.13%29.aspx . It really still looks like a trust issue, and the second interesting link appears to be http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23812471/installing-appx-without-trusted-certificate . However, these are merely my guesses and googles, and we can only wait and see if anything helped Narkah.\n. The debug log is filled with the exact same errors - trying to install unsigned drivers.\nhttps://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff710454%28v=ws.10%29.aspx\nAre you sure you are allowing unsigned driver installation?\nSince you use windows 7, I have found info on how windows 7 users need to allow unsigned drivers:\nhttp://superuser.com/questions/124112/use-an-unsigned-driver-in-windows-7-x64\nhttp://ccm.net/faq/3914-windows-7-how-to-install-unsigned-drivers\nand if you are willing to read Microsoft's own web pages about this:\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn653569%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\nBut I can't understand what they are saying myself. Too hard to read.\nDid you use the bcdedit to change your boot configuration?\n. So... Did it work?\n. Did you try updating/installing the driver using the device manager?\nOn http://forums.pcsx2.net/Thread-XInput-Wrapper-for-DS3-and-Play-com-USB-Dual-DS2-Controller?page=146 in the first post, it looks like that's how Morphean got his to work.\n. Ah, I had missed you mentioning it is an afterglow ps3 controller. I don't know if that makes a difference or not. The errors I kept reading are trust errors. In other words, the drivers never even got successfully installed, and thus never get a chance to try to work. I do not know how to get past this issue since you have already told your computer to get past this issue... and it is seemingly ignoring your orders... for your own protection of course.\n. ",

    "mikegonzalez2k": "This has to be a Windows driver communication issue.  I have a DS3 controller from my PS3 that works perfectly still.  I tried it on my Android phone, and tablet in emulators and it NEVER does the random movement.  However when I run it ni Windows 8.1 with SCPToolkit it does random sporatic movement until I have to unplug it.  It's not calibration because that would mean it would always do this.  The fact that the controller is working perfectly one moment and the next tells me it is somehow a corruption during initialization.  Some event trigger is corrupting the data sent to Windows and Windows is receiving bad inputs from the software translation side.. The problem seems to be with a change made after ScpServer v1.5.5724.38523.\nThe bug does exist in versions prior to this according to this thread.\nhttps://github.com/nefarius/ScpToolkit/issues/165. This solution definitely fixed the issue with my DS3 controller randonly pulling left as well.\nNefarius, could you please add that Genuine MAC address to the ini in future versions of SCPToolkit so others won't have this problem?. Open the Application: SCP Toolkit Settings Manager\nUnder Global Settings there is a checkbox to DISABLE RUMBLE.. I just chatted with Nefarious online.  He is actually in the process of releasing a new application to fix many of these kinds of issues.  The DS3 random button press issue is a problem with the driver initialization every so many seconds.  It cycles and randomly triggers.  He's well aware of the issue as it's been plaguing SCP since version 1.6 back in 2015.  Anyhow he fixed it in a new release.  But that isn't out yet.  Keep an eye on his github, hopefully it will hit soon.. Is the Tray app at all required for SCP to run properly though?  Does it do any sort of reinitialization of the app or maintain it's connectivity?. Not sure what the MAC Address of the device is since I've never used it on my PC via bluetooth.  I always have connected via a mini USB charging cable to a USB port.  I can try to look at my DS3's MAC and see if it has the same address as the one you describe causes that problem.. Well this old PS3 controller seems to not hold charge any longer.  Can't use it unless plugged in.. It looks like my DS3 is one of the ones with the MAC mentioned above.  I added that line to the ini, then restarted my PC just to make sure the drivers loaded properly.  So far so good, it's been 10 minutes and no issues yet.  Nefarious may want to add that MAC to future versions of the ini so other users don't get this same issue.  I'll let him know on Twitter.. Well after letting it run for about 25 minute the problem came back :(. ",

Box or something for that sort of thing? I'd consider sending you mine after I find someone who can confirm it works.

    "candycinema": "@nefarius , this is an awesome build. The setup is very user-friendly. I'm trying to connect a wide variety of controllers at once to my PC, and it's been a long, frustrating quest with one problem after another. I use an XB1 controller wirelessly as my main controller, but having friends over, I use 2 DS3s and probably a DS4 and an Xbox 360 controller. As you can guess, it's tough to get all that working.\nThis version of SCPToolkit was an easy install and it helps with connecting and disconnecting virtual Xbox360 controllers to rearrange player order. However, I think the clean wipe utility deleted the SCPToolkit Bluetooth Pairing Utility and didn't replace it. In the \"official\" version of SCP, my controllers connected to the dongle super easily. Now, only the DS4 will, and it still won't work through this new SCPTookit.\n1) Is this build focused on getting things to work without the bluetooth pair utility? I noticed that it is deselected in the features install. Is there a reason for that? Is it just too risky to try, or is it known to not function with this build? In the new SCPToolkit Driver Installer, my bluetooth dongle does not appear.\n2) How can I roll back to the previous SCP I was using to troubleshoot between this build and the official download? Or maybe re-install this toolkit with the Bluetooth pairing checked off? It's worth noting that I don't have a dongle from the list of known successful dongles.\n3) Is this build meant to ignore SCPMonitor? That application can only set DS3/4 controllers to player slots above them, but since it doesn't include attached Xbox controllers, it doesn't seem to be a good tool for anyone who uses both kinds.\n. I've ensured that my bluetooth dongle has the right driver. I know pairing is supposed to be done in SCP Driver Installer, and it used to (like magic) with the legacy build, which is why I wanted to troubleshoot it. Is this failure of the bluetooth pairing worth reporting as a new bug/issue? I don't want to fill an old thread with new problems.\n. ",

I tried disabling it and reenabling and nothing seems to happen with it. with no effect.\nI also attempted to disable it and the XInput Tester from ScpMonitor.exe seemed to still register button pressions.\n. The rollback button is disabled unfortunately, not something I can do.\nWhat version of the driver do you have? Here's what the driver information says for me:\nDriver Provider: libusbK\nDriver Date: 8/28/2015\nDriver Version: 3.0.5.16\nDigital Signer: Not digitally signed\n. Thank you Dorque, it appears that fixed the issue. <:\nHere's a summary of the solution if anyone needs it in the future.\nPROBLEM SUMMARY:\nAfter installing SCPToolkit everything appears to work correctly. When you connect your PS3 Controller through wired or wireless means you get a proper connection reported by ScpTrayApp.exe or ScpMonitor.exe. Your controller also will appear to work if you run ScpMonitor.exe and select \"XInput Tester\".\nThe real problem seems to be with Xbox Controller emulation, resulting in the controller not appear in the Windows Game Controllers panel.\nSOLUTION SUMMARY:\nYou may have an outdated / broken controller emulator installed from a previously used software version.\n- Disconnect your controller\n- Open Device Manager\n- Go to the libusbK category and expand it.\n- Right click on \"Xbox 360 Controller\" in the category and select \"Update Driver Software...\"\n- Select \"Browse my computer for driver software\"\n- Tell it to search for driver software in the location of your ScpToolkit folder (C:\\Program Files\\Nefarius Software Solutions\\ by default)\n- Ensure that \"Include subfolders\" is enabled and click next.\n- Attempt to connect your controller again and ensure that it shows up in the Game Controller panel and you're done!\n. I'm not exactly sure. During the install process when asked I chose the only USB Input Device that existed in the DS3 drop down. There was nothing that looked like a more suitable name in the whole list and I'm not sure how to get the VID.\n. I'm assuming you mean when going through the ScpToolkit install process it says to select a DS3 device. I looked through the list of devices in that list and none of them said anything Playstation related so I assumed it was just the USB Input Device.\nAlso you say that like like I'm trying to pull one over on the Scp team by slipping by a non standard controller or something. ScpToolkit is supposed to work with a bunch of different controllers how would I benefit from saying I have on when I don't. It just didn't show in the list if that's what it's supposed to display as.\nAlso I should have totally gone through a list of hundreds of devices looking for a VID number that I didn't know exist to magically fix my problem that I had to submit an issue report to get help with, I have no idea why I would even want to see a VID number and what it would help with.\n.

The only downside is, having been such a wide open fix, I'm not sure which folder probably should have been focused on to sort this out, as I'm pretty sure certain folders are supposed to be Read Only in Sys32. \n.

Windows 7x64 and Windows 10x64. Issue occurs both wired and over bluetooth (one is a Toshiba laptop w/bt the other an ASUS mini bt400 device). Often while playing MGS5 pressing the Left Stick in to sprint results in dpad direction hits. \nI can simply shake my older controller and it will count as button inputs.

    "theczorn": "What fake controller are you using? Make/Model/Serial #?\n. This is expected behaviour. The SCP toolkit will pick a Bluetooth radio to override and sync DS3/DS4 controllers to. From the original forum post by ScarletCrush:\n\nNote : The Bluetooth Driver requires that you dedicate a Bluetooth Dongle to DS3/DS4 use. It will not  be usable by other Bluetooth devices after the driver has been installed.\n\nIf you're overriding your main Bluetooth radio you could try to get a supported Bluetooth USB dongle and overwrite that with SCP instead. The DS3/DS4 controllers would then use SCP to sync to your USB dongle, while everything else would go to the main radio.\nI can't say if having two Bluetooth radios on at the same time would interfere with one another though. My current is setup this way (Logitech Unifying Receiver for Mouse/Keyboard and Kinivo BTD-400 for SCP) so YMMV.\n. When you say \"no other input will work\" do you mean:\na.) Only the DS3 joysticks receive input. None of the other controller buttons work.\nOR\nb.) The DS3 controller works with bluetooth, but all other bluetooth devices (mice, keyboards, etc) become unresponsive.\nIs this only occurring when using a USB connector, using bluetooth, or for both?\n. What device(s) are you installing the Bluetooth drivers on in the Driver Installer? IIRC it's possible to target a USB Hub and overwrite all your dongles at once when you intend to target a specific USB dongle.\n. - Have you tried updating your Bluetooth drivers?\n- What model controllers are you trying to sync?\n- What OS version?\nThis appears to be a generic Bluetooth error message in regards to pairing, more details would be helpful.\n.

After you get it connected you can uncheck the option. \n. ",

My Dualshock 3 works fine. My Dualshock 4 portrays this issue as well. But when playing Dark Souls III with BP mode, my controller input gets all messed up..

I share a Bluetooth adapter with two computers and it wasn't plugged into the second one when it got the latest Insider Preview build.\n. For me, if I connect my DS3 controller to my AMD laptop, the performance deteriorates as CoolOppo mentions.  On my desktop, Fallout 4 (a game it can normally play quite well) starts to drop in FPS quite severely, but can be temporarily fixed by killing the dwm.exe process (I run it in borderless windowed mode).  Maybe there could be a GPU resource leak in the status app or something?\n. I just installed the 14328 build after updating to the latest ScpToolkit driver, and on my desktop so far so good, no performance deteriorations on my Core i7 desktop.\nAppears the bug is now fixed.\n. Update:  Been playing Fallout 4 for a half hour, looks like all is good, after 3 bad builds of Windows failed me.\n. If you have an earlier licensed version of Windows install that then upgrade to 10.  This will put your OS in a \"grandfathered\" status authorized to load the driver.\nAs another mitigation if you can disable Secure Boot in the BIOS this will also ease the restrictions.  Just make sure if you use Bitlocker with a TPM chip that you pause protection before changing any BIOS settings or you will be forced to enter your recovery key.. ",

    "Volkanite": "@herberto97. I have the same issue with the latest driver installer. The controller must be present in Device Manager under Human Interface Devices. If not, the installer won't see it, as it only enumerates devices under that node by calling SetupDiEnumDeviceInterfaces(GUID_DEVINTERFACE_HID);\nI don't know if this is how previous versions of the Driver Installer did it but i think the current version should be fixed to enumerate ALL USB devices, not just those HID compliant devices.\nAnyways the workaround for this issue would be to get your controller back under Human Interface Devices. This can be done by manually uninstalling the current driver in Device Manager.\n. @herberto97 Follow the steps below in order to revert to controller to an HID compliant device.\n- Right click device\n- Update Driver Software\n- Browse my computer for driver software\n- Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer\n- USB Input Device\n- Click OK\n. @herberto97 Okay but did my instructions work to get the controller back under Human Interface Devices? The Bluetooth can be fixed as well. The Driver Installer calls SetupDiEnumDeviceInterfaces(GUID_BTHPORT_DEVICE_INTERFACE); which means the device has to present under Bluetooth Radios in Device Manger when you run the installer. This can again be done by reverting to the default Bluetooth driver.\n. @herberto97 Follow the steps below in order to revert to the default bluetooth driver.\n- Right click the bluetooth device\n- Update Driver Software\n- Browse my computer for driver software\n- Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer\n- Generic Bluetooth Adapter\n- Click OK\n. That should do it. So the Bluetooth adapter now shows up in ScpToolkit Driver Installer?\n. @herberto97  Can you run this small piece of code and tell me what the output is?\nhttps://github.com/Volkanite/bluetoothsearch/releases/download/r1/bluetoothSearch.r1.zip\nRun it from command prompt.\n.

    "j0shg": "Hi nefarius,\nNot sure if you have had a chance to look into this PANHAI issue as of late or if you have very specific things already in mind that would fix this problem.  I know that you said you have it on the table but my curiosity always gets the best of me so I tried to take a little look :)\nFirst I have tried 3 different kind of gamepads with varying degrees of success.\nThe first is this one from Slickblue:  http://www.amazon.com/Slickblue-Bluetooth-Controller-Playstation-Black-Orange/dp/B00GNX4ZC2\nThis one works perfectly with the drivers with both wired and bluetooth.  Everything works exactly like it should.  The only problem is, the buttons on this gamepad are TERRIBLE.  You can push and tap the buttons over and over and the only way they will register a button click is if you press exactly in the center very firmly.  It doesn't sound like a big deal but it is actually VERY distracting and impossible for me to get used to after growing up playing console games (Nintendo, Sega Genesis, etc :) ).  So I wanted to try others to see...\nThe second I tried is called FiveStar: http://www.amazon.com/FiveStar-Controller-Wireless-Gamepad-Playstation3/dp/B016XF0Y4M\nAnd the third I tried is called GAME-O:  http://www.amazon.com/GAME-O-Bluetooth-Wireless-Controller-Playstation/dp/B00WUX9RCW\nFor these pads, they both had great button clicking and tapping - the sensors worked immediately and every time no matter how or which angle I pressed the buttons. The physical properties of the pad and sensors on both of them are great.  Wired they work perfectly, but I cannot get them to work wireless over bluetooth with the same issue mentioned here as well as many times in both PCSX2 forum threads (the original Scarlet Crush as well as yours).  The output in ScpServer and logs is identical to what LOSSLOSS posted above.\nAll three of these gamepads I linked here come up as VID_054C&PID_0268 (with REV0100) but the name when you plug in via USB is a little different for each of them.  \nSlickblue:  PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller (MAC 8A:5D:66)\nFivestar: PS(R) Ga`epad just like above.. for MAC I don't remember because it is already in the box to return :) \nGAME-O: PS3 GamePad (MAC 03:82:88)\nHowever when connecting via bluetooth, the response to the HCI name request seems exactly the same for all of them:  PLAYSTATION(R)3Conteroller-PANHAI\nSo I pulled down the source code for the latest release and decided to do a little debugging to see if I could either do a quick-fix to get it working or find more out about the problem.  \nThe first thing I noticed was that the Slickblue (the one working) seemed to work exactly as the driver was expecting.. after name request and \"Trying workarounds...\" I sends a L2CAP connect request as HID_Command (0x11 in position 12 of RawBytes buffer) and then another HID_Command on the L2CAP config request, then it sends a connect request as HID_Interrupt (0x13 in position 12) followed by L2CAP config request also as HID_Interrupt ... this leads to connect.CanStartService set to true and ScpServer continues by establishing the connection with the controller.  It works perfectly.\nThe Fivestar and GAME-O seem to be doing the same thing as in this post, though.  They are able to come all the way to where name response is given but then it immediately executes an HCI_Disconnection_Complete_EV.  So I dug a little more to see if I could find what is happening.\nFirst off I noticed that the position 12 never changes over from 0x11 to 0x13 on the 2nd pass.. it always just stays at 0x11.  The second thing I noticed is that MTU was showing as 672 yet on every other working example (and even the Slickblue) it looks like MTU is 0.  The ones that aren't working are setting value in position 20 and 21 while the ones that are working fine seem to have 0 in these positions on L2CAP Config response.  The third thing I noticed, (and maybe this is more important?), the bytes for Source Channel Identifier that the controller is sending back is different on the working vs non working. \nSo now looking at HciWorker ... when the working controller is sending as HCI_Connection_Complete_EV (position 8 of this raw buffer is 0x03) then byte 14 and 15 both have a value which looks like are the 2 valid SCI (0xee and 0x20 in this case).   HCI_Connection_Complete_EV (0x03) is received twice and the value stays same in 14 and 15, but then when it goes to HCI_Connection_Request_EV (0x04 in position 8) then these 2 values (0xee and 0x20) move to position 12 and 13 just like the code seems to be expecting (as per code in getter of SourceChannelIdentifier).  When it is first on 0x03 the values for byte 12 and 13 are 0x40 and 0x00 so it looks like this:\nFirst:\n[8]=0x03\n[9]=0x01\n[10]=0x08\n[11]0x00\n[12]=0x40 \n[13]=0x00\n[14]=0xee\n[15]=0x20\nThen:\n[8]=0x04\n[9]=0x01\n[10]=0x08\n[11]0x00\n[12]=0xee \n[13]=0x20\n[14]=0x00\n[15]=0x00\nFor the non-working controllers, on HCI_Complete_Connection_EV (0x03) it has a value for byte 14 for the first SCI but the value in byte 15 is 0 .. so is there only 1 source channel?  Or is this bogus?  Also I noticed that the value is always the same 0x40 so maybe that is actually supposed to be in 12 and 13 instead but the controller is sending things in the wrong position?  It looks like this:\nFirst:\n[8]=0x03\n[9]=0x01\n[10]=0x08\n[11]0x00\n[12]=0x43 \n[13]=0x00\n[14]=0x40\n[15]=0x00\nThen:\n[8]=0x04\n[9]=0x03\n[10]=0x08\n[11]0x00\n[12]=0x40 \n[13]=0x00\n[14]=0x00\n[15]=0x00\nSo it looks like 0x40 is moving up from 14 to 12 when 8 = 0x04 (HCI_Connection_Request_EV) like it is supposed to but why is the 2nd channel not set?  Is it even valid for the controller to only have 1 Source channel?  \nAnyway the short version just from my observations is that it seems like there are some issues with these \"non-working\" PANHAI and not following bluetooth spec.  Some things seem way off or just missing completely... I am not sure.  Do these actually work wirelessly with a PS3?  I have never tried and I do not own a PS3 .. just looking for cheaper but good wireless controller options for HTPC and didn't want to spend $80-100 for a pair of genuine when they will only be used a few times a month at most!\nHopefully this helps but maybe some of this is irrelevant or just TMI .. just observations that I made.  My current conclusion is that it might be nearly impossible to get these controllers like this working since they seem to be this far out of bluetooth spec but it could be also that I just do not know enough about it to be certain.  \nI am returning the Fivestar controllers and planning to return the Slickblue controllers to Amazon as well pretty soon since the button response is so poor.  I will probably return the GAME-O controllers as well at some point when I am ready to give up on the hope for them :) As an aside, does anyone know of decently priced fake controllers that have good button response and DO work wirelessly with ScpToolkit just fine?  I would love to know ;) \n. And just as a followup ... this GAME-O controller I referenced above works perfectly on Android using Sixaxis Controller.  I wonder what the magic is?  :) \nhttp://forums.pcsx2.net/Thread-ScpToolkit-XInput-Wrapper-aka-ScpServer-Reloaded?pid=514297#pid514297\n. @nefarius I have found the one thing to change which fixes PANHAI connecting on bluetooth for me.  Here is a patch for BthDongle.L2cap.cs that solves it for me:\n```\n133c133\n<             var buffer = new byte[10];\n\n\n        var buffer = new byte[14];\n\n144a145,148\n            buffer[10] = 0x01;\n            buffer[11] = 0x02;\n            buffer[12] = 0xa0;\n            buffer[13] = 0x02;\n```\n\nMore information here:\nhttp://forums.pcsx2.net/Thread-ScpToolkit-XInput-Wrapper-aka-ScpServer-Reloaded?pid=515994#pid515994\nBasically for L2CAP_Configuration_Response changing it to have a 14 byte payload instead of 10 and adding these 4 bytes to the end. You will probably want to test this change with genuine controllers but for my GAME-O pad I mentioned previously this works perfectly.\n. @nefarius More info also in this later forum post here thanks to a find by hman77: http://forums.pcsx2.net/Thread-ScpToolkit-XInput-Wrapper-aka-ScpServer-Reloaded?pid=516146#pid516146\nLooks like this packet should be very similar to L2CAP_Configuration_Request where MTU option is specified.\nbuffer[10] = 01 Config Opt: type = MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) - Hint\nbuffer[11] = 02 Config Opt: length\nbuffer[12] and [13] = MTU (and in case of my PANHAI pad, 0xa0, 0x02 (672), same as in screenshot above as well from @LOSSLOSS  )\n. Hi, the patch text I provided above completely represents everything that I had to modify in the source for this to work .. there is really nothing more.  I can upload the new version of the file but I assume that @nefarius would know what to do using what I already provided :)  basically changing the byte array to 14 length instead of 10 and then adding the last 4 bytes to the end.\nAlso my modification only probably works if your controller is reporting MTU of 672 as per screenshots in this thread. If your controller is reporting a different MTU then it probably might not work.\nSomeone on the PCSX2 forums mentioned it is working with both their PANHAI pad as well as a genuine Sony controller at the same time ... wonder if all controllers are reporting either 0 or 672 for MTU ?\nIf not I have tried to think of a few ways to first fetch the MTU from the controller and then send in this packet. I looked at the stream of bluetooth data in my Wireshark captures both in Linux as well as Windows.  In Linux with sixad it is sending a different packet for \"get extended features\" that is not being sent in Windows by ScpToolkit but when I inspected the bytes in the buffer that is returned I don't see reference to the MTU anywhere, as well as have not noticed it anywhere else in the stream of packets.  If it is really needed to first get the MTU and then send the L2CAP Configuration Response packet then I have 2 different ideas. Both are based on the premise that when you send L2CAP Config Response first without the MTU option specified, then when controller sends back a response it does include the MTU in its response.   That is how it is able to print the MTU in the log, as well, getting it from this same packet.  And again this is all assuming that sending MTU of 672 does not work with all controllers (it might work fine to send 672 for everything.. I just don't know if it does or not!!)\nSo if sending 672 does not work for everything, here are 2 ideas I had:\n1. Send an L2CAP Config Response packet without MTU and then read the MTU from the Controller's L2CAP Config Response packet, and then immediately send another L2CAP Config Response that includes the MTU if the MTU was not 0. The issue I worry about with this option is that I think the PANHAI controller is sending an HCI Disconnect immediately after sending L2CAP Config response without specifying the MTU ... like this is its way of rejecting that packet, by immediately disconnecting and then trying again.  Which leads me to....\n2. Take the MTU from above that is sent back (again if it is not 0) and then store it in an array maybe with 2 positions: MAC address, MTU.  Then allow the controller connection to fail and get into that HCI disconnect > connect request loop.  With each pass of the connection, read this MTU array to see if MAC address exists in it before sending the L2CAP config request. If it does, then send the packet with MTU option specified.  This means that the PANHAI controllers would try to connect and then fail once, but then should pick up and connect on the 2nd pass. The flow would look sort of like this:\nConnect request # 1 > ... > L2CAP Config Response to controller without MTU specified > controller sends back L2CAP Config Response with MTU provided > Store MAC + provided MTU into an array > Controller sends HCI Disconnect .... Connect request # 2 > ... > L2CAP Config Response to controller, but this time the MAC address would exist in the array so we would send with MTU specified > ... > successful connect for PANHAI controllers on 2nd attempt.\nEdit: or 3rd option I had considered but forgot about before posting... create a quirk table similar to how it is done for Linux kernel modules, and depending on the controller name and/or MAC address ranges you could send different MTU values.  This would rely on having to build in a quirk for each different name that has different MTU than 0 (or is not working without sending MTU option) so it might take time and reports from the community to get them all covered.\nAlso @ManHunter this loop you posted, that is the connect / disconnect loop that I think is the original issue and what my modified version of the ScpControll.dll tries to address for PANHAI controllers. It is working for me with the beta (tried on my dev laptop where I made the change as well as installed it on my HTPC and working in both places) as well as several people here as well as on PCSX2 forums. A few things I am wondering -- did you install the beta version, and did you stop the Scp DS3 service before trying to replace the ScpControll.dll ?  It should probably be located under C:\\Program Files\\Nefarius Software Solutions\\ScpToolkit\\ and you can tell if you are using the modified version by looking at the file size of ScpControll.dll -- my file is around 201 KB (206,336 bytes) while the original is around 204 KB (209,408 bytes)  .. not sure why mine is smaller with a few lines more of code except that I compiled it in Release configuration in Visual Studio where @nefarius may have compiled in debug mode for this beta.\n. @Reigninwild I am not sure on Windows 7 , I have only tried on Windows 8 and Windows 10.  I assume it should work the same however :( \nSo you are saying it only tries to connect once and then stops?  What kind of controller do you have?  Is it a PANHAI also?  Maybe screenshot or full Service / Server log would be helpful\n. @redeven I went ahead and changed this code on the version 1.6.238.16010 for you and uploaded it back to my original post in the forum. I did not test it (don't have that release installed anywhere!) but assume it should behave in the same way.

I followed all of  cysap1321's instructions; only thing  I had to do additionally to get the beta SCP to recognize the controllers via USB was to manually delete the drivers for the panhai and any genuine ds3's from the device manager. Then run the new scpdriver...and after that pasting the .dll.....VICTORY!!! Thanks everyone, been waiting for this.\n. \"redeven\" did you install the ScpDriver after doing a wipe? I had no success on my first install of SCP-Beta-7.277.16103. After using Nefarious' wipe tool a second time, I went in to my device manager and noticed the Panhai's were showing up with the original scpds3 driver; I still have Scarlet's last working SCP installed, for SCP-Pair. I uninstalled those drivers and had windows re-install the original drivers. I then ran the ScpDriver installer for SCP-Beta-7.277.16103, this time the installer recognized the Panhai's, and when running ScpServer manually the devices showed up connected through USB. I then quit SCPServer, and pasted the modified .dll \"j0shg\" provided in to the appropriate folder, ran ScpServer again, and the .dll worked! Panhai connected through Bluetooth! I can still use Scarlet's SCP-Pair, however it still doesn't recognize the Panhais. I don't want this running as a windows service, I prefer to manually start SCP, just click next when you get to the \"Install Windows Service\" during the ScpDriver installer. I have a somewhat complicated system and I was able to get the Panhai's working on two windows machines, an 8.1 laptop with on board Bluetooth and a USB Bluetooth dongle, also got this working on a 7.1 desktop with two Bluetooth USB dongles, one dongle on each system successfully running SCP-Beta-7.277.16103 with Scarlet's last SCP build working as well (For ios pairing). And my genuine DS3's are working too. You'll figure this out, I'm an idiot and I did. Big thanks to Nefarious and j0shg... Thanks a billion, I owe you guys a gift card or something. Now if we can get an updated SCP-Pair for Beta-7.277.16103, that would be perfect...is this possible?\n. I had some trouble first; one thing I've noticed is that one wipe or one deleting of a driver didn't always revert back to a clean machine. For example I had to delete the drivers for my BT dongle on my laptop twice, only because my on board BT driver replaced the dongle's after the first un-install. It also happened with the genuine DS3s and the Panhais; I had to delete drivers multiple times in order for the beta driver installer to detect the controllers. I never had any problems with Scarlet's original SCP builds, I've only lurked on Nefarious because of the work towards getting the Panhais working. You'll figure this out, maybe running Scarlet's last build and installing his drivers for SCP first and then running the beta might work, I've got both running on two systems manually starting with SCPServer. \n.

They don't even have to be in different hubs (which I hadn't realised until now). I just tried it with one in Port_#0001.Hub_#0008 and the other in Port_#0002.Hub_#0008 (side by side in this front panel sata hub USB 2.0 ports) and it worked fine. Even randomly unplugging and plugging them back in didn't cause any problems. \nAnother thing that surprised me was that I could replace the SCPtool one with a different unit and it still had the same mac address so I didn't have to re-pair the controller.\n. @Zer01neDev what are you trying to do? For the IMU data you either have to use PSMoveAPI like mirh said or use the newer PSMoveService (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/psmoveservice).. @hige-agusd Which controller are you using? If it's a DS4 I was happily surprised to find that it works natively (more or less) meaning that you don't have to slave a BT adapter to it.\n. ScpToolkit slaves the bluetooth adapter for use with the PS controllers. You'll have to reinstall the normal bluetooth driver to get your bt mouse to work. \nFor your wired mouse, sometimes it take a while for the drivers to install on a new port so just leave it in for a bit and wait .\n. There's probably a way to do it with the software but I like the device manager. On win 8.1 or 10 right-click the windows logo and select Device Manager. Then find the bluetooth adapter and uninstall and delete the driver. You can check that you found the correct device by unplugging it and watching it disappear from the manager. Scan for new hardware in the Device Manger or unplug and re-plug the adapter to make it install the default driver.\nIf you get two adapters there's a way to slave one to ScpToolkit and use the other normally but it's a little fiddly.\n. No it won't be under Bluetooth - that's the problem. For the original version it was under \"Universal Serial Bus devices\" so it's probably something similar for this version of ScpToolkit. Just unplug and replug your adapter a few times to see what changes in the Device Manager.\n. ",

Tomorrow I'll try installing this build (14316) in a VM to see if I can replicate the issue from a clean install state.\n. Thanks for testing. I installed the same build I'm running (14316) in a VM, and the driver works without any issue - so my installation must be corrupted somehow. I'll run some SFC/DISM repair operations or find a way to clear the driver store to see if that helps... otherwise I'll wait for the next Insider build and see if the upgrade solves the issue.\nWill close the issue since it appears to be an issue on my end only.\n. nefarius,\nActually, it looks like it may be an issue with your driver's signing after all. Please check Event Viewer -> Applications and Service Logs -> Microsoft -> Windows -> CodeIntegrity -> Operational.\nIn the Windows 10 VM I set up, the virtual hardware is configured in BIOS mode (VMWare Player default), so event id 3085 was shown: \"Code Integrity will disable WHQL driver enforcement for this boot session.  Settings %1.\".\nMy actual installation is running in EFI Secure Boot mode, so this event id was not logged. Once I disabled Secure Boot, your driver started working correctly.\nThere must be something wrong with your driver, as the previous version of ScpVbus.sys signed by another author worked in Secure Boot mode. I suggest that you install the Windows SDK for Windows 10 and check your driver/catalog using the signtool.exe.\n. When Secure Boot is enabled, instead of event 3085 (see earlier reply), event 3084 appears in the Microsoft-Windows-CodeIntegrity/Operational log:\n\"Code Integrity will enable WHQL driver enforcement for this boot session.  Settings %1. Exemption %2.\"\nThis is followed by event 3004 in the same log (almost identical to the security audit failure logged as event 5038 in the Security log):\n\"Windows is unable to verify the image integrity of the file \\Device\\HarddiskVolume4\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\ScpVBus.sys because file hash could not be found on the system. A recent hardware or software change might have installed a file that is signed incorrectly or damaged, or that might be malicious software from an unknown source.\"\nI've ran the obvious checks - chkdsk and SFC found no problems, so it's not a simple matter of a corrupted file. \nIf you enable Secure Boot, please make sure it's working properly. Make sure to restart Windows and not merely shut down before changing the EFI setting (as the hybrid startup feature will continue using the previous EFI configuration until you do a full restart). Once you've enabled it in the EFI settings, msinfo32 should show \"Secure Boot State: On\"). I suggest that you see if whether event id 3084 or 3085 is logged on your system afterwards.\nBy any chance, was the previous version of the driver a user-mode driver, but your version is now a kernel-mode driver?

Updated to build 14328 today - same problem with the driver when Secure Boot is enabled, unfortunately.\n. charlesmilette,\nThanks, but it's not necessary. I've already confirmed that the driver works fine from the equivalent one-time boot with signature enforcement disabled. I'll keep Secure Boot disabled until the issue is figured out.\nYou mentioned that you've got Secure Boot enabled, but what version of Windows are you using? I just double-checked my Windows 8.1 USB installation, and the driver definitely works fine with Secure Boot either on or off. Unfortunately, the CodeIntegrity log doesn't have any of the equivalent events related to driver enforcement as present in Windows 10.\nIt seems to be a problem unique to (at least certain versions of) Windows 10.\n. The change is explained from the horse's mouth here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/kernel-mode-code-signing-policy--windows-vista-and-later-\nAs to why a recently wiped install doesn't have the issue, I suppose it depends on how Microsoft implemented the check for a \"clean\" install to apply the new or old driver policy. Perhaps a \"Refresh\" or whatever it's called doesn't clobber the old driver policy OR you're using a pre-1607 build.\nThe only way as an end-user to continue using ScpToolkit is to disable test-signing or Secure Boot. I think nefarius has already submitted (and had accepted) his FireShock/Vigem drivers for verification, so that will work on Windows 10 with Safe Boot.\nI'll close this issue since the issue is known and not really in the developer's direct control.\n. It's a bug in recent preview builds of Windows 10 related to the Xbox 360 driver, not ScpToolkit. Until it's fixed properly, you can workaround the problem:\n- Plug in the controller\n- Open Device Manager and click on \"Xbox 360 Controller Driver for Windows\"\n- Click Driver tab -> Update driver -> Browse my computer for driver software -> Let me pick from a list of device drivers on this computer -> Show all devices, and install driver version 2.1.0.1349 [13/08/2009].\n. There should be a \"Close issue\" or \"Close and comment\" right below the box where you type your reply (that I'm typing in right now).\n. So this seems loosely related to issue #266.\nacme420, please check Event Viewer -> Applications and Service Logs -> Microsoft -> Windows -> CodeIntegrity -> Operational. Do you see event id 3084 or 3085 there?\nnefarius & charlesmilette - perhaps on Windows 7, WHQL enforcement is enabled by default (since Secure Boot is not supported), whereas the restriction is more relaxed in later versions of Windows for systems with Secure Boot disabled/unsupported?\n. nefarius,\nThis looks likely to be the problem. Your issuer is called \"Certum Code Signing CA SHA2\" but you've used the SHA1 algorithm. I recommend you change it.\nhttps://www.osronline.com/showthread.cfm?link=274519\n\nThis error maybe caused by the algorithm you used to code signing is SHA-1. The \nuse of SHA-1 as a hashing algorithm for signing purposes has been discouraged \nand is no longer a best practice, and  Microsoft does NOT support for SHA-1 \nhashing algorithm from 1 Jan 2016. Microsoft recommends using the SHA-2 hashing \nalgorithm instead.\n. I tried with no success, sadly. Would you be able to share the exact command line you've used via signtool to sign the driver? Are you specifying the cross cert correctly?\n\nSee, e.g.: https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsdesktop/en-US/b3a1db5d-d81b-4b9a-bd08-5b3b69b7e708/windows-cannot-verify-the-digital-signaturecode-52?forum=wdk\n\nTurns out I did have the right cross certificate but I was confused by the instructions.\nOn the web page http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/gg487315.aspx it says to find \"Find the Issuer and Thumbprint for this certificate. Then locate the corresponding entry for this CA in the list below\"\nThe Issuer is Verisign but the Thumbprint does not match the \"Root certificate thumbprint\" of VeriSign Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority \u2013 G5. Turns out that the thumbprint is thumbprint of the cross certificate, not the root certificate.\nWhen I use the new cross certificate then signing, verification, and installation succeed.\n. I've no idea about Windows 7, but maybe your cert is not complying with the new requirements for Windows 10? See: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff548231(v=vs.85).aspx\n\nTake a look at the table and compare the requirements for x64 for Secure Boot enabled vs disabled.\nIf that's the problem, there may be a way around the requirement for an EV cert, etc.; read the \"Windows 10 kernel modules must be signed by the portal\" section: http://www.davidegrayson.com/signing/\n. The manually-signed driver still has the same problem. I'm sorry to break it to you, but I think your certificate can't sign kernel-mode drivers on Windows 10 Secure Boot mode.\nAgain: http://www.davidegrayson.com/signing/#kmod\n\nMicrosoft announced that all new Windows 10 kernel mode drivers must be submitted to and digitally signed by the Windows Hardware Developer Center Dashboard Portal, which is a web service provided by Microsoft. Also, 90 days after the release of Windows 10, the portal will only accept driver submissions from you if you sign them with an Extended Validation (EV) certificate, which is typically more expensive than a normal certificate.\nHowever, there is a really nice loophole. For backwards compatibility, kernel-mode drivers signed with a valid cross-certificate that pre-dates Windows 10 will continue to pass signing checks in Windows 10. The cross-certificate from GlobalSign was issued long before Windows 10 and it expires on 2021-04-15. Therefore, you should be able to sign kernel-mode drivers for Windows 10 with a regular GlobalSign code-signing certificate until then. I successfully tested this on a Windows 10 machine on 2015-11-10.\n\nYour cross-certificate is dated 29/10/2015, after Windows 10 RTM. The older version of ScpVBus.sys that was signed by Bruce James (and works in Secure Boot mode) uses the GlobalSign cross cert issued on 13/04/2011.\nUnfortunately, the GlobalSign certificate seems quite expensive compared to the one you're using.\n. No problem, but I would urge you to double-check that information before buying a new cert.\nI read the original announcement, and the wording is a bit confusing: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/windows_hardware_certification/2015/04/01/driver-signing-changes-in-windows-10/\nMy first interpretation was that was that the date of the cross-certificate mattered (same as what David Grayson's blog says), but it's possible to interpret it differently. It may be the case that you can only continue signing code if your certificate (not the cross-cert) was issued before the Windows 10 release date. If that's the case, buying a new cert may not work. Take some time to read the comments in that link, as there's a lot of contradictory information.\n. Are you on a preview build of Windows 10? If yes, it could be this:\nhttps://github.com/nefarius/ScpToolkit/issues/271\nThe latest Fast ring build (14328) has the issue fixed, otherwise you can apply the workaround I listed.\n. ",

    "jloehr": "Whats the problem anyway? As long as the controller/devices successfully connects via Bluetooth or USB and exposes one Bluetooth Profile/USB Device Class, you can replace that Device Driver or inject a Filter Driver (or in case of HID a minidriver).\n. Ah ok, yeah then the Device/Filter/Minidriver Concept doesn't work.\n. Yes the default Bluetooth Driver can pair it. However it reports all of its HID Reports as \"Vendor defined\". So you need a driver or third party tool to actually use it as gamepad. \nWhen you check the USB Gamepad Properties, you'll see, that the gamepad has no buttons and inputs whatsoever.\nThat paper about the PS3 Controller is quite interesting. So correct me if i'm wrong, you first need to connect it via USB to set the Bluetooth radio address it will connect to. And then you also need to send some special message after it paired to enable it?\n. Ping: @Gooberpatrol66 #293\nFor the USB connected Controller, one could write an driver to set the Bluetooth Address, but as long as it also works with an User Mode App...\nA driver would load faster and only run when a device is connected, contrary to a background service, that is running always or does need the user to do something. However a User Mode Service may have other advantages, biggest one is it does not cause any BSODs. So imo a driver is not worth the work. Although that may change if the cable bound controller should be used in a cable bound manner, but that's another story.\nI assume when you set the Bluetooth Host Address via USB cable, the controller will connect fine via Bluetooth and is present as Bluetooth Device and its HID Profile as HID Device, isn't it? The only issue then is, it won't sent any data as it needs the special HID Message to start its \"operational mode\"?\nIf so the concept of providing a device driver for the Bluetooth connected controller is viable, so you won't have to replace the dongle's driver.\n1. You can either add a Filter Driver between the HID Class/HID Minidriver and the Bluetooth Stack to inject the HID Messager. You would need to inspect the BRBs to know when it is save to inject the HID Message.\n2. Second option would be to replace the HidBth Minidriver (as me with the Wiimotes). Then you would basically rewrite the HidBth Minidriver with the only difference of the special HID Message beeing sent somewhere in between.\n3. The third option would be to replace the HID Class Driver altogether and provide a custom interface to read and sent data to/from the controller. (such interface could also be implemented with the second option.)\nWith 1) and 2) the controller would be enumerated by the HID Class Driver as HID Controller. As the XUSB driver also enumerates each XBox Controller as HID Controller, each controller would show up twice (for DirectInput).\nWith 2) and 3) one could directly enumerate another child device and load the XUSB driver for it. Then the driver would be able to directly feed the input data to the XUSB driver without the detour via the User Mode Control Center, back to the SCPBus, etc. That may also be an idea for all the other Controllers (DS4 and cablebound controllers). This is btw. what i am planning for my Wiimote driver to make them available to XInput Games.\n. ",

Hello Nefarius, I've run the clean wipe utility and am in the middle of running the latest 1.7 beta installer. I did need one of the prerequisites, and got it installed, but have encountered a difference from your video tutorial. The time stamp is 12:21, and is at the point where I run the driver install utility. There is no device in the \"uninitialized dualshock controllers\" box. \nLike your comment on the video said, I believe this is because of the 3rd party (unofficial) ps3 ds3 controller. It's made by Arsenal Gaming if that helps any. Given the amount of time it's taken to try and get this thing working, I should have just bought an official controller and not had the headache this is giving me.\nHere is the Gamepad Analyzer Dump file:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/r9pgldxfap8nkgi/2In1%20USB%20Joystick_hid-report.dump.txt?dl=0\n. Thank you for keeping up with this and for making this software. I can tell you've put quite a bit of effort and time into it. I'm sure it's quite frustrating when problems like this arise, the controller is definitely  PS3 compatible, but they must send button data differently? I wish I could just simply remap the buttons via a control panel. The constant vibration issue has gone away since installing 1.7, I think you mentioned something about using a signed Windows driver instead of the libwdi offering, so maybe that's what fixed it? \nI wish I knew more about the technical difficulties and capabilities when getting these drivers to address the controllers properly. It would be cool to have an option during the install process to capture controller data like the game pad analyzer does, and create a driver that fits. \n. Exactly what version of ScpToolkit are you using? Older could mean the abandoned Scarlet.Crush project, or older revisions of Nefarius' work. Have you tried the latest 1.7 beta? Nefarius has also made a tutorial video walking us through the steps. I highly recommend the 1.7 beta as it does a prerequisite check on your machine to ensure you have all the additional official Microsoft libraries and such installed.\nHere's a link to the tutorial video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yH0pTK62DAQ\nHere's a link to the 1.7 beta (top most link is the latest):\nhttps://github.com/nefarius/ScpToolkit/releases\n. When you say you \"stupidly decided to install every possible driver,\" what do you mean? Did you select each usb device that wasn't your controller and force the driver install on them? Do you have any ability to take screen caps of what you did that was \"stupid?\" (eg. repeat the process, but don't actually install the driver.)\nAlso try plugging the kb and mouse to a different usb port, sometimes that helps install the right drivers when it's recognized as being in a new usb port.\n.

Even if you select install drivers for just ONE device on ScpToolkit Driver Installer, Win10 take those drivers and use them to any Bluetooth device. So that, you can't use the built in Bluetooth win10 functions.\nSolution:\n1. Go to Device Manager and locate the built-in bluetooth device, by this time is going to be on 'libusbK USB Devices'.\n2. Right Click on the Blutooth-in device (be sure is this) and select properties.\n3. Click on 'Driver' and now on 'Roll Back Driver', and close this.\n4.

Kind of humorous that you thank them for their hard work...yet you're the one who had to find a fix for it because they didn't.

Basically a genuine controller from the company that makes it is fake...according to the software.  I'm trying to resolve an issue where the connection turns off...then refuses to reconnect unless I uninstall anything associated with SCP and reinstall after rebooting.  Sounds annoying and incredibly frustrating?  It is.  Wish they'd fix this crap, but yeah...that's not likely to happen.  Others will always have to clean up the designers' mess.. Have to check when I log back on my system.  I had  to reboot after uninstalling...also had to walk away before the annoyance cause me to damage stuff.  (Inanimate objects cannot press aggravated assault charges so were my system cheap or if I still had anything easily replaceable, it'd have gone flying.). I'd wager on the software being the issue.  As I mentioned, my controller is direct from Sony, not a reseller.. I know.  That's one of the first things I did.  My issue is the controller timing out and will not reconnect.  Of course since uninstalling and reinstalling require a reboot...doing anything prior to save points that would cause me to be away for more than 2 minutes is next to impossible.. I'm tethered using the USB cable...all other USB devices do not time out and cease to function, though.. Actually it is a neutral way to start a conversation.  If I gave your a bunch of parts that were just scrap and you make it something workable, if you thanked me, I'd wonder way.  I only handed you scraps.  And  two.  Read correctly.

Afaik there is really no way to fix this easily, as the reason that the volume applet shows name not avaliable is that the scp service runs with admin privileges, which means that the sound applet can't pull the name\n. It is definitely an issue that stems from the permission model in Windows. There is no way for non priviliged code (the volume sliders), and the service where the sounds originate from(SCP Service)\n. Just don't install the ds4 driver when in the installer....\n. There is literally no way for the Toolkit to be affecting boot times before Windows is even loaded, more than likely its your computer has something it does with the usb ports thats causing it to wait longer than usual to post. There is literally NO WAY for a user land Windows program with a small driver to interfere with the boot process, as it does not have the permissions necessary even if it wanted to!\nEven if there were a gigantic bug in the program that causes Windows to crash as soon as it loads, It STILL wouldnt affect anything before Windows is loaded. But that would not affect pre-Windows anything, as Windows has almost no say in what happens before it loads unless you are on EFI or UEFI in which case Windows still wouldnt cause anything to fail POST, as the POST test happens before any storage is even looked at for booting. I think I might have an idea on whats going on. Certain motherboards will take longer if a usb device either refuses ignores or incorrectly responds to a command. Your motherboard might be waiting for the controller to do something for some reason and eventually just gives up and continues after a while. \nIn any case, other than something internal to the controller somehow affecting the boot process, there is nothing Windows can do to cause POST to work any differently other than calling a reboot, which causes the POST to go through a less strenuous list of tests. In that case, it would still be a firmware issue, as, while the controller has some built in flash memory, its only for settings and the controller doesnt export that storage as anything that a computer would be able to boot off of. New feature of steam, it will pop open if its running when you push the xbox guide button, which is what the PS button is mapped to. Its not a mapping issue, the steam controller grabs it when it sees the button and does its thing. Not a ScpToolkit problem, Amazon S3 is having a outage, try again later. MotionJoy has been shown multiple times to cause more harm than good.\nScpToolkit works fine on my machine, as well as many many others, the fact that you seem to think that the dev needs to immediately jump to action just because it doesnt work on your machine makes my head hurt.\nPeople like you insulting devs just because you can't do anything else productive with your time is why most projects end up dying. Either help find and fix the problem if you can, or put a issue report in and wait like everyone else. You have no right to try to rush someone without any intention of helping. Not having any issue with ScpToolkit, install survived Creators Update perfectly fine. I don't use bluetooth so I don't know about that though. Definitely smells like a bug in the upgrade process for the Creators Update is screwing something up that SCP doesn't like. Make sure that you are un checking the Bluetooth driver when you run the installer, either that or you can remove the Bluetooth hardware if its fesable to do so when you are installing the driver. Has to do with differences in how MotionJoy works compared to ScpToolkit, just disable the Game bar and the playstation button should go back to acting like it should. ",

I'm guessing hardware as doing an uninstall of the BT and SIXAXIS (non rumble DS3) drivers and reinstalling with the BT card and the SIXAXIS controller selected it works fine with everything I've thrown at it \nand also my BT card isn't technically supported\nmaybe test it with MotionJoy and see if the problem continues. you can disable the auto start for the notifications, thus disabling\u00a0them\n - Windows 10:\u00a0open task manager, More Details (if in the simple view), startup, click on \"scptoolkit tray notifications\", then disable\n\n\nWindows 7 and before: open the run dialogue (win+r), type in msconfig, click startup, select \"scptoolkit tray notifications\" and disable\n\n\n8/8.1: one of the two above, I haven't used much of 8/8.1\n\n\nI do agree that would be nice though\n. have you tried only installing your controller and Bluetooth?. I don't think it would, but you can try. another idea is to uninstall the camera from the scptoolkit in the device manager. use an external Bluetooth dongle, I had the same problem until I used an external dongle. try using the stable, I was unable to get\u00a0my Bluetooth installed using the beta so I\u00a0switched back to stable and it works fine. you will need @nefarious's attention for this then, hope he checks.

I found my answer with another GitHub app. See below\nFor Nefarious app, that would be amazing if Deadzone settings to remove drift would be available through Xinput Tester or somewhere within the app SCPMonitor or SCPToolkit itself.\nThank you!!\n(Answer to my issue)\nhttps://github.com/KrossX/Durazno\nDownload: http://tiny.cc/magicaltools\nOn DL page, get this: \n\nFollow readme file on first link, and you're good to go. Set Deadzone to 15 and that should do it. If unsure about how that works, there is this tutorial on YT that shows everything in a fine way (it says Xbox controller, but it's also PS3 for this SCPtools makes PC think it's an Xbox controller):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM3dKlRtYXw\n\n. Hi,\nDid you download this driver on Microsoft page?\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/products/gaming/xbox-360-controller-for-windows/52a-00004#techspecs-connect\nAlso, I used this version of SCPToolKit and followed all the steps and it worked plugged or with BT.\nhttps://github.com/nefarius/ScpToolkit/releases/tag/v1.7.277.16103-BETA\nBefore installing anything, uninstall everything, reboot, and lunch the toolkit on GitHub link above. Throughout the install, it will ask you to install the first link above before proceeding. When done, reboot, and they should work and be recognized as Xbox controllers within your games.\nI hope this helps.\n(Just another user). ",

Thanks for the help!. @lehleh \nHow exactly did you work around the problem? Right now it's not working for me even over USB :(. @nefarius \nI have figured out to solution to the problem. The root of the problem was that windows couldn't verify a digital signature on the drivers, like @charlesmilette said. The way to fix this is to go into your BIOS and disable secure boot. After doing this, the yellow exclamation point should disappear and your DS3 should be working perfectly. Thank you all for the help :). ",

Hmm, you did everything the way I did it, for me it worked straight away after I installed the drivers with Zadig, but my problem was that my BT adapter isn't supported so I needed to use Zadig, also I did use Better DS3 to pair my PS3 controller with my BT adapter earlier in the day, perhaps pairing is the only issue you're having? \nAlso your BT adapter needs to support Bluetooth 2.0 or higher + EDR, so make sure it can before you spend a lot of time trying to fix the issue.\nWhich version of SCPToolkit are you using?\nMaybe you just need to run the updater before installing the controller drivers.\nAccording to another post, ( #520 ) to pair the DS3 controller he had to update to ScpToolkit v1.6.238.16010 (and I assume reinstall the drivers) then just plugging the controller in paired it.\nI'm using ScpToolkit v1.7.277.16103-BETA\nIf you do have one of the newer versions, you could try running the SCPToolkit driver installer again with \"Force Driver Installation\" checked, or perhaps just without replacing the BT adapter driver, just do the controller. \n(Of course the controller needs to be plugged in the whole time)\nOr perhaps your PC is simply blocking unsigned drivers, although I would think it would tell you so if it were, if you haven't disabled the driver signature enforcement, you can do that by opening CMD as administrator [Win + X and select Command Prompt (Admin)] and entering the following:\nbcdedit.exe /set nointegritychecks on\nthen\nbcdedit.exe -set TESTSIGNING ON\nSome games like \"For Honor\" for example require integrity checks to be enabled to run.\nAlso bear in mind that using this solution will disable driver signature enforcement permanently, thus making your computer somewhat vulnerable.\nYou can re-enable it by switching the word ON in both commands with OFF though.\nI'm sorry if none of this helps, I'm kind of a noob in this department.\n& here is what my server looks like\nPlugged in:\n\nImmediately after unplugging it connects with Bluetooth:\n. I left the SCPServer & zadig in the downloads folder so it should be fine wherever you have it.\nFound out the driver with SCPToolkit is signed, so even if checks are on the drivers would still install..\nAlso I have no idea what that giant error is about.. but it looks like it's something to do with permissions or it could just be because that DBreezeSchema is already in use, it mentions \"creation of database folder failed\" perhaps it's as simple as running things as admin? Sometimes it's the smallest problems that take the most time to solve.\nHere is the list of compatible bluetooth adapters: https://github.com/nefarius/ScpToolkit/wiki/Compatible-Bluetooth-Devices\nIf you don't know exactly which one you have, you can compare the list with your \"USB\\VID_0DB0&PID_A871&REV_5276\" numbers from your BT adapter properties in device manager, but Zadig should work with any BT 2.0 or higher adapter with EDR as far as I know.\n**Maybe using the latest beta version of SCPToolkit will work for you, I couldn't say for sure.. but my HCI/LMP version are 4.149c and yours are 3.0c5c (I honestly don't know what that means though)\nI'm new to this too lol I have no idea how to pair, as far as I can tell, it should pair automatically when you plug the controller in or when you install the drivers with SCPToolkit while the controller is plugged in. :/\nThe beta doesn't have the legacy pair tool either and the one that came in the .zip with zadig in it doesn't seem to work, I just don't plan on ever pairing the controller with my PS3 again.. just in case..\nThe process of pairing with Better DS3 after SCPToolkit drivers are installed is long and should be entirely unnecessary.\nIf you want to try it, I don't think it's a good solution, but it will guarantee your controller is paired at the very least, here are the instructions to use Better DS3 to pair it:\nUSE ONLY AS A LAST RESORT\nTHIS REQUIRES DISABLING DRIVER SIGNATURE ENFORCEMENT\n[Win + X and select Command Prompt (Admin)] and entering the following:\nbcdedit.exe /set nointegritychecks on\nthen\nbcdedit.exe -set TESTSIGNING ON\nthen restart your PC\nto install the motioninjoy driver for your controller the safest way,\ndownload the driver here: http://www.mediafire.com/download/wjgegko4y8eqyw6/PS3_x64.zip\nunzip and put it wherever you want, \nin Control Panel>Hardware and Sound>Devices and Printers\nright click your PS3 controller, \ngo to properties, \ngo to the Hardware tab, \nclick \"USB Input Device\" in the functions list,\nclick \"Properties\", \nclick \"Change settings\", \ngo to the \"Driver\" tab, \nclick \"Update Driver\", \nclick \"Browse my computer for driver software\", \nclick \"let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer\", \nclick \"Have Disk\" \nenter the directory for the driver you've downloaded \n[for me it's \"L:\\Users\\Curtis\\Desktop\\PS3 x64\"] \nand click OK\nthen use Better DS3 \nDownload here: https://better-ds3.en.uptodown.com/windows\nmanually set the Master/Host MAC address for the controller using your BT adapters MAC address, which should be the same as the host address shown in the SCP Server picture from your post.\nonce done, you can do the SCPToolkit driver installation to replace the motioninjoy controller driver\n& if necessary, Zadig as well, I only needed Zadig because my BT adapter wasn't supported though\nand re-enable integrity checks afterwards as well. you could disable digital signature requirements/integrity checks, if you're not sure how to do that or don't want to take the risk, the easiest/safest way is to use this program: http://www.ngohq.com/?page=dseo\njust read the page and download it at the bottom, and of course follow the instructions.

I guess in that case your options are to either make your own USB extension cable or just not do any downloads when playing.\nSee if you can find any old electronic waste. You can get a female USB port from almost any device, then you just need a cable. Then solder/wrap the cables onto the proper female pins. You can find the way it goes on Google.\nOr you can get one from a Chinese shop for 1.5$ to 2$\nYou could also try putting some aluminium foil between the two dongles so it reflects one load of waved away from the other, like the Bluetooth waves forward and let's the WiFi carry on backwards to the router. Good luck. You don't want to cover the dongle completely. Imagine that they're both light bulbs and the foil is paper. You want to let the light shine out in a way it reaches your remote, but that it doesn't shine too much on the WiFi bulb . I used to have this problem with mine. It's when you're putting it together, I belive it's related to the little ribbon cable that presses onto the other one. Try pressing PS button in the center down hard and tapping it in the center near where that center cable is. It will either make it worse or better. The other option is just try putting it back together again paying special attention to that ribbon cable\n. Yeah. After pressing it hard on mine it fixed it, but previously they were randomly just slightly pressed. \n+1 for deadzones. ",

Where executing is mapping a process image to memory for the processor to execute. They are only different from PE(exe)s in their entry points.\nTechnically you could insert any malicious code into a DLL that would get loaded by SCP and get it to execute on people's machines but I don't think you are here to infect anyone.\nits the first place where people search to fix their problems\nI somehow doubt this. Most are probably using Google and your issue isn't high up in the results for me.\nP.S.\nDo you think your fix will work better than the original Scarlet Crush Productions solution did for my knock-off? (#628 (comment)) Key point I want to know is if Nefarious' tool with your fix is gonna work better for me than the original tool from PCSX2 forums in terms of compatibility and performance.\n\n@Erquint Well, i said before that DLL are not executables because it cannot be executed directly right, so its not by definition an executable, but i know it can execute instructions thats really obvious to make a discussion about it right hahaha, because that is actually what the DLL is doing at the ScpToolkit :p.\nThe search for solution of the issues part, what can i say is... yeah you right! first thing that people do is googled things i know that, but when i googled issues with ScpToolkit i end up here at the GitHub so its easier just search for solutions here at the Issues tab of the project sounds obvious huh? ;), another thing is if you have the ScpToolkit you probably download it here, so the section named Issues should be your first place to go, dont you agree with me? or you want me to have a blog with a post about it so much well ranked to be in the first page of Google? Well i dont know if you know about it, but rank to the first page at the Google its not that easy to do so much faster, so the better way i found to help was opening a issue with that title, so if someone googled scptoolkit bluetooth issues probably like what happened with me, will gonna find another open issue here at the GitHub and if this person look all the issues maybe will find mine or my reply on the other issues related to that one that i wanna help to fix,ok?\nAbout the softwares, if the older DLL works for you with your knock off controller, well ok good for you, but my experience was not good i always have to reinstall the drivers after a system restart, so for me was a headache and the only software that i can recommend because is easy to install, well ordered, well explained and as i could see of the code looks a really clear code and well made i did not monitor the performance compared to original Scarlet Crush but i used both and the one that worked for me it was the Nefarius ScpToolkit. I think if you talk about consume of memory or CPU, the Nefarius should be heavier because it install more elements, you know its a cleaner modern GUI, run on background, have a pop up notifications so it was an evolution of the original Scarlet Crush software and actually for what it provides its extremely light and soft and working with my fix do not change anything i did not experienced problems in performance on the system and on the controller as well, i dont have a delay in buttons its just like play with bluetooth on PS3. But if you got your controller working well you do not need to change to mine, i provide this DLL for people who cannot play with Nefarius ScpToolkit v1.7 so they do not need to downgrade to older versions.. @nendraharyo Man, i dont have time now to inspect this problem on the code, so the solution i have so far for you is just replace this modded dll by the original dll and open the settings change what you want and after you finish stop the service replace it again by the modded dll for fake controllers and its done. . is for Windows\nAgrade\u00e7o sua aten\u00e7\u00e3o.\nAtenciosamente\nThales Sch\u00e4effer\nWebdeveloper & Design\n2017-04-03 17:29 GMT-03:00 Nudg notifications@github.com:\n\nhello, is this thread for OSX or Windows?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/nefarius/ScpToolkit/issues/652#issuecomment-291264044,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AY1pzvqAgpooRbeVo8ihJ-LqcwRJ8ciIks5rsVa4gaJpZM4MMfi7\n.\n.

Man you have to use Clean Wipe Utility, then you go to your Device Manager and search for some drivers wich possibly was left behind, search on System Device see if theres some Scp Virtul Bus Driver  and on Universal Serial Bus Devices any driver with the Scp name on it, bluetooth or controller  so manually uninstall the driver, its good if you can uninstall these xbox 360 driver too and install it again then restart computer and install the version 1.7.277.16103-BETA follow the steps to install see if your controller shows on the instalation to be initialized and your bluetooth driver too just follow normally if you cannot get this to work maybe you have a 3rd partie controller, i dont know try to see whats your controllers is, i have some modded dll wich can work see my post if was your case 652, tell me if you can get it work.. well if you sure your controller is genuine not other branded or fake ps3, your problem is the driver for xbox as you mention you are using a windows 7 driver and you got a windows 10 so see if this video is similar to your case maybe you still have the windows 10 driver for xbox but its not installed so this video can help you to search for the latest driver.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0V6b75ZDcCI. @damron17 Hi, maybe if you do like @Jahron1 did, uninstall all the HID drivers not just revert the driver for xbox but all of USB HID that is shown on the device manager just be carefull with other USB devices that you use and then restart PC and plug your Controller on the USB and wait for the auto instalation driver if everything installs correctly try Scp again, good luck.. @nendraharyo Man, i dont have time now to inspect this problem on the code, so the solution i have so far for you is just replace this modded dll by the original dll and open the settings change what you want and after you finish stop the service replace it again by the modded dll for fake controllers and its done.\n\nWhen i have more time i will look deeper on the code to see why settings doesnt open, and i will update the file on the post and put solution there, but this issue you can close..

I'm using an original DS3 controller, and I've disabled the rumble through the ScpToolKit, but the problem still exists. If it's on, then I get too many notifications and the controller doesn't get recognized for a few seconds, then works again, then the same again- and again and again. When I turn the rumble off, I get almost the same problem, meaning no vibration or notifications, but the controller doesn't work for those moments when the vibration was supposed to be... I don't know what to do, cause in some games you can disable vibration from their menus, but in some you can't. And it's frustrating.. How can I completely disable any kind of vibration but without getting all that annoying lagging??. After some online searching, I found that this is not a problem caused by ScpToolKit, but the drivers of xbox wired controller itself (???)... Anyway, I think ScpToolKit does need an update, for being able to SAVE a specific setting in the \"global configuration\" - the one that says \"Rumble Latency\" under the Dualshock 3 specific settings. For now, I have put that value on the lowest possible (16ms) and it works. No vibration and no lagging at all, no matter if you tick or not the \"Disable Rumble\" in Global Settings. It would be much better though, if the program would KEEP the 0ms option, cause everytime I put it on 0ms, it automatically changes to to 146ms (or something like that). It should stay at zero, and not change by itself.. When on 0ms it changes to 128ms. Aaand, right now I see that again, it doesn't work as it should... The \"disable rumble\" option doesn't disable rumble at all, and the \"rumble latency\" doesn't keep any setting anymore.. Not 0ms, not 16ms, it literally doesn't keep any setting... Wtf is going on?

    "Erquint": "Bluetooth worked poorly(randomly varying latency) on my knock-off DS3 with the original SCP package. Never worked at all with this fork despite all the relevant drivers being installed to relevant devices and pairing messages indicating success.\nTried: https://github.com/nefarius/ScpToolkit/releases/tag/v1.6.238.16010 and https://github.com/nefarius/ScpToolkit/releases/tag/v1.7.277.16103-BETA. @curtiola \nFirst off, that is kinda offtopic. That is a different project this one is based on.\nAs far as I can tell, that Zadig process does nothing more than you can do with the built-into Windows Device Manager.\nYou guys need to learn what drivers and services are.\nServices are, basically, GUI-less(invisible) programs that get installed on your Windows that can be run, stopped and restarted. They require no user-input and communicate heavily with other services and programs.\n\"Launching\" a service that is already running does you no good.\nAll that you need to operate those is already pre-installed in your copy of Windows.\nJust type Services or Device Manager into your Start menu.\nP.S.\nAnd to those who downvoted the post above, I would like to ask if they even tried the proposed solution or just did it out of spite?. @nichharp \n\nThe \"server\" is just a monitor combined with the service.\n\nI know what services are.\n\nAre you sure? How do you stop the service to avoid running it alongside the \"server\"? (hint-hint). @thaleslipk I haven't tried your fix yet but I just wanna say the way you distribute it is a bit of a problem.\nThe proper way would be to fork this git, since keeping an issue open for a non-issue is kinda backwards and it's not very discoverable.\nPeople online are silly scaredy cats and are in fact overreacting but you give them a reason by employing these guerilla tactics of sharing executables in a discussion. Also, there's nothing technically wrong with using AdFly as a link shortener for any sane person but, again, normies \u2260 sane and see it as a top-level security threat.\nAnyway I get that you don't wanna fork for one line of code modification but it hurts seeing you trying to help and getting that kind of treatment. I've been in your position before and it is demoralizing:\n. Dynamically linked libraries are very much executable by definition despite the arbitrary extension.\nIn the sense that they can be executed and are made to be executed. Where executing is mapping a process image to memory for the processor to execute. They are only different from PE(exe)s in their entry points.\nTechnically you could insert any malicious code into a DLL that would get loaded by SCP and get it to execute on people's machines but I don't think you are here to infect anyone.\n\nits the first place where people search to fix their problems\n\nI somehow doubt this. Most are probably using Google and your issue isn't high up in the results for me.\nP.S.\nDo you think your fix will work better than the original Scarlet Crush Productions solution did for my knock-off? (https://github.com/nefarius/ScpToolkit/issues/628#issuecomment-282164172) Key point I want to know is if Nefarious' tool with your fix is gonna work better for me than the original tool from PCSX2 forums in terms of compatibility and performance.. ",
    "nichharp": "Thanks for all the attention :)\nCurtiola, I tried your method but I'm not seeing any results.\nI'll run you through the steps I took and see if I've missed anything.\n1)  go to the SCP forum and download\n\n2) put the file into another folder\n\n3) Run Zadig, Click \"Device\" then \"Load Preset\" and choose the Bluetooth preset\n\n4) \"Options\" choose \"List all devices\" (and make sure it's ticked). Choose the Bluetooth Device and \"Replace Driver\" [mine says reinstall since I already have it installed]\n\n5) Repeat steps 3 and 4 but with Dualshock3 preset and the PS3 CONTROLLER.\n\nI tried running the server and service... nothing. I tried reinstalling and keeping the zadig application open... nothing. \nShould I be using the SCP toolkit at the same time? because I'm not. If, yes, how?\nIf you could, can you send pictures (just copy and paste them in the text box) of your Server? I would like to see what it's meant to look like.\nThanks in advance. Maaaaan, I'm so jealous.\nYh I think the pairing is the real issue here. My SCP doesn't have a dedicated Pair tool.\n\nMy Bluetooth is 4.0\nHow did you know your Bluetooth was unsupported? (Just trying to find the precise issue)\nVersion wise, the SCP driver installer is 1.6.238.16010 and the SCPUpdater tells me it's up to date.\nThis was before trying your Zadig Method. I've tried combinations of using Zadig by itself and with the toolkit, nothing seems to work so far.\nBefore I'd run the SCPDriverInstaller and if I force install it would freeze and never yeild results (I once left it for over an hour).\nI haven't seen any signs of my PC blocking unsigned drivers although I do believe I did this method back when I was using motioninjoy years ago (also couldn't get bluetooth to work). Although i did see this message pop up earlier today and don't really know what it means or if it's even relevant:\n\nI tried running the ScpDriver.exe but that just gave my controller and bluetooth different drivers and didn't do much:\n\n\nso I changed them back.\nMy server when plugged in:\n\nMy Server when pulled out:\n\nAny other ideas? Maybe I'm being a noob and not pairing it correctly?\nAlso how are you using the folder? Have you put it under Program Files etc by itself, have you exclusively taken out Zadig or are you using a combination?. Erquint,\nYes, we have established that Zadig really didn't do much in the end (but thanks for the help anyway Curtiola). I know what services are. I know that I should either be running the Server OR the Service and not both.\nI haven't tried the links that you have sent either, do you think those would help? (considering it didn't work for you) \nP.S. \nI have a genuine PS3 controller so I figured it wouldn't solve my issue.\nI had a look at his tutorial and he said \"WARNING: THIS FIX MAYBE NOT WORK FOR EVERY FAKE CONTROLLER AND MAYBE CAN BRAKE THE CONNECTIVITY WITH THE GENUINE ONES, YOU HAVE TO TRY AND TEST.\nBEFORE YOU DID ANY MODIFICATION PLEASE MAKE A BACKUP OF THE FILES YOU HAVE TO CHANGE.\" so I wasn't in a rush to try that out.. Thaleslipk,\nYeah we said before that it's probably some sort of pairing problem. The bluetooth is supported so it's just annoying. Thanks for your help.\nI'll give your method a shot now and get back to you.\nErquint,\nI don't appreciate the condescension. I know how to stop the service. I would never be able to run the Server otherwise. I don't, however, know how any of it works and I'm not going to pretend that I do. It's a linking problem. For some reason the bluetooth dongle won't link up to the ps3 controller.\nSO, back to the point. Do you think it could be the bluetooth messing up or do you think it's a software issue? The old legacy pairing tool doesn't help whatsoever.\nedit: also, I forgot to say. I was looking through the settings and I found this. Could this be the issue? Unticking it doesn't do much. It seems to just revert.\n\n. Thaleslipk,\nI tried your method, following the instructions. And I'm not having any luck with it either. The controller won't work wired now.\nYour step 3 wasn't very clear \"3- Repeat the 2 step until it came to properties of your bluetooth adapter.....\" What did you mean by that phrase? \nI was getting this error even before i changed ScpControl.ini, whenever i tried to access the settings:\n\nAnd the controller wouldn't show up in the Installer, even after i pushed the reset button on the back:\n\nOther than the possible mistake in step 3, I should have done it fine but I'm leaving screenshots of the changes:\n\n\n\n\n(Some may say that the pictures are overkill but I'm kinda past the point of caring, not being able to play games wirelessly is kinda killing my mood :P ). Ok, I re-installed the 1.6.238.16010 version. And as it installed, this popped up\n\ncould this be the reason?\nalso some of the boxes for some of the other applications where not clicked, so i've made sure to download them again. And now i have a pair tool. Gonna try that out. I hadn't used the wipeclean utility before, just regular uninstall through Windows. And yh I did use the Beta Version when I attempted to perform ur method. I will try it again because the utility seems to have fixed the issue i had with the beta before.\nedit: Tried going through your method again. Wired is working but bluetooth still not working.\nAlso i took a snap of the tools it didn't want to install.\n\nScpToolkit_Log-Package_nichh_1488930151.zip\n. Still no progress. Wired is working but bluetooth is not.\nI was looking at the server, and the string of letters and numbers after arrival and removal look similar to a Class GUID. Is there something wrong here? Should that string be identical to the PS3's Class GUID?\n\n.

Thanks again.. Yes I agree with you.\nNow, I don't now why, I can connect via Bluetooth three controllers: 2 fake PS3 controllers (which are exactly the same) and one genuine PS3 controller. I didn't try with 4 controllers or with my 3 fake PS3 controllers which are also the same. I'll put news here.\nThe only thing I did is just install only one PS3 fake controller and one genuine PS3 controller through the driver installer of the latest Beta of ScpToolkit.\nHere is my list of peripherals in the manager of Windows:\n\nI don't start my ScpService, only the stand-alone server ;). Ok so I have news.\nI still can connect via Bluetooth 2 same fake PS3 controllers and a genuine PS3 controller.\nBut, I can't connect another fake PS3 controller in addition even if I have only one fake PS3 controller connected.\nDunno why but there are still some bugs then..

So you've tried to delete all Hid, PlayStation, Xbox, ect. Drivers, and reinstall ScpToolKit with the latest version? (Right click in Devices and Printers, and go to Device Manager.\nThen check everything, and right click, and delete anything that looks related.)\nMake sure your controllers are plugged-in when you uninstall.\nAlso make sure you have all the Installation requirements before re-installing.

Does your Device Manager show all hidden devices?\nOpen Command Prompt as Admin, and type this:\nset devmgr_show_nonpresent_devices=1\nPress ENTER, and type this on a new line:\nstart devmgmt.msc\n\nThat should open Device Manager.\nThen click \"Show hidden devices\" in the \"View\" tab.\n\nShould look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect all your controllers if you can, and delete the grayed out DS3, Xbox, controllers.\nYou can delete more. Like HID if you really wanna cleanup, and know what you're doing.\nNot recommended tho. DS3, and Xbox stuff should be enough.\nYou can also try going to \"Devices and Printers\"\nRight-click the controller (probably Xbox) and click \"Game controller settings\"\n\nClick the \"Advanced\" button (with the controller highlighted if there's more than one on the list)\n\nOn the drop-down list, select your controller (if not already selected).\n\n. Try disabling Xbox controllers 1 at a time in Device Manager till you find the one that's not working.\nThen uninstall it. A restart might be needed to make sure everything's uninstalled right.. Not sure if it's the same problem i've been having.\nBut the SCP Service doesn't start (Or crash?) sometimes  for me.\nI have a shortcut for starting the service tho, and works fine after i run it.. Try going into services.msc to see if your SCP Service is rly called \"SCP DSx Service\" Might be different.\nSee if you can even start it in services.msc. Else you might have to uninstall, and reinstall everything.\nAlso updated some info on the shortcut about this. You could also try \"sc start\" instead of \"net start\"\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/315166/net-start-service-and-sc-start-what-is-the-difference\nNot that i think it'd do anything. Try looking in services.msc or uninstall, and reinstall everything again.\nNever seen it give that error before. Hope you get it working tho. Also sorry for the late reply.. Even tho i've made sure that the service in services.msc \"SCP DSx Service\" is to automatically start.\nIt doesn't seem to sometimes. Or maybe just crashes?\n\nI have a shortcut to manually start it easy, and quickly tho.\nHope this helps you start the service easier after boot.. if \"that happens\"?\nHave you tried starting the SCP Service again through services.msc ?\nYou could also make a shortcut to start the service quickly if you keep having problems..

I can revert this by using the former program to uninstall the bluetooth driver but this also unistall the driver for the controller (which I have only been using through usb cable anyways). \nEsentially, my problem seems to be, even when I only select to install the plugged-controler driver the bluetooth driver also gets installed, likewise when i choose to uninstall the bluetooth driver  the controller's driver also get uninstalled. Is there anyway to fix/prevent this? it is really anoying to manually uninstall the bluetooth driver when I am done gaming (I have to use my bluetooth for other stuff) then reinstall the driver next time, rinse and repeat. since I am not particularly interested in using my controller wirelessly giving up on the feature entirely is completly aceptable.\nThanks for looking into this. Hi dash, there is no need to apologies. it is my pleasure to be able to contribute to the community with what little knowledge I got\nFirst open the SCPtoolkit_driver_installer (open it as admin just in case), then uncheck all install [ ...  ] driver boxes except \"install bluetooth drive\", click the \"choose bluetooth dongle to install\" and in the list check only the box that has the name of your bluetooth device next to it (mine says \"RT bluetooth radio) then click uninstall.\nthat should do it, in order to check if it worked go to device manager, you should be able to see the bluetooth sub-menu again, if not try ordering to look for hardware changes..

Same goes for my controller.. @sk4rlight If I unplug my mouse and keyboard I have no way to start the installation though. :(. @sk4rlight Yeah, but like I said, if I unplug both my mouse and my keyboard I will have no way to actually start the program.... Yeah, I've been unable to use my PS3 controller for weeks now because whenever I install it it kills my mouse (as seen in #736). ",

Then it didn't seem to overwrite those drivers, and the USB devices kept working normally.. A cheeky suggestion that is not guaranteed to work but worth a try imo:\n1. before u launch the Driver Installer try unplugging both the mouse and KB, then launch it (so their drivers don't appear in the list? not sure if it makes difference though)\n2. then plug in your mouse and select the controller drivers u want to install, then highlight the \"Install\" button, so you can just press Enter on KB to initiate it.\n3. unplug your mouse, plug your KB on, then just press Enter\n4. if it fails you could probably still use your mouse to revert it. Thank you very much jacobmix for the fast response.\nIt seems that your solution for my 1. and 2. problem by making a shortcut to manually start the service fixed them, I am very grateful for that!\nAs for 3: how do I locate what that phantom/ghost driver these are? All I know from the SCPMonitor is the address of that device or some sort: http://i.imgur.com/BwONXAE.png(pad 2 should be the ghost, pad 1 is the actual DS3).\nI have checked in Device Manager but I can't seem to find this information anywhere.\nThank you again!. There are occasions when I start the service manually it disables my USB keyboard and my controller still does not work. This is not consistent though, sometimes it happens, sometimes it does not.\nI have deleted 2 greyed out \"ghost\" devices: 1 was a 3rd Xbox 360 Controller for Windows, and the other one was a greyed out Playstation DS3 device, both not on the list anymore:\n\nThe ghost device after uninstalling these still stays in the SCPMonitor.\nAs for the Devices and Printers section, all 3 of these controllers lead to this same advanced settings, showing that there is 2 controllers; the first one is not responding to the controller inputs, while the 2nd one does, and by default the 2nd one is chosen. This applies to all 3 of the devices in the Devices and Printers panel.\n\n. ",

I am still scrambling around trying to fix this high CPU usage, I've fixed it before but now I am trying everything and I am really starting to thin out of idea's at the moment.\nThe 30% CPU usage is with the older zadig version, and the newest beta SCPToolKit as well, in fact, I can't get the controller to be detected still with the new SCPToolKit.\nEdit: I checked device manager and it says I have two wireless controllers plugged in when I plug in my DS4 controller, what a mess man.. I solved the CPU usage, it was related to having two wireless controllers installed because SCP installed another one on top of the one that pre-existed before installing the drivers.\nI went into the Device manager and noticed the two wireless controllers, I Uninstalled one of them and I of course had a tick box saying delete drivers, I did so and it prompted me to restart my PC, and so far the CPU usage has dropped back down to 0.2-1% usage as normal! I'll leave this hear so that anyone else maybe having this issue can come across it maybe and it may give them a lead to fix the High CPU usage.\nAlso, I find that I feel kind of stupid that I made a post for help and then solve it long before anyone would ever read this. xD\n.

I have a pure AMD setup so that cannot be my issue. I will however say that it does indeed appear to be a game_controller/creators_update bug that needs ironed out by Microsoft. \nAlso of interest is that my workaround (disable, restart, enable) has continued to work for me.

Some people say try with Scarlet.Crush's version.\nEDIT : Please see issue #888 for the solution i've had, Scarlet's version worked for me.. You are on which version of Windows ? Because it seems that Creators Update (rs2/rs3) releases breaks SCPToolkit.\nI say that, because i'm actually on Creators Update (rs3_release) and I can't get it to work.. Well, please see the issue I've made at #888 and try if it works for you, since it did work for me.\n. Have you used the Bluetooth one or the USB one (on Install) ?. Seems odd... Go to SCPDriver.exe and below uncheck Bluetooth Install, and try \"Force Install\". Hmm... Uncheck Force Install.. What is it saying ? Maybe I could find another solution by what is telling your log.. Okay, I see what can cause it.\nGo to your file explorer, right click on Your PC and click on \"Manage\"\nGo to your Peripherics, and search for \"Bluetooth\" or \"Universal Serial Bus\" and try to search for \"PLAYSTATION 3 CONTROLLER\".

Nice to see that it worked for you, enjoy !\nYou used the Bluetooth one ? If yes, it also confirms that Bluetooth works.. That's odd, because that's the contrary that happened to me xD\nAnyway, thanks to your results, I edited the issue.. Well, looks like you are the lucky one xD, even if I didn't had problems for a long time, but Redstone 3 (RS3_release) did break SCPToolkit fonctionnalities. Maybe you aren't in RS3.\nFor persons who are wondering \"wtf shadix what is RS3\", this is the pre-Fall Update.\n@alfredox123 Before I add this version on my OP, I will wait for other people to try and tell me if it works. I will put it as a \"Method 2\" for the moment.. Yes it is.. Creators Update said to be running fine as far as I know, but latest RS3 is messing some things (Pre-Fall Update). \nStill, will add as method 3. @Sonickyle27 Can you still tell me in which version of Windows you are ? It started \"bugging\" for me since ver. 16251 (RS3)\nEDIT : Edited OP.. Wow haha. So you have the same build as mine.\nI do not have that kind of option \"secure boot\" on my Phoenix BIOS.\nBeing in Test mode all the time isn't that good for the PC, since it is used for testing.. @nicholas-barcelos Try Sonickyle's solution.. beep boop, PCSX2... Which version of Windows are you using ?. Might be a conflict between your keyboard and Bluetooth. Try by uninstalling the DS4 BT controller and put it via USB. If it works, you can stay like that. Or else, try by reinstalling the BT driver and see if it works again.. Please see issue #888 for probable solutions. I've did that issue for a reason ^^. Try by uninstalling your actual drivers and by reinstalling them.. #888 's got updated recently due to some feedbacks. Give it another shot !. ntoskrnl.exe crashed with SCPVBus.sys might come with 0x07 : The driver called IoCompleteRequest while its cancel routine was still set..

I then uninstalled all the scp toolkit drivers and reinstalled them, restarted my system, and now the controller doesn't work anymore, I uninstalled/reinstalled all the drivers, went to the system manager like you told LadyDeath1138, didn't find a PS4 controller driver. the controller doesn't work at all now when I press the sony symbol while connected via usb. but the controller is functional when I unplug it. help me please.. It was USB connected. Thank you for the response but I finally figured out a fix. I uninstalled the SCP Toolkit entirely, but still kept the setup.exe. I then unplugged and plugged the controller, afterwards installed the SCP toolkit from the setup.exe, and checked Bluetooth and PS4 Controller on the toolkit driver installers. After installing them the controller let up (the blue light that emits when the controller is on) and it worked on steam and the fore mentioned game.

Maybe MAME. I've got two XB1 controllers, a DualShock4, a Mad Catz fightpad and fightstick, and a Steam Controller for everything else.). You'd need to use the same API as the lilypad-SCP plugin. Basically, you'd need to program an interface to SCPControl. If you're lucky, Unity will let you set up the 14 axes you'd need and map the interface to those Unity controls. If not, you'd need to handle them yourself in their entirety.\n(14 axes: 4 for shoulders, 4 for face buttons, 4 for the sticks - 2 per stick, and 2 for the D-pad - technically 4, but you might as well combine the opposite directions into single axes.)\nAlso, you'd need every user to install SCPToolkit; this isn't necessarily viable for everybody, and perhaps too much of a hassle for users that haven't already installed it.. #888 seems to have your answer.

Have you checked if it receives an input from the remote?. Seems like windows doesn't like your USB cable or the port you're connecting to, try to change to a different port, or change the cable.. SCP makes bluetooth function by overwriting the driver necessary for the bluetooth dongle, effectively changing the whole way it performs to ONLY work with connecting PS3 controllers. SCP won't detect a combination chip like that because it only queries for bluetooth only adapters. Even if it did find your chip, you'd be left without WiFi, so I'd recommend getting a separate bluetooth dongle with bluetooth 4.0. Once you install the DS3 Bluetooth driver to your laptop bluetooth, it becomes a dedicated bluetooth adapter for the remote, and won't work as a bluetooth adapter for anything else but PS3 remotes. You won't be able to connect your headphones through bluetooth as long as the adapter is changed to work with PS3 controllers. . Go to Device Manager, and find your XBOX 360 Controller, right click and select update drivers. . Looks like your remote kept plugging and unplugging really quickly, maybe try and check your wire?.

    "ToastyMisbehaviour": "Hello there, I have the exact same issue! I play Redout a lot and every time my computer goes to sleep, my game won't recognise any buttons anymore. I use a Ps3 controller. I tried everything from reinstalling the scp software to restarting the scp service in the service manager (which boots up with windows) and also restarting the game but none of this works. device manager says it works fine. Outside of the game, the controller works for some reason. It is so annoying to be forced to restart your computer every single time. Please help.. ",
    "cruizerdog": "I could be wrong but I think for windows you just go to device manager and uninstall the libusbk driver and it will auto install the old driver, or you may have to manual install the old driver. i also tried running SCPserver but it was doing the same as SCPmonitor/SCPservice and the pair button was greyed out\n. https://github.com/nefarius/ScpToolkit/wiki/Compatible-Bluetooth-Devices\nSo is this the only bluetooth adapters that work?.
